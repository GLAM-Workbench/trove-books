ROYAL COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO AND REPORT UPON THE WORKING
OF THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER INDUSTRIES.
REPORT.
To His Excellency The Right Honourable Frederic John Napier, Baron
Chelmsford of Chelmsford, in the County of Essex, in the Peerage of the
United Kingdom, Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of
St. Michael and St. George, Governor of the State of Queensland and its
Dependencies, in the Commonwealth of Australia.
May it Please Your Excellency,—
On 14th May last we were honoured with Your Excellency’s Commission to
inquire into and report upon:—“The working of the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer
Industry, principally with a view of devising, if possible, the best means of securing
the following objects —namely, (1) The working of pearl-oyster beds in such a manner
as to avoid depletion and to make the industry regular and permanent; (2) The
scientific cultivation of pearl-oysters and the probabilities of success in that direction;
and (8) The possibilities of encouraging white divers, with a view to their gradual
substitution for aliens in that capacity, and any other matters or things not hereinbefore
specifically included, information regarding which may in your judgment be likely
to be of assistance to you in the inquiries hereby entrusted to you.”
We entered upon our duties at Brisbane on Monday, 18th May, examining
witnesses there on 21st, 22ncl, 2(ith, and 27th May. We left for Thursday Island,
the head-quarters of the Torres Strait Pearl Fishery, on Monday, Ist June, arriving
there a week later. Between the 9th and 20th of June a large number of 'witnesses
were examined at Thursday Island, and a great amount of valuable information
was obtained. To satisfy ourselves from personal observation as to the condi-
tions obtaining on the pearling-grounds and the best means of achieving the
objects set forth in the Commission, we spent from the 22nd to the 30th of June
in visiting the islands of Mua (Banks), Mabuiag (Jervis), Badu (Mulgrave), Maer
(Murray), Errub (Darnley), Masig (Yorke), and Yama (Turtle-back) in the
Government steamer “ Champion,” taking evidence at all but the first and last
mentioned islands —Mua and Yama. Further evidence was taken at Thursday
Island after our return; and on Friday, 3rd July, we set out on our south ward
journey, calling at Somerset, Cooktown, Bloomfield River, Port Douglas, and Cairns,
and examining witnesses at each place. Townsville was reached on Wednesday,
15th July, but no evidence was forthcoming there; and, as we ascertained that no
persons were desirous of giving evidence at either Bowen or Mackay—which it had
been our intention also to visit—we proceeded direct to Brisbane, arriving on
Wednesday, 22nd July. In addition to the places mentioned, we landed on several
reefs, both in Torres Strait and on the east coast, to test the accuracy of the evidence
given regarding the extent to which the reefs had been denuded of beche-de-mer.
During the course of our inquiries we took evidence at twelve centres; —Brisbane,
Thursday Island, Mabuiag, Badu, Murray. Island, Darnley Island, Yorke Island,
Somerset, Cooktown, Bloomfield River, Port Douglas, and Cairns. Seventy-eight
witnesses Avere examined, all interested in, and the great majority directly con-
nected with, one or both of the industries—pearl-shelling and beche-de-mer
fishing—a considerable proportion of the Avitness s avlio presented themselves for
examination being pearl sbellers, beche-de-mer fishers, divers, ex-divers, boatoAvners,
auctioneers, commission agents, and merchants. Evidence Avas also given by a

missionary, licensed victuallers, a journalist, a Japanese interpreter, the president of
a Japanese Club, and various Commonwealth and State officials, including the
Government Resident at Thursday Island, sub-collectors of Customs, protectors
of aboriginals, shipping masters, inspectors of pearl-shell fisheries, a sub-inspector of
police, and teachers of aboriginal schools. Many of the witnesses were members of
the Torres Strait Pearl Shellers’ Association, while one was the secretary of a body of
men styling themselves “The Australian Fisheries Association and Alien Restriction
League.” Valuable statistics were supplied at Thursday Island by the managers
of the Queensland National Bank and the Rank of North Queensland and the
postmaster, as well as by the officials at the various ports charged with the adminis-
tration of the Pearl-shell and Reche-de-Mer Fishery Act, all of which information
is published in the Appendices.
In our Report we purpose dealing with the several objects of inquiry in the
order in which they are set forth in the Commission, and we shall conclude with a
summary of recommendations which, in our opinion, are likely to lead to the
preservation and improvement of an important and valuable industry, and which
will ensure to numbers of people of European descent a profitable means of
livelihood in the prosecution of that industry.
I. THE WORKING OF PEARL-OYSTER REDS IN SUCH A MANNER AS
TO AVOID DEPLETION AND TO MAKE THE INDUSTRY REGULAR
AND PERMANENT.
Ref ore proceeding to the consideration of the means to he adopted to avoid
depletion of the pearl-oyster beds, we deemed it advisable to ascertain whether, and
to what extent, the known beds had become denuded of shell and the causes for such
denudation,
RETROSPECT.
The first pearl-shell raised in Torres Strait appears to have been obtained
from the Warrior Reef by Captain Ranner, of Sydney, about the year 1868. Soon
afterwards shell was also found on Wappa and Orman Reefs, in Endeavour Strait,
and the various passages of the Prince of Wales group. The shell was so plentiful
and its quality so high that it quickly attracted the attention of shipowners in New
South Wales, and many vessels were despatched from Sydney, returning to that
port laden with a rich spoil. The first Queenslander to embark in the industry
was Air, Frank Lascelles Jardine, who took up his residence at Somerset over forty
years ago, and has remained there ever since, though he is not now actively engaged
in the business. Mr. Jardine first began operations as a pearl-sheller in 1872.
In the early days the pearl-shell was found in the shallow waters close to the
shore, and was either picked up on the reefs or was raised by swimming divers—the
system still in vogue in the pearl fisheries of Ceylon and India —and without the aid
of the diving pump and dress. The diving was generally done by coloured men —
principally natives of the islands in Torres Strait or Pacific Islanders, who worked
from small boats under the direction of white men, residing at stations established
on the neighbouring islands. As the first shell was obtained from virgin deposits, a
large proportion •of the bivalves were very large and of mature growth, and
therefore of great Aveight compared Avith the shell obtainable of late. For many
years it AA r as not necessary to impose a size limit for exportable shell, the supply
being so plentiful that no diver considered it Avorth his Avhile to raise shell Avhich
in after years Avas gladly taken.
As the old and full-grown shell became scarcer on the grounds then being
Avorked, to maintain the output it became necessary, in addition to taking shell of a
size Avhich had at first been regarded as too small, to search in hitherto untried
localities and to explore the deeper Avaters Improved methods of AAorking had
therefore to be adopted, as sAA r imming diving cannot be prosecuted successfully in
more than 7 or 8 fathoms. While the old system of sAvimming diving Avas still
continued by coloured men in the shalloAver Avaters, for diving in deeper Avaters
mechanical aids Avere introduced in the shape of air pumps and diving dresses,
necessitating the employment of Avhite divers accustomed to the dress. Larger

vessels/had also to he used, since the men had to make them their homes for longer
periods now that they had to go further afield in carrying on their avocation.
The success attending this innovation was marked; and, as the number of white
divers available was comparatively limited, coloured men were induced to don the
dress. Most of these were Pacific Islanders or Maoris. A few Norfolk Islanders also
took to the work. The great majority of the white divers had formerly led a sea-
faring life. They were imbued with a spirit of adventure and love of change, and
had the usual failings of men of their class. Their earnings from their catches of
shell were large, and frequent windfalls in the shape of valuable pearls gave them
command of considerable sums of money. According to more than one witness,
divers made as much as £4OO or £5OO a year from shell alone. On their return
to port, the money so quickly made was spent by the unsteady men in such a way as
to undermine their health, and they did not remain long in the industry. The more
prudent, on the other hand, soon amassed a competence, and retired after a few
years to enjoy the fruits of their labour in more congenial climes. In a few cases
divers purchased vessels and became employers in the industry themselves.
All these things brought about a shortage in the supply of divers. The
boat owners wore compelled to look elsewhere for labour, and this they found in the
Philippine Islands and the Malay Peninsula. The l-'ilipinos and Malays were willing
to work for lower wages than were paid to white men, and gradually most of the
remaining white divers dropped out. The Norfolk Islanders, Maoris, and Pacific
Islanders were supplanted later on.
The increase in the number of vessels and the advent of the diving dress,
which enabled divers to raise more shell than was possible with swimming diving,
resulted in the further depletion of the inshore beds, and in the industry becoming
less remunerative. Further deposits had to be pr, spected for, and in 1881 what is
known as the “ Old Ground” was discovered to the west of the chain of islands
stretching from Cape York towards New Guinea, This discovery gave a tremendous
impetus to the industry for some years. Shell was very plentiful on the Old Ground
and of the very finest quality, though less prolific in pearls than shell found in the
vicinity of the reefs to the eastward and in Endeavour Strait.
in The Old Ground is more exposed to the weather than the grounds previously
worked, and, to enable operations to be carried on with a maximum of safety and
with as little discomfort as possible to the crews, vessels of larger size and providing
improved accommodation were built. Prior to the discovery of the Old Ground,
few of the vessels exceeded 10 tons, gross measurement. Those brought into existence
by the exigencies of the fishing on the Old Ground have a tonnage of from 15 to
18 tons, while in a few instances they are of 20 tons burthen. It is the general
opinion of those engaged in the industry that no further increase in the size of the
vessels is required.
The remoteness of the Old Ground led to the formation of the boats into fleets,
which, however, continued to work from a shore station or base. To obviate the loss
of time, and the consequent increased cost of working through the vessels having to
make frequent visits 1o port to land their shell, obtain fresh stocks of provisions, and
effect repairs, boat owners established, on islands near to the shelling areas, bases
where they erected stores and workshops. This system gave them greater control
over the Avork of their vessels than Avas possible when their operations were directed
from Somerset or Thursday Island.
>f In 1885 and 1886 several pearl-shellers, influenced by the gradual diminution
in their catch in Torres Strait and by the discovery of rich beds on the coast of
Western Australia, left for the latter State Avith a large number of vessels.
>f Many of the vessels returned in 1889 and 1890, their return being partly
due to the terrible havoc Avrought by a cyclone on the "Western fishing-grounds,
Avhich caused a heavy loss of life and the destruction of numerous boats. The
shelters avlio escaped very naturally turned their thoughts to their old fishing-
grounds, Avliich, though subject at times to boisterous weather, Avere outside the
cyclonic zone. Possibly another reason for their return was the partial recovery of
the beds in Torres Strait—a recovery Avhich Avas undoubtedly owing to the smaller
number of vessels left on the grounds after their departure.

Simultaneously with the return of the fleets from Western Australia, what
is known as the floating-station system of working was introduced. With
the object of keeping the boats more continuously at work and preventing
them being driven off payable shell by the necessity of taking in stores or
refitting, and with the further object of depriving the divers of the opportunity
to open shell at sea and abstract pearls—which in those days were always
regarded as the property of the boat owner—vessels of larger size were intro-
duced—in most cases schooners of from 90 to 150 tons. These vessels served as
storeships for the shell, which was collected daily, or as frequently as possible, from
the shelling-luggers; the oysters were opened on the schooner by the owner or
some responsible employee, all pearls secured, and the shell cleaned and packed.
The luggers drew their supplied from the schooners, including diving gear, spars,
rigging, and everything necessary for the prosecution of their work. Asa rule, each
schooner had a fleet of from fifteen to eighteen luggers, all of which worked within
easy reach of the floating station. Most of those who had been operating on
the shore-station system ultimately adopted the floating-station system, which
manifestly enabled the boats to be worked on the most economical lines and to raise
the largest quantity of shell. So far as the temporary profits of pearl-shellers
were concerned, there is no question that the schooner system proved the most
advantageous; but, having regard to the preservation and permanence of the
pearl-shell as a national asset, it cannot be gainsaid that the system was most
prejudicial. From that point of view, it is a matter for congratulation that for the
last three years it has been abandoned.
When the fleets returned from Western Australia, the supply of divers,
tenders, and seamen was insufficient. To remedy the deficiency, men had to be
sought for in other quarters, and recourse was had to the fishing population of
Japan, These men were accustomed to a seafaring life and inured to its
hardships, while they were prepared to work for a comparatively low wage.
Although unused to dress diving, they proved apt learners, and in a short time
became expert and fearless divers. Year after year increasing numbers of Japanese
were introduced, until at the present day it may be said that the whole of the divers
in Torres Strait are Japanese. Out of 165 divers licensed in 1908, 164 are Japanese
and one is a Malay. A large proportion of the tenders and of the crews are also
natives of Japan; and it may be truly said that, so far as wage-earners are concerned,
pearl-shelling in Torres Strait is very largely a Japanese industry.
Further prospecting for shell led to rich finds in the neighbourhood of
Famley Island; but the depth of water over the whole of this area is so great that
numerous fatalities occurred among the divers. So serious was the mortality that in
1893, despite the existence of large quantities of shell, the Government of the day
felt it their duty to close the area by proclamation. But, as there was no effective
enforcement of the closure, the beds continued to be worked, and are still being
worked, more or less surreptitiously, by divers who are prepared to risk their lives
in raising shell from depths of between 35 and 40 fathoms.
FISHING STATISTICS FEOM 1890 TO 1907.
'1 he increasing number of boats and the drain inseparable from the floating-
station system of working afforded the grounds no time for natural recuperation, and,
as no steps were taken to provide for restocking the beds by artificial cultivation,
the take of shell per boat fell steadily year by year, unless when a favourable season
enabled the work to be carried on for a longer period. In this connection we wish
to express our regret that no official statistics are available for the years prior to
1890. We have taken the following table, showing the number of boats, the total

Note. —The latt°r column in this table is apt to be misleading, as the average value
per ton has been hitherto taken on
the declared value to the Customs at time of shipment, which may realise c u
siderably more
than then estimated.
Aa a matter
of fact, though it is generally known and admitted that there has been an
average fall in prices for the year of about £10 all
round, the average value of the various shipments has been approximately «£123 per ton, as account sales would show. Then

the average take for each boat is likewise unsatisfactory, as those fishing in what is
known as the Darnley Ground have
obtained nearly three times as much shell as has been obtained by boats working the
‘Old Ground.’”
take of shell, the average catch per boat, and the average value of the shell per ton
for each year since 1890, from the last report of the Government Resident at
Thursday Island :
From tliis table it will be noted that the number of boats increased from
1)2 to 210 between the years 1890 and 1893, the gioss take of shell during the same
period increasing from 632 tons to 1,214 tons, while the average catch per boat
decreased from 6 tons 17 cwt. 1 qr. to 5 tons 15 cwt. 2 qrs. The larger number of
boats allowed of a larger area being covered, and it is only natural to assume that
untouched patches of shell were discovered; yet the amount of shell raised by
each boat showed a marked diminution. • The figures for 1891 show that the yield
was practically stationary. But in 1895, with 204 boats as compared with 203 in
1891, the gross take fell from 1,190 tons to 873 tons, and the catch per boat from
5 tons 17 cwt. 1 qr. to 4 tons 5 cwt. 3 qrs. This falling off in-the catch per boat
appears to indicate that the beds had been overworked for some years.
From 1891 to 1896 the minimum size prescribed for exportable shell was
6 inches, nacre measurement. In the last-mentioned year some of those engaged in
the industry began an agitation for a I’eduction of the size limit from 6 inches to 5
inches. The agitation was successful, and legislation was passed reducing the size limit,
on and after Ist January, 1897, to 5 inches, nacre measurement. The number of boats
in increased from 207 to 223, and the total output of shell jumped from 1,089
tons to 1,223 tons, the catch per boat also increasing from 5 tons 4 cwt. 3 qrs. to
5 tons 11 cwt. 2 qrs., or almost half a ton per boat.
This increase was due partly to the large quantity of shell of between 5 and
6 inches which was raised, and partly to shell found in Princess Charlotte Bay, on
the eastern coast of Cape York Peninsula. Unfortunately, this latter shell was
of inferior quality, and is said by some of those most competent to express an opinion
to have been a material factor in ultimately reducing the market price of Torres
Strait shell, although this statement is not home out by the foregoing table. In
1899 a cyclone overwhelmed the vessels at work in Princess Charlotte Bay, causing
an appalling loss of life and property; and this led to the abandonment of the
grounds. It is only within the present year that work has recommenced there, a
lew boats having been attracted by a report that the quality of shell has improved
considerably.
We wish to draw special attention to the fact that the total take for 1897 —
the year when the size limit was reduced from 6 inches to 5 inches—is the highest
on record, and to the further fact that from 1897 to 1905 the total take of shell fell,

year after year, from 1,223 tons to 627 tons (with the exception of an increase of 139
tons in 1899 and a slight increase of 43 tons in 1902), despite the fact that the
number of vessels working had increased from 223 to 318. The average per boat
fell during the same period from 5 tons 14 cwt. 2 qrs. to 1 ton 10 cwt. It is only
fair to say that for the year 1905 the average catch per boat is misleading, as
during that year over 100 vessels which were licensed for the year left for the Aroe
Islands, in the Dutch East Indies. These vessels are included in the official returns
for the year, it being impossible, under the present method of compiling statistics, to
make any allowance for the lesser number of vessels working at the close of the year
in estimating the average catch. The number of vessels licensed in 1900 was 1:5, or
223 less than the number licensed in the previous year. The gross take fell from
527 tons to 444 tons, and the average catch per boat appears from these figures to
have increased from 1 ton 10 cwt. to 3 tons 11 cwt., hut, for the reason given in the
preceding paragraph, this is misleading. In 191)7, with 10 vessels more than were
licensed in. 1900, the total take of shell increased to 507 tons, owing principally to
more favourable weather conditions; the average catch per boat rising to 4 tons 4
cwt. So far this year the results have not been encouraging, although it is hoped
that, with more favourable weather and the smaller number of pump boats at work—•
namely, 112 —the catch per boat will be maintained.
In spite of the falling off in the output of the Torres Strait fishery during
recent years, the world’s output has increased considerably owing to an expansion
fin the industry in the Philippine Islands and the Dutch East Indies. In 1902 and
1903 manufacturers were forced to pay very high prices for shell to enable them to
fulfil existing contracts. When those contracts expired, cheap substitutes were used,
with the result that the price of pearl-shell fell from something like £2OO to £llO
per ton. The latest advices indicate that the present price is about £l3O per ton.
Evidence was given that in the earlier years of the industry shell sold for prices
ranging from £3OO to £lOO per ton; but we have preferred to confine ourselves
to prices obtained during the last decade, to show the serious depression from
which the industry is suffering. During the same period the price of pearls
fell to such an extent that they ai'e at present almost unsaleable. The serious
diminution in the take of shell and in the price obtainable for the diminished
output has led those engaged in the fishery again to appeal to the Government,
who have appointed this Commission to report as to the best means of placing the
industry on a more profitable and permanent basis. After the most careful investi-
gation conducted on the scene of operations, we have no hesitation in saying that
immediate action is necessary, if the industry is to be made permanent and
profitable to those engaged in it.
DEPLETION OF BEDS.
Individual witnesses have borne testimony to the fact that in the early days
.of the industry vessels averaged as much as 10 and 12 tons of shell per annum, while
we were informed that one vessel obtained 47 tons in four months, and no less
than 70 tons were raised within the narrow confines of Friday Island Passage. Dut
these phenomenal catches were obtained from virgin ground, and represented the
accumulation of many years. Some of the bivalves are asserted to have weighed
10 and 12 lb., and the average weight was much greater than that of the shell now
procurable. In a comparatively few years the supplies of matured shell were
exhausted, and shelters had then to roly upon the normal growth, supplemented
by chance finds of older and larger shell in new localities and in the deep-water
areas of Darnley and Mount Adolphus Islands.
The shallow beds inshore and those in the immediate neighbourhood of the
Prince of Wales group were the first to show signs of having been over-fished.
Later on, the beds in the vicinity of Mua, Dadu, and Mabuiag Islands and Orman
Reef also showed signs of falling off in their yield, and continued to do so until, on
the discovery of the Old Ground, they were given an opportunity for recuperation.
When the pump boats commenced to work on the Old Ground, the older beds were
left to the swimming diver, with occasional visits from the pump boats when bad
weather and other natural causes precluded them from working on the Old Ground.

Notwithstanding the richness of the Old Ground, the concentration of a large
and increasing number of vessels on the beds soon caused an appreciable diminution
in the quantity of shell raised there, and the boats were obliged to go further and
further to the westward in quest of shell, gradually approaching deep water where
diving would have been both difficult and dangerous.
The shelling-grounds at Darnley Island also began to he less productive, and
the extension of diving operations to the deep waters surrounding the island caused
such a serious loss of life that the Government were compelled to issue a proclamation
closing the whole area.
PROOFS OF DEPLETION.
Some of the witnesses examined by us asserted that the shelling-grounds
maintain their original richness; but tbe past history of the fishery and the weight
of evidence do not support their contention. Apart altogether from the statements
made by men who have known the industry almost from its inception regarding
large catches of shell in the early days, the official statistics available show that —
notwithstanding the extended an'a of the fishing grounds, the employment of a
larger number of vessels to seek and gather shell, their increased size and improved
seagoing qualities, the greater control and more efficient working resulting from
the floating-station system, the improvement in the system of diving, the reduction
in the size limit, and the encouragement given by the better price paid for the
shell between the years 1897 and 1905—the catch of shell has steadily declined,
1899 and 1902 being the only years during this period in which the export of shell
showed any improvement on the catch of the preceding year.
It is contended by some who advocate the removal of the present restriction
on the number of boat licenses that, so far from there being a falling off in the yield
of shell, the official figures for the years 1906 and 1907 show that in the.latter year
there was an increase in the catch per boat. Some of them deduce from the
figures that the beds have recovered their productiveness ; others maintain that they
prove that the beds were not depleted; while some even go so far as to assert that
it is impossible to over-fish grounds of such extent with the number of vessels which
have at any time been at work in Torres Strait. Admitting that a larger number
of ves-els will cover a larger area in their quest of shell, and may consequently be
expected to obtain a larger aggregate quantity, it may be regarded as axiomatic
that a lesser number working on a given area will secure a larger individual catch.
Yet the ollicial figures show that the catch per boat dwindled from 5 tons 17 cwt.
I qr, in 1891 to 2 tons 4 cwt. in 1994 —the year before the departure of nearly
one-half of the pump diving vessels to the Aroe Islands introduced a disturbing
factor into the statistics. Some years during the decade under review the figures
fluctuated slightly, hut the general trend was downward. Those who support
the view that the beds are as prolific as ever attach undue importance to slight
variations from one year to another in the average catch per boat, and disregard
altogether the undeniable fact that the total quantity of shell raised has been
steadily diminishing, whether the number of vessels at work has been larger or
smaller. A comparison of tbe figures for the years 1891 and 1906 is most interesting
and instructive in this connection. In the former year, with 126 vessels, the gross
take of shell was 769 tons, or an average per boat of 6 tons 2 cwt. In 1906,
with 125 vessels, the gross take was only 144 tons —an average per boat of 3 tons
II cwt —little more than one-half the gross yield and average per boat obtained
firtoen years earlier with only one more vessel. Further comment is unnecessary,
especially in the light of the results for the intervening years Another plea
advanced by those who urge that there has been no depletion of the beds is that,
in particular years, unfavourable weather conditions have prevented continuous
work, and have prejudicially affected the take; but it can hardly be contended
that this reason can have operated, year after year, for a whole decade.
CAUSES OF DEPLETION.
Despite the extent of the fishing-grounds, it is not impossible that valuable
patches of shell may so far have escaped notice. But it is unquestionable that it is not
so easy to obtain shell now as it was in former years, and that the shell which is picked
tip is of smaller size and lighter weight —a clear indication that it is of comparatively
recent growth. How long it takes shell to mature is an open question, and only
scientific observation extending over a series of years can supply reliable information

26- Summary
of causes.


on this point. Among the causes which, in our opinion, have led to the present
depression in the industry by reason of the scarcity of shell, as distinguished from a
lower market price for the product in the world’s markets, are—
(l) Disregard of the possibility of the beds becoming exhausted —a
disregard largely due to the belief that the supply was inexhaustible,
and also to the natural and, perhaps, laudable desire of pearl-shellers
to raise as much shell as possible in the shortest space of time;
(2) The introduction of floating stations, by means of which the work
of the shelling vessels was concentrated and they were kept on the
grounds as long as payable quantities of shell were procurable ;
(3) An excessive number of vessels;
(4) The introduction of Asiatic divers ;
(5) The absence of any definite scheme for the periodic closure of the
fishing-grounds in whole or in part; and
(6) The reduction in the size of exportable shell from 6 inches to 5 inches,
nacre measurement.
(I) and (2) Regarding the first and second of the foregoing causes, it is
unnecessary to add anything to what has been already said.
e (3) Excessive Number of Vessels. —Taking into consideration the supply of
shell, we are strongly of opinion that the number of vessels working was, for many
years, excessive, and that the recent temporary limitation of licenses, pending inquiry,
was both necessary and justifiable.
(4) Introduction of Asiatic Dicers. —The Asiatic divers now engaged in the
industry have not displayed the least concern about the future productiveness of the
beds. They have raised every shell available, their operations having been conducted
on the same principle that they would have adopted if they had been working a gold
mine, without regard to the vital difference between a gold mine and a pearl-shell
fishery—that, while gold is not capable of reproduction, the oyster is, and that it is
prudent to leave a supply of spatting shell to ensure the permanency of the industry
and its future prosperity.
(5) The Absence of a Definite Scheme for the Periodic Closure of the Fishing-
grounds.—The pearl-shell fisheries of Australia differ from some of those in other parts
of the world, in that they are not periodically closed for breeding purposes. '1 he latest
official reports to hand from Western Australia reveal a state of affairs very similar
to that with which we have to deal in Queensland. The take of shell has fallen off,
and the inspectors of fisheries are urging upon their Government the necessity for
State interference.
i The fisheries in the Gulf of Manaar, belonging to India and Ceylon, on the
( other hand, are not only closed during certain months in each year, hut the beds are
only opened in sections, certain areas being thrown open to fishing, while others are
closed altogether. Before the commencement of the fishing season, timely notice is
given of the areas on which fishing is to be conducted, and the number of boats to
work thereon is also prescribed by Government regulation. The anticipated supply
of shell on the beds is advertised, the quantity being estimated by Government
inspectors after careful inspection of the areas. But this system w r as only
adopted after the beds had become denuded owing to their having been worked in the
same unregulated and unscientific manner as the fishery in Torres Strait. To such
a low ebb had the Indian and Ceylon fisheries fallen that it was found necessary to
close them completely for a long term of years. The process of restocking was
slow. While the beds were closed, a thorough system of Government inspection,
control, and cultivation was initiated, and the results have fully justified such
parental action on the part of the authorities. The output is now regular, or liable
to slight fluctuations only, which are chiefly due to the weather conditions, and
every portion of the fishing-grounds is given a periodical rest, in turn, with the object
of maintaining a steady supply.
(0) Deduction in the Size of Exportable Shell. —In response to a request
from some of those connected with the Queensland industry in the year 1890,
and as a means of making it more profitable, legislation was passed in the
Parliamentary session of that year reducing the nacre measurement of exportable
shell from 6 inches to 6 inches, although the larger size had been fixed

after being recommended by Mr. Saville Kent in 1889 as the most appropriate size
from both the scientific and the commercial points of view. In 1897 the largest
quantity of shell on record was exported, and during each of the next three years
the take, although not quite equal to that of 1897, was very little less. These
augmented returns, it is fair to assume, were largely owing to the divers being
permitted to gather shell between 5 inches and 6 inches in nacre diameter.
Scientific investigation, extending, it may he, over several years, can alone throw
light upon the growth and habits of the pearl-oyster. If it he true that the oyster
begins to throw off spat about the time it reaches the size at which its exportation
is noiv permitted, the raising of such shell cannot fail to have a marked effect on
the number of oysters produced, and the supply of pearl-shell must, perforce, continue
to diminish. Mr. Tosh, in an official report, dated 9th February, 1901, supports
this view, and strongly favours a return to the 6-inch limit; Mr. Face, on the other
hand, in a report appended to the Report of the Government Resident for 1898,
favours the 5-inch limit on the ground that the oyster begins to produce spat when it
is 3 inches in diameter. Another point which must not he overlooked in this connection
is that the weight of a 5-inch shell as compared with that of a 6-inch shell is
approximately in the ratio of 1 to 2, and, consequently, it is necessary to raise twice
as many bivalves of 5-inch nacre measurement as of 6 inches in diameter to give
the same weight of shell, and this constitutes an additional drain upon the resources
of the fishirur-frrounds.
d O
NATURAL PHENOMENA WHICH TEND TO ARREST DEPLETION.
The exhaustion of the beds would have been more rapid and complete hut for
the protection afforded by certain natural phenomena. The inshore and shallow
beds have been protected by strong currents, turbid water, and occasional heavy
weather, all of which interfere with continuous and successful diving in these waters.
In the deep-water areas, strong currents, the inability of divers to remain long at the
bottom, and the liability to fatal accidents, are all valuable protective agencies.
It may be remarked, however, that even liability to accident has not proved, a
complete deterrent to diving on these grounds, proof of which is to be found in the
heavy death roll of divers working at Darnley and Mount Adolphus. On, the Old
Ground, in addition to strong tides and turbid water, the chances of interruption
from heavy weather are greater than on other grounds. Protection is also afforded
by marine growths, especially long grassy weeds, which prevent divers readily seeing
the shell on the sea bottom. These weeds reach maturitv towards the end of the
*
year, disappearing on the approach of the north-west monsoon between November
and January, and leaving the bottom comparatively clear for some months.
SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE BEST MEANS FOR ARRESTING DEPLETION.
As Ave are of opinion that the beds have been depleted, it becomes necessary
to suggest measures for replenishing the supplies of shell, and for ensuring that, as
far as possible, in the future the supply shall be equal to the demand, and that only
shell of mature groAvth shall be raised.
The remedial measures which we recommend divide themselves into two
general categories—Prohibitory or Negative, and Propagatory or Positive.
Under the category of prohibitory remedies, Ave include —
(1) Limitation of the number of boat and divers’ licenses, with a
consequent limitation of the number of vessels belonging to individual
OAvncrs;
(2) The prohibition of floating stations;
(3) The permanent closure of the dcep-Avater areas in the vicinity of
Darnley and Mount Adolphus Islands ;
(!) The closing of defined areas for a period of years, or, alternatively,
the closure of all grounds, with the exception of the Old Ground,
for a certain prescribed period in each year;
(5) The rigid enforcement of closure by an effective patrol, backed up
by the necessary legal enactments ; and
(6) The restoration of the size limit for exportable shell to 6 inches,
nacre measurement.
(1) (a) Limitation of the Number of Boat Licenses. —Official statistics
demonstrate that at no time Avere the grounds able to support more than 200 vessels

been in existence for forty years, it cannot be expected that new shelling areas
of any great extent will be discovered within the limits of Queensland territorial
waters, or that many patches of mature shell which have hitherto escaped notice will
assist in maintaining the output in years when there happens to be a falling olf in
shell of exportable size. The only supply upon which shelters can, with reason, rely
for future operations is the natural annual increase. Basing our opinion upon the
shell obtained in 1907, we believe that the beds are not capable at the present time,
without risk of further depletion, of supporting more than the 112 pump and 19
swimming diving vessels now licensed. But, in addition to these, licenses have been
approved for 10 pump diving boats since we commenced our inquiries, and there are
also 65 bcche-de-mer vessels, making a total of 206 vessels which arc legally entitled
to be used in collecting pearl-shell. We recognise that existing rights cannot be
disregarded, but we recommend that there shall be no increase in 'he number of
licensed vessels until investigation has shown that the supplies of shell have been
augmented. As there are only 165 licensed divers, manifestly many of the vessels
now licensed cannot work with pumps, and no injury is likely to be done to the
industry in the meantime. Assuming that our subsequent recommendation for three
distinct classes of boat licenses be adopted, we further recommend that no vessels
shall he licensed for pump diving unless equal in standard to those built within the
last three years. These two recommendations will ensure that for the next two years
—during which the industry will be in a state of transition —the beds will not be
over-fished; and we hope that by that time a considerable number of white diver-
cultivators will be helping to increase the supplies of shell.
As a complement to the restriction of the number of vessels allowed to be
licensed, a limit should be placed upon the number belonging to one sheller or firm
of shellers, so that no monopoly may be created, and to encourage men of small
means to take the place of what may he called capitalist-employers of labour. To
this end, we recommend that no individual or company desiring to come into the
industry in the future shall be permitted to obtain licenses for or acquire a beneficial
interest in more than five vessels, and that, so long as existing pearl-shellers
(whether individuals, firms, or companies) own more than five vessels, they shall
not be granted licenses for vessels intended to replace any which may become
unserviceable or which may be lost or sold; nor shall they be permitted to hold
or acquire a beneficial interest in any vessel or vessels licensed in the name of any
other person or persons. To prevent the evasion of this limitation, we recommend
that the members of a firm or comjiany shall not be allowed to obtain, in the
aggregate, more than five licenses.
That a system of small ownership is not likely to be detrimental to the
industry is demonstrated by the state of affairs in Western Australia, as revealed by
the latest official data to hand from that State. According to the report of the Chief
Inspector of Fisheries for last year, the export of shell in 1906 was 1,176 tons, the
produce of 330 luggers.
These vessels were divided among individual owners in the following
proportions;—

In the same year (1906) the total output of shell in Queensland was only
444 tons. The Sub-Collector of Customs at Thursday Island has kindly supplied us
with the following particulars regarding the number of owners and vessels in that
year
We have recommended 5 as the maximum number of licenses to he issued to
any individual or firm in the future. Dividing the foregoing lists into two classes—
those owning 5 vessels or under, and those owning more than s—we find a marked
difference between the two States—■

Owners. Boats. Average per Owner.
Western Australia ... ... 11l ... 330 ... 3
Queensland ... ... 36 ... 185 ... 6
The disproportion disclosed by the foregoing statistics is still more striking
if we exclude from the comparison swimming diving boats—a class which we
believe either does not exist at all in Western Australia or hut to a very
small degree. Another reason why these vessels may fairly he omitted from any
comparison is that a large proportion arc owned and worked exclusively by Torres
Strait Islanders, whilst several arc the property of the Papuan Industries, Limited,
and are worked largely for the benefit of the natives of Torres Strait and not for
the profit solely of the company owning them. Taking pump diving alone, Queensland
had not a single owner of 6 vessels or under, the minimum being 9, and the average
number per owner over 18, as against the Western Australian average of 3. It can
hardly he said that the year’s operations in Queensland were more successful than
those in the Western fishery, with its smaller class of proprietorship ; and there can
he little question as to the more advantageous system of ownership from the national
point of view.
{p) Limitation of the Number of Divers’ Licenses. — The limitation of the
number of divers’ licenses follows as a necessary corollary to a limitation of the
number of boat licenses. As a first step in this direction, we recommend that no
licenses be issued to aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands of the Pacific,
not now holding divers’ licenses. But, for the protection of owners, and to obviate a
stoppage of work through their inability to replace divers in the event of illness.


.accident, or other contingency, it is essential that a sufficient reserve of divers should
he available. We, therefore, recommend that the number of divers’ licenses issued
to Europeans during a period of five years commencing on Ist January, 1909,
not exceed the number of vessels licensed for pump diving by more than 25 per
centum. The question of the employment to he provided for surplus white divers
when not engaged in the boats Avill be dealt with under the heading of “ AA bite
Divers.”
It was suggested by several witnesses that the license for the vessel should
confer on the licensee the right to employ a diver, who should not be required to
take out a personal license. We do not favour this proposition. Under certain
conceivable circumstances, it might he made to operate to the detriment both of the
State as the owner of the fishery, and of the diver. Incenses arc necessary, not as a
means of raising revenue, but to enable the State to regulate and control the industry
and those engaged in it. The licensing system exists in connection with other
industries which exploit the national wealth; and it seems to us to be as necessary
and desirable that a diver should be required to take out a license as a fisherman in
Moreton Bay or a timber-getter, or that a miner should be required to take out a
miner’s right. So far from favouring the abolition of divers’ licenses, we believe
that it would be better if the principle were extended, and all employees in pearl-
shelling and beche-de-mer vessels —other than natives of the mainland and of the
Torres Strait Islands who are working in native-owned boats —wore obliged to bike
out licenses. If this be done, a merely nominal fee, if any, should be charged.
(2) Prohibition of Floating Stations. —Pearl-shellers themselves recognise
that the floating-station system, in spite of its advantages from the point of view of
the efficient and economic working of their fleets, is prejudicial to ihe permanency
of the beds and the best interests of the industry. Within the last three years they
have voluntarily abandoned it in favour of the shore-station system, although, in all
probability, for quite a different reason than the foregoing; and we recommend that
legislation be passed rendering any reintroduction of the floating-station system
impossible. As a means to this end, we recommend that no vessel of a gross
tonnage exceeding 25 tons be licensed for employment in the pearl-shell fishery.
(3) The Permanent Closure of the Deep-water Areas in the Vicinity of
Darnley and Mount Adolphus Islands. —Our reasons for recommending the
permanent closure of these areas are twofold. In the first place, it is desirable, upon
humane grounds, to prohibit diving in waters so deep that the life and health of the
divers are seriously jeopardised. In the second place, it is desirable to close areas
which Avill provide a permanent supply of spat for other shelling-grounds in Torres
Strait, and it is the common opinion that the spat from these tAvo deep-Avater areas
is disseminated throughout Torres Strait.
(4) The Closure of Defined Areas fur Certain Periods. —The Avaters of
Endeavour Strait, the channels in and around the Prince of Wales group, the'Avaters
betAveen those islands and the Banks group —Badu, Mua, and A 1 abuiag- -and the
greater part of the Orman and Warrior Reef areas, have been easily Avorkable at all
times. Owing to their comparative tranquillity and accessibility, vessels have been
in the habit of taking refuge on those grounds, and Avorking there Avhen
compelled, by stress of Avcathcr or the condition of the sea bottom, temporarily
to abandon the Old Ground and the beds in the Gulf of Carpentaria off Vrilya Point.
A certain number of the smaller pump vessels and the swimming diving boats
have regularly fished in these smoother Avaters; and the result of this continuous
fishing over a long series of years has been that some of the areas have been
practically exhausted, Avhile on others—such as the Orman and Warrior Heel’s—the
supply of shell has been greatly reduced. We have it in evidence that these beds
possess great recuperating powers, oAving to the nature of the bottom, and that the
shell is of very fine quality. Their central position renders them peculiarly
attractive to shellers, and this very attractiveness furnishes a reason Avhy the beds
should be given a period of enforced rest. To close the Avhole of the shellin"--
grounds at one time Avould have too disturbing an efi'ect on the industry, Avhereas If
they are closed in rotation, Avork can always be carried on upon those remainin'*
open. As to the best season for closure, its duration, and the order of rotation a
decisive opinion can only be given by some qualified scientific authority after careful
examination of the beds. .

(5) Enforcement of Closure. —ln the past, areas have been proclaimed
closed ; hut the closure has been inellective because of the lack of control, together
with defects in the law which render it extremely difficult to obtain convictions
for trespass.
With a view to giving the grounds that complete rest which is absolutely
essential to recovery, it will ho necessary to provide a vessel or vessels for patrol
purposes, working from some central station or stations adjacent to the closed areas.
Wo recommend that the officers in charge of such vessels he endowed with plenary
powers to enable them to deal with poachers and trespassers, and that legislation
he passed making it easier to obtain convictions.
We do not recommend the closure of the Old Ground or any part thereof for
the following reasons: —
(1) It is, for the most part, sufficiently protected by natural agencies.
(2) Unless at a cost altogether disproportioned to the results, it is
impossible to establish an effective patrol of a fishing-ground
extending for GO geograph'cal miles to the westward, Avith an
approximate Avidth from south to north of about 90 miles.
If the size limit of exportable shell he increased to 0 inches, the amount of
spatting shell between 5 inches and G inches in nacre diameter combined Avith the
protection afforded by the suggested limitation in the munher of A'ossols Avill enable
the productiveness of the Old Ground to he maintained, if not considerably increased.
(G) lies!oration q) the Size Limit for Exportable Shell to Six Inches. —The
value of this remedial measure has already been fully dealt with, and there is no need
to repeat the reasons given for recommending a return to the former limit of 0
inches. We Avould only add that we believe the reduction to 5 inches has been one
of the main factors in bringing about the present depletion of the beds all over
Torres Strait, since it has not only allowed a larger quantity of shell to he raised, but
has reduced the number of oysters of a reproductive age.
As a means for arresting depletion Ave have placed in the second category
Artificial Cultivation. This brings us to the second branch of our inquiries—namely,
11. THE SCIENTIFIC CULTIVATION OF PEARL-SHELL OYSTERS AND
THE'PROBABILITIES OF SUCCESS IN THAT DIRECTION.
It is characteristic of all our primary industries that in the earlier stages of
their history the Avork of production has been left to Nature: man’s part has been
confined to gathering and marketing the harvest. Later, owing to the stress of
competition and in many cases the inadequacy of supply to demand, man has been
compelled to deA r ote his thought and energy to devising means for assisting Nature
in her Avork.
Up to the present the pearl-sheller has simply gathered shell Avhich has hej
produced solely by Nature. True, his appliances and methods have improvet
Larger vessels and diving gear haA'e succeeded to small boats and naked divers.
But no leal or sustained effort has yet been made to assist the beds to produce larger
quantities of shell or to improve the quality of the shell by a process of culti\ation.
The result of forty years’ Avork on these lines is set forth in the preceding
pages—depleted supplies, increased cost of Avorking, and a corresponding falling off
in the remuneration of the sheller, Avhether employer or Avorker. The industry
has now reached a stage Avhen its preservation and continuance as a Avcalth producer
depend very largely upon man’s intellect being called to the aid of Nature.
Far more of the diver’s time is occupied in searching for shell than in raising
it Avhen found. For days he may Avalk over the bottom of the sea at depths so great
as to cause Avonder at the risks he incurs in seeking shell, and he may find none or
hut few to reAvard him.
Divers may safely Avork at depths of from 15 to 20 fathoms. It is hard for
one Avithout experience to realise what this means. Reduce these depths to feet,
and try to fancy Avhat it must be to spend day after day from 90 to 120 feet’ below
the surface, shut up in a diving dress, dependent upon the Avatchfulness of a
tender above for an adequate supply of air to save one from being crushed by

the superincumbent weight of water, and with no company hut the strange
denizens of the deep. Think, too, of having to spend weeks together within the
narrow confines of a small lugger on a restless sea with no associates hut men of
lower civilisation and alien tongue. If the industry is to he preserved at all; if it
is to he made profitable to those engaged in it; if it is to provide employment for
men of our own race and type, instead of falling into the hands of aliens or of
human derelicts—men despised and apart —men to whom home life is denied except
for brief periods at rare intervals—men whose lot is one of hardship and continual
risk of sudden death or of a living death from diver’s paralysis—the industry and
the system of conducting it must he revolutionised. The seeker must be replaced
by the cultivator. The fishery must be carried on by men breeding and growing
the pearl-oy r ster. Instead of diving for shell in the deep watex*s of the open sea,
the oyster must he cultivated on the shallow hanks and reefs adjacent to the
islands which dot the surface of Torres Strait, On these islands “shell-growers”
can live in comfort and become permanent settlers. The deep-sea fishery will not
cease, hut it will become an adjunct to the cultivation area. Shell will still he
obtained from the present fishing-grounds, and the immature shell found by the
diver will be transferred to the shallow waters, and remain there until of a size
suitable for sale when the market conditions are favourable, in the meantime
producing spat to provide for the needs of future years.
Under present conditions shell, when once raised, must be sold to secure a
speedy return for the outlay incurred in finding and raising it. Attempts have been
made to regulate prices in London—where practically the whole of the world’s
output is sold —by a combination of shelters connected with the industry in
Australia and the Aroe Islands; but, in spite of all efforts in this direction, prices
have fluctuated, and the sheller has been, more or less, at the mercy of the buyer.
If shell can be grown on cultivation areas in shallow" waters —where it w r as found
in large quantities in the early days of the fishery—it can be left at the bottom
until prices warrant its being raised. While it remains on the ground, instead of
deteriorating it is really appreciating in value. Indeed, there is no reason why the
sy r stem of sale should not in course of time be completely" altered, and a grow'er
receive an order for so many tons of shell of a certain size and quality, to bo filled
in the same w r ay as a grower of fruit fills an order for a certain quantity of
fruit of a specified standard. Viewed from the commercial standpoint, cultivation
Avill give the pcarl-sheller more control over the market price of liis product than
he now possesses. He will not suffer to the same extent from sudden vicissitudes
of the market by being obliged to take whatever price is offered or else hold over
shell, the raising and marketing of which have already entailed heavy expense.
He will have in his own hands the improving of the quality and weight of his
shell, and he will also obtain all pearls that may be produced on his leasehold. In
a w'ord, the industry will largely cease to be speculative, and become one in which
the quantity and the selling price of the product can be more or less regulated.
• In addition to these advantages, a system of cultivation has others which,
fyom the national point of view", are of even greater importance. At the
present time, with the exception of the owmers of the pearling vessels and those
people on shore wdio arc indirectly dependent upon the fishery, no w r hite men
benefit from it. The employees are exclusively coloured, and largely alien.
Hiving is regarded as so precarious and hazardous an occupation that life assurance
companies refuse to insure divers. Men of our own or kindred race arc prepared,
as they" have ever been, to engage in any calling so long as it is sufficiently
remunerative; but all the evidence taken by us goes to show" that, under present
conditions, that attraction is lacking in Torres Strait, with the result that diving
has passed entirely into the hands of coloured aliens. With cultivation, better
returns will be assured; the life of the pearl-sheller will be less monotonous, the
work less arduous, and the element of risk almost completely" eliminated. As all
operations will be conducted from tl\e shore, men will be able to establish homes,
and there is likely to be a permanent wdiite population in Torres Strait, instead
of a few white men whose one desire is to make enough money" in a few- years
to enable them to retire to enjoy it in more congenial surroundings, and a largo
number of aliens w r ho are undesirable as citizens, with whom Australians can have
but little sympathy", and in whom they can place but little trust.

a We have been somewhat at a disadvantage in arriving at a conclusion as to
,i- the possible success of cultivation, owing to the comparative lack of scientific data
a( and of information regarding the few spasmodic attempts which have been made in
11. the past.
r Mr. Savillc Kent was employed by the Queensland Government in 1889, and
again in 1905, to report upon the condition of the Torres Strait fishery and to advise
as to the best means of carrying it on, and he reported strongly in favour of the
prospects of successful cultivation. Later on, Mr. Tosh was employed as a Marine
biologist, and was stationed at Thursday Island; but he was not furnished with the
equipment necessary for prosecuting his researches or for making experiments in
cultivation, Financial stress led to the abandonment of the Avork first of Mr. Kent
and afterwards of Mr. Tosh, and the fetate derived no benefit from their labours
beyond a I'cav official reports of a more or less tentative and speculative character;
but, had the Avork begun in 1889 been continued to the present time, it is unlikely
that there would have been any necessity for appointing this Commission.
Mr. dames Clark informed us that his firm spent about £l,OOO in laying
down 100,00;) shell in Friday Island Passage and in attempting to cultivate the
k pearl-oyster from spat. As Mr. Clark has practically declined to supply us with
any data regarding the work done by Mr. Pace, the scientist employed by his
firm, avc are dependent upon the general statement made by Messrs. Clark and
Munro Avhcu giving evidence that the experiment was a failure; but, in a report*
submitted to the Government • Resident at Thursday Island, Mr. Pace exjn’essed
the opinion that the pearl-oyster could be cultivated successfully, and that the
future of the industry depended upon the adoption of this moans of propagation.
Mr. Saville Kent has shoAvn his belief in the possibilities of cultivation by form-
ing and undertaking the management of a company Avhich is noAV engaged in this
1 Avork, coupled Avith the artificial production of pearls, on a leasehold in Albany Pass,
, opposite Somerset. We had not the pleasure of seeing Mr. Saville Kent himself ; but
AA r e are informed that he is quite satisfied Avith the results of five mouths’ work, Avhile
his assistant manager, Mr. Bertie Jardine, is most sanguine as to the future. We are
indebted to Mr. Jardine for the opportunity of inspecting the spat-catching apparatus
used by the company, and the shell in course of treatment for pearl production,
as Avell as for a lucid description of the method of AA r orking. While expressing no
opinion as to the sanguine expect itions entertained by Mr. Jardine, Avbat Ave saw at
Albany Island AA r arrants us in believing that success is likely to crown the efforts
of Mr. Kent’s company in the future, so far as the catchment of spat and the
protection of the young oysters from their numerous foes are concerned, and also in
coming to the conclusion that cultivation in shalloAV AAaters Avill become the system of
the future. Mr. Jardine informed us that he believed his company Avould be disposed
to assist others desirous of engaging in cultivation by giving them information
regarding the cultivation branch of their Avork. With regard to the artificial
production of pearls, the process is a business secret, and, as the company look to
pearls for their profit more than to pearl-shell, it is natural that they should decline
to disclose to others their method of pearl production.
In connection AA r ith the production of pearls, Mr. Jardine shoAved us tAvo
t bivalves, and stated that in one Ave should find a pearl attached to the shell, and
in the other a pearl growing in the flesh of the dyster. On his partially opening
these tAvo oysters, AA r e suav foreign substances Avhich ansAvered his description in each
case, but, OAA’ing to the obscure situation of the groAvths and the declining light of
the afternoon, it Avas not possible to say Avith definiteness that they Avere of nacreous
formation. But, to support his assertion that it is possible by Mr. Saville Kent’s
process to produce pearls, Mr. Jardine shoAved us one shell and tAA r o photographs of
shell containing Avell-defincd pearls and pearl-blisters Avhich he informed us Avere
the groAvth of five months. The photographs referred to are reproduced as Appendix
XIX. at the end of the evidence. It is Avell knoAvn that pearls are artificially
produced in other parts of the world in several species of mollusc, and there seems
to be no reason Avhy their production should not become a profitable undertaking in
Queensland AAaters.

However willing Messrs. Kent and Jardine may be to assist others, naturally
their first concern is the success of their own company. If cultivation is to
become general in the near future, we are of opinion that it is the duty of the State
to demonstrate that it is possible and profitable. The expense of conducting
experiments is likely to prove too heavy for individuals to incur, besides which it is
only reasonable that marine industries should be helped in the same way as agriculture
and dairying are being assisted by the work of State farms. The Government might
Very well undertake the work of experimenting, recouping themselves to some
extent by selling to the holders of cultivation areas young oysters propagated at a
Government hatchery.
The first step in the direction of proving whether or not cultivation can be
successfully and profitably undertaken is for the Government to secure the services
of a thoroughly competent Marine Biologist, to be stationed in Torres Strait. The
fisheries of India and Ceylon have taken a new lease of life since they were placed
under scientific control; and we regard the appointment of a Marine Biologist as the
first and most important essential to the rehabilitation of the Queensland fishery. For
this position a man of the highest attainments in marine biology u ill be required, and,
if possible, he should have had some previous experience among pearl-oysters. To
enable him successfully to prosecute his researches, he should be furnished with
every requisite, including a sufficient staff, a well-equipped laboratory, an area upon
which .to conduct practical experiments in cultivation, and a vessel or ves-els for
the collection of bivalves to stock his propagation, area. He should be amm
capable of acting as director or comptroller of the fishery, of directing, or at least
of advising, private cultivators, of observing and reporting upon the condition of
the pearl-shell beds and the beche-de-rner grounds, of supervising the training school
for white divers hereinafter referred to and the operations on the Government
cultivation area, and generally, as Chief Inspector or Director, of supervising and
controlling the administration of the industry.
"With a view to encouraging the extension of the work of cultivation, we
recommend that a School of Marine Biology on lines similar to those adopted in
the Agricultural College at Gatton and the Charters Towers School of Mines he
'established for the training of students under the direction of the Marine Biologist.
O . O
The probable expense and the uncertainty of success have hitherto deterred
private individuals from engaging in cultivation. The only experiment of any extent
made so far was undertaken by a wealthy company. A few crude efforts have been
made in the way of transplanting a small number of bivalves; hut the would-be
cultivators have been greatly hampered and discouraged by the absence of effective
protection for the shell so transplanted. In every instance that has come under our
notice the complaint has been that the shell was stolen by poachers, who, even when
detected, were able to escape conviction by means of legal technicalities.
When the Government shall have successfully demonstrated that it is possible
to propagate and grow the pearl-oyster on shallow banks inshore, applications for
cultivation areas are sure to bo made. Indeed, we are certain that such- areas will
be generally applied for as soon as it is known that the Government intend to engage
in work of this nature. To provide for the demand, it will be necessary to reserve
portions of the foreshores in Torres Strait and along the east coast as far south as
Cape Melville, and to divide them and the bordering waters into suitable areas.
Pending the passage of amending legislation and the appointment of a Marine
Biologist, we recommend that no cultivation leases be granted under the existing
regulations,
To prevent the aggregation of large marine estates, it will be necessiry to
ascertain and fix the area most suitable for cultivation leaseholds—a monopoly in
shell-bearing ground being as undesirable as a monopoly on shore.
The present term- of lease for an occupation license—namely, seven years —is
insufficient to encourage individuals to enter on the work of cultivation; and we
are of opinion that the leases should have a duration of at least twenty-one years.
Mr. Saville Kent, in his report of 27th December, ISS9, asserts that shell of
Bor 9 inches, nacre measurement, can be produced from spat in three years. '1 his
statement is corroborated bv Mr. Frank Jardine, a gentleman with thirty-six years’

experience of tlie pearl-slielling industry, both in Queensland and in other parts of
the world. A number of experienced shellers, on the other hand, deny that the
growth is anything like so rapid; and it is only possible to arrive at the truth by the
most careful and trained observation, extending, perhaps, over several years. At
whatever rate the bivalve may grow, it will certainly be a matter of several years
before any return can be expected from a cultivation area.
To induce men of limited means to take up cultivation areas, it will be
necessary to give them liberal terms in the earlier years of their enterprise, A
merely nominal rental for the shore homestead areas might be charged. The length
of time that must elapse after cultivation is entered upon before any returri can be
expected, besides being a reason for granting a long lease, is also a reason for
suggesting that, for the first few years after'areas are leased, they should be free of
any charge by way of rental except a small rent for the shore homestead. "When
marketable shell can he produced, a royalty of so much per ton might be imposed
upon the quantity of shell exported.
To give the fullest measure of protection to cultivators, we recommend the
adoption of provisions similar to those in force in connection with edible-oyster beds
in [Southern Queensland. The onus of proof should lie on any person found
tin spassing upon any cultivation area with shell or pearls or apparatus for raising
shell in his possession.
The spat from the molluscs on cultivation areas can never be entirely
confined to such areas ; and it may be expected that the beds in the adjacent deep
3 waters, and to a lesser degree beds at considerable distances, will be to some extent
replenished and kept stocked from this source.
We do not for one moment imagine that, when cultivation becomes a
1 commercial success, diving in open waters will cease. We assume that it will be
j necessary to permit undersized shell to be raised from these waters and transplanted
to cultivation areas. This will afford employment to a number of men and boats.
There will always be men prepared to seek for pearl-shell in the open waters;
and probably many of those who take up cultivation areas will combine the work
of cultivation with the present method of fishing. Cultivation will really be in
addition to, and not altogether in substitution of, shelling as at present conducted.
Besides being- a great improvement upon the present method of working, we believe
that its greatest recommendation is that cultivation will lead more certainly than
anything else to the attainment of the desideratum alluded to in the third division
of the objects laid down in our Commission —namely,
111. THE POSSIBILITIES OE ENCOURAGING WHITE DIVERS WITH
A VIEW TO THEIR GRADUAL SUBSTTIUTION EOR ALIENS IN
THAT CAPACITY.
It is the natural and laudable aspiration of Australians to conserve their
country and their industries for men of their own race. At a time when the
nations of the East are awaking and are looking around for openings for
the settlement of their surplus millions, it behoves Australians, with their vast
territory and their handful of people, three-fourths of whom are situated in the
south-eastern comer of the continent, to see to it that no Asiatic Power is allowed
to obtain a foothold on their shores. Taking, in conjunction, Tables A and Kin the
last report of the Government Resident, the total population of the Prince of Wales
group at the close of 1207 Avas 2,775, of ay bom 2,387 Avere adults and 388 children.
Europeans numbered 053, Asiatics 1,085 (no less than 701 of them being Japanese),
94 Pacific Islanders, 152 of mixed races, 18,5 aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders,
and 302 Papuans. A further disquieting feature is to be found in the fact that of
the (550 Europeans no less than 231 Avere children Deducting these and the garrison
from the number of Avhites, it leaves about 300 adult Avliites connected with or
dependent on the fishery as against about 1,000 adult Asiatics, Steps should be
taken to reduce this vast preponderance of aliens, and to have this outpost guarded
by a hardy population of loyal and patriotic Australians.

ih pearl-
shell
industry.
But, quite apart from the national and defence aspect, it is greatly to be desired,
from the commercial standpoint, that the pearl-sliell fishery shall be conserved as
( far as possible for our own race. The falling off in the take of shell for some
years past did not seem to us sufficient of itself to account for the general
depression in trade and the air of despondency visible at Thursday Island. It soon
became apparent that one of the chief causes for the existing depression is to he
found in the fact that practically the whole of the profits of the industry, apart
from those made by the boat owners, are going to Asiatics. These men have to
pay for the provisioning of the boats in which they are engaged out of their “ lay,”
and, quite naturally, they have a predilection for their national foods and for
obtaining them through their fellow-countrymen. In addition to this, a creat
many of those now engaged in the fishery are serving under indentures for three
years, and have to be returned to their homes at the end of their agreements, and
quite naturally they send or take their savings to their own countries.
Through the courtesy of the Postal Department and of the Queensland
National Bank and the Bank of North Queensland, the only two banks with branches
■ in Thursday Island, we obtained particulars regarding the way in which the earnings
of the workers in the industry are being sent abroad instead of being circulated in
Queensland. The total dec'ared value of all produce exported from Thursday I sland
during 1007 was £102,615, and tie* amount sent to China and Japan last year alone,
through the post office and the two banks referred to, w;is no less than £21,123. In
addition to this, we have reason to belie > e that several thousands of pounds per annum
leave Queensland in the shape of pearls, all of which, under the present system of
working, go to the divers, while a large quantity of gold coin is taken away by time-
expired men'. We were given to understand that a certain proportion of the amount
sent to China represents trading accounts ; but we can see no reason why the trade in
this industry should not follow the flag in accordance with the sentiment pervading
the rest of Australia. If this money were retained and circulated in Thursday
Island, there would be a different story to tell of the condition of business, and it is
to he hoped that something will be done speedily to terminate this lamentable state
of affairs.
i The patient industry, the uncomjdaining endurance of hardships, and the
' generally law-abiding character of these Asiatic sojourners in our midst arc admitted,
tin many respects they are not undesirable residents ; hut in no country in the world
• outside the British Dominions is any primary industry allowed to be monopolised
by a race of aliens.
1 White men practically refuse to associate on equal terms with men of
colour. Since the departure of the Pacific Islanders, the sugar industry has ceased
to be regarded as one to be shunned by white men; and if the men who now
monopolise the pearl-shell fishery, who are greatly superior to the Pacific Islander
in civilisation, were to disappear, the prejudice against that industry would soon
pass away in like manner.
For “ White Divers” in the heading to this portion of our report we would
prefer to substitute “ W hite Labour,” as we believe that the propagation of the pearl-
oyster by means of cultivation in shallow waters, besides providing employment for
white divers (under conditions very much easier than are possible at present), ■will
also lead to the employment of a large number of white men in various forms of
work incidental.to an industry conducted on such lines.
A pearling-boat is manned by—
(1) A diver who is in charge of the boat, descends to the bottom in
search of shell, and who, under the present system, retains all pearls,
and is paid a “lay” of £B2 10s. per ton on a catch of I< tons and
under, and £B7 10s. per ton on a catch of over t tons, out of which
he pays for the provisioning of the boat and all wages ;
(2) A tender, whose duty it is to attend to the diver and the diving gear,
take charge of the boat while the diver is under water, and who
is responsible for the safety of the diver when beneath the surface;

In some of the larger boats working in deep water, and which are manned by;
Japanese, two or even three divers are carried. Those, other than the diver in
charge, are known as “ spare divers.” They enable the work to he carried on
unremittingly. They descend in rotation, and afford the diver in charge the
necessary rest, without suspending the gathering of shell. The tender is paid from
<£4 to £t 10s. per month, and the wages of the crew range from £1 10s. to £2 12s. 6d.
per month, acc jrding to their experience and value as workers.
1 It was stated in evidence that in the seventies white divers earned as much as
£4OO or £5OO per annum, irrespective of what they made from pearls, the practice
at that time being to give them one-half the amount realised from pearls, which in
some cases were worth several hundreds of pounds. Such earnings were no doubt
exceptional, even in days when the shell lay thick on the bottom and was of the
finest quality. A great falling off has taken place since those palmy days. By
many Avitnesses the average earnings of the pre.'Cnt day Avere put doAvn at from
£lOO to £l5O per annum, exclusive of pearls. It is quite possible that a fortunate
diver may discover a pearl AA r orth £lOO or £5OO, hut such an occurrence is extremely
rare. There can he little certainty regarding the value of the output of pearls, as the
Japanese divers are remarkably reticent about their luck in this respect, hut several
pearl-shellers place the average A’alue at something like £5O per boat per annum.
But, as one man may make several hundred pounds a year from this source, and
many may make nothing at all, in any calculation as to the incomes of divers we
are compelled to confine ourselves to their earnings from shell. Two statements
shoAving an apportionment of profits between the owner and theddirerA r er Avere
submitted to the Commission by leading fleet owners—Messrs. BoAvden and Ilayne,
The president of the Japanese Club at Thursday Island, Mr. KashiAvagi, also sub-
mitted a statement shoAving the earnings of the divers under different sets of circum-
stances. The statements of Messrs. BoAvden and Ilayne, although based on different
catches per boat, displayed no material differences, the amounts set down for
provisions and Avages of creAV varying slightly. Both Avorked out the results on tAvo
bases —on the present or “ lay ” system, and on the Avages system AA T hich AA r as formerly
rnwogue. Under the “lay” system the diver is paid £B2 10s. per ton on a catch of 4
tons per annum or under, and £B7 10s. per ton for a catch in excess of 4 tons.
Under the AA T ages system the diver AA T as paid £25 per ton, irrespective of the size of the
catch. On the basis of a 4-ton catch, Mr. BoAvden shoAA r ed a profit to the OAvner, under
the “lay” system of £B2 10s. per ton, of £33, leaving £5O to the diver. Under the
Avages system of £25 per ton on the same catch, he shoAA r ed a profit to the OAvner of
£ll, leaving the diver £lOO. On the basis of a 4|-ton catch, Mr. Hayne, under the “lay”
system of 487 10s. per ton, shoAA r ed a profit to the OAvner of £23 15s. 3d. (to Avhich AA r e
think it fair to add the sum of £25 AA'hich Mr. Ilayne charges to management expenses),
the earnings of the diver being £9O 17s. Od. Under the Avages system, the profit to the
OAvner aaus slioavia to he £8 7s. 9d. (again we think it fair to add the sum of £25
charged for management expenses), aali list the diver’s share Avas set doAvn at £lO6 ss.
Mr. KashiAA r agi did not attempt to assess the OAvner’s profits. On the basis of
a catch of tons (that is, Avith a “ lay ”of £B2 10s, per ton), he put the diver’s
earnings for the year at £2l 17s. On a catch slightly over 4 tons (that is, Avith a
“lay” of £B7 1‘ s.), lie estimated the earnings of the diver at £62 9s. 6d. Under
the deep-AA’ater agreement, Avith shell at £BO a ton, he put the earnings of each
diver (it being customary to employ lavo and three divers in such AA'aters) at
£22 17s. 6d. Avith a catch of 7 tons, at £49 10s. lOd. Avith a catch of 8 tons, and at
£76 Is. 2d. Avith a catch of 9 tons. M hen asked, “ What is the largest amount
that you knoAv of that I.as been earned by a diver during the last year, including
pearls and everything r” Mr.- KashiAvagi replied, “ If a diver gets 6 tons he Avill
earn about £2OO, hut very fcAV get that.” The average catch per boat in 1907,
according to the report of the Government Resident, Avas 4 tons 4 CAvt. This may
he considerably exceeded in the larger and better-equipped boats, hut it is obvious
that, on the basis of the figures of the three gentlemen above referred to, AAdiich
may be taken to he fair averages, £2OO per annum is not likely to be realised by
the ordinary diver.
Jfi Karnings

dirers.


It is quite true that the diver gets his keep while at sea, over and above his
earnings from shell. But the highest estimate just quoted—that of Mr. Hayne
t under the discarded wages system—gives the diver an annual net income of £lO6 55.,
equal to £8 17s. Id. per ironth. Compare this with the £8 per month, with keep
all the year round, paid to seamen on our coastal steamers, leaving out of
consideration altogether their overtime pay, the better accommodation, the easier
life, the congenial companionship, frequent change, and the time spent in port.
Under these circumstances, is it any wonder that the seaman —whose occupation
is most akin to that of the pearl-sheller—does not care to become a diver?
Having regard to the reported earnings of divers, the unattractiveness,
monotony, and severity of the life, the liability to accident and disease, an I (he
limited duration of the active working life of a diver, we are reluctantly compelled
to state that we are of opinion that white men are not likely readily to take the
place of the coloured divers who are now engaged in the industry, and to work as
mere employees, so long as present conditions continue. It is an easy matter, by
legislation, to decree that on and after a certain date no coloured alien shall he
granted a diver’s license; hut it is quite another matter to find white men to fill
the vacancies thus created. The conditions must be considerably improved before
such a change—desirable though it be—is likely to he consummated.
INDUCEMENTS TO WHITE MEN.
The question, then, is, How can the life he made sufficiently attractive and
remunerative ? Men capable of replacing the present Japanese divers would require
to earn at least £lBO a year, to he supplemented with a fair percentage of the value
of all pearls found by them. The gold miner of North Queensland earns more than
this, and his occupation is not so precarious as that of the diver for pearl-shell. On
the basis of Mr. Ilayne’s figures, a diver would require to raise about 5} tons of pearl-
shell to enable him to earn £lBO per annum. Such an average catch has not been
obtained since ] 897, and it can hardly he hoped for until the beds have recovered
their productiveness.
The figures given by Messrs. Hayne and Bowden seem to indicate that the
only hope of the industry becoming sufficiently remunerative to attract white men is
for them to obtain possession of the vessels and to work as masters. If they were to
do their own diving and secure for themselves the amount which now goes to the
boat owner, then, even on the basis of a catch of 4 tons 4 cwt. —the average for last
year—they would he in receipt of an income of more than £2OO per annum,
irrespective of anything they might realise from pearls, always provided that they
could manage the business as efficiently and economically as the present owners. It
is unlikely that working divers, who, in nearly every instance, will have had no
previous business training, can manage this part of the business as well as the
present fleet owners, and this is a direction in which Government aid might he invoked.
The main essential, however, is to place the white diver in the position of boat owner.
As the first step, we have coupled with our recommendation that the number of boats
shall he limited the recommendation that the maximum number of boats for the
future allowed to he licensed by individual owners or firms shall he five, the object
being to increase the number of boat owners as much as possible, and substitute small
diver-proprietorship for the present fleet system.
Schemes were submitted to us by Messrs. Model and Bowden whereby the
Government were to take an active part in bringing about a system of small owner-
ship.
Mr. Model's proposal {vile pp. 136 and 137 of the evidence) was that the
Government should purchase all vessels now licensed, reselling them to men of limited
means. The maximum expenditure involved in this purchase was computed by Mr.
Hodel at £50,600, and the object in view was gradually to replace the coloured divers
now employed by white men.
Mr. Bowden suggested the appointment by the Government of a Shellers’.
Advances Board, to acquire vessels now employed in the industry and hand t hem over
to suitable, competent, approved Europeans on payment of a cash deposit of
one-sixth of the purchase value of the vessels, the balance to he repaid in seven

equal instalments. As a necessary part of his scheme, Mr. Bowden suggested that
the shell raised by these vessels should be the property of the Board, to he shipped by
them to the Agent-General or some other agent in London for sale ; the Board to
advance to the purchaser “£] 25 per ton on the basis of Old Ground cleaned, unpacked
shell, delivered at Thursday Island; the minimum price to he £125, to be guaranteed
by the Government.” The details of the scheme will he found on pages 191 and
192 of the evidence.
To deal first with Mr. Model's scheme for a straightout purchase of the vessels
by the Government; At a time when those engaged in the industry are one and all
calling .for Government intervention to save it from ruin, we cannot conscientiously
recommend such a scheme to the consideration of the Government. It is quite true
that advances are made by the State to agriculturists and dairy farmers through
the agency of the Agricultural Bank. But there is no comparison between the
relative value to the State of those industries and the pearl-shell industry, nor
between the value of the security offered in the case of agriculturists and dairy
farmers and that available in the case of the pearl-shell fishery. Bor this reason
we cannot regard Mr. Model’s scheme as a sound business proposition, and no
scheme can he acceptable which does not hold out a fair prospect of success.
However much an industry may need assistance, it should not he expected that all
the risk should he borne by the general taxpayer and none by those calling for
assistance; and this would he the result if the present boat owners were bought out
and paid in cash by the Government.
Although Mr. Bowden’s scheme for the establishment of a Shellers’Advances
Board and the payment for the vessels by a new proprietary partly in cash and the
balance in yearly instalments has some commendable features, it is not one that we
feel justified in recommending. The class of white man most likely to he successful
as a small boat owner cum diver is the man with £300 or £400, and not the man
whose only capital is a pair of hands. A man with such a sum should be sufficient
security for the boat owner who wishes to dispose of his fleet, and the latter should
he prepared to conduct the sale himself without asking the Government to take the
risk.
Mr. Bowden’s suggestion that the Government should manage the selling
portion of the business and make advances against the prices to he received in London
is deserving of consideration, although the details might have to he modified very
considerably.
i A fundamental feature of Mr, Bowden’s scheme was the payment by the
Government of a bonus of £25 per ton up to 3 tons on shell procured and delivered
within a period of twelve months in the case of vessels worked by Avhite divers only;
and of £35 per ton up to 3 tons on shell delivered within a period of twelve months in
the case of vessels worked by white divers and tenders. Other witnesses advocated
the payment by the Government of bonuses ranging from £i5 to £100 per ton on
shell raised by white divers, if white divers are to be enabled to take the place of
coloured divers. Despite the growing tendency in Australia to ask for a bonus on
all kinds of products, we are of opinion that there are two great objections to a
bonus on shell raised by white divers.
In the case of sugar —which we take as a typical illustration of the operation of
the system —the bonus is paid on a necessary article of daily consumption. The present
production is consumed in Australia, and the bonus is therefore paid by the people
of the Commonwealth. Pearl-shell, on the other hand, is not a necessary of life,
and for the raw product there is no market in Australia.' Every ton raised in
Torres. Strait is shipped abroad and there manufactured. The price obtainable is
entirely beyond our control, and consequently no part of any bonus could be
recovered from the consumer. It would, therefore, constitute a drain upon the
general taxpayer with none of the compensating benefits which are supposed to be
associated with the bonus principle. In the next place, the payment of a bonus has
to be surrounded with precautions against fraud. In spite of safeguards, cases of
fraud with regard to the bonus on white-grown sugar have been discovered, and it
is not unreasonable to assume that others have remained undetected. If this can
occur on land, with all the possibilities of frequent inspection of growing crops,

which have to he registered beforehand and are subject to the daily oversight of
neighbours, the chances of fraud in the case of pearl-shell are greatly multiplied,
and this constitutes another objection to a bonus.
Having regard to the importance of Thursday Island as one of the gateways
of Australia, the question of settling a considerable European population in Torres
is of paramount importance to the Commonwealth, which may fairly be asked to
assist in rendering this portion of her territory less open to foreign invasion.
Owing to the exigencies of the weather, pearl-shelters have frequent spells of
enforced idleness; and, if our suggestion regarding the number of divers’ licenses be
adopted, there will generally be a number of divers disengaged. Australia aspires
to the creation of an Australian navy, manned exclusively by Australians. A T o more
suitable material for crews could be found in any part of the world than men
trained in the Torres Strait pearl-shell fishery. Every man who enters the fishery
should be encouraged to enlist in our naval forces, and a training vessel should
be stationed in Torres Strait and kept constantly in commission. She could bo
manned by the surplus labour in the Strait, every man enrolled being required to put
in a certain term of service during the year. The payment received from ibis
source would augment the earnings of the men in the pearl-shell industry, and
Australia would be provided with a body of defenders capable of worthily upholding
the honour of their country.
We regard men with a capital of £300 or £400 as a very suitable class for
combining the work of diving and collecting pearl-shell from the open waters with
the prosecution of a system of cultivation in shallow waters. Such mi amount of
money would enable a man to secure a vessel on easy terms as to payment, and at
the same time to establish the nucleus of a cultivation area. The Government could
assist, as already suggested, by supplying from their experimental station small
shell to lay down on the leaseholds.
Shell grown in this way will probably take three or four years at the least to
become of marketable size, Recognising that men with such limited capital cannot
afford to wait so long for a return for their outlay, we recommend that they be
permitted to raise shell of, say, from 3 to 0 inches in diameter obtained in the
usual way from the open waters, and to transfer such shell alive to their cultivation
areas. Some of this shell should be fit for export within twelve months, and this,
together with what they earn by the sale of lull-sized shell raised by diving, will
yield them a comfortable subsistence while the cultivation shell is growing.
Assuming that the Government will not themselves undertake the business
of placing the shell on the London market, we recommend that State assistance be
given to pearl-shellers to co-operate in the business of exporting shell. We also
recommend that the interests o! the producers be further conserved by instructing
the Agent-General to furnish information from time to time regarding market
conditions.
It was suggested during the course of our inquiries that it would be of
advantage if Government assistance were given to the establishment of a button
factory in some part of Australia. It was urged by other witnesses that there would
be a risk of loss if the operations of such a factory were confined to buttons, the
shape and size of which are governed by fashions set on the other side of the world,
and that large quantities might prove unsaleable because of some sudden change in
fashion. The risk of such loss might, however, be reduced by manufacturing more
than one class of goods. We were told that in certain localities on the Continent of
Europe pearl-shell articles are made in the rough in the homes of working people,
who use small and inexpensive hand machines, the articles so manufactured being
finished in factories. If an Australian factory were established, some of these
machines might be used by the families of cultivators and others in Torres Strait,
the unfinished articles being sold to the factory.
Among the items of export from Thursday Island is turtle-shell. According
1 to the annual report of the Government Resident, the amount exported last year was
3,095 lb., valued at £1,027. This suggests the possibility of establishing a valuable
industry—turtle-breeding—which might well be worked in conjunction with the
cultivation of the pearl-oyster. There are large numbers of turtle in the waters in

which pearl-shell and bcche-de-mer are found, and a few of the smaller vessels
licensed under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act at times turn their
attention to turtle for the sake of their shell. The shell exported is obtained from
the hawksbill species, the flesh and fat of which ax*e considered of little commercial
value; but there are several varieties known in our waters, and one of these —the
green turtle —is esteemed very highly for its calipee and calipash, which play such an
important part in aldermanic gastronomy in the mother country. One shipment was
sent to London by way of experiment, but faulty preparation (due to inexperience),
the length of the voyage, and the absence of cool storage combined to render the
results unsatisfactory to the shippers. But success is rare at the outset in any new
undertaking, and there is no reason why, with proper curing and cool storage en route
—such as will be afforded when a direct line of steamers is running between
Queensland and England, via Torres Strait—a ready sale should not be obtainable
for the fat, which has other than culinarv uses.
Turtle-breeding is now an established industry in the West Indies, and
information might be obtained from those islands regarding breeding operations and
the preparation of the fat for the market.
A n animal of commercial value, which is. also numerous in Torres Strait, is
the dugong. It is particularly plentiful in the shallow waters between Mabuiag,
Orman Beef, and New Guinea. For generations the flesh of this mammal has
furnished food to the natives of the islands, and in its pursuit they are very expert.
There is no risk attached to the work, and it requires very little capital. The flesh
is a valuable article of diet, both fresh and cured; the hide makes excellent leather ;
and the therapeutic properties of the oil extracted from the fat have been recognised
almost from the first settlement of white men on the shores of Moreton Bay by the
medical faculty, who learned its value in the treatment of pulmonary complaints
from the aboriginals. This suggests another source of income to men with small
capital while awaiting a return from their cultivation areas.
On many of the islands in Torres Strait it would be possible for white divers
with cultivation areas to engage in some form of tropical agriculture which does not
require continuous attention. One product which comes within this category is the
cocoanut. With a view to encouraging its growth, it would be wise for the
Government to introduce the large nuts of the Eastern Pacific, as the variety now
being grown in Torres Strait is small and not likely to be profitable. If anything
is done in this direction, however, care will have to be taken, in the case of more
fertile islands like Murray and Darnley, to protect the rights of the natives.
WHITE DIVERS.
To enable white men to become successful divers, they will require to be
given some preliminary training. The mechanical operation of descending to the
bottom can be performed without much training, although it is indispensable that the
diver shall be physically sound and possessed of steady nerves. But to become
acquainted with the sea bottom and the conditions under which the pearl-oyster is to
be found requires experience, which can only be gained by instruction under skilled
supervision.
With the object of providing such instruction for white divers, we recommend
the establishment of a training school, and that, for this purpose, not less than two
luggers of from 20 to 25 tons burden, equipped with all the gear requisite for diving
and for transplanting shell, be either purchased or chartered. It may happen that,
after the completion of the training of one set of men, some time will elapse before
another set apply for instruction ; and under such circumstances it may be cheaper
to charter a vessel when the full number, are secured/
The vessels should carry on the work of raising shell under actual service
conditions, and the money received for the shell and pearls will help very materially
to pay for the cost of the training school. Each boat should be under the command
of a skilled diver to act as instructor, assisted by an experienced tender, and should
be manned and worked by an instruction class of not less than six cadet divers,
that being about the crew required for a vessel of the size recommended. These
learners may fairly be expected to give their services gratuitously in return for their

keep and instruction. They should descend in the diving dress in rotation, raise
shell under the supervision of the diver in charge, and take it in turn to man the air
pumps, thus acquiring a thorough knowledge of the work of diver, tender, and crew
on board pearling vessels. If the men seeking instruction cannot afford to do without
pay while being trained, they might he given a “ lay” on the shell raised through
their exertions, and perhaps a share of the proceeds of any pearls they find.
Six months should be the maximum time required for a thorough course of
instruction, making every allowance for probable interruptions from the weather and
other natural causes. We believe that men accus omed to handling boats will
become expert divers and shell gatherers in less than that time; hut ive consider it
better to take the longer period as the standard, and to assume that two complete
squads will receive a training in twelve months on each vessel. This will give about
twenty-four trained divers qualified to take the place of as many aliens during the
first year. In addition to the men so trained, there will, doubtless, he others entering
the industry through other channels; so that it will not he very long before a
considerable number of white men are ready to replace divers and tenders now
employed.
Before any man is allowed to he enrolled as a pupil on a training vessel, wc
recommend that he shall submit to a medical examination, both for his own sake and
to ensure that only men physically equal to the work of diving shall be trained. Of
course, it is quite possible that the training may disclose weaknesses of constitution
previously undetected and unsuspected; hut men developing such weaknesses may
become tenders or be engaged in connection with the cultivation branch of the work,
so that none of them need be lost to the industry.
Such vessels as wc have recommended will cost something like £7OO each,
equipped for service. Assuming that the learners give their services in return for
their instruction and maintenance, the working expenses of each vessel—including
the pay of the diver-instructor and the tender, provisions, gear, and maintenance—
should not exceed £5lO. Each vessel should raise 4 tons of shell per annum, the net
value of which we estimate at £125 per ton, or £5OO for the 4 tons, leaving a net cost per
boat of I'lo per annum. Pearls cannot he calculated upon with any certainty, but
it is fair to assume that the two vessels between them will find sufficient to convert
this small loss into a profit, which will he still further increased by the sale of small
shell for cultivation purposes. If the learners need to be paid for their work as crew,
wc suggest that they should he given a fixed percentage of the value of the pearls
obtained and a “ lay ” on the catch of shell equivalent to £2 I Us. per month —the
wages received at the present time by experienced deck and pump hands. As
previously indicated, the training vessels should he under the supervision and
direction of the Marine Biologist.
With the improved conditions certain to he brought about by the adoption of
our recommendations, we believe that it will he quite possible to work the industry
with white divers and white tenders. We have spoken of a training of six months’
duration, hut have given it as our opinion that in most cases a shorter period will
suffice, and that a larger number than twenty-four men can be (rained annually in
the two vessels. But even with twenty-four per year this will give forty-eight trained
men by the end of the second year, or very nearly one-third of the number of divers
now licensed. We have already recommended that no licenses he issued to aliens who
are not now holding licenses; and, as a considerable number of divers fall out every year
from one cause or another—principally to return to their native land at the expiration
of their agreements—the vacancies so created will open the way from the very inception
of the system for the employment of divers trained in the Government school.
Assuming that the Government enter upon the work of experimenting in cultivation
at an early date, we have no hesitation in recommending that the employment of
alien divers shall cease entirely within five years from the date of the establishment
of a school of marine biology and a school for white divers ; and that of the divers
now licensed, and who may still hold licenses at the end of the second year after
the establishment of the schools, one-fourth shall not be granted licenses in each of
the four succeeding years. As a matter of fact, the yearly voluntary withdrawals
from the industry and deaths account for at least 15 per cent, of the number of
divers in the industry; so that the number of those who may be compelled to

retire by legislation will be inconsiderable. This natural decrease would bring
about the total extinction of the alien divers and tenders within seven years without
resorting to any deprivation of licenses; but we desire to hasten the period at which
the industry shall be worked entirely by white divers and tenders without at the
same time causing any unnecessary hardship to either boat owners or the present
employees.
We have alluded, in paragraph 100, to the possibility of divers entering the
industry through channels other than the training school. Already letters have
been received by gentlemen at Thursday Island from residents in Victoria and
New Zealand, asking for information respecting the possibility of finding employ-
ment as divers. Men such as these and the hardy fishermen of the British Islands
and the countries across the North Sea should be made aware of the openings
presented in the fisheries of Torres Strait. Having regard to the need for con-
stituting a first line of defence in our Northern waters, there is a class of men
even more deserving of encouragement than those just mentioned. Every ship in
the 1 1 oval Navy has among its crew several trained divers. When these men have
obtained their discharge, they can find no better scope for the exercise of their
calling as divers than in our fisheries, and every effort should be made to place
before them the advantages offering in Torres Strait. As the nucleus of such a
o o
naval reserve force as we have already indicated, men of this class would be
invaluable. We recommend that steps be taken to bring the prospects of profitable
employment in the pearl-shell fishery before the maritime workers of the Common-
wealth of Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia, qnd that
the present restriction in the issue of divers’ licenses be removed so far as to permit
of licenses being granted to white men.
Our attention has been called to an article on “ Diving and Caisson Disease,”
written by Surgeon N. Howard Mummery, M.E.C.S., E.N., and communicated to
“The British Medical Journal” of 27th June, 1908, by the Director-General, B.N.
■ It gives “ A Summary of Eecent Investigations,” and contains information bearing
so closely upon one phase of our inquiries and of such value regarding the necessity
for medical examination before allowing any man to become a diver, the possibilities
of diving at depths now considered dangerous, and the precautions adopted to prevent
accidents resulting from diving at such depths, that we take the liberty, in the
interests of divers, of attaching the article to our report. { 'Fide Appendix XXY.)
The knowledge that, with proper treatment, it is possible to reduce the risk of
accidents from diving, even at depths now regarded as dangerous, may prove a potent
factor in inducing white men to become divers. The training of divers should include
a course of instruction in the effect of diving at different depths and pressures, under
varying circumstances, the length of time a diver should remain at such depths, the
length of time to be taken in ascending to the surface, and the precautions to be
adopted to prevent injurious results from diving.
It will be noticed that AVe have only recommended the introduction of AAhite
divers and tenders. In the light of the evidence submitted to us, avc cannot
recommend that the shelling boats shall be also Avorked AA r ith Avhite ci'cavs, because—
(l) It is extremely unlikely that sufficient AAhite labour can be
secured to man Ihe present. number of vessels Avithin any such
period as five years ;
(2) At the present price of shell, the industry cannot afford to pay
Avhite crews as Avell as Avhite divers and tenders; and
(3) There is available a suitable class of coloured labour possessing
natural rights to'employment in the industry.
Pearl-shelling and the bechc-de-mer fishery have, in the past, been two of the
main sources of livelihood for many of the aboriginals of Cape York Peninsula
and the natives of the Torres Strait Islands. To these people have been added of
recent years natives of Papua, who also have natural rights in the fishery. All
of these men arc admirably adapted for Avorking in the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer
lugger’s ; and avc are sure no Government and no people Avould dream of depriving
them of the opportunity of finding employment in the boats. The natives of the
mainland of Australia are decreasing in numbers; but avc have evidence to slioav

that the Torres Strait Islanders are holding their own, if not slightly increasing in
numbers, whilst Papua can supply all the demands of the industry in the future,
even if it should attain much larger dimensions than it has hitherto done. The
Torres Strait Islanders supply nearly all the swimming divers in the Strait; hut
so far they have not shown any predilection for dress diving, and we do not look
either to them or to the Papuans for divers, though we believe they would make
excellent divers if they chose. They have acted occasionally as tenders, and display
special aptitude in the handling of the vessels and the manning of the air pumps;
the same may he said of the Papuans; and there is no reason why both classes
should not he continued in these capacities.
IV. PEARLS.
The Queensland output of pearls is small compared with that of other
countries. "Whatever may be the reason, past experience has taught that the
precious stones are more plentiful in the shell found near reefs than on beds such as
the Old Ground, and this fact may suggest means for their artificial production.
: Regarding the value of pearls obtained in the Queensland fishery, there are
absolutely no statistics available, and it is all a matter of conjecture. Mr. Earquhar,
lone of the leading licensed pearl-dealers at Thursday Island, stated that he valued
the pearls found in 1897 at £40,009. Messrs. Blockings and Zarcal, both men of
long experience, and the latter one of the largest buyers of pearls, estimate the present
annual value of these beautiful gems at about £B,OOO.
The reason for the absence of reliable information is not far to seek. Until
; comparatively recently, all pearls were taken, or were supposed to he taken, by the
owners of the vessels, and were disposed of by them to local pearl-dealers or consigned
for sale to the pearl markets of the world—principally to London. Now the owners
allow the divers to retain all pearls found by them as a portion of their emoluments.
We may remark in passing that this form of payment —largely a case of “ Hobson’s
choice” with the boat owners, since, under the present system of working from the
shore, their chances of receiving any pearls would be very small —introduces an
element of uncertainty into the pay of the divers. It is believed that a large
number of pearls leave Queensland by hand, while it is known that others are
sent abroad through the medium of the Post Office. Regarding the value of the
pearls sent away through these two channels, it is useless to hazard an opinion.
It is highly desirable that some record should he kept of all products of the State,
and it would be well to direct the attention of the Commonwealth Government to
the lack of information with respect to the export of pearls.
Under the floating-station system of working, the owners were able to secure
for themselves all or the greater part of the pearls from the shell raised by their
divers. Coincident with the return to the shore system of working—which renders
it practically impossible for the owners to obtain the pearls —there was a sad falling
off in their market price, and this may have been another reason why the owners
have during recent years tacitly allowed the divers to retain all pearls.
It is significant that no reference is made to this form of payment in the
agreements entered into by the divers. If the concession do, s not confer upon the
diver a beneficial interest in the vessel of which he is in charge, such as is made
illegal by subsection (2) of section 2 of “The Pearl-shell and Beche-de- Mer Pishenj
Ads Amendment Act of 1898,” it is desirable that it should he mentioned in the
agreement between him and his employer, so that every part of the emoluments of
the diver shall he clearly set forth, and nothing left to a secret agreement or a tacit
understanding between the two parties.
There is said to he a groat amount of illicit pearl-dealing going on at
Thursday Island. If by this it is meant that pearls are offered for sale by unlicensed
persons, it is unquestionably true. Nobody emi be long on the Island before he has
personal proof of it. But, if by “illicit dealing” is meant the sale of pearls by
persons who have obtained them by theft or by purchase from thieves, we can
hardly conceive that the charge is well founded. If the owners of the vessels were
still deemed to be the owners of the pearls, the statement might be perfectly true;
but the divers may he trusted to see that they are not robbed, as all shell is opened

on board under their personal supervision, if not by them in person; and they, being
recognised as the owners, and, therefore, qualified to sell, cannot be considered as
guilty of illicitly dealing. All that need be said in this connection is that we do not
suppose it was ever contemplated, when legislation dealing with the subject was being
passed by Parliament, that pearls should be regarded as the property of any but the
owners of the boats, and certainly it Avas never intended that they should become the
sole property of persons Avho are legally disqualified to raise pearl-shell for their own
benefit.
a We have already referred, in paragraphs 55 to 57. to the AA r ork being done by
1 the Natural Pearl-shell Cultivation Company at Albany Island, and to the sanguine
expectations of the local representative of the Company. Time alone can show
Avhether they Avill be realised, and Avhether the reproductiveness of the oyster and
tbe value of the pearl-shell will or will not be reduced by the process of pearl-
inducement resorted to. Put pearls are of so much greater value than shell that
this branch of the industry is one deserving of the special attention of the Marine
Biologist, Avhcn appointed.
It is claimed that it is unfair that a person not domiciled in Queensland
should be alloAvcd to go to Thursday Island, take out a pearl-dealer’s license, outbid
the local dealers, and leave after a few Avceks Avith pearls representing a value
running into thousands of pounds, Avithout contributing anything to the State
revenue beyond the £25 paid for a license, this very exemption from State taxation
enabling him to pay more for pearls than the local dealers can afford to pay.
Although it is possible that a class of non-rosidential dealers might be evolved
under certain conmvable circumstances, Avbo Avould be a convenient medium
for the conveyance beyond the limits of the State of stolen pearls, yet this
was not even hinted at in connection Avith the grievance submitted to us. The
imposition of a differential license fee to place local dealers on terms of equality with
their bird-of-passage rivals Avas suggested as a remedy. As laymen, Ave have some
diffidence about expressing an opinion upon the point, but it certainly seems to us
that such a proposal, as applied to residents of other Australian States, Avould be an
infringement of the Commonwealth Constitution.
In vieAV of possible developments in the production of pearls, the question
arises how cultivation areas and their valuable stock of pearl-producing oysters
are to be protected, and hoAV theft is to be prevented. The ease Avith Avhich
valuable parcels of pearls may be smuggled on board of steamers calling at Thursday
Island, bound for foreign countries, calls for stringent preventive measures. With
that end in Anew, avo recommend the passage of legislation someAvhat on the lines
of the Diamond Trade Ordinance of IUO3 (Transvaal), although possibly Avith less
severe penalties. The Avhole question of pearl-dealers’ licenses Avould be dealt with
in such a measure; and one safeguard Avhich Avould perhaps meet the complaint
referred to Avould be a provision requiring all applicants for pearl-dealers’ licenses
to find two local bondsmen of repute, the amount of each bond being, say, £5OO or
£l,OOO.
“DUMMYING” AND MEASUREMENT OF BOATS.
The term “dummying” Avas used by several Avitnesscs to describe the fictitious
ownership by qualified persons of vessels which are in reality the property of aliens
Avho are disqualified from obtaining or holding licenses for vessels under the
Pearl-shell and Beche-dc-M er Pi dicry Act, It Avas alleged that vessels have been
built by, and principally for, .lapancs -, and that such beats have been subsequently
licensed in the name of British subjects. The process folloAved in such cases, avc
were informed, is as follows:—I he real oAvner induces some British subject to
profess to be the OAvner of the vessel by making a false declaration of OAvnership under
the Merchant Shipping Act, and then take out a license for the vessel under the
Pearl shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act, Avhich involves a further false declaration.
Various methods are said to be adopted to disguise the real nature of the
transaction, at the same time retaining to the alien OAvner his beneficial interest in
the vessel and her earnings. He is said to go through the form of lending the
pretended' OAvner a sum of money, on Avhich he is sometimes paid interest, and Avith
this money the “dummy” pretends to purchase the vessel. The real owner then

works the boat as diver or man in charge, and receives a “lav” which secures
to him the greater part of the profits, the balance going to the fictitious owner,
ostensibly as Isis share of the catch, but really as a douceur' for his services
in enabling the alien to evade the provisions of the Act. Three witnesses assured
us that they had been approached by Japanese with propositions of this nature,
and that, when they refused to lend themselves to such a thing, they were told that
others were not so scrupulous. In some cases, no doubt, there is no justification for
accusations of wrongdoing, but in others we fear the general belief is only too well
founded, and a close scrutiny in cases of this kind is eminently desirable. This
nefarious practice is said to be confined chiefly to the beche-de-mer industry, and
not in any way to apply to pump diving vessels. The greatest care is naturally taken
to keep such transactions a close secret, and it would be a matter of difficulty
to secure conclusive evidence. Still, it is advisable to take steps to prevent their
continuap.ce. The adoption of our recommendations to exclude all coloured aliens
from both industries will have this effect; and, until the coloured alien is so excluded,
we recommend that no new vessels be licensed unless built within the Commonwealth
and by British subjects, and that all liens on licensed vessels be registered under the
Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Pishery Act.
While referring to the question of vessels, we desire also to direct attention
to the statement made by several witnesses that vessels built and registered in New
South Wales are measured in such a way that the ascertained tonnige is considerably
less than would have been the case if the same vessels had been built and measured in
Queensland, thereby placing Queensland boat-builders at a disadvantage.
As the Commonwealth has not yet assumed c mtrol of all matters connected
with shipping, we recommend that any amendment of the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-
Mer Pishery Act shall provide that, before any vessel is licensed under the Act, it shall
L be measured and registered in Queensland. We further recommend that the license
i fee for pump diving vessels be £3 per annum, and for swimming diving vessels £1
per annum, irrespective of tonnage.
Y. THE BECHE-DE-MER PISHERY.
Poliowing the title of the Act regulating the working of the pearl-shell and
beche-de-mer fisheries, we have been commissioned to make “full inquiry into the
working of the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer industry.” Owing :to there being but
one class of license issued under the Act, vessels obtaining licenses are entitled
to fish for either pearl-shell or beche de-mer; and many of the smaller craft take
advantage of this and devote their attention to whichever industry is more profitable
for the time being. Still, the two industries are quite distinct. Remarks and
recommendations applying to one do not necessarily apply with equal force, or at all,
to the other. Por this reason we have preferred to deal with them under separate
headings.
In two main particulars there is a striking similarity between the two
.fisheries. In the first place, they have both passed into the hands of colouicd aliens,
:so far as the management of the vessels is concerned, and in both the crews consist
either of aliens of the same nationality, or of mainland aboriginals, natives of the
Torres Strait Islands, or Papuans The second point of resemblance is that both
industries are suffering from severe depression due to the depleted condition of the
fish supplies, the depletion in both cases being brought about by the way in which
the work has been carried on by these aliens without the slightest regard to anything
but immediate profit.
According to the statistics supplied to us at Thursday Island, Cooktown, Port
Douglas, and Cairns, there are apparently not more than eight Kuropcan masters
of heche-de-mt r fishing vessels out of a total of sixty-seven. We have no information
on the point, but it is probable that these eight men are also owners of the vessels of
which they arc in charge. It may be said without fear of contradiction that, except
these men and the owners and reputed owners of the other vessels, not a single
European resident of Queensland derives any direct benefit from this industry.
Several boats are owned and worked exclusively by Torres Strait Islanders under the
supervision of the Protector of Aboriginals.

Filling
grounds
and
discomforts
of life.
Of recent years the beche-de-mer has been obtained chiefly from the Great
Barrier Reef and the reefs to the eastward in the Coral Sea, the latter being outside
the territorial limits of Queensland. In these waters the fishing vessels are exposed
to frequent heavy weather, and the life on hoard such small craft is one of discomfort
and hardship, combined with a considerable amount of danger.
From the evidence submitted to us, it would appear that the beche-de-mer,
which were formerly plentiful on the top of the reefs, have either been exterminated
there or driven to seek refuge in the deeper waters adjacent, and it is now necessary
to resort to diving in depths of 6or 7 fathoms of water. The diving is done by
naked aboriginals and Papuans, as in swimming diving for pearl-shell.
Exposure, especially on the more southern reefs, causes the natives from the
latitudes of Torres .Strait and Papua to suffer severely from cold. Lung troubles are
prevalent, and the death i’ate from pulmonary complaints is excessively heavy.
The conditions of the industry generally are such as to make it repulsive to
white men. Vessels are compelled, by the nature of the fishery, to remain in the
remote waters of the Harrier Reef or the Coral Sea for lengthened periods, during
which time the master has no other company than his coloured crew, with whom he
cannot associate without lowering his standing in their eyes.
White men are also at a great disadvantage in the competition for aboriginal
labour. Their coloured rivals do not scruple to resort to such illegal devices to obtain
crews as supplying the aboriginals with liquor; and, as the recruiting is done hy the
men in charge of the vessels at the aboriginal camps, far from supervision, it is most
difficult to prevent practices of this kind. Under all the circumstances, it is not
surprising that few white men care to engage in the fishery, and that their numbers
are diminishing rather than increasing.
In 1907 the fishery seems to have reached its zenith. Prices were high,
fish Avere plentiful, and the largest number of boats on record was engaged.
The reefs were thoroughly exploited from the shores of New Guinea right
down to Curtis Channel and Lady Elliot Island, at the southernmost limit of the
Barrier Reef; and the search was extended for quite 200 miles to the eastward.
The reefs were fished hare, and the general complaint is that little or no beche-de-mer
is now obtainable, at any rate on the more accessible reefs. We visited Endeavour
Reef to the south of Cook town, as well as several reefs to the northward and in
Torres Strait, to satisfy ourselves as to the truth or otherwise of these complaints.
In the past large quantities of beche-de-mer were found on these reefs; hut we
failed to see any marketable fish.
Two witnesses at Yorke Island, in Torres Strait, stated that even on reefs
which were supposed to be denuded of fish they catch considerable quantities on
moonlight nights. Whether a natural instinct of self-preservation has caused the
beche-de-mer to change their habits in order to escape their foes, and to come to
the top of the reefs at night, we are not in a position to say.
Even less is known about the life and habits of the beche-de-mer than about
the pearl-oyster. Where and when it- breeds, its powers of reproductiveness, and
how long it lakes to arrive at maturity, are all matters of conjecture, and might well
engage the attention of the Marine Biologist when appointed.
The small catch this year brought about a state of depression, if anything,
Averse than tint existing in the pearl-shell industry; and the position is aggi'avated
by the soil ms fall in prices Avliich has taken place since last year. Prices were
never lower than at present, notwithstanding the small output of the Queensland
fishery. The causes assigned for the low prices are a decreasing demand in China
(which is the only market for beche-de-mer), increased supplies from other quarters,
and the depreciation of the silver dollar, Avliich is the standard currency in the East.
There can be little question that the supplies obtainable from our reefs have
been reduced to such an extent that the industry is not likely to be profitable for
some years. We, therefore, recommend that the fishery be closed for a period
of two years, the closure to bo removed before the expiration of that term, if

investigation in the meantime should prove that the heche-de-mer have again become
plentiful. If, on the other hand, the reefs still remain unstocked at the end of two
years, we recommend that the period of closure be farther extended.
To enforce, absolute closure over 1,200 miles of reef would he extremely
costly; hut there is a simple method of securing the end in view without having to
resort to patrolling work of any kind. We recommend that the exportation of
heche-de-mer from all Queensland ports be prohibited during the period fixed for
the closure of the fishery.
If permanent closure he considered too extreme a step, our further
, recommendation, that no Asiatic or other coloured alien he allowed to he carried on
hoard any licensed vessel, whether as master, crew, or passenger, will have the
effect of : limiting the number of vessels, as for some time it is not likely that many
white men will be available. It will also put a stop to the alleged illegal practices
of Asiatics in connection with the recruiting of aboriginals.
As the exigencies of the heche-de-mer fishery necessitate the employment of
vessels of a greater tonnage than the maximum of 25 tons which we have suggested
for the pearl-shell fishery, we recommend that the present sliding scale of fees for
beche-de-mer vessels be continued.
VI. GENERAL.
One difficulty with which we have found ourselves confronted during the
course of our inquiries has been the lack of reliable and detailed statistics. We have
to express our appreciation of the readiness and courtesy with which every officer —
‘ whether Commonwealth or State—to whom we applied did his best to supply us
with information. That in several important respects we were unable to obtain the
precise information we sought was in no way the fault of the officers, but was due to
the f ict that no distinction is made under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery
Act between the various forms of fishing There are no less than four different
classes of operations carried on under the one license—pump diving, swimming
diving, beche-de-mer fishing, and turtle fishing; and it is not uncommon for the
same vessel to engage in each of the three last-mentioned forms of fishing. Hence it
is impossible to arrive at anything like an accurate conclusion as to bow many vessels
worked under each heading during any one year, the periods for which they were so
employed, and the quantity of pearl-shell which was obtained by vessels of each
class. We recommend that it be provided by statute that licenses for vessels shall
be of three kinds —pump diving, swimming diving, and beche-de-mer and turtle
fishing; that, if it is intended to employ vessels in more than one of these fisheries,
a separate license shall bo taken out for each fishery ; and that the .owners of licensed
vessels be required to furnish to the Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries a quarterly
return showing the weight and value of all pearl-shell, pearls, beche-de-mer, turtle,
and turtle-shell obtained by each vessel owned by them.
In oi’der to avoid divided control in the administration of the Pearl-shell and
Bcchc-dc-Mer Fishery Act, we recommend that all boat licenses, divers’ licenses,
and pearl-dealers’ licenses be issued by the officer charged with the administration
of the Act.
We cannot conclude our Report without acknowledging the courtesy of the
Torres Shire Council in placing their hall at our disposal for the purpose of taking
evidence at Thursday Island, We are indebted to the Torres •'-trait Pearl Shelters’
Association, the Managers of the Queensland National Bank and the Bank of
North Queensland, Thursday Island, and the various officials (Commonwealth and
State) who supplied us with statistical returns; and to the staff of the Government
Printing Office for the admirable manner in which they have performed the work of
printing the Report and evidence. We also desire to place on record our apprecia-
tion of the ability and assiduity displayed by Messrs. Brennan and ilodgen, our
Secretary and Assistant Secretary, in the discharge of their onerous duties.

VII. SUMMARY.
Summarising the results of our inquiries, we find, in answer to the questions
submitted to us —
(1) That the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries are suffering from
severe depression, which has resulted mainly from depletion of
natural supplies;
(2) That it is possible successfully and profitably to cultivate the
pearl-oyster; and
(3) That it is possible gradually to substitute white for alien divers.
In the foregoing Report are set forth at length the means Avhich, in our
opinion, should be adopted for achieving these three ends, together with some minor
recommendations bearing upon the pearl-shell and bfiche-de-mer fisheries. Our
chief recommendations we now present in synoptic form, and, in doing so, we wish
especially to emphasise the necessity for appointing a competent Marine Biologist,
as upon his advice and administration will largely depend the success of any scheme
for rehabilitating the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries, for introducing and
developing a system of pearl-oyster cultivation, and for substituting white for alien
divers.
I MEANS FOR ARRESTING DEPLETION OP PEARL-OYSTER BEDS.
With a view to arresting the depletion of pearl-oyster beds, we recommend —
(1) That there he no increase in the number of licensed vessels until
investigation has proved that the supplies of- shell have .been
augmented;
(2) That no individual or company desiring to come into the industry in
future shall he permitted to obtain licenses for or acquire a beneficial
interest in more than five vessels; that so long as existing pearl-
shellers (whether individuals, firms, or companies) own more than
five vessels they shall not be granted licenses for vessels intended
to replace any which may become unserviceable or which may
he lost or sold, nor shall they he permitted to hold or acquire a
beneficial interest in any vessel or vessels licensed in the name of any
other person or persons; and that the members of a firm or company
shall not be allowed to obtain, in the aggregate, more than five
licenses;
(3) That no licenses he issued to aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or
the islands of the Pacific not now holding divers’ licenses;
(4) That the number of divers’ licenses issued to Europeans during a
period of- five years, commencing on Ist January, 1909, shall not
exceed the number of vessels licensed for pump diving by more than
25 per centum;
(5) That legislation be passed rendering any reintroduction of the
floating-station system impossible, and prohibiting, inter aha, the
licensing for employment in the pearl-shell fishery of any vessel of
a gross tonnage exceeding 25 tons;
(G) That the deep-water areas in the vicinity of Darnley and Mount
Adolphus Islands be permanently closed;
(7) That defined areas be closed for a period of years, or, alternatively,
that all grounds, with the exception of the Old Ground, be closed
for a certain prescribed period in each year ;
(S) That closure be rigidly enforced by an effective patrol, backed up
by the necessary legal enactments; and
(9) That, except for tire purposes hereinafter specified, it shall not be
lawful to raise, open, or remove any shell under 6 inches, nacre
measurement.


11. SCIENTIFIC CULTIVATION OF PEARL-OYSTERS.
With a view to encouraging the scientific cultivation of pearl-oysters, we
recommend—
(l) That a thoroughly competent Marine Biologist be appointed,
preferably one who has had previous experience in connection with
pearl-oysters ; that he he stationed in Torres Strait; and that he he
furnished with every requisite for scientific research, including a
sufficient staff, a well-equipped laboratory, an area on which to
conduct practical experiments in cultivation, and a vessel or vessels
for the collection of bivalves to stock his propagation area;
(2) That the Marine Biologist so appointed shall be the Chief Inspector
or Director of Pearl-shell, Beche-de-Mer, and the allied Fisheries, in
which capacity he shall supervise and control all operations in
connection with the administration of the pearl-shell, heche-de-mer,
and turtle industries;
(3) That a School of Marino Biology, on lines similar to those adopted in
the Agricultural College at Gatton and the Charters Towers School
of Mines, he established for the training of students under the
direction of the Marine Biologist;
(4) That, pending the passage of amending legislation and the appoint-
ment of a Marine Biologist, no cultivation leases he granted under
the existing regulations; and that portions of the foreshores in
Torres Strait and along the east coast as far south as Cape Melville
he reserved for cultivation purposes, and thrown open to selection
under lease in suitable areas, on liberal terms as regards rental, for
a period of not less than twenty-one years, with a restriction as to
the maximum area which any one person or company may acquire,
so as to guard against the creation or development of a monopoly;
and
(5) That statutory provision he made for the protection of cultivation
areas against trespass and larceny.
111. SUBSTITUTION OP WHITE FOR ALIEN DIVERS.
With a vi(£v*to encouraging white men to engage in the pearl-shell industry
as divers, and to securing their gradual substitution for aliens in that capacity, we
recommend —
(1) That the present restriction on the issue of diver’s licenses he
removed so far as to permit of licenses being granted to white men 7
(2) That the employment of alien divers shall cease entirely within five
years from the date of the establishment of a School of Marino
Biology and a School for White Divers, and that of the divers now
licensed, and who may still hold licenses at the end of the second
year after the establishment of the Schools, one-fourth shall not bo
granted licenses in each of the four succeeding years;
(3) That a Training School for the Instruction of Whit j Divers he.
established, and that, for this purpose, not less than two luggers of
from 20 to 25 tons burden, equipped with all gear requisite for
diving and transplanting shell, bo either purchased or chartered;
(4) That selectors of cultivation areas be permitted to raise shell of, say,
from 3 to 6 inches, nacre measurement, and to transft r such shell
alive to their cultivation areas ;
(5) That State assistance he given to pearl-shellers to co-operate in the
business of exporting shell, and that the Agent-General in London
be instructed to furnish information from time to time regarding
market conditions;


(6) That the Government consider the advisability of placing the possi-
bilities of the industry before the classes of men referred to in
section 104 of the Report;
(7) That the employment of white men as crews shall not be compul-
sory ; and
(8) That, as aboriginals of the mainland, of Torres Strait, and of Papua
have proved themselves suitable for tenders and crews, and as they
have certain natural rights in the Northern Fisheries of Queensland,
their employment in those capacities be continued.
17. PEARLS.
'With a view lo protecting the property of the rightful owners of pearls—of
preventing jtheft and illicit dealing in this valuable product of the oyster —we
recommend—
That Parliament be asked to pass legislation somewhat on the lines of
The Diamond Trade Ordinance of 1903 (Transvaal), although
possibly with less severe penalties,
V. BECHE-DE-MER FISHERY.
With respect to this industry, we recommend —
(1) That the fishery be closed for a period of two years, the closure to
be removed before the expiration of that term if investigation in
the meantime should prove that the beche-de-mer have again become
plentiful; but to be continued for a further term if the reefs still
remain unstocked at the end of two years; and that, during such
period of closure, the exportation of beche-de-mer from all
Queensland ports be prohibited; and
(2) That no Asiatic or other coloured alien v be allowed to be carried on
board any licensed vessel, whether as master, crew, or passenger.
VI. GENERAL.
We also recommend —
(1) That no new vessels be licensed unless such boats are built in the
Commonwealth and by British subjects ;
(2) That before any vessel is licensed under the and Beche-
de-Mer Fishery Act it shall be measured and registered in
Queensland;
(3) That, assuming that there shall, in the future, be three distinct
classes of boatTicenses, no vessels shall be licensed for pump diving
unless equal in standard to those built within the last three years;
(4) That the license fee for pump diving vessels be £3 per annum, and
for swimming diving vessels £1 per annum, irrespective of tonnage ;
(5) That the license fees for vessels employed in the beche-de-mer fishery
remain as at present;
(6) That all liens on licensed vessels be registered under the Pearl-shell
.and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act;
(7) That, with a view to securing reliable information regarding the
progress and condition of the several fisheries, it be provided by
statute that licenses for vessels shall be of three kinds —pump diving,
swimming diving, and beche-de-mer and turtle fishing; that, if it is
intended to employ vessels in more than one of these fisheries, a
separate lie:use shall be taken out for each fishery; and that the
owners of licensed vessels shall be required to furnish to the
Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries a quarterly return showing the
weight and value of all pearl-shell, pearls, beche-de-mer, turtle, and
turtle-shell obtained by each vessel owned by them;

Section 136,
(8) That, in order to avoid divided control in the administration of the
Pearl-shell and Bechc-dc-Mer Fishery Act, all boat licenses, divers'
licenses, and pearl-dealers’ licenses he issued by the officer charged
with the administration of the Act;
(9) That provision he made in the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery
Act on the lines of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, 57 and 58
Vic. cap. 60, Part IV., for—
(a) The regulation of the engagement and discharge of all persons
employed in the pearl-shell and heche-de-mer fisheries,
including all matters relating to articles of agreement,
advances, payment of wages, accommodation, food, sickness,
deaths, desertions, &c., hitherto dealt with under the
Merchant Shipping Act; and
(b) The prohibition of the supply of goods by employers to
employees, and the charging of same against wages accruing
or due (vide 57 Vic. No, 7, section 2).
VII. PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER FISHERY ACTS,
With a view to carrying out the recommendations above enumerated and the
Various suggestions embodied in our report, we further recommend —
That the several Acts dealing with the pearl-shell and heche-de-mer
industries—namely, 45 Vic. No. 2, 50 Vic. No. 2, 55 Vic. No. 29,
57 Vic. No. 7, 60 Vic, No. 32, and 63 Vic. No. 3 —be repealed, and
their provisions (extended and amended as necessary) consolidated
in one Act, the two fisheries to he kept distinct and dealt with in
different divisions of such consolidating Act.
Bated this 24th day of August, 190&;


EIDER.
I desire to add tlie following Rider to the foregoing Report:—
I consider that any person qualified to hold a boat license who is desirous of
engaging in the industry, and either doing his own diving or employing white divers
only, should he entitled to obtain a license or licenses upon complying with the
regulations for the time being in force governing the industry.
1 recommend that the present limit of 5 inches remain in force until 81 st
December, 1910. While I agree that it would he desirable to have an exportable
limit of 0 inches, I am convinced that the present alien divers, working under the
system now in vogue at Thursday Island—and, if our recommendations aye carried
out, they will pass out of the industry within five years, and will require to “ make
hay while the sun shines ” —will raise, open, and destroy every shell obtained under
6 inches, purely on the chance of getting a pearl; the shell will be consigned to the
deep, killed, and no one will derive any benefit. It is, moreover, impossible to
prevent a diver from raising small shell, opening, and destroying it, unless an
inspector is placed on every vessel engaged. I believe, however, that white divers
would observe a regulation of this nature more than aliens, and it is possible the
latter will have been partially replaced by whites by the date I have mentioned.
I differ somewhat from the expressions contained in these paragraphs.
The pearl-shell industry has for some thirty years been a considerable source
of revenue to the Queensland Government, and, now that it is proposed to make it-a
’white-diver industry —with the probable result of still further increased revenue—I
am of opinion that, to tide over the initial difficulties and assist white divers to
acquire vessels of their own, some scheme of rendering financial aid might well be
devised.
Mr. Ilodel’s proposition practically means nationalisation of the industry—at
any rate, for a time —and involves the State employing alien labour. It might work
out satisfactorily, but is not a scheme likely to be adopted.
Mr. Bowden’s proposition, however, is more feasible, but would require careful
handling.
It is the promising man with only a small cash balance and no other capital
that deserves Government aid; and, in addition, a bonus for a few years, until
supplies of shell become more plentiful, would be a very reasonable thing, more
especially if some provision was made for a refund should a certain total value be
obtained for the year’s operations.
So far as fraud is concerned, if the bonus was paid only on a limited quantity
—such as up to and not exceeding 8 tons —obtained by a vessel in twelve months,
with white diver, it would be a poor diver who could not secure that quantity in a
year; and there would then be no inducement to attempt the fraudulent practices
hinted at.
I believe that a bonus scheme might very well be arranged somewhat on the
lines suggested.
I do not think, however, there would be justification for guaranteeing a
minimum price for shell. The producer would, perforce, be obliged to take what
the best world’s markets offered, in accordance with supply and demand—the same
as obtains wita almost all other products.

APPOINTED TO
Inquire into the Working of the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer
Industries and lleport regarding the Best Means of Securing the
following objects, namely;—(1) The Working of Pearl-ojster
Beds in such a manner as to avoid depletion, and to make the
industry regular and permanent; (2) The scientific cultivation
of Pearl-oysters and the probabilities of success in that direction;

Captain J. MACKAT {Chairman) \ ’ Me. H. A, C. DOUG-LAS, M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
Edwin Munro, Pearl Sheller, examined:
1. j By the Chairman ; This Commission has been appointed to inquire into the working of the Pearl-shell
and Beche-de-mer Industries, and to collect evidence which will enable us to devise a scheme, which, when
made effective by the necessary legislation, will render the prosecution of the industry more attractive;
and congenial to our own race and to Europeans generally, and will conserve for them an avenue
of productive enterprise which is now largely despoiled by Japanese and other alien races. Of course,
there are many contingent matters which must necessarily crop up during the inquiry, but they are
subsidiary to the general objects of the Commission. Having regard to your long experience in pearl-
shelling, and your familiarity with every phase of the industry, the Commission feel that the evidence
which you may give will be of more than ordinary importance. Where are you now engaged in the
pearl-shell industry? At the Aroe Islands, in the Dutch East Indies.
2. Would you think it a pertinent question for me to ask you to assign your reason for transferring your
operations to Dutch territory —You can decline to answer the question if you choose—I merely refer to
this matter as a fitting prelude to the discussion of the coloured labour question ? I have no objection
to answer the question. There are a variety of causes.
3. We shall deal with the principal causes ? The labour question was the principal cause. We were very
much harassed through the want of suitable coloured labour. It is not possible, I think, to get white
labour—under present conditions, at any rate. The “ take” of pearl had fallen off considerably. That
was another cause.
E. Munro.
21 May, 1908.

4. And the value of shell had depreciated ? It was very low in value, too. But, apart from that, we-
, heard of patches of good shelling-ground at the Aroe Islands. Those patches were reported to us as being
. considerable in extent and containing a large quantity of shell. We, therefore, seized the opportunity of
getting across to that ground in order to get at the shell.
5. Do we understand, then, that the two principal reasons for transferring your operations to the Aroe Islands
in the Dutch East Indies were the scarcity of labour and the hope of getting more shell or more
profitable returns ? Yes ; you can put those down as the principal reasons.
6. And you say the principal reason was the scarcity of labour ? Yes.
7. You say you think it impossible for the industry to be worked by white labour under existing
conditions? Yes.
8. Will you kindly state the grounds upon which you base that conclusion? Because there is not
sufficient money in it to make it worth the while of a white man to go into the industry.
9. By Mr. Bennett : That is as an employee, I presume P Yes, as an employee. I am presuming that
you are now talking more particularly about divers.
10. By the Chairman : Do you think it possible for the industry to be carried on by white divers ? No.
Under existing conditions, I certainly say no, for the reason I have given—that the diver would not make
sufficient money out of it.
11. Will you be kind enough to point out how to improve existing conditions, so as to offer an incentive
to white men to engage in the industry ? 1 do not know of any way, unless you could induce the
Government to come to the aid of the industry in the same way as the Federal Government have come to
the aid of the sugar industry—that is, by granting a bonus on the shell raised by white divers. I think
it is altogether out of the question to employ entirely white crews.
12. Is it a fair analogy to compare the pearl-shell industry with the sugar industry—the bonus paid to
the sugar industry is a temporary expedient to recompense planters for the stoppage of black labour, and
will cease in two or three years ? It may be renewed, of course. Perhaps the pearl-shell industry
is not on all-fours with the sugar industry in the respect mentioned, but I do not know of any other
means by which you can make it worth the while of white men to take up the work.
13. Do you refer to employees ? Yes ; if employers cannot afford to pay the wages of white men, they
cannot employ white men.
11. Do you not think some benefit might be derived from an extension of the leases at present in exis-
tence —If the leases were extended to the proximity of banks and islands in Torres Strait, would that
not afford an opportunity to white men with families to establish homes for themselres, and thus assist in
the carrying out of scientific methods for improving the production of shell? Well, we have our own
case, in which we endeavoured to transplant shell. Some ten or twelve years ago we laid down over
100,000 shell in the passage between Friday Island and Prince of Wales Island. After that shell lay
there for something like three years, we took up all that we could get of it. We could get no protection
from the Government. The Japanese were stealing our shell at night, and when we eventually caught
them we were told by the District Court judge who tried the case that pearl-oysters were wild animals
and that we could not get a conviction against men for stealing wild animals.
15. The Criminal Code says different to that now ? At any rate, we took up this shell after lying there
for something like three years, and, speaking from memory, I do not think we obtained more than 2 or 3
per cent, of young shell.
16. There was no increased production, so far as you could ascertain ? No. L account for that in this
way —that the spat was taken out of the passage by the tides. The tides run both ways, in and out, and
the spat, instead of lodging on our area, was taken out to sea or into other passages. At any rate, we
did not get it.
17. Were any artificial means adopted to keep the spat ? Yes. We laid down large quantities of rough
stone—lumps of rock and that sort of thing—and bundles of brushwood such as are used in connection
with the oyster fisheries of Europe.
18. Apart from the thieving of the Japanese, do you think there was any result calculated to encourage
further attempts ? Ido not think so. If the prospects had been good, we would have gone on with it
ourselves.
19. In your opinion, there was no incentive to carry on the industry in that way? No; principally
because of the difficulty in retaining the spat.
20. Do you not think that the appointment of a biologist would overcome that ? Ido not think so. We
imported a very competent man from England under a three-years’ engagement.
21. Who was that ? Mr. Pace.
22. Did he abandon the project ? He did not succeed at-all, and we got tired of going on.
23. Did he give no promise of success, it the conditions were improved in any way ? No. He did not
suggest to us any other methods by which the industry could be carried on more successfully.
24. I presume you know Mr. Tosh ? Yes.
25. Did you ever discuss the matter with him ? Not that I remember —not at any length, at any rate.
26. By Mr. Bennett : I think he was there after you had almost abandoned the experiment in Friday
Island Passage? Yes. We kept on the lease for a number of years, but we did not do anything
with it.
27. By the Chairman : If areas were selected where the current had less velocity, do you not think it
would improve the chances of success ? Ido not think so. Perhaps you do not know Friday Island
Passage.
28. Oh, yes; but Ido not know the velocity of the tide? In parts of the passage there is very little
tide. The deep-water channel is very narrow indeed, and there is a great lot of shelling-ground over
which there is a very small run of tide.
29. Of course, the run of tide will find the deepest channel, which adds to the velocity ? Yes. There
is very little run of tide in the shallow portions of the passage ; but, to my mind, the places with the
swiftest tide grow the best shell. The shell seems to thrive better in swift currents than in shallow water.
I do not say that is so generally, but it is so to a large extent.
30. In a narrow channel like that, could anything be done to retard the velocity of the current ? I
suppose that could be done by putting down a barrier, but I do not think it is necessary to retard the
current.
31. It is not a navigable channel for big boats, is it ? No.
2
MINUTES OE EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER ROTAL COMMISSION,.


32. Then it does not come within the category of a navigable highway ? We were forced to keep it open.
33. Probably if an application were made to-day you might be more successful, although I may not be
■justified in saying so ? We tried to prevent boats coming to the passage to gather firewood and fish.
34. Did you apply to be allowed to close the channel or to obstruct it? We applied for permission to
prevent craft going to and fro through it.
35. What is the width of the navigable channel—the channel through which a vessel drawing 7 or 8 feet
could go ? At each end in some parts it is not much more than the width of this room; but in the
middle it is quite a quarter of a mile wide.
36. Judging by concessions that have been made to assist the industry, if representations were made
to-day that certain results would ensue from obstructing the channel, I think they would be favourably
entertained? We did not purpose obstructing the channel. What we wanted was to have boats
prohibited from coming to gather firewood or to fish, because these people were stealing our shell.
37. But you could apply for the opposite coast line ? We did, and we paid for it. W e got both sides of
the passage.
38. Would that not enable you to warn them off? We were told that we could not prevent them going
there. The Japanese gathered firewood and fished on the banks of the island.
39. Then there must have been a change of late, for a concession has been granted to Mr. Saville Kent
for cultivation purposes in the bay next to the Messrs. Jardine’s place in the Normanby Passage. He
has been given control over the whole bay from headland to headland. He asked for the opposite island,
and he got that too, so that it appears more liberal terms are given now than those you got—l recom-
mended that he should get that—l suppose the bay is a mile from headland to headland ? Not so much
as that.
40. I think the one a little further north is more than that ? At any rate, we wanted these men to be
prevented from going there, and we were told we could not stop them.
41. If legislation were passed securing to you a liberal area adjacent to the ground you required for
hatchery purposes, would it be an inducement to you to make another attempt ? Ido not think it would.
42. Why ? It is impossible to retain spat about the area. The shell must have a continuous flow of
water over it, because it obtains its food out of the water flowing over it. If we were to attempt to
propagate the spat in a tank, it would need a very fine mesh to retain the spat. I think Mr. Saville
Kent says that the pearl-oyster gives off some millions of spat each year, so that you can imagine how
small it is, and what a fine mesh would be required to retain it in any artificial enclosure. The mesh
would be so fine that the marine growths would obstruct the flow of the water in a few hours.
43. Then is it your opinion that the industry cannot be improved by means of artificial cultivation ? I
do not know how it can be done. Of course, we have a very great reservoir in the deep waters about the
Strait. The spat from the shell in the deep water is continually flowing backward and forward with
the tide. There is any amount of shell both to the eastward and to the westward of the Strait in water
too deep to be worked; and the spat is being continually carried from there to the shallow areas, and
much of it lodges and grows there.
44. You referred to Mr. Saville Kent just now—Do you know whether his efforts in transplanting shell
from Torres Strait to the Eastern Pacific have been successful ? No. I have heard that the man there
reports that a large amount of small shell is growing in the marine grasses; but, from our own experience
in Friday Island Passage, lam convinced that that is the bastard shell. At Friday Island we had
millions and millions of young shell growing on the weeds, but not one-fiftieth part of one per cent, of it was
true pearl-shell.
45. Suwarrow and Penrhyn are atoll islands which, for the last fifty years, have been famous for the
production of black-edge shell, and no other ? That is so ; and, if they did get the gold-lip shell to grow,
I believe it would grow black. I believe the different environment would change its colour,
46. Of course, you are aware that the pearl-shell of Torres Strait is found as far east as the Solomon
Islands, but no further ? Yes.
47. Still I think his failure to propagate the shell in the habitat of the black-edge cannot be any criterion
of success or otherwise in Torres Strait? No; but I view the matter in this way : that if the shell is
left where it is now, it will give off just as much spat, and you would have just as much chance of
retaining it there. I do not think there is any advantage in bringing shell from the Old Ground and
planting it at Thursday Island. The spat would bo washed away by the tides.
48. Then you think no artificial means would arrest the waste or loss of spat? I would not go as far
as that; but I say that at the present moment I do not know of any. Are there any means which
suggest themselves to you, and on which I could give you any information ?
49. No; I never did believe in this attempt to transplant Torres Strait shell to the habitat of the
black-edge shell ? You see we have our experience in our own case as well as that. All our shell in
Friday Island Passage was not stolen.
50. Was there any development apparent in that shell? Ido not think there was more than 2or 3 per
cent, at the outside during the period of three years. That is the result, as far as I can remember, when
we took up the shell.
51. That would not be considered a remunerative return ? No ; and that I attribute, as I have said, to
the fact that spat got away out of the passage, and did not come in again. The tide took it away, and
it got into a wider area.
52. Has artificial production been attempted anywhere else but in Friday Island Passage—what about
Wai-Weer? I heard that Mr. Saville Kent made some experiments in the East Indies—about Borneo —
but that they were a failure, and that he has come back to Torres Strait again. Some time ago I met
the manager of Lever Bros., and I told him he would find large quantities of bastard shell in the ground
they worked, but that he must not take it from that that he was getting a big haul of pearl-shell.
53. Seeing that the gold-edge shell cannot develop in the habitat of the black-edge shell, is it not a
reasonable assumption that the necessary conditions must be wanting ? lam speaking of some time ago.
But the experience we had at Friday Island was sufficient for me. The return we got was so small that
it did not warrant us making another experiment of a similar nature.
54. If conditions were made more liberal by legislation, would you be inclined to undertake another
experiment ? Ido not see how you can make the conditions so favourable that there will be any chance
of success. The matter is not one that can be relieved by legislation.

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOBE THE PEABL-SHELL AND BECHK-DE-MEE BOY AD COMMISSION.


E. Munro.
21Mo^808.
55. Tou said just now that you could not stop people intruding on Friday Island —If you were armed
with authority to resist any intrusion, that would he a concession ? It would, but that would not have
. materially affected our experiment at Friday Island, because, although we lost some shell, yet we had
sufficient to carry on the experiment.
56. If you were granted an extension of area and were armed with authority to resist intrusion, would
that be sufficient to induce you to make another trial ? Ido not think so. I have not given the subject
very much thought of late, but it is the natural difficulties we want to get over first. We want to satisfy
ourselves that we can overcome those difficulties. Then, I presume, it would not be a hard matter to get
support from the authorities in the way suggested.
57. Do you think the services of a practical biologist would assist matters? No; judging from our own
experience in that direction, I cannot say that the appointment of such an officer would help the fishermen
very much, if at all.
58. That is strange, as we have evidence from all parts of the world as to the value of the services of
biologists—On the coasts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and the Baltic, the supply of fish has been
multiplied two or three fold by the adoption of measures recommended by biologists ? Tes; but in
that case you are dealing with a very different thing. The fish spawn is very large, and can be seen with
the naked eye, so that there is no trouble in securing it. I went to America in order to see the fish
hatcheries of that country. They are as simple as AB C, but are not suitable for pearl-shell cultivation.
59. If biologists have managed to secure increased production of fish in the places I have mentioned,
surely that is evidence that science is of some assistance to any industry ? Scientists have helped in
that industry.
60. Fishing has been carried on there for the last 300 or 400 years—indeed, from very early civilisation,
but the pearl-shell fishing is a new industry, and these waters have not been fished before ? That is so.
It may be possible, of course, to assist the industry in that way by propagating the shell, but, personally,
I do not see how it can be done.
61. We should like to know from your experience what chance there is of success attending such
experiments ? I can only speak from the experience we have had, and from that experience I say there
is no chance of success. If there was a reasonable prospect of success being achieved from such an
experiment, we should be one of the first to agree to making it, because the possibilities in the way of
profits are very great.
62. If au area was granted on a small island where a white man with his family could make a permanent
home for himself, and the lease of an extended area of pearl-shell ground was made legal, would it not
be possible for him to work at a reasonable profit ? Notunless he went afield, as we are doing. He
would not get any return off his own area. The only way in which he could get a return would be by
going out to sea, bringing in small shell, and putting it on his own area, and allowing it to grow to a
proper size.
63. But that is possible ? Tes, we have done that ourselves.
64. Then it is possible for an energetic white man to engage in the industry profitably in that way ? A
small man could not do it. We tried it first with a sailing vessel. We had a boat built for the purpose,
a boat called the “ Pilot,” which we afterwards sold to the Government, and we found that we could not
bring the shell in alive. Other people on Thursday Island tried it too, and they did not succeed. They
put wells in their luggers, but none of them succeeded. We subsequently got a steamer built in Sydney,
put stroug pumps in her, and trays in her hold on which we spread the shell, and that was an absolute
success. We brought in shell in that way, and Ido not think we lost more than 2£ per cent, of it.
But a sailing vessel was found to be unsuitable for more reasons than one. For one reason, when the
weather is calm it takes a long time to gel in, aud that delay is fatal to the shell. Again, the pumping
of water out of the vessel was done by hand labour, and when refilling the water was allowed to flow in.
65. What is your opinion as to the minimum depth at which pearl-shell will mature ? I should think
it would mature in a fathom of water.
66. That would make the w r ork very simple for a white man with energy ? If he brought the shell in
and put it in shallow water ; but he has got to get it out of deep water.
67. He could be assisted by a Government vessel in Torres Strait to carry the spat ? That would be a
help to him, but it will not be found to be a very practicable scheme when you come to carry out details.
68. That is one of the changes which are contemplated p The position is this: The area worked by
pearling boats is very large. Tou may have one boat 100 miles from another, and you would have to
visit each boat daily, or every second or third day, to take the shell to their homesteads or selections,
because the shell will not keep long after it is taken out of the water. It would have to be kept over the
side of the boat in nets, and the steamer would have to have a well in her. The shell would not live
more than a few hours on deck.
69. Not large shell? No—young shell. It would be dead inside twelve hours.
70. I think that in some reports made on the artificial culture of pearl-shell, the young pearl is invested
with a longer existence than that ? If put on the vessel’s deck in the morning at 6 o’clock it would be
dead before night, without a doubt. There is no doubt in my mind about that. We brought in 120,000
shells from deep water, so that we have had some experience in that matter.
71. Is it your opinion that the existing conditions under which the pearl-shell industry is carried on are
not capable of improvement ? I would not like to say that without giving more thought to the subject.
72. Tou have had a long experience in the industry ? Tes ; and Ido not know of any way of improving
it in the direction indicated, as I said before. Of course the spat will increase in an area if it is effectively
closed down, but it takes a very long time for that to come about.
73. With a view to conserving the industry for the white race, what initial steps would you recommend ?
When you speak of the white race, is it not the white race that benefits from the industry now?
74. Tou can hardly say that, when the Japanese derive all the benefit? They do not derive all the
benefit.
75. Could not the very large benefits now derived by the Japanese be conserved for our own race ? It is
quite possible you could do that if you could make it worth a white man’s while to engage in the industry.
But the white man is not going to pngago in the work upon the conditions under which the Japanese
work. We hear of Japanese making £2OO or £3OO per man per year, but Ido not give any credence to
that at all. An occasional man may make that amount if he gets bold of a valuable pearl; but, on an
average, the divers will not make £lOO each per annum. A white man would be very foolish to take up
4
MINUTES or EVIDENCE TAKEN BEEOEE THE PEABL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAIi COMMISSION.


that class of work with the prospect of . only making £lOO a year. It is very hard work, with a
considerable risk of death. So far as the Japanese are concerned, they are quite at home in a pearling
boat. They belong to the fisherman class in Japan, having very likely been born and bred on a junk, and .
the money they make here, even if it is only £lOO a year, is very much more than they can make in their
own country. The work is very attractive to them ; but, under existing conditions, Ido not think it is
worth while for white men to engage in it. The Japanese work from daylight to dark for seven days a
week in order to make the money they do now, and they work jolly hard, too—harder than the average
white man would work at that game.
76. When I speak of white divers, I have in view a family of two or three brothers taking up a station
such as we wish to try and establish—One of the brothers might become a diver, and dive for the shell
on the family station ? Ido not think there is enough in it to make it worth their while. Of course it
would depend upon the amount of support you could give with ft Government steamer. If you could
put a steamer such as you are building at the disposal of half a dozen men, and bring shell to their areas,
it would pay them all right, if you did not charge them for it.
77. But we must treat all shellers alike—lt would be giving a great advantage to those half dozen men
if the others were left to fight their own battle ? If there were any great number of them you could not
do it. If you had men at Deliverance, others down the Gulf of Carpentaria, and others 50 miles to the
eastward, and you had to take shell to all their areas, such a scheme would not be practicable.
78. Then it is your opinion that the industry cannot be carried on by the white race unless it is sub-
sidised by the Government ? That is my opinion. The price of pearl-shell would need to be very much
higher than it is before it would he worth white men’s while to take it up.
79. By Mr. Bennett: What is it worth at present? Darnley Island shell is bringing £ll5, and Old
Ground shell £l3O to £135 a ton.
80. That is “A ” shell ? No; just average shell. The Darnley shell we are getting now is not so good
as the shell from the Old Ground.
81. Ton are not interested in Thursday Island shell now ? No.
82. By the Chairman: Are you of opinion that a subsidy would prove an incentive to white men to
engage in the industry? It would depend upon the amount of the subsidy. If it was a substantial one,
I believe it would prove.an incentive
83. What would you call a substantial subsidy ? I think it would want to be £5O a ton at least.
81. By Mr. Bennett: That would bring the value of the shell up to about £lBO a ton ? Yes. But do
you mean that the diver would have to employ a white tender and crew ?
85. By the Chairman : Tes ? Then the subsidy would have to be £lOO a ton.
86. He would certainly make a success of it then ? lam sure that live out of six would not.
87. Such an exorbitant subsidy as £lOO a ton would lead to laziness —they would do nothing at all ?
Don’t you believe it. It would take a man all his time to pay for wages and tucker even at that.
88. That is far in excess of the sugar bounty ? Ido not know. They get a very big bounty on cane.
89. By Mr. Bennett : In the Bundaberg district the bounty is 6s. 6d. a ton on cane—That is only
intended to equalise the difference between the rates of pay for white and black labour ? What do they
get for cane ?
90. Ten shillings a ton ? Then out of the 16s. 6d. a ton they get for cane they get 6s. 6d. a ton from
the Government. A subsidy of £lOO a ton on pearl-shell would be in about the same ratio if the shell
were sold for £230 a ton.
91. By the Chairman : But the price fluctuates—You have no guarantee that the shell will maintain its
present price ? It will not go much below £l3O a ton. The shelier would get £l3O a ton in
London and £lOO a ton from the Government.
92. I think it would become a very attractive walk of life ? No, it would not. The average white man
would probably not get 3 tons of shell in the year; and, allowing for his wages, tucker, and the upkeep of his
boat, he would not have much left. The upkeep of his boat and diving gear would cost him £lOO a year.
93. By Mr. Bennett: You said that some of your difficulties were connected with labour? Shortage of
labour.
91. When did those difficulties begin to be acutely felt? When the Federal Government passed their
Immigration Restriction Act. Prior to that the State Government met us whenever we wanted men,
and allowed us to introduce them.
95. Have the Federal Government not granted you concessions in that way ? Yes, to a limited extent;
but under a very heavy bond. The bond was so heavy that we could not afford to take the risk with a
big lot of men. '
96. Apart from the question of the bond, did you experience any difficulty in obtaining labour after the
Federal Government took control of the introduction of immigrants ? We had no difficulty at all in
inducing labour to come to us from outside Australia.
97. Were you ever short of the labour that you actually required—Federal Government or no Federal
Government? Most assuredly we were. We were practically short of labour all the time after the
Immigration Restriction Act came into force. We might consider ourselves short of labour when we
had practically to go down on our hands and knees to get a darkey to work for us.
98. By the Chairman: What nationality do you refer to ? Any of them. There is a mixture at Thursday
Island. A large proportion of them will not work. They live on the islands and on the islanders, and
do not work. If there had been any means of forcing those men to work, there would have been
suffich nt labour for the industry.
99. By Mr. Bennett: You stated that one of the reasons which compelled you to shift your ground was
the decline in the output of shell —When did that decline begin to be pressing? In 1905 —the year we
shifted —there was a considerable falling off.
100. When did the falling off really begin to make itself felt? The take varied greatly from time to
time. More shell was got last year than was obtained ten years ago. According to the Government
returns, the average per boat in 1898 was 3 tons 10 cwt. For 1907 it was 4 tons 4 cwt.
101. Do you remember what was the highest catch ? The record year was 1897, when we exported
1,233 tons.
102. That was the year after the reduction of the limit from 6 inches to 5 inches ? Yes ; but the year
prior to the reduction of the limit we exported 1,085 tons, so that it did not make very much difference—
only about 150 tons.

minutes of evidence taken before the pearl-shell and beche-de-meb royal commission.


F. Munro.
:>A Kay^l9oB.
103. By the Chairman : To what do you attribute the improvement last year ? Largely to favourable
% weather conditions, and also to the fact that some new grounds were found to the eastward, and to the
3. men working in the deep water round about Darnley Island; but it was mostly due to the favourable
weather conditions.
101. By Mr. Bennett: How many boats were employed? The pump boats numbered 108.
105. What was the number in 1897 ? The total number given for that year was 223.
106. By the Chairman: In referring to the number employed last year, do you include those engaged in
your operations at Aroe Islands ? No ; those statistics refer to Torres Strait.
107. There has been a rumour abroad that Torres Strait was deserted last year, and that there were only
eight or ten boats left there ? No ; we took away about half the fleet.
108. By Mr. Bennett : Taking the record of the catch of shell, has there not been, on the whole, a steady
decline from 1897 ? Oh, yes; though we went up again in 1899 to 1,200 tons. Then it came down to
1,060 tons. During three years we got 900 tons ; and in the year following that in which we left the
boats were reduced by one-half. According to Government statistics, 567 tons of shell were obtained
last year. If we had had our boats there, and the take had been on the same basis as that, the total
take would have been over 1,100 tons.
109. Have you any warrant for assuming that if your boats had been there the average take would have
been 4 tons per boat ? Tes; I have this warrant—that our boats have generally averaged very much
more than other boats at Thursday Island.
110. With regard to Friday Island Passage, can you remember about what quantity of shell was put
down by the “ Billy Barlow” and the “Pilot ” ? As far as I can recollect, it was about 120,000 shell.
111. Do you remember what was taken up? No ; but I would bo right in saying that we took up less
than two-thirds of that quantity, so that, instead of having an increase, we had a very big decrease.
112. Friday Island Passage was one of the first passages fished round there, was it not ? Tes ; it was a
natural shell bed. That was why we chose it for our experiment. I was informed that originally they
took 70 tons of shell out of it. It is a very small area, so that the shell must have been very thick
indeed.
113. By the Chairman : I believe that is a fact? Tes; and we could not have gone to a better place for
our experiment.
114. A tidal current existed there then, did it not ? Tes.
115. There has been no change in the natural conditions, and how do you account for the result of your
experiment ? Ido not know, lam sure.
116. By Mr. Bennett: Had that passage been left alone, and simply rested, do you think that, under
natural conditions, without restocking, it would have recuperated within a reasonable number of years ?
No ; the shell would have increased a little ; but, in order to stock it up to any extent, you would have
had to lay down a good lot of shell and close it up for a good many years.
117. What was the size of the shell you put down there ? Mostly shell under 5 inches, but a few larger
shell —5J inches, and some 6 inches.
118. And you left them down about three years or longer? Tes, somewhere about that—l forget the
exact time.
119. Do you remember what progress the shell had made ? It had not grown very much, and that was
rather a surprise to us. We kept some of the shell uuder our eyes. We put it in comparatively shallow
water, a couple of fathoms deep, where we could pick it up easily. We had the shell marked with
numbers, took it up occasionally and measured it, and kept a record of its growth. The shell did not
increase very much in diameter, but they increased in weight.
120. Might not the taking of them up and putting them down again have interfered with their growth ?
Ido not think so, because they were not hurt in any way. If they had been kept on the boat’s deck any
length of time, that might have checked their growth.
121. By the Chairman: Would it not be possible for a shell of the diameter you mention to retain life
longer than a day ? Not a young shell.
122. For how long do you think a shell will continue to grow? I think a shell will keep on growing for
fifty years approximately. It might possibly keep on growing for 100 years, but 1 think lam safe in
saying fifty years.
123. It will not continue to increase in circumference ? No; but it will increase in weight. Probably
it will reach its maximum circumference in five or six years —it will depend upon the ground in which it
is grown. Some places grow shell quicker than others. After it has reached its maximum circum-
ference it will go on increasing in weight or thickness of shell.
124. By Mr. Bennett: What were the wages paid to coloured crews, including divers and others, up to
the time you left Torres Strait? The wages and food ?
125. What do you reckon is about the cost of working a boat, including upkeep, diver’s wages, and all
extras ? From £5OO to £550 a year.
126. Does that include diving gear and everything ? Tes ; but not depreciation or interest on capital.
127. Nor insurance? No.
128. That would be about the minimum cost at which a boat can be run without allowing for depreciation ?
Tes.
129. And without allowing for insurance ? Without allowing for insurance, interest on capital, or
depreciation.
130. With those items added, the cost might be put down at £6OO ? Tes.
131. If ITemember rightly, the insurance is 4 per cent.? Tes, 4 per cent, at least. That would be
another £2O a year, and depreciation would amount to 10 per cent., or £5O.
132. By the Chairman : Rather a small amount for depreciation ? Tes, but we spend money in repairing
boats every year.
133. By Mr. Bennett: Have you any boats at all engaged in the Torres Strait fisheries? No; none at
all. We hope to have some shortly, though. When we went away from Torres Strait, that gave the
grounds a very good rest; but we did not expect that advantage would bo taken of our going away to
exploit new country and find now areas, and that we would be blocked from coming back.
134. By the Chairman : Were you giving the ground time for recuperation when you went away ? That
was not primarily our intention. We went across to the East Indies because we heard that it would be


more profitable to work there for the time being, but we were more or less in doubt about the matter,
as we did not know the extent of the country. As a matter of fact we made a mistake in taking all our
fleet there. We should have taken only a portion. We have found that there is not sufficient ground to
employ all our fleet, and for that reason we want to get a portion back to Torres Strait. I do not
think it is fair for the Government to refuse licenses now when there are only 10S pump boats working,
whereas previously there were 210 boats working.
135. Is the shell obtained at the Aroe Islands of the same commercial value as the shell at Torres
Strait ? No ; it is not of the same value by reason of the defects in it, but it is of the same quality.
136. The impression is that it is more brittle ? It is not quite such good_shell as that on the Old Ground,
137. By Mr. Bennett : Is it as good as the Darnley shell ? Yes.
138. I suppose it is of the same nature ? Yes.
139. By the Chairman : Pearls are more numerous there ? That was our first experience ; but we have
not got much in the way of pearls lately.
140. That would indicate that there is something more congenial to the growth of pearls, would it not —
Is it mud? No. The bottom is very similiar to that of Torres Strait, so far as lam able to judge. In Torres
Strait there are places where there are practically no pearls at all, and in other places, where the
Japanese are working, it is very pearly ground. That is away to the eastward of The Sisters and those
places.
141. It is very deep water there, is it not ? Yes.
142. By Mr. Bennett: To the westward of The Warriors it is very good ground, but not to the east-
ward ? No. The percentage of pearls there is very much greater than on the Old Ground ; the Japanese
have been working there of late, because they get all the pearls. The old ground, consequently, has had
a good spell since we left, and I think that when the boats get on to it they will do very well.
143. Was not one of the difficulties that employers experienced due to the unsuitablencss of divers from
the point of view of physique—Until they were tried, the employers had to take the risk ? Yes, but
practically we never engaged a diver until he had been tried. We engaged men as a crew, and a man’s
countrymen taught him. He learned in a few days ; and, if he showed any prospect of being able to get
shell, we engaged him as a diver.
144. By the Chairman -. Have you ever employed white divers ? We had a few twelve or fifteen years
ago. I notice, from the official records, that there were thirty-four white divers in 1890.
145. By Mr. Bennett-. Do the returns mention whether they were divers or persons in charge—the
licenses covered both? No. They are put down as white divers. The returns are more or less
misleading, for this reason; When I first went to the Strait 1 took out a diver’s license—l forget the
exact reason, but I think it was in order that I might be in charge of a boat.
146. So that probably some of those licenses were for men in charge of boats ? Possibly, although these
thirty-four are put down as divers. In another case the number is put down at eleven.
147. When I began to compile the returns I distinguished between divers and persons in charge ? In
1897 there were eleven white divers and eleven white persons in charge. Another respect in which the
returns are misleading is in connection with the quantity of shell obtained for each boat. Swimming
boats are sometimes engaged in getting beche-de-mer, and that fact is not taken into account when
comparing the catch of the swimming boats with the catch of the pump boats.
148. Would it not be very difficult to compile correct returns, distinguishing between the actual take by
pump and swimming boats ? You could not do it. At the best you could only give an approximation.
149. By the Chairman: The beche-de-mer fishery was not a recognised trade in Torres Strait until
recent years, was it ? Yes.
150. By Mr. Bennett: The two industries have always been associated in the various Acts passed ? Yes.
151. By the Chairman: Before the inception of the pearl-shell business, Sydney vessels used to fish for
beche-de-mer at Bampton Island, but the greater allurements of the pearl-shell trade caused them to
forsake the beche-de-mer until very recent years ? The average take of pearl-shell per boat last year
was the highest since 1897.
152. You attribute that to the prevalence of fine weather ? Very largely.
153. By Mr. Bennett: Pine weather, particularly at the end of the year, I suppose ? Last year they had
it very fine for the first six months of the year—moderate north-west weather, and the south-east weather
was a long time coming in.
154. Do you think it would be any advantage to the industry if a school were established at Thursday
Island for the training of European divers ? 1 certainly do not think so, unless you make it worth while
for white men to engage in the industry. At present it is not worth their while.
155. Have you any idea of the remuneration of divers in Torres Strait at the present time? I can only
speak from hearsay, as I am not interested there now.
156 By the Chairman : You stated that their earnings did not exceed £lOO a year ? That is the divers’;
but the system they have of paying now is different to the system in force when wo were there. They
pay a diver now about £BO a ton for his shell, and he pays for everything. It is practically a method of
getting round the Act, which says that no boat shall be leased to an alien.
157. Are you in favour of amending the law to prevent such evasions? Ido not know. lam not
personally interested just now.
158. But we want your opinion, based upon your experience? I do not know. The present system
gives the employer less trouble. The diver engages his own crew, and he is careful with the tucker and
the gear.
159. Exactly ; but it is a grievance not altogether confined to Queensland that the coloured races derive a
very great benefit which might be kept for our own race—One of the reasons for this inquiry is to see
whether some means cannot be devised for altering the present state of things ? There are some
products that it is not worth our while to work—it costs more to produce the article than it is worth.
The industry can afford to pay a black-labour wage, but it cannot afford to pay a white-man’s wage.
160. Taking a wider view of the question—What about the cry of “Australia for the whites’’ ? lam not
altogether in accord with that. 1 would not like to see our country overrun by, coloured people, and I
would not allow them to come in except under restrictions ; but I do not think for one moment that the
Northern part of our country will ever be opened up with white labour.
161. Do you think that black labour is indispensable for the preservation of the industry ? I do.

. IG2. That is if it is to be a productive industry? Yes; that is to say if a large bonus to make it worth
white men’s while to go into it is not practicable.
38.1G3. This is the first time that has been suggested ? One goes with the other. It is necessary, under
existing conditions, that black labour should be employed.
161. Your reply is simply applicable to the granting of a subsidy by the Q-overnment? Yes.
165. By Mr. Bennett-. Up to the time you left Thursday Island what was the average rate per ton paid
to divers ? "We paid from £lB to £3O per ton. You could put the average at about £25.
166. Then a man would have to raise at least 4 tons of shell a year to make £100? Yes. A white man
would have to be paid double that rate before it would be worth his while to look at it.
167. During those years some boats got as high as 7 or 8 tons—that was the highest I ever heard for one
boat? Yes; although Mr. Milman, in his report for last year, speaks of a boat getting 12 or 15 tons.
But she would have three or four divers on board. The Japanese will work that way, but white men
would not.
168. Possibly she might have had two or three boats working for her ? That has been done, too.
169. But the highest catch that could be expected with one diver would be 7or 8 tons ? Yes; and they
could only get that by working in water so deep that the risk of death to the diver would be very
considerable. lam referring to the Darnley ground.
170. Was ever such a catch as that taken in the Old Ground ? Yes; in the early days. Even in the last
fifteen years we got more than 7 tons per boat on an average over our whole fleet.
171. By the Chairman : How does the catch of the white diver compare with that of the coloured diver ?
Ido not know that a comparison has ever been made. Of course, fifteen years ago white divers were
employed there, and it might be possible to procure the information. My own opinion is that the
Jap. works so hard that he gets more shell than a white man does —he works seven days a week.
172. Probably he has got a stronger incentive than a white man? There were white men there
originally.
173. So far as I know, there were no white divers employed in the early seventies —When do you say
those thirty-four white divers were employed ? In 1890.
174. Do the records discriminate between a diver and a man in charge ? Later on they do. In 1897 the
record mentions “ divers” and “ men in charge.” '
175. Is it not possible that there may have been men in charge who were designated divers ? Some of
them were so designated.
Pekcival Pitman Outridoe, Pearl Sheller, examined :
176. By the Chairman-. The principal matter to be dealt with by the Commission is to secure the pearl-
shell industry for white men—Can you inform us what is the best way to accomplish that object ? I
am of opinion that it will be a very difficult matter, and I have had experience of both white and coloured
8. divers.
177. Do you think it is practicable to carry on the industry successfully with white labour ? Ido not
think so, judging from my experience. The life is very uncongenial, the work is very hard, and living
in the boats is not desirable. As you are aware, they are small boats, and they are not comfortable, and
to make the industry profitable men have to work very hard.
178. Do you think it is practicable for young men of, say, eighteen years of age, who have passed a
medical examination showing that they are physically fit for the work, to be trained there and to become
successful divers ? Yes, but not every man.
179. Ho, not every man—l say men selected after undergoing a medical examination like that which men
entering the navy have to pass ? Yes.
180. Under those conditions do you not think the industry could be carried on successfully by white
men ? They could procure the shell, but not profitably from an owner’s point of view.
181. Do you share Mr. Munro’s opinion that to make the industry remunerative it would be necessary
to pay a bounty ? Certainly, or to make the men owners, not employees. Give them a boat, or let them
acquire a boat of their own.
182. Suppose there is a company of three or four white men ? I am afraid that would not work. The
diver on a boat must be the captain, and if there were three or four in a company I am afraid they
would not agree.
183. But they might have more boats than one, and the captain of a boat might not necessarily be a
diver—there might be one trained diver, and three or four assistants ? Yes, that is possible. I was
speaking of one boat and a diver.
The Chairman : My remarks refer to a desire which exists among some men to make a permanent
home on some island, and those remarks are not spontaneous, but are suggested by correspondence on
which I have reported at various times. It has been suggested by residents on Thursday Island. I
think Mr. Milman has suggested it in his last report, and I was present when Mr. Parquhar came down
from Thursday Island and made the suggestion to the Premier.
Mr. Munro : You will want to be careful in granting extended leases, or the grounds may bo locked
up by a few people, and other people will be prevented from working them.
184. By the Chairman -. What is the area at present allowed ? Witness : Not more than 25 miles of
coast land.
185. Are there not sand islets distributed over the area from the Barrier Beef right through Torres
Strait where they could be allowed extended leases ? The shell might not mature on those islets.
186. There are three or four blocks —one over at Warrior Reef, and two outside Thursday Island and
Mobiaug Island ? If you leased Warrior Reef, you would lease the most valuable reef in the Strait. It
was on the Warrior Reef that they first started pearl-shell fishing in the Strait. The beche-de-mer
fishers there picked up shell when fishing for beche-de-mer. But you were talking about giving an islet
to a white diver.
187. What I mean, is sufficient laud for him to make a comfortable home ? He could make a home on
it; but he would have to go out into the waters to make a living.
188. Quito so ; there are 5,000 Scotch fishermen coming to New South Wales; their employment will be
on the sea, but each is to be provided with a grant of land, so that he may combine farming with fishing ?
lam afraid that would develop into a lot of beach-combing in the Strait. I think the idea of instructing
white divers is a good one. It will certainly give us an opportunity of seeing what they can do.

189. Tou think success will be assured P I will not say that, but it will be an experiment in the right
direction. lam of opinion that a bonus might be given to the white divers. When I say white divers
I would limit the white men to the diver and the tender, and lot the crew be coloured men. That is, the
captain and the mate should bo white men, and let them earn the bonus under those conditions. ‘
190. That is not a way out of the difficulty we have to contend with ? lam afraid that to have a whole
crew of white men is impossible, even working on the share system.
191. The object of this Commission is largely to see if the industry cannot be secured to the white races?
It would be a very desirable object to attain, if it is possible.
192. Can you not suggest some means by which that object can be attained ? I think something might
be done in the matter of leasing. Ido not know about extending the grounds to any greater extent. I
think that 21 or 25 miles of coast line is a fairly large area. Under the present conditions one person
can take up 21 or 25 miles
193. To speak of 25 miles of coast is rather ambiguous—How far do you go out to sea ? Three miles.
We took up an area of 72 miles.
191. Tou are referring to the length of coast line, not to the area ? Tes.
195. Is not 3 miles seaward the extra territorial limit ? One of our men, Mr. Hockings, appealed
against his income tax assessment, and the Full Court decided that income derived outside the 3-mile
limit was not taxable.
196. By Mr. Bennett : What do you reckon is the average working life of a diver? I should say about
ten years’ hard work.
197. As much as that? I think so. I speak of shallow water diving. We have never worked in deep
water. We have never lost a man through deep-water diving.
198. Working at how' many fathoms ? Ten to 12 fathoms.
199. Ten years would be a good average, would it not ? Tes. That would militate against white men
taking up the work of diving. In connection with deep-water diving, I would like to recommend that a
reward should be offered for improvements in deep-water apparatus and diving dress.
200. By the Chairman : Have you any recent information from England regarding the diving at the
breakwater being constructed by the Admiralty at Dover, where divers remain down six or seven hours ?
I knew 7 of a white diver in our employ who wont down when the sun came up, and he did not come to
the surface until the sun w r ent down. He did so to see how he felt afterwards. He left our employ and
went to work on the Darnley ground afterwards, and succumbed from diving in deep water. White men,
having greater intelligence than the coloured men, would be able to work even in deep water.
201. Are you aware of any improvements in the diving dress ? Ho; but numbers of attempts have been
made to improve it.
202. By Mr. Bennett-. I suppose most of those attempts have been brought under the notice of your
company? Tes. We tried a number ourselves. It might mean an expenditure of £l,OOO without
securing any adequate return. Our experiments ran to nearly that amount.
203. By the Chairman : Are not the dresses manufactured by Messrs. Siebe and Gorman undergoing any
improvement ? Practically none for half a century. There have been minor improvements. We use
Heinke’s dress. He is a London maker.
204. Does it show no improvement ? Practically none, except minor improvements—nothing to enable
a man to get down to a greater depth.
205. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know whether he has attempted to overcome the difficulty of water
pressure ? I think not. It seems possible to me.
206. And neither have Siebe and Gorman ? I think not.
207. Have you any other suggestions to make? Tes. When Mr. Munro was giving his evidence
something was said about the spat not settling, and the suggestion was made to block Friday Island
Passage.
208. By the Chairman : Hot to block it, but to take steps to retard the velocity of the tide ? I think
the flow of the tide is necessary for the successful growth of the spat. If there is no strong run of tide
a sediment will settle on the bottom —mud or sand —and the pearl-shell may not have what we call
“live ground ’’ or “ live bottom ’’ to thrive on. If the run of the tide ceases the shell will not thrive.
209. By Mr. Bennett : Can you instance any passages about the Prince of Wales Group in support of
that theory? Ho; but I can instance Princess Charlotte Bay. Most of the shell we found there was
almost entirely covered with mud, and a lot of the fish were dead.
210. Can you mention any passage or passages in the Prince of Wales Group where there is a strong
tide and the shell has fairly well maintained its average annual yield ? Ho, I cannot.
211. What about Entrance Island Passage—Tou have the strongest tide there ? Tou can have too strong
a tide. lam inclined to think that the tide there is too strong.
212. But they always get shell there? Good shell has been found in Endeavour Strait, which is some
little distance from Entrance Island Passage; but the tide there is not so strong as in the narrow
passage itself. lam of opinion that a good run of tide is essential for the successful formation of spat,
but it may also be too strong.
213. By the Chairman : There is no great strength of tide in Princess Charlotte Bay ? Ho ; and that
emphasises my argument. There is sufficient tide there at times, but there is a tendency for the shell to
be covered with the mud that comes out from the rivers discharging into the bay, and some of the shell
ground there in our time was almost covered with mud. The divers discovered the shell by seeing the
round holes at the bottom of the sea.
214. In the rainy season the rivers emptying into the bay carry strong currents some miles out to sea P
Tes.
215. Is the covering of the shell due to the mud deposited by the rivers in the rainy season?
Tes. I also think it is necessary for the propagation of the pearl-shell oyster to have a certain amount
of fresh water. At the mouths of the large rivers shell has been found in large quantities. Starting
from Cooktown, there is shell just outside the Endeavour River, and in Princess Charlotte Bay there was
a large lot of shell.
216. Outside the Endeavour, at Cooktown? Tes, wo had a patch of shell there. We also got a few
shell just outside the harbour, but there was a fairly large patch near “ D ” reef.
217. That is outside the mouth of the Annan ? Tes, outside the mouth of the river. The whole of the
Strait has been supplied with fresh water, which comes from there.

218. The shell there is not good ? It is not good, tut it is prolific.
219. It is chalky ? Yes; I think that is accounted for by the nature of the bottom in which it is found,
i 220. Do you think fresh water is necessary for the propagation of shell? That is my opinion.
•221. By Mr. Bennett-. Is that your experience? Yes; and our experience at the Aroe Islands is
similar. The rivers flowing to the eastward run into sungis, as they are called.
222. By the Chairman-. Are not the sungis very small? No; they are fairly large. They are more like
passages between islands than anything else. Still, a lot of fresh water comes down there, and it is the
fresh water that is necessary for the growth of the shell. With reference to leases, I would like to
recommend that better protection be given under new leases than has been given in the past.
223. By Mr. Bennett: Protection from what P Prom the depredations of trespassers. Mr. Munro gave
you the history of the working of our experiment in Friday Island Passage. We started that experiment
under very difficult conditions. We had little or no information; we had to gain our knowledge by
experience, and then when we were likely to reap some benefit from our endeavours we were told that we
had no right to the area at all, and that anyone could go and work them. The Government then .stepped
in and proclaimed the area a reserve.
The Chairman : Those conditions are likely to be reconsidered, and I think a change can be looked
for.
224. By Mr. Bennett : I suppose you mean by protection that the lessees should be given power to
protect themselves ? Yes ; that they should be given absolute control of their property.
225. By the Chairman : You heard Mr. Munro say that, in his opinion, the services of a practical biologist
would in no way aid the development of the industry by collecting spat on scientific methods—ls that
your opinion ? Well, our experience has been that the scientific gentleman we engaged was of no
assistance to us. He really achieved nothing in the way of practically improving the industry.
226. By Mr. Bonglas : He was there only a short time ? He was there three years, and gathered a lot
of information, which might have been interesting scientifically, but commercially it was of no use to us.
227. By the Chairman : Where did he acquire his experience of the industry ? He had none until we
employed him.
228. Probably he had never been south of the line before ? I think not.
229. Do you think it is reasonable to suppose that a scientist who had never crossed the line before could
come here, and in a few months become familiar with the peculiar conditions of this industry ? He was
with us for three years, and he had every facility for carrying on his work.
230. By Mr. Bennett: He lived on the grounds ? He lived on the grounds, and everything he asked for
he had. He had a free hand.
231. By the Chairman : Did you derive any benefit from his labours ? None whatever.
232. Directly or indirectly? Directly or indirectly. We were expecting a book to be published by him,
but we have not seen it yet.
233. Have you lost the run of him altogether ? Ido not know what has become of him.
234. By Mr. Douglas : Did he provide you with reports ? He provided us with reports.
235. He published a report in 1900 or 1901, in which he said he had acquired a lot of information which
he had embodied in reports, but which he had not been at liberty to publish? We have not made any
use of ir. If it had been valuable from a commercial point of view, we would have made use of it.
236. Is it of no use from a scientific point of view ? That I am not in a position to say. Ido not
remember the contents of the reports.
237. I suppose you have Saville Kent’s book dealing with the Barrier Beef and its products ? Yes.
238. Have you derived any practical benefit from the perusal of that book ? Yes ; we took advantage of
what we call the cultivation conditions, or, as it has been called, the transference of shells from deep
water to shallow water. Mr. Munro gave you the history of our experiment in that matter, and it was
not profitable to us.
239. Was that before Mr. Pace came out? Yes. We hoped that Mr. Pace would have been able to
produce shell from the spat, or to secure the Meleagrina margaritifera; but we found that he was
able only to get the lingah or bastard shell, with a very small percentage of the true pearl-shell of
commerce.
240. By the Chairman : There was a report by Mr. Tosh—Have you ever perused that ? No, I have
not seen it. Mr. Tosh would start on the same conditions as our scientist started ?
241. I cannot say ? Ido not think he could have had any practical experience.
242. None whatever, until he came here ; but his ability is recognised in the mother country, for he is
now Professor of Biology in the University of St. Andrew’s ? I was informed by Mr. Pace that at
various museums they had not a specimen of the fish of the pearl-shell.
243. At St. Andrew’s ? No ; Kensington, I think, he came from, and he had not seen specimens of the
fish before he came to Queensland.
244. By Mr: Douglas: With regard to Mr. Pace, you said just now that he had every facility afforded to
him ? Yes.
245. In his reports he says the contrary ? Yes ?
246. For instance, he says : “ Owing to the lack of material at the periods of reproductive activity, I have
not been able to work out the embryology of the pearl-shell beyond the early segmentation stages.”
And in a footnote he adds: “ Although I have been stationed in Friday Island Passage, where shell is so
exceptionally abundant, my work since my arrival in the colony has been constantly interfered with by
the want of shell. Diving gear has, unfortunately, not been retained in the Passage for my use, and
Messrs. Clark and Co. have not been able to send in a boat whenever I have applied to them for shell” ?
We gave him every reasonable facility.
247. By the Chairman : Did he make any complaint at the time ? No. Shortly before he finished his
engagement we said we were not altogether satisfied with him, and I think he was himself disappointed
with his efforts. Our leasehold was in Friday Island Passage, and most of his time he spent on
Thursday Island. That was at the end of his career there. .We were just as enthusiastic as he was in
the matter, and more so.
248. Mr. Douglas: Mr. Pace also says —“ Friday Island Passage is rendered quite unsuitable for
experimental work by the existence of numerous shifting sandbanks, and the preponderance of soft mud
bottom” ?
10
MINUTES OP EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOEE THE PEAEL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAt COMMISSION.


'249. By the Chairman :He makes no reference there to the velocity of the tide ? Our practical
experience is in conflict with that statement.
250. By Mr. Bennett: "Was it your experience in Friday Island Passage that the sandbanks did shift ?
Occasionally. " ■
251. In the cultivation grounds there were practically no sandbanks? We lost some shell which was
put on a sandy bottom. The bank which extended from Friday Island to Prince of Wales Island did
shift in some places, and it formed a sandbank in the passage, and some shell was thereby destroyed ;
but the destruction was not to any appreciable extent. Further down in the west passage there is a large
sandbank off Friday Island. Friday Island was, I think, a good place in which to make the experiment.
252. By Mr. Douglas: It was a good place, because it was handy to Thursday Island, and could be
watched ; but the question is—Was it the most suitable place for cultivation purposes ? Other places,
perhaps better, could have been found, but there were largo quantities of shell found there shortly before
my arrival at Thursday Island, and that was sufficient to show that it was undoubtedly good natural
ground. A very large quantity of shell was taken out from that very small passage.
253. Do you not think the Government would be justified in making some experiments in cultivation?
I certainly think something might be done. Our company had a bitter experience.
254. But it is not fair to expect private companies to undertake work which would be of general benefit?
Perhaps the granting of a bonus for the artificial production of shell might induce private individuals to
go in for it; and, if a bonus xvere paid, the general public would be entitled to any information gained.
A fairly large bonus might induce some of them to start in a not very extensive way.
255. By the Chairman : What would you consider a reasonable bonus ? Say, £lOO a ton for 10 tons of
shell produced artificially. Then a good many more tons could be produced without any bonus at all. I
advocate the artificial cultivation of the shell with a view to doing away with the present expensive method
of raising shell by boat.
256. By Mr. Douglas : The expense of gathering the shell is very great, and, if it can be produced on
the foreshores by cultivation, the cost of production will be very small indeed, and then the shell need
not be raised until the market price warrants ? That was my object in recommending a fairly large
bonus for a comparatively small tonnage. A bonus of £lOO a ton up to 10 tons would only mean £l,OOO.
257. By the Chairman-. Supposing the Government employed a competent biologist to supervise the
artificial production of shell ? Ido not see any very great objection to that. Some good might result,
although we have not been successful so far, and we know of no others who have been successful.
258. Has any other firm tried the experiment ? Mr. Saville Kent tried, and evidently he was not suc-
cessful, because he has not gone on with it. His original investigations have not been continued. He is
making another start now after a number of years, so that it does not look as if his first investigations
were successful.
259. By Mr. Douglas : Of course a man could not acquire a knowledge of the scientific cultivation of
the pearl-oyster in a day —Do you think the Government would be justified in expending a sum of
£l,OOO a year for ten years in making scientific experiments ? I am of opinion that in ten years you
would be able to see whether the experiments would bo successful or not. So far the experiments
have not been successful. Perhaps sufficient time has not elapsed, but we cannot get away from the
fact that they have not been able to secure the spat as yet.
260. But there is no reason why they should not be successful ? I see none.
261. Success has been achieved with the edible oyster ? The edible oyster is very different to the pearl-
oyster. The edible oyster is far more prolific and hardier.
262. By Mr. Bennett-. And more easily moved ? Then the edible oyster has the power of congregating
in clusters, while each pearl-oyster is by itself.
263. So that there is no analogy between the two ? No.
264. By Mr. Douglas: Mr. Pace says the pearl-oysters sometimes congregate in a mass, the same as
edible oysters? He was deceived in regard to the shell. He thought it was the true Meleagrina
margaritfera, while it was the lingah or bastard shell.
265. By Mr. Bennett: What minimum length of coast line do you think could be profitably worked on
ordinary good shell country ? I have not thought about it. The Mua Passage would be a desirable
place. That is 3or 4 miles long by 1 mile wide in parts. 1 should say about 5 square miles.
266. If a person takes up a passage such as that and begins to lay down shell under the same conditions
as your company laid it down, how long would it be before he could hope to get any return from it ?
You mean putting down 4,5, or 6 inch shell ?
267. Four or five inch shell ? Three years at the very soonest. It would pay better to let it remain
longer on account of the shell increasing in weight every year; but it would be marketable after three
years.
268. Then it would take some time to stock such a passage with shell ? Certainly.
269. How long would it take, supposing he could get plenty of young shell ? In Mua Passage he might
work three months at the end of the year, and ho might get 2,000 or 3,000 shell a month. At the
maximum that would be 9,000 shell. He might get the same amount in the flue-weather months of
February and March. In a year’s work ho would probably not get more than 20,000 shell.
270. That would not nearly stock it ? Ido not think so, and in three years 20,000 shell would only mean
a little more than 10 tons if he raised the whole lot. Ho would require to have a good deal of capital at
his back.
271. In your opinion it would require a fair amount of capital to enter upon such an experiment ? Tes.
Probably it would be longer than three years before there would be any substantial return.
272. Even after the planting was completed ? Yes.
273. By the Chairman : Does that mean three years from the time the shell was laid down ? From the
time the shell was transferred, and that does not make provision for any increase. It would not do to
raise all the shell that had been planted.
274. By Mr. Bennett: When you raised the shell in Friday Island Passage you had to start laying down
again ? Yes. We raised the shell that had been transplanted there.
275. And you had not any appreciable quantity of young shell left ? Very few. Of course, we raised
everything we were entitled to take, with a view to giving it up,
276. That was all shell over 5 inches across at that time ? Yes.

277. You do not consider that sufficient shell was left behind to hold out any hopes of a natural increase
that would keep the passage going ? Very small. I share the opinion of Mr, Munro, that the spat
\ would come from other directions. Mr. Pace found out that for some time the spat floated on the
*• surface. He did not get it from the fish themselves.
278. What should be the extreme limit of coast lino in a lease ? I can hardly venture an opinion. The
area of 72 miles we had at Cooktown was of no avail to us. Wo paid the rent for a year or two, and then
gave it up. It depends entirely on what area there is suitable for the propagation of the shell.
279. Do you not think it would be better that the areas should be comparatively small, so that a
reasonably close watch could be kept over them ? I think that would he necessary.
280. In your opinion will pearling-ground, which has been pretty well depleted or exhausted, recover
itself ? I think it would in time.
281. A long time ? Well, no; I should say that if it was rested for a few years it would recover.
282. By “ rest” you mean complete rest ? Complete rest.
283. You would not have anyone fossicking on it ? Certainly not. I remember that the Endeavour
Strait was rested for some few years, and when we went back there it was very prolific in shell. That
was accounted for by a marine weed which grew at the bottom, and seemed naturally to protect the shell
which was left there, and the shell threw out spat.
284. By the Chairman : Was the weed peculiar to that place? It was peculiar to that place, but we
have also found weed on the Old Ground.
285. Of a similar kind ? Not of a similar kind —of a different character. The Endeavour Strait weed
was a heavier variety.
286. By Mr. Douglas : The weed has something to do with the growth of the shell? I think it has ; it
is a catchment for the spat, and a protection for the young shell. I think everyone recognises that the
pearl-shell has innumerable enemies. When it gets among the weeds it is protected, and the turtle and
other enemies cannot get at it.
287. By the Chairman : How would Princess Charlotte Bay do as a ground for propagation—it is
comparatively shallow ? The shell we got there was away out in the bay.
288. In shallow water ? In from 9 to 10 fathoms. That ground is recovering now.
289. By Mr. Bennett : It has not been worked since 1899 ? No; it has not been worked for a
considerable time; and I believe that if it was worked now it would be found that a considerable amount
of shell had grown there.
290. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the pearling-grounds have been overworked during the past few
years ? I think they have been.
291. And that the number of boats should be limited ? We advocated that some time ago.

Peecival Pitman Outeidge, Pearl Shelter, further examined :
292. By Mr. Douglas : Can you give us any expression of opinion as to how many boats the industry can
carry? No ; it depends upon the supply and demand.
293. But with regard to limiting the number of boats ? I would like to recommend, with a view to our
■ returning to the fisheries, if thought desirable, that boats which have been licensed should have the right
of renewing their licenses. But I would not recommend any more new licenses being issued. There is
some difficulty now in getting some of our vessels licensed, or relicensed, and I think that is unfair. I
think they should have the right to renew their licenses if they wish to do so.
291. By the Chairman : Are your boats registered now under the Dutch Government as Dutch vessels ?
Some of them; but, of course, those returning will be retransferred.
295. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you anticipate bringing some of your boats back again? Some of them.
Wo find that the Aroe Island ground is not so extensive as wo thought at first.
296. With regard to the question of white divers—I do not know whether you expressed your opinion on
that matter yesterday? 1 was questioned a little about it.
297. Do you not think it is possible that white divers might be employed gradually ? I do not say that
they cannot be employed.
298. There are a number of young fellows now growing up at Thursday Island —How are they going to
get into the industry unless they have some means of being trained as divers ?—They certainly will not
go out with the Japanese, and if they would no Japanese would teach any white young fellow to dive, and
there are very few white divers employed there at the present time —Do you not think the rising
generation should be given an opportunity to be trained as divers ? I see no opportunity tit present for
their being trained as divers. I was not aware that there were a number of young fellows available at
Thursday Island.
299. There are always a number of young fellows at any place who look to local industries for employ-
ment ? I am of opinion that if any young white men showed ability as divers there would be no diffi-
culty in their obtaining boats to work.
300. You cannot expect a young man to go out unless he has some means of acquiring the initial know-
ledge of diving; and if there are no white divers in the industry he will never have an opportunity of
obtaining that knowledge—even an alien in commencing diving has to go out in charge of some
experienced man ? Quite so.
301. And you will not get the present employers who employ none but aliens to bring any of the white
young fellows on ? I think my answer to that was that I saw no opportunity at present for the young
white men there to be trained as divers.

302. Do you know the system with regard to divers on which they are working at the present time at
Thursday Island ? lam not familiar with it. Others who are more familiar with the system can give
you evidence on that matter; hut 1 may say that I understand that the rightful owners of the boats get
none of the pearls under the present system.
303. By Mr. Bennett : That, of course, is the shore system? Yes. I submit that the rightful owners
of boats should have some share in the proceeds of the pearls.
301. By Mr. Douglas : There has been a proposal to limit the tonnage of vessels licensed in the trade to
25 tons —Do you think that is a good suggestion? Such a provision would shut out the licensing of the
big schooners, and I think it would prove a hardship.
305. By the Chairman : Do you think large schooners are necessary for cultivation and for the carrying
on of the pearl-shell industry ? Not so much for cultivation ; but it is necessary to have a large store
ship to go to distant grounds.
306. But it is not indispensable to the carrying on of the pearl-shell industry ? Under the system we
are working it is absolutely necessary to have a store ship and living accommodation for the officers.
307. Could you not substitute for the schooner a dep&t on shore ? That was the original scheme years
ago, but the scene of operations has since shifted from one ground to another. For instance, if we went
working down near Cooktown it would be very inconvenient to have a shore station on one of the islands
in Torres Strait. It would be almost impracticable.
308. It is complained that, with floating stations, some injustice may result to the men employed ? Ido
not think so; otherwise we would not be in favour with the men themselves ; they would shun us if we
treated them unjustly.
309. By Mr. Douglas: The intention in having a floating station is to ensure control oyer the fishery
generally ? Yes ; to be on the scene of the fishery.
310. And, of course, it assists to keep the boats together, and to ensure as large a return of shell as
possible ? Yes ; and to get the pearls, which is a very strong point with us. If we had no supervision
like that we would get no pearls at all, and the pearls would drift out of their right channel. A good
number do that at the present time.
311. But that system does not mean any permanent settlement, as a floating station can be shifted when
you please ? Quite so.
312. And you can go beyond the jurisdiction of the State ? When pearl-shellers do that they bring into
the State products which the State has no right or title to in many instances. If boats go beyond the
jurisdiction of the State, and bring in the wealth of the seas, so to speak, the State benefits by their
operations.
313. Is it the intention of your company, if they come back, to work under the old system ? I could not
say. I think we should have to do as Borne does, as far as I can see at the present time. But that is
only my opinion; I cannot say definitely what our intentions are.
314. Do you think the time is ripe to deal with the question of the Japanese having a practical monopoly
of the diving by limiting the licenses to divers? Well, I was always in favour of the licenses being
restricted. Years ago 1 advocated that; but, until some suitable labour is provided, Ido not see what is
going to be done if the industry is to be permanent and is to be benefited.
315. Do you not think that if the present owners of boats could get European divers they would have more
confidence in them than in aliens, aud that they would have a better chance of getting the pearls ? If the
right class of white divers were introduced, certainly; but the change must be brought about gradually
by evolution, not by revolution. If you suspended the engagement of Japanese at the present time,
there are no men whom you could substitute for them. My idea is to make it worth while for white
divers to come in.
310. You spoke yesterday about giving a bonus of £lOO per ton? Yes; that was for cultivation.
317. Not for shell obtained by white divers ? No; but I certainly think that if a bonus were given to
white divers—by that I mean divers, and not the whole of the crew—if a bonus of a certain amount
.were given to the white diver, apart altogether from his wages, that would be an inducement to white
people to engage in the industry. But lam afraid that if a white diver embarked in the industry he
would not stay at it permanently.
318. Supposing the present restrictions on the further issue of divers’ licenses were maintained, and no
more licenses were issued to aliens, what do you think would be the result? The result would be the
gradual extinction of the industry as far as diving is concerned. Some spasmodic effort might be made
to cultivate, but it would require a lot of capital to start a cultivation venture of any size. If white
divers are to be a success, it must be made worth their while to go in to stay, and present conditions are
not sufficiently favourable for them to embark in the industry. The conditions which existed when white
divers were employed some years ago were much more favourable than those which prevail at the present
time. The price of shell was higher.
319. How many years ago was that ? Ten years ago, I think. A number of white divers were engaged
then, but they gradually drifted out of the industry. At that time shell was fairly plentiful, and the
price was good, and divers did fairly well for a while, but they did not stay in the industry; they
gradually drifted out.
320. By the Chairman-. Was not their employment as divers rendered precarious by the advent of the
Japanese divers ? Not at that time. I think a good deal of the trouble arose from their not having
sufficient capital of their own. They started off with a boat which was purchased for them, and they
were in debt, aud they did not get the full results of their labour.
321. By Mr. Douglas : When did you first go to Torres Strait ? In 1882.
322. You have been connected with the industry ever since ? Yes.
323. In 1882 there was a number of white men engaged in the industry ? Not many. They were mostly
Botumah men and men from other South Sea Islands.
324. By Mr. Bennett : Maoris and some Norfolk Islanders ? Yes, and a few Fijians.
325. By Mr. Douglas: Do you recollect the price of shell at that time ? Ido not remember, but I think
the Island price was about £l2O per ton.
326. They were getting big catches ? Yes. They discovered the Old Ground a little while before that.
327. Supposing no aliens had been allowed at that time to get divers’ licenses, would it not have offered
sufficient inducement for white men to engage in the industry ? I suppose it would have tended that
way. But there would have to be a recruiting ground for white divers.

328. By the Chairman : If there was a gradual withdrawal of the Japanese from the industry, would it
not tend to attract white divers ? Ido not think so. There is not the inducement now that there was in
those days.
329. By Mr. Douglas: Not the same quantity of shell ? Not the same quantity of shell, and they have
to work harder for it now than they had in those days. I can remember that about 1886 or 1887 they
talked of the industry being unprofitable and worked out. That is a good while ago, and the industry is
not done yet
330. Ton must admit that the industry has been over-fished during the last few years P I think it has
been.
331. It was greatly for that reason that you had to go away to the Aroe Islands ? No, it was not. The
reasons were given very fully yesterday by Mr. Munro. There were greater inducements at the Aroe
Islands for us, and there were not the harassing labour conditions.
332. But the Federal Government allowed permits to be issued for any reasonable number of men that
were required ? We had very great difficulty in getting our boats’ complements in Thursday Island. We
were not allowed to get natives from the Eotumah Islands or from Fiji, because they were coloured, although
they were British subjects and very desirable persons from our point of view. If they had been engaged
in the industry I do not think there would have been the acute position there is at the present time with
regard to the Japanese; and the profits of the industry, instead of going to Japan, would have remained
in the State.
333. By the Chairman: Then it is really your opinion that the prohibition of the coloured diver will
endanger the existence of the industry? Unless other suitable divers are provided.
334. I mean if the Japanese are gradually excluded ? I have no great faith in white divers remaining at
the work, because it is so uncongenial.
335. Is it any more uncongenial than the precarious occupation of the digger in New Guinea, of the timber-
getter or the miner in North Queensland ? But they are on shore, and they can go about; but on a
boat they cannot do that.
336. Still the diver can make sure of three meals a day, which the unfortunate miner in New Guinea
cannot; and is it not possible that white divers would become inured to the life ? It is possible.
Eegarding New Guinea, if a miner were to ask ray advice about going to New Guinea, I would certainly
advise him not to go there, because New Guinea is undoubtedly an unhealthy country so far as whites
are concerned.
337. By Mr. Douglas-. The same might have been said of North Queensland some years ago ? Not to
the extent that it is true of New Guinea. Ido not think malaria is so prevalent in North Queensland as
it is in New Guinea.
338. By the Chairman : Of course, New Guinea is in its primitive state —no clearing —and I suppose they
live.on the beach ? North Queensland is farther from the Equator than New Guinea. I have six boys
born in Queensland, and I would not like to see one of them engaged in diving in a pearling boat.
339. But the Anglo-Saxon has proved his capacity to overcome many difficulties under the allurement of
gold ; and is it not possible that the same thing might operate in connection with the pearling industry ?
Ido not say the white man cannot do the work. He can do it, and do it well, if he will.
340. Of course, he requires a greater incentive than the coloured man ? I have explained my view of the
incentive to be offered in the way of graming a bonus.
341. You think the industry cannot be prosecuted with success by white men with a bonus of less than
£lOO a ton ? 1 have not thought on that subject. The suggestion I made was that a bonus of £lOO a
ton should be granted purely for the cultivation of the shell. Perhaps if a white diver and a white
tender were employed first in each boat, without making too drastic a change, it might act. The white
diver might be given a bonus apart altogether from the wages he earned.
342. I know your firm has induced several young Australians to go to the Aroe Islands to serve you in
various capacities—Now, if you succeeded in that —a fact which cannot be denied—is it not possible
to add to that number; the Australian is born with a little bit of the adventurous spirit ? But those
young Australians did not go as divers.
343. I know three or four of them who would offer no objection to going down in a diving dress —
Would it not be possible to get others to go in for diving if sufficient inducements were offered? They
can do the work, but the sticking at it is the trouble.
344. It is like sticking to any other occupation—the great inducement is the money ? The white
divers who were so successful in Torres Strait in the early days were very fine characters indeed. They did
not waste their substance in the hotels. They worked hard while they were there and did well, but
they left the industry as soon as ever they could.
345. Because they acquired what they considered a competence ? A great many of them did.
346. By Mr. Douglas : Of course some of them got into debt, and, when their catch went down, they had
to leave ? That was because they did not start as free men. They were in debt when they started.
347. Had not that something to do with their non-success ? Certainly. They did not get the full
profits of the industry.
348. By Mr. Bennett : I suppose they were going to the mortgagees ? A good deal was. Those who
were supplied with boats had to pay a profit on their boats, and they did not get the full price of their
shell when it was sold.
349. They had to dispose of their shell to the persons who found the money for them ? Certainly.
350. They had also to obtain their stores from them ? Quite so. Most of the profits went to the
middleman.
351. By Mr. Douglas: So that there was not much encouragement originally for white men? Not
under those conditions, though they got a good deal of shell.
352. By Mr. Bennett: In your floating station system the “ slop-chest” system entirely obtains in dealing
with the crews ? It generally obtains. It is absolutely necessary. I think the books were open to your
inspection when the crews were paid off. We set absolutely no store on the profits that we were alleged
to have made on the small amount of goods that were sold.
353. Are you aware whether the “ slop-chest” system obtains in the shore boats ? I should not think so.
The same difficulty does not arise there. The men have opportunities for buying what they want that
our men have not got.
14
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEB BOTAL COMMISSION,


354. It was stated yesterday that the floating station boats generally obtain a heavy percentage of
shell —Do you attribute their success to the closer supervision you are able to maintain through having a
floating station ? Undoubtedly, it is due to the closer supervision we are able to exercise over our men ,
and to our being able to work the ground systematically, whenever we are permitted to work by the 5
weather conditions.
355. Boats that are worked from the shore cannot possibly work as closely and continuously as boats
that are worked by floating stations ? They must lose a certain amount of time in going backwards and
forwards, so that I should not think they would be able to work so successfully as under the floating
station system.
350. You must have worked the shore system in your time? Yes.
357. What is the usual time taken before a boat requires to return to the shore again ? When I was
engaged in the shore boat system, a month was the outside time for provisions to be supplied ; and the
boat returned within a month for provisions and to land the shell. But I may say that they landed no
pearls at that time.
358. How long would it remain in port? Just a few days. If the weather conditions were not favourable,
or if the tides were strong, there would be no object in going out; or, if the boat required any repairs,
it would remain until they were completed.
359. When the boats came into port the crews had facilities for getting a little “ relaxation”—shall I
call it—and it was not always easy to get them to sea again ? It was very difficult sometimes.
360. So that, taking it altogether, it may be assumed that the shore boats work at a disadvantage as
compared with boats worked in connection with a floating station ? Yes
301. By Mr. Douglas-. But is it desirable, in the interests of the industry, that the beds should be
worked so closely as they are under the floating station system? I suppose it is desirable to obtain as
much shell as possible, in the same way as it is desirable to get as much g>>ld as possible out of a gold
mine. Whatever industry you are engaged in, it is only natural to try to obtain the maximum result.
362. But undoubtedly the beds have been depleted greatly owing to their being worked too closely ?
I do not think wo are responsible for that.
363. But the floating system, by means of which you are able to work the beds year in and year out
without having to return to Thursday Island for stores, is largely responsible for it ? We cannot work
year in and year out —the weather does not permit that to be done. My contention is that it is possible
to work more economically by means of the floating station system, and through being on the ground
ready to go to work as soon as the fine weather begins.
361. By the Chairman: Of course, your first consideration is to get all the shell you can ? Yes—to be
as successful as we can. And it must not be thought that we are too successful. There is not a very
great deal of profit in the industry from our point of view. We are credited with making a great deal of
profit, but that is not at all correct. We have made losses frequently on the year’s transactions. I think
there is more profit to the owner, with less trouble and less worry, under the system now in operation at
Thursday Island than there is by the way we worked the business. The Thursday Island men sit down
in their offices, and that is all they do. They receive the shell when it is brought in, and that is about all
the responsibility they have.
365. They employ Japanese to carry on the industry ? They employ Japanese to carry on the industry.
366. Do you think that system is deserving of perpetuation ? It is not a desirable system. I think ours
is a better system of working.
367. By Mr. Douglas : As a matter of fact, there is not much difference between the work and
responsibility of men working the industry from Thursday Island, where they sit in their offices, and the
work of men who are out on floating stations, because the men on floating stations do not do diving any
more than the men who sit in their offices? No ; but the men on floating stations are out at sea on
the fishing grounds, and the men who sit in their offices are not; and the men who go to sea partake of
the discomforts of sea life.
868. Do you think it is a desirable thing periodically to close any of the beds in Torres Strait? Yes, I
have advocated that, but the efforts which have been made in that direction have not been very successful.
I advocated the closing of Endeavour Strait, but it was not possible efficiently to patrol the Strait and
prevent poaching on the reserves.
369. By the Chairman: Would you advocate the closing of beds if there was a complete system of
patrol ? Certainly.
370. By Mr. Douglas : One of the main defects in the Act, so far as prosecuting men for poaching is
concerned, is that they have to be actually caught in the act of taking the shell ? So I understand.
371. Do you think that an amendment of the Act, to the effect that if a man is found with shell in his
possession he shall be liable to prosecution, would be effective ? That might prove a hardship. A man
might be in charge of a passing vessel which had shell on board, and ho would bo liable to prosecution,
so that such a provision would he open to abuse.
372. By the Chairman : But suppose there was shell on deck ? If the shell was new and fresh, it would
look as if the man had been working there.
373. By Mr. Douglas: There should be efficient patrol and a severe penalty ? I ■ admit that drastic
penalties are necessary.
374. A man might throw shell overboard, so that you must adopt drastic measures if areas are to be
closed, otherwise it would be better not to close them ? I would not recommend too largo areas to be
closed.
375. By the Chairman : What do you think is a sufficient area to close ? lam of opinion that it would
be a good thing to close Endeavour Strait for five years to see what would be the result at the end of
that period.
376. By Mr. Douglas : Are there any feeders to the Old Ground which you think might be closed?
It would be very desirable to give Wap pa a chance to recuperate, if possible. I advocated a part of
the east coast being closfd down to Hannibal Islands, or from Cape York to Cape Grenville. Ido not
think there is much fishing done there at the present time, but those grounds have been operated for
years. If those two grounds were closed, it would afford an opportunity of seeing whether the system
was likely to be successful. I know that we worked on the Hannibal Islands, and on returning after a
time we found that nice young shell had grown there, and it looked as if the grounds were picking up.
377. By the Chairman-. Were the grounds prolific at first ? Yes, the grounds were very rich at first.

378. How far south are those grounds from Thursday Island ? Cape Grenville is about 100 miles from
Thursday Island.
i 379. I think you said yesterday that some good shell had been found in Princess Charlotte Bay ? Tes,
'•and we got shell further south than that; when we were working those grounds, we got shell south of
Port Douglas.
380. And you recommend that a portion of that ground should be closed? I recommend the closing of a
portion, including the Hannibal Islands—from Somerset to Cape Grenville. That would not inflict
hardship on anyone. There are large quantities of shell in deep water at Cape Grenville that could
throw up spat, which would naturally drift north with the tide and settle on the ground that was ready
to receive it.
381. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that deep waters act as feeders to shallow waters ? lam decidedly
of opinion that deep waters act as feeders to shallow-water grounds.
382. With regard to the size limit of shell raised—at the present time it is 5 inches—Do you think it is
desirable to keep it at 5 inches ? Yes, I have always advocated the 5-inch limit, and I see no reason to
alter my opinion. If the limit were increased to G inches, the same abuses would crop up as existed
previously—that is, the raising of small shell for the sake of pearls.
383. Are there a large number of pearls found in 5 and 6 inch shells ? Tes ;we have found some very
valuable pearls in shells of 5 and G inches. I have some shells at home under 6 inches from which
valuable pearls were obtained.
381. Do you think divers raise shell under 5 inches ? Ido not think so. There is less likelihood of
pearls being found in smaller shell.
385. Are good pearls found in shells between 5 and 6 inches ? Tes ; the best pearls are often found in
what we call “ chicken” shell.
386. By Mr. Bennett : And in larger shells ? Tes. Ido not say they stop at G inches; but large shells
invariably produce nothing except blister and barrack.
387. By Mr. Douglas :Do shells over 6 inches eject the pearl ? Ho ; but from inches upwards they
do. I have always held the theory that the pearl grows very quickly and gets to a certain size, when the
fish cannot retain the pearl, and ejects it. My reason for coming to that conclusion is that we have never
got anything out of very old shell.
388. By very old shell you mean shell ten or twelve years old ? Or over—the old wormy shell. I think
the best pearls have been found in the better quality shell, and not in the very old shell. Of course,
good pearls may be obtained from blisters on very old shell. Another reason why I have come to the
conclusion that when the pearl gets to a certain size it is ejected by the fish is that it may be attached to
the shell, and the fish will then cover it over, .and it becomes a blister, apparently part of the shell itself.
We have got some very valuable blisters out of old shell, but the pearl has ceased to grow by the time
the shell has attained a certain size, and then instead of the pearl growing it has been buried in the
nacre of the shell. Pearls have been found by the manufacturers at home embedded right in the centre
of the shell. Those pearls must have been there when the shell was raised, but they escaped our eye,
and were sent away with the shell. When the manufacturers were working up the shell into various
ornaments, they discovered the pearls embedded right in the centre of the shell. I do not know that
many pearls are found under such conditions, but they are known to exist. But I would like to
emphasise the statement that I see no reason to change or alter the opinion I formed some years ago when
there was a controversy as to the size limit of shell to be raised. lam convinced that if we return to
the 6-inch limit the smaller shell will be raised for the sake of the pearls.
389. But supposing some regulation were framed dealing with the industry on something like the lines
of the “ Diamond Trade Ordinance ” of South Africa, and a man was required to account for any pearls
in his possession, and to show how he came by them, and there was a regulation fixing G inches instead
of 5 inches as the size limit of the shell —would those precautions prevent men raising shell purely for the
sake of pearl?. I doubt it very much.
390. Supposing a system of cultivation was adopted under which people could take up areas on the
foreshores, and which afforded them sufficient protection for their leases, would it then be desirable to
increase the limit ? Ido not think the lessee would export his shell unless it had reached the maximum
size. He would wait until the small shell grew big enough for profitable exportation.
391. It has been stated that the shell does not throw off reproductive spat until it gets a certain age ?
Tes, that has been stated. We have opened thousands and thousands of shell, and we have found that
very small shell indeed seem to throw off spat. There has been all the appearance of the spat being
ripe in shell down as low as 4 inches. With regard to old shell, my experience has been that the
fish inside has been very poor, not at all strong and vigorous, so that it is natural to suppose that the
best spat will be thrown off by the younger fish. The old worm-eaten shell appears something like the
edible oyster which is diseased; the fish is not at all strong and vigorous, and it has very little of the
white substance which makes the spawn or spat in the fish.
392. By the Chairman : Did your firm derive any practical benefit from the researches of Mr. Pace ?
None whatever. Yesterday we were asked if wo knew of any other experiments having been made in
cultivation.
393. Tes, I asked Mr. Munro if he had heard if success had attended the transplanting of shell to the
Eastern Pacific ? I understand that the shell was successfully transferred there, with a very small
percentage of loss, but whether they will thrive on that ground is another matter. My opinion is that
they will not.
394. I quite agree with you ; I think it is unreasonable to expect shell from Torres Strait to be success-
ful in the habitat of the black-edge shell ? I think the character of the ground on which the shell lives
has a good deal to do with the quality of the shell produced. I have shell at home from almost all the
pearling-grounds of the world, and that from the Torres Strait ground is undoubtedly the best. The
shell obtained a little further off, at Port Darwin, although the ground is in close proximity to Torres
Strait, is not equal in quality to the Torres Strait shell. The shell does not grow so large or so thick,
and its character generally is not so good as the shell at Torres Strait. The same thing may be said of the
shell at the Aroe Islands. It must be a different kind of feeding-ground there for the fish, for the shell is not
equal to the Torres Strait shell. Again, in the Egyptian pearling-grounds the shell is of a different
character altogether. The shell there seems to be half black and half white, and it is quite distinct from
the Torres Strait shell. Some of the shell obtained in the volcanic country, north-west of New Guinea, is
16
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER ROYAL COMMISSION.


also of a different character, and is not equal to the Torres Strait shell in my opinion. The different
quality of the feeding-ground is responsible for the different character of the shell produced. At
Tahiti we get the black-lip shell. The ground there is a very fine one for producing the black-lip shell,
and the shell is twice or three times the size of the Torres Strait black-lip shell, so that evidently the
Tahiti ground is more favourable for the production of that class of shell than the Torres Strait ground,
just as the Torres Strait ground is more favourable for the production of the gold and white lip shell.
395. What reason do you assign for the “ gold-lip” shell of Thursday Island not being found further to
the east than the Solomon Islands. —In the groups between the Solomons and Tahiti, with a similar
temperature and a similar formation —coral and volcanic —you only find the “ black-lip” shell ? Probably
there is no suitable ground for the “ gold-lip” shell there.
396. Tahiti has exported millions of shells—it was the first place in the Southern Hemisphere where the
pearl-shell beds were worked? lam informed that the Tahitian authorities are restricting the employ-
ment of pumps, so that the industry will remain in the bauds of the natives, and bo carried on by
swimming operations.
397. Then the “ gold-lip” shell is found again in the Bay of Panama ? The Panama shell is not equal to
the Torres Strait shell. It is of the same character, but it is not of the same quality.
398. But there is no “black-lip ” shell there ? We do not know what shell there is in the deep water
surrounding the shallow grounds. I think the feeding-grounds for the shallow beds are the deep-
water areas which have not been explored.
399. By Mr. Bennett : Have you any information regarding the habitat of the pearl-oyster as to depth ?
No, except the information that you may get at Thursday Island that it has been found at a depth of 35
fathoms. Some say it is found at a still greater depth, but Ido not know from personal experience, as
we have never worked in deep water. My experience in Western Australia was that the deeper the
water the more prolific the shell. We found a very rich bed of shell in King Sound. Up to 20 fathoms
the shell was not particularly thick or plentiful; but from 20 fathoms up, as far as the divers dared to
go, it was very thick indeed, and very prolific.
400. Hid you notice any difference in the character of the shell as the depth increased ? No.
401. I suppose you know the Darnley shell well ? Not particularly. We have never worked there.
402. Still, you know of it ? 1 understand it is more worm-eaten.
403. It is heavier, too, and thicker ? That is always the experience on new ground. The shell first found
is the original shell there. It is the very oldest shell. Probably the next crop taken off will be of a very
different character.
404. As a rule, the Darnley shell was thicker and heavier than the shell at Thursday Island, even at the
time you left? Then again, the Wappa shell was the best I ever saw, and that is found in comparatively
shallow water. I think the character of the ground has everything to do with the shell found on it.
405. Is it not reasonable to suppose that there must be a limit as to the depth at which the pearl-oyster"
is found ? It is reasonable to assume that that is so.
406. Ido not think that anybody knows what that limit is ? I have never heard of any being raised by
the “ Challenger” from the great depths at which she made soundings.
407. You do not favour a reversion to the old 6-ineh nacre limit for exportable shell ? No.
408. What is approximately the difference in weight between a 5-inch and a 6-inch shell ? I could not
say. A shell under 5 inches would hardly be worth raising.
409. Have you any idea of the respective weights of a 5-inch shell and a 6-inch shell ? I could not say
at all.
410. You do not know that the difference would be as one to two ? I. could not say. .
411. Say a 5-inch shell weighed 8 oz., a 6-inch shell would weigh 16 oz. ? I could not say without testing
them. I have not handled any for some time.
412. If the limit was raised to 6 inches, do you think the divers would cease to raise any shell approaching
the 5-inch limit—We know that when the 6-inch limit was in force, if they found a shell anywhere near
6 inches by their rough system of measurement, they would raise it on the off chance ? 1 think they
would still raise it.
413. But if the 6-ineh limit was reverted to, do you believe that the divers would continue to raise shell
very much under 6 inches ? Certainly they would.
414. For the sake of the pearls ? Yes, and then there would be nothing else for them to do but throw it
overboard, which would benefit nobody.
415. If the industry was being worked under the floating statiou system, what benefit would that be to
the divers? I suppose they would do the same thing. We would not see the shell then.
416. The divers are paid by weight ? Yes.
417. But if a diver chooses to raise shell that is not exportable, unless he happens to find a pearl in
it, it is of no use to him ? No, or to anybody else; but he would certainly raise the shell on the off
chance of getting a pearl.
418. How many vessels are there in your fleet at the A roe Islands ? I cannot say exactly, but there are
over 100. My partners will be able to give you more reliable information than I can on that point.
Edwin Muneo, Pearl Sheller, further examined :
419. By the Chairman : Mr. Outridge is of opinion that the prohibition of coloured divers would lead to
the industry ceasing to be profitable—Are you also of that opinion? Yes I am, under existing
conditions. _ '
420. Of course I mean if the Japanese are gradually excluded from the industry—l do not suggest that
they should be all stopped at once —that would be unjust to them ? Ido not think that under existing
conditions you can alter the state of affairs with regard to divers, it is not worth a white diver’s while
to go into the industry at present.
421. White men have overcome difficulties in other industries which have seemed insuperable—Take the
digger in New Guinea —What can be more precarious than his life? They can overcome difficulties if it
is worth their while to do so.
422. Do you not think it is possible by legislation and otherwise to make the industry attractive to young
Australians —the spirit of adventure is very strong in them—you have proved that in regard to the
P. P.

22 May, 1908.
young men whom your firm have employed—and with favourable results to some of them, as I know ?
v Of course they are not employed as divers.
3. 423. No ; perhaps they are men of better education and more refinement than the men we would expect
to make into divers —StilV, could you not induce others to go in for the work ? If you were able to make
it worth their while by legislation or other means, from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view,
you might be able to get them to go in for it.
424. By Mr. Douglas: What do you estimate the average coloured diver makes per annum, including
pearls ? Ido not think he makes much over £lOO a year, including pearls.
425. Don’t you think that is a low estimate? No.
42G. By the Chairman : What were they paid in the early days of the industry ?—Yesterday you
gave us some statistics to show that at one time there were thirty-four white divers employed?
At that time we were paying from £l5 to £2O per ton, and up to £25 a ton for exceptional men. It
is worth an employer’s while to pay a good man a better wage, or a better rate of “lay,” than a
poor man.
427. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you mean to say that you consider the average at the present time is not more
than £lOO per annum? Yes. Of course, that is only my opinion. I have not been engaged in fishing
in Torres Strait for the last two or three years. But’l know the quantity of shell that is raised and the
number of boats engaged in the work, and I know fairly well the conditions under which the men are
generally employed. Although we hear of a boat getting 6,8, 10, or even 15 tons of shell in the year, we
know very well that the crew being probably all Japanese that is the result of three, four, or five divers’
work, so that the results have to be divided among that number of divers. It is immaterial to the owner
whether the Japanese diver divides it up between himself and his crew or whether he retains it all for
himself—the fact remains that it is not all done by one man.
428. By the Chairman: In your experience, which gave the best results —white divers or Japanese ?
Generally speaking, the Japanese diver.
429. Take it over a term of one month ? lam taking it over a term of a year. You may get an individual
white diver who will beat any of the Japanese, although that is not my experience.
430. But take a white man who is physically fit for diving—My opinion is that many of them are men
who have led a wild life, and their physique is defective? Yes. There is no reason at all why a white
man should not get as much shell as a coloured man, except that the coloured man takes a greater risk.
He will go into deeper water than the white man. The Japanese particularly appear to place a lower value
on their lives than white men.
431. By Mr. Douglas-. That is peculiar to the Japanese, is it not ? I think it is, andof course the great
majority of the divers now are Japanese.
432. By Mr. Bennett-. The Malays, being Mahometans, have the same fatalism? I think they have.
Still they are much more easily scared than Japanese divers.
433. By Mr. Douglas : Do you not think that the fact that for many years the industry has been
regarded as one only fit for coloured men has had something to do with the difficulty in obtaining suitable
Europeans as divers ? Ido not think so at all.
434. You do not think that it has come to be looked upon as a coloured man’s job ? No.
435. By the Chairman : I am afraid that the same feeling prevails with regard to the pearl-shelling
industry as prevailed for some decades in connection with the sugar industry—that it could only be
carried on by means of coloured labour, and that it entailed degradation on white men if they engaged in
the industry ? Ido not think that any such feeling prevails in connection with the pearl-shell industry.
43G. By Mr. Douglas: The disposal of the shell is an important feature ? The principle adopted is
practically universal. The shell is sold in the open market of the world in the same way as wool. It is
almost wholly confined to the London salerooms. The system is probably as good as can be devised.
Competitors go there from all the manufacturing countries.
437. The success or otherwise of the industry depends entirely upon the price obtained for the shell ?
Of course it does, and it is the price that is obtained that decides whether you can afford to employ white
labour or not. The cost of employing white crews wo'uld be undoubtedly much greater, and you would
want a corresponding increase in the price of shell.
438. There is no fixed price—it all depends upon the question of supply and demand? Just so. Of
course we try to regulate the market price and prevent it fulling.
439. There has never been any attempt made to establish factories in Australia? No.
440. Would it be worth while making the attempt? Ido not think so, for the reason that the quantity
of pearl required to supply the Australian market would be very small, and the cost of production would
be greater here than it is in older countries where they have a larger and cheaper supply of labour.
441. By the Chairman : Have you ever sent shell to America ? Not for sale, but we have sold shell for
shipment to America.
442. By Mr. Douglas: Where does the greater part of the articles manufactured from pearl-shell come
from ? I cannot say, but I know that America lakes about 45 per cent, of the total quantity of shell
‘produced.
443. Do you know if that is all re-sold in America, or is it exported ? Ido not know.
444. By the Chairman : I think France uses pearl-shell largely ? France is low on the list of consumers.
America comes first, Austria next, and then Germany, and after that comes England. The pearl-shellers
sent a representative to Europe a couple of years ago, and he got a lot of information of that character
for us with the view of improving the position of the industry.
445. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think there is a limit as regards the price which manufacturers are
prepared to give for shell? Yes, decidedly.
44G. What do you reckon, roughly, is that price ? For what class of shell?
447. For the best average Old Ground shell ? Without taking any particular year, but taking an average
shipment, I think Ihe manufacturers could afford to pay £175 per ton without militating against the
demand for pearl-shell.
448. Would that be gross or net in London ? Net to the pearl-sheller on Thursday Island.
449. By the Chairman: There is a substitute for pearl—What is that substitute ? They get a lot
of mussel-shell, and they also go in for metal and bone buttons for clothing.
450. By Mr. Bennett: You can do a great deal of pearl-shell work with veneer-shell? Yes. I may
say that about 90 per cent, of pearl-shell is turned into buttons.
18
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOEK THE PEAEL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAL COMMISSION.


451. Largely in Austria? Tes ; but in America, too, I was surprised to learn that; but that is one
piece of information which we got from our representative who went to Europe to make inquiries into
the pearl-shell trade.
452. By the Chairman ; You would think that the hig clam-shell, the Tridacna, could be converted into
good buttons P Tes; but there is no lustre in that shell.
453. It is too brittle too, I fancy ? Tes.
454. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea of the percentage of Torres Strait shell there is in the total
shell produced ? If you took last year, the result would be very different from what it would be if you
took the output four years ago when our fleet was in Torres Strait.
455. Well, can you give us an estimate for a year four years ago ? At that time I think Torres Strait
was producing about one-third of the world’s supply of white pearl-shell.
456. Do you include Western Australia in that estimate ? No. Western Australia produces much more
than Torres Strait does. The grounds there produce more than any other bed in the world.
457. Are not large quantities being produced at Manila, in the Philippine Islands? We have no records
of the quantities produced there, but a gold-lip shell of an inferior quality is obtained.
458. By Mr. Bennett-. That is the Meleagrina margaritifera, isn’t it? Tes; but in value it is not
worth two-thirds of what Torres Strait shell is worth.
459. It is dark ? No; there is too much gold in it, and the gold is a defect in pearl-shell. The silver
lip is the best class of shell.
460. By Mr. Douglas : In saying that 90 per cent, of pearl-shell is used for buttons, do you think that
if the fashion in buttons changes that will affect the demand for pearl-shell ? Ido not think so. The
fashions necessarily change from time to time, but that does not affect the industry. Our representative
ascertained that, taking one year with another, about 90 per cent, of the shell is made into buttons.
461. Are the dealers in the habit of making contracts with manufacturers for a term of years ? Ido
not know about that; but, of course, they do as people in any other class of business do—they take the
risk of the market.
462. Tou do not think it would be worth while to consider the advisability of establishing a factory in
Australia? No, Ido not.
463. Don’t you think that as producers of the shell we should be able to manufacture it into articles of
commerce, and thus get the full benefit of the trade by selling direct to the people who require buttons
and so forth? Ido not think so, for the reason I have already given—that you will find cheaper labour
for the manufacture in the older countries of the world.
464. By the Chairman: When you were in England did you not go through some of the large factories
in Birmingham ? Tes.
465. Is not a great deal of the work done by machinery ? Of course some machinery is employed, but a
lot of labour is also employed, and in the particular factory I went through women and girls were employed.
466. By Mr. Douglas : Would it not be possible to pay a higher rate of wages to have the work done on
the spot, seeing that you would save handling charges in London and middlemen’s profits ? No; you
would have the same middlemen to deal with here—you would not reduce the number of hands that the
pearl goes through. We now sell our shell to a manufacturer at home, and ho produces buttons, which
he sells to the draper.
467. Other industries in the State have been assisted by the Government—the sugar industry has been
assisted by the establishment of central mills for the crushing of cane—Would it not be worth the while
of the Government to assist producers in the pearl-shell industry, more especially if the establishment of
a factory in Queensland would lead to a greater number of Europeans being employed in the industry ?
I take it that that would be a question of policy for the Government to consider.
468. The system of central mills for the cane farmers has been a success, and it may be that some
assistance to the producers of pearl-shell is a desirable thing ? Undoubtedly if you give them sufficient
assistance you could have the whole of the Torres Strait shell worked up here, but it would depend
upon the amount of assistance given.
469. Tou know the amount of revenue collected at Thursday Island—What do you reckon is the value of
the shelling industry to the State ? I could hardly give you that information. Before Federation the
revenue collected at Thursday Island ran up to about £25,000 per annum—that is, the revenue from
Customs, and licenses, and that sort of thing ; and, as the place was wholly dependent upon the shelling
industry, we might fairly claim that the whole of that revenue was obtained by reason of the industry
being there.
470. The State benefits to a considerable extent from that revenue ? Yes; the revenue collected in
1899 was £25,600, the next year it was £23,000, and the year after that £21,000.
471. Were you connected with the industry when the fleets went to Western Australia? No ; that was
before my time.
472. By the Chairman: I have a copy of Mr. Bleakley’s report here, and I find that he says:—“Some
time ago Messrs. Lever Bros, conveyed something like 2,000 shell successfully to foreign waters, and a
French gentleman named Eolot also successfully transplanted nearly 100 live shell to Noumea. lam of
opinion that any further applications by foreign agents for permission to remove young shell should be
decidedly refused, or such a price put upon the permission as would make it prohibitive.” He was
evidently misinformed, as it was not a success ? The shell was successfully transported, but Ido not
know that there has been any success in propagation.
473. By Mr. Douglas: The experiments made in the cultivation of pearl-shell by your company were not
successful ? No ; from a commercial point of view they were not successful.
474. By Mr. Bennett: Do you consider them successful from any point of view ? Of course, a scientist
looks at it from a scientific point of view. We could not get our scientist to look at it from our point of
view so much as from a scientist’s point of view, and in that he was an enthusiast.
475. I asked Mr. Outridge if he could give me the difference in weight between a 5-inch and a 6-inch shell ?
Well, roughly, you could say that there is an increase of about 50 per cent.
476. By Mr. Douglas: Then a 6-ineh shell is 50 per cent, heavier than a 5-inch shell ? Tes ; of course
the weight varies greatly according to the place on which the shell is grown. In some places a 6-iuch
shell is a full-grown shell, and will not increase in circumference, but in other places such is not the case.
To the north of Deliverance we found a lot of shell, and I do not thiuk any of it was over 6 inches, and a
good deal of it may have been many years old.

E. Munro.
22^4ay^1908.
477. By Mr. Bennett : Then, to raise a ton of shell at or about 5 inches in circumference, you need to
raise, roughly speaking, about 50 percent, more in number than you would have to raise if the shell was
!. 6 inches ? Yes.
478. So that we may take it that the raising of shell at the 5-inch limit entails a greater drain on the
ground in order to keep up the output- of shell ? Yes, necessarily so. It will, of course, take a larger
quantity of 5-inch than of 6-inch shell to make a ton.
479. I asked Mr. Outridge how many of your company’s vessels are employed at the Aroe Islands —Can
you give us that information ? Excluding schooners, we have 115 diving vessels.
480. Are they on the Dutch register, or are they British registered vessels? Dutch.
481. And they would not be on the Australian register ? No.
452. By Mr. Douglas : You took more than that number from Torres Strait ? No.
483. I thought the number was 150 ? No.
484. Bearing in mind that the pearl beds appear to have been over-fished in the past, and that no effort
at scientific cultivation has been brought to a successful issue, do you think it would be justifiable for the
Government to spend for, say, a term of ten years the sum of £l,OOO per annum with the object of
demonstrating some scientific method of cultivation, so that those engaged in the industry may ascertain
how the shell may be successfully propagated ? Yes ; I have said in my evidence that I do not think
they would succeed, but it may be a wise thing to make the experiment.
485. Do you think the Government would be justified in doing that? Considering the value of the
industry to the State, I think they would be warranted in making the experiment, although my opinion is
that they will meet with very scant success.
486. Still, whatever information was gained by such an experiment would always be available for the
future, as proper records would be kept of the progress of the experiment—ln the case of the scientist
'employed by you, there were apparently no definite results, and no records kept ? Not only was that so
in our own case, but it was so in the case of Mr. Saville Kent, who was employed by the Government for
some time.
487. Well, he placed on record what he did in 1893 by issuing a publication setting forth what he
thought should be done and what he had done? Yes.
488. By the Chairman : If scientific research has benefited other industries, why should it not also benefit
this industry ? Of course, lam speaking of the efforts that have been put forth so far. We have had
three scientists.
489. By Mr. Douglas: In the case of the edible oyster, the work of cultivation goes back almost to
before the year of our Lord, and it must have taken some time to bring it to such a state of perfection—
Why should we not try to do something of the same kind in connection with the pearl-oyster? It is a
comparatively easy thing to cultivate the edible oyster, Beally, all that is done here is to lay down a
suitable bed, and take the spawn there. The spawn settles on the ground, and matures, or it may be
taken from there to more suitable beds and spread out in such a way that it will grow more quickly. It
does not need a rush of tide, whilst the pearl-oyster will not thrive unless there is a fair flow of water
over it, while the flowing water takes the spat away.
490. By the Chairman: The production of the edible oyster has been immensely assisted by scientific
supervision in England, and especially in France ? I was thinking more especially of our experience in
Queensland. I know that at home they build places in the land and let the water into them, and put
down feed for the oysters ; but nothing of that kind is done here.
491. By Mr. Doui/las: They take them up now and again and look at them, and put them back
again ? Yes; but hero the only method that is followed is to put them down in suitable places and lot
them grow there.
Alan Ohd Mackenzie, Accountant, examined :
492. By the Chairman : What are you ? An accountant.
493. You have had considerable experience in the pearl-shelling and bcche-de-mer industry ? I have
been closely connected with both industries for the last ten years.
494. By Mr. Bennett: You wish to speak more particularly about the beche-de-mer industry ? Yes.
495. By Mr. Douglas: You had a lot of experience in that industry some years ago at Cooktown ? Yes.
496. You used to handle large quantities there ? Yes. That is the centre of the beche-do-mer industry
in Australia.
497. All the boats working on the eastern coast are practically centred at Cooktown ? Yes.
498. By the Chairman : Did you not at times extend your operations out to the isolated groups in the
Coral Sea ? Previous to my time at Cooktown, I believe vessels did visit the outlying islands.
499. You confined your operations to the Barrier Beef ? Yes.
500. By Mr. Douglas: You were the owner of several boats yourself? Yes.
501. What class of boats were used at that time? Mostly small vessels of up to 30 or 40 tons. I
suppose 40 tons is the limit now, although last year there was one vessel of 90 tons engaged in the
industry.
502. Is it necessary to have a large vessel to work the Outer Beef successfully? It certainly is.
503. When you were in the business it was necessary, under the Navigation Act, to employ a master for
any vessel of over 15 tons ? Yes.
504. Does the same provision prevail now ? No, unfortunately. There were never so few white men
engaged in the business as there are this year.
505. What is the reason for that ? The Japanese coming in and getting concessions and privileges last
year which were never granted to whites before.
506. And they secure the labour ? They recruit the aboriginal labour themselves.
507. By the Chairman : What is the nature of the concessions you refer to ? Allowing the Japanese to
take out vessels of over 15 tons.
508. At Thursday Island they were allowed the privilege of going out without a master up to 25 tons ?
That was restricted to Thursday Island.
509. No ; it is also allowed in the other ports ? It was refused to other ports.
510. They never asked for it—perhaps you are referring to Iloare, of Cooktown ? There were others
before him. I was the owner of a vessel of 25 tons. I never applied for permission because I knew it
had been refused in other cases.
A. O.
Mackenzie.
20
Minutes of evidence taken defoee the peakl-shell and beche-de-mee eotal commission.


511. Vessels of 25 tons and under are exempt—there is no record of a concession having beeen granted,
but it had become the established custom since the inception of the industry; and, when the Marine
Board came to consider the matter, they could not see why the people of Thursday Island should enjoy a
privilege which was denied to the Southern boats, so wo placed them all in the same position as those at :
Thursday Island about twelve months ago ? But that benefited nobody but the Japanese. I know white
men who were refused permission to take their own boats out of Townsville and Cooktown.
512. Are not the boats you refer to owned wholly or in part by Japanese P That is a matter upon which
I would rather not express an opinion. They may bo owned by Japanese; but, to all intents and purposesj
they are owned by white men.
513. By Mr. Douglas ; But it is understood that, in many cases, the Japanese really own the boats?
"Well, I hold that opinion.
514. By the Chairman : With a view to making it a more attractive occupation for white men, what
improvements would you suggest? I would suggest that the Japanese should not be allowed to recruit
the aboriginal natives.
515. By Mr. Douglas : You would not direct that particularly against the Japanese? Against all
coloured aliens.
516. Would you make it apply to all ports, including Thursday Island, or only to Cooktown southward ?
I would make it apply to all ports. No Japanese or other unnaturalised aliens should be allowed to
recruit native labour.
517. By Mr. Bennett: Are you aware that that rule has been in force for some years? Well, if it is
the law, it has not been enforced. The Japanese pay their men off in Townsville, while up till last year
white men were compelled to pay their aboriginals at the port of engagement, and to return them to their
homes.
518. By the Chairman : Is there not any restriction as to where you are to land them ? Ton have to
land them where you recruit them.
519. Are the Japanese not compelled to do that ? One boat in particular last year did not do that.
520. Do you refer to the Japanese boat which was wrecked ? No ; to another boat belonging to Cairns.
521. By Mr. Douglas : You were actually engaged in the industry yourself last year ? Yes.
522. You were working on the Barrier Eeef ? Yes ; between Thursday Island and Capricorn Channel.
523. How many boats do you estimate were then working on the reefs ? I suppose the exact number
could be got from the official records, but I should say there were not less than ninety.
624. How many of those boats would have at least one white man on board ? As far as I know, there
were only six, and the rest were manned entirely by aliens—mostly by Japanese.
525. By Mr. Bennett: You would not call such men as Pitt and the Murray Islanders aliens, would you?
Well, coloured aliens.
526. By Mr. Douglas : Were large catches obtained last year when you were out? Yes, exceptionally
large catches. One Japanese boat obtained between 14 and 15 tons of first-class fish.
527. By the Chairman: Do you refer to the Japanese boat that went out from Mackay ? It was one of
a number of boats that went out from Mackay.
528. He returned after three months with 9 tons which he got on the Swain lleef ? North of Swain
Eeef.
529. By Mr. Douglas: What would be the average value of a ton of the class of fish they are getting
there ? The present prices are 50 per cent, lower than they were this time last year.
530. By the Chairman : You are aware that one species of the fish is three times as valuable as another—
what are the teat fish worth? They were only taking two varieties of fish out there—the teat fish and
the black fish. The Southern red fish is of very little value. ' .
531. By Mr. Douglas : The teat and the black fish are of about equal value ? Yes.
532. Eoughly speaking, what would be the value of the fish last year, taking the year all through ? Prom
the beginning to the end of the year, the teat and black fish would average about £l4O per ton. It was
£l6O a ton this time last year, but it went down to £lO3 at Christmas time.
533. What is the highest price you have ever known to be obtained for beche-de-mer? Over £2OO a
ton.
534. The cost of working the beche-de-mer fishery is not as high as the cost of working the pearl-shell
fishery? Not as high, because there is not such expensive gear used in working the industry,
535. And the labour ? The labour is not so expensive.
536. What wages are paid to the natives down the coast ? The actual wages are 10s. a month for each
boy.
537. Do they not get more than that in some cases ? In very few instances ; they get a big allowance of
clothing and tobacco.
538. How many men are employed on a boat of 15 to 20 ons ? From twelve to fifteen aboriginals,
besides the master and the regular crew.
639. How many of a regular crew ? Usually four.
540. Do the natives do any other work than the actual swimming for the fish ? They assist in preparing
and curing the fish. •
541. Are the natives, as a rule, as willing to engage with Europeans as with Japanese and other aliens ?
They are equally willing to engage with Europeans. Europeans have no difficulty whatever in obtaining
“ boys.”
542. The boys do not prefer to go with Japanese ? Ido not think so.
543. Do you think the Japanese look after their boys as well as Europeans do in the matter of food and
in housing accommodation when ashore curing the fish ? Ido not think they give them any better
treatment than the white men give them.
544. By the Chairman: Do they treat them as well as white men treat them ? They must treat them as
well, because they appear to be willing to go back each year. I have visited many of the Japanese boats
when they have been working, and I have never heard any complaints from the “ boys” as to their
treatment by the Japanese.
545. You say that the principal grievance in the beche-de-mer industry is that Japanese are licensed, or
are allowed to take charge of boats ? If the concession given to Japanese had been granted before, a lot
of white men would have gone out of the industry. But the concession was only given last year when
the Japanese had their boats ready to step into the industry.

A. O. ;
Mackenzie, j
22 May, 1908.'
546. Are you aware from personal knowledge that Japanese are allowed to land tlieir crews at Townsville
instead of taking them back to the district from which they have been shipped ? Ido not know about
n landing them at Townsville, but I know they paid their crews off at Townsville. Frequently the “ boys ”
do not want to go back to their homes, but the Protector of Aboriginals has always made it compulsory
for masters of boats to return them to their homes whether they wanted to go or not.
547. By Mr. Bennett : An aboriginal can always be induced to say anything he is wanted to say ? Tes,
I admit that.
548. No matter how much he wanted to go home, if he saw sufficient inducement “on the counter,” so
to speak, he would alter his opinion ? Well, he is certainly open to inducement, and the Japanese were
certainly allowed to induce them.
549. Would it not be difficult to prevent anyone, a Japanese or other person, from exercising such
persuasion ? No. But I say that the regulation which is applied to Japanese should also be applied to
others. The Japanese alone should not be allowed this concession.
550. I cannot understand that there should be any difference in their case, because to my certain
knowledge for years at Thursday Island the aboriginals had to be returned to the place whence they
were recruited ? I owned boats at Cooktown, and I have also had considerable experience in other
beche-de-mer boats, and I know that the masters were always compelled to return the “boys” to their
homes at the expiration of the term of their agreement, whether the “ boys” wanted to go or not.
551. With regard to the articles of the Japanese boats you are speaking of, are the articles of agreement
between the owners of the boats and the aboriginals, or between the Japanese .and the aboriginals ? The
articles were nearly all drawn up at Thursday Island, and I could not say.
552. In that case they would be articles between the owners of the boats, who are Europeans, and the
aboriginals, and not between the Japanese and the aboriginals ? I cannot speak definitely on that
point.
553. But they may have been ? Tes.
554. Do you know of your own knowledge that a Japanese cannot obtain a license for a boat? Tes.
555. Consequently he cannot obtain articles for the crew of a boat ? He can do a lot of things. Perhaps
the Chairman knows whether the aboriginals on the “ Day Dawn” were engaged by the Japanese master
or by the owner of the vessel.
The Chairman : I think they were engaged and put on board by Mr. Hoare, the owner. That is my
impression.
556. By Mr. Douglas : Is there a plentiful supply of native labour for the boats ? There is a supply for
a limited number. Last year there were too many boats engaged in the industry, and there was not
sufficient labour.
557. How does the New Guinea labourer suit? New Guinea labourers are not as satisfactory as
aboriginals.
558. They do not take to the diving so well? No.
559. What depth can aboriginals go down in the water? A lot of them can easily go down 10 fathoms.
560. What, to your own knowledge, is the greatest depth at which beche-de-mer exists? To my own
knowledge, 15 fathoms ; but I have heard of their being found at a greater depth.
561. What class of fish would they be ? The teat fish.
562. How far do the boats go South now ? They go down south of Capricorn Channel.
563. Do you think the reefs have been over-fished ? I think the reefs from Murray Island to Capricorn
Channel have been denuded of fish, and it will be some years before the fish will have increased
sufficiently to warrant white men engaging in the industry again.
564. By the Chairman : Do you think there are valuable fish as far south as Capricorn Channel ? They
exist there, but I do not know whether they are valuable or not.
565. Do the weather conditions permit of catching fish all the year round ? No.
566. During the winter months, for instance ? During the winter months diving is a great hardship to
the boys engaged in it.
567. By Mr. Bennett : That is farther south ? Tes.
568. By Mr. Douglas: Do the natives keep in the water pretty well all day when they are working?
They are diving when the tide is receding, at low tide, and when the tide is making.
569. By the Chairman ; Do you not consider it hazardous during tho hurricane months, from December
to April ? Tes ; and very few vessels engage in the work during those months ; but the Japanese were
out last year during the hurricane months.
570. By Mr. Douglas : Tou have a patent process for curing the fish, have you not ? Tes. It is in my
father’s name, but I am interested in it.
571. It is capable of curing a very large quantity, is it not ? Tes.
572. Did you find the quantities of fish on the reefs last year were not up to expectations ? No. We
were in a big vessel, and we were harassed by the Japanese all tho time wo were there. We acted ns a
beacon for the small Japanese vessels, which followed us wherever we went.
573. Wherever you anchored, they came along? Tes; they knew that where we would find a reef
profitable they would find it very much more so.
574. And you were not given a chance through so many boats following you ? No.
575. Their smaller boats enabled them to scoop the reefs much closer ? They were in a better position,
because they could go inside the lagoons, and we could not.
576. Do you think trawling in deep water would be at all successful ? For certain kinds of fish ; but [
do not know about the most valuable fish, which seem to exist among the coral, and trawling could not be
successfully carried on there.
577. By the Chairman ; Do you think it would be possible to trawl anywhere within the limits of the
Barrier Reef ? Trawling has been tried inside the Barrier Reef, but only the cheaper varieties of fish
have been picked up. A fish called sandfish was picked up at certain places inside the Barrier Reef, but
it is only worth £2O or £25 a ton.
578. The obstruction of the coral would preclude trawling operations ? Tes.
679. Cannot they pick up the fish at low water in about a fathom of water? Tes. On the Barrier
Reef it is nearly all picked up by diving. Very little is picked up by walking about on the top of the
reef.

580. Can you suggest any other improvement in connection with the industry with a view to making it
more attractive to white men? The only thing I can suggest is to refuse to allow the Japanese to
recruit aboriginals.
581. But that is the law at present ? Then it should be enforced. The industry is a valuable one. :
582. By Mr. Douglas : How many white men were engaged in the industry when you first went into it ?
There was a good number from Cooktown, but I cannot say how many. There were no Japanese in the
industry then. There were a few Malays and Manila men.
583. Were there twenty white men ? More than that.
584. Were they making a fair living? A very good living.
585. Some of them were very prosperous indeed ? Yea,
58G. They got large hauls of fish ? Yes; so much so that they used only to work for six months in the
year. They did not work in the cold weather.
587. Did they work on the reef ? Yes. The Japanese now work outside the Barrier Beef. They make
no secret of the fact that they go out to the isolated groups in the Coral Sea.
588. By the Chairman :It requires very exact navigation to take a boat out ? Ido not know whether
there are any masters among them, but they know exactly where they are.
589. By Mr. Douglas : Some of them are competent navigators ? Very.
590. By the Chairman : Are they supplied with implements of navigation? Not to my knowledge.
There was a competent navigator in charge of the vessels that came to where we were last year. We had
our exact position, and, though there was just a skeleton barrier, those Japanese knew exactly where they
were.
591. When I was at Cooktown, between 1883 and 1889, I should say there were from twenty to twenty-
five boats went out of that port alone, owned and manned by whites—there was no competition then with
Japanese with all native crews —There was only one man went beyond the Barrier—Mathieson—he bad a
schooner of about 40 tons, and he went home with £4,000 ? One Japanese went home with £9OO as
the result of his last year’s work.
592. One or two of them extended their operations over to the reefs near New Guinea ? At the present
moment I do not suppose there are twelve white men in Australia who have as intimate a knowledge of
the Barrier Eeef from end to end as at least fifty Japanese.
593. Fifty Japanese in charge of boats ? Ido not mean fifty boats ; but there are fifty Japanese who
know all the intricate passages of the Barrier from Capricorn Channel right up to Murray Island.
594. By Mr. Douglas : They could pilot a large vessel through the reef ? Yes. So far as the northern
part of the reef is concerned, a bigger number of Japanese than of our own people have an intimate
knowledge of it. Every boat that goes on to the Barrier Reef has English charts.
595. I suppose they use the lead as they go along ? Yes. Last year and the year before numerous
boats visited reefs as far out as the Lihou Reef.
696. How far out is that ? About 300 miles from Townsville.
597. By the Chairman : Then there is Osprey Reef, midway between Port Moresby and Townsville, and
there are Wreck Reef and Saumarez Reef? They have visited all those.
598. Then they have had very exact navigators, because there is no high land ? Yes; they get there.
There is a provision in the Aboriginals Protection Act which prohibits you taking aboriginals outside
the Barrier Eeef. Still these Japanese go there.
599. By Mr. Douglas : Do you know whether the beche-He-mer comes up from the deep water at any
particular time of the year ? It is supposed to come up from the deep water, but very little is known
of its habits.
609. You do not know anything so far as its growth is concerned ? No. Nearly all the fish obtained
from the reef are large fish.
601. By Mr. Bennett: You say that the Barrier Reef is pretty well denuded of the more valuable fish?
Yes.
602. You have a knowledge of the Barrier Reef extending over ten years ? I have a knowledge of
the fishery extending over about ten years.
603. Have you ever known the reefs to be denuded before ? They have never had such a raking over as
they got last year.
604. But have you ever known fish to be considered scarce on the reef ? I have known some reefs that
have been worked out and have never recovered. Others appear as if they could not be worked out,
because they are full of ledges and deep crevices, with foul bottom all round, from which the supply of
fish always comes.
605. Has it not come to your knowledge that many years ago in the early days of the fishery, and again
more recently, the reefs around Murray Island were considered to be worked out ? I have not heard
that at all.
606. From your knowledge of the habits of the beche-de-mer, would you not think it probable that within
a comparatively short time a reef which has been denuded will recuperate ? I think it will take some of
the southern reefs from five to seven years to recover from the over-fishing of last year.
607. I presume you only suggest that Japanese should be prohibited from engaging in the industry as
principals ? Certainly.
608. (Supposing that came about, what would be the result so far as increasing the number of Europeans
engaged in the industry is concerned ? I consider that there would be profitable employment for at
least twenty boats all the year round.
609. That would mean how many Europeans actually working ? At least eighty.
610. "Would there be four Europeans on each boat ? Some of the larger boats might employ more, and
some of the smaller boats would employ three, so that there would be from seventy to eighty men
working.
611. Which do you consider the most suitable class of aboriginal labour—that of the mainland aboriginal
or that of the aboriginal on the island ? I think the best swimmers are the “ boys ” from Night Island
and from the Cape Grenville district.
612. By the Chairman : Would white men do the swimming ? Not the actual picking up of the fish.
Ido not think white men would go out and walk over the reef picking up the fish. When fish is up to
£l5O a ton it pays to equip a boat and send it out fishing. The aboriginals are as much at home at that
work as they are on 1 and—they take to that sort of fishing.

613. Speaking from your own experience, how many tons do you think one boat could catch in a year?
e - I suppose about 6 tons of first-class fish would be considered a fair catch for a year.
614. Do you consider that would be good remuneration? That would be good remuneration to the
08 owners.
615. Under present conditions, can you regard the aboriginal as a permanent source of labour ? For a
limited number of boats, certainly.
616. Do their exertions in beche-de-mer fishing affect the health of aboriginals in any way ? No.
617. By Mr. Bennett: You are speaking of adults, are you not? Yes.
618. Has it not been found that youths and boys suffer by engaging in that industry? I have not
found that to he the case.
619. lam speaking of boys of from fourteen to fifteen years of age? Last year I had two boys about
fifteen or sixteen years of age working for me.
620. By the Chairman : Do you employ women too ? No ; we are not allowed to employ women.
621. By Mr. Douglas : Have you ever heard of youths of from fourteen to sixteen years suffering from
chest complaints through working in the water becho-de-mor fishing? No ; I have never heard so.
622. By the Chairman : There is one advantage they get from working in the industry—they get their
food? Yes.
623. Well, you are in favour of prohibiting the Japanese from carrying on under any circumstances ?
Well, if Japanese and other coloured aliens carry on, there is no hope whatever of white men getting
the industry into their own hands. There is not the least doubt that a lot of white men would have gone
out if it had been generally known that the Japanese were going in last year. I would not have gone
out of the industry myself this year if it had not been for the Japanese going in last year.
621. Do you think that if the Japanese were deprived of the privileges which they now enjoy, they
would work for the owners of boats? A number of Japanese possess a great knowledge of the
industry.
625. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think it would be a good plan to restrict the number of licenses issued to
persons working in the beche-de-mer industry ? Yes.
626. By the Chairman: To whites as well as to aliens ? Yes. I would not license more than twenty
boats in the beche-de-mer industry, and I would only put boats in charge of whites.
627. By Mr. Douglas: That would be creating a monopoly, you know? Well, twenty boats would not
be much of a monopoly.
628. The twenty boats would be working the Barrier Reef from Cooktown southward ? And to Thursday
Island.
629. Do you think it would be- conducive to the success of the beche-de-mer industry if there was
a provision in the Act prohibiting fishing for a period of years, say three or four years—You have
already said that the reef has been denuded of fish ? I think some of those working in the North
will be able to give you better information on that point than I can. If there are no white men employed
in the industry this year, there will be no white men engaged in it next year. The number of boats
licensed last year was such that they flooded the China market, and the price of fish is 50 per cent, lower
now than it was last year.
630. They must have got a lot of fish to do that ? That is so. Last year, I suppose, nine or ten
Japanese got at least £12,000 worth of fish east of Mackay.
631. By Mr. Bennett : You speak of limiting the number of boats engaged in the industry—l suppose
you know that the natives of Murray Island, and possibly other islands in the Straits, have boats which
they use in beche-de-mer fishing ? Yes, lam aware that they own boats.
632. Is it your idea to limit them, too ? No ; I would not limit the natives of the islands, or the natives
at the mission stations down the coast —as, for instance, the station near Cairns.
633. I suppose you recognise that those islanders are dependent to a large extent upon fishing for their
livelihood ? Yes. I would prohibit only aliens.
634. When you speak of aliens, you do not include our own coloured races-? No; Ido not include
aboriginals or natives of the adjacent islands.
635. By Mr. Douglas : Do you suggest that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, so far as the
employment of masters for vessels over 15 tons is concerned, should be rigidly enforced, or would it be
advisable to make 25 tons the maximum to which those provisions with respect to masters should be
applied ? It is only recently that the limit has been 25 tons.
636. At Thursday Island it is 25 tons ? I know that at Thursday Island it was 25 tons until last
year.
637. If the Japanese had not obtained the concession to work south of Cooktown with vessels up to 25
tons, they would presumably have employed vessels of not more than 15 tons ? Yes ; but they would
not have been able to work the southern end of the Barrier.
638. A vessel of 15 tons would be too small to go down there ? Almost too small. The Japanese com-
plained that their boats of 20 tons were too small for their requirements.
639. By the Chairman: You do not cure fish at sea ? Yes, we do ; and h vessel of 20 tons can carry
sufficient firewood, water, and provisions; but when they procure 4| tons of fish they would cease fishing,
and go back for fresh stores. They might get on a good patch of fish and work there till their supplies
ran out, and then return for fresh supplies. I think the tonnage of the vessel owned by Mr. McMaster,
who recently died at Cooktown, was 29 tons.
640. That is the vessel which was wrecked at Sandy Cape ? No ; that was a vessel of 40 tons. That
was Thompson’s boat.
641. I think that vessel belonged to Craig? No, Ido not think he owns a boat at all.
642. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think it would be advisable to endeavour to acquire some knowledge with
regard to the habits of the beche-de-mer, its spawning, &c., with a view to the cultivation of the fish?
Very valuable information could be obtained as to the habits of the fish, but as to cultivation I do not
know sufficient about that to express an opinion on it.
643. By the Chairman: Have you any evidence that the teat fish lives and thrives in 15 fathoms of
water ? I have seen it myself, with the aid of a marine telescope, in 15 fathoms of water close to the
reef. I saw,what is called the white teat, the black fish, and the prickly fish in 15 fathoms of water;
and I have been told by others that they know the fish exists in water as deep as 25 fathoms, but I have
not seen it at that depth myself.

644. By Mr. Bennett : Have you any knowledge of diving gear being employed in the prosecution of
beche-de-mer fishing ? Ido not know that of my own knowledge, but I have seen places where it would
have paid us if we had had a pump on board the vessel to send a diver down to get the fish.
645. By the Chairman-. Would you have to go ashore to find out whether a reef is barren or not? Yes; ;
you would have to go ashore to find that out.
646. Would not the habits and cultivation of this fish be a matter for the study of a marine biologist ?
Yes.
647. I suppose beche-de-mer is pretty well distributed over the Barrier proper ? Yes. I have also
noticed that where the tide is swiftest there is the'greatest quantity of fish.
648. You do not find the big star fish on the top of the reef ? Do you refer to what is called the “ lolly”
fish ?
649. Yes—ls that of any commercial value ? It is of commercial value, but of very little commercial
value.
650. By Mr. Douglas : The fact that a larger quantity of fish are found where the tide is strongest would
seem to indicate that they get more food there ? Yes.
651. By Mr. Bennett : Is that larger quantity found in the current or in eddies ? Usually in the
back-water.
652. By Mr. Douglas : I suppose they are found in pools, too ? Yes, occasionally.
653. By Mr. Bennett : Does the quality of the fish change materially for the worse in Southern latitudes ?
There are only two of the Southern reefs where I noticed the fish to be of inferior quality. On the
others the fish are as good as the Northern fish. The “lolly-fish” is fairly good, but the red-fish is of
very poor quality.
654. Of course all the water is well within the tropics down to Capricorn Channel ? Yes. There is very
little south of the Tropic of Capricorn.
655. By the Chairman : Can you give us any suggestions as to conserving the shelling industry for the
white race —I suppose you know that it is largely in the hands of the Japanese now, like the beche-de-mer
industry ? Yes. At the present time the divers are all Japanese.
656. Do you think that the industry could find employment for white divers and tenders ? At the
present time I do not think it could.
657. Is that in consequence of the low remuneration the industry affords ? Yes. The amount of shell
obtainable at the present time is not sufficient to employ white divers profitably.
658. Do you think it could be made more remunerative by granting more favourable conditions, such as
extended areas ? If the conditions were made as favourable as they were in the early days, it would
pay to employ white divers again.
659. How have the conditions changed since the early days ? At one time shell was very plentiful, and
white men could make good wages • but shell has become scarce, and you have to go farther afield for it.
660. Still, there is a large quantity of shell obtained ? Yes ; because the boats have better appliances for
getting it, and they go farther afield. I suppose the majority of the shelters now go 40 miles from
Thursday Island.
661. By Mr. Douglas: You have been actively engaged in pearling yourself? Yes; for about two
years in Torres Strait.
662. By the Chairman : Do you think it possible for young white men of eighteen years of age and upwards,
of good physique, to be trained to carry on the industry? Under certain conditions I dare say they could
be trained ; but I do not think those at present engaged in the industry could be expected to train them.
They might if they received some Government assistance in the shape of a subsidy. Like most young
men up there, I have been down in a diving dress, but it is an occupation that I should not care to take
up for a livelihood.
663. By Mr. Douglas : But, if it was very payable, and there was a chance of getting large pearls,
there are plenty young men with a seafaring bent who would be prepared to go in for it ? If sufficient
inducements were offered.
664. It is a question of how much shell they could get ? It is a question of inducements.
665. By the Chairman : The chance of getting a few good pearls should be a sufficient inducement ?
Yes, but the divers do not get the pearls.
666. The difficulties you mention should not prove insuperable—the Anglo-Saxon has overcome greater
difficulties than those connected with diving? The man who calls himself a professional diver at the
present time will only work three or four hours a day; but these men in Torres Strait are down in
the water from daylight to dark.
667. If extended areas were granted to three or four men working in conjunction, would that not be an
inducement ? There is only a limited part of the world’s production picked up in Torres Strait. We
can grow all the sugar that is required for Australia. It is simply a question of cost. You could import
sugar and sell it here for less than 2d. a pound, but you could not grow it for that price. I could get a
white diver to pick up shell in Torres Strait, but it would not pay to do it. It might cost me more than
£3OO a ton to get it.
668. By Mr. Bennett : You are speaking of working with an entirely white crew ? Yes; just the same
as white labour in connection with the sugar industry.
669. Why should it cost £3OO a ton to get shell with a white diver, white tender, and four white men ?
You could get a coloured crew comparatively cheap ; but you could not afford to pay a white diver, and
possibly his tender, as they could not earn more than £lOO or £l3O a year.
670. What do you reckon would be sufficient pay to induce white men to undertake the work ? You
must take into consideration the average wages paid to white men in the canefields or on the goldfields.
671. Of course the wages on the goldfields fix the standard for wages in Australia ? Yes. Men are
working under harder conditions on board a pearling lugger than anywhere ashore, and they would
certainly want equal remuneration, if not higher than on a goldfield. If they were working a “ lay,” as
the Japanese do, of so much per ton of shell raised, they would want a bonus or they would knock
off work.
672. Would the money that the coloured alien divers at present engaged in the industry get be a
sufficient inducement for white men ? Not with the present catches.
678; Could the industry afford to pay white men sufficiently high wages to induce them to go in for the
■work P No.

22May/1908.
674. By the Chairman : How could the industry be made sufficiently attractive for white men ? I
• understand that the shell is increasing in Torres Strait since the withdrawal of a certain number of
boats; and, if it continues to increase at the same rate for a few years, it will exist in sufficient quantities
8* to afford some attraction to white men.
675. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think the beds have been over-fished in the past—too many boats? The
valuable grounds have certainly been over-fisbed.
676. No doubt that is the reason why so many boats were withdrawn ? That is one of the reasons.
677. You were there when those boats went away? Yes.
678. You had a good deal of knowledge of the ground*they were fishing over up to the time they left ?
Yes.
679. There was a tendency all the time to go further afield ? Yes.
680. It was only when the weather permitted that the boats were able to go further afield? Yes, and
the further westward they went the better the grounds were.
681. Would it be desirable to limit by some means or other the number of boats employed in the
industry, with the object of ultimately bringing about some change in regard to the number of
Europeans engaged in the industry ? I consider that there should certainly be a limit. If the shell
goes on increasing for two or three years and becomes fairly plentiful, and another 150 or 200 boats come
to Torres Strait, the conditions will be worse in two or three years after that than they were a couple of
years ago.
682. Do you think it desirable to limit the number of boat licenses in Torres Strait ? I certainly do.
688. That would create a monopoly ? There are monopolies in other things. There are monopolies in
hotels in this city.
684. But that is not an industry like this—Could not the same end be attained by other means—Could
there not be a curtailment in the fishing by issuing further divers’ licenses to none but whites ?
Certainly; that would have exactly the same effect. It would be quite possible to restrict the number of
licenses.
685. You might limit the number of alien divers; and if a person wanted to put a boat into the industry
and employ a white diver he might be permitted to do so ? Some restriction in the number of licenses
issued to alien divers would be a good plan.
686. By the Chairman : How would it affect the industry if the Japanese and all coloured aliens were
prohibited by legislation ? I think it would absolutely extinguish the industry. If white men are to
come back to the industry, the aliens will have to be gradually eliminated.
687. Would not their withdrawal from the business be an incentive to young white men to enter into it?
It has never been sufficiently attractive. I cannot say what inducement there would be under more
favourable conditions.
688. By Mr. Douglas : You say there were twenty or thirty Europeans making a good living in the
beche-de-mer industry ten years ago, and now they have been edged out by the Japanese—exactly
what has happened in the pearl-shell industry ? The same applies to both industries.
689. So that the gradual exclusion of coloured aliens—without adopting any harsh measures—and the
encouragement of an increasing number of white men to engage in the industry would be desirable ? It
would be very desirable.
690. Europeans are not likely to become divers unless they see a chance of making it pay? That
is so.
691. By the Chairman : It would not necessarily follow that the white man would have to work from
sunrise to sunset —he would be master of the situation then, and not a subordinate ? Of course, the
Japanese have always been paid by results, and a man who desires to be No. 1 man in the fleet will work
at the expense of his own health.
692. By Mr. Douglas: If the pearl-shell were cultivated, it would get over a good deal of the trouble?
If it could be successfully carried out, it would settle a good many of the labour troubles ; but I have no
practical knowledge on the subject.
693. By the Chairman : Do you think any benefit would accrue from the employment of a. competent
marine biologist ? I understand there is a marine biologist up there now who has had practical
experience, since he has written some works on the subject.
694. I mean a practical man ? I have more faith in a practical man than in a mere scientist.
695. Other industries have benefited greatly from the work of scientists —You are still of opinion that a
white man could not make a success of the industry ? He could not make a success of it with employment
as it is now.
696. By Mr. Douglas ; Supposing, for argument’s sake, that the Old Grounds and Endeavour Strait were
closed for a period of five years, do you think sufficient shell would accumulate to enable white divers to
work successfully and profitably ? I think such a course would have that effect in regard to the Old
Grounds, but not in Endeavour Strait, which have been closed and reopened, and then closed and worked
again. I have very little faith in Endeavour Strait. It is a very good .feeding ground, but it was closed
at least once, and very little advantage resulted from its closure.
697. By Mr. Bennett : It was not properly closed—indeed, it was never closed, as a matter of fact, as
there was not a sufficient patrol ? But you see that in the Old Grounds the spat is going west, and spat
also comes from the deep water in the east, so that spat is going backwards and forwards through Torres
Strait.
698. By Mr. Douglas: You think the shell extends right into deep water? Yes, right across to the
Aroe Islands, especially in the shallower waters.
699. By Mr. Bennett : You do not think anything of the ground beyond that ? No.
700. By the Chairman : Do you think a small subsidy by the Government would encourage white men to
engage in the industry ? I certainly do. I think it would be a good thing if the Government offered a
subsidy for shell raised within a certain time, the same as the Federal Government offer for white-grown
sugar-cane.
701. "What do you think would be a sufficient subsidy for shell raised by a white diver and tender ? I
consider he should get a bonus of at least £5O a ton on all shell he picks up.
702. You think that with a subsidy of £5O a ton the work could be made remunerative by a white diver?
Yes, provided he was allowed to engage a coloured crew, and pick up the shell himself.
703. By Mr. Douglas : That would be allowing that shell realised the average price ? Yes.


A. O.
Mackenzie,
22 May, 1908.
701. Supposing a white diver, who was the owner of a boat and employed a white tender with a coloured
crew, sent his shell to London, and got £250 a ton for it, would that pay him ? Yes, but I am basing my
argument on the price realised at the present time, which is about £150 a ton.
705. By Mr. Bennett : Is not £150 a ton the low-water mark at which a profit can be made ? I think so.
706. By the Chairman : You are aware that Clark and Co. and other companies have large floating
stations —Could stations ashore be substituted for those floating stations ? I do not think that could be
done profitably now, as they have to go further afield for their shell.
707. But surely they could establish stations on some of the small islands studded about Torres Strait ?
All those grounds are practically worked out.
708. Do they go outside Cape Grenville ? The place where the most shell is secured in Torres Strait is
north-west of Booby Island.
709. Towards Cook Reef ? Yes, towards Cook Reef.
710. Then you think floating stations are necessary for the industry under present conditions ? Yes.
711. A floating station is a source of expense—a schooner of 200 tons cannot be kept up for nothing ?
By the use of floating stations the companies are able to keep their fleets more constantly at work, and
the cost of such stations was pretty well borne by the pearls which were found among the shell. Now,
of course, the divers are allowed to keep the pearls. There is no doubt that the shell is opened by the
divers.
712. By Mr. Bennett : It is Hobson’s choice—the practice cannot be stopped ? Now, the divers are
allowed to keep the pearls. Previously, they were not allowed to do so, but now they are paid so much
a ton for the shell, and are allowed to keep the pearls. Floating stations are not absolutely necessary in
all cases, but they are necessary under certain conditions of working, such as those under which Clark
and Co. work.
713. Do you think that the grounds away beyond what we know as the Badu Grounds proper can be
worked successfully and profitably other than by floating stations—that is, to the outer or western limits
of the Old Grounds ? Yes, they could; because they have been in the past. ,
714. As far as they are worked now ? Yes ; as far as they are worked now they could.
715. You say that from your own knowledge ? I know that, because I was up there. The floating
station used to work away to the westward.
716. Then you believe that, even in the working of those outer limits of the grounds, it is not absolutely
necessary to have a floating station ? The grounds could be worked more profitably with a floating
station.
717. Would more shell be won by floating station boats or by shore boats ? I certainly consider that
more shell would be won by a fleet working with a floating station than by a fleet working with a station
on shore.
718. Then from that we may deduce the conclusion that the floating station system imposes a greater
strain on the grounds than the shore system ? Yes.

Peesent ;
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Mb. H. A. C. DOUGLAS; M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
James Ciaek, Pearl Sheller, examined:
719. By Mr. Douglas : What is your experience in pearl-shelling or beche-de-mer fishing—how long
ago is it since you took up the business of pearl-shelling ? I went shelling in 1881.
720. And from that time up to the present you have been the owner of pearl-shelling boats ? We have
been shelling in Western Australia, as well as at Thursday Island, the Aroe Islands, and Port Darwin. *
721. At the present time, how many boats do your company own ? My company are working 115 boats.
722. Are those diving boats? Yes.
723. Are those vessels British registered vessels? No; they are Dutch registered vessels.
724. What is their tonnage, approximately ? They average about 14 tons each.
725. Those boats are worked in fleets from schooners ? Yes; we have seven fleets.
726. At the present time those boats are being worked in Dutch waters ? Yes.
727. How long ago is it since those vessels were withdrawn from the industry in Torres Strait ? They
were withdrawn in 1905.
728. We should like to know briefly what reasons led up to their withdrawal ? Principally the labour
difficulty.
729. Was that the chief reason? The difficulty of working the boats at Thursday Island was the
scarcity of labour. I would like to explain to you how scarce that labour was. My company gave their
men £10,000 in advances before they did a stroke of work, and when they had that money the company
were in their power, as the men could work or not work as they pleased, just as it suited them.
730. That money was given to the men in the shape of advances ? Yes. If we had not given them that
money, other people would have done it; the demand for labour was so great.
731. Did you find that the giving of those large advances was detrimental to the carrying on of the
industry ? No doubt about it.
732. What was the reason for giving those advances ? The competition for labour by other shellers.
Burns, Philp, and Company, I believe, sent up word to their managers to get our divers, no matter what
it cost.
733. By Mr. Bennett-. That was only hearsay? The hearsay came from their managers.
734. By Mr. Douglas-. Was there any other reason which led up to your taking those vessels from
Torres Strait ? That was the principal reason. The low price of shell was also a factor in the matter.
Bor instance, in March, 1905, there was a slump of £50 a ton in the price in London.
J. Clark.
26May^l908


J. Clark.
26Ma^l9C8.
735. How do you account for a slump to that extent ? Just the same as you would account for the
slump in wool at the present moment. There was no control over the supply and demand.
.736. Was the demand less than the supply? The demand was less than the supply. For instance,
Western Australian shell comes in atone time, and then Thursday Island shell comes in. When all
that shell comes into the market together, and there is a greater supply of shell than is required, the
dealers can give whatever price they like.
737. Prior to that large slump in the price, what do you estimate was the average price for shell all
round? The price fluctuated very much. A few years ago, owing to the great demand for a particular
class of button in the market, I think we got £3OO a ton for shell; but there was a slump, and the price
came down to £l5O or £l6O net to ns—£lso probably.
738. And you found it was not profitable to carry on at that price ? That was not the principal difficulty.
The difficulty was with the men —they would not work; they came into Thursday Island and sold our
shell, and we had great difficulty in getting them to go out again.
739. Coloured labour is regulated by the Commonwealth ? Yes, but I understand that when an applica-
tion was made for labour, their officer at Thursday Island was asked to report whether the labour applied
for was necessary or not. If he reported that it was not necessary, the number applied for was cut down
to the number that he thought was required. May I ask a question ? Is that so, Mr. Bennett ?
Mr. Bennett : I cannot answer that question, lam here as a Commissioner, and not as a Common-
wealth officer.
740. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you recollect that there was a special Commissioner, Mr. Justice Dashwood,
appointed by the Federal Government in 1901 ? Yes.
741. I think his duties were concerned with the restriction of immigration? I know that Mr.
Justice Dashwood was there, but I did not give evidence, as I was not there at the time. There was
another Commission appointed by the Queensland Government to inquire into the working of the pearl-
shell fishing.
742. How long ago was that ? I think it was before the passing of the last Pearl-shell Act.
743. The Act of 1897—is that the one you are referring to ? Did Mr. Dickson pass that Act ?
744. Ido not recollect? There was an Act passed as the outcome of that Commission, preventing the
leasing of boats to aliens.
745. That is the 1899 Act—you did not give evidence before that Commission, did you ? I do not
think so.
746. Prior to leaving for Dutch waters, did you not find the beds were becoming partially denuded—Was
not that one of your reasons for withdrawing your vessels ? Some years ago I wrote some articles to
the paper, in which I stated that it is impossible to deplete the Old Ground, and I still hold that
opinion. If we had decent weather, like we get on the North-West coast, you would find that, as you
followed the shell further out, you would still get large deposits. But, in the strong south-east winds
and north-westers that we get in Torres Strait, we do not get enough time to prospect and develop
further beds, because all the good weather we get is necessary to keep on the grounds we know to get the
shell from there to pay expenses. My opinion is that you cannot deplete the Old Ground. You may work
it to a certain extent. For instance, I remember eleven boats getting 33 tons of shell in a fortnight—
that is an average of 3 tons apiece. But, having taken that shell away, they could not expect
to get as much in the future. In fact, we worked from 10 or 12 tons per boat per annum down to 3
or 4 tons.
747. Then you think the weather provides a great protection ? The weather itself provides all the
protection that the beds need.
748. In the year prior to your leaving the Strait was there an unduly large number of vessels
employed in the industry ? Ido not know that in that particular year there was an unduly large number
of boats. It was generally considered among us, prior to the Morgan-Kidston Government coming into
power, that there were sufficient boats employed in the fishery; but steps were taken to limit the
number to those who were there at that time. But immediately the Morgan-Kidston Government came
into power they were approached by certain Thursday Island people, who stated that a monopoly had
been given to those engaged in the business, and that it was not.right; and the Government removed
the restriction, and fresh licenses were issued.
749. The number of boats increased ? The boats increased considerably.
750. By Mr. Bennett: What year would that be in ? Ido not know the year.
751. By Mr. Douglas : The Morgan-Kidston Government came into power in 1903 —You think that, as
the result of the removal of the restriction, there are too many boats engaged in the industry ? Yes. I
do not believe in placing too many boats on the ground. To show that that is our feeling, when we got
a concession at the Aroe Islands we agreed not to place more than 150 boats on that ground—that is,
115 of ours and 35 belonging to other people.
752. Was that so that the ground should not be over-fished ? Yes. The Shark Bay beds were depleted
for the same reason—an unduly large uumber of boats were allowed to fish there.
753. Do you think that a restriction in the number of licenses is the best remedy, or one of the best
remedies, to prevent over-fishing ? That is a very good plan to adopt—not to have too many boats
licensed.
754. At the same time, as far as the Old Ground is concerned, you think the supply is practically
inexhaustible ? That is so. I will tell you my reasons for. that. In Western Australia we have a
similar ground—the Eighty-mile Beach. My boats helped to discover that ground about 1885. From
that time to this, with an increasing number of boats, that ground has stood it, with this difference —
that, in Queensland, all shell under 5 inches is protected, while in Western Australia it is not. They
can pick up, and they do pick up, shell 2 and 3 inches in diameter. Notwithstanding that, last year was
almost a record year for the quantity of shell produced. There are other means by which Nature
protects the beds. Very often you get muddy water. On the New Guinea coast, and all along there,
for instance, there is, perhaps, only one month in the year when you can get water sufficiently clear to
work. On the West Coast it is just the same. All along the Eighty-mile Beach the bottom inshore is
of mud, which gets stirred up. Now and again you get a chance to work there, and the shell is very
plentiful. At other times, you get a very thick growth of grass on the bottom, and it is utterly impossible
to find shell when that grass is there. By-and-by a gale comes along, or the grass dies off of itself, and
then you can get the shell.


755. Have you any knowledge o£ the present condition of the industry in Torres Strait ? No.
756. During the years that you worked there at times certain areas were closed with the object of giving
them an opportunity of replenishing the stock of pearl-shell ? Yes. 5
757. Do you think that is a wise course to pursue? No; because you cannot exercise proper control.
It simply means that the unscrupulous pearlers will work the ground, while the honest man will not.
The Japanese who fishes his boat on his own account will go there, and you cannot catch him.
758. Would it not be advisable to amend the Act, so that any boat found on a reserved area could be
dealt with severely by forfeiture, or imprisonment of the men in charge ? Ido not think you could do
that. We cannot even protect our oyster banks in Moreton Bay ; and, if you cannot do that, lam quite
satisfied you cannot protect an open bed up there.
759. Do you recollect the areas that were reserved ? Yes. I remember that Endeavour Strait was
reserved, but that did not stop people fishing there. In any case, Ido not think it would be altogether a
good plan, for this reason: That we have not sufficient evidence before us to show that a bed would
recover within a given time. I dare say I have paid more attention to that matter than most other people.
1 will give you an instance. Take Friday Island Passage. I went to live at Friday Island Passage
in 1882. Seven years before that it was a virgin shell ground. Captain Chapman came along with his
boats, and I think he got 40 or 50 tons of shell. Then it lay idle until I came along in 1882. I put my
boats to work, and I got about 1J- tons of shell off the ground. We sent our boats there again seven
years after that, and I think we got 2 tons of shell from a place that originally yielded 40 or 50 tons.
760. That particular ground had not been worked in the meantime ? No.
761. In the earlier days of pearl-shelling you worked your vessels from a shore station ? Yes.
762. How long was it after you went up there that you went in for floating stations? -We introduced
the schooners when we went to Western Australia. Up to that time we had never got any pearls at
Thursday Island. The men got all the pearls, and with the profits from those pearls they used to drink
and gamble. Instead of being at work they were half the time drinking the grog they could get at
Thursday Island.
763. In those days did you employ European divers ? Yes.
764. Did they get the pearls ? Yes. According to the custom which prevailed, the pearls belonged to
the divers, but our articles provided that all the pearls should be given up.
765. Did you employ many Europeans at that time ? No ; only two or three, but that was a fairly large
proportion, seeing that I worked only eight boats.
766. At the time you went to W estern Australia, were the men who were engaged in pearl-shelling
there working the industry with floating stations ? It was reported to us before we went to Western
Australia that the fishery was exhausted. They employed only swimming divers, and they could only
scratch along the reefs in shallow waters. With our experience at Thursday Island we concluded that, if
we went further out where the natives could not go, we would find large deposits of shell. We did so,
and the fishery has been going ever since.
767. In what year did you go ? In 1885. The same difficulty operated then. We could get no labour
or divers. I would go into a boarding-house at Thursday Island, and would see a group of men sitting
gambling. Our boats would be tied up, and we would ask those men to sign on, and not one of them
would take any notice of us.
768. What nationality were those men ? Principally South Sea men and Malays, and there were a few
Japanese.
769. How many boats were working in the industry in Torres Strait at that time ? About 100.
770. By Mr. Bennett-. All told ? Yes.
771. By Mr. Bouylas : Including swimming vessels ? Yes.
772. Was the shell scarce at that time? The shell was scarcer when we started in 1881 than it is now,
because we had not found the Old Ground. We found the Old Ground in the latter end of 1881.
773. You had been working the Old Ground ? Not before that; we did not know of its existence
till 1881.
774. You had been working it before 1885, when you left ? Yes.
775. And you found the shell was scarce ? No; the shell was plentiful enough, but the difficulty of
getting labour and the difficulty of the work then were so great that we thought we would try a new
plan—that is with the schooner.
776. Did you find that the schooner system was a better system on which to work the industry than the
shore system ? Altogether a better system.
777. What are its principal advantages ? It has many advantages. In the first place, you can exercise
supervision over your boats ; secondly, you can collect the shell, and get the pearls from them ; and, in
the third place, you can repair any damage that has been done to your gear, such as the breakage of a
corselet stud. I have had a man lose a fortnight going from the Old Ground to Somerset to get his
corselet repaired. Then, again, if a man gets sick, you can replace him with one from the schooner. But
I think the greatest advantage in a ground as extensive as the Old Ground is that you have the schooner
as a mark. You are outside of all land, the shell lies, perhaps, in little layers or streaks, and, if you drift
off the place where it lies, you cannot pick it up again without a schooner. But if you have a schooner
at anchor, and a boat drifts off the shell, the men can take their bearings from the schooner and go back
and pick up the same ground again. Since we left, the divers who remained at Thursday Island have
said that they miss the schooner very much, because they have now no marks to go by.
778. Would not working by that system tend to rake up the shell too quickly, and not give it a chance
of throwing off spat and recuperating ? No ; both inside and outside of where we worked there are
immense quantities of shell. We have got shell as far as we have gone. In all probability the spawn of
the shell that we got at the Aroe Islands came from Thursday Island, because at the back of the Aroe
Islands the water is so deep that Ido not think the shell could live there. It drops away to 300, 500, or
1,000 fathoms.
779. What is the greatest depth you have known shell to be obtained in p Thirty fathoms, at Darnley
Island.
780. It is very plentiful there, is it not? We have never worked at Darnley Island.
781. Do you think that, when you get to a greater depth, 50 fathoms and over, the pressure will be too
great for the shell ? I could not say that.
782. There is really no information as to the maximum depth at which shell exists? No,
J. Clark.

783. But you think it does exist right across to the Aroo Islands ? I hare no doubt about that. Wherever
, you try you will probably pick up shell, not in payable quantities, but you can pick it up down as far as
. Broadsound.
784. Do you contemplate bringing any of your vessels back to Torres Strait from the Aroe Islands ?
We have too many boats at the Aroe Islands to fish the place, and we must employ them somewhere ; we
are not going to let them remain idle.
785. In the event of your returning to Torres Strait, would you consider it absolutely necessary for
carrying on operations there to work from a floating station ? I think that is the best way of working
the boats.
786. It might be the best way from the point of view of getting as much shell as possible in a short space
of time, but the question is whether it is to the advantage of the beds that they should be so constantly
fished ? Is the Commission prepared to receive an offer from me ?
787. I presume we are here to collect evidence ? This is evidence.
788. We are open to receive any suggestions? Well, lam prepared to give the Queensland Govern-
ment a rental of £5,000 a year for a twenty-years’ lease. They are getting only £5OO a year now.
789. In saying that they are getting only £5OO a year now, from what source do you say that they get
that income ? Ton are getting £5OO a year from licenses.
790. Prom licenses alone ? Tes, and, instead of that, I will give £5,000 a year for a lease for twenty
years.
791. You do not mean to say that £5OO a year from licenses is the only revenue the Queensland
Government get ? I would come in just the same, and would pay to the revenue just the same as other
people do.
792. It might pay you, with a lease like that, to let the fishing-grounds remain idle for four or five years ?
What odds ?
793. The Queensland Government get a certain amount of revenue from Customs ? I wmuld work with
a certain number of boats, and would undertake not to work more than a certain number.
794. Would you undertake to keep the revenue up to £15,000 a year ? I would undertake to pay the
same duties as are paid at the present time, and, if any alteration of the law wms made, to pay the altered
duties. We are working under a concession from the Dutch Government just now. The Ceylon
Government have sold the lease of their fisheries. lam also a leaseholder of oyster beds here. Why
could not these things be worked in the same way as they are in the cases I have mentioned, leaving it to
the lessees to work the beds as profitably and as much as they can safely be worked?
795. Before passing on to the matter of the scientific cultivation of pearl-shell, I should like to get from
you some expression of opinion regarding the possibility of employing a larger number of Europeans in
the capacity of divers—At the present rates of pay, do you consider it is possible for white men to obtain
a living at diving ? At Thursday Island, or where ?
796. At Thursday Island ? Ido not know how much divers there are getting. I believe they sign
articles in the shipping office at one rate, and
797. That is hardly an'answer to my question—Do you know what is the recognised current rate of wages
paid to divers at Thursday Island ? Ido not.
798. Well, the rates when you were working there ? Tes ; probably an average of £25 per ton.
799. Would it pay Europeans to work at that rate? Of course it would not. A labourer working on
the streets would earn £lOO a year, and you would never get a man to go up there and work at a
dangerous occupation like diving for that money.
800. How many tons of pearl-shell do you estimate an ordinary diver, whether a coloured man or a
European, could get, working on the Old Ground ? Ido not think a white diver’s take would be as large
as that of a Japanese. If a Japanese got 5 tons a year, I should say that the average white man would
not get more than tons.
801. By Mr. Bennett: Would you consider a Japanese who got 5 tons a good diver ? Tes.
802. Or any coloured diver? Tes. I think it is a well-understood fact that the Japanese diver is the
best diver in the world for getting shell. He is worth 25 per cent, more than any other coloured diver
you could get.
803. By Mr. Douglas: Is a rate of £25 a ton profitable to a Japanese? Japanese are so poorly paid in
their own country that they think it much better to work at that rate than to stay in their own land.
804. You have been in Japan, have you not? Tes.
805. Have you any knowledge of the laws regarding the employment of people in the fisheries there ?
I think most of them are employed in their own little boats. I have seen thousands of boats fishing.
Japan has a very large fishing population, as have all those Eastern countries. In China, Manila, and
everywhere in the Malay Archipelago, there are millions of people out in their own little fishing-boats,
particularly at night, when you will see thousands of lights shining where the fishermen are at work.
806. Do you know whether they have any laws regulating the fishing and preventing any but people of
their own nationality from engaging in the industry ? 1 believe every country tries to keep its fisheries
for its own people.
807. That would be so with Japan ? Tes.
808. By Mr. Bennett : Do you know whether it is so ? I know that within their territorial limits it
is so.
809. By Mr. Douglas-. Were the white divers who were employed in Torres Strait in the early days a
class of men who would have been likely to stick permanently to the industry if aliens had not been
introduced ? Ido not think so. For instance, we had Niel Andersen, who was the finest white diver
we ever had in the Strait.
810. Was he employed by you ? He was employed by the adjoining station, which belonged to a man
named O’Hagan and some other man—two grocers, 1 think they were, in Sydney. Then I took up
lolman from Brisbane, and made a diver of him. 1 took up him and his brothers. Tolman was not a
success.
811. He became the owner of several vessels himself ? Tes. He had splendid chances, but in the end he
begged Burns, Philp, and Co. to give him a few pounds and let him get out of it, and they took over his
property.
812. That was some time after, though—What year was that ? He probably went out of the fishing
in 1895.


813. That was the time Burns, Philp, and Co. took over his vessels ? Yes; but he told me when we
secured a lease of the coast down Cooktown way that that was the first time he had ever been out of debt.
Just immediately after that he got into debt again, and became so heavily involved that Burns, Philp, and I
Co. took over his plant.
814. Then he was tied to Burns, Philp, and Co.? Yes..
815. Did he get full value for his shell ? I could not say.
816. Being tied to a particular firm might have had something to do with his not making a complete
success of it ? Ido not think so. I do not think that Burns, Philp, and Co. wanted more than a fair
profit from their business with him—which was only natural.
817. If regulations had been in existence in the early days by which aliens were not permitted to engage
as divers, would it not have meant that white divers would have been employed ? Ido not think so.
818. Would not the demand for shell have meant a price for shell that would warrant it? You must
bear in mind that there are other countries producing pearl-shell, such as the Aroe Islands, Mergui in
Burmah, the Philippine Islands, up in the Admiralty Islands, and other places ; and the shell from there
always comes into competition with the shell produced by us.
819. Is their shell of equal quality ? The Aroe shell is of the same nature. AYestern Australia, the
Aroe Islands, and Torres Strait produce the silver-lip shell, which, of course, is the most valuable. At all
the other places you get the gold-lip variety.
820. AYould the other countries of the world be able to supply the demand without Torres Strait?
Possibly they would. Por instance, see our success at the Aroe Islands. AYe have raised 2,200 tons of
shell in three seasons.
821. Is that likely to keep up ? I think it will—not quite so much, for the simple reason that we have
worked out some patches, and we shall have to go looking for others. But, on the other hand, the
fisheries in the Philippine Islands are developing, and you- never know what large quantities may be got
there, although the quality may not be quite so good. Yet, being in the market, the output from there
must lower the price of our shell.
822. I understand the American Government have pretty severe restrictions with regard to the vessels
engaged in the industry in the Philippine Islands? Those restrictions have been repealed. All that it
is necessary to do now is to have American-owned ships or an American company. It is very easy to
fall into line with those conditions. You simply get an American partner, and register the boats in his
name.
823. But the vessels themselves have to be built by Americans ? No; that law has been repealed.
824. Do they permit divers of all nationalities to be employed ? Oh, yes. I know the Japanese are
working there now. Some boats went from Port Darwin to fish there, and they are fishing there now.
825. By Mr. Benneil : AYere they run away with, or did they go over with their owner’s consent ?. The
owner took them across himself—a man named Holmes.
826. By Mr. Douglas: Then you think the amount of shell produced by other countries would not
permit of white divers being employed in Torres Strait—that wldte divers could not be paid a fair wage ?
Yes, and there is another thing that we who are engaged in shelling must always bear in mind. There
are other shells which are used as substitutes for mother-of-pearl. There is the “helmet” shell, then
there is the “ green snail ” shell, and a conical shell called “ trochas,” which is produced in thousands of
tons. That is the shell that the French people are working instead of mother-of-pearl, and that is tho
reason why Fiance is such a poor consumer of our shell. If the price of mother-of-pearl shell became
too high, it would leave a wide opening for the trochas shell to be used.
827. Trochas shell competes very severely with mother-of-pearl in the manufacture of buttons? Yes;
and it can be obtained for £l5 or £l6 a ton. "You cannot get the same amount of pearl from it, as
there is more waste; but it can be obtained at such a low price that it is a strong competitor with
mothor-of-pearl.
828. AYhen you were working at Thursday Island, what were about the average earnings of an alien
diver ? I could not tell—l was not actively employed.
829. But you would have a knowledge of the average catch per boat, and the wages paid ? Probably,
taking one year with another, from 1890 to the end of 1904, our divers would average 5 tons of shell a
year, and the rate of pay would be about £25 a ton. That would be, roughly, £125 a year.
830. By Mr. Bennett-. AYith keep, of course? Yes.
831. By Mr. Douglas : They got no part of the value of the pearls that the shell contained ? The pearls
at Thursday Island are a very small matter.
832. Was it always so ? Always on the Old Ground. To the eastward at Mangrove Island there was
a splendid place for pearls, and at Darnley Island. Endeavour Strait was not so bad, but on the Old
Ground very few pearls were obtained.
833. In the old days, when shell was plentiful, tho Old Ground did not produce many pearls? No
834. There are particular pearling-grounds where large quantities of pearls have been obiained? Yes.
In Princess Charlotte Bay it would not pay to open the shells to look for pearls. It has a muddy bottom,
and that kind of bottom does not produce pearls.
835. What is the reason pearls are not produced in certain localities ? There are no irritants.
836. The Old Ground has not got a muddy bottom ? No ; but it has a grassy bottom.
837. Then the best pearls may be found on a coral bottom ? Coral or stony ground. For instance, at
the Lacepede Islands and iu their vicinity there is a mass of dead coral, and it is a splendid place for
pearls. Further down tho west coast, at Cape Latouche Treville, almost every shell had pearls.
838. Can you give us an approximate idea, say, for fifteen vessels over a period of five years, of the
average yearly value of the take of pearls at Thursday Island ? About £l,OOO.
839. That would be about £66 per boat per year? Yes —say about £lO per ton; so that you might put
the total earnings of a diver, if he obtained all the pearls, at £175 per annum.
840. Do you not think that would be a sufficient inducement for a European to engage in pearl-shelling
No. Life is too easy in Australia for men to adopt a life like that for £175 a year. They can earn twic
as much money at shearing.
841. You think the North offers other attractions for white men? We have no fishing population. N
doubt if we had a fishing population it would be a different matter. The life is hard, especially a
Thursday Island, where the trade winds blow so strongly.

842. The alien divers at Thursday Island at present number about 140—Supposing regulations were
■\ framed by which no further licenses would be issued to any fresh divers other than white men—allowing,
8. of course, the present holders to renew their licenses—what would be the result ? I think the industry
would die out.
843. But there would be the present divers ? In time those men would leave or die. I saw in the last
Thursday Island paper I got that one of the best divers had been brought in dead from Darnley. See
the list of deaths there have been. After the first of those deaths occurred Sir Hugh Nelson sent for
me, for the Hon. John Douglas, and, I think, for Dr. Thomson, to inquire what steps could be taken to
save those menls lives. I advocated the closing of those grounds—not to allow men to go there at all.
844. But they were not compelled to go there by their employers ? You cannot use compulsion. They
went of their own free will; but I dare say 100 men have lost their lives there. A proclamation was
issued closing those grounds, but still the deaths went on. That shows that proclamations are of no use.
I have not heard of a conviction, although it does not follow that convictions have not been obtained for
working in those waters. Perhaps Mr. Bennett may know if there have been any convictions.
845. By Mr. Bennett : Yes; I got some myself ? It did not stop diving there, anyhow.
846. Can you give us any idea of the condition of the pearling-grounds in Torres Strait in 1905, when
your fleet was withdrawn ? Ido not know that it was any different from what it has been at any other
time. Certainly, the shell was scarcer than it had been in previous years; but you cannot wonder at
that, seeing the great number of boats that were licensed.
847. When you went up first in 1881 what were the grounds that were most generally worked—Of course
I understand that most of the work then was done by swimming diving, was it not ? No. When I went
up in 1881 the Warrior Island patch was then worked out. It was known as the Wappa Ground. I
remember asking Mr. Craig whether I should go up and adopt that sort of life. He said, “No ; you are
ten years too late. All the shell has been fished up.” But a few months after that we found the Old
Ground, and that has been keeping us going ever since.
848. When you went up there was the shell in the vicinity of Endeavour Strait, the Prince of Wales
Group, also at Badu and Mua, pretty well cleaned out ? Yes ; some of our boats were working at the
Wappa. The first place I went to was the Wappa. Then we had seventy swimmers at the Orman Eeef.
We cleared them out in about two months. Some of our boats were working in the vicinity of Albany
Pass, or anywhere where they could scratch up a few shell.
849. Those grounds—that is, the grounds to the eastward of the Prince of Wales Group and Mua and
Badu—were pretty well depleted then, were they not ? Yes. Afterwards we found shell down at the
Hannibals, and all along there.
850. At that time you would find patches of shell in various places which had not been touched
before? We did not find any until we struck the Old Ground. All the grounds that we knew had
been worked over.
851. Prom your personal knowledge of the grounds, and from your connection with the industry, which
grounds do you consider in the most productive state at the present time ? Where do you mean—
in Western Australia?
852. No. lam speaking all the time of Torres Strait ? I would never want to work anywhere but on
the Old Ground.
853. You consider the Old Ground is the ground of Torres Strait ? Yes, especially for anyone
working with a schooner. If I were engaged in shelling at Thursday Island, I would not like my boats to
go and work on Darnley, because there is only one result there—you will lose your men, and Ido not
want to earn my living at the cost of men’s lives, and that is what it means. To get over that difficulty
you would have to go into shallow water.
854. What do you consider shallow water ? Anything up to 15 fathoms, as compared with 30 fathoms
at Darnley Island.
855. Can you say how long what we call the Torres Strait pearling-grounds, down to, say, Cape
Grenville, and westward of the Old Ground, have been working—How long ago is it since the first shell
was worked in Torres Strait at the Warrior Islands? They began to be worked in 1868.
856. Between that and 1870, was it not ? Just about that time; but you will get those particulars more
accurately from Albert Colless.
857. Taking the grounds as a whole, they have been worked continuously, have they not ? Yes.
858. Barring such rests as they might get from wind and weather, dirty water, and so on ? Yes.
859. Have the grounds been worked with any regard to the preservation of the industry ? No ; except
during the time that Mr. Philp restricted the number of licenses.
860. Do you know in what year the fishery attained its maximum of productiveness —the year the greatest
tonnage of shell was raised? I cannot remember the year. I think we obtained 1,100 tons of shell one
year.
861. Twelve hundred tons odd ? Twelve hundred tons, was it ?
862. If you look up the returns, I think you will find that it was in 1897 ? Those returns were a little
misleading. Our take is put in with that of others.
863 Taking it that the maximum tonnage was obtained in 1897, have you any idea of what the yield per
year has been since then—Has the decrease been marked ? No ; I do not think so, when you take
everything into consideration. The take of pearl-shell depends altogether upon the weather. If you get
good weather you get an increased take, and the opposite if you get bad weather. That remark applies
to all our fisheries.
864. On reference to the returns, I find that in 1897 there were 223 boats employed, that is all boats,
swimming and diving; they obtained 1,223 tons of shell; in the following year, 307 boats obtained 1,061
tons of shell; in 1899, 319 boats obtained 1,200 tons of shell; in 1900, 341 boats obtained 1,060 tons of
shell—Taking those figures—and afterwards the decrease was more marked—would you not consider
that they point to a diminution in the supply of shell? There is no doubt about that, but you
must take the weather into account a little bit. But, as I have already said, a large number of boats
must make an impression on the quantity of shell on the ground.
865. Have you any idea how many pump boats are employed in the Torres Strait fisheries ? lam told
that there are 108, but I fancy that some more licenses have been issued since, so that the number is
probably 120.

866. Do you consider that the deposits of shell in Torres Strait are sufficient to keep the number of boats
now licensed fully and profitably employed ? I think the ground could very safely support more.
867. You consider that the ground would support more boats than are at present employed? Yes.
868. Without further depletion of the beds ? Yes. May I offer a suggestion to the Commission ?
869. Certainly ? I think it would be very interesting for the Department to know where the shell comes
from—how much comes from Darnley Island, how much from the eastward, and how much from the
Old Ground. That information would assist you very much in ascertaining to what extent each place
is worked, and the quantity of shell obtained at each place.
870. Can you give us any idea of the tonnage of shell obtained from the Old Ground in any year up to
the time you left? We could give you particulars of all the shell we got. A little of our shell came
from Endeavour Strait, some from Eed Point, and the balance from the Old Ground.
871. What is your opinion as to the probable effect of the periodical closure of certain beds as a means of
allowing the ground to recover—I am speaking more particularly now of the grounds to the eastward of
the Old Ground ? I do not think they will recover. I do not think it is any use closing them. I base
my opinion upon my knowledge of Friday Island Passage. I had a splendid opportunity of watching
that place during the two terms of seven years that I lived there, and I found that the beds did not
restock themselves anything like as fast as I thought they would. Mind you, I think that on a ground
like the Old Ground, where probably the shell has not so many enemies as it has on the inshore beds, you
would get better results. In fact, it is well known that all the shell the Old Ground produces is not old
shell. It is practically young shell. You do not get any of the big old shell there.
872. The wormy shell ? Yes.
873. By the Chairman : Was your experiment in cultivation in Friday Island Passage interfered with by
the Japanese ? I am speaking of the time before we made that experiment.
874. By Mr. Bennett : You do not consider, then, that the closure of the beds is likely to lead to an
improvement in the production of shell ? I do not think so.
875. You know Endeavour Strait and the various passages between the Prince of Wales Group and the
mainland very well ? Yes.
876. Have not some of those passages and grounds shown considerable powers of reproductiveness? I
have no knowledge that they have. I do not think they have anything like the amount of shell there
now that there was originally.
877. If it should be decided that some grounds should be closed, can you suggest to the Commission the
best grounds to close ? As an experiment ?
878. Yes ? I should say Endeavour Strait.
879. Including in that the whole of the ground in Endeavour Strait up to Peak Point ? Yes; I think
that would bo a splendid ground to close with a view to trying the experiment.
880. Do you consider that it is a ground which could be easily patrolled and watched ? Yes.
881. And that a patrol station could be easily established there ? Yes, it is a spot adapted for that.
882. Would you suggest any place which would be useful for a patrol station—say Dayman Island ?
You want to make it as central as possible to exercise the greatest amount of supervision.
883. What about Entrance Island ? I would go further to the south —somewhere about Port Lihou.
884. At Port Lihou would you not be shut out of all view of the north-east end of the Strait ? From
Port Lihou, I think, you could see Entrance Island. The fishery where the great quantity of shell is
obtained would be almost opposite to you at Port Lihou. Or you might establish a station at Eed
Island.
885. If Endeavour Strait was closed by proclamation, the proclamation must be enforced—Can you suggest
any means of enforcing it ? If you fined an offender, or forfeited any boat found there, that would be
very arbitrary and harsh, because it is a highway. Yet, unless you do that, I do not think the closure
would be effective. A lot of boats go fishing down to Jardine Eiver.
886. They go there for water ? They go there for water, and it would be a very difficult matter to stop
boats going that way.
887. I am not speaking of the penalties to be enforced, but of the means to be employed—would you
suggest a patrol ? Yes; but that would be a very costly and difficult matter. Perhaps a regulation
might bo framed providing that any boat found at anchor within certain limits where shell is known to
exist should be confiscated, or a fine should be imposed, or something like that; though it is pretty hard
on the owner of a boat to have his boat confiscated when his men disobey his instructions not to go there.
888. By Mr. Douglas: Would it not be better to deal with the man who takes the boat there, by giving
him a term of imprisonment without the option of a fine ? Probably it would be better, but I am afraid
you would have to imprison a lot.

/—fo
27 May, 1908.
893. Were there any whites employed as divers during your term ? Yes, about half a dozen at the most.
894. Were they engaged on their own account or as subordinates to some of the companies ? Principally
v for themselves. I think one was in a subordinate position.
•• 895. There were some engaged for themselves ? Yes, as divers and owners.
896. Do you know what degree of success attended their efforts? The white divers who remained steady
and stuck to it appeared to be just as successful as the majority of the others. Of course, some of the
Japanese divers did better because they were more fearless. They would dive in deeper water.
897. If the white divers had been temperate men, would they have been as successful as the Japanese
divers ? I certainly think so.
898. Can you suggest any method by which the industry can be made more attractive to white divers ?
Most of the white men who have tried it were intemperate men. They would not remain at work long
enough to give it a fair trial. If the importation of Japanese as divers and crews could be limited or
prevented, something might be done. The present pearlers have permits from the Commonwealth
Government up to twenty, twenty-five, or thirty years to import Japanese on a three-years’ agreement;
and it is well known that the Japanese can work and live cheaper than the white man. There is,
therefore, very little encouragement to a white man to compete with them.
899. Then, in your opinion, it would be necessary to prohibit the Japanese engaging in the industry?
Yes. If the same terms were offered to white men that are offered to the Japanese, I do not see why
white men should not be tried there.
900. What terms are offered to Japanese? When I left Thursday Island the attractions were something
similar to these: A Japanese diver took charge of a boat and picked his own crew. He received from
the owner of the boat sums varying from £7O to £B5 per ton for the shell.
901. Would the owner of the boat be a white man ? Yes. The diver would pay all expenses—the
wages of his crew, provisions, and so on. I could mention particular instances where a man has made
as much as £l5O net profit in three months.
902. A Japanese ? Yes; and to my knowledge there were no complaints from the crew as to the non-
payment of wages or scarcity of provisions, or anything of that sort.
903. By Mr. Douglas-. Was that under the present system of working ? Under the present system of
payment by results.
9U4. By the Chairman : Do you think that system is deserving of being perpetuated ? If you could put
white men in the position that the Japanese hold at present, it would be a good thing for the whites.
905. How many men did the Japanese diver you speak of in your report have under him ? There were
two other divers with him in the boat, and they went down turn about.
906. Would it not be possible for young white men of good physique and endowed with a little spirit
of adventure to carry on the industry under the same conditions ? I certainly think so.
907. In your report for 1906 you refer to a vessel carrying a number of Japanese divers which obtained
a very large catch of shell ? Yes—the “ Sunshine,” owned by the Noma Pearl Shelling Company.
908. How many Japanese were employed ? There were three divers and a tender, and about five men for
the pumps.
909. By Mr. Bennett-. It was a very heavily-manned boat? Yes. Nearly all the big boats are heavily-
manned now.
910. By the Chairman : What catch did they make ? Of course I only had their statement; but they
said they got 13 tons for the year. I think the diver received £BO per ton, and he had to find everything
over and above the two dresses a year.
911. Do you approve of that system of working the industry ? I thought it was in contravention of the
Act, but, of course, as you will remember, I submitted the question to the Department, and the Crown
Solicitor ruled that it was not, as the diver had no interest in the vessel. The phrase “in the vessel”
he put in parentheses.
912. In your opinion that matter should be altered by fresh legislation ? I think so.
913. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think it is desirable to alter that system of working ? If the object is to
induce white men to go into the industry, I think it would be a good idea to allow that system to remain.
I would be rather in favour of that system as against the old system of paying the diver so much a ton
and the crew’s monthly wages. Many instances occurred under the old system where divers went out to
work and loafed. On one trip I came across two or three boats lying at anchor at Yam Island.
914. By the Chairman -. How does the present system operate as regards paying the crew—Does the
Japanese in charge always carry out satisfactorily his contract in regard to the payment of the crew?
Yes ; I had no trouble in that respect.
915. You always found that the Japanese paid their crows ? Yes. I can recall one instance where I
had to express my admiration of the conduct of the divers. There were two or three divers in a boat,
and one died. It was then necessary to settle up their affairs and appoint another diver in his
place, and when settling up they found that not enough shell had been obtained in the few weeks they
were out at work to pay expenses. The second diver refunded £l5 of his share of the catch, and the
other diver refunded a smaller amount, so that the crew should be paid. Of course, the idea was that if
the crew had been let in the divers as a body would have got a bad name.
916. Prom what you have seen yourself during your sojourn at Thursday Island, do you think there is
any insuperable diflßculty to prevent white men carrying on the industry ? No; Ido not think so.
917. I mean young men of good physique? That would be necessary. I see no reason why a young
white man, strong and healthy, should not make as good a diver as a Japanese. Of course, Japanese are
noted lor being fearless, but 1 do not suppose that Britishers would acknowledge that they are less fear-
less.
918. What would you suggest to make the industry more attractive to white men ? If a change was
made from aliens to white men, the interests of the owners of boats would have to be safeguarded. If
the employment of aliens was prohibited, or stopped short and sharp, you would not have an equal
number of white men ready to take their places.
919. The change would have to be effected gradually? If the alien divers could be put out of the
industry, and white men could be induced to enter into it, I see no reason why white men could not carry
it on with as much profit as the aliens make.
920. Are there many young white men growing up at Thursday Island ? No, not many.


921. Did you ever hear those who are there express any reluctance to enter the industry? They said
they could not compete with Japanese, as Japanese could work a boat much cheaper in the matter of
provisions than a European, and the monotony of the work was another objection that was urged.
922. The monotony of the work ? They do not care about the idea of spending three or six months out
at sea working boats, with no other amusement than is to be found in going ashore on the islands.
923. Would it be possible to carry on the industry from a station on an island? Yes ; the Act provides
for that by allowing them to get shore leases, but a good many of the grounds are out in the open sea.
There should be no difficulty in establishing stations on the islands something after the manner of floating
stations.
924. "Would not such an arrangement render it more attractive to white men, and induce three or four
to club together to work one or two boats ? If an arrangement could be made for white men to work
together on the share system, with some provision for a minimum wage, that should be practicable. At
present the rate of wages is controlled by the owners of vessels clubbing together. The present rate of
wages is from £1 15s. to £2 ss. a month, and that is no attraction to white men.
925. By Mr, Bennett: That rate is for the crew ? Yes. If the minimum rate of wages was the rate
paid to men employed on oversea merchantmen, then the pay might be attractive.
926. By the Chairman-. Suppose there were four or five white men interested in one boat, and they
relieved each other as divers, would it be possible for them to carry on at a profit ? They could only
work on the share system ; but I see no reason why that should not be done. I cannot remember one
instance while I was at Thursday Island in which any number of white men tried that scheme. The
coloured men work in that way. Where a Japanese picks his crew from his own countrymen, he and
the crew very often form a company.
927. By Mr. Douglas-. With regard to the present system of working, by which divers are paid £BO
per ton, as mentioned by you in connection with the “ Sunshine,” when did that system come into force?
It came into force, and was added to the articles, about the beginning of 1906, but in a few instances
such an agreement was in operation before.
928.. Is there a written agreement between the owner of the vessel and the diver? Yes; after the
opinion I have referred to was given by the Crown Solicitor, I always had the agreement embodied in the
articles as a diver’s agreement.
929. By the Chairman -. Then it is not a secret agreement between the owners of the boat and the
Japanese? No.
930. By Mr. Douglas: The agreement is endorsed on the articles? Yes.
931. Do you know what the object of that system of working is ? When a diver went out to work with
a boat’s crew, the owner of the boat was at his mercy —he was really in the hands of the diver. If the
diver went out with three months’ provisions, and did not work, unless the owner could prove neglect on
the part of the diver—and a prosecution would not benefit him, even if he obtained a conviction—he
would lose the three months’ provisions.
932. Then the present system means that the divers are paid no wages unless they get sufficient shell at
the rate of £BO per ton, or whatever the rate may be —it practically indemnifies the owner against any
loss on the working of the vessel ? Yes, that was the idea in establishing the system.
933. Under that system of agreement, who is responsible for the wages of the crew ? The owner of the
vessel.
934. So that, although the diver may not get any shell at all cjuring the time he is out, the owner or
master will be responsible for the payment of the wages of the crew —The wages are set forth in the
articles at so much per month in the usual way ? Yes.
935. What is the average wage paid to a Japanese crew? According to the articles, they are perhaps
£2 per month.
936. Do you consider that that is put in as a nominal amount? I think it is very often a nominaj
amount.
937. By Mr. Bennett-. But you could not say ? No. I only know that when the men were paid off
that was the amount of their wages, but I was very often suspicious that the money was handed back by
them to the diver, and that afterwards there was a general sharing of the money. All I had to do was
to see that the conditions of the articles were carried out, and beyond that I could not interfere.
938. By Mr. Douglas : As shipping-master, with that agreement endorsed on the articles, you would see
that the wages were paid as between the owner and the crew ? Yes. I insisted at the time the agree-
ments were brought in that the wages should be entered in the articles, except in cases where a Japanese
engaged his own countrymen. Then, if the men were agreeable, I allowed him to engage them at Is. a-
month—a nominal amount to make the agreement binding.
939. By Mr. Bennett : You say that Japanese engaged their own countrymen —Do I understand by that
that the articles were issued in the name of the Japanese ? No ; under the conditions of the agreement
it was perfectly plain to me that the Japanese himself was to engage the men, although it was dow r n
officially in the shipping records that the men were engaged by the owner of the vessel.
940. It was the owner of the vessel who engaged the men, so far as you were concerned ? Yes.
941. And the owner was responsible for the wages ? Yes. i
942. So that really the owner engaged the men r That is so. One of the conditions of the agreement
between the owner and the diver was that the diver should find his own crew, and he would pick them up
and bring them along to the shipping office.
943. By Mr. Douglas: There is a paragraph in your report for the year 1906 dealing with the Pearl-shell
and Beche-de-mer Fishery Act, in which you refer to the practice which is aptly described as “ dummy-
ing.”—Does that refer to the ownership of the boats ? Yes.
944. To boats in the pearl-shell fishery or in the beche-de-mer fishery ? It would apply to either. Both
industries are worked under the one Act. There were cases where I suspected that dummying was carried
on in the pearling industry, but I could not find any evidence substantial enough to work up a case. But,
as far as I could learn from hints which were dropped and little bits of information which came into my
possession, something of the sort had been done. Under the Act a Japanese was not allowed to obtain a
license for a vessel. Perhaps in diving he would make a good haul and obtain pearls worth a few hundred
pounds. Then he would like to have a boat of his own, and he would go to the owner of a boat, and say,
“ I would like to own a certain vessel.” He would make an offer for it, and propose to work the boat on
a sort of royalty. The owner would not take that offer, but I think he accepted from the diver a

sum of, say, £5OO as a loan without interest for an indefinite time, with which to build a boat, and that
boat would be licensed in the owner’s name, and the Japanese would work it. The terms of the agreement
t between the two were perhaps that the £5OO should be refunded on demand, or the boat handed over to
the Japanese. Of course, the Japanese, having that £5OO on deposit, would be interested in the boat,
and he would work it on the same conditions as other divers owning boats. But he could have
this promise—that until that money was handed back he would be sure of that boat and of an agreement
which would be renewed from year to year. Yery often, instead of his being only paid £B5 a ton for
shell, tho whole of the money was handed over to him ; but an account could very easily have been made
up if the shipping master had demanded to see the figures as they appeared on the articles. Of course, a
good deal of this is only suspicion, picked up from hints here and there.
945. Subsection (2) of section 2of the Act of 1889 reads : —“ If any unqualified perso i acquires any
interest, either legal or beneficial, in any ship hr boat engaged in the fishery, by sale, charge, lease, hire,
transfer, or otherwise howsoever, then, and in every such case, the license issued to such ship or boat to
engage in the fishery shall forthwith become null and void”—"What you speak of would appear to be an
evasion of the Act ? Tes; it would be a contravention of the Act.
946. Are there many cases of that kind in the pearl-shell fishing? I could not express an opinion upon
that point. I would not like to say there are a lot. There may not have been any, but I certainly had
reasons, here and there, for believing that something of the sort was being practised.
947. In your report for 1906 you mentioned that in one instance there was no case for a prosecution, as
the person concerned was a naturalised British subject ? Tes.
948. By Mr. Bennett: What was his nationality ? He was a Chinese storekeeper, holding a certificate of
naturalisation.
949. By the Chairman: Were there any white divers employed there during your time? Tes. There
was one, Johnny Andersen, who had a boat of his own. He held a license as a pearl-fisher and wrecker.
When the weather was favourable he went pearling, and when he could not do that he worked at the
wrecks. There were three brothers—Niel, Johnny, and Andrew. Andrew is dead, Johnny is in Sydney,
and Niel went to the Aroe Islands. Then Harry Colless was also diving.
950. By the Chairman : Did Andersen make a success of it ? He seemed to make enough out of it to
make frequent trips to Sydney and back. It was very hard to get out of any of them what they made.
951. By Mr. Bennett : I often knew, and anybody could know if he had the time to find out, what
amount of shell a boat brought into harbour ? As a rule I found them fairly willing to give me
information of that sort. In one or two cases where I had occasion to think some breach of tho Act of
1898 had been committed, I demanded, as the Act provides, tho production of books and papers; but
entries in the books gave very little information—“ By cash,” “By shell,” and entries like that. There
was nothing to show who received the money unless 1 had made a thorough audit of the books.
952. By Mr. Douglas: I notice in your report for 1906 you said that in that year there was a
considerable increase in the catch of beche-de-mer—something like 33 per cent, on the catch of the
previous year? I said something about the returns for beche-de-mer and tortoise-shell not being
absolutely reliable, because very often boats registered themselves as either tortoise-shell or beche-de-mer
boats, and then engaged in both fisheries; and, unless you took the catch of each boat separately, it was
very hard to arrive at more than an approximation. Tou could get the totals from the Customs.
953. By Mr. Bennett: Tou could get that from the Customs records of exports ? Tes.
954. By Mr. Douglas: Tou reported in 1906 there were seventy-six vessels engaged in the
beche-de-mer industry— Was that an increase on the previous year ? Tes. At the beginning of that
year there was a rise in the price of beche-de-mer, and a number of old pearl-shell boats, out of which the
pumps and gear had been taken, were fitted up for beche-de-mer.
955. According to your report, there were only eighteen beche-de-mer boats in 1905 ? Tes; but a
number of boats which were entered at the Customs as tortoise-shell boats were also engaged in the
beche-de-mer fishery; and all I could do was to take what was shown in the Customs’ register.
956. According to your report there was a decrease of 251 tons in the catch of pearl-shell in 1905 ?
That was the year that the Clark fleet went away, so that, practically, there were 109 boats less working
from about June in that year.
957. That accounts for the decrease ? Tes.
958. Do you recollect how that company came to leave the Strait? I can only go by their own state-
ments. They gave as their reasons that the Commonwealth Government had made the labour conditions
so difficult for them that they could not obtain sufficient labour, and also that the catches of shell were
not up to their expectations, and they could do better elsewhere.
959. By Mr. Bennett: Those were the two reasons ? The two principal reasons. In other words, they
said that labour at the Aroe Islands was a great deal cheaper. They could get strong, capable men there
for £1 a month, whereas the minimum wage on Thursday Island was £2 a month. Another reason was
that there would be no —or very little —Customs duty on provisions, and so on.
960. By Mr. Douglas: Is it not natural to conclude that the exodus of the Clark fleet, in 1905, and the
transference of a number of vessels to the beche-de-mcr industry were due to a considerable depletion of
the pearl-shell beds ? I tfiink the reason was that at that time the price of shell was low, and the price
of bcche-de-mer was high. Then a number of good patches of beche-de-mer were discovered as far down
the coast as Mackay.
961. Do you think the pearl-shell beds had been over-fished up to the year 1905 ? I think so. One
sign of that is to be found in the increased catch per boat the following year. It increased from about
2y tons per boat per annum, to nearly 4 tons —to really 4 tons, if you take into consideration the idle boats.
962. Do you not think the weather has a great deal to do with the catch of shell? Undoubtedly.
963. In the years up to 1905, when the catch was steadily declining, were the weather conditions more
unfavourable than they were in years when the shell was more plentiful ? I could not say. Being
fastened on the Island it was very difficult to judge what the weather was like outside.
964. By Mr. Bennett : How long were you on Thursday Island altogether ? Five years.
965. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think that tho beds were becoming depleted ? I certainly think so.
966. There were too many boats for the industry ? There were certainly too many boats for the
industry. The beds w'ere not rich enough for the great number of boats working there at the time.
That is shown hy the increased catch per boat after the other boats left.


967. By Mr. Bennett: You consider that supports the opinion you hare just expressed ? Yes. Another
proof of that is to be found in the decrease in the catch of small shell during the following year. I
worked it out, and while the catch of shell between 5 inches and 6 inches in diameter in the previous
year was nearly 5 per cent., although the catch the next year was nearly doubled, the catch of small
shell decreased to about 2 per cent.
968. That would indicate that, if shell were plentiful, the disposition would be to'leave the small shell;
alone and take the large shell ? I certainly think so. Of course, the larger shell is the more profitable. ■
969. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea as to the average annual earnings of a diver in Torres Strait ?.
A great deal depends on the weather. During fine weather a diver would make a good deal more.
970. But taking the average for the year ? I have seen a diver get between £6O and £BO for a quarter,
after paying all expenses for wages, and so on. Of course, that was during good weather. Then probably
there would be another quarter in which he would incur a considerable loss.
971. But what would be his average annual earnings? I should say that a good diver would make
between £2OO and £3OO a year.
972. That is not counting pearls at all ? No. Say about £2OO to £250 a year.
973. By the Chairman : Then you think an estimate of £lOO a year is too small ? Yes. A man who
could not make more than £lOO a year would not be a diver at all.
974. By Mr. Douglas: In addition to the £2OO a year, they would get pearls and their provisions ? Yes.
975. By Mr. Bennett-. That is under the £BO a ton system? Yes. One Japanese diver, Okomoto,
who afterwards shot himself, boasted to me, a couple of days before he shot himself, that he had drawn
£l5O in two months and some odd days, and that he also got a pearl worth £450. That was £6OO for
less than a quarter’s work. ■ ,
976. By the Chairman: That should be some incentive to white men? Another man—Goichi Okida—
made a good scoop of shell just before I left, and sold a pearl for £450.
977. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that £lOO a year would be a low estimate of a diver’s earnings ?
Certainly, for the best divers.
978. By Mr. Bennett : But take the average diver? I certainly think it would be a low estimate for a
Japanese diver. There are Manila divers who would not make £2O a year.
979. By Mr. Douglas: What would you estimate as the average catch per boat for a fleet of fifteen boats
in 1906 ? I should think it would be safe to take an average of 5 tons per boat. Some boats might get
very little, and they would reduce the average.
980. By Mr. Bennett : You speak of an average of 5 tons per boat ? Eire or six tons, and up to 13 tons
for the best boats. Very often boats with two or three divers got as much as 13 tons ; but 5 tons would
be the catch for a boat with one diver.
981. By Mr. Douglas : That was a rather higher average than they had been getting the first few years
you were there ? Yes. Before that 4 tons was always looked upon as a good catch.
982. Do New Guinea natives give satisfaction as crews? Only as pump hands.
983. By the Chairman : They would not make good divers ? No. Ido not think they have the heart.
981. By Mr. Douglas: New Guinea natives are not engaged before the Shipping Master at Thursday
Island ? No.
985. By Mr. Bennett : They are engaged and paid off at Daru ? Yes.
986. By Mr. Douglas: None of the wages paid to them are paid in Queensland? No. The whole of
their earnings are handed over to the Shipping Master at Daru or some other New Guinea port.
987. Therefore Queensland gets no benefit from them? No; except in regard to the provisions they
eat, and a good deal of their food—sago, and so on —is brought from New Guinea.
988. By Mr. Bennett: Are not the agreements you speak of always signed by the owner of the boat ?
Yes.
959. Who in any case is a European ? Yes. .
990. And a British subject ? Yes.
991. Then those men who have signed on to receive £BO per ton of shell, after all expenses are paid, are
the employees of those British owners ? Yes.
992. And the tender and crew are also employees of British owners? Yes.
993. The earnings of the divers would be paid by the owners ? Yes. The wages of the crew would be
made up before the owner and presented at the shipping office, and the owner, using his cheque-book,
would pay the crew while I was standing by. After the wages were taken out of the earnings of the
boat, the remainder would be handed to the diver as his earnings. The cost of provisions would be
included in the expenses.
994. The diver pays for the provisions ? Yes, for the provisions and repairs to the boat.
995. By Mr. Douglas: Repairs to the boat only, or repairs to the gear? Repairs to the boat as well as
to the gear. Some allow two dresses and some only one dress to the diver.
996. By Mr. Bennett: Is that entered in the agreement ? Yes. The diver purchases any more he may
require after that.
997. Supposing the boat got aground, or a mast was blown away, who would pay for that? The diver.
998. So that there is no question but that he has an interest in the boat ? So I thought myself.
999. By the Chairman: It is like a charter under which the charterer would be responsible for all
incidental repairs to vessels ? That is what I thought; but I did not feel competent to decide the matter.
1000. By Mr. Bennett: He was liable to keep the boat in good repair ? Yes.
1001. By Mr. Douglas: Are you sure upon that point—Was it the boat or the gear, because there is a
difference between the two ? Where the diver was held to be responsible for the repairs to the boat,
it was so expressed in the agreement. Unless it was expressed in the agreement, I would not have allowed
the cost of repairs as a deduction from the diver.
1002. By Mr. Bennett: Is it your opinion that any benefit would accrue to the industry from the closure
of part of the shelling-grounds for certain periods ? I should think so, where it is shown that the catch
is decreasing. There are some grounds which are much easier to work than others, and the less expert
divers make for those grounds. .
1003. Supposing some grounds were closed, what is your idea as to the best means of enforcing the
closure ? You would want a station and a patrol.

1004. If Endeavour Strait were closed, what would be the best means of enforcing the closure of that
ground ? I should say that a station should be established on an island commanding a good view of the
N ground. The station should be placed on some high place, and there should be a patrol something like
8 - the coastguards. The person in charge should have a steamer or some means of getting about placed at
his disposal, so as to be able to deal with persons trespassing on the grounds. There should be a constant
patrol by some vessel.
1005. You are aware that the present exportable limit of shell is 5 inches ? Yes.
100 G. And that it was formerly 6 inches ? Yes.
1007. Is it your opinion that the 5-iuch limit should be retained ? I think the limit should be increased
to 6 inches, considering the small catch of shell that is now made. The limit can be increased to 6 inches
without any hardship to anyone.
1008. Judging from the size of shell which you know has been exported, it would not be a great hardship
to increase the limit to 6 inches ? No.
1009. That is what you mean by 2 per cent, being under 6 inches ? Yes ; out of every 100 cases of shell
exported only two cases would contain shell between 5 and 6 inches.
1010. Have you ever seen comparative weighings of 5 and 6-inch shell made, and noted the difference in
weight between the two ? Of course, I have seen plenty of shell weighed, but I have not taken much
notice of individual weights.
1011. Do you know the approximate weight of an ordinary shell of 5-inch nacre ? I should say between
i-lb. and f-lb.
1012. Have you any idea of the weight of an ordinary 6-inch shell ? My idea can only be a guess. I
should say it would be a couple of ounces heavier than the weight of a 5-inch shell —not much more.
1013. You have not weighed one? No.
1014. At present vessels engaged in the industry are allowed to go out without a certificated master,
provided they do not exceed 25 tons gross measurement ? Yes.
1015. Do you think that practice should be adhered to ? I think so.
1016. For what reason ? In the first place it would be very hard to obtain a sufficient number of
certificated masters to man every boat over 15 tons engaged in the industry. Then you would have to
pay a certificated master wages, at the lowest, of from £8 to £lO per month, possibly £l5 per month,
and those men would simply take charge of the boats, and would probably not engage in diving.
1017. Most of the pearl boats engaged from Thursday Island, especially the newer ones, are 15 tons?
Yes; pretty well all the newer boats are 15 tons and over. They run from 12 to 21 tons.
1018. If the provision in the Navigation Act to which reference has been made were enforced, most of
the boats would require to have a certificated master as well as a licensed diver? Yes ; I should say
very nearly two-thirds of them.
1019. Do you not think it would be an advantage, from the point of view of increasing the number of
whites engaged in the industry, that tenders of 25 tons and down to 15 tons—there are not many tenders
of 15 tons, I know—should have a certificated master ? Yes. I think a tender should, as it travels
periodically between the Island and the fleet. I think it would be an advantage to place them under the
care of a certificated master.
1020. They have to go many miles out to sea, especially on the Old Ground ? Yes, and they have to
travel at night, as well.
1021. I suppose there are not many masters employed on those vessels at Thursday Island at the present
time ? No.
1022. They are in charge of men who are merely licensed under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer
Fisheries Act ? Yes.
1023. Have you formed any opinion, or had any chance of forming an opinion, on the question of
the scientific cultivation of the pearl-oyster? No, I have had no chance of forming an opinion on that
matter.
1024. By the Chairman : How many of those boats were engaged in the beche-de-mer industry at
Thursday Island ? In 1906 the returns gave the number at seventy-six.
1025. Were they owned by white men ? Some were owned by white men and some by aliens.
1026. It has been stated in evidence that the Japanese are in the habit of landing their aboriginal crews
at Townsville and paying them off there ? Ido not know about Townsville. They have been paid off at
Cooktown, and it may have been done in odd cases at Townsville, Of course, the articles provide that
they must discharge their aboriginal crews at the port of engagement, but permits have been issued at
Cooktown to recruit aboriginals at the Bloomfield Eiver, and to pay them off at Cooktowu when they land
them there.
1027. "Was your attention ever drawn to the fact that Japanese were in the habit of illegally landing
them? No.
1028. By Mr. Bennett : Was there not a clause in the articles providing that all aboriginal labourers
should be returned to their homes by the employers ? Yes —“ by or at the expense of the owner.”
1029. Was that not insisted upon ? Yes.
1030. At Thursday Island ? There were some exceptions. Although the clause was enforced afterwards,
in one or two instances the Protector of Aboriginals granted an employer permission to re-engage some
aboriginals for a further term.
1031. That was never done in my time? lam not aware that it was ever done by you, but it was done
by Mr. O’Brien.
1032. By the Chairman-. But it is contrary to the Act? No; the Aboriginals Protection Act does not
prohibit it. It provides that they must be returned to their homes at the conclusion of their agreement or
agreements.
1033. Are any New Guinea boats engaged in the b@che-de-raer industry ? I think not. If there are
any, there are very few. They say that New Guinea labourers who can swim make good beche-de-mer
men ; but I cannot remember any of the companies trying them.
1034. Do the Japanese treat the aboriginals well ? Yes.
1035. Do they feed them well ? 1 have heard very few complaints. The impression I formed was that
the Japanese believe that the better you feed them the harder you can work them.
1036. By Mr. Bennett-. You had nothing to do with the issuing of permits for recruiting ? No,


1037. By the Chairman : Tour opinion is that the pearling industry can be carried on solely by whites ?
That is my opinion.
1038. And your opinion is based on five years’ experience on Thursday Island ? Yes. i
1039. At Thursday Island a vessel up to 25 tons is permitted to go out without a certificated master ? s
Tes.
1040. You are aware that overtures were made to bring such boats under section 4 of the Port Dues
Revision Act ? I remember that.
1041. At present they are exempt from any charges—What is your opinion of that ? I think it would
be a hardship to bring pearling vessels under that section. I fancy the idea was to bring them under the
designation of trading vessels. I think that the section of the Act which is most applicable to them is
section 7. Fishing is certainly not trading.
1042. What depth of water would you be inclined to fix as a limit for white divers to work in, having
regard to the safety of the men—At present I understand the Japanese go down 27 fathoms ? Twenty-
seven fathoms is quite usual in working at Darnley Island, but I have heard of them going down to 40
fathoms.
1043. Would you consider it safe for a white man to work at that depth ? I have never tried it, but I
do not see why a strong, healthy, white man should not be able to go down as far as a Japanese diver.
1044. By Mr. Bennett-. Yes, but Japanese do not go down with safety at Darnley Island —What the
Chairman wants to get at is the limit of depth at which a man can work with safety ? I could not say.
Ido not think he can work with safety at a depth of over 30 fathoms. Over 30 fathoms would certainly
be dangerous.
1045. You have not had any experience in diving ? No.
1046. By the Chairman : Are you acquainted with the prices realised for beche'-de-raer at Thursday
Island ? Yes; but, of course, I have had to rely a great deal upon what I have gathered from auctioneers
and from the statements of those interested.
1047. What I wish to know is what is the price realised for teat fish—which is the most valuable
variety ? I know that in one instance See Kee paid £lBO a ton for teat fish at Thursday Island.
1048. By Mr. Bennett-. When was that? Not long before I left Thursday Island. Within the last
twelve months.
1049. By the Chairman : Is that the only instance of a sale which came under your notice ? That is
about the highest price I have known.
1050. What is the usual price ? I cannot say what is the usual price, but sand fish brings only a small
price. The price of the other fish varies according to quality and cure.
1051. By Mr. Bennett : Can you say from memory how many boats belonging to island natives are
engaged in bSche-de-mer fishing—l mean those boats which are not licensed ? There are twenty-two
now.
1052. With your knowledge of the conditions of the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries respectively,
do you think the two fisheries should be dealt with in the same Act of Parliament? No; I think it
would be better if there were a separate Act for each fishery, as the conditions of the two are altogether '
different.
1053. Is it within your experience that officials charged with administering the Act have met with
difficulties owing to the amalgamation of the two industries under the one Act ? I cannot remember any
case in which I had any difficulty as an inspector of fisheries.
1054. But, on the whole, you think the two fisheries could be better worked under separate Acts of
Parliament ? I think so.
1055. By the Chairman: Do you think that the boats owned by aboriginals, and used by them for the
purpose of collecting fish, should be exempted from the provisions to which other beche-de-mer boats are
subjected? I understand that the object in allowing aboriginals to use boats for that purpose was to
give them a chance to make a living for themselves ; but we found that, though they worked very well
until the boats were paid off, immediately after that was done they became lazy. I know that the
Department with which I am now connected will be likely to stick up for their being granted as many
concessions as can be given to them, but, speaking as a past inspector of fisheries, I think that, once their
boats are paid for, the aboriginals should pay a license fee the same as other fishers—that is, a license fee
for the man in charge. If any concession is allowed, it should be in the matter of signing the crew on
under agreement, which is impossible.
1056. By Mr. Bennett-. You mean that they should be exempted from any articles of agreement? Yes,
because with them there would be no such thing as employer and employee; they would work as a
company.
1057. Those boats which are working under the concession referred to are under the supervision of the
Protector of Aboriginals ? Yes, just in the same way as their produce is sold through him.
1058. With regard to the alien divers emploved in the industry, it is thought possible that the number
might be reduced by declining to issue any licenses to other than those at present licensed, and that
future licenses should be issued to white men only—What is your opinion of that proposition as a
possible means of bringing about the employment of white divers ? I think that if the issue of licenses
to aliens were restricted they would dive without being licensed.
1059. By the Chairman : Supposing the industry was controlled by an inspector, would it not be possible
to prevent unlicensed aliens engaging in diving ? It is very hard to catch a man diving. You may catch
a man in a diver’s dress, but, in order to secure a conviction, you would have to prove that he was
diving for shell.
1060. By Mr. Bennett-. We know the difficulties that exist under present conditions; but do you think
that such a provision as that suggested would have the effect of bringing about the employment of white
divers, other things being equal ? I think it would do something towards attaining that object, provided
there were white divers ready to take the places of the aliens.
1061. Do you think an increase in the diver’s fee would have any effect in restricting the employment of
alien divers ? No.
1062. You reckon they would pay anything we might ask ? Yes. The fee would make no difference to
them. As a rule, an alien is more willing to pay his £1 than a white man.
1063. By the Chairman : Was Mr. Saville Kent at Thursday Island before you left? He paid a visit to
the Island just before I left, and'was waiting for a reply to an application for a lease.

1064. By Mr. Bennett: Has there been any invention in connection with diving gear brought under
the notice of Thursday Island pearl-shellers during the last year or two? The last I remember was in
your time.
1065. You compiled the statistics of late years ? Yes.
1066. Did you make any attempt to obtain an estimate of the value of the pearls exported from Thursday
Island ? Not beyond what information could be obtained from the Customs.
1067. lam speaking of pearls exported ? They are shown in the exports.
1068. Did you try the Post Office at all for that information ? No; even the Post Office would pro-
bably not have the information, as you can send packets of pearls through as registered packets without
stating their value.
1069. Does illicit pearl-buying and pearl-selling exist at Thursday Island to the same extent as it did in
former years ? No ; but there is a certain amount of illicit pearl-buying done even yet. About a dozen
pearl-dealing licenses have been taken out, I think, but I could put my finger on one or two places not
licensed where pearls are bought.
1070. Have you any idea what further steps might be taken to put an end to illicit pearl-dealing ? I
have heard it suggested that wo should introduce legislation similar to the Diamond Trade Ordinance of
South .Africa, and I certainly agree with that suggestion.
1071. Have you seen the Ordinance itself? No.
1072. So you know nothing about its provisions ? No.
1073. The present fee for a licensed pearl dealer is £25? Yes.
1074. Do you think any benefit would result from increasing that fee to £5O ? No ; I think that would
have a tendency to increase illicit dealing in pearls by leading to an increase in the number of unlicensed
dealers. Most of the illicit pearl-dealing is done by visitors.
1075. Have the police in recent years secured any convictions for the offence of illicit pearl-dealing ?
No, because it is difficult to obtain evidence.
1076. Do the licensed dealers keep a record of all pearls passing through their hands ? That I could
not say.
1077. Would it not be a good thing to have the present Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer Fishery Acts
consolidated, so that you could work under one Act instead of under half a dozen Acts? I think so.
The whole of the Acts should be revised and consolidated. At the present time there are about five
different Acts dealing with those fisheries, and the first thing you have to do on receiving them is to
check them and cross out the repealed provisions.
1078. If such a consolidation were undertaken, I presume you would advocate a separate Act for the
beche-de-mer fishery ? Yes.
James Clare, Pearl Sheller, further examined :
1079. By Mr. Bennett : With regard to the diameter of exportable shell, I suppose you are aware that
the present diameter of nacre is 5 inches ? Yes.
, 1080. And formerly it was 6 inches ? Ves.
1081. Is it your opinion that the present diameter should be retained, or that the old diameter should be
reverted to? Decidedly I would retain the 5-inch limit. It is most unfortunate that you cannot tell
the diameter of a shell until you open it and kill the oyster. lam of opinion that if you reverted to the
6-ineh limit a great many shell between 5 and 6 inches in diameter would be lost. Five inches, in my
opinion, is quite large enough.
1082. Have you any knowledge of the difference in weight between a 5-inch and a 6-inch shell ? No.
It would vary to a great extent. I should say the difference between two ordinary shells would perhaps
be | lb. But you might get a 5-inch abnormal shell of stunted growth and unusual thickness that would
be quite as heavy as the ordinary 6-ineh shell.
1083. I am not speaking of stunted shell, or anything like that—l have seen plenty of the dwarf shell
—I am speaking of shell of ordinary growth—ls the relative difference in weight as much as 50 per cent. ?
Probably the difference in weight would not be so much as 50 per cent. ; probably it would be 25 per
cent. I think a growing shell just up to the 6-inch limit would weigh 1| lb., and a 5-inch shell would
weigh about 1 lb.
1084. Have you ever had any weighed ? Yes, but I forget the weights now.
1085. What is your principal reason for advocating the retention of the present 5-inch limit ? I think
you are not hurting the beds by taking the 5-inch shell. In Western Australia there is no restriction
whatever, although Ido not believe in picking up small shell—what we call “ spoons.” lam strongly
averse to that, let those beds have not suffered to the extent you would expect. Then at the Aroe
Islands I have seen the natives picking up small shell that did not weigh 2 oz. I say that is distinctly
wrong; but they have been doing it for the last 100 years, and there is plenty of young shell there still.
I think 5 inches is the happy medium.
1086. By Mr. Douglas : Do they get any pearls in these very small shells ? I could not say.
1087. By Mr. Bennett-. According to the report which I handed to you yesterday, the maximum weight
of shell taken was in 1897 —1,223 tons? Yes.
1088. In 1896 the take was 1,089 tons—Do you remember that it was in 1897 that the 5-inch limit came
into force ? If I remember rightly, the year wo got the record take of shell was the year we came under
the 5-inch limit, dnd probably that was the reason we got an excess quantity that year.
1089. Then, the record of 1897 may be assumed to have been due to the reduction of the limit from 6
inches to 5 inches ? Yes.
1090. Will you kindly refer to that report again [ document handed to Witness ] —You will observe that
since the year 1897 there has been, on the whole, a diminution, more or less steady, in the yield of
shell down to last year ? Yes.
1091. Do you not think that that diminution may be attributed, in part at any rate, to the reduction of
the limit from 6 inches to 5 inches—ls it not possible that such may be the case ? Ido not think so, I
think it is due to too many boats being engaged in the industry.
1092. At any rate, the diminution remains a fact, does it not? Yes. But there is always another
factor that you must take into account —that is the weather. At Thursday Island this year the weather
has been so bad that very little shell has been obtained. That has been the case with us at the Aroe
Islands, too, and it accounts for the falling off in our take of shell, probably to the extent of 100 tons.

1093. Do you consider that the closure of certain areas for the catchment of spat would assist in restoring
the productiveness of the industry ? Not at all. It might in a place like Endeavour Strait. The
bottom of that Strait is so eminently suited for the spawn to settle on that it might be desirable
to make the experiment there. At all events, it would be worth while giving it a trial. No one
is more alive to the importance of protecting and giving fish of all sorts a chance of increase than I
am, and I would like to see that experiment tried, although I do not hold out much hope of its success.
If you closed that bed for seven years I say that you would never have it nearly as prolific as it was
originally. My experience teaches me that you could not expect that.
1091. Is it your opinion that the deep-water area to the north-east of, and the grounds pertaining to,
Darnley Island contribute to the supply of spat in the western portions of Torres Strait—the Old
Ground P Undoubtedly.
1095. We know that the Darnley bed has been closed, but that it has nevertheless been worked ; but if
beds were closed, not nominally but actually—that is, if the closure were enforced—do you think it
would be a good thing for the pearl-shell beds in Torres Strait and to the westward ? Ido not think
it matters at all—the spat is so prolific, if you could only get it. I was told by a scientist in Sydney
that one oyster will throw off a million spat, and if an oyster will throw off that much, it is quite
reasonable to suppose that one pearl-shell will throw off equally as much spat.
1096. I think Saville Kent states somewhere that the spat of a pearl-shell runs into more than a
million ? Ido not know. I take great interest in all fish and oyster cultivation, including pearl-shell
for that matter, and the scientist I refer to kindly showed me how he arrived at his estimate of a million
spat in an oyster. He extracted the spat from an oyster, put it in a measured glass, stirred it up, and
then put one drop of that on a slide, which he put underneath a microscope. That drop was magnified
a thousand times ; then he counted the number of spat in that one drop, multiplied the number of drops
in the glass by the number of spat in the one drop, and the result was the total.
1097. Then, on the whole, the closure of spat areas is an experiment that you do not approve of? I do
not think it necessary to close areas for that purpose. There is so much spat drifting about in the water
that there is sufficient to stock all the beds, if there is anything for it to lodge on. In all the passages
and places adjacent to reefs there are thousands of square miles suitable for catching spat, and you would
wonder why the spat is not there. The reason is that all shell life has so many enemies, which find a
living and safety in the vicinity of those reefs, that they gobble up all the young fish of the pearl-shell
before it has a chance to grow. In connection with that experiment of ours at Thursday Island, I may
mention that we used to send a diver down from time to time to see how the shell was getting on, and,
greatly to our surprise, we found that a lot of it was “ chawed up,” broken up—that some fish had come
along and eaten it. We laid down 120,000 shell. No experiment could have been carried on under more
favourable conditions, and it actually resulted in a loss, as we took up only 33,000 shell. I took that up
myself.
1098. By the Chairman: But the ground was not protected ? It was protected. It was leased to us,
and we had our own ship to watch it.
1099. It has been stated that Japanese took some of the shell ? So they did; but the Japanese could
not pick up the difference between 35,000 and 120,000 shell. A diver could not pick up that quantity.
1100. By Mr. Bennett: Why P Because of the dirtiness of the water. I used a dredge, and all we
got was one shell.
1101. By the Chairman; Did the shell give any indication of coming to maturity ? Yes ; the shell gave
a good result. That is where we saw the quick growth of the shell from 5 inches to 6 inches. I think
eighteen months turned a 5-inch shell into a 6-inch shell. The reason for my objection to cultivation is
that you cannot protect the young fish. We cannot protect our edible oysters down here from
stingarees and other enemies coming along and eating them up.
1102. You introduced a biologist—Mr. Pace? Yes.
1103. Did you derive any practical benefit from his exertions ? None at all, except that he showed us
from time to time that he found immense quantities of spat floating through the Passage. We used to
hang over a cheese-cloth net, and we found that it was not there five minutes before it collected a
considerable quantity of spat. On taking it up, and washing it inside with water, with the aid of a
microscope we could see that it was teeming with animal life. But Mr. Pace could not determine, and
no biologist has yet determined, the difference between what we call lingah or bastard shell and the true
pearl-shell spat. The bastard shell is much more plentiful than the true pearl-shell.
1104. Perhaps they are similar in the embryo stage ? Yes.
1105. As one who has had long experience in the industry, do you think that it would be possible,
with the assistance of a biologist, to conserve the spat? No. I have received a letter from a friend of
mine who has made an experiment in the cultivation of spat in Western Australia. The experiment was
continued for four years, and, without making any allowance on account of his own time, the- experiment
cost him £5,000. Here is the result; —In 1901 my friend went to a certain place “ and tried M.O.P.
Cultivation, as this group was specially suitable with its sheltered lagoons, where very large shells may
be found at low water. Converted a lagoon of -1 acre, which dried at half tide, into a pond, by a
masonry dam with gates opened by a winch ; when full it contained 7 feet of water with a loss of from
2 feet to 4 feet. Have had 200 to 300 old M.O.P. shells for eleven months thriving in a marked manner,
and never lost one. A great many young ones appeared in the pond or were collected in the crevices
of the stone walls. These young ones thrived perfectly, and, every person was sure that they were real
M.O.P. shell, but they failed, up to the time I left, to grow beyond the size of the stunted of reef shell,
and eventually I condemned them all as false. Cost of experiments for four years £5,000, excluding the
time of Mr. Hayne. Eesults practically nil.”
1106. By Mr. Douglas : What is his name ? Mr. Hayne.
1107. By the Chairman : I think you know that other industries have been developed and made more
productive by calling in the aid of science? Yes, and nobody attaches more importance to that kind of
thing than I do.
1108. Surely then the pearl-shell industry is capable of development by similar means ? If you can put
the young shell into a cage, and keep their enemies from them, you may keep them alive. The pearl-shell
is a totally different thing from fish. You will admit that Ido more than anyone else in Australia in
the matter of edible oyster cultivation. I believe in that. See what great results cultivation has given
us in that industry!

1109. But is there any analogy between the edible oyster and the pearl-oyster ? None at all. If you go
"'s along the coast as far north as Gladstone you will see reefs where the edible oyster has settled for
>B. generations; but if you go up to Thursday Island, or anywhere in that vicinity, and put a bag of oysters
overboard and go and look for them again in a few days’ time, you will find that they have been carried
away. Look at the depredations of the octopus, the turtle, and other enemies of the pearl-shell oyster
in those waters ! The young pearl-shell has enemies of that kind, and you cannot protect it from them.
It is nothing to me if you make the experiment suggested. By all means try it.
1110. The edible oyster has been cultivated for a number of years—probably hundreds of years, but the
pearl-shell has only been under the supervision of intelligent persons for a very short time ? ( Witness )
What do those people we have had out here know about the pearl-shell ? They never saw a pearl-shell
oyster at all until they came out here. Do we want the pearl-shell cultivated ? We cannot sell all the
shell we can raise now. 1 will sell you to-day 300 tons of shell that lam holding. Where is the need,
then, for cultivation ?
1111. By Mr. Douglas : Would not the cultivation of the pearl-shell oyster make the cost of production
of the pearl-shell cheaper than it is now? No. Before I cultivated edible oysters we got Gs. a bag, and
now we get £2 10s. We could not have been on a better wicket for the cultivation of the pearl-oyster
than we were in Friday Island Passage, where we put down 120,000 shell.
1112. If pearl-shell could be raised and exported at a cost of, say, £5O a ton, would there not be a much
larger demand for it ? I will make you an offer. I will give any man who produces the first ten tons of
shell from spat by cultivation £l,OOO.
1113. By the Chairman : Then that experiment of yours was a failure ? Not altogether. It demonstrated
two things—the growth of shell from 5 inches to 6 inches, and that pearl-shell could be made to produce
pearls; and that is probably what Mr. Saville Kent is trying to do at Albany Passage, for he knows very
well that he cannot cultivate the shell.
1114. By Mr. Douglas: Was the primary object of your experiment to produce pearls ? No; the object
was to bring the shell into a sheltered place where we could raise it again with every prospect of profit.
.’Our men picked up the shell at a cost of 10s. per 100, and we brought it in at the expense, probably, of
another 10s. per 100, which made £1 per 100. We expected that, after the lapse of a couple of years, we
would be able to pick up all those shell or the majority of them, but we did not do it.
1115. By Mr. Bennett: Then the experiment coat you, roughly, about £6OO ? The experiment cost us
£4,000, and we did not realise that much from the shell we afterwards picked up. I have the books at
home, and cau give you the actual results. It was a great disappointment to us that we could not make
the experiment pay.
1116. The Western Australian experiment was conducted in a lagoon? Tes.
1117. Might not the absence of any current militate against the success of the experiment? There was
a current there. The place where the experiment was tried grew the best shell in Western Australia,
and, in my opinion, a more suitable place could not have been found.
1118. How was a current provided for—l understood that there were some sort of lock gates? No;
there was just a kind of flume, and the water came through. I think the gate was merely to keep out
enemies. It was a most successful experiment, because not one shell died, and the other shells thrived
splendidly ; and, when they came, they were of opinion that this was the young of the big shell.
1119. Then we may take it that your opinions of cultivation are not favourable ? No. I may say that
I would like to see the experiment carried out.
1120. By Mr. Douglas: Do you not think it would be more desirable for the Government to carry out
cultivation experiments than for private individuals ? Ido not see that the Government would get any
better results. The man who made the experiment in Western Australia was an old shelter, who
evidently had his heart in the work.
1121. But, take your own case—lt is possible that, had your experiment in Friday Island Passage proved
successful, and the shell had developed and thrown off sufficient spat, the spat might have been carried
into general grounds, and your experiments in that way would have benefited a large number of people
besides yourselves ? There is plenty of spat without that. I think that the fact of our bringing in
120,000 shell there might have had the effect of restocking all those little passages round about Thursday
Island to a greater extent than they would have been restocked if we had not brought the shell in.
1122. When the shell is, say, half an inch or an inch long, does it remove itself from one place to another ?
Ido not think so. I think the shell attaches itself to something by the byssus.
1123. At what size ? Eight from the beginning.
1124. By Mr. Bennett: It discards the byssus attachment at a certain stage, does it not ? Tes, when its
weight allows it to do without it.
1125. By Mr. Douglas; In view of the fact that the Government have obtained a large revenue from the
fishery at Thursday Island, both directly and indirectly, would it not be more reasonable that they should
spend a little money in developing, by scientific means, the cultivation of the shell for the people who
come there in the future ? Ido not think it is necessary to cultivate at all. The world cannot use all
the shell we can produce now without cultivation, and I am quite satisfied we cannot cultivate it.
1126. But is it not more on account of the high price that the world does not use all that is now
produced ? No ; the price of shell was never so low.
1127. Never so low as it now is ? None of your people are making a living out of it. It is all working
from hand to mouth. We are not getting a profitable price.
1128. Is that not chiefly because it is more costly to get the shell now than it used to be ? No. We are
paying from £2O to £25 a ton. What less wage could you pay to any man to pick up shell ?
1129. But the catches now are not so great as they used to be? You could not afford to pay more with
a price like £l3O a ton, and you are not sure of getting that.
1130. By the Chairman : In the absence of development, is there not a danger of the industry becoming
extinct? No.
1131. I think it became extinct at Panama ? Tes. The edible oyster became extinct down in Spencer
Gulf, in South Australia, owing to indiscriminate fishing; and the oyster-beds in Moreton Bay were also
threatened with extinction from the same cause, and it was only when the leasing system was adopted
that we got back a stock of oysters. Ido not suppose Spencer Gulf will ever be restocked again,

1132. But you have admitted there is no analogy between the edible oyster and the pearl oyster? Yes;
but the Old Ground up at Torres Strait and the Eighty-mile Beach in Western Australia are so immense
that you cannot work them out.
1133. By Mr. Douglas-. Have you any knowledge of the fishery at Mergui, in British Burmah? Only
from hearsay.
1134. Do you recollect that some ten years ago the beds were reported to have been denuded ? No. The
difficulty there was that the water was so deep that all the divers were killed. I think it was worse than
the Darnley ground for that.
1135. By Mr. Bennett : Were they pump diving? Yes. They are working that place still.
1136. By the Chairman : But you are aware that the black-lip shell of Eastern Polynesia is becoming
altogether worked out ? Ido not think that is so at Tahiti.
1137. I speak of Tahiti and the Paumotu Group ? The difficulty is that fashion has gone off the black-
lip shell, and you cannot sell it, whereas eleven years ago it was bringing £6O or £7O more than the white-
lip. It was then bringing £220 a ton. You cannot sell Tahiti shell now—or very little of it—because
the fashion has changed.
1138. By Mr. Bennett-. That was Tahiti shell—not what we call the black-lip shell in Torres Strait?
It is a much larger sort.
1139. I remember the time when black-lip shell went up, but I never remember it commanding a greater
price than the silver-lip shell of Torres Strait? No; I think the finest Torres Strait black-lip shell
fetched about £lOO per ton.
1140. By the Chairman: In the early seventies, on the Tahiti black-lip, £7O to £BO a ton was advanced
on bills of lading in Sydney ? When I was in London eleven years ago, Tahiti shelLwas bringing £220
a ton; and it made an impression on my mind, because I was wishing wo could get that price for ours.
1141. Do you think it is possible to work the industry with people of our own race ? No.
1142. We have been told of boats with six or seven Japanese, and probably three or four, and in some
cases the whole of them, relieving one another as divers—ls it not possible for white men to carry on the
industry with the same degree of success? Those Japanese divers are liable to be killed any day; and
you would not find white men to take the risks that the Japanese do.
1143. Do not white men take greater risks than that ? No. I remember about 1890 when we had
splendid Norfolk Island men. A lot of them got killed out there.
1144. Evidence has been given that at one time there were thirty-four white divers in Torres Strait ?
That is quite so.
1145. If they were able to carry on the industry then, would it not be possible for white men to do the
same now? Shell was more plentiful then.
1146. Then white men merely want an incentive ? Ido not know.
1147. You know better than I can tell you that the white man goes to look for gold in New Guinea,
and leads a very precarious life, carrying his life in his hand ? That is always so with regard to miners
—they will go anywhere. The greater the distance, the more determined they are to go.
1148. By Mr. Douglas: The allurement of obtaining a pearl worth £l,OOO should be an inducement to
white men? There is very little prospect of finding a pearl worth £L,OOO on the Old Ground. With
all our boats we have never done so. Where you have three divers in a boat they may get 10 tons of
shell, and that is a very high estimate for a year’s work. They get £BO a ton. That is £BOO, out of
which they have to pay all the expenses of the boat, and, I suppose, those expenses come to £lOO.
1149. By the Chairman : Supposing five young white men with a little experience in the industry buy a
boat and equipment, and participate equally, they are not going to slave early and late? By all means
give them a trial.
1150. I should like to have an opinion from you on the subject ? I* have seen strong advocates of
white labour, but I have never seen them make the experiment themselves.
1151. By Mr. Douglas : In the 10 tons of shell of which you speak, would they not expect to get some
pearls ? That is the only reason they work in those waters. But for the hope of getting pearls they
would not risk their lives. They hope to supplement their earnings in that way. Taking their total
earnings at £BOO, and their expenses at £4OO, 'there is only £4OO left to be divided among three men,
and I should be very sorry to see white men going into deep water for the sake of making that amount of
money, because there is only one end possible—they will lose their lives. Look at the long list of deaths
that have occurred there.
1152. By the Chairman : The Anglo-Saxon has proved his capacity to overcome any difficulties that other
races can overcome; and it must be remembered that this industry has only been prosecuted by white
men for the last thirty or forty years—before that it was confined to the coloured races throughout the
Pacific—men who just wanted to supply their own wants ? But the coloured races always work for less
than white men. You have them competing against you. If we had this industry to ourselves, and
could get £2OO or £3OO a ton for the shell, then you might employ white people and make it pay.
White people can get shell just the same as Japanese, but they will not get as much. I have tried the
white man, and I am always prepared to employ a white man, even if he does not get as much, so long as
he can show me a margin of profit.
1153. The pearl-shell industry being recognised as a substantial source of national wealth, is it not worth
conserving for the white race ? No; it is worth only £60,000 a year. You get 500 tons of shell at
£l2O a ton. Why, you have one station in Queensland getting more from its wool than all this fishery.
1154. Yery likely ; but very few people are blessed with the good luck to get a station ? It can be
easilv done.
1155'. By Mr. Douglas : Would it not be better to have 100 white divers thero instead of 250 coloured
divers, and to have the work distributed among the whites instead of among the coloured people ? That is
what we are trying to do. employ more whites in the way we work with our schooners, \Ye employ
thirty whites. Are there thirty whites employed at Thursday Island? No; there are only about
half a dozen. . ,
1156. By the Chairman : But no white divers ? It does not matter whether a man is a diver or not.
Our method of working with schooners employs more white people, and the wealth produced is dis-
tributed among white people. The way you work now, the wealth is distributed among the Japanese.
1157. Exactly, and that is what we want to stop ? If there are any pearls obtained, they get them.

1158. We want to stop the Japanese despoiling the whole industry, and conserve it for white men ? My
, company have always worked for the white man.
I. 1159. My remarks are not meant in any way as a personal reflection on you—l know you have assisted
many white men; but our object is to find out in what way we can best conserve the industry for the
white race ? There is one way to do it, and one way only—that is, for one company to control all the
output of pearl-shell.
1160. One company ? Yes, one company or a body of men to control all the pearl-shell, and, instead of
selling it as we do now for £l2O a ton, get £2OO a ton for it.
1161. But would not that create a monopoly in the industry ? What odds? Would it not be better to
get £2OO a ton than sell.it for £l2O ? We could employ more white men then.
1162. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you mean to control the whole world’s output, and not the output of
Thursday Island alone? No ; you must control the world’s output.
1163. By the Chairman -. Would that not be a big undertaking? Not at all. The world’s output of
shell is only 2,400 tons per annum.
1164. By Mr. Bennett: No more than that? No. That means £268,000f0r the world’s produce—only
a little over £250,000 sterling.
1165. By the Chairman: Is that the value of the world’s product ? That is all. I suppose they get as
much and more from the Scotch fisheries in a month.
1163. Then that is the only way to dispense with aliens and Japanese in the pearl-shell industry? Yes.
We must pay a white man more money, and you cannot do that while shell is £l2O a ton. There is no
chance of doing it at that figure. The Philippine Islands are coming into the market as producers.
1167. How do you suggest that the Government will get any benefit ? Take my offer of £5,000 a year
for what you are only getting £450 now.
1168. By Mr,. Douglas : Will you guarantee to keep the Customs revenue up to £15,000 a year ? I will
guarantee to keep the Customs revenue up to what it is at present.
1169. By the Chairman: Without coloured labour ? You cannot carry on without coloured labour.
1170. Do you think it impossible to prosecute the industry without coloured labour ? Profitably, yes.
1171. If you succeed in getting the monopoly you mention,, would you dispense with coloured labour?
No; but if you get a higher price for your shell you might give white men a chance. And to give them
every opportunity, if I could get a coloured diver at £25 or £3O a ton, I would give a white diver £35
or £4O a ton, provided he could get as much shell as a Japanese could. By that means you might create
a lot of white divers. If any company had the control of the whole of the fishery they could put the
price up £4O or £5O a ton, and then they could increase the “lay” to the divers.
1172. My impression was that, if your offer of £5,000 a year was accepted, that would mean the abolition
of the alien altogether from the industry ? You could not carry on without them.
1173. There is no special work that white men could not become inured to ? That is right enough ; but
can you keep white men in a boat which earns only £5OO a year ?
1174. No ; the object would be to encourage white men to work as Japanese are working now ? You
could not get white men to work in a boat where the take would be only £5OO a year.
1175. Then, in your opinion it is impossible to carry on the industry with only white labour ? Yes.
1176. By Mr. Bennett-. "\Yith regard to the leasing of vessels to aliens, the companies you are concerned
in have not adopted that practice, have they ? No.
1177. I presume that you are aware that vessels are leased to coloured aliens by white owners ? Yes.
1178. lam speaking of the pearling industry ? Well, they are practically leased.
1179. By Mr. Douglas-. At a rental? Not exactly at a rental; but in my opinion the present method
of working the industry is an evasion of the Act.
1180. By Mr. Bennett: I am speaking more particularly of the past, before the present system of
engaging divers to get shell at £BO or £B5 a ton came into operation—Are you or are you not aware
that vessels used to be leased to coloured aliens ? Yes, lam aware of that.
1181. Is that a desirable practice, having in view the conservation of the pearl-shell industry ? Decidedly
not.
1182. Can you suggest any means by which that practice can be brought to an end ? I would make
every owner of a boat responsible for his men’s wages, the same as we are. At present the respon-
sibility of making a profit is thrown on the man taking the boat at £BO a ton, and that man has no
interest in the permanence of the fishery. ' It is people like ourselves who want the fishery preserved.
We have £lOO,OOO invested in the industry.
1183. By the Chairman -. You refer to the white man who owns the boat ? Yes.
1184. By Mr. Bennett -. Have you any idea as to whether a system of registration of vessels, apart from
the system provided in the Merchant Shipping Act, would assist in that direction —that is, a system
under which the pearling boats, and, of course, the beche-de-mer boats, would be registered in such a way
that their registration would be an absolute certificate of ownership, which, as you are aware, the present
certificate of registration is not —You know yourself that the present certificate of registration is not a
certificate of title ? Yes ; it is no certificate of title.
1185. That is stated on the certificate itself ? Yes. It is very difficult to devise any scheme which will
prevent the leasing of boats to aliens.
1186. Do you think that if such a system could be elaborated and enforced, it would be beneficial ? I
think it would. I would ask you this question —What interest have the Japanese, who take and work
those boats at £BO or £B5 a ton in the permanence of the fishery ? When there are three or four divers
in one boat, that shows that their great object is to get every shell they can possibly find, and that is not
a system to bo encouraged.
1187. By Mr. Douglas: But is it not the object of everyone working in the industry to get as much
shell as they can in the shortest possible time ? No. I have been in this business since 1881, and we
have always made it pay. Wo have £lOO,OOO invested in plant, and it is to our interest to make the
industry pay all the time. Unless we can make it pay, that £lOO,OOO is money wasted or thrown
away. We have a greater interest in the permanency of the fishery than the Japanese who are working
there now. Yesterday you stated that the schooners were not beneficial to the industry, because they
were marks which enabled divers to go over the same ground and pick up the shell. Pour divers in one
boat working continuously are a greater danger to the fishery than one boat working from a schooner.

1188. I do not think I said schooners were detrimental to the industry—My recollection is that I wished
to get your opinion on the subject ? I started fishing in 1881, and lamat it yet.
1189. If you could get out of it, would you do so ? I would ; it is a precarious business, and when I tell
you that we carry a liability of £250 a day, whether we get anything out of it or not, you will understand
that anyone would be glad to get out of it. I could get out of it if I wished, but I want to get out of it
on favourable terms.
1190. There is a good deal of worry attached to it ? A great amount of worry. I make as much money
out of a little sheep station I have, with no risk, as I do out of the pearl-shell industry, in which we
employ 1,000 or 1,200 men.
1191. If an alien was not allowed to own or work a vessel on his own account, and if a way was opened
by which Europeans could pick up a knowledge of diving, and they understood that they might get a
pearl or a fairly large haul of shell, it would be to their interest to buy a vessel of their own—" Would it
not then be to your advantage to sell out to them one boat at a time—Would you not then be able to sell
out on more favourable terms than if you sold the whole of your fleet at once ? lam not against the
employment of white men. I am always in favour of the employment of men of my own colour, and
would assist them, but the return got from the business is not sufficient to justify them living such a life
as that of divers on pearling boats, and taking the risks they must take. I would like to see all the
divers white men if possible, but it is not possible. "White men will not live the life they would have to
live in following the industry, and I do not blame them.
1192. Do you not think that the life of a fisherman in the old country, in the North Sea particularly, is
much more arduous than the life of a pearl-shell fisher in Torres Strait ? I cannot say that, as I have
had no experience of that fishery. Every man will not risk his life in a diving-dress.
1193. A proposal has been made to the effect that facilities should be offered for training white men as
divers for the fishery in Torres Strait—Do you think that would be a good thing? There is no
inducement for any white man to go in for a business of that sort when you can give him only £lO to
£l5 a month. It is better for him to learn engineering, or something of that sort.
1191. But if a man had the prospect of a good catch of shell or of pearls ? Ton can do it in Western
Australia, but not in Torres Strait. A man cannot afford to spend a spell of bad weather on Thursday
Island, as his expenses will be going on all the time. He would require some capital to tide him over his
difficulties.
1195. The expenses of a man employing one boat would not be very great—He would have repairs to do
which would employ him during that time ? His expenses would be £4OO a year for the upkeep of the
boat; and even if ha dived himself, there would not be a sufficient margin of profit. We have had white
men in the Strait before, and they have drifted out of the industry. Surely that is sufficient evidence that
they cannot make it pay.
1196. In the early days the conditions of living in Torres Strait were not so favourable as they are- now ?
I think you could live cheaper then.
1197. But you did not get the same class of food—There was no fresh milk or butter, and no fresh beef?
You do not get that out in boats.
1198. But the men go to Thursday Island ? There is no shell at Thursday Island.
1199. There used to be shell obtained within easy reach of Thursday Island in the early days ? The
men would not go into Thursday Island now, unless bad weather was on. In any case, the earnings of a
diver would not enable him to buy beef at 9d. or lOcl. a lb. Although living at Thursday Island is much
better now than when I went up there, twenty-seven years ago, still it must be remembered that we
are better off in regard to preserves and tinned provisions than we were then. I would just like to say
again that I am not against white divers being employed. I would like to see dozens of them
employed, if they were successful and could make the work pay, but my experience teaches me that they
cannot make it pay.
1200. By the Chairman : You mean under existing conditions ? Yes; or under any conditions, when
you have to compete against places like Burmah, the Malay Archipelago, and the Philippines. If you
could devise a scheme by which you would get £250 a ton for your shell, then the earnings of a boat
would justify the employment of white people.
1201. By Mr. Douglas : Or if you could get a larger catch distributed over a lesser number of boats ?
No; because, as I explained before, there is more shell raised now than we can sell.
1202. But if you had 100 white divers working 100 boats, and getting the same quantity of shell as
Japanese working 200 boats, or a larger quantity of shell, there could ho more money paid for labour ?
Another thing you must consider is whether this fishery belongs to you. The judges have held that you
have no proprietary rights beyond the 3-mile limit. There is nothing to prevent foreign vessels working
on the Old Ground. If we choose to bring our boats from the Aroe Islands to work on the Old Ground,
what is there to prevent us ?
1203. By the Chairman : Is there not a line of demarcation defining the jurisdiction outside the 3-mile
limit? That only applies to British vessels. The Extra-Territorial Act says that the Act applies to
British vessels. Therefore wo could anchor our vessels near Dutch New Guinea, and in thirty-six hours
we could be on the Old Ground, and we could work there.
1204. By Mr. Douglas : But it would not be an easy thing to work on the Old Ground under those
conditions ? "Why not ? There would be no difficulty.
1205. By the Chairman : But if you came into a Queensland port ? You would he bound to give us wood
and water. Ido not think the boundary is 100 miles from Deliverance.
1206. By Mr. Douglas : But with a heavy sea would it not be rather a difficult matter for a fleet of
Vessels to beat down and get out again ? On the Old Ground we used to beat up from Deliverance and
away beyond Deliverance in the teeth of a breeze. It would be much easier to run away with a fair wind
when we were blown off the ground than to beat up to Badu to get shelter.
1207. Of course if the Government wished to prevent foreign vessels seeking refuge, or coming within
the 3-mile limit with diving gear aboard, it might be done, the same as it was with you at the Aroe Islands ?
We worked outside the 3-mile limit before we got the concession.
1208. But you found it was rather a difficult matter? We worked there for two or three years. We
would rather work inside, of course ; but we worked, and with a profit.
1209. By Mr. Bennett : What would you take to bo the ordinary life of a diver ? Provided he works
in water up to 15 fathoms, I do not think the work is prejudicial to life.

1210. I think it is generally accepted as a fact that a marine diver’s working life is not so lengthy as the
N lives of men working under more favourable conditions—Can you give us any idea of the ordinary work-
!. ing life of a pearl-shell diver —I am not speaking of the ordinary marine diver who goes down perhaps
once in three months, but a man who works at it day after day, year in and year out? I have one man
working for me now who was working for me twenty-two years ago. I may have more.
1211. By the Chairman : What countryman is he ? He is a Manila man. He was working for me in
Western Australia in 1886.
1212. By Mr. Bennett-. There are exceptions to every rule, and doubtless your Manila man is an excep-
tion, the same as “ Cranky ” Francis at Darnley Island, who has been working for over twenty years
to my knowledge ; but do you think the average working life of a diver exceeds ten years ? I think it
does. We have not lost many divers.
1213. I am not speaking of loss of life from accidents, but merely of the time men usually remain
effective divers ? I could not give you any idea, but I think a diver might be effective for at least ten years.
1214. By the Chairman: After tw'enty-two years, does your Manila man look physically fit ? It is a
strange thing in connection with deep diving that the big, strong men nearly always die, and the poor,
weakly chaps, like “ Cranky” Francis, survive. I think the reason is that the big-bodied man is full of
blood—he has far more blood in his body than the thin chap—and his heart gets overtaxed in pumping
blood through bis body while he is subject to such a great pressure.
1215. It is proved in other walks of life that the moderate-sized man generally comes out on top ? I
have seen men who could barely carry the diving dress go down into deep water where the big, strong
man got knocked over.
1216. By Mr. Douglas: You have been a licensed pearl-dealer for a number of years? Yes; but not
for some time now.
1217. Still you have an extensive knowledge of the method of buying and selling pearls at Thursday
Island ? Yes.
1218.. Would you suggest that some enactment should be brought in on somewhat similar lines to the
Diamond Trade Ordinance of South Africa ? Not at all. As the fishery is carried on at Thursday
Island, the pearls go to the diver, so what is the use of such a law ?
1219. But if the industry were worked on a system by which the diver is supposed to deliver all pearls
he gets to the owner or master of the vessel, would such a law assist those engaged in the industry ? I
think it would assist them if only certain people were allowed to buy pearls. I have bought my own
pearls. My men in Western Australia would steal the pearls from me, and would sell them to the
steward of a steamer passing along; and I would buy the pearls from that steward, who would tell me
from whom he had bought them. Then I have shown my diver the pearls he had sold to the steward, and
I have seen his look of astonishment.
1220. By Mr. Bennett : He would not go to that steward again, I expect ? Ido not know. It is very
hard to get a conviction. The difficulty is in proving ownership. Ido not know the provisions of the
Diamond Trade Ordinance, but anything that would add to the profits of the owner would be a very
good thing.
1221. By Mr. Douglas: Would you suggest that there should be a limit to the number of boats employed
in the fishery in Torres Strait ? I think there should be a limit.
1222. How many boats would you suggest the industry could carry ? I think it could safely carry 200
boats. I have a return here showing that in 1892 there were 190 boats ; in 1893 there were 210
boats ; in 1894 there were 203 ; in 1895 there were 204 ; in 1896 there were 207 ; so that in those five
years the number ranged from 190 to 207.
1223. Those boats would be licensed to work for pearl-shell or beche-de-mer ? I take it they would be
pearl-shell boats, but lam not quite sure —it says, “ Total number of diving and swimming boats.” But
there were not many swimming boats. In 1898 there were 307 boats ; the next year 319, then 341,
then 331 —altogether too many. Up to 1896 we were fairly prosperous in the Strait.
1224. The companies in which you are interested have had a large number of boats built from time to
time? Yes.
1225. You have increased the fleet considerably ? We have not increased our fleet since 1905; but when
the Morgan Government began to issue more licenses we thought we might as well have some more as
well as the rest of the people.
1226. Where were those additional boats built ? Principally in Sydney, and some in Brisbane.
1227. Have you had any boats built in Torres Strait ? Yes. I dare say we have had eight or ten built there.
1228. By whom were they built? By Japanese.
1229. In all cases ? There are no other boatbuilders there.
1230. Do the Japanese build boats equal to those you had built in Sydney or Brisbane ? No. We
reckon the Sydney-built boats are better than Japanese-built boats.
1231. Is there any material difference in the cost between a boat built at Thursday Island and a boat
built in Sydney ? No. We pay £lOO more for a white-built boat than for a Japanese-built boat—
perhaps £l5O, including the cost of getting it up to Thursday Island.
1232. Do you consider you get better value in the case of boats built by white men ? I do, or we would
not spend our money on them. Even since we have been at the Aroe Islands we have had boats built in
Sydney.
1233. By Mr. Bennett: For working at the Aroe Islands ? Yes.
1234. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think it is desirable to have those boats built at Thursday Island by
Japanese labour ? I think we should have white carpenters there.
1235. Do you think white carpenters could do the -work equally well up there? Of course, they could.
Unfortunately, we have not had the best kind of white boat-builders there. Ido not know whether it is
on account of the climate, but they generally take to drink and you cannot rely upon them. I think
white men are better boat-builders. You get better work, better material, and a better shape also from
white builders than you get from Japanese.
1236. By Mr. Bennett: Is it not a fact that the alien races, such as the Japanese and South Sea
Islanders, drink to excess at Thursday Island, just as much as white men, when they get the chance?
Yes; but you get your work done by the Japanese. Unfortunately, the law is a dead letter at Thursday
Island with regard to the supply of drink to aboriginals and South Sea Islanders, and there is no doubt
that they and other coloured races, such as the Japanese, drink to excess.

Malcolm Smith, Acting Sergeant of Water Police, examined ;
1237. By the Chairman : What ara you? Acting Sjrgeaut attached to the Water Police of Bmba le at
present.
1238. I understand you were some years at Thursday Island in a similar capacity ? Yes ; I was at
Thursday Island from March, 1886, until August, 1906 —over twenty years.
1239. I suppose during that time you had opportunities for becoming familiar with the pearling industry ?
Yes, I know it fairly well.
1210. Did your duties take you out to the scene of operations at all ? Yes, very often. The last couple
of years I was there, I was appointed Inspector of Fisheries, and, in consequence, I had to mix with the
pearlers to a considerable degree.
1241. Were there any white divers at work during the time you were there ? Yes, a great many. I can
count between forty and fifty white divers who were there during my time. Included in that number
were four or five Norfolk Islanders.
1242. Were those men employed on their own account or by some of the companies ? They were mostly
in their own boats
1243. How many men would there be in one of the boats ? As a rule, six and a diver, or sometimes there
were five and a diver.
1244. How many of them would be white men ? One white diver. I have known four or five white men
in some of the boats.
1245. They would be men working for themselves? Yes, the divers were working for themselves.
1246. Do you think a diver’s life is a hard one? Yes. It is harder now than it used to be on account
of the greater depth at which they get the shell.
1247. Do you think there is any walk of life as precarious as that of a diver? I consider that diving in
anything up to 15 fathoms of water is like any other calling. The danger is considerable when the diver
is under the water.
1248. Do you think the industry could be successfully carried on solely by white labour, giving time
for teaching young men of good physique to become divers? It is quite possible, but not as the industry
is carried on at the present time.
1249. You know the hardships that the fishermen on the coast of Scotland have to endure, winter and
summer ? Yes.
1250. Do you think diving is a harder life than that ? No.
1251. By Mr. Bennett: The diver’s life is easier than that of the North Sea fisherman ? Yes.
1252. By the Chairman : You think it is a harder life than diving in Torres Strait? I do, up to a
certain depth. But, leaving the depth out of the question, I consider fishing in the North Sea is much
harder than diving in Torres Strait.
1253. You take into consideration the cold climate, exposure to the weather, and precarious food supplies?
Yes.
1254. How is the food of those engaged in the pearl-shell industry in Torres Strait regulated—Do they
get their three meals a day ? They only take two meals a day —breakfast and tea. They do not take a
mealin the middle of the day—a heavy meal especially.
1255. But, being their own masters, they could have three meals a day if they chose ? Undoubtedly, but
it would not suit them.
1256. By Mr. Bennett : A diver must not eat too much when he is diving ? No; that is the reason they
only take two meals a day.
1257. By the Chairman : What suggestions wmuld you offer to make the life of a diver more attractive to
men of our own race? First of all, the beds are pretty well denuded now, and there is not sufficient
inducement for a white man. If the beds were allowed to recuperate up to what they were twenty years
ago, there would be an inducement for white men to take up the work.
1258. Is it your impression that the beds have been denuded ? Undoubtedly they have.
1259. By Mr. Bennett ; What you suggest is that the beds should be allowed to return to their old con-
dition, when men went out to pick up shell, whereas now they go out to look for it and pick it up if they
can find any ? Yes.
1260 By the Chairman: You know several islets throughout the Strait where permanent homes could
be formed ? Yes.
1261. Do you think it would be possible for five or six steady young white men to have a boat of their
own, become divers, and make it pay —If they owned a boat and equipment, two or three of them
could become divers, and the others could gradually familiarise themselves with the work of diving, and
then they could relieve each other? There is nothing to stop them from making it a paying concern.
1262. By Mr. Bennett: Always provided that the shell is there ? I say that from the first the beds
should be allowed to recuperate. Now they have to look for shell, while twenty years ago they had just
to drop down and pick it up.
1263. By the Chairman : You think that young men of good physique—not worn-out old sailors—could
carry on the industry successfully ? Yes.
1264. During your stay at Thursday Island were there many young men growing up ? As soon as they
grow up they leave. There is nothing for them to do.
1265. If the pearl-shell fishery offered the attraction we have referred to, would it be an inducement for
them to stay ? Undoubtedly children born there would stay.
1266. Have you ever heard any promising young fellows evince any desire to embark in the industry
while they were there ? No ; because for the last ten years I was there the outlook was not promising.
1267. But is it your impression that, if the industry were made more attractive, it would induce those
young fellows to go into it? Yes. Of course the renewal of the beds would be essential.
1268. Do you think the attractiveness of the industry would be increased if the Japanese and other aliens
were prohibited from working in the industry ? Undoubtedly.
1269. Have you any idea of the average annual earnings of white and Japanese divers ? The way they
we paid at present, their annual earnings do not exceed from £lOO .to £l5O. There has been nothing
else but Japanese divers for some years now.
1270. If the coloured aliens at present engaged in the industry were excluded, what effect would it have
he industry? lam afraid it would have the effect of stopping it altogether for a time.
M. Smith.

1271. But it would have to be done gradually—As the number of Japanese decreased, do you think it
would encourage white men to take it up ? I think so, if those who commenced could show that they
made from £159 to £209 a year. A white man would look for that much.
1272. "What kind of men were the white divers you spoke of—old sailors and odds and ends of
humanity from all parts ? Very few of them were sailors.
1273. Were they steady men? lam sorry to say that most of them were not. There were some steady
men amongst them, but they were few and far between.
1274. Were the steady men desirous of making homes for themselves and bettering their condition in
life ? Tes, and some of them did very well.
1275. Probably that induced them to go away ? Ido not think so. Most of them had to forfeit their
boats before they left.
1276. Then they fell on bad times ? They fell into the hands of the commission agents.
1277. I suppose you have a good knowledge of all the pearling-grounds ? Tes. I have been over
them all.
1278. 'By Mr. Bennett : Which are the best grounds? The Old Grounds are the most lucrative.
1279. Which are the most thoroughly depleted of shell r I think the Endeavour Strait grounds.
1280. What is the reason for shell being so scarce there ? In bad weather they could work there when
they could not work anywhere else; and, even when the Strait was closed, we had not the necessary police
to give the ground the supervision it required.
1281. You could not enforce the closure ? No.
1282. At one time those grounds were very prolific ? Yes.
1283. Were they in your time ? Tes.
1284. Do you know of them having a considerable spell at one time ? Tes.
1285. Do you remember what was the result of that spell ? They got a considerable quantity of shell
there afterwards. The grounds recuperated, and they would have been better still only for people
poaching.
1286. Can you suggest to the Commission any other ground beside the Endeavour Strait ground, which,
if closed and properly protected, might recover as the Endeavour Strait ground did for a time—Are there
any in the channels round the Prince of Wales Group, such as Aplin Pass ? Aplin Pass is as good a place
as any. I have known that place to be cleared but, and a few years after I have known 7or 8 tons to be
taken off the ground in a few days. •
1287. If Friday Island Passage was properly protected, would it not recover ? Yea ; there is a part of
Friday Island Passage which would grow shell well, but at both ends of the passage there is too much
sand for shell to thrive there.
1288. Then, coming over towards the north, what about Badu ? Those passages would grow shell very
quickly; also the grounds to the westward of Badu, at the back of Orman lleef.
1289. To the west or north ? To the north-west, between Badu and the mainland of New Guinea.
1290. So that it is your opinion that under proper conditions the closure of grounds would have a
beneficial effect in bringing about the restoration of the pearl fishery ? Tes.
1291. With regard to the working of the pearl industry, do you consider that in the past work has been
carried on without any regard to the preservation of the industry ? None whatever by the people who
were diving.
1292. As a rule, the work has been carried on continuously, has it not ? Tes, continuously; in certain
seasons of the year when they cannot work one ground they go to other grounds.
1293. Do you remember the year in which the most shell was obtained at Thursday Island ? No; I
cannot remember that.
1294. Do you remember the year when the limit of exportable shell was reduced from 6 inches
to 5 inches ? Tes.
1295. Was that in 1896? Yes ; I think it was in 1896.
1296. Do you remember what was the immediate result of that decrease in the limit of the size of shell
allowed to be exported ? They took up the small shell, and there was a great increase in the quantity of
shell raised and exported.
1297. In succeeding years what was the result ? The yield gradually decreased.
1298. Since 1897 there has been a gradual decrease in the output of shell ? Tes.
1299. Are you aware whether the number of diving boats engaged in the industry was increased
after 1897 or not ? Yes; the number was increased considerably.
1300. And there was a decrease in the output of shell, in spite of the increase in the number of boats ?
Yes.
1301. Prior to your leaving Thursday Island the decrease in the output of shell was very marked ? Tes.
1302. So much so that a number of vessels were withdrawn from the industry, were they not ? Tes; a
number of vessels left and went to the Aroe Islands.
1303. Would you attribute the withdrawal of so many vessels from the industry to the decrease in the
quantity of shell obtainable or to difficulty in obtaining labour ? The shell found was not sufficient for
the number of vessels engaged in fishing.
1304. You attribute the withdrawal of those vessels to the decrease in the quantity of shell obtained ?
Tes, I do; they went over the ground so closely.
1305. Was the Old Ground worked before you went to Thursday Island ? Before I went there.
1306. Do you consider that the Old Ground maintains its productiveness in shell? Not by a long way.
1307. Have you seen that the boats have had to go further and further away to the westward to get shell ?
Tes, up to New Guinea.
1308. And beyond Cook Shoal ? Tes.
1309. They only went out there because they could not get shell close in to Badu and the Islands ? That
is so. Formerly they did not go outside Booby Island, but they afterwards worked their way out past Cook
Beef and Cook Shoal.
1310. They used to get shell under Badu, did they not? Tes.
1311. There are now about 108 or 113 diving boats employed in the pearl-shell fishery—Do you consider
that the pearling beds would stand an increased number of boats working on them at present ? Ido not
think so—not very many. I consider that if there were 200 boats working the grounds bearing pearl-
shell in Torres Strait, the grounds would be again denuded.
M. Smith.
27MayA908.:


1312. Then, on the whole, we may take it that it is your opinion that the pearling beds require rest?
That is my firm opinion.
1313. Based on your experience of the grounds ? On my experience of the grounds.
1314. Can you indicate to the Commission an}' other beds than those mentioned a little while ago which
it might be beneficial to close ? There are beds down the coast as far as Princess Charlotte Bay.
1315. Bound the Hannibals ? Tes, out that way.
1316. And off Cape Grenville? Tes, and the passages inside Home Islands. They bear shell.
1317. Supposing it was decided to close those beds, can you tell us what would be the best means to
enforce their closure ? There must be a patrol—a particular patrol.
1318. What means would you suggest for patrolling Endeavour Strait? There should be a signal station
erected on Dayman Island, and there should be a patrol by one or two men.
1319. Good anchorage ? Tes, good anchorage. From that place the patrol could see east and west—in
fact, the whole passage.
1320. It has been suggested to the Commission that we might establish a patrol station at Port Lihou?
Port Lihou is a bit low.
1321. With the view confined to the southward and westward ? Tes.
1322. Tou would have to see round a corner to see the whole of Endeavour Strait? Tes. Tou would
have to erect the station on the point.
1323. Tou have had some experience in chasing boats ? Tes.
1324. Have you not found it difficult to secure a conviction against a boat found on prohibited grounds ?
Very hard indeed.
1325. The law with regard to that matter requires amendment, does it not ? It requires amendment very
much to make it easy to secure convictions.
1326. In what direction would you suggest that it should be amended ? If a boat is found on prohibited
ground, and is not there through stress of weather, the owner or person in charge should be called upon
to show why he is there.
1327. Do you think that a boat found fully equipped in a prohibited area should be seized, or would that
penalty be too severe ? Too severe —I would take his license away.
1328. Tou would not advocate seizing and forfeiting the boat? No, I would not. I would take the
man’s license away in the first instance, and in the second instance I would forfeit the boat.
1329. Then you would advocate the establishment of a station on Dayman Island for the patrol of
Endeavour Strait ? Tes; it is the most prominent and most central place in the Strait, and it has water
on it.
1330. Tou are well acquainted with the Darnley Island prohibited area ? Tes.
1331. That has been mostly worked by alien divers of late years, has it not ? Tes.
1332. In what depth of water was shell got in the Darnley Island prohibited area up to the time you left
Thursday Island ? There was very little shell got inside of between 30 and 40 fathoms.
1333. What class of divers were working at those depths ? Japanese and Manila men.
1334. Did many deaths occur of late years ? A good many deaths occurred every year.
1335. Were you on Thursday Island when Darnley Island was first worked? Tes. I was there when
it w T as first closed. I got thirteen convictions the first time I went out there after the first closure.
1336. What depths were being worked then ? Tip to 17 and 20 fathoms—very seldom over 20 fathoms
at that time.
1337. At what depth do you consider a man can work at diving continuously with safety in ordinary
water ? I think 16 fathoms is sufficient. A man in good health can work in 16 fathoms all day under
ordinary circumstances.
1338. What are the soundings on the Old Ground and to the westward of the Old Ground ? Up to 20
fathoms. They go right over to New Guinea, near to the Dutch settlement.
1339. But in ordinary diving on the Old Ground the depth would not exceed 15 fathoms ? No. 'They
started at 8 fathoms, but you can take the average at 15 fathoms.
1340. Do you think the temporary closing of beds for certain periods in each year would be any benefit,
or do you think the beds should be closed for a term of years ? I am of opinion that they should be
closed for a term of years.
1341. Tou do not think that closure for three or six months in each year would be sufficient ? No.
1342. The good resulting from such closure would be wiped out in the remaining part of the year ?
Undoubtedly; all the shell which took hold during the time a bed was closed would bo tramped over.
1343. Prior to the first closure of Darnley Island, were there a number of white divers working there ?
Tes ; among the number were six white divers who were working their own boats.
1344. What is the greatest number of white divers who have been engaged in the industry in any one
year ? I think there were only twenty at the most.
1345. That would be about the time of the first closure of the Darnley Island Ground, would it not? A
little before that—when they were working the Old Ground
1346. Ton do not reckon that there were more than twenty in any one year? Between twenty and
twenty-five—l am not quite certain.
1347. Of late years the number has dwindled down to none ? There was one, Hugh Beech, working in
a diving boat for Mr. Cowling.
1348. By the Chairman : Tou were at Thursday Island when Mr. Tosh was there ? Tes.
1349. Do you know what his mission was ? He went there to see if he could cultivate the pearl-oyster.
1350. As a scientist ? Tes.
1351. Do you think the pearl-shell of Torres Strait is susceptible of the same improvement as the edible
oyster with the aid of science ? I think it is quite possible that it can bo improved.
1352. I suppose you have heard of the great destruction of spat that takes place ? Tes.
1353. Do you think that could be arrested in any way ? Not by any method that I know of. It goes
with the tide.
1354. Do you know whether Mr. Tosh was hopeful of being successful ? I cannot say.

TUESDAY, 9 JUNE, 1908.
Peesent:
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Hugh Miles Milman, Government Resident, Thursday Island, examined :
1355. By the Chairman : What is your name ? Hugh Miles Milman.
>.1356. AVhat are you? lam Government Resident at Thursday Island.
• 1357. How many years have you been at Thursday Island ? I was here from 1886 to 1888, and from
1901 to the present time,
1358. The Commission has been appointed to inquire into the working of the pearl-shell and heche-de-mer
industries, and report regarding the best means of securing the following objects, namely:—(l) The
working of pearl-oyster beds in such a manner as to avoid depletion, and to make the industry regular
and permanent; (2) the scientific cultivation of pearl-oysters and the probabilities of success in that
direction; and (3) the possibilities of encouraging white divers, with a view to their gradual substitution
for aliens in that capacity ; and regarding any other matters or things relevant to the working of the
pearl-shell and heche-de-mer industries—Have you any experience of the pearl-shell industry ? Only
from observation and hearsay. I may say that I inquire, and I hear a good deal.
1359. Are you aware how long the pearling grounds in Torres Strait have been worked ? Roughly, about
thirty-eight years. Work first began about 1870.
1360. Have they been worked continuously during that period? Yes; there has never been any
interruption.
1361. Have they been worked with any regard for the preservation of the industry ? Ido not think so.
Each man has been “ on his own” ever since the industry started.
1362. In what respects has want' of care been shown ? Ido not think that any consideration has ever
been shown.
1363. In what year did the fishing attain its maximum of productiveness ? I think it was about 1897, but I
cannot say without referring to my annual reports.
1364. Do you know what caused the maximum of productiveness in that year ? No ; the development
of the industry was very gradual. Ido not think that the year when there were the most boats was the
year when there was the best take.
1365. Can you tell us the present condition of the pearling grounds ? As far as I can hear, the grounds
have recovered very considerably from the shortness of shell which existed in the years 1902, 1903,
and 1904.
1366. Do you know which grounds are the most depleted? The grounds in the immediate vicinity of
the Prince of Wales Group, up to Badu and Mua, and Endeavour Strait.
1367. Which grounds are in the best condition? The Old Ground ; but you have to go further afield
to get shell now than you had ten years ago. The nearer beds of the Old Ground are in a state of com-
parative depletion.
1368. Can you assign any reason for the depletion of some of the beds and the continued productiveness
of others ? The reason is, no doubt, owing to the accessibility of some and the inaccessibility of others.
1369. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now engaged profitably
employed without further depletion of the beds ? Under the present labour conditions, I would not
reply with confidence; but, under proper labour conditions,! should say “Yes.” Under the present
conditions, where the alien gets all the little profit there is to be made, I should question whether there
is enough shell to conduct the industry profitably.
1370. By Mr. Bennett : Even with the present number of boats ? Yes.
1371. By the Chairman : Do you consider that the number of vessels licensed for employment in the
pearl-shell fishery should be limited ? Yes, if the industry is to be carried on indefinitely at a profit.
1372. AVhat should the number be limited to ? It depends entirely on the state of the beds.
1373. On what basis do you suggest that licenses should be issued, so that no person would be unduly
favoured, and so that no monopoly would be created? Eor some time I have been advocating that theie
should be a licensing board here to issue licenses, provided that it had the power of closing certain art as
at its discretion.
1374. What is your opinion as to the probable effects of the periodical closure of the beds as a means of
maintaining, and possibly increasing, the supply of pearl-shell? Most advantageous, if not absolutely
necessary.
1375. AVhich beds do you consider should be closed ? I should close Endeavour Strait straight away.
1376. Can you assign any reason for your recommendation ? The beds there have been depleted, and
probably all the inshore beds to the eastward of AVest Island and Badu.
1377. Eor how long do you suggest the beds should be closed ? That ought to be at the discretion of
the board whose appointment I suggest. If it was found that beds which had been allowed to rest for two
or three years had plenty of shell upon them, they might be reopened. It all depends upon how the
shell increases on individual areas. It depends a good deal upon the seasons —whether during the
spatting season the young fish have been swept away by heavy winds or tides, or have been allowed to
remain.
1378. Then, in your opinion, the matter requires some consideration ? I think so. It should be entirely
at the discretion of the local board, if appointed. It would be no good closing the beds for less than
three years, as no satisfactory results could be expected before that time.
1379. Are not the inshore beds most resorted to in the north-west season? Yes, wherever there is
shelter. The boats will not go out to the deep water at that time of the year, because it is not safe.
1380. In your opinion, what are the best means of enforcing closure ? Ido not think there would be
any trouble about enforcing the closure, if you had a steamer here, provided that there was a penalty for
poaching, or for being on the ground with the possible object of getting shell. Legislation is required

making it penal for any vessel with diving gear on board to be found upon any closed area. The person
in charge of the boat should be held responsible.
1381. That would require an amendment of the present law ? Undoubtedly. You cannot do it under
the present Act. '•
1382. Then you think that fresh legislation is the best means of enforcing closure? Yes.
1383. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? Ido not think that it should
be altered —G inches.
1384. By Mr. Douglas-. It is 5 inches at present? Well, 5 inches. Ido not think it need be altered,
provided that the lessees of cultivation areas are permitted, as they are at present, to raise smaller shell
for cultivation purposes.
1385. By the Chairman : Have you any idea of the weight of a 5-inch shell as compared with the weight
of a 6-inch shell ? No. You can get more reliable information from shellers. I have never weighed
shell.
1386. Do you consider that the closure of special areas for the catchment of spat will assist in restoring
the productiveness of the pearling beds ? There is no question about it. The shell remains there, and
increases of itself.
1387. Which areas do you suggest should be closed for spatting purposes ? I think the whole of the
ground from West Island to the west end of Badu, and east for 15 or 20 miles, including all the
big reefs in Prince of Wales Channel, and Dayman Channel, and round Hawkesbury Island.
1388. For how long should such areas be closed ? I have already said.
1389. By Mr. Bennett : But lam dealing now specially with spatting areas ? It is the same thing. I
am talking about the areas to be closed to allow the fish to increase, and prevent anybody taking them
away. Ido not consider there are any special spatting areas.
1390. You do not consider it necessary, then, to set aside any spatting areas ? No. I think my previous
answer will apply to any part of the Strait. If the beds are left alone, the fish will increase naturally.
There are no particular spatting areas that I ever heard of.
1391. We used to hear a great deal about the deep water at Darnley Island supplying most of the spat
that came into the Strait ? I do not think there are any grounds for believing that. I never heard it,
except that the first shell found was on the Warrior Reef, which is the first big reef inside the Barrier.
1392. By the Chairman : In addition to the registration of vessels required by the Merchant Shipping
Act, would it be an advantage to provide for the registration of ownership in the Pearl-shell and Beche-
de-Mer Fishery Act ? Ido not see what you are driving at, as owners are obliged to register their vessels
under the Act.
1393. But that registration is not a certificate of title at law? No.
1394. I may hold a mortgage on a ship, and that mortgage is not endorsed on the register? That is so.
1395. By Mr. Bennett: The owners register under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act, and
should be registered under that Act, apart from the registration under the Merchant Shipping Act ? I
do not see why there should be any differentiation in any way. I know that the Merchant Shipping Act
does not cover fishing boats.
1396. Pardon me ; they are registered under the Merchant Shipping Act? Then your object is attained.
1397. If you look at a British certificate of registration you will see it is distinctly stated on it that it is
not a certificate of ownership—What the Commission wish to arrive at is whether some system can be
devised in fresh legislation under which the ownership of vessels shall be positively proved before they
are licensed? I was always under the impression that in the form they go through in the Shipping Office
before they are registered, ownership is satisfactorily proved. I have always understood that persons can
be proceeded against for perjury if they falsely represent themselves as owners. I have been informed
that the mere fact of registration is proof of ownership, but I have never sat or adjudicated upon a case
in which that question was involved.
1398. By the Chairman : It is not proof of ownership under the Merchant Shipping Act as regards
ships ? Well, that is as far as my belief goes—if anybody made a misstatement as to ownership under
the Merchant Shipping Act he would be liable to prosecution for perjury.
1399. By Mr. Bennett : You do not think any fresh registration is required ? No; I do not. That is
my opinion, whatever it is worth.
1400. By the Chairman : The cost of patrolling and conserving areas closed or reserved for recuperation
purposes would have to be paid for from the public revenue —Do you not think that the revenue should
be recouped by, say, a royalty on the shell raised from the conserved areas ? I have always advocated
that the rental of cultivation areas taken up under the Act should be nil, so that I cannot say that I
should recommend that the lessees should be charged anything.
1401. What is your opinion as to the effect of floating stations working with and controlling fleets of
diving vessels ? I think they are a very good thing for the owners.
1402. Is a floating station a good thing for anybody else ? Ido not mean to insinuate that it is a bad
thing for anybody else, but it is the best thing for the owners.
1403. Is it conducive to the conservation of the industry ? Unless the industry is a profitable one, it is
no good trying to conserve it. I think the industry can be made more profitable under present conditions
by the use of floating stations than in any other way.
1404. By Mr. Bennett: You say “under present conditions”? Yes. A diver goes down and may get
something, and he may get nothing it is a pure speculation.
1405. By the Chairman: Then you think floating stations are conducive to the proper carrying on of the
industry? No ; I say they are more conducive to the profits of the owner under the old system.
1406. With regard to vessels used for pump-diving purposes, jvhat is the maximum size necessary for
efficient working ? Ido not see why a vessel should not be 250 tons, if the owner likes, and he thinks
he can use it profitably. ~ , , . . .
1407. By Mr. Bennett : What do you consider should be the minimum size ? I think the minimum size,
for humanity’s sake—there, are five or six of a crew and two or three divers—should be not less than
from 12 to 14 tons. . , . ~ , . ,
1408. By the Chairman ; Can you suggest any improvements in the accommodation and fitting of the
vessels that would tend to increase the safety and comfort of the crews? I think there might be
considerable improvements made in providing for the comfort of the crews. There is not much comfort

Milman.

H. M.
Hitman.

for the crews now; but the class of labour employed consists of Papuans and coloured aliens. The
bunks are down an empty hold; the men lie down wherever they can find room, and are not very
uncomfortable, as they are not used to comfort.
. 1409. But do you think the accommodation can bo improved ? Yes.
1410. Have you any knowledge of any experiments entered upon by any person or persons for the
propagation of pearl oysters ? Propagation or cultivation ?
1411. Both ? They are different. Ido not think anybody has gone in for that kind of thing except
Mr. Saville Kent.
1412. Do you know the result of his experiments ? There has been hardly time to say what is the
result, but during the six months the shell has been there, according to Mr. Saville Kent’s account, it has
been growing very satisfactorily.
1413. Can you give us any information about the nature of that experiment ? The experiment has
proved that it is absolutely safe, under proper conditions, to remove young shell a distance of 3,000
miles. There is no trouble attached to the removal of young, immature shell from where they are found
into beds in Torres Strait.
1414. Do you know anything about the cost of Mr. Saville Kent’s operations ? No.
1415. But you have reason to believe this experiment may prove successful ? You can got the cost of
removing shell from one place to another from Mr. Mitchell, the manager for Messrs. Burns, Philp, and
Co. He is the only person here who has had practical experience in the removal of shell.
1416. What locality or localities would you suggest as the most suitable for experiments in cultivation ?
I would suggest that a hatchery or nursery should be established at Wai-Weer, in Friday Island
Passage, and that all the reefs in Ellis Channel from Goode Island to King Point on Horn Island should
be reserved for cultivation purposes.
1417. Should such experiments be conducted by private enterprise or by the State ? Ido not think such
work would be undertaken by private enterprise. There is nobody here who can afford to do it.
1418. By Mr. Bennett: Such an experiment should be undertaken by the State ? Yes; and it could be
made, as I have pointed out more than once, almost reproductive, at a low cost.
1419. By the Chairman: If leases of areas suitable for cultivation purposes were offered to individuals,
do you think they would be taken up ? It depends upon the legislation passed, and upon the provision
made by the State for the wellbeing of the leaseholders.
1420. Well, under favourable conditions, do you think they would be taken up ? Under favourable
conditions I think they would be taken up.
1421. By Mr. Bennett: What would you consider were favourable conditions? You want, first of all,
to substitute the white diver for the coloured man. To do that a sufficient time should be allowed to
enable the shellers to carry on under present conditions. Then you should institute a school for the
training of divers, which should be superintended and managed by a competent white man. The superin-
tendent of the school could teach young men from the States of Australia and New Zealand the methods
of diving followed here, the conditions at the bottom of the sea, and other local conditions. The State
could do that at a nominal cost of about £5OO a year, from which could be deducted the value of the
shell procured by the men during the time they were pupils at the training school. The cost could
be further lessened by making a charge for a certificate of competency. lam quite certain that owners
of boats would be glad to make use of white divers if they could get them ; but they cannot employ them
under present conditions owing to the absolute certainty of being boycotted by the Japanese if any
attempt were made in that direction. If they got white divers they would be able to transport immature
shell to cultivation areas.
1422. By the Chairman ; Have you had any inquiries from men in the Southern States regarding the
possibility of their finding employment here as divers ? Yes ; I have had an application from New Zealand
for such information, and Mr. Earquhar has had a similar application from a man in Victoria.
1423. You have perused Mr. Parquhar’s letter ? I forwarded it to the Treasurer.
1424. By Mr. Bennett: What rental do you think should be charged for cultivation areas? I do not
think any rental should be charged. The ground is valueless to the State unless it is improved by
cultivation, but I would make it a condition of the lease that the lessee should lay down a certain quantity
of shell, which would be a benefit not only to him but to the surrounding areas.
1425. Is that the sole condition you would impose ? Yes. I would make it a condition that he should
deposit so much shell on the ground every year, and that no aliens should be allowed leases. That should
be a sine qua non.
1426. What do you think should be the minimum term of a lease ? I do not see why it should not be
twenty years, if it were made a condition that the lessees should lay down 500 shell during the first year,
400 during the second year, 300 during the third year, and so on.
1427. By the Chairman : What capital would be required for carrying out an experiment in cultivation ?
Ido not know. You would have to provide a boat for procuring shell, or purchase the shell from other
persons who own boats. Ido not think it would require much capital.
1428. You could not say approximately what capital would be required ? No; so much depends upon
the man.
1429. How long do you think it would be before any return could be expected from such an experiment ?
From three to four years, if the shell was twelve months old when it was transferred.
1430. What labour do you think would be required to work a cultivation area ? With the exception of
the labour required to get the shell, Ido not think any would be needed. One or two boats ought to be
able to do the work of getting the shell, and there would be the expense of maintaining those boats when
the weather was bad.
1431. How many divers are at present employed in the pearl-shell fishery ? In 1906 there were 157
Japanese, 5 Filipinos, 4 Malays, and 7 Rotumah men. In 1907 there were 174 Japanese, 4 Filipinos, 1
Malay, and 1 Rotumah man ; so that the number increased in 1907. Probably since Ist January of this
year there are still more, owing to the fact that more than one diver is employed on many of the boats.
Many of the boats employ three divers. In deep water a man cannot remain down more than three or
four minutes, and three or four men go down during the course of the day.
1432. Has the increase in the number of divers had any special effect on the fishery ? None whatever.
If there are three men getting fish they will get more than one man —that is all you can go by.


1433. Do you consider it necessary or desirable that the industry should be carried on by such a number
of aliens? I think it absolutely necessary. You cannot do without them. You cannot get anybody to
take their place, and the sooner the Government recognise that the better.
1434. But what about conserving the industry for the white race ? If you replace them by somebody
else, the shellers will be only too glad to employ them.
1435. By Mr. Bennett: Do you consider that such a condition of things is necessary ? It is
unavoidable.
143 G. By Mr. Douglas : Do you refer to divers or to crews ? lam only talking of divers. There is an
ample supply of labour for crews.
1437. By the Chairman -. But if white divers were available, would you consider aliens indispensable ?
No; but they are indispensable under present conditions.
1438. We have been discussing the number of alien divers, and the question that arises from that is
whether you consider such a condition of things necessary ? You were asking me about white divers.
There are no white divers. Under present conditions you cannot do without the alien divers. There is
nobody to take their place.
1439. By Mr. Bennett-. Then your answer is that they are unavoidable under present conditions? Yes.
1440. By the Chairman : Are you in favour of a change in the system, and of employing white divers
only ? 1 believe it is perfectly feasible to get white divers to replace the aliens, with State aid—not
leaving it to the shellers themselves. They require State aid to do it.
1441. You have received a letter from a man in New Zealand, making inquiries as to the possibility of
finding employment as a diver, have you not ? Yes.
1442. Can you produce the letter ? Yes. [ Copy of letter •produced. Letter subsequently tendered by
Mr. Farquhar. Vide Appendix AT. ]
1443. Do you consider that at present the vessels offer sufficient inducements in the way of accommo-
dation and comfort to make the industry attractive to white divers ? It is not the vessels alone, but I
think the present conditions of employment are not sufficiently attractive, in combination with the quarters
provided, to induce white labour to offer.
1444. You think that the vessels and the present conditions could be improved to induce white divers to
enter the industry ? Ido not want to get cornered at all. I want to make it clear that the present
conditions must be altered to offer white men sufficient inducement; that is, from a humanitarian point
of view. If a man is paid £l,OOO a year, he will live in a hovel; if he is paid £5OO a year, he wants
decent quarters; if you pay him £2OO a year
1445. We shall come to that later on—you think that the present accommodation on the boats could be
made more attractive ? Yes, and an alteration made in the rate of payment to make it sufficient to induce
white men to enter the industry. They will not do so on the present scale of payment.
1446. Have you any idea of the rate per ton paid to coloured divers for raising shell ? Up to £BO a ton,
and all pearls, and they provide the vessel and the upkeep, and until this year the diving gear.
1447. By Mr. Bennett ; Do I understand you to say that the divers provide the vessel ? The owner
provides the vessel, and pays for its upkeep. The diver pays wages, and finds the food.
1448. Has he to make any further payment, such as insurance ? No ; the owners do that.
1449. By the Chairman : What are the average annual earnings of a diver at those rates ? lam not
sufficiently conversant with the matter. I have been told all sorts of things ; but the owners themselves
can give you the actual facts.
1450. By Mr. Bennett : Do you know whether the divers pay for repairs ? No ; the owners do.
1451. By the Chairman-. Do you know if the industry is profitable to the owner under those conditions?
Ask the owners. Ido not know. They will tell you that they are all being ruined.
1452. Can you tell us what the divers earn ? No ; the Japanese have told me that they have earned
about £l2O a year. I have heard from shellers that they make between £4OO and £5OO a year; but
such information is of no value.
1453. Can you tell us whether all the tenders employed are coloured aliens ? All of them, I think.
There were only seven Europeans employed in the industry in 1906, and seventeen in 1907.
1454. If white divers were employed, do you think they would require to have white tenders ? I think
they would be safer with them. Their lives are in their tenders’ hands. I should be very sorry to trust
myself to a Japanese tender.
1455. By Mr. Bennett -. In the event of white tenders being employed, I suppose they would have to
be paid higher wages than the coloured tenders ? The coloured tenders get rattling good pay. The
divers’ lives are in their hands, and a diver will pay a good tender a good wage on that account.
1456. The tender is responsible for the diving gear, the pump, and the diver ? Yes.
1457. By the Chairman-. Can you give us any idea of the effect of diving on the health of the divers ?
I have held numerous inquiries into the deaths of divers. Last year there were only three; the year
before there were ten. I have been of the opinion all along that divers ought to undergo a medical
examination before they go on a trip. In the course of the inquiries, it has come out that a man had a
bad attack three months before, and was very nearly dead ; in another ease, the man had an attack six
months before. The second or the third attack is inevitably fatal.
1458. What diseases or complaints are attributable to diving ? Heart affections. If their hearts were
wrong, a doctor would not give them certificates. No diver should be licensed without a medical certi-
ficate ; and he ought to get a fresh certificate every time he goes out, even if it is only after an interval
of three months. It would save life. Of course, you cannot absolutely prevent the healthiest man risk-
ing his life, if he likes to go down in 40 or 50 fathoms, as they do, out of bravado as much as anything
else. But ’then the question comes in, Who is to pay the expense of the examination ?
1459. By Mr. Douglas : You stated that you did not see any reason why a vessel of any size should not
be employed—the question you were asked had reference to the system of working the industry with a
fleet of luggers under the control of a large floating station ? It is not absolutely necessary that they
should have any boats with them.
1460. There was a suggestion made some little time ago—possibly you may have been aware of it—by a
number of the shelling people themselves, that vessels licensed under the Act should not be more than
25 tons? I know nothing'of it.
1461. No doubt the feeling was that the system ot working with a fleet under the control of a large
schooner tended to rake the beds more than was desirable in the interests of their permanency—Bearing

that in mind, do you think it desirable to limit the size of vessels ? Ton do not limit the size of vessels
that accompany them. If the smaller vessels could live out there, you would not have more than one big
* one. You have to suit your wants to the smallest vessel, not to the biggest.
i. 1462. Probably you know the reasons why in the past it has been thought desirable to work with a fleet
under a large schooner ? Yes.
1463. Will you state what the reasons were ? No ; I can give my own ideas on the subject. They can
look better after the boats.
1464. They can exercise better supervision ? Yes. I know that during the last three or four months
many boats left the grounds when there was no occasion for it. If the boats had been bigger, they
would have stopped out.
1465. And probably that has resulted in those vessels not securing catches of shell? Very likely. These
inexperienced Japanese divers have been frightened in by the weather.
1466. They work much further out now than they did in the early days ? They have to. The inside
beds have been depleted to a great extent. There is any amount of shell further out.
1467. That would probably be one of the advantages of having a large schooner to attend on them ?
Yes.
1468. Do you think the beds get a fair chance to recuperate under that system of working? Again it
depends upon the number of boats. If forty big schooners were to go out, it would be a very bad thing,
because the boats would concentrate their fishing round the schooners, and work out in concentric rings.
I think their own interests would lead them to remove to other areas further out when they found the
supplies of shell wei'e getting low. Then we could close the inner beds altogether for a time.
1469. Working under that system would hardly lead to any permanent settlement? No. lam only
talking of going down on the mere chance of getting a shell at the bottom. The water may be too thick
for the diver to see to work, and it may remain thick for a week, and he may not get one shell. All
these conditions would not arise under a system of cultivation.
1469 a. In addition to limiting the number of boats, would it not be desirable to limit the tonnage of the
vessels employed? Ido not think that makes any difference. It will not pay to keep a big vessel out
at sea, as the wear and tear will be greater than the wear and tear on a small boat. But by having a
larger vessel in the fleet the small boats are kept constantly on the ground.
1470. By the Chairman : Do you think that, under amended legislation allowing persons to take up
extended areas, it would be possible to settle white families on some of the islands and islets in the
Straits ? lam in great hopes that, once a system of cultivation of pearl-shell cultivation .is established,
every island in Torres Strait will be inhabited by white people. There is nothing to prevent white people
making good homes there at very small cost.
1471. I suppose you know of numerous places where such settlement could be established ? I know
every reef in the Strait.
1472. You know several islands suitable for that purpose ? I suppose I could name thirty or forty
straight off the reel suitable for cultivation.
1473. Then, with your long experience here, you think it is quite possible to carry on the industry with
white labour ? Yes, provided you can get it.
1474. If you could get white men, and could train them as divers, they could carry on the industry?
Yes. I think you would have no trouble in getting white men and paying them, but the State must do
it, on account of the difficulties which would be raised by the Japanese, who would put every obstacle in
the way of anybody replacing them. I should be very sorry for a white man to have a Japanese tender.
1475. Do you know any diseases to which divers are subject which may prove fatal? Yes; and those
diseases are probably made worse by diving.
1476. Diving will accelerate death ? It will probably induce the diver’s complaint—semi-paralysis.
1477. Will it induce any other disease? No; not as long as the heart is right. It is failure of the
heart, or semi-paralysis, which is generally the cause of death.
1478. But does not diving conduce to other diseases? Ido not know. Those who have died have died
of semi-paralysis, and in many instances the men have suffered from the effects of diving on a previous
occasion.
1479. By Mr. Bennett : You have stated that the present condition of the pearling grounds generally has
been brought about by depletion ? There is no doubt about it.
1480. Do you consider that the depletion is due to over-working of the beds ? I do not think it can be
attributed to anything else.
1481. As one means of limiting the ’number of boats employed in the fishery, you advocate the
establishment of a licensing board ? Yes.
1482. How do you suggest that such a board should be constituted ? I would suggest that the Pearlers’
Association should appoint one member of the board, that the Commonwealth officer, who is the
Sub-collector of Customs, should be another member, and that the Government llesident should be the
third. If it was thought desirable not to have the Government Hesident on the board—which is possible,
seeing that he might have to adjudicate on cases—l would suggest that the local Inspector of Pearl-
shell Fisheries should be the third member.
1483. But he might have to prosecute in cases arising under the Act ? There are two inspectors here,
and there will probably be more.
1484. Then preferably the Chief Inspector should be the third member of the board ? Well, you could
provide in the Bill which it would be necessary to introduce that one inspector should be styled the Chief
Inspector. It would be desirable to have one senior to the others.
1485. Such legislation would be on the lines of the Local Authorities Act ? Yes. The board should
have power to close areas. That is more important than controlling the number of boats, because, if they
have the power to close areas, they can close them against everybody.
1486. With regard to the closure of areas, do you think that, if a board were vested with such powers,
one steamer would be sufficient for patrol purposes? No; I think we should have one steamer and two
oil launches which would travel without showing smoke.
1487. You do not believe in the smoke? Well, I think you could do without it. We want a steamer here,
and with it we should have two tenders.
1488. By Mr. Douglas-. You think that absolutely necessary ? Yes, to protect the closed areas.

MINUTES or EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOEE THE PEAEL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAI COMMISSION.


1489. I take it that a vessel of that kind would he able to go over any of the reefs ? Yes. I have had
to follow boats myself. They always go straight to windward. You need to alter your rig and your
colour every time, so that the shelters will not recognise your boat.
1490. By Mr, Bennett: If Endeavour Strait were closed, would it be an assistance to have an inspector 1
stationed on some suitable island near the Strait ? Ido not think that would be necessary. If you got
one or two convictions, and the men got twelve months each in gaol, they would not go there again.
1491. You do not think it would be necessary to have a patrol officer stationed on an island ? Not as a
fixture, because the men would not go near if they knew he was there ; but 1 think that the steamer
the “ John Douglas,” or whatever you call her—should have two oil tenders, which could be run very
cheaply.
1492. You stated that you reckoned that young shell laid down on cultivation grounds would be valuable
in three years ? In three or four years.
1493. Can you quote any authority for that ? Yes; I understand from Mr. Saville Kent that shell
matures in from five to six years. Probably it attains its maximum width at the end of five and a-half or
six years. Six inches is not the maximum, but, if the shell grows to that size in six years, I think that
should be satisfactory.
1494. By the Chairman: Has the transference of shell to the Eastern Pacific been a success? Mr.
Saville Kent moved 1,500 shells 3,000 miles, and the toss was about thirty shells.
1495. Has the transfer been a success ? Mr. Saville Kent has been there only twelve months, and he
states that the shell are growing well, and that the temperature of the water is about the same as it is
here.
1490. By Mr. Bennett: You have only Mr. Saville Kent’s authority for saying that shell will bo valuable
in the time you mention ? Yes.
1497. You think that 5 inches is a sufficient limit for marketable shell ? Yes. As long as shell of a
much smaller size may be removed for cultivation purposes, I do not think it is necessary to increase the
size limit.
1498. Do you know that there is a difference of as much as 50 per cent, between the weight of a 5-inch
and a 6-inch shell? No ; but I know that there is a difference of something like £3O or £4O per ton in
the price of 5-inch shell as compared with that of G-inch shell. The 5-inch shell is worth more than the
6-inch.
1499. You say that many of the islands in Torres Strait are suitable for settlement by white men —Would
you mind mentioning the names of a few ? I shall be very glad to do so. There are Stevens Island,
Darnley, Yorke, Cocoa-nut, Yama, The Brothers, Mabuiag, Mua, Badu, West, Prince of Wales, and
Hawkesbury Islands.
1500. Generally, you consider that most of the islands in the Strait are suitable for white settlement ?
Eifty of them are suitable.
1501. Have they all got water? Some have, but not all. We have a big rainfall, and the water must
be stored.
1502. There are natives on some of the islands, are there not ? Yes.
1503. Murray Island carries a fairly native population, does it not ? About 400.
1504. And Darnley Island has a native population ? Yes.
1505. Stevens Island is depopulated now ? No ; the population there is increasing.
1506. Do you consider that the islands which have a native population should be thrown open to white
settlement ? Ido not think it would hurt them ; but I would not allow aliens to settle on the islands.
Occupation licenses should be granted to white men on the condition that they employ only white people.
You do not want to make an island a home for beach-combers. That would be the very worst thing that
could happen.
1507. The natives of the islands have a very fair idea of their vested rights ? Yes; but I do not think
white settlement would interfere with them. Every cocoanut is owned by a native. A man went to one
of the islands once and cut down five cocoanut trees, and had to pay three individual owners for those
five trees.
1508. By the Chairman : This morning you were good enough to read to the members of the Commission
some correspondence respecting the industry and some suggestions which you made to the Government—
Will vou kindly supply the Commission with the documents in order that they may be incorporated with
the evidence ? Yes.
1509. What are the dates of those letters ? There is one dated 25th August, 1906, addressed to the
Under Secretary, Chief Secretary’s Department; another dated 21st January, 1907, addressed to the
Under Secretary to the Treasury; the letter I have already alluded to, dated Ist Eebruary, 1908,
addressed tome by D. Johnstone, Kingsland, Auckland, New Zealand; and my letter to the Under
Secretary, Chief Secretary’s Department, of 21st February, 1908, referring to the subject-matter of Mr.
Johnstone’s letter. [Letters produced. Vide Appendix 1., Nos. 1,2, 3, and 4.]
1510. By Mr. Bennett: With regard to any further legislation that may be proposed, dealing with the
pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries, do you think it advisable that each fishery should be dealt with as
a separate industry ? Ido not think that is necessary.
1511. If the two industries are dealt with in one amending Act, would it not be advisable to keep them
distinct in such Act seeing that they are not worked together ? I think that would only make the matter
more cumbersome. ’ You might style the Act differently, and call it the Northern Fisheries Act, or
something like that, and that would cover everything.
1512. You do not consider it advisable that a vessel should be licensed tor the pearl-shell fishery only, and
not for the beche-de-mer fishery ? No.
1513. She should be engaged in whichever she chooses ? Yes, because she cannot do any diving without
having a licensed diver on board. .
1514. You are no doubt aware that a diver s license allows a man to go in charge ot a vessel, whether she
is engaged in the pearl-shell fishery or in the beche-de-mer fishery ? Quite so. But if she were to
engage in the beche-de-mer fishery, she should not be allowed to do any diving.
1515? Under present conditions she could ? If the man in charge had a diver s license.
1516. But he has a diver’s license ? Then why should he not do as he likes ?

WEDNESDAY, 10 JUNE, 1908.
PEESENT:
Captain J. MACK AT {Chairman) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
, John Moody Costxn, Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries, Shipping Master, and Protector of
Aboriginals, examined:
. 1518. By the Chairman : "What particular duties come under the offices held by you ? Under the heading
of Inspector of Fisheries 1 have duties in connection with the pearl-shell industry, and as Shipping
Master I have to attend to the signing on and discharging of crews under the Merchant Shipping Act.
1519. Do you issue any licenses ? No.
1520. Ton issue no licenses in connection with the working of the beche-de-mer or the pearl-shell
industry? No.
1521. Who issues licenses ? The Customs Department.
1522. Is that system conducive to the successful carrying on of the pearl-shell industry ? I think it should
be altered, for administrative reasons.
1523. Will you mention some of those reasons ? Under the present system the Inspector of Fisheries is
not aware who gets licenses; he has no say as to who shall get or shall not get licenses. People go to the
Custom House and get licenses for divers and men in charge. Those licenses are not noted on the
articles, and the Shipping Master does not know anything about them.
1524. They are not noted on the articles ? The employer is not obliged to come to the Shipping Office
to note the licenses on the articles, and a man who signed on originally as one of the crew for, say, a
term of three years may for two years of that term be working as a diver.
1525. And you have no knowledge of that? No.
1526. After you have closed the articles as Shipping Master, has the Customs Officer then authority to
issue a license to a diver to accompany that vessel ? Tes.
1527. So that there is no record of that diver’s engagement on the articles ? There is nothing certain
about it.
1528. By Mr. Bennett : But he is on the articles ? Tes, he is pn the articles as a member of the crew.
1529. By the Chairman : That alters the whole aspect of the question—I asked you if it was possible for
the Collector of Customs to issue licenses after the articles were closed ? Tes. It is done.
1530. By Mr. Douglas : But the articles are never closed ? The crew may sign on to-day with one diver
as a member of the crew; the employer might wish to have another diver or two, and he can go to the
Collector of Customs and get one or two more licenses, and the Inspector of Fisheries may know
nothing about the matter.
1531. By the Chairman : By the closing of the articles I mean when the applicant pays the shipping fees,
and you hand him the articles ? Quite so.
1532. And you say it is possible for the owner, after the articles are closed, to get two or three more
divers’ licenses ? Tes, an employer may alter the status of the crew he has on the articles by getting more
divers’ licenses.
1533. That is one of the reasons why you suggest that there should be a change in the method of
administration ? Tes.
1534. Is there any other reason ? Another reason is that there is some fault to be found with the way in
which the records are kept. I have wanted to know where a certain man who I knew was employed as
a diver was working, and I found that the records did not show on which boat he was working.
1535. By Mr. Bennett ; Who finds fault ? I find fault. I have prepared a list of divers’and “ in-charge ”
licenses for 1907, and it was only with very great difficulty that I have been able ito ascertain whether
those licenses have been renewed. In fact, I have not been able to tell in some instances whether they
have been renewed or not.
1530. By the Chairman : Tou have no means of controlling that ? No ; I have no means of checking it.
I find out on what boat’s articles a diver’s name appears, and then I have to go to the Customs Office to
ascertain if the license has been renewed, and there I have to look through a list which is not in
alphabetical order, and which does not give the full names of the Japanese in every case.
1537. Do you think that this dual administration interferes with the proper working of the industry?
The dual control hampers administration very much. I think the issuing of licenses and everything else
should come under the one authority. Personally, I do not care who that one authority is.

Eesidency, Thursday Island,
15th June, 1908.
Sib, —In giving my evidence before your Commission on the 9th instant, I omitted to mention that it would
much safeguard the lives of the divers if a condition of obtaining a license should be the production of a doctor’s
certificate to the effect that the applicant was physically fit to act as a diver. Licenses should require to be
renewed every six months, and no fee should be charged for such license if accompanied with medical certificate.
I have, &c.,
HUGH MILMAN, Government Eesident.

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOEE THE PEAEL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAL COMMISSION.


1538. You think that the duties at present performed by yourself and the Federal Sub-collector of
Customs should be carried out by one officer ? Ido ; and I would go a little bit further. There are
occupation licenses issued by tlm Commissioner for Crown Lands, and the Government Resident issues
other licenses. At the present time there are three different authorities issuing licenses under the one
Act. b
1539. Who is the Commissioner for Crown Lands here? The Clerk of Potty Sessions.
1540. Is the issue of occupation licenses one of the special duties of the Clerk of Petty Sessions in his
capacity as Commissioner for Crown Lands ? Yes, the Act lays that down as one of his duties.
1541. Does he issue those licenses under the control or authority of Mr. Milman ? No ; he acts under
section 10 of the principal Act—“ The Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery jLct o/’1881.”
1542. Where do the duties of the Crown Lands Commissioner infringe on the pearl-shell industry ? I
do not see what he should have to do with the matter at all.
1543. Then you think the duties at present carried out by the Crown Lands Commissioner should be
carried out by yourself ? Not altogether by myself, but that all those duties should be performed by
one officer. Ido not care who he is.
1544. By Mr. Douglas : By the officer issuing pearl-shelling licenses ? Yes : the work is not too much
for one officer.
1545. By Mr. Bennett: By the officer administering the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act ?
Yes.
1546. By the Chairman : Do you think that such a change would be beneficial to those engaged in the
industry ? The present system hampers administration.
1547. If the administration is faulty, it is reasonable to infer that the people who depend upon that
administration suffer in some way ? I have no evidence that any hardship is experienced by the public.
1548. Is it not a hardship to a business man to have to attend two or three offices in order to obtain
information which he should be able to get at one office ? Yes. It would certainly be more convenient
for people engaged in the pearl-shell industry if all the duties referred to were carried out by one officer.
1549. Through whom do applications go for the leasing of pearling-grounds below high-water mark—that
is, applications under section 16 of the amending Act of 1881 ? Those applications are submitted to
Brisbane.
1550. Do they go through you as Shipping Master and Inspector of Fisheries? • Yes; they go through
me to the Treasury. There has been only one application up to the present; that is the one from Mr.
Saville Kent.
1551. By Mr. Bennett: Who collects the rent for those areas? lam going to remind him when it is
due.
1552. Then you collect the rent ? He has paid £2O.
1553. To you ? To me.
1554. Then you collect the rent ? Yes, I will collect it.
1555. By the Chairman : How long have you been at Thursday Island? I have been here only eight
months. I was here twelve years ago, but, of course, I did not bother much about pearling then.
1556. I suppose you have acquired no experience in the practical working of the industrv apart from
your own administrative duties ? No. I would like to point out that under section 14 of the Act of
1881, 55 Vic., licenses to deal in pearls are issued by the Police Magistrate.
1557. By Mr. Bennett: Do you consider that matter should be under the control of the officer
administering the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act ? Yes. I think the Inspector of Fisheries
should have some say as to the persons who are licensed to deal in pearls.
1558. By the Chairman : At present any person can come along and get a license ? He must be of good
character and reputation.
1559. You know how very easy it is to get credentials of that kind—Would not the Police Magistrate be
more likely to know what persons should be allowed to buy pearls than you would be —Would he not
have better opportunities of knowing the character of people ? Yes.
1560. With Mr. Milman’s knowledge of the North, extending over many years, is it not reasonable to
assume that he would have a better opportunity of knowing who is deserving of a dealer’s license than
you, after,a sojourn here of eight months ? Yes; but the personal aspect does not enter into the matter
at all.
1661. By Mr. Bennett: You are only referring to it from the standpoint of the administration of the
Act ? Yes. I know that a license has been granted to a Japanese.
1562. By the Chairman: Do you think it right that a man coming here by steamer with the intention of
buying pearls, and only remaining for a week or so, should be given a license to compete with permanent
resident dealers ? Ido not.
1563. By Mr. Bennett: Is that your principal objection ? Yes. They simply come here to exploit the
market.
1564. They are purchasers only? Yes. They have no interest or stake in the place. They are simply
speculators.
1565. Might not the fact that such men come here afford a bettet market for those who have pearls to
sell? If the resident licensed dealers were disposed to form a ring, I have no doubt it would be of
value from that point of view. It might break up the ring. That is the only benefit I can see.
1566. Then one of the objections to such men receiving licenses is that the licensing authority, as a rule,
could not have any knowledge of the character or reputation of the applicant ? That is so.
1567. Is there not more likelihood, also, of stolen pearls being sold to such dealers than to residents of
the Island? Most certainly. Ido not suppose any of them would inquire as to whether the sellers
were licensed dealers.
1568. By Mr. Douglas : What term of residence would you suggest to qualify a person to obtain a
license ? I think he should be here at least twelve months—sufficiently long to give him a vote.
1569. By the Chairman : Have you ever heard of any intention on the part of the local dealers to form a
ring? There have been some queer experiences. Take a pearl to one buyer, and then go across the
street to another, and their offers are very much the same. That has been my own experience.
1570. Can you suggest any means by which the industry can be made more attractive to the white man ?
I do not think the”industry has, or could have, any attractions for a white man for any length of time,
Working as a diver or working on the boats.

1. 1571. Do you think it is possible to make it sufficiently attractive to induce white men to engage in it ?
, If good wages were paid, possibly a few white men would come forward.
1.1572. By Mr. Douglas : It is entirely a question of wages and what a man can earn ? Yes. A man will
do almost anything for money.
1573. By the Chairman : Do you think that, with sufficient inducement, white men could carry on the
industry ? The white man can do a diver’s work —there is no doubt in my mind about that; but the
question arises whether the fleet-owners can give sufficient wages and carry on the industry with profit
to themselves.
1574. Tour remarks are based on the existing conditions ? Yes.
1575. Supposing the present law were altered with a view to making the industry more attractive and
remunerative to the white man, do you think white men could carry it on ? I certainly think it is worthy
of an attempt being made. It.should be taken away from the aliens if it can possibly be done.
1576. By Mr. Douglas-. Are you in a position to say what are the average annual earnings of a diver
under the present system ? No, I have no idea.
1577. The money earned-is paid before you as Shipping Master, and statements of account are presented
to you ? No ; only when there are disputes, and then they show very vague details —nothing on which
I can base an estimate. Section 2of 57 Vic. provides that a man shall be paid in the presence of the
Shipping Master, but the section is inoperative.
1578. By the Chairman : Then it is a dead letter ? It is not operative.
1579. There is no attempt to evade the Merchant Shipping Act in ports where there are white crews,
and Ido not see why there should bo here? As far as I can gather, it has always been a dead letter
1580. I should think that for their own sake the shellers would render an account of wages—You admit
that they come to you in the event of disputes? An employer brings one of the crew to my office. I
ask what wages are coming to the man. The employer may say that the amount is nothing, or that it is
so much. I ask the man if the statement is correct; and, if he says “ Yes,” he agrees to it.
1581. You do not confirm that statement by seeing the usual statement in the log ? No. If a man says
the employer’s statement is not correct, I call upon the employer to furnish me with a statement of
earnings and withdrawals.
1582. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know about the existence of the slop chest ? Yes.
1583. The slop-chest books are produced, are they not ? Yes.
1584. By Mr. Douglas : Have you ever had any difficulty in obtaining an account of the wages, if
required? No.
1585. By Mr. Bennett: But the six months’ payments mentioned in section 2of the Act have never been
in operation while you have been at Thursday Island ? No.
1586. By Mr. Douglas : What is the maximum time a man can be engaged for at the Shipping Office to
work in the pearl-shell industry ? Indented Japanese have been engaged for a term of three years.
1587. Does that statement refer to Japanese only, or. to other aliens as well ? Other aliens do not sign
on for as long a term.
1588. Would not coloured aliens from Singapore sign on for that period? As far as the Shipping Master
is concerned, indented labour has to be signed on for three years, but not indented labour from New
Guinea.
1589. What is the maximum term of engagement for labour other than indented labour? Aboriginals
are engaged for periods not exceeding twelve months, and other labour for periods of from twelve to
eighteen months.
1590. By the Chairman : During the eight months you have been here, have you ever known any
injustice done to the employees by employers —for instance, in those cases of dispute which you have
been called upon to determine ? I have allowed what I thought was a fair thing as between master
and servant, and have seen that what I allowed was carried out, whether the employer objected or not.
1591. Did the employer make matters right as soon as you drew his attention to them ? Yes.
1592. There was no intention to defraud the employees ? No.
1593. By Mr. Bennett: What is the current rate of wages now paid to crews—that is, pump hands and
deck hands ? I can only give you the wages shown on some of the articles.
1594. Do you not know pretty well what they are —Do they run as high as £3 a month in some cases ?
I do not think so. You understand that in some of the articles a man signs on for so much in the Shipping
Office
1595. Yes—all I want to know is the amount stated in the articles? Indented Japanese get £1 10s. a
month the first year, £1 15s. a month the second year, and £2 a month the third year. The greater
number of them are employed on those terms. Some come here at £2 ss. a month, but there is some
alteration made in regard to providing for their return passage.
1596. Then the wages for indented Japanese range from £1 10s. to £2 a month ? Yes.
1597. Do the men already here—free men, I think they are called —receive any higher rate of wages ?
Sometimes they get £2 ss. and £2 10s. a month.
1598. Are £2 10s. a month about the highest wages for crews that have come under your notice ? Yes.
1599. What do tenders generally receive? £4 a month.
1600. There is a regular form of agreement for vessels under which divers are paid so much per ton ?
Yes.
1601. Can you furnish the Commission with a copy of the form of that agreement ? Yes; there are
agreements for both deep and shallow water divers. They are attached to the back of the ordinary ships’
articles, and are signed by the divers as part of their agreements. [ Documents produced—Vide
Appendices IV. and V.]
1602. Will you kindly fix up a copy of articles without inserting the names of the men, just as they
would be when you start signing the men on ? Yes, I will. [ Document subsequently produced.^
1603. By the Chairman-. Have those agreements any legal status? Ido not think the Inspector here
has ever got a ruling on the question.
1604. What authority have you for attaching those agreements to the articles? On looking through
them they did not appear to me to be in contravention of the Act.
1605. So far as you know, there is nothing in them contrary to the provisions of the Pearl-shell and
Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act ? So far as I know, there is nothing.

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PICARL-SIIELIi AND BECHE-DE-MEE ROYAL COMMISSION.


1606. By Mr. Bennett: Have you gone into the matter? Tea ; I have compared the agreements with'
the Act.
1607. Have any instances of attempts to export small shell come under your notice as Inspector ? There :
has been one instance.
1608. AVhat action was taken ? I seized the shell, and cautioned the owners. I found that they had
given instructions to their employees not to lift such shell, but that those instructions had been
disobeyed.
1609. Was the shell on the wharf ? It was on the jetty.
1610. Who examines shell now? Captain Bruce and myself.
1011. Did you submit the matter to anyone ? I seized the shell, and reported the matter to the Port
Master in Brisbane.
1612. Can you give us any idea of the percentage of shell between 5 and 6 inches in the shell exported?
I can give that information from the commencement of this year—that is all.
1613. Will you oblige us with that information later on ? Yes.
1614. You have prepared a return showing the number of licensed boats, licensed divers, the nationalities
of the crews, &c. ? Yes [Document produced — Vide Appendix Vl.]
1615. There is a provision requiring boats to be marked with the port letter —it is “A ” for Thursday
Island —and a distinguishing number—ls that provision observed now ? Yes. Of course, the Japanese
sometimes put them on the wrong way round.
1616. By Mr. Douglas-. Is there any record kept of boats as they come in and go out of port on their
pearling expeditions ? No.
1617. Are you aware that there are certain charges levied under “ The Port Dues Decision Act q/’lBB2 ’’?
Yes.
1618. You do not collect those charges ? No.
1619. Do you think it desirable that the Shipping Master should make those collections; in addition to
collecting other fees ? Yes, that work would more properly come under the Inspector of Fisheries.
1620. As Inspector of Fisheries it is part of your duty to make a periodical examination of diving boats?
Yes.
1621. And diving gear ? Yes.
1622. How often does that examination take place ? Every six months, in January and July, as stipulated
by the Act.
1623. There is no official information in your department, either as Shipping Master or Inspector of
Fisheries, to show that any vessel licensed under the Act has entered the port during the interval between
those months? No.
1624. Are those examinations made in port ? Yes ; always in port since I have been here.
1625. So that in reality you only see each vessel engaged in the industry once every six months? That
is all.
1626. By Mr. Bennett : Can you furnish the Commission with a return showing the number of men
employed in pearling and beche-de-mer vessels respectively during 1907 ? lam afraid that I cannot
furnish a reliable return, because the owners have fleet articles, and have perhaps twenty boats on their
articles. Some of them may be beche-de-mer fishing, and the rest pearling; and the shipping master
does not know how the men are employed.
1627. From your answers I gather that it is your opinion that there is too much divided control in the
work connected with the fisheries ? Yes. I do not think the volume of work calls for that divided
control.
1628. Are you aware that at one time the work was all under one officer ? Yes.
1629. You have studied the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Acts, I presume, during the time you have been
charged with the duty of administering them ? Yes.
1630. Would it, in your opinion, be advantageous to have those Acts consolidated? Yes; I came here
to recommend that.
1631. In the event of a consolidation of the law, should the legislation regarding the pearl-shell fishery
be kept distinct from the legislation regarding the beche-de-mer fishery ? I think the administration
would be much helped if we had two distinct Acts.
1632. You know how the Navigation Act is divided into parts dealing with different subjects ? Yes.
1633. Could not the two fisheries be treated in the same way in the one consolidating Act ? I should
prefer to have two distinct Acts.
1634. By the Chairman : Do you wish to imply that the two Acts should be' worked by the one adminis-
tration ? No. They could be worked by the one administration; but it would be better to have two
Acts, because beche-de-mer is worked by very small pettifogging boats. It is a small man’s industry.
1635. Could not that be done by regulation, keeping the working of the two fisheries distinct ? Possibly
it could, but the two are too much intermixed at present.
1636. Can you effectively peform the duties you have to perform in connection with the two fisheries by
yourself? My only difficulty is about closing the office while lam out in the harbour.
1637. Do you think that would be satisfactory ? I want an assistant in the shipping office.
1638. Can you carry out the duties which you are asked to perform ? I think so.
1639. "With satisfaction to the shellers ? I think so, provided I had somebody in the office.
1640. But that entails two officers ? Yes.
1641. Could you do the work yourself ? No.
1642. To carrv out the duties efficiently you consider an assistant is necessary? I do, to carry out the
duties with satisfaction to the public. I cannot be in two places at one time. lam often wanted in the
Shipping Office when I have to be out in the harbour.
1643. By Mr. Douglas ; I notice in the return you have prepared that last year of the 165 divers
licensed, 164 were Japanese? Yes. . .
1614. This was the number up to the date when the recent temporary restrictions were placed on them ?
That is up to 31st May last.
1645. Then I notice further on that there are 112 vessels licensed apparently for pearl-shelling ? Yes.
1646. Are there many of those vessels employing more than one diver? I cannot tell where the divers
are; there is no record. The Customs cannot tell me where they are.

10June^l908.
n. 1647. Presumably the 105 divers are engaged on the 112 pearling boats ? Yes.
» 1048. Otherwise their licenses would not have been taken out ? Yes. There may be more not licensed,
ig. 1040. In your return you have set out that there are twenty-eight vessels engaged in the beche-de-mer
fishing—l take it there would be nothing to prevent a vessel at present engaged in the beche-de-mer
fishing being transferred to the pearl-shell fishing and used with a pump on board ? There is nothing to
prevent it. That return is not complete. I have not got particulars of the fleets of Jimmy Mills and
some others. You notice at the bottom there are thirty other owners. They are aliens, and Ido not
know whether they are pearl-shelling, beche-de-mer fishii g, or swimming diving.
1050. By Mr. Bennett : Will you make inquiries with a view to obtaining that information for the
Commission ? Yes.
1051. By Mr. Douglas: There have been 180 vessels licensed this year? Yes. That is the number at
the present moment.
1652. Have you received any applications for further licenses ? The Japanese have spoken to me about
three boats that are now being built.
1653. Are there some boats on the slips at present ? There are three in course of construction.
1054. For whom are they being built ? The matter came under my notice some days ago. I found that
the boats were being built for nobody in particular, and it was quite possible that, if I wanted to buy a
boat, 1 could do so.
1655. That is in your capacity as Protector of .Aboriginals ? Yes ; I could buy one of the boats, and they
were entitled to licenses under the ruling given. I resubmitted the matter -
1050. You think these boats would be entitled to licenses ? They would have been; but I resubmitted
the matter while my chief was travelling up, and I got it reversed.
1657. So that the vessels at present being built cannot be employed in the shelling industry unless they
are utilised by the natives under your control ? Yes, that is the only way they can be employed.
1658. As Protector of Aboriginals, you have under your control a number of vessels that are not required
to be licensed at all ? Yes, eighteen.
1659. It has been a privilege of the natives that they have not had to pay any license fees or any shipping
fees ? Yes.
1660. They do not sign their men on any articles? No. They do not pay any fees at all—license fees,
“in-charge ” fees, or shipping office fees.
1061. l)o these aboriginal boats work under any form of agreement by which they share the proceeds ?
No, except when they are paying for the boats.
1662. When a boat has been paid for, to whom does it then belong ? It is vested in the Protector as
trustee for the natives.
1663. Have you found that when the boats have been paid for the natives continue to work as readily as
they did before? No. It is very hard to get them to work.
1664. As soon as they get clear of debt they seem to think they can sit down and do nothing more ?
Yes.
1665. By Mr. Bennett : Are you Protector of Aboriginals ? Yes.
1666. By Mr. Douglas: Then when the boats are paid for the tendency is for the natives to lead a life of
laziness— they can go out and fish when they like, and it does not matter whether they get shell or not ?
They take things very easily. When the debt is paid off, the incentive to work is gone.
1667. Are there many Torres Strait natives engaged on the shelling-boats? There are none on the pump
boats.
1668. Do any of them engage on the vessels which are licensed for swimming pearl-shell fishing or beche-
de-mer fishing? Yes. Sixteen of them have got “in-charge” licenses at the present time. There were
forty last year.
1669. Can you give the number of men engaged on boats that are licensed who are practically working
for wages ? I can get that information for you. I have it here up to 31st December last, but I have no
return for this year. [ Vide Appendix YIL]
1670. Are the fifteen boats vested in you as Protector of Aboriginals clear of debt ? I think there are
four still in debt. The others are clear.
1671. When they are clear of debt, I suppose your duties in connection with them cease to some extent
—You cannot compel the aboriginals to work when they do not want to ? Where they have paid for the
boat and have not been working, and have incurred a store debt which I have had to guarantee, I have
told them that if they did not work I would have to take the boat away. I find that I have to give them
as much direction as when they are in debt to the Department.
1672. Do you think it is more to the advantage of the natives to work these boats and own them them-
selves than to work for employers—Do they make a better living for themselves ? There is something to
be said on both sides. When food is scarce on an island, a native, with his own boat, can get turtle, and
can move to other islands. Then idleness causes many of them to get into debt with the storekeepers,
and no provision has been made for depreciation. When they were paying for the boats no money was
set aside to provide for sails or anything else, and they are worse off now than when they started.
1673. So that, sooner or later, those vessels will become of very little value ? Yes.
1674. Unless they earn sufficient money to keep them in good repair ? Quite so.
1675. If the natives were working for wages, what wages would they get ? I think Torres Strait
Islanders are worth £2 a month. Of course they have very inflated ideas of their own value.
1676. Then they get their tucker in addition to that—Are they supplied with tobacco as well ? Some
employers supply them with tobacco, but others charge it to the slop chest.
1677. Could a native working in one of the boats owned by the natives earn as much as £24 a year clear ?
I do not think so.
1678. So that it would appear to be more advantageous for the natives to engage as employees instead of
endeavouring to become owners of boats ? I think it would be to the advantage of the natives to do a
little of each. The boat system should not be abolished ; but, as Protector, I would resist any extension
of the system. The Papuan Industries, Limited, said they were working under concessions, and I
stopped them.
1679. The Papuan Industries, Limited, are a company carrying on operations in the Strait ? Yes,
at Badu.

MINUTES OP EVIDENCE TAKEN BEPOEE THE PE All I.- SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAL COMMISSION.


IGBO. Have they many boats employed ? They have fifteen.
1681. Do they pay a license fee under the Act P They have paid license fees for the boats.
1082. Do they sign their men on in the usual way? No; they said they had concessions, and on
looking at the precedent of last year I found that their statement was fairly correct, and that they were
not obliged to sign on their crews. lam not sure about the “ in-charge ” licenses ; but it appears that
they did not have any “ in-charge ” licenses last year.
1088. Are you aware of the nature of the concessions that they received ? No.
1084. By Mr. Bennett: Is there any record of them? No. I waited some time to get as much
information as I could, extending over six months. They submitted their books for my inspection to
show how they were dealing with the natives ; and I quite believe the natives get the bettor of them.
1085. By Mr. Douglas : But you have received no official notification that they actually did receive any
concessions ? The office should have received official notification.
1080. They were working in Torres Strait before you took up the duties of Shipping Master ? Tes.
1087. There are no official records as to any concessions having been granted to the company ? No.
When I was quite clear upon that point, I instructed them to pay license fees for the boats and for the
person in charge of each boat; and they explained that they were selling a number of their boats to the
natives. They put that forward as a reason for not paying for licenses, but I got license fees for those
also. Just lately I have requested them to take out articles, and to sign on the crews for all the boats
that are clearly the property of the company. Mr. Walker, the manager, pointed out that this would by
a hardship, and spoke again about the concessions said to have been granted; but I did not alter me
mind. At that time he had one of the boats with a crew signed on, and only the day the Commission
arrived nine more natives were sent in to be signed on. Mr. Walker said he would lay up the boats
rather than sign on the men. I think he has laid up five of them.
1088. Do you see any reason why any company should be given preference over another in regard to the
payment of license fees ? No; that is my reason for acting as I have done with the Papuan Industries,
Limited.
1089. Do you think natives of the soil are entitled to any special consideration ? Yes. I think they are
deserving of some consideration; but it is not the natives in this case—it is the Papuan Industries,
Limited.
1090. What are they—a trading company ? A trading company. They say their dividends are to be
limited to 5 per cent.
1091. Do you know whether they are under the control of the London Missionary Society ? Ido not
know. The Papuan Industries, Limited, is a limited liability company registered in Quaensland, but they
have their headquarters in Birmingham.
1092. By the Chairman : Have you ever heard who are the shareholders in the company ? Mr. Cadbury,
Lever Brothers, and other influential men with plenty of money.
1093. By Mr. Douglas : They are a wealthy company ? Tes.
1094. Their object here is particularly to benefit the natives ? Tes ; they have philanthropic views.
1095. They are not running a large business here on business lines with a view to making as much money
as they can ? No..
1096. Their object is to assist the natives of Papua and the islands generally ? Tes, that is so.
1097. Do you issue permits to engage aboriginals under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mor Fishery Act ?
I issue permits under the Aboriginals Protection Act.
1098. To engage on pearling vessels ? Tes, to engage in the pearling industry.
1G99. Can any man, whether an alien, a European, or of any other nationality, obtain a permit ? The Act
says that anybody except a Chinaman can employ an aboriginal.
1700. Are there a larger number of vessels this year as compared with last year employing aboriginals
in beche-de-mer fishing ? Ido not know. I would have to look that up.
1701. That information is not in the return you have furnished to the Commission ? No.
1702. By Mr. Bennett: Will you advise us what number of mainland aboriginals are employed in beche-
de-mer vessels ? Yes. [Vide Appendix 17//.].I 7 //.].
1703. By Mr. Douglas: In order to obtain a permit to employ natives in pearling boats a man must be
of good character ? Tes.
1704. Are there many eases in which it is necessary to refuse a permit? There have been some
instances where there have been convictions against the applicants.
1705. Where their past records were not good ? Where their past records were not good, and they had
had improper dealings with the natives. The owner of a boat generally asks for a permit for his employee,
and the employee is in every case an alien. The application is made in such a way that it is the owner
you have to deal with. The man who actually employs the aboriginal you scarcely see at all.
1706. There are a good number of Japanese engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? Yes.
1707. By Mr. Bennett: Then you issue the permits to the employers? Yes, to the employers in favour
of the men they employ.
1708. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea of the wages paid to Japanese in the beche-de-mer industry?
They are generally paid on the “ lay ” —so much per ton of fish, teat or black.
1709. That is the pay on the articles ? Tes. Sometimes they have a private agreement under which a
man is signed on at Is. per month.
1710. By Mr. Bennett: Avq the private agreements produced to you ? No.
1711. Then how do you manage about stamp duty? We charge them 2s. Od. stamp duty on everything.
1712. Are you aware that it is quite within your province to require the production of those private
agreements ? Tes.
1713. Apart from the question of the payment of stamp duty ? Tes.
1714. By Mr. Douglas: Are there many persons besides Japanese employed as persons in charge by
owners of vessels in the beche-de-mer fishery ? Fifteen Japanese have got licenses at the present time.
1715. Any Europeans? Six Europeans, nineteen Manila men, sixteen Torres Strait Islanders. Of
course some of those may be employed on turtle-shelling boats.
1716. It would appear from the return you have prepared that there are about sixty-eight persons in
charge of vessels engaged in beche-de-mer and turtle shelling ? Tes.
1717. And swimming diving ? Yes. They may get pearl-shell too.

MINDIES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOEE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAD COMMISSION.


J. M. Costin.
10 June, 1908.
n-1718. There is no record kept of the number of vessels which combine the business of beche-de-mer fishing
■\ and turtle-shelling ? No. The small boats have a pot on shore, and get turtle or beche-de-mer just as
8. the weather suits.
1719. What number of natives are employed on a vessel of 15 tons ? They would often like to employ
more than they can get. The supply limits the number they employ.
1720. Is there a scarcity of aboriginal labour? Yes, of mainland aboriginals.
1721. Do the aboriginals show any preference for engaging with aliens ? They always show a preference
for the alien in everything.
1722. And particularly for the Japanese ? No.
1723. Do the aliens treat them better ? Ido not know what passes between them.
1724. Have Europeans any difficulty in obtaining a supply of aboriginal labour for working on bsche-de-
mer vessels ? Yes.
1725. It is proposed to establish an aboriginal station on the east coast, is it not? Yes, at Lloyd’s Bay,
and I have recommended that all permits to recruit be cancelled and that no further permits be issued.
It will be official recruiting, and people will apply for labour at the station or at Thursday Island.
1726. Are many natives recruited from the east coast ? Yes, most of the recruiting is done on the east
coast.
1727. Are many natives recruited from Mapoon ? North of Mapoon and the Jardine Eiver.
1728. No recruiting south of Mapoon ? No; that is a reserve.
1729. Have they to get their permits from you ? Yes.
1730. Will permits be issued at the station which it is proposed to establish on the east coast or at
Thursday Island ? The aboriginals will be collected at the station.
1731. Is it proposed to allow them to be engaged there for work on the vessels? That could not be
done without a shipping office.
1732. Then a man would require to bring the boys recruited from that station to Thursday Island or
Cooktown in order to engage them ? Yes, while the law stands as it is at present.
1733. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think it is advisable to make an alteration in the law providing for a
Shipping Office there? Ido not think that would be justified.
1734. By Mr. Douglas : \V ould it be advisable to give the person in charge of that station power to grant
permission to utilise the services of the natives until the persons recruiting them can conveniently return
to Thursday Island, seeing the great distance they would have to travel—provided, of course, that a
reliable'offieer was placed in charge of the station ? Yes ; that might be tried.
1735. Do you think the employers are put to much inconvenience in having to bring their vessels a couple
of hundred miles and then go back to the working grounds ? Where that objection has been stated I
have tried to help them all I could, and have given them a permit to recruit and to sign on at Cooktown.
1736. 1 hat would be in cases where vessels were going out to the Barrier Beef, south of Cooktown, to
work ? Yes. The Aboriginals Department is satisfied when they get the men on the articles, and know
where the owners of the boats are.
1737. Is it part of your business to see whether a vessel engaged in the beche-de-mer, pearl-shell, or
turtle-shelling industry is duly licensed? Yes ; I think it is.
1738. And that the man in charge is licensed? Yes, I have tried to do so, but I have met with
difficulties. I have not known where men are, owing to the licenses being issued by another office. The
officer in the Shipping Office is a mere automaton, simply signing on and discharging the crew.
1739. By Mr. Bennett : You stated that aboriginals will be collected at the recruiting station on the east
coast which you have recommended—Who will collect them ? The superintendent. The natives will go
in, to a certain extent, voluntarily. The natives visit all those reserves and stay for a month, or a longer
or shorter period, and then walk away again. Baramba, in the South, is a home for the natives, where
they come and go.
1740. What I want to get at is this : Are the aboriginals to be brought into the station by anybody ?
There was a proposal that an official recruiter should be employed, so as to avoid abuses such as have
occurred in the past —abuses with regard to rum and other things which are carried to aboriginal camps;
but the matter is not yet definitely settled.
1741. There are no labourers recruited from any mission station now ? No ; not legally.
1742. You grant permits to men to recruit natives and you see them shipped, do you not? Yes.
1743. Do you take any steps to see that the natives are returned to the place, where they were engaged ?
Yea ; it is stated on the articles that it is a condition of the agreement that the native must be returned
at the termination of his agreement to the place from which he was recruited.
1744. By ihe owner? Yes.
1745. Or at his expense ? Yes ; that is a provision in the articles.
1746. By Mr. Douglas-. The whole of the wages of aboriginals employed on vessels engaged in the pearling
industry have to be paid through you, as Protector? Yes.
1747. And you supervise the expenditure of their money at the various stores ? Yes.
1748. Do the natives show any preference for buying from the Chinese storekeepers ? Yes.
1749. They much prefer to do so ? Yes.
1750. Do they get as good value from Chinese storekeepers as from Europeans? Yes; while lam
present they do. When I came here I found that Chinese were giving the natives a lot of goods on
credit.
1751. By Mr. Bennett \ Mainland natives? No ; island natives.
1752. By Mr. Douglas : I was referring to mainland natives —They do not get any credit, do they ? No.
1753. But the Torres Strait islanders get credit at Chinese stores ? Yes.
1754. You do not supervise the expenditure of their money, do you ? A portion of it I do. The system
has been altered. When a Torres Strait native is discharged atthe Shipping Office, at least half his wages
have to be paid over to the Shipping Master, so as to curtail the slop chest system.
1755. The Torres Strait islanders are an intelligent set of men ? Yes.
1756. A number of them can read and write ? Yes. They have about £4OO to their credit in the
Savings Bank. When the half of their wages is paid over to the Shipping Master, they are asked how
much money they want in cash, how much they want to put in the bank, and how much they want to
spend in the store.
62
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND DKCHE-DE-MEH EOTAL COMMISSION.


1757. Do they show a general desire to put any of their wages in the Savings Bank? There have been
three or four cases where they have added to their deposits on their own account, but they are scarcely worth
speaking about.
1758. Are any of them at all thrifty naturally ? No ; they save nothing.
1759. Then their accumulated savings of £4OO are probably greatly due to the advice which has been
given them by you ? Yes. I give them a receipt upon a card, and tell them that I have made an
arrangement with the Papuan Industries, Limited, stores, that when they present that card, they can
get goods to the value of one-quarter of the amount to their credit, and that in another month they can
go and get goods to the value of another quarter, so that when the “ hard-up time” comes on their
island, as they put it, they will have some money at their disposal, and they can get goods from the stores
at Darnley and Badu.
17G0. By Mr. Bennett-. And on presenting the card to you, you withdraw the necessary amount ? Yes.
The Papuan Industries, Limited, send in an account to me.
1701. By Mr. Douglas: In the event of any native dying, what becomes of the amount of money stand-
ing to his credit in the Savings Bank ? There is a fund under the Chief Protector called “ The
Aboriginals Protection Account,” and the money is put into that fund, and is used for the benefit of
aboriginals generally. From that fund the money w r as withdrawn to buy these boats on loan.
1762. The money which was accumulated by deceased natives? Deceased and deserting natives.
1768. By Mr. Bennett: Deceased Torres Strait Islanders? Yes.
1764. By Mr. Douglas : Do the natives fall in readily with the idea of putting any of their money into
the Savings Bank ? In some cases they hesitate.
1765. Do they regard it as in any way an official desire that they should put their money into the bank ?
They know that I wish it, and that 1 look upon it as the right thing for them to do.
1766. The average native likes to spend his money as readily as he can ? He wants to spend it all the
first day he gets it, then loaf about for a few days, and then possibly sign on with somebody else, or get
back to his island.
1767. Are they permitted to draw any of the money which they have deposited, if they wish ? Yes. The
Government have provided me with a sum of £lO, which I keep on hand ; and, if a native applies for
any of his money, I can give it to him straight away, and get a witnessed receipt from him.
1768. Of course a native need not put his money into the Savings Bank unless he wishes —There is no
compulsion about it ? No.
1769. By Mr. Bennett: Many of the Torres Strait islanders have known relatives —ln the event of one of
them dying, would not the money to his credit be paid to his relatives ? Certainly.
1770. I suppose you have learned something of the Torres Strait natives even during the time you have
been here ? I think I have.
1771. They have more intelligence in certain directions than the mainland aboriginals? That is the
general opinion.
1772. But in certain directions, such as the spending of money, I suppose you are aware that the Torres
Strait islander requires just as much protection as the “ Binghi ”of the mainland? Quite as much,
especially when he shows such a strong inclination to deal with the Chinese. If he went to the white
man’s store, I would leave him alone; but when he goes to the Chinese I feel that he requires protection.
1773. He is like a child in what he buys, and what he wants to buy—lF a thing strikes his fancy he wants
to buy it, whether it is useful or not? Yes; and it takes a lot of trouble to get him to change his
mind.
1774. By Mr. Douglas: The New Guinea natives are not signed on in the Shipping Office? They are
not signed on on the articles. Before a Queensland native can be employed, 4s. 6d. has to be paid to the
revenue.
1775. By Mr. Bennett: The New Guinea natives are not on your articles, you mean ? Ido not think
they are on articles at all.
1776. By Mr. Douglas : In engaging aboriginals, no stamp duty is paid, is there ? Yes.
1777. On engagements where the wages are less than 10s. a month ? 10s. is the minimum.
1778. There is no stamp duty paid in those cases? Yes; the Deputy Commissioner for Stamps ruled
that the essence of the agreement was 10s. a month, food, and clothes.
1779. So that in all cases they pay 2s. 6d. for stamp duty in addition to the engagement fee of 2s. ? Yes.
1780. That is a comparatively recent regulation ? Yes ; it is about twelve months old.
1781. By the Chairman: A New Guinea crew on a boat coming here is shipped in accordance with the
laws of New Guinea? The New Guinea agreement is under “The Native Labour Ordinances of New
Guinea”; but section 12 of our Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act of 1888, 51 Vic., says that no
aboriginal native of Australia, New Guinea, or of any of the islands adjacent thereto shall be employed
or carried on board of any boat or ship engaged in Australian waters unless he is carried on the ship’s
articles. That is something which I cannot quite understand.
1782. You cannot interfere with a boat coming here, belonging to New Guinea, with a New Guinea crew
on board ? Yes, if they engage in our fisheries.
1783. But you cannot do that, as they are subject to the Ordinances you have just referred to ? The
New Guinea Ordinances seem to override our Act. We lose revenue, and yet those boats are fishing in
Queensland waters. .
1784. Ido not suppose boats owned,in New Guinea often come here ? New Guinea natives are at work
on the 112 boats engaged in our fisheries.
1785. But IheNew Guinea men must be considered as seamen —A foreigner engaged on a British ship is
a British subject while he is on board ? lam under the impression that, if an order was given that they
were to be signed on to the articles, nobody on Thursday Island would dispute it. New Guinea natives
come over regularly under agreements. They are not required to sign on the articles, while indented
labourers from Japan have to be put on the articles. The boat is licensed in Queensland, and worked
here, and the crew come from New Guinea. . .
1786. By Mr. Bennett: The owner sends for the crew ? sometimes recruiters bring them here.
1787. When I was here vessels had to take articles in New Guinea? I am not aware that they are on
any articles at all They are working in Queensland waters, but they are not on articles signed in a
Queensland port. The revenue lost in this way is approximately £lOO per annum.

!. 1788. Is it your opinion that, in addition to being signed on here, they should be discharged and paid
here ? Ido not care where they are paid off.
3 1789. Under the agreement you have referred to they have to be paid off in New Guinea, have they not ?
The employers sign a bond to return them to Daru, or pay a penalty of £lOO.
1790. Have they not to be paid in the presence of a New Guinea official ? Ido not know.
1791. Is that not set out in the agreement ? No.
1792. Is that all you wish to say ? There is the matter of food inspection. Messrs. Bowden and
Mackenzie submit their tucker list for inspection, to enable me to ascertain whether lime juice and other
anti-scorbutics have been provided ; but the owners of the other fleets have not done so.
1793. By the Chairman : The Marine Board gave instructions that all boats should be provided with such
things ? When I came here there was only the one firm - of owners who seemed to wish it to be done.
The others did not seem to know of it.
1794. By Mr. Douglas: Is it advisable to have the food inspected ? For New Guinea natives, I think
it is. Native food should be put on the boats.
1795. Is there no sago carried from New Guinea now? No; they find it will not keep. Another
matter I wish to bring before the Commission is that of occupation licenses. The Government charge
£5 for a license to occupy land for the purpose of the fishery, and, as far as I know, the boat slip-
owners do not pay anything to the Government, though the ground is being used for the purposes of the
fishery.
1796. Is there anything else you wish to bring before the Commission ? There is a matter in connection
with the sale of beche-de-mer. The only market for it at the present time is China. There are about
three buyers hereof beche-de-mer, and the industry is really at the beck and call of the Chinese. I think
the Government should assist the industry in the way of finding another market for beche-de-mer.
1797. You have a considerable amount of beche-de-mer passing through your hands? Yes, a fair
quantity. A number of the natives are working beche-de-mer boats.
1798. And you find you have to take whatever price the Chinese choose to give you for the fish ? That
is so.
1799. Do you think there is a ring among the Chinese to keep the price down in order to benefit
themselves P I think so.
2 800. Can you suggest any method by which the Government can do anything to assist in the disposal of
the fish ? No.
1801. The Government had a commercial agent in the East ? I believe he was approached on the matter,
but the result was not encouraging.
1802. The Chinese practically control the consumption of beche-de-mer? Yes.
1803. Then, even if the commercial agent in Hong Kong had the fish sent to him by the Government, he
would have to take what price the Chinese gave there ? Yes.
1804. So that that would not overcome the difficulty of dealing with Chinese business firms ? No, it
would not.
1805. Does the market fluctuate a great deal ? The price has gone down a great deal lately, especially
for the poorer qualities of fish, on which the natives are dependent; and they feel it very much.
1806. Is there any special reason for the price going down ? The Chinese state that there is a large
supply of fish at Hong Kong.
1807. Has the price been high ? Yes ; for the poorer qualities of fish they used to get £25 a ton and
more, and the price is now £l4 and £lB.
1808. For what class of fish ? For sand fish, which is a very inferior quality.
1809. There are large quantities of sandfish obtained from other parts of the world ? I suppose there
are, but Ido not know. It would be a matter for a scientist to say whether it is possible to manufacture
beche-de-mer extract.
1810. Do the Chinese show an eagerness to buy supplies of beche-de-mer? No; they take a lot,of
pressing.
1811. Do not the Chinese storekeepers finance, or lend money, to people—-Japanese, and other aliens—
engaged in the industry, and give them long credit ? Yes. In one case the credit was for so long a
period that the boat is now in reality the property of the Chinaman.
1812. By Mr. Bennett: Was that a Japanese boat ? No ; it was owned by a South Sea Islander.
1813. By Mr. Douglas : And it is now owned by a Chinaman ? It is virtually owned by See Kee.
1814. Has'he got a license ? The boat is laid up.
1815. Your duties as Shipping Master do not allow of your getting away from the Island ? I have been
to Mabuiag, Yama Island, and Mua.
1816. Have you any information from the natives as to the supply of fish on the reefs ? No.
1817. Has the supply decreased a lot ? The natives have told me that they used to pick it up on the
reefs, but that now they have to dive for it.
1818. Does that not indicate that there are too many boats engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? It
looks like it, unless there is some insect destroying the fish.
1819. The natives have reported that the reefs are not nearly so prolific as they used to be ? Yes.
1820. Who makes most money out of the beche-de-mer? The Japanese, and in some ways they deserve
to do so, because they cure the fish better.
1821. How many Europeans do you say are engaged in the beche-de-mer industry? Six, all of whom
have “in charge” licenses.
1822. Do you think the industry is one fit for Europeans to be engaged in as masters of their own boats,
but not to dive for the fish ? Only a certain class of men would engage in it, I think. It would not
suit everybody.
1823. If there was a plentiful supply of fish on the reefs, could not Europeans get as good hauls as other
persons ? Yes.
1824. But the reefs have been fished very extensively, and they have now to go further afield ? Yes.
They have been fishing down the coast.
1825. Do the natives you control go very far out? Not very far.
1826. They do not go on the Barrier Eecf ? No.
1827. By Mr. Bennett: Not the Murray Islanders ? I do not know. I have only had one Murray
Island boat in.

1828. Do the natives of Darnloy Island go the Barrier Keef ? Ido not know. ,
1829. By the Chairman : What is the piesent price for teat fish ? I cannot say.
1830. Is it £l5O a ton ? No.
1831. By Mr. Douglas-. What is a fair average price for red fish and teat fish? Local prices are £6O,
£BO, and £9O.
1832. For large fish? What we have been getting lately.
1833. But since you have been here the price has been higher than that? It was higher than that when
I came here, but it has gone down since then.
1834. By Mr. Bennett-. It was higher when the Chinese New Tear was on ? Yes.
1835. By Mr. Douglas: What was the price last November for large-sized teat fish and black fish? I
cannot say from memory.
1836. Are the vessels used by the natives small vessels ? Yes.
1837. About what tonnage ? Ten tons and under.
1838. Are there any over 10 tons? I think there is one of 12 tons.
1839. So that, by reason of the small tonnage of the boats, they are not able to go on to the Barrier Eeef ?
No.
1840. So that possibly the reason why the price is so low for the fish obtained by the vessels you are
controlling is that the fish is not of good quality ? Yes.
1841. Is it mostly small fish ? What I mean is that the pHce for the same kind of fish has gone down.
1842. By Mr. Bennett-. For all fish? No; for sand fish. When the natives started their boats they
got good prices for sand fish, but the prices have gone down since then. Another matter to which I wish
to draw the attention of the Commission is the license fee paid for schooners lying in the harbour.
Schooners, when lying in the harbour, are charged the same license fee as if they were out working, and
I do not think that is fair.
1843. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think a reduction should be made in the fee for a vessel lying in the
harbour ? Yes.
1844. What do you suggest in regard to that ? I only mention the matter because it appeared to me
anomalous that they should be charged a fee of £2O when they are in active work, and the same fee
when they are laid up.
1845. There is one vessel in the harbour, the “ Olive,” which has on board all the fittings and apparatus
for active service—lf she was not employed there the owners would require to provide some accommodation
on shore, for which they would have to pay rent and rates ? Yes.
1846. Still you think some reduction should be made in the fee charged when a vessel is in the harbour ?
Yes.
1847. By the Chairman : Do you think £2O a year an exorbitant fee for a store ship ? Not if she
answers the purposes of a store ship.
1848. Where a vessel is used as a storeship for pearl-shell and beche-de-mer awaiting shipment, do you
think it right to remit a portion of the license fee ? I would not remit it altogether.
1849. By Mr. Douglas: The maximum license fee is £2O a year, is it not? Yes.
1850 How many of those storeships are licensed? Only two—the “ Olive” and the “Tarawa.”
1851. By Mr. Bennett: Are those storeships used for receiving shell from the luggers? Yes.
1852. Is the shell packed on board the ships ? Yes.
1853. Do they house the men who are engaged in packing and dealing with the shell on board the ship ?
Some of them.
1854. Are there articles in which the names of those vessels are mentioned ? Yes, they have a fleet on
the articles.
1855. They are “ Olive” articles or “ Tarawa” articles, as the case may be ? Yes.
1856. And the men are signed on to work on board ? Yes, in some cases.
1857. They are signed on to work on the “ Olive” or “Tarawa,” if necessary ? Yes.
1858. So that to all intents and purposes they are pearling vessels ? Yes ; they are engaged in connec-
tion with the industry.
1859. By Mr. Douglas: But it would not be possible for them to be taken outside ? No.
1800. The “ Olive,” for instance, is not rigged ? No.
Feedeeick Ciiaei.es Hodel, Merchant, and Owner of Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer
Boats, examined :
1801. By the Chairman : What are you ? lam manager of Hodels, Limited.
1862. Merchants at Thursday Island? Yes ; lam also a large property-owner in the town.
1803. Are you engaged in the pearl-shell industry ? Yes.
1804. To what extent ? I have two pump boats at work.
1865. Have you any other vessels ? I have three other boats fishing for beche-de-mer. To be correct,
I have two now. I had three pump boats at the beginning of the year licensed in my name, but there
are only two actually at work. One of my beche-de-mer boats was lost off Mackay.
1800. How long have you been engaged in the industry ? For nearly ten years as a pearl-sheller.
1867. Have you been the owner of .boats during that time ? I have been connected with the firm.
1868. You have been connected with the industry for ten years ? I was indirectly connected with it
prior to that as honorary secretary to the White Divers’ Association. Altogether, I have been here
about twenty years.
1869. Has the industrv been carried on with any regard to its preservation? On one or two occasions
the Government have closed areas, but in name only. They have never been effectively closed.
1870. People employing divers have had no regard to the preservation of the industry by their system of
working ? Absolutely none. , o r> .. .. .
1871. How do you think the industry can be conserved ? By a limitation upon those working, in some
form or other. . , _
1872. Do you mean by the closure of a portion of the beds < There are many ways of doing it. The
closure of a portion of the beds would be a good thing if the areas could be effectively closed.
1873. What do you think is the best method of preserving the industry? I should say a limitation of
the number of boats or of the number of divers at work. I should limit the number of divers, because
that would also limit the number of boats.

F. 0. Hodel.
10 June, 1908.
1. 1874. To what extent would you limit them—Would you feel inclined to reduce the number—At present
there are 112 pump boats at work ? I certainly would not increase the number of licenses for a period of
)8. at least five years.
1875. Do you think the industry could be made attractive to white divers? It is quite possible to make
it sufficiently attractive for white divers.
1876. How could that be done ? If no fresh aliens were allowed to get divers’ licenses, white divers
would come int > the industry slowly and naturally; but in the meantime there would probably be a severe
strain upon those engaged in the industry.
1877. But it would be an injustice suddenly to wipe out alien divers—lt should be done by a gradual
process of evolution—Do you think white men could carry on the industry in the absence of alien
divers ? They could and would do the diving.
1878. You are of opinion that black labour is necessary for crews ? Yes ; you must have a form of
labour for crews for years to come that is very cheap.
1879. To attend to the divers ? No. The tenders ought to be white men, too.
1880. Do you think conditions on the vessels could be made congenial to white men? They could be
made congenial enough, but not profitable.
1881. How would you,suggest the industry should be made sufficiently remunerative for white men ? A
bonus might be granted upjn every ton of shell obtained by white divers.
1882. Do you think, if that were done, the industry could be made remunerative to white men ? A
bonus alone would not be sufficient. You would have to make it prohibitive for any more aliens to
come in.
1883. You would debar aliens from coming in ? Yes.
1884. Do you think that the present law might be altered in such a way as to induce white men to
engage in the industry ? Yes. I think you could gradually introduce white men, so that in a very few
years nearly all the divers would be white.
1885. You think that the existing conditions could be so altered as to enable the industry to be carried on
solely by white men ? It is a big contract to say “ solely by white men ”at this stage.
1886. I mean that the change should be made gradually—seas not to be unfair to the aliens? It
would not be possible to work the industry solely by white men at the present stage.
1887. And at the same time ensure the continuance of the industry ? Yes.
1888. If the conditions were made more favourable, you think a change could be made ? I feel certain
it could be done.
1889. And the industry carried on wholly by white men ? Eventually, as the white population increases;
but the island native is a factor to be considered.
1890. But as the coloured men pass out white men will come in ? Yes; but we have the black man with
us, and we must take him into account. We have a large number of island natives.
1891. By Mr. Bennett-. And of mainland natives, too ? They are not so good for swimming boats.
1892. By the Chairman : Do you think it is possible to depend upon the natives of New Guinea for the
crews ? They make very good crews, and they are available in numbers.
1893. Then you think that if the alien element is eliminated New Guinea will furnish all the crews
required ? Yes. We can depend upon Papua to supply labour sufficient for all our requirements.
1894. Has any attempt been made to cultivate the pearl-oyster? The only attempt I know of that can
be considered a genuine attempt is that made by Mr. Saville Kent.
1895. Where was that ? It is being carried on at Somerset at the present time.
1896. But before that? I think they were only attempts in name.
1897. Have you any idea of the measure of success that attended those previous experiments? Ido not
think there was any genuine attempt at cultivation at all. I think it was merely an attempt to remove the
small shell from one bed to another so that it might grow and be taken up ; but I do not think that
actual cultivation was ever attempted.
1898 AYhat is your opinion of calling in the aid of a biologist ? I think the Government were very
unwise in not keeping one when they had him fifteen years ago.
1899. You think it necessary that there should be a biologist ? I think a biologist should be appointed,
and a biological station formed at once.
1900. Do you think that such researches should be carried on by private enterprise or by the
Government? Unquestionably by the Government. The knowledge attained by private enterprise is
only in the hands of the individual.
1901. Were you here when Mr. Tosh was on the island ? Yes.
li)02. He took some preliminary steps with that cud in view, did he not ? I believe so, until he was
recalled to Brisbane. It went so far that tenders were called for the establishment of a biological
station, but no tender was accepted.
1903. You think that the services of a biologist would result in the development of the industry ? They
would throw a considerable amount of light upon the propagation of the oyster from the period of
spatting until it could be handled economically and successfully, like the edible oyster.
1904. Do you know Mr. Tosh’s opinion of the success or otherwise of his experiments? Only from his
reports.
1905. On what basis do you suggest licenses should be issued, so that no person should be unduly
favoured, and so that no monopoly should be created ? We are justified in creating a monopoly for our
own people—that is, the white race. I would give no more licenses to aliens of any nationality. I would
renew only those licenses which now exist.
1906. You are in favour of granting no renewals of licenses to aliens other than renewals of licenses now
existing ? Oh, yes, I would grant renewals. It would be repudiation not to grant renewals. But I
would not grant licenses to other aliens.
1907. What do you think would be the result of a periodical closure of beds? I do not think the
Government would go to the expense of closing them properly. A boat might anchor in a closed area,
and it would be a very difficult thing to prove diving.
1908. That difficulty might be removed by an alteration in the law, making it criminal to poach on closed
areas—at present you cannot hold a man guilty unless he is caught in the act of diving; but supposing
the law was amended in the direction of providing that it should be illegal for any person to be on the

ground with a boat, crew, pump, and other equipment, would not that have a good effect? It would not
have the effect of securing the industry for our own race.
1900. But it would prevent that area from being fished ? It would only conserve the area while it was ]
closed. As soon as it was reopened, the boats would swoop down upon it in a body, and in a very short
time they would Clean it out again.
1910. What would the patrolling boat be doing in the meantime ? Ido not think you would ever get a
patrolling boat to protect it completely. I think there would be no occasion to close any area if you
limited the number of licenses; because that of itself would restrict the number of boats employed.
1911. Then you do not consider it necessary to close any areas? I do not.
1912. What, in your opinion, would be the best means of enforcing closure ? A good fearless officer.
1913. What do you think should be the maximum "size of exportable shell ? Six inches.
1914. Do you think the present limit should be altered ? I fear that, even if you did alter it, divers
would ride through the regulation. Ido not think any limitation as to the size of shell will be effective,
because smaller shell will be picked up, opened, and thrown overboard.
1915. By Mr. Bennett : Then you do not consider there should be any limit fixed ? I would remove
the limit altogether. I certainly would not alter the present limit.
1916. By Mr. Douglas : What are your reasons for suggesting a reversion to the 6-inch limit ? Ido
not suggest that. I say make the limit 6 inches if you are going to fix a limit, but I do not think any
limit is necessary. *
1917. By the Chairman : Then they would destroy the beds ? They destroy the beds now. If they pick
up a shell and find there is nothing in it, the shell goes overboard.
1918. By Mr. Douglas : Do they open shell under 5 inches ? Yes ; and they are thrown overboard.
1919. Do you think they pick up shell 3 inches or 4 inches in diameter? If they see such shell, I feel
certain they will pick it up ; but small shell is not easily detected on the bottom.
1920. Would they pick it up on the chance of getting pearls ? Yes.
1921. Are shells of that size prolific in regard to pearls? No, but a man will open a shell of almost
any size in the hope of obtaining a pearl worth a few hundred pounds. One pearl was lately obtained in
a shell barely past the limit, and it brought a very high price.
1922. Do you think that valuable pearls are obtained in small shell ? I think the best pearls are
obtained in shell of from 5 to 7 inches, which is, I believe, the maximum size for shell containing pearls of
good quality. After a certain age the pearl-shell Joses its lustre.
1923. By Mr. Bennett: And the pearl shares in that loss of lustre ? Yes.
1924. By the Chairman: Then the inspection of shell here is useless as regards the prevention of the
taking of small shell?. It is not exactly useless, but it is almost useless. In saying that 1 am not
speaking against the officials in any way, because the boats are not bringing in the small shell. They
bring in a certain proportion. Every time I get a certain proportion of shell which is not fit to export.
1925. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think divers pick up 3-inch or 4-inch shell ? I think they pick up 4-ineh
she!!.
1926. At the present time ? Yes ; I had some shell brought into my store last month which did not go
more than 4-j inches.
1927. By the Chairman : Of course that would not pass inspection? No.
1928. By Mr. Douglas: You have no doubt read what Mr. Saville Kent said in his report on the
question of size limit ? Yes.
1929. Do you remember the limit he suggested ? Yes ; it was 6 inches, if I remember correctly.
1930. Was Mr. Tosh in favour of a size limit ? I think Mr. Tosh recommended a 6-inch limit, but I
would not be certain.
1931. Mr. Saville Kent was originally of opinion that 7 inches should be the limit ? That was 7 inches
over all. Mr. Saville Kent suggested hoop measurement of the shell, as that could be made without
destroying the life of the fish.
1932. Is there any difference between the weight of a 5-inch and a 6-inch shell ? It depends upon what
ground the shell comes from.
1933. What do you consider is the difference between the weight of 5-inch and 6-inch ordinary
Old Ground shell ? I have not gone into that question sufficiently to give an opinion upon it.
1934. By the Chairman : Should any restriction bo placed on the size of vessels employed in the pearl-
shell industry ? I think no vessel over 25 tons should bo allowed to be employed in the industry.
1935. What is your opinion as to the effect of a floating station working with and controlling fleets of
diving vessels ? My feeling about the floating stations is that with such a station boats are in the happy
position that when "they have cleared a ground out they can go elsewhere, and that does not tend to
create permanency.
1936. Is the floating station beneficial to the industry or otherwise ? It depends entirely upon the diver
and the system you work under. At the present time floating stations are considered a disadvantage,
and they are abandoning the schooners and leaving them in the harbour, because the divers are allowed
the pearls.
1937. Do you assign that as a reason? One reason. Again, the divers are working on a system of
“ lay,” and it is not material whether you have a system of supervision of divers outside, as with present-
day boats you can get to the fishing grounds in reasonably quick time. The time divers lose is when the
water is dirty. I have had a man come in at uight and go out again at 8 o’clock the next morning. There
was clear water, and he went out straight away.
1938. By Mr. Douglas : Were you here when the floating-station system was originally adopted? Yes.
1939. How long ago was that ? 1892, I think.
1940. Was that after the return of Clark and Company’s fleet from Western Australia? They
introduced it. Mr. Smith was the first to adopt that system on the Thursday Island grounds. I came
here short!v after Clark and Company went to Western Australia the first time.
1941. What was the condition of the pearling beds at that lime ? They certainly contained a very much
greater supply of shtdl than they do now. _ .
1942. Did Clark and Company depart at that tune on account ot the serious falling oft in the catch of
shell ? I presume they departed because they thought they could do better elsewhere, but I would not
like to give an opinion on the subject.

1943. Was there any restriction on labour at that time ? There was no restriction on labour at that
i time ; there was plenty of labour, and no Federal Immigration Restriction Act.
. 1944. What do you think of a system of large floating stations ? It would be a more economical system
of management when you have the men on wages only.
1945. The men would obtain a greater quantity of shell under that system ? Yes, and the owners would
obtain the pearls.
1946. By Mr. Bennett: They would get more shell ? It all depends upon the area you work. If you
worked Cook Reef you would probably get more shell, but if you worked off the Island you would not
get more shell.
1947. The floating-station system is more profitable to the owners than the shore-station system ? Yes.
1948. But under that system there would be a tendency to overfish the grounds ? Certainly.
1949. Do you think the use of that system has anything to do with the present condition of the Old
Ground beds? It has something to do with it, where the floating station worked laterally —say 70 miles
west of the meridian of Torres Strait. The shore boats, as a rule, do not go out so far. They do
sometimes, but not as a rule.
1950. Prior to the recent exodus of a fleet from Torres Strait, was it considered that the beds had been
partially exhausted or overfished ? It was considered that they had been overfished.
1951. Was that attributable to the floating-station system ? Not to the floating-station system particu-
larly, but to the fact that there were too many boats engaged in the industry. As far as Torres
Strait proper was concerned, the use of a floating station was not material.
1952. But in the Arafura Sea it was material ? Yes. But Ido not think the spat from the Arafura Sea
approaches Torres Strait, because the current there is only about 2 miles an hour.
1953. By Mr. Douglas: What particular reason have you for advocating that the tonnage of boats
should not exceed 25 tons ? Because you can then restrict the boats to your base on the islands, and if
men work on the islands they, as a rule, bring about a certain amount of settlement.
1954. You say the floating stations went further afield than the shore boats ? Yes.
1955. And that they tend to denude the beds more than shore boats ? Not the inshore beds, but they
denude the beds outside.
1956. If they do not denude the beds near the shore, why place restrictions on boats working in waters
that shore boats cannot get to ? Because, when the grounds are worked under the floating-station
system, no settlement follows in the wake of the workers, and the islands of the Strait should bo dotted
with settlement. Most of the islands, like Mabuiag and Yama, should be centres for pearling boats from
Thursday Island.
1957. You think that a limitation of 25 tons would prevent the industry being carried on by floating
stations ? Yes.
1958. With a vessel of 25 tons, would it not be possible to work a fleet and keep the boats out at sea ?
Not with a boat of that size, according to Queensland measurement. A 15-tou boat, New South Wales
measurement, would be 17 tons according to our measurements here, unless they have introduced some
new system of measurement in New South Wales.
1959. What has been the average tonnage of the floating stations that have been here in the past? I
suppose they would average from 100 to 140 tons, but I would not like to say just off-hand.
1960. By the Chairman : The old “ Sketty Belle ” was 170 tons register ? I think the average was from
110 to 140 tons.
1961. In the interests of the permanency of the beds, do you think it is desirable to have five or six boats,
working in a bunch from a schooner of even 25 tons, remaining on the grounds without having to go into
port for small repairs or provisions ? No. Establish the system of small ownership in connection with
the pearl-shell industry in the same way as has been done in connection with agricultural settlement. I
would not allow a man to own more than three or four boats, and I would not allow any company to work
with a large nmmber of boats. That would compel small ownership. You have so many islands from
which the boats could be worked.
1962. Would it be possible to limit the number of licensed boats belonging to any particular man? It
is just a question of what the Government say shall be done.
1963. But the companies which at present work fifteen and twenty boats do not consist of one man —
there are several members in the companies ? Of course, any remarks I make do not apply to the
present conditions. There should be no repudiation. Present owners should be allowed to remain iu
the industry for all time if they desire.
1964. What would there be to prevent four men obtaining licenses for four boats each, under the system
you suggest, and working them as a fleet of sixteen boats ? There would still be four owners. At the
present time there are only about six owners for the whole industry.
1965. In the case I suggest the owners need not reside here ? No, but all the same they could be split
up in the ownership, and it would help materially to break up the large fleets.
1966. Do you think it could be done ? lam certain it could.
1967. Would it not be likely to lead to a system of dummying ? There would be a certain amount of
dummying, just like dummying on the land, which would not be easily handled. It would bo like the
dummying of the Japanese at the present time.
1968. What minimum size for pump boats would you recommend, having regard to the efficient working
of the industry and the comfort of the diver and crew ? Fourteen or 15 tons —say 15 tons.
1969. Do you not think the present accommodation is susceptible of improvement ? The accommodation
on the recently built boats is fairly good. It is certainly susceptible of improvement, but Ido not think
there is much to complain of—very little, at any rate.
1970. By Mr. Douglas: It would be hardly possible to say that no vessel should be licensed for pump-
diving of a less tonnage than 15 tons ? It would be quite possible.
1971. You have to bear in mind that the larger the tonnage the greater the draught ? But 15 tons does
not give you too big a draught. Besides they like a deep boat for drifting to windward.
1972. Would it be possible to work grounds inshore successfully with a vessel of 15 tons? Yes.
1973. Was it found so in the early days of pearl-shelling ? The conditions then were entirely different.
All the boats were 10-tonners of an obsolete type.
1974. But the size was gradually raised to 17 tons and 20 tons? Boats of 15 tons, 16 tons, and 17 tons
lyork close into the reefs all round.


1975. By Mr. Bennett: What would bo their draught? Seven feet. The swimming diver is always
after you, and he takes anything that the pump boat leaves in the shallow waters.
1976. By Mr. Douglas : You do not think sufficient comfort could be obtained for a European diver,;
tender, and the ordinary crew in a vessel of 10 tons ? No ; unless the boat is going to work close to
some island the whole time, and the men can get frequent runs ashore, and probably some of them may
sleep ashore. Under other circumstances the men would be too cramped on a 10-ton boat.
1977. By Mr Bennett : That is for the usual crew of six men all told ? Tea.
1978. By the Chairman : Can you tell us the rate per ton of shell raised now paid to coloured divers ?
They work on the “lay” system, varying up to £B7 per ton. Under present conditions the diver pays
all the expenses of the crew, the provisioning of the boat, and certain other things.
1979. What do you think are the average annual earnings of a diver p lam inclined to think that, with
the pearls, the earnings of the divers will average over £2OO a year; but the pearls are an uncertain
quantity.
1980. By Mr. Douglas : You have some vessels working on that system yourself? Yes.
1981. That is approximately what they earn with you? The difficulty is to ascertain the value of the
pearls. We do not see the pearls,
1982. By the Chairman :Do you include the pearls in the £2OO ? Yes. A good diver will earn from
£125 to £l5O a year, according to the season, without the pearls. He will get 5 tons of shell, and
his share of that is, roughly, £25 per ton.
1983. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think they will not earn more than £125 a year ? It depends upon what
the diver pays the crew.
1983 a. By the Chairman : What was the average payment of divers before the adoption of the present
system ? £25 a ton.
1984. Was the industry profitable to owners under these conditions ? AVhen the price of shell was high
it was ; but when shell was low —like in 1894 or 1895, when it was worth only £lOO a ton in Thursday
Island—it was not profitable. When the industry collapsed for white divers, shell was down lower than it
is now.
1985. By Mr. Douglas : What do you think is the total value per annum of the pearls obtained ? A
few years ago, before the slump in pearls took place, I think the value of the pearls was very nearly
£50,000 per annum.
1986. How many boats would that amount be distributed over ? There must have been nearly 200 boats,
I should think.
1987. That would mean an average of £250 per boat ? The pearls are not nearly so valuable now.
1988. The price of pearls may be exceptionally low at the present time ? I base my figures on the fact that
one insurance company insured pearls to the value of £20,000 for one year.
1989. That gives you an average of £250 per boat for 200 boats, so that your estimate of £2OO,
including pearls, is surely a low one ? As far as I can gather, there is no sale for pearls now.
1990. But surely the market will revive again ? I hope so.
1991. You have always had ups and downs in the price of pearls ? Yes. One of the large dealers in
pearls told me that he considered all the divers average £3OO a year ; but I have based my estimate on a
very low catch of shell and a low price for pearls.
1992. If you wish to induce white men to become divers, do you think it desirable to place the value too
low ? Ido not wish to be placed in the position of having it said that I have been spoiling my case by
over-estimating it. lam certainly in favour of white divers; but I would rather under-estimate the
earnings than over-estimate them.
1993. Do you think that the prospect of earning £2OO a year would induce white divers to come here ?
£2OO over and above their living.
1994. Do you think that would be sufficient inducement for white men to come here and rough it in the
boats ? Yes.
1995. Do you not think they could earn more at mining or other occupations ? No. Of course, if
prices increase at all, it will be very much better. My idea is that white men should be brought in with
a view to their becoming the owners of the boats and getting a share of the profits as well.
1996. A man must be of fairly good physique to become a diver ? Good physique and a steady nerve.
1997. Do you think that suitable men, of good physique and steady nerve, would be prepared to engage
in the hazardous occupation of diving when they can make £3 10s. to £4 per week at mining in the
North, and can live in comfort with their wives and families ? If you were to go to the North Sea and
let it be known to the fishermen there that they could earn £2OO a year over and above their food, in an
occupation not so hazardous as fishing in the North Seas, I am of opinion that there would be no difficulty
in getting men to come here as divers. The death rate among the divers is very low, except at Darnley
Island, where they court death.
1998. By Mr. Bennett : You mean death by accident? Yes; working in from 18 to 20 fathoms, deaths
from accident are very few—not £ per cent.
1999. What wages are paid to free men as crews —not indented labourers ? There are practically no
free men offering now, because of the Japanese and the New Guinea indented labourers. The wages are
from £2 15s. to £3 a month.
2000. What are the wages paid to Japanese indented labourers ? £2 ss. a month. Of course it costs a
little more, because there is the cost of getting the men here. They do not all pay that rate, but that
is what it works out at roughly.
2001. What wages do tenders get ? The diver pays his own tender out of what he gets.
2002. As a rule it is not stated on the articles ? It is stated at £5 10s. a month, but it is purely a matter
for the diver to give what he thinks fit. The pay is from
2003. It has been said that white divers would probably require white tenders—Do you think that is so ?
I would certainly think that legislation should tend in the direction of employing white tenders.
2004. But do you not think white tenders would be required ? Not necessarily required, but they would
be desirable to raise the standing of the industry.
2005. Do you think the wages you have mentioned would be sutlicient for them ? Possibly not to get a
good class of men. I should say that £7 a month would enable you to get a good class of men.
2006. Do you know the wages paid on coasting vessels ? I think they are paid £6 10s. a month, but I
do not know.

MINUTES OE EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE ROYAL COMMISSION.


F. C. Hodel.
10 June, 1908.
• 2007. What wages are paid to Papuan labourers? They are paid £1 a month, but the man who works
the boat pays more. For instance, I get down a dozen “ boys” from Daru, and I pay them £1 a month. I
i. have to pay the expense of recruiting them and sending them home again, and I have to give the “ boys”
a certain amount of tobacco and clothing, so that the man who takes those “boys” from me pays
£1 12s. 6d. to cover all expenses.
2008. Arc the terms on which Papuans are obtainable sufficiently favourable for owners ? Yes, because
we get them for twelve months now. At one time there was only six months’ recruiting.
2009. I thought it was six months for the first term and then twelve months ? The twelve months’
engagements came into force last year.
2010. I could not quite make out whether you are in favour of the floating-station system or not—Can
you say “ Yes ”or“No ” to that? lam distinctly against it.
2011. I take it that your principal reason is that the system does not permit of a population being
settled on the islands in Torres Strait ? It tends to stop it.
2012. Does not the system also tend to the over fishing of the beds ? If anything, it has a tendency in
that direction. Of course, any system of close working does that.
2013. Do you remember when the 5-inch limit was brought into operation ? About 1897 or 1898.
2014. Do you remember what was the immediate result of the adoption of the 5-inch limit? No; I was
living outside Brisbane at that time, and was not then directly in touch with the industry.
2015. Have you ever seen the record of the results of pearl-shell fishing for the year 1897 ? I have seen
the statistics, but I cannot recall them sufficiently well to dwell upon them.
2016. According to your evidence, at the present time divers pick up shell under 5 inches—lf the 6-inch
limit were reverted to, do you think they would pick up shell under 5 inches ? Probably there would
not be the same proportion of shell under 5 inches picked up. There is not a great proportion picked up
now.
2017. Would you be surprised to hear that the difference between the weight of a 5-inch and 6-inch shell
is as much as 50 per cent. ? In some shell it might be, but not in others.
2018. That is the difference in the shell you get most of —Old Ground shell ? I should not have thought
that, and 1 fancy it is not more than 20 per cent.
2019. Formerly there was a system here of paying divers so much per 100 shells —Do you think
the reintroduction of that system would have a tendency to restrain divers from picking up small shell ?
It might, but I do not think it would make much difference.
2020. Not if the owners stipulated that no shell under a certain limit would be accepted ? The most
important factor in the matter is that shell is opened, if at all, on the chance of obtaining a pearl.
2021. Do you think many divers will pick up very small shell on the off chance of obtaining a pearl ? I
do not think they would pick up very much shell much under 5 inches, but I think the average diver will
pick up anything he comes across if he thinks there is the remotest chance of getting a pearl inside.
2022. I suppose you find considerable difficulty in making alien divers understand the evil effects of the
destruction of small shell ? As long as we have an alien race here who have nothing in common with
ourselves, and who only come here for what they can make out of the industry, nothing of that kind can
be instilled into them. That is one of the objections to alien divers.
2023. You have stated that divers earn from £l2O to £l5O a year—ls that under the system of paying
them an average of about £B5 per ton of shell raised ? With Papuan labour —with cheaper labour they
would earn more. Taking free labour, or where the Japanese put their own countrymen on low wages,
the earnings are more. I know of one man who got £3 ss. a week.
2024. The diver pays the wages, and what else ? They pay for the food supply.
What else ? A certain proportion of the cost of the diving-dress.
2026. And of pipes ? No.
2027. Does the owner pay for repairs to the boat ? The owner entirely.
2028. Who pays for insurance ? The owner entirely.
2029. So that the diver pays the wages, the food bill, and a certain proportion of the cost of dress ? And
of underclothing.
2030. And for a helmet and corslet, if a new one is required ? No ; that is paid for by the owner.
2031. Does the diver pay for boots ? The owner pays for those.
2032. By the Chairman : Deferring again to the question of the scientific cultivation of the pearl-oyster,
what localities would you suggest as suitable for experiments in cultivation? I should say about the
Duncan Group, Alligator Passage, Badu, Mua Passage, between Possession Island and the mainland,
Port Lihou, Ellis Channel, between Horn Island and Wednesday Island, and there are some places up
near Mabuiag Island. In fact, there are dozens of suitable places.
2033. By Mr. Bennett-. What about Friday Island Passage? Friday Island Passage, too.
2034. By the Chairman-. What do you consider are the essentials to the success of an experiment
in cultivation ? The first step would be to form a station. After that, you would require one or two
persons to carefully watch the spat as it is thrown, and the growth of the spat.
2035. That comes within the scope of scientific cultivation ? Not necessarily scientific —semi-scientific.
2036. Do you think that if areas suitable for cultivation were offered to individuals, and conditions were
made more favourable by legislation, they would be taken up P Until we know a little more about the
natural history of the pearl-oyster, I do not think there will be much done in the way of cultivation, and
we want the Government to show us how to handle the fish.
2037. By Mr. Bennett: You think a biological station would be a necessary preliminary ? An absolutely
necessary preliminary.
2038. By the Chairman -. Can you form any opinion as to the approximate capital required for such an
experiment ? No ; it is like a mining venture.
2039. And you cannot say how long it would be before any return could be expected from the outlay ?
I think the shell grows to a marketable size in five years. The knowledge I have gained satisfies me on
that point.
2040. By Mr. Bennett-. What do you call a good marketable size? Six inches.
2041. By the Chairman: With a view to offering some inducement to white men to work in the industry,
do you think that the granting of extended leases on islands in the Strait would encourage white families
to enter the industry? No, because no man likes to venture into the unknown, especially where he feels
he is unwelcome ; and as long as it remains a black man’s industry the white man will not come in.


2012. You have admitted that as the black man passes out of the industry, it is possible the white man
will come in ? Yes ; and I say the Government should give him a lead, and show him how to handle the
pearl oyster. If that is done, the white man will come along.
2043. Assuming that the necessary legislation is passed to make the conditions attractive to white men,
do you think it possible that homes would bo formed on the islands by white men engaged in the
industry? I think it is quite possible for homes to be formed on practically all the islands in Torres
Strait.
2044. How long would it take a North Sea fisherman—a man between twenty and thirty years of age,
and of good physique—to become a good diver ? A month.
2045. Are you of opinion that before men are accepted as divers they should undergo a medical
examination? Before the Government accept any man as a diver, I certainly think he should be
proved, by examination, to have a strong heart.
2046. Do you think that some young Australians and natives of Tasmania and New Zealand might be
induced to enter the industry under the changed conditions suggested ? If you had a biological station
with a college formed in the Torres Strait, I think students would enter the college.
2047. 1 mean would they be induced to come here as divers? I think you would get a few, but not
many, because there is no sea-fishing community worth speaking of in Australia.
2048. To make the industry more acceptable to white men, you think the first step is to found a
biological station ? Yes ; that is the first and most important step.
2049. By Mr. Douglas: You have never engaged in any experiments in pearl-oyster cultivation ? I
intended to once, but the Government nipped the attempt in the bud.
2050. I think you said that Mr. Saville Kent has made a success of his recent experiment in Albany
Pass? Mr. Saville Kent went home highly elated with the success of his experiment.
2051. Was his object to cultivate pearl or shell ? Both.
2052. By the Chairman: Have you any evidence at all of the meed of success he obtained ? He showed
me three pearls which he had produced. I am his agent, and know most of his business, though, of
course, not his secret. He went to Natuna Islands, Singapore, in December last. Before going, he
experimented with some of the pearl-shell, and, when he came back in April, ho was able to produce
three very passable pearls.
2053. Were they pearls or blisters ? They were blisters, but only slightly attached. One was nearly
•J-ineh in diameter, and was of good lustre. He was wearing a pearl himself at the time, and he told me
that it had been valued at £4O. There was very little difference between it and the other pearls as
regards lustre.
2054. There have been several experiments made in Torres Strait—The Government had Mr. Tosh here ?
And Mr. Saville Kent was Commissioner for Fisheries here for some years in the early days —about 1887
to 1889.
2055. Did not the Clark combination have an expert engaged in the cultivation of the pearl-oyster ? I
do not think he engaged in pearl-oyster cultivation.
2056. Do you remember the fact ? I remember the fact that he was engaged.
2057. That experiment was in Friday Island Passage ? Yes.
2058. Do you think it was a land 'fide attempt to cultivate the pearl-oyster at all? Ido not think so.
2059. The company must have gone to considerable expense? The expense would have been nothing if
the shell had grown. It would have been like removing store cattle to fattening ground.
2060. Have you read Mr. Pace’s reports ? No.
2061. Are you aware that he made a report to the Government? No, I never saw that mentioned.
2062. You mentioned the Duncan Group as being a suitable place for cultivation purposes? Yes,
between the Hawkesbury Islands and Badu.
2063. Do you think those areas should be reserved for cultivation? I should leave it to the biologist to
select his own site. We have a good site round Wai-Weer.
2064. Do you recollect the reasons why Mr. Tosh was withdrawn from his investigations ? It was
understood that it was because the Government had no money to go on with the biological station.
2065. That was the reason given ? Yes.
2066. Did you see Mr. Tosh while he was here ? I did not see a great deal of him.
2067. You could not form any opinion as to his qualifications ? From what little I saw of him, and from
his reports, I judged him to be a very practical man.
2068. If it were possible to re-engage him, do you think it would be a wise thing to do it ? Yes; because
he would have so much knowledge to start with. He might go on with his biological station straight
away, as the plans are in the department.
2069. By Mr. Bennett: That was at Wai-Weer? Yes ; a very good site.
2070. By Mr. Dougla>: From your knowledge of the cost of working pearl-shelling boats, and the local
conditions, what do you think would be the cost of establishing such a station, apart from the salary of
the biologist ? lam not a scientist; but if I were first there I could do a great deal of good in the
.propagation of pearl-shell for £5OO a year—that is, once the biological station was established.
2071. You would require a boat of some sort ? That would be necessary ; but not to transplant shell.
2072. Would it be possible to arrange with local pearl-shellers to supply as much young shell as you
required, instead of going to the heavy expense of getting a boat specially for the station ? I think it
would be much wiser for the Government to find a boat, if they were going to transplant shell at all.
Mr. Saville Kent could not get anybody to bring in shell. He made several contracts, but they all fell
through. The Japanese absolutely refused to bring in any shell. Then he made a contract through Mr.
Walker with the Badu people, and they went back on him. Now he has two boats engaged in bringing
shell into Albany Pass.
2073. The Japanese refused to bring in shell ? They would not bring him any, so that in point of fact
they declined.
2074. You are aware that a steamer will shortly be placed here ? I understand so.
2075. Would she be of any use? Yes. It would be very easy to put a wire cage down her side to
bring in the shell. It is a very simple thing to bring in the shell.
2076. You think that £5OO a year, exclusive of the salary of a director of the station, would be a
reasonable thing ? Not if you are going to form a college or anything of that sort.

2077. But apart from a college? I think you would get a great deal of good work done for an
expenditure of £5OO a year.
3. 2078. Do you think it would be a wise thing to set aside a sum of, say, £l,OOO a year? I think it is due
to the Government to do that. I think they ought to do it.
2079. The revenue from the port justifies such an expenditure ? Tes, and, considering the amount of
latent wealth, it might find employment for a large fishing community hero.
2080. You think that a training school for divers might be established in conjunction with a scientific
college ? lam not so keen on a training school for divers, because it does not take long to train a diver.
2081. By Mr. Bennett: You think their training could beat be done in the boats ? Yes, and by a bonus
while they are training.
2082. By Mr. Douglas : Is a bonus on the shell obtained a feasible suggestion ? Yes.
2083. What bonus would you suggest should be paid, working with a white diver and a white tender P
I should be inclined to put it on a sliding scale—say, if necessary, £25 a ton for the first year, next year
£2O, bringing it down £5 a year.
2081. Is it not possible that a system of dummying might also crop up in connection with such a system
—Por instance, a European might go out in a boat, and he might employ one of his alien crew to act as
diver—The shell would come in, he would have been in the boat, and perhaps he would claim the bonus ?
Possibly there would be a certain amount of dummying ; but in all legislation there are loopholes of
which people will take advantage. But, as you introduce white men gradually, the aliens will have to
go out.
2085. If suitable areas on the foreshores of the different islands were marked off just as you mark off
land that is to be thrown open to agricultural settlement, and they were thrown open to occupation
licenses, and, failing their being taken up, the areas were reserved, allowing no boats to fish there, do you
think that would be a wise plan ? I should not recommend any limitation in the way of closing areas if
you are going to limit the divers, because the owners will have a bad time more or less —they are having
it at the present time—and I would not like to see things made worse by closing areas.
2086. But assuming that a biological station is established ? The spat might be propagated. The
question of selecting areas and reserving them is, perhaps, more for the future after the successful
cultivation of shell has been demonstrated by an expert.
2087. Assuming that an expert can bring his experiments to a successful issue, would it be desirable to
mark off areas all over the Strait, and allow them to be taken up under occupation licenses ? Yes ; but
not to close them, because, after they had been closed for twelve months, men might apply for them, take
up a nice nest of shell, and then throw up the areas again.
2088. At some future time, would a scheme of that kind lead to permanent settlement? If you got your
biological station properly going, and people learned to handle the shell, and the Government threw open
frontages, they would be gradually taken up.
2089. Do you know the length of time it is possible to take up a lease for at the present time ? No.
2090. It is seven years —Do you think that a sufficiently long time? No.
2091. "What length of time would you suggest? I should suggest twenty years at least. Eor instance,
take Mr. Saville Kent’s work. He has spent a good deal of money at Albany Pass, and now he has to
get an arrangement to pump water into his tanks, and that will require a solid foundation, and he wants
something more substantial than a seven-years’ lease.
2092. Would you suggest a rental or a royalty on shell raised on cultivated areas? I should suggest
neither. I would suggest giving every latitude for the first five years.
2093. But do you suggest a rental or a royalty as the fairer for everybody concerned, seeing that pearl-
shell is movable ? I think a royalty is the fairer.
2094. You would suggest a nominal rental and a royalty ? Yes, but I would charge no royalty for the
first three or five years.
2095. Do you think that Mr. Saville Kent is desirous of working a Government scientific station, and
that it would be desirable to enlist his services ? Bailing Mr. Tosh, I think the Government ought to
approach Mr. Saville Kent; but, as he is connected with a private company, it would interfere with the
operations of his company.
2096. I understand that Mr. Saville Kent has made some unofficial statements to the effect that he would
be prepared to undertake the work ? I think he would be prepared to assist, but I would not like the
Government to approach him and interfere with his own company’s work.
2097. By the Chairman: Would you recommend the employment of Mr. Tosh ? Unquestionably I would
recommend it very strongly, and, if he is not obtainable, I would recommend the appointment of Mr.
Saville Kent. I was going to make a suggestion to the Commission about the Government buying out
the whole of the fleets and trying the experiment. It would not be very costly.
2098. By Mr. Douglas : Can you put a proposition before us ? No. I have not spoken to a single
sheller. 1 know that those most largely interested in the industry would favour a proposition for the
Government to buy them out at a valuation and work the industry on their own system. £40,000
would do it, in my opinion.
2099. By the Chairman : So you include the Clark fleets ? They are not working in Torres Strait al
present.
2100. Eorty thousand pounds for 112 boats ? I am allowing a big margin. The boats would not be
worth, on the average, more than £3OO or £350.
2101. By Mr. Douglas-. There are 112 pump boats at the present time? If you are going to touch the
question of the labour, you had better put the alien out of the beehe-de-mer boat, so that there would be
140 boats. There is no use making one-half of the industry-white, or experimenting with one-half of
the industry, and not with the other.
2102. In the event of that being done, what would you suggest? The Government should limit the
number of boats to be worked —say, to 100 boats. Then they could hire them out, or sell them on the
time-payment system to any Europeans who came along.
2103. You would not renew existing divers’ licenses if that suggestion were carried out? If I did, I
would only renew them for a year or two, and give them time to see about going home again.
2104. Would it not be rather unfair to men who have taken up their abode here and become citizens ?
Most of them are indented men who have to go home in three years. It is not a big amount for the
Government to spend in the experiment,

2105. What would be done with the indented men ? They would remain until their time was up, and
then you would send them home again. By that time you would have worked in a number of white men,
and there would he the Papuans, too. :
2100. Do you think the Japanese would cuisent to work under those conditions —I should think they
would have to be sent back ? I think most of them would work rather than go hack. They are very
kindly disposed towards Australia.
2107. By Mr. Bennett : Do you think that any Government in Queensland, or in Australia, would
undertake to work the industry with coloured labour? The Government could undertake to work the
industry with its own coloured labour. I think it would be a very good scheme for the Government to
consider.
2108. By Mr. Douglas : Could you put your scheme before the Commission, so that it might be duly
considered? The only scheme I would put forward would be that a valuation should be made of the
boats of all owners who wished to sell out. Those who did not wish to sell out should remain on
condition that they found white divers. The Government might lay up a certain number of the boats for
a start, and endeavour to bring in fishermen from other parts or men used to water work; and they might
sell the boats to these men as they do with the repurchased estates down South. In that way they would
introduce a system of small ownership.
2109. If you could put any proposition in writing before the Commission, it could be published in
appendix form and duly considered ? I will do so before the Commission go away. The matter has
come into my mind during the last two or three days, but I have not gone into it fully.
2110. By the Chairman -. Have you consulted other boat-owners on the subject ? Only one who is very
largely interested, and he thinks it a very good scheme.

Peesent:
Captain J. MACKAT ( Chairman) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Eeank Summees, Shipwright and ex-Pearler, examined:
2111. By the Chairman : What are you? A shipwright by trade.
2112. What are you at present ? I am master of the hulk “ C. H. Watjen.”
2113. How many years have you been at Thursday Island ? I came here on 24th May, 1873.
2114. How many years have you been engaged in the pearl-shell industry ? Twenty-one years.
2115. In what capacity ? Eirst as a diver.
2116. Secondly ? In charge of the Queensland Pearl Company’s station.
2117. Have you been an employer of labour in the industry ? Ves.
2118. Then we may assume that you are familiar with every phase of the industry ? With every phase
till I went away.
2119. By Mr. Bennett : When did you go away ? In 1894.
2120. By the Chairman : How long were you employed as a diver ? I was not employed by anybody ; 1
was working for myseif.
2121. Eor how long ? Between five and six years, diving all the time.
2122. By Mr. Douglas-. What years were those? Erom 1873 up to the time when I took charge of
Wai-Weer Station.
2123. By the Chairman : Did you suffer any injury to health during the five years you were diving ? No.
2124. You did not find it injurious to your health in any way ? No; and I was diving before that.
2125. By Mr. Bennett-. Marine diving, I suppose? Yes.
2126. By the Chairman -. But during the five years you were diving in the pearl-shell industry, did you
sustain any injury ? None at all.
2127. Diving agreed with you as well as any other employment? Rather better, I think. I never had
an ache or a pain through diving.
2128. Do you think, from your experience, that it is possible for the industry to be carried on by white
divers ? Ses.
2129. Do you think it is possible to carry on the industry with white divers and with white labour
wholly ? No.
2130. You think it is possible to carry on the industry successfully and profitably with white divers and
white tenders ? Yes.
2131. With natives of New Guinea as crews ? Yes. I would like to add, if you get the proper sort of
men—men who have a bit of conscience.
2132. Are you familiar with the conditions of the fishermen in the North Sea? No.
2133. Are you an Australian ? Yes.
2134. Erom what you know of the industry, do you think it is possible to induce some of our young
Australians thev are not altogether devoid of the spirit of adventure —to embark in the industry under
the conditions I have mentioned ? Yes, it is quite possible.
2135. Besides the conditions I have mentioned, can you suggest any others which might render the
industry more attractive to white men ? I do not know that there is anything else to suggest. There
were several white divers here when I was working in the industry, and afterwards, and they were
successful. . .
2136 What was the cause of those men giving up diving r At times the price of shell went down to
Buch a figure that it would not pay them to work with a boat of their own.
2137. Were there any other reasons ? Not as far as I know.
2138. Did any of them acquire a competency from diving which enabled them to retire or to embark in
some other business ? Yes; I have known two or three who have acquired such a competency.

s. 2139. They did well ? Yes.
>, 2140. Do you not think that what has been done may be done asain ? Yes, I do.
18.2141. Are you aware that it would be necessary to alter the existing law in order to render the industry
more attractive to white men ? That is a matter upon which I could hardly venture an opinion.
2142. At present the term of a lease is seven years, is it not ? That is all, I believe.
2143. Do you think it desirable to extend the term ? That is a matter upon which a layman could hardly
give an opinion. Do you mean cultivation ?
2144. I will come to that by and by —1 am now speaking of grounds for fishing ? It is shelling ground
right out into the Arafura Sea.
2145. Do you think it is possible to carry on cultivation in Torres Strait ? I do.
2146. Having in view the cultivation of the pearl-oyster, do you think it desirable that leases should be
granted for longer terms ? I think cultivation should be started by the G-overnraent.
2147. Do you think the present term of seven years should be extended ? Yes. I think seven years is
too short.
2148. What term would you suggest ? I should say at least twenty years.
2149. What localities would you recommend for cultivation purposes ? The whole of Torres Strait.
2150. There are some places more suitable than others, are there not ? Yes.
2151. Will you mention them ? There are the Prince of Wales Boat Channel, Horn Island, on the
northern side of Black Eocks, the inside of Eoko Island in Endeavour Strait, and there are two or
three places along the shores of Badu.
2152. Those, in your opinion, are the most favourable localities for cultivation ? Well, there were
good beds of shell there in small areas, and the shell has increased there several times since. With
regard to Badu, if any spat escaped from there, the reefs and islands in the neighbourhood would catch
it.
2153. Do you think that cultivation could be carried on throughout the whole of the Strait ? Ido not
think so.
2154. I mean where islands or islets exist ? Ido not think so.
2155. Do you think that under more favourable conditions, such as an extension of the term of lease, it
would be possible for white families to embark in the industry and settle on the islands in Torres Strait?
I do not think so, unless they had something else to do.
2156. By Mr. Douglas: I take it that you think cultivation by private enterprise is hardly possible,
unless the Government give a lead ? They will have to instruct people, I take it. None of us know
anything about cultivation.
2157. And, until it is proved to be practicable, it is hard to say whether European families could make a
success of it, living on the islands ? Yes.
2158. It is for the Government to lead the way and show how the greater proportion of the spat thrown
off can be secured? I think the Government should establish a school where men could get some
knowledge of scientific cultivation.
2159. By the Chairman-. Under the changed conditions that Mr. Douglas has mentioned, do you think
the industry could be made attractive to white men ? It is quite likely.
2160. I suppose you have had no experience in cultivation ? No. I have taken small shell and put it
down to see how it grew.
2161. With what results? Not too good. A great number of the shell died. If you move them away,
the crabs will kill them.
2162. You mean if the shell is transplanted from one bed to another ? I do not think that should be done,
because in removing the shell you spoil the natural home of the shell where you take it up.
2163. By Mr. Douglas: It has been stated that it is immaterial whether a shell removed from one bed to
another is laid on its round or its flat side ? It does not matter which. When the shell is young, it
stands straight up, being fastened by a string, and, when it increases in age, it falls on its side.
2164. By Mr. Bennett : Either way ? Either side—it does not matter.
2165. I have been informed differently, but you would know ? If you ask any diver, he will tell you
that they pick them up either way.
2166. By Mr. Douglas-. So that has nothing to do with whether the shell lives or not—it lives on either
side ? Yes. It nearly always feeds with the current running towards it. The mouth is opened towards
the current when it is feeding, and when it is the opposite way it is shut.
2167. By the Chairman: Do you think any restrictions should be placed on the size of vessels employed
in the pearl-shell industry for diving ? I should not think so.
2168. By Mr. Douglas : The bearing of that question is perhaps hardly apparent to you—the floating-
station system has been in existence for some time—When you were diving from 1873 to 1878, there was no
such thing as a large schooner? Yes ; we had a schooner for two years.
2169. What was her size ? 90 tons. She was called “ The Three Brothers.”
2170. Did she convoy a fleet of luggers ? She had a fleet, but we never took her anywhere. We moored
her here at Thursday Island.
2171. You did not utilise her on the pearling ground, the same as was done later? No, she was our home.
We would go away for a month, and then come back to the ship.
2172. Do you think that working a fleet under the convoy of a schooner, whereby the luggers may remain
constantly on the ground and take every opportunity of getting shell, is conducive to the industry
remaining permanent, or does it tend to deplete the beds by having them so continuously fished over ?
The schooner is a mark for the boats fishing. You get a few shell hero to-day, and you can return to
the same place to-morrow with the floating-station system. If there were no schooner, there would be
no mark, and you could not pick up that place again.
2173. The schooner system enables you to clean up a patch better? Yes.
2174. Would the shell grow there again prolifically ? Yes. That is ray experience, particularly on the
Old Ground.
2175. By the Chairman-. Then do you approve of the floating-station system ? Ido not. I never liked
it, although I had to do it.
2176. For what reason ? Comfort was one reason. We were much more comfortable than when we were
rolling outside.
74
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEB EOTAIt COMMISSION.


2177. By Mr. Douglas : I take it that floating stations are more necessary nowadays, when the boats
have to go further afield ? Yes.
2178. But, when working the inshore grounds, it would not bo necessary to have any floating stations at
all ? No. Still we have worked round Cook Beef and those places without floating stations.
2179. By the Chairman : Do you think the vessels used for pump-diving could be increased in size to
make the life more comfortable for white divers? I think the present boats are ample for anybody’s
comfort.
2180. Then they could not be made more comfortable? Ido not think so. If you have a boat too big,
it is very heavy on the man at the bottom.
2181. What do you consider to be the minimum size for pump boats, having regard to the comfort of the
divers ? It is according to a man’s fancy. I would sooner have a small boat of Bor 10 tons ; it is
handier.
2182. By Mr. Douglas: It would be handier getting round among the reefs ? Handier, and quite as
comfortable as these other boats, to my view.
2183. By the Chairman : Do you approve of the present size limit of shell? I would not like to see that
altered now for the sake of the people engaged in the industry; but when the question of altering the
size of shell was first raised, I stuck out for the large size. They got up a lot of agitation here, saying
that 6 inches was too big, and the size was reduced to 5 inches. But I say that was altogether wrong,
because there is a lot of difference between the weight of a 5-inch shell and 6-inch shell.
2184. By Mr. Douglas : What is the average difference in weight between a 5-inch and a 6-inch Old
Ground shell? I should say from 3to 4 ounces.
2185. Would that be as much as 50 per cent, on the total weight ? No.
2186. A 6-inch shell would not be half as heavy again as a 5-inch shell? No.
2187. By the Chairman -. You are aware that at present the divers are chiefly Japanese ? Yes.
2188. Do you consider such a condition of things necessary or desirable—ls it consistent with the
interests of the white man that these aliens should derive all the benefit from the industry ? I could
hardly undertake to say anything about that.
2189. Would it not be better to conserve the industry, if possible, for white men—You have already
admitted that it is quite possible for white men to carry on the diving ? Quite as well as the Japanese.
2190. Then it is not desirable to conserve the industry for our own colour ? I should say that every
boat that is licensed in the future should be compelled to have a white diver, allowing the boats at present
licensed to go for ten years, gradually weeding the Japanese out.
2191. You think it is desirable to make a gradual change ? I think so. I would sooner see my own
class here.
2192. By Mr. Douglas-. That would not inflict any undue hardship on the present owners of boats, or
on the aliens who now hold licenses ? I think it would be very fair.
2193. By the Chairman: What should be the average annual earnings of a white diver ? It would
depend upon the price of shell.
2194. By Mr. Bennett : Under present conditions, if you know them ? I could not say.
2195. By the Chairman : Take a fair average of £l5O per ton ? I think it would pay a white diver to
work at that rate.
2196. What remuneration could be secure with shell at that price? I think that a diver ought to have
nothing less than £25 a month.
2197. By Mr. Douglas-. Would that include pearls ? No.
2198. It would depend a good deal upon the catch of shell ? Yes. I would not pay him monthly wages.
Pay him so much per 100 shell—say 2-lb. shell.
2199. That was the custom in the old days ? Yes, and it worked well.
2200. By the Chairman : Would it be necessary for a white diver to have a white tender ? No.
2201. Would you think it safe to entrust your life to a Papuan ? I always had a coloured tender.
2202. By Mr. Bennett -. What nationality were they, as a rule ? All sorts.
2203. South Sea Islanders ? Principally South Sea Islanders.
2204. Eotumah men ? I had a Lifu man for three years.
2205. They are very intelligent—more intelligent than Solomon Islanders ? I do not know. Solomon
Islanders have very fair intelligence.
2206. By the Chairman : Would you have implicit confidence in a New Guinea tender? Yes, after a
time. I have confidence in some now from what I have seen of them.
2207. By Mr. Bennett: You think that the New Guinea natives are capable of being trained to under-
take pretty well any part of the work ? Yes ; and the Strait natives, too.
2208. By the Chairman : You have informed us that you sustained no injury to health from diving ? I
never had an ache or a pain.
2209. In fact, you improved in health ? I think I improved in health.
2210. Do you think it possible for a while man to carry on diving without injury to health ? Yes, unless
he goes too deep.
2211. What limit would you suggest? Some men’s constitutions are different to those of others. I
was diving at Darnley Island in 32 fathoms, but I have seen a lot of men killed directly they got to the
bottom.
2212. What depth would you suggest as a limit ? I should leave it to the man himself.
2213. Would you recommend that before a man is licensed as a diver he should undergo a medical
examination ? I do not think that is necessary.
2214. There are men apparently in good health who may be suffering from some insidious disease of the
heart ? Ido not think diving would hurt a man even with consumption.
2215. Not with consumption, perhaps, but if he had a weak heart ? It might affect a weak heart.
2216. You assume that all men are physically strong like yourself? No. I look at it this way : We
have had so few people die in Torres Strait, unless they were diving in deep water.
2217. I presume you are referring now to the mortality amongst the Japanese ? There are others besides
Japanese.
2218. By Mr. Douglas : You would not class a Japanese diver dmng in deep water with a European—
the Japanese are fatalists who are quite regardless of life—they consider that when their time is come
they go—lt is not the same with the ordinary European diver, is it? Ido not think so.

• 2219. The Japanese divers are prepared to risk their lives more? They do risk them, although most of
\ them work in the deep water under different circumstances. They take out three divers in the one boat.
S. 2220. By the Chairman : Assuming that shell was realising £l5O per ton, you think it quite possible for
white men to carry on the industry profitably ? Yes; but J would not fetch a diver from the South.
2221. Have you had any experience in the beehe-do-mer industry ? No.
2222. Do you consider the present system of basing the amount of license fee on the tonnage of a vessel
satisfactory ? No. I should class the large and small vessels fishing for shell at the same price, because
a larger boat cannot get more shell than a smaller boat, while the larger boat is more expensive to keep
up.
2223. Is the present system of issuing licenses to divers and persons in charge satisfactory? I do not
think you can better it.
2224. By Mr Douglas-. Would it be more convenient for the public if the boat licenses and divers’
licenses were all issued by the Shipping Master, instead of having to deal with two offices ? Yes; I would
rather see it that way.
2225. By Mr. Bennett-. It used to be so in the past? Yes.
2226. By the Chairman : You think it would be an improvement ? Yes ; it would save time.
2227. By Mr. Douglas: You stated that the reason why a number of white divers who were here in the
early days failed to continue working was principally on account of the low price of shell ? I think so.
A number of them went out on that account.
2228. Did the take of shell also fall off, or was it merely due to the low price obtainable that they were
compelled to leave the industry? It was the low price.
2229. Was the ordinary European diver at that time working his own boat ? Most of them worked on
that system.
2230. They would buy a boat, fit her up, and employ men themselves ? Yes.
2231. So that they would have to take whatever price they could obtain for their shell ? Yes.
2232. You think it was more on account of the low price of shell that they had to give it up ? Yes,
and the expensive way they lived when they came to Thursday Island.
2233. They spent their money regardless of the future ? As a rule they spent it before they got it.
2234. Were they mortgaged ? 1 could not say.
2235. Had they a good class of boats in those days ? Yes.
2236. Seaworthy ? Yes.
2237. Where were they built? In New South Wales.
2238. By Mr. Bennett -. And in New Zealand ? About twelve or fourteen came from New Zealand.
2239. By Mr. Douglas-. Was the upkeep of boats heavier then than it is now? Ido not think so,
because we all kept a carpenter and had a boatshed of our own.
2240. By Mr. Bennett: What was the nationality of the carpenters ? They were always Europeans.
2241. Were the carpenters working under the principal carpenter Europeans? Yes. There were no
slips or anything of that sort in those days. Wherever you stopped among the islands you had a
boatshed.
2242. By Mr. Douglas-. Were you here at the inception of the pearl-shelling industry ? No ; I think
it had been going about two and a-half years when I came to Thursday Island.
2243. At that time was the industry carried on by dress diving or swimming diving ? By swimming
diving.
2244. Were there any pump boats? There was one pump boat.
2245. But when you came it was mostly swimming diving ? Yes. There was one man named Love, and
another named Thos. McNab, who were engaged in dress diving. The latter was killed through a pipe
bursting.
2246. What nationality were the divers ? A lot of them were Samoans and Earatonga natives.
2247. Did they work for wages ? Yes.
2248. They did not own the boats ? No.
2249. Was it possible in those days to get Europeans as divers ? I do not think they would come to
Torres Strait.
2250. And it was necessary to employ men who would come to the Strait? Yes.
2251. Do you think that if a regulation had been in existence at that time providing that none but
Europeans could obtain licenses, the industry would have prospered ? At that time this place was a free
port. There was no license at all, and no duty on anything.
2252. No license for boats ? No.
2253. By Mr. Bennett ■. I think it was in 1881 that the Government began to issue licenses ? I think so.
2254. By Mr. Douglas: Did the introduction of the coloured man as a diver tend to keep Europeans out
of the industry ? Ido not think so, at first.
2255. But if the European diver had come to consider that it was merely a coloured man’s occupation,
and that he should be the employer, having coloured men to work for wages for him, would that keep
white men out of the industry ? Ido not think so, because I know that the few men who came along
were employed by the firms engaged in the industry.
2256. They were dissolute, and spent their money freely ? Most of them did.
2257. And the employers had to obtain more reliable labour ? Yes.
2258. Were the coloured divers as great spendthrifts as Europeans, or did they show any tendency to
indulge in drinking ? Yes, but if they did not suit you, you could put others in their places. But, in
the case of white men, you had nobody to replace them.
2259. Were coloured men more amenable to discipline—Did they obey the instructions of their
employers better ? Ido not think so. They went to fish just where they liked.
2260. By Mr. Bennett : That was the rule in those days, was it not ? Yes.
2261. They went where they thought they would get the best hauls ? Yes.
2262. By Mr. Douglas -. Do you think the average European diver is as good as the average Japanese
diver? Yes.
2263. How do you account for the fact that, out of 165 divers’ licenses issued at the present time, 164
are held by Japanese ? I could not say.
2264. Do you think the Japanese have been given preference over other nationalities ? Ido not think
so | but I think they are the only available labour here.

22G5. When a person commences diving, it is necessary for him to be schooled in the work, is it
not ? Yes.
2266. It would not do for a man to get into a dress and go down without having some experience ? He 3
would need to have a little experience.
2267. Would it be unwise for a man in good health to go into deep water immediately ? I think he
should have some experience in shallow water diving before he goes into deep water. •
2268. By Mr. Bennett : And he would be all the better for having some instruction? Yes.
2269. By Mr. Douglas: What length of time can a diver remain in the water? It all depends upon the
depth of the water.
2270. By the Chairman: How long do you think it would take a strong young man to become an
accomplished diver ? A couple of months, if he has any sense at all.
2271. By Mr. Douglas: Since you left Torres Strait, in 1891, you have been living in Sydney? Yes.
2272. Do you think it would be possible to obtain suitable young fellows from amongst the men you
mixed with there to undertake diving operations hero ? I could not say. Some of them might come.
2273. I suppose the chance of getting pearls would be a factor in a diver’s anticipations? They never
had the pearls; they were supposed to give them up.
2274. But when you were diving in the eighties, you obtained good pearls ? No, I never got a good one.
2275. But the chance of obtaining a pearl of large value would be one of the inducements to men to
become divers ? Yes. I think if a man gets a pearl he should have a share of the proceeds.
2276. Do you think dress-diving is a hazardous occupation ? Not if a man takes reasonable care of
himself.
2277. Among Europeans there have been a number of deaths from diving? Only one thatT know of.
2278. There have been some at Darnley Island ? There were two, I think.
2279. Those deaths would be due to diving in too deep water ? Yes.
2280. Without reasonable precautions ? Stopping down too long.
2281. Did you say that you had been down in 32 fathoms of water ? Yes, at Darnley Island.
2282. Did you dive at that depth for any length of time? I used to go there every few mouths and
stay for a month.
2283. Did you never have paralysis ? I had a slight attack.
2284. Was the shell very plentiful in the deep water at that time ? Yes, there was a lot of shell.
2285. How long would you remain on the bottom at a depth of 32 fathoms ? Pour or five minutes.
2286. How long would you be coming up ? About a quarter of an hour.
2287. How long were you going down ? I would go down pretty quickly.
2288. By Mr. Bennett: As fast as you could ? No, not as fast as I could.
2289. It is necessary to come up very slowly? Yes. You come up slowly so that you may get the
circulation. It is coming up too quickly that causes the accidents in most cases, because in coming up
quickly there is a rush of blood.
2290. Do you not think that some of the accidents which have occurred have been due to inexperience ?
Yes, a good many of them.
2291. To want of knowledge on the part of the diver ? No. They have stopped down too long. A man
will see a few shells within a yard or two of him, and he says, “ I will get them before I go up.”
2292. Do you think it is advisable to close those deep water areas with a view to preventing men risking
their lives diving there ? I should not like to say that, because I would not like to be stopped if I wanted
to go down.
2293. What depth do you think it is safe for a man to go down ? A man can work in 20 fathoms getting
shell. It is not laborious work.
2294. In anything up to 20 fathoms a man can work with reasonable safety ? Yes.
2295. Were you here when the Old Ground was discovered? Yes.
2296. What year was that ? 1 could hardly tell you.
2297. It was about 1881-or 1882, was it not ? About that time.
2298. Was shell very plentiful on the Old Ground in those days? Yes. The Old Ground is a place
where shell grows very fast. Out in the centre of the shelling-ground, if you pick up your anchor and
allow the boat to drift, you will make a complete circle, and come back to nearly the same place.
Having regard to that fact, I have come to the conclusion that the reason why more shell grows there
than at any other place is that when the spat comes from deep water it simply goes round that ground,
and does not get swept away.
2299. You think spat collects on the Old Ground from the deep water ? Yes; from any place. The boat
drifts round there, and I take it that the spat will do the same.
2300. By the Chairman : Do you think that fresh water is necessary for the propagation of shell ? I
would not say so, from my experience.
2301. By Mr. Douglas : Did you find that the beds in Endeavour Strait recuperated quickly ? No.
2302. They recuperated faster on the Old Grouud? Yes.
2303. Inshore you think the shell does not grow so fast? No; but there is one thing I should like to
mention about shell where there is fresh water. In Princess Charlotte Bay, where there is plenty of
fresh water, the shell is chalky, and that was the first cause of the fall in price.
2304. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know the ground over by Deliverance Island ? Yes.
2305. There is a great deal of fresh water there from the New Guinea rivers—ls the shell there superior or
inferior ? It is the worst class of shell.
2306. To what do you attribute its inferiority ? I think there is not feed enough for the oyster.
2307. Do you think fresh water will have anything to do with that ? No. I think most of the shell is a
little hard shell, and then you get a little chalky shell.
2308. Caused by the fresh water ? Yes. _
2309. By Mr. Douglas: How long does it take a shell to grow to 5 inches? The shell grows very fast
when the fish is young. .
2310. You cannot say how long it would take to grow to 5 inches ? No; but I do not think it would
take years.
2311. By the Chairman: Then you do not think that fresh water is necessary for the propagation of the
oyster or the growth of the shell ? No; but that is a matter which requires study.

11 June, 1908.
2312. By Mr. Douglas: "When did you return to Torres Strait from Sydney ? A year ago.
2313. Tou have been backwards and forwards between Here and Sydney at intervals between 1894 and
last year ? Yes.
2314. And you have had opportunities of observing how the industry has been getting on ? Not
observing—hearing..
2315. From what you have heard, what do you think is the condition of the industry? I think it is
at its worst.
2316. What are the reasons for that ? I could not say.
2317. Do you think the weather has anything to do with it ? The weather is a great protection to the
Torres Strait fishery, because there are months when they cannot work.
2318. Do you think the weather affords a certain amount of natural protection to the shell? Yes.
2319. By the Chairman : Does it assist the distribution of spat in any way ? The spat is saved, I dare say,
by weeds on the bottom. Sometimes you will go to a place and find weeds as high as your head, and in
a very few months afterwards the same ground will be quite clean.
2320. You think the weed collects the spat? It stops it getting away. As soon as the shell has any
life it gets a grip, and stands up until it attains a certain age, when it falls on its side.
2321. When the shell breaks itself loose does it shift from one place to another? I do not think so,
because you will see it embedded in the stuff.
2322. It cuts itself off from the bottom ? I take it that that is caused by the weight of the shell.
2323. Does it remain in that spot ? Yes.
2324. The tide does not carry it away ? No.
2325. Do you think the grounds have been over-fished up till the present time ? Ido not know.
2326. The quantities of shell obtainable now are nothing like what they used to be —Do you think there
are too many boats working ? I would not undertake to say —there is such a lot of ground for pearl-
shelling.
2327. Do you think it would be desirable to fix a limit to the number of boats working the ground with a
view to preventing the beds from being over-fished, and with a view to enabling people to obtain a
reasonable existence out of the industry ? It might bo necessary to do that, but I would not undertake
to say that it is.
2328. By Mr. Bennett: When you commenced diving, what was the ground most resorted to ? We
fished nearly all the places they fish now.
2329. lam speaking of the years when you were diving, from 1873 to 1878 ? We fished anywhere we
liked. There was no settled ground.
2330. But which were the grounds you most frequented—You did not go to the Old Ground then ? We
went very close to it. We went to the end of the sandbank at Badu, to the mainland, to the Wappa
Beef, to Mangrove Island, and to Cocoanut Island.
2331. Could you always rely on getting shell ? Not always.
2332. What was considered a fair yield for a pump-boat in those days with a good diver ? A diver who
got half a ton a month was doing well.
2333. That is 6 tons a year ? Yes. That is taking the boats right through.
2334. Working over the same grounds now, would a boat obtain the same yield ? Ido not think it
would.
2335. Why ? The shell is scarcer, and what you do get is lighter.
2336. You are of opinion that the 6-inch limit for exportable shell was the best ? Yes.
2337. Why were you in favour of that limit ? Because it was a shell that was of use. There is so much
waste in 5-inch shell. It is so thin that it does not weigh much.
2338. In the days wdien you were diving, if you came across a 5-iuch shell, or even a 6-inch shell, would
you have troubled to take it up ? No. Anything that was standing up we did not take.
2339. Would a 6-inch shell stand up? Most of them.
2340. Would divers generally have troubled to take them up ? Afterwards they did.
2341. When shell began to get scarce ? Yes.
2342. So that shell has been getting scarcer, on the whole, all the time ? Yes.
2343. Do you think it would assist the beds to recover if the 6-inch limit were resorted to ? I think it
would bo better for everybody.
2344. What do you think of closing some of the beds for a time —not permanently ? You might reserve
a place for a trial, getting somebody to examine it now and again. Deserve it for three years, and then
see what the improvement has been.
2345. Can you suggest a ground suitable for such a trial ? You might take a piece in Endeavour .Strait,
for instance.
2346. I suppose along behind Possession Island and High Island, and from there southwards as far as
Paterson? I woul 1 sooner take it from Dayman across to Prince of Wales Island. You could take a
face two miles across there which would not interfere with anybody’s fishing.
2347. What about lioko, and around there—Would that not be a very suitable place to close ? It
would be suitable for closure, but shell grows very quickly there. It should be a place where
spat drops, because those grounds have been fished over several times, and have been cleared, and for
four or five years you would not get any shell.
2348. Would not such places as 1 have mentioned be suitable for the experiment rather than places where
the spat would not drop ? I think it would be better to take a piece right across than to take a small
area like that. It would not give you a fair result to go to a place where you are certain shell grows
faster than elsewhere.
2349. You think the area you have mentioned would be the most suitable, because the shell does not grow
very fast there ? Yes.
2350. Do you consider that the working of the industry under floating-station conditions tends to deplete
the grounds ? Yes, where the schooners lie.
2351. Are the luggers attached to floating stations able to work more continuously and regularly than
those working from the shore ? Naturally, because the boats have not to come in for provisions and land
their shell. That lakes away from the time they can remain outside.
2352. If one boat is working from the shore, and another from a floating station, which of them will do
the most work P The floating station boat.

2353. What proportion of additional time will it be enabled to work ? I suppose it would lose three or
four days every month, if it came in every month. ,
2354. That would be the least loss, would it not ? I should say so. 1
2355. The loss would be greater under some conditions ? Yes.
2350. You said that divers were once paid by the 100 shells raised instead of by weight ? Yes. If the
shells did not weigh 2 lb. each you had to make up the weight to 2 lb. You would have to put in two or
three 6-inch shells to make up the weight of a full-grown shell.
2357. Was that system more satisfactory than the present system of paying by weight? There is not
much difference. They work out just about the same.
235?. Would not the old system tend to make a diver more careful to pick up large shell, and disregard
small shell ? I would not undertake to say.
2350. Did it not have that effect in your day? I think not. They would pick up small shell just the
same as now.
2360. What did you call small shell in those days? We would call 5-inch or 6-inch shell small.
2361. Did they take up 5-inch shell in those days? Yes.
2362. What did they do with them ? They packed them. T here was no limit then.
2363. So that even when there was no limit, and shell was plentiful, 5-inch shell was picked up ? Yes.
2364. It was exported as “ chicken” shell? Yes.
2365. Do you think it would tend to improve the class of divers, if, instead of annual licenses, a certificate
of competency was issued, on the same basis as the certificates issued to masters of ships? I would not
undertake to say. That is for the Treasurer to decide.
2366. If a man presented himself for examination as a diver, and proved that he was competent, would it
not bo an improvement to give him a certificate which would not be renewable every*year, but which
would be tenable during good conduct and competency—Would that not be a better safeguard for owners
than the present system, when a mau simply walks into the Custom House, puts down his £l, and says,
“ I want a diver’s license,” which is given to him whether he is competent or not ? Ido not think it
would make any difference to the man.
2367. He has to pay £1 every year for his license ? Ves.
2363. A master mariner pays his fee for his certificate of competency, and then he is done with it, and
pays no more—lt is his property, and he can go on any vessel for which he is suitable, whereas the diver
has to pay £1 every year as long as he is working—Do you think that is fair to the diver ? Yes ; because
if he goes away from here, his certificate is no good to him ; while a master mariner can go all over the
world, and his certificate is good to him.
2360. You have had considerable experience in employing all nationalities as crews, and you consider
that Papuans and Torres Strait Islanders are suitable for crews ? Yes ; quite as good as any others.
2370. What about the Biughis? Ido not think much of them. A few of them turn out well, but some
of them do ngt. They always have an idea in their heads for home.
2371. Have you known any natives of European descent in the Strait taking to diving as a profession ?
One—young Colless.
2372. Taking them generally, have Thursday Islanders shown a disposition to engage in diving? I do
not think any of them are old enough to tackle it.
2373. By Mr. Douglas : What sort of pumps and gear were in use originally ? Siebe and Gorman, and
Heinke’s, the same as are used now.
2374. And what dress ? Just the same as now.
2375. Have there been any improvements in either the diving pump or the diving dress ? No. They are
a bit stronger, that is all. The old ones were quite equal to the present for pumping air.
2376. Are the dresses better ? No; rather worse.
2377. Is that due to some defect in the rubber ? I think they try to make them as cheap as they can in
consequence of competition, and it means a worse article.
2378. The higher price of rubber may have something to do with it? Yes.
2379. You think the diving dress has not improved during recent years? No. AVe dived in what we
called an “ open” helmet, which only slipped over your head, and was not'serewed to the dress at all.
2380. By Mr. Bennett: You had not the corslet ? A narrow corslet was attached to it.
2381. You had not screw corslets ? No. AVe wore a canvas dress and flannels inside.
2382. By Mr. Douglas: So that the diving dress and gear have slightly improved in the last twenty
years? Yes ; but not beneficially to the man down below. There is no more air, only they last longer.
2383. And, perhaps, they are a bit safer? I would not say that even.
2384. I suppose the food generally obtainable in the Strait thirty years ago was not equal to what it is
now? No.
2385. You never got fresh beef? No; we had to fetch everything with us.
2386. There were no fresh vegetables except what you could buy from the natives? No.
2387. So that the living is much improved ? Yes.
2888. And white men and their families would be much better off in that respret now? Yes.
2389. AVhat do you consider is the average life of a steady diver? Ido not think diving would hurt him
at all. Ho can live as long as a man engaged in any other occupation without meeting with an accident.
2390. A man who docs not abuse his constitution can live as long as any other man ? Yes.
2391. By Mr. Bennett-. Can ho work as long as any other man? I think so. lam a good age, and I
am a good worker now.
2392. But lam speaking of diving ? I was diving for a good number of years.
2393. For how many years? I suppose I was fifteen or sixteen years of age when I started, and I have
been diving for the Now South AYales Government since 1894.
2394. Do you think a diver ought to submit himself for periodical examination of the chest and heart?
I do not think it is necessary.
2395. You mentioned that the shell at the bottom does not detach itself from whatever it is attached to
until it gets up to sor 6 inches ? Until it is a certain size, and then it falls over.
2396. So that there would be no difficulty in distinguishing immature shell ? No difficulty whatever.
2397. Do you think that a shell which is attached by its byssus to something at the bottom is immature ?
Ales.

2398. It does not cut itself off until it has reached maturity ? I think it is marketable shell when it falls
over. When it stands up, Ido not think it is.
2399. Would it be capable of throwing off spat? Any of the shell will throw off spat. There is usually
spat inside.
2400. Even in shell that is attached by its byssus to the ground ? Yes.
2401. It would not be hard for a diver to distinguish whether a shell was really too young or too small to
be picked up on account of its being attached by its byssus? No. There might be a few lying down,
but the majority stand up.
2402. By the Chairman : Is there anything else you can suggest that has escaped the notice of the
Commission ? I think you have gone fairly through the subject. I have nothing further to suggest.
William Heney Luff, Trader and Planter, New Guinea, examined :
2403. By the Chairman : What are you ? Trader and planter, New Guinea.
2401. How long have you been in Torres Strait ? Ten years.
2405. Have you been engaged as a trader during all that time ? No ; seven years of that time.
2406. Have you had any experience in the pearl-shell industry ? Only indirectly.
2407. What phase of the question were you most intimately connected with ? Recruiting labour.
2408. Prom New Guinea ? Yes.
2409. Solely from New Guinea? Yes.
2410. What part of New Guinea ? Daru, Western Division.
2411. For what purpose were you recruiting the natives ? For the pearl-shell fishery.
2412. As crews? Yes.
2413. Do you know whether they gave satisfaction in that capacity ? Yes ; they did.
2414. Are there many of them available for employment in the Strait ? Yes.
2415. Can you supply the demand ? I have been able to do so in the past.
2416. By Mr. Bennett : Are you still able to supply it ? Yes.
2417. By the Chairman : Is the demand increasing or otherwise ? The demand is increasing, although
the quantity is not so large now as in former times, owing to the reduced number of places.
2418. So far as you can see, the demand still exists ? Yes.
2419. Do you think the New Guinea natives are well adapted for crews ? Yes. A large number of them
have been fishermen for more than one generation.
2420. Do you think they are capable of becoming expert divers ? No.
2421. For what reason ? The native characteristics are entirely against it.
2422. Their physical characteristics ? No —their characteristics as regards sorcery. If one man was
knocked out, they would all knock off.
2423. On account of their native superstitions they are incapable of becoming divers ? Yas.
2424. Do you think that by contact with white men it is possible to eliminate that to a certain extent ?
I think not. They have been constantly employed with Japanese and white men for the last twenty
years.
2425. By Mr. Bennett : Do you think that Papuans have been with the boats for twenty years ? I
think George Smith had them twenty years ago, but I am not positive on that point.
2426. By the Chairman : Do you supply Japanese with native labour ? No.
2427. Only white men ? White employers.
2128. And you think they would not make trustworthy divers on account of their superstitions? lam
confident they would not.
2429. Is that opinion based on experience ? I have tried to persuade them to act as divers but they
would not. They have acted as tenders, but not as divers.
2430. Have the men you refer to been under the influence of missionaries ? Only during recent years.
2431. Has the missionary influence made any discernible impression upon them ? Some of the younger
generation have learned to read and write.
2432. What effect has religion had on their superstitions ? It has not overcome their superstitions. That
is a thing it will take a very long time to eliminate.
2433. By Mr. Bennett: You think it may be eliminated? Yes.
2434. By the Chairman : Do you not think that daily intercourse with white men will tend to eliminate
it ? Ido not think it will be eliminated in our time. It is looking a long way ahead.
2435. Are the natives physically fit for the work ? Yes.
2436. Are they possessed of endurance? Yes.
2437. And other qualities which will enable them to do hard work? Yes.
2438. As native labour goes, are they trustworthy as crews ? Yes. I think they are very trustworthy.
2439. Do they show any inclination to run away from their employers when they have an opportunity ?
All the time I have been over there I have heard of only one case, where a man went from one boat to
another in the harbour.
2440. For what terms are they employed ? For terms varying from six to twelve months.
2441. From your knowledge of a diver’s life in the pearl-shell industry, do you think it is possible for the
industry to be carried on by white divers ? Ido not think it would be profitable.
2442. Can you assign a reason for that opinion ? Only the reason that they say they are not paying
expenses now with coloured labour.
2443. Assuming that the conditions were made more favourable, and that the work was more
remunerative, do you think that white men could then carry on the industry? If they were subsidised,
most decidedly.
2444. By Mr. Douglas : A white man will do anything if he gets enough money for it ? Yes.
2445. By the Chairman : If the work was made more remunerative, do you think white men could carry
on ? With the help of the Government they could.
2446. Or if the industry was made more remunerative ? No ;it depends upon the market whether the
industry is remunerative.
2447. By Mr. Bennett: What the Chairman asks is—Assuming that the industry is remunerative, no
matter from what cause, would white divers engage in the industry ? I think so.
2448. By the Chairman : Do the Papuans make good crews ? Yes, they have done so in the past.

2449. Do you think an ample supply of labour could be obtained from New Guinea if the industry were
developed ? I think sufficient labour could be found, although it is not so easy to get it.
2450. Are the men you supply sea-coast men, or do you get them from the interior ? They are all from ]
the coast.
2451. Would it not be possible to get some from the banks of the rivers inland ? We have had some,
hut they have not been a success.
2452. Then your opinion is that the sea-coast Papuans are the best? Most decidedly.
2453. What parts of New Guinea do you get the natives from ? The Western Division chiefly, from a
place called Mawatta.
2454. Can you give us the geographical extremes of the littoral where you get them from ? Mawatta is
well known in the Western Division.
2455. By Mr. Bennett; Is that as far west as you go ? Yes.
2456. By the Chairman : Is it marked on the chart? Yes ; it is on the Binaturi River,
2457. That is the western extreme ? Yes.
2458. What is the other extreme point ? The Bamu River.
2459. By Mr. Douglas : Have you ever been in Dutch New Guinea territory ? Only on the border.
2460. How far is the Bensbach River from that ? It is right on the border.
2461. Have you heard anything about the approaches to that river ? I think the approaches are very
bad. I know Pim was there.
2462. He used to be your partner ? Yes.
2463. Is there any shelter in the Bensbach ? None whatever.
2464. VYould it be difficult of approach in the south-east season ? Very.
2465. By Mr. Bennett : Bad to get out of ? Yes.
2466. By Mr. Douglas-. It could not be made use of as a port ? No; there is only one place which
could be made a port —that is Darn itself. They have proved that by experience.
2467. At Daru, where you are located, is it possible for any persons to obtain licenses for boats for
pearling? Yes. I had not been in Daru until quite recently. I was away from it for about twelve
months, and during that time they may have passed an Act preventing aliens from obtaining licenses.
2468. But up to that date aliens could obtain licenses for boats ? They could become naturalised.
2469. By Mr. Bennett : Is that done now ? Ido not think so.
2470. By Mr. Douglas: But an alien can get a license to dive ? lam not sure on that point now.
2471. How long is it since you have been in New Guinea ? I have been down the coast for three weeks,
and only recently made a trip to New Guinea.
2472. By the Chairman : What is the system of recruiting in New Guinea—Do you deal with the chiefs ?
No ;we are not supposed to go near the chiefs. 1 send a recruiter.
2473. Have you the permission of the police magistrate to do that? We have a recruiter’s license.
2474. By Mr. Douglas: Is the pearl-shell industry here considered an attractive source of employment
by the natives ? They like it.
2475. What are the wages—£l a month ? £1 a month and clothing.
2476. And tobacco ? Yes.
2477. It is not difficult to get them ? Sometimes it is a little difficult to get them owing to their dances
and ceremonies.
2478. Has there been much sickness among them ? No.
2479. Many deaths? No. The death rate has been much greater in New Guinea, where it has been as
high as 17 and 18 per cent.
2480. Then the employment of natives in this industry is beneficial .to the natives ? Tt is beneficial in
every way.
2481. It improves their physique ? lam sure of it.
2482. And while engaged in the industry here they are well looked after so far as medical attendance
and hospital treatment are concerned ? Yes. Of course they feel diffident about going to the hospital,
but I think they are getting over that difficulty by building a purely native house for them on the beach.
2483. Are there many New Guinea natives engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? A considerable
number.
2484. Have you any knowledge of how they are adapted to that work ? They are suitable for it,
2485. Are they as suitable as the Australian mainland aboriginals ? They are more reliable, and therefore,
I think, more suitable.
2486. Are they as suitable so far as swimming diving is concerned ? Only a limited number.
2487. Are they good swimmers ? Those who do swim are good swimmers.
2488. Do you think the native of New Guinea is as suitable for working the bech§-de-mer boats as the
Australian aboriginal ? I think he is more suitable, because he is more reliable. He is more trust-
worthy, and does not run away.
2489. Are the New Guinea natives disposed to enter into the occupations of heche-de-mer fishing and
swimming diving ? Not so much as pearl-shelling.
2490. By Mr. Bennett: They prefer the pearling ? Yes.
2491. 1 suppose they consider it a more respectable calling? The beche-de-mer fishing takes them
further south, and they do not care about the cold weather.
2492. By Mr. Douqlas : Do you think there is an unlimited supply of natives in New Guinea for all the
industries here? I think there are quite sufficient for all the requirements of Torres Strait.
2493. Are the natives in the villages where you recruit increasing in numbers ? Those who have been in
the industry for a long time are increasing, as they are better in physique.
2494. By Mr. Bennett : But is the population generally increasing or decreasing? It is increasing in
the villages directly engaged in the pearl-shell industry. The villages only 2 or 3 miles away from
those coast villages are deteriorating, and the natives are dying out very fast.
2495. By Mr. Douglas: Do you attribute that to the better food they get? Yes; regular food and
constant work. .
2496. Is there any native food sent from JSew Guinea tor them wmle they are working here ? Yes.
2497. What class of food ? Sago and cocoanuts ; but they say they do not come here to get that kind of
food—that they can get plenty of it in their own country, and they come here for a change of food.
They like European food.

■ 2498. By Mr. Bennett: But speaking without regard to their likes or dislikes, do you not think that their
\ native food—sago, yams, taro, and so on—would be more suitable for them than rice, tinned meat, and
3. salt beef ? I think it is more suitable for them.
2499. Do you not think it possible that a good deal of the beri-beri which exists among them is due to the
use of European food ? Ido not think so, because the percentage of beri-beri in the eastern end of New
Guinea, where they get all native food, is far greater than here.
2500. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea as to the cause of beri-beri amongst the natives ? None
whatever. Medical men cannot get at the cause.
2501. By the Chairman: Are the yam and taro much cultivated by the natives of New Guinea? Only
in some villages along the coast. In other places they grow cocoanuts and sago, just according to the
soil.
2502. By Mr. Douglas : What charges are there in New Guinea for signing men on? Is. for signing
them on, and 2s. for permission to take them out of the Possession.
2503. No more? No.
2504. What is the form of the signing-on agreement? Just a labour agreement.
2505. When you bring them over here, is there any occasion for them to be re-signed on the shipping
articles here ? No. They have a record in the Shipping Office. A labour note is sent from New Guinea
to the Shipping Master here.
2506. Is that done under some mutual arrangement between the respective Governments ? I take it that
is so.
2507. By the Chairman: Are they not put on the ship’s articles in the Shipping Office here ? Not now.
2508. By Mr. Bennett: They used to be ? Tes. lam not certain as to whether, under the new forms,
they have to be put on the. ship’s articles now; but they used to at one time.
2509. By Mr. Douglas-. Has that been abolished ? Ido not know.
2510. By th 9 Chairman : Is it not compulsory ? Ido not know.
2511. By Mr. Douglas: What is the annual license fee for a boat in New Guinea ? £2 for a boat of 10
tons or over, and £1 for a boat of less than 10 tons.
2512. Will that enable a vessel to work in New Guinea waters? Tes.
2513. By Mr. Bennett: At pearling ? Tes.
2514. By Mr. Douglas : Do vessels that are working from Thursday Island and entering New Guinea
waters need to take out a license in New Guinea ? Tes ; if they go to New Guinea to fish.
2515. There is no reciprocal arrangement by which vessels licensed at Thursday Island can work in New
Guinea waters without having'to take out a New Guinea license, and whereby New Guinea boats
working in Queensland waters are not required to take out licenses at Thursday Island? No. If
Queensland vessels work in New Guinea waters they must be licensed there,
2516. Are there any boats owned by people at Daru working there ? No.
2517. All the vessels working there are Torres Strait vessels ? Tes.
2518. So that the license fee imposed by the New Guinea Government is simply an extra charge on the
license fee the boats pay to the Queensland Government ? Tes.
2519. Do the Queensland boats get any benefits at all from the New Guinea Government in return for
the payment of the fees, or is it merely a case of getting revenue for the Government? Ido not know.
I suppose the charge is made for revenue purposes.
2520. By Mr. Bennett: They get shell in New Guinea waters, do they not ? Tes, but very little. New
Guinea has very little water.
2521. Only in certain months ? Tes; just in the north-west season they get a little shell.
2522. By Mr. Douglas: Have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer industry at all ? No.
2523. By Mr. Bennett: Would the New Guinea Government allow you to recruit Papuans directly for
coloured aliens ? There is nothing to prevent me at present.
2524. Would the New Guinea Government execute an agreement between a Papuan and a coloured
alien ? Tes. That is so now. Of course, he must be naturalised.
2525. Can coloured aliens—Asiatics, for instance—be naturalised in New Guinea at present ? Tes, after
six months’ residence. That was the standard before.
2526. Tou do not know that that has beeAaltered since the Commonwealth came into existence ? No.
2527. Tou think that the Papuans, as a whole, are being improved by being employed in the pearl-shell
industry ? Tes.
2528. What would be the result to them if they were excluded from the industry ? I think it would
have a very serious effect upon them. It would throw them back into the state in which they were
twenty years ago.
2529. Tou believe the effect would bo detrimental ? Very detrimental.
2530. Do you think Papuans would work as cheerfully under white divers as masters as they do under
coloured alien divers ? No.
2531. Tou think they would not prefer to work under white divers ? I think they would not.
2532. Why? That is just my opinion. I think that all coloured races prefer to have a coloured man for
their boss. For one reason, the coloured diver will associate with them more than a white man. Ho will
allow them to sleep in the cabin. A white diver would not allow that
2533. By Mr. Douglas: Is there anything else you would like to say? No. I think you have asked
pretty well everything it is necessary to know.
Alexander Corran, Journalist, examined :
2534. By the Chairman : What are you ? lam a journalist.
2535. Editor of what newspaper ? Editor of the Torres Strait Pilot.
2536. How long have you been at Thursday Island ? Almost twelve years.
'2537. During that time, have you become familiar with the administration of the pearl-shell industry ?
Tes ; I have seen and heard a great deal about it.
2538. I suppose you are aware that there are 164 Japanese divers engaged in the industry ? Tes.
2539. Do you consider that a desirable state of affairs ? From the White Australia point of view, no.
2540. Can you make any suggestion as to the best way of securing the industry for white men ? Not
under the present system.

MINUTES OP ETIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL ANI) BECHE-DE-MER EOTAL COMMISSION.


2541. I wish it to bo understood, with regard to the men at present employed, that there will he no
repudiation—They would he compelled to withdraw gradually? I understand that. The matter has had
a great deal of consideration on the island. In common with others, I have been considering if steps
cannot be taken to place the industry on a more settled basis than it has been hitherto, and to devise a
scheme whereby the disabilities the industry is placed under at the present time can bo removed. The
difficulties in the way of employing white divers and supplanting the Japanese appear to be very great,
and, as a man outside the practical working of the industry, I can make no suggestion for their
solution. About two years ago I interested myself particularly in this matter, with a view to elucidating
it through the columns of the Pilot.
2542. I understand that you have published articles on the subject, which you propose to tender to the
Commission? I can supply you with copies of the two articles published as the result of my inquiries.
2543. Do you tender those now ? Tes. I might make one or two matters a little clearer. The first
paragraph of the article dated 28th July, 190 G, states that “ It is well to secure relief from the stagnant
position in which shellers and residents find themselves.” Those conditions are, of course, thrust upon
us by the change of policy in regard to the employment of labour. I might point out, for your
information, the way in which that appears to me to have been brought about. We had a system of
practically free labour in existence up to the time the Immigration Restriction Act was passed.
Since that Act came into force, labour has been difficult to obtain, as far as Malays and Filipinos are
concerned—a class of people wo used to find of the greatest benefit to the island.
\Witnessproduces extracts from “ Torres Strait Pilot," dated 28th July, 1906, and 18 th August,
1906, respectively. Vide Appendix VIII, Nos. 1 and 2.]
2544. Do you include divers in that labour ? Tes. This class of labour has been practicallv prohibited,
and the shellers, finding themselves in a difficulty in regard to labour, have fallen back on the Japanese;
and the whole of the diving has practically fallen into the hands of the Japanese, and they are considered
to he the real masters of the situation at the present time. Again, Malays being largely eliminated as a
source of labour for crews, resort has been had to Papuans. All these things have interfered with the
prosperity Thursday Island deserves from the pearl-shell industry. In the case of Japanese, it is
admitted that most of their earnings go to Japan, so that this place derives no benefit from their earnings.
The Papuan labourer is taken care of by the Papuan Government, and his money must be paid to him in
Papua.
2545. By Hr. Bennett : And he spends it at Papua ? And he spends it there. You can see from what
I have stated why Thursday Island is lacking in prosperity. The money that used to circulate here
from the industry is now practically taken away from Thursday Island.
2546. By the Chairman : What would you suggest as a remedy ? I was coming to that. Apparently the
establishment of a system of cultivation is the only feasible way in which the difficulty in regard to
working with coloured labour can be entirely overcome.
2547. You mean, of course, cultivation under scientific methods ? Cultivation under scientific methods.
The tendency of the articles we have written is in that direction. We should make a beginning in the
cultivation of the pearl-oyster in Torres Strait, with the view of making it primarily a white man’s
industry. None but white men should be permitted to lease cultivation areas. We should encourage a
white proprietary, so to speak.
2548. One object of the Commission is to ascertain how that can he done ? The difficulty regarding
repudiation, as far as the Japanese are concerned, was considered ; hut as nobody was in a position to
enter upon the work of cultivation it was felt that it was impossible to supplant the coloured man by that
means unless the Government granted us some assistance.
2549. Then you think that the first step necessary to make it a white man’s industry is to secure the
services of a marine biologist ? To secure the services of a practical marine biologist.
2550. I presume you were here when Mr. Tosh was here ? Yes.
2551. You are also familiar to a certain extent with the researches of Mr. Saville Kent ? Tes.
2552. Are you aware of any practical results from the work of the respective men ? I am not. They
have never been made public so far as I can ascertain.
2553. By Mr. Douglas : Do you remember Mr. Pace being here in the employ of Clark and Co ? Tes.
2554. Did you ever see his reports ? I have never seen his reports, and I have never been aware of any
having been published. I have tried to ascertain, but there appears to be none available.
2555. I have an official report which might be useful to you ? I have never seen it.
2556. By Mr. Bennett : Do the articles you have tendered embody the views of your people on the
subject ? Yes. I would like to explain that they are not my views, but are the result of investigations
made by myself from practical men engaged directly in the industry.
2557. By the Chairman : You coincide with the views there expressed ? Yes, for that reason.
2558. You tender the papers in confirmation of your evidence? Yes. The second article is devoted to
the financial aspect of the question. I would like to impress upon the Commission the claims of the
industry for recognition by assistance from the Government.
2559. As a national industry ? Tes. I have ascertained from various sources that the total value of
pearl-shell exported from here since records have been kept is getting on for nearly £6,000,000.
2560. By Mr. Douglas: That does not include beche-de-mer, turtle-shell, and other marine products—
It is the value of the pearl-shell alone ? Yes.
2561. Does it include pearls ? No ; there is no record of pearls. From the time records were first kept
—which, as nearly as I can remember, was 1881—the Customs revenue of the port has varied from
£12,000 to £28,000 per annum.
2562. That is the Customs revenue alone, exclusive of other fees and collections ? Yes.
2563. By Mr. Bennett : What was it last year ? It was down to about £13,000. Taking a period of
twenty years, over which the total revenue would average £20,000 per annum—that is £400,000 in all—
the expense of administering Thursday Island—exclusive of defence, which would have to be spread over
the whole country, and including the cost of constructing the jetty—has been for the same period about
£150,000.
2564. By Mr. Douglas-. About how much did the jetty cost? About £46,000; but lam not quite sure.
That leaves about a quarter of a million to the credit of the port in the Treasury, so that the industry has
been a valuable asset to the country, which should entitle it to a Government outlay of £5,000 or
A. Corran.
11 June, 1908.


A. Comm.
II June, 1908.
£lO,OOO, which would benefit not only Thursday Island but the different settlements all round Torres
v Strait instead of having it confined to Thursday Island. It would not be too much to ask the Government
I. even for £lO,OOO to put cultivation on a really good basis.
2565. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think that either £5,000 or £lO,OOO would be sufficient? I think so.
It would at least settle the question of whether cultivation can be carried on successfully or not. Ido
not know whether the Commission are taking evidence with regard to the employment of aboriginals in
the b£che-de-mer business.
2566. By Mr. Douglas : Oh yes ? A point which has impressed itself upon me is the peculiarity that
on the one side of the Peninsula, at Mapoon, the Government have a station with a missionary in charge,
and on the other side of the Peninsula another station is about to be established under Government
control entirely. At Mapoon the recruiting of aboriginal labour for the beche-de-mer fishery or swimming
diving is practically prohibited, while on the other side the Government are evidently facilitating as much
as possible the recruiting of labour for those industries. To the onlooker the Government appear to be
pursuing two entirely different policies.
2567. By the Chairman: Is the prevention of recruiting due to the Government or to the missionaries ?
It is evidently done under Government regulation.
2568. By Mr. Bennett : Are you aware that Mapoon is part of an aboriginal reserve under the Aboriginals
Protection Act? Tes ; and I understand that the other area is similarly a reserve.
2569. Are there any other mission stations besides Mapoon on the same side of the Peninsula ? Tes ; at
YVeipa, on the Embly Kiver, on the Mitchell River, and I think they are starting one on the Archer
River.
2570. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think it is wise to allow the Japanese to recruit aboriginals ? Ido not.
I do not think it is wise for any coloured man to have anything to do with .the aboriginals—and many
white men, for the matter of that.
2571. Do you think that the method that has been employed in assisting the aboriginals of Torres Strait
to acquire boats of their own will tend to their future prosperity ? Not altogether. It is already
beginning to show difficulties, and, so far as I can ascertain, it is tending to make them careless. Once
they clear off their boats they begin to get lazy, and 1 have heard that, instead of looking after the food
supplies in their islands, they reckon that all they have to do,'when food is running short, is to go
out and pick up a little shell, bring it in and get money for food. It tends to an irregular, indolent
life.
2572. Do you think they would be suitable for the pump boats ? Excellent.
2573. You could hardly get better ? I could not say.
2574. By Mr. Bennett : Do you not think that teaching those natives to own and work boats for their
own and their people’s benefit will be beneficial to them as a people in time ? Yes. I have a great
admiration for the theory myself, but the immediate practical result is what I have stated.
2575. As a man of the world, would you expect an experiment of that kind to be decided in four years ?
No. I would hardly expect any other result than what is seen. The same result might be expected in
the case of any people under the same conditions.
2576. By Mr. Douglas-. Is it desirable that they should be assisted to own boats of their own, seeing
that they do not dispose of their own produce ? That is one of the safeguards for them. That the
Protector is a man very capable of acting in a business-like way for them does not always follow. The
best results may not always be attained.
2577. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you consider it is advisable that these people should be helped upwards as far
as possible in the scale of civilisation ? I consider that any people should be assisted as far as possible
to rise in the scale of civilisation.
2578. By Mr. Douglas-. Is it advisable to place the coloured man on the same level as ourselves ? It is
a very difficult question to answer. Ethically, I should say, “Tes,” apart from the fact that experience
teaches me that you have to make distinctions between yourself and another, and it appears to me that we
have to make the distinction with those people that they are an inferior race and require to be assisted.
2579. By the Chairman : That opens up a very big question ? A very big question indeed.
2580. By Mr. Bennett: You would not say for a moment that they should be required to remain as they
are ? No. I have already stated that I believe in lifting them up in the scale of civilisation.
2581. But that process must be gradual? It cannot be done in a generation, or in two or three
generations.
2582. By Mr. Douglas: Do you not think they would be as happy and contented and would earn as
much money working on wages for Europeans as they would in working their own boats in a half-hearted
sort of way? I think they should be free to accept or decline employment as they choose.
2583. By Mr. Bennett : Have you ever attempted to obtain a record of the value of pearls exported from
Thursday Island ? I did once, but 1 found it was useless, and 1 gave up the attempt shortly after I
started. The nearest information I could ever get w T as based on statements made by the owners of the
bigger luggers, and they calculated that, taking an average, the value of pearls was about 10 per cent, of
the value of shell raised.
2584. You have said that the industry should be in the hands of our own race—ls not the industry
really in the hands of our own race at the present time ? Not altogether.
2585. I mean all the means of prosecuting the industry ? Not altogether.
2586. Are not the vessels owned by Europeans? Yes; that may be granted, but there are outside
influences.
2587. That is what we want to get at ? The point to ray mind, so far as operations in Torres Strait are
concerned, is to reduce the cost of production.
2588. That is getting away from my question somewhat —The means of production at present are
undoubtedly the plant used in obtaining the shell ? Yes.
2589. Is not that plant mainly owned by Europeans ? Yes.
2590. Practically all the labour employed on that plant —the divers and crews—are entirely alien ?
Practically entirely alien.
2591. Supposing it was proved that cultivation was successful as a means of propagating the pearl-
oyster, what labour would be employed, European or coloured alien ? I take it that an area being held
by a European, he would be able to work with local native labour simply.
84
MINUTES OP EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL I SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER ROTAL COMMISSION.


2592. Do you contemplate employing white labour in connection with the working of the industry ?
I contemplate that a certain proportion would he white labour. ,
2593. A larger proportion than at present ? Yea. If cultivation were successful, you would have to 1
employ intelligence, and the white man would be best where intelligence is required.
2594. In certain branches more intelligence than the coloured man possesses is required ? Yes; in
certain branches.
Edward Temple Curtis, Sub-Collector of Customs, Thursday Island, examined :
2595. By the Chairman : What are you ? Sub-Collector of Customs, Thursday Island.
2596. How long have you held that position ? Just two years now. ,
2597. In addition to your duties as Sub-Collector, do you perform any duties for the State? Yes. 1
2598. What are they ? Wo collect the fees for licenses to divers and persons in charge and for boats.
We also collect pilotage and harbour dues, and the rent for the jetty.
2599. All the other duties in connection with the pearl-shell fishery are performed by the Inspector of
the Pearl-shell Fishery ? Yes.
2600. Would it be more convenient for the public if all licenses in connection with the pearl-shell
industry were issued by the Inspictor of the Pearl Fishery ? I cannot see that there is any inconvenience
to the public now, because the tw r o offices are in proximity to one another. At the same time, I think
it would be better if the Inspector of the Pearl-shell Fishery, or some State officer, had the issuing of all
licenses. Ho would then know exactly what was going on. At present, a man may come to mo for a
license for a boat, and that boat may not have been inspected by the Shipping Inspector.
2601. And it is possible that the applicant may get a man on board without the knowledge of the Shipping
Master ? Yes. He may be a man in charge who is not licensed.
2602. So that in your opinion it would be better if the issuing of licenses were transferred to the Inspector
of the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer Fisheries ? Yes.
2603. By Mr. Douglas : Can you give us any official statistics respecting the revenue collected at this
port for the Federal Government ? For what term ?
2604. For the last ten years ? I doubt whether I could do that, because a lot of our records have been
destroyed.
2605. Can you give us the information for each year since 1901 ? If you will furnish me with a list of
the particulars you require I will do my best to supply the information.
2606. By Mr. Bennett : Can you supply us with information as to the correct weight and value of pearl-
shell exported each year since 1901 ? I think so.
2607. Can you, in supplying that information, show the proportion of shell between the limits of 5 inches
and 6 inches ? No* Export entries are simply passed for mother of pearl-shell.
2608. Do the Customs now examine the shell ? No.
2609. Can you give us the aggregate weight and value of the beche-de-mer exported during the same
period ? I think so.
2610. And tortoise-shell ? And tortoise-shell. Ido not know exactly what books were destroyed, but I
will work back and try to get you the information you desire.
2611. Is there any possibility of your being able to give the Commission the value of pearls exported
during any period ? No ; it is utterly impossible to give that information.
2612. Can you suggest any means of getting that information ? I think the only way would be to
prohibit the exportation of pearls unless they are first declared at the Customs, and to refuse to allow any
letter containing pearls to go through the post office unless the sender gets a pass from the Customs.
Even then the information available would be incomplete, because some pearls would be carried by hand.
2613. It might be made imperative that an export entry should be passed for all pearls exported through
the post office? Yes. At the present time the post office simply registers a parcel for Sydney,
London, or somewhere else, and that is the end of it, because the officials do not know what the parcel
contains.
2614. By the Chairman : You suggest that the issuing of licenses for boats, divers, and persons in charge
should be transferred to the Inspector of the Pearl-shell Fishery —Do you think that he should also issue
licenses to persons dealing in pearls ? I would put everything connected with the industry under that
officer, and then he would know exactly who was licensed and who was not.
2615. By Mr. Bennett : Can you give the Commission the gross revenue collected at this port for the
period from 1901 to the present time, distinguishing Commonwealth from State revenue; tFe value of
goods imported from oversea for the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer industries under the headings of diving
apparatus, diving hose, metal cordage, anchors and chain cables, muntz metal in sheets, copper or metal
rods, canvas, paints and oils ? Yes ; if you will give me a list of the items you require, I will have the
information prepared at the first opportunity.
2616. Do you remit the receipts from licenses under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act to the
State Treasury through the Collector of Customs ? I pay them to the Collector of Customs under a
separate heading as State revenue.
2617. You also make a declaration as to the collection of that revenue in a return to the State Auditor-
General, do you not ? Yes.
2618. So that, as far as you can judge, those receipts go direct to the State revenue ? They go direct as
far as I know’ but I have no means of telling. I get a receipt for the money as State revenue from the
Collector of Customs, and that is checked by the State auditors.
2619. By Mr. Douglas : What is the present system with regard to the issue of licenses for boats and
divers? The issue of licenses is stopped.
2620. No further licenses are being issued ? No further licenses of any sort.
2621. But renewals can be issued ? No; not after 31st May. My instructions were that no new licenses
or renewals should be issued after 31st May. .
2622. By Mr. Bennett-. Does that apply to all licenses? All licenses. Subsequent to that instruction
I was advised’that I could issue four licenses for boats which were then being built, but only two of
those boats have taken out licenses. 1 think the other boats are being built on “ spec.”
2623. By Mr. Douglas : Have they been completed ? No.
2624 Do you know of any other boats being built on the slip ? xdo not know officially.
2625 Prior to the stoppage of licenses, any person at all could obtain a license for diving ? Yes.

E. T. Curtis.
11 June, 1908.
■ 2G2G. No medical certificate is required ? No.
\ 2627. Any person could ask for a license and get it ? Yes.
2628. Do you think it would be a good thing to require a diver to obtain a medical certificate ? It would
bo a good thing for the diver’s own sake if he was required to obtain a medical certificate of fitness before
being licensed. There have been many deaths since I came here, but whether they were due to diving in
deep water or physical weakness I could not say.
2629. By Mr. Bennett : Will you, when supplying the information already asked for, include the amount
collected for half-yearly pilotage ? Yes.
2630. Do you collect any rents for cultivation areas ? No. As far as I know, only one person has been
granted a lease, and that was granted in Brisbane.
2631. There is a distinction made between the licenses issued to divers and persons in charge, is there not ?
Tho license is practically the same, A diver can be in charge. The “in charge ” licenses are mostly
taken out for the beche-de-mer boats ; but where there is a diver he is generally in charge.
2632. Is’provision made in the Act for the issue of licenses in that way, or is it merely a custom of the
office ? The Act provides that there must be a diver’s or an “in charge ” license.
2633. To take charge of a vessel engaged in the shelling industry a person has to pass no examination
whatever? No.
2634. Anybody can get a license ? Yes.
2635. Do you think that is a desirable thing ? It rests with the owners of the boats. They will not send
a man along, or take out a license for him, unless they believe he is capable of managing a boat.
2636. They are prepared to entrust their property to him ? Yes.
2637. A record is kept of the boats which are licensed as pump diving, swimming diving, and for
beche-de-mer fishing, is there not? Yes.
2638. A vessel that is being utilised-either for pearl-shelling or beche-de-mer fishing can be transferred to
the other industry without your knowledge ? Yes.
2639. The owners do not have to notify you? No. The same thing holds good with regard to boats
licensed for swimming diving or beche-de-mer fishing.
2640. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that pearl-shelling, beche-de-mer fishing, and swimming diving
should be dealt with under separate parts of any consolidating or amending Act that may be introduced
in order to enable the Act to be administered more efficiently ? I think it would be better to keep them
distinct.
2641. The conditions of pump diving are not the same as the conditions in connection with the beche-
de-mer industry or swimming diving ? No.
2642. There is not so much risk of accident in the beche-de-mer boats ? No.
2643. And the beche-de-mer boats, perhaps, do not require such strict supervision as the pump diving
boats? Nothing like. Of course, some of the pearling boats have one diver, and some have two divers.
It all depends upon where they are working and that kind of thing.
2644 Before a license for a boat is issued, it is necessary to have a declaration of ownership? Yes.
2645. And nobody other than a qualified person, as defined by the Act, is allowed to get a license ? Not
so far as we know.
2646 The report of the Inspector for Fisheries for 1906 referred to what he called “ dummying ” —Have
you any suspicion of that? It has been talked about, but I could not say that it has really occurred,
otherwise I should have reported it to the inspector. But among the Chinese there have been one or
two suspicious “ deals.” For instance, a Chinaman here has got a license in another Chinaman’s name,
the latter being a naturalised British subject at Cooktown. They have similar names, the one being Lai
Fook and the other Lai Foo. The declaration was made at Cooktown, but the boat was built up here and
the declaration was sent up and tho boat licensed here. These boats are mostly beche-de-mer boats.
2647. Do you know if thosemen are partners in the business ? I could not say ; but the suspicious thing is
that the boats go down South beche-de-mer fishing, and they always come up here to refit. If they are
getting good beche-de-mer, as they have been doing during the last two years down South, I cannot seethe
reason for their coming here if they belong to the Cooktown man.
2648. By Mr. Bennett-. Are they relicensed here ? Yes. The only way I can see to stop dummying is
to give the audit inspectors power to demand 'the production of any man’s books, and see the accounts for
certain vessels.
2649. By Mr. Douglas : Supposing they keep their books in Chinese ?
2649 a. By Mr. Bennett : Or if they keep no books at all ? The keeping of books should be made
compulsory. If they keep them in Chinese, they might be compelled to have them translated ; or they
might be made to keep them in English.
2650. You have not seen anything to justify action on your part ? No. I have heard rumours about
dummying, and 1 have watched some of them very closely, and I found out that, if they were dummying,
the boats were registered as British-owned vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act.
2651. Do you think any good might be done in that direction by insisting that the registration required
under the British Merchant Shipping Act should be made under the Pearl-shell and B6che-de-mer Fishery
Act, when it is amended and consolidated ? I should imagine it would come to the same thing, because
a boat which is registered under the Merchant Shipping Act is deemed to be owned by the man who
registers it, and nohody can touch it.
2652. You know that the certificate of British registry is not a certificate of ownership? Not
necessarily; it is not a certificate of title. Still, to get away from that, a man would require to have a
bill of sale.
2653. Supposing registration was provided for under tho Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act, and
that the ownership of a vessel had to be proved up to the hilt before she was licensed, do you not think it
would assist in preventing this dummying ? I do not think so. If they were going to make a false
declaration in oneway under the Oaths Act, they would do the same in another way, and trust to being
able to cover up their tracks if they were dummying.
2654. If it could be done, do you think it should be done ? Decidedly. Put every obstacle in the way
of its being done.
2655. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think tho scale of fees for licensing vessels, by which a vessel of larger
tonnage is required to pay a higher fee than a smaller vessel, is a good one? Paying a high fee, I should

imagine, is a deterrent to having good boats. Owners will naturally keep down the size as much as they
can it the fte is charged according to tonnage.
2650. Do you think that vessels engaged in pump diving should be all alike in that respect, instead of on
a sliding scale as at present ? I think they should be licensed according to the number of divers —one
diver in a boat so much, two divers so much more.
2057. But how would you be able to tell whether a boat had one or two divers ? That would rest with
the inspector. If an inspector issues a license, he knows what each boat has got. A diver signs on
articles as diver for a certain boat.
2058. But supposing that during the year a vessel had two divers engaged? Then I should make them
pay an extra fee. It is hard to get at it, because very often the tender is a “ try ” diver.
2059. By Mr. Bennett: Taking the present system of charging fees as a whole, do you think that it
would be fairer if a uniform charge were made on all pump boats ? I think it would, because it would
give better boats for those engaged in the industry.
2000. At present the minimum fee is £3 ? Yes, for a boat of 10 tons or under.
2001. With a maximum of £2O ? Yes. There are very few boats now that are not over 10 tons. Of
course, swimming boats are a different thing altogether.
2602. AYould you recommend that a uniform fee should also be charged for swimming-diving boats ? Yea.
2603. You think the increased fee is a deterrent to building larger boats ? Yes. They get up to a
certain size, and if they wanted bigger boats for the convenience of the crews they would have to pay an
increased fee. Most of the boats are now about 15 tons.
2001. Or more ? There are very few over that. You may get them 16 or 17 tons.
2005. By Mr. Douglas: Is a larger vessel able to obtain more shell than a smaller one ? ' I do not
think so.
2006. Do you know why they should be increasing the size ? Simply for convenience. They have to go
much further afield now.
2607. Working inshore, they do not require to have the vessels so big ? That is so.
2668. The small boats can get as much shell ? Yes.
2609. So that it really does not make any difference whether a boat is 10 tons or 17 tons—it depends
upon where they are working ? I cannot compare the old boats with the new style of boat. They
practically get the same catch if they work the same.
2670. Are the vessels employed in pump diving suitable for European divers to occupy ? Yes; that is the
new boats.
2671. They are a good class of boat ? They have a very fair cabin which two Europeans could occupy.
2072. Comfortable enough for Europeans ? It is comfortable enough.
2073. By Mr. Bennett : You are a boating man —Would you object to use the same cabin yourself ? I
would not. Of course Ido not say that I know the conditions that they are working under when they,
are out; but I know the cabins. Cabins for Europeans could be made a little larger, because the hold
space is not all wanted.
2674. By the Chairman : The space used by the diver and tender is allowed them, and is not measured
in the tonnage ? In Queensland it is included in the tonnage—that is the trouble. The New South
Wales law allows it off, and bigger boats come up here under smaller tonnage.
2675. By Mr. Douglas : That places Queensland-built boats at a disadvantage, in so far as the builders
might be inclined to curtail the accommodation they were providing for European divers in order to keep
the tonnage down? No; the bigger the accommodation in New South Wales, the less the tonnage.
Here they get no allowance whatever.
2676. Then the New South Wales-built boats provide better accommodation ? Yes; and at the same time
they are of smaller registered tonnage. A New South Wales boat might be a 10-ton vessel with
this allowance, while really she measures the same as a 15-ton or a 10-ton boat here.
2677. By Mr. Bennett-. Of course you are aware that in New South Wales and Queensland vessels are
measured under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act ? Yes.
2078. So that if New South Wales is right, Queensland is wrong, and vice versa 1 Yes. As far as I
know the real difficulty is that the vessels do not carry privies. If they had carried privies they
would have got an allowance.
2079. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you collect the porter tonnage dues under the Port Dues Revision Act ?
Yes.
2680. Under what section of the Act are those dues collected ? Under section 7we collect the half-
yearly pilotage.
2681. Has there not been a proposal made recently to collect dues under another section of the Act ?
Yes; under section 4.
2682. What does that section provide ? That vessels entering the port shall pay 2d. per ton per month.
2683. By the Chairman : That refers to coasters ? Yes ; but it is proposed to extend the provision to
these vessels.
2084. By Mr. Douglas : That is the collection which it is proposed to make instead of the half-yearly
pilotage? Yes. They propose to abolish the half-yearly pilotage, and substitute for it the monthly
payment.
2685. Do you think it possible to collect that charge? No; it is impracticable. I have seen thirty or
forty boats beating up here at night from the west on account of bad weather or dirty water, coming to
anchor, and going away again first thing in the morning.
2686. By the Chairman : Could you legally enforce that charge ? No, I could not legally enforce it.
2087. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think it wise to continue the collection under section 7 ? There is no
other way of doing it.
2688. By Mr, Bennett-. Can the half-yearly pilotage charge be legally enforced ? The section says that
half-yearly pilotage shall be paid by vessels trading in a port, but I have my doubts on the matter.
2689. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you think it would bo a good thing to abolish all those small subsidiary
collections, and make the license fee cover all charges under the Act? I think so.
2690. Leaving out the schooners, the amount of revenue collected under section 7is very small, is it not?
Ido not suppose it is more than between £3O and £4O a year, if it is that much. J think it would b >
better to have only one fee. And I would suggest that a penalty be imposed for non-pajment of the
fee for renewal after a certain period. This year we had considerable trouble in getting some fees in.

■ If licensees were liable to a fine of 10 per cent, for non-payment of the fee within a certain period, that
, kind of thing would not happen.
I. 2691. By Mr. Bennett : A boat may be away fishing at New Guinea when the license fee becomes due?
If a boat is away fishing, there is no reason why the owner should not take out a license.
2692. There is a reason —the Pearl-shell and Beehe-de-Mer Pishery Act requires that a boat and all its
gear must be examined before a license is granted? The Act says those things must be examined every
six months, but it does not fix any particular time.
2693. That is so ; but, in any case, that is another reason for all that work being concentrated in the
office of the inspector? Yes.
2694. By the Chairman : During your time at Thursday Island have you studied in any way the scientific
cultivation of the pearl-oyster? I have not.
2695. Prom what you know of the present conditions of the industry, do you think it can in any way be
made attractive to white divers ? I am hardly qualified to give an answer to that question.
2696. You know that the young New Zealander is brought up to a semi-aquatic life, and is a good
boatman—Do you think that some of those young men could be induced to come here as divers if the
conditions of the industry were altered so as to make it reasonably remunerative ? I think they would
come and try it, but I doubt whether you would get white divers to stop on wages. If they had their own
boat on terms something similar to those on which the native islanders here are allowed to acquire a boat,
I believe they would be prepared to work for themselves, feeling that by a stroke of luck they might get
a valuable pearl, with the proceeds of which they could pay off what was due on the boat.
2697. By Mr. Douglas-. Supposing a school for divers was established, and young white men of good
character and temperate habits were given an opportunity of going into the industry, do. you think the
Government would be justified in helping them to buy boats ? As a trial, it would be a good thing, and
it would afford an opportunity of getting white divers into the industry.
2698. We had a return presented to us by Mr. Costin, the Shipping Master, showing that out of 165
licensed divers 164 are Japanese —That would indicate that diving operations are controlled by the
Japanese, would it not ? I might say that diving is done altogether by Japanese.
2699. In your capacity as Sub-Collector of Customs, have you, in collecting duties on imports, noticed
that there has been a large quantity of Japanese provisions imported ? There is a fair amount of
Japanese goods imported.
2700. Do you know whether the quantity has increased since the Japanese have been working the
boats under the present agreements, under which they provide all the food themselves ? As a matter of
fact, I think the revenue of the port has fallen off a bit during the last two years.
2701. Do you think there is a larger quantity of Japanese foods imported now than there was formerly ?
No, I do not think so.
2702. There is a very fair quantity of Japanese provisions used ? Yes; they are imported by Japanese
firms. I have seen those firms issuing rice, tinned meats, sugar, and flour for the boats.
2703. But there is a large quantity of Japanese provisions imported by Japanese merchants ? There is
a fair amount, but whether it is used in the boats or not I cannot say. I have seen them carting
casks of soy, but whether that is used on the boats or not, I do not know.
2704. Can you ascertain for the Commission what quantities of Japanese provisions have been imported
during the past ten years? The tariff has been so altered in regard to the classification of goods that it
would be very hard to pick out that information.
2705. By the Chairman : I suppose rice is a staple article of food with the Japanese ? Yes; and a big
lot of rice comes in here.
2706. Have you any suggestions you would like to submit to the Commission with reference to any of
the matters dealt with in your examination ? No ; I think I have given you pretty well all I know about
those matters. [For statistics asked for, vide Appendix /A.]

Peesent :
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
Joseph Mitchell, Manager of the Wyben Pearling Fleet, examined:
2707. By the Chairman : What are you? Manager of the Wyben Pearling Fleet, owned by Burns,
Philp, and Co., Limited, of Sydney.
, 2708. How long have you been manager for them ? Before and since the company were trading under
the name of the Wyben Pearling Fleet —altogether nine years.
2709. How many pump vessels do they own ? Thirty-three pump boats.
2710. Are they registered at this port? Some of them are registered in Townsville, some in Sydney,
and I think there are two or three very old boats which are not registered at all.
2711. Have you had any practical experience in the procuring of shell by diving ? None.
2712. But you are familiar with the working of the industry ? Yes. I have had experiences in all
phases of the industry, with the exception of diving.
2713. By Mr. Bennett-. You have been out with the fleets ? Yes; and for the last two years I have
handled the whole of the gear. I am by myself, having only a boy.
2714. By the Chairman-. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now
at work profitably employed without further depleting the beds ? Yes. Of course a good deal depends
even now upon the weather conditions and the prices obtainable for pearl-shell in London. The prices
at present are unprofitable. I consider that the beds would keep a little ahead of the boats at present
working.
J. Mitchell.

88
MINUTES OP ETIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECIHE-DE-MER ROYAL COMMISSION.


2715. Do you consider that the number of vessels employed iu the industry should be limited ? Tes ;
I think they should he limited. ,
2716. How many are engaged now? I think there about 109. 1
2717. Would you increase or reduce that number ? Ido not think it would be necessary to reduce that
number. That number would be increased by the boats already here, if the weather conditions and prices
were good.
2718. By Mr. Bennett -. What do you mean by that? There are a number of boats which are at
present working beche-de-mer, the price of which was better last year than it had been for some time
previously. A number of those boats were previously engaged in pearl-shell fishing, and they have a
pump and all the necessary gear on board for pearling.
2719. By the Chairman: How many boats do you think must be engaged in pearling here? I think
about 140 or 150 pump boats must be employed. Ido not know how many boats may be available out
of the beche-de-mer boats.
2720. On what basis would you suggest that licenses should be issued so that no person shall be unduly
favoured, and so that no monopoly shall be created —Do you understand my question? Yea ; but it is a
matter I should have to consider.
2721. By Mr. Bennett: I suppose you will admit that a monopoly is undesirable ? I admit that a
monopoly is undesirable, as regards both the labour and the owners of boats.
2722. by the Chairman : Well, can you answer my question as to the way in which licenses should be
issued or limited ? lam afraid that is rather a difficult question to reply to without some consideration,
because anything a person might suggest would perhaps affect those who are already licensed.
2723. What effect would a periodical closure of beds have as a means of increasing the supply of
pearl-shell ? I think some of the beds should be closed.
2724. Which beds do you think should be closed ? I should say the Darnley Island beds.
2725. By Mr. Douglas : Have not those beds been closed for many years ? In a sense they have been
closed. My reason for suggesting those beds is that, as far as has been ascertained, shell is very
p’entiful in the deep wafer, where it is partially protected, and the spat from that shell, although the
shell is of inferior quality, wmuld be equally as good as the spat from shell on better ground. The
inferiority of the shell there is accounted for by the nature of the bottom. I think the spat from those
grounds would make towards the Old Ground, and probably down the coast. Perhaps Adolphus Channel
would be more of a centre for the distribution of spat. You have the south-east season for nine months
in the year, as against the north-west season for three months. Therefore, for nine months of the year
the spat would be drifting towards the Old Ground and Endeavour Strait.
2726. Have you any idea what time of the year the fish spats ? I have not, but I have heard that it is
somewhere about September.
2727. By Mr. Bennett: What about the closure of Endeavour Strait ? I do not see what advantage
there would be in closing Endeavour Strait, because the spat coming from the fish in Endeavour Strait
would in all probability not lodge there ; it would be taken down to the Gulf by the strong tides which
set that way.
2728. But with a view, hot so much to collecting the spat, as to allowing Endeavour Strait to recover its
former productiveness? I would be averse to closing Endeavour Strait, because during the strong
north-west season it is about the only place where boats c m go to wmrk and make tucker, and if those
grounds were closed the boats would be tied up. •
2729. By the Chairman : Then you recommend the Adolphus Channel and the Darnley Island beds as
suitable for closure ? Yes, as centres for the distribution of spat.
2730. How long do you suggest that those areas should be closed ? I think that is a matter for an expert
to decide, because he would know how long it takes a shell to mature, and at what time the shell would
really be fit for the market. It might be five years, or seven years, or ten years.
2731. By Mr. Bennett : Do you think that, if the channels southward of Badu and Mua were closed
that would assist in restocking the Old Ground between Badu aud Mua ? Between Badu and Mua ?
2732. Yes; the Badu inshore beds, and the beds round the Hawkesbury Islands, Duncan Group, and
West Islands ? That is practically part of the area which was closed before.
2733. Yes ; West Bock is one of the boundaries ? Yes.
2734. Take it between Goode Island and Badu, and then between Badu and the Farewell Islands ? If
spat were given off by the fish in that area, how far would it go before it was caught by an obstacle, or
before it matured ? The general opinion, as far as I have been able to ascertain, is that, when the spat
comes away from the shell, it must first come to the surface, or to the light of the sun before it fertilises.
2735. Does that spat travel 1 mile, 10 miles, or 50 miles ? You have to find that out. Nobody here is
in a position to say.
2736. Would not the difficulty of spat getting from Adolphus Channel to the Old Ground be more
pronounced ? I recommend Adolphus Channel and the Darnley Island beds because their closure would
do the least injury to the industry. Shell is plentiful there, and, as it is naturally protected to a certain
extent, it would not be difficult to patrol it, whereas it would bo difficult out at Badu aud Hawkesbury
Islands to patrol the ground, because men would always have the excuse that they were going there for
firewood and water.
2737. By the Chairman : Do you think the temporary closure of the Badu ground would interfere with
the industry ? It would interfere with the industry —it would reduce the catch.
2738. By Mr. Bennett-. On the inshore beds? Yes; on the inshore beds.
2739. By the Chairman :To what extent would it reduce the catch ? It is not possible to say—it would
depend upon the weather conditions. If the weather conditions were good, those beds would, perhaps,
not be mis-ed • whereas, if the weather conditions were bad, they certainly would be missed.
2740. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? I think we should be guided
bv an expert in that matter. Of course we consider it should bo 5 inches.
2741. Bu Mr. Bennett-. That is your opinion, is it? That is my opinion, but expert knowledge as to the
size of the shell would be more valuable. ... . _., , ~ , rj , .. . ,
2742. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think divers would pick up 5-inch shell it the limit were faxed at 6 inches ?
Yes ; because they have been so many years picking up 5-inch shell that they have a very fair idea of
what a 5-inch shell on the bottom is. More mistakes wmuld be made m picking up 6-inch shell, as it
Would be more deceptive in size.

minutes or evidence taken before the peabl-sueld and beche-de-mer eotal commission.


J. Mitchell.
12 June, 1908. 1
, 2743. By Mr. Bennett: Cannot a diver distinguish on the bottom whether a shell is 5 inches or 6 inches ?
% No, not exactly ; because in some conditions of the ground the lip is bigger than it is in shell found in
3. other beds.
2744. Do you know whether there is any difference in the position of young shell and that of mature
shell on the bottom ? No.
2745. By the Chairman : 'Do you think any restriction should bo placed on the size of vessels employed
in the pearl-shell industry ? Yes. Competition for labour is very much keener when a large number of
boats is employed. Competition for labour means advances, and where a person has to give advances it
is necessary to devise some means whereby you can give closer attention to your business. You would
want to handle your men from day to day instead of from month to month.
274(5. Taking those matters into consideration, what would you recommend as a suitable size for pump-
boats ? About 18 tons. That is the usual size, though a boat may be a ton or two larger or smaller.
2747. "Would that size afford comfortable quarters for the diver and crew ? Yes; that affords very fair
accommodation.
2748. By Mr. Douglas-. Bearing in mind that smaller vessels would be more advantageous for the
working of inshore beds, do you think that a vessel of 10 tons would afford fair accommodation for a
diver and crew ? I think so, because a smaller vessel does not go so far out.
2749. One of the objects in having larger vessels in recent years has been to go further afield?
Undoubtedly. It does not matter how small a boat is, there is sufficient accommodation, because the
cabin is cut off the hold.
2750. What do you think is the best sized vessel to work inshore beds where there is no heavy weather ?
We have 8-ton vessels working now.
2751. By Mr. Bennett : As a matter of fact, those boats would measure up to 10 tons here, would they
not ? I think they would.
2751 a. By the Chairman ; What is your opinion about the floating-station system — Was it beneficial to
the industry? No.
2752. Will you explain how ? When a large number of floating stations were here shell was getting
scarcer. There seemed to be a more systematic working of the beds, owing to the large number of boats,
and, further, it was very costly. The industry was npt very profitable.
2753. By Mr. Douglas : Tour company was working on the floating-station system for some years ?
Yes; and we were glad to come ashore when the competition left.
2754. What year was it when you went into the floating-station system? I think it was 1900.
2755. For how many years did you work under the system ? We worked until January, 1900. We
have been ashore for over two years now.
2756.. You found the expenses of working the floating stations very heavy? The expenses were
enormous as against the catch of shell that we were getting, on account of its scarcity.
2757. Do you remember whether, when you first went in for the floating-station system, shell was more
plentiful on the Old Ground ? Yes. Our catch each year fell off considerably.
2758. Until you decided to give up the system? When the other fleets decided to go to the Aroe
Islands, the catch was really a collapse. '
2759. Do you think the beds have been worked to a non-payable limit ? Undoubtedly.
2700. And it was absolutely necessary to reduce expenditure in every way ? Yes.
2701. »At the time, a large number of the fleets left Torres Strait for other waters, and when it was
necessary for your fleet to work from the shore, did you hold the opinion that the Old Ground and other
beds had become partially denuded ? Undoubtedly. The Old Ground had become very much denuded
because the boats were working there at every possible opportunity they got, on account of the better
shell.
2762. Do you think the partial denudation of the beds was one of the reasons why the fleets had to go
further afield ? I think they left because they thought they would do far better. Undoubtedly they
left for monetary reasons.
2763. Were the labour conditions severe at that time? No, we have never had any trouble with regard
to labour. We have never been refused a permit.
2764. By Mr. Bennett: Even under the Commonwealth? Even under the Commonwealth.
2765. By Mr. Douglas-. The Commonwealth Government have dealt very fairly with you? Very fairly.
In putting in an application I have always gone to a little trouble, giving the number of boats, the
number of men employed, and their nationalities, and they are able to confirm the figures at the office
here. Ido not know whether they ever do confirm them; but our applications have never been
questioned, and after a month or two we have always received permission. We have always been
reasonable, and shown that the men we applied for were necessary.
2766. At one time the competition for Japanese divers was rather keen amongst employers ? Yes—keen
for good men.
2767. That led up to the giving of large advances to the divers? Yes.
2768. Are any advances given now ? None that lam aware of.
2769. No doubt the giving of large advances was detrimental to the successful carrying on of the
industry? Undoubtedly. A man got his six or twelve months’ wages, and before he went to work it
was all spent; and it was impossible to handle the men satisfactorily under such circumstances.
2770. The men were dissatisfied ? Yes. They would go out for a month or two, and then they would
want to come in, or they would want some money for something or other; and it was just a continual
row from the beginning of the year to the end as to how little you could give a man and how much he
could get.
2771. By Mr. Bennett : No doubt some of the men thought they were working for nothing? After they
went out they were of the opinion that they were working for nothing.
2772. By Mr. Douglas : As the beds became depleted, working became more difficult under the floating-
station system ? Yes.
2773. The boats were more scattered, and it was more difficult to keep them together? Yes.
2774. They had to prospect for shell ? Yes; you would have to give a boat a week or a fortnight’s
tucker, and tell them to go and look for shell.
2775. And, owing to the boats being scattered, you got no pearls p We got very few pearls. The shell
was opened or tampered with before we got it.
90
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER ROYAL COMMISSION.


2776. Is there no penalty attached to the opening of shell by the divers, or was there at that time ? Tes,
there was a penalty of £5 for each shell opened.
2777. Was it possible to enforce that when shell was a week old and opened of itself? It was
impossible, because the weather conditions would open the shell naturally.
2778. So that, altogether, you found the floating-station system was not beneficial to the owners ? No,
and we were very glad to abandon it and dispose of the schooners. I hope the system has been
abandoned for ever.
2779. Do you think that, if the system were reverted to, the shelling-grounds would be again over-fished?
Yes, if the boats were to increase.
2780. There is some talk of the floating stations coming back to Torres Strait—Do you think that would
tend to the depletion of the beds again? Yes, because I consider the Old Ground has not had time to
recover, and it would be detrimental to tbe young shell coming on there. There is a large quantity of
undeveloped shell on the Old Ground, just as there was a few years ago.
2781. Do the divers report that the bottom is becoming plentifully stocked again ? They have not this
year—they have had no opportunity; but last year they told me there was plenty of young shell.
2782. Do you think they would take up young shell ? I do not think so, unless they were very
undecided as to the size; but we find that the proportion of “ pairs ”of shell is getting smaller every
year.
2786. The “ pairs ” are the shell between 4£ and 5J inches ? Yes.
2784. I suppose your boats are all manned by Japanese divers ? Yes. Under the present system the
divers are not keen on taking up small shell. They prefer to take up shell that has the weight. They
are paid by weight, and there is as much labour in picking up a small shell as in picking up a big one.
2785. Do you think they will pick up the small shell for the sake of the pearls ? No.
2786. You do not think they would wilfully destroy small shell for the sake of the pearls ? Ido not
think so. Our experience of schooners showed that the percentage of small shell taken up was almost
nil.
2787. By the Chairman: Do you attribute the partial depletion of the Old Ground to the floating station
system ? Yes; and to the beds being overworked.
2788. How many white divers are at present employed? None that lam aware of.
2789. All the divers are Japanese ? There may be one or two Manila men or Malays. Mine are all
Japanese.
2790. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think it advisable to limit the tonnage of vessels employed in the
pearling industry, with a view to making the beds more permanent and the industry more satisfactory
to people interested in it ? If the number of boats were to increase, I would be in favour of no
restriction as to tonnage; but, if the number of boats were to be increased to any extent, we would either
have to abandon our present system of working or go afloat again to hold our own. If another 100
boats came back here, we would probably have to go afloat to look after our business, because we
would find the competition for our divers would lead others to offer them advances, and we would have
to do the same or give up the business.
2791. Supposing the number of boats was limited to 100 ? With the present number available here, I
do not think there is any necessity for floating stations.
2792. Under those circumstances, would you recommend a limitation to the maximum tonnage of boats ?
Yes. But would that apply to the beche-de-mer industry, too ?
2793. By Mr. Bennett-. No; simply to the pearl-shell industry ? Well, I would say the maximum should
be 25 tons. That would give an owner an opportunity of having a large vessel to send out stores to his
boats at any time, and bring in the shell—a sort of cargo boat.
2794. By Mr. Douglas: Would not a vessel of 25 tons be able to work a fleet of six boats ? It would be
too costly.
2795. How many boats could be profitably worked as one fleet under the present system of working from
the shore ? I think the more boats a person has the more economically he can work, because his
management expenses and a certain amount of his other expenditure are the same for thirty boats as for
six.
2796. By Mr. Bennett-. That is his office expenses ? His own salary and management expenses. If
you put him down even at £3OO a year, with a fleet of six boats, that is an annual cost of £5O against
each boat, whereas, if he is workiug thirty boats, the cost against each boat is only £lO. That is a
reduction of £4O for each boat he is working.
2797. By Mr. Douglas -. Since you have been here have there been any Europeans working as owners
and divers—There have been the Andersens and the Collesses, for instance ? There are the Andersen
Brothers.
2798. How many boats have those men been working, doing their own diving ? They were not doing
their own diving? The Collesses never dived in my time, and neither did O. K. Parkes nor Walton. I
think the Andersens had three boats. They were not all hero at the one time. They were scattered.
There would not be an average of more than three boats. They had some over at New Guinea.
2799. By Mr. Bennett -. Could not the owners prevent the taking of young shell. Not unless they were
to increase the limit a little bit with the diver. That is the only way.
2800. The owners could say that they would not take any “pair” shell? They could say that they
would not take it; but the proportion of that shell is very small. Ido not suppose we have more than
two cases of small shell in 100.
2801. Do you not think it is desirable that owners should help to conserve the industry ? Undoubtedly,
both in their own interest and in the interests of the Island generally.
2802. Could they not take some steps to prevent the depletion of the beds by the taking of young
shell ? I think some owners would carry that out effectually, but others would not; and it would not
be fair for some owners to do it while others reaped the benefit. It is best for all to be on the same
basis. There is no inducement really for the divers to bring in small shell.
2803. The average number of luggers attached to a floating station was about sixteen ? Sixteen or
sfivPTififtftn
2804. What is the smallest-sized vessel that could be employed to work such a number of luggers success-
fully? About 90 tons would be the smallest. That has been done.

J. Mitchell;
12 June, 1908.
2805. You consider the floating-station system is detrimental to the conservation of the industry? Yes ;
* and to the community on the Island.
i. 2806. What are the conditions under which boats are worked from the shore ? They are worked on
what we call the “lay” system. The shell is taken at a value of £B2 10s. for under 4 tons, and £B7 10s.
for 4 tons and over, both cleaned net weights. The owner deducts from that the expenses on account
of wages, victualling, and the diving dresses and underclothing.
2807. The whole price of the diving dresses ? Yes; and the difference is the “ lay” of the diver. If he
brings in a big catch of shell, and the expenses under those headings are small, he has a bigger wage. If
he brings in very little shell, and those expensi s are deducted, he may have nothing. So he is practi-
cally on piece work. •
2808. The crew are engaged by the owner ? The crew are engaged and paid by the owner, although wo
have a provision in the articles that the divers cannot force us to find crews for them. We have that
provision on account of some of the divers being very hard to handle, and being very severe on the men.
It may not suit us to pass a roan out, but our men may object to work for him, so wo are in a position to
say to him : “ Our men do not want to work with you. If you want to work, you must get your own
crew.” We have practically no difficulty, but still that provision is put in in our interests.
2809. The owner then is responsible for the payment of the wages? Yes. In our case we pay every
man. Every man has an account in our ledger, and he handles every penny.
2810. But that is deducted from the diver’s lay? Yes.
2811. Then, if the diver is unsuccessful, the owner has to bear the loss as regards the wages? That does
not concern the crew. The owner must pay the crew, according to the articles.
2812. Is that provision in any way evaded? Not as regards our fleet.
2813. I mean generally ? Not that lam aware of. I could not state any instance.
2814. Are the conditions under which you obtain indented labour excessively stringent? No. I think
the tendency has been to become more liberal as regards the conditions. The difficulty before was in
finding bonds for a large number of men. The Commonwealth authorities have placed the limit now at
£l,OOO. For any one man absconding, you are liable for £lOO, but in no case for more than £l,OOO.
2815. By the Chairman-. You have already stated that the divers are all Japanese? Yes.
2816. Do you consider that a desirable state of affairs —socially, industrially, and commercially? We
have to employ men who will make the industry profitable, and the Japanese have undoubtedly proved to
be the best men as regards the winning of shell.
2817. Would it not be desirable and more consistent with the aspirations of Australia if we could secure
that work for men of our own race ? The industry would require assistance to do that.
2818. Similar to the assistance given to the sugar industry ? It could be done by a bonus, but there are
difficulties attached to that system in connection with our industry, which are not found in connection
with the sugar industry.
2819. Cannot the industry be made more attractive to white men by an improvement in the present
conditions and an amendment of the law ? It could be made more attractive undoubtedly.
2820. Can you suggest any method for making it more attractive, always with the understanding that any
change must be brought about by a process of evolution ? lam of opinion that it could be done by
giving a bonus. There could be no definite amount fixed for a bonus based on London prices, owing to
the product being sold in the world’s market, where it has to compete with shell raised by cheaper
labour. The whole thing comes back to pounds, shillings, and pence—whether it will be profitable or
unprofitable.
2821. Do you consider the white man capable of performing the duties of a diver—Has he proved his
capacity in that direction ? It is possible fora white man to dive—there is no doubt about that; but
diving is harder on a white man than on a coloured man.
2822. By Mr. Bennett : Do you say that from your own knowledge ? Well, according to my knowledge,
he cannot stand the strain so well, and in a few years he is worn out. Again, he is not likely to be as
successful as the Japanese, because the Japanese is a fatalist. If a Japanese is paralysed, his countrymen
alongside of him go on diving just the same.
2523. Have not white divers carried on the industry before ? That was before my time.
2824. But you know that that has been the case ? Yes, it has been. The only reply I have to give to
that question is—Why are they not here to-day if they were successful ?
2825. By Mr. Douglas-. You have had no experience in the employment of white divers? None
whatever.
2826. By the Chairman-. Do you think that with a bonus white men would undertake the duties of
diving? Yes, with a bonus, if we could get the right class of men.
2827. We are assuming that they are strong physically and in sound health ? If the industry were made
attractive from a monetary point of view, that might bring the right class of men.
2828. What amount per ton of shell raised would you suggest as a bonus ? I would say £5O a ton.
2629. Do you mean a bonus of £5O per ton for each ton raised by a white man ? For each ton raised
up to a maximum of 4 tons —no bonus for any shell raised over 4 tons.
2830. By Mr. Douglas: Do you mean that that bonus of £5O should be paid to the owner, or to
the diver in addition to the “lay” he would get from his employer? It should be paid to the
employer.
2831. Supposing the price of shell in London was £l5O a ton, and a man owned his boat absolutely, free
of all debt, and his catch of shell was 4 tons in the year, what would you estimate would be his earnings ?
He would make about £l2O a year.
2832. Would he not make more than £l2O ? No ; and out of that he would have to pay for the
depreciation of his boat.
2833. Working on a “lay” of £25 per ton, what would a Japanese earn? He would not earn more
than £lOO a year.
2834. According to that estimate, the owner of the boat would make not more than £25 a year ? My
reason for suggesting a £5O bonus is that the price of shell in London is an unknown quanity. It is up
and down, and you cannot pay a bonus on the price realised for one man’s shell, which may be £l5O
a ton, while another man’s shell may realise only £l3O a ton, though the shell in the one case may be
as good as in the other. The difference would be due to the shell coming into the market at different
times.

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEAEL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE ROYAL COMMISSION.


2835. For how many years would you suggest the bonus should be paid ? I would pay it on a sliding
scale for five years. Each year the men would improve. If a man made money the first year, then
better men would come along. You would get a better class of men if they came voluntarily than if you
sent for them.
2836. If the present number of boats is not increased, do you think the catch would improve much at the
end of the fifth year ? Yes; if the number of boats is not increased, the grounds will undoubtedly make
a little headway.
2837. If the number of boats is not increased, do you think that, at the end of five years, a white man
would get more than 3 tons of shell in a year ? I would not put it as low as 3 tons. If he got 4 tons,
he would make a coloured man’s wage.
2538. Then he might get pearls? A man could not go into the industry and reckon on getting pearls.
He has as good a chance of getting pearls as he has of getting a prize in “ Tattersall’s.” It is not as if
each man got his percentage of the whole take of pearls. One man might get pearls worth £l,OOO, and
another might get none.
2839. Do you not think that if a man got a catch of 5 tons he would stand a chance of getting some
pearls ? The bigger the catch the better the chance of getting pearls.
2840. In your estimate of £l2O, you did not include pearls ? No. He could not go to a business house
and say, “ I have a chance of getting £ICO or £l,OOO worth of pearls,” and ask for an advance on that
chance.
2841. Even if a man got only £l2O a year clear, would not the chance of getting pearls be an inducement
to go into the industry ? Yes ; but his chance of getting pearls would be no inducement to, capitalists
to finance him.
2842. By the Chairman ■ Are your answers based on the assumption that the white man is working for
an employer? No; on the assumption that he is working for himself.
2843. Supposing three white men became possessed of a pump boat, and that in the course of time they all
became expert divers, and one relieved the other, how would that work? They would not make as good
an average as one man in one boat.
2844. lam speaking of one boat owned by three men, each of whom is a diver ? Ido not think they
would do so well.
2845. By Mr. Douglas : It lakes a man all his time to work one boat in shallow water ? One diver can
work a boat in shallow water just as successfully as two divers in one boat. One diver can practically
get as good a catch as three divers in one boat.
2846. The diver can remain on the bottom practically all day ? That is so, and three divers cannot work
from one boat at the same time.
2847. By Mr. Bennett-. Then the three-diver system is confined to deep-water grounds? Yes.
2848. I was under the impression from what I had heard that the system was general ? No. If a diver
gets sick, of course another man takes his place, and the work goes on, so that it is an advantage to have
two men in a boat who can dive.
2849. But not necessarily as divers ? No; but it is an advantage to have a second or even a third man
who can dive.
2850. White divers who owned a boat would have a white tender, would they not ? A white man might
prefer a good coloured man as his tender.
2851. Knowing the predilection of men for men of their own nationality, do you not think it would be
necessary to have a white tender for a white diver ? I would not force him to have any particular man
as a tender. With white divers I would leave the choice of tenders an open question,, as some men might
prefer to have good trained Eotumah men instead of inexperienced white men.
2852. By Mr. Douglas: You have had some experience in the collection of pearls? Yes.
2853. Working a fleet of fifteen boats, for a period of three years, what do you estimate would be the
annual take of pearls? From £BOO to £l,OO0 —about £6O per boat per annum. If we got £l,OOO
worth, we would do very well.
2854. That, added to your previous estimate of £l2O, would increase the earnings of the divers? It
would if all the pearls were divided equally.
2855. Then your estimate would be about £lBO a year ? That is if he got his share of the pearls.
2856. If he got the whole value of the pearls, that would be a fair average for him to reckon on ? You
could not reckon on that, because he might not get any pearls.
2857. Say that fifteen white men were working on boats for themselves, you estimated that among them
they would get pearls worth £l,OOO a year ? Yes, if they pooled them. You might reckon on £5O a
year, because their catch of shell would be probably smaller.
2858. Have you any idea what Japanese divers earn under the present system, by which you pay
from £B2 10s. to £B7 10s., allowing for any pearls they might get ? About £l2O to £l4O a year.
2859. Is that including what they would get for pearls ? Yes.
2860. Does that not seem pretty low ? No. Last year some divers made £5OO and £6lO. They got
a big whack of pearls, while other divers we had ended in debt. It is very difficult to make an estimate.
2861. It varies from nothing up to £5OO or £6OO ? From being in debt up to £5OO to £6OO. If a
diver does not get 3i tons of shell, he is in debt at the end of the year.
2862. You were speaking of having to compete in the world’s market with the cheap labour of other
pearling grounds You do not suggest that the crews of the vessels should be white men? Even with a
coloured diver, a coloured tender, and a coloured crew, on the basis of last year, no money was made by
the owners.
2863. The price of shell has been low of late? Yes. A few years ago it was higher.
2864. What are the present rates of pay to tenders and crews? They vary—tenders £4 a month,
Japanese crew from £1 10s. to £2 12s. 6d.; New Guinea boys cost us £1 each a month, in addition
to which we have recruiting expenses, clothing, and tobacco, so that they cost us £1 10s. a month. If
there are many deaths among them it would cost us £1 12s. In arriving at the diver’s lay we
estimate a New Guinea boy at £1 10s., aud the indented Japanese is indented on the articles at £1 10s.
and upwards. We take indenting expenses on a 10s. basis per month throughout. That is, an indented
man costs us £1 10s. a month, and we put him in the estimate at £2. If he gets £1 15s. a month we
estimate him as costing us £2 ss. By the end of his three years he gets £2 12s. 6d. or £2 10s., and he

. is then entitled to his return passage according to our original agreement. If he re-signs on, he signs
on on a £2 12s. 6d. basis, of which he gets the lot, because the owner is responsible for his return passage.
3. 2865. By Mr. Douglas : Do you remit any portion of his money to Japan P
2866. Is the owner obliged to do that under the agreement ? No ; but to avoid any difficulty we have
all the men signed on in Hong Kong.
2867. I think you said the cost of provisioning was taken out of the diver’s “lay”? Tes.
2868. Do you find that the Japanese are using a lot of their own provisions, and that they are importing
J apanese goods ? All our men have a limit of £3 per trip of about ten weeks. When our boats are
fitting out the divers can go where they like and get £3 worth of provisions, bring the bill to us, and we
pay it. That is £3 for each boat, four trips a year.
2869. Have Japanese importations of provisions not been increasing of late under that system ? Ido
not know; but under the floating-station system the Japanese did not get any Japanese provisions.
Then again, at that time the crews were more mixed, and there was not the same necessity, as there is
now for getting Japanese provisions. The Japanese, being indented men, are always changing, and
they are not used to English provisions. It is principally soy that they take. Ido not think there has
been any great increase in the importations from Japan.
2870. By the Chairman : Could the Papuans be converted into divers ? No; it is impossible.
2871. By Mr. Bennett-. Would they be suitable ? No.
2872. By the Chairman-. For what reason? If one man got paralysed, or if anything happened to him,
the whole lot would knock off. Even if you could teach them, they would not stay Jong enough. It is
as much as you can do to get them to come for nine months.
2873. Are they satisfactory labourers ? They are not too satisfactory; but, at the same time, we are very
glad to get them.
2874. By Mr. Douglas-. Is there any source of labour available in the Straits, such as Strait islanders, if
Japanese were not available? Ido not think so. The Government have monopolised them.
2875. Do the Government discourage their working as crews on the boats ? I have known instances
where boys have come in from the islands and have wanted to sign on ; and they have come back and
said “Me no want to work company. Government no let me.”
2876. Are they good men at the pump and for general seafaring work ? On the whole, they are not as
satisfactory as the Papuans, because they have been too long idle or lazy.
2877. They are men of good physique? They have good physique; but I think it is easier for them to
avoid a day’s work if they can.
2878. Is that because they are living in their natural element ? Tes ; and I suppose they have as much
food as they want. On the whole, the divers prefer to have the Papuan every time.
2879. If the Government encouraged the Strait Islanders to work for wages on the boats as crews, do you
think they would be suitable ? They would be suitable labour if the men found they had to work to get
a living, and that, if they got out of a job and went home, they would not be able to sit back. They are
in the position that, if they go to work for three or four months, and they are not satisfactory or are
lazy, and you discharge them, they can go back and take things easy. They are not frightened of losing
their job.
2880. Do you know anything of these islanders’boats—Do the natives earn much money ? I have
figured it out from the reports, and I consider, having in view the number of men on the boats, that none
of them earn nearly as much as they would get by working as crews.
2881. It would be more beneficial for them then to work as crews? More money would go into the
islands if they worked on pearl-shelling boats.
2882. And it would give them more occupation ? All coloured men do better with a little supervision.
They work better.
2883. By Mr. Bennett -. Do you know whether, under the former conditions, the money which was earned
by the islanders on the boats went to assist them and their families? I could not say.
2884. Are you aware that it was because the money they earned did not in any way benefit the islanders
or those belonging to them that the present system was introduced ? Ldo not think it has benefited
them.
2885. But are you aware that the money they earned was wasted here ? The men spent their money on
the islands instead of taking it out in tucker.
2886. Did they not spend it beforehand ? lam not aware of that; but I think that could be controlled
by the Shipping Master or the Protector when paying them off. They could see that the money did go to
the islands. The Papuans come over here to earn money. They have no money in their own homes.
2887. Were any boats purchased from your firm for the islanders? lam not certain.
2888. Stores for the islanders used to be purchased from your firm ? A proportion of the stores, but the
smaller proportion. Asa rule the Chinamen get the bulk of it.
2889. Since when ? Two or three years ago.
2890. Can you inform us, without any breach of confidence, what amount of capital stands in your books
for your pearling business ? I cannot answer that question. It does not stand on rny books here.
2891. What would you consider the value of the boats and plant, including stores? I did not answer
your question because different people have different views about depreciation. We are very stringent.
The marketable value of the concern as it stands now is between £17,000 and £lB,OOO. That is stores,
boats, and everything as they stand. The annual cost of running the fleet is between £lB,OOO and
£19,000. Some years it has been £20,000.
2892. The price of shell has been unsatisfactory for a long time ? Yes.
2893. Can you assign any reason for the long-continued depression ? Over production in other centres,
and tightness in the European money market. There is not the same market in Europe for pearl-shell
and articles made of pearl-shell since the Busso-Japanese war. There was a big falling off at the time
of the war, and it does not seem to have recovered since.
2894. Do you think there has been anything in the way of a ring control, and that that has had anything to
do with the low price of shell ? We have always had to contend with a ring. The ring has always been
there, and always will be.
2895. That affects the price of shell ? Tes. One man in the ring alone buys about half the shell. If
he is off the market, there is no business.
94
MINUTES OP EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFOEE THE PEAEL-SHELD AND BECHE-DE-MEB EOTAL COMMISSION.


289(5. Can that difficulty be overcome by control from this end ? No.
2897. The butter business has been largely improved by control from this end? For the last two or
three years we have had an association ; there is an association in Western Australia, and another at the
Aroe Islands. We have united, and have one common London association ; but all we have been able to
do is to try and fix reserves from sale to sale and quantity to quantity. The only thing we can do is to
make an attempt to get a price which will not show us a loss; but it is absolutely impossible to advance
the price so that wo can show a profit. The London combination know pretty well as much as we do
what it costs us to produce shell, and their aim is to keep it down to that price all the time. Ido not
think there will ever be any possibility of improving our position on the London market unless the whole
of the pearl-shelling centres form into one joint stock company.
2898. Do you think the Government could intervene to bring about a more desirable state of affairs ?
The Australian Grovernment —No. They would have to control the Aroe shell and the Manila shell, and
consign it all to one agent in London. That would get over the difficulty.
2899. The take in Torres Strait at present is not sufficient to have a controlling influence on the market?
No ; we are the smallest of the three centres now.
2900. By the Chairman: How many boats have you in the industry ? Thirty-three.
2901. And you expend £20,000 a year in working that number of boats? Our expenses are from
£lB,OOO to £20,000 per annum. That is the average for six or seven years.
2902. I hope you will not consider it an impertinent question if I ask you what are the earnings of the
boats ? I can tell you that on a seven years’ average we have not made any money.
2903. Would you and other employers find it more convenient for the licenses under the Pearl-shell and
Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act to be issued by the Inspector of the Pearl-shell Fishery ? 1 have thought
that all along. I think they should be issued by the Shipping Master. I would confine the whole
business to one office. I would also suggest that the license fee should bo the same'for all boats,
irrespective of. tonnage. That would be far more satisfactory to everybody, because it is a disadvantage
for Queensland or locally built boats, as against Sydney built boats, to have the present system.
2901. It has been suggested that pearling boats should pay under section 4 of the Port Dues Revision
Act—Do you approve of that or of the present system? The monthly harbour dues.
2905. Yes? No; I do not think that is a fair thing. We do not object to pay the half-yearly dues.
That has been the custom, and it has not affected us to any considerable extent.
2906. By Mr. Bennett: Would you approve of a uniform license fee fer all diving boats regardless of
their tonnage ? Yes. If a boat is 18 tons, she will not get any more shell than a boat of 17 tons or
16 tons.
2907. Do you think swimming boats should be charged a similar fee to that charged for diving boats ? I
should say that a swimming boat should be charged about a third of the fee charged for diving boats.
2908. Do you know anything about the Pearl-shcdl and B&che-de-Mer Fishery Acts—You know there is
more than one Act? Yes; a number.
2909. Do you think it would be an advantage to the industry to have all those Acts consolidated and
amended ? Undoubtedly. It would be more advantageous to everybody.
291i>. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience in the propagation of the pearl-oyster by
cultivation ? Not beyond collecting shell for cultivation.
2911. You have collected shell ? Yes.
2912. For your own use ? No; for Lever Bros, and Mr. Savilie Kent.
2913. You have heard a good deal about that experiment ? Yes.
2914. Would you favour making an attempt to propagate the pearl-oyster by cultivation? Yes; lam
in favour of cultivation, because, although we know all about the working of the industry, yet we know
nothing about the habits of the fish, when it spats, or how long it takes to mature. I think if cultivation
were established on a small scale at the start we might gain a lot of valuable information.
2915. If leases of areas for cultivation were offered to individuals, do you think they would be taken up
at the present time ? Only for speculative purposes.
2916. What do you think would be the necessary preliminary to any such experiment ? I think it
would be necessary, in the first place, to have an expert. Then he should go quietly along and obtain
the requisite information regarding the habits of the pearl-oyster. You might go on lines similar to
those of the Agricultural College in New South Wales. I think a biologist, with one or two assistants,
would do a big lot for a year or two, and such work would not be very costly. He would then know
whether the experiment was likely to be successful. It would not do for the Government to rush into
the matter, and establish a big biological college, and then find that it was impossible to do anything.
Although there are any number of reefs which may appear suitable for the cultivation of shell, they
may not really be suitable. After it was proved that cultivation could be carried on successfully, suitable
areas for such purposes could be thrown open to competition.
2917. By Mr. Douglas : Have you seen Mr. Saville Kent’s report on his investigations ? Yes.
2918. Mr. Tosh’s report ? Yes.
2619. Mr. Pace’s report ? No.
2920. From what you have seen in those reports, do yon think scientific cultivation could be made
successful ? Ido not think cultivation would be a financial success. At the same time lam open to be
convinced.
2921. But in the interest of the general welfare of the community, whether a cultivation experiment
was brought to a successful issue or not, do you think the Government would be justified in spending
£l,OOO per annum for ten years on such an experiment ? Yes.
2922. By Mr. Bennett: If the experiment merely settled the question ? Yes ; and three years might
settle the question.
2923. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think such a short period would be a fair test ? I think that in two or
three years you would ascertain whether the shell grows | inch, or whether it increases 25 per cent,
or 50 per cent, in weight, or does not increase at all.
2924. Are you aware that Mr. Pace said he could obtain all the necessary knowledge in three years ?
No; but that is my opinion on the subject. .....
2925. By the Chairman: With a view to experimental cultivation, you consider that the first step
necessary is to secure the assistance of a scientist ? Yes ; that is the primary step. Ido not think the
Government should launch out on a big scale at the start.

2926. By Mr. Douglas: You think the Government ought to be prepared to face the cost of an
( experiment for a number of years ? I think they should be prepared to go on with it for a period of ten
.years to prove its success or failure.
2927. Assuming that some success resulted in from three to five years, and if was then considered that
cultivation could be carried on successfully, do you think that if areas were marked off and reserved for
cultivation in different grounds in the Straits, and were thrown open for occupation in the same way as
land is thrown open for occupation, those areas would be taken up? I think they would be taken up ;
but whether for genuine or speculative purposes I could not say. If it could be shown by a Government
scientist that shell can be cultivated at a fair margin of profit, I think the thing would develop. But
if there was a possible loss the grounds would not be taken up.
2928. Do you think cultivation would decrease the cost of production ? No.
2929. Allowing that you could catch the spat, cultivate it, and bring shell to maturity in shallow waters
around a man’s homestead whore he could raise it when the price of shell in London warranted it, do
you not think he would make a larger profit than he is doing now ? That would be an advantage,
but you must take into consideration the expense of bringing in the young shell, laying it down, and
picking it up again for export. When you can pick up shell on a cultivation area, you can pick it up
outside, and the question for the scientist to decide is whether you can multiply the shell to a great
extent. The picking up of shell is not a matter of time ; it is a matter of tides and dirty water. If
5-inch shell increases in weight 25 per cent, in twelve months, it would pay to take up and put down
that shell. My opinion is that shell is like poultry that is fattened for the market. There is a certain
stage when it is profitable to send poultry to the market, and it is the same with shell. It may be more
profitable to send it when it is 5 inches, and it may be more profitable to send it when it is 6 inches.
2930. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know the difference between the weight of a 5-inch and of a 6-inch
shell ? I have a fair idea from handling them, but I have never scaled them.
2931. What is your idea of the difference in weight—l am speaking of the bivalve, not the round or flat,
merely ? I really could not give you an estimate.
2932. By Mr. Douglas : Have you any knowledge of where the bulk of the shell sold in London goes
to, and for what purpose it is used ? I think the bulk of it goes to France, Austria, and Germany.
A portion of it goes to England. The biggest buyer in London, which is the central market, is a
Frenchman.
2933. Have you sent shell anywhere else but to London? We have sent some to America.
2934. What is pearl-shell used for principally ? For inlaid work on revolver handles, knife handles,
umbrella handles, and so on.
2935. And buttons r Buttons!—l think not the good shell, but inferior qualities. Pearl is cut into
suitable pieces for inlaying revolver handles, and from those pieces there is a quantity of scraps. Those
scraps are made into buttons.
2936. What proportion of the shell is made into buttons? I could not say. There are different buyers
in London for different classes of buttons. No one buyer will buy a mixed parcel, but will select the
particular class of shell he uses.
2937. You have never been at the shell sales? I have never been in London.
2938. Would you be surprised to hear that Mr. Munro, who has been through pearl-shell factories in
Birmingham and elsewhere in England and on the Continent, says that 90 per cent, of the pearl-shell is
used in the manufacture of buttons ? lam surprised at that. I always understood that the high-class
pearl-shell work came first.
2939. Do you think it would be to the advantage of the pearl-shell industry to establish a small button-
making factory in Australia ? There is not the necessary comsumption in Australia. There is not the
population to work on.
2940. Would it not bo possible to export the pearl-shell in a manufactured state to other countries ?
Not profitably, because it is only where you have an enormous output that you can decrease the cost of
manufacture! Ido not think a factory could be worked on a sufficiently large scale to make it pay.
2941. Could not people who use pearl buttons in the manufacture of clothing be induced to purchase
their supplies direct from a factory in Australia ? Ido not think the factory could be worked as cheaply
as in other countries where labour is cheaper.
2942. Why not ? Those who are now engaged in the manufacture of pearl-shell articles elsewhere
handle a largo quantity of shell. You would handle a much smaller quantity in Queensland, and you
would have to secure first-class machinery, engage an expert as manager, and it might be five years before
you could obtain a connection, and even then you would have to give credit.
2943. But is not the difference in price for the manufactured article, as compared with the price of the
raw material, something enormous ? Yes ; but the shell has to go through an expensive process, and it
requires a lot of capital to handle it. Buyers go to London, and they have to pay cash within fifteen
days of the sale, as a rule, and the manufacturers sell the buttons ou credit.
2944. Then you do not think the establishment of a button factory is feasible ? It would not be a very
profitable enterprise, unless it were assisted by the Government.
2945. You know that money has been advanced by the Government for the establishment of central sugar
mills —Supposing the Commonwealth Government assisted the shellers of Australia generally in the
export of shell, or in working the shell up into manufactured articles, do you think that would be a
success ? I think it is quite feasible for the Government to offer some inducement to establish a button
factory, or at any rate to control the market for Australian consumption. If that is done, part of the
shell could be used here for buttons or fancy work.
2946. Do you think that the establishment of a small button factory in Australia would tend to assist the
producers of pearl-shell to obtain a little better price from the manufacturers in the old country ? Ido
not think so. Ido not think the consumption would be large enough.
2947. Would it not tend to enable them to get a better price from the manufacturers ? I do not think
they could establish such a factory. They have little enough capital as it is. I think a factory would be
far more satisfactory iu a big city—Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane.
2948. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience of the beche-de-mer fishery? Not for the last
five or six years.
2949. Have you any suggestions to make relative to the questions you have been asked ? Nothing that
you have not touched upon, with one exception. The Government might assist a few white owners, the

game as they have assisted the natives of the Torres Strait islands —that is to say, by looking after the 1
financial part of the business and supervising the work. lam inclined to think it would have been better r
if the natives’ boats had been given a little more supervision. 1!
2950. By Mr. Bennett : They did well at one time? Tes ; but a native will work well for twelve months
and then he gets lax. He wants somebody to keep him up to the mark all the time.
2951. By Mr. Douglas-. In what way do you think the Government could render assistance? On the
same lines as they assist the islanders.
2952. Assisting white men to obtain boats of their own? Tes; and to employ Torres Strait island
labour. I think it would have been better for everybody if the boats owned by the natives had been
worked with white men in charge, and under Government supervision.
2953. You think it would have assisted the natives if the Government had been represented by having a
white man in charge of each boat ? Tes ; because at present the islanders are left to themselves.
2954. It would be rather expensive to have a man on each of the boats —Would you charge the cost
against the produce of the natives? I believe there are sometimes thirty or forty men on one of the
boats, and that is quite enough for one man to look after when they are working. We have 239 men
employed, if that is of anv interest to you.
2955. By Mr. Bennett : What nationalities are they ? We have 114 Japanese, 3 South Sea Islanders,
3 Malays, and 119 New Guinea Boys.
2956. By Mr. Douglas: Practically the whole of the divers in the industry are Japanese ? Tes.
2956 a. That places them in a very strong position in the event of any dispute? Tes. But'it does
not matter what labour we employed we would be in the same position, because there are unions in all
nations.
2957. But from the employers’ point of view, even supposing alien divers are employed, would it not be
better to have them of mixed nationalities, so that the employers would not be so afraid of a general
strike ? I do not think that would make any difference, because in the event of a strike the indented
men, over whom we are supposed to have a great hold, although they would not take an active part in the
strike, would expect the same terms as the ifree men.
2958. Did you not have a little difficulty in connection with a strike at the beginning of this year ? That
was with regard to remuneration. They wanted the old rates ; with a depressed market the owners could
not afford to pay them, and they had to reduce the rates to some extent.
Andrew Sinclair, ex-Marine Diver, examined :
2959. By the Chairman: What are you ? I have been a marine diver in Torres Strait for a little over
thirty years.
2960. Have you spent a portion of that time in the pearl-shell industry ? Most of the time. I commenced ]
diving here in 1874.
2961. Have you ever seen fatal results from diving? Tes ; a good many times I have been near death’s
door.
2962. To what was that due ? In 1875 I was diving near the mainland. We had inferior diving gear in
those days, and the pipe burst while I was down in 9 fathoms of water. I had 28 fathoms of pipe out,
and it broke in the centre. In those days we had no valve to prevent the air escaping from the helmet.
2963. I presume you were a sound, healthy man when you began diving ? Tes,
2964. What age were you then ? I was about thirty-one years old.
2965. Bor how long did you carry on the work? I was diving from then until three years ago.
2966. Do you consider you are a worse man, physically, now, considering your age ? Tes. I have suffered,
but simply because I went down in too deep water.
2967. Do you suffer now from anything that you attribute to diving P The only thing is that lam
practically paralysed in the lower limbs. I feel as if my lower extremities were in cold water all the
time.
2968. What was the extreme depth to which you went down ? Twenty-seven fathoms. I went down too
many times at the one time, or else it might not have happened.
2969. By Mr. Douglas: Tou attribute it to your own fault ? Tes, because I was too greedy.
2970. Tou did not take proper precautions ? No.
2971. The shell was plentiful at the bottom, and you wished to get as much as you could before coming
to the surface ? Yes.
2972. By the Chairman : Had you been careful, you would not have suffered from this paralysis ? No.
2973. Do you think it is possible for a white man to carry on diving without suffering from any illness,
provided he takes reasonable care ? Yes. If he is a healthy man he can carry on for a number of
years. It is a very healthy occupation.
2974. By Mr. Douglas: Tou have a family ? Tes. I have reared them on Thursday Island.
2975. Are any of them engaged on the pearling boats ? Not in diving.
2976. Have they ever had the opportunity of becoming divers? No ; but they wanted to become divers.
2977. Did you desire them to become divers ? No. They wanted me to teach them diving, but they
are well off without it.
2978. They are really better off ? Tes.
2979. By the Chairman : Are they strong and healthy ? Tes ; they are strong and healthy young fellows.
2980. By Mr. Douglas: Tou did not care about them becoming divers ? No ; because there has been
no encouragement for young white fellows to become divers for a number of years.
2981. If there had been any encouragement you would have let them become divers? Tes; and I would
have gone out with them myself and seen them well broken into it. 1 have broken in a good number of
divers in the Strait, both white men and coloured men.
2982. How long does it take to make a man a diver ? It depends upon his eyesight. A man can do the
actual divin" in time; but to take up the shell you must teach him. He must understand the bottom.
takes about six months before a man becomes anything like good at picking up shell.
2983. Acquaintance with the bottom can only be acquired with practice? Yes. It depends upon whether
a man has sharp eyesight. At the same time, if he is willing and attentive and wants to get shell, he can
learn in less than six months.

A. Sinclair.
12 June, 1908.
2981. By the Chairman'. If three white men had a boat among them, and they were all divers who
could relieve each other, what amount should they earn in twelve months with shell worth £l5O a ton ?
. The shell is not so plentiful now as it used to be in the olden times.
2985. By Mr. Douglas: Supposing they got 5 tons a year? Any sort of a diver could get that much
after he is once broken in.
2986. If a man got 5 tons a year, would he make a good living out of it ? Yes ; on less than that.
2987. By the Chairman : AVhat quantity of shell could they get with shell as it is now ? Pour tons a
year will pay both the owners and the divers.
2988. By HJr Douglas: Have there been many white divers engaged in the industry while you have been
here? Yes. I have broken in a lot of white divers in the Strait. For a certain time they worked for
owners and made money enough to buy boats for themselves ; and some of them made enough money to
go away and buy farms. They were mostly Scandinavians and other foreigners, and there were some
good chaps from New South Wales. They had nothing when they started.
2989. Were not some of them unsuccessful ? It just depended upon how they lived. A good many of
them abused themselves drinking, and of course they cannot make much when they do that.
2990. You are referring to twenty or thirty years ago? As late as fifteen years ago.
2991. The place was not quite so congenial to live in as it is now —The food and the living generally were
not so good then, and perhaps men were more inclined to spend their money? Yes. When the hotels
came to be built here, men went out and made a good bit of money, and when they came in again they
had a good spree. The consequence was they went out again with their heads swimming, and that sort
of thing. Some did well, but not all of them.
2992. It ig not only white divers who have done that sort of thing—Others also have indulged too freely ?
Yes.
2993. For instance, miners are inclined to take a glass too much now and then? Yes. I taught some
miners to dive—men from Cloncurry and Croydon, and elsewhere.
2994. Do you think diving tends to make a man drink ? No.
2995. It does not lead a man to drink ? Certainly not.
2996. By Mr. Bennett : How many white divers have you broken in ? I could hardly tell you, but I
broke in a good many.
2997. How long were you breaking them in ? I had a boat for ten years, and I employed none but white
men.
2995. During those ten years you broke in white divers ? Yes.
2999. Did you break in 100 divers ? Not 100.
3000. Did you break in fifty ? I cannot say.
3001. How many men did you have in the boat at one time ? Sis.
3002. How many white men ? All white men, and I generally used to get more shell with those white
men than I got afterwards with coloured men. I had a crew of all Manila men, sometimes all Malays,
and I have had one all Arabs.
3003. -Did you carry a crew of all white men ? Yes, for two or three years; and I generally got more
shell in those days than the other men.
3004. How many of those white men became divers ? About a dozen of them, but they did not all
become good divers.
3005. By Mr. Douglas: Did you get plenty of shell in the early days when the Old Ground was first
opened ? Yes.
3006. How many tons in the year for one diver ? I cannot say. When the Old Ground first broke out
one diver, a Rotumah man, got 4 tons in fourteen days.
3007. What would he be paid per ton ? Twenty pounds a ton. I did not employ that man. He got
it from Roko.
3008. By the Chairman : Have you any idea how scarce shell has become ? There is plenty of shell to he
got in Torres Strait, but you must go into deep water.
3009 Suppose three white men had a boat of their own, and shell was £l5O a ton, how much do you
think they could earn in a year? It would pay them at £l5O a ton.
3010. What do you think they would earn ? It is hard to tell. I used to come in sometimes with a ton
a month.
3011. By Mr. Bennett: How long ago was that? About fifteen years ago.
3012. By the Chairman : Do you think three white men could get more or less than 3 tons now ? They
could get more, but they would have to go round. There is not so much shell as there was. On the Old
Ground I have seen one shell. I would stoop down and pick that up. There is mud on the bottom there,
and I just stepped on one side and looked to see if there were any other shells lying in the same place, and
I saw other shells, and took up five, one lying on top of the other. They got more shell from the Old
Ground every year.'
3013. By Mr. Bennett: Then the pearl-shell oyster will live if it is covered up with mud? If it is an
inch above the mud it will live. I have seen shell on sandbanks quite dead, because they were covered up
with sand.
3014. When you commenced diving here thirty years ago where did you go to find shell ? Always in the
passages. We never went outside.
3015. Which passages ? About LJadu, Mua, and on the mainland near Thursday Island.
3016. Inside all the time ? Yes.
3017. Did you fish the Warrior and Wappa reefs regularly? We did not fish there regularly till 1876.
3018. At that time you could get all the shell you wanted in the passages round the islands? Yes.
3019. You did not go to Darnley in those days ? No; we never thought of anything of that sort, as
the water was supposed to be too deep.
3020. When was the Old Ground discovered? About 1884 or 1885.
3021. Where did you use to fish on the Old Ground then ? From Badu.
3022. Did you ever have to go outside Badu in those days ? No.
3023. Did you ever have to go south of Badu? Not until the Old Ground was worked out.
3024. What is the largest number of white divers you have ever known to be working in the fishery at
one time ? Ten.

8025. By Mr. Douglas: Have you worked in the beche-de-mer fishery? Yes; I commenced beche-de-
mer fishing in the Solomon Islands before I came here. I was six years fishing for beche-de-mer there.
3026. That would be about forty years ago ? I was at the Solomon Islands in 1868, and I came here in
1.874.
3027. Have you been on the Barrier Ilecf ? Yes, beche-de-mer fishing, but not pearl-shelling. I never
found any pearl-shell out there.
3028. By the Chairman : How long have you been engaged in the boche-de-mer fishery here ? Only a
few months. I was out with Fred Lancaster for four months.
3029. By Mr. Douglas : You have not worked at beche-de-mer fishing for yourself? No.
3030. You have been only four months in the beche-de-mer fishing here ? More than that. 1 was
getting b§che-de-mer on the Warrior Eeef with New Guinea men. I was working at the time on the
shore system.
3031. By Mr. Bennett: Did you make a success of it? Not much.
3032. By Mr. Douglas: You employed New Guinea men? Yes; but they had never seen saltwater
before 1 engaged them.
8033. You have nothing to say about beche-de-mer fishing, then ? No ;it is not an occupation suitable
for a white man.
3034. Do you think that working as a member of a crew on a pearl-shelling boat is an occupation for a
white man ? Yes ; I employed white men myself.
3035. It all depends upon what wages they get ? I used to get them for £2 and £2 10s. a month. I
got men who were hard up, and could not get away from here, and they did very well, as a rule.
3036. If there were no coloured men here, do you think you would get white men to work the boats ?
Yes. There are plenty of white men.
3037. If there were no coloured divers here, do you think you would get plenty of white divers ? Yes.
3038. You had some experience in the getting of pearls when you were diving ? Yes.
3030. Did you find many good pearls ? Yes.
3040. Were you lucky in that respect ? I was. In the old days I got pearls for which I got £3OO,
£4OO, and £5OO apiece. There are certain places in Torres Strait where you will get pearls, and there
are other places where you might get 1,000 shells and not find one pearl. At Long Island I got two
pearls, one of which I sold for £2OO, and the other for £2BO.
3041. Where did you sell those pearls ? I sold them here to Mr. Sturtzebecker.
3042. Do you think the chance of getting a good pearl would be an inducement to white men to go into
the industry ? Yes.
3043. Did that induce you to go into the industry? Yes. I made more out of pearls than out of shell.
Aleeed Moetensen, Labourer and Ex-Diver examined :
3044. By the Chairman : What are you ? A labourer at present.
3045. How long have you been at Thursday Island ? Since May, 1891.
3046. Have you had any experience in the pearl-shell fishery ? Yes.
3047. How long were you engaged in that fishery ? About eight years as a diver.
3048. Were you diving constantly for eight years? Yes.
3049. Did you enjoy good health during that time ? Yes.
3050. I suppose that under favourable conditions you would be prepared to go diving again ? Yes.
3051. By Mr. Douglas: Were you employed on wages, or did you own a boat of your own ? I was
employed on wages.
3052. You never owned a boat ? No.
3053. By the Chairman: If you had a boat do you think you could make a success of diving ? I
think so.
3054. By Mr. Douglas: By whom were you employed ? By Albert Colless and Andersen Brothers.
3055. By the Chairman : How were you paid at that time ? Twenty-five pounds per ton of shell.
3056. By Mr. Douglas : Did you get any share of the pearls ? Half.
3057. By the Chairman t-: How much did you earn during the year ? That I could not say. I made a
fair thing out of it, anyhow —good wages.
3058. AVhat would you call good wages—£lso a year ? Something like that —£6 or £7 a week.
3059. And you got your tucker in addition ? Yes.
3060. Were you a married man when you were diving ? Not all the time.
3061. By the Chairman: Do you know the present condition of the pearl-shell industry ? Yes.
3062. Pearl-shell is not as plentiful as it was some years ago ? Ido not think there is much difference.
3063. Supposing you and two other white men owned a boat, and that the price of shell was £l5O a ton,
how much do you think you could earn in a year ? I think I could get 5 tons a year at least.
3064. Besides pearls ? Besides pearls.
3065. Do you not think it is possible to carry on the industry under those conditions with white men?
I think so.
3066. Do you know that at present all the divers are Japanese? Yes.
3067. By Mr. Douglas: How was it you came to give up diving ? Because wages went down.
3068. The price of shell went down ? Yes, and the Japanese came in.
3069. By Mr. Bennett: When did the wages go down ? Ido not remember exactly.
3070. By Mr. Douglas: You could not obtain employment ? No.
3071. At what rates ? £2O a ton.
3072. By the Chairman : If Japanese were not available, I suppose you could get plenty of employment ?
Yes.
3073. By Mr. Douglas: There were too many coloured divers who were willing to work for less money ?
That is it.
3074. By the Chairman : If the number of Japanese divers were gradually reduced, would there be plenty
of white men come here as divers ? I think so, if they got a little encouragement.
3075. By Mr. Bennett: What should be the nature of the encouragement? I would not suggest
anything.

1- 3076. By Mr. Douglas: You would suggest that they should be offered a sufficient rate per ton —say,
N £25 or £3O per ton ? Yes.
3077. Do you think that would be sufficient inducement ? Yes.
3078. The catch of shell now is not as good as it was when you were diving, so that you would require to
get more than £25 a ton to make a fair living ? Even at £25 a ton I think I would be able to make a
living.
3079. Can you tell us what your average yearly earnings were during the years you were diving,
including pearls ? I could not say. We used to get on shore every time we came in, and we did not
think any more of it.
3080. Sometimes you had nothing, and sometimes you had something ? That is it ?
3081. On some grounds you got more pearls than on others? Yes.
3082. Did you work the grounds that were supposed to have plenty of pearls? Yes.
3083. Did you get any pearls of any great value? The biggest I got was worth £l4O.
3084. Your share of it was £7O ? Yes.
3085. Where was that pearl sold ? To Mr. Spencer.
3086. By Mr. Bennetl: Do you reckon you got a fair price for it ? Yes.
3087. By Mr. Douglas : Did you get any others of any value? That was the best—£lo or £2O.
3088. You used to get some pearls every trip? ’Yes.
3089. What were they worth every trip—£lo, £2O, or £5O ? Not that much. Sometimes 1 might not
get any at all.
3090. How long would a trip take ? Five weeks.
3091. By the Chairman-. Did you find constant diving more exhausting than any other work ? No.
3092. By Mr. Douglas : Did you ever have any accidents at diving ? No.
3093. Have you ever suffered any bodily inconvenience ? No; except a little bit of rheumatics.
3094. Have you ever dived in deep water ? Anything up to 25 fathoms.
3095. Not over 25 fathoms ? Ido not think so,
3096. Have you dived at Damley Island ? T was there three days.
3097. You did not venture into the deep water ? No.
3098. By the Chairman : You know what fishing is in the North Sea and the Baltic? Yes.
3099. Do you think it is more trying and hazardous work diving here than fishing in the North Sea? I
think the fishing in the North Sea is more trying.
3100. By Mr. Douglas: What nationality are you ? A Dane.
3101. Were you engaged in fishing there before you came here ? Very little.
3102. Did you come from a seaport? Yes, Losoe.
3103. Did you come direct to Thursday Island ? No; I came to Sydney.
3104. Were you engaged in Sydney by Colless to come here as a diver ? No ; I brought up a lugger for
Mr. Bowden.
3105. By Mr. Bennett: You are a seaman ? Yes.
3106. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you think there would be any difficulty in obtaining white divers if some
gradual process of replacing the Japanese could be devised —Do you think white men from the South or
other places would be prepared to come here if sufficient inducements were offered ? I think they would
come in gradually, but at the start it would be difficult to get them.
3107. By the Chairman -. Do you think young men could be got from the Baltic and your part of the
world —Norwegian fishermen, for instance ? I think so.
3108. By Mr. Douglas -. What do they earn in Norway? They do not earn much.
3109. Do you think they would be glad to come and enter upon this occupation ? Some of them would.
3110 : By Mr. Bennett-. What was the pay for an able seaman on board Danish ships when you were at
sea ? About £2 10s. a month.
3111. When you were diving, what class of tender did you usually have—white or coloured. Most of the
time I had white.
3112. As a diver, would you prefer a white tender? Yes.
3113. When you left diving, where were you getting most of the shell? At Mangrove Island, Long
Island, and Wappa.
3114. How much shell could you reckon on getting at Long Island and Wappa ? The least was 63 tons
a year.
3115. How long is it since you knocked off? Seven or eight years.
3116. Was the catch of shell as good when you knocked off as it was when you began ? Ido not think
it was exactly as good. Some years the weather was not as good as in other years.
3117. Have you any opinion about the size limit for exportable shell—Do you consider 5 inches
sufficiently large ? I think 5 inches rather small.
3118. Do you consider 6 inches was a better limit, having in view the keeping of the beds going? Yes.
3119. When you were down at the bottom, supposing you came across a shell, could you tell easily
whether it was over 5 inches or not ? Yes.
3120. How did you tell ? By spanning it.
3121. Then would the smaller shell be in the same position on the bottom as the large shell ? The small
shell would be stuck to the bottom.
3122. Would it be standing up or lying down ? It was mostly standing up.
3123. Was the large shell—that is, anything over 6 inches—standing up or lying down ? Some would be
standing up and some would be lying down. It depended upon the ground. On a sandy or muddy bottom
you would get them lying down, but on a grassy bottom most of them were standing up on edge.
3124. On the grassy bottom they were propped up by the weeds ? • Yes.
3125. By Mr. Douglas: The small shell is attached to the bottom? Yes.
3126. By Mr. Bennett -. That is another means by which you can distinguish between the large and
small shell? Yes.
3127. By Mr. Douglas : How big is the shell when it breaks itself off from the bottom ? I could not
say.
3128. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think the closure of beds would tend to conserve the industry by
restoring the beds to their old productiveness ? Ido not thiuk so.


3129. Why not? Not at present anyway. I think there are as many shell in one place as in another at
present.
3130. But taking the grounds as a whole, are there as many shell now as there were fifteen years ago ?
Not on the Old Ground.
3131. Are there in Torres Strait ? Ido not think that is the best.
3132. Is there as much in the passages round Badu ? I think there is in depths over three fathoms,
where the swimming boats cannot go.
3133. By Mr. Douglas: Does the shell grow quickly on those beds inshore ? I could not say how long it
takes to grow.
3134. By Mr. Bennett-. Have you ever worked in the Gulf off Red Point? Tes.
3135. Is the shell there as plentiful as it used to be ? I could not say. It is a good many years since I
was there.
3136. On the whole, you are not in favour of the closure of beds ? No.
3137. Is there anything you would like to bring forward yourself ? No.
3138. We may take it that your opinion is that the industry can be worked profitably at the present time
with white divers and white tenders ? Tes.
3139. What about crews ? There are a lot of Australian and New Guinea natives. Tou must find work
for them.
3140. Do you think the industry would support white crews in addition to white divers and tenders at the
present time ? Ido not think so.
3141. By Mr. Douglas ; There would not be enough money in it to make it pay ? No.
3142. By Mr. Bennett : Where do you think we should go for crews—to Japan, New-Guinea, Manila,
the Strait Islands, or where ? Do as you have done before. Tou could get men from Singapore. Then
there are the mainland natives, or you could get men from New Guinea.
3143. Have you ever worked with Papuans ? Tes.
3144. What is your opinion of them as crews ? They are good men if they are well treated.
3145. Andersen employed Papuans for some time ? Tes.
3146. He got on well with them ? Tes.
3147. Have you ever had any of the mainland natives as crew? A few.
3148. Were they any good ? Oh yes.
3149. They are pretty smart men in a boat ? Tes.
3150. Have you employed Strait islanders ? Tes.
3151. Are they suitable for crews ? Tes.
3152. Do you think they could be brought on to be suitable for divers and tenders ? Ido not know.
3153. Tou think it would take some time ? Tes. I had one boy for a tender, and he was not too bad.
3154. As a rule they are not careful in looking after the boat and gear ? No.
3155. That is the great objection to them? Tes.
3156. They are all right when you are down below, I suppose ? Tes.
3157. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think the scarcity of shell is due to the number of boats working on the
grounds ? To a certain extent.
3158. Do you think too many boats have been on the grounds ? Tes.
3159. Tou think that, if the number had been less, the grounds would not been so much over-fished?
That is so.
3160. Do you think it would be a good plan to limit the number of boats working in the fishery or to
close some of the areas so as to allow the shell to grow ? I think it would be better to limit the number
of boats allowed to fish.
3161. How many boats do you think could profitably work the beds ? That is a question 1 could not
answer.
3162. What tonnage of shell does a man require to obtain per year to make a fair living ? It all
depends upon the wages he gets.
3163. Say he gets £25 per ton ? Six tons a year.
3164. By Mr. Bennett : He would be reasonably sure of getting a few pearls ? He would get some.
3165. By Mr. Douglas : Do you know of any cultivation experiments which have taken place since you
came here ? Tes.
3166. Have you been employed in connection with any of those experiments ? No.
3167. Do you remember that some years ago some shell was obtained on the bottom of one of the hulks
lying in the harbour and also on the jetty ? No.
3168. By Mr. Bennett-. What was the size of the boats you mostly worked in? Mostly 13 and 14 tons.
3169. Would you care to work in a smaller sized vessel ? Tes ; a 10-ton boat is right enough.
3170. By Mr. Douglas : What is the tonnage of Albert Colless’s boats ? Twelve tons.
3171. By Mr. Bennett : Tou consider a 10-ton boat sufficiently large to work the Old Ground at the
distance they are working now ? Tes.
3172. Do you know how far they have to go to leeward now ? Tes.
3173. Do you think a 10-ton boat gives sufficient accommodation and safety, and is sufficiently powerful ?
As far as safety goes, she is as safe as a 12-ton boat.
3174. lam speaking of the diver and crew ? They can bo quite as comfortable.
3175. By Mr. Douglas -. Would you be prepared to resume work as a diver if you saw you could make
enough money at it ? Tes.
3176. By the Chairman -. Do you know any other white men here who would go in for diving ? No.
3177. By Mr. Bennett -. Have you ever known any white natives of Thursday Island take up diving for a
living—young fellows who have grown up to manhood while you have been here ? Only one that I can
think of.
3178. Who is that ? Harry Colless.
3179. Is he still diving ? No.
3180. What is he doing now ? He is a baker here at present.
3181. Was he long at the diving? No. .
3182. Do you think it would be any advantage to divers, if instead of an annual license, a diver was
granted a certificate of competency similar to that issued to a master mariner or mate ? In some cases
jt might.
A. Mortensen.


A. Morlensen.

n * 3183. "Would it have a tendency to create a better class of divers ? Yes.
3184 Do you not think it would be fairer to the men themselves if they only had to pay one fee just as
®* a master mariner does, instead of an annual license fee ? Yes, I think it would be a very good idea.
How would that act where a diver had to be broken in ?
3185. He would not get his certificate until he had proved that he was a capable diver ? T see.
3186. Do you think it would be any advantage to the industry to require a man to undergo a medical
examination before he is licensed as a diver, so as to avoid licensing a man who is not in good health ?
I do not think so.
3187. Why not ? If a man is not strong enough to do the work, he is not likely to take it up.
Thomas Joseph Faequhae, Pearl-sheller and Pearl-dealer, examined :
3188. By the Chairman : What are you ? A pearl-sheller and pearl-dealer.
3189. How long have you been connected with the industry ? Between fourteen and fifteen years.
N 3190. You are an employer in the industry, are you not ? Yes.
8< 3191. How many boats have you got ? Twenty altogether.
3192. How many pump-diving vessels ? Nineteen.
3193. Are they registered in this port? Most of them. Some of them are registered in Townsville, and
some in Sydney.
3194. By Mr. Bennett-. This is not a port of registry ? No, this is not a port of registry. They are all
registered in Queensland and in New South Wales.
3195. By the Chairman : Can you tell us how many boats are now engaged in the industry ? Not from
memory.
3196. What is the present condition of the pearling grounds ? I can only say from hearsay. The divers
tell me there is any amount of young growing shell.
3197. Do you consider the present deposits of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now licensed profitably
employed ? Yes.
3198. Without any further depletion of the beds ? Yes.
3199. Do you consider that the number of vessels licensed for employment in the industry should be
limited ? Having regard to the depletion of the beds, I think there are sufficient boats working now.
3200. What do you think should be the limit—There are 112 pump-boats at present ? I suggest that
not more than 150 should be licensed at the very outside.
3201. On what basis would you suggest that licenses should be issued so that no person should be unduly
favoured, and so that no monopoly should be created ? Without answering that question as you put it,
I think the system wants altering altogether. Looking at the prosperity of the Island, the industry
should be put on a different footing.
3202. Do you refer to changed conditions and thb substitution of white for coloured labour ? Yes.
3203. What would be the effect of the periodical closure of beds as a means of maintaining and possibly
increasing the supply of pearl-shell ? Ido not think it is required with the present number of boats.
3204. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? The present 5-inch limit.
3205. You do not think that should be increased ? No.
3206. Do you think the closure of special areas for the catchment of spat would assist in restoring the
productiveness of the beds ? No.
3207. Do you think any restriction should be placed on the size of vessels engaged iu the pearl-shell
industry ? No.
3208. What effect have the floating stations had upon the working of the industry ? I think it was
very much better when floating stations were universal; but the different prices paid per “lay ”to divers
under the floating and shore station systems made it impossible to work afloat.
3209. You consider the floating stations were beneficial to the industry? Yes; from the owners’ point
of view.
3210. By Mr. Bennett : But regarding the question from the point of view of making the industry
permanent ? Ido not think the floating-station system affected the permanency of the industry.
3211. By the Chairman : What do you consider should be the maximum size of vessels for efficiently
working the industry ? For a floating station you want a large vessel.
3212. I mean for the pump boats ? We run up to 15 and 16 tons at the present time.
3213. Do you consider that size necessary, and that boats of a less tonnage would not be equally
successful ? Yes ; but in dealing with our divers they go for the big comfortable boat. If you have a
boat of 15 tons, and I have one of 12 tons, you will probably collar the diver I want, because you can
give him a bigger boat to work from.
8214. Because it gives greater comfort ? Yes; and because it is probably a faster sailer. The bigger
and faster the boat the greater the inducement to the diver.
3215. Can you suggest any way for improving the vessels to give greater comfort to the crews ? No ; I
think they are very well provided for in that way.
8216. Are the men satisfied with them ? Yes.
3217. By Mr. Douglas : When you came-into the industry first, were you engaged on the floating-station
system of working ? Yes.
3218. You belonged to the Queensland Pearl-shell Company, which had its base at Wai-Weer? Yes.
3219. That company also owned a large schooner which was working on the shelling-ground? Yes.
3220. After some time they ceased their shore station altogether ? Yes.
3221. You were afloat yourself for some years, were you not ? Yes.
3222. Working a fleet of boats from a movable base like a schooner, seeing that the schooner acts as a
mark in the event of the boats dropping on a patch of shell, do you not think that the system tends
to the taking of more shell from the grounds than is desirable in the interests of the industry ? No.
3223. You do not think that the grounds are more liable to be cleaned out than under the shore-station
system ? No.
3224. You think that there will be as much shell there in the course of a year or two after the boats
have been on a patch ? Yes.
T. J.
Farquhar.
12 J une, 1908.


3225. Prom your observations iu working the floating-station system, did you find the different grounds
which were fished over year after year produced further shell? Yes; we used to go over the same
ground year after year. A diver is not able to walk over every inch of the ground.
3226. Do you know whether on the Old Ground and in Endeavour Strait round about here the shells
are piled one on top of another in places where there are weeds and mud? I think not. Ido not think
they are so thick as that.
3227. The weed on the bottom of the Old Ground has something to do with the catch of shell, has it
not? It is a natural protection for the shell. The weeds grow at certain seasons of the year, and the
boats have to go elsewhere to search for shell, and when the north-west season comes on all the weeds
die off. The diver then gets in two or three months’ good work on a clear bottom, but the extent is so
great that the present number of boats do not make any appreciable difference in the quantity of shell.
3228. Then the heavy season from the north-west assists to clear the bottom ? Yes. The grass dies off
and the bottom is washed clear. It begins to grow again directly the south-east weather comes in.
3229. During the season when the south-east winds blow strongly the divers are prevented from
working on the Old Ground ? Yes.
3230. Then you think the weather affords sufficient protection to the beds? Yes.
3231. And you would not advocate the closure of any beds so long as the number of vessels is not
increased beyond ]5O ? No.
3232. There was a proposition made some little time ago to limit the tonnage of vessels employed in the
industry to 25 tons? Yes; I was not agreeable to that. That was aimed at stopping floating stations.
3233. Did you sign that ? Ido not think so. lam not sure ; I did not belong to the Pearlers’ Associa-
tion for some time.
3231. But this was a general petition from the townspeople? I do not think so. The object was to
endeavour to get the industry worked from the shore instead of from floating stations. A .suggestion
was made to limit the tonnage of vessels, either tenders or diving boats, to 25 tons.
3231 a. You do not think that would be a good plan ? Ido not see that it is necessary.
3235. You think the floating-station system is the more profitable for the owners of the boats? Yes.
3236. By Mr. Bennett: Why? Under the floating-station system the men were paid for the shell, and
it was for the owner to look after it and after the pearls, and to collect them from the boats. The
present system is to pay for the shell, and the divers own the pearls.
3237. By Mr. Douglas : Are the expenses of floating stations greater than the expenses under the shore
system ? The expenses may be more, but the chances are that you repay yourself by getting the pearls
and by keeping the boats more at work.
3238. Do you remember when the Clark fleet went to the Aroe Islands ? Yes.
3239. Do you remember the reasons given for their leaving here ? The reason given out was that
legislation was so much against them that they could not work profitably.
3210. Do you think that was the real reason ? No; I think the real reason was that they had something
better on. They were going to a new field with any amount of shell. It had been well prospected, and
they knew that they had something better on for the time being.
3211. Do you think the labour conditions had much to do with their leaving? They may have had
something to do with it.
3212. Have you found any difficulty in getting permission from the Eederal Government to indent
labour ? I have had no difficulty.
3213. You have been able to get whatever labour you required whenever you required it ? Yes.
3211. Were divers difficult to obtain the year before the Clark fleet went away ? No ; there have
always been any amount of divers available.
3215. There was an advance system in vogue at that time under which you had to make heavy advances ?
Yes. When that was knocked on the head it was difficult to get divers to sign on immediately without
advances; but there were plenty available, and they had to sign on later.
3216. The giving of advances to the divers made them harder to work—they were working off a dead
horse, I suppose ? Yes ; It was a bad system, and they took full advantage of it.
3217. That system does not prevail now ? Not that I know of—not to any extent.
3218. At the time the Clark fleet went away, was the catch of shell up to the average ? No.
3219. Was there a serious falling off? Yes. I think that was mainly due to the weather conditions.
Of course the large number of boats then at work must have had some effect on the take.
3250. You think there were too many boats at that time ? Yes.
3251. Would you at any time think of going afloat again with a schooner ? Not while it is this mixed
business, because my experience was that my shell was bought by boats operating on the present “ Jay
sjstem. They were getting £BO ashore for all the shell they delivered. I was paying my divers a “ lay”
of £2O a ton, and my shell was being transferred to the other boats which were getting a bigger price.
We knew our divers were robbing us.
3252. What were the divers getting under the floating-station system ? A “ lay” of £2O to £25 a ton ;
and the shore-station men were being paid £BO a ton, the diver paying for provisions. We found our
crews in provisions. . .
3253. So that the diver working the shore boat could afford to buy shell from your boat by giving more
than the “ lay" you were paying ? Yes.
3251. By that means you did not obtain your catch of shell ? No.
3255. By Mr. Bennett : Then the diver under the shore-station system was better off than the diver under
the floating-station system ? Not necessarily. The average he would make would be, perhaps, the same
as that made by our divers, but for every ton he could buy from our divers at £lO he would get £BO.
The thing was done wholesale.
3256. By Mr. Douglas: So that the floating-station system was working at a great disadvantage ? That
was my reason for bringing my schooner in and abandoning the floating-station system.
3257. Are you now working on the system of giving them so much a ton and charging them with all
wages and provisions ? Yes ; and giving all pearls to the divers.
3258. That means that you are practically relieved from all responsibility? We are not, because the
men are on articles, and, if a diver does not make sufficient to pay the crew, the onus of payment comes
on the owner.

3259. Do you think that system enables divers to make good wages ? Tes.
32G0. Do they get all the pearls ? Tes.
' 3261. What do you estimate a Japanese gets working on the system of £BO per ton and getting the
pearls ? From my knowledge of the pearls that go from here, I think, taking it all round, you can put
it down at anything from £250 to £350 a year clear.
3262. You have been a pearl-dealer for a number of years ? Tes, nine or ten years.
3263. Ton see most of the pearls that are put on the market ? I see a great many of them.
3264. Do the divers come direct to you with their pearls, or do they sell them through agents ? The
divers come with an interpreter.
3265. Is there much Japanese food used on the boats ? Tes ; a fair quantity.
3266. More than there used to be? Much more since they have been working under the present system.
3267. They import their own provisions, do they not ? The Japanese storekeepers import them, and sell
to the Japanese divers direct. Since the present system has been in vogue the men have not been nearly
so well fed as they were in the days when the owners were responsible for the provisions.
3268. As the diver has to pay for the provisions, he rather skimps or cuts down the allowance ? Tes.
3269. Do the crew complain at all ? Occasionally you hear complaints.
3270. The crews are mostly New Guinea natives P Tes.
3271. Do you think that system is desirable in the interests of the industry F No.
3272. By Mr. Bennett : Do the Japanese crew complain ? Not to me. The Japanese are too clannish.
3273. The complaints come from the New Guinea men ? Those that I know of do.
3274. Ton have said that you consider the present supply of shell sufficient to keep the boats now
working going ? Tes.
3275. Would the supply tend to increase if the number of boats were not increased ? Well, I should
be inclined to say “Yes,” because, as you know yourself, diving boats, when they clean out one spot,
or find that it is not worth while to stay there any longer, go elsewhere, and give that spot a rest for a
time, so that there would be an increase of shell in the areas they are not working.
3276. What time do you reckon it will take a pearl-oyster to attain to a diameter of from 6£ to 7 inches ?
From my observation, I should say from eighteen months to two years.
3277. That is from the spat to 6i or 7 inches? Tes; before it starts to thicken too much. The growth
is very rapid up to the 5-inch limit. After that it grows more slowly.
3278. From your long experience in connection with the grounds here, do you think the present supply
of shell is equal in quantity to what it was fifteen years ago ? My experience is that there is very little
difference in the take per boat.
3279. I am not speaking of the take per boat, but of the actual quantify of shell available for faking?
That is the only way I can arrive at a conclusion—the take per boat. If fifteen years ago a diver could
get four tons a year, and he can get four tons a year now, I think that shows that the shell is still there.
3280. Do you remember the year when the greatest quantity of shell was exported from Thursday
Island ? I think it was in 1896.
3281. Do you remember the year when the size limit was reduced to 5 inches ? Ido not. I think that
was before my time.
3282. Will you look at those official figures—[ Government Resident's Annual Report handed to Witness ] —
Tru will observe that 1,223 tons were exported in 1897—what is the number of boats given for that
year ? 223. I could throw a little light on that.
3283. The export of shell that year was heavier than in any other year, was it not ? Yes. In that year
there was a great rush for Darnley. A great number of boats went out there and got big takes of shell
in deep water. There were a lot of deaths, and the Darnley fishing grounds went out of favour. There
are very few boats working there at present.
3284. That was the year in which the 5-inch limit came into force ? I would not be certain of that.
3285. Will you refer to the returns for the subsequent years given in that report, and tell me what was
the take of shell and the number of boats ? Tes.
3286. Tou will see that up till 1904 the number of boats steadily increased, while on the other hand the
take of shell steadily decreased ? I can explain that. Those boats are not classified, Beche-de-mer
boats are not distinguished from other boats, and the beche-de-mer boats increased abnormally during
that period.
3287. Pardon me, I made up those statistics myself, and I know that beche-de-mer boats are not included
in the list—Those are pearling boats; you see that in 1904 there were 353 boats licensed, and they
took 777 tons of shell? Tes.
3288. And in 1905, 348 beats were licensed, and they obtained 527 tons ? Tes.
3289. Do not those figures show that the increase in the number of boats does not tend to maintain the
supply of shell—That return is for a period of seven years? During those years every little cutter that
took out a license for swimming diving went out to the ground, and the result was failure for themselves.
Diving boats can get as much shell at the present time as they could years ago. All those boats are
not pump boats. Doyle had a lot, and Cowling had a lot, and they went to the wall.
3290. Those statistics are compiled in the same way every year—Do the figures not tend to show that
the supply of shell raised is not maintained: These figures apparently do ; but I say the explanation is
that the small swimming boats and beche-de-mer boats bring down the average. My experience is
that my boats last year averaged more than they had done for some years.
3291. Clark’s combined fleets left Thursday Island in the year 1905? Tes.
3292. By Mr. Douglas : What was the take for the year 1907 ? There were 135 boats, and the take was
567 tons of shell.
3293. Those were swimming boats and pump boats? Yes. If you compare that year with the year
when there were 223 boats, and the take was 1,233 tons of shell, you will see that there is not such a
difference between the take of last year and the take the very best year.
3294. By Mr. Bennett : How many boats went away with the Clark fleet ? About 100.
3295. How many pump boats are here now ? I should say not more than 100.
3296. I think the figures are 112—So that in 1905 there must have been at least 212 pump boats here?
Tes. According to that, the take of shell has increased.


3297. By Mr. Douglas : Those figures would indicate that since Clark’s fleets left the grounds the boats
remaining have obtained a greater catch ? Tes. At the same time you have to consider that last year
we had good weather, and that the year they went away we had very bad weather, and the boats did not
have the same time to work. We all had a very bad year through stress of weather the year Clark’s
fleets went away.
3298. Were there many swimming boats in 1897? No. In 1898 and 1899 they increased very
rapidly, and that accounts for the number of licenses issued in those years.
3299. When the depression came on the swimming boats dropped out ? Tes.
3300. The boats worked by the natives are not licensed ? 1 believe that is so.
3301. By Mr. Bennett : They contribute to the take of shell, do they not? Not to any appreciable
extent.
3302. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience in the propagation of the pearl-oyster by
cultivation? No.
3303. Have you any knowledge of any experiments in cultivation entered upon by any person? No
personal knowledge.
3304. Do you remember Mr. Tosh ? Tes.
3305. Did you ever have any conversation with him about the experiments he had in view? On several
occasions I had conversations with him as to what he thought he should be allowed to do—that is, to
establish a station for the conservation of spat.
3300. Do you think such an experiment is likely to be successful ? I certainly do.
3307. What do you consider is the primary requisite for the success of an experiment in cultivation? The
primary requisite would be to have beds where breeding oysters could be laid down.
3308. Would it not be necessary to secure the services of a scientific man to conduct researches ?
Tes.
3309. Do you know of any areas which would bo suitable for cultivation purposes ? Tes.
3310. Could you name them ? Really, nearly all the shell areas round the islands and on the Warrior
Reef.
3311. Tou think the whole of the waters in Torres Strait would be suitable ? Tes.
3312. By Mr. Bennett. Tou would not approve of closing the areas in which they were laying down the
shell ? No.
3313. The shell would just be laid down and left to take its chance ? That is not what I intended to
convey at all. lam talking about shelling areas when I say Ido not believe in closures. If you have a
lease of a place, I would not like anybody to take the shell you put down.
3314. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the Government would bo justified in spending money on
cultivation experiments ? I do. I have already had a conversation with Mr. Kidston to that effect, and
I told him so. If a man like Mr. Tosh, who has made certain experiments at the expense of the State,
were available, he would be a very good man for the Government to employ. A new man would have to
learn as far as Mr. Tosh went.
3315. Mr. Tosh had not many facilities placed at his disposal, had he ? He had none at all.
3310. He had not even a boat with which to conduct his operations ? No.
3317. Would you and other shelters be prepared to assist by bringing in to an experimental station such
as Wai-Weer all the small shell gathered from the Old Ground ? I would, if I had any voice in the
matter ; but at present the Japanese are my masters, and if they would not bring it in I could not force
them to do it.
3318. By the Chairman : Do you consider it desirable that all the divers should be Japanese? I do not.
3319. In what direction would you suggest a change ? My firm conviction is that the industry could be
carried on with all white divers under certain conditions. If suitable young men were sent here and
taught their business by an experienced diver, and taught the different grounds in Torres Strait, they
could become divers. '1 hat can only be done by the Government establishing a school. It does not take
very long, if you have the right class of man, to make a diver of him. It would be necessary to give him
a certain amount of encouragement for a start; but I think the industry could be well carried on with all
white divers and tenders and the New Guinea and free alien crews that are available.
3320. Tou think that the industry could be carried on by white divers and New Guinea crews ? Or
the free aliens that are here.
3321. Would you not give the preference to those who are dependent for their living upon the
Government, like the Strait Islanders ? Certainly.
3322. As a native of New Zealand, you are familiar with the maritime spirit that prevails there among
the young men—Do you not think a number of them could be induced to try the industry as divers ? I do.
3323. In addition to that, do you think men with money might be induced to come here and learn to
dive, and then get boats of their own ? I think numbers of them could be got.
3324. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the inducements sufficiently attractive? The way to work it
would be for them to get an interest in a boat, and work it out —that is, those who could not afford to
buy a boat. The Government could foster the industry for whites by taking over a certain number of
boats, or even taking over the whole of the big fleets; and they might let any man who obtained a
certificate of competency from the master of the school for divers get a boat, and work it out.
3325. Tou recommend a school for teaching diving here ? Strongly. I have had letters from New
Zealand, and also from Victoria, about this subject, from what appear to be competent men, who are
willing to undertake the business.
332 G. Tou wrote a letter to the Treasurer in which you mentioned that, if the Government assisted to
bring some white men into the industry and gave them some means of acquiring knowledge at a training
school, you would be prepared to give them some work when they had become competent divers ? I was
quite prepared i o give them some boats in a case like that if the Government do not go in for the school
business. There is a white man waiting on the island now who is very anxious to go out diving.
3327. A man with some little experience? Yes; he is a professional diver, although ho has never
dived for pearl-shell. Since he came here he has been out diving with Andersen, and is very anxious to
try.
3328. Has he only recently come here ? Tes. I had a wire from Mr. Swiss Davies asking if I would give
him a chance if he came here.

3329. By the Chairman : Throughout Torres Strait there are several sandbanks and reefs where
cultivation might be carried on ? Fes.
' 3330. Assuming that the Government carry on cultivation under a scientist, do you think it possible
’• that families could be settled on those areas to carry on the industry, and enjoy the comforts of a home ?
I would like to explain that the cultivation scheme and the college scheme are rather conflicting.
3331. But assuming both to be successful ? I think the difficulty would be to get anyone to take up
those areas unless they had sufficient capital to keep them for three or four years. You could not plaster
men down on the islands if they had no money and a boat to bring in the shell first.
3332. I would not expect that —We do not plant men down on farms in the bush ; they get assistance in
some small way if they are not possessed of means? If such a scheme would provide for keeping the
men going, and give them areas on which they could live in the meantime, there are any amount of places
that are available, and would be very suitable for homesteads.
3333. By Mr. Douglas: This is a copy of your letter to the Treasurer —Will you tender it in order that it
may be atttched as an appendix to the evidence ? Yes. [ Letter dated 22nd February, 1908, tendered.
Vide Appendix X].
3331. By the Chairman : Do you consider the present system of charging license fees according to the
tonnage of the vessel satisfactory ? No. I think the charge for all pump-boats should be the same
regardless of tonnage.
3335. Is the present system of issuing licenses to divers and persons in charge satisfactory ? I think so.
3336. As a large employer of labour, do you think it would be more convenient for you and others if the
licenses were issued by the Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries instead of by the Sub-Collector of Customs ?
I think it would be much better to have all the work in the one office. I want to give my reasons for
advocating a uniform charge on boats irrespective of tonnage. The discrepancy between the boats
registered in Sydney and Queensland-built boats in point of size is something enormous. Queensland
boats that are licensed as 16-ton boats are on a par with vessels registered in New South Wales as
10-ton boats. The measurement in the two States is different.
3337. Have you ever made representations on the matter? Yes.
8338. To whom? To Judge Dashwood, when he was here making inquiries.
3339. Has it been represented to the Collector of Customs in Brisbane? I think it has been to the
Sub-Collector here.
3340. Every member of the crew on boats licensed in the edible oyster trade in Moreton Bay has to pay
a license fee—Do you consider such a system might be introduced here with advantage ? I do not think
it is necessary. They are on articles.
3341. Should the number of divers in a boat be restricted ? I do not think that is necessary either.
3342. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think a diver ought to be required to pass a preliminary examination,
or should he undergo a medical examination ? A medical examination would not be a bad idea, but I
believe that no other examination is necessary.
3343. By the Chairman: If you are going to employ white divers, they will have to come under the
Workers’ Compensation Act —It would be for your benefit to see that they are physically sound ? Yes.
3344. By Mr. Bennett : Do the pearlers come under the Workers’ Compensation Act ? No.
3345. By the Chairman : Are you sure of that ? We have had opinion on the subject.
3346. Sailors in coasting vessels come under the Act ? Do they ?
3347. By Mr. Douglas : Have you ever had a lease of a cultivation area ? No. I applied for one, but
it was not granted.
3348. Do you know the present term of lease ? I think it is seven years.
3349. Is that sufficiently long to induce people to spend money on cultivation ? No.
3350. What should the term be ? Thirty years —twenty years at the least.
3351. Do you think areas for cultivation will be taken up if the Government first of all demonstrate
with the aid of a scientist that shell can be cultivated ? I think they will.
3352. Do you think it would be wise to set aside areas of different sizes, and throw them open for
occupation, the same as land is thrown open ? Yes.
3353. And, failing their being selected, that they should be kept reserved until someone took them up?
Yes.
3354. Would you submit the areas to public competition at an upset price ? Not at present, as it would
give the advantage to the man with the longest purse.
3355. Do you think that a man ought to be given priority in selecting the area that he thinks suitable?
I think so.
3356. What system of rental would you propose —a fixed rental per square mile, or so much royalty on
the amount of shell raised from a particular area ? I think a royalty would be the fairest.
3357. What rate per ton? I could not say off hand, because it all depends upon the price of shell and
the profits.
3358. Can you give us any idea of the annual value of pearls exported from Torres Strait ? Since the
Clark fleet has gone away, the take has gone down considerably; but I should say that in 1897 the cash
purchases on Thursday Island, together with the value of the pearls that went away from here but were
not purchased locally, taken at the same rate, would amount to about £40,000.
3359. The fee for a pearl-dealer’s license is £25 a year? Yes.
3360. Anyone can get a license, so long as he can produce a certificate of good character ? Yes.
3361. There is no residence qualification ? No.
3362. Do you think a residence qualification would be a good thing? I have only lately taken out my
license for this year, and did not intend to take it out, because it is no protection. Three or four men
take out a license, and 300 or 400 men deal in pearls. A pearl-dealer from Sydney, London, or anywhere
else comes along and enters into competition with the licensed dealers here, buying £3,000 or £4,000
worth of pearls, which he takes away, and he has to pay no income tax on his profits, while the resident
pearl-dealer has to pay income tax. I have had a license for some years now, and have never had any
protection.
3363. What alteration do you suggest ? The only alteration I can see is to charge the non resident pearl-
dealer a higher fee for his license when be comes to buy.


3364. By the Chairman ; Would it not be better not to issue a license to a man who is not resident here ?
It would be hardly wise to do that, as it might prevent a man coming from another country to buy your
product.
3365. By Mr. Douglas : What fee would you suggest should be paid by a man who has not a;
twelve months’ residence qualification ? If you charge a resident dealer £25 a year, you should charge
the non-resident dealer £lOO.
3366. Is there much illicit pearl-dealing, do you think ? Yes.
3367. Can you suggest any means of dealing with illicit pearl-buying ? Yes; hand the matter over to
the police instead of to the Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries. At present the police have no authority to
take any action with regard to illicit pearl-dealing.
3368. By Mr. Bennett : As a matter of fact, any person can lay an information against a man who is
engaged in illicit dealing ? You could not prosecute him.
3369. Tes ? Well, there was a case here some time ago in which that question cropped up.
3370. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that the issue of all licenses for boats, divers, and leases should
be concentrated in one office ? Yes.
3371. It would be more convenient for everybody if that were done? Yes.
3372. By Mr. Bennett : Gan you suggest what protection should be given to pearl-dealers so as to
ensure their getting a fair deal in their calling ? There is only one way to do it, and that is to provide
that owners of boats, and other persons having pearls which it is reasonable to suppose they have not
come by properly, shall account for them.
3373. That is something like the provision in the South African Diamond Trade Ordinance—Have you
seen that Ordinance ? No ; but 1 have heard of its provisions. Where a pearl is suspected to have been
stolen, the person in whose possession it is found should be required to account for it satisfactorily.
3374. By the Chairman : Suppose I am here for a night, and one of your divers comes to me and sells me
a few pearls, would it rot be difficult to deal with that man ? Yes ; but some men doing that might be
caught. Some pearl-dealers come up from Sydney, stay here for a week or two while the boats are in,
buy pearls, and then go away again; they pay the same license fee as I pay, they scoop all there is
to get, and then clear away. I have to make a return showing the amount my pearls bring in London,
and pay income tax on the profit made, while those men take the pearls out of the State and pay no
income tax.
3375. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think there would be any justification for the Government assisting to
establish a button factory in Queensland ? I made inquiries about that matter, and found that in lots
of villages in Germany women who have small machines, which cost only a pound or two, cut out the
buttons in their own homes and send them on to the manufacturer. Under that system they work
very cheaply. I am not sure that we could do the work profitably with our small consumption in
Australia.
3376. A great proportion of the pearl-shell is used in making buttons ? Yes, I believe so. I got that
information about button-making in Germany from Mr. Weissberger. A button factory was established
in New Caledonia, and there is one in Manila. For a button factory on a large scale in Australia I
think private enterprise would be needed.
3377. Most of the shell is sold in London by auction ? Yes.
3378. Then it is distributed among the different Continental dealers ? Yes.
3379. Do they make contracts with people who use the shell ? Ido not know.
3380. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience in the beche-de-mer fishery ? Yes.
3381. By Mr. Douglas: You have some vessels at present employed in that fishery ? Two at present. I
had six last year.
3382. Are they worked by Japanese ? Yes; by Japanese and New Guinea labour, and by Japanese and
aboriginal labour.
3383. Are they worked with any degree of profit to yourself ? As in the pearl-shell industry, the
Japanese makes terms of his own, and keeps the bulk of the profit.
3384. By Mr. Bennett: Are those boats leased to Japanese ? They are on a “ lay ”of so much per
ton. They pay the crews their wages and the owner of the boat a royalty.
3385. By the Chairman : Where do your boats fish ? Down the Barrier Beef. They have been down as
far as Mackay.
3386. Your profits depend upon the honesty of the men in charge ? Yes. Last year I had four
Japanese in gaol for eight months for selling the fish.
3387. They can sell the fish at Mackay ? The officials down there have all been notified.
3388. Do you think the fishing can be carried on remuneratively to yourself if it is honestly conducted ?
You mean by the Japanese ?
3389. Yes ? Yes. One boat last year cleared £1,200.
3390. By Mr. Bennett: Was that clear profit for the boat ? Yes. She got something like 15 tons of
beche-de-mer, which was an exceptional take.
3391. By Mr. Douglas: Is she working this year ? Yes; I got a wire the other day to say that she
had put into Mackay with 2 tons.
3392. By the Chairman : The gross takings of the boat last year were £1,2Q0? More than that. There
were 15 tons of beche-de-mer altogether.
3393. By Mr. Douglas: What tonnage is that boat? 20 tons.
3394. Does she require a master ? No.
3395. Had you any difficulty with that vessel ? No.
3396. Was not that the boat which was stuck at Cooktown some time ago ? No. The “ Fairy ” is the
name. She carried a crew of eleven aboriginals and three Japanese.
3397. By Mr. Bennett: Who is in charge of her ? A man called Oto.
3398. By the Chairman :Is the beche-de-mer becoming more plentiful ? I think they have skinned the
reefs pretty well where it was thick. It takes some time for the beche-de-mer to recuperate after the
reefs have been skinned.
3399. Have you any idea how long it takes to recuperate ? No.
3400. What is the price per ton —Does it fluctuate very much? The fish for which we were getting
£144 last year is down to about £9O a ton now.
3401. Does that include the teat fish ? Yes ; the teat and the black.

3402. And the red prickly? The red prickly is down lower than that.
3403. Is the reduction in value attributable to the primitive methods they have of smoking and curing the
' fish ? No. I think it is a matter of supply and demand.
■ 3404. At the present season of the year the market is not good as a rule, is it? No. The Chinese have
certain festive seasons, when they give more for it.
3405. Is £9O not an unusually low price at this time of the year ? Yes. It is lower now than it has
been for a long time.
3406. By Mr. Douglas : Is there any difficulty in obtaining labour for the beche-de-mer boats ? No.
3407. Do the Japanese obtain permits to recruit natives ? Yes.
3408. By Mr. Bennett : Through you ? Through the owner.
3409. In fact, the owner gets the permit ? Yes, in the name of the man in charge, who goes for them.
3410. By Mr. Douglas: Do the Japanese absorb most of the aboriginal labour to the detriment of any
Europeans who may be fishing? I think not. There are no Europeans in the trade here.
3411. Are there not some down the Barrier Reef ? Xone that I know of.
3412. What about Walton and “ Yankee Ned”? They do not employ aboriginals. There is one who
goes out spasmodically in a boat, but he is not taken very seriously.
3413. Do you think the employment of aboriginals by Japanese interferes with white men who may wish
to engage in the industry in Torres Strait ? No.
3414. By the Chairman : Are the Papuans employed by the Japanese in the industry ? Yes. This boat
of mine, the “ Eairy,” has thirteen Papuans on board at the present time, and no aboriginals.
3415. By Mr. Douglas : If the Japanese were prevented from obtaining permits to recruit aboriginals,
would it be a hardship to anyone interested in the industry? It would be a hardship to the owner of
the boat if he could not replace the Japanese.
3416. Would it be a hardship to any European if a Japanese having a boat, and paying so much a ton
royalty, were not permitted to engage aboriginal labour, inasmuch as that Japanese is practically working
for himself? Ido not think that interferes with anybody. There are plenty of crews available for all
our needs.
3417. By Mr. Bennett : Could the beche-de-mer vessels be run as profitably by white men as masters as
they are by Japanese ? Yes ;if you could get the proper class of white men.
3418. By Mr. Douglas-. At Cooktown and other places in the South the competition between the
Japanese and European masters is just as keen in the beche-de-mer industry as it is here in the pearling
industry, and strong representations have been made that the Japanese should not be permitted to engage
in the industry in competition with whites, just the same as the agitation here regarding their competition
with white divers—Do you think it would be desirable to conserve the beche-de-mer industry for the
benefit of whites as well as the pearl-shelling industry? Yes, under proper conditions.
3419. What are the conditions? Similar to what we are trying to bring about in the pearl-shelling
industry.
3420. If possible, get Europeans in charge of the beche-de-mer boats ? Yes.
Joseph Leathom Wassell, Medical Practitioner, and Government Medical Officer, Thursday Island,
examined;
3421. By the Chairman : What are you ? A medical practitioner ?
3422. You are also Government Medical Officer? Yes.
3423. How long have you been resident at Thursday Island ? A little over seven years.
3124. I suppose the occasional fatalities in the pearl-shelling industry have been brought under your
notice ? Yes.
3425. What do you think the deaths have been attributable to? To obstruction of the circulation by
the escape of nitrogen from the blood on the return of the divers to the surface.
3426. Has diving in very deep water acclerated death ? The breathing of compressed air leads to the
absorption of gases into the blood while they are under the pressure.
3427. Su that the deeper the water the greater the danger ? Yes.
3428. By Mr. Bennett : How does the absorption of gas manifest itself ? When the pressure is lessened
the gas escapes from the blood, much the same as gas escapes from soda water, resulting in a collection
of this gas in the heart, or in injury to the nervous system by the formation of the gas there.
3429. And does it manifest itself in the form of paralysis? Yes. According to the situation in which
it occurs it leads to palsies and paralyses. If it occurs in the blood vessels in the main veins it obstructs
the circulation, and men die from asphyxia.
3430. By the Chairman : Is diving an occupation that is necessarily detrimental to human life? It is a
very dangerous occupation.
3431. I presume that most of the deaths have resulted from diving in water over 30 fathoms deep?
Yes.
3432. With a less pressure such as would be experienced at 18 or 20 fathoms, would a healthy young
white man be able to continue working as a diver ? There is no difference. A man of one race possesses
no physical attributes which render him a better diver than a man of another race. The danger exists in
every case, especially when the depth is over 15 fathoms.
3433. But does not the danger decrease if the diving is confined to shallower water ? Yes, provided the
time of exposure to the pressure is the same. An exposure to pressure for a long time at a depth of
15 fathoms would be as dangerous as a short exposure at a depth somewhat greater.
3434. The danger increases wheu the diver remains down too long ? The danger increases when he is
down fora long time under water, or when he is down in deeper water for short periods.
3435. Evidence has been given here that Japanese are often down from sunrise to sunset —I presume
that in a short time that would prove fatal to a white man ? The great danger is in the mode in which
they come away from the pressure. If they come away from the pressure quickly they are in great
danger.
3436. If they are pulled up quickly ? Yes. If they take some time in returning to the surface the
gases absorbed under the pressure have time to be eliminated under the decreased pressure.
3437. Then you would class diving for a man of any nationality as a hazardous occupation ? Yes.
J. L. Wassell.

J■ L- Wassell.
12 June, 1908.
3438. By Mr. Bennett : Given a man ordinarily healthy, and physically fairly strong, what should be the ■
length of his working life as a diver under the most favourable conditions that usually obtain ? I am
afraid that I cannot answer that question without statistics.
3439. Have you any statistics at your command that would enable you to answer the question later on ?
I think I can obtain some data. I know that diving shortens a man’s life. He cannot last as long as in
other occupations.
3440. Then, as a matter of ascertained fact, diving is not conducive to longevity ? No; it tends to
shorten a man’s life.
3441. You have had considerable experience in treating divers ? I have.
3442. What are the most common diseases arising from their occupation from which they suffer ?
Paralyses, palsies of various portions of the body, a tendency to joint pains resembling rheumatism—
they call it rheumatism—and acute pains of nerve irritation in various parts of the body.
3443. Any pulmonary complaints ? Yes, there is a tendency to pulmonary troubles, especially in those
who use big pressures—asthma and bronchitis.
3444. That is pretty well the list ? Yes.
3445. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that a European, before engaging in diving, should be obliged
to undergo a medical examination with a view to protecting himself, perhaps, from some internal trouble
of which he may not be aware —some complaint affecting the heart, for instance ? It would be advisable
that all divers should have a sound circulation, although the pressure in itself, as pressure, does not lead
to any mechanical injury. It is the absorption of the gases which will take place in any human being
subjected to the pressure. Still in many cases one finds that there are internal troubles,, such as
haemorrhage, the liability to which is increased if the circulating mechanism is diseased.
344G. By Mr. Bennett : That is cerebral or spinal haemorrhage ? Yes.
(Thursday Island.)
SATURDAY, 13 JUNE, 1908.
Peesent :
Captain J. MACKAY (i Chairman ) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A,
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Thomas Champeenohne Mat, Auctioneer, and Secretary to the Torres Strait Pearl-shellers’ Association
examined:
3447. By the Chairman : What are you ? I am an auctioneer. I appear here this morning chiefly as the
secretary to the Torres Strait Pearl-shellers’ Association.
3448. How long have you been secretary to that Association ? A little over two years,
3149. How long has the Association been in existence ? I think it started in 1902 or 1903, but I have
not made a memorandum about it.
3450. What are the objects of the Association ? It was started with the idea of exercising a general
control over the working of the pearl-shell industry here.
3451. How many pump boats are represented in the Association ? 107 at present.
3452. By Mr. Bennett: Are you sure there are 107 ? No—not pump boats. The number of pump
boats is eighty-three.
3453. By Mr. Douglas : Are they all licensed boats ? Yes; of course, the majority are pump boats.
3454. By the Chairman : Are they registered at Thursday Island ? The port of license is Thursday
Island. Some of them are registered in Townsville, but I do not know how many.
3455. By Mr. Bennett: They are all registered in Australia ? Yes.
3456. By the Chairman : Have you had any practical experience in the pearl-shelling or beche-de-mer
industries ? I have in pearl-shelling, but not in the beche-de-mer industry.
3457. As a manager in the pearl-shelling industry ? I have had some experience as a shelter —as the
proprietor of swimming diving boats.
3458. By Mr. Bennett : You have been associated with the clerical work of a large pearling fleet, have
you not? Yes.
3459. By the Chairman : And you were there able to get some experience relative to the prosecution of
the industry ? Yes.
3460. By Mr Bennett : Were you not on a fleet station for some time ? Yes.
3461. By the Chairman : Can you tell us whether the pearling beds have been worked with any regard
to the preservation of the industry ? Not beyond the legal limit fixed for shell, and the legal closure of
beds.
3462. By Mr. Bennett-. The enactment of an exportable shell limit, and the regulation closing certain
areas, are the only evidences of regard shown for the preservation of the industry, so far as you know ?
I think so.
3463. Bu the Chairman -. Can you give us any idea of the present condition of the pearling grounds ? No,
except from figures.
8464. Have you got figures and papers relating to the condition of the grounds that you can tender as
evidence? Yes. I have compiled some shelling statistics which go back to 1887, and I have endeavoured
to give the average catch of the pump boats as far as possible.
3465, By Mr Douglas : Will you give us a brief outline of the main headings ? Yes. Starting with the
year 1887, I have prepared a return showing the number of boats licensed. All the boats licensed have
the right to work with a pump. The return also shows the year when the limit was fixed at 6 inches—
that was in 1892 and when it was reduced to 5 inches —the end of 1896. It also shows the average
catch of a pump boat per year. I can only give that information from 1897, when it was as high as
6 tons 7 cwt. pjr boat. In 1904 it fell to 2 tons 10 cwt. I have not given any average at all for 1905,
because in that year 109 vessels left here, and went to the Arbe Islands, so that it was impossible to give
T. C. May.
18 June, 1908.


T. 0. May.
13 June, 1908.
an average. In 1907 the average catch was 4 tons 15 cwt. per boat—the biggest since 1897 ; but this is
accounted for to a very great extent by the large quantity of shell which was brought in from the deep
water on the Darnley ground. lam not able to say how much was brought from there, but it was a big
lot.
3466. By Mr. Bennett-. You know that was a large factor in the catch? I know from my experience in
Bowden and Mackenzie’s fleet that such was the case. All the figures given in this return are compiled
from official reports. Perhaps I should tell you that the average given in the reports of the Government
Eesident for some years past have been made up on the total number of pump and swimming boats
combined. He has divided the catch by that number of boats. That average would not be of much
value.
3467. I suppose you are aware that the Government Eesident gets his figures from the Inspector of
Pearl-shell Fisheries ? Yes. I have taken the average catch for swimming boats as If tons per boat per
year, and deducted the approximate total catch of those boats from the total catch of all boats, aud have
so arrived at what must be the .average catch of a pump boat for the year.
3468. By the Chairman : Do you tender that return ? Yes. [ Document produced. Vide Appendix Xl. ]
3469. Have you any more documents to hand in ? I can hand in “ The Shallow Water Divers’
Agreement,” if you think it would be of any use.
3470. By Mr. Bennett : Mr. Costin, the Shipping Master, has already produced that, but you can hand
it in for comparison ? Very well. [Document produced .]
3471. By Mr. Douglas-. Can you give the Commission any explanation with regard to that agreement?
That agreement was brought into force owing to what was called a strike at the beginning of this year.
3472. Is it substantially the same as the agreement for the previous year ? Yes ; it is on the same basis,
except that divers have now to pay for their own dresses, for their own warm underclothing, and for
their own drift lines. The drift line provision is practically a dead letter, as the drift line is very
rarely used.
3473. Can you give us an idea of the average catch obtained by shallow water boats as distinct from the
catch of deep water boats ? Yes; I think I can get very close to it for 1907.
3474. Will you supplement the return you handed in by giving as that information? Yes. [Vide
Appendix XII. j
3475. What do you estimate would be the cost of wages, provisions, aud other expenses payable by the
diver during a period under the Shallow Water Divers’ Agreement? I would rather not give a rough
estimate of that.
3476. With regard to the average catch of 4 tons 15 cwt. for pump-boats last year —Was that the result
of continuous work during the twelve mouths, or was there an interval at the beginning of the year
when they did not work on account of bad weather, or when the boats were laid up ? There was the usual
delay.
3477. By Mr. Bennett-. The statistics regarding pearl-shell are always drawn up for a whole year ? Yes.
3478. And the statistics of one year run into the statistics of another year with regard to that interval?
Yes.
3479. So that one year tallies with the other all the same ? Yes.
3480. By Mr. Douglas : Can you give us any information with regard to the license fees or other charges
that are paid in Western Australia and at Port Darwin ? I have a record of the license fees per boat.
3481. If you can supply it, it will be useful to the Commission? [Return subsequently supplied. Vide
Appendix XIII.~\ You asked me if there were any difference between the Shallow Water Diver’s
Agreement of this year and that of last year. There is this difference : that in this year’s agreement the
amount paid per ton for shell from localities that are known to produce very second-class shell is
considerably lower than the amount paid for shell from the Old Ground.
3482. By the Chairman : Have you anything else that you wish to say? Nothing occurs to me at the
moment. I have tried to get everything possible into that return.
3483. If anything else occurs to you, you can give it to us later on? I will.
3484. Do you think that the industry could be carried on with white divers? No.
3485. Can you suggest any methods for inducing white men to become divers ? I can only think of one
thing—that is the limitation of the number of licenses', and that future fresh licenses should be issued to
white men only.
3486. No more licenses should be issued to aliens? No.
3487. By Mr. Bennett -. Except to those already engaged in the industry ? That would create a
dangerous monopoly.
3488. By Mr. Douglas : You are referring really to new boats ? Yes.
3489. By Mr. Bennett-, The Chairman’s question referred to divers? I mean that the number of boats
should be limited to the number at present engaged in the industry. Let coloured men go in those
boats; but do not let them go in any fresh boats that may come into the industry.
3490. Then you would retain to the present boats the right of employing coloured divers ? I cannot see
how it could be got over on the present figures.
3491. By the Chairman : Then the employment of coloured divers would not cease while the present
boats are in existence ? At present I cannot see any way of preventing that state of affairs.
3492. Would not that mean the employment of coloured divers for a number of years? Not if the
white man showed himself a better diver.
3493. By Mr. Douglas-. If the catch of shell on the grounds increased, and white divers were forth-
coming, do you think it would be reasonable to reduce the number, of alien divers’ licenses, say by ten
annually? Yes, provided white men were available.
3494. By the Chairman -. What do you think would be the result if you had no Japanese divers ? The
boats would have to lie up.
3495. Do you not think it would induce white men to undertake the work? Not under present
conditions.
8496. But if the conditions were improved by legislation or otherwise ? You cannot improve the natural
conditions. You cannot make the beds give more shell.
3497. Do you think the number of boats now engaged in the industry is sufficient for the amount of shell
to be obtained ? Quite. I have gone through the number of boats at present engaged in swimming,
diving, and in beche-de-mer fishing. Among them there are thirty-eight that are quite fit to work with


a pump under the present conditions ; and, if the beche-de-mer industry does not improve, that is their
natural avenue of work.
3498. To go back to the pearl-shelling ? Yes. There are some first-class vessels, such as the “Venus,”
“ Fairy,” “Venture,” and “Lucky.”
3499. Can you suggest any means by which white divers can be substituted for coloured divers within a
reasonable time ? lam afraid 1 cannot.
3500. Does the law regulating the industry require amending in any way, or can anything be done to
render the industry more attractive and remunerative ? I think it would be bettor from every point of
view if it were rendered impossible for anybody but a British subject to have pearl-shell in his possession,
or to buy pearl-shell or pearls; but as far as the actual working of the Act is concerned I cannot suggest
anything.
3501. By Mr. Bennett : "What about the license fee for boats —Can you suggest any alteration in that
direction which would be advantageous—At present the license fee is £3 for the first 10 tons and 10s.
per ton over that tonnage ? It seems a pity to load a good boat.
3502. Do you think a uniform fee for pump boats would be preferable? I do.
3503. And the same for swimming diving boats ? Yes.
3504. Should the swimming diving license fee be more or less than the fee for pump boats ? Considerably
less.
3505. By the Chairman : I presume you transact a considerable amount of business for the Association ?
Yes.
3506. You are aware that the Sub-Collector of Customs issues the boat licenses ? Yes. ■
3507. Do you think it would be more convenient if they were issued by the Inspector of Pearl-shell
Fisheries, and that all the official business transactions should be conducted in one office instead of in
two P It would be much better for all concerned to have the business under one control.
3508. By Mr. Douglas: Would you be able, from the records of the Association, to give us statistics
showing the net return for the different classes of shell—Old Ground and deep-water shell—to the
shellers for the last ten years ? I cannot obtain that information. There are no statistics available.
3509. It might be useful also to let us know the average expense of selling the shell in London? Yes ;
I have prepared a return. [Vide Appendix XIV.] May I say one thing further? I had a lot of
experience as a swimming diver. I lost a lot of money at the business, because I could not get enough
shell, owing to the depletion of the grounds.
3510. By Mr. Bennett: To which grounds do you more particularly allude? I was working from Badu
right up to Saibai, on the New Guinea coast. I can recall occasions when working there, and getting a
large quantity of shell, when we were pounced upon by a number of pump boats which could not get
anything like the same quantity as we were getting. When they found that we were getting more than
they were getting, they came and thrust us out of it. One trick that they adopt in order to do that with
swimming diving boats is to throw dirt and grease into the. water to attract the sharks. On three
occasions during two years I had to take my boats away from first-class results, simply owing to the men
being attacked by sharks which were brought about by the divers in the pump boats throwing over grease
and anything else they could' get for the purpose of bringing the sharks.
3511. Did you not retaliate by making the water muddy, or something of that sort? Our men used to
play tricks with the divers down below. The result was that those tactics, combined with the low price
of shell, compelled the swimming divers to go out of the industry. Two of them went insolvent. Had
there not been such a crowd of boats there then we would have got on, and would have been in existence
as swimming divers to-day. If the boats were limited to the present number, roughly speaking, I should
look forward to the prospect of starting swimming diving again in another two or three years, and to
making it pay, because those beds will have grown some shell, and I can get on to them.
3512. By Mr. Douglas : What labour did you utilise in the swimming diving ? Torres Strait island
natives.
3513. Were they working their own boats also at. that time ? There were some in existence, but not
very many.
3514. Were the Government supplying them with boats at that time ? They had just started.
3515. Did that interfere with your operations ? Not to any great extent.
3516. The men you had working still continued to work ? Yes.
3517. Would you have been able to re-engage them when their agreements expired ? I would, had it
not been suggested that they should be given boats at Badu.
3518. What average wages were you paying? £2 a month.
3519. Do you think they would earn as much as that working in their own boats ? I think they were
far better off financially under the old wages system.
3520. They pay no license fees ? No.
3521. Did they pay license fees when you w'ere in competition with them ? No.
3522. Nothing? JSothing.
3523. Did they have any advantages that were detrimental to your making a success of the business ?
They were not limited to men. They had not to sign on and discharge men. They could use any men
they liked.
3524. Did they buy their provisions and sell their produce through an agent ? They did that through a
Government agent.
3525. By Mr, Bennett: Do you know anything of that matter fromyour own knowledge? Ido not.
3526. By Mr. Douglas: Do you know that it was all done through the Government representative ?
Yea.
3527. And that the Government did all they could to assist those men to get their own boats ? Yes.
3528. And men like yourself had to pay full license fees and all the other charges in connection with the
industry ? That was the case.
3529. Do you think you could buy your stores cheaper than a Goverment representative could? —Would
the cost of production to you be any more ? The cost of production to me would be a great deal more
because I would have to feed my men regularly and properly.
3530. And in the other case ? They worked just as they chose.
3531. By Mr. Bennett: They lived ashore on their own islands f Yes.
T. C. May.
13 June, 1908.


T. C. May.
13 June, 1908.
3532. And they fished in waters which belonged more or less to their own islands ? I have no knowledge
of that.
!. 3533. Did those men pay for their boats ? The boats were given to the men originally.
3534. On terms ? Yes.
3535. Then they paid for them ? Yes.
3536. On what would be called a paying agreement ? They worked them out.
3537. So that the men paid for their boats ? I believe that in some instances the boats have been paid
' for.
3538. If they were not paid for, the boats were taken away ? I have heard of one instance where a
boat was taken from the natives.
3539. So that really the island natives were supplying themselves with boats under Government
supervision—That is what it amounts to? Hardly; because they were given the boats without any
security at all. The whole thing was financed by the Government.
3510. Do you know that as a matter of fact ? I know that the natives had no capital to put into the
business.
3541. Before those boats were supplied to the natives by the Government, had the natives purchased
boats from Thursday Island residents on practically the same terms. Yes ; they had entered into buying
agreements.
3542. And they had to pay for the boats bought from Thursday Island residents with the produce they
obtained? Yes.
3543. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you remember some natives of Darnley Island, the sons of Joe Eotumah?
Yes.
3544. I think you were in Mr. Bowden’s offioe when they worked a boat on the share system —Do you
remember that ? Yes.
3545. Do you think that, if the island natives had worked for wages at £2 per month and saved their
money, they would have been able to buy boats, such as they got from the Government, on better terms
than they got from the Government? Undoubtedly.
3546. By Mr. Bennett : Could they have done so, and at the same time have maintained their families ?
Yes.
3547. Saved all their wages and maintained their families as well? Just as well as they have done since
they got boats of their own.
Kenneth Ord Mackenzie, Pearl-Sheller and a member of the firm of Bowden and Mackenzie
examined :
3548. By the Chairman ; What are you? lam a pearl-sheller, associated with Mr. Herbert Bowden.
3549. You have had experience both as an employer and manager ? Yes.
3550. How many boats do your firm own ? We own nineteen boats at present.
.3551. Pump boats? All pump boats.
3552. They are registered within the State, I presume ? They are all licensed in the State. Some are
registered at Sydney, and others at Townsville,
3553. By Mr. Douglas: What is the length of your experience in connection with the industry ? Since
1900 I have been a shcller.
3554. You were here prior to that? Yes.
3555. By the Chairman : Have the pearling-grounds, in your opinion, been worked with any regard to
the preservation of the industry ? No. They have been worked for the best results from the shellers’
point of view.
3556. Where the most shell could be got ? Yes.
3557. What is the present condition of the pearling-grounds—Are they partially depleted P Yes.
3558. Can you state which grounds are most depleted ? They are generally depleted.
3559. Throughout? Yes.
3560. Can you suggest any reason for that depletion ? Over-fishing.
3561. Do you think there are too many boats engaged in the industry? Ido not think there are too
many at present.
3562. Do you think the present number should be increased ? Ido not.
3563. By Mr. Bennett: What is the present number? About 112.
3564. We have been told that certain boats may be brought in from the the beche-de-mer fishery, if
circumstances warrant ? Just so.
3565. They would bring the number up to about 150 —Do you think that would be too many ? It is
outside the number the grounds could support at present.
3566. By the Chairman : Do you think the present deposit of shell is sufficient to keep the vessels now
engaged in the industry profitably employed without further depletion of the beds ? I think so.
3567. Do you consider that the number-of vessels licensed for employment in the industry should be
limited? Yes.
3568. To wjiat number? Under present conditions the limit should not exceed the 130 or 140 boats that
are likely to be available for fishing now.
3569. On what basis do you suggest licenses should he issued so that no person should be unduly
favoured, and so that no monopoly should be created? Ido not quite follow you.
3570. By Mr. Bennett : Other persons than those now engaged in the industry may want to obtain
licenses for boats—On what basis would you suggest that future licenses should be issued, so that the
industry should not pass into the hands of a monopoly ? I would limit the employment of alien divers
to the present boats, and, if licenses were issued to additional boats, I would insist upon the employment
in those boats of white divers only.
3571. By Mr. Douglas: Do you suggest that alien divers should be permitted to be employed on the
vessels at present licensed as long as the employers choose to employ those vessels in the industry ? That
the present boats should employ either alien or white divers.
3572. By Mr. Bennett -. But that no new boats should be licensed ? New boats might be licensed, but
only for white divers. Then there would bo no monopoly.
K. O.
Mackenzie.
13 June, 1908.


3573. If boats with white divers are brought into the industry, what is to be done with those employing
coloured divers—Are they to be put out of it ? No.
3574. Then you would increase the number of boats engaged in the industry, provided they employed
white divers ? Tes. That brings me to the matter of cultivation.
3575. By the Chairman : What is your opinion as lo the probable effect of closing beds periodically as a
means of maintaining and possibly increasing the supply of pearl-shell—Would the closure of beds tend
to increase the supply of pearl-shell ? Not to any great extent.
3576. Do you approve of closing a portion of the areas ? Yes.
3577. Which areas would you recommend for closure ? Areas in deep water producing a poor quality of
shell.
3578. For how long would you suggest that they should be closed ? I would not like to say. We want
expert opinion upon that matter.
3579. By Mr. Bennett: Would you close any of the inshore beds ? .No.
3580. What about Endeavour Strait ? Ido not favour closing Endeavour Strait.
3581. By the Chairman -. What do you think should he the minimum size limit of exportable shell ? I
would prefer that it should remain as it is at present, that is 5 inches.
3582. Do you think any restriction should be placed on the size of pump vessels employed in the pearl-
shelling industry ? It is not necessary to go over from 20 to 25 tons for pump vessels.
3583. What is your opinion about floating stations, working with and controlling fleets of diving vessels
—Are you in favour of that system? Having regard to the commercial interests of Thursday Island, I
am not in favour of floating stations ; but looked at solely from the shellers’ point of view, it is the most
business-like way of shelling.
3584. By Mr. Douglas: But with a view to the industry being preserved and not over-fished ? The
shore system is the better.
3585. Do you think the floating-station system tends to over-fishing more than the shore system ? Tes ;
there is so much concentration with the floating-station system.
3586. By the Chairman : You think the floating-station system tends to the depletion of the beds ? Tes.
3587. With regard to the vessels used for pump diving, what maximum size do you consider necessary
for efficient working, providing at the same time for the safety and comfort of the diver and crew ? Most
of the boats at the present time are from 15 to 17 tons, Queensland measurement.
3588. Do they provide all the comfort and accommodation it is possible to get in a boat of that size?
Tes; the accommodation is sufficient.
3589. By Mr. Douglas: The size of vessels used for working luggers has been somewhat increased of
late years ? Tes.
3590. Is that due to the fact that the boats have to go further out ? Further afield into more open
waters.
3591. Could a 12-ton boat be used with a great deal of profit to the owners ? There is more comfort for
those employed in a large boat than in a small boat.
3592. An 18-ton boat would draw more water than a 12-ton boat? Only about 18 inches or 2 feet.
3593. Would that not be a material factor in working inshore beds? No ; because no boat works over
the top of a reef, and there is bold water right up to the reef.
3594. By Mr. Bennett : None of the vessels are engaged in pearling work at any place, even on the
inshore beds, where a draught of 10 feet would really matter ? No. lam speaking of pump boats only.
3595. By Mr. Douglas-. You were engaged on a floating station for a number of years ? Yes.
3596. You were manager ? Manager, and latterly manager and sailing master combined.
3597. Holding a certificate from the Marine Board ? Tes, a coasting certificate.
3598. You are not working the industry now from a floating station ? No.
3599. Can you tell us why the change came about ? In the latter years of the schooner system we made
losses.
3600. It was necessary to reduce expenses? Tes,and to make an alteration to induce the divers to put
forth their best efforts.
3GOI. Were they working under a disadvantage when w.orking from the floating stations ? Tes ; there
were several stations working from the shore, and the divers were giving better results, including pearls,
and were evidently more contented,
3602. You think the competition with the shore boats led to the abandonment of floating stations ?
Mainly.
3603. What year was it when the Clark combination fleets went to Dutch waters ? In 1905.
3604. What were the reasons alleged for their leaving Torres Strait ? They were losing money ; they
could not make it pay.
3605. Their catch of shell being small? Tes.
3606. Were their expenses abnormally high ? The expenses are a little higher working on the schooner
system.
3607. Were the labour conditions detrimental to their successful operations ? Labour was becoming
scarce, but we were getting assistance in regard to labour.
3608. Did you ever have any difficulty in getting permission from the Commonwealth Government to
indent labour? No; we always got permission to indent the labour we required.
3609. All reasonable requests were granted ? Yes.
3610. Were the conditions in any way harsh or stringent ? No, except with regard to bonds. They were
troublesome; but they partly remedied that afterwards.
3611. By Mr. Bennett-. Was there any instance of the bond ever being enforced? I know of no
instance.
3612. By Mr. Douglas -. Was the competition for divers keen at that time ? Tes.
3613. What were the results of that competition ? Advances were too high.
3614. Did the divers work one employer against another with the object of getting increased wages ot
advances ? Tes.
3615. Those things generally tended to render pearl-shelling unprofitable, at any rate with the floating-
station system ? Certainly.

3616. Since the departure of a portion of the fleet to Dutch waters in 1905, have the beds had an
opportunity of recuperating at all ? Tes, inasmuch as the fishing has been reduced approximately bj
' one-half.
’‘3617. Have the boats that remained been working in Torres Strait continuously ever since? Tes.
3618. By Mr. Bennett : Subject to the usual conditions of wind, tide, and weather ? Certainly, and
paying on and off, and so on.
3619. By Mr. Douglas: Has the reduction in the number of boats at work resulted in any quantity of
young shell being deposited on the Old Ground ? I think so.
3620. Is that the information you have obtained ? Prom practical results, I think so.
3621. Are the boats working on the Old Ground at the present time ? IVhen weather permits.
3622. Tou have been in the diving dress yourself down at the bottom ? I have been down a number of
times.
3623. It has been stated that when the weeds and grass are high the shell has a certain amount of
natural protection from being fished too close ? Tes. Towards the end of the year, before the grass
has ripened, it is difficult to get shell on account of its growth; and it affords a natural protection.
3624. By Mr. Bennett : That grass, as it is called, is really seaweed ? Tes, dugong grass.
3625. It is really the best protection that the shell on the Old Ground has ? Tes.
3626. It is better than the weather ? Tes.
3627. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the Old Ground is so situated that it forms a natural place for the
shell to deposit itself ? I do. All conditions point to the Old Ground being the most favourable place
for shell to recuperate.
3628. By Mr. Bennett: It is the favourite ground for the pearl-oyster ? Tes.
3629. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that the narrow passages between the islands are places where
spat is readily deposited? No. Taking the passages between the reefs as a whole, the shell does not
lodge rapidly. It does in the pockets and bays in reefs where there are eddies and a slackness of
water. Where there is practically no current the spat lodges, but not in the middle of the passages,
where there is a scour.
3630. By the Chairman : Is the current too strong ? The conditions are not favourable to the production
of shell. The bottom is too clean.
3631. By Mr. Bennett: That is due to the current, of course ? Tes.
•3632. By Mr Douglas : When you were working on the floating-station system you always endeavoured
to open the shell obtained by the divers yourself with the object of getting pearls? Tes.
3633. Can you tell us whether the divers would wilfully pick up shell under 5 inches in diameter with the
object of getting any pearls there might be in them ? There is very little of that done, if any.
3634. Tou do not think there is any wilful destruction of shell ? Ido not think so. I have never
observed it, and I have collected shell regularly with a collecting boat.
3635. By Mr. Bennett : Would it not be an absolute waste of time for a diver to pick up all the small
shell, and would it not interfere with the prosecution of his proper work ? Certainly. Since we have
come ashore I have results to prove it.
3636. Would the possibility of securing pearls justify a diver, even to himself, in picking up small shell ?
I do not think so.
3637. By Mr. Douglas : Do you find that some pearling grounds are more prolific in pearls than others ?
Tes.
3638. Do you think that shell between 5 and 6 inches produces more pearls than much larger shell ? I
have found the best pearls in healthy shell between 6 and 1\ inches.
3639. By Mr. Bennett : Have you found good pearls in such shell ? I have.
3640. Would you expect to find an A 1 pearl in a shell between 5 and 6 inches ? I have never found a
good pearl in a shell under 5| or 6 inches.
3641. You suggested that the number of licenses to pump boats should be limited —Would you also
suggest that the number of licenses to swimming diving boats should be limited ? Certainly. The
limitation should apply to swimming divers also. It would not be fair to allow them to have a
preponderance of boats.
3642. If the licenses with regard to them were unlimited, would it not tend to defeat the object of
limiting the number of pump boat licenses? Tes.
3643. Other things being equal, from the point of view of profit, with the beds in their present
condition, you would prefer the floating-station system ? Tes. 1 would get better results.
3644. By Mr. Douglas: That is if everybody else did the same ? Tes. I would gain bettor immediate
results as a sheller.
3645. By Mr. Bennett : But would it not lead again to the depletion of the beds ? Not if the boats
were limited in number.
3646. Tou still think that even under the best conditions, having regard to the preservation of the
industry, the number of boats should bo limited under either the shore or the floating-station system ?
Certainly.
3647. By Mr. Douglas-. Tou mentioned that you thought certain areas should be closed—Certain areas
have been closed in the past ? Tes. During my time the Darnley Island area and Endeavour Strait have
been closed.
3648. Was there any poaching done upon those areas ? Poaching has been done on both areas.
3649. Is it possible, under the present Act, to enforce the closure of grounds, bearing in mind that it’is
necessary for the inspector actually to see a diver bring the shell from the ground before he can obtain
a conviction ? Tes ; he has great difficulty in doing that.
3650. Can you suggest any amendment by which it would be possible to prevent poaching ? It would
require some stringent regulations.
3651. At present the action is against the owner of the vessel—Have you any suggestion to offer as to
whether the persons in charge of the boats should be dealt with ? If the diver disregards his orders the
owner suffers, and that is unfair.
3652. Do you think that divers should he prevented from working in deep water—apart from the question
of its being a producing ground—in order to prevent accidents? Tes. Ido not favour working in-the
deep water areas for two reasons. It is risky to life, and the shell is poor.


3653. Do you think a man can work in deep water without the greatest danger ? There is always risk in
working in deep water, even with the best precautions. Some hitch occurs which causes delay at the 5
bottom, which results in the death of the diver. ' f
3654. Shell is plentiful in the deeper water, and the diver is inclined to stay down too long ? There is a l3
tendency in that direction.
3655. By Mr. Bennett : Do you think that another reason why they should be closed is that those
grounds are valuable as spat-producing areas ? "Wherever there are deposits of shell spat is thrown off;
and with that object in view those grounds might he closed.
3656. You think the Darnley Island grounds should be closed rigidly ? Yes.
3657. Any other areas ? I would suggest the Mount Adolphus Ground.
3658. By Mr. Douglas-. "Would it he advisable to close the east coast of Queensland down to Cape
Grenville ? Without definite knowledge, particularly from the scientific point of view, I should not care
to advocate that. If it is proved that spat is carried up the coast to Torres Strait, I should say yes ; hut
otherwise I do not see any advantage in closing those grounds.
3659. By Mr. Bennett : You think that the question is one upon which we should obtain a scientific
opinion ? Most assuredly.
3660. Is closure of any value unless it is strictly enforced ? No.
3661. By the Chairman : Have you engaged in any experiments with a view to the propagation of the
pearl-oyster by cultivation ? No.
3662. Have you any knowledge of any experiments being made in that direction? I have very little
knowledge.
3663. By Mr. Bennett : I think you came here after the Friday Island experiment ? Yes, I came near
the end of it.
3664. Would the services of a practical marine biologist assist in preserving the industry and increasing
the amount of shell ? 1 think so.
3665. What localities do you suggest as most suitable for such experiments ? Almost any area in
Torres Strait, so that the shell under cultivation may throw off spat and fertilise the grounds generally.
3666. What do you think are the essentials to success in experiments in propagation ? First the
employment of a scientific man who is able to grapple with the subject.
3667. A practical marine biologist ? Yes ; that is the primary step. Secondly, he should not be bound
down witliin impossible limits of expenditure.
3668. Is not the establishment of a biological station an essential ? Certainly.
3669. By the Chairman : You were not here when Mr. Tosh was at Thursday Island ? I started shelling
a few months before Mr. Tosh left.
3670. You are not aware, then, of the steps taken by him ? I know very little of what he did.
3671. By Mr. Bennett -. Do you consider Wai-Weer a suitable place for the establishment of a biological
station ? I should say it would he better for experimental purposes, there being no room there for
expansion.
3672. By the Chairman-. You are aware that nearly all the divers employed in the industry at the present
time are Japanese ? I think every diver diving for shell at present is a Japanese.
3673. Do you consider that a desirable state of affairs ? I would like to see my own people benefiting
from the industry.
3674. Does that mean that you would like to see men of your own race take the place of Japanese as
divers ? With a view to inducing white divers to go into the industry, I would suggest that a school of
instruction for the training of divers be associated with the biological station. I ha,ve had no personal
experience of white divers.
3675. From what you know of the industry, do you think it possible that white men could perform the
work of diving ? Not under present conditions.
3676. What conditions do you chiefly refer to ? You might get an individual white diver, but you could
not get a number of white divers who would raise the same quantity of shell as the Japanese.
3677. By Mr. Douglas : White men are physically able to do the work ; but whether they would do it or
not would depend upon what money they could make out of it ? Yes.
3678. By the Chairman : If legislation were passed making it certain that the number of Japanese divers
would he restricted, would that not induce white men to take their places as they pass out ? They would
not come until there was more money to ho made out of it.
3679. Would a bonus induce them to come ? Very probably it would.
3680. What bonus would you suggest as a sufficient incentive ? Not having had any experience in
employing white divers, I cannot say definitely.
3681. You have heard of white divers being employed here? Yes.
3682. Have you ever heard the results obtained by white divers compared with those obtained by
Japanese? When white divers were employed here, shell was more plentiful than it is now, and more
easily obtained.
3683. Suppose the industry was made sufficiently attractive to induce a number of white men to go into
it on their own account, and not as employees ? If they are assisted, there is no reason why they should
not do that as far as I know.
3684. Then what would you suggest as the best method, under present conditions, of bringing about that
desirable change? I think it could only be brought about gradually.
3685. How would you suggest that it should be brought about gradually ? By limiting the employment
of alien divers to the boats at present licensed, and requiring that any other boats coming into the
industry shall employ only white divers. If it were found that the shell was gaining generally throughout
the Straits, the Government could increase the number of licenses.
3686. By Mr. Douglas : Licenses to aliens ? No. Fresh licenses to divers.
3687. You mean that if the shell began to increase, instead of allowing the number of boats to be
increased, some gradual reduction might be made in the number of alien divers’ licenses, with a view to
inducing white men to take up the work ? That would hardly be fair to those who have already put
their money into the industry.
3688. By the Chairman : I suppose you have no experience in regard to the effects of diving on white
men ? I have no experience. I have been on the bottom myself, hut have never been diving con-
tinuously ; but, provided a white man has ordinary physical stamina, I do not see why he should not do
the work as well as any man of any other nationality.

3689. At a reasonable depth ? Tes.
3690. You think, then, that diving could be carried on like any other calling? Tes.
* 3691. Do you consider the present system of basing the amount of the license fee on the tonnage of the
'• vessel satisfactory ? No ; I would sooner see it a fixed amount.
3692. For what reason do you desire that change ? The present system is a tax upon the improvement
of a boat in regard to size.
3693. Do you consider the present system of issuing licenses to divers and persons in charge satisfactory ?
I would like to see the boat license include the diver’s license.
3694. By Mr. Bennett-. How could you do that ? The diver’s name would have to be endorsed upon
the boat’s license, in the same way as the name of the master of a ship is endorsed upon the ship’s register.
3695. By the Chairman-. Do you suggest that as an improvement ? Tes.
3695a.'' Each person employed in a boat licensed under the Fisheries Act is licensed—Do you think that
system might be introduced into the pearl-shell industry ? That every man should be licensed ?
3696. Tes—Or are you in favour of the present system? lam in favour of the present system.
3697. Should a vessel be allowed to carry more than one diver? An emergency diver should be carried.
3698. To provide for cases of accident, I suppose ? If a boat is away out on the fishing grounds, and
the diver is indisposed, that boat should not be put out of action on that account.
3099. Then you think the number of divers should not be restricted to one for each boat ? That is so.
3700. By Mr. Bennett -. "When fishing in shallow water it is immaterial whether a boat carries one diver
or three divers, so far as the work done is concerned, except in case of accident? One diver is all that
is necessary in shallow water.
3701. We have heard of boats carrying two and three divers, and I have heard of one carrying four—
That is only for work in deep water ? Tes.
3702. Where a diver only does one dip a day ? Precisely ; and they take their dip in turn when the tide
is slack.
3703. What do you think about introducing a system under which a diver might obtain a certificate of
competency which he would retain during good behaviour, and for which he would simply have to pay
one fee? That would be a very good thing. I have employed a diver, and then discovered that he had a
physical defect—heart or otherwise.
3704. By the Chairman -. Suppose a white man were to be employed by you as a diver, do you not think
that he should produce a medical certificate of fitness ? He is taking the risk.
3705. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think it would be advantageous to the divers ? Yes ; but the examination
should be made at their own expense.
3706. Do you think that the present system, under which a man can go into the Custom House, tender
£l, and get a license, irrespective of physical fitness or competency, is a good one ? No.
3707. By the Chairman -. What depth were you down ? Seven fathoms.
3708. It”would not be very hazardous work there? No. Anything up to ten or eleven fathoms is safe
for diving.
3709. How long do you think a person diving at that depth should remain below ? Divers do not stay
down any fixed time. They stay down according to the requirements of circumstances. I have known
divers stay down for hours, but I have not seen a diver down for more than from two to three hours.
3710. Does the diver send the shell up from the bottom ? Tes ; I have seen a diver send the shell up
from the bottom without coming up himself.
3711. But that is not the custom, is it ? It is not the custom. The diver brings the shell up himself, as
a rule, when he wishes to come up for a blow. He can carry all the shell he can find.
3712. By Mr. Bennett-. Working drift diving on the Old Ground, would it be practicable for a diver to
stay on the bottom all day—Would he not have to come up when the boat got to the end of its drift and
go down again ? Tes. The shell on the Old Ground is in patches, and, when the diver has gone over a
patch, he comes up and goes down again. In prospecting I have known divers to remain below for long
periods, but not in regular work.
3713. By the Chairman-. Was the boat drifting? Tes.
3714. By Mr. Douglas: Have you found the Japanese the best ot the alien divers who have been here ?
Tes, without doubt.
3715. What do you estimate would be the average annual earnings of a diver under present conditions,
excluding pearls ? His earnings do not amount to much until he gets 4 tons of shell.
3716. Until he gets 4 tons of shell he does not get anything ? Tes ;he is earning money, but he is
not making a'very handsome thing out of it.
3717. By Mr. Bennett: What would he get out of 4 tons of shell ? On a 4-ton catch, irrespective of
pearls, he would make about £5O.
3718. If he got 5 tons ? It would increase by the full amount of his “ lay.”
3719. Then he would get about £l3O per annum ? About that.
3720. With a catch of 6 tons he would make about £2lO ? Tes ; and so on
3721. By Mr. Douglas : In addition to that, ho would have the value of all pearls ? Yes.
3722. You have no means of knowing what pearls the divers get under the present system? I have no
idea at all. I know what pearls we got when collecting shell, and I can arrive at an average from that.
3723. What would you estimate the average at ? On the schooner system, when we were collecting the
shell, we got an average of £4O to £5O a boat per annum.
3724. By Mr. Bennett: Was that an average over a number of years ? Yes.
3725. By Mr. Douglas: Possibly there may have been other pearls that you did not get under that
system ? Quite possibly. There may have been pearls stolen.
3726. Have there been any improvements in the pumps, the piping, or the diving dress during recent
years ? There has been no marked improvement. The best that are made are employed.
3727. Have any attempts been made to improve the dress for deep-water diving ? The piping and the
dresses have had improvements made in regard to durability.
3728. Is the gear better than it was ten or twenty years ago, as a whole—ls the Heinke pump, for
instance, better than the Siebe and Gorman pump? I prefer the Heinke pump on account of its
simplicity ; but for the results to the diver there has been very little improvement, if any, during the last
ten years.


K. O.

13 June, 1909.
3729. By Mr. Bennett : Any improvement that has been made has been mainly in the increase of
cylinders, has it not ? The cylinders have been practically the same all the time I have been shelling.
8730. There are 2,3, and 4 cylinder pumps ? For shallow-water diving the 3-cylinder pump is universally
used. There are a few instances of 4-cylinder pumps being used for diving at a great depth.
8781. By Mr. Douglas: With regard to the cost of gear generally—pumps, rubber hose, sails, canvas,
and different things that you have to import, has the recent tariff increased the price ? Yes; prices
generally have advanced.
8732. That has tended to increase the cost of producing shell ? Yes.
3733. Can you give us any idea of the cost of producing shell, including repairs to boats, and all expenses
in connection with producing shell and shipping it to London ? It is placed on the jetty here for export
at from £125 to £l3O a ton.
3734. By the Chairman : What is the freight home? 525. a ton measurement. It costs from £l9 to
£22 a ton to pack, case, and sell the shell.
3735. By Mr Douglas : The shell is sold in London by public auction? Yes.
3736. You have been to London ? Yes, and witnessed a public sale.
3737. Have you been through any of the shell factories? No.
3738. By Mr. Bennett: What is the total cost of putting shell actually on the London market, including
the cost of production and everything else? It costs from £145 to £l5O a ton, excluding deep-water
boats.
3739. By Mr. Douglas : Then there is absolutely no profit for the owner at present prices? No.
3740. From your past experience of the fluctuations of the market, what is the maximum price the man
who works up the pearl-shell can afford to give without having to resort to substitutes for pearl-shell ?
When shell advanced to a high price about 1903, it was generally stated that substitutes were intro-
duced ; but since shell has fallen in price, I have not heard much of the introduction of substitutes.
3741. But I suppose there is a limit to which buyers will go ? Up to £2OO.
3742. Do you think distributors could afford to give that price without interfering with the demand for
shell? Approximately, I think so.
3743. If it could be arranged that you could get such a price, it would give a working profit to the
producers of shell ? Exactly.
3744. By Mr. Bennett: Under present conditions ? Yes.
3745. By Mr. Douglas: Has any attempt been made to bring that about? Owners have been working
in conjunction, and placing a reserve on the shell, based on the cost of production.
3746. Have you been able to get that reserve ? Yes, in some instances. At the present time we have
a large quantity of shell unsold in London, which is carried forward from sale to sale, with a reserve on it.
3747. By Mr. Bennett: That entails extra cost? Certainly, storage, insurance, and interest.
3748. By Mr. Douglas: Do the West Australian and Aroe Island shelters come under that arrangement?
Yes.
3749. Do you know what percentage of the shell is made into buttons ? Ido not know, but lam told
it is very considerable.
3750. Have you any idea of the percentage ? From what I have heard, I should say 75 per cent.
3751. Do you think a scheme to establish a small button plant in Australia, to be subsidised by the
Government, would be an assistance to the industry ? I should very much like to see it. I think it
would assist producers. This being a warm climate, and summer clothing much worn, large quantities of
pearl buttons are worn.
3752. With the saving in the cost of handling charges to London and all the distribution charges, the
shell should be worked up here as cheaply as elsewhere, allowing that labour here is dearer, perhaps,
than in other places —Do you think it could be put on the market and sold to people who use buttons at
about the same price as at present ? At approximately the same price; but the trouble I see is that
fashions in buttons change.
3753. By Mr. Bennett: Would there be any chance of establishing an export trade from Australia to
the other markets of the world? The button trade is very firmly held in America and Europe; but I
have not given the matter much consideration.
3754. Comparing the population of Australia with that of the rest of the world where pearl-shell is used,
do you think a factory or factories in Australia, without an export trade, would have any chance of
being a mercantile success ? An export trade would be necessary. As to whether it could be success-
fully established I could not say.
3755. You hold that an export trade would be necessary ? Certainly. We could not consume anything
like our production.
3756. By Mr. Douglas: You said that you had not made any experiments in cultivation; but have you
observed the growth of the shell at all ? 1 have formed an opinion.
3757. What is your opinion as to the time it takes shell to grow from the time the spat settles until it
becomes a good marketable shell—what is called “ bold” shell ? At least six or seven years.
3758. Does it grow rapidly up to 2or 3 inches ? I think its growth in its initial stages is more rapid
than in the later stages. .
3759. Is there any means of telling from the back of the shell, for instance, how it grows ? I look at the
rings on the back'of a shell, count them, divide by thirteen, and arrive approximately at the age of the
shell. Where I note that the rings on the back are wide apart, that shell has grown rapidly ; where
they are very close together, the shell has grown slowly. It is just a matter of judgment.
3760. By Mr. Bennett: You go on the same principle as in regard to the rings on the horns of a bullock
or a cow? Yes. A 5-inch shell, on the average, will take from three to four years to reach that size.
3761. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea as to the period of the year when the shell throws off spat ?
I think it is during the fine weather months at the end of the year.
3762. Do you think it spats more than once in a year ? I have no idea.
3763. By Mr. Bennett: That is from September on ? From September on to Christmas.
3764. By Mr Douglas: I think it was Mr. Face who laid it down that it spats twice in the year? That
could be proved by observation.
3765. -Do you remember Mr. Face ? I met him when he was here.
3766. Did you see any of the results of his investigations ? Idp pot know of any of his results,


K. O.
Mackenzie.
13 June, 1908.
37G7. Did you see his report on the industry ? I read it some time ago.
3768. By Mr. Bennett : What opinion did you form upon that report ? Ido not remember the details;
but I remember he complained of his inability to extend his operations, and to get better information.
He was too curtailed in his experiments.
3769. By Mr. Douglas : During the time you have been engaged in the industry, you have been over all
the grounds from Princess Charlotte Bay and Cooktown northward ? I have watched the fleets working
off Cooktown, Barrow Point, and Princess Charlotte Bay; but I was not then a sheller. But I have
been over the grounds from Cape Greenville northwards all over the Strait.
3770. Have you any knowledge of the New Guinea coast ? I touched on the New Guinea coast, on the
west side of Torres Strait, from Deliverance Island toßoigu.
3771. Do you know anything of the approaches to the Bensbach River ? I have never been in there.
I have only been within 8 or 10 miles in a collecting boat.
3772. By Mr. Bennett ■ Did you make any notes ? No.
3773. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you think it would be possible for foreigners to work the Old Ground from
a base in Dutch New Guinea? IS’o doubt it could be done, but I doubt whether it would be payable.
3774. Would it be difficult to get on to the Old Ground from a place like that—Would the weather
conditions be favourable for a small boat ? It could be done, but I should not care to do it.
3775. By Mr. Bennett : You are a practical seaman —Would you care to have to run down to Merauke
or the Bensbach River, if you had to clear out from.the Old Ground ? I certainly would not.
3776. If you got in there, would you care to beat out again, from what you know of the place? No.
3777. By Mr. Douglas : Where have the boats that are employed in the shelling industry mostly come
from in recent years ? Latterly they have been built principally on Thursday Island.
3778. By Japanese carpenters ? Yes.
3779. They employ all Japanese artisans ? Yes.
3780. Do you know what they pay those men ? I have been told by tho slip proprietors that the pay
ranges, according to the men’s ability, from £5 to £7 a month and their keep.
3781. By Mr. Bennett-. Not a daily rate ? They base their wages at so much a month, but pay so much
a day ; and if a man is off a day a deduction is made.
3782. By Mr. Douglas-. Are any of the boats built on spec, by the boatbuilders? Latterly boats have
been built on spec.
3783. The boatbuilder depends on selling them to some person who can get a license ? Yes.
3784. In the event of his not being able to find a buyer, how does ho manage —Have there been any such
Cases that you know of ? Apparently in every instance the boats have found an owner.
3785. By Mr. Bennett -. A European owner ? Yes.
3786. By Mr. Douglas -. Seeing that a White Australia is the order of the day, and that it is a recognised
thing that we should endeavour to support our own artisans, is it wise to license vessels unless they
are built by European labour? If that-were done at the present time, it would drive a certain
amount of trade away from Thursday Island.
3787. Would it tend to diminish the number of boats which are built on spec., and thereby be some little
check on too many boats being placed in the industry ? The number of boats built on spec, has not been
great; and those that have been built on spec, have mainly gone into the beche-de-mer industry, and I
am not interested in that.
3788. Some small cutters that have been built on spec, are, perhaps, sold to aboriginals through the
Government or through the Papuan Industries and other companies, and may be working in the Strait at
swimming diving ? Ido not know of a cutter being built on spec.
3789. Have you any idea what it would cost to establish a cultivation station under the control of a
scientific director ? I have no idea, because Ido not know what a scientific man would require.
3790. Bearing in mind the value of the industry to Queensland, and the large amount of revenue the
Government derive from it, do you think the Government would be justified in spending £l,OOO a year
for ten years on such a scheme ? Yes.
3791. Even though there might not be much result from the expenditure ? Yes.
3792. It would be a benefit to everybody engaged in the industry ? Without a doubt.
3793. It is hardly likely that a private individual would do anything of that nature? No. A private
individual would not go in for scientific research, because he would have to bear the whole of the expense,
and those who eat back would gain from his experience.
3794. By Mr. Bennett : Are there many old vessels in the pearling industry which must necessarily be
replaced by new ones in a short time ? There are a few old vessels, but I could not say how many.
3795. Not a great many ? No; because the boats have been substantially repaired.
3796. You have heard a great deal of the traditions of the industry, I suppose ? Yes.
3797. Do you remember hearing of any instance in which employers were hampered by a preponderance
of divers of an alien race other than Japanese in the olden days? Ido not recollect ever hearing that
there was a preponderance of any particular race. There, has never been a preponderance of good
divers.
3798. Before the Japanese began to be regularly employed as divers—that is, before they became the
favourite divers ? There were always other divers available, but first-class divers have never pre-
ponderated.
3799. You have never heard of other divers having a preponderating power in the industry such as the
Japanese now possess? I have heard of South Sea Islanders, then Malays, then Manilamen, then the
Japanese. As the work became harder, and we had to go further afield, the Japanese came into
prominence.
3800. Then, as a matter of fact, it has been found that a preponderance of one race of divers has been
prejudicial to the employers, inasmuch as it placed them more or less in the hands of those men ? The
preponderance of any one nationality is certainly to the disadvantage of employers.

Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman) \ ’ Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mb. G. H. BENNETT.
Wii.liam Madison Haynk, Pearl-sheller, examined:
3801. By the Chairman : What are you ? A pearl-sheller.
3802. How long have you been at Thursday Island? Since the year 1898, with an absence of nine
months at Aroe Islands.
3803. Have you been engaged in the pearl-shell industry all that time ? No; I was in a mercantile house,
on the Island for two years.
3804. How many years have you been engaged in the pearl-shell industry ? Thirteen years.
3805. As an employer or as an owner of boats? As a partner. I have not been a direct personal owner.
3806. But you have employed labour in the industry ? Yes.
3807. Were you managing the business? At times I was managing one schooner, the “ Sketty Belle.”
3808. How many vessels do your firm own ? Fourteen.
3809. Pump vessels ? All pump vessels.
3810. Are they registered here or in Southern ports ? 1 think they are all registered in Townsville.
3811. By Mr. Bennett-. Were they built here ? They were all built here, and we had to register them
in Townsville.
3812. By the Chairman : Have they been working continuously ? Yes.
3813. Can you tell us if they have been worked with any regard for the preservation of the industry, or
have they been worked merely with a view to scoop up as much shell as possible without any considera-
tion for the future of the industry ? They have been worked to get as much shell as they could.
3814. How many boats altogether are now engaged in the industry at Thursday Island ? lam not quite
sure, but I think the number is about 108 pump boats.
3815. What is the present condition of the pearling-grounds —ls the shell becoming scarce, or is the
supply maintained ? I think it has become more prolific during the past two years, but at present the
results of the fishing do not show’ that, owing to the bad weather we have had this year.
3816. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now engaged in the
industry profitably employed ? • Yes.
3817. Without further depletion of the beds ? I think so.
3818. Do you think the number of vessels licensed for employment should be limited ? If it could be
arranged, 1 think it would be a good idea, having in view the preservation of the beds.
3819. To what number should they be limited ? I think if they were limited to not more than 150 the
beds would not be depleted to any great extent.
3820. By Mr. Bennett : There would be a certain amount of depletion even then ? On certain grounds’
If they all fished on one ground for any length of time, I think there would be a little depletion.
3821. Do you think the industry could afford 150 boats remunerative employment ? Yes.
3822. By the Chairman : On what basis would you suggest that licenses should be issued so that no
person shall be unduly favoured, and so that no monopoly shall be created—Should one man be allowed
to have thirty or forty licenses while another has only four or five—What number of licenses do you
think one person should be allowed to hold ? That is a question I have not gone into, and I do not
think I could answer it straight off.
3823. By Mr. Bennett: Have you ever given it any consideration ? Yes, I have ; but it is a difficult
question.
3824. By the Chairman : Do you approve of the closure of certain areas of the pearling grounds ? Yes.
If the proper grounds were closed, I think it would be a good thing for the remaining grounds.
3825. By increasing the supply of pearl-shell ? Yes; the spat would be deposited on and fertilise the
grounds which are kept open.
3826. Which beds do you consider should be closed ? The beds round Darnley. That is the place
where the shell is most prolific, and the set of the current there is from east to west for niue months of
the year, and that would deposit the spat on the Old Ground.
3827. For what period do you suggest a bed should bo closed ? For two or three years.
3828. By Mr. Bennett: Is it really necessary that the Darnley beds should bo open at all? No; Ido
not think so. I might add that diving there is a source of danger to the men engaged in it, and the shell
they get is not of a good quality. lam confident that the spat from Darnley Island beds fertilises the
western grounds; the spat is distributed west over the grounds which are the most profitable.
3829. By Mr. Douglas : Have you any idea when the shell spats ? I have heard that it is in April and
October but I could not say of my own knowledge. Mr. Pane is my authority for that statement.
3830. By the Chairman : Do you consider that the closure of special areas for the capture of spat would
assist in restoring the productiveness of the pearling beds ? I do. ■
3831. By Mr. Bennett: Are there any other areas nearer home which you would suggest for closure?
Yea areas south of Mount Adolphus. The same argument would apply to the closure of those areas—the
south-east winds and prevailing tides would spread the spat over the western grounds.
3832. The area you refer to now would include Adolphus Channel ? I do not think I would close that.
It is only a small area, while the other is a big area, and contains plenty of shell.
3833. Which area do you mean—along the inner route ? The inner route.
3834. Southward to where ? Southward to Bird Island. .
3835. By Mr. Douglas: Would you close Endeavour Strait ? No; because in very bad weather, such as we
have had lately, Endeavour Strait is one of the very few places where men can work.
3836. Spat is not deposited there ? No ; or very little. . .
3837. By the Chairman: What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? Five
inches
3838. Do you think any restriction should be placed on the size of vessels employed in the industry ? I
think it should be limited to 25 tons.

W.M.Hayne.
15 June, 1908.
• 3839. "What is your opinion of the floating-station system ? Prom my experience, it is commercially the
best means of working the industry at a profit; but otherwise, no doubt, it leads to the denudation of
• the beds.
3840. Do you think the present pump boats afford the necessary accommodation for the safety and
comfort of the diver and crew ? We have two sizes here—those which are measured here, and those
which are measured in Sydney. A boat in Sydney will measure 10 tons, and if she is measured here she
will measure 15 tons. I should say that boats of 15 to 17 tons, Thursday Island measurement, afford all
the comfort that is required.
3841. Are you familiar with the Board of Trade regulation as to tonnage ? Not as to the measurement.
3842. By Mr. Douglas: You were connected with the Clark combination when they left for the Aroe
Islands ? Yes.
3843. They were working the Old Ground continuously up to the time of leaving ? Yes.
3844. The whole system of working then was the floating-station one? Yes.
3845. Since their departure the shore system has been adopted ? It has been all shore work.
3846. "Were the conditions for working the industry unfavourable when the Clark combination found it
necessary to leave ? The principal factors that led to their leaving were that they could not lift sufficient
quantities of shell to make it profitable, and that they had prospects at the Aroe Islands of going into a
much more profitable business.
3847. Did you find that the restrictions on the introduction of labour at that time were very severe ?
They were no doubt severe until the change was effected. We felt it at the start, but at present we do
not feel it because the thing is now in train.
3848. By Mr. Bennett: You mean that you felt it severely because you were not used to the system P
We found it difficult to get on ; but, after the thing had been worked out and studied, we were able to
get on with the present restrictions.
3849. By Mr. Douglas : The Commonwealth Government were always willing to allow the introduction
of any number of men under their conditions, if it was shown that the labour was required ? Yes.
3850. By the Chairman : Was want of labour one of the reasons for the Clark syndicate leaving ? Ido
not think it was.
3851. By Mr. Douglas-. The price of shell had fallen considerably at that time? Yes; but it was not
much lower than it is at present.
3852. By the Chairman : Have you engaged in any experiments with a view to the propagation of the
pearl-oyster by cultivation ? No; I have no knowledge of that.
3853. Have you any knowledge of any experiments of that kind having been made by other persons ?
No.
3854. By Mr. Bennett: What are your reasons for supporting the 5-inch limit as against the previous
6-inch limit ? Because I do not think that the other inch has done any harm to the young shell.
Picking up the 5-inch shell has not in any way destroyed the fecundity of the beds; and, if you reverted
to the 6-inch limit, I am afraid that the destruction of shell between 5 inches and 6 inches would be as
great as the amount of such shell that is now exported.
3855. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that divers would wilfully take up 5-ineh shell for the sake of
pearls? Yes. They did so when the limit was 6 inches. When we were in the schooners the divers
used to bring in large quantities of dead shell between 5 and 6 inches, which indicated clearly to us that
they picked up that shell, and opened it to look for pearls, which destroyed the fish, and then threw it
overboard, because they were not allowed to bring it to the schooners.
3856. Do you think that the divers did that, irrespective of nationality ? Yes.
3857. Prior to the departure of the Clark fleets for the Aroe Islands, shore boats were giving their
divers £7O to £BO a ton for shell—did that give the shore people an advantage over those working with
schooners, who were only paying their divers £25 a ton ? I think it did, and that it also led to illicit
dealing in shell. Por instance, if a schooner diver had a bad catch, and there was a Thursday Island
boat about, he could pass some of his catch over to the shore boat, and get £7O a ton for it from the
shore boat diver, who would then sell the shell to his employer, both divers making a profit out of the
transaction.
3858. Do you think that the Japanese divers were in the habit of doing that ? I do.
3859. The system you are at present working on is to pay the divers £B7 10s. a ton? Yes; for over a
4-ton catch.
3860. Can you give us any idea as to the annual earnings of the divers ? Yes. I have made out a return
showing the cost of working one shelling boat under both the present or shore system and under the
wages or schooner system.
3861. That will be useful to us ? The cost of working one boat on the present or the shore system is as
follows:

W. M, Hayne,
15 June, 1908.
No London Expenses shown—presuming the price realised is £l3O net, f.0.b., Thursday Island.
3862. They are both based on a 4|-ton basis ? Yes.
3863. What proportion of the £371 17s. 6d. under the present system would the diver get ? I assume
that he would get between £SOand £lOO out of it. That does not include anything for pearls, but only
for shell. That would be the net amount to the diver.
3864. Of course, the pearls are an unknown quantity ? Yes.
3865. Do you know of any instances where they have got any large pearls ? Yes.
3866. What would be the average annual value of pearls for a boat in your fleet of fourteen boats ? I
have no idea. I know one man in our fleet who got, in three months, £l5O worth of pearls, and Ido
not know any other diver in the fleet who got £5O worth in twelve months.
3867. Is it more profitable to work on the floating-station system, if everybody adopts that system ?
Yes, for the reason that the men are under control, and can be forced to work at every favourable
opportunity. They are not their own masters under that system to the same extent as they are now.
3868. By Mr. Bennett: And the owner gets all the pearls ? Yes, or as many as he can secure.
3869. By Mr. Douglas-. Then, in saying that the floating-station system became unprofitable owing to
shell becoming scarcer, we may conclude that the boats could not be kept together so much—They would
have to go further from the schooners, and in different directions ? Yes. That was one of the faults we
found with the system the year before we went away.
3870. Then you think the beds had been over-fished ? lam strongly of that opinion.
3871. Opinion on that point is not unanimous—You think they were over-fished? lam positive of it,
from my own personal and practical experience.
3872. You had been working the floating-station system from 1895 ? Yes.
3873. And you noticed a steady decline in the catch of shell right through ? Yes.
3874. By Mr. Bennett : Was it not in 1896 that the size limit was altered from 6 inches to 5 inches? I
think it was.
3875. By Mr Douglas : Do you think the inshore beds around Thursday Island, between here and the
mainland, have in any way restocked themselves since the industry was started —Have the boats worked
these inshore beds much since you have been directly engaged in the industry ? They have been worked
in off seasons when the boats could not work anywhere else. That is why I am opposed to closing
Endeavour Strait. That is where the boats go in weather like this.
3876. The Old Ground is the main stand-by, though ? Yes.
3877. Have you been down the east coast to Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay ? Yes.
3878. Those beds have not been worked continuously ? The Princess Charlotte Bay beds have not been
worked since 1899, the year of the hurricane.
3879. Large quantities of shell were obtained there that year ? Yes.
3880. By Mr Bennett-. Was it not of inferior quality? Very inferior.
3881. Had it not rather a bad effect on the industry as a whole ? Yes. It shut up a lot of the small
men who were down there —they got such a low price for it.
3882. The shell was chalky ? Chalky and flaky —soft backs. You could pull it off with your thumb
nail.
3883. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think it wise to provide by regulation that no vessels of over, 25 tons
should be licensed ? Yes.
3884. And by that means block the working from large floating stations ? Yes.
3885. You think that would be a means of assisting to preserve the industry ? I do.
3886. By Mr. Bennett : Briefly, you hold that the shore system is more conducive to the preservation of
the industry than the floating-station system ? Yes; and it also conduces to people who are engaged in
the industry making a fair but not a large profit.
3887. By the Chairman : What nationality are the majority of the divers at present engaged in diving ?
They are mostly Japanese.
3888. Do you think that a desirable state of affairs ? It would be better if they were of mixed nationalities;
but we do not seem to be able to get them.
3889. By Mr. Bennett: Has that been tried? Yes. We have tried to get Manila men, but we cannot
3890 & By the Chairman : Would it not be better if they were of mixed nationalities ? Yes, if they would
work as well as the Japanese, and if they couldget the shell. T ,
3891. Have you had any experience of white divers ? Only when 1 was in the mercantile house 1 spoke
of on the Island. They had seven or eight boats that were worked entirely by white divers.
3892. With what result? The result was that they lost every one of their boats while I was there,


W.M.Hayne.,
15 June, 1908.,
5 ‘3893. ■ Lost their boats ? Tes ; they could not work profitably, and they got into debt, and their boats
' were eventually taken from them as security for that debt.
3- 3894. By Mr. Douglas-. The price o£ shellwas very low then, was it not? From £lOO to £ll5 a ton.
3895. Were there any other reasons for their want of success, such as the intemperate habits of the men
employed, or anything of that kind ? Some of them were intemperate, and when they were lucky and
got money they spent it freely.
3896. The figures in that report —[ Government Resident's Annual Report handed to Witness ] —are
official —Do you see the price given there for shell in 1894 ? Tes, the price given is £79 a ton. I
thought it was more than that.
3897. At that time the men worked the boats on their own account, and were not merely employees ?
No ; they were virtually their own masters.
3898. Was their shell sent to London on consignment ? Yes.
3899. And the firm charged them a commission for selling the shell ? The firm charged them a commis-
sion for handling the shell and selling it in London, and the men were handed the account sales and paid
the full market price.
3900. By Mr. Bennett-. The men had to purchase their supplies from those mercantile houses, had they
not? Tes.
3901. By Mr. Douglas-. W hat class of boats were used ? The boats were not as good a class right through
as we have at the present time.
3902. Were they boats of mature age which were expensive to maintain? No. Some of them
were new boats.
3903. And the men had every opportunity of testing the question as to whether they could work
profitably ? Tes, and some of them worked very well, and tried hard to obtain a living out of it, but they
could not do so, and they had to give it up.
3904. By the Chairman : Is it your opinion, then, that the industry cannot be carried on with white
labour? Unless it is assisted by the Government —that is my opinion.
3905. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think the industry could be carried on with white divers and white
tenders and coloured crews? Working for a boat-owner the same as the Japanese under present
conditions?
3906. Tes ? No. Ido not think white divers could carry on the industry.
3907. By the Chairman -. What about white divers carrying on the industry with their own boats? Ido
not think they could do it, because the profit is not there. They would earn £l2O a year at the outside,
and I do not think a white man would take up diving at that remuneration.
3908. Assuming that the conditions were made more favourable by amended legislation and otherwise, do
you think white men would then engage in the industry? If it could be made more profitable to the
white diver, I think he would engage in the industry.
3909. By Mr. Bennett: By means of a bonus ? By any means.
3910. By the Chairman -. Can you suggest any means ? The only means I can suggest is a bonus for
shell raised by a white diver.
3911. What bonus do you suggest ? Ido not think anything under £25 a ton would be any inducement.
3912. Do you think a bonus of that amount would be an inducement to a white diver to engage in the
industry? I think it would induce a few white divers to engage in it, and, if they found the work
profitable, others would no doubt follow; but even then Ido not think there would be any great influx of
white divers.
' 3913. Do you think the establishment of a school for the training of white divers would be fraught with
any success ? I think it would be a splendid scheme for teaching young, growing white men.
3914. If we had amended legislation and a bonus, you think white men could carry on the industry?
Tes, if there was also a school at which white men could be taught diving.
3915. Do you think any other steps are necessary to make the industry a success with white divers —Do
you think the services of a marine biologist would assist in that direction ? Tes ; I think the more we
know about the industry seientificially the better for all concerned.
3916. You think the securing of the services of a marine biologist and the founding of a training school
for divers would be conducive to the success of the industry with white men ? I think so.
3917. By Mr. Bennett -. What about the chance of getting pearls —Do you think that is a factor in the
inducements to white men ? No. The chance is so uncertain that a man could not rely on it.
3918. He could not take that into his calculations ? No. We kept records of the boats that got pearls
when I was on a floating station. The diver on a boat might have been changed half a dozen times, and
yet that one boat has appeared to get all the pearls, while another boat would get nothing. It is purely
a gamble.
3919. By Mr. Douglas : Do you remember the experiment made by the Pilot Cultivation Company ?
Tes.
3920. Were you a member of that company ? No. I had nothing to do with it.
3921. Did you see Mr. Pace’s report on that experiment ? No. I was quite unaware that any report
was issued.
3922. He issued a report after he severed his connection with the company ? I was not aware of that.
3923. By the Chairman -. Do you consider the present system of basing the amount of license fee on
the tonnage of a vessel satisfactory? Not at all. I strongly recommend that that provision in the
Act be altered, and that there be a uniform license fee for every boat using a pump, regardless of its
tonnage.
3924. What is your opinion of the license fee payable by divers and persons in charge—do you think that
satisfactory ? Ido not consider the amount is at all excessive.
3925. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think a diver or a man in charge should hold a certificate of competency
—Do you think it necessary that he should undergo some sort of examination to show that he possesses
the necessary qualification ? At present there is no provision made for passing such an examination —no
means of passing an examination.
3926. By Mr. Bennett : But that would be a natural corollary of the training-school system, would it
not ? If a school were established, I would be in favour of it.
3927. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think a diver should pass a medical examination ? Not necessarily.


3928. By the Chairman : Having regard to the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act, would it 1
not be to the interest of the employer that a man employed as a diver should produce a certificate of ,
fitness —If a white man came to you and offered his services as a diver you would naturally expect that 1
he was a healthy man; if he was suffering from any organic disease you would not take him, would you ?
N°. , _
3929. Would it not he a protection to you as an employer if ho underwent a medical examination to prove
that he was physically sound ? Yes, it would he for the benefit of the employer. But at present we
know that our divers are healthy, because we make inquiries about them.
3930. That is so, no doubt—They have been here for some time ; but supposing a stranger offered his
services? It would be beneficial to an employer in such a case if the diver could produce a certificate.
3931. Should a vessel be allowed to carry more than one diver? No.
3932. In the event of an accident, what would you do ? A boat should be allowed to carry what they call
a spare diver.
3933. Then you think that more than one diver should be carried ? Yes; a spare diver, who would
work as a member of the crew. But Ido not think it is a good thing to allow three divers, or four divers,
to go out in one boat, and all work as divers and not as crew. We have a spare diver in the boats at
present.
3934. By Mr. Douglas ; Take the case of your own fleet of fourteen vessels —If white divers were
forthcoming, and were willing and able to undertake the work, you could not employ them unless you
got a fair price for your shell in London ? That is so.
3935. If you got £2OO a ton for your shell, you could probably afford to pay all your divers £5O a ton ?
If they got equal quantities of shell; but you could not expect a new white diver to get the same
quantity of shell as an experienced diver. It would depend on the quantity of shell procured and the
price obtained.
3930. By Mr. Bennett : You mean that if a man got a certain quantity of shell, you could afford to pay
him a higher price ? Yes.
3937. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think the Government could assist the owners of vessels to employ
suitable white divers ? I think they could by offering them a bonus. ,
3938. Should the amount of the bonus be payable on the price you get for shell in London ? No ; the
amount of the bonus should have nothing to do with the price of shell, because when shell is obtained it
is six months before you know what return you get for that shell. In some cases it is eight or nine
months. At present we have shell in London which has been unsold since July last year.
3939. Then you suggest that the bonus should be on the basis of the amount of shell obtained by the
diver ? Yes.
3940. What amount of bonus do you think it would be desirable to offer ? As I said before, nothing
under £25 a ton for a start. The amount could be reduced afterwards.
3941. You think that if a start was made in the direction of establishing a training school for divers, and
a bonus was paid on shell raised by white divers, it would be possible for white men to go into the
industry ? Yes; I think so.
3942. By Mr. Bennett : And that it would result in the industry being run under white diver conditions ?
It might gradually produce that effect.
3943. By Mr. Douglas : And the boats might increase their catches year after year ? Ido not think the
catches would increase, but they might be maintained.
3944. As soon as Clark’s fleet went to the Aroe Islands the catch per boat increased ? Yes.
3945. Was that due to the weather ? Not altogether. Speaking generally, I should say it was due to
the fact that fewer boats were engaged in the fishery, and they had a chance of getting more shell. '
3946. Prom that statement we may infer that the average on the Old Ground would be higher, owing to
the fact that there were fewer boats working than there were formerly ? No. I think we are just
about that stage when the Old Ground will about maintain its quality and quantity of shell, provided
the number of boats is not increased.
3947. By the Chairman : Under present conditions, do you think it would be wise to increase the number
of boats now engaged in the industry ? No.
3948. By Mr. Bennett : I suppose you know something of the operations in the industry before you
came here ? No ; I knew nothing about them. Do you mean before I originally came to Thursday Island ?
3949. When did you come ? In 1893.
3950. Have you ever heard which were the most prolific beds before the Old Ground was found ? No.
3951. With regard to the closure of beds, do you not think that if some of the inshore beds —1 do not
say all of them —were closed for a period and strictly conserved, it would be advantageous to the
industry, even if it was only as an experiment to ascertain whether those beds would recuperate them-
selves or not ? No; Ido not consider it would be an advantage to close a small bed, because I think it
has been proved absolutely that if a bed is closed for a term of two or three years it does recuperate.
3952. You think it is not necessary to close them as an experiment ? That is my opinion.
3953. I have in my mind more particularly the channels inside islands on the eastern side of Endeavour
Strait such as Possession, Eoko, High, and Dayman Islands —you do not think it would be any advantage
to close those beds for the purpose of obtaining information ? No ; Ido not think so. I think nearly
all practical shellers understand that if a bed is left strictly alone for three years it recuperates.
3954. Would some recuperate more quickly than others —Beds that have a swift current running through
them would not recuperate so quickly? I should not think so ; but that is a scientific aspect of the
question on which I should not like to express an opinion. 1 think the most recuperative beds are a
part of the Old Ground. Prom my own experience I can say that shell has grown there more quickly
when the beds were closed in Endeavour Strait ? Yes.
3956. Do you remember if the shell increased during that time? Yes; it did increase, without a doubt.
3957! Even if it had been fossicked over by individual boats ? Yes ; the increase was appreciable.
3958. By Mr. Douglas : Do you suggest the closure of Darnley and Mount Adolphus beds down to the
3959 You know'it is very difficult to get a conviction against men who may be poaching on the beds—
Do you think it would be necessary to amend the Act, rendering the person poaching liable to

W.M.Hayne.
15 June, 1908.
.imprisonment—You Itnow the owner is penalised? I would suggest that the penalty should be inflicted
on the diver. He is breaking the law, and not the owner.
.3960. By Mr. Bennett: You know the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act ? Fairly well.
3961. Is it not the person who takes the shell who is penalised ? The person who lifts it from the
bottom ?
3962. Yes—Has that not been one of the difficulties ? I think it has. ■
3963. Then how does the owner come into the matter at all ? Still it is unfair to penalise the owner.
3964. But is it the owner or the person raising the shell who is penalised under the Act? Ido not
know.
3965. By Mr. Douglas-. But if the diver in charge is fined, has not the owner to pay the fine?
Practically. The owner has to advance the money for the fine, so that it really falls on the owner.
3966. By Mr. Bennett-. Would not the owner stop the fine out of the diver’s earnings ? Yes ; but he
may not earn any more, and the owner goes down.
3967. By the Chairman : I suppose the boat is held responsible ? Yes.
3968. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any knowledge as to the percentage of shell that goes to the home
market that is used for button making ? I have no knowledge ; but I know it is a great percentage.
3969. Did not the Shellers’ Association have some inquiries made into where the shell went to and what
was done with it—Did they not send a representative home to inquire? Not to my knowledge—they
may have done so.
3970. I think it was Mr. Munro who stated that about 90 per cent, of the shell was made into buttons ?
Ido not know about that. I know it is a very large quantity, from conversations I have had with Mr.
Lawless. He is the only manufacturer I have ever spoken to.
3971. Do you think some effort might be made to establish a button factory in Australia with Government
assistance ? I think it could be done, if the Government wore prepared to lose enough on it for a start.
3972. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you consider it would involve a loss at first? I have not gone into the
matter, so I could not say that with any certainty.
3973. By Mr. Douglas -. Do you think it is a subject that the Shellers’ Association might discuss with
the view of putting a proposition before the Government? I think they might discuss it and obtain
inforlnation about it.
3974. By Mr. Bennett-. Would it not be a good thing from the shellers’ own point of view as a means of
self-help to bring it under the notice of the State or the Commonwealth Government—the Common-
wealth Government if there was any suggestion that there should be a bonus on export or production ?
Probably it would be a matter well worth going into,
3975. By Mr. Douglas: We were informed the other day that on the Continent families of poor people,
after they had finished work during the day, turned out buttons in the rough with small machines in their
own homes, and sent them to the manufacturer to be finished off—ln the event of its being demonstrated
that shell can be cultivated, and families are settled on the different islands, might they not turn out
buttons in the same way while their shell was growing, and the Government might assist them by erecting
a plant to finish the buttons ? Yes ; I think that is a thing for the future.
3976. Of course the Government get a large revenue out of the industry ? Yes.
3977. Would they not be justified in spending a little money in assisting the people engaged in the
industry? Certainly. The industry has never been assisted in any way by the Government.
3978. By the Chairman : Would it be more convenient to have licenses for boats issued by the Inspector
of Pearl-shell Fisheries instead of by the Sub-Collector of Customs ? I think it would be an advantage.
3979. By Mr. Douglas : Are you a licensed dealer in pearls ? Not this year. I was up to this year ;
but things were so bad in pearls this year that I did not take out a license.
3980. Those licenses are issued by the Police Magistrate ? Yes.
3981. Do you think it would be better that all licenses under the Act should be issued from the one
office? Yes.
3082. Do you think that there should be a residential qualification in connection with licenses for pearl
dealers ? lam strongly of that opinion. Last year there were at least three men, two of whom were
foreigners, who were here for two months or six weeks only. One man bought £3,000 or £4,000 worth
of pearls.. If he makes a profit on those pearls, he pays no income tax. If we buy the same quantity,
and make a profit of £5OO, we have to pay income tax on that £5OO.
3983. By the Chairman : What change would you suggest ? I would suggest having a residential
clause preventing any license being granted unless the applicant has resided on Thursday Island for at
least twelve months.
3984. By Mr. Douglas: A resident of Queensland or of Thursday Island ? Possibly of Queensland,
though 1 should say Thursday Island.
3985. By Mr. Bennett: What has led to the present monopoly of diving by the Japanese ? The only
answer I cau give is that it is a case of the survival of the fittest.
3986. Has that monopoly had a bad effect on the interests of the owners ? I think that the placing of
any industry in the hands of one set of men is not altogether good ; but I would not say that it has had
an absolutely bad effect on the industry. It simply gives the divers a stronger voice in arguing with the
owners.
3987. Have you any idea of the average working life of divers ? I can only answer that by thinking of
the men who have passed through my hands. My opinion is that no man is a first-class diver after six or
seven years. The strain of the life is too great. His physical energy will not stand it after that time.
3988. In consequence of certain ailments that are contracted ? - That is so. I find that a man after
seven years has used up his energy, and is not fit for diving any longer.
3989. By Mr. Douglas : Does that apply to the Japanese divers too ? Yes.
3990. Of course there are exceptional cases where a man may dive for years after that time ? Yes.
3991. Has the scarcity of shell, which has necessitated going into deeper waters, been the cause to some
extent of the divers giving out ? That would reduce a diver’s term. A man who has to go into deep
water will not last, on the average, six years. Ido not suppose he would last more than four years if he
was continually diving in deep water.
3992. By Mr. Bennett: Given an accident, he might not last a minute ? That is so.
3993. Then, on the whole, you think the present conditions are not favourable to the introduction of
white labour into the industry ? Not at present. I do not think this would be a favourable time to


introduce white labour. If white divers were forced on us under present conditions, the industry would V
be paralysed. If they were brought in gradually, and assisted, it would bo a different matter. f
3994. Would white divers require white tenders ? No. I have known white divers work with Malay H
and Manila tenders, and some with Japanese tenders.
3995. Would it be possible to work the industry with white divers, white tenders, and white crews ? No.
3996. Not under any conditions ? Not under any conditions.
3997. Why not? A white crew would not go out for the wages we are paying, and if we paid wages
which would induce white crews to go out, we would become insolvent in one month.
3998. AVhat wages would you have to pay white tenders ? Ido not think you would get any white man
to take the job of tender for less than £9 a month.
3999. What are the present wages paid ? £4 a month.
4000. What wages do you consider would be necessary to get white crews ? I understand the wages paid
on the coast are about £6 a month. Ido not think you would get a white crew to go into a pearling-
boat for £6 a month ; they certainly would not stick at it at that rate. There is nothing to induce
them to stay. The life is harder than in a steamer.
4001. You do not consider that the closure of beds is necessary, or that it would have a beneficial effect ?
No. Ido not consider that the closing of the small beds near shore would be of any great service.
4002. Before cultivation can be gone into, you consider that the services of a biologist are necessary ?
Undoubtedly.
4003. By Mr. Douglas-. Is there anything else you would like to touch upon ? I should like to suggest
one thing. There is a section in the Act providing that wages must be paid in current coin of the realm
every six months. To my knowledge, that is a dead letter. It was only enforced in the year it was
passed. I would recommend the repeal of that provision, because it is not to the interest of any of the
owners to keep the wages for even six months. At present we pay every man every three months, and it
is no trouble at all to us.
4004. By Mr. Bennett : What was the result in the year in which it was enforced ? A great deal of
worry to the Shipping Office and to ourselves.
4005. By Mr. Douglas : Is the slop-chest system in force here now ? No; it has been done away with
altogether.
4006. The stoppage of the schooner system has practically done away with it? Yes.
4007. Where do the coloured people buy their stores ? We supply them with all their provisions, and
they make their personal purchases wherever they like. We supply the provisions on a fixed scale.
4008. By Mr. Bennett-. You know that there are several Pearl-shell and Bocho-de-Mer Fishery Acts in
existence? Yes.
4009. Would it be advantageous to have those Acts consolidated and amended ? Yes; I think it would
be a good thing. Another matter I should like to mention is that under the present Act the inspector
has power to remove summarily any diver or tender from a boat. I would recommend the repeal of that
provision, as it is rather too drastic.
4010. By the Chairman: Is that for any crime committed by the diver or tender? I could not say, as I
have not made a note of the whole section.
4011. By Mr. Bennett: You refer to section 10, 55 Yic. No. 29, do you not? Yes. It says
If any person appears to an inspector to have committed a contravention of any of the provisions of
the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Acts, the inspector may, without summons, warrant,
or other process, take the offender, and if necessary the ship or boat to which he belongs, and
the crew before a police magistrate, &c.
I consider that provision is altogether too drastic. It was carried out once by an inspector, lie took
about thirty-six divers and tenders out of boats in very bad weather, and left the boats with raw crews
in them.
4012. By the Chairman : Who was that ? Inspector Urquhart. He is now in the Criminal Investigation
Branch of the Police Department.
4018. That happened a long time ago ? Yes ; but it was done.
4014. You consider that power too drastic ? Too drastic altogether. Ido not think any man should
have that power.
4015. You think that provision should be amended? I think it should be eliminated.
4016. Anything else? I should like to say something with regard to pearl-dealers’ licenses. The present
Act provides that licenses shall be issued to anybody who produces a certificate of good character and
good standing; but Ido not think that condition has been observed.
4017. By Mr. Douglas : Would you restrict the issue of pearl-dealers’ licenses to Europeans only ?
Europeans only.
4018. Or naturalised British subjects ? Yes.
4019. By Mr. Bennett : By naturalised British subjects, do you mean white persons ? A coloured man
can take out naturalisation papers.
4020. I know; but would you proscribe coloured men, and allow only white British subjects to take out
licenses ? No. I would say that the provision with regard to a person being of good character and
standing should be enforced, and to that provision I would add a clause stating that a licensed dealer
must be a European or a naturalised British subject.
Ernest Julian Hennessey, Commission Agent, examined :
4021. By the Chairman : What are you ? A commission agent.
4022. How long have you been on Thursday Island ? About ten years.
4023. Have you had auy experience in the pearl-shell industry ? A slight experience, inasmuch as I was f
twelve months on a floating station.
4024. Are you interested in the industry at the present time i Very slightly.
4025. Do you own any vessels engaged in it ? Vessels engaged in the beche-de-mer industry, but not in
the pearl-shell industry. ,
4026. Are you aware whether the pearl-shell beds have been worked with any regard for the preservation
of the industry ? lam not.

E. J.
Hennessey.
15 June, 1908.
4027. By Mr. Douglas-. Have the shelling beds been over-fished in the past ? According to the figures
for last year it appears to me that the beds have not been over-fished. The catch of pearl-shell per boat
, was as great as, if not greater than, it was the previous year.
!. 4028. By the Chairman: Is there any cause to which you can attribute that, other than a plentiful supply
of fish—was there anything in the weather ? The weather may have been favourable last year.
4029. By Mr. Douglas-. Look at the statistics in that table —[Government Resident's Annual Report
handed to Witness ] —for a period extending over seventeen years —Do you not see that there has been a
steady falling off in the total catch, although the average per boat was increased last year ? In 1906 there
were 125 boats, and the take of shell was 444 tons. In 1907 there were 135 boats, and the take of shell
was 567 tons.
4030. And you say that the average catch per boat last year increased considerably ? Tes.
4031. How do you account for that —Was it because some boats having left the grounds, the beds had a
chance to recuperate? I think it was rather due to the fact that divers have been put on a better basis,
and they have worked harder.
4032. Knowing that, unless they obtained good catches, they would not make much out of the work ?
Yes.
4033. By Mr. Bennett: Under former conditions their earnings were dependent on their catch, were
they not ? They were paid at the rate cf £2O to £25 per ton previously.
4034. If a man got 4 tons of shell under former conditions he would earn £lOO ? Tes.
4035. If he got four tons under present conditions, would he earn £100? I think he would.
4036. Do you know that he would ? No ; lam not interested sufficiently. I have not gone into the
matter.
4037. Do you remember when Clark and Co.’s fleet left the Strait ? Tes.
4038. The state of the industry in the year prior to that was somewhat precarious ? Tes.
4039. The grounds had become partly denuded ? Tes.
4040. Do you attribute that to too many boats fishing at that time ? Tes.
4041. Do you consider floating stations a detriment to the industry ? The floating stations euable boats
to be kept together on a small area, and to pick up all the shell there.
4042. By that means the beds are closely worked ? Tes ; it seems quite possible.
4043. It is profitable to the owners to work with floating stations, but do you not think that it is better
in the interests of the industry that the boats should be worked from shore stations ? From shore
stations, certainly.
4044. Would you suggest that the number of boats licensed should be limited —Would it be desirable to
exclude the large schooners ? Tes.
4045. A suggestion has been made that the tonnage limit of boats should be 25 tons —Do you think that
is desirable ? I should say that 25-ton boats should be employed.
4046. Do you think it possible that a vessel of 25 tons could work a fleet of from four to six luggers ?
Tes ; it has been done.
4047. With such a vessel, you would not be able to work a large fleet? No.
4048. You are more directly connected with the beche-de-mer business ? Tes.
4049. You spoke of one instance in which a vessel of 25 tons had worked a fleet of four or six boats—
Was it done successfully ? Judging by what occurred, I should say it had not been successful. The
vessel was run by Captain Steve Clark. Apparently it was not a success, as he joined another fleet.
4050. By Mr. Douglas: You are connected with the beche-de-mer industry as an owner and as an agent ?
Tes.
4051. You handle a large quantity of the fish on behalf of the Protector of Aboriginals ? I do.
4052. You sell all the fish for the native boats ? Tes.
4053. Do you act as agent and sell on commission the fish got by boats now working on the Barrier
Beef? Tes.
4054. In that way you are brought into touch with the men working the outer reefs generally ? Tes.
4055. The Japanese are to a great extent in charge of the boats ? Tes; of all the larger boats fishing the
outer reefs.
4056. Do they obtain the whole of the fish and sell it at the best price they can get ? I am not
absolutely certain, as I have no boats captained by Japanese; but, so far as I know, Japanese receive the
greater portion of tho value of the fish.
4057. Do you think it is desirable that the Japanese should bo placed in such a position that they get a
large proportion of the fish ? I think it is very undesirable.
4058. Are there many Europeans engaged in fishing for beche-de-mer ? In Torres Strait there are none,
outside of Fred. Lancaster and Ned Mosby.
4059. By Mr. Bennett-. What about Walton? He is not here. He became blind, and went to Sydney.
4060. By Mr. Douglas: Do the Japanese own any boats in tho industry ? They are reputed to own
boats.
4061. Do the Chinese own any boats ? Ido not think so ; though there was Kum Hun Chong, who
was connected with it through his brother Tommy Ah Kum, of Cooktown—l think the name he is
naturalised under is Lai Fook.
4062. Lai Fook took out the licenses ? Tes.
4063. Do you know of any Japanese being prepared to work boats on a “ lay ” or any other basis—Have
you had any dealings with the Japanese yourself ? During the latter part of last year a Japanese built
a boat, and fitted her out for beche-de-mer. On the completion of the vessel he found that he was about
£l5O short.
4064. Had ho licensed her ? Not at that time. Ido not suppose ho has now. Ho went round the
town and attempted to borrow £150; and he also came to me. His offer was that, if I would lend
him £l5O, he would repay me at the end of twelve months, and that, in the meantime, he would give me
the vessel as security.
4065. By Mr. Bennett-. He would practically have sold tho boat to you for £150? Tes. At the end
of the twelve months he was to repay me my £l5O, together with another £l5O as interest, and he would
guarantee me £5O a year to work tho vessel —that is really to hold the license, which I refused to do.
4066. By Mr. Douglas: That would be a system of dummying ?Tes.
4067. \Vhat would be the value of the boat? It was probably worth £450.


4068. He practically proposed to sell the vessel to you for £l5O ? Yes.
40G9. You would then have been the absolute owner of the boat, and have obtained the license ? That
was the intention.
4070. Still there would have been a moral obligation on your part to hand him back the boat for the same 1
price that you paid ? Plus the £l5O interest which was offered by him.
4071. By Mr. Bennett-. 100 per cent. ? Yes.
4072. By Mr. Douglas : That would look as though he expected to make a fine profit ? Yes.
4073. By Mr. Bennett-. Was the vessel licensed subsequently ? I believe so.
4074. What vessel was it ? The “ Amy.” I heard afterwards that she had been taken over by the owner
ot the slip, but I do not know whether that is true or not.
4075. Is she working from Thursday Island ? She left Thursday Island two or three months ago, I
believe, for the beche-de-mer reefs.
4076. But she is working out of this port ? Yes.
4077. Under whose control ? I could not say.
4078. Is there a Japanese in charge of her ? I believe so, but Ido not know.
4079. By Mr. Douglas -. Is there much of that sort of thing going on ? I have heard of other cases, but I
have no absolute proof, and I would not care to put them before you. You were asking just now whether
the Japanese got the whole or the best part of the catch. I can give you one instance.. I sent away a
vessel in March last year, as agent, and she came back in December, having in the meantime got 14| tons
of beche-de-mer. After all debts were paid, the Japanese left with over £l,ooo clearprofitfor the nine
months ; and Thursday Island got hardly any benefit beyond what was spent in wages and stores.
4080. He employed mainland aboriginals as crew? Yes.
4081. Did he employ any other Japanese ? There were two Japanese and ten or eleven aboriginals.
4082. Was the price of beche-de-mer high at that time? I think his .average was £l3O a ton. Early in
the year he got up to £175 a ton. It went lower towards December, when it was down to £llO.
4083. His profit was enhanced by the high price of the fish? Yes.
4084. Is the price as high now ? No.
4085. What would he have obtained at present prices ? The present price for fish of the same quality
is £B5 a ton, according to the last returns I got.
4086. Then beche-de-mer fishing is rather a speculative venture ? It is.
4087. Couid Europeans work the industry with the same profitable results as that Japanese? Ido not
see any reason why they should not in a large vessel. The present price of the best quality is between
£9O and £lOO a ton.
4088. Has beche-de-mer a higher value at certain seasons of the year? I think it has a higher value
in December before the Chinese New' Year; but last year in December it was not as high as it was in
May and June.
4089. What was the price last May and June ? £l7O for the best fish.
4090. Then there has been a very serious falling off ? Yes.
4091. Is that because the supply has been greater than the demand ? I cannot get any reason. I
have spoken to the buyers here on two or three occasions, but they would not give me any information.
4092. By Mr. Bennett: Have you ever tried to get information from Hong Kong ? In the way of
shipping fish wo have, much to our loss.
4093. By Mr. Douglas -. Is the fish all sold here now ? The greater part of it is. Occasionally a few
parcels are sent way ; but the best quality is always sold here.
4094. By. Mr. Bennett -. With the present depreciation in price, the profit of that fortunate Japanese
would not exist ? Not this year.
4095. By Mr. Douglas-. Have you heard any reports as to the state of the Barrier Beef? Men in my
employ have told me that there is very little fish being got on the outer reefs from hero to Cooktowh,
and only in patches.
4096. They have been over-fished ? Yes. Further south than Cooktown I cannot say what their
condition is.
4097. Have there been too many boats engaged in the industry ? I think so.
4098. 1 low many years ago is it since the price of beche-de-mer went up ? I could not say.
4099. The demand for it increased ? Yes.
4100 Owing to the low price of pearl-shell some pearling boats were placed in the beche-de-mer industry ?
Yes.
4101. By Mr. Bennett: Was it not about 1901 that the price went up ? I really could not say. 1 have
only been interested in the industry since 1906.
4102. Do you consider the present system of basing the license fee for boats on the tonnage equitable ?
The present charges seem to me to be fair.
4103. By Mr. Douglas -. Is it desirable that coloured aliens should bo allowed to employ all the native
labour —With a view to assisting Europeans to engage in the industry, would it be wise to place a
restriction upon aliens being allowed to recruit native labour ? The vessels are owned by Europeans,
though they are not in charge. To prohibit the men in charge of the smaller vessels from obtaining
aboriginals as crews would practically ruin that part of the industry. White men would not go out in
the smaller vessels, and at present the greater number of those vessels employ aboriginals.
4104. Then you do not think it desirable to restrict the issue of permits to recruit aboriginals to
Europeans only ? Not unless a distinction is made between the boats. If you prohibited Japanese and
Chinese from employing aboriginals they would resort to New Guinea crews. I believe there are five
vessels now which are manned with New Guinea labour.
4105. By Mr. Bennett: Are they owned by Japanese? As far as I know they are owned by Europeans.
4106. Who employs the crews ? The owner.
4107. So that really the Japanese do not employ the crews? It depends on the arrangement they have
made. ,
4108. But who is responsible for the wages of the crews ? Ihe owner.
4109. Consequently he employs the crew ? Yes.
4110. By Mr. Douglas-. Is there anything you could suggest for the betterment of the beche-de-mer
industry, or to assist the owners of the smaller boats in that industry, or in the turtle-shell industry, or
generally with regard to the administration of the Act? The only suggestion lean make to preserve
the industry is to prohibit the Japanese from obtaining “ in charge ” licenses.

4111. By Mr. Bennett : Would you prohibit all coloured aliens from obtaining licenses as persons in
charge ? That would come back to the same thing—it would ruin the owners of the smaller vessels.
' 4112. With you it is merely a question of the quality of the alien? No ; it is a question of the quality
*• of fish.
4113. Not of the nationality of the alien? No. lam not prejudiced against the Japanese at all.
4114. Did you not say you would prohibit Japanese? Yes, for the simple reason that Queensland is not
gaining the benefit it should from the beche-de-mer industry.
4115. But you would not care whether other coloured aliens got licenses or not? I would care; but it
would affect the smaller vessels considerably. They would have to be laid up.
4116. Then you are anxious that other coloured aliens should get licenses? Yes, unless we could get
Europeans to go in the smaller vessels; and lam afraid that could not be done.
4117. By Mr. Douglas : What are the nationalities of the men in charge of your vessels ? Manila men.
4118. By Mr. Bennett-. Manila men, as a rule, establish homes on the islands, do they not? Some of
them establish homes on the islands in the Strait.
4119. By Mr. Douglas-. The Manila men, as a rule, go in for the smaller vessels ? Yes.
4120. The Japanese work in the larger vessels ? Yes. There is one large vessel of 44 tons.
4121. If the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act were strictly enforced, and all vessels over 15 tons
had to employ a certificated master, that would, to some extent, check the Japanese monopolising the
beche-de-mer industry ? It would for a time, but it is a question whether that would not injure the
owners of boats more than the Japanese.
4122. By Mr. Dennett: Are there many vessels under 15 tons engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ?
Yes ; a considerable number. I cannot give the exact figures. I think the majority of the Manila men
in the Strait are working smaller vessels.
4123. By Mr. Douglas -. Would you suggest that vessels of 15 tons and over engaged in the b&che-de-mer
industry should have a certificated master, or a European in charge ? A European in charge.
4124. By Mr. Bennett : Do you favour the employment of certificated masters on vessels of 15 tons and
over ? No; lam in favour of a European being in charge, but not necessarily a certificated master.
4125. By Mr. Douglas: Do you consider that a European or person in charge of a vessel of 15 tons and
over should pass an examination of some kind to show his qualification to take charge? lam afraid I
cannot suggest any qualification.
4126. By Mr. Bennett : Is it not necessary for the safety of the crew that a man navigating a vessel of
15 tons should have some knowledge of coast navigation ? Judging from the experience of the Japanese,
it appears not to be necessary. If anyone knows the reefs in Torres Strait, it is the Japanese, and the
majority of them, so far as we know, have no knowledge of navigation.
Kenneth Oed Mackenzie, Pearl-Sheller, and member of the firm of Bowden and Mackenzie, further
examined:
4127. By the Chairman : You have had considerable experience in the beche-de-mer industry? I have
never been directly interested in the industry, but I have been indirectly interested in it for a number of
years.
• 4128. You have never had any actual experience on the reefs ? No.
4129. By Mr. Douglas-. You have fished for turtle ? Yes.
4130. Eor the shell or for the fish itself ? Both for the shell and for the calipee and the calipash.
4131. Did you have some vessels working for the turtle aud the calipee and the calipash ? We had one
vessel working for about six months.
4132. Was she successful ? No ; not commercially.
4133. Did you have no market for the produce you obtained ? The produce did not realise the prices I
had expected.
4134. By the Chairman: Did you send it home to London? Yes. While in London I obtained'
information as to the prices of the products of the turtle from the leading turtle merchant there, who
does business with the West Indies.
4135. And on his representations you undertook the experiment? Yes. I fitted out a boat, and placed
it in charge of a white man I had working for me.
4136. What were the results? The catch was not as large as I expected, and the prices realised were
low, resulting in a small loss.
4137. By Mr. Douglas: In the waters of Torres Strait there are large numbers of turtles? Yes,
throughout the reef areas.
4138. By Mr. Bennett : What was the process by which you preserved the calipash and calipee ? I
sun-dried it only. It is very like glue when it is dried.
4139. By the Chairman : Then your experiment would not induce you to continue in that industry ? No.
4140. Did any explanation of the low prices come from the London house ? The turtle fat all fermented
on the way home, aud was destroyed in London.
4141. Then you had not a fair chance ? No; and I had not sufficient experience to enable me to cure it.
I was told that dry-salted it is worth, if up to market quality, 6d. a lb. It is used mainly in making a
soap lately introduced on the London market —turtle-oil soap of very high quality. A 120-lb. turtle will
furnish about 10 lb. to 12 lb calipee and calipash—wet—which will reduce to one-third when dried. This,
with the tips of the flippers dried, is worth up to about 2s. Od. per pound on the London market. Calipee
and calipash somewhat resemble glue when dried. The former is of a whitish tinge, and comes from the
back, and the latter is dark, and comes from the belly. Turtle fat is of a greenish colour, and is worth
in London about 6d. per pound, salted. This is used for the manufacture of a first-class soap, which I
have seen and sampled. The green turtle supplies proportionately more calipee and calipash than the
hawksbill. The hawksbill, if old, and particularly if a bull, is of greater value for its shell. Turtle-shell
from Torres Strait averages as follows on London selling prices :
K. O.
Mackenzie.
15 June, 1908.


Twelve months ago the market was about 50 per cent, higher in value. Turtle, with little doubt, can he
cultivated to commercial advantage by breeding, when kept within enclosed areas which can be created in
many suitable places in Torres Strait. I have been informed that shell is removed from the back
by hot water without killing the animal, and the shell then grows again. In safely enclosed breeding :
areas turtle should rapidly increase, as they are prolific in egg supply and the young turtle is hardy.
Under natural conditions the young turtle finds its way to the water when the egg hatches some 9 inches
to 12 inches under the sand. It is then about the size of a florin, but on entering the water they are speedily
eaten by large fish. In tubs I have grown turtle from the egg stage to about 12 inches in length in
about twelve months, without any trouble except change of sea water twice a day and feeding. Turtle
cultivation is a by-product, which might be carried on with little labour and expense where shell
cultivation from a foreshore is the chief object.
4142. By Mr. Bennett : Do you think it would be possible to export turtle in refrigerated form? No
doubt it could be done, but you would require very large quantities to make it payable.
4143. It would hardly bo practicable here, would it P Hardly practicable.
4144. If a special line of steamers via, Torres Strait were arranged for, would it not be practicable then ?
No doubt it would be practicable, because it is quite easy to bring the turtle alive to Thursday Island.
4145. By the Chairman : Are you aware that the tinning of turtle has been carried on at Rockhampton ?
Tes; I have heard so, and I have also sampled the product from Skinner’s factory in Brisbane.
4146. Do you not think that work could be carried on here with just as successful results ? Just as well
as there, because you are on the turtle grounds here.
4147. Are they not still carrying on the industry ? Tes. The turtle industry is worked at greater
advantage in the West Indies than anywhere else, and it would be an advantage to anybody thinking of
engaging in the industry here to obtain information on the subject from the West Indies.'
4148. Is the quality of the turtle here as good as that of the turtle in the West Indies ? The calipee and
calipash I sent home were reported not to be as full as those of the West Indian turtle.
4149. The green turtle is the favourite turtle ? Green or hawksbill. I believe the turtle are cultivated
in the West Indies. They are kept in an enclosure and cultivated, and live turtle are carried on the
decks of steamers from the AYest Indies to London.
4150. By Mr. Douglas : Are there any number of turtles destroyed on the sandbanks ? A great number
of turtle are killed by fishing boats merely for their eggs.
4151. By Mr. Bennett-. But they are very prolific? Very prolific.
4152. By Mr. Douglas : AYould it be desirable to try to prevent that destruction? Not unless fishing
and cultivation of the turtle were going on at the same time. At the present time there is no fishing for
the turtle except for their shell.
4153. By Mr. Bennett : Does the quantity of turtle used for food constitute a serious drain upon their
numbers? No. Indeed, it is rather a good thing to allow boats to take them when they are out
fishing, because it affords the crews fresh food when they are outside.
4154. At present the turtle does not need any protection ? Not at present.
4155. By the Chairman : Do you think the bfiche-dc-mer industry could be made more productive than
it is at present? The beche-de-mer grounds have been very much over-worked this year, in my opinion.
4156. Do you refer to a certain portion of the reefs ? The whole of the Barrier Beef.
4157. By Mr. Douglas: By whom has the industry been mostly worked? The Japanese predominate
just now.
4158. Did you have considerable experience in the handling of beche-de-mer at Cooktown? Tes, fifteen
or sixteen years ago.
4159. Were there any Europeans engaged in the industry then ? Tes, there were several Europeans
employing aboriginal labour.
4160. How many years ago was that ? In the early nineties.
4161. ATore there many vessels working from Cooktown ? A number.
4162. All owned by Europeans ? Tes.
4163. How many vessels ? Roughly speaking, there must have been fourteen or fifteen going out of
Cooktown.
4164. Were there others which went out from Port Douglas and Cairns? Tes, but Cooktown was the
main port for the beche-de-mer fishers.
4165. Do you know any man who made a success of it ? The man who was most successful was Alec.
Mathieson, with a small boat called the “ Griffin.” He retired after a few years. Ho fished only for
the best quality of fish.
4166. By the Chairman : Did he extend his operations beyond the Barrier Reef ? He went to some of
the reefs in the Coral Sea.
4167. AYhat price did the fish realise in Cooktown ? From £l2O to £l6O per ton.
4168. Did you never see it go up to £2OO per ton there ? There may have been individual parcels of
well-cured fish which brought a higher price, but 1 have actually handled fish of the best quality myself
which brought from £l2O to £l6O a ton.
4169. By Mr. Bennett : Tou say that those vessels sailing out of Cooktown were owned by Europeans ?
They were all owned by Europeans —the Underwoods, McMaster, and men of that class.
4170. AY ho was in charge of the boats, as a rule P They formed a station on one of the islands, and a
coloured man was in charge of the boats working under their direction from the station.
4171. They did not go in charge of the boats themselves ? Ido not think so. They stayed at the station
and supervised the curing.
4172. By Mr. Douglas: AYhat was the tonnage of the vessels —the “ Griffin,” for instance ? About 40
tons. She was the largest.
4173. By Mr. Bennett: AVas Mathieson in charge of her himself ? Tes; and he carried a white mate,
the crew consisting mainly of South Sea Islanders.
4174. Is it more advantageous to employ large or small vessels in the beche-de-mer industry? It
depends upon whether you are going far afield. If you are going into the AVestern Pacific you will
require a larger vessel and a couple of tenders. Alec. Mathieson had two cutters of about 6 tons each
accompanying him wherever he went.
4175. By Mr. Douglas: Those are the vessels you spoke of as being in charge of colourecj men ? Tes.

417 G. He sent out the smaller vessels from the station? Yes. That was the only large vessel employed.
The Underwoods sailed their own vessels. There were several brothers, and they went out in the boats
or stayed at the station, as the case might be.
3.4177. By Mr. Bennett: They did well in their boats ? Yes.
4178. By the Chairman-. McMaster and Johnson were in charge of their own boats? Yes. Another
white man, whose name I have forgotten, had the “ Nancy.”
4179. By Mr. Bougies-. Did you not have a vessel fishing for beche-de-mer last year? Yes; I was
interested in one vessel.
4180. What were the results ? They were not satisfactory.
4181. By Mr. Bennett : The catch was insufficient? We employed a large schooner, and wherever she
went she was a mark for all the smaller vessels fishing. As soon as she found a reef, that was the place
for everybody to go ; and the smaller vessels could get inside the breaks and gaps in the reef and lie in
comfort, while the schooner had to lie outside. She worked at a disadvantage, her small boats having to
go a greater distance to reach their base. That was the “ Norna.”
4182. By Mr. Douglas: She worked at a disadvantage through being followed by boats manned by
Japanese? They were mainly worked by Japanese.
4183. By Mr. Bennett-. Were they owned by Japanese or by white men? So far as 1 know, they were
not owned by Japanese; but Japanese were in charge of the boats.
4184. Do you know on what terms they were in charge of the boats? I think they were working on a
“ lay ” system.
4185. Have you seen any of the agreements? No; I have only heard of them. ■ Roughly, the “lay”
system in vogue is that the man in charge pays all the expenses, and then the owner gets so much a ton
as rent for the boat on the fish obtained.
418 G. By Mr. Douglas -. Then the owners benefit whatever the price of the fish may be? Yes.
4187. If the value of the fish is low, it is the man in charge who suffers? Yea. We were working
purely on wages; and with a valuable schooner we had to employ a good crew and pay good wages,
which was a handicap.
4188. Does the competition of boats in charge of Japanese, and carrying aboriginal crews, interfere with
Europeans carrying on the industry—Did they interfere in the case of the “ Norna” ? Not to any great
ex'ent, because the “Norna” was very attractive to aboriginals owing to her size and comfort. Of course
there is a keen competition among the smaller vessels in getting crews.
4189. Would it be advisable to enforce strictly the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act whereby
beche-de-mer vessels of T 5 tons or over would have to be in charge of a certificated master ? I think so.
Where vessels are allowed to roam the length of the Queensland coast they ought to be in charge of a
person of assured competency.
4190. Under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act there is no specified tonnage laid down, but the
recognised custom has been to allow vessels up to 25 tons to go out without a certificated master ? Yes.
I do not suggest that the Merchant Shipping Act should apply if a vessel is working from one port.
4191. By Mr. Bennett : You mean working out of one port and returning to that port ? Exactly, and
not passing along the coast.
4192. By the Chairman : Mathieson went out from Cooktown and worked outside the Barrier ? He was
a certificated man and carried a mate.
4193. Yes; but he went outside the bounds of a coasting master’s certificate? He cleared for the Coral
Sea when he left Cooktown.
4194. But a coasting master’s certificate did not entitle him to go off the coast ? No.
4195. By Mr. Bennett : What do you consider the southern limit of this port ? I believe the limit was
laid down at half-way to Cooktosvn, somewhere about Cape Sidmouth. Beyond that you are within the
Cooktown jurisdiction.
419 G. Taking that as the limit, you consider the man in charge should not be required to hold any
certificate ? Ido not think so.
4197. By Mr. Douglas-. The beche-de-mer industry has not been worked to any great extent by
Europeans from Thursday Island ? Not at all latterly. Recently three Europeans went fishing,
remained a very short time at it, and then abandoned it.
4198. Did it not prove sufficiently remunerative ? I believe not.
4199 . By the Chairman-. Were they used to a marine life ? One of them held a foreign-going second
mate’s certificate. He was a policeman here.
4200. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any knowledge of the working of the Ceylon Pearl-shell Fisheries?
Some years ago I made inquiries while passing in that vicinity.
4201. Did you visit the scene of operations ? No.
4202. Can you give us an outline of the conditions under which they work—They fish mostly for pearls,
and not for shell ? They fish solely for pearls.
4203. By the Chairman-. The shell is of no commercial value? No, except for lime, and that is not
wanted. I have been told that latterly there is a great improvement there, because the Governments
of India and Ceylon have devoted a great deal of attention to the cultivation of shell. The boats go out
to work under the supervision of a Government steamer. They start and cease work at a given signal;
and they can only work upon areas indicated by the Government officer in charge of the fishery.
4204. By Mr. Douglas : Do they close certain areas for certain periods ? Yes.
4205. By Mr. Bennett -. Only certain portions of the fishery areas are thrown open ? Yes.
420 G. And only for certain months in the year ? Yes.
4207. So that the fishery is very greatly restricted ? Yes.
4208. With advantage ? Yes. It had reached a very low ebb. I have some figures—l have not got
them with me—showing that the output fell very rapidly.
4209. The Government consequently took it in hand to restore its productiveness? Yes. They
appointed scientific men to study the question, and they are now working on the recommendations of
those men.
4210. By Mr. Douglas : Did they close the whole of the beds for a fixed period ? I believe so.
4211. What was the term ? Ido not know.
4212. They work on a co-operative system ? Yes. When landed, the shell is divided into a certain
number of shares and sold at auction, and the buyers take their chance of the pearls.
K. O.
Mackenzie

4213. Then the shell is opened, and the pearls are extracted ? Tes. it is divided into a certain number
of heaps, and the Government have the option of picking their heap, and the pearls obtained from that
heap constitute the Government revenue. One of the other heaps belong to the divers, and the other to <
the owners of the boats.
4214 By Mr. Bennett : So that it is purely a lottery ? Tes ; it is altogether a speculation,
4215. But it is a lottery sufficiently attractive to induce a great many people to enter into it ? Tes.
4216. Have you formed any opinion as to the working life of a diver under ordinary conditions ? Divers
working under ordinary conditions in shallow water have been diving, to my knowledge, almost
continuously for a number of years.
4217. I am referring to the usual run of men—What number of years would be the average for an
ordinary man ? I have not figured it out; but a number of divers that I employed when I started are
still diving. That is eight years.
4218. Have many dropped out ? Some have dropped out by going to other fields. Some of them have
gone to Western Australia and to the Aroe Islands, and have afterwards come back.
4219. Have you any opinion as to what should be the average working life of a diver ? I have no fixed
opinion. I tabulated a return showing the quantity of small shell picked up by the fleet with which I
am associated. In 1905 the percentage of chicken shell was 8. In 1906 it fell to 3 per cent. In 1907
it was 2 per cent.; and this year to date it works out at a little over 1 per cent.
4220. To what do you attribute that decrease ? On the “ lay” system the diver seeks more for the larger
shell, and he avoids the young shell.
4221. Is there anything further you wish to bring under the notice of the Commission? No.
Geoege Keee, Master Mariner, examined :
4222. By the Chairman : What are you ? A master mariner.
4223. How long have you been at Thursday Island ? Twenty-seven years.
4224. During that time have you been employed in the pearl-shell industry ? Tes. I was pearl-shelling
on my own account here at one time,
4225. In the capacity of employer ? Tes.
4226. And manager ? I was master of a pearling schooner for years.
4227. On your own account ? I have been on my own account.
4228. I presume you are familar with the whole working of the industry ? Tes, I had a lot to do with it
in most of its phases.
4229. What is the present condition of the pearling-grounds —Are they partially depleted, or is shell
plentiful ? I think the shell has increased the last two years—l think the beds have replenished
themselves a bit.
4230. Do you think there is sufficient shell for the number of boats at present employed to work
profitably ? I think so. If the boats now working had favourable weather, I believe they could make
profitable returns.
4231. If the number were increased would there be sufficient shell to keep them profitably employed ?
I think the shell would get a bit scarce again if the whole fleet came back—the same as it was before.
4232. Then you think there is a sufficient number of boats now engaged in the industry ? I think so.
4233. Tou do not think the present number should be increased? I think the present number are
suitable for the work.
4234. They are quite enough ? I think so.
4235. By Mr. Bennett : Having in view the permanent maintenance of the beds ? Tes—to give the beds
a chance to recover.
4236. By the Chairman t Which grounds, in your opinion, are in the best condition ? The shell is most
plentiful Darnley Island way. It is lying thick on the bottom there in very deep water, and I believe
that is where the spat mainly comes from that supplies the Old Ground.
4237. Do you think the spat is carried from there to the Old Ground by the south-east winds ? Tes,
and the tide, which sets away down towards the Warrior Reef and the Old Ground. And down
Deliverance Island way there is plenty of shell. That is good breeding ground.
4238. To what number do you think the boats should be limited ? About 240 or 250, I think.
4239. That is nearly double the number you have at the present time ? I dare say it is.
4240. Tou said that you thought there were sufficient boats now for the shell available? Tes.
4241. Well, what number do you think might be employed ? Anything under 200 boats.
4242. Would they find profitable employment ? I think so.
4243. Do you think it is necessary that beds should be closed in order that they may recuperate ? I
maintain that the only bed which should be closed is the Darnley Island bed, where the spat mainly comes
from.
4244. What is your reason for suggesting that that bed should be closed ? To give the Old Ground a
chance to grip the spat as it is taken across by the tide.
4245. What do you think would be the effect of a periodical closure of beds ? The shelters would have
to go fossicking round and look for fresh fields.
4246. What would be the effect on the areas closed ? I think it was an improvement having Endeavour
Strait closed a year or two ago. It partially recovered itself, but it has been pretty well fished again
since it was reopened. There have been a great number of boats fishing there since the ground was
reopened.
4247. By Mr. Bennett : Tou consider, then, that closure has a beneficial effect ? Oh yes.
4248. It had a beneficial effect on Endeavour Strait ? Tes, as far as I could learn from those who
worked there after the ground was reopened.
4249. Did you not work on it yourself ? Not after it was reopened.
4250. By the Chairman : What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? I think
6 inches. , . ,
4251. What is your reason for that opinion ? Ido not think any spat would be thrown from a 5-inch
shell. Spat might be thrown from a 6-inch shell.
4252. But what do you think should be the minimum size for exportable shell I A 5-inch shell is not a
very big shell.

4253. By Mr. Bennett : Have you any idea of the difference in weight between a 5-inch and a 6-inch
x shell ? Very little.
t. 4254. By the Chairman : Do you think any restriction should he placed on the size of vessels employed
in the pearl-shell industry ? Al 2 or 14 ton boat is a very suitable boat for fishing purposes in Torres
Strait. Of course, plenty of boats are 17 tons.
4255. Have you had any experience on a floating station ? Tes ; about four years altogether.
4256. "What is the result of working under the floating-station system ? At that time you collected all
the shell yourself, brought it on board the schooner, opened it, and cleaned it. That was a benefit to the
owners.
4257. Did it tend to deplete or denude the area you were working—you worked close together in
one place ? Yes, close together. As far as the eye could see you could see boats from your own schooner
at work.
4258. Did not working in that way deplete the fishing ground ? The seaweed at the bottom is like a field
of corn at one season of the year. It ripens and withers just before the north-west winds set in. Then
it breaks up and comes to the surface, and the ground at the bottom becomes clear. You get much more
shell at that time of the year than you do when a diver has to move the weeds away with his hands, and
move along as he would do in a field of corn.
4259. Have you been in the diving dress ? Yes, two or three times, but not to work.
4260. Do you think a boat of 12 or 14 tons affords the necessary accommodation and comfort for the
diver and crew? I think so. A 14-ton boat is a good comfortable boat.
4261. Have you engaged in any experiments for the cultivation of the pearl oyster ? Only during the
time the “Billy Barlow” was up here. I was then master of the “ Sagitta ” schooner. The “Billy
Barlow ” was the vessel Mr. Clark brought up here to bring the shell into Friday Island Passage.
4262. What was your experience? When the young shell was collected from the different beds we
merely placed it on board the “ Billy Barlow,” carried it to Friday Island Passage, and threw it overboard
into the Passage.
4263. What size was the shell you picked up ? About 5 inches. Very few of them were under that
size.
4264. Do you know what was the result of that experiment ? I believe there were a good few dead ones
found afterwards.
4265. In Friday Island Passage ? Yes.
4266. Do you know if the shell increased in size ? I believe that those which lived and were picked up
increased in size.
4267. By Mr. Bennett : Did you not see the shell that was picked up ? I did not.-
4268. You are familiar with the conditions of a diver’s life in Torres Strait, are you not ? Yes.
4269. By the Chairman: Do you think white men could carry on the industry? We had white men,
carrying on the industry in Torres Strait about twenty years ago. There were about fifteen or sixteen
white divers working here.
4270. Were they working on their own account, or as employees ? Some of them had boats of their own
and others were working boats for owners. They all seemed to get a good bit of shell; but, of course,
shell was more plentiful in those days.
4271. Do you know what meed of success attended the efforts of those working for themselves ? Some
of them did very well. The Andersens managed to get two or three boats of their own. Another man
named Larsen had about £l,lOO in the bank when the Q.N. Bank closed, and owned his own boat besides.
He began with nothing; he was a very steady man.
4272. Did he continue in the industry? Not after the bank closed. He sold out and went home.
4273. You know that all the divers at present engaged in the industry are Japanese ? Yes.
4274. Do you think it desirable that they should be continued in that position ? Ido not think you can
beat the Japanese for keeping at his work. He is a most determined worker.
4275. We want to know if the work can be made attractive to people of our own colour ? Ido not see
why a young fellow with a good strong constitution should not make a success of diving. It would be
worth while giving it a trial.
4276. Do you think that with reasonable care and under normal conditions a diver’s life in Torres Strait
is more hazardous than the life of a fisherman in the North Sea ? The fishermen in the North Sea, who
are out in severe weather in the winter time, have to undergo more hardships than a diver engaged in
pearl-shelling in Torres Strait.
4277. The names of the divers you have mentioned would indicate that they are of Scandinavian
nationality? Yes.
4278. Do you not think that more Scandinavians might be induced to engage in the industry ? I think
they might.
4279. Can you suggest what steps it would he necessary to take in order to secure the industry for white
men ? I think it would be a good thing if the Government had a suitable small vessel to take them out
and put them through the work of diving.
4280: By Mr. Douglas-. You mean a training school? Yes.
4281. Do you remember some reformatory boys you had when you were master of the “ White Star ” ?
Yes ; two little chaps I took from Lytton.
4282. Are they the sort of lads you think would be suitable for training as divers ? Yes ; especially one
of them, who was a sturdy, strong boy. But they were rather young then to be trained as divers.
4283. Are there boys in the reformatory school who you think would be willing to engage in the
industry ? I think so —that is, boys who are just leaving the reformatory.
4284. Did the boys you had work well ? Yes ; and they were as strong as young bullocks.
4285. By Mr. Bennett : Would you favour the idea of training anyone for a diver who was not a full-
grown young man ? No.
4286. By the Chairman ■ Do you think it would be an aid to the industry if a marine biologist were
appointed to supervise the cultivation of the pearl-oyster ? I think it would be a great help.
4287. Then you think that with a school for the education of divers and Government assistance in the
way of appointing a marine biologist the industry could be carried on by white men ? I think so ;
but white men would have to learn the diving. It is not like going down to the wharf.


4288. How long would it take a young fellow with a leaning towards seafaring life to become an efficient
diver for pearl-shell ? Three months or thereabouts.
4289. Would you suggest that men should undergo a medical examination before they are licensed asj
divers ? I think it would be advisable, as some chaps might have a weak heart.
4290. Do you consider the present system of basing the amount of license fee on the tonnage of the
vessel satisfactory ? I think so.
4291. By Mr. Bennett: At present a vessel of 10 tons pays a license fee of £3, and for every ton over
10 tons there is an additional charge of 10s. per ton —Do you think that system could be improved ? I
think it should be £5, whatever the size of the boat, as a large boat only carries one pump like a small
boat.
4292. Would you favour the introduction of a uniform license fee, irrespective of tonnage ? Tes ; and
I would fix the fee at about £5 for large and small boats. I think that would be a fair thing.
4293. By the Chairman : Were you here when the Clark syndicate left ? No.
4294. Was there any "difficulty in obtaining labour at the time they left ? Not that I know of. They
could always get men from Singapore.
4295. Could they not get men from New Guinea or down the coast ? There would be no trouble in
getting plenty of labour from New Guinea.
4296. By Mr. Bennett: Tou know New Guinea ? I know New Guinea well.
4297. By the Chairman : Do you think Papuans can be converted into crews for diving vessels ? Yes;
they are really good boatmen.
4298. Have you had any experience in the beche-de-mer industry ? Tes.
4299. Have you carried it on yourself ? Tes.
4300. Could the industry be carried on by white men P Certainly.
4301. Could the system of fishing be rendered more attractive ? It would be more comfortable if larger
vessels were used.
4302. By Mr. Bennett: Do you mean that the industry could be carried on with white men as masters
and crew ? Only with white masters. I do not think white men would work long on the reefs as crew.
4303. Could the industry pay the wages white men would require ? Ido not think so. Beche-de-mer
is getting scarce nowadays.
4304. By the Chairman : Can you assign any reason for the sudden fall in the price of beche-de-mer ? No.
4305. By Mr. Bennett: Tou must have come here not many years after the fishery started ? That is so.
4306. "When you came, what grounds were being worked principally ? All the reefs round the islands
in Torres Strait —all the big reefs on the south-east side of the islands. I have known them to work
about these islands for two and a-half years without ever shifting.
4307. By the Chairman : Por beche-de-mer ? Tes.
4308. By Mr. Bennett: lam speaking of pearl-shell ? When I came here first, in the Somerset days,
we used to fish on the ground around Peak Point and down towards Crab Island, and on the Warrior
Reef.
4309. And afterwards ? Afterwards the Old Ground broke out.
4310. Did they not go up Badu way ? Tes, by Badu, Green Island, and round there.
4311. Was shell plentiful in those days ? Tes.
4312. Very plentiful? It was very plentiful when the Old Ground broke out first.
4313. Could shell be obtained now on the grounds that were worked profitably in those days ? Tes,
more or less.
4314. More or less—which ? It is perhaps not so thick now. Perhaps you would have to walk about
the ground three times now to pick up one shell where you would have picked up six in the old days.
4315. Then are you of opinion that the inshore beds have been pretty well cleared out of shell ? I
think so ; because during bad weather there is smooth water right down Endeavour Strait, and the boats
come in from the rough water on the Old Ground, so that there is a whole forest of boats at work, and
they are bound to give the beds a big clearing out.
4316. Is it your opinion that the beds are denuded of shell in comparison with the amount of shell on
them fifteen years ago ? Tes ; very much.
4317. The inshore beds are the most denuded ? Tes.
4318. Do you remember what year it was when the Old Ground was discovered ? I think it was about
1884.
4319. How far out from Badu was the first shell found ? The old man who discovered the ground
anchored off West Island, and during the night the boat got adrift, and in the morning he could not
see Badu from the deck, so that he must have been 13 or 14 miles to leeward. It was fine weather, and
he thought he would have a try until the tide turned. He went down and found the place just a mass
4320. If you went fishing in that neighbourhood now—l 3 or 14 miles from Badu—could you get anything
like the same quantity of shell ? Tes ; we have worked there many a time with the schooners.
4321. But I mean latterly ? I could not say anything about latterly, because it is a few years since I
was in the schooners.
4322. What was the greatest distance from Badu that the schooners worked ? Twenty-five or thirty
miles due west from Badu.
4323. No further than that? It might have been a little further than that sometimes.
4324. How far is Cook Shoal from Badu ? I have seen them working a long way outside Cook Shoal —
20 miles dead to leeward of Booby Island.
4325. Do you think that the inner beds on the Old Ground have been denuded to a greater or less extent ?
I think they have been.
4326. Have you been out since the fleets went away ? No.
4327. Then you have no opinion as to what the grounds have been producing since then? No.
4328. Tou were formerly master of the Government steamers “ Albatross” and “ White Star”? Tes.
4329. Tou were also Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries ? Tes.
4330. Have you formed any opinion upon the question of leasing areas for cultivation purposes p I
think a good place would be at Possession Island, at the north-west anchorage between there and Eoko.
That would he the most suitable place, as it would be sheltered. It has also a good grassy bottom all
over, which is necessary for breeding purposes.

4331. If a few areas were closed for cultivation purposes, would it be beneficial to the industry by
assisting in restoring the supply of shell ? I think it would.
8. 4332. Tinder suitable conditions, of course ? Yes.
4333. If Endeavour Strait were closed, what would be the best means of enforcing the closure, by patrol
or any other means, to keep off poachers ? The cheapest way would be to have a lugger there. It
would be a big expense to keep a steamer there, and a lugger would suit the purpose just as well, while
it would be much cheaper. She would have to be a good smart boat.
4334. What about a powerful oil launch ? That would be still better, but you would want a fast one.
4335. What do you think of establishing a station from which to work this patrol boat? A very good
place would be Eed Island. There is a nice safe harbour there protected from all winds.
4336. Do you think there would be a sufficient outlook ? If your house was on the top of the island,
which is a good height, you could see a long way in both directions.
4337. Would not Dayman Island or Possession Island be a better place ? I dare say they would. There
is good water on Dayman Island.
4338. But could you have a good lookout from the top of Dayman Island ? You might manage to make
a track to the top, but 1 do not think you could build a house there.
4339. Could a house be built on Possession Island ? Yes.
4340. But it has not so good an anchorage, taking it all round, as there is at Dayman or Eed Island ?
You have a splendid anchorage there.
4341. But not on the weather side ? No. On the west side there would be a nasty sea, but you could
find shelter.
4342. What do you think of Port Lihou ? It is too far across from the fishing ground for efficiency,
especially on the mainland side outside of Dayman Island.
4343. On the whole, you think that somewhere in the chain of islands, from Eed Island northward, would
be the best place to establish a station ? Yes.
4344. If white divers were employed, do you think they would require white tenders ? I have known
some of them have coloured tenders, but I think they would prefer to have men of their own colour.
4345. What countrymen were the coloured tenders you refer to ? I have known Manila men and South
Sea Islanders.
4346. By the Chairman : I thought they were all Earatongans and Fijians ? There were all sorts in the
boats at that time —men from nearly all the South Sea Islands.
4347. By Mr. Bennett : Have you any idea of the working life of a diver ? I have known of men being
constantly at work for about fifteen years.
4348. But they would be good men? Yes, Maoris.
4349. What was the .average working life of the men you saw when you were on the floating stations ?
From ten to twelve years.
4350. By Mr. Douglas : Do you remember the Quintals ? Yes.
4351. They were Norfolk Islanders ? Yes.
4352. Were they good divers ? Yes.
4353. What became of Maplebeck? He went into deep water at Darnley Island, became paralysed, and died.
4354. Was he a good diver ? Yes; and he was only a small chap. Then Harry Hatch was even smaller,
and he was a good diver. He was a great shell getter.
4355. In Judge Dashwood’s report is a list of some seventy white divers—Will you pick out those whom
you know to have been successful [ Report handed to Witness ] ? Brennan, the brothers Bruce, Andrew
Sinclair, the three Andersens, Larsen, Tolman, Tom Mullins, Dahrakohler, Bill the Groper, Deaf Bill or
Pritchard, Angus McDonald, Jack Woodhead, Harry Allen, Charles Quintal, Christian, Harry Colless,
Jack Norman, and McCrae were all good divers.
4356. How was it that most of those men came to drift out of the industry ? Some of them got tired
of fishing, and some of them got into debt. They used to spend their money freely, make big drafts on
the owners, and get on the wrong side of their books.
Geoege Vincent White, Medical Practitioner and Surgeon Superintendent of the Torres Strait
Hospital, examined:
i. 4357. By the Chairman : What are you ? A duly qualified medical practitioner, at present resident at
Thursday Island.
i. 4358. By Mr. Douglas: And surgeon superintendent of the Torres Strait Hospital? Yes.
4359. By the Chairman: How long have you been on the island ? Nearly nine years.
4360. During that period have you become familiar with the fatalities which have taken place among
pearl-shell divers ? Yes.
4361. From what you know of the pearl-shell industry, do you think it could be carried on by white men ?
I think so. I think it is an insult to the white man to say that he cannot do the work.
4362. Do you think diving is more trying than any other occupation to a man of good physique who has
no organic disease ? I think not. Frank Summers started diving long ago, and he is an object-lesson
showing that a white man can do the work just as well as a man of any other race.
4363. Then you think that a man following the occupation of a diver has every chance of becoming an
old man ? 1 think so.
4364. Do you think it necessary that a man should undergo a medical examination before engaging in
diving ? I think it would be a good plan, if white men are going to take the risk.
4365. By Mr. Douglas : I suppose that in your capacity as surgeon superintendent of the hospital you
have seen a good many of the men who have been paralysed as a result of diving in deep water? Yes.
4366. Has the gear at present in use anything to do with those fatalities and accidents in diving—Do
you think it could be improved upon ? 1 think it can be improved upon.
4367. Do you think the diving dress is likely to bo improved? I think so. Mr. Summers and myself
have evolved a plan which is apparently arriving at, I will not say perfection, but something like
perfection.
4368. With improvements in the dress, diving would be less dangerous to life ? Certainly.
4369. Will the improvements you have effected enable divers to go into deeper water ? I think so. The
.divers have already gone down 25 fathoms, and I am trying to improve the dress on a pneumatic

principle so as to reduce any risk there may in diving at greater depths. There is a young man here *
named Colless, who has been down in the dress, though not in deep water, and he told me that when he
was on the bottom walking was just the same as walking on deck, except that ho had the lea I boots to •
carry. The Japanese are very conservative, and will not take any chance with a new dress. They would
sooner wrap themselves in flannel than adopt a new idea. But those who have been in my dress are quite
satisfied with the idea. The Dunlop Company, of Australia, are building these dresses for me,
experimentally, for nothing, though, of course, they want the chance of making them afterwards, if
they prove successful. They are filled with the idea of the dress.
4-370. They have turned out some new kind of piping lately, have they not? I believe so. This
particular dress, I really believe, is a success. It is made of rubber throughout, and is only like
a jacket which covers the belly*.
4371. Will it be expensive? The first one I had made was made by the North British Eubber
Company; it cost me £9—and it was badly made. The next was made by the Dunlop Company, who
charged me £4.
4372. You are interested in pearl-shelling boats, are you not? Oh yes! Mr. Colless promised that if
you wished him to come over and give evidence as to his trial of the dress he would do so. My opinion
is that it can be made a white man’s industry.
4373. Do you think that if assistance were given to the white man to engage in the industry—assistance
in the shape of a training school for divers—there would be a tendency to improve the diving gear? Yes.
4374. By Mr. Bennett : Working under present conditions, with the present diving dress and gear, what
do you reckon is the average working life of a diver? It is hard to tell. I knew a Japanese who lived
at the game up to forty-five years of age. ' There was one died the other day, and he had been a long
time diving.
4375. How long had those men been diving ? As long as I can remember them.
437 G. I do not mean taking individual instances, such as Summers and “Cranky” Francis, which are
exceptional—What do you think would be the average life of an ordinary working diver ? Do you mean
the number of years he might work without injury to his health ?
4377. Yes ? I think ho ought to do it for twenty years.
4377 a. You say that as a medical man ? As a medical man, I say if he would only take care of
himself he would do it for twenty years.
4378. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think it is essential that a diver should have a strong heart ? That is a
curious question. I recently met a man who was working for Mr. Hookings for years and years in deep
water. Then he went to work in shallow water. That man had heart disease, and he is working in deep
water at the present time, so that I can hardly answer your question. 1 think it would be advantageous
to have men examined before they are licensed.
4379. By Mr. Bennett-. I suppose you would not consider a weak heart advantageous to a diver? No.
G-eoege Beett, Sub-Inspector of Police, Thursday Island, examined :
4380. By the Chairman : What are you ? Sub-Inspector of Police.
4381. Can you give us any information relative to the subject-matter of our inquiries ? I have not much
experience in the pearl-shell industry. I have been here only about two years.
4382. I presume that during your stay on the Island as sub-inspector of police you have seen a good deal
of the natives ashore ? Yes. For about nine months I was protector of aboriginals.
4383. Did they often get grog ashore ? They very seldom got drunk, as far as I know.
4384. Have no cases of drunkenness come before you ? One or two only. Since I have been here I
have looked very carefully after them, and during the last two years I have not noticed more than two
natives the worse for liquor.
4385. Is not the supply of liquor to aboriginals prohibited ? Yes. The police strictly enforce the Act.
438(5. Have there been any complaints made by outsiders? There have never been any complaints made
since 1 came here of the supply of drink to aboriginals. I have an extract from a newspaper report of
the evidence given in Brisbane by Mr. James Clark, to the effect that the law is a dead letter on Thursday
Island so far as the prohibition of the sale of liquor to aboriginals and South Sea Islanders is concerned.
There was no justification for that statement.
4387. You deny the truth of that allegation ? I give it a most emphatic denial. After I came here I
went to some of the hotel-keepers and told them that it was reported to me before I came here at all that
there was an excessive amount of drinking, and that, if I found it necessary, I would place a constable at
each of the hotels to prevent the blacks being supplied with drink. I have not been in some of the hotels
since; but very little drink, if any, is supplied to the blacks at the present time.
4388. It would have come under your notice if such had been the case ? I can say it is not _ the case.
I do not know when Mr. Clark was on Thursday Island —certainly he has not been here while I have
been on the Island. _
4389. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think that the Japanese should be allowed to recruit natives ? I think
that permits to recruit natives should not be granted to any coloured aliens.
4390. By the Chairman : Is there anything else you wish to say ? Japanese are not prevented from
getting liquor under the Licensing Act. I certainly think they should not be permitted to take liquor on
the boats, if they have any natives on board, and under the Act they can get as much as 2 gallons.
While I was away relieving the inspector at Cairns last December, at Daruley Island, a half-drunken
Eotumah boy asked a Japanese diver who had got some liquor on another boat for some of it, and when
the diver refused the Eotumah hoy stabbed him with a knife straight away.
4391. Have you had any trouble with the Japanese drinking when on shore? No. If they make any
trouble, it is generally confined to themselves. While I recognise that it is going rather far, if I could
do it, I would prohibit the Japanese also from being supplied with drink. Last year there were
complaints of Japanese buying a case of whisky or beer and then retailing it to their country people in
the “ Yokohama.” We tried to get evidence to prosecute, but it is nearly impossible to get evidence
against them. '
4392. By Mr. Bennett-. Others besides Japanese might do that? It was tried before I came here, with
success. The only thing is that you must give some man money to buy drink from those men. I would
be inclined to prohibit all coloured races, including the Japanese, from getting liquor. I had a good deal of

experience of the natives while I was acting as Protector of Aboriginals, and I believe that, if the Japanese
were prohibited from diving, you could get the island natives to become good divers. Some people say
, they would not make good pump divers, but I know that they make good swimming divers; and Ido not
see why young fellows of from eighteen to twenty-five years of age should not be trained. I think .you
could get 100 at the present time.
4393. The desire is to secure the work for white people ? But you will have the Torres Strait natives
with you at all times.
4394. The Torres Strait islanders and Papuans are dependent for protection on the British, and they
might be used as crews ; but our object is to find means by which the industry can be made attractive to
people of our own race ? Physically, the island natives are as strong as any people I know.
Frederick Charles Hodel, Merchant, and Owner of Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Boats, further
examined:
4395. By the Chairman : You stated the other day that you would lay a scheme before the Commission
under which you suggest the Government should take or er the whole of the boats at present engaged in
the pearl-shell industry, with the view of substituting white divers for the alien divers now employed ?
Yes ; I have prepared a scheme, which I will read to you. It is as follows :
The Government to purchase all the boats at present engaged in pump-diving operations, and work under
the existing conditions just so many and for such a time as may bo necessary to complete existing engagements ;
but in no case to exceed three years, that being the term for which the Japanese are indented.
Assuming there are now 114 pump boats to acquire, the number required to carry on existing labour
contracts should not exceed sixty-four.
Two of the best of the other fifty boats should at once he placed in charge of experienced European divers
as training boats, but actually working in quest of pearl-shell. On these young men should be permitted to
accept service to learn diving and tendering, each boat taking at least four pupils in addition to her ordinary crew.
Each one of these four men could make a descent each working day until the boat’s return to port in about six
weeks’ time. The men who have acquired confidence enough to work on their own boats should then be given a
boat at cost price on the time-payment system, free of interest for at least two years.
The Government must permit the divers to sell their produce to the best advantage, to enable the divers
to get supplied with the necessary provisions to carry on with. As a decreased output w'ould necessarily follow
this restricted working, it is almost certain the price in the London market would improve, especially as the
output would be restricted for some time. With an increased price and the improved catch which must result
from fewer boats being at work, there is little doubt the white divers would soon be able to make their boats pay.
As a white man acquired a boat the Government must pass over to him crew from the men at work in the
boats under the old conditions, laying up the latter boats from time to time as their labour was absorbed by the
white divers. . ...
Those indented men, who declined these altered conditions, could be given the option of returning to their
homes. Most of them can be deported at their masters’ wish prior to completion of engagement.
When the present imported alien labour had been passed out, natives of the islands and Papuans could be
secured to fill up the boats. In the latter case the Government could supervise or assist in the recruiting (with
the support of the Papuan Government) if necessary.
The training boats should be kept employed for a period of at least two years, or even longer, should there
be not enough white divers trained by that time to take up all the Government boats. It is reasonable to assume
each boat would turn out at least twenty divers a year, allowing a good percentage for failures. At the end of two
years there would thus be eighty divers.
Not more than 100 boats should be allowed to work until a period of four or five years have elapsed to
enable the white divers to get a fair footing, and, at least, partly clear their boats.
After that stage is reached, the number might be unrestricted, protection being afforded by refusing to
license a boat unless the owner himself became the diver, or had secured a lease of some foreshore for cultivation
purposes. Even in the latter case, the number of boats which any person or company could hold or work in
connection with the lease should be four boats.
Under the above scheme I am prepared to pledge my firm to finance for a period of two years at least ten
white divers, who have taken over fully fitted out boats from the Government. By “ finance ” I mean to cover the
responsibility of the men’s wages and all provisions and gear on the diver undertaking to allow such to be a first
charge on the produce he obtains.
I have also no doubt Mr. James Clark would assist even more generously by renewing the offer he made in
1897 in the Torres Strait Pilot, as follows : “If the Government will make the hiring of boats to aliens illegal,
buy up all the boats at present owned by them, and sell them to the white men on the time-payment system,
charging not more than 5 per cent, interest, I will lend £l,OOO, free of interest, for two years, to ten white men, in
sums of £lOO each, to enable them to acquire and work out a boat to enable them to get a living.”
Just now shell is low in price pnd the catch poor, and this has been the order for over twelve months,
and yet in spite of this, four of the seven owners who depend entirely upon shelling have been adding new boats
to their fleets, quite a number being launched during the past twelve months.
This gives considerable hope that the white men would make a success of it when the profits of the catch
would go to them as well as the results of their work as divers, less a certain amount for agency fees.
In effecting a purchase, I assume that the best fourteen boats should not average more than £450 each;
the next twenty, £4OO each ; the next twenty, £350 each; the next twenty, £3OO each; the next twenty, £250
each ; the poorest twenty, £2OO each. If any owner refused to submit to a reasonable valuation, then he would
have to submit to the altered conditions and work with white divers as soon as his present engagements ceased.
Upon these valuations, the purchase price would thus total £36,300.
The working of a training boat with five crew and four pupils should not cost more than £6O per month,
allowing for insurance and upkeep of boat. This represents £720 per year, less the value of the catch. This
should be, after allowing for loss of time and other contingencies, nearly 2 tons of shell per year, with pearls,
making a total value of £250, leaving £470 as the loss each year on working the training boats.
The sixty-four boats worked to complete the present labour contracts should not show any loss in the
year’s work or until they were taken over by whites. If the shell market kept low, there might bo no profits,
and, at the end of the year, considerable depreciation. This I put at £4O per boat per year, giving a total
of £5,000, roughly, for the two years.
The upkeep of the fifty boats until they had been handed over to whites would come to nearly £lO per
month at first, decreasing as the boats became less in number. £l2O should, however, cover the total expenditure
until all the boats were handed over.
Many of the poorer boats should be sold for other trades in Papua, or passed over to island natives to
work out at swimming diving. I set down a loss under this heading of £2,000, primarily caused by the pumps
and gear being thrown aside temporarily, until required, if the industry again enlarged.
P. 0. Hodel.
f —,'
15 June, 1908.


The above figures represent a capital expenditure of £36,300 and a probable loss of—training boats, £1,880; !
depreciation of sixty-four boats, £5,000; upkeep of fifty boats. £120; sale of fourteen to twenty inferior boats
£2,C00; or a total of £9,000. j
I have placed the figures on the most pessimistic basis. With good seasons and improved prices, this
assumed loss of £9,000 might actually become a profit, or at least reduced by more than half.
Allowing for the impossible contingency of an actual collapse all along the line, the expenditure of capital
and working for two years could not equal £50,000, which is a justifiable expenditure, seeing that the total value of
shell up to the end of 1901, according to the late Hon. John Douglas’s report, must have equalled £5,000,000.
Referring to the question, that much-respected Government Resident’s words are worth quoting: “It seems
somewhat extravagant to say so, but I thoroughly believe that an expenditure of even £50,000 or £lOO,OOO would
not be too big a price to pay if wo could once discover and put in practice a system of artificial cultivation.”
The above scheme is not cultivation, but it would save thousands of pounds of profits for our own race which
now drifts away to Eastern countries ; and 1 may be pardoned for again quoting from the late Hon. John Douglas’s
report for 1892: —“ I hardly think that British fishermen, with all their pluck and indomitable freedom, would as
cheerfully invite their French or Dutch neighbours to share in the privileges of their home fisheries as we do when
we license Japanese or Malays to fish within the limits of our maritime boundary.”
I see nothing improper in the State assuming to work the coloured labour at present under contract when
the intention is only to complete those contracts, and the aim to then abolish the imported labour and pave the way
for white men to take up the command of the fishing boats within their maritime boundary, and save the State
from having at its garrisoned door an Eastern race who are in such ascendancy as to be able to take the forts at
any time.
Perhaps the following opinions of other master shellers, given before the Pearl-shell Commission in 1897,
may bo interesting, as showing the capabilities of white divers:—
Mr. P. P. Outridge, question 519, said : “ White divers arc, as a rule, the best divers.”
Mr. George Smith, question 773, said: “ I have seen white men working alongside of'Manila men,
natives, and Japanese, and they are infinitely superior.”
Again, the following extract from the Federal Commission, in 1901, may reveal that, after all, white divers
are not such a fearful failure as some would wish to assert;—
“ Thursday Island, Torres Strait, 13th June, 1902.
“ To His Honour, Mr. Justice Dashwood, Commissioner of Fisheries.
“ Dear Sir, —
“ The following circumstances I wish to bring under your notice, with the desire that it may be recorded as
part of my evidence :
“ A few days before your arrival here to commence the inquiry into the pearl-shell fisheries question, I was
interviewed by Messrs. P. J. Doyle, T. J. Farquhar, manager of the Q.P.S.F. Coy., Ltd., and Mr. H. A. 0.
Douglas, manager for Mr. H. Bowden, of the Norna Pearling Company.
“ They asserted that, at a meeting of leading pearl-shellers held the previous afternoon in Burns, Philp, and
Coy.’s office, they were appointed a deputation to wait on Mr. Gummow and myself and the leaders of the Labour
Party, to see if any compromise could be effected under which all parties would be pledged to white divers and
coloured seamen before the Commissioner.
“ I suggested a conference, which was held that afternoon in Mr. Doyle’s office, those present being the
three gentlemen composing the deputation, Mr. Gummow, as a leading business man, and probably the largest
employer of white labour in the district, Messrs. E. Cohen and C. H. Ashford, as representing the Labour Party,
and myself.
"At the conference it was clearly asserted that the ‘ floating shellers ’ were prepared to recommend white
divers if Messrs. Gummow and myself (representing the ‘ shore ’ interests) and the Labour party would agree to
recommend that coloured seamen be permitted unrestricted.
“Mr. George Smith’s name was specially mentioned, he being the representative here of the five schooner
fleets of the Clark combine; and both Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Doyle assured the conference that there was no
doubt Mr. Smith was sincere, and would advocate white divers if a compromise were arranged, as he had attended
the shellers’ meeting, and committed himself to it, although he stated he would wire to Mr. James Clark to know
if he would also support the compromise.
“ I pointed out that it would be useless to recommend white divers unless they were also prepared to
recommend that the licenses for new boats be again thrown open to the public, as it ought to be, because white
divers would not come in unless there were some hope of being able to acquire boats at fair values, which was not
now possible. The change to white divers would be retarded iby the very fact that a large monopoly had been
created; and it might, later on, be argued that white men would not take to the diving if they failed to respond to
the terms laid down by the present combines.
“ Mr. Doyle and Mr. Douglas saw no objection to the boat licenses being thrown open, but Mr. Farquhar
admitted it was a point which the shellers had not discussed at their meeting, and would not be likely to agree to,
because it would throw themselves open once more to competition.
“ Mr. Cohen stated, as secretary of the Waterside Union, he could commit that body to no policy without
their having adopted that policy at a proper meeting,
“ The conference terminated without any understanding being arrived at, and the shellers at their meeting
to receive the deputation’s report decided not to proceed any further to secure joint action beyond appointing a
fresh deputation to wait upon you, immediately upon your arrival, to learn what course you proposed to adopt at
the inquiry—whether you would receive a deputation representing the shellers or take the evidence of each person
individually. This was the deputation which waited upon you on the steamer.
“ I may state that the first ‘ shellers’ ’ meeting, when it was agreed to advocate white divers, was a meeting
limited to one section of the shelling community only, myself and other shellers whose interests were deemed
contrary to those of the floating stations being left out. Amongst those left out was one gentleman who controls
fully twenty boats engaged in the industry.
« The developments outlined above show that even such an extremist as Mr. George Smith was prepared to
agree to white divers —(he had advocated white divers before the Boyal Commission in 1897) —provided white
divers could be kept in the position of servants working under the big combines ; and affords an unchallengable
argument in favour of immediate legislation for white divers gradually coming into the industry.
“ I am,
“ Yours respectfully,
"FRED. C. HODEL.
“We the undersigned, have read the above letter of Mr. Hodel’s, and the statements contained therein
having reference to the conference are a true statement of what transpired and the remarks made, we having
attended the conference at the request of Messrs. Doyle, Farquhar, and Douglas. _

There are a few other matters upon which I should like to express an opinion before you go into the
k bfiche-de-mer question.
• 4396. Very good—we shall be glad to hear your views ? lam not in favour of any board of control to
regulate the issue of licenses, assuming it be decided to foster this latter monopoly for the present
owners, on the ground that any local board would be too susceptible to local influences. I consider the
license fee for pump boats should be a fixed amount without regard to the tonnage —£1 per year for a
boat employing swimming divers, £5 for a boat carrying a diving pump and apparatus, and £25 for every
boat or schooner used as a floating base, assuming the latter to be tolerated. In 1894 the white divers
petitioned the late Sir Hugh Nelson, advocating that leaseholds be granted to Europeans only, and that every
diver be required to remove every year at least 300 living pearl-shell to some leasehold, in the hope of thus
conserving the industry ami encouraging the cultivation of pearl-shell. Ido not believe that any attempt
should be made to control buying of pearls by licensees, seeing that it has been no cheek upon illicit
dealing, and that it tends to limit the selling market to a few channels. This would especially apply
should white divers be encouraged.
4397. Do you think it necessary to have a residential qualification ? No qualification at all. I would
abolish the licensing system altogether. Last year it transpired in a case which was brought before the
court that Mr. Farquhar had bought a pearl from a man in one of his boats.
4398. Do you think it would be more convenient if the issuing of licenses for dealing in pearls were
transferred from the Police Magistrate to the Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries ? I think so.
4399. Should the issue of licenses for divers also be transferred to the Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries ?
Yes. My ambition is to establish a system of small ownership. Every owner of a boat should be, or
have been, an actual diver, and not simply a clerk, storekeeper, agent, or absentee owner; and the right
to own more than one boat up to four should be granted only to leaseholders who are cultivating in water
areas under lease, and who have resided upon their lease for at least six months in every year. Under
that system there could not be ranch dummying. Under any circumstances, bonus or no bonus, I
consider the Government should hold fast for all time the present arrangement of not issuing licenses to
aliens to dive or be in charge; but the licenses for boats should be reopened, because it sets up a
monopoly, and would nullify the prospects of the white man getting a start in the industry. The aim of
the present owners is, naturally, to prevent white men getting a start, and, without the chance of
getting a boat licensed, even a person desirous of cultivating would be at a disadvantage, as Mr. Saville
Kent was recently. He had to apply specially for a license for a diver and for a boat to carry on his
work.
4400. By Mr. Benneit ; Would you have the restrictions on licenses to boats removed ? Yes.
4401. By Mr. Douglas-. Would you prohibit persons putting fresh boats into the industry from
employing coloured divers ? Unquestionably. You could not start a new boat unless you got a white
diver or robbed somebody else of a diver; and then he would have to find another white diver.
4402. Under that scheme would you renew the existing divers’ licenses ? Yes.
4403. As long as the divers liked to renew them? Yes; unless the Government bought out all the
present owners.
4404. Would you permit those men to be engaged on any of the new boats which might go into the
industry? Unquestionably. I would not give a monoply to the Europeans at present engaged in the
industry. I believe there are a number of boats that are dummied. They belong to aliens, but the
declarations are made by Europeans.
4405. You know that there is only one diver at present licensed who is not a Japanese ? Yes. He is a
Malay. He is the man Mr. Saville Kent had to take.
4406. Would you say that all the Manila men and Malays and other coloured alien divers who have been
obtaining a living here for the last twenty years, but who have not taken out licenses this year —
possibly from ill health—should be precluded from getting licenses in the future ? If they held licenses
last year, I would renew them, but there are very few of them. Those who had licenses last year were
principally engaged in the beche-de-mer boats.
4407. There is a Rotumah man here who has just returned from the Aroe Islands, and who did not have
his license last year or the year before ? Then 1 would not admit him. If men are given certain con-
cessions by legislation, even though it may be hard in individual cases, you are perfectly justified in
refusing the concessions if they cannot comply with the conditions. You must draw the line somewhere.
When the Government draw the line at a certain point, they should sit tight,
4408. If your proposal were adopted, and as many boat licenses were issued as were applied for, whilst at
the same time you would restrict the issue of further divers’ licenses except to Europeans, would not
that create a dangerous monopoly for the Japanese divers ? It would give them a monopoly for a time
only. You cannot effect any change without pressing somewhere, and it would be better to effect a
drastic change, such as I have propounded. At present the Japanese have a monopoly of the diving. I
would like to read an extract from a letter written by Mr. James Clark to place on record his view on
this question.
4409. By the Chairman : Is that from a newspaper ? Yes; it is over the signature of Mr. James Clark,
and appeared in the Torres Strait Bilot in 1897. He was then on Thursday Island. He said: “I want
a white proprietorship—all the better if the owners are divers ?” That is the foundation on which I wish
to see the industry established.
4410. If a man were allowed a license for a boat, could you consistently refuse a license for a diver to
work that boat r I should say so unquestionably, because before he starts to build his boat he knows
that the licenses for divers are closed. There is no inconsistency about my position.
4411. Then you would restrict him to the divers at present licensed ? Let him look for a white diver.
4412. Would there not be any inconsistency in that ? Not necessarily. A Chinaman enters this country
subject to the condition that ho cannot employ aboriginal labour ; and in the same way a man entering
this industry would do so knowing the conditions under which he did so. An alien cannot hold a wine
and spirit license, and in many other ways he is restricted.
4413. By Mr. Douglas ; Have you discussed your proposition that the Government should take over the
boats with any of the other owners ? I have discussed it informally with three of the owners. I
discussed it with two of the principal men in Burns, Philp, and Co.’s employ, and they seemed favourable
to it.


4414. 'Ey Mr. Bennett-. Do you think the principal shellers would be favourable to it with an improved
market for shell ? I think some would and I think some would be averse to it, because they are doing
better than they would lead us to infer. ]
4415. This would be a favourable time for the Government to entertain such a proposal now that the
price of shell is low? Yes.
4416. By Mr. Douglas : According to your proposition, there would be no goodwill attached to the
business as a going concern ? Unquestionably not. You give the divers the right to dive for a year and
you give the owners boat licenses for a year—not for all time. The Ceylon fishery was closed for as
long as twenty-seven years at one period. A man entering an industry of this nature knows that it is
liable to denudation, and he knows that at any moment it may be necessary to close it down to protect it.
That warning has been given ever since the first Act was passed. It gave the Government power to
restrict the area, and to impose other restrictions. I might also mention that when the Government
assisted the sugar industry by erecting central mills the mills were allowed to work with Japanese and
other coloured labour. "When the Mossman Central Mill was erected with Government money, Japanese
were imported for it.
4417. By Mr. Bennett: Japanese were imported for it ? To work in the canefields in connection with
the mill.
4418. That is a different matter? They were not imported to work in the mill itself.
4419. The central mill had no control over the growers of cane or the labour they employed? The fact
of the Government building a central mill for a small farming community, who were employing coloured
labour, was as much working with coloured labour as it would be for the Government to take over the
boats with existing contracts until they could pass the boats over to white men. I do not advocate that
the Government should work with coloured labour for all time, but just to relieve the strain upon the
present owners and to introduce small ownership.
4420. By Mr. Douglas -. Do you think that an increase in the number of boats would be conducive to the
beds continuing to give a catch of shell that would be remunerative to white divers ? No ; but the point
I would like to impress is that the Government, under the system I have advanced, would reduce the
number of boats at once by fifty.
4421. According to the official figures, there are 112 pump boats licensed, and there are also many
beche-de-mer boats which may at any time be put into the pearl-shelling business, owing to the low price
of beche-de-mer; therefore some of the 165 divers now licensed would have to be employed on those
transferred boats—That would mean that the beds would be worked to a greater extent during the next
year or two than they have been during the past year or two —and the catch of shell is likely to decline
again unless the beds are going to give a better yield than is anticipated—Is that going to assist the
introduction of white divers? No.
4422. Would it not be better to say that no fresh boats should be put into the industry unless they
employed white divers, allowing the 164 divers at present licensed to work on any boat that is licensed now,
but not go into any new boats ? There are 165 divers at present. That allows for fifty-three more boats
to come in, so that your ease does not apply.
4423. But, if fresh boats are going to be built, they will probably command divers where older boats will
have to be put on one side ? That is possible. Let them be put aside. I am in that position. I have a
beche-de-mer boat that I shall have to put into the pearl-shell industry next year unless she does better
than she is doing this year.
4424. Your proposition will not tend to reduce the number of boats that are worked by coloured divers,
because there are 165 alien divers as against 112 pump boats ? But there would be no likelihood of a
man building a boat, unless he was prepared to work with a white diver.
4425. But new boats are building all the time ? Because there has been no restriction. We all know
that at an early date the Japanese will have us more by the throat than they have at present; and no
one will launch into new boats unless he is prepared to go into the industry with white divers, which is
not at all likely at present. In my opinion, there will be no increase in the number of boats.
4426. But a new boat will generally command a new diver, whereas a boat that has been in the industry
for ten or fifteen years will not ? It would be a gain to have your old boats wiped out and new ones
built.
4427. By Mr. Bennett-. Would it be a good thing fora man in the industry? Yes; if you are going to
put in white divers. I have two boats to which I am prepared to put a firestick if the Government will
restrict the number of licenses. One of them, the “ Grace Darling,” is a boat of 10 tons. I am now
getting £3 a month for her. If I could not get a license for her I would be willing to build a new boat
to take her place.
4428. Was the influence of the Japanese felt in 1895 ? Yes. The Japanese were offering big prices for
the boats, and a man wanting a boat had either to give that price or stand aside.
4429. If white divers were working in all the boats under present conditions, would that have the effect
of restoring the industry to its former prosperity ? No ; because there are too many boats.
4430. By Mr. Douglas: If, in addition to the 165 alien divers already licensed, you also license those who
held licenses last year but did not renew them this year, and make no provision for reducing the number
of licenses, how long do you think it will be before all those licenses cease to exist ? I would put a
discretionary power in the hands of the Minister to deal with that matter, and in ten years, or five years,
terminate all those licenses.
4431.. Do you think that vested interests should be studied in connection with any regulations that might
be made ? Any legislative body that studies vested interests against principles invariably makes a
mistake. You can scarcely pass any legislation which does not touch some vested interest. The big
squatter in Southern Queensland had to go down in favour of the small farmer; so I say the big pearl-
sheller should give place to the small man.
4432. By Mr. Bennett: Have you ever been actively engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? Not
outside; but I could open the eyes of the Commission as to the earnings of some of the men engaged in
that industrv.
4433. By Mr. Douglas -. You have several boats engaged in the industry ? Yes.
4434. Do you know’ their methods of working and their earnings ? Yes.
4435. You can give us an idea of what Japanese make out of the beche-de-mer ? Yes. I had two men
who made over £1,400 between them in two years.

(Thursday Island.)
TUESDAY, 1G JJjNE, 1908.
Present :
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Mr. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
Ernest “Warner Cleveland, Pearl Sheller and Master Mariner, examined:
4436. By the Chairman : What are you ? A pearl-sheller at the present time.
4437. But you have some professional calling ? lam a master mariner.
. 4438. How long have you been at Thursday Island ? Nearly nine years.
S. 4439. How many boats have you in the industry ? Fourteen pump boats.
4440. Are they registered in Queensland ? Yes.
4441. How many boats are at present engaged in the industry ? I could not tell from memory.
4442. Well, approximately ? About 108 are working with the pump at the present time.
4443. What is the present condition of the pearling-grounds with respect to the available supply of
shell ? The supply is not bad now; it is better than it was a few years ago.
4444. The beds are not depleted ? Not to any great extent.
4445. Which grounds are the most prolific ? What we term the Old Ground.
4446. Can you assign any reason for the depletion of some beds and the continued production of others ?
It was over-fishing that depleted the beds.
4447. What areas have been over-fished ? The Old Ground.
4448. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now engaged in the industry
profitably employed ? Yes.
4449. Without further depletion of the beds ? Yes.
4450. Do you consider the number of vessels now engaged in the industry should be limited ? In a way
I do. Ido not know how many boats we have in the beche-de-mer fishery which are at liberty at anytime
to come into the shelling business. The same Act covers b ith industries.
4451. Are the present number of boats sufficient for the condition of the beds? I think so; though the
beds are no doubt recovering at the present time.
4452. But, in your opinion, the present number of boats should not be increased ? No.
4453. By Mr, Bennett-. Do you allow for the number of boats engaged in the beche-de-mer fishery which
may be brought back into the pearling industry? Yes.
4454. By the Chairman : What would be the probable effect of the periodical closing of beds, with a view
to restoring and maintaining the supply of pearl-shell ? Ido not think that is necessary, except in
certain parts. The closing of the Darnley Island grounds would be a very good thing.
4455. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell? I prefer the 6-inch limit.
4456. For what reason ? Because a 6-inch shell, at the very least, is 50 per cent, heavier than a 5-inch
shell; but, considering the small number of “ pairs” picked up now, Ido not think that is a matter worth
worrying about.
4457. Should any restriction be placed on the size of vessels employed in the pearl-shell industry ? Ido
not think that is necessary.
4458. What is your opinion about the effect of a floating station working with and controlling fleets of
diving vessels ? I think that if competition becomes keener, it will be necessary to go afloat in order to
keep your fleet together and constantly at work.
4459. What effect has a floating station on the beds ? It had a tendency on the Old Ground to deplete
the beds, because the boats were continually at work on the ground.
4460. By Mr. Douglas-. Would it not be desirable to limit the tonnage of vessels so as to prevent the
employment of floating stations ? If a restriction is put on the number of boats, I do not think it is
necessary to limit the tonnage.
4461. By the Chairman : What is the minimum size necessary for efficiently working pump boats, and
having in view the comfort and safety of the crew? I consider that between 18 and 19 tons is the best
class of boat we can possibly get at the present time, and that is the size I have always advocated.
4462. By Mr. Bennett-. You mean 18 or 19 tons gross ? Yes.
4463. By the Chairman-. I suppose you base that opinion on the fact that an 18-ton boat can go wherever
a 15-ton boat will go ? Yes.
4464. Have you engaged in any experiments in the cultivation of the pearl-oyster ? No.
4465. Have you any knowledge of any experiments made in that direction ? Yes.
4466. By Mr. Douglas : Have the pearling beds shown any marked improvement during the last year or
two ? Yery much so.
4467. Is that attributable to the withdrawal of a large number of boats from working on the grounds ?
Undoubtedly.
4468. In what year did the floating stations cease working on the Old Grounds? In 1905, I think.
Some of the boats went away at the beginning of 1905 and others about October of that year.
4469. Have you worked with the floating-station system ? No. We work from the shore.
4470. Do you think that incessant fishing of the beds under the floating-station system had a tendency to
take the shell away from the grounds too quickly ? Undoubtedly. The floating-station system depleted
the Old Ground, as the boats were continually working there.
4471. Is that the reason Clark and Co.’s fleets left here for Dutch waters ? That, I suppose, combined
with the bigger profits they expected over there.
4472. Did you have any difficulty in obtaining labour for the boats at that time ? No greater difficulty
than there is in obtaining it now.
4473. You had to comply with the conditions laid down by the Commonwealth Government ? Yes.
4474. But all reasonable applications were granted ? Yes.
4475. By Mr. Bennett : Do you think the conditions imposed too severe ? No. One condition was that
you had to enter into a bond of £lOO a head, irrespective of the number of men you got; but that has
E. W.
Cleveland.
16 June, 1908.


been altered, and the maximum bond now is £l,OOO. Before that alteration was made, it was a hard
ob to get bondsmen for the different bonds which were needed.
4476. By Mr. Douglas-. Was the price of shell very low at that lime, and was there also a decrease in ■
the catch? There was a decreased catch. 1
4477. Do you remember when the catch declined ? Yes ; I was buying shell at the time for a New York
factory.
4478. You have represented a New York factory for some years ? Yes. lam still agent for the Union
Pearl Works in New York. I cannot give you the exact price of shell at that time, but I can look it up.
4479. Do you think the schooners worked under adverse conditions generally as compared with the shore
system boats ? The shore system was better for the diver.
4480. The diver worked under such conditions that he got more shell ? Yes. He had more incentive to
work than under the schooner system.
4481. Is the expense of working with a schooner very much greater than working from the shore? I
think so, taking things all round.
4482. Aud in order to make the floating station system remunerative, you would require to get more
shell than when working from the shore ? They thought that the amount of pearls would clear the
additional expense.
4483. Working on the shore system, the owner gets no pearls ? No pearls.
4484. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you consider the pearls a very important factor in the income? No. It
has been my contention all along that to give the divers the pearls is a big incentive to them to work and
get more shell.
4485. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think divers are inclined to pick up shell below the 5-inch limit just for
the sake of getting pearls ? Ido not think so.
4486. Seeing that the 5-inch limit has been so long in existence, do you think that, if the 6-inch limit
were reverted to, divers would continue to pickup shell between 5 inches and 6 inches ? No; but I
think it would be very hard on them now to alter the limit. They have got used to the 5-inch limit, and
they pick up so little of it that it is not worth while considering the matter.
4487. By Mr. Bennett: Seeing that there is such a difference in weight between the 5-inch and 6-inch
shell, is it profitable to the diver to pick up 5-inch shell ? No; that is the reason they are not
touching it.
4488. Would it not be possible for the boat-owners'to discourage the picking up of 5-inch shell without
any legislative enactment ? Under the present system we discourage divers from picking up small shell,
as we pay them by weight.
4489. Do you think it would have any effect if owners were to pay divers at so much per 100 shell
stipulating that each shell should not be under a certain weight ? Ido not think that would act as well
as the system we are working under at the present time. The present conditions are the best we have
had.
4490. Do you know that the system of paying the diver at so much per 100 shell obtained at one time ?
Yes. On the Darnley boats some of the owners were paying on that system.
4491. By Mr. Douglas : You think a limitation in the number of licenses would be a sufficient
protection for the beds without closing them periodically ? Quite sufficient.
4492. You have been connected with the Tahiti fishery ? Yes. The conditions there are totally
different. The shell is in a lagoon, and the natives work it with swimming diving only. There are no
dresses allowed to be used.
4493. By Mr Bennett: What is the depth ? Much less than here—from 10 to 13 fathoms.
4494. By Mr. Douglas -. Do they close the beds at certain times ? They divide the lagoons into sections,
which they work at different periods. One bed is worked for one year, and then rested for five years.
But the area is so small that they could not do otherwise. If they worked anywhere they liked they
would deplete the beds in no time.
4495. By the Chairman -. Those remarks also apply to Manahiki and Suwarrow ? Exactly.
4496. So far as you know, are the habits of the black-lip shell of Eastern Polynesia identical with the
pearl-shell of Torres Strait ? I think so. The shell of the Gambler Group is similar in size to our silver-
lip shell. Our black-lip is miniature compared with the black-lip shell of Tahiti.
4497. Have you heard anything as to the success which attended Mr. Savillo Kent’s experiment in
transferring shell from Torres Strait to Manahiki and Suwarrow ? No.
4498. By Mr. Douglas : You suggested the closure of the deep-water area at Darnley ? Yes. In my
opinion that is the breeding ground for the Old Ground shell. I think the spat comes from the Darnley
deep-water shell.
4499. Would it be advisable to close Endeavour Strait and all the narrow passages around here, which in
the early days were said to be very prolific ? I think it would have very little effect.
4500. Is that because the current will not allow the spat to lodge readily ? I think the breeding ground
of Endeavour. Strait is round Mount Adolphus, and only a portion ot the spat stays there. The tide
running through carries the rest of it on.
4501. By Mr. Bennett-. Would you be favourable to the idea of closing Mount Adolphus Channel as
well as the waters immediately in the group ? Yes. To close the waters further down the east coast
would have the same effect, I dare say, because for nine months in the year the current is running this
.way, and is bound to carry spat.
4502. Having regard to the relative position of Darnley to the western straits, is it feasible that the spat
from Darnley should come here through the straits ? I think it would. Of course a great portion of it
would go toward Mabuiag and through those passages ; but I think a lot of it comes this way.
4503. You must remember that the Warrior Beef intervenes between Darnley and Mabuiag and the
Oman Beef ? I consider there is such an amount of spat coming through there that the tide must take
a portion of it through. On the weather side of Warrior Beef you get very little shell. The lee side is
where all the shell is. .
4504. Are you not aware that between Darnley Island and Warrior Beef there is a great patch of barren
ground ? i’es. I take it when the spat reaches there, it is not heavy enough to sink. It is carried all
over the Warrior Beef, and then the eddy at the back of Warrior Beef settles it there.

141
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DB-MER ROYAL COMMISSION.


4505. Tour idea is that the Warrior Eeef is a sort of distributing area for the rest of the straits ?
What spat does not settle there must po on further.
k 4506. Towards the Two Brothers, Mabuiag, and the Orman Eeef ? Tes. In my opinion the Darnley
I. ground is the breeding ground for most of the shell, and the Old Ground is the best feeding ground.
You notice how quickly the shell grows there.
4507. At any rate, whether the shell goes directly from Darnley to the Old Ground or not, still it is a
breeding ground for the Straits ? I think it is the principal breeding ground. Of course there are
other places where breeding may take place, but not to the same extent as at Darnley; the shell is so
thick there.
4508. The pearl-shell here is worked from year’s end to year’s end ? Tes.
4509. Do you think there should be a close season imposed for the whole fishery, and that it would have
any beneficial effect? Ido not think it is at all necessary at the present time.
4510. Why ? Because the beds are recuperating. You can tell by the number of shell that go to the
ton how they are recovering. In 1905 it used to be over 1,500 shell to the ton. At the present time,
when they are working all over the place, it is 1,050 shell to the ton.
4511. You consider that shows a very marked improvement ? I consider it is clear evidence that the
shell is improving. It decreased ; then it was 1,200 to the ton ; then it came down to 1,100; and at the
present time the average is 1,050 to the ton.
4512. Is that Old Ground shell ? Old Ground mixed shell. When they get 1,050 they reckon they have
a ton, and they are very seldom out.
4513. Have you any idea what proportion of the shell exported comes from the Old Ground, and what
proportion from the inshore beds ? The proportion of Old Ground shell should be 60 per cent, at the
very least.
4514. Leaving 40 per cent, to come from all the other beds, including Darnley? Yes; under the
present system. Under the schooner system it wmuld be 90 per cent, from the Old Ground.
4515. If the beds are now showing signs of recuperation under the reduced number of boats and the
present system of working, would it not be possible to hasten the restocking of beds by the closure of
some of the inshore beds ? Ido not think it is at all necessary. The beds are showing a remarkable
recovery, and under the present system the divers are not touching the young shell; and I think that in
a few years shell will be very plentiful.
4516. Provided the present conditions are maintained ? Tes.
4517. By Mr. Douglas : Does the weather afford any protection to the shelling beds ? The weather is a
great protection to the shell.
4518. The heavy blows prevent boats working on the grounds ? The Old Ground is protected undoubtedly
by the weather.
4519. What proportion of the year will the boats w r ork on the Old Ground, allowing for spells ? Last
year we got about three months altogether on the Old Ground. That was at the beginning and end of
the year. At the end of the year the weather was bad, and we were driven off in a very short time.
4520. What are the best seasons of the year for working? Prom February to the end of April is our
best time on the Old Ground. The weather conditions are most favourable then. Then another good
time is from November till the time the north-westers come on —generally in December.
4521. Have you any idea when the shell spats ? No.
4522. Except probably from official reports that you may have seen? My idea is that the shell spats
during the middle of the year.
4523. What reason have you for thinking that ? The grass and weeds are pretty high all over the
bottom at that time; and I have been told—l have never seen it myself—that the amount of spat at that
time is greater than at any other time in the year.
4524. By Mr. Bennett : That is at the present season of the year ? Tes.
4525. At this time of the year the beds are protected by the weather ? Tes.
4526. Does it not appear as if that were a natural protection almost specially designed for the spatting
of the fish ? Yes.
4527. The shell got from the Old Ground is the best ? Undoubtedly.
4528. How far out are they working on the Old Ground now from Badu ? Miles outside the sandbanks.
They work right out to the 15 fathoms contour, which is about 60 miles west of Badu.
4529. By the Chairman : Then they are working further than Proudfoot Shoal ? Yes. There seems to
no limit that way except the depth of the water. The water deepens out there. They do not seem to
care for the dee]) water out there at all.
4530. By Mr. Bennett x They could not work.by drifting over 15 fathoms? Not deeper than from 15
to 17 fathoms.
4531. Drifting work is necessary on the Old Ground? Yes. Tliq whole work is drifting. There is no
stationary w r ork there. Out west of the sandbanks they appear to get rheumatics very quickly.
4532. That indicates that the water is heavier ? Tes. Very often they get slight attacks of paralysis.
We have had several in this year from that cause.
4533. By the Chairman : The divers at present employed in the industry are chiefly Japanese ? Yes.
4534. Do you consider that is a desirable state of affairs? I consider the Japanese divers are the best
we could get for the work.
4535. Would it not bo desirable to make the industry more attractive and remunerative to induce men
of our own race to enter into it ? Tes ; it is all a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence.
4536. What would you suggest as the primary step to be taken to bring about such a consummation ? I
do not think white divers would put up with the conditions, or stand the work that has to be done here.
4537. If they could make sure of a larger remuneration, do you not think they could be induced to
undertake the work ? It would have to be a very large inducement.
4538. Men go to work in New Guinea, where the conditions are very precarious, and they also engage
in mining and timber-getting, w'hich entail considerable hardships ? Yes; but those occupations are all
above water.
4539. If the Government appointed a marine biologist, and, as a result of his labours, the productiveness
of the pearl-oyster was increased, and if a training school for divers was established, do you think the
industry would be attractive to white men ? Ido not think you would over get white men to put up
with the life they would have to live on the luggers.
E. W.
Cleveland.
16 June, 1908.


4540. By Mr. Bennett: Not on the best class of luggers ? No.
4541. By the Chairman : We have had evidence here that in the early days the industry was entirely
dependent upon white men ? Yes, but the conditions then were very different from the conditions of ,
the present day. ]
4542. Suppose for a moment that there were no Japanese divers available, and you knew that wealth lay
at the bottom of the sea, do you think white men could not ho induced to get it ? That is true as far as it
goes. When I came here first, there were one or two white divers working, but the conditions then
were very different. If shell became more plentiful than it is now, very likely they would come to pick it
up, but not under present conditions. I think it is absolutely certain that a white man would not put up
with the condition of life on the luggers.
4543. The very same arguments were used with respect to the working of the sugar industry by white
men, and it was thought at the time that labour in the canefields carried degradation with it, owing to the
fact that sugar-cane had been cultivated by what was regarded as slave labour—There is nothing of that
kind attaching to the pearl-shell industry ? No.
4544. Then you do not think that under the conditions I have mentioned —the appointment of a marine
biologist, and the establishment of a school to teach young men to dive—white men could be induced to
go into the industry P The teaching of men to dive is not of much account. A man must have experience
in the industry before he can become successful as a diver. We do not put a man in charge of a boat
until he has been diving at least three years. For three years he has to “ trv diving,” as we call it.
4545. Do you mean to tell me that an intelligent white man could not become familiar with thp details of
the work in a short time? In time he could, no doubt. But, owing to the conditions they are working
under at the present time, they have to scratch round all over the country, and a man has to know where
the shell is, when it is dirty water, and when it is a favourable time to dive, otherwise he is left behind
in the race.
4546. If the Government offered a bonus of so much a ton on shell raised by white labour, would not
that be an inducement ? If the bonus were sufficient, it might.
4547. What would you consider a sufficient bonus ? It is very hard to say. If we knew what a white
man could catch, we could very easily fix the amount of the bonus.
4548. We have evidence that they caught as much as a coloured man when there was a large supply of
shell? That was when a man had only to go out for four or five weeks and pick up a ton of shell; but
at the present time a man has to know where he can get shell, and he has to work systematically in order
to get it.
4549. Supposing the price of shell was £l5O per ton, what bonus would be sufficient to make the
industry attractive to white men ? AVith a 3-ton catch, the bonus would have to be £5O per ton at the
very least, in order that the white men might earn a fair average wage.
4550. From what you know of New Zealand, do you not think there are plenty of young fellows there
accustomed to a seafaring life who could be induced to go into the industry under the conditions I have
mentioned ? I dare say there are. I dare say there are plenty in Australia.
4551. Do you think the industry could be made attractive and remunerative to white men under those
conditions ? I think so in time, if the thing was allowed to work its own cure. If shell goes on increasing
at the rate it is doing at the present time, in a few years it will be more plentiful.
4552. The proposed change could not be made when the industry was more prostrated than it is at the
present time? It is about as low as it could be, I think.
4553. It would be unfair to the Japanese to make a sudden change? Yes.
4554. Is there anything further you car. suggest? I would suggest that in case any boat other'than
the boats employed here now wished to work in the pearl-shelling industry, it should be made a
condition that the owner should employ white divers. That wmuld keep the present number of boats in the
industry, and any fresh boats introduced would have to employ white divers.
4555. You approve of the services of a biologist being secured? I think it would be a good thing from
a scientific point of view.
4556. Do you also approve of a school for teaching diving—a vessel with diving gear on board ? That,
i thick, will come about of itself. If there is anything in the work, a young fellow will soon learn to dive.
1557. By Mr. Bennett: Y r ou consider that the essential condition to make the industry attractive to
white men is an increased supply of shell? A 7 es; when there is an increased supply of shell, other
boats will bo induced to go into the industry, and all new boats coming in will have to carry wdiite
divers. ...
4558. Bf Mr. Douglas: AYould you grant any more licenses to aliens than those which are in existence
at th ■ present time? The better way would be to make the diver’s license go with the boat license. If
you restrict the divers’ licenses to the men who at present hold those licenses, we shall be cornered before
the year is out, as it would be putting a premium on divers.
4559. It would create a monopoly ? Yes.
4560. By the Chairman : Do you think that before a person is licensed as a diver he should have a
medical certificate as to his physical fitness? Ido not think so at all.
4')61. Do you not think it would be desirable for your own protection, in view of the AVorkers’
Compensation Act ? Ido not know. If a man goes diving, he goes with his eyes open.
By Mr. Bennett: AYould you hold the same opinion if the old system of making advances to
divers were reverted to ? I have always been against advances in any form. I had a diver working for
me who has been diving here for the last fifteen years, but I do not think he would pass a medical
examination. • , r T
4563. AYhat is the average working life of a diver —I mean the time when he can do his best work ? I
should say six, seven, or eight years not more than that. ■ , ,
4564. But there are exceptional cases, such as the one you have just mentioned ? Yes; but after that
a man becomes stale, and has not the same energy. . . , ,
4565 By the Chairman : Is he rendered unfit, after seven or eight years spent in diving, to work at any
other calling ? Ido not think so—that is, light work. Of course, a man who has once been “ pinched,”
or partially paralysed, is practically unfit for anything else.
4566 B y Mr Doughs • According to official repoi'ts, the vessels at present licensed m the pearl-shell and
beche-de-mer industries number 186—Under your suggestion, those boats would have the right to employ

alien divers, and no more boats would be licensed unless carrying white divers ? That number is up to
the limit stated in the resolution passed by the Federal Senate in September, 1905.
4567. Would you advocate that the boats at present licensed should have the right to employ alien divers
•for all time ? The thing would gradually work its own cure.
4568. How would that be the case i£ the diver’s license went with the boat license ? All new boats coming
in would have to employ white divers.
4569. By Mr. Bennett : Ido not understand what you mean by the diver’s license going with the boat
license ? If you restrict divers’ licenses to the men who at present hold licenses, the number would be
gradually reduced by those who go home and those who die. This year there have been six deaths at
Da.rnlcy, and about twelve men have gone home. At the present time, if we were short of a diver, we
could not get one to supply his place. If a diver is sick, we have to put a member of the crew in his
place.
4570. By Mr. Douglas : How many of your men have gone home ? Three; and they have taken no
papers. If they come back, they will have to come as indented men.
4571. By Mr. Bennett-. You mean that a boat license should enable the owner of the boat to employ
any man as a diver on that boat ? Yes ; that would do away with the annual licenses. If that is not
done, when we are short of divers, there will be a scramble for them, and that means advances.
4572. By Mr. Douglas-. Your proposal would practically be a concession to present owners—Would you
state a time when that concession should cease ? Put a ten years’ limit on it, if you wish, and by that
time you could find out whether the industry w r as going to be a success with white men.
4573. Would you have a sliding scale for ten years ? That would simply result in a monopoly of licenses
and a scramble for divers.
4574. But a slidingseale by which a certain number of boats would drop out of that concession every year
would give the white diver a better chance, and it would not inflict much hardship on the present owners?
At the present rate of increase of shell, I think anybody who wanted to go into the business, and would
employ white men, should come in ; and, if they could make a success of it, I think everybody else can
on the same lines ; but it is only an experiment.
4575. By the Chairman-. If the Government passed an Act requiring the employment of coloured labour
to come to an end in five years, what would be the effect? We would have nothing to fall back upon,
and the industry would collapse. We have to compete in the open market. If we could sell our shell to
the Government of Australia, it would be all right; but we have to compete in London with shell from
all parts of the world.
4576. By Mr. Douglas: Does the price of shell fluctuate according to the demand ? There is no doubt
about that.
4577. You represent a firm of buyers who work the shell up ? Yes, factory-owners.
4578. Is there a buying limit ? When the season is good, and they have plenty of work—and it depends
upon fashion wholly and solely—they will buy, and the prices will increase. But during the last two
years the quantity I have sent to New York has been reduced from 100 tons to about 13 tons.
4579. Is that because the fashion has changed ? Yes, and there is no demand for it.
4580. Do you know what percentage of pearl-shell is made into buttons ? I should say 85 to 90 per
cent.
4581. Do you speak with knowledge ? Yes. My people in New York tell me that America takes at the
very least 45 per cent, of the shell sold on the London market; but latterly they have been off the
market altogether.
4582. By Mr. Bennett: How long is it since you sent 100 tons per annum? The year before the big
prices. The highest I paid was £195 a ton.
4583. That was in 1903 ? I think so.
4584. By Mr. Douglas: Have your people ever considered whether they could work up pearl-shell
profitably in Australia ? No. They thought of starting in Japan, but the labour conditions were so
unsettled that they did not attempt to put up a factory. Here, they say, the labour conditions totally
debar them.
4585. Would a bonus assist the industry? I dare say it would, if it were made large enough; but they
tell me that in New York, on a certain class of buttons, they do not make 1 per cent, per gross, and
under a certain size they cannot make a profit at all. They will not take under a certain size in the
factory. They simply give them out.
4586. Do the manufacturers make contracts with the consumers ? Yes; with the clothing factories.
The pearl button seems to be out of fashion altogether lately.
4587. Is there any other shell that comes into severe competition with the pearl-shell ? Yes; the
Mississippi shell.
4588. That is the sweet-water mussel ? Yes.
4589. But it is only used for small, inferior buttons, just like the trochas ? Yes,
4590. In what year did you start buying for the Union Pearl Works ? 1900.
4591. Did they consider the Torres Strait shell was the best that the world could produce then ? They
say that Manila is 5 per cent, harder than Torres Strait shell; but the gold lip in the Manila shell goes
against it.
4592. By Mr. Bennett: There is a large percentage of gold-lip in the Manila shell ? Yes. When the
manufacturer in New York is ordering any article in the pearl-shell line, he invariably stipulates for
Manila shell; but he only gets a small percentage of it. The waste in the gold-lip shell is so great that
it is not as valuable as ours, although they say it is 5 per cent, harder.
4593. Have you any idea of the output of Manila shell}? No ; but I believe it has increased wonderfully
lately.
4594. By the Chairman: Do they use the black-lip shell of Tahiti for buttons ? Yes ; a good quantity
of it is used for that purpose.
4595. Do you consider the present system of basing the amount of license fee on the tonnage of vessels
is satisfactory ? I certainly do not.
4596. What would you suggest ? I should suggest that a uniform fee be paid for all pump boats
regardless of tonnage, because a big boat can catch no more shell than a small one. It is only a matter
of comfort for the diver and crew.

4597. By Mr. Bennett-. And of the efficiency of the vessel in more exposed waters ? Yes.
4598. By the Chairman: Is the present system of issuing licenses to divers or persons in charge
satisfactory ? The system that I would suggest is the one I spoke of just now, making the diver’s (
license follow the boat license. 1
4599. By Mr. Douglas: AVould you have all licenses issued from the one office? I think it would be
advisable to have all issued from the one office, instead of the present system.
4600. By the Chairman: Do you think it would be an improvement to have them all issued by the
Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries ? Yes.
4601. By Mr. Bennett: Do you consider a pearl-buyer’s license necessary for the protection of owners ?
It is no protection as far as the license is concerned; but at the present time I should say that only
Europeans should be licensed to buy pearls, and that a twelve months’ residential qualification should be
necessary. Last year, or the year before, three buyers came here who paid no income tax. I suppose
that among them they bought over £5,000 worth of pearls, and the country got no benefit from that,
except the £25 charged for their licenses.
4602. By Mr. Douglas: Can you give any idea of the total value of pearls exported from Thursday
Island ? I think a fair valuation at the present time would be £5O or £6O per annum for a pump boat.
4603. Pearls are very low in value just now ? They are practically of no value.
4604. £5O or £6O a boat would mean £5,000 or £6,000 a year ? That is year in and year out.
4605. AVould you not put down the average at more than £5,000 a year? That has been taken as the average
for a number of years. Of course one year it may be more. Under the schooner system they could tell
you exactly what they got.
4606. Did they get all their pearls ? Allowing a certain amount for losses.
4607. Can you give us any idea of the average earnings of your divers ? For a period of three years and
five months the gross catch for my boats was 178 tons 3 cwt. for twelve boats. That is 4 tons 6 cwt.
2 qr. per boat per annum. That is a bigger average than most of the boats get, because these were all
brand-new boats—new pumps, gear, and everything else—and they commanded better men than most of
the boats.
4608. On that catch, what do you estimate a diver would earn ? Mr. Hayne and I worked it out on a
4£ ton basis.
4609. Were those the figures handed in by Mr. Hayne yesterday ? Yes.
4610. By Mr. Douglas : Can you hand in the figures you have got there now ? It is hardjy fair to put
them in, because this was a big catch. There are very few boats that have had such a large catch. I can
give you the average cost of each boat for last year.
4611. By Mr. Bennett: The working expenses are irrespective of catch? Yes. They are taken from
the books themselves.
4612. By Mr. Douglas: Do you allow anything for insurance or depreciation ? No ; nor interest on
capital.
4613. That is for a fleet of new vessels ? Yes. The whole of them are new. The working account of
the twelve boats for gear and upkeep is £7,689 17s. lid. for the year.
4614. By Mr. Bennett: What is the rate of insurance now ? Four per cent, for total loss.
4615. By Mr. Douglas: Is there anything else you can suggest? No ; I think that is about all.
4616. Can you suggest anything about cultivation ? No ; that is a thing I have never gone into at all.
4617. Do you think the Government would be justified in spending some money on cultivation for the
benefit of the industry ? I think we ought to know all that science can teach us.
4618. It might overcome the difficulty about divers a good deal ? I doubt it; still it might.
4619. Still it would be beneficial to the industry? I have not much faith in it; but there may be
something in it. lam not a scientist.
4620. By the Chairman : Is there anything else ? There is one provision in the Act which gives the
inspector summary power to remove anybody from a boat. That is an absurd provision, because a boat
might be out on the Old Ground, and an inspector might take the diver and tender out of her and leave
the boat lying there. That has never been done in my time, but they tell me that it has been enforced
here. Ido not think it was ever intended to pass such a drastic provision, and I certainly think it should
be repealed.
Alexander Schachtsciiabel, Marine Diver, examined:
4621. By the Chairman : What is your calling? I have been out here lately with John Andersen.
4622. Do you call yourself a diver ? 1 do.
4623. By Mr. Bennett: Have you been down in the dress ? Yes, often. ,
4624. By the Chairman : Where were you employed last? Out here by John Andersen. 1
4625. How long have you been diving altogether? I was two years at bridge and harbour diving at
Copenhagen.
4626. What depth did you have to go down at Copenhagen? From three to five fathoms ; but that is
immaterial.
4627. How long have you been diving in the pearl-shelling industry? I have never been shelling. I
have been down looking for anchors.
4628. Where have you been wrecking? I was out with John Andersen looking for lost anchors.
4629. AVhat depth did you go down ? Seven or 8 fathoms, I suppose.
4630. On the Barrier Keef ? No; just outside Prince of Wales Island.
4631. How many months’ experience have you had in diving for anchors ? Six or seven weeks.
4632. Is that all the experience you have had in deep diving ? Yes.
4633. 1 understand you have applied for a license as a diver for pearl-shell ? Yes.
4634. To whom did you apply ? I applied at the Shipping Office.
4635. The Shipping Office? The office at the corner.
4636. That is to the Sub-Collector of Customs ? Yes.
4637. AVhat did he tell you ? He asked me if I had had a license before. I said, “ No.” He said,
“ Well, I cannot issue one.”
4638. Did he assign any reason for not issuing you a license ? No.
4639. AVhat did vou intend to do if you had got a license ? I intended to stop here and get a lugger to
go shelling.

4640. Have you applied to any white employers for work? Yes, to Mr. Farquhar.
4041. What was his reply ? That I could got a boat at any time.
4042. Then you consider it a hardship that you cannot get a license ? Yes.
4043. Are you under the impression that because you could not get a license you are prohibited from
getting a livelihood? That is what I consider it amounts to.
4044. You think that if you could get a license you would get plenty of work as a pearl-shellor ? Yes.
4045. By Mr. Douglas : Are you looking for work as a diver ? Yes.
4046. And you have an opportunity of getting a boat if you can get a license ? Yes.
4647. By Mr. Bennett-. Would you get employment as a diver? Yes.
4048. By Mr. Douglas: Where do you come from ? From Georgetown and Almaden.
4040. Were you mining there ? Yes.
4050. By the Chairman : Have you found diving cause you any hardship ? None whatever.
4051. You were three years diving at Copenhagen ? A couple of years.
4052. Did you dive during cold weather? Yes.
4053. And it did not affect you injuriously in any way ? None whatever.
4654. Would you as soon do diving as any other work ? Yes.
4055. Are you a sailor? Yes ; I have been sailing for twelve years.
4050. Do you think the work of diving in Torres Strait is harder than the work of a fisherman in the
North Sea or the Baltic? No.
4057. Do you think it is a better life ? Yes.
4058. By Mr. Douglas: Have you worked on fishing boats in the Baltic ? No ; but I. have fished there
very often as a boy.
4059. Do you know the conditions under which the fishermen carry on their business? Yes.
William John Gkauam, Licensed Wctualler, examined:
4000. By the Chairman : What are you ? lam a licensed victualler.
4601. Are you also interested in the pearl-shell industry ? Just now lam not directly interested in the
pearl-shell industry, but I have half a dozen boats in the beche-de-mer fishery.
4602. You are interested in both the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer industries ? lu a small nay.
4063. As an employer ? As an employer and owner.
4604. How many boats have you got ? Six.
4065. Arc they pump boats? No; they are swimming boats.
4000. Are they registered in Queensland under the Merchant Shipping Act ? No. They are licensed at
Thursday Island under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act.
4007. Can you tell us how many boats are at present engaged in the pearl-shell industry ? I cannot
4608. Do you know whether the pearling-grounds are partially depleted ? I am of that opinion. The
general tendency of the reports received is that way.
4609. To what cause do you attribute that depletion? At present I think the beds are holding their own
—with the number of boats employed.
4070. Which grounds do you consider are in the best condition? The Old Ground and the Daruley
waters. The weather protects them naturally. The Old Ground seems to hold its own. When wo have
fine weather, the shellers seems to get a good haul of shell.
4671. Can you suggest any reason for the depletion of the beds? I cannot.
4672. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now engaged in the
industry profitably employed ? I do. I think at least 200 boats can be profitably employed.
4073. By Mr. Douglas: The official figures show’ that 180 boats are now licensed—Ll2 pump boats,
55 beche-de-mer boats, and 19 swimming diving boats ? I mean pump boats.
4674, By the Chairman: Have you any personal experience of the floating-station system ? Not to be
out with them, but I held a small interest in the Queensland Pearl-shell Company.
4075. You think the number of boals should not exceed 200 ? That is so.
4070. And that the present supply of shell is ample for that number? Yes.
4077. By Mr. Douglas: On what basis do you suggest that licenses should be issued to 200 boats, so
that no monopoly should be created—Do you think it would be a good thing to limit the number of diving
boats to 200?. If there was some scheme to protect the individual against a monopoly, but I have not
thought out a scheme. 1 claim to have engineered through several associations the following resolution,
which was published in “The Waterside Workers’Gazette” of 7th February, 1908: —
That, in view of the fact that no floating stations now exist in Torres Strait, the Government be asked to
amend the Pearl Shelling Act so that no vessel be licensed or be allowed to be engaged in the industry of over
25 tons, and that every vessel must bo a bund fide pearling vessel, with pump and gear, and that the Government
endeavour to obtain the co-operation of the other States to train ten of the sturdiest boys in their respective
reformatories every year as divers and tenders. Further, that the Government be asked to place on the Estimates
the sum of £5,000, or more, for the purpose of equipping six, eight, or ten luggers, to be manned by the white
youths or any other available white labour procurable, the said £5,000, or more, to be a loan under similar
conditions as granted to sugar-mills and meatworks.
That three prominent men, townsmen of experience in the shelling industry, be appointed a committee of
management, the local governing bodies becoming guarantors.
I mentioned this matter to Mr. Bamford, one of our Federal representatives, when he came here some time
ago, and I believe he referred to it in the House of Representatives. Mr. Milman, in his annual report,
suggests the establishment of a training school for divers. Four years ago I suggested that a training
school be established in connection with our State reformatories. This would be done at very little
expeme, as very little science in diving is required. All that is needed is a little pluck, or, as in the case
of Japanese, ignorance of risks. If only a small percentage of those boys from fifteen years of age
upwards took to diving and went into the industry, the labour in it would soon become white.
4078. At what age? From fourteen to sixteen years of age. There are some very big boys at twelve.
4679. Do yon think a boy of fourteen could be trained as a diver? I went with Captain Lake from
Cooktown in 1884 to fish from the Wellesley Islands. Our crew consisted of forty-one Chinamen and
five whites. Amongst them was the cook—a lad, I should think, of eighteen or nineteen. He was a
weakly-looking chap, and he is not a strong man even now. I lost sight of him until I came here
in 1893, when I found him a full-fledged diver. That is Jack Schluter.

4GBO. By the Chairman : But there is a vast difference between fourteen and eighteen years P But you
see lads of fourteen who may pass for twenty. If a chap like Schluter could go diving, I think anybody
else could. ,
4681. Should you not get more promising material among the young fellows here who are surrounded 1
by the environment of the sea than from a reformatory in Brisbane or Sydney? Perhaps so; but
the thing is to get the boys here. I am not following up this idea now, as I have had further
experience of the white divers who have been at it. They have been mostly Scandinavians. If I were
going into it financially, I would suggest that 50 or 100 Danes, Swedes, or Norwegians might be induced
to come here. If we could only induce the first ten to come, lam satisfied others would follow.
4682. By Mr. Bennett: Would you not try to get some British divers? Apparently they will not come
along. This is the finest pearling-ground in the world. I would go so far as to admit South Sea Islanders
as crews. They are the best sailors among the coloured men about here, and are preferable to the
Binghi and Strait Island boys. I would have a white diver, a white tender, and a South Sea Island
crew, letting the whites drift into the industry, if they will, as crew, and pass the South Sea Islanders
out. We have nice sites for homes on all the islands.
4683. Do you think the industry should have white crews as well as white divers and tenders ? lam
an extremist in that respect. I think the industry should either be white or be closed altogether,
because, as at present conducted, it has a tendency to land everybody in a muddle here. We are being
so undermined by the present individuals in the industry that, sooner or later, they will have the.
Island as well as the industry.
4684. You consider the industry should be worked solely by white men? I would admit, ,at the start,
coloured boys as crew. Wo would not get white crews right off. Once we could instal the 'first ten
divers in ten luggers, I am satisfied men who are decrying the industry now would take' it up, as they
did the sugar industry when they found that it was to be a white industry.
4685. What wages would a white tender require ? Igo on the basis of those engaged in the industry
making a profit of from 33-J- to 50 per cent, in good times.
4680. What wages do you think he should get? That remains to be worked out. It might be worked
on the co-operative principle. There is a suggestion that the Government should buy all the boats. If
they did that, they might put in a crew on the principle of a “ lay ”or on the share principle. The
diver would perhaps get two-tenths or four-tenths, and a tender so much. They would not have a wage,
and they would have to put their shoulder to the wheel and make their own wage.
4687. By the Chairman: If the Government established a school for divers and appointed a marine
biologist, do you think the industry could be made remunerative and attractive to the white man ? I do.
It depends on the price of shell, which is a luxury.
4688. Could you suggest some other means for making the industry more attractive, or do you consider
those are the two primary steps to be taken ? I do.
4689. Would you suggest a bonus for a time, to get over the initial difficulty ? I am inclined to think
that, with everything favourable, no bonus will be necessary.
4690. If the conditions I have mentioned were carried out it would not be necessary to have a bonus ?
Ido not think any great amount would be required by way of a bonus. lam quite satisfied that the
Clark combine, being well managed, have made fancy profits, and left room for very good wages for
Europeans.
4691. Without in any way going in for repudiation, can you suggest any means by which a gradual
change could be brought about ? I would sooner suffer from the jump than suffer gradually. At the
end of January or in the middle of February, 1909, I would feel like closing the whole of the grounds
entirely against aliens. I would sooner sink or swim at once than gradually, as is happening now.
4692. Is that the general opinion here ? I feel that drastic steps have to be taken sooner or later.
Everybody is going down.
4693. Is that opinion yours alone ? Barring those who are standing on velvet.
4694. Can you suggest any way of bringing about a gradual change ? No doubt it would be most
reasonable to make a gradual change. I have never given that a thought, as I am an extremist. I feel
we are being undermined, and I would sooner start afresh than continue sinking, as the Island is doing
now. Last year the imports from foreign parts were larger than in any previous year.
4695. If the Government, by proclamation, said that Japanese divers must go out of the industry within
a certain number of years, would that have the desired effect ? I could not say, because I am an
extremist. I feel like doing it now instead of going on as we are doing.
4696. By Mr. Bennett: You would hardly expect your ideas to be given practical effect to ? I do not
expect that.
4697. You believe in the principle of asking for more than you expect to receive ? No. I am so
satisfied that we are so much assailed from every point that I would sooner rub them out and start afresh.
Everybody is on the brink of not being able to pay up. That is the stage wo have reached. That is my
candid opinion of Thursday Island at this moment.
4698. Do you attribute that to the employment of coloured labour ? These men are running the industry
to their own advantage.
4699. Who? The aliens —the Jap in particular. He is running the industry to the very best advantage
to himself. The sooner it is ended the bettor. lam willing to give my six boats away now. At the
end of the year you are probably not in credit. You may not have made enough to pay for wear
and tear.
4700. Do you consider the over-fishing of the beds is due to the employment of aliens ? Oh, no.
4701. By the Chairman : I suppose you realise that in making any change in the direction you suggest
somebody must suffer? I have a big family, but I would sooner make the change now. lam prepared
to suffer, and I would suffer heavily.
4702. Would it not be better for the change to take place gradually ? It would be better.
4703. By Mr. Douglas: But the success of the industry depends entirely upon the price of shell ? I
think so.
4704. If prices fell after white divers were working, would it not bring about the same stagnation as is
being experienced now with alien divers ? That often happens in other industries and occupations. There
are rises and falls. That is the fortune of war.

4705. But success depends entirely on the supply of shell and the price obtained for it? Only so far as
those actually employed in the industry are concerned. The present system is no use to the community.
When shell was selling at prices ranging from £2OO to £4OO a ton, my turnover was not as good as it
8. was the previous or the following year.
4706. When it was down to £lOO a ton ? The owners went away, but the crew did not get any more.
They only got £25 a ton, and they only had so much to spend. If white men got more money they
would have more to put into circulation, and they certainly would put it into circulation.
4707. But if it costs £l3O a ton to produce shell which onlv sells for £lOO a ton, the divers and crew
will get their wages just the same as if the price were high, provided the employers are financially
strong enough to pay them ? I think the owners have always made a profit. I think they are making
one now.
4708. Do you think the owners made heavy profits in the years 1904, 1905, and 1906, when there was a
heavy slump in the price of shell? They may not have made a profit in those years.
4709. You have no personal knowledge of their results when the price of shell was £4OO a ton or
when it was £l3O a ton ? I have a very good idea.
4710. Still, you have no knowledge of the figures ? No.
4711. You do not know in what years a profit was made, and in what years a loss was made ? Ido not
think losses were made in any year. In some years they doubled their capital.
4712. By the Chairman :Do you refer to one company or to the whole industry ? I mean the fleets
that went away.
4713. Clark and Co. ? Clark and Co., that being to all appearance the best-managed concern. I know
that they have made a profit of 33£ per cent. I have an assurance to that effect from an individual
member of the company. I think the nominal capital is £lO,OOO. Ido not know what is paid up. I
suggest that, as being the capital of tl Queensland Pearl-shell Company.
4714. That is one branch of the com t y? Yes.
4715. How many fleets were there ? Five or six.
4716. You think they would make an average profit of 33| per cent. ? Yes, year in and year out.
4717. By Mr. Bennett-. Did you make that profit in the Queensland Pearl-shell Company? No. We
had an apparent surplus of £1,600 lying in London. There was no dividend paid, but that was the year
I was offered a glimpse, and I took the gentleman’s word that they made per cent, profit.
4718. Who made this offer to you ? The owner of one of the fleets in Torres Strait.
4719. The owner of one of the Clark fleets? Yes.
4720. By Mr. Douglas: That was one year ? That particular year —I do not remember the year now—
the Queensland Pearl-shell Company declared no dividend. They had an apparent profit. There was
some doubt about the London market, and they decided not to carry it forward.
4721. Have the Queensland Pearl-shell Company declared any dividend of recent years ? I believe they
did, from hearsay, after I sold out.
4722. You have sold out ? I sold out the following year. I held my shares for two and a half years
They paid a£2 dividend on a paid-up capital of £6 per share. That was 33-J- per cent.
4723. Did you mean to suggest that the number of boats should be limited to 200? You raised a
fresh question. You said, if the demand got greater. No doubt in framing fresh legislation you would
provide for that. If the demand increases, 1 suppose you would leave room for some member of the
Government to increase the number. If there was occupation for more of our own race, I imagine the
Government would let in another fifty boats. lam in favour of closing the beds entirely for two
years against black and white, and allowing the shell to grow. The shell will naturally recuperate itself.
If you say it is to be white, it will be white then; and let the shell stop there in the meantime.
4724. By the Chairman : What is to become of companies in the meantime ? They have got a harvest of
shell anywhere—we have IN ature’s cultivation area in the Damley waters.
4725. By Mr. Bennett: Do you advocate closing the whole of the grounds ? I do.
4726. By the Chairman : Do you suggest any means which -will enable white men to take the place of
coloured divers ? I think the grounds will recuperate of themselves. The extreme step will have to be
taken sooner or later.
4727. By Mr. Douglas: Assuming that the industry was worked by white divers, and that the time came
when the pearling beds were exhausted, would you advocate a restriction in the number of licenses or
the closure of beds ? I think Nature and the weather protect the beds—that is, the weather protects and
Nature cultivates them. I believe the spat goes as far as the A roe Islands.
4728. You admit that pearl-shell is not one of the staple products of life, but that it is a luxury?
It is so, apparently, and pearls are, too.
4729. And, being a luxury, there is no standard price for it ? That is so.
4730. By Mr. Bennett : The price is regulated by the demand ? Yes. There are indications that the
shell areas at the Aroe Islands are becoming denuded, and that there will be a rise in the price of shell in
the near future. I think there is something in the London brokerage that I cannot favour. Ido not
think the shellers get an honest run for their money.
4731. By Mr. Douglas -. Do you think there is a ring among firms there ? I do. I think it would be a
good thing if the Government could arrange for sales on Thursday Island, so that we could sell our own
shell locally. The shell from Booby Island and Deliverance Island is the best shell in the market; it
tops the market every time.
4732. By the Chairman : Did not Mr. Clark make arrangements in London to provide against that sort
of thing? He thought he did. I think the firms there buy at one market and sell at the next.
4733. Do you know the reason why the Clark combine fleet left these waters for the Aroe Islands ?
Shelling is just like mining. A miner may be earning his £4 or £5 a week, but he has the rush fever
on him, and when he hears of a new field he leaves his work and follows the rush. So it was with the
Clarks. They had prospected that ground at Aroe Islands, and, believing that it was a good thing, they
removed their fleets there.
4734. Was there any difficulty in regard to the supply of labour at that time? No difficulty at all.
They were wrong in saying that there was any trouble in getting labour.
4735. By Mr. Douglas-. Were their fleets paying at the time they left ? I think so. Not, perhaps, in
that particular year, as it was a bad year for shelling, and shell was down in price.

4736. By the Chairman : You think they went to the Aroe Islands to secure greater returns ? I think
so. The system of working we have now is the best for the community. The floating-station system is
the best for the boat-owners, but it results in undue competition.
4737. Does the floating-station system tend to deplete the beds more than the shore-station system ? I
do not think so, as long as the number of licensed boats is limited. Whether they work from the shore
or from a schooner, they keep their hands at work ; they keep them to the grindstone.
4738. Should there be any restriction in the size of the vessels engaged in the industry? Yes.
4739. What maximum do you suggest ? Prom 20 to 25 tons. I think a uniform license fee should be
charged. An employer should not be taxed for giving his men a bigger boat.
4740. Is a vessel of that size sufficient to provide for the comfort of the crew? I think so. In these
waters they always get under the lee in bad weather.
4741. By Mr. Bennett'. You approve of a uniform license fee? I do.
4742. By the Chairman: Have you had any experience in the aultivation of the pearl oyster? No.
4743. Do you know of any experiments that have been made in that direction? Yes; through being on
board the schooner “Day Spring,” in Friday Island Passage, and having several chats with the man in
charge, Mr. Pace.
4744. By Mr. Bennett-. But you have had no experience in cultivation experiments? No; but I am
led to believe that shell matures in four or five years. That is the opinion expressed by Mr. Pace, the
expert employed by the Clark Company.
4745. By the Chairman: Do you consider that only one diver should be carried by each boat? Not
necessarily. I think if whites went out diving they would have to do dip and dip about, as divers do at
Darnley.
4746. Are you aware that pearl-dealers’ licenses are issued by the Police Magistrate? Yes.
4747. And that the Sub-Collector of Customs issues boat licenses and divers’licenses ? Yes.
4748. Do you think it would be better if all licenses in connection with the pearl-shell industry were
issued by one officer? Yes—by the Shipping Master.
4749. By Mr. Bennett: Would you be inclined to limit the number of licenses for swimming diving
boats as well as for pump boats ? So far as I can gather the beche-de-mer fishing goes on spasmodically.
4750. Would you be inclined to limit the number? I would not be inclined to limit the number
of swimming diving boats. I would not limit the employment of natives of Torres Strait.
4751. Most of the swimming diving boats are owned by Europeans, are they not? There are no
swimming diving boats engaged in pearling now. They are all beche-de-mer fishing.
4752. Have you ever been beche-de-mer fishing ? No.
4753. By Mr. Douglas: You suggest that the number of pump diving boats should be limited to 200?
Yes ; but I think the Minister or the officer administering the Act should have power to extend the
number, under certain circumstances, by twenty or twenty-five boats.
4754. You think 200 should be the minimum ? At present I think the ground would grow shell as fast
as 200 boats could gather it up.
4755. Working with white divers ? White divers and white tenders.
4756. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think the supply of shell would increase under those conditions? lam
inclined to think so.
4757. Have you any good ground for saying that ? Last year one boat got 12 tons of shell.
4758. At Darnley? I think so. Several boats averaged 8 tons.
4759. At Darnley? At Darnley. Nature protects the shell on the Old Ground. You cannot get shell
there in bad weather.
4760. Do you know what depth shellers have to dive for shell at Darnley ? Ido not believe they have
to go down over 25 fathoms.
4761. Would you be surprised if I told you I have seen a diver go down 37 fathoms ? I would believe
you, but I did not believe it before. Most of the white divers who have been engaged in the industry
have been foreigners—Swedes, Danes, &c.
4762. By Mr. Douglas: The official records show that since 1897 there has been a substantial decline in
the take of pearl-shell? There is no record to show whether the boats were continually employed during
the whole twelve months, or how many were out of commission, and so on.
4763. Whatever was the cause, the official records show that the total catch of shell has been steadily
declining ? Last year the catch increased.
4764. There has been a steady decline in the total annual catch for ten years, when the number of pump
boats engaged in the industry did not exceed 200—I would like you to bear that in mind in recom-
mending that the number of boats should not exceed 200 ? If you get white divers you will not get them
all at once. You will probably get twenty-five the first year, and so on, and the shell will be increasing
in quantity all the time.
4765. Will you not want a larger catch of shell or an increase in the price realised for shell in order to
make the work payable to white divers? I think there is something unexplained in the London dealings
in regard to the sales of shell. I just remember that Mr. Clark referred, towards the close of his evidence,
to the sale of liquor in Torres Strait. If the pearling-grounds were closed for two years entirely, that
would naturally result in closing the liquor question entirely, and it could be resurrected in the same way
as shelling. The State might take that over and regulate it entirely. If the Government made a profit,
it might be used to provide a bonus, at the same time that they might regulate the sale of liquor to
individuals. 1 admit the truth of what Mr. Clark said about blue, black, brown, and brindle getting
liquor a fact that he denounced in his evidence. He reckoned that the idle life degenerated the whites
h ere the pearls they get and the momentary excitement. That was before my time, but I admit it has
been so since. If a change is going to be made, that is one thing in which a change might be made.
Nationalise the liquor trade on Thursday Island with the introduction of white people. Close four of the
houses, and let the Government take over the other two.
4766. Do you think white divers are more inclined to consume liquor than the coloured divers ? Ido not
think so ; but there are so many other nationalities here.
4767. By Mr. Bennett: Have not the Government got control of the liquor trade ? I mean that they
should nationalise it on the Island.
4768 By Mr. Douglas: If the Government did that, would you suggest that they should not sell liquor
to coloured men at all? Yes. Whilst the Japanese are here I would except them.

47G9. By Mr. Bennett-. Would you approve of liquor being sold to white divers ? Certainly ; but you
might make a prohibition area of it.
“N 4770. Is not liquor as injurious to the white diver as to the coloured man? I think it is injurious to
° 8 - everybody. lam not a lover of it, although lam a licensed victualler.
4771. Bg Mr. Douglas-. Is there anything else you would like to say ? I would like to mention another
little matter —the dummying that goes on. lam not biassed. The system of indenting Japanese, instead
of letTng them come in free, is wrong. If the Government are going to permit the Japanese to come in,
they should come here of their own free will and make their terms here, and let the locality have a run
for its money out of their earnings in the industry. At present half the wages are paid in Japan and
never come here at all. That is not fair to this community.
4772. Are you sure of that? I have been assured of that by George Smith. I was led to believe a
few years ago that the Japanese Government insisted on their leaving so much for those who are
dependent upon them. When a Japanese sliver gets a good pearl ho always feels like sending one-half
of what he gets for it to his home. Then w r e have New Guinea boys coming here, and the Papuan
Government insist that all their money must be paid to them at Daru, which is only pampering a
couple of Now Guinea Government officials, who want to make a fancy return. Those boys earn their
money here, and, as New Guinea is a part of the Commonwealth, they should be paid here. If the
Commonwealth Government think they should be protected, there should be an officer here to see that
they get paid, and to see that they get full value for their money. Where they earn the money they
should be allowed to spend it. The present system is too much like slavery. Commercially, it is not
fair.
4773. If they spent their money here, they could take the goods back, the same as the mainland
aboriginals ? Yes.
4774. But they would not have as far to go to their homes as the mainland natives in the majority of cases ?
No. They have a very narrow market to buy in, and have no choice. They are kept at Dam until all
the money is left ashore. Something goes wrong with the lugger ; and so long as they have a £lO-note
the boat does not go up the Ply Biver.
4775. By the Chairman -. The principal object of the Commission is to devise some scheme by which the
industry can bo made white ? In addition to the resolution I engineered through the Waterside Workers’
Union, the Government were asked to place on the Estimates a sum of £5,000, or more if necessary,
for the purpose of providing six, eight, or ten boats, to be manned by white men, the money to be
advanced on similar terms to those obtaining in the case of advances for sugar-mills and meatworks.
4776. We understand there is a reluctance on the part of some people to come forward and give
evidence —will you try to induce them to do so? I think the beche-de-mer boats could be manned
by white labour. I know that white men will not go swimming diving; but I think the man in charge
should be white. There should at least be one white man in each boat.
4777. At the Southern ports it has always been a white man’s industry, with the assistance of natives?
I nnnlioned Scandinavians, as, next to the Japanese, they take most kindly to the diving whether it is
due to greater pluck or whether it is due to ignorance 1 do not know.
4778. They are inured to the hardships of a sea life? I suppose you have seen that three representa-
tives from 5,000 Scotch fishermen recently waited upon the Government of New South Wales to see
what chance there is of assisting those men to come and fish in New South Wales and start curing fish,
so that, apparently, British are offering too.
4779. Could not such men establish homes for themselves on some of the islands in Torres Strait? I
think so I can almost picture many homes around the islands.
4780. By Mr. Douglas : Like there used to be in the early days? Yes, There were little stations on
the islands when I came here in 1884.
4781. By Mr. Bennett-. Were they white people? Whites and Manila men; but there were no
Japanese.
4782. By the Chairman : Is there anything else you would like to allude to? Assuming that nothing
comes out of this Commission, I may say that I am not an extremist to the extent that I would forbid
the return of the Clark combine. Not that I have any actual proof, but lam satisfied there is something
—I cannot gather where it exists —but there is a system of selling birthrights here. If things continue
as they arc, I am not opposed to the return of the Clark combine from the Aroe Islands ; and I am
influenced by the fact that 1 feel there is something going on here that is not right —the question of
selling birthrights—in other words, dummying.
4783. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you think dummying is going on to any extent in the pearl-shell industry?
Without being able to verify my opinion. That is why I would sooner have the straight-out owner in the
James Clark combine than I would the dummying owner who exists now.
4784. You think that, in reality, the aliens own the boats? Yes; and that is why I would sooner see
the genuine owner in James Clark and Company. I have refused to have boats registered in my name
and receive a sum of money' every year in return.
4785. Have you had an offer of that kind made to you? Yes.
4780. And you refused it? I refused it, and I was told, “ All same other people.”
4787. What was the object ? I would rather not say'. It was within the last year.
Joseph Austin, Ex-Diver, examined :
4788. By the Chairman : What are you ? I used to be a sailor.
4789. How long have ymu been on Thursday Island ? I came in 1881.
1 4790. What have you been doing since you arrived ? I had a swimming-diving boat of my own, and I
’ had a little business in Thursday Island for a few years.
4791. Have you been engaged in getting pearl-shell and bcche-de-mer ever since 1881 ? Yes.
4792. How much of the time have you spent in pearl-she!ling ? Eourteen years at the very least.
4793. As a diver ? I was three years diving.
4794. Were you diving in deep water ? I have been down in 35 and 40 fathoms of water at Bobo, on
the New Guinea coast.
4795. How long did you remain below at that depth ? Not very long. Sometimes three-quarters of an
hour, sometimes half an hour.

4706. Did you suffer any illness ? No.
47.07. By Mr. Bennett-. Did you remain down at the bottom for three-quarters of an hour? Yes.
4795. In 35 fathoms ? Not exactly 35 fathoms, because, in some places, the bottom falls to 10 fathoms ;
but 30 fathoms is the general run.
4790. By the Chairman : What was the bottom like ? Rocky, shelly bottom, with sponges, grass, and so
on, on it.
4800. You say you remained below three-quarters of an hour? At the very least, half an hour.
4801. Did you continue at that work day after day ? Not all day. I would have a spell.
4802. How many days did you dive at that depth? I fished for two or three weeks, when I wont to
New Guinea and got water, and then went back again.
4803. Were you a sound, healthy man when yon commenced diving? Yes; and lam strong even now.
4804. By Mr. Douglas-. What is your age now? I will be seventy-six on the 10th October.
4805. By the Chairman : You know the life of a Drench fisherman off the coast of Brittany ? Yes.
4806. Is it a hard life ? It is a pretty hard life.
4807. Which is the harder life—fishing off the coast of Brittany or pearl-diving in Torres Strait ? Pearl-
diving is the harder life.
4808. Cold weather is experienced off the coast of Brittany ? Yes.
4809. Which would you prefer—fishing off the coast of Brittany or diving for pearl-shell ? Diving for
pearl-shell.
4810. Then diving is not unhealthy ? Everybody is not fit to dive, but nearly everybody can stand
fishing.
4811. From the experience you have had in the pearl-shell industry, do you think that pearl-shelling can
be carried on by white men ? Ido not think it can at the present time.
4812. Supposing there were no Japanese divers here, do you not think that white divers owning small
boats, or white divers paid according to the quantity of shell they raised, could make a living in the
industry ? I think so.
4813. Should not your own experience enable you to speak with some certainty ? You must make
allowance for the conditions of the industry, which are different now from what they were in former
ycais when pearl-shell was plentiful.
4814. How long would it take a young man who had been at sea to become a diver ? It would not take
any time. In a week or fortnight he would be as good as most of the men now working in the Strait.
4815. By Mr. Douglas : But he would not become experienced by diving for a week or two ? He would
be able to dive, but only by long working could he gain experience.
481 Q. By the Chairman : You have been twentv-seven years in Torres Strait? I landed in Melbourne
in 1872.'
4817. Did you, sailor-like, use to get on the spree and paint the town red now and again ? Certainly. I
did that, like all the rest.
4818. And yet you have reached the age of seventy-six years ? Yes, and lam healthy.
4819. By Mr. Bennett : You have said that you remained down for half or thre'e-quarters of an hour
in 35 or 40 fathoms of water —Do you moan that you took that time over a dive ? I cannot say exactly
what time 1 took, but many a time I stopped down more than half an hour.
4820. At the bottom ? Yes.
4821. By Mr. Dmglas: Does that include the time going down and coming up? I did not count the
time until I touched the bottom.
4822. Had you ever been diving before you came to Torres Strait? Yes. lam a man-o'-war’s man. In
France you have to learn diving in connection with your duties as a man-o’-war’s man.
4823. By Mr. Bennett : Did the doctor look at you and sound you before you went diving ? He did, and
every time wo came up.
4824. If a man had not a good chest and a good heart, he would not be allowed to dive ? No.
4825. By the Chairman : Do you think you could dive now ? lam sure I could go down, but how long I
could stay down I could not say.
4826. By Mr. Bennett-. Would you take a dip now if you thought there was something at the bottom
worth bringing up ? I think I could go down at Bobo now, but how long I could stop down I could
not say.
4827. By Mr. Douglas : Have you fished for beehe-de-mer ? Yes, for beche-de-mer and turtle-shell. I
never owned much of a boat.
4828. Did you have a station on any island ? No ; I never did work from any station on an island.
Arthur Thomas Sullivan, Manager for P. .1. Doyle, AYine and Spirit Merchant, examined:
4829. By the Chairman -. What are you? lam manager for Mr. P. J. Doyle, wine and spirit merchant.
4830. Have you any pearling vessels under your management ? Yes.
4831. Any engaged in the pearl-shell industry.? Yes.
4832. How many pearling vessels have you got ? One pump boat and three swimming boats.
4833. Are those vessels registered ? No.
4834. But they are licensed here ? Yes.
4835. By Mr. Bennett: Is not the pump boat registered ? No.
4836. By the Chairman: Have you had any practical experience in either the pearl-shell or the
beche-de-mer industry ? Very little beyond managing on shore as the shell comes in.
4837. From what vou know of the industry, can you tell us what is the present condition of the pearling-
grounds ? I can only speak from results. I have not been out to see any of the working.
4838. From the results you have seen, would you say the beds are -prolific or otherwise ? I should say
they are prolific. . .
4839. Which grounds are the most prolific ? Ot course, in saying that they are prolific, I mean under certain
conditions. We all know that the grounds have been scooped out a great deal, but are now recuperating
a little. Owing to the fleets going away, spat has had a chance to grow. That is my belief, but I have no
practical knowledge of the subject.
4810. Which fleets do you refer to ? The Clark combine fleets.

■ 4841. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels now engaged in the
industry profitably employed ? Yes.
. 4842. Do you think the present number should be increased or decreased ? Speaking from a sheller’s
point of view, I should say there are enough boats here now.
4843. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you think that, if some of the boats at present working in the beche-de-mer
industry were to engage in pearling, the beds would maintain their present state of productiveness ? 1
do not think so. There are a lot of boats working in the beche-de-mer fishery now which used to be
shelling.
4844. By the Chairman : From that we may infer that the grounds will not stand being worked by any
more boats ? They might stand a few more, but Ido not think they would stand many more. But, if
the price of shell were better, it might pay more boats to go into the industry.
4845. lam speaking of present conditions ? Under present conditions Ido not think the number could
be increased.
4846. To what number would you limit the boats ? Between 150 and 200.
4847. Do you consider that the periodical closure of beds would result in increasing and maintaining
the supply of pearl-shell ? I do.
4848. Which beds do you consider should be closed ? I would not like to give an opinion on that matter,
because I only know the beds from hearsay.
4849. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell? The present limit of 5
inches. That has been in force so long now that it would be very difficult to fall in with an alteration.
4850. Should any restriction bo placed on the size of vessels employed in the pearl-shell industry ? Yes.
4851. What should be the maximum size ? I should say between 25 and 30 tons.
4852. Have you had any experience in the working of the floating-station system ? Very little. I was
only a fortnight on a schooner.
4853. By Mr. Bennett: From the standpoint of a commercial man, what is your opinion of the effect of
the floating-station system on settlement on the Island ? From the commercial point of view, Ido not
think the floating stations are as advantageous to the Island as working from the shore.
4854. Why ? Because I consider that men will come to live on the Island, and there will be more money
spent here.
4855. You think the present system tends to promote settlement on the Island ? I think so.
4856. By the Chairman : What is the maximum size necessary for the efficient and comfortable working
'of pump diving boats ? Anything from 16 to 18 tons. Of course we have boats very much less than
that.
4867. Can you suggest any improvements which will increase the comfort and safety of the crew?
None whatever on the latest built vessels.
4858. You think they afford all the accommodation that can be obtained in the industry ? For the size
of the boats. Of course, bigger boats might be employed.
4859. By Mr. Douglas : In the past has the working of the shelling boats, with a schooner convoying a
large number of luggers, tended to over-fish the grounds ? I think it has.
4860. Do you think the Old Ground has been overworked in the past ? I think it has been slightly
overworked. I have never been out there; but that is my opinion. The beds are now recuperating to a
certain extent.
4861. With the schooner system the boats are able to keep on the ground ? Yes ; and there is no loss of
time in working. The system also saves trouble for the managers.
4862. Is the system desirable from the point of view of making the industry permanent ? I do not
think it is necessary cr desirable.
4863. In limiting the number of vessels to 150 or 200, would you include vessels at present working for
beche-de-mer? No.
4864. According to the official figures there are 180 vessels licensed as pump, swimming, and beche-de-
mer boats ? There is a probability that the majority of the boats now working beche-de-mer may come
back to the shelling, and I included them.
4865. By Mr. Bennett-. The number would not exceed 200? No. I do not pretend to have much
practical knowledge of the industry, but I speak from results.
4806. By Mr. Douglas-. You are working some boats at present in the shelling industry? We haveonly
one pump boat, but three swimming boats. They have only lately gone into the shelling business because
beche-de-mer has declined in price; and, owing to an accident, the natives will not spear turtles, so we
had to put them on to shelling.
4867. Allowing that certain areas were closed, having in view the difficulties in obtaining convictions in
the past, do you think the law should be altered so that the person in charge should be liable to imprison-
ment? He should be liable to a fine, unless he can give a satisfactory explanation.
4868. At present he is liable to a fine; but as a rule the fine has to be paid by the employer—that is
really no deterrent to poaching ? In that case I should imprison him, unless he had a satisfactory
explanation to make.
4869. By Mr. Bennett: You know that divers have been prosecuted for diving on prohibited .areas? I
do not remember any case. Of course it is a good number of years since we worked many boats.
4870. You have been a resident of Thursday Island for many years P Yes, for seventeen years.
4871. By the Chairman : Have vou engaged in any experiments with a view to the propagation of the
pearl-oyster by cultivation ? No.
4872. Have you any knowledge of any such experiments having been made ? I have knowledge of their
having been made ; but I do not know anything about the results beyond hearsay.
4873. You are aware that the divers at present employed are principally Japanese ? Yes.
4874. Would it not be desirable to alter that state of affairs ? Conscientiously, I should say yes.
4875. To make it a white man’s industry? Ido not think that is possible, unless with the assistance of
the Government; but it seems to me hardly probable.
4876. Have you had any experience of white divers ? No.
4877. Do you think white men could carry on the work of diving ? I think they could if it were made
worth their while; but, under present conditions and prices, Ido not think it possible.
4878. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the hardships are such that white men would not undertake it ?
I think white men would undertake the work, so far as divers and tenders are concerned.

4879. They will undertake anything so long as there is money in it? Yes. ■ i
4880. By the Chairman : Do you consider the present system of basing the license fee on the tonnage of ,
the vessel satisfactory ? No. I think it should be so much per vessel, regardless of tonnage. If a 1
person chooses to put £2OO or £3OO more into a boat to make her more comfortable for the crew, he
should not be penalised as against another man who does not provide the same accommodation for his
men.
4881. Bg Mr. Bennett : "What fee would you suggest ? The present minimum, £3.
4882. By Mr. Douglas : Do you not think that the larger the boat the more shell can bo obtained ? That
is possible. In fact, that is the case, because they can go further afield.
4883. The larger the boat, the more a man can afford to pay ? That is possible ; but a ton or two does
not make any difference. A 14-ton vessel can get as much shell as a vessel of 16 or 17 tons ; but a 10-ton
vessel cannot get as much as a 16-ton vessel.
4884. Not working around the reefs ? Yes ; but she could not go so far afield. I heard that complaint
from divers when we had a fleet working.
4885. A vessel of large tonnage could not get to places where a smaller vessel could get; so that in many
cases the smaller vessel might get more shell than the larger? That very seldom occurs.
4886. By Mr. Bennett: I suppose you do not know whether that is so or not ? I know two swimming
diving boats I have got were getting some shell in water from 5 to 7 feet deep ; and a pump boat drawing
7 feet could not work there; but that is a very rare occurrence.
4887. In fact, it may be taken to be an exception ? It is one of the few exceptions.
4888. By the Chairman : Do you consider that all licenses issued under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-
Mer Fishery Acts should be issued from one office? Certainly. At present we have to go to the
Custom House, then to the Shipping Office, and vice versa.
4889. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you consider it desirable that a system of cultivation should be introduced
in Torres Strait ? Yes ; especially if the Government will assist. It will certainly do no harm, and it
may do a great deal of good.
4890. From the point of view of an employer, do you think it would be an advantage if divers were
required to submit themselves to a medical examination before they could obtain licenses? That is
another thing that would do no harm, while it might save a lot of trouble. It may not be necessary.
4891. Have you bad cases of divers being licensed who afterwards proved physically unfit for the work ?
They may have been physically unfit, but it has never been proved. Very often we have discharged a
man because he did not get enough shell, thinking that it was because he was unfit; but that may not
have been the reason all the same.
4892. By the Chairman-. If something happened that would cause all the Japanese divers to be withdrawn,
what result would it have on the industry ? I think it would close it up for the time being.
4893. You are of opinion that wealth would lie at the bottom of the sea because so many Japanese were
called away ? Ido not say it would lie there for ever, but it would fake some time to get the industry
into working order again. There would not be enough divers available for the moment.
4894. By Mr. Douglas-. In suggesting that the number of boat licenses should be limited to 200, can you
suggest how the licenses should be issued so as to create no monopoly and to be fair to everybody? That
would be difficult, because you cannot refuse a license to anybody.
4895. But if the limit were fixed at 200 somebody might come along when the limit had been reached,
wanting a license, and be unable to get it—Again, supposing the Commission recommended that the
limit you suggest should be fixed, and our recommendation was adopted, some one might hurry up and
build a number of boats as quickly as possible with the object of creating a monopoly —Can you suggest
how that monopoly could be prevented ? The only way would be to limit each person to so many boats,
if that is possible.
4896. But if you limited each person to so many boats, is it not possible that a system of dummying
would crop up? Yes. lam afraid I cannot make any suggestion. It is scarcely possible for anybody
to secure a monopoly.
4897. By Mr. Bennett -. Have you any knowledge of boats being built by Japanese for pearl-shelling or
for the beche-de-mer fishery, and afterwards transferred nominally to white owners on condition that the
boats are registered in the name of the white owner, and afterwards retransferred to the Japanese, if
necessary, the Japanese retaining a controlling interest in them ? lam not aware of anything of the
kind. Of course, Japanese are continually building boats. At one time I was more interested than lam
now. We have only one pearling boat now.
4898. What is her size ? About 10 tons.
4899. By Mr. Douglas -. How many boats have you in the beche-de-mer industry ? We have the
“ Defender,” of 13 or 14 tons.
4900. Where is she now ? Down at Townsville. She has been on a reef, and is leaking badly. She is
going on to the slip to-day.
4901. Have you got a Japanese in charge of her ? Yes.
4902. By Mr. Bennett : How is his remuneration fixed ? He gets so much a ton for all fish.
4903. Ail cured fish? Yes. Then I have some cutters working in a small way.
4904. What is the rate per ton you pay him ? He is paid on a sliding scale.
4905. What are the exact figures ? I cannot say. The rate is on a sliding scale from 3 tons up to 15
tons. The three boats that 1 have swimming diving at the present time may be put into the pump diving
during the next month or two. A boy was taken by a shark, and that has caused the natives to put a
tabu on turtle-shelling ; but that may be taken off shortly. I would not put any of the boats into pearl-
shelling except the “ Eita ”
4906. By Mr. Douglas: Is turtle-shelling profitable? Yes.
4907. Is turtle-shell realising a good price at the present time ? At the present time it is very low.
4908. Bu Mr. Bennett: It is a thing you can hold ? If you have money in hand, you can hold it.
4909 By Mr. Douglas-. Have the shellers any means of controlling the home market? We have
endeavoured to control it by putting a reserve on the selling price.
4910 The custom in the past has been to take the price realised by auction ? Yes.
4911 Have you any idea as to what the average yearly earnings of a diver are in the industry as it is
worked at the present time ? I should say about £BO or £9O.
4912. Is that exclusive of pearls ? Yes.

n -4913. Any pearls he gets will be in addition to that ? Yes.
A 4914. By Mr. Bennett-. What do you consider a fair average of pearl-shell per boat per annum? 4£
8. to 4J tons.
4915. By Mr. Douglas : The more shell a diver gets over 1 tons, the greater will be the proportionate
increase in his earnings ? Yes.
4910. Would a diver require to get 4 tons of shell before he made anything under the present arrange-
ment ? He would need to get very nearly 4 tons.
4917. By Mr. Bennett: Before he made any wages for himself? No. Before he would make it worth
working for—he would make some wages. When the catch goes over 4 tons he would make 25 per cent,
more in proportion.
4918. By Mr. Douglas -. It does not cost him any more to get 5 tons than to get 4 tons ? No. It is
possible to get 6 tons in a year at the same cost as 4 tons.
4919. If a diver got 6 tons of shell, how much would he make, exclusive of pearls? It is not probable
that he would get 0 tons.
4920. By Mr. Bennett : But, allowing that he did ? From £2OO to £250.
Heeeiveeto Zaecal, Pearl Buyer and Jeweller, examined:
4921. By the Chairman : What is your occupation ? Pearl-buyer and jeweller.
-y 4922. How long have you been at Thursday Island? Sixteen years and a month to-day.
4 4923. You have also been engaged in the pearl-shelling industry ? Yes.
4924. As an employer ? Yes.
4925. Have you any vessels engaged in the industry now ? Not at present.
4926. Are yon interested in the pearl-shelling industry ? Not now.
4927. Bg Mr. Douglas-. You have been a large boat-owner in the past ? Yes.
4928. How many boats have you owned in any one year? Over twenty.
4929. Pump boats and swimming diving boats ? Yes.
4030. By the Chairman : Have you any idea of the present condition of the pearling-grounds ? Yes.
4931. Are they prolific or otherwise ? The shell is there on the pearling-grounds.
4932. By Mr. Bennett: As much as there used to be ? Yes.
4933. By Mr. Douglas : Has it been growing rapidly lately? Of course, in bad weather they cannot get
it. Besides, under present conditions, the divers do not go in much for shell. They go in for pearls so
as to get money for themselves.
4934. Do some grounds produce more pearls than others ? Yes.
4935. By the Chairman : Which grounds are in the beat condition at the present time ? The Old Ground
is in the best condition at any time.
4936. Do you consider the present deposit of shell sufficient to keep the vessels at present engaged in the
industry profitably employed ? Yes —and more.
4937. Do you know how many boats are engaged in the industry at the present time? I do.
4938. I low many? About 100.
4939. Do you think that number should be increased? I should think so.
4940. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you think there should be any limit—Do you think 1,000 boats would be too
many? Ido not think so, because the more people there are on the ground the more shell they will get.
If only a few divers go outside they are afraid; the more boats there are on the ocean the more shell
they get. Often now the boats go outside and take shell, but the divers are not encouraged to go there
because, under the present system, they make more money from pearls. They go to the reefs where
they can find pearls.
4941. Do they get many pearls now ? They get them, but they hold them. •
4942. Do you see many that are brought in by the boats ? Yes ; but I cannot buy them because they
ask such a big price.
4943. You clean a lot of pearls, do you not ? Yes ; but not for the Jap.
4944. You clean most of the valuable pearls that come from the Aroe Islands ? Yes.
4945. You say the Japanese hold their pearls—Are they not selling them ? Some of them they hold.
Yesterday I bought a beauty. It is the only one of extra value that I have had for the last six months.
4946. How much does an average diver earn, exclusive of pearls? One man might make £l,OOO, and
another might be in debt.
4947. The man who made £l,OOO was lucky and got a good pearl? Yes.
4948. By the Chairman : You consider that the number of boats should be unlimited ? Yes.
4949. By Mr. Douglas-. We have a Customs return which shows that in 1897 the average take of pearl-
shell per boat was 5 tons 14 cwt., while in 1904 the average was only 2 tons 4 cwt. —How do you account
for that ? Because at the time the boats were working near to the shore.
4950. In which of the years was that ? In the earlier year. There is any amount of shell outside, if they
could only stay out and get it.
4951. By Mr. Bennett -. Have you been out on the grounds ? Yes ; when I had the boats.
4952. On the Old Ground ? Yes.
4953. How long is it since you had boats ? Three years.
4954. By the Chairman : Were you ever down in the dress ? Yes, just for fun ; but not very often.
4955. Do you know the conditions under which pearl-shell is picked up? I do.
4956. What would be the probable effect of the periodical closure of beds ns a means for increasing
the supply of pearl-shell—closing beds for two or three years —Are you in favour of that? lam not in
favour of closing the beds near shore.
4957. How long should beds be closed in order to allow the shell to grow? I suppose about fifteen years,
4958. What localities would you recommend should be closed? I should think from Possession Island,
near Cape York, as far as Batavia River on the mainland.
4959. Are there any other localities you would recommend ? No.
4960. By Mr. Bennett -. What about Darnley ? Darnley is closed already. Nevertheless, they get shell
there.
4961. Do you think 6 inches or 5 inches should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? I think 0
inches is best, because shell of that size has the weight. A 5-inch shell is too thin.

4962. How long does it take a pearl-shell to mature ? I could not tell you exactly.
4963. By the Chairman ; How long do you think the shell would be growing to 6 inches ? I should think ,
about three years; but it takes along time to make the thickness. ]
4904. Do you think floating stations should be allowed ? I think floating stations are a very good thing
for Thursday Island. They are a mark for the divers outside. "When they fish on the Old Ground they
do not sight land, and they use the schooner as a mark, so that they are able to fish the ground better
and get more shell, t think it is a great advantage to have the floating stations—l say that not because
lam working for them—l am speaking for the benefit of the public. With a floating station we have
the population in the country, and the money is spent in the country.
4965. Does not the floating-station system tend to pick up all the shell ? It never will.
4900, By Mr. Douglas: Why did the floating stations go away from here? I do not understand the
reason. I suppose it was through the restrictions.
4907. Did they not find it was unprofitable owing to the low price of shell ? No. It was through the
Commonwealth restrictions.
4968. By Mr. Bennett: What restrictions ? It was very hard to get labour.
4969. By Mr. Douglas: Was everybody else the same? The shell was paying well. We have a good
quality of shell; but I do not think the floating stations went away because they did not pay. They
can catch enough shell anywhere here. They could go 75 or 80 miles from here, and find shell; but you
cannot force a diver to work there, as he might run short of tucker, and bo in debt.
4970. By Mr. Bennett: What were the labour restrictions you referred to ? They have to be responsible
in case labourers run away or are lost, and they have to pay a penalty to the Commonwealth.
4971. Did you ever have any experience of that kind ? I never indented any labour.
4972. So that really you know nothing about it except what you have been told ? No.
4973. By ihe Chairman: Have you engaged in any experiment with a view to the propagation of the
pearl oyster by cultivation ? No.
4974. You know nothing about it ? No.
4975. What is the value of the pearls sent away from here every year on the average, supposing they
were bringing good prices ? I could not tell you exactly.
4976. You see a lot of the pearls? Yes. I should think the average would be about £B,OOO a year.
4977. How do you arrive at that estimate ? Because we buy a lot of pearls not found in Torres Strait.
4978. Are you referring to pearls that may have come from the Aroe Islands ? Yes, or from Port
Darwin.
4979. Before the fleets went to the Aroe Islands, what was the value of pearls exported annually ? I
think it was £lO,OOO or £12,000. During the last three years Ido not think it has been more than
£B,OOO a year.
4980. I suppose you know that nearly all the divers employed at present are Japanese ? Yes.
4981. Is it desirable that the Japanese should have a monopoly of the industry? No.
4'182. Would it be possible to induce some white men to undertake the work ? I do not think a white
man could undertake the work as well as a Japanese.
4983. Why ? White men value their lives more than the present divers.
4984. White men go to New Guinea and lead a very precarious life—Do you not think that that is as
risky as diving ? It is risky, but there is a better living to be found if they discover gold. They go
through with it with the prospect of getting a big nugget.
4985. A pearl or two would be just as valuable as the gold ? But they do not count on that to the same
extent.
4986. If the conditions were made more favourable, could not white men be induced to undertake the
work ? If the white man could do it, lam in favour of that.
4987. You must have heard that there have been thirty or forty white divers here—ls it not a pity that
the Japanese should derive all the benefit from the industry ? It is objectionable to have only one race.
I think the white divers would be the best, if you could get them.
4988. If we had a scientific man to teach the people how to cultivate the shell, would that tend to make
the industry attractive to white men ? Ido not think so.
4989. Scientific men have improved the conditions in other industries, and is it not reasonable to assume
that they could improve the conditions heto? Yes ; but there is nothing to be improved, because there
is a lot of shell outside where they cannot get it.
4990. But if the Government had a biological station at Wai-Wcer ? That would be a very wise thing.
4991. If that were done, and the Government secured a biologist, and had a vessel hero to teach young
white men to become divers ? That would be a very good idea.
4992. Would it not be successful in a very short time ? In time.
4993. Then white men could do the work under those conditions ? Yes.
4994. Do you think the conditions regarding pearl-buying licenses are satisfactory ? Yes.
4995. You are a resident of Thursday Island, and you pay £25 a year for the right to buy pearls, and any
non-resident can come along and buy pearls—Do you consider it right that he should bo allowed to do
that? Yes, provided he takes out a license.
4996. But he may not stay here a fortnight ? They only buy from licensed dealers. I do not think any
restriction is necessary.
4997. By Mr. Bennett: You believe in free trade ? If you come here and buy one pearl, you do not
require to get a license; but, if it is your business, you have to take out a license.
4998. Do you not think there should be a residential qualification ? No.
4999. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think a man should be compelled to live in Queensland for six or twelve
months before he can get a license ? No.
5000. Do jmu not think it would be more convenient if all licenses under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-
Mer Fishery Act were issued by the Shipping Master? I quite approve of that.
Hauby Albany Colless, Baker and ex-Diver, examined:

5002. Have vou been engaged in the pearl-shell industry ? Yes, for sixteen years. i

H. A. Coll ess.,
16 J une, 1908.
•6005. Was it remunerative ? I did all right.
5006. Did you enjoy good health ? Yes.
.5007. How old were you when you started diving? Twenty-one years.
5008. Your father was diving ? No ; he was never a diver.
5009. Were you diving on his boats? Yes.
5010. In what years were you diving ? I was diving in 1901. I gave it up in 1902, and then I was at it
again, and then again.
5011. Why did you cease diving—Was it not sufficiently profitable? It was not that. It wasjmore on
account of my father and me falling out that 1 chucked it up.
5012. You found it agree with you? It agreed with me very well.
5013. Had you been engaged on the boats in years prior to 1901 ? I was out in the boats, but not on
the articles. If a man got sick, I used to take his place till the boat came in.
5014. When was it you first went on the boats ? I think it was fifteen years last January—the time all
the boats went down to Cooktown.
5015. What grounds were you chiefly working on ? I was working on the Old Ground a little, but it
was mostly reef work. I was out at Darnley.
5016. Did you work in deep water at Darnley? I was down 22 fathoms, but I did not stay down.
5017. Did it have any effect on you ? I had rheumatics. I was down in deep water at Kitnus Strait.
5018. Has the diving gear been improved of late ? Yes.
5019. If the dress was sufficiently strong to protect the diver’s body, would it be safe to work in deep
water ? I think so ; but I would not like to work in deep water, knowing how many deaths have occurred
there.
5020. By Mr. Bennett : When you are in the water, is it the pressnre of the water or the dress that you
feel ? The dress is squeezed right into you. In shallow water you can work with the valve quite close,
or half open.
6021. So that you are working under air pressure ? Yes.
5022. Do you know of any improvement in the diving dress ? I went down in one like a jacket, which
Dr. White brought me.
5023. It is an improved jacket ? Yes ;it keeps the dress off the body.
5024. Did the experiment you made with it prove successful ? I tried it in the Strait. The dress was
made quite straight, and I told Dr. White that it wanted armpits for the arms. He sent the dress away
and got it back again, and a Japanese diver has taken it out to Darnley.
5025. Do you think that jacket will be an improvement? It will be an improvement for deep-water
diving, because it keeps the dress clear from you, which makes it easier on the diver,
5026. By the Chairman ■ What keeps the dress from falling in on the body ? When the dress is put on,
it is blown up with air before you go down.
5027. By Mr. Douglas : It would have to be very strong to stand the pressure ? Yes.
5028. IF it collapsed ? You would have the ordinary dress to protect you.
5029. By the Chairman'. Is it flexible enough to allow you to move your hands? Yes; it does not
interfere with the hands, but the dress I tried was tight.
5030. By Mr. Douglas: It is like a jacket ? Yes ; but it only comes down to the fork.
5031. By Mr. Bennett-. When did the dress go out to Darnley ? Six weeks ago.
5082. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the pearling-grounds have been over-fished of late years ? I
fancy so.
5033. They have not been getting the same hauls as they used to get? They are doing better now than
they did a few years ago ; but just at present the weather is against them.
5034. Is the improvement in the beds due to the fleets going away to the Aroe Islands ? I think so.
5035. Do you think there have been too many boats working on the pearling-grounds? Yes.
5036. Would it be advisable to close any of the grounds for certain periods in order to give the shell
a chance of growing, or would it be better that only a limited number of boats should be allowed to
fish ? A limitation in the number of boats would be better than closing the grounds, because the weather
protects the grounds.
5037. Are there certain times of the year when you can see shell more readily on the Old Ground than
at others? Yes.
6038. What is the best time for fishing there ? After Christmas, or in the north-west season, if you can
get fine weather.
5039. What about the weeds at that time ? They have died. The grass also dies on the reefs to the
eastward.
6040. Can you easily distinguish the size of a 5-inch shell on the bottom? No; because the shell is
always magnified by the glasses.
5041. Have you any means of measuring the shell? Only with your hand; but some shell have a
bigger lip than others.
5042. By Mr. Bennett: Young shell stand up, do they not? The young shell are fast to the ground.
6043. And the older shell is more or less lying down ? Yes.
5044. By Mr. Douglas : Does the shell lie on the round side or on the flat side ? On both. It is far
easier to see a shell on the Old Ground than on the ground to the eastward, because in the latter case
the bottom is spongy. The Old Ground has trees and ferns growing on it, but there is more sand there.
5045. Have you weighed a 5-inch shell and a 6-inch shell ? No.
5046. Do you think there is much difference in the weight of the two ? Not much.
5047. Are there many valuable pearls found in shell between 5 inches and 6 inches ? Yes; the best
pearls have been found in shell of that size. You will seldom find a pearl of any value in a big shell.
5048. Do you think a diver would pick up a shell under 5 inches to see if there was a pearl in it ? I do
not think divers would.
5049. How long does it take shell to grow ? I have no idea. They grow very slowly on the eastward
side.
5050. Have you worked in Endeavour Strait ? Yes.
5051. Do you remember when that ground was closed ? Yes.
5052. Did you work there after it was reopened ? No; I was not a diver then.
156
Minutes of evidence taken before the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer royal commission.


5053. Would you be prepared to engage in diving again if the remuneration was payable ? If I was out •
of my present position I would sooner fake to that than to anything else.
5054. Would you be able to obtain employment at the present time at a payable rate? At the time I:
was working I was only getting £20 a ton, and then I was working for my father, and did not work the
same as I would have to do for another man. I was young and foolish then.
5055. Bearing in mind the hardships of a diver’s life, what do you think it would be a fair thing for him
to expect as wages? I reckon about £150 a year.
5056. Were you making that much? No. It is very seldom you find a pearl.
5057. Did you find it a hard life? No. I was in my father’s boat, and was better situated than some
other divers.
5058. By Mr. Bennett: You fished at Warrier Reef, Long Island, and round there? Yes; and at
Daru, Coeoanut Island, and those places.
5059. That was for pearls ? Yes—at Mangrove and Long Islands.
5060. By Mr. Boughs : Do you think that diving is a business that a white man would take to if there
was a fair wage in it? Yes ; provided there was a white man on board with him as tender.
5061. Had you a white man as tender? No; a Manila man.
5062. Did you find him satisfactory? He worked all right, but you could not understand him as you
would a white tender. You might ask him where you were, and he would say whatever first came into
his head.
5063. Then you think a white diver should have a white tender? Yes, so that he could explain to him
how he wanted things worked. If a Japanese is down on the bottom, and he wants a boat to go to him,
he gives the signal to the tender, and, if the boat cannot go to him, the tender slacks the chain and gives
the diver the signal to come up.
5064. Have you had any experience in connection with cultivation experiments ? No.
5065. Have you had anything to do with them ? No.
5066. Do you think it would be a good thing for the Government to assist in the cultivation of shell?
Yes.
5067. You think the Government would be justified in ascertaining what was the best way of catching
the spat and looking after it until the shell matured ? Yes.
5068. Do you know of any young men, natives of the Straits, who would become divers ? No.'
5069. "Would any of them take it up if there was a station established where they could get some
knowledge of diving? I am not sure ; and I would not like to say.
5070. I suppose a young white man would not care about going out in a boat with a Japanese diver?
No.
5C71. Do you think it would be a good thing for the Government to establish a training school for
divers, not only for young men growing up here, but for men coming from other places ? Yes. There is
a lot to learn about the grounds, too.
5072. By Mr. Bennett: They would want to learn where to get the shell, and at what time to look for
it on certain grounds ? Yes ; and to learn about the tides, slack water, and dirty water.
5073. A man working in Torres Strait can go on gaining experience all his working life ? Yes.
5074. You do not consider that you have learned everything ? No ; I have a lot to learn.
5075. By the Chairman : How long do you think it would take a strong young fellow to learn to dive?
If ho went with the right man —a white man —who would teach him, three months, or less than that.
5076. By Mr. Bennett: To learn to dive three months would be ample ? Yes.

Present :
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Mb. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mb. G. H. BENNETT.
Walter Randolph Carpenter, Pearl-Sheller, examined:
5077. By the Chairman : What is your occupation ? Pearl-shellcr.
5078. How long have you been on Thursday Island ? Since 1897.
5079. Have you had experience as employer or manager in the pearl-shelling industry ? I have been
manager for a portion of that time, and employer for the other portion. ' ,
5080. How many boats do you own now ? Eight, six of which are pump boats, and two beche-de-mer '
boats. .on*,, ,
5081. Are the whole of those boats under your management i Practically, as managing director; but I
gave up the active management at the beginning of last year.
5082. Are those boats registered in Queensland ports? Nearly all of them are. The registers of some
new boats are not out yet, but they are under way.
5083. Do you know how many boats are engaged in the pearl-shell industry at the present time ? Only
from hearsay. I believe there are about 108.
5084 What is the present condition of the pearhng-grnunds with regard to the supply of shell ? With
the present number of boats working, the supply of shell is increasing slightly.
5085 By Mr Bennett: At one time the grounds had been depleted r Ihey were being depleted very
fast owin g to the larger number of boats that were working on them
5086. Do you think there is profitable employment in the industry tor the present number of boats ? I
Do you think the number of vessels licensed should be limited ? I do; because I do not think the
grounds will stand many more without suffering depletion.

\V. R.

17 June, 1908.
5088. To what number would you suggest they should be limited ? Ido uot think the number should
be above 150 at the outside.
5089. On what basis would you suggest that licenses should be issued so that no person should have a
■ monopoly ? That is a very hard question, as far as monopoly is concerned, unless you limit a certain
number to each owner.
5090. By Mr. Douglas : Could that be done effectively ? It could scarcely be done without hardship at
the pre.sent time, because some men ow r n quite a number of boats.
5091. Supposiug four were fixed as the limit for each person, could not each member of a company have
the maximum number of boats registere d in his name, and so evade the regulation—Would it not resolve
itself into a question of dummying? I am afraid it would. It would be better to have straight-out
ownership by a company than anything of that sort.
5092. What, in your opinion, would be the probable effect of the periodical closure of beds as a means of
maintaining and possibly increasing the supply of pearl-shell ? Ido not think it would have any effect
at all.
5093. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? I have never given that
matter serious thought, but I think the present minimum is sufficient. Under the system under which
we are working now, very little small shell is brought in. Ido not think it exceeds 1 per cent.
5091. Do you think any restriction should be placed on the size of vessels employed in the industry P
That is also a hard question. Speaking as an individual on shore, I say the limit for pearling-boats
should be 25 tons.
5095. Do you think the floating-station system had a tendency in the past to over-fish the grounds, owing
to the fact that they were able to keep their boats together, and constantly at work in one spot? 1 do
not think so.
5090. Why do you suggest to limit the tonnage to 25 tons ? Because it would keep the industry on
shore, and the people on shore would get more benefit than they would if the industry w'ere carried on by
means of floating stations.
5097. By ihe Chairman : You do not approve of floating stations ? I have never worked with a floating
station.
5098. By Mr. Douglas : Do you consider that with the floating-station system the owners are able to
work the grounds more closely than with the shore-station system ? Ido not think so.
5099. You do not think they can keep their boats more constantly at w r ork ? No ; the weather will drive
the boats off.
5100. What about boats having to come in in fine weather owing to sickness amongst the crew ? That
occurs very seldom, and, when it does occur, it is only because one individual among the crew has been
attacked by illness.
5101. What about gear breaking and requiring repairs? The boats are highly geared, and it is very
seldom an accident occurs which renders it necessary for a boat to run in for repairs. I also consider
that (he industry can be W'orked more profitably from the shore than from a floating station.
5102. It is only necessary to send in the boats in urgent cases ? Yes. My experience of shelling is that
you cannot always work, and that most,of the time lost is lost in weather when you cannot vvork. There
are only isolated cases in which a boat has to come in because the diver or one of the crew is sick.
5103. You think the grounds have been over-fished in the past ? 1 do.
510-1. Since the Clark combine fleets left the Strait, the beds have had a chance to recuperate ? Yes;
and I consider that the beds have recuperated since then.
5105. Do you think that the number of boats fishing the grounds prior to the departure of those fleets
was more than the grounds could stand ? Many more than the grounds could stand.
5100. Do you consider that that was the reason why the fleets ceased to work in Torres Strait ? Yes ;it
was unprofitable.
5107. Were the labour conditions severe ? No.
5108. By Mr. Bennett ; How many boats were you working? Twelve pump boats.
5109. By Mr, Douglas r AVcre you able to get all the labour you required ? Yes ; quite enough, with
New Guinea natives, to make up the supply.
5110. By Mr. Bennett : Did you consider the Commonwealth restrictions too irksome ? A T o. The only
thing that was very hard on owners was (he bond, but that has been altered. The alteration was made
when Dr. AVollaston came here some years ago, and the total liability of an owner is now' fixed at £l,OOO.
5111. AVhat was the liability previous to that? It was determined by the number of men you employed.
5112. By Mr. Douglas : Would you suggest that the number of boats employed in the industry should
be limited ? Yes
5113. You think that is a better means for preserving the supply of shell than closing the grounds? I
do not think it would be a good thing to close the grounds where the spat is produced.
5114. By Mr. Bennett : Suppose a ground is depleted to such an extent that it is unprofitable to work
it, would any boats still go over that ground fossicking for the few shell tiny might pick up? Ido not
think so. 1 may cite one instance. The ground at lied Point was fished so continuously that shell
became very scarce, and it was left alone for four or five years. The ground has now recuperated, and
boats are doing fairly well there.
5115. But do you not think that if a ground was effectively closed—not merely proclaimed closed —it
would recover more quickly than it would if left to chance, as was the case with Endeavour Strait ? I
do not know' enough about the subject to be able to give an opinion ; but I think that when the ground
is worked to such an extent that it is unprofitable the shellers will leave it entirely alone, and that, with
its natural productiveness, it will recuperate in a comparatively short time. According to Mr. Tosh, one
oyster will throw' off about 1,000,000 spat. That would be sufficient to replenish the supply on any
ground. There are many places in Endeavour Strait which I am satisfied have never been worked.
During last week shellers found little places from which they obtained a fair quantity of old shell, which
show s that that ground could not have been fished for some time previously.
5110. By Mr. Douglas: AVith regard to the limiting of licenses, have you any plan by which, if the
number of licenses were limited, you could prevent the creation of a monopoly? The limitation of
licenses would, to a certain extent, create a monopoly. Still, a certain amount of protection must be
given to those who are already in the industry. It is for the Government to say whether they will allow


a big fleet to come here and deplete these grounds entirely, and then go away again, or protect those who
are here, even though they may have a partial monopoly. It is a case of choosing the lesser of two evils.
5117. Do }'ou think it is practicable to devise a scheme under which the Government could take over the ,
whole of the boats, and close the beds for a time, or work a certain number of beds for the general 5
benefit ? You mean to say purchase the boats right out ?
5118. Yes, to nationalise the industry? I do not think there is an owner here who would not sell,
provided the price was satisfactory.
5119. By the Chairman : Have you engaged in any experiments with a view to the propagation of the
pearboyster by cultivation ? No, I know nothing about production.
5120. Would calling in the aid of a biologist assist you in any way ? I think it would, because he would
demonstrate what could be done in the line of cultivation.
5121. You are aware that the majority of the divers at the present time are Japanese ? Yes.
5122. Is that a desirable state of affairs ? Ido not know whether it is desirable ; but, in the present
state of the industry, I do not think there are any others than the Japanese who could work it
profitably.
5123. Suppose no coloured divers were available, what would be the result? When white divers were at
work in the industry the grounds were more prolific than they are now. Having been worked as they
have, it would not be profitable for a white roan to engage in the industry, and I do not think ho would
take it on.
5121. Evidence has been given that Japanese divers net sometimes £3OO or £lOO a year ? 1 think that
evidence must have come from a person who has never had any interest in the business.
5125. You think the industry could not be carried on with wlr’tc divers ? Not in the present state of the
industry.
5120. If the Government called in the aid of a biologist, would he not bring about more favourable
conditions? Ido not think so, unless he demonstrated that cultivation could be successfully carried on.
5127. Would you be in favour of a school for white divers? Certainly.
5128. You think it is very doubtful whether the labours of a biologist would result in benefit to the
industry ? Ido not say that the result would not be beneficial.
5129. Every other industry has benefited from the work of scientists? I think this industry would also ;
but there would be no immediate benefit.
5130. It is not suggested that there should be any sudden change—that would be repudiation, which
would be unfair to you, to the Japanese, and to everybody concerned—it is only suggested that there
might be a gradual process of change with a view to conserving the industry for the white man ? The
white man might have a chance like that if the number of boats were not allowed to increase. Then the
shell would increase, and make it sufficiently profitable for white men to come in later on.
5131. Hut that does not point to any method for dispensing with the services of the coloured divers ? It
would in time, because, when the industry became profitable for while men, restrictions could be imposed.
Until then it would be a hardship upon those already in the industry if any stringent legislation were
introduced.
5132. The change we look forward to will only take place with the extinction of the Japanese diver, and
that might take a long time? I do not mean extinction from natural causes; but legislation would
have to come in later, when the grounds were sufficiently profitable for a white man to work. At present
they arc not sufficiently profitable.
5133. With the present number of boats, would not the beds recuperate ? I think they will recuperate
with the present number of boats.
5131. You suggest limiting them to the present number ? Yes.
5135. You think that under the changed conditions to which 1 have referred the industry could be made
remunerative and attractive to white men ? Yes, later on.
5136. I suppose you have had no experience of white divers? .1 had one, but he did not work here. I
finished with a big debt.
5137. Do you consider the present system of basing the amount of license fee on flic tonnage of a
vessel satisfactory ? No.
5138. What improvement would you suggest? A uniform fee, regardless of tonnage, because the-
present system is like taxing improved property.
5139. Is the present system of issuing licenses to divers and persons in charge satisfactory? I cannot
recommend anything else.
5140. By Mr. Bennett : What would you think of a certificate of competency in lieu of the diver’s
license, which is not a certificate of competency at all ? Do you mean competency to handle a boat?
5141. I am glad you suggested that, because it is necessary that he should be competent to handle a boat
if he is to bo in charge —competency would necessarily include that as well as diving? I think it would
be a protection to owners. A diver would have to show that he really was a diver before he could get a
license. The present employers know their men pretty well; but a newcomer could be easily imposed
upon.
5112. The certificate of competency would be the diver’s property during good conduct and efficiency? Yes.
5113. It would entitle him to be employed without the payment of an annual license fee —he would make
one payment for his certificate, and that would be all —Would that not be a protection to the employer as
well as a concession to the diver ? Probably it would be better than the present system. He would only
hold the certificate so long as he was a competent diver ?_
5111. Yes—if he was found to be incompetent his certificale must be suspended or cancelled the same as
a master’s certificate? It would be some protection to the owner if that were the ease.
5145.'' Do you think it would be an improvement? Yes.
5116. What do you think of the present system of pearl-buyers’ licenses? It is very inadequate. Any
person can get a license to buy pearls ; and then he can buy pearls from anybody, whether a boat-owner, .
the owner of the pearls, or anybody else. No protection is given to the pearl-sheller.
5147 Do you think the licenses should be abolished? Yes; and licenses granted only to bond fide
boat-owners. . . _ .
5148 Are you in favour of a residential qualification tor pearl-buyers —lor instance, a man may come by a .
steamer and take out a license, and scoop the pool ? If a man comes here, he becomes a resident for a
certain time.

5149. But is it fair to the man who is domiciled here ? It is very hard to say. If it became necessary,
• they would domicile themselves here, because you could not insist upon a long period of domicile.
You think that at present the law is inoperative r Yes; there is no protection whatever for the
8. pearl-sheller.
5151. You are aware that licenses for buying pearls are issued by the Police Magistrate, and licenses for
pearl-shelling by the Sub-collector of Customs ? Yes.
5152. W ould it not be more convenient for employers to have all those licenses issued by the Shipping
Master? Yes ; I think all the licenses under the Act should be issued from one centre.
5153. Are you fairly well acquainted with the Pearl-shell and Bcche-de-Mer .Fishery Acts ? I cannot
say that I have read them very often.
5154. Do you know whether there is one or more than one? There is the first Act and the amending
Act.
5155. You do not know how many Acts there are? No.
515 G. Would you be inclined to favour the consolidation and .amendment of the Acts? I think it would
be better. I also think it would be better to have separate Acts for dealing with the pearl-shell and
beche-de-mer industries, as the conditions ruling in the one industry are not the conditions ruling in the
other.
5157. You consider that legislation for the two industries should be distinct ? Entirely distinct.
5158. By Mr. Douglas: The present term of lease for a cultivation area is seven yestrs ; do you think
that would be long enough if a biologist could demonstrate that shell can be cultivated with success ?
No.
5159. What term would you suggest ? It would have to be twenty-one years at the very least, because
a person would have to put down shell in the area and to be replenishing it constantly.
5160. Would you suggest that the Government should obtain a revenue from the areas in the way of a
royalty or rent ? The Government might do better out of a royalty, which would also have the advantage
of not being so hard on the leaseholder, because, if he did not do well, he would not have a great deal to
pay ; while, if he did .well, he could afford to pay.
5161. Supposing there was more than one application for an area, would you suggest public competition ?
No; priority.
5162. By Mr. Bennett: Or a ballot ? Ora ballot.
5163. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea how long it takes shell to grow to the exportable size of
5 inches ? No. The only instance I can refer to is at Bed Point. It is about five years since the ground
was worked, and it is now profitable to work there again. New shell of marketable size is now being
found there.
5164. Can you give us any idea of the net annual earnings of a diver under the present system of
working ? It depends upon the ability of the diver. A man getting about 4i tons would earn at the rate
of about £25 a ton. If he got 3J tons he would net nothing.
5165. The whole of the expenses would be a charge against the lay he would get ? Yes.
5166. Unless he gets a certain amount of shell, he really gets no wages himself ? No.
5167. r ihe more shell he gets the more money he makes? Yes.
5168. Was last year a successful one for the divers ? Fairly successful. I think it was the most
succesful they have had for many years.
5169. By Mr. Bennett: What rate would he be paid for a catch of 4 tons or under ? £B2 10s. a ton ; over
that, £B7 10s. a ton.
5170. So that a diver’s object is to reach the 4-ton limit as quickly as possible, and to get as much as he
can ? Yes. Of course our object is to get a quantity, because, if we do not, it is not payable to
ourselves.
5171. Has that system any effect in discouraging the taking up of small shell ? I think so, because the
amount of small shell that is brought in is not 1 per cent. The divers go for ground with big shell.
5172. By small shell, you mean shell on the limit? Fes. My own experience with “ A.A.” shell
for this year is that I have not collected a case. “A. A.” shell is the limit shell, from sto inches—
what is called “ chicken ” shell.
5173. From what grounds are the principal supplies of shell now being drawn ? From the Old Ground.
5174. What proportion of the shell is taken from there? I should say nearly 75 per cent.
5175. Does a large proportion of the remaining 25 per cent, come from the Daruley grounds? I was
not considering Darnley. I think that Darnley itself produces about 25 per cent, of the output. At
least, it did last year.
5176. At that rate, your answer was slightly misleading ? Yes. Omitting the catch from Darnley, 75
per cent, of the shell is got from the Old Ground.
5177. Where does the remaining 25 per cent, come from ? From all the other grounds in Torres Strait—
Mabuiag, Long Island, Endeavour Strait, Red Point, Mount Adolphus, Somerset—generally speaking, all
round the Strait.
5178. A large proportion of the Mabuiag shell is got by swimming diving? Yes, the majority of it.
5179. That would be in water not exceeding 6 fathoms in depth ? Yes.
5180. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience in the beche-de-mer industry ? Next to none.
5181. By Mr. Douglas: But you have some boats engaged in the industry? Only this year. I have
had no results from them yet, and can say nothing about them.
6182. What class of men are in charge ? Japanese.
5183. Are they large boats ? There is one big one and one small one.
5184. What is the tonnage of the large one ? Twenty-three tons.
6185. By Mr. Bennett: What is her name? The “Amy.”
5186. Is she a registered vessel ? Yes. The register is not out yet; but the papers are in Townsville.
6187. AYas that boat built for you? She was not built for me in the first instance. I bought her
afterwards.
5188. Where was she built? On the slip, by Turuta. He had an order, I understand, which did not
come off, and I purchased the boat from him.
5189. By Mr. Douglas: Most of the boat-building here is done by the Japanese ? Yes—the whole of it.
• 5190. What is the rate of wages paid to the carpenters ? From £5 to £8 per month.
5191. AYith provisions? Board and lodging.
160
MINUTES OP EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEK ROTAL COMMISSION.


5192. Is there much difference between the cost of building a boat here and the cost of getting one from
the South ? The difference is really the cost of bringing a vessel up from the South.
5193. Have you had any vessels built in the South ? Iso. While I was with Burns, Philp, and Co. they
had some built down South.
5194. Do you think it desirable to lay it down that in future all vessels licensed shall be built by white
labour? Yes; that would have a good effect. Prom my own point of view, I should like to see the
carpentering industry controlled by whites entirely, but the whites would have to be a desirable class of
workers.
5195. Is there much boat-building done on “spec.” ? Not that I know of. The starting of boat-building
here was really brought about when the Clark Company first came hero and bought some boats. There
was a kind of understanding that, if the builders built boats while there were no repairs going on, those
boats would be purchased by the company for the Aroo Islands—later on.
5196. By Mr. Bennett : Has that arrangement obtained of late ? No; because they have not been over
here.
5197. There are two or three new boats on the slip now, are there not ? I think there are three.
5198. Are any of those for you ? No.
5199. What arrangement is the Japanese in charge of the “ Amy ” engaged under? Under the same
arrangement as ordinary pearling boats—on the “ lay ” system.
5200. Does he pay all wages ? We pay the wages and take the amount out of his “lay.”
5201. But he is responsible to you for the wages ? Yes.
5202. And the vessel is responsible to the men ? Yes.
5203. Is she out working now ? Yes.
5204. In what direction ? Down near Mackay.
5205. By Mr. Douglas-. Is there anything you would like to suggest that has not been touched upon by
the Commission ? No, Ido not know of anything.
John Andebsen, Diver and ex-Pearl-Sheller, examined :
5206. By the Chairman : What are you ? A diver by trade.
5207. How many years have you been in Torres Strait ? Since 1886.
5208. Have you had any experience in the pearl-shelling industry ? Yes ; I have been at that all the
time, pretty well. '
5209. Diving? Yes—diving and as boat-owner.
5210. How long were you employed as diver ? I was diving constantly about fifteen or sixteen years.
5211. You do not look as if it disagreed with you? Oh no. lam as healthy now as ever I was.
5212. By Mr. Douglas : Does that mean that you have been diving and having spells ? Yes; I have had
spells between the times I was diving.
5213. Have you been diving off and on since 1884 ? I have not. done much diving the last seven or
eight years. During the last three or four years 1 have done some diving.
5214. You started diving in 1884 ? Yes ; and I was diving constantly with occasional spells for many
years.
5215. Then you have really been diving off and on during the last twenty-four years ? Yes.
5216. By the Chairman : What was the length of the spells you had ? Six months sometimes.
5217. By Mr. Bennett : Have you been home since you came here ? Yes; I have been a trip home, and
a few trips to Sydney.
5218. Where is your home now? Sydney, New South Wales.
5219. By Mr. Douglas: Have you ever suffered from any ill-health or bodily defects as the result of
diving ? No; except from rheumatics, which all divers get in deep water.
5220. Have you been diving in deep water ? Yes, in 22 fathoms.,
5221. Constantly ? A month at a time.
5222. Have you been diving at Darnley ? No. I have been out there, but I did not go into the deep
water.
5223. Do you think diving is a hazardous occupation in which a man carries his life in his hand ? No.
Up to 15 fathoms it is comparatively safe.
5224. Fouling is tho greatest danger ? Yes ; fouling you can get in any water.
5225. And a pipe bursting ? I have had a pipe burst, and did not know it. It burst in 15 fathoms.
5226. By the Chairman : Then you think diving can be carried on by white men ? Yes.
5227. That is, if they have sufficient inducement ? That is so. Ido not think there is sufficient induce-
ment now.
5228. By Mr. Douglas: Did you find it profitable employment in the early part of your experience ?
Yes, up to about 1901 and 1902.
5229. Were you here from 1892 to 1896 ? Yes ; and I was away for a few years.
5230. In those years the price of shell was very low, going down as low as £79 a ton ? Yes ; that was
about 1892 or 1893.
5231. Were you working here then? Yes ; I was working down the coast, and I got a good number of
shell, and made it pay.
5232. With shell at that price ? Yes.
5233. What did your take average ? Ten tons per boat that year.
5234. By Mr. Bennett: With white divers ? Yes.
5235. By Mr. Douglas: That was mostly on the East Coast? We went down there in all weathers. We
were then getting as low as £BO and £6O a ton for the shell.
5236. You attribute your large catch to the quantity of shell obtained on the East Coast ? Yes—
inferior shell. . . . „
5237. And tho inferior shell would bring the price down ? Yes.
5238. But you made it pay ? Yes. , . , . ,
5239 By Mr. Bennett: What wages did you pay ? £4 a month tor white tenders; £25 per ton for divers.
521 o! By Mr. Douglas ; How many boats did you work ? Four.
5241. Were your brothers with you ? Yes.

n. 5242. Had you any difficulty in getting white tenders at £4 a month ? Not at that time.
5243. Do you prefer to work with a white tender ? Yes.
38.5244. By the Chairman : Do you know if there are any white divers available now ? They say there are
a couple here who are good divers and can do the work, but there is not money enough in it for them.
5245. What inducement would you suggest to make the industry more attractive to white divers ? The
only way I can see is a rise in the price of shell. If the price of shell is £l5O a ton clear, it will pay
a white man to work in the industry.
5246. By Mr. Bennett : What do you consider is the least amount a white man would want to earn in
the industry ? He should earn from £2O to £25 a month.
5247. You consider that with wages under that amount the industry would not be very attractive to white
men ? That is so.
5248. By the Chairman : If the Government assisted with a bonus of so much per ton of shell raised by
white men, do you think that would encourage white divers? It all depends upon the market price of shell.
If a white man could clear £l5O a ton on the shell it would pay him.
5249. By Mr, Douglas ; Apart from the question of a bonus, it would depend upon the price obtained for
shell in London ? Yes.
5250. By the Chairman: If it could be made attractive to white men, do you think plenty of young divers
could be induced to come from your part of the -world— Scandinavia ? I could not say, not having been
there for so many years. The best men we have there are sailors, and their circumstances have altered
very much during the last few years. The vessels are all steamers now, and the sailors get much better
Pay-
-5251. Are you familiar with the conditions of fishing in the North Sea? A little.
5252. You know how arduous that calling is ? Yes.
5253. Do you think that diving for pearl-shell in Torres Strait is harder work than that ? No. You
might get white men in the colonies to go in for diving; but sailors are very scarce here now. They are
getting £5 a month in deep-water ships from Newcastle.
5254. By Mr. Douglas : How long does it take a man to learn diving ? Not long ; but he should have
three months’ experience in a lugger before he takes to diving.
5255. Should a person before he is licensed as a diver undergo a medical examination? Ido not think
so If a man is not sound, diving will soon tell on him. If he has any disease it soon shows if he works
in deep water.
5256. By the Chairman : Did you sustain any injury at all while you were diving ? None whatever.
5257. Are the pearling-grounds prolific or otherwise at the present time? I think they are holding their
own pretty well, with the number of boats at work now.
5258. Would it be wise to increase that number ? Ido not think so. Ido not think the grounds would
support more than 100 boats.
5259. Do you think the number of vessels at present employed could secure remunerative results ? I
think so.
5260. By Mr. Douglas : How many boats ha've you licensed just now ? Only one boat.
5261. So that you do not make that suggestion from an interested point of view ? No.
5262. By Mr. Bennett : You are not diving for pearl-shell with that boat ? No; lam wrecking.
5263. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that, with a view to the employment of white divers, the
grounds can fairly carry 100 boats ? I went to Western Australia in 1885. At that time there were
about 150 boats here ; and half of them went to Western Australia.
5264. By Mr. Bennett: There was more shell on -the Western Australian beds, and the shell was
decreasing very much here ? When I came back three years afterwards, I found that the beds had
recovered very much, especially the Old Grounds and Endeavour Strait.
5265. By the Chairman : Would the closing of the grounds bo beneficial ? Ido not think so.
5266. What is your reason for that opinion ? Many of the grounds have no small shell on them. When
some of the beds were closed the number of shell did not seem to increase at all. The spat did not seem
to settle on the ground. If you are on a ground with a lot of small shell on it, it might increase about
£ lb. or 1 lb. in weight in six or seven years. That is the only benefit you would derive from closure.
Besides, the grounds here have a natural protection from the strong south-easters and strong tides.
5267. Should any restriction be placed on the size of vessels employed in the industry? Ido not
think so.
5268. What maximum tonnage would you suggest? Vessels of from 12 to 15 tons arc good serviceable
vessels.
5269. Do such vessels make provision for the comfort of the diver and crew ? Everything.
5270. As much comfort as can be looked for in the industry? Yes.
5271. By Mr. Douglas ; Do you think the floating-station system is desirable with a view to the
protection of the grounds and their permanency ? No. They clear them out. The schooners anchor,
and the boats work all round them until that ground is completely worked out, and then they go
somewhere else; and the same process is repeated until there is nothing left. If a boat has no special
mark to go by, she drifts over the ground and loses the shell, and may not find it again until the next
week, and so on.
5272. Do you think the present condition of the beds is, to some extent, the result of the schooner
system ? I think so.
5273. That system tended to over-fish the beds more than the shore system of working ? Yes.
5274. Did your four boats keep together ? No; they went in different directions.
5275. You think it is desirable to prevent the floating-station system for the future ? Yes.
5276. It is more desirable that the boats should be worked in such a way that they cannot be kept
constantly on the ground ? Yes. It is most desirable in the interests of those who have to follow.
5277. By the Chairman-. Have you ever engaged in any experiments with a view' to the propagation of
the pearl oyster by cultivation? I have had some shell down, but I have not had experience enough to
give an opinion.
5278. Had you encouragement to continue your researches ? No.
5279. Would the services of a scientific man be of assistance in that direction? It is quite possible.
He might Study the tides, and know where the spat would go, and in that way it would be a good thing.
Of course the young oyster has many enemies, such as the trevalli.


5280. "Would the employment of a biologist be desirable in the interests of the industry? The
experiment is well worth trying.
5281. By Mr. Douglas : It is desirable to get as much information as possible on the subject of
cultivating the shell ? Yes.
5282. There is practically no information to go upon at the present time ? That is so.
5283. By the Chairman : You know that at present nearly all the divers are Japanese ? Pretty nearly all.
5284. Are you in favour of such a condition of affairs as that? No. I would like to see all white divers.
5285. How could such a condition of things be brought about gradually ? By limiting the number of
boat licenses.
5286. Would that have the desired effect ? I think it would enable the beds to recuperate in a year or two.
5287. By Mr. Bennett ; Thereby making it possible for white men to work the industry profitably ? Yes.
5288. By Mr. Douglas : "Would you renew the licenses of the present Japanese divers every year? Ido
not see how you could do anything else. The way the industry is now, they cannot do without them.
There are no white men to replace them.
5289. Would you suggest issuing no more divers’ licenses to other than Europeans ? That would be a
very good idea if you could get the white divers.
5290. You would not issue any more licenses to Japanese or other coloured aliens ? That is a very
difficult question to answer.
5291. How is the white diver system going to be brought about unless some such steps are taken?
There is not enough inducement. If the inducement were here, white divers would come without being
asked.
5292. But you think the first step is to limit the number of boats, so that the grounds will have an
opportunity of replenishing themselves ? Yes.
5293. When the average catch of shell becomes greater, possibly there might be a total restriction of
licenses to alien divers, and then white men would be forthcoming—They would see enough money in
it ? Yes ; but at the same time it is a very big question. This is not by a long way the only pearl-
shelling ground. There are big grounds elsewhere with which you have to compete.
5294. Of course, it depends a great deal on the price obtained for shell in London ? Yes.
5295. With 100 boats at work, as against 200 in the past with alien divers, probably those 100 boats
would get an average catch which would approximate 6or 7 tons a year? Yes. I believe that in about
five years, with 100 boats, the grounds would recuperate very much.
5296. By Mr. Bennett : The Old Ground would recuperate to something like its old state ? Yes ; and
so would all the grounds around here.
5297. By Mr. Douglas: Then the competition of shelling-beds in other parts of the world would be
immaterial, so long as the catch per boat averaged 6 or 7 tons, as it would pay them at London prices ?
Yes.
5298. Under those circumstances, the competition of shell raised by coloured labour would not make
much difference to this industry ? No.
5299. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think the industry can be worked with white crews as well as white
divers and tenders ? There is not money enough in it now, and there will not be for years to come, to
pay white crews. I have had white crews at £3 a month, but you could not get them now. There is
more work in the country now than there was in those days.
5300. Do you know the present size of exportable shell ? Eive inches.
5301. Do you know what it was formerly ? Six inches.
5302. Which do you consider preferable ? Six inches. When the limit was 6 inches, the divers picked
up a lot of shell, and when they found they were not 6 inches, they were thrown overboard. That had
the effect of keeping the grounds stocked.
5303. Were those that were found to be under 6 inches thrown overboard unopened? A good many were
opened ; but I think the larger number went overboard unopened.
5301. By Mr. Douglas : Have you found that the shell between 5 and 6 inches produces a larger number
of pearls than shell that is over 6 inches ? Not as many. In fact, Ido not think I ever found a pearl in
a shell between 5 and 6 inches.
5305. There are certain grounds that produce more pearls than others ? Yes.
5306. The reefs, for instance ? Yes.
5307. Did you work regularly amongst the reefs ? Yes.
5308. Did you obtain many pearls of fair value ? In some places like Mangrove Island, when I was
working four boats, I averaged about £4OO a year for the four boats. That is the best ground for pearls
in Torres Strait.
5309. Young shell does not produce pearls of much value ? No. It is very rarely that you get a pearl
in a small shell.
5310. Then there is nothing to be gained by the divers opening the small shell? No.
5311. By Mr. Bennett-. And they know that? Yes.
5312. By Mr. Douglas: Can you distinguish easily at the bottom what size a shell is ? Very well.
5313. By Mr. Bennett: By spanning it with your hand ? Yes.
5314. Is there any other indication, such as the young shell standing up more or less? It all depends on
the ground. Where there is a strong current on a hard bottom, they are all anchored. You find plenty of
6-inch shell that are fastened to the ground.
5315. AVould a diver who did not want to pick up shell for the sake of pearls pick up a shell which
he found anchored ? Yes, if he thought it was big enough.
5316. He could tell that by spanning it ? Yes, or he could tell by looking at it. If it is an inch under
the size, he can easily tell without touching it.
5317. By Mr. Douglas: Do the weeds on the Old Ground seriously interfere with obtaining shell ?
Some years they interfere more than others.
5318. When the weeds are thick and high on the Old Ground it is difficult to pick out the shell ? Yes.
5319. Does that afford some protection to the shell and enable it to grow ? Yes.
5320. Some years the weeds are thicker than others ? Yes.
5321. By Mr. Bennett: During what months is the Old Ground clear of weeds? Generally after a
north-wt ster in the beginning of the season. About September is the best time; but that is before the

. north-westers. You cannot work there after a north-wester. Of course March and April are the best
N months, if you can get a chance to work.
). 5322. You consider that the Old Ground is sufficiently protected by Nature without any other protection ?
I think so.
5323. By Mr. Douglas: You made some little experiment in cultivation ? Yes. I put a few shell down
off Prince of "Wales Island.
5324. You had a station on Prince of Wales Island ? Yes.
5325. Did you make any subsequent experiments ? I used to put a few shell down.
5326. By Mr. Bennett: Did they make any growth ? Yea ; but they did not increase in numbers.
5327. By Mr. Douglas : Does it matter on which side the shell is laid—the round or the flat ? No.
5328. Shell is found lying on either side ? Yes. The trevalli are continually turning them over on the
Old Ground, and picking up the small shell underneath, and a lot of little crabs that get under the shell.
The white fish do the same thing.
5329. You think they feed a great deal on the pearl-oyster ? Yes.
5330. By Mr. Bennett: What should be the average life of the ordinary diver at pearling ? With any
hind of care he should work from fifteen to twenty years.
5331. If he looks after himself ? Yes. That is in moderately shallow water.
5332. What do you consider moderately shallow water ? Fifteen fathoms and under.
5333. By the Chairman : After the period you have mentioned, would a diver bo unfit to engage in work
on shore ? Not at all.
5334. He can work as a diver without any injury to himself ? Yes.
5335. By Mr. Douglas: Since you first began diving has there been any improvement in the pumps,
pipes, or dress ? Nothing of any practical value. They make them a little stronger, and a little easier to
take to pieces ; but, so far as the giving of air is concerned, they are no better now than they were twenty-
five years ago.
5336. By Mr. Bennett: Or so far as relieving pressure is concerned? No.
5337. By Mr. Douglas : Do you find the cost of living is less than it was in the early days ? No ; it is
higher.
5338. That may be on account of the tariff ? Yes.
5339. But the living is better ? Yes.
5340. By Mr. Bennett: Have you worked with Papuan crews ? Yes.
5341. Are they suitable for crews ? Yes, very good.
5342. Are the Strait Island natives good for crews ? Not as good as the Papuans.
5343. Why? They will not stick to the work the same as Papuans.
6344. They are too near homo? Yes.
5345. Have you tried the mainland aboriginals—the Binghis ? Yes; they are no good.
5346. By Mr. Douglas'. Have you worked in the beche-de-mer industry at all? No.
5347. By Mr. Bennett • You have been diving at the “ Quetta ” wreck lately ? Yes.
5348. Have you found any pearl-shell on or in the wreck? I got two shells on the wreck, down on the
port rail on the lee side.
5349. What was the size of those shell ? About 7 inches.
5350. By Mr. Douglas ; You have been working at that wreck on and off for some time ? Yes.
5351. Did you find any shell there previously? No ; there is shell on the ground around there.
6352. Do you know of any other shell having been obtained by other divers on the wreck itself? I have
heard that Tolman got a shell or two there.
5353. That was two or theee years after the “ Quetta” went down? No ; it wasja good few years after
she went down—about 1896 or 1897.
5354. She was wrecked in 1890 ? He got the shell five or six years after she was wrecked.
5355. The shell obtained by him was 6or 7-inch shell ? I believe so.
Taira Kashiwaoi, Merchant and President of the Japanese Club, Thursday Island, examined:
5356. By the Chairman : What are you ? lam a merchant, and the representative of the Japanese Club.
5357. By Mr. Bennett: You are the president of the club ? Yes.
5358. By Mr. Douglas : Are the members of the club all divers ? Many of them are divers, and some
• are men who live on shore.
5359. How many members are there altogether? Pour hundred and fifty.
5360. Do you know the total number of Japanese on the Island and on the boats ? The Japanese
population here is about 760.
5361. Does that include all the men in the boats ? The men in the boats and on shore.
5362. By Mr. Bennett : Do you wish to make a statement as representative of the Japanese on Thursday
Island ? Yes.
5363. Have you written out that statement? Yes.
5364. Will you be good enough to read it ? Yes:—
In behalf of the Japanese residents in Thursday Island, I have the honour to give you evidence about the
pearl-shell fishing in Torres Strait. To the question of the possibility of encouraging white divers with a view to
their gradual substitution for aliens in that capacity, I would answer that, in the present condition of the shelling
industry, there is no possibility of encouraging the white divers with satisfactory reward for the energy, hardship,
and risk necessary.
The Fiest Pact.—lt is clearly explained by the fact of the past historical changes of the shelling industry. I
am told that there were about seventy white divers engaged during the early period in the shelling at Torres
Strait. In my experience, as a resident fourteen years, I have seen many divers of different nationalities, such as
Manila, Malay, and Eotumah divers. But at present the fact shows that not only white divers disappeared from
shelling. There are no other divers engaged at the shore station except Japanese, 'though some of them have
been able divers, yet they have been naturally changed; for they cannot compete in divers’capacity with Japanese.
The Second Pact.—ln the early period of the shelling there were abundant shells. So the employers did
not care so much for the diver’s ability as the present employers care for the choice of best divers, lest they should
suffer groat loss. This is the second fact —that all others have been gradually replaced by Japanese by the
employers, who must have suitable divers.
It is a very hard time for employers and employees to carry on the industry and labour with the low price
and scarcity of the shell, but the present lay system, with the divers bearing heavy responsibility of the men’s
wages and rations, and the suitable capacity of the Japanese divers, have been a great source of increase of catch

and of facilities to carry on the industry. Therefore, I w ould say, if the Japanese divers should be removed from
their present position, the shelling industry will perish in the near future.
In a foreign land wo do not like to monopolise the profession of the divers as Japanese property, and we
desire, if possible, to work together with white divers and all others, as it was before. But the natural law of
economics does not allow anyone to share it unless he has the following characteristics :
1. Hard worh. —He must work hard daily from daylight to twilight searching for shell.
2. Daring. —With fearless energy he must manage the boat everywhere to untouched grounds, and
take great risk in deep waters.
3. Hardship. —He must endure every hardship in a small boat; the monotonous life at the bottom of
the sea all day; at night,the restless rest tossing on boisterous water and often in want of fresh
food.
4. Experience. —He must have general experience for diving and thorough knowledge of the shelling-
grounds, as well as an ability for managing the boat.
5. Satisfaction with the following income and agreement made for 1908 between employers and
employees by present lay system : —•
SIIALLOW-WATEE DiVEE’s AgEEEMENT.
1. Diver to be paid at the rate of • eighty-two pounds ten shillings per ton for catches of four
tons (net) and under, and eighty-seven pounds ten shillings for catches exceeding four tons
(net).
2. All crew and tenders supplied to divers by the owners to be charged to the divers at current
rates.
3. Divers must find their own crews and tenders, but owners will assist as far as possible.
4. Shell to be weighed in diver’s presence, or in the presence of his authorised representative ;■ a
tare of eight pounds per cwt. to bo deducted from the gross weight. The owners reserve
the right, if they consider the shell not reasonably cleaned or dried, to have the shell
recleaned or dried previous to weighing, or to make a reasonable allowance accordingly.
5. Rations to be supplied by the owner and charged to the diver at annexed schedule, but
subject to market fluctuations.
6. Divers may have Japanese provisions up to, but not exceeding, three pounds per trip of about
ten weeks.
7. All boats to carry five crew besides diver and tender.
8. All shell won by diver or divers to bo the property of the owners'(entirely) of the boat or
fleet from which such diver or divers work, and must be delivered to such owners, their
agent, or representative when directed, on board any tender, or schooner, or ashore as
appointed for the purpose, at any time and at any place when called upon to do so. The
weight or tally of the shell to be taken and a receipt given to the diver, or his agent,
accordingly.
9. That dresses now in the boats bo charged to divers at valuation, and all new dresses, under-
clothing (except one now suit), and drift lines supplied to be charged to diver. At the end
of a diver’s term dresses handed to owners to be valued and credited to diver. If a diver’s
catch exceeds 4 tons net, the original dresses in the boats to be allowed diver free of charge.
In the case of new boats fitting out the diver to pay for one of the two new dresses
supplied with the boat, irrespective of catch.
10. That Daru, Boigo, and Saibai shell be paid for at the rate of sixty-two pounds ten shillings
per ton, and this rate appplied to the total catch of the boat if she has at any time during
the voyage worked m any such place.
11. All expenses (i.e. wages and provisioning) payable by divers shall be paid by themfromdate
of last squaring.
The above are the terms offered to shallow-water divers by the Pearl-shellers’ Association for working the
present year.

In conclusion, I can say that there are no possibilities to encourage white divers to the present shelling
industry with such low wages.
5805. By Mr. Douglas-. You do not include pearls, I suppose, in your estimate of the wages earned by
deep-water divers ? No. You cannot say what pearls they will get. Sometimes they will have some,
and sometimes they will have none. We have no record of pearls.
53GG. By Mr. Bennett-. What wages are paid to a Japanese tender? Four pounds a month.
53G7. Are there any pearl-shell fisheries in Japan ? No.
5868. By the Chairman : Is any shell sent to Japan to be manufactured P Ido not think so.
58G9. By Mr. Douglas: You could not give us an estimate of the value of pearls? No. Sometimes
one diver may get a big pearl, while others cannot get any.
5370. Do they send any pearls to Japan ? No.
5371. They sell them all here ? Yes.
5372. By Mr. Bennett: Are pearls much used in Japan as jewels ? Ido not think so.
5373. By Mr: Douglas: I notice that you have shown in your estimate provisions and wages for a full
twelve months—sometimes in the pay-off season in the end or beginning of the year there might be
some little delay—there might not be full provisions for the twelve months or full crews’ wages? You
will notice that the agreement says “ All expenses ( i.e ., wages and provisioning) payable by divers shall bo
paid by them from date of last squaring.” The diver must be responsible for the twelve months’
provisions and wages.
5374. By Mr. Bennett : What is the largest amount that you know of that has been earned by a diver
during the last year, including pearls and everything ? If a diver gets 6 tons, he will earn about £2OO,
but very few get that.
5375. But what was the largest amount earned by anyone man tint you know of during last year?
Some of them may have earned £l5O.
5376. By Mr. Douglas : Not counting pearls ? They never tell about pearls.
5377. By Mr. Bennett: You do not know? No.
5378. By Mr. Douglas: ..Do any of the Japanese divers wish to give any evidence? No ; they are all
working outside, and I do not think they will come in.
5379. We wish to obtain some information as to the state of the grounds, and whether it is difficult to
get shell now as compared with former years ? They speak about the grounds. At present the shell is
gradually growing. At Badu last springtime they could not work for about six months. They had to
leave the ground.
5380. For what reason can they not work ? Because the weather is so bad.


5381. Have you informatiou from any of the divers as to whether the recent earth tremors discoloured
the water on the Old Ground? I have not heard that.
5382. That is not an objection to working the Old Ground just now? Ido not think so. ,
5383. As a rule, a Japanese diver does not value his life very dearly—that is, he is prepared for risks in 1
deep water? Yes ; they take great risks. I always tell them that it is foolish to go down in deep water
and not to care for their lives, but it does not matter—they go all the same. If you go down to the
cemetery you will see many Japanese divers’ graves.
5384. Sooner or later all the deep-water divers die from diving in deep water? Yes. They must die
sooner or later.
5385. Do most of them recognise that sooner or later they will die in that way ? I do not think so. They
think that they will get money and go home all the sooner. They do not wish to work a long time in
diving.
5386. Do you know how many Japanese divers are licensed ? No.
5387. According to the official figures, 164 licenses were taken out this year by Japanese—Have any of
those divers returned to Japan since the beginning of the year ? Yes.
5388. Have they got permission from the Commonwealth to come back again? Yes.
5389. Does every free man obtain permission to return before leaving here ? Some of them apply for
permission, and some do not. The number of Japanese on the Island is decreasing.
5390. By Mr. Bennett-. Have any of the Japanese to go home for military or naval service ? Yes.
5391. How long do they have to serve ? Three years.
5392. If they have not completed their term of service before leaving Japan they have to go home to
complete it ? Yes.
5393. Or else they will not be allowed to return to Japan ? They begin at twenty-one. If any man
came from Japan and worked on the Island, and his twenty-first year came and he did not go back to
Japan, even if he stayed ten years in Torres Strait and then went back, he would still have to make gm.d
his service.
5394. Supposing a man has done his three years’ service in Japan, and he comes over here, has he any
further term to serve if he goes back to Japan ? No.
5395. By Mr. Douglas: I think you said that the information you have from the divers is that the shell
is growing more quickly on the grounds than it was previously ? Yes.
5396. Do you remember the time when the fleets went away to the Aroe Islands ? Yes ; about three
years ago. About 124 boats went to the Aroe Islands. At that time the shell was getting less and
less.
5397. You got that information from the divers ? Yes.
5398. And you think that was probably the reason why the fleets left ? Yes. There were too many
boats here.
5399. By Mr. Bennett : Did the divers think there were too many boats working here at that time ?
They did not say so.
5400. By Mr. Douglas : Still the shell was scarcer then than it is now? It was getting scarcer.
5401. Was there a scarcity of labour at that time ? Labour was scarce.
5402. Do you know the system under which the Commonwealth Government allow men to come here as
indented labourers for periods of three years ? Yes.
5403. If the employers comply with certain conditions, the Government give them permission to employ
so many men? Yes.
5404. Having regard to those conditions, do you think that labour was scarce at that time? Plenty of
indented men could be got.
5405. By Mr. Bennett : Did employers get plenty of indented men at that time ? Yes.
5406. There was no difficulty in doing so ? No.
5407. Are there plenty of Japanese who would like to come here and work under present conditions ?
Yes.
5408. By Mr. Douglas: Have they to send any portion of their money back to Japan? Young men at
home wish to come to work in the industry here, but when they come and work at shelling they say it is
too hard, and they want to go home all the time. They are sorry they came here.
5409. When in Japan they can get 30s. and 355. a month, and they think those good wages ? No ; there
are very good wages paid in Japan just now.
5410. By Mr. Bennett: Living is cheaper in Japan than it is here ? Yes.
5111. By Mr. Douglas: You say many Japanese, when they come here, are not very contented? Not
very contented. Last night I saw two men who are very discontented, and wish to go home.
5412. By Mr. Bennett: Are there any of the Kishu men coming over now ? Most of the men came
from Kishu, which is on the coast. They came from Wakayama Ken. Ken means district.
5413. By Mr. Douglas: They like Japanese food ? Yes; and they like Japanese rice.
5414. Is there a larger quantity of Japanese food imported here now than there was ten years ago?
Yes; a larger quantity is imported from Japan.
Reginald Hookings, Pearler, examined:
5415. By the Chairman: What are you ? A pearl-sheller— not a pearler.
5416. How many years have you been on Thursday Island ? I have been closely connected with the ]
pearl-shell industry for over ten years.
5417. As an employer ? Yes. /
5418. By Mr. Bennett: And boat-owner ? Yes.
5419. By the Chairman : You have had experience of all phases of the industry ? I have.
5420! Can you tell us how many boats are now engaged in the industry ? There are 108 pump boats.
542 L Can you give us any idea of the pro-cut condition of the pearling grounds ? I can. I had an
inspection made of them only this year. I suppose your question refers really to depletion? •
5422. Yes? I have prepared some notes dealing with the subject-matter of your inquiry,under different
heads: —
My principal reason for leaving Torres Strait was on account of the Government being unable to enforce
the carrying out of some regulations connected with the leasing of boats to aliens. Shortly after the leasing of
boats became illegal by special regulations, boats were worked under “ private agreements,” the diver becoming

'• responsible for the tender’s and two crew’s wages—an amount about equal to the rent previously charged for the
s, lease of a boat—an agreement which, I think, abuses the spirit of the Government regulation. This gave the
8, alien diver an interest in the earning power of the boat, and it tempted the more enterprising alien divers to sue
for equal terms ; and when one owner was not checked others followed suit under pressure from their divers.
5423. Do you refer to the present agreement between the Japanese diver and the owner ? No. This is
coming up to that—
From 1899 onward “private agreements” prevailed supreme, varying much in character, but undoubtedly
abusing the meaning and spirit of the new regulations. Competition between owners for good divers became
very keen. The stations who looked after their own boats and collected their own pearls had to increase the rates
of lay on shell and increase their cash advances to a fabulous amount in order to retain their divers from the
overtures of other owners tempting their divers with ownership of the catch of pearls, and being their own
masters afloat, &c. A firm carrying out the regulations could not exist against this competition.
Tou have referred to the question of depletion of the beds, and I shall now read what I have written on
that subject—
Depletion. —l have no fear of this coming about to the beds of Torres Strait. Natural protection has done
its work successfully in the past, and will do it in the future.
We have strong winds and strong tides, the settlement of sediment on the beds, the periodical grasses and
mosses—all tend to protect the shells from view at times.
If the shell becomes thinned out it becomes unpayable, and consequently that portion is left, and the beds
have an opportunity to recuperate.
Since I returned to Torres Strait this year I had the “ Old Ground” reported on, with a result that
confirms my previous opinion. There is shell in and outside Australian waters that could be worked from Thurs-
day Island, leaving plenty room for experimenting with white divers without interfering seriously with the
industry, and making Thursday Island the commercial centre it deserves to be.
5424. By Mr. Bennett: Are the beds depleted ? No.
5425. Have they been depleted ? No.
5426. Has the supply of shell at any time become so small as to be unremunerative ? No.
5427. Never? Never.
5428. By the Chairman : What do you assign as the cause of the departure of the Clark Syndicate from
here ? I cannot answer for the Clark combination, but I will answer for myself. They have given their
own reasons, and I will not interfere with them. I left Thursday Island to prospect for other beds. My
principal reason for leaving was on account of the Queensland Government failing to carry out the laws
and regulations pertaining to the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries.
5429. In what respect did the Government fail ? In 1898 they passed regulations, which came into effect
in 1899, making the leasing of boats to aliens illegal.
543 U. By Mr. Bennett: What regulations ? The regulations under the Act of 1899 prohibiting a license
or any beneficial interest from becoming the property of an alien. Aliens live cheaper, and fish when
our men sleep; and I do not think it is good enough to attempt to compete with them—
Apparently it is impossible for the Government to carry out their regulations, if after legislating in favour
of Britishers, some boat-owners are prepared to nominally transfer their fishing rights for pearls under “private
agreements” which may be difficult to prove.
In my opinion the ownership ot pearls fished from our national banks has been gradually given up to the
foreign diver by an unwritten agreement, to attract good men who are not only divers but shrewd business men,
who can entirely manage the fishing business in connection with the boats they are put in charge of. This is borne
out plainly under the present agreement the boats are working under, and constitutes the principal
question of to-day in shelling :
“ Will the Government submit to a British boat-owner allowing a foreigner to fish and own pearls in the
Britisher’s boat, licensed to the Britisher only, and when the foreigner by law is not allowed to fish on his own
account from any of our national beds?”
5431. What is the law which enacts the prohibition of which you spoke? The one where it says an
alien cannot acquire any beneficial interest.
5432. Tou consider that under this agreement he holds a beneficial interest in the vessel ? I do not
think that Act refers to the vessel at all.
5433. I am only asking you, because it is just as well to understand these things thoroughly—Do you
consider that the agreement confers on the Japanese a beneficial interest in the vessel ? Undoubtedly ;
because the vessel is a lump of wood, and without the earning power of the vessel I consider it is so much
firewood.
5434. By the Chairman ; Tou refer especially to the system at present in existence, whereby the
Japanese diver goes out in a boat belonging to a white man ? Tes.
5435. By Mr. Douglas-. I notice you refer tofishing for pearls—Do you mean pearl-shell ? I mean pearls
°nly-
-5436. Are pearls the primary factor in the industry here ? They are the factor in which there is the most
profit.
5437. But is the industry worked here more particularly for the catch of pearls ? No. Pearls cannot
be got without a certain amount of shell; but lam not dealing with the shell. I say that the illegality,
or where it was unfair to us, was that these men were able to fish, and I especially mention the species of
product where the benefit comes in. Ihe alien certainly gets a “ lay” on his shell.
5438. But does he participate to the full value of the shell —It is admitted that the owners give the divers
the pearls, and they get what they can for them ? Ido not wish to say that.
5439. But they admit it in evidence? I did not know that they admitted that the pearls are the property
of the divers.
5440. The owner does not say that he gives the pearls to them ? No ; The divers get them themselves.
5441. Tou are not referring to the shell at all ? No.
5442. Tou know the system on which they are working the shell ? I have nothing to say about the shell.
Whatever lay they pay the divers, that is their business.
5443. Is the principal object in working this industry the getting of pearls or pearl-shell ? As a boat-
owner, I take it that the principal object for which it is worked is nrotit, and most of the profit rests in
the pearls.


5444. Do all grounds produce the same number and value of pearls, or are there certain grounds which
are more prolific in pearls than others ? Certain grounds are more prolific than others, undoubtedly.
5445. Are there not grounds where the men fish for the shell without much hope of getting pearls?
They no doubt fish for the shell as a product; hut, speaking for myself, I never fish for shell without
some idea of getting pearls. That is my sole temptation. Take that away, and I have no wish to work.
5446. By the Chairman : Was that one of the inducements which led you to go to the Aroe Islands ? I
have told you the reason why I went there.
5447. You said that one reason why you went there was that you objected to the system existing here of
giving licenses to boats, and the non-observance of the rules you have referred to ? Generally speaking,
the failure of the Government to carry out their regulations. I do not blame them, but that was my
primary reason for leaving Australia.
5448. Was there no other reason ? To try to better myself, of course. But, if I could have done well
enough here, I would not have tried to better myself elsewhere.
5449. If there had been no inducement to go to the Aroe Islands, you would not have departed from
Thursday Island ? Just prior to the sailing of the fleet from Thursday Island, I wired to Mr. Clark that
I was prepared to stay on and work here.
5450. You were getting good remuneration for your work at pearling ? It was a very bad year, and I
would not call it good remuneration, but I was satisfied to stop here.
5451. Did you encounter any difficulty in obtaining labour? None whatever.
5452. Do you know if the Clark syndicate did ? I could not answer that question.
5456. I presume you know something about their reasons for leaving? Only hearsay.
5454. By Mr. Douglas: We are to take it, then, that the primary object of profit is the pearls ? Yes.
5455. By Mr. Bennett: You expect to get most of your profit from the pearls ? I do.
5456. By the Chairman: Leaving out the question of pearls, cannot shelling be carried on in a
remunerative way at Thursday Island ? It would, perhaps, be got in payable quantities, but the
remuneration would not be good. That is proved by the present working of the industry. Shall Igo on
with my statement ?
5457. If you please ?
The question of spoon-feeding a few whites into the industry by bounty with doubtful results, except in
isolated eases, has no significance compared to this question of aliens fishing and owning pearls from our national
beds; and I sincerely hope the Commissioners will bring this under the notice of the Hon. the Treasurer on his
arrival here and recommend immediate action.
5458. By Mr. Bennett : In what direction ? To prevent these aliens taking away the product of our
national beds in the shape of pearls, which are very valuable.
5459. By the Chairman : We want to conserve the industry for white men ? If you allow these men to
rob it first, it will be like shutting the stable door when the horse is gone —
Under the 1898 Act the status of the licensees, after infringements, may be questioned. The filtering of
wealth from our bed is serious. Take 1907, for instance : There were 100 odd pump boats licensed, and more
money was sent away to foreign climes under the present mode of working than in previous years, when over 300
boats were licensed, and owners claimed pearls. In the money sent away last year some £3,000 worth of
pearls must have been included.
5460. How do you arrive at that estimate —Have you any evidence to support it ? Yes, I have. I may
tell you that I have been buying a good many pearls.
5461. By Mr. Douglas ; Is that estimate of £B,OOO based on the present market price of pearls ? That
is the amount of money which I consider was sent out to foreign countries in 1907.
5462. Is it possible to place a value upon a pearl of large size? Yes, a value.
5463. The value of pearls fluctuates enormously, does it not? Yes. The value of some classes of
pearls is from 30 to 50 per cent, lower than it was two years ago.
5464. Then that £B,OOO is based on a low value for pearls ? No ; it is based on what I consider they
got for the pearls.
5465. That is what they sold the pearls for ? It is the money sent away.
5466. They would have been sold locally for that price ? Ses. There were some went away, too.
5467. Some pearls obtained here were not actually sold at Thursday Island ? In my opinion, no.
5468. Do you estimate that that £B,OOO was the amount paid by the local dealers in pearls to the divers
who obtained the pearls? 'No. I have made a rough estimate of the value of the pearls which I think
drifted away, and were not sold here.
5469. Is that the value the owners of the pearls would expect to get on the market? No. It is my
estimate of the value of the pearls sold here last year. Now, referring to the regulations which were a
source of worry to me :
I wish it clearly understood I do not infer the present boat-owner wishes to evade the regulations, or that he
is one to give away portion of his catch with that view.
It appears to mo the present agreements are made by the present owners to obtain personal comforts on
shore, and to shelve part of their liability in the fishing venture on to the alien.
The agreement may be open to criticism, and, alter last January strike, it is clearly evident the present
boat-owner is not the master of ceremonies he previously posed to be upon the ruling of what are supposed
to be his shelling affairs. When any alterations are being considered in regard to business afloat, I think it is
more than desirable to first try and purify conditions on shore, especially in pearl-trucking.
5470. By the Chairman : Do you refer to the shore stations? No; to persons residing on the shore.
There are chances on Thursday Island which induce the men to steal the pearls. You have only to come
on shore, and you are overrun by people who are anxious to make “ a bean” out of a pearl, and I think
that should not be allowed —
Another example of regulations being made and not carried out was when Endeavour Strait was closed by
the Government as a fishing-ground some five years ago. Boats which had no supervision afloat gradually increased
in numbers, poaching on this area, until the regulation was a farce and the closure expired.
Further, some years ago the Government forbade the traffic in pearls, except to licensed dealers, who were
required to pay an annual license fee of £25. Now, take last year as an example : There were over 120 foreigners
who worked on our fishing banks as divers. These people all trade in pearls, and openly enough. They are not
boat-owners, and are without any license to trade in pearls. By this means some £3,000 was lost to the State
revenue, and our regulations, or the wording of them, ridiculed,

nJhnM9OB.
It should not be difficult for the Government to see there is something wrong in the working of the industry
when they get a revenue of £6OO per annum from boat licenses, and they have been offered £5,000 per annum
and all fees paid, for an extended lease of the banks, by Mr. James Clark.
5471. By Mr. Douglas: You claim that tho Queensland Government lost something like £3,000 last year
through not making all tho divers who have sold pearls take out pearl-dealers’ licenses? They have all
dealt in pearls, every way.
5472. Do you think they should pay a license fee of £25 each per annum ? It is either one thing or the
other. If these people arc not boat-owners, we have lost that value from our national beds without
getting any return. If they a>e entitled to fish for pearls, they should pay the license fee to deal in
pearls.
5173. I cannot see where the Government have lost £3,000? All these divers are both buying and selling
pearls here on a large scale.
5174. Amongst themselves ? Yes. Last year one Japanese had a pearl-dealer’s license. My contention
is that they truck in pearls among themselves.
5475. You do not contend that a diver who sells a pearl to a licensed dealer—no matter how he comes by
it—is doing any thing wrong ? Not unless he has come by it in a wrong way. It would be all right if he
was a boat-owner.
5476. By Mr. Bennett: If a man steals a pearl and sells it, he is entirely in the wrong ? If he comes by
it in a wrong way, he is in the wrong. A man with a pearl for sale is not legally entitled to it if he is not
a licensed boat-owner.
5477. By Mr. Douglas: You know that a District Court judge has decided that the pearl-shell oyster is a
thing that is not capable of being stolen? Yes ;*but he did not give a decision with regard to a pearl.
A pearl is not an animal, any more than a sovereign is.
5478. It is part of an animal ? I wish it was —I would not be here if every pearl-shell oyster contained
a pearl.
5479. Pearls are found embedded in the flesh of the oyster? Not necessarily. They are found on , and
off the shell.
5480. But they are also found embedded in the oyster ? It is possible to get one there.
5481. So that the pearl is part of the pearl-oyster ? No.
5482. In some cases ? If a man had a bullet inside of him, the bullet would not be a part of him. It is
a foreign substance, and a pearl is foreign to the oyster.
5483. By the Chairman : "Will you go on with your reading ?
If the Government do not intend to give the industry the attention it requires, it would be better to divide
the area up and sell leased areas for a fixed term of years to tho highest bidder, after clearly setting out the
conditions under which the beds are to be worked. The Government would reap a ten-fold revenue to what it
does now, and tho cream of any profit would remain in the country.
Of course, the leases would give the present boat-owners, large and small, an opportunity to come in.
Cultivation. —l am a strong believer in cultivation—the greatest difficulty seems to be when the spat is
first shed from the pearl-oyster and remains in a state of buoyancy. I, for one, considering the little we know of
pearl-oj-ster spat scientifically, am prepared to let the Government have a lone hand in catchment. A private
individual has no show or protection. Any catchment apparatus may be knocked down by a stray fishing boat,
a floating log, a shoal of fish, turtles, sharks, dugongs, or alligators. We can put no protection up in the highway,
therefore it is entirely a matter for the Government. The spawn, in its early stage, I fancy, too, is fine feed for
innumerable amphibious animals or fish, and when converted into small shell is assailed, to my knowledge, by
crabs, large fish, and turtles. I have got small parts of pearl-shell oyster in the bowels of these animals, and 1 have
seen the crabs cracking them. A nother great drawback to cultivation in some areas is the shifting bottom
formation, which is always possible where there are strong tides, strong winds from either point of the compass,
and, when landlocked, heavy rainfall and drainage, and settlement of sediment. Taking the reports of divers
in my employ, I know of instances in Torres Strait where there has been an immense deposit of chicken-shell;
two years later I visited the same place with great expectations of a good catch ; but, alas ! the bottom was changed,
and not a single shell visible.
5484. By Mr. Douglas Eeferring to Mr. Clark’s offer to pay £5,000 a year for the beds, he said that he
would require a lease of the grounds for twenty or thirty years? I particularly mentioned an extended
lease.
5485. But he had some hesitation in stating that he would keep the Customs revenue up to the average
yearly income of £15,000? He said he was prepared to give £5,000 rent for the banks.
5486. He is prepared to pay the usual duties ? lam talking about oyster banks, not the duties.
5487. But the Queensland Government do not look solely to the license fees in this industry—surely they
also look to the Customs revenue ? Well, his employees must eat just the same as others.
5488. But he could close the beds and stop the industry for five years ? The Government know their
own business, and this would be a matter of detail for them to specify in their terms.
5489. By the Chairman: Is he prepared to carry on the industry under those conditions with white
labour? I hat is a question you had better ask him. I could not say. If the Government are not
going to give this matter the attention it warrants, it would be better to consider the advisability of letting
these places as leaseholds. I do not say in a hig leasehold, but in leaseholds whereby all those at
present in the industry can come in and pay for areas.
5490. By Mr. Bennett : In the same way as the edible oyster beds are disposed of? Yes. The Govern-
ment ought to turn it into a revenue-producing industry by leasing certain areas for a fixed term of
years, selling the leaseholds at public auction to the highest bidder.
5491. By the Chairman : There is this difference between the two cases, inasmuch as in this industry they
could employ what labour they liked ? The Government can lay down what the conditions shall be.
Continuing my remarks about cultivation:
At other places I have visited I have found the beds are covered with quantities of full-sized shells all
dead. Notwithstanding all these difficulties, lam of opinion our scientist of to-day will succeed in catching the
spat of our pearl-oyster; but he must have appliances and authority to close his catchment area from traffic.
The next question I deal with is that of a biologist.
5492. By the Chairman: Were you here when Mr. Tosh and Mr. Saville Kent were conducting their
researches ? I was here when both of them were here—Mr. Tosh especially.


5493. Can you tell us anything about Mr. Tosh’s experiences. Yes. This is what I have written :
Biologist. —Only on condition of the Government seeing its way clear to follow up all branches of the
• industry, and sec all regulations are carried out, is it advisable to engage a scientist.
tip to the present it is well known the industry is of little consequence to the Government compared with
other matters claiming first attention.
Without the advice of a scientific biologist, there will, in my opinion, bo no cultivation. His services are
essential for its success, and he must have appliances for its success. We had a biologist some few years
ago, with apparently no good result. I saw a good deal of him, and ho was anxious to experiment and be
successful. He was most anxious (apart from personal notoriety and gain to himself) to make some advancement
scientifically for the Scottish University he came from.
His experiences are not generally known. After some delay he was fitted up with a small craft, which was
unsuitable for the purpose. Operations were confined to near the shore on that account. Most of the shells
obtained died before they were transplanted, and others died soon after —I believe on account of the time the shell
was in transit. Mr. Tosh then tried unsuccessfully to purchase full-sized shells to operate on. I believe one
individual asked £5O for unopened shells.
Mr. Bennett, then Sub-Collector of Customs at Thursday Island, gave permission to a private boat to pick
up some chicken-shells for Mr. Tosh, which, with the few ho had saved previously, were transplanted near a
creek successfully. Mr. Tosh shortly after left for Brisbane. The experiment cannot be called a fair one to
science or the industry.
5494. Do you think his researches gave promise of any successful results ? He was undoubtedly hopeful.
It is no use engaging a scientist if he is not provided with a boat to bring his shell in and other requisites
to enable him to carry on his experiments. So much for a biologist. With regard now to making this a
white man’s industry :
In my opinion the Government should not at present force entirely white labour into the industry. In
Australia we have not enough people to populate our fertile lands or to carry on our expanding industries. It
is better for the Government, in my opinion, to foster an industry Australia can compete in successfully against
the outside world. That industry is not shelling. This opinion seems to bo borne out by our representatives,
because they gave no effect to the resolution carried by the Senate in November, 1905. Shelling costs more
financially to enter and for upkeep, and is more risky, personally and financially, than most other industries in
Australia. The life, constantly afloat, is not congenial. The greatest difficulty, however, is the lost time waiting
for suitable weather and water. This does not suit many Britishers as principals, and this lost time is the great
problem for the boat-owners of to-day. They cannot pay a good wage to a white man when their actual work at
shelling is about one-third of a year, with two-thirds watching for a chance to work. With reference to the
opinion I have expressed on the question of making this a white man’s industry, I may quote the resolution of the
Federal Senate on 30th November, 1905: —
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the time has arrived when, in order to effectively carry out the
policy of a white Australia, legislation should be introduced to provide for ... (6) The
assisting of the industry, by bonus or otherwise, to enable the replacement of the coloured
labour by white labour.
That was never given effect to. I presume they were of opinion that more important matters claimed the
attention of the Government.
It is useless offering a bonus on shell raised by white divers unless a white diver is provided with a
boat and means to carry on work to enable him to raise the shell and earn the bonus.
Unless the Government arrange to provide boats and upkeep, we will have no successful introduction
of white divers.
If the State Government insist on a trial of white divers, they are welcome to my views towards the least
expense of a trial and the greatest prospect of success combined :
Obtain a boat from each of the five largest owners on the same terms now offered by them to aliens, and
guarantee to the owner an average return equal to the average returns of aliens employed by him during the same
period.
The present owner may make equal to about £2O per ton on the catch of shell, but the profit is very
doubtful, because he takes all risk at present of market fluctuations and the quality of the shell obtained. Under
this arrangement, say the alien boats during a year fished 5 tons shell on the average, and the white diver 3 tons, the
Government would be responsible to the boat-owner for 2 tons shell profit at £2o=£-10.
The Government may n6t lose this amount, or in fact any amount, because there may be some pearls found
by the white diver, and the first charge on these should be any liability the Government undertake in providing the
man with a boat. If the introduction could not succeed on those lines, I, for one, would have little faith in their
future success. If it is decided to try this arrangement, the boat-owner should not be asked to risk credit against
the shell “ take ” for more stores than he risks to the alien at present; and, if the white diver requires any special
stores, the Government should guarantee up to £lO or £l5 for this purpose.
At present the boat-owner does not ask the alien diver for any surety for supply of stores beyond the
sale of produce through him. He asks for no guarantee for crews’ wages ; no insurance on his boat; no amount
for depreciation of his boat; no interest on the capital invested on the boat and gear ;no amount for repairs or
upkeep of the boat.
Considering all things, 1 feel confident the Government could not improve on this arrangement if the
Commission decide to advise the Government to make the trial.
If after one or two years the inspector reports favourably on the trial, then introduce a regulation making
licenses of boats subject to the introduction of white divers, on a scale following. lam very dubious about the
wholesale successful introduction of white divers, but I have promised to try and devise a scheme which might be
successful. If the Commissioners should decide to advocate it, my own idea of a trial for white divers is in a
much more mild form under the heading of “ (Recommendations.”
5495. By Mr. Bennett ■. You are aware, I suppose, that the Federal Parliament cannot interfere in the
pearl-shell fishery ? Yes. But they can make recommendations, and if the representatives of the people
back up these recommendations they will be carried out.
549 G. iho Federal Parliament cannot interfere in the sea fisheries until they are taken over by the
Commonwealth ? That is so —
It is a great pity the last report made on pearl-shelling by Mr. Lockyer, now acting Comptroller of Customs
for the Federal authorities, was not made public. lam sure the Commissioners would obtain some very useful
information in that report. To interfere with the present labour to any extent I think inadvisable, because we
have no white substitute available, nor have we any whites clamouring for this class of work. Our- local Waterside
Union members, who ought to know the conditions, do not seek for the class of work—a fact I consider
worthy of notice. Further, our Federal members, after their trip to Thursday Island, Darwin, and the Northern
Territory last year, have taken no action regarding the Senate’s previous recommendation of November, 1905, and
this is a significant indication of the opinion they formed,

B. Hoetings.
17 June, 1908.
The latest record of a special inspection is contained in Judge Dashwood’s very able report of 1901. Since
either this or Mr. Lockyer’s later private report, the method of working our industry has considerably changed,
, and, to my mind, it has altered from shelling to pearling. I leave all and sundry to judge if my opinion is right
or wrong by considering the following present conditions : —A boat is fitted out, and a diver is sent away to work
under no control whatever. All the pearls he finds are entirely his own; all the shells ho finds are the owners’,
less an amount for his Jay. He will, of course, potter around the reefs where pearls are most numerous —and
shell is generally scarce there. The boat-owner will be treated to the shells he finds in the diver’s search for the
pearls. In carrying out tliis pearling of to-day, boats are not far away from land, they are fitted out for short
periods only, often visit the city of Wyben, can only work week about on account of strong tides, and generally
work in shallow water.
White men could stand a lot of this work if it were reserved to them (sec my recommendation). If the
Government would devise some means for the present owners to oblain their pearls, t do not think there would
be much outcry from the boat-owners if the areas were reserved for whites ; and the present diver cannot complain
if he receives what he has agreed to, and which written agreement does not include the diver’s ownership of the
pearls found by him.
I might here say it would be impossible for the boat-owner to obtain his pearls without a drastic purifica-
tion of conditions on Thursday Island, where there are innumerable persons of various nationalities always too
pressing to share in the disposal of a stolen pearl or be the means of filtering it secretly away to other and safer
climes.
I would like the Commission to consider that aspect of the matter very seriously. I can assure you it is
most difficult to trace a pearl once it gets to Thursday Island.
Dealing with boat-owners, as I point out later, the person who happened to be licensed in 1907 should have
no monopoly, and in this scheme any owner who comes in at any period ranks on the same ratio as to white or
alien divers as the person who is working when the scheme is introduced. Ido not wish to hide the fact that an
owner coming in later would most likely increase the alien production; at the same time he must provide his share
of whites as from the time of commencement the other owner started to introduce whites.
In this scheme, taking 128 boats, in five years we would require forty-two whites and eighty-six aliens —
First year 6 whites
Second year ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 9 „
Third year ... ... ... ... ... 9 „
Fourth year 8 „
Fifth year 10 „
• ~~
42 „ (five years.)
In ten years we would require eighty-four whites, forty-four aliens.
If a scheme to bring about all white divers in ten years were introduced, we would require in five years
64, in ten years 128, which I do not think likely to be obtained.
In this scale based on 128 boats, the small boat-owner receives an advantage in its early stages, and
the larger boat-owner in the later stages.
If the scheme did not answer at any time, it could be cancelled without serious results.
In five years, among nine owners, there would be forty-two boats working in the industry with Britishers,
or that quantity reduced in our shelling, at the rate of — for the first year, six; the second year, nine ; third year,
nine ; fourth year, eight; and the fifth year, ten = forty-two boats.
The Government, meantime, might assist in coaching divers on their cultivation area.
If a boat-owner came into the industry in three years’ time, it would be compulsory for him to have two
white divers to enable six boats to work.
If a boat-owner came in with one boat in the third year, and increased his boats to three in the fifth year, it
would be compulsory for liim to engage two British divers to enable him to work.
5497. You do not think it possible to bring in 128 white divers in ten years ? I do not think so. The scheme
provides that owners of between twenty and forty boats shall find two white divers every year, so that in
ten years they will have to find twenty white divers. The owners of from ten to twenty boats will have
to provide one additional white diver every year, or a total of ten in ten years. The owner of from nine
down to five boats will be excused for the first year, but will, with time, introduce the same average of
white divers. That treats all the owners alike, whether they come in now or whether they come into
the industry later on—
I have aimed at a scheme which would bo regular and determined, to enable owners to provide, if possible,
in advance for requirements, and one that might be feasible in execution.
All boats which, by effluxion of time, have been registered for white divers only, must be carefully
recorded as such, and, no matter if they be sold, wrecked, rebuilt, or renamed, must not be eligible for service in
the shelling industry unless in charge of a British subject.
5498. I presume you mean in charge of a white diver? I take it that is so. I mean a white man in
charge.


5499. I take it that you mean a European ? Yes; I mean the man who owns the boat—
Under this scheme or otherwise it would be much preferable, and I strongly recommend, that all divers’
licenses be granted or renewed through the requisition of the boat-owner entitled to engage the divers.
By this means the boat-owner, who is a British subject, is refused the license if not in order, and it does away
with any international distinction regarding subjects of foreign Powers. It gives the boat-owner a free choice to
engage whom he consi levs most suitable. If any foreign diver misconducted himself, it would be most unfortunate
if the owner must engage that individual or nobody.
It does away with the individuality and allows a substitute in person only, but no increase in number of
boats. It counteracts any epidemic of sickness, and, in case oh-Tapanese, any special call for war requirements in
their country. It does away with monopoly and any chances of individual collusion with the person who happened
to be licensed in 1907. It covers a possibility of shortage in divers through unfortunate accident, which, with
departures oversea, would soon leave the boat-owners without divers. It will ensure a chance of supply to keep
the industry going while Britishers are being tried or schooled, but cannot increase the number of boats to be
worked. To restrict the issue of licenses to divers, excepting those licensed for 1907, would be unfair to those
who may have decided to take a trip to regain their health during that year, and it would be illegal, in some cases,
according to section 4 of the August, 1899, Act.
It may be interesting to the Commission to know I have divers now working for me who were registered
prior to this Act, and who are legally entitled to renew their licenses. A man who had rights prior to that year
cannot be disturbed.
5500. Are you speaking of divers or boat-owners ? Divers in this instance.
5501. Are divers mentioned in that section ? I may be wrong.
5502. Section 4 reads: “ Nothing in this Act shall prejudice the rights of any person who was at any
time during the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight legally licensed in respect of any
ship or boat engaged in the fishery, and nothing in this Act shall operate to prevent the renewal of a
license to any such person in the same manner in all respects as if this Act had not been passed ” P
The next subject I have to deal with is that of licenses—
I believe in freedom to all boat-owners who have engaged in this industry, or who arc prepared to enter
under existing local laws. It is fairly safe to make preparations, in anticipation of the Commonwealth taking over
the fisheries later on, and provision should be made for any boats of the other States that may wish to come to these
waters, or we go to their waters. I think it would be well to classify the industry under two divisions—Division 1
to include certain areas within 3 miles from shore, as the Commission or inspectors may decide on, carefully
considering the boat-owner’s position now and from time to time later on. This area could be reserved for
white divers’ cultivation and leasehold. Division 2 to cover any area not included in Division 1, and should
have sufficient sheltered areas to enable present boats to work on during heavy weather. This area should bo open
to all owners for diving purposes, except any leasehold area which from time to time may be taken up from the
Government.
5503. That would he outside the 3-mile limit ? Yes. The difficulty the Government have always had
is in supervising closed areas. To get over that, I suggest that—
The Government close for cultivation areas all beds from south-west end of Prince of Wales Island to 3 miles
westward, ant in a direct line striking a point 3 miles westward off the most western end of Badu; thence using
the southern end of Badu and Mua to 3 miles eastward from the south end of Mua; thence on to a line 3 miles east
from south-east end of Horn Island; thence along the southern ghores ol Horn. Entrance, and Prince of Wales Islands
to the point of commencement, overlooked by Goode Island. I further suggest that portions of the foreshores in
and out of the cultivation area or on any island be leased for cultivation or station areas; such leases to be
sold by public auction after being advertised.
5504. By the Chairman : Would that not favour the capitalist? Not at all.
5505. You said the leases should be sold by “ public auction ” ? Yes.
5506. Then the man with the most money could outbid the man of small means? There are hundreds
of places in Torres Strait where you could make stations, and a man who has got plenty of money is not
going to make a station on shore. I also suggest—
That, pending definite methods of spat catchment, the removal of a limited amount of chicken-shell from
beyond 6 miles from any land be allowed, when suitable transit is found and under Government supervision.
That the Government restock with chicken-shells portion of the area reserved for cultivation.
That there should be Government inspection of all beds, and that the removal of chicken-shell be carried
out by white crews, divers, and tenders; and the transfer of chicken-shell to private beds be done with white
divers.
That boats with white divers be allowed to fish in all waters except where chicken-shell has been laid, and
be exempt from license fees.
5507. By the Chairman : You are referring to the white diver as an employee ? He can be either an
owner or an employee.
5508. Supposing two white men owned a boat ? lam afraid there are few such men who have money to
go in for a boat. Without a boat they do not get any show.
5509. You do not think it is possible to induce such men to come hero—ls it not an inducement to
reserve ground for them, to exempt them from fees, and for the Government to provide them with
boats? Dealing now with the objects of the Commission, I think the Government could assist in the
accomplishmentof the first object —that is, to avoid the depletion of the beds, and to make the industry
regular and permanent —by supplying means to enforce the carrying out of their regulations continuously.
5510. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think it advisable to limit the number of vessels working the beds ?
No If the conditions are not payable people will not enter into the industry, and some who have
entered the industry will go away. Ido not think there is any possibility of the beds being depleted,
though they may be thinned. . Q „ . ,
5511 Would the present number of boats stand increasing ? Certainly.
5512 And work the grounds remuneratively ? Certainly—the beds outside and inside. There is room
for more and if we do not work the beds somebody else will. I would like to see Thursday Island made
the centre of commerce in these waters. . . , .., 9 rp, , ,
5513 Bv Mr Bennett-. What do you mean by the beds outside i Ihe beds outside our waters.
5514 Are there beds outside our own waters capable of being worked ? Yes.
5515.’ What is the depth of the water ? Two to 5 fathoms in some places.
551 G. Where? Down the coast of New Guinea.
5517. By the Chairman: Dutch New Guinea. No.

5518. By Mr. Bennett: Is that shell of the best quality ? It is of good quality. A lot has been brought
in here, and no questions have been raised about its quality.
5519. By the Chairman : Are you in favour of securing the services of a practical biologist ? Tes ; I have
said so, and have expressed the opinion that no cultivation experiment will succeed unless it is made
scientifically. I do not see any necessity for closing the alien out of the industry. On this point I make
the following remarks:—
The alien has been profitable to the white owners, and, in my opinion, should be considered, at least until it
is proved there are sufficient white divers available. Properly regulated, both could be employed to profit,
because the beds are so extensive.

Peesent:
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. g. h. b^nnett.
Eeginald Hookings, Pearler, further examined :
5520. By the Chairman: You said yesterday that you have been ten years engaged in the pearl-shell
industry? Yes.
5521. How many boats do vou own ? Personally?
5522. Yes? Ten.
5523. They are solely your own property ? Yes, at the present time.
5524. Ho other person is interested in them ? Not in the slightest degree.
5525. Are you interested in any other fleet ? Barring liquidation, in no other fleet.
5526. You are not interested in any way in any other fleet? No, except for liquidation purposes.
5527. What do you mean by liquidation ? I have just dissolved partnership.
5528. Then you mean winding-up ? Yes.
5529. Beyond that, you have no interest in any boats other than the ten you own ? No.
5530. With reference to the scheme which you have submitted for the consideration of the Commission
—How long would it take under that scheme to make the industry a white man’s industry? 1 cannot
answer that question. Without some results as a basis for calculation, I could not form an opinion.
5531. You spoke of ten years ? Yes.
5532. Then it would be problematical even at the end of ten years ? It would remain with the
Government to determine that. They would have power to alter things as they thought fit after the
scheme was put into operation.
5533. Do you think the Government would protract the decision of that question, seeing that a similar
question in connection with the sugar industry was settled in two years —There can be no comparison
between the two industries as regards the amount of money invested in them ? No ; there is no analogy at
all, because in the case of the sugar industry you can pay as much bounty and charge as much excise on the
sugar as you choose, seeing that the market is within the Commonwealth. You can do that until the
sugar has to be exported. Then the difficulty will be felt. On the other hand, pearl-shell is not used to
any extent in Australia, and ail our shell has to compete against foreign supplies.
5534. You depend very much on the assistance the Government may give the industry? In which
direction ?
5535. By bounty ? No. By supplying boats —by guaranteeing that a man will have a boat to work in.
Other people have advocated a bounty. I wish to point out that a man cannot obtain that bounty unless
he has a boat to fish from.
5536. Do you assume that all men entering the industry would be -working men who had no means ? I
do not assume that. I know that a man entering the industry wants fairly extensive means, and I do
not think it would pay a poor man at all.
5537. What would be the result if a proclamation was issued declaring that the employment of coloured
men in the industry should cease at the end of five years ? The coloured labour would cease in five
years, and the industry would be curtailed and carried on in a doubtful way for some time to come.
5538. Do you know anything about the result achieved by Mr. Saville Kent in his experiment in
removing shell to the Eastern Pacific for Lever Brothers ? I understand that the shell which were
removed by Mr. Saville Kent arrived safely at their destination. Since then, a friend of mine who has
been on the spot has been informed that the whole of the shell which was put down in the shallow
water died.
5539. Have any in the deep water died? They have not bothered inspecting the shell in the deep water
after the shallow-water experience. That is the information I received, and I have had that information
confirmed by another person who is fairly reliable.
5540. But that would not affect your belief that it is possible to carry on experiments successfully ?
Not on the local grounds, because we know that shell has been transferred from one place to another
successfully.
5541. By Mr. Bennett : And that it has grown ? It has grown ; but there has been a fair death rate. It
is necessary that there should be quick transit, otherwise there will probably bo great mortality in the
young shell.
5542. By Mr. Douglas: You stated yesterday that the diver’s license should go with the boat? Yes.
5543. You referred to a strike which occurred this year, as showing that, if licenses were restricted to
those aliens who now hold licenses, that kind of thing might arise again ? Yes; but that is a very
secondary consideration compared with the fact that they may be called away to a war or for defence
training.
5544. Did you particularly refer to that matter on account of its being a strike of Japanese ? No.
5545. Would such a thing occur with other divers? It is quite possible that a strike may occur among
men of any nationality.
E.Hookings.
18 June, 1908.


5546. Have you known of any strikes among divers in former years ? Only incidents of small moment •
which I would not for one moment classify as strikes.
5547. In referring to the question of leaseholds for cultivation purposes, you stated that priority should'-
be given in cases where persons desiring to select certain waters had lodged applications for leases—
Allowing that the Government had shown shelters that cultivation could be carried on profitably, and
allowing that areas suitable for cultivation were surveyed into blocks of so many miles or so many
thousands of acres, and a person made application for one or more of those blocks, would you give him
priority, seeing that when similar applications are made under the Crown Lands Acts, no priority is given
to anybody ? I did not mention anything about priority in my statement.
5548. I understood you to say that a person lodging an application for a certain area should be given
priority? No. I recommended that the leases should be put up to auction, and that every boat-owner
should have an opportunity of taking up a cultivation area. Ido not suggest that there should be any
monopoly.
5549. If cultivation were proved to bo payable, do you think people would readily take up cultivation areas ?
They would to a certain extent, but I would not say the areas would be largely taken up for some
time.
5550. If there was any tendency to occupy the foreshores in that way, what would yon suggest in the
way of rental —so much royalty per ton on ihe shell produced, or so much per mile ? I would give the
leases free, because I think every encouragement should be given to persons who would take up such
areas, but I would keep the leases under Government control.
5551. At present seven years is the maximum term of lease—AVou'd you bo in favour of giving longer
leases ? I would have the same conditions as those on which leases arc given in connection with the
edible oyster beds. They seem to hi' giving satisfaction.
5552. AVhat are the conditions ? I think they are renewable at the end of seven years.
5553. By the Chairman : They arc renewable year by year ? So long as they pay their rent and are
prepared to keep it up, it goes on.
5554. But the licenses are granted year by year ? They pay an annual fee.
5555. The new banks arc put up to auction? I recommended that the areas should be given in the early
stages free of charge. Probably at the end of throe or five years, when the (Government saw that the
lessees were making money, they could make a charge and give the lessees the option of taking the areas
up at that price.
5556. By Mr. Bennett : How long would it be before a man could reasonably expect a return from a
leasehold, starting with a clear sheet, with the cultivation that we hope to see carried on by getting
spat, and possibly by transplanting shell? What would be the size of the shell, and how long would it
be before he got a return ?
5557. Per 6-inch shell—l do not consider that shell would be sufficiently profitable to raise on cultivation
areas until it had attained a growth > f over 6 inches ? That would bo a long time. Based on the theory
that the shell would not be allowed to be removed?
5558. I am saying that it would not be profitable to remove the shell from the cultivation area until it
was “bdd ” shell ? Of course it would bo very thin. T hat question would be more ably answered by a
scientist. 1 should think that it would take seven years.
5559. By Mr. Douglas : Can you tell us from memory what percentage of shell was obtained within the
3-milc limit during the last year you were working hero—ihat is, in 1901 ? Under 10 per cent.
5560. By Mr. Bennett: Will you kindly lake that return —[Handing Witness Government Resident's
Report for the year 1907 , showing Table JT] —AVhat do you consider should be the exportable size for
shell? There arc a lot of contingen ue-’.
5561. What is the present size limit ? Five inches.
5562. AVhat was it before that ? Six inches.
5563. AVhich do you consider the proper limit? AVith a view to the conservation of the industry, the
older the shell the more prolific it is.
5564. Then your answer is that the 6-inch limit is preferable? I think that the 6-inch shell would be
more prolific
5565. Would it weigh more than 5-inch shell, or less? More.
5566. How much more ? It depends upon the shell. They are very irregular.
5567. Taking the standard Old Ground shell, what would be the difference ? I could not very well
answer that question.
5568. A\ 7 ould it be as 4t010r3 to 1 ? No.
5569. Would it be as 2to 1 ? No.
5570. AVould a 5-inch shell be 33 \ per cent, less in weight than a 6-inch shell? Ido not like to say ;
but 1 tliiuk a fair average would be that a 5-inch shell would weigh two-thirds as much as a 6-inch shell.
5571. Looking mnv at that table, do you remember what year the limit of exportable shell was reduced
from 6 inches to 5 inches ? It was about 1898, was it not ?
5572. No ; the Act was passed in 1896, and it came into force in 1897 ? That was prior to my arrival.
5573. What was the catch in 1896 ? 1,089 tons.
5574. And in 1897 ? According to this return it was 1,223 tons.
5575. Since that year, with one exception, do the figures show an increase or a decrease ? According to
these figures, barring’the year 1899, there has been a decrease.
5576. You have said that you do not consider the beds have ever been depleted lo any extent—Do those
figures iusiify your contention ? A great number of the boats were small swimming diving boats.
5577. But the fbmres each year have been compiled on the same basis, so that really that does not
affect the question ? In the year 1904 there were 353 boats. The average was brought up that year by
there being an entirely different system to what was in force in 1906; but the total quantity of shell
less.
5578 Does the decease disclosed by those figures, extending practically over ten years, point to the
beds having maintained their productiveness? Taking the years when there was practically the same
number of boats there is only the difference between 1,000 tons in 1898 and 900 tons in 1903. That
discrepancy might easily be made up by . ne season being more favourable than another
5579 I ta£e from 1897—1 n that year 1,223 tons were taken ? I was not here in 1897.

B. Hookings.
18 June, 1908,
5580. But those are the figures? Tes; but 1897 is not a fair and reasonable year with which to
compare the others.
• 5581. I am not comparing it with other years—l am only taking it as a starting point—That was the
year of the maximum yield—Taking the ten years from 1897 to 1907, do you not consider that a fair
period for comparison ? Tes ; but you must bear in mind that in later years a great number of boats
left these shores. While the number of boats remained the same, the average total take was not more
than 200 tons different.
5582. Will you refer to the year 1901? Tes.
5583. In that year 353 boats were licensed ? Tes.
6581. How much was the take ? 777 tons.
5585. Do you consider that compared favourably with a take of 1,223 tons by 223 boats ? I have looked
up the records in the office, and find that a number of those boats were beche-de-mer fishing, and the
average that year is not on the same ratio as the average for 1906 or 1907.
5586. Taking the records year in and year out, has the productiveness of the fishery shown a tendency
to increase or decrease ? According to those returns, it has shown a tendency to decrease.
5587. What would you attribute the decrease to ? The decrease did not take place when I was working.
5588. What year ? Any year that I was working, up to 1905.
5589. There was no decrease in the take? No decrease in the take per boat of my own boats.
5590. By Mr. Douglas-. Tou maintained your average? I maintained my average up to the time I left
here in 1905.
5591. By Mr. Bennett : What was your average take per boat in 1904 ? A shade under 5 tons.
5592. Were you working under the floating-station system ? I was.
5593. All the time ? All the time.
5594. Have you any information as to whether the former productiveness of the beds can be restored by
any means ? That is a very open order. Do you mean their productiveness in any particular year ?
5595. Say, to the condition they were in in 1897, when we had the greatest yield? That was when
the 5-inch limit was introduced.
5596. Is it your opinion that the increase that year was due to the reduction in the size-limit of the
shell? I was not here; but lam told that it was a very favourable year as far as weather conditions
were concerned. The alteration to the 5-inch limit would, of course, have something to do with the
increased yield.
5597. By Mr. Douglas : Were they working the eastern coast in 1897, 1898, and 1899 ? They had been
working there previously.
5598. Would that account for the increase in the catch ? I cannot answer that question.
6599. By Mr. Bennett: Do you think the reimposition of the 6-inch limit would have any effect in
restoring the supply of good marketable shell? Tes.
5600. Do you think the divers would raise smaller shell for the purpose of obtaining pearls ? Not if
they were mine. Ido not think they would, especially if it were made an offence for them to have
smaller shell, dead or alive, about them.
5601. Do you think it lies in the hands of the owners of boats to a great extent to discourage the
raising of small shell ? It is not to their interest to raise small shell if they cannot export or legally sell it.
5602. Do you not think that, if the owners chose to do it, they could discourage the raising of small
shell —that is, shell under 6 inches ? They do so.
6603. By refusing to take the shell ? Undoubtedly. The Government, in their turn, should alter
the law so as to prevent persons smuggling small shell ashore. Unless the Government and the owners
work together, you will get no good result.
5604. Would it not tend to the conservation of the fishery if it were provided that no shell under 6 inches
should be raised ? It would be better for the conservation of the shell, but not for the boat-owner.
5605. By Mr. Douglas: When does the oyster spat? As far as I know, late in the year, from
September onwards.
5606. Does it also spawn early in the year? That I cannot say, because I have not had the same
opportunity of studying it then as in fine weather at the end of the year.
5607. By Mr. Bennett : Tou did make some observations on the pearl-oyster yourself ? Tes; I do
not pose as a scientist, but I think the buoyancy of the spat, after it leaves the shell, lasts at least two
weeks.
5608. Do you think that the working of the pearl-shell industry by pearlers as a whole has been carried
on with any thought for the conservation of the fishery? Ido not.
5609. Can you indicate in what respect want of care has been shown by pearlers generally? I think all
pcarl-shellers work with tPPc idea of making what they can out of the industry. I do, for one.
5610. By the Chairman : Quite regardless of the effect on the beds ? I would not say that; but I
consider that all pearl-shellers, while keeping within the letter of the law, work, like myself, for their own
gain.
5611. Do you think, then, that the reduction of “ A A.” shell to 5 inches has been detrimental to the
industry ? Not altogether to the industry.
5612. I am speaking of the conservation of the pearling-beds ? If shell were not picked up when it
was Sdnches, it would be picked up when it was 6 inches. I think there has been sufficient shell left on
the beds to supply all the spat necessary.
5613. Is 5-inch shell as profitable as 6-inch shell ? No; but the Government must see that the other
fellow does not come along and take the smaller shell one sheller has left. If I had shell under cultivation,
I would not raise my shell at 5 inches.
5614. Therefore the picking up of 5-inch shell cannot be beneficial to our deposits ? No.
5615. By Mr. Douglas: Would not the decrease in shell in the year 1904 be accounted for by
exceptionally heavy weather that year ? During that year the weather was not as favourable as it was in
other years; but my average per boat did not fall below the average for other years.
5616. Tou are giving this information from memory ? No; I know it as an actual fact.
5617. Tou said the weather was not favourable ? Tes; but, although the weather was not favourable, I
did not sit down, but went to other places.
5618. Tou went to the Aroe Islands in 1905 ? Tes.
176
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEE EOTAL COMMISSION,


5619. Then what do you mean by saying that you went to other places in 1901 ? Other places round'
here.
5620. Ton were working from a schooner in that year ? Yes.
5621. Are we to assume that the schooner enabled you to get to other beds which vessels working on the
shore-station system could not get to ? No; they could have got there if they had wished to do so.
5622. Did they not work ? That I could not say, but they could have worked. They had the same
opportunity as I had.
5623. Do you say that, although the figures for that year show a smaller total in the take of shell, there
is no reason why it should not have been higher? 1 would not say that, because that was the year when
a lot of small craft were taken in which did not work up to their average. There were a lot of swimming
divers at work then.
5621. Not according to the returns we got from the Pearl Shellers’Association ? If you refer to the
Customs records, you will see that my statement is correct.
5625. By Mr. Bennett : Do you not know that between 1900 and 1901 a very large number of superior
pearling boats were built—that the slips were going as hard as they could ? 1 remember that they were
kept going; but they were building boats to take the place of other boats that were being put out of
the industry. The new boats were being built, and would be licensed in that year, and the licenses of
the old boats would still be in force, and would allow them to work for beche-de-mer.
5626. By Mr. Douglas : Do you remember the year the restriction on the number of licenses was taken
off ? I do not remember what year it was.
5627. Tt was 1903 ? I remember the time.
5628. The official figures show a considerable increase in the number of boat licenses in 1901? Yes.
5629. In the year 1901 there was a large number of boats added to the industry owing to the removal of
the restriction ? The old boats, which were kept so long in the industry on account of the licenses being
restricted, were put into the beche-de-mer trade, and the new boats which took their place were licensed
and put into the shelling business. That accounts for a great deal of that increase.
5630. That is your opinion? You will see that by going into the names of the boats.
5631. You do not think the removal of the restrictions increased the number of pump diving boats at
work ? I do not wish to infer that.
5632. That is what you suggest ? No.
5633. You said that a number of boats were put into the beche-de-mer industry ? Yes, and the licenses
taken out for the new boats account for a certain amount of the increase.
5631. We have got the exact number of boats working at pump diving, swimming, and beche-de-mer
fishing—In the year 1902, the year prior to the restrictions being taken off licenses, there was a
grand total of 331 vessels licensed—219 were pump boats, 82 swimming boats, 26 beche-de-mer boats, and
1 tortoise-shell boats—That year the catch was 910 tons from pump and swimming boats ; in 1903 there
was a total of 332 vessels licensed ? You see the great discrepancy there is there. According to these
figures there were only twenty beche-de-mer boats, which would be incorrect.
5635. There were 214 of those vessels licensed for pump diving, 91 for swimming diving, 21 for beehe-de-
mer, and 3 for tortoise-shell ? This report gives 311. That is why I say these figures cannot be depended
upon.
5636. We have got the total number of vessels licensed in each year —the official returns of the
Government Resident only show the swimming and pump diving boats—they are only an approximation,
because the Government Resident does not know which vessels were engaged in the beche-de-mer
industry and turtle fishing; in 1901 there was a total of 367 vessels licensed, showing an increase
of thirty-five vessels in the whole industry —211 of those vessels were pump diving boats, that is, there
were thirty more pump boats added to the industry during the year 1901; there were 97 vessels engaged
in 'swimming diving, showing an increase of six ; there were 23 engaged in the beche-de-mer fishery,
showing a decrease of one ; which leaves a total net increase of 35 ; so that there were 36 more vessels
added to the industry that year, and there were only 777 tons of shell obtained, as against 908 in the
previous year ? That is right.
5637. Does not that point to the fact that the beds had been somewhat over-fished ? During that year
there was a great amount of changing from old to new boats, and, consequently, a great amount of time
was lost. Some of the thirty-six boats that you mention took the place of boats licensed for pearl-shelling,
which went fishing for beche-de-mer during the remainder of the year under their pearl-shelling licenses,
owing to the great advance in the price of beche-de-mer.
5638. Did beche-de-mer increase in price that year ? Yes. t That was the year the advance began. And
not only that, but the removal of the restriction gave people encouragement to send away the older boats
that they had been keeping in the shelling industry, inasmuch as they could get new boats to take their
place which could go further afield for shell.
5639. Then you are of opinion that the shelling beds have not shown signs of being over-fished ? The
beds, in my opinion, are not over-fished.
5610. By Mr. Bennett : Have they not been over-fished ? They have not been made unpayable.
5641. But have they not been over-fished, judging by results ? That is from the point of view of the
conservation of the pearl-shell ?
5642. By Mr. Douglas : Leaving the question of profit out of consideration, have the beds been over-
fished from the point of view of making the industry permanent? Not to stop it being a permanent
industry, or to deplete the beds and fish them out. I think they could not do that.
5643. Do you not think that if the licenses to fish were quite unlimited, and there were 300 or 500 vessels
fishiiie-, with a sufficient supply of labour available, the beds would become over-fished? No; because
they would become unpayable.
5644. In what way? Their catch of shell would be reduced—though I would not call that depletion—
and then people would not go into the industry. Itdoesnot mean that because licenses are not restricted
we are going to be stormed by so many hundred boats.
5645. You would not advocate restricting licenses at all ? JN o.
5646. You have no licenses here at the present time, have you ? I am not prepared to answer that
question.

! « 5647. But you liave or you have not ?
\ 5648. By the Chairman-. Where are your boats registered? They are in course of registration.
5. 5649. By Mr. Douglas : You suggested yesterday that there should be an arrangement by which vessels
licensed in one State should have the opportunity of being licensed in another State ? I said that was
likely to be brought about if the Commonwealth took over the fisheries.
5650. By Mr. Bennett-. Are your boats at present licensed under the pearl-shelling laws of'any
Australian State ? Yes.
5651. In which State ? The matter is now pending; but I think it is not of very vital importance to the
Commission.
5652. By the Chairman : Are they licensed or registered ? Both. The registration is in course of being
put through.
5658. By Mr. Douglas : With a view to making the industry profitable to white divers, do you consider
that there should be no limit to the number of licenses —If the number of licenses were restricted to a
certain number for a period of years to enable the grounds to become more productive, so that white men
could obtain catches of shell which would pay them to engage in the industry, do you think it would be
a good thing ? I think the idea is a good one.
5654. Then may I conclude that you approve of such a proposal ? 1 think it would be conducive to the
good of the beds ; but I would not like to see any man who wishes to come into the industry in a few
years debarred from doing so, I leave myself out of the question. I think that would create a monopoly.
The mere fact of shell not being got in payable quantities would be sufficient to keep people out, as it has
done in the past.
5655. Then, when you referred yesterday to the saving clause in the Act of 1889 by which persons who
had existing rights were protected, you meant that those who held divers’ licenses in past years should
have the privilege of renewing them if they wished to do so, notwithstanding that they may not have
been renewed for a year or two ? Yes, if their services are required; but there are a great many less
boats in the industry now than there have been in the past. If a man has a license, but has not got a boat
to fish in, his license is not much good to him.
5656. By the Chairman -. But you say you are in favour of unlimited licensing ? Yes.
5657. At the same time you admit that that will make the industry unremunerative ? If a large number
of boats came into the industry, it would possibly make it unremunerative to the less energetic person.
5658. Would the evil be accentuated if you had an unlimited number of licenses ? I think a lot of people
would fall out, as they have done in the past.
5659. By Mr. Douglas: It would be a case of the survival of the fittest? Yes, the same as in any other
business.
5660. By Mr. Bennett: When the nou-payable point was reached, what would be the course of the man
who found the beds unpayable, and who had his vessels fully manned and equipped and ready for work ?
The course of every person in any other industry.
5661. What is that ? Either shift or find other work for the surplus boats. It is its own cure.
5662. By the Chairman: That indicates that you have some alternative if the industry should fall through
altogether ? Because a man does not make a thing pay, 1 do not think ho is going down. 1 am not one
of those fellows who want the Government to help them. I think it is a case of the survival of the fittest,
like every other business.
5668. By Mr. Douglas: Has there been any permanent settlement in Queensland as the result of the
industry being worked in the past by floating stations—Have people located themselves here ? I think
the bulk of the money that has been made in Torres Strait has been spent in Queensland —certainly in
Australia.
5664. But what about this particular spot, where there are a good many people dependent upon the
shelling industry ? That is a matter I do not study very much.
5665. Still they are dependent on the industry ? 1 think their biggest supporters are the garrison.
5666. By the Chairman: What about the thousands of pounds that are sent away to China and Japan?
My answer re money made at Thursday Island referred particularly to the owners of boats.
5667. By Mr. Douglas: Butin the event of the industry becoming unpayable, and fleets being with-
drawn as they have been in the past, people who have located themselves permanently here will have to
suffer severe hardships through being unable to derive any revenue from the industry ? They will be no
worse than the people in any other industry.
5668. By Mr. Bennett: Your opinion is that the industry' will have its ups and downs ? Certainly.
5669. By the Chairman : Have you anything to suggest upon matters which the Commission have
overlooked, or have you any remarks you would like to make? I have made all my suggestions.

5671. How long have you been on Thursday Island ? I have been forty years in Torres Strait. I was
in Western Australia before that.
5672. But there was no pearl-shell industry hero forty years ago ? That was die time it was good.
5673. Have you been engaged all that time in the pearl-shell industry ? Yes.

5675. How many boats do you own ? Two pump boats.
A. Collies.
19 June, 1108.


5676. Do you know how many boats are engaged in the industry at the present time ? I cannot tell
exactly. I have my boats rented out, and Ido not study it now.
5677. Can you give us any idea of the condition of the beds ? The beds are pretty fair, but the weather ]
will not allow the men to work. The Old Ground is really good, but, with this southerly wind, they
cannot work it.
5678. Have you been diving yourself ? No.
5679. Have you ever employed white divers ? I had two for about five years.
5680. "Were they satisfactory ? They were very good for the time.
5681. By that you mean there was more shell then than there is now ? There was plent}' of shell in
those days.
5682. Do you think white divers could work with advantage now? No. If you want white men, you
cannot get them. It takes six months outside to teach a white man.
5683. Do you think it would take a steady young fellow six months to become a diver ? Tes. He
would have to go outside first to learn.
5684. Do you think that, if the conditions were made more favourable to white men, they would go into
the industry ? No, the work is too heavy; the water is too deep.
5685. What depth do you refer to P They are working in 15, 16, and 18 fathoms, and a white man
could not stand that.
5686. By Mr. Bennett: Is that on the Old Ground ? You have plenty of water 15 and 16 fathoms deep
on the Old Ground.
5687. By the Chairman : Do you think that, if matters were improved, white men would go into the
industry and work for themselves ? No. When you can get good foreign white people they are not able
to stand the work.
5688. When you speak of foreign white men, do you speak of Scandinavians ? Tes, and Norfolk Island
men, Eotumah men, and New Zealanders. They are the kind of men who are very good for the work here.
5689. By Mr. Bennett: What kind of New Zealanders do you mean? Those from the Bay of Islands.
5690. Maories? Yes ; they are good men, but you cannot get them.
5691. By the Chairman : Do you not think that young white men from New Zealand might be induced
to come here ? No; 1 saw a couple of them here, but they were no good at all.
5692. You are not in favour of men of your own race going into the industry ? No.
5693. You think the industry could not be carried on by white men? No.
5694. Not under improved conditions ? No ; they cannot do it.
5695. I suppose you know that it was said that white men could not work in the sugar industry ? Tes;
but this work is under water, and it is harder.
5696. Do you know the life of a fisherman in the North Sea ? I do.
5697. Do you think it is a harder life than diving in Torres Strait ? I do.
5698. How do coloured men overcome the difficulties of diving ? The pressure below is too heavy for
white men. ;
5699. Do you think the industry could not be carried on by white men ? If you could get the right’sort,
but you cannot; they will not come.
5700. Not if the industry were made more attractive ? Ido not think they would come.
5701. But if they would come, they could do the work ? Certainly.
5702. By Mr. Bennett: They have done it? Yes. At one time there were a good few here, all young
follows, but they went away.
5703. By the Chairman-. "What made them go away ? I suppose they got tired of it.
5704. Did they acquire sufficient to retire ? Yes ; they made a little money and went home, and said
they would not work hero any more.
5705. What number of boats do you think could fish in Torres Strait without depleting the beds ? A
couple of hundred.
5706. Could they always be profitably employed ? They could.
5707. By Mr. Douglas: Do you know how many pump boats have been employed in the past ? No.
5708. Do vou know how many are employed at present ? I cannot tell you ; Ido not know how many
went away to the Aroe Islands.
5709. You think 200 would not be too many to employ ? No ; they could work inside when the weather
was bad.
5710. Do you mean 200 pump boats ? Tes.
5711. Do you think there were too many pump boats on the ground during the years when shell was
scarce —1905, for instance ? No.
5712. Why did the fleets go away ? They could get no labour.
5713. Do you know that from experience? Certainly. I had to lay my boats up. They were laid up
for two years because I could not get labour.
5714. What labour do you mean ? For crews.
5715. Did you endeavour to get New Guinea crews ? No. They wanted £2OO security, and I had not
the money.
5716. Was that for New Guinea crews? Yes; so Mr. Mitchell told mo.
5717. You do not know that from having made application to the shipping authorities ? No. That
is what Mr. Mitchell told mo, and I could not afford it. He had my boats for £3 10s. a month, and he
knocked one all to pieces.
5718. You rented your boats ? Tes.
5719. That was when you found that you could not get crews ? I could not get crews.
5720. By the Chairman : Do you know if any other pearl-shcllcr had the same difficulty iu getting labour?
No.
5721. If anyone said that there was plenty of labour, and that they had not encountered any difficulty
in getting labour, would they be speaking the truth ? They could not get any labour here. There were
a few Malays here, but they are no good,
5722. By Mr. Douglas: What pay do JNew Guinea natives get i £1 a month.
5723! Could you not get those natives ? lam told that you have to give security, and I have no money.

5726. Do you know from your own personal knowledge that the Clark syndicate could not got labour at
the time their fleets left Thursday Island ? Tes ; the fleet people told me that they went where they
could get labour. Clark himself told me that he could not get any labour here.
6727. And you believe that was the reason why those fleets left Torres Strait ? I think so. There is
plenty of labour on the islands, but the missionaries will not let the natives go to work.

5729. Where was the shelling done principally when you came here first ? At Wap pa.
5730. That is where it started first? Yes ; it was started by Captain Banner.
5731. By the Chairman : Was Captain Banner here forty years ago ? Tes ; long before that. We were
lying at The Sisters at the time Captain Banner came to Wappa.
5732. Had he the “ Pakeha ” brig then F No.
5733. Was he in the “ Melanie ” ? No.
5734. By Mr. Bennett: Where was shell got at that time? Between Mua and Badu.
5735. After that they found the Old Ground ? They struck the Old Ground about twenty-five years
ago. Friday Island Passage was the first passage worked round here. Jardine was working it then.
5736. When was shell first struck behind Mabuiag, near Orman Beef? About five years after it was
found at Wappa. I was the first man to work there.
5737. When was shell first found north of Mabuiag? About the same time.
5738. Is there plenty of shell still to be got in those places ? Yes. The shell is young, and the grass is
very long. The grass never dies in those passages about Orman Beef.
5739. Is the shell as plentiful there now as it used to bo ? There is plenty of shell. The shell is young,
but it grows very quickly up there.
5740. Do you think that, if the bods were let alone, the shell would increase ? It grows well there; it is
a very rich spot.
5741. Does the shell get a fair chance of growing ? So long as they leave the small shell alone it does;
but the Japanese take everything they can get. They take a 4-inch shell, and then, if there is nothing in
it, they chuck it overboard. I had a diver working at places where Japanese had been, and he found 3-inch
shell there which had been opened and chucked overboard.
5742. Does the shell get a fair chance to grow? Yes.
5743. How much shell used you to pick up when you began pump diving? I used to got 20 tons a year
with two boats.
5744. Could you get that quantity now ? No, If you get 4 tons now, you think yourself lucky.
5745. So that there is not as much shell now as there was then ? That is so.
5746. You used to get 10 tons per boat per year before the Old Ground was found ? Tes.
5747. In the old days you got 10 tons per boat without any trouble, working the inshore beds ? Yes.
5748. And you got pearls besides? Yes. I always got good pearls.
5749. What was the price of shell in those days ? £l5O, £l6O, and up to £lBO per ton.
5750. What is the lowest price you have ever known ? I got £BO per ton for shell when we were working
at Cape Melville. I sold the shell in Cooktown. Some of the men who were working did not get £BO
for their shell. It looks good, but after you have it in the boat for about a week it looks like dead shell.
5751. What license fee do you pay for your boats each year ? £4 for one, and £3 for the other.
6752. Do you think it would bo a good thing if the license fee were made the same for all boats, no
matter what their size may be ? I think so. I think £3 is quite sufficient for any boat.
5753. Do you think that a boat of 15, 16, or 18 tons could get any more shell than a good small boat?
Ido not think so. I think there would be very little difference. The small boat has a chance inshore,
while the big boat has not. My boats are small, and I can creep into any corner and get my share of
shell out of it.
5754. In the old days did you get any shell in Mua Passage ? Yes ; it was a good place. There must
have been 300 tons came out of it.
5755. Is there any shell there now? The natives are swimming all the time, and they are taking up what
little grows.
6756. What is the smallest size suitable for a fishing boat ? They are no good under 10 tons unless
for swimming diving. A boat of 3or 4 tons is big enough for swimming.
5757. Have you ever tried to grow shell at your place ? No.
6758. I thought you had some shell dow r n ? I put some down, but I could not find them afterwards. I
planted them just on this side of Clark’s place, and you could not keep the natives away. Very often
they took the shell away.
5759. What wages used you to pay your divers ? Twenty pounds a ton and half the pearls. Then it
was £4 per 100 shell.
5760. What sized shell would you take from a diver when yon were paying him by the 100 shell? 6-inch
shell. They never fished anything smaller than that.
5761. Under that system did the divers pick up any small shell ? No.
5762. What kind of divers had you in those days ? Maories.
5763. You found the Maories good men ? Yes. I had a half-caste Maori named Joyce for ten years.
He was a really good man.
5764. By Mr. Douglas: When w r as it you first owned a boat ? Twenty-six years ago.
5765. Were you working on the boats before that? I was working with Mr. Merriman on Albany
Island. He and Captain Hastings had a station there.
5766. By Mr. Bennett: Were you boat master or what ? I was looking after the. gear, repairing pumps,
and everything.
5767. Are you a seaman by calling? Tes.
5768. By Mr. Douglas: You said you got 10 tons of shell per boat per annum—How many tons did you
get the year before you hired your boats to Mr. Mitchell ? 3 tons.
5769. That is a very serious falling off? I could not get any good divers.


5770. You think that small catch was solely due to the divers ? Yes.
5771. Do you think there was as much shell on the ground ? There was not so much; hut the
divers did not work well; they were only loafing about.
5772. Do you not think that the big difference was partly due to the shell being cleaned out a bit ?
There was plenty of shell, but the divers would not work.
Dan if. r. Campbell, Ex-Pearl Shell Manager, examined:
5773. By the Chairman-. What are you? I have been pearl-shelling.
5771. Have you been a seaman ? I have been at sea.
5775. Do you call yourself a sailor ? Yes. lam a clerk at present.
5776. How long have you been residing on Thursday Island ? Twenty years.
5777. A portion of that time you have been engaged in pearl-shelling? The best part of the time.
5778. In what capacity ? As a clerk.
5779. Were you managing boats ? I used to go out with the boats and manage the station.
5780. Whose fleet were you managing ? Albert Colless’s.
5781. How many boats did the fleet comprise ? He only had the two.
5782. Have you had any experience in diving ? Hot much. I have never been diving for pearl-shell.
5783. Can you give us any evidence about the present condition of the beds ? There are beds which have
been worked out, or very nearly.
5784. To which beds do you refer ? The Endeavour Strait and the mainland beds.
5785. Do you attribute that to too many boats ? Four or five years ago there were too many boats ; and
not only that, but when the boats struck a place where there was shell the schooners were outside, and
they made a good mark for the boats, and the boats would work round the schooner and clean that place
right out.
5786. You are referring now fo the floating station system ? Yes.
5787. The shore fleets have no schooners? There were very few boats working from the shore at that
time.
5788. Do you refer to any particular schooner? No.
5789. You refer to the floating station system ? Yes.
5790. Do you think that system tended to denude the beds ? I do, because the schooners were like a
beacon to the boats when they struck a patch.
5791. Did the Clark syndicate leave Thursday Island because the beds were denuded? I would not like
to say.
5792. You do not know of your own personal knowledge? No.
5793. Have you any idea of the number of boats at present in the industry ? No.
5794. How many boats do you think the bods would support profitably at the present time? About
300.
5795. Would that large number of boats get remunerative returns? Well, from 250 to 300.
5796. Do you think that number of boats could work to advantage ? They would not denude the beds.
5797. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think there have been too many boats working in the past? I do
not think so. There are plenty of places where there is plenty of shell. Divers can get any amount
of shell on the Old Ground. The Old Ground had a good spell after the Clark combine went away.
It has not been worked very much during the last three years since they left.
5798. By the Chairman: If the present number of boats were increased to 250 or 300, would not that
tend to denude the Old Ground again ? Not with the limit of shell. If the divers would leave the small
shell under the limit alone, and not destroy it, the ground would not be denuded.
5799. Do you think they open the small shell ? Of course. I have been swimming outside, and have
come across many of them, not on the ground itself, but where they have knocked off and gone under the
lee of the reef and opened the shell.
58C0. You are aware that the majority of the divers are Japanese? Yes.
5801. As a young man resident here and dependent upon the industry, do you think that is a desirable
state of affairs ? Ido not.
5802. Would you not rather see the industry in the hands of white men ? We have had a lot of white
divers here at one time or another. They seemed to do very well while they were at it. They had to go
out in boats as crew in order to learn. They w r ere put down occasionally when the diver could spare the
time. That was generally on the Old Ground. There was a difference between the Old Ground and
xvorking up here to the eastward. You can go down in a dress to-day, and you can drift from daylight
to dark on the Old Ground, whereas up to the eastward the shell lies in bottoms. A diver coming from
the Old Ground may get two or three shell; if he missed the bottom, he would not have the savvey to
make his anchor fast; and, if he lost the bottom, he might be drifting all day before he struck another.
5803. The experience necessary to ensure success could be acquired by the white man as well as by the
coloured diver ? He would need to have a lot of experience. He would have to be put in a boat for
some time before ho got into the work.
5804. Can you suggest any means for making the industry attractive to white men ? The only thing I
can suggest is to pay the divers so much per 100 shell.
5805. By Mr. Bennett : Who is to pay them ? The owner.
5806. Instead of paying them by the ton ? Yes.
5807. Bv the Chairman: Would it be a necessary preliminary to have a sailing vessel as a school for
training young men as divers ? It would be a great help. Then you would want an experienced man to
5808 I presume there are plenty of experienced men? Ido not think a school would pay. The only
way you could ready teach thcmVould be to send them out in boats to see how things are worked.
58(X) The trainin'* vessel would cruise about to make them familiar with all the conditions under which
the shell is obtained —Do you think the scheme could be worked under those conditions ? Yes.
5810 Bu Mr. Douglas: Have you worked the Old Ground beds at all ? Yes, I have been there on and
off with the boats, but 1 have never been down. . . . . , 0
5811 Under the floating-station system they could keep their boats together, and skin the beds ? Yes.
'5812. With boats working from a shore base, there is not so much chance of that ? No,

. 5813. Could not the boats keep together working from shore? Yes. The boats are all scattered. If I
k struck a patch, I could put a buoy there and work the fleet from it, and so clear out the ground.
;. 5814. Do boats working from the shore buoy any particular patch ? Yes; if they strike a good patch
of shell.
5815. By Mr. Bennett: On the Old Ground P Anywhere.
5810. By Mr. Douglas: Xaturally the diver who found the ground would want to keep it for himself as
much as possible ? Yes.
5817. Whereas a schooner would want to keep all the boats of the fleet on the ground P Of course.
5818. What was the average yearly catch of shell fifteen years ago ? Eight tons.
5819. Did you employ white divers at that time ? No; half-caste Maories and Norfolk Islanders.
5820. What was the average catch of those boats five years ago ? I daresay from 2 tons to 2 j tons.
5821. How do you account for the difference between 8 tons and tons —Would it be due to the fact
that there was not so much shell to be got ? Undoubtedly not. It was because of the divers we had,
and the weather conditions.
5822. Were the weather conditions five years ago more severe than they were fifteen years ago ? I think
they were. It is not only that; you have to depend a lot upon the divers.
5823. What class of divers did you have five years ago? There was Harry Colless working on and off,
and old “ Jimmy the Frenchman.”
5824. They were not as good divers as the Maories ? No ; they were only just starting to learn at that
time.
5825. By Mr. Bennett : You had a Maori diver four or five years ago ? Yes.
582 G. By Mr. Douglas Were those boats working on the Old Ground? No; mostly to the eastward,
on AYappa and AYarrior Beefs.
5827. By the Chairman '■ Have you made any experiments in cultivation? No ; but I have seen a lot of
work carried out in Friday Island Passage. I was living alongside.
5828. AYhat was the result ? That I could not tell you. We have been fishing in Friday Island Passage,
and have caught trevalli, and, when we have opened them, we have found any amount of shell inside.
There are two kinds of shell there, one of which is what we call a bastard pearl-shell. It grows to about the
size of a five-shilling piece. There is a lot of that kind of shell in Friday Island Passage, where it is found in
clumps, and you will find it everywhere you go on the Old Ground. The shell I got in the white fish is
pearl-shell of a kind—l forget the name of it, but we call it pappy shell.
5829. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the catch of shell from the Old Ground is falling off owing to the
large number of boats employed ? Ido not.
5830. You have already stated that the schooner system tends to deplete the beds ? Yes; but the
further you go the more shell you get.
5831. Was it not necessary to go further out every year? Of course. Each floating station had its own
system of working. A boat could go miles and mdes away from the schooner, as long as she reported
herself at the proper time.
5832. Have you worked Endeavour Strait ? Yes; I was swimming diving there last year.
5833. Do you think the supply of shell there has fallen off lately as compared with what it was fifteen or
twenty years ago ? 1 believe it has. Endeavour Strait is a place where the shell grows very quickly.
The grounds there were closed sometime ago; but I have been there time after time, and have seen
boats sneaking on to the ground and working there.
5834. Do you think it is a good thing to close any of the beds? I think Endeavour Strait should bo
closed and properly patrolled, and that any person found there during the time it was closed should lose
his license, or something of that kind.
5835. Why should it be closed? Because it is a place where the shell grows very quickly, and the shell
obtained there is about the best shell that goes into the market.
583 G. Better than the Old Ground shell ? Yes—something similar to the AYappa shell.
5837. Are there any other beds that you think ought to be closed? No ; that is about the only place in
the Strait that should be closed.
5838. For how long would you suggest that it should be closed? I reckon for about three years. The
shell ought to mature then —that is, it should be over 6 inches.
5839. By Mr. Bennett: How long does it take a shell from the time it starts growing until it is 6 inches ?
I could not tell you.
5840. By Mr. Douglas: If Endeavour Strait were closed for three years, and was reopened at the end of
that time, and the present number of boats —112 —all went to that place, would not that have a tendency
to skin it out again ? I think it would partly; but the weather conditions would interfere with their
working a great deal.
5841. Would not the same remark apply to other shell areas? Of course it would.
5842. By Mr. Bennett: But Endeavour Strait can bo worked in nearly all weathers? No; there are
times when the water is dirty.
5843. I know that, but lam speaking of wind ? As long as you can get clear water you can work.
5844. By the Chairman : AYhat do you think should be the minimum size for exportable shell ? Ido not
think you could get any better limit than 5 inches.
5845. By Mr. Douglas : You say that divers pick up shell under 5 inches ? Yes.
5846. For the sake of the pearls? Yes.
5847. Have you found pearls in shell between 5 and G inches? Yes.
5848. By Mr. Bennett: Large or small pearls ? Not of any great value.
5849. By Mr. Douglas: Are the best pearls found in the smaller shell? Sometimes; sometimes you may
get a good pearl in a big shell.
5850. By Mr. Bennett: Have you ever found any good pearls at Mangrove Island and AYappa? Yes.
5851. AY ere the shells you found them in large or small ? From 6to 8 inches.
5852. By Mr. Douglas: Just now you compared the results of former years with those of later years,
and said the divers apparently got more shell twenty years ago than they did a few years ago ? Yes.
5853. AYas that because the divers were better ? They were betlor divers, and they know the run of the
grounds.
5854. AYere the Maories you speak of half-castes? Yes.
5855. Do you think it would be desirable to get back to men of that class ? I think so.

5b56. Have you had any experience of working with Japanese divers or other coloured men? No
experience at all with Japanese.
585/. By the Chairman : Do you know anything about the researches carried on by Mr. Saville Kent and
Mr. Tosh? No. The only man I was interested in in connection with that matter was Mr. Pace, who
was employed by the Clark combine down at Friday Island Passage.
5858. Do you know if he achieved any success ? No ; but Ido not think he did.
5859. Do you think the services of a good practical man to assist the industry by the scientific cultivation
of the pearl-oyster would bo an advantage? The strong tides have a lot to do with carrying the spat
away.
5800. But it would bo the duty of the scientist to find some method of counteracting that waste ? That
would be very hard, unless he got a place where there was no tide running. He would have to look
round to find some suitable ground.
5801. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know Alligator Passage ? I do.
5862. Is not that a good place ? There are little bights which the tide does not get at.
5868. By the Chairman : Granting that a scientist had a proper place in which to carry out experiments,
do you think it would be conducive to the success of the industry if such a man were employed ? It
would, to a certain extent.
5861. Under more favourable conditions than those now r existing, do you think the industry could bo
carried on by white divers ? Ido not think it could at the present tipie. A diver would have first to go
out in a boat, and learn diving, and get experience.
5865. But surely an intelligent man like you must know that in all other industries you have to acquire
experience? Yes.
5866. Would not a coloured man have to acquire experience? Yes ; but it takes some'time for them to
get into the work.
5867. Have you ever heard of the Anglo-Saxon failing wherever there was a promise of reward ? No. It
is a white man’s industry all right.
5868. Do you think it could be made a white man’s industry ? It could in time.
William Thomas Sullivan, Licensed Victualler, examined :
5869. By the Chairman : What are you ? lam a hotel-keeper.
5870. How long have you resided on Thursday Island ? Eighteen years on Thursday Island and thirty-
four in the district.
5871. Have you been engaged in the pearl-shell industry? Not directly.
5872. Have you had an interest in the industry?. I have —in money ventures.
5873. Have you been an owner of boats ? 1 have.
5874. Are you an owner of boats at present? lam not.
5875. Are you interested in the industry at all now ? lamas a resident.
5876. You mean you are interested in the welfare of the town? Yes, and in the welfare of the
industry.
5877. You think the welfare of the town is involved in the welfare of the industry ? Absolutely.
5878. You know that the present divers are nearly all Japanese ? 1 do.
5879. Is that a desirable state of affairs? It is a very moot point. The Japanese undoubtedly have
proved themselves excellent divers, totally regardless of their own safety, and they are men who take
almost any risk. The graveyard will give you full information about that.
5880. Under changed conditions, do you think the industry could bo made attractive to our own people?
That is most desirable.
5881. And save about £25,000 going away to Japan every year without any return ? That is
indisputable.
5882. If a vessel were established here as a training school for white divers, do you think it would help
to attract the whites? I do not think a training school would bo a success here. We have not
population enough growing up to train.
5883. Perhaps young men would be induced to come here—lt would be no use training divers in other
localities, because they would have to become acquinted with the environments of the industry, which are
peculiar to Torres Strait ? It is undoubted that these youths would have to be trained, and if possible
the young men should be the sons of parents accustomed to the sea.
5884. You know the Australian in the seaport towns is pretty well amphibious—in New Zealand and
Sydney they are all good boatmen and good swimmers ? From the pleasure point of view they are.
5885. Do you not think the incentive of getting a few pearls would bo sufficient inducement ? lam
fairly well’alive to our existing circumstances. Eighteen years is a fair period in a man’s life, and there
have been various changes in this place since I came here.
5886. Minor changes ? Changes in the prosperity of the place.
5887. Not changes of any great extent so far as the industry is concerned —The same conditions are in
existence now as were in existence at the inception of the industry thirty-eight years ago ? No; there
have been many changes.
5888. In what respect ? When I came into this harbour eighteen years ago you would almost fancy
you were going into Sydney Harbour. All the adjacent islands were inhabited by white people and
married Rotumah men and Maoris, and now there are scarcely any of them left.
5889. The shell was more plentiful then —Do you assign that as a reason ? No.
5890. What was the special attraction then that does not exist now ? I suppose there was an
attraction in the results of successful shellers, just like men follow one another wherever there is a
rush to a (midfield. Evidently those people did not make a success of it, although they were hero eight
or nine years, because they gradually drifted away.
5891. But some men acquired wealth in the industry and went away? Yes; but if it had been such
an absolute success as is generally the case in other industries, someone else would have taken their place.
5892. Do not the same remarks apply to many other localities in the North—when you and 1 were in
Cooktown the wharves were all crowded with ships? Cooktowu was very little when I arrived. I was
there the second year it was opened.
5893. lam speaking of when the railway was opened r -there have been many changes, ot course.

W. T.
Sullivan.
19 June, 1908.
5894. The principal object of tlio Commission is to devise some scheme by which this industry can be
made to confer greater benefit on Thursday Island; and if you succeed in arresting the outflow of £25,000
\ a year to China and Japan, would that not be a great advantage ? Undoubtedly.
*. 5895. There cannot be a change of any kind, but some portion of the community must suffer to some
extent ? My opinion, after very close observation, is that, unless the Government take the matter over
entirely, this will never be any better than it is, owing to personal and individual motives.
5890. Do you mean that the Government should assist the industry ? No ; it should be absolutely
controlled by the Government.
5897. Make it a national industry? No jealousy or competition or side issues should be allowed to
interfere with the future prosperity of the place. The shell is there, and it is wealth belonging to the
nation. If Thursday Island is to be run absolutely for the shelters, without any desire to make the place
inhabitable and a future homo for Britishers or other white people, the sooner Thursday Island is shut up
the better.
5898. Do you think it possible that the Government, at a time when the cry for a white Australia is so
widespread, would undertake an industry of this kind which is carried on by other than whites ? The
Government naturally would not care about that; but I say that unless the Government take it in hand,
and laws are made so rigid that there will be no undermining them, things will go from bad to worse.
5899. If you confess that the industry cannot bo made remunerative by white labour, why should the
Government be expected to make an experiment in that direction ? The whites at present here have not
the inducement or probably the capital to go in for it.
5900. You must remember that the cry against white men in the sugar industry was just as pronounced
as the cry on Thursday Island against white men in this industry ; and still the sugar industry is being
worked to-day by white men? There is no comparison between the two.
5901. You know the privations that men endured in looking for gold on the Palmer, and how the hospital
at Cooktown was crowded with white men who took their lives in their hand looking for gold—surely the
incentive of getting a few pearls is just the same ? Yes.
5902. You are desirous of maintaining the prosperity of Thursday Island ? I have no other desire.
Australia is my homo. lam a colonial of forty-five years’ standing. I have been in New Zealand and all
over the Commonwealth.
5903. You know the spirit of adventure that exists in the Australian in all the States —Do you not think
that steady, strong, young fellows could be induced to become shellers under the conditions I have
mentioned ? If you get the right class of people.
5904. By Mr. Douglas: When you referred to the islands of the Strait being inhabited by whites, you
inferred that they had been gradually worked out of the industry ? That is so.
5905. The next change you referred to, I suppose, was the gradual increase in the number of coloured
aliens ? Yes.
5900. Then came the schooners ? I think the “ Sketty Belle” came first —The fleets went to Western
Australia in 1885, and returned about 1889, so that the schooner system was in operation when you first
came here ? Yes; but all those white settlers were here then.
5907. Do you think the schooner system had a tendency to work those people out? At that time 1 was
butchering, and I did not take very much notice of what other people were doing. I was very busy; and
the business people did not feel the departure of the white settlers, as they went away one at a time. I
suppose this little place was one of the best places in Australia for making money in those days, notwith-
standing the denuding of the beds. That is a matter that has been under discussion pretty well ever
since ; but while they were here, as far I know, every business in the town was solid.
5908. Du Mr. Bennett: Whilst the fleets were here, or whilst the white people were here ? When the
white people were here. The population was not very large, but everybody seemed to be comfortable.
5909. By Mr. Douglas : The schooner system was brought into existence by some of the more successful
shellers? Apparently.
5910. In order that they might work a large number of boats with advantage to themselves ? Naturally.
5911. They did not study anybody else particularly; their object was to make as much as they could for
tin mselves ? That is so. That is where the trouble comes in, and that is the reason why I suggest that,
unless the Government take the matter in hand, we shall never be any better, because we shall always
drift back to the same thing. The shellers supply their own men ; they get the cheapest labour they
can ; and this native labour is no good to business people. The New Guinea labour is no good to us.
The men come here and go about the town almost naked.
5912. Then the schooner system does not lead to permanent settlement ? There were a lot of families
here at one time. Of course they had white managers and clerks, and there were a lot more white people
here then than there are now. They were more or less settled here with their wives and families.
6913. When the fleets work with a movable base such as a schooner, they are able at a moment’s notice
to take themselves away, and thereby the people who are not directly interested in the shelling suffer very
much? That is the trouble; and that is one of the things that causes me to think that, unless the
Government take the matter in hand and pass restrictive laws, there cannot be permanent settlement.
All the business people felt the check when the fleets went away.
5914. If they returned, there would be more money in circulation; but you could never tell when they
might be withdrawn again ? The trouble is likely to recur at any time.
5915. Do you think the Government should pass some legislation to protect the people not directly
interested in shelling against the possibility of depression being forced upon them without their being
able to help themselves? That is my opinion.
5916. Then you think the schooner system is not permanently beneficial to those who are indirectly
interested in the industry ? No, for the reason that they are likely to haul up their anchor and go to
South Australia. While they are here, people are prosperous, and there is very keen competition in
business ; and when they clear out those who cannot get away, and who have their capital invested here,
are left to face this unfair competition, and you have to live it down again until another wave of
prosperity comes.
5917. Would you suggest that a limit should be placed on the size of vessels, so that the schooner system
cannot come into operation again ? I think that has already been done. If those people want to come
back again, and they like to work from the shore, it would be a very good thing.

5918. It would be a good thing so long as the system of floating stations was stopped ? Yes.
5919. If that is done, you think it is desirable to have as many boats as possible working in the industry ?
Yes. If there are too many, it is business that is overdone —some will go out of it. It is like gold-
mining. There is nothing to stop me investing my money in a gold-mine. If I cannot make it:
pay, I have to go out of it. People will not stop in the shelling business if it does not pay them. The
trouble is that there are so many kinds of evasion being practised, and, unless the Government take
it in hand, it will never be any better.
5920. Do you think the limitation of the number of boats engaged in the industry would give a chance
to some of our own people to make a living out of it by getting a larger catch of shell than is got at the
present time, and thus lead to permanent settlement on the Island ? I do, but I would leave the
limit to be fixed by the Government.
5921. Do you think it is desirable that no more alien divers should be licensed? You cannot very well
do that until you get substitutes for them. Ido not think you can do better than go along as we are
doing, and get the best divers available.
5922. Ido not mean to imply that there would be any stoppage of existing licenses ? If you put
restrictions on the issue of licenses to aliens, and have no substitutes to take their places, you will stop
the industry altogether. It appears to me that a scheme might be adopted by the Government for the
training of young fellows who might become shellers, but that they should not be taken until they can
stand a test. That would be the surest way of getting white men into the industry ; but Ido not think
they would come unless there was a certainty of their getting a good catch of shell.
5923. Do you think it would be a desirable thing to make regulations providing for a gradual change in
the existing condition of things, so that, instead of having 200 or 250 boats with alien divers, we should
have white divers, who would circulate their money in the country ? I do think so. I think 300 white
divers with the necessary tenders would be better for Thursday Island, as a settled population, than 1,000
aliens. There can be no two opinions about that matter.
5924. By the Chairman : If the Government issued a proclamation declaring that the employment of
coloured aliens in the industry should cease in five years, what effect do you think that would have ?
That would depend upon the supply of white labour available.
5925. I meant, if in the meantime a training school for white divers were established, and conditions
generally were made more attractive to white men ? 1 would be quite willing to shut the place up for
five years if we could bring that about. It is useless people living on here in the expectation of a future
when they cannot see any.
5926. Do you think this place, with its limited population, will ever attain the prosperity you desire while
such a large proportion of the money earned here is sent away to foreign countries? No. There is no
argument needed to prove that. The thing speaks for itself.
5927. There is evidence before the Commission that over £25,000 is annually sent away to China and
Japan —You do not desire to perpetuate that sort of thing ? No ; I would sooner see the place shut up.
It is entirely in the hands of the Government to regulate the matter.
5928. Supposing the Government did shut up the industry, what is to become of Thursday Island? The
Government would no doubt make such arrangements as would be fair to present owners. The people
at present employed have a great deal to do with reducing the prosperity of this place, because whatever
money they have they do not spend it in the stores; they get no clothes.
5929. Do yon not think that, if the industry were carried on by men of our own colour, you would have a
better chance ? I do.
Masueo Siiiojiua, Japanese Interpreter, examined :
5930. By Mr. Douglas : "VYhat is your business ? Interpreter.
5931. And agent ? No ; just an interpreter.
5932. You interpret between the Japanese who work the boats and the employers? Yes. ]
5933. How long have you been here ? About five and a-half years.
5934. You have had a good deal of interpreting work to do in connection with the beche-de-mer
industry? Yes.
5935. On what system do they work the beche-de-mer industry? There are several systems which
I cannot remember ; but I can tell you that under one system the owner gets a portion of the value
of the catch, and gives 85 per cent, to the man in charge, who pays the wages and feeds the crew of the
boat.
5936. By Mr. Bennett : Does he pay for repairs ? No. The payment to the man in charge is on a
sliding scale. The owner gets 30 per cent, or 15 per cent., according to the size of the boat. The balance
goes to the man in charge.
5937. He gets 15 per cent, or 30 per cent. ? On a sliding scale—£3o up to 6 tons, and £27 10s. on 7
tons.
5938. By Mr. Douglas : And down to £l5 for a large catch ? Yes.
5939. Then the Japanese in charge have to pay all the expenses of the boats ? No, only wages and
rations. . .
5940. And the owners of the boats pay for repairs out of their percentage ? Repairs and any other
things.
5941. By Mr. Bennett ; Do the owners pay insurance ? Yes.
5942. License fees ? Everything else.
5943. By Mr. Douglas-. How many natives do the larger boats employ? Thirteen or fourteen, and the
smaller vessels six or eight. , ,
5944. How far south do they fish on the reefs ? Outside ot Mackay.
5945 Do the boats that fish off Mackay take their produce into the Southern ports and ship it to
Thursday Island, or is it sold in the Southern ports ? It is all shipped to Thursday Island.
6946. The owner of the boat has the produce sent to him by the man in charge ? Yes.
5947. Does the owner sell it here ? Yes
5948. Do you see the amounts that are obtained tor it r Ao. borne ot the Japanese come here, and I
-. You do not look after the sale of the fish? No; but I have some idea of the
price.

19 June, 1908. -
5950. By Mr. Douglas: The man in charge gets his share according to the price the beche-de-mer is sold
, for ? There is nothing definite.
.5951. He merely gets his percentage of the total amount reali-ed for the fish ? Yes.
5952. By Mr. Bennett: If a ton of fish was sold for £lOO, he would get £B3, and the owner would get
£l5? Yes.
5953. By Mr. Douglas : The owner gets nothing more than his 15 per cent. ? No.
5954. Are any of these boats owned by the Japanese? No,
5955. By Mr. Bennett: Are yon sure of that? Yes. Mr. Goichi Okida is the only man.
5956. By Mr. Douglas : He owns two pearl-shell boats ? Yes. Some time ago ho was beche-de-mer
fishing.
5957. By Mr. Bennett: Where is he now ? Down south somewhere.
5958. By Mr. Douglas: Is he fishing for beche-de-mer now? No ; he is pearl-shelling.
6959. Are his boats working with island crews ? Yes ; one is laid up.
5960. Are they getting much fish on the Barrier Reef ? Not like last year. Last year’s catches were
better. This year the catch is very low.
5961. What would be a fair average amount of fish to catch ? The smaller boats will get from 2-J- to 3
tons. A big boat will get about 6 tons. Last year one boat got a very big quantity.
5962. Bj Mr. Bennett: AYhat do you call a big quantity ? From Bto 12 tons.
5963. What -would be the largest weight that any boat got last year? I believe one of Mr. Farquhar’s
boats—the “ Fairy” —got a very largo catch.
5964. By Mr. Douglas : How many tons did she get ? Ido not know.
5965. Do the Japanese in charge report the state of the reefs to you, or have they told you that there is
plenty of fish on the reefs? They reckon there is not much. Last year they got plenty of fish.
5966. How many boats over 10 tons are worked by Japanese ? I believe there are thirteen.
5967. How many under 10 tons ? Ido not think any of them are under 10 tons.
5968. How many Japanese do they employ on those boats ? I think the average is about two—the man
in charge and one other.
5969. Do you know what wages the native crew get ? 12s. a month.
5970. What is about the average ration for a month? I could not say; but I heard a man in charge
say that he used a considerable amount of his rations in recruiting the boys.
5971. They have to be given to the natives at their homes ? Yes. The boys are brought here before
they go out to the fishing-grounds, and sometimes they run away. That means more tucker for recruiting
the boys.
5972. By Mr. Bennett: Who recruits the boys ? The Japanese in charge.
5973. By Mr. Douglas: Do the two Japanese in a boat share the net earnings, or does the man in charge
pay the other? Ido not know. Some work in company.
5974. If they get 85 per cent, of the value of the fish they will get a pretty fair profit ? Ido not
think so, because I believe in some of the smaller boats they are in debt to the owners.
5975. How many tons of fish would a boat of 10 tons need to get to pay expenses? I cannot say; but I
believe if the smaller boats get about 5 tons they may get a little profit. When they only get 3 tons or
3| tons, it will not pay for the men’s wages.
5976. By Mr. Bennett: What was the price of beche-de-mer last year ? The prices ranged from £l4O
to £lO3 for all good fish.
5977. Teat fish and black fish ? Yes.
5978. By Mr. Douglas : The number of boats working this year is less than last year ? Yes ; last year
there wore seventeen, and this year there are thirteen.
5979. Is there anylhing you would like to suggest regarding the beche-de-mer business ? I would like to
say that in China the value of the silver dollar has gone down from 11 dollars 50 cents to 12 dollars for
£l. Mr. Morey had some fish, and he asked the Chinaman to give him more than £lOO for good fish.
They were offering about £9O.
5980. You think the fall in the value of the silver dollar in China is the reason why the price of
beche-de-mer has gone down ? The Chinamen mostly complain about the fall in the value of silver.
Also the fish is getting cheaper.
5981. There is too much fish being brought in? Yes; not from Queensland only, but from other places.
Ido not think anybody will get a fair profit this year; and there are not many fish on the ground at the
present time. The Japanese have been down the coast as far as Mackay, and one boat went to try the
reefs at Bundaberg. Ho was disappointed, and lost money. They have to feed the natives just the same,
otherwise they will not stay.
5982. What depth of water do they dive in ? The deepest is 6 fathoms. It is usually 3or 4 fathoms.
Henry Clark, Shell-packer and Ex-Diver, examined:
5983. By the Chairman : What are you ? lam a labourer at the present time.
5984. How long have you been at Thursday Island ? Since 1882.
5985. How long were you diving? A little over twelve months.
5986. By Mr. Douglas : Have you been on the boats for any period ? I was on the boats for about
fourteen years.
5987. In what capacity ? Tender the best part of the time.
5988. Did you find that the diving did not suit you? Yes; it used to affect me in the head. I had
headaches all the time.
5989. AYhat depth of water did you dive in ? Just around here in Endeavour Strait and on the Old
Ground.
5990. How long is it since you worked as tender? Since 1892.
5991. Have you been living here since that time? Yes.
5992. What has been your occupation since then? Shell-packing, and general work about the town.
5993. When you left the shelling-grounds in 1892 was there plenty of shell obtainable ? Yes.
5994. Did you go to AYestern Australia when the fleets went there. No ; I never left here.
5995. Do you know what the present condition of the grounds is ? They are not too good now.
6996. The catch of shell is not as good as it used to be ? No.
5997. When the fleets went to the Aroe Islands, was there a scarcity of shell on the Old Ground ? • Yes.

5998. By Mr. Bennett-. Ton know that there was not so much shell coming into Thursday Island ? That
is so (
5999. By Mr. Douglas: Was that duo to the largo number of boats then working? I think there were r
too many boats at that time.
6000. If the same number of boats had continued there, do you think they would have been able to get
enough shell to make it pay ? Ido not think they would.
6001. Were you tender to a white diver? No —to Eotumah men, Manila men, and all sorts.
6002. What were the wages paid to the diver ? At that time they were paid by the 100 shell.
6009. How much were they paid for 100 shell ? From £1 down to £3.
6001. How many shell would go to the ton ? lam not certain about that. There never was any trouble
about the weight.
6005. What was the smallest sized shell that the owners would take from the divers? The diver would
have to put in about three 6-inch shell to make up-one big shell.
6006. What wages did you get as tender ? £3 15s. to £2 a ton —so much on a “ lay.”
6007. You were paid by the “lay ” ? Yes.
6008. AYhen owners were paying under that system, did they like the divers to pick up small shell? They
were always complaining about small shell. They would sooner see them pick up big shell.
6009. There was no restriction on the size of shell you could bring in ? Not in the beginning ; there
was afterwards.
6010. By Mr. Bennett: There was no 6-inch limit then ? No, there was no limit.
6011. By Mr. Douglas: It was in 1891 that the 6-inch limit came into force ? Yes. I was just
finishing up in the boat when the 6-inch limit came in.
6012. What do you reckon would be the average yearly earnings of a diver in those days ? Some of
them used to get £5 and £6 a week.
6013. Would they make £l5O a year ? Oh, yes; they would make all that.
6014. Hid they get the pearls ? Yes.
6015. By whom were you employed most of the time ? I was first employed by Frank Summers at
Wai-Weer station. Then I went to Goode Island with Mr. Kelly.
6016. Is it a very hard life working on the boats ? At times it is. You have to work hard now, but in
those days they did not work so hard.
6017. Why is it harder now ? Because of the scarcity of shell.
6018. Have they to go further out on the grounds? Yes.
6019. By the Chairman: Were there any white divers at the time you were employed? Yes; at the
beginning.
6020. How did they do ? Some fared very well, but some did not. Two men who came up-with-mo
were no good, and they were only employed three months when they were paid off.
6021. From what you know of the industry, do you think white men could succeed as divers ? At the
present time it would not pay thorn.
0022. If the work were made more attractive to white men, and they could make enough money out of
it—Supposing a man could make £l5O a year, and he was allowed the pearls, do you think white men
would go in for it ? I suppose they would.
6023. By Mr. Douglas: Could a white man get enough shell at the present time to make good wages in
the industry ? No.
6024. Have you been employed by any of the people who were cultivating the pearl-oyster ? No.
6025. Do you think there are too many boats working just now ? No. I think there are a fair number
working now.
6026. Do you think the grounds would stand many more ? They might stand fifty more; but Ido not
know how many are on.
6027. When you were working on the grounds, did you notice that the shell grew quickly in some '
places ? Yes.
6028. Do you think the closing of some of the beds would be an advantage ? The divers generally close
up some of the bods themselves when they are not payable. If shell gets scarce on any bed, they leave
that bed and go to other places.
6029. And then go back to the ground ? They will give it a few months’ spell and then go back.
6030. Bj Mr. Bennett: Were the divers in your time able to sell the pearls all right ? Pearls were sold
for almost nothing in my time.
6031. The divers did not go out to look for pearls in those days—they went out to look for shell ?
Yes. Shell was plentiful then.
6032. Did the divers take up small shell for the purpose of getting pearls? Not in my time.
6033. Did you get plenty of shell in Endeavour Strait in your time ? Yes.
6034. About Eoko and High Islands ? All those places round there.
6035. From what you know of present conditions, can you say if there is plenty of shell there now ? I
do not think shell Is very plentiful there now.
6036. Did you use to work round Badu and Mua ? Yes.
6037. Was there plenty of shell there in your time ? Yes.
6038. Is there plenty of shell there now ? Ido not think there is much shell there now.
0039 Did you work on the Old Ground soon after it was found ? Yes.
604 o! What part was called the Old Ground ? Just to leeward of Badu.
6041. You did not have to go far out for shell then ? No.
6012. How far? We ran out about 20 miles.
6043 Well clear of the sandbanks ? Just clear of the sandbanks, and we worked right on. Of course,
later on we had to go out of sight of the land.
6011. And "o further and further out all the time ? 1 es.
6045 Yon think shell is a good deal scarcer now- than it was when you started ? It is.
6046 There is no question about that ? No. I used to do a week’s work, and make enough in that
time to keep me for a month. Now you have to work as much as you can in order to make a living.
601-7 What was a fair average catch per boat in those days ? Between 5 and 6 tons; but some boats
averaged more than that.
H. Clark.
19 J une, 1908.


Hebbeet Bowden, Pearl Sheller and Merchant, examined ;
6048. By the Chairman : What are you ? A pearl-shollor and merchant.
4 6049. What is the number of boats in your fleet P At present nineteen pearling craft and one schooner,
1. which is now in Sydney.
6050. Have you any beche-do-mer vessels ? No.
6051. Are all your vessels for pump diving P Yes.
6052. Are they registered in the State? Every one is registered in the Commonwealth.
6053. Can you tell us how many pump boats there arc in the industry at the present time ? 112.
6054. Do you think the beds afford profitable employment for that number? I should say that is .about
the limit the industry will support profitably.
6055. Do you think the number should be increased ? If there is an increase, it should be very small.
6056. What would you say should be the limit? On results I should say that, if an increase were to
take place, it should not be immediate but gradual, and should not exceed 125 boats within the next
three years. Of course you cannot fix a definite number, because there are weather conditions which
form a natural protection. I may say that a number of vessels now engaged in the beche-de-mer trade
are capable of being converted into pump diving boats; and, including them, the number would
probably come to fully 150 under existing conditions.
6057. Can you tell us whether the beds are prolific or not at the present time? The conditions inshore
are not very satisfactory. That is to say, profitable shelling has been practically exhausted. The result
is that the boats have had to go further out. That is due to the fact that years ago small boats were
engaged in the industry, and mostly worked on the reefs and close in shore.
6058. To what do you attribute the partial depletion of the beds ? To too many boats working. The
grounds have been overworked in my opinion.
6059: So far as you know, was that the cause of the exodus of the Clark fleet? Undoubtedly.
6060. Did you ever hear of their encountering any difficulty in securing the necessary labour for their
fleets ? At various times there have been difficulties in securing sufficient crews to man the boats.
6061. Has your firm suffered through that ? At times we have suffered inconvenience. Even at present
there is difficulty in securing spare divers.
6062. Was there any other cause for their leaving ? Ido not think there was any other cause except
the overworking of the beds.
6063. What do you consider should be the maximum size of exportable shell ? I have always boon a
very ardent advocate of the 6-inch limit: but, since the 5-inch limit has been in existence so long, I
should bo very sorry to see any other alteration until such time as there is an opportunity of getting the
correct size decided; and that can only be done by scientific investigation. Personally, I approve of
the 6-inch limit in preference to the 5-inch because of the great difference in the weight of the shell.
The average weight of 5-inch shell is about 10 oz. per pair; while the average weight of 6-inch shell is
about lb. per pair.
6064. Do you consider that the closure of special areas would assist in restoring the productiveness of
the beds ? The closing of special areas which may justly be considered as spat-producing grounds will
naturally tend to increase the catch of shell on the present areas.
6065. Do you think that any restriction should be placed on the size of vessels employed in the industry ?
That, too, very largely depends upon what legislation is going to be passed. At present I consider it would
be unwise to revert to floating stations.
6066. What leads you to that belief ? When the beds were fairly covered with shell, the most
scientific—the most intellectual—form of shelling was undoubtedly by the schooner, because you had
absolute control over your boats and men. You were then in a position to get all the products, including
the pearls. But since the beds became depleted, the vessels had to scatter in all directions, and the
■ utility of the schooner was practically lost.
6067. Does that not convey the impression that that system of fishing tends to the depletion of the
beds ? Only if the number of boats is in excess of what the beds will stand.
6068. With the boats working from a schooner as a mark day after day, is not the tendency to denude
that area ? That is the tendency to a certain extent; but it must be remembered that the schooner is
the objective, not necessarily the base. The vessels will go on their own account a very considerable
distance from the schooner.
6069. Do you consider that the floating station is beneficial to the industry? It is beneficial to the
pearl-shellers.
6070. But not if you consider the conservation of the industry ? I should qualify that statement. It
would depend upon the number of boats allowed to work. I think that 125 boats could be worked
profitably without materially depleting the beds from either the shore or afloat.
6071. By Mr. Bennett-. But at present you do not think it is desirable to have floating stations ? I do
not think it is desirable from any point of view, under present conditions.
6072. By Mr. Douglas -. Do you think that the closure of any areas would be a better way of preventing
the beds from being over-fished than restricting the number of vessels working on them ? lam not an
advocate for closing beds other than beds for spat-producing purposes. I think that the grounds should
be able to get sufficient spat if a scientific or systematic method of laying shell were adopted in certain
centres.
6073. Can you suggest any such centres ? The base I would suggest would be the Hawkesbury and
Duncan Islands. In a report I wrote I suggested that area. Ido not mean to include the whole of the
beds round those islands, as that would probably lead to hardships.
6074. By Mr. Bennett: What about the Prince of Wales Group? Ido not think there is very much
use in closing the beds there.
6075. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the deep-water areas should bo closed? Undoubtedly, Darnley
Island particularly; and I would suggest that Mount Adolphus should be used as a depot for trans-
planting culture shell for the purpose of replenishing Endeavour Strait and improving the standard of
shell which is now being fished there. In my report I suggested that the base for cultivation purposes
should be taken within an area between latitude 10 degrees and 10’25 South and longitude 142 to 142'25
East. That includes South Jarvis Eeef, Badu, Mua, Duncan, West, and Hawkesbury Islands, and Long
and Hawkesburv Eeefs,
H, Bowdeni
19 June, 1908.


6076. By Mr. Bennett-. Are there good marks for the boundaries? The boundary delimitation should be
a matter for the scientist who is appointed. It would not bo necessary to take up the whole of that area ;
but I would recommend that the scientist should >elect his site within that area. I would not suggest ■
that the whole of it should be closed, as that might entail a hardship on some of the swimming divers and
on the pearling-boats which water at Green Island. Within that area an excellent base could bo secured,
and the flow of the tide should certainly cause the spat to bo drawn away to the Old Ground, and
probably to the eastward. It would not necessarily follow that much spat would be caught within that
area, except by artificial means.
6077. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience in the scientific cultivation of the pearl-oyster?
Ido not think any shellor has had any experience in that. We have had experiments made in transplanting
shell, but I cannot say that any serious attempt has been made at cultivation.
6078. Do you think that the Government would assist the industry by calling in the aid of a good practical
scientist? Undoubtedly. I consider we are entitled to that assistance.
6079. Would it assist in inducing white men to enter the industry ? It would be a means of educating
intellectual white men in the cultivation of shell, and it would tend ultimately to establish the industry on
a more permanent basis. I may remark that I made one experiment by the use of a well boat.
60S0. By Mr. Douglas-. You suggested closing the Daruley and Mount Adolphus Grounds? Yes. I
think Mount Adolphus should be proclaimed a shell-cultivation area.
6081. AYhat would be the advantage of closing the Darnley Ground ? Because it is a very excellent
spat-producing centre. You will see from the chart that there is very little shell until you get from
Darnley to the Warrior Reef, which, to my mind, indicates that the spat is carried over the Wappa Reef,
and finds its lodgment on the western side.
6082. Do you think it feeds the Old Ground as well ? The spat will probably drift to the Old Ground.
Unfortunately we have not the faintest knowledge how long it takes the spat to become fertilised.
6083. The spat from Mount Adolphus? It would certainly feed Endeavour Strait. It is possible the
Old Ground would bo benefited by it also, but that is problematical, since we have no scientific
information as to the time it takes to reach that spot.
6081. By Mr. Bennett-. You think that, as a prelude to cultivation or closure, we should have scientific
research? Yes. Wo have been groping in the dark in the past, and we need scientific research to
obtain information with regard to the pearl-shell, beche-de-mer, and turtle shell.
6085. Do you think the closure of Endeavour Strait was beneficial ? Not to a very great degree.
6086. On account of the short period for wiiich it was closed ? Ido not think that the closure was
rigidly observed. I think it would be a mistake in the interests of those who are engaged in the industry
to close that area, at any rate, before we have got scientific information on the matter, because it is the
one area around here which the vessels resort to in-bad weather. If you close that area, you will
practically lay up all the brats when bad weather comes on.
6087. But there is very little shell to be got there now ? Well; it is all a means to an end. It means
helping to pay expenses. It has been very satisfactory, I understand, for one or two years.
6088. By Mr. Douglas: Asa means of enforcing strict closure, would you suggest an amendment of the
existing law under which a man in charge of a boat found on a closed area should be liable to
imprisonment instead of a fine, as at present ? I would make a man liable to a fine and the forfeiture of
his license. A diver values his license to shell as much as he dreads a fine.
6089. Do you think imprisonment too severe a penalty ? I would not go so far as to imprison a man.
If he chooses to risk his life, I do not think the penalty should be imprisonment. A fine and the
forfeiture of his license should be sufficient.
6090. You would not favour forfeiting the boat ? No.
6091. Because a man might fish in a prohibited area against the instructions of the owner ? Yes.
6092. By Mr. Bennett: Could a diver take a boat to Darnley without the knowledge of the owner?
Yes.
6093. He could fit out the boat at his own expense to do that ? Yes.
6094. You know that it is necessary for a diver to have extra crew and extra gear before he can go to
Darnley ? Yes. The crew is not a very great difficulty with Japanese under present conditions, and I
do not know that there would be much difficulty about the gear, since there is a system of borrowing and
lending in vogue.
6095. At any rate, a diver would have to go to considerable expense to work the Darnley ground—he
would have to secure extra piping? Yes. It does not necessarily follow because an owner fits out
a diver to work at Darnley that the diver will dive in the prohibited area. There is a lot of shell to be
got there that is not within the prohibited area. It is called Darnley shell, but a lot of it is got outside
the prohibited area.
6096. By the Chairman : Would not the cancellation of a diver’s license go hard with the owner? Not
necessarily, unless you restrict the number of licenses issued to divers.
6097. Are there plenty of divers ? There is a system in vogue of getting “ try" divers, which creates
a reserve.
6098. By Mr. Douglas: In addition to the reasons you mentioned, is not the present condition of the
industry partially attributable to the price obtained for shell in London ? I did not refer to the price at
all.
6099. You only said that the beds had been over-fished ? I think we got 2 tons 10 cwt. per boat in 1906,
Mr. May’s statement gives the full average catch. The catch for 1005 cannot be taken into consideration,
as there was a large number of vessels cleared for the Aroc lslands.
6100. Do you remember what year the restriction on licenses was taken off ? I cannot say from
memory.
6101. It was the latter part of the year 1903 ? Either 1903 or 1904.
6102. The figures supplied by Mr. May show that thirty pump boats were added to the fleets that year
They may B not have been working during the whole of the year 1904 ? That is so. It is impossible to
get figures which are absolutely accurate.
6103. By Mr Bennett: The statistices as to the catch per boat are worked out on the same principle ?
Yes. You must take it on an average. .
6104. If you take the years 1901,1902, and 1903, it will be seen that the catch then was not very good,
and the difference in catch is not very great? No; from 3 tons 6 cwt. to 3 tons 10 cwt.

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN' BEFORE THE PEAJit,-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MEB ROYAL COMMISSION.


6105. According to the official figures, the best return was obtained in 1897—" Was there any particular
reason why there was a large quantity of shell taken that year? It was certainly recognised as an
extremely good season.
’ 6106. Did not the -vessels fish down the east coast a good deal during the early part of that year? Tes ;
they got very heavy catches from Princess Charlotte Bay.
6107. Speaking about the supply of labour during the year prior to that in which the Clark fleets left
here, I think you said the labour conditions were not very severe—lt was not altogether on account of the
restrictions regarding the supply of labour that the fleets went away —the catch of shell decreased,
did it not? The labour conditions do not account for the small quantity of shell caught. "We
undoubtedly had a very natural dread or fear of being involved in labour troubles owing to the
Commonwealth legislation.
6108. But facilities were given by the Federal Government to get a supply of labour? Tes. They
passed an Executive Minute, which came into force from 30th November, 1905, allowing a number of
coloured aliens up to 852. That has no reference to Papuans at all. That Minute is still in force.
6109. Should not that number be sufficient, and more than sufficient, to meet the requirements of the
industry ? It is sufficient with the assistance of Papuan labour.
6110. By Mr. Douglas-. In advocating a limit to the number of boats working the pearling-grounds, you
offer no suggestion as to how licenses should be issued so that no monoply should be created, and so
that no person should be given an undue advantage over another? I can hardly see how there can be a
monopoly, provided no objection is raised to white men coming in under a scheme which gives them
assistance in working boats. I take it that your question really leads up to the ultimate object of putting
white divers in the boats ?
6111. Tes ? It is not so much a matter of a monopoly as it is of devising a scheme to encourage white
divers.
6112. If you say that no more than 125 or 150 boats shall bo licensed to work in the industry, that
will practically place the industry in the hands of those who are working it at the present time, unless
other persons can be put into it ? Ido not say that the limit of 125 should be a hard-and-fast limit.
That is the limit under present conditions. If that is fixed as the limit now ,as the beds are replenished,
so you could increase the number of boats to be licensed.
6113. By the Chairman-. Tou have expressed your approval of scientific aid being called in to assist the
industry —do you think that, as a supplement to that, the establishment of a training school for white
divers would be advantageous ? lam absolutely convinced that, under present conditions, it would be
quite useless to attempt to get white divers into the industry.
6114. Tou think that those two steps —that is, scientific research with a view to developing the industry
and a training school for white divers —would not prove an incentive to some white men to go into the
industry? It would prove an incentive only on the condition that the number of licensed boats was
restricted, so as to allow the grounds to stock up, and that assistance by way of a bonus was given to
white divers.
6115. Granting the three conditions just mentioned, do you think the industry could bo carried on by
while divers ? It might be possible. Anything is possible, if you are prepared to pay for it.
6116. White men have been successful in other industries —is there any reason why they should fail in
the pearl-shell industry ? 'They should not fail if they have sufficient inducement.
6117. As one interested in a White Australia and in the welfare and prosperity of Thursday Island, do
you think it is a desirable state of affairs that Japanese should send away from this little community
some £25,000 per annum without any commensurate return to the community ? It is not desirable, if it
is possible to work the industry by other men.
6118. Suppose there were no Japanese available as divers, do you mean to tell me that such a source of wealth
would be allowed to lie in the bottom of the sea without some attempt being made by white men to get
it ? If the Japanese had not been available, we certainly would never have had half the number of boats
working that we have had, nor would we have depleted the grounds to anything like the extent they.havo
been depleted up to the present time.
6119. The white man has surmounted troubles and obstacles in the way of the development of other
industries, and why should he succumb in this one ? Ido not know' that it is a matter of succumbing.
6120. If you say you cannot carry on the industry, that is succumbing ? I say under present conditions.
If you will allow' me, I think I can put forward a scheme which will meet requirements when the beds are
restocked.
6121. By Mr. Bennett -. When you say white men are not able to carry on the industry, do you mean
there is not sufficient inducement for them to do so? Tes. A Japanese works very hard from early in
the morning till late at night under very bad conditions —conditions which a white man would not endure
unless ho was getting a very much better result than the Japanese is getting to-day. If ho engaged in
the woik at all he would soon chuck it up, as he has done before, and go down South to live in comfort.
6122. By the Chairman-. Tour assertions are based on your experience in the southern hemisphere ?
No, here.
6123. I presume you are not familiar with the hard conditions of the thousands of fishermen in the. North
Sea ? I have been in fishing boats off the English coast, though certainly not a great deal. Most of the
fishermen get home every night.
6124. By Mr. Bennett -. Not the North Sea fishermen? No, the trawlers.
6125. By the Chairman : AVe shall be very glad if you will briefly explain your scheme ? I have prepared
my scheme on the basis of a 3-ton catch per year.
6126. What price for shell ? I eliminated that, because it is dealt with in another way. These figures
are all on a 3-ton basis.
6127. By Mr. Bennett : What are the average earnings of divers at the present time ? I have got the
figures all worked out showing that it costs a diver on the present system £264 per annum for wages and
rations. Added to that, he has two dresses at the very least.
6128. Does he find them ? Tea. Then there is the diver’s license, which amounts to £l, and I put
sundries down at £1 at the very lowest, which gives him a total expenditure of £2BO per annum, against
which, assuming his average catch to be 4 tons, he will get £B2 10s. per ton, amounting to £330, which
leaves him £5O dear outside of any pearls he may get.

6129. By Mr Douglas : Is not the basis of tho agreement that, if the diver gets I tons, he gets an extra
£5 a ton ? No ;upto 1 tons he gets £B2 10s.; over 1 tons, £B7 10s. This is the statement I have
prepared, showing the two systems :
H. Bowden.
19 June,l9oB.
6180. Ihj the Chairman ■ Will not the price of shell be a matter for consideration—lt might be £lOO, or
it might be £2OO per ton? That price is a part of the scheme. On the present system he gets £5O clear.
The owner has to pay £B3O for the shell Ecpairs to the boat, at £8 per month, is £B6 ; gear, for twelve
months, at £8 a month, £96 ; licenses, on the average, will amount to £5. Those figures show a profit to
the owner of £3B, under the present system, on a 4-ton basis.
6131. By Mr. Bennett-. Has not the diver to purchase provisions from the owner? From the owner,
yes. The owner provides tho provisions, the cost of which is deducted from the take of shell.
6182. Is there any profit on that ? There might bo from sto 7|per cent.; but you have to consider the
cost of handling and management. You have to keep a staff and an office on shore, and you will not
clear your expenses out of your profits. Then, taking the same basis on the wages “lay,” a diver would
make £lOl on a 4-ton catch as against £5O under the present system. Of course there would probably
be some proviso about pearls, if it became effectual, which would be very doubtful.
6138. By Mr. Douglas : If a diver got over 4 tons, he would get £B7 10s. clear, against which ho would
have no expense ? The diver’s profits over the 4 tons are equivalent to £B7 a ton. Immediately he gets
over the turning point he gets a big margin. The owner’s profit over 4 tons increases at the rate of £lOO
per ton on the wages system. The profit to the owner’s account on the present system, with a catch of over
4 tons, is £35 a ton on present mai ket values. It must be admitted that the owner has the possibility of a
rise in the market, against which he has the possibility of a fall in the market. Taking the one with the
other, the basis is the ruling market rate, for shell delivered in store, cleaned, ready for weighing, of £125
a ton. That is the present value in Thursday Island, and equivalently in London. On the wages
principle, assuming we are signing our divers on at £25 a ton, crew and rations come to £252, repairs
£36, gear £96, licenses £5, diver 4 tons at £2s—£loo, making a total of £489. The owner’s profit is
£ll, while his loss is very heavy if he gets below 4 tons. I would suggest that the Government appoint
a Sheller’s Advances Board, the object being to acquire pearling craft froin the vessels now employed in
the industry ; to hand the same over to suitable, competent, approved European male adults, who "would
be personally employed on the vessels on the following conditions They to pay one-sixth of the
purchase value of the craft in cash, the balance to be paid in eight years in equal annual payments ; the
first instalment to date twenty-four months after the payment of the one-sixth deposit; the Board to
guarantee or provide wages, provisions, and gear for each trip, say of eight, ten, or twelve weeks ; the
shell to be the property of the Board, and to be delivered to them at Thursday Island when demanded, or
at the termination of the trip ; all shell to be shipped by the Board to the Agent-General in London, or
as may be considered advisable ; the Board to advance to the purchaser £125 per ton on the
basis of Old Ground cleaned, unpacked shell, delivered at Thursday Island; the price to be a minimum
price of £125, to be guaranteed by the Government. ...
6134. Do you suggest that they should get that price oven if the shell did not fetch it in London? I
suggest that the Government should guarantee to take Old Ground shell at a minimum of £125 a ton ;

All net proceeds over and above these rates are for credit of producer.
11. Bowden,
19 June,-1908.
• the Board to deduct from each catch, as delivered, the cost of wages, provisions, and gear; the balance,
•\ except a reserve of £3 per month for boat repairs, to bo handed to the producers each trip. My object
3. in making that reservation of £3 is to avoid the possibility of a man absolutely neglecting his vessel.
The Government would always have a reserve of £3 per month for slip repairs, which is based on many
years’ experience of repairs to boats which I have had, and I think others have had a similar experience.
All proceeds of shell over and above the amount advanced—namely, £125 a ton—are to be paid to the
producer, less deductions hereinafter provided. The deductions are as follow: —
(a) Up to and not exceeding net proceeds of year’s catch, £4so—nil;
(b) Up to and not exceeding net proceeds of year’s catch, £450 to £soo—one-third of the
bonus paid ;
(c) Up to and not exceeding net proceeds of year’s catch, £5OO to £6O0 —one-half the bonus
paid;
( d ) Net proceeds of over £6O0 —all bonuses to be refunded.
All pearls found shall bo the property of the diver absolutely. The board shall pay a bonus of £25 per
ton for every 3 tons procured and delivered within a period of twelve months, in the case of vessels
worked by white divers only ; at the rate of £35 a ton for every 3 tons delivered within a period of twelve
mouths in the case of vessels worked by a white diver and white tender. No bonuses to bo paid for any
quantity over 3 tons. No deductions shall be made except upon the basis of £25 a ton. That is to say,
a diver shall not be called upon to repay any bonus between £25 and £35 for the employment of a white
tender, because his expenses will remain just the same whether he gets a small or a large quantity of
shell. The basis I have adopted is this ; —A tender’s wages at present are £4 a month ; and Ido not see
how it is possible to expect to get an intelligent white man to work for less than £6 or £7 a month.
That practically means £3O additional wages for a white tender, as against a coloured tender.
6135. By the Chairman: Would it be possible to employ a tender at so much a month nominal wages,
and give him a share of the “ lay” ? That is not always advisable, because white men do not work so
harmoniously together as the Japanese. If a white man is in charge, he is the master dominant. The
Japanese are not so keen about it.
6136. For over 200 years everyone engaged in the whaling industry, North and South, has been paid
by the “ lay,” from the captain down ? There is no reason why a white diver and white tender should not
make some arrangement under this bonus system. I avoided that system for this reason: I know of
men who are not physically fit to dive. Probably a number of old Thursday Island divers might be
inclined to tackle this scheme; but they could not dive themselves, and it is possible they would not
be able to secure a white diver who would work with them or trust his life to them. For the first
three years purchasers may be allowed to work not more than two coloured aliens in each vessel, thus
allowing present agreements to terminate without hardship to men or employers. After three years,
all labour employed, other than white, should be natives of Australia, the islands of Torres Strait, or
Papuans. Towards this end, I would suggest the gradual termination of the existing arrangements for
the working of native-owned boats under Government officials. This labour is the natural product for
the shelling requirements, and should be employed at a set wage of 30s. per month, with tobacco, singlets,
and lava-lava. This would certainly reduce wages and cost of production. In order to assist Europeans
to engage in the industry, it would be advisable to allow the Board discretionary power as to persons
eligible to come under this system of bonuses and State advances. Instances may occur where an
applicant may not be capable of diving himself, and may not be acceptable to a white diver as tender.
In cases where shell produced is of low quality, it shall be classified in the following way : —Old
Ground, Endeavour Strait, and part of mainland, shell of fair average quality, £125 a ton; Daruley
Island shell, £105; Boigo, Beef, Princess Charlotte Bay, and shell of equal grades, £lOO ; Daru shell,
£B2 per ton.
6137. By Mr. Bennett: Do you put the price of Princess Charlotte Bay at £lOO a ton ? At present you
would not get that. lam rather inclined to the opinion that Princess Charlotte Bay shell will be found
to be of better quality and higher value than it was when we first got it. That would work out on the
scheme I have suggested at a bonus on Old Ground shell of £25 for white diver only, or £35 for white
diver and tender ; on Daruley Island shell, £2l for white diver only, or £3l for white diver and tender;
on Boigo, Beef, and Princess Charlotte Bay shell, £2O for white diver only, or £3O for white diver and
tender; and on Daru shell, £l5 for white diver only, or £25 for white diver and tender. I have worked
out one or two examples of what the result will be on the basis of the net result for the year’s catch at
£450, irrespective of quantity at all. Adding the Government bonus on 3 tons at £25 a ton, that would
make £525, less the cost to produce the shell, which is: Crew’s wages, £l56 —that is basing it on a
high rate ; rations, £7 per month—l have cut that down £1 a month, because I maintain that under
white supervision rations would be less in proportion than they are at present; gear I have also reduced
to £7 a month. For convenience of reference I submit this information in tabulated form:—

6138. You put down £96 a year for gear in your previous statement—What does that include ? Repairs,
dresses, life lines, and the whole outfit, except some repairs which are provided for in the £3 per month
allowance. Those are not approximate estimates, but are based upon actual figures in ray own business.
License fees, for white divers especially, I put down at £3 per boat per annum.
6139. By Mr. Douglas : Is that the boat license fee ? The whole license fee.
6140. Including the fee for diver’s license? Including everything. I maintain that £3 per year
should cover the boat and the diver. In fact, my argument is that it is the boat which should be licensed,
and not the man. That makes a total of £370 as the cost of working a boat per annum. That, on the
£450 net result basis of shell sold, leaves a clear profit of £155, exclusive of pearls. Taking the same
basis of working on £5OO proceeds, and adding the bonus of £75, less a deduction of one-third—£2s—
be refunded to the Government, that makes a total £550, less £370, the cost of production, which
gives the diver £lBO clear, exclusive of pearls. On the basis of £6OO add the bonus of £75, less
one-half refund to the Government—that is, £37 10s.—and you have a return of £562 10s.; deduct £370,
the cost of production, and the diver has £192 10s. clear, exclusive of pearls. The figures I have just given
may be thus tabulated :
The direr gets all the advantage of a rise in the price of shell, without the disadvantages of a fall in price.
If the Government are serious in their intention to make this a white man’s industry, they ought to take
some risk, but that risk would bo very easily safeguarded.
(314,1. Bii the Chairman : What do you consider is the life of a pearling lugger ? The life depends upon
the class of boat. There are boats which have been in existence for twenty years. ,
G142 ' Do you suggest that the Government should take all the boats at a valuation—they are not all
equal in value ? No. I deal with that matter to a certain extent later on. The system works out in
this way : Taking a boat and gear at £450 as, an example, the Government would get from the purchaser
£75 casli. I take it that if a man is worth starting at all ho will have some cash. The Agricultural
Advances Board makes advances only when a certain amount is invested, and the amount under the
scheme I suggest would be very small —£75 cash. Tor the whole of that year ho would have no
further payment to make. From the second to the eighth year, both inclusive, he would have
N


H. Uowdeu.
19 June, 1908.
to make an annual payment of £6l ss. 9d., after which the boat would become' his own property.
The purchaser should have the right to insure his interest iu the equity of redemption at any
• time up to its full value. Tor instance, a man may have paid £3OO, and he should be entitled
to insure his own interest, whether the Government insure or not. Ido not think the Government
should be called upon to insure his interest. All these estimates are made per vessel, exclusive of
pearl values, upon which so much diversity of opinion exists. The value of pearls may, however, be
safely set down at £5O per boat per year. I suggest that the Board should make advances for crew,
rations, and guarantee to owners of vessels who wish to start with white divers that they can
sell on the same terms as the Government. That is provided for in my scheme. If a scheme like
that became law, I would be inclined, if I met a really good diver —a man I knew of old —to
say, “I will give you a boat, you give me £75 cash, the Government will guarantee the sale of shell, the
whole thing is the Government’s, except the money that you have to pay me per annum.” I would then have
sold ray boat on an eight-years’ purchase. The whole of this scheme is based on the conditions you have
enumerated—the establishment of a school of biology, a lugger or pearling craft under a competent white
diver to be attached to that institution to teach young white men not only diving, but seamanship, how to
attend to gear, &e. I maintain that a white diver is not made in a week or two. In the good old days
when all a diver had to do was to get into a small boat and go round here or out to Booby Island and
pick up shell, pretty nearly everybody who was strong enough could become a diver. But those days are
past.
(3113. By Mr. Bennett-. Experience is necessary in order to be a successful diver? Experience and the
right disposition. Our experience is that you will get one diver who will spend twice as much on the
upkeep of his boat as another diver. Some divers are absolutely careless in regard to their boats. That
is why I have reduced the expenses of repairs, and I am certain it would come within the limits I have
specified.
6144. By the Chairman : You submit that scheme as the only means in your opinion of making pearl-
shelling a white man’s industry? As the only possible means. I cannot imagine how it can bo made a
white man’s industry other than by means similar to those I have suggested. Unless there was a better
supply of shell, I think the thing would be doomed to failure on the part of either the Government
or the individual.
6145. By Mr. Bennett: In that scheme you contemplate the employment of coloured crews ? I con-
template that in three years there should be nobody employed in the industry but white divers, and
possibly a big percentage of white tenders, with aboriginal natives of Australia and the adjacent islands
and Papuans as crews.
6146. By Mr. Douglas: I dare say, if the industry was worked by white divers and white tenders, a
certain proportion of white men would come as crews ? They would come as crews with the one object
of becoming divers. I consider that the first experience should be got through the medium of the School
of Biology. The business up to the present has just been a matter of rooting up shell, with an utter
disregard to the future of the grounds.
6147. By the Chairman : I think it is likely you will have more Scandinavians coming out than you need,
as their home environment is more conducive to a life of that kind than the homo environment of
Australians, though there are plenty of young men in Australia who may come ? I do not care what
race they are, provided they are good men. I was going to approximate the cost which this scheme
would land the Government in, but I find it would take a little time to give a forecast. But, on the
present basis, 100 boats catching 300 tons would mean £7,500 bonuses. From that sum the Government
would, under the system I have outlined, anticipate some refund. Of course, there is a possibility of the
Government losing a little on the guarantee, but under ordinary conditions I do not think that is likely
to happen. At any rale, it will be a matter of very minor consideration.
0148. By Mr. Douglas-. In limiting the catch to 3 tons per boat, do you think that would have a tendency
to increase the price of shell in London? No. The price in London can only be increased by better
control. At the other end you would have the Agent-General, which would be a very distinct advantage,
as he could hold shell until prices improved. AVe have been doing that during the last two years under an
agreement between those engaged in the industry at different producing centres. AYhat we have been
doing has been to put a portion of the shell on the market, according to the possible demand, and set
a reserve on it. In many instances the full quantity put on the market has not been sold, and the result
has been that there has been a carry forward. But Ido not anticipate that the carry forward this year
will be of any importance.
6149. Do you think there is a standard maximum price which manufacturers and persons who deal in
pearl-shell can afford to give? Undoubtedly. Pearl-shell is mainly used in the manufacture of buttons.
The demand for buttons is of such a nature that immediately pearl-shell reaches a high price, substitutes
are introduced. When you get beyond the price at which pearl-shell can be purchased for the purpose of
making buttons, the demand for shell falls.
6150. By the Chairman : Looking at this question as an employer of coloured labour, would it not be
more equitable for yourself and the the divers engaged, if the Government did what they have done iu
the sugar industry, and said that after a certain date the employment of coloured labour should cease —
In the meantime, you and others encaged in the industry would be able to prepare yourselves for the
changed conditions ? To avoid hardship, you would want to harmonise with this scheme some system
under which boats now licensed iu the industry would be allowed to use coloured labour.
6151. Assuming that a biological station and a training school for divers were established, do you not
think the industry could be carried on with white men as divers ? You can never bring figures to prove
that white divers will make the thing pay unless they have State assistance.
6152. Assuming that a biological station and a training school for divers have been established, and that
they have attained some success in their operations, how long do you think it would take to make
pearl-shelling a w'hitc man’s industry ? I think you might anticipate that within ten years—it might bo
eight years —the industry would be in the hands of white divers and tenders.
6153. The change was made in the sugar industry in two years? Yes ; at a big price.
6154. No doubt the payment by the Government in this instance would be commensurate with the value
of the industry' ? Ido not think there is one boat-owner who would not gladly welcome the Government
coming in and buying us clean out.


6155. Couldthe Government not adopt a similar course to that adopted in the sugar industry ? It
would be a very expensive and unnecessary scheme.
6156. Would it be as expensive as buying 300 old boats ? There would not be 300 old boats. ]
6157. Well, there would be 300 boats ? No. There are only 112 boats engaged in the industry.
6158. What about the other boats that may come into the industry ? I do not take them into
consideration. I only deal with those at present employed in the industry.
6159. By Hr. Douglas: What class of boat have you got here now ? The boats engaged in the pearl-shell
industry now are really of a good type, with very few exceptions.
6160. By Mr. Bennett: Are there many old boats ? No.
6161. By the Chairman : So far as one can judge, the change in the sugar industry has been successful,
has it not ? Apparently ; but has it not enriched a monopoly ?
6162. By Mr. Douglas : Do you suggest that divers should be required to pass a medical examination ?
I do not think it is at all necessary, because nearly all the men work on the “try” diver system first, and
a man very soon discovers whether he is physically capable. If he is not, he remains as one of the crew
or as tender.
6163. By the Chairman-. You know that the Police Magistrate grants all licenses for pearl-dealers? Yes.
6164. The Sub-Collector of Customs grants other licenses? Yes; the divers’ licenses.
6165. Would it not be more convenient for you and other employers if all the business relating to the
industry was done with the Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries ? Undoubtedly. It should be all under
one head.
6166. By Mr. Douglas-. Could any improvement be made in regulating the issue of pearl-dealers’
licenses? I certainly hold that no licenses should be issued to other than British subjects, or naturalised
British subjects, and all licenses should be contingent upon the licensee not being allowed to purchase
pearls from any person other than a boat-owner or a diver under the scheme I suggest.
6167. Would you suggest any residential qualification for a dealer in pearls? Ido not think that is at
all necessary.
6168. You think that any person who comes from London or the Continent, or anywhere else, should be
permitted to take out a license ? Yes ; if he pays the license fee.
6169. He may only stay here for a week or two, and he pays no income tax on any profit he makes ?
It is possible you can deal with that in the same way as the New Zealand Government deal with
commercial travellers entering the Dominion. All business transacted by them is liable to income tax.
6170. By Mr. Bennett : I gather that you do not consider the present system of issuing pearl-dealers’
licenses satisfactory ? It does not meet the requirements in any way. It would be much better if we
had no licenses.
6171. The main object of these licenses is not to raise revenue ? I was afraid it was.
6172. Prom the owner’s point of view, do you consider that any legislation could be too stringent with
a view to prevent illicit dealing in pearls ? Absolutely no. I would suggest that the legislation on the
subject should be on the lines of the South A frican Diamond Trade Ordinance. When I read it, it
struck me as being very applicable to the conditions here. The present system is worse than useless,
except for revenue-producing purposes.
6173. By Mr. Douglas-. Do you know what proportion of theshell is used for making buttons ? About
80 per cent, is the average. It varies very largely according to the fashions.
6174. You have seen the shell being worked up in the factories ? Yes. The butt or hinge of the heavy
shell is kept for the cutlers for making knife handles. That brings a very good price.
6175. We were told by one witness that a great proportion of the buttons were made in the rough on the
Continent by poor people working at night in their own homes, and they are then sent to the factories
to be finished ? That system is adopted somewhat in Japan ; but in America the whole of the work is
done by machinery. It is hardly touched by hand. It goes in at the one end a lump of shell and comes
out at the other end a finished button, just according to what is required.
6177. Do you think the time is ripe for attempting to assist the industry by establishing a small button
factory in Australia? There are difficulties in the way. For instance, there is a plant in Manila which,
so far as I know, is working at this moment; and there is a plant in Noumea, but there they had to go
under. The trouble is that the fashions change so frequently. The fashions are made on the Continent,
and the manufacturer on this side of the world does not know of a change in fashion until a large
proportion of the business is done, and he is not able, on that account, to compete with the other
manufacturing centres. Again, the European and American button factories are iii centres where
all classes of shell can be purchased. The difficulty here would be that you would be practically
restricted to mother-of-pearl shell. The demand is enormous for the low-grade button, which is
made out of trochas shell.
6178. Is not the trochas-shell found here ? In very small quantities. I doubt if it would be profitable.
The trouble of working it is very much greater than mother-of-pearl. It would certainly be an advantage
if a factory could be established, but inquiries want to be made before undertaking the venture, so as to
decide with a fair degree of certainty as to whether it will be a success. I am a little afraid of it. I
have arrangements in train for getting a price for the plant in New Caledonia, which is for sale—-it is
just a matter of price—the object being to run it with a company. I went into the matter very
exhaustively with large warehousemen in Sydney and Melbourne. They make large quantities of slop
clothing, and enormous quantities of buttons are sold, and we import buttons from Japan, for instance,
to sell to them. Continental houses import large quantities of buttons from the Continent.
6179. By the Chairman-. You import buttons from Japan? Yes. They are made from lingah, trochas,
and other small shell. . „. , . 0 , ,
6180. There are some large manufacturers m Brisbane, too i les. llioy buy large quantities of
6181° n i presume it was intended to work the factory in New Caledonia by couvict labour? No. It
was to be worked by liber is. The difficulty was that they were practically working on one class of shell,
and they could not learn of the changes in the fashions and were not able to compete with the outside
markets In addition to that, the imported article can be sold much cheaper than they can afford to

19 June, 1908.
6183. Not New York ? No ; but New York creates a fashion of its own. For instance, it created two
v fashions within my knowledge. One was the enormous buttons for ladies’ winter jackets. That caused
i. a tremendous spurt in the price of shell.
6184. That was black-lip shell, was it not ? Mainly ; but they use the mother-of-pearl shell, too. The
last fashion created in New York was when about 100 little buttons wore put on the sleeves of ladies’
jackets—small buttons about half the size of marbles. That caused heavy medium-grade shell to go up
to a higher price than we have been getting for chicken shell. Up to that lime the shell wanted was
clean chicken shell, from 5 inches to inches. Owing to the demand for the heavy low-grade shell for
these buttons, the Aroe Island shell scored very heavily, as their shell filled the demand.
6185. By Mr. Douglas : The shellers sent a representative to London and the Continent some time ago ?
Yes.
6186. Did any practical benefits result from his visit ? The practical benefits were nil beyond the
information we obtained, which was very voluminous. We were not able to attain the object we hoped
to achieve, but I am not prepared to divulge what that object was, as I do not thiuk it would be fair.
6187. By the Chairman : I should think the great bulk of the shell was used on the Continent ? It was
until within the last four or five years. America is now the biggest buyer.
6188. They get a large supply of shell from the Bay of Panama ? Yes.
6189. A lot of the black-lip shell from the Eastern Pacific goes to San Francisco? Yes, and they use
enormous quantities of the sweet water mussel shell. At one time a lot of that shell was sent to London,
but it did not sell. The Americans discovered that it would passthrough a wringing machine, and that it
had a commercial value.
6190. Was the Tridacna, or clam shell, never tried for button purposes? It is too dead. There is no
lustre in it. You might almost as well use dead mother-of-pearl shell.
6191. Is there anything else you would like to put before the Commission? If you want information as
to London shell sales for the last two years, I can give you the figures.
6192. The figures for the world’s supply ? The world’s supply that passes through the London market,
and the bulk of it passes through that market.
6193. What proportion does Queensland contribute ? In 1906 Queensland contributed 4,090 cases out
of a total of 21,245 ; in 1907, 4,272 cases, out of a total of 20,402. A good portion of shell from the
Aroe Islands was sold in America. In 1906 the Aroe Islands produced 7,883 cases ; Western Australia,
9,272 eases; Queensland, 4,090 cases ; total, 21,245 In 1907, the Aroe Islands produced 6,730 cases ; West
Australia, 9,399; Queensland, 4,272; total, 20,401. During 1906 all shell appears to have passed
through London, but, in 1907, 150 tons, approximately, were sold direct from producing centres to
America. Those figures show how equal the world’s supply was for those two periods. Unfortunately,
I have not been able to get records dating further back in time to lay them before the Commission.
The results for 1908, taking the January and March sales —the sales take place every two months
throughout the year —are as follow:—Aroe Island shell, 1,382 cases; Western Australia, 2,632;
Queensland, 941; total, 4,955 cases. The sales for the same period in 1906 totalled 8,621 cases, and in
1907, 6,718 cases, so that it will be seen that there is a very heavy falling off this year. There were
withheld, or withdrawn, from the last sales, approximately, 1,400 cases.
6194. Are the pearl-shell sales all in the hands of one broker in London? No; there are many brokers,
and a shipper can nominate his own broker.
6195. By Mr. Bennett: And consign to him ? No. The shell is consigned to the banks and merchants.
The brokers do not touch consignments at all; they simply act for agents, whether they are banks or
private firms.
6196. Does Queensland shell compare favourably as to quality with the shell from other places ? The
high-grade Queensland shell is the best shell on the market.
6197. Better than Manila shell ? Better than Manila shell, though some of that is very fine bold shell.
Generally speaking, our Old Ground shell is the highest quality. The Americans only used to buy
certain grades. When I was in America, I could have sold all the best shell we produce. They do not
want the low-grade shell; they have not time to deal with it, because their own sweet-water mussel
shell meets all requirements. A lot of that shell can be obtained, and it only costs from £25 to £35 per
ton.
6198. By Mr. Douglas : Can you give us the prices for shell in London ? In 1902 the price was high,
going up to £2OO per ton. In 1903 it averaged from £lBO to £l5O. The fall was about the November
sales. In 1904 the market was unsettled, and the price came down from £l5O to £llO a ton. It is
significant that in that year we had a very low catch of shell. For the first six months of 1905 the
price averaged, approximately, £l2O per ton, but hardened after the May sales, reaching about £l4O.
In 1906 the average price was about £135. The average to date this year is from £125 to £l3O. Those
amounts are approximate only, as it is impossible to arrive at anything definite —the quality varies so
much, and there is a constant fluctuation in prices; so that you can only work out a general average.
6199. By Mr. Bennett -. Would it not be beneficial to the industry, from a mercantile point of view, if
the Darnley shell were shut out of the market? Ido not think it would materially affect the result,
as the shell coming from tjiere now is of fair quality.
6200. Have they worked out the old shell there? Yes. That is the reason why I think the Princess Charlotte
Bay shell will probably be of better quality now than the shell we got there some time ago. I reckon
the value of the Darnley Island shell to bo from £l5 to £2O per ton below the value of the best Old
Ground shell.
0201. Do you think it would be beneficial, from an administrative point of view, if, in the legislation
dealing with pearl-shell and beche-de-mer, the fisheries were kept distinct, even though under one Act?
Yes. 1 think they should be under one Act, but kept under distinct headings, because the provisions
which will apply to the one industry will not in every instance apply to the other. The Act should be
divided into three parts, dealing with pearl-shell, beche-de-mer, and turtle fishing, respectively, the black-
lip shell being included in either the beche-de-mer or turtle-shell provisions.
6202. It is only worked as a by-product ? Yes.
6203. 1 think you suggested that the license lees for vessels should be made uniform? Yes.
6204. And the diver’s fee abolished ? Yes. The fee for a boat licensed to work with a coloured diver
should be £4 per annum, and the fee for a boat licensed to work with a white diver should be £3 per


annum; and that fee should include both the boat and the diver in each case. There should be no
pilotage. I should like to add that all natives using boats under 5 tons register should be allowed to get
their licenses free. There might be a set of articles, or some system adopted under which the boats
would be traceable.
6205. Have you any idea what the average working life of an ordinary diver is ? There are so many
surrounding conditions to be considered that it is very difficult to say. I suppose you speak now of white
divers ?
6206. Jvo; any diver—You have had experience of white divers? I have had enough experience ; but
it has not extended over a sufficiently long period to enable me to answer that question.
6207. Well, any diver? It depends upon the man’s physique and the life he leads—whether he is
prudent, and works only in shallow water, or whether he goes into deep water. Something also
depends upon the age at which a man starts diving. If he starts at from twenty to twenty-five years
of age, there is no reason why he should not continue diving for ten or twelve years. Ho might
stale a little,, because there is no change; they do not go down South for trips in order to build
themselves up. A Japanese very seldom goes home, but is diving all the time.
6208. The relaxation is a periodical spree ? In some cases.
6209. By the Chairman: In view of the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act, do you not think
it would be a-protection to you as an employer if a diver was required to undergo a medical examination
before being licensed ? Ido not think so, because everv diver who has any capacity for the work has
experience, more or less, as a “ try ” diver before be is placed in charge of a boat. Every boat under the
scheme I have suggested, or any other scheme, should be allowed to carry a “ try ” diver, so that the
boat may be prepared for any contingency. If I were to lose three of my alien divers, the boats in
which they are engaged would be practically laid up, because at present there are no other divers
available. Ido not see that there can be any objection to a diver being required to undergo a medical
examination, and I would not oppose it for one moment. It might act beneficially.
6210. By Mr. Bennett: Would it not tend to raise the physical standard of the divers ? It would mean
that men who considered themselves physically capable might not be allowed to engage in the industry.
I might remark that I consider the present system should be allowed to continue for a given period.
6211. Undisturbed ? Yes. Those now engaged in the industry should be allowed to continue with
coloured divers for a period to enable them to carry on.
6212. By Mr. Douglas: You have no boats at present in the b@che-de-mer industry ? Ho.
6213. Are there any suggestions you wish to make under that heading ? The only thing I would suggest
is that there should be some scientific investigations made to prevent the present depletion of the reefs
without any knowledge as to how they are going to be restocked. We do not know anything about the
habits of the slug, and the present system of carrying on the industry is very unwise.
6214. You recommend scientific investigations regarding the habit of the slug P Yes ; and also that more
notice should be taken of the present criminal action of men slaughtering turtle in the way they are
doing. In my opinion the turtle industry is one that might be worked up very successfully in conjunction
with the cultivation of pearl-shell by white divers, allowing them to take up areas on the foreshores
for the breeding of turtle.
6215. By the Chairman : Combining the turtle with the cultivation of pearl-shell ? Yes. The bBche-
de-mer is doubtful; but I think the turtle and the pearl-shelling would form two very important factors
in the production of revenue by white men.
6216. By Mr. Bennett: With a Torres Strait line of steamers, it would probably be doubly valuable ?
Yes. There is an enormous market for the turtle-shell itself. The hawksbill turtle is slaughtered
wholesale for it. There is a big market for the green turtle, and for the calipash and calipee. I have
been instrumental in going in for the industry in a somewhat expensive way; but it was done in such a
crude way that I do not think it has had a fair test.
6217. By the Chairman : Do you not think that, with the advent of the Torres Strait steamers, the turtle
can be sent to England ? Ido not think it is possible. The calipash and the calipee and the flippers
have always a good value, and the fat is of good quality; but we have not yet learned how to cure it,
with the result that it arrives in a condition which destroys its value very largely.
6218. By Mr. Douglas : Is there an open market for the flippers in England. Undoubtedly.
6219. Is there more than one source through which it can be disposed of ? Yes. It is largely controlled
by one man, who, I understand, has big interests in the West Indies ; but there is no reason why it should
not be sold like pearl-shell on the open market.
6220. By Mr. Bennett: Of course, the West Indies must continue for all time to have an advantage over
the Queensland product ? The turtle is scientifically farmed in the West Indies. Hero the industry
has been treated with utter disregard for the future.
6221. By Mr. Douglas: You went in for a somewhat large venture in the beche-de-mer industry last
year ? lam sorry to say I did I fitted out a schooner with an up-to-date plant for boiling, drying,
and curing the fish, and it proved an absolute financial failure—a very heavy one.
6222. What was that due to ? Largely to the scarcity of fish and the want of knowledge as to where
it could be got, the correct times for getting it, and also, if I may so term it, to the invasion of the
Japanese. I think there are too many in the industry.
6223. Until recently the beche-de-mer vessels of over 15 tons fitted out in ports other than Thursday
Island, had to employ a certificated master—Do you think that should apply, to the beche-de-mer
industry as distinct from the pearling industry, seeing that the beche-de-mer vessels have such long
distances to go right out to the Coral Sea? If they have Australian natives on board, they should be
made to carry approved masters.
6221. Of course the tonnage really does not matter in such a case ? W nen vessels employing Australian
natives go to work iu those waters there should be some protection for the natives. Some competent
person should be in charge, though he might not be a certificated master. That would put an absolute
bar on the industry. If you are going to deal with the turtle industry, some regard should be paid to
the mating and laying seasons. No fish should be allowed to be killed during those seasons. A close
season should be proclaimed and enforced. With regard to aboriginals, I have always advocated that
the recruiting should be under Government supervision, and conducted by a Government agent. The
present system of boats, either owned or officered by coloured men, going down the coast recruiting
labour should be stopped. It has led to all sorts of abuses in the past, and has been responsible for a
lot of trouble.

■ G225. By Mr. Bennett ; And the natives should be brought to a depot in Thursday Island? Tes. The
\ agent need not necessarily be a Government officer ; but he should bo an authorised person, with whom
3. owners requiring crews could arrange for the delivery in a certain time of a certain number of natives
from the mainland.
G226. By the Chairman : Does not the greatest evil esist in granting licenses to aliens to recruit
aboriginals? A license is granted, and the alien goes down the coast, and he does the work himself.
That should not be allowed at all. If I want to employ twenty natives, 1 should be able to go to some
person who is solely responsible, and say to him, “I want twenty aboriginals in January.” He arranges
for the recruiting of those boys upon payment of a fee by me. I have to deliver them here at the
termination of their agreement—I think twelve months should be the limit—and he returns them to their
homes. The fact of his being responsible for bringing them here and returning them to their homes
would relieve the employer of any stigma that may accrue, and that has often accrued in the past.
6227. By Mr. Bennett : Do you consider that an employer could afford to pay a fair fee for recruiting
under those conditions ? It would pay them very much better than the present system. There have
been instances where men have been away two or three weeks, and have come back with two or three
men, for the simple reason that there is no control. Then again, the natives, knowing that they have
one man to look to, to see that they will get proper food and be put in proper boats, will be more
inclined to work. A license to engage labour should bo subject to the Protector of Aboriginals being
satisfied as to the man’s character, though I take it that is a detail that is now in force.

Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Eeedeeick Chaeles Hodel, Merchant and Pearl Sheller, further examined:
6228, By Mr. Douglas-. Have you any boats engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? I have three this
, year, and had two last year.
. G229. Is the beche-de-mer not so profitable, or are the indications not so favourable this year as they
were last year ? The catch so far is below the catch of last year.
6280. On what system are the boats in the beche-de-mer industry worked ? I have one boat leased to a
white man at so much per month. The other two boats are worked on a “ lay ” by Japanese.
6281. Can you give us the basis of the agreement on which they are worked ? The “ lay” last year was
dependent upon the quantity of fish obtained. The “lay” this year depends upon the quantity and
upon the price, ranging from £22 10s. to £30 per ton for the owner.
6232. Do the Japanese get the full market price ? The “lay” is on this basis: When the fish sells
well I get a better price for my share of it, and beyond that the Japanese gets the benefit of any advance
in the price.
6233. Does the Japanese pay the ■whole of the expenses? The whole of the expenses —wages and
provisions.
6234. Gear? Not gear, or licenses, or insurance.
6235. Do you fit up the boats with the necessary smoke-house and boilers? The Japanese pay for some
of the tanka and a proportion of the repairs. The smoke-house was in my best boat, when the Japanese
came and took her over from a white man ; but any repairs to the smoke-house since then they have paid
for.
6236. When bcche-de-mer was bringing £150 a ton, you would get £30 a ton, and the Japanese the
balance ? Thar was the case last year.
6237. What was the average catch last year? My boat got 13 tons.
6238. What was the average price ? About £130.
6239. Then the man in charge would get something like £1,300 for his year’s work ? In 1906 they
drew, roughly, £600 clear, less what they might have given in the way of tips to the crew when they
were at Mackay. In 1907 they got, roughly, a little over £800.
6240. Was that after paying for provisions ? After paying everything they had to pay, less any tips
they might have given.
6241. Was that for two men? Yes.
6242. Were those two men working in partnership? I do not know, but as far as I know they are
partners.
6243. Were there only two Japanese on the boat? Yes.
6244 The rest were natives ? Yes. She is a 25-ton boat.
6245. Was that a particularly successful catch as compared with the catch of other boats ? She had, if
not the largest, the second largest catch of any boat working from here.
6246. Was that the “Nancy”? Yes.
6247. Is she engaged in the industry this year ? Yes.
6248. On the same basis? On a different “lay.” The “lay” this year fluctuates according to the
price of beche-de-mer.
6249. Is there any difficulty in obtaining aboriginal labour for the boats ? Not a great deal, because
they are allowed to sign on for twelve months now. The “ Nancy” has never had any trouble worth
speaking of with regard to labour, because she is an extra good boat.
6250. Are the aboriginals better treated by Japanese than by Europeans? The Japanese treat them
well. The same men have been working for three years for the Japanese who are at present in the
“ Nancy.” They are brought home, and then sign on again.
F. C. Hodel.

6251. Do the natives show any preference to work for Japanese as compared with Europeans ? I think
they do, because the Japanese take better care of them, in a general way, than Europeans are reputed to
have done. I
6252. In the way of feeding? Yes. The “ Nancy” men cook the food for the natives, so that they may
pet better food.
6253. They are Binghis ? Yes. Then the Japanese work them only one shift a day. Most Europeans
take the natives out for two shifts a day. The Japanese work one long shift of four or five hours, and
that is the day’s work. The Europeans generally take them out on the reef twice each day, and the
aboriginals consider that they are always working, and that they have no time for rest or play. Vuioow.tr*
6254. What distance do they go ? My “ Nancy ” has worked the whole coast from Eastern Eields down
to Mackay, and right down to Swain Beef, outside the Barrier. Ido not think there is a reef outside
the Barrier that she has not worked on. The Japanese wanted me to let them work some islands off
New Caledonia; but I refused. They also pressed me very hard this year to allow them to fake
the aboriginals to Samarai, and I believe the Protector would have allowed them to do that, but|l refused
them permission.
6255. Do you know of any boat which went there ? Some boats went there.
6256. That is at the eastern end of New Guinea? Yes. It is outside Queensland waters.
6257. Do you think that should be prevented ? Yes ; because if the aboriginals are allowed to go there,
they will be beyond our control entirely.
6258. Eor what term do the aboriginals now engage ? Ten shillings to £1 a month.
6259. What is the length of their engagement ? Twelve months.
6260. Does that assist the persons in charge to remain on the ground, seeing that it is longer than the
previous term ? It is a very much better system for the aboriginals and for the owners of boats than
the one previously in force.
6261. What is the method of recruiting on the mainland? They simply go down to the mainland, and a
person takes flour and distributes it to the parents or guardians of the natives, and the natives come to
them. All the men engaged on my boats since the present Japanese have had them have been obtained
from the east coast.
6262. Then you have to go down there from Thursday Island to recruit them ? Yes.
6263. That takes some time ? It generally takes a month, but this year Mr. Costiu gave the boats
special privileges, and they were allowed to sign the crews on again after coming back, on condition that
they gave them a month’s spell at home.
6264. Are the Japanese to be trusted to give them a spell fora month? Well, I would not give them
that concession. Although I was pleased to get it for my firm, I feel that it is not the best thing for the
aboriginals.
6265. You know that it is proposed to establish an aboriginal station at Lloyd Bay ? Yes.
6266. Will that assist in regulating the engagement of natives ? It should assist materially. [ should
think it is a very good scheme, provided the officer who is put in charge is a conscientious man who will
fear no traders or anybody, but do his duty. But, if the officer is weakly, it will be a failure, and will do
more harm than good.
6267. Do you consider that the Government should supervise the whole of the recruiting ? I advocated
that years ago with Dr. Both and Mr. Foxtou. Mr. Foxtou at that time favoured the idea, and with
myself appealed to the then Treasurer, Mr. Cribb, to make the necessary provision for it; but Mr. Cribb
said the times were too bad, and he could not find the money.
6268. If the Government had the whole of the recruiting in their hands, would that be for the benefit of
the natives? If the Government had taken up the recruiting on the west coast of the Peninsula, the
missionaries would not have resented the men going out to service so much as they have done. The
missionaries resented the men going into the boats, but more particularly they resented the boatmen
going to the mission station and demoralising the whole community.
6269. Do you think boatmen were in the habit of taking liquor to the natives? I regret to say that my
own “Nancy” on one occasion, before the Japanese had her, went to Mapoon, and lay there a fortnight,
and had the school children drunk.
6270. Who supplied the grog —the Japanese? No ; it was the white man in charge. I will not mention
his name. 1 built the boat for him. There were two white men on board, and they were both intoxicated,
and did not know what was going on.

V. C. Hodel.
20 June, 1908.
6271. Do you recommend that the Government should do the whole of the recruiting in the event of a
station being established at Lloyd Bay? I would not recommend the Government interfering in any
way with the mission station at this stage, because I fear bcche-de-mer is getting so very scarce that very
soon there will not be anything like the same request for labour that there has been. The owners will be
compelled to withdraw their boats from the beche-de-mer industry very soon.
6272. Are there many aboriginals engaged in swimming diving ? Not many now.
6273. But there were at one time ? Yes; aboriginals of .Australia—not of the islands.
6274. Their services have been available recently for the bcche-de-mer boats ? Yes.
6275. In the event of this station being established at Lloyd Bay, would it be advisable for the natives
to be signed on there ? No, unquestionably. At least I should not resent their being signed on there, but
I think their discharge should take place at Thursday Island, because, if you do not discharge them at
either Thursday Island or Cooktown, you will have to create a dep6t for stores at Lloyd Bay, and the
establishment of such a store there would open the door to abuses.
6276 Do yotl know what the present condition of the reefs is, so far as the supply of bcche-de-mer is
concerned ? Practically exhausted. Of course, there is a certain amount of fish always making its W'ay
from the deeper waters on to the shallow reefs, and there is a certain amount of fish which has not been
taken * but there is no large quantity of fish.
6 ’77 *What depth of water do they dive in for fish ? Up to 6 fathoms; but diving beyond 4 fathoms
for beche-de-mer is not successful. .
6278 "Why is it not successful ? In deep water the diver has not the same time down below, inasmuch
as he has 2 fathoms further to go down and 2 fathoms further to come up.
6279 There is not a great deal of information available as to the habits of the bcche-de-mer, is there ?
Scientifically, very little.


F. C. Hodel.
20 June, 1908.
. 0280. Do you consider that the beche-de-mer industry is one which is worthy of scientific investigation
,iu conjunction with the pearl-shelling? No; because for an individual to control the beche-de-mer or
i. to build up an industry would mean that he would have to do it away from all settlement, as none of
what they call the home reefs are over likely to be used to any extent for beche-de-mer. The best
beche-de-mer is obtained further afield, and it is always a troublesome thing to handle, as you have to send
your boats out to work for a long period away from any centre. The closure of the reefs entirely, and
the refusal to grant any licenses, would certainly do some good, and give the beche-de-mer an
opportunity to recover itself.
6281. There is no beche-de-mer found on the islands or reefs adjacent to Torres Strait ? There is
beche-de-mer on all the islands around here, but of very inferior quality.
6282. By the Chairman : It would be very hard to enforce closure at such distances ? Tes. Under any
circumstances it is an objectionable calling.
6283. By Mr. Douglas: Do you think the life in the beche-de-mer industry is unsuitable to white men
in charge of vessels—l do not mean the actual work of diving or fishing ? It is more or less
demoralising, because one or two white men have to go away from all contact with civilisation for four
or five months, their only associates being a number of aboriginals of the lowest type. The life is
infinitely harder and more hazardous than life in pearling boats.
6284. The Merchant Shipping Act provides that a vessel of 15 tons or over shall have a certificated
master—ln the shelling industry, the recognised maximum exemption from that provision has
been 25 tons; but in the Southern ports—Cooktown, Cairns, and other places —15 tons has been the
limit of exemption—ln view of the fact that vessels of over 15 tons have to go to such a distance in
their fishing operations, do you think it would be advisable to enforce that provision in the Merchant
Shipping Act ? I think the one regulation exists for all ports, and that boats up to 25 tons are allowed
to work without a certificated master, whether in Torres Strait or in any other port in Queensland. I
think 25 tons is a very fair limit for a fishing vessel.
6285. Do you know anything of the nature of the fishing from Cooktown ? The system of working
beche-de-mer has completely altered of recent years. My first knowledge of it was when it was worked
with large schooners and small sailing cutters. Now it is worked with a schooner and dinghies. The
schooner, or store vessel, shifts about much more than was the custom in the olden times. They used to
anchor in one place for months at a time, and the small craft sailed round the neighbouring reefs and
brought the beche-de-mer back to the schooners. Now, perhaps, the schooners shift their anchorage
every day, and the dinghies only row 200 or 300 yards away from the store ship.
6286. We have some evidence before us to the effect that some years ago there was a fair number of
vessels working from Cooktown, owned and in charge of white men ; but since the advent of the Japanese
boats, more particularly the larger boats from Thursday Island, and now that they are building larger
vessels at Cairns, which are going out in charge of Japanese, the white man has been worked out of it ?
I feel myself that the white man has been worked out of the industry by the Japanese.
6287. As an advocate for white divers in the shelling industry, do you not consider that the beche-de-mer
industry might be conserved for the benefit of white men in charge ? I consider that the industry
should be conserved on the same lines as the pearl-shell industry, and no man should be allowed to hold
a license unless he is a white man.
6288. You think boats working in the beche-de-mer industry should be in charge of Europeans ? Tes ;
but not necessarily in charge of certificated masters.
6289. Do you think there would be a fair living in it for a number of Europeans ? Not at present. I
would suggest that the beche-de-mer industry be closed down for three, four, or five years.
6290. Except to Europeans ? Yes ; or closed down for all time, except to Europeans. Europeans would
not rush it at the very first. We would be inconvenienced by having our boats laid up. I only put up
with Japanese because everybody else was doing it. I could not help myself—no white people were
applying for boats.
6291. Is there a written agreement in existence for working the beche-de-mer boats on a “ lay ” the same
as in the shelling industry ? I have never had a written agreement with any of my men.
6292. Then how are they signed on articles ? At so much per ton. 1 believe that the whole system by
which the b6che-de-mer and pearling boals are worked is more or less an evasion of the Act. The
aliens will not work under any other system; and the Government have allowed the aliens to drive out
the whites ; and we have to use the alien, who will not adopt any other system.
6293. In recommending that no more vessels be allowed to work in the industry unless they have
Europeans in charge, would you protect the existing rights of men at present licensed to take charge of
vessels ? I would renew their licenses for say five years, but no longer, unless you were going to close
down the industry altogether except to Europeans. As these rights have been conferred on these men,
it would be unjust to exclude them. I would certainly recommend closure altogether for a short period,
then you would get the alien out and the white man could come in.
6294. By the Chairman : Would not closing the industry down for five years entail a lot of supervision to
prevent poaching at such a distance ? If the people who have been working the industry felt that the
beche-de-mer was working up, they would go to the extent of coming down from Papua and other
places to poach our grounds. Seeing that they have wanted to go to grounds outside Queensland
jurisdiction, it is pretty good evidence that they realise it is not worth while going down our coast at
present.
6295. Of course we could only patrol inside the Barrier Beef ? I only advocate closure for three years.
By that time beche-de-mer will be sufficiently plentiful to let the white man come in. The Japanese
cannot get into Papua, and it would not pay them to fit out a vessel from New Caledonia or German
New Guinea to come into our waters, because the beche-de-mer is so scarce. There is hardly a boat that
would not have gone to Papua this year if the owners had allowed them to go.
6296. By Mr. Douglas : Is not labour the most essential feature in the working of the industry ?
Unquestionably, aboriginal labour.
6297. Then the Queensland Government can control the industry by stopping the employment of
aboriginals? Tes, and by not allowing boats to be licensed.
6298. You said just now that boats could be licensed from Papua? Not Japanese boats.
6299. Are you sure of that ? I understand they will not give a license to a Japanese boat.


6300. We have been told that Japanese can get naturalised in Papua without much difficulty? I think
that information is erroneous. His Excellency the Administrator told me last year that an Ordinance
was then ready for presentation to the Council, which would exclude the Japanese entirely. That was:
when the Japanese strike was on here, and he hoped he would get that through when he went hack. He
said they certainly would not let the Japanese get a foothold in Papua. Originally there was nothing to
stop the Japanese going there.
6301. Have you had any Papuans engaged in your beche-de-mer boats ? No.
6302. You do not know how they work ? Papuans by repute —at least those wo get—do not make good
swimmers, but they are good enough for working in the beche-de-mer boats on the shallow reefs in 2
fathoms ol water.
6303. By the Chairman : To what do you attribute the present low price of beche-de-mer ? Primarily to
the fall in the value of the dollar in China.
6304. By Mr. Douglas : What is the average price now offering for good quality black, red. and teat fish ?
It will run up to about £100 per ton.
6305. How does that compare with the prices ruling last year? I sold some last year as high as £147
10s. Pop the same fish now I would not get more than £100, if I could get that.
6306. Have you known it to be higher than £147 10s. a ton? In the shipment that I sold for an
average of £147 10s., there were about 5 tons, some of which was valued at £200 a ton, while some was
not valued at more than £100.
6307. What is the method of selling beche-de-mer ? Mostly by calling tenders among the Chinese
dealers.
6303. Do the Chinese dealers here buy all the fish ? Nearly all.
6309. Is any shipped to China for sale? Occasionally it has been shipped to China—bn the last occasion
with success.
6310. Better prices were realised in China than here ? Yes.
6311. The consumption of beche-de-mer is almost wholly confined to the Chinese ? Yes ; so far as I
know.
6312. Do you know whether the Chinese have recently formed any combination among themselves to
keep the price down? I have had circumstantial evidence enough to convince me that a compact did
exist three months ago, but I think that it has broken down now, though I am not certain.
6313. Are there any boats at present working in the industry that you know are owned by Japanese J
Several are owned by Japanese.
6314. Are they naturalised British subjects? Some are naturalised. In one case a Chinese owner is a
naturalised British subject; in another case he gets his boats licensed through dummying. The owner of
one of these boats told me that he had sold his boat to a Chinaman, but the Chinaman’s name does not
appear as the owner.
6315. Is there a system of dummying going on in the industry ? There is no question about it.
6316. How are they able to get licenses for the boats ? Somebody is unscrupulous enough to make a
false declaration of ownership.
6317. Under the Act, persons doing that are liable to a severe penalty ? Anyone who makes a false
declaration of ownership is liable to two or three years’ imprisonment, but there has never been any
sustained effort made to put it down. I am quite satisfied that a fearless officer could have put a stop
to the system when it was first initiated. 1 have made that statement to the officers themselves.
6318. Have you had any offer made to you in connection with this matter ? On many occasions I have
lost a good deal of business because I have refused to dummy. On one occasion an official admitted
to me that he knew of one deliberate case of dummying, and that the person who made the declaration
admitted the whole thing to him, but he did not feel justified in prosecuting him.
6319. As such propositions have been made to you, you have good grounds for believing that a system
of dummying is going on ? The Japanese themselves tell me that they own the boats in many cases;
and in two cases the reputed owners have admitted to me that the boats do not belong to them, but to
Japanese.
6320. Can you give us any idea as to how the dummying is done ? Originally it was done very openly
as far as their book work was concerned. Latterly it is done by the Japanese lending the European a
certain amount of money —whatever money he puts into the concern. Where books are kept at all well,
that is put to the man’s credit in the loan account. Originally some of these transactions carried no
interest. Latterly, I think, most of them are shown as bearing interest, so as to appear more formal.
6321. Is there anything further you would like to bring under the notice of the Commission regarding
the industry ? No.
6322. There are a number of West Indians, half-caste South Sea Islanders —Lifu men —who have been
in the State for a number of years working in the beche-de-mer industry—Would it not be rather hard
to exclude them, as you would by restricting licenses to men in charge to Europeans ? I would certainly
confer the same rights on that class of men as on our own people, because theyare practically domiciled
here. The Japanese are not domiciled here in any sense ; but the other men are, and, if they make any
•profit out of the industry, that profit is retained in the State. I would not issue any new licenses to such
persons, but would confine them to the men already engaged in the industry, some of whom have been
here for twenty or thirty years, and are honourable men.
John Alexander Betjce, Master Mariner, Harbour Master and Pilot, and Inspector of Pearl Shell
Fisheries, Thursday Island, examined :

Fisheries, Thursday Island. , QQf . '•
6325 How long have you been at Thursday Island ? Since 1896.
6326. You were once in charge of a vessel here which had a new diving apparatus on board ? Yes ; I
was in the “ Marion Fenwick” and the “ Parua.’’
6327. Was the apparatus improved on the second occasion r xes.
6328 Did you carry out any experiments yourself ? Yes; the engineer and I did most of the diving.

-20 June, 1908.
. 6329. Were the experiments successful or otherwise? As far as the going down was concerned, they
s were perfectly successful ; but the trouble was moving about on the bottom.
(.6380. What depth did you go down P Forty-five fathoms on the bottom, and 50 fathoms where there
was no bottom. In the latter case I landed in a hole on Calico K’eef.
6331. Did you see many shell when you went down? AVhen I first went down I could not tell shell
when I saw them.
6332. Why ? Because they looked like stones. The eye has to be educated to recognise the shell.
6333. Have you been down in a diving dress? Yes.
6334. Prom what you know of a diver’s life, do you think the pearl-shelling industry could be carried on
by white divers ? Tes ; but not under present conditions. They would have to be educated as divers.'
6335. Do you think the services of a marine biologist to carry on experiments in the cultivation of the
pearl-oyster would be of assistance to the industry ? I think the services of a biologist would be of great
use, as we should then learn more about pearl-shelling than we know now.
6336. What do you think of the suggestion to establish a training school for white divers in connection
with a biological station ? It would be a very great advantage.
6337. If those institutions were established, do you think a number of adventurous young Australians
would be induced to come hero ? Australians do not take to a seafaring life the same as the people of
the old country.
6338. Well, say natives of New Zealand and Tasmania? I think some of them would take it on.
6339. Supposing the Government, in addition to establishing a biological station and a school for divers,
saw fit to grant a bonus on shell raised by white divers, do you think that would be an incentive to white
men to engage in the industry ? If they got a fair wage, I think you would got plenty of men. .
6340. Diving has had no injurious effect upon yourself ? No.
6341. If those young fellows kept away from the grog-shop and took care of themselves, and they were
physically sound, do you think diving would have an injurious effect on their constitutions? Not unless
they went down in deep water. If they went down in 15 or 16 fathoms Ido not think they would take
any harm. The Japanese go down to all depths, and, of course, they get killed.
6342. Your duties as Inspector of the Pearl-shell Fisheries bring you into touch with the industry? Only
in passing the shell, and going over the diving gear with a gauge and seeing if it is in good order.
6313. What do you think should be the minimum size of exportable shell ? The present limit of 5 inches.
It grows about !■£ inches in six months.
6344. Do you think that limit tends to encourage divers to pick up a lot of small shell, open it, and then
throw it overboard ? On the bottom both the water and the glass magnify the shell, and it is difficult to
tell the size within half an inch or an inch.
6345. How do they tell the size ? They measure it by spanning with the hand.
6346. There are several islets throughout Torres Strait where good cultivation areas might be taken up ?
Plenty of them.
6347. Assuming that cultivation experiments were crowned with success, do you think that families
could make permanent homes for themselves on those islets ? I do. Ido not see anything wrong with
the climate ; it is very healthy.
6348. They might combine pearl-shelling with turtle-shelling ? Yes; and perhaps bdche-de-mer fishing.
6349. How long do you think it would take a young fellow to become conversant with pump-diving?
At the present time men go out and take with them what they call a “ try” diver, and he stays three or
four months in that capacity.
6350. Do you think three or four months would make him a competent diver ? Yes; he would then
be able to get shell with anybody.
6351. At what age would you recommend that a man should begin diving ? He should be a man fully
set. You could not send a young boy down in the dress.
6352. What age should he be ? Twenty or twenty-one years.
6353. What about a lad of eighteen who is well set ? It he is well set he might engage in diving, but
it would not do to allow weaklings to go down in the dress.
6354. Do you think it necessary that he should undergo a medical examination? Ido not think so.
Nine men out of every ten are fairly sound.
6355. A man may have disease in some vital part, and there may be no outward indication of it ? It is
no more dangerous to go diving than sending a boy to sea and plastering him out on the royal yard,
not caring whether he falls off or not.
6356. Have you had any experience in the beche-de-mer industry ? None.
6357. By Mr. Douglas: In your capacity as Inspector of Pearl-shell Fisheries, have you noticed
whether the quantity of 5-inch shell coming in has decreased lately ? Yes, it has. There is considerably
less small shell coming in now than there used to be.
2358. Is there any particular reason for that ? We have been a bit strict with them—that is one reason ;
and Ido not think any of them pick up small shell intentionally. There are not more than two cases of
small shell in 100.
6359. By the Chairman : Were you here when the Clark syndicate went to the Aroe Islands ? Yes.
6360. Did you ever hear what induced them to abandon these grounds ? They thought they would get
rich quicker, I suppose. The shell had been exploited here.
6361. Do you think the shelling beds were depleted at that time ? Ido not think they were any more
depleted than they are now.
6362. Did you hear that they were compelled to leave on account of the difficulty in getting labour ? I
think there was a little trouble in that respect, as there has been with the Japanese now and again.
'i hey got rid of all the Manila men.
6363. You think they were induced to go away by the expectation of obtaining richer finds at the Aroe
Islands ? I think so, and also that they might get labour easier, and probably cheaper.
6364. Do you think there is remunerative employment in shelling for the number of boats here now ?
It is pretty hard to say,
6365. In the present condition of the beds? Ido not think any of them are making much of a success
of it now with the Japanese. The Japanese get all the pickings and the owner gets very little.
6366. Do you not think that is a deplorable state of affairs ? I do.

0307. To send away to their country something like £25,000 a year? The Japanese get all the pearls
now.
0308. There are 112 boats now engaged in shelling—Do you recommend that that number should be
increased, or that there should be no increase, having in view the profitable prosecution of the industry ?
If the Japanese could be got out of it, I think it would be a lot better. I do not think the Japanese are
any good to the place all.
0309. With good weather, is there sufficient shell to pay the present number of boats ? As far as I
know, they are getting as much shell now, taking it all round, as ever they got.
0370. Under those conditions, would it be right to increase the number of boats ? I do not think it
makes any difference. There is such a lot of ground to clear up, and the shell is moving about. It is a
drifting oyster all the time. Tou could not see 100 boats on the Old Ground when they are spread out.
0371. By Mr. Douglas : I want you to look at this return — [Showing Witness Table F in the Report of
the Government Resident for 1907] —Taking the amount of shell obtained for the period between 1890
and 1907, would you say there was as much shell obtained last year as ever there was ? Apparently
not.
0372. Compare the year 1904 with the three previous years ? Then you must take in all the other boats
that were working.
0373. The return shows 811 boats for 1903, as compared with 353 for 1904 ; yet the 353 boats only got
777 tons, as against 908 tons for the 311 boats ? Of course, that is where the beds are depleted. When
I came here, some of them got 70 tons out of Friday Island Passage, working on the reefs, without any
diving at all.
6374. They have not worked that passage'for many years ? No. Still, there were only ninety-two boats
in 1890, and they got 632 tons of shell, while 341 boats only got 1,060 tons in 1900.
6375. Do not those figures show that there-has been a decline for several years ? Yes; a decline and
fewer boats. But last year there were 135 boats, with a catch of 5G7 tons, showing an increase in the
catch, with an increased number of boats.
6376. The grounds have had a spell since 1905, when the Clark fleets went away ? That may bo so.
6377. That may account for the increased catch last year ? That might be so.
6378. Taking the figures for 1904 and 1905, do they not indicate that the grounds had been skinned to
some extent? Not necessarily, because for six or seven months in the south-east season you can hardly
work at all. This has been a bad year, because it was blowing all the time at the beginning of the year.
I can mention one boat that brought in 12 tons in one year. The beds could not be depleted where that
boat was.
6379. Wo are referring more particularly to the Old Ground, where the biggest quantity of shell was?
Of course the Old Ground has been worked more than any other. Perhaps a lot of boats working in one
place would make a difference. They would take more shell than a few boats.
6380. Do you think it advisable to close the grounds periodically? I think some parts are closed
naturally, because they cannot work them.
6381. By the Chairman-. Do you mean owing to weather conditions ? Owing to the depth of water.
6382. Do you consider those deep places supply spat to other areas? I am sure of it.
6383. By Mr. Douglas-. Tou are referring to a place like Endeavour Strait? Yes; that ought to be
closed to give it a chance. To close up one part at a time would be a good plan.
6384. You think that it does not get sufficient natural protection from the weather? No; they can
work there when they cannot work on the Old Ground.
6385. By the Chairman ■ Do you think that you and the Shipping Master can cope with all the work
in the busy times, having in view all the duties he has to perform ? If we had somebody—a boy —to look
after the office, we could manage.
6386. Do you mean while the Shipping Master is absent ? Yes.
6387. Do you not want a good assistant to represent Mr. Costin if he is out on the grounds for four or
five days ? That would be better still.
6388. Tou think it is necessary to have some assistance ? I think it wants somebody here all the
time.
James Febquson, Labourer, examined :
6389. By the Chairman -. What are you ? I am a labourer here.
6390. How long have you been a resident of Thursday Island ? Nearly fifteen years.
639L Have you been engaged for any time in the pearl-shelling industry ? I have never done any ,
divine, and I was never one of the crew in a lugger; but I was with Mr Saville Kent at one time looking
aftersome shell for him on the mainland. He took the shell to the Eastern Pacific for Lever Brothers.
6392. Did you accompany him ? No.
6393. How long is that since? I think it is four years.
6394. Have you heard anything of the success or otherwise of the experiment f I have it from Mr.
Saville Kent himself that the experiment was very successful.
6395 Did he tell you that the last time he was here ? Yes.
6396 What measure of success has attended his local experiment ? So far as I know, I think his
experiment was a success—that is, so far as regards taking up shell and planting it on a foreshore.
6397. By Mr. Douglas: You looked after the shell while it was waiting to be shipped to the South Seas ?
Yes • it was under my care all the time.
6398 How long were you there ? Nine weeks altogether
6399 Was the shell brought in from outside grounds ? Yes, and placed in shallow water.
6400* By the Chairman- What size were the shell that were brought in? They were all sizes. The
divers did not pick up any special size If they got smalUhell they picked it up. , *
6401 How was it taken to the Pacific ? It was put on board a schooner. They made a big tank of
canvas on the schooner, and the boats brought the shell to the schooner every night, and it was put into
this tank which was kept supplied with fresh sea water. .... .
G402 iVom your experience of those experiments, do you think that the work can be successfully carried
out? I have every reason to believe it would be successful.
6403 Bu Mr Douylas - In bringing in the shell and placing it in shallow water was any care exercised
as to which side the shell was laid on—Was it put on either the round or the flat side of the shell ? As

far as I remember, it was just placed in the cages indiscriminately. I saw it put into the cages. It was
put in wire-netting enclosures, moored in the water.
6101. By the Chairman : From what you know of the industry, do you think it could be carried on by
white divers ? I think it could.
6105. Do you think it could be assisted by the employment of a marine biologist ? I think so.
6406. And coupled with that, what do you think of establishing a training school to teach young men to
become expert divers ? I have not much to say about that, because, as far as I can recollect, in the early
days when I first came here the divers simply went outside for a trip or two as crew, and they gradually
learned diving on the Old Ground. That seems to be the best means of training them.
6407. But, supposing the present divers are gradually worked out, there would be such a number of
white divers wanted—Would not a training school under two or three old divers be beneficial? Yes;
provided the work was carried out under service conditions.
6408. Are you acquainted with the different islands and reefs in Torres Strait? Yes, I have been on
almost every one of them.
6409. In the event of the two experiments I have referred to being successful, do you think those
islands could be made the homes for families to settle down upon in connection with the industry ? I
think there are some islands very suitable for such homes.
6410. That would induce families to embark in the industry ? Yes. For my part I would not mind
settling down on many of the islands. There are some of them that would be fit residences for any
people.
6411. They might combine pearl-shelling and beche-de-mer fishing, and cocoanut-growing where the
opportunity offered ? Yes.
6412. By Mr. Douglas: If the successful cultivation of shell were demonstrated by a Government
expert, do you think that men would be prepared to select foreshores, and, with the knowledge obtained
at the biological station, enter upon the cultivation of shell? I should think so. I should feel inclined
to do it myself.
6413. By the Chairman : Have you had any experience in the beche-de-mer trade? No more than just
being a resident here.
(Mabuiag, or Jervis Island.)
TUESDAY, 23 JUNE, 1908.
Present:
Captain J. MACKAY {Chairman). | Mr. G. II. BENNETT.
Andrew Stbdtiiers Cairns, Teacher of Aboriginal School, Mabuiag, examined :
6414. By the Chairman : You are at present teacher of the Aboriginal School at Mabuiag ? Yes.
6415. How long have you been at Mabuiag? Nearly five years. I have been over five years in Torres
Strait.
6416. During that time, I suppose, you have become familiar with the natives engaged in pearl-shelling
and beche-de-mer fishing? Yes; 1 have had a fairly good experience, not only with the native-owned
boats but with those owned by Mr. Cowling.
6417. By Mr. Bennett-. What is the population of Mabuiag? At present there are 274 on the island,
and there is quite a number away. I might say with safety that 330 would be well within the limit.
6418. I suppose those who are away are adult males ? Mostly. I think there are two women at present
■on Thursday Island.
6419. What is the principal occupation followed by the people here ? Pearl-shelling; and, of course,
there is some agriculture.
6420. Do they cultivate their own land? They do, practically. They grow vegetables, such as yams,
taro, sweet potatoes, and also bananas.
6421. Do they own some boats ? The natives own two boats—the “Mabuiag” and the “TJripi,” and
at present they are working out three others that they have got from “The Papuan Industries, Limited.”
6422. What do they do with the boats? They get pearl-shell when they can, and, of course, they
help'them to get food. They catch a large amount of dugong and turtle. They get all kinds of marine
produce when they can get it.
6423. Are many of the natives engaged in pearling boats other than those belonging to the islands ?
Not at the present time. I do not think more than twelve are out.
6424. Have the two boats been successful during the last year or two ? They have not been altogether
successful. They have had many things to contend with —bad weather, for one. Then there are a
few amongst them who are absolutely lazy. If they had good weather, and the necessary authority was
given to see that they go to work occasionally, I think some of them would be all right. After two years
and two months they managed to clear their boats. The boats originally cost £170 each.
6425. Besides clearing their boats, were they able to keep their wives and families in food ? The first
eighteen months they did remarkably well; but since then it has been very depressing. They have not
kept at it as they ought to have done, and they have not actually brought in enough money to buy them
clothes. You saw them very nicely dressed this morning, but, as a rule, they are not nicely dressed.
They used to be really well and respectably dressed, especially when they had the “ Kiuam” —the boat
they had while you were here. At that time the island was in a good condition financially and in every
other way.
6426. Is it your opinion that the natives do better when working on wages ? I think it is well for them
to have a boat to keep the people on shore —a large proportion, too—in food during the absence of the
others ; but I think it would be a good thing to have some of them working bringing in wages.
6427. Have you had any experience of them working for wages ? Yes. Three years ago they were
pretty well all working for wages, except those who were on the “ Kiuam.”
6428. If their boats were worked under proper supervision and control, and they were kept at work, do
you think better results would be obtained ? Undoubtedly they would work better under supervision.
A. S. Cairns.
23 June, 1908.


6429. There are four councillors on the island ? Yes.
6430. Have they any control over the boats? They have really full control; but you can understand
that, when one councillor’s relatives refuse to work this week another councillor will say that his relatives:
will stop ashore next week; and so their authority is practically nil. If you go and rouse them up, and
say that you will report them, they do exercise a little more authority.
6432. When they do work they can get plenty of good shell around here ? Yes ; there is plenty of shell
to be got. As an instance of that, just last week in four days each boat brought in 210 shell—good shell,
too. At the same time there were nine diving boats working out in Napoleon Passage close to us, and
each diver got sixty or seventy shell a day just in the one passage.
6433. So that you think the shell has recovered around here ? I do.
6434. It has had a fairly long spell, has it not? Quite a long spell. It is over two years since Doyle
left here and since the pearling stations went away. Very little shell has been got since then, as the
boats have been working in the deep water at Darnley Island.
6435. Can you suggest any means by which pearl-fishing by the natives could be controlled with
advantage to themselves ? I have not given that matter much thought; but I am certain that if the
natives on each boat were limited to a certain number—sufficient to make a good crew —say fourteen to
each boat, seven being employed one week, and seven the next week —the remainder signing on articles
and working for wages, it would be a decided advantage to them.
6436. By the Chairman ; On what terms do the Papuan Industries, Limited, supply boats to the natives?
They have been very good to the natives ; they give them a boat at its original cost to the company at
Thursday Island, with 5 per cent, interest on the money expended. The company expect the natives to
take all the shell they raise to the heed station of the Papuan Industries, Limited.
6437. Do the natives purchase their stores from the company ? Yes.
6138. By Mr. Bennett: Do the company pay the natives for the shell in kind or in cash? Always in
cash. From what I have seen I think that as a rule the natives give a fair price for their purchases.
In every case but one that I have known the price has been higher than the Thursday Island price—not
much, but still a little higher.
6439. When the natives were on wages, did they always spend their wages for the benefit of their
wives and families ? Unfortunately, no, because of the slop-chest system. They bought a sort of calico,
prints, flour, and tobacco now and again ; but they very seldom brought any money home. Very often,
especially in the case of one pearling-station that used to be here, the boys were worked and worked
until they were very much in debt, so that at the end of their time the employer would come along
and say, “ You owe me so much ; you must sign on again for another twelve months.” He would
give them a little money in advance, so that at the end of their time there would be very little coming to
them.
6440. Is it your opinion that if the natives were working for themselves under proper supervision they
would do better on the whole ? Yes ; I feel sure they would do better under proper supervision.
6441. Are they advancing in business knowledge? Yes; they are advancing a little; but they do not
realise that they are better off working for themselves. They do not take advantage of the opportunities
afforded them.
6442. In fact, they think when they are working for themselves they are not allowed to get the things
they want; whereas when working under the slop-chest system they can get what they want ? Yes;
they can get what they want under the slop-chest system; but they understand now that they cannot
spend beyond a certain amount.
6443. They do not like that ? What they do not like is this: They go into Thursday Island with their
catch of shell ; they might have £2O coming to them. When JMr. O’Brien was here he paid half the
money to them and they spent it themselves ; but since Mr. Costin came here he has altered that, and he
has the handling of the whole of the money —he pays them what sums he thinks proper. They resent
that more than anything, as they think they should have the handling of the money. But lam of opinion
that that system is a good one—it is a check. Of course, it may be carried too far; but I think that
when the natives realise that the idea of the Department is to establish a sort of bank account for them
they will approve of it more than they do at the present time At present, they do not appreciate the
arrangement.
6444 The time when they will appreciate it is when they want a special draw? Yes ; but that time is
not yet. When it comes lam sure they will appreciate the system which has been adopted.
6445. What is your opinion of the slop-chcst system as it affects the natives ? Ido not think it is a
good one for the native, as he forgets all about his obligation to pay. If you allow him to draw as much
money as he wants, ho will draw until you have to stop him, and he will make no attempt to pay up.
6446. Although he recognises that he is in debt ? He knows he is in debt —he is fully aware of that
fact ; but ho knows you cannot summon him for the money, and believes he is quite safe. In the case of
the Saibai men it is different —they can be worked.
6447. What is your opinion as to the capabilities of Mabuiag Island for white settlement ? In connec-
tion with pearl-shelling ? •
6448. Yes ? I think it is a very good place —one of the best in the Strait.
6449. Is there plenty of room ? Yia ; if the 5-acre system which was in force before is adopted— that is,
allowing 5 acres for a station.
6450. Then you think the climate is suitable for white people ? It is a very good climate on the whole.
6451. Is there plenty of water obtainable? Yes; good water can be obtained by sinking. We have
four good wells at the back here. t .
6452. There is a strong South Sea element in the population ot the island i Not now. The total South
Sea population is seven adults and ten children. We used to have a larger number.
6453. Does the rent of the 5 acres go to the island funds ? It used to, but latterly it has gone to the
Aboriginal Fund. , , „ „ , ,
6454. How many children have you attending the school ? Seventy-four.
6455. Are they capable of receiving and assimilating instruction ? Yes. At the mechanical work they
are very good indeed. Of course, when it comes to intellectual work, such as grammar, they are all at
sea I have boys here who, if they are asked to calculate their share of the proceeds from a catch
of 15 cwt. 2 qr. 7 lb. of shell at £95 a ton, can tell you exactly.

(Badu, or Mulgrave Island.)
TUESDAY, 23 JUNE, 1908.
Peesent:
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) ) Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Eeedeeick William Walker, Managing Director of The Papuan Industries, Limited, examined :
6156. Eit the Chairman : What are you ? Managing director of the Papuan Industries Limited.
6157. What is the population of Badu? A little over 200.
6158. Does it comprise both aboriginals and South Sea natives? There are a few South Sea Islanders
and a few Malays, but they are mostly aboriginals.
6159. By Mr. Bennett-. What is the proportion of adult males? I cannot tell you from memory.
6160. By the Chairman-. How are they employed ? Clearing, planting, doing cargo work, and helping
us with the buildings. I think they have distinctly improved in industry since we started. We have
noticed a distinct improvement as the result of the year’s steady work.
6161. Are any of them engaged in the pearl-shell industry ? The village has two boats which they
obtained after Mr. O’Brien’s time.
6162. Are those included in the boats obtained on the time-payment system ? Yes. They were
obtained through the office of the Protector of Aboriginals, and are now nearly clear. The natives who
own these boats are engaged in swimming diving.
6463. By Mr. Bennett-. What are they engaged in mostly? They go out in the direction of Mabuiag,
and also round Badu for pearl-shell. They have found some very good patches in the channel between
Mua and Badu. It may interest you to learn that there is a place in this locality where a rich find was
obtained some years ago, when Bell’s fleet had a station here. Only a month ago the natives went to
the same place and found that it was replenished. They got quite a lot of good clean shell there.
6464. Ho’w long ago was the rich find obtained there? Pive or six years ago. Air. May will, no doubt,
remember the place, as they got a lot of shell there.
6465. What size was the shell ? It was very fine shell. I should think it was 7or 8 inches, and it was
very clean —not wormy at all.
6166. By the Chairman : In the event of the pearl-shell industry being worked by white divers, do you
think there is any chance of the Strait Islands natives becoming boats’ crews ? I think the natives prefer
to engage in swimming diving on their own account. They appreciate their own boats immensely, because
with them they can earn money near their homes without leaving their wives and families, and at the
same time they can get dugong and turtle, which add considerably to the food supply of the islands. If
they had not got boats they would practically have no chance of getting dugong and turtle.
6167. By Mr. Bennett: Their families feel their going away the worst? Yes; the wives of the natives,
and the old men. If the young men go away in diving boats, it will be all right for them in a sense.
Still it is not the best thing for them, and the wives and families left behind will feel the change very
much. Our company has come here with a desire to help the natives to develop industries on their own
account, with the idea of securing for them the best possible conditions for encouraging domestic life.
If the natives have to go away to work at sea for twelve months at a time, that will mean sacrificing the
islands for the industry. With the New Guinea natives it is different. You can get New Guineans
from far away districts, and, generally speaking, they go back improved. They learn habits of industry,
and T do not think they are demoralised to any very great extent, though there has been a certain
amount of demoralisation among them. The general feeling in New Guinea is that when those men go
away, they do not go back conspicuously the worse for their contact with pcarl-shellers, but that in many
respects they arc improved, and become a helpful influence among the natives when they return. The
natives of Now Guinea are also suliiciently numerous to allow of a different set of men being obtained to
take the places of those who return.
6468. By the Chairman -. In the event of the Government calling in the aid of a marine biologist to
assist those engaged in the pearl-shell industry, would the company you represent be inclined to go in
for the cultivation of the pearl oyster as an industry ? Personally, I think they would, but I could not
commit the company to anything of that kind without consulting the board of directors.
6469. But you think they would be inclined to go in for it ? Yes ; provided the conditions were such
that there was a prospect of the work proving remunerative.
6170. Do you think this (Badu) locality is suited for that purpose? Yes; Mua Passage is one of the
best places in the Strait for such a purpose.
6171. By Mr. Bennett: To about how many men do the two boats owned by the natives afford regular
employment ? The crews vary very much, but from ten to fifteen go out in the boats.
6172. Do the boats work regularly ? Yea ; and they have been doing better lately than they did some
time back.
6173. They have been getting fair results lately ? Yes ; the find in the passage that 1 have referred to
has helped them considerably. t
617-1 By the Chairman : Is there any suggestion you would like to offer to the Commission ? I desire
to say that I hope that in any action which may be taken as a result of the recommendations of the
Commission the interests of the natives will be conserved and protected, so that they will not be debarred
from enjoying in their own simple way the results of their own labour.
6173. Of course —When we say it is desirable that the pearl-shell industry should be carried on by white
labour we mean white divers and white tenders, with New Guinea or Torres Strait islanders as crews ;
and you may rest assured, I think, that those natives who are dependent on the Government for
protection will have employment? I hope they will have not merely employment; if they are capable of
working these swimming-diving boats successfully, I hope the Government will encourage them in that
vvork. At present these boats arc considered a failure, but I feel strongly that any want of success that
may have attended their efforts is duo to the fact that the natives have been organised on a wrong basis.
My experience of the natives is that if you organise them on a communistic basis the system will not
work successfully; sooner or later there will be discontent and dissatisfaction. I believe that if
you organise these boats on an individualistic basis, so that each man can secure the result* of
F.W. Walker.
23 June, 1908.


hia own labour, and get prompt payment for it, the natives will work fairly well. Man} 7 young
men have told me that when they work in these boats they never get any monev, because
in many instances it is handed over to the old men, and they share according to their ideas, and :
not in accordance with the young men’s ideas; and, as it is the young men who do the work, they
are dissatisfied. Then the whole thing breaks down, and they are accused of being lazy and not fit to
have boats. I believe if it could bo organised on the basis of securing to each man his own catch and
keeping it separ ate, it would be better. The debt on the boat is equally assigned to each individual. If
the debt on a boat is £GO and there are ten men, then £0 is owing by each man. To work off the £O, a
card might be given to each man as the equivalent of a share certificate. If a man came in with £2
worth of shell as the result of his own efforts, that would be kept separate from the catches of the others, and
the man would be told that there was £2 for him. He would pay for hia tucker for that trip, and that would
be deducted first of all. From the remainder ss. or IDs would be taken to go towards the reduction of his
debt, and the balance he would take for his own benefit. Yery often now at the end of a trip they get nothing.
Their takings are impounded for the debt, and very often good men are scolded because the debt is not
being reduced quickly. If there were some supervision, you would be able to find out who were the lazy
men who were not contributing towards the extinction of the debt. After being cautioned and given a
chance for a certain time, they could be put out of the company, and their places taken by new men. To
do that would require almost a separate officer.
6476. The evidence we have been given is that they work strenuously until the boats are paid for, and
then they become lax ? Tes. I believe that is because the first enthusiasm carries them along for a few
months.
G 177. Until they become possessed of the boats ? Yes, and until the young men find they are getting
nothing out of it. A skilful swimmer says, “ Why should I get thirty or forty shell a trip while another
man who gets two shell a day gels the same as I do ?’■’ White men would not work Under those
conditions. There is no justice in it, and there is no inducement for good men to work. It is this that
causes the men to lose interest, since there is no recognition of merit under the present system.
6478. But as they become more skilful and more industrious, and labour becomes m ire plentiful, it may
be possible for two or three men to get a boat of their own? That is a serious undertaking for two or
three men. You might hold out that hope to them ; but when they find their merits are not recognised,
they lose heart, as we should do under the same conditions. I would like to say that a certain proportion
have been successful. The “ Saibai,” “ Warriha,” and “ Three Sisters” bo its are clear, and one Mabuiag
boat only owes £l2, and the other a little over £2O. That shows that the system has not been a failure by
any means ; and I believe where they have failed it has been largely due to the fact that they are
organised on a communistic instead of an individualistic basis.
6479. By Mr. Bennett: It is only six years since the scheme was first st irted, so that it is too soon to
pronounce it a failure? Exactly; ad there are bound to be difficulties at the beginning of anew
departure of that kind. I certainlv consider the percentage of success is by no means discouraging in
view of the difficulties that have had to be encountered.
G4BO. Eve.i if it had been a financial failure, would you consider the experiment was worth a trial ? I
do not think there is any promise of permanency in it if it cannot be made to pay its way ; but lam
satisfied it can be made to pay its way.
G4Bl. Even assuming that the experiment should prove a financial failure, do you think it is worth
persevering with as a principle? Yes, for the sake of the percentage of success that has been secured.
6182. Has the experiment had any effect in the way of advancing the natives in business knowledge ?
Undoubtedly it has. It quickens their wits, and it compels them to calculate. We have had some
interesting cases where the schoolboys have been made to adjust the returns. They have got to calculate—
So much shell at so much a ton, how much should they receive ? It interests them, and show's them that
know'ledge can be applied to business.
6483. Ho you think the boys of the rising generation will be materially advanced in capability ?
Unquestionably; Ido not think that can be doubled. There is everything in the policy that is being
pursued which is calculated to make men of them aud inspire them to the best efforts. lam satisfied
that the natives only want careful and wise handling. You want to understand the native and handle
him sympathetically 7 . Ido not mean to coddle him. Treat him firmly and kindly, and he will respond
to such treatment.
GlB4. I suppose, you find the natives keenly appreciative of absolute truth? And honesty and fair
dealing. If you win their confidence, they will trust you. Once win their confidence, and then, if they
cannot altogether follow you, or prove that you arc doing right, they will trust you, being satisfied that
you have their welfare at heart.
0485. On what terms do the natives employed by your company work? We give them 2s. a day, and
they work five days in the week, from G a.m. till 5 p.m., with half an hour for breakfast and an hour for
dinner. They find their own food Wo should like to give them a bigger wage if we could, but they
are not worked hard -it is comparatively easy work.
6486. I suppose you recognise the fact that the natives cannot be driven ? Their w 7 ork is not laborious
—cutting down trees, planting, &c.
6487. Btf the Chairman-. They get better food than they do when they are beclie-de-mer fishing? They
have to find themselv s, and their native food does not cost much.
6188. By Mr. Bennett: And they have one day in the w 7 eek in which they can work in their own
gardens ? Yes. We do not work on a Saturday, and that gives them time to work in their own gardens,
but the women do most of that work.
6489. If the men were not working at something ebe, they would not be working in their gardens ? No;
it is a recognised custom that the women look after the gardens. With boats, the natives have great
possibilities before them, and if the experiment is abandoned before it has really been fairly tried, I think
it will have a very bad effect upon the natives, and that the burden on the Government in regard to
them will increase in years to come. I believe that if the system of providing them with boats is
encouraged and the natives are properly handled, the system will become a success, aud will become the
basis of Social improvement and progress amon g these people.
6490. You were acquainted with the natives of the Straits in touner years? lea. I was in charge of
this district under the London Missionary Society.

. 6491. Did you know of any cases in which the Government had to find relief for these people ? Many.
6492. Have you known of any cases in which the Government have had to find relief since this boat
.system started? No; but Mrs. Smallwood, the Government teacher at Darnley, and Captain Hamon
have informed me that if our company had not been at work during the last north-west season there
would certainly have been cases there, as the natives would have been in a starving condition. An
experiment of this sort should be based on a system which will bring to light, and hold up to reproof and
punishment, worthless men, and reward those who are worthy. I maintain that no intelligence or
thoughtfulness has been shown in the way this thing has been organised.
6493. By the Chairman : The same remark applies to men of our own colo.ur —you do not punish the
drone, you simply let him alone ; hundreds of people are fed by the Government in Brisbane, though I
am positive they are able to work if they like ? If you have a system by which every man’s record is
kept separate, you will give greater encouragement to the natives than you will by a communistic
system. I may mention in connection with the shelling boats that our company were invited by the
Government to find one-half the money for them, and they did so ; but Ido not think our directors
understood when they did that, that they were to be forbidden to do business with the natives working
those boats.
6494. Supposing the natives came in to Badu and offered you shell for sale, could you not buy it ?
No; we are forbidden to do business with them. They must go to Thursday Island. The chief point in
connection with our company has been to beep the natives from Thursday Island, but the Government
have blocked us in our purpose by compelling the natives to go to Thursday Island to sell their shell and
get their supplies. We have really found more than half the money lately. There was a little
shortage, and we made it up. One particular instance of that was the “Peruna,” which was lying
alongside our boat when I was in Thursday.lsland the last time. For that boat we found every penny,
but the money passed through the office of the Protector of Aboriginals, and we have not been allowed
to do business with the boat. The company can give every guarantee of fair dealing and disinterested
motives. Ido not like to make professions of philanthropy without justification; but any fair-minded
man, who will look at our memorandum of agreement and articles of association, must admit that the men
who are interested in the company are not covering up adesire to do business with the cloak of philanthropy.
It is a genuine effort to assist the natives, and my hope was that we should be encouraged by every
individual. The heads of departments, both Commonwealth and State, told us that our presence would be
welcomed by their Governments as a co-operating adjunct, which could be relied upon to do justice to the
natives and to assist them in many practical ways ; but, owing to the views that have been taken locally,
we have been absolutely blocked, and our company has been given to understand that it is a case of
“hands off.” AVe have nothing to conceal. AVe welcome supervision—so much so that we have had
Mr. Costiu to act as auditor for our company. In fact, we are better pleased for the Government to
have the fullest possible knowledge of what we are doing. If we treated the natives here badly they
would very soon clear out. AVe could not hold them. They are very smart and keen in matters of self-
interest ; they are very anxious to come to us, and it is a mystery to them why the Government treat us
as they do locally. It would certainly be much better if the natives were allowed to do business with us,
as there have been several instances where the natives, in connection with their boals, have got their
money in Thursday Island and have spent it all there.*
* The following letter was subsequently received from Mr. Walker :
Thursday Island, 26th June, 1908,
Torres Strait, Queensland.
Sir, —Be licenses for natives working boats.
I am sorry to say that when giving my evidence before the Commission I omitted to refer to the above
subject.
I would respectfully submit, for the consideration of the Commission, that the natives working boats in
connection with the shelling and beche-de-mer industries should be exempt both from licenses and articles so long
as they do not work south of Cape York and do not employ mainlanders in their boats.
The Commission of 1897 made this recommendation without the conditions I have suggested, and it appears
to me to be a concession to the natives which might well be granted, as it would be calculated to stimulate them
to make greater efforts to provide for themselves and their families, and the revenue of the State would not be
appreciably affected by granting them this exemption.
I would include in my suggestion all South Sea men domiciled on the islands, and all their half-caste
children. These South Sea men and their children have become thoroughly identified in every way with the
social life of the nativi?s, and, on the whole, with decidedly beneficial results.
If a native rents a boat or works it on the thirds’ system —one-third of the gross proceeds going to the owner
of the boat by way of rent, he taking two-thirds and paying all working expenses—he should, I think, be entitled to
the same concessions as the natives who own boats or are working them out, as the cost of the licenses and
articles would fall on his shoulders, and he should scarcely be penalised if he prefers, as some natives do, to start
by renting a small boat and saving money to buy later a larger and more suitable vessel.
If all boats cannot be made exempt, boats under 2 or 3 tons working on the home reefs in the various
islands might, at any rate, be made exempt both from licenses and articles ; and from 3 tons to 10, a 10s. license for
the boat and a 10s. license for the man in charge, with exemption from articles, would be no great hardship.
Trusting this matter will receive favourable consideration,
I am, &c.,
F. AV. WALKER,
Managing Director of The Papuan Industries, Limited.
The Chairman, Royal Commission on Pearl Shelling, Thursday Island.


(Maer Island—Murray Islands.)
SATURDAY, 27 JUNE, 1008.
Present:
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Mr. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
John Stewart Bruce, Schoolmaster, Murray Islands, examined:
6495. By the Chairman-. "What are you ? Schoolmaster, Murray Islands.
6496. How long have you been here ? Seventeen years in connection with school work.
6497. Were you here before that ? Yes ; I first came here in 1881.
6498. That is, you have been on the island twenty-seven years? No; I have not been on the island
twenty-seven years. I was here from 1881 to the end of 1883. Then I went South, and after that I
came back here.
6499. How many years have you been on the island altogether ? About twenty years.
6500. "What is the population of Murray Islands? At the last census which I took, three years
ago, it was 450. It is much about the same now, allowing for births and deaths.
6501. Are the natives engaged in pearl-shelling or beche-de-mer fishing? They are engaged in beche-de-
mer fishing. There are a few who go out as crews in pearl-shelling boats, but they are very few. They
prefer the beche-de-mer fishing.
6502. How many boats belonging to the natives are employed in beche-de-mer fishing ? Two ; but one
of them is not quite cleared at the present time.
6503. Did they become possessed of those boats on the time-purchase system ? Yes. Both boats will
be clear next month.
6504. Have the natives been fairly successful in the fishing ? They were in the beginning. Mr. Bennett,
the late Hon. John Douglas, and myself arranged to supply them with boats, and they worked very well
then, and were successful.
6505. You say they have worked one boat out ? They have worked several boats out.
6506. It has been stated in evidence before this Commission that the natives are willing to work until the
boats are paid for, but that once that is done they become careless and lazy ? That is a fact.
There is no incentive for them to work in the same way when they have paid for the boats.
6507. Then their incentive is to get possession of the boat ? That is all; they want to get possession of the
boat just as an ornament. They like to see the boat at anchor in front of the village, and to be able to
say, “ That is our boat,” just as Papuans like to have a canoe on the beach of which they can say, “ That
is our canoe.”
6508. Do you think they can be encouraged to continue in the fishery ? I do not think so, without com-
pulsion. I have tried to induce them to continue at the work, but have not succeeded. I have hurried
them up, and tried to get them to work, but without much success. During the first twelve months they
did work well, and cleared the boats. At that time I had the men working according to a time table,
so many men going out to work at each tide ; but after they got their boats clear they began to think that
they were their own masters.
6509. Do you think it would be to the advantage of the natives if a little compulsion were used to induce
them to continue fishing ? Ido not think so. I think it is better that they should not own any boats.
They are far better working for wages. I have found that out by experience.
6510. Do you include working for pearl-shellers ? For anyone—for men engaged in either beche-de-mer
fishing or pearl-shelling.
6511. You consider it is more advantageous to the natives to hire themselves out as boats’ crews than to
work boats of their own ? Yes ; they earn far more money working for wages.
6512. By Mr. Bennett : Do the natives and their families get the full benefit of the money they earn if
they go out to work for other persons ? I had a letter from Mr. Costin last mail stating that he had
opened a banking account for each man sent out, and that so much of the money earned by a man is paid
into that account. On that money he can draw for the purchase of goods at the Papuan Industries,
Limited, store at Damley Island, and he can continue drawing in that way until the whole of the money
is exDGnded
6513. By the Chairman: Whose store is that at Darnley ? The Eev. Mr. Walker’s place. When a
man works for three or four months and earns a sum of money by his labour, I do not see how you can
help him in that way. Under the former system, when a man was paid off he bought all he wanted at
Thursday Island, and brought the things with him.
6514. By Mr. Douglas-. Do they understand the banking accounts? No; they do not understand
them properly. The arrangement is a new one, and you cannot expect them to understand it.
6515 V By the Chairman : Are you in favour of the system of keeping one-third of their money to put
into the bank? I can quite understand that the Protector of Aboriginals is doing that to prevent them
getting liquor'at Thursday Island. But if the native was kept from that, and was allowed to spend his
money’at Thursday Island on what he wanted for his family in the shape of calico and food, I think that
would be a better arrangement. . , , , .... ~ , „ ,
6516 r | he law protects the native against drunkenness, and we have been told in evidence by the Sub-
Insnector of Police at Thursday Island that there is very little drinking among the natives there—
Having that in view do you think it is better that the native should be paid in cash and allowed to buy
what he likes 9 a’ part of the money earned by a native might be placed in the bank to his credit, but
not the whole of it. Ido not think'it is a good thing to pay the money he has earned into a bank and
6517 h Tf was allowed to dispose of his money as he wished, would it not be more of an incentive
of Barrier Eeef in the neighbourhood of this island ? The
natives very seldom work on the reefs to the eastward of the island. Ihey prefer to work down to the
westward.

• 6519. In the Cumberland Channel ? Yes, and down to the westward.
\ 6520. By Mr. Bennett ■ They also go to the Barrier Beef, do they not? Very seldom.
5.6521. By Mr. Douglas- Would the natives be willing to work on the pearl-shelling boats for wages ?
They always have been ; but the wages that are given in the pearl-shelling boats are from £2 ss. to £2
10s. per month, and now the Japanese are giving them £2 ss. a month to work in the beche-de-mer
industry.
6522. By the Chairman ; And finding them in food ? They find them in everything. That is greatly to
the advantage of the beche-de-mer industry.
6523. They prefer working in the beche-de-mer fishery ? Yes, always. They have a better time at it
than working at the pump all day in the pearl-shelling boats.
6524. Do the Japanese treat them well ? I have had very few complaints against them. The Japanese
used to get crews here, but that was stopped two years ago, when Mr. O’Brien stopped them coming
here for water. None of them can now expect to recruit boys.
6525. They still recruit here ? Yes ; Mr. Oostin has given them permits.
6526. Do the natives go willing ly ? Yes. £2 ss. a month is big money for them. The money they can
make working on the home reefs around the island is about £1 ss. a month.
6527. By Me. Bennett: Do they make £1 ss. a month working for themselves ? I suppose the Protector
of Aboriginals looks after what they get.
6528. By Mr. Douglas-. Do they get paid that money in full ? I cannot say anything about that.
When Mr. Bennett was Protector, when boys were shipped from here, the date of shipment was sent in
to Thursday Island. When they were shipped before that, men used to take them away and work them for
a month or two and then take them into Thursday Island to ship them. That was put a stop to, but even
then there were one or two who upset the arrangement. This is the first year the Japanese have got
permits to take boys from M urray Island. They ship them to Cooktown. That means pretty well a
month between here and Cooktown, and they work them all the way down.
652.0. By the Chairman-. But do they not date the articles from the time they leave here? I send a
memorandum to the Protector of Aboriginals at Cooktown.
6530. By Mr. Bennett: By post ? No, with the boats going down. I have no opportunity of sending
hy post.
6531. But the Japanese may not deliver your memoranda? That is so ; but that is the only means I
have of sending word.
6532. When the natives got the first boats about five years ago, did not the system work satisfactorily ?
It worked very well then.
6533. Did not the natives and their families benefit more than they did when they worked for wages ? I
cannot say that they did. In fact, taking it on the whole, they did not. ' Still it was a great advantage
to the majority of the old people.
6534. Did the community as a whole benefit more than under the wages system ? No, just the same.
The young men had to do the work, and the elders had to supply the food. If there were no young men
to go as crews in the boats, the old men could not do the work. At the beginning, when it came to
closing the accounts, there were big amounts to divide. On the whole, I think that the old people had a
far better return than they have under the system of working their own boats.
6535. Is beche-de-mer as plentiful now as it was five years ago ? The Japanese have pretty well cleaned
out the reefs adjacent to the island. They have to go further afield for fish now. They have to go away
down to the Three Sisters and close to the mainland. At least, they prefer to go there.
6536. By the Chairman-. Do they cure the beche-de-mer aboard the boats? It is all cured on the boats now.
6537. By Mr Bennett -. Have you any idea how long it takes the reefs to recover after they have been
fished out ? When I first came here in 1881 they worked on the reefs quite close to the home reef, and
they used to come in with their boats loaded with fish. Formerly the men went on to the reefs with their
bags, and picked up the fish on the top of the reef. There was no swimming diving then. Now they
tell mo every time they come in that there are just a few fish there, and that it is far better to dive for
them on the edge of thereof. It is twenty-seven years since they worked those reefs, and they have not
recovered in all that time. Captain Wilkie, who was afterwards Harbour Master, was out here in 1882
in a vessel of his own, working the roofs all round the island ; and he has told me since that in the old
days the boats used to come in loaded to the gunwale, and he was struck by the remarkable scarcity of
fish when he came back as Shipping Master.
6538. Then your experience here teaches you that once a reef has been thoroughly exploited it takes a
very long time to recuperate, if it ever does recuperate ? I do not see how reefs recuperate. I
know that black fish are always found on the top of the reefs, but if a reef is cleaned of teat fish and
red fish it never seems to recuperate.
6539. By Mr. Douglas-. Have they got much pearl-shell about the reefs around Murray Islands ? No,
only an occasional shell. My brother Bob had two boats prospecting around here about eighteen years
ago, but he never got anything.
6540. By the Chairman -. And yet Darnley is so close ? Yes. Between Calico Reef and Murray
Islands there is no shell—the bottom is not suitable for the pearl-oyster.
6541. What is the depth of the water? The depth along the reefs about Murray Islands is from 18 to
19 fathoms.
6542. By Mr. Bennett • Were the persons you speak of prospecting with pump diving-boats ? Yes. To
the westward they got an occasional pearl-shell, but nothing worth speaking of.
6543. Is the population of Murray Island increasing or decreasing? It is increasing. Since I first took
the census about sixteen years ago, there has been a natural increase of 53.
6544. Apart from fishing for beche-de-mer, the natives of these islands have considerable resources on
land ? Yes. They do not require to fish, as their island affords sufficient natural resources to keep them
in food. In initiating their young men into manhood, they teach them that they are not to interfere in
sea-work, but that they must look after the land. They regard it as a lazy man’s work to fish.
6545. They are essentially an agricultural people ? Yes. They look down on the men to the west; they
ridicule them and call them fish-eaters.
6546. By the Chairman : Do not the women do all the work on the plantations ? Pretty well all the
work. They do the heaviest work and the men the ornamental work, such as wrapping up bananas pnd
decorating the fences when the gardens have been finished.


J- Brucc-
-27 June, 1908.
6547. By Mr. Bennett : Murray Island could support a much larger population than you have at present
on the island ? Yes, double the present number. There is only about one-thix - d of the island under ,
cultivation. ' !
6548. By the Chairman : If cultivated, the island should support a population of at least 1,000 ? Tes,
quite that number.
6549. By Mr. Bennett: The Murray Islanders do not marry outside themselves? You can hardly say
that there is a pure Murray Islander on the island, because in former days when the beche-de-mer fishers
came here there was a mixing with South Sea Island men and others.
6550. Has there been a considerable admixture of races ? Yea. They have their own laws for marrying
and inter-marrying among themselves, and they are very strict on that point; but occasionally there is a
slip, because there is so much adopting of children going on among the islanders. I have advised them
to stop this, and they see now that it ought to be stopped. There are bound to be slips in marriages
when that takes place, and when a slip does take place they complain that the parties are too closely
related. Owing to the mixture with other races in the past, you cannot really say that there is a true
Murray Islander in the place.
6551. Except among the older people? You can see the traits of different races even among the older
people—even in the old Mamoose.
6552. By t%e Chairman : Would it not be to their advantage to have now blood among them? They
have had new blood. They have inter-married with the Darnley Island natives and the natives to the
westward. Between those different islanders there has always been an exchange of women for wives.
6553. By Mr. Douglas : Were not South Sea Islanders shifted from Murray Island to Darnley Island ?
Yes; they were all shifted at one time. The missionary authorities got them shifted ; they were running
the natives and had complete control over them at that time.
6554. By the Chairman : Would not the introduction of a dozen Eotumah men among them help to
educate them in habits of industry ? Since I have known the islanders there have been Eotumah men
and Earatonga men among them, but it is astonishing how quickly those men drop into the habits of the
natives. The Eotumah men who are here now are mixed up in the food trouble that is on. Some of the
men were at my place the night before last, and I asked them how they came to be associated with this
food business, and they said they did not want to have anything to do with it, but that their wives had
drawn them into it.

Captain J. MACK AY {Chairman) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Edward James Hamon, Master Mariner, examined:
6555. By the Chairman : What are you ? I am a master mariner.
6556. You reside at Darnley Island ? Yes. I have been here for fourteen years and three months.
6557. By Mr. Douglas : Eor part of that time you were Inspector of Pearl-Shell Fisheries ? Yes, for
two years.
6558. What were your duties? Going round inspecting the licenses and seeing that the boats were not
working on the prohibited ground.
6559. Did you have any difficulty in keeping them off? Yes, a great deal of difficulty.
6560. Did you ever manage to catch any of them ? I caught two, one of them red-handed as he came up
from the bottom—but both of them got off.
6561. By Mr. Bennett: You had no boat to patrol the ground ? No.
6562. That was one reason why you failed to keep them off the ground ? Yes.
6563. Do you think there is as much pearl-shell being got here now as there was from five to seven
years ago ? No.
6564. About how many boats were working here at that time ? Sometimes I counted twenty-two or
twenty-three boats.
6565. What is the largest number working here now ? I could not say. I have not counted more than
fifteen at the very most, but I take very little notice now. When I was Inspector I used to watch every
boat, but now I could not tell you how many there are.
6566. By the Chairman : Do you know anything about the beche-de-mer industry ? Very little.
6567. Are there any boats from here engaged in that industry ? Yes.
6568. How many ? I do not know.
6569. Some of the men living here fish for beche-de-mer ? Yes.
6570. Do they get plenty ? Not plenty, but they get some. If they liked to work it properly, they could
get plenty, but they are too lazy.
6571. By Mr. Bennett : What is the population of the island? I cannot tell you exactly; but four
years ago when I took the census it was 212 ; and I do not suppose there are more than 220 or 230 now.
6572. What proportion of them are South Sea Islanders ? There were twenty-seven or thirty-seven
adult males "at that time, and fifty or fifty-five women, and the children of both sexes amounted to
over 100. . . T i 11 . • , ,
6573. By the Chairman : Are they increasing or decreasing ? 1 should think they are decreasing, if
Mr. Bennett : Do you allude to Darnley Island natives or South Sea Islanders ? To both.
This year there has been a small increase, but last year there was very little.
6575. By Mr. Douglas-. Do the purap'diving boats come here regularly? Those manned by Japanese
057 1 6 6 the natives of the island own areas of ground where their houses are ? Yes. The Pitta
pay £5 a year rent to the Government for the land where they live.
E. J. Haiqon,
28 June, 1008.


Douglas Pitt, Pearl Sheller and Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined:
6577. By the Chairman : What are you ? A sailor—a native of Kingston, Jamaica.
v 6578. AVhat are you engaged in at present ? In pearl-shelling and beche-de-mer fishing.
1.6579. How long have you been engaged in those industries? I have been here since 1871.
6580. By Mr. Bennett-. Where did you come from to this island ? New Caledonia.
6581. Are you married? Yes.
6582. By Mr. Douglas : What family have you ? Pour sons and four daughters.
6583. Have they been brought up here ? Yes—born and bred here.
6584. Have you been the owner of vessels licensed to fish for beche-de-mer ? Yes, for years. Ever
since licenses have been issued in Torres Strait I have had a license.
6585. Were you fishing for beche-de-mer in the early days in Torres Strait ? Yes.
6586. How many boat licenses have you held in one year ? Three.
6587. How many boats have you licensed now ? One.
6588. How many had you licensed last year? Two.
6589. Do you wish to renew your license for one boat next year ? Yes; and I wish to get a license for
a new boat in place of the “ Jamaica,” which was lost.
6590. By Mr. Bennett : Which was lost last year? This year.
6591. Before she was licensed ? No. She was licensed; she was wrecked on Cocoanut Island.
6592. Then you have held two licenses this year ? No ; she was licensed in Doyle’s name when she was
wrecked.
6593. By Mr. Douglas : Were you engaged in beche-de-mer fishing when you came here in 1871 ? Yes.
6594. For how many years were you engaged in that industry ? A good many years. Sometimes we were
engaged in pearl-shelling.
6595. Swimming diving ? Yes.
6596. Have you been out on the Barrier Eeef ? Yes.
6597. Have you noticed whether the Barrier Eeef is getting skinned of fish ? The fish are getting
pretty scarce there.
6598. Have you noticed if the fish increase at any times ? . Yes. On some reefs you will get plenty of
fish after the north-west monsoon, but not on the high reefs. The fish come up from the deep water
and go on the low reefs.
6599. By Mr. Bennett: Supposing a high reef was skinned of fish, how long do you think it would be
before the fish would come back again ? About four years.
6600. But they would not come back at all on the high reefs? Yes, they would come back on the very
high reefs in about four years; but on the low reefs the fish come up regularly from the lagoons after the
north-west season. There is a lot of fish on the Seven Reefs now; I was there the week before last.
6601. How far south have you fished for beche-de-mer ? As far as the Pitzroy Sandbank.
6602. That is off Cairns ? To windward of Cairns.
6603. Off Pitzroy Island ? Yes. I was working about 6 miles to windward of that island the last time
I was that way.
6604. How long ago was that ? Three years ago.
6605. Is the fish scarce down there ? There is plenty of fish there.
6606. By the Chairman: But you have been fishing at Cooktown since that ? I have been as far as
Cooktown, but I did not go out fishing. I met with a misfortune there, and I came back, but my sons
went out fishing further south.
6607. You think there is plenty of fish on the Barrier Eeef ? Yes; there is a good bit of fish on the
Barrier, and on some of the inner reefs.
6608. Is there plenty of pearl-shell in the Strait ? In some places. There is plenty of shell about
Darnley Island, but it is in too deep water.
6609. By Mr. Douglas : "Where did you fish for pearl-shell in the early days ? On the Warrior Eeef,
around Prince of Wales group, and out to Mabuiag.
6610. By Mr. Bennett: Is shell as plentiful now as when you first came here ? No.
6611. By the Chairman : Were you diving yourself in those days ? I have been down in the dress from
my own boat having a try.
6612. By Mr. Bennett: Your boats mostly work swimming-diving ? Yes. At the time I opened
the Darnley patch I had two boats diving.
6613. Were they pump-boats ? Yes.
6614. By Mr. Douglas: Have you ever used a pump-boat for beche-de-mer? My son William has tried
it, but it rots the gear too much.
6615. By Mr. Bennett: What labour have you mostly used in your boats ? Murray Island boys and
mainland aboriginals.
6616. By the Chairman : Are they good ? Some of them are very good.
6617. Have you had any experience of Papuans? Yes. They are not much good.
6618. By Mr. Bennett ; For beche-de-mer ? No. The mainland natives are better than they are.
6619. Are the Murray Island natives as good as either for beche-de-mer ? Yes; but some of them are

Cavtain J. MACKAY {Chairman) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Edward Mosby, Seaman, Pearl Sheller, and Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined:
0719. By the Chairman : What are you ? A seaman and pearl-sheller.
0750. How long have you been in Torres Strait? About thirty-seven years.
0751. During that time what have you been doing ? I was diving at first and bsche-de-mer fishing
afterwards.
0752. How long were you diving ? For three years.
0753. Continually ? Yes.
0754. In deep water ? Ho ; 15 fathoms was the deepest.
0754 a. Did you suffer any injury from the continual diving? No ; I met with an accident and had to
knock off.
0755. You did not suffer from the effects of the diving ? No.
0750. By Mr. Bennett-. You did not get rheumatics? No; there is none of that diving in 15 and 20
fathoms. I have been down in 20 fathoms, but not getting shell, '
0757. By the Chairman : From your experience of diving, do you think the work can be carried on by
white men ? Certainly, Ido not say in deep water. In former days they wore all white divers. I was
the first man broken in in Torres Strait.
0758. You think diving can be carried on by white men working at reasonable depths ? Yes. I do not say
at 35 fathoms.
0759. Is shell as plentiful now as it was when you were diving ? My last trip to Thursday Island I
took in 2,050 shell that were got in 3or 4 fathoms in places where we used to get shell. There was just
as much shell there as ever. With two boats we were getting 100 shell a day, and sometimes more. That
shell came from places that we reckoned were worked out.
0700. Do you think there is shell to be obtained in payable quantities? Yes, for swimming boats in
shallow water.
0701. Does that apply to all over Torres Strait? No. lam only speaking of the ground for 30 miles
on either side of the Warrior Beef. Shell seems to be just as plentiful as it was in former years.
0702. Have you any idea of the number of boats working here now ? No.
G7G3. By Mr. Bouglas -. You have not been working on the Old Ground? No.
0704. Then you do not know what the condition of the Old Ground is? No. I worked there in former
days. Of course they are all pump boats there now.
0765. By Mr. Bennett-. What was the condition of the Old Ground in former days? It was splendid.
What is called the Old Ground is 30 miles outside Cook Beef up to Booby Island, and 10 miles outside
that, with 8 to 10 fathoms of water. Then the mainland water from Bed Point to Batavia Biver was
another good ground.
0706. When you came here in 1871, did you come as a diver? No. I was second mate aboard “The
Three Brothers.”
0707. When did you take up diving ? About two years after I came here. We came up in “ The Three
Brothers,” and we were full up of shell. Four of us bought a cutter, but we lost her, .and then I worked
for Mr. Jardino.
0708. Were you all white divers ? Yes.
0709. How long do you consider it takes to learn diving ? Four or five days. Anybody can dive.
6770. It is only a matter of gaining experience ? You have to be pretty solid, but almost any man can
dive.
0771. To become successful! all that is required is experience ? Frank Summers, at Thursday Island, is
one of the old divers. He could dive to-day, and he is seventy-four years old—as old as 1 am.
6772. Are you seventy-four years old ? I will be in another six months. I met with an accident, and
had to give up diving.
0773. What wages were white men making when you were diving ? Big wages. One man who was
working for me was making £5O a month.
0774. Was that out of shell alone ? Yes ; without pearls. I was paying him £4 10s. per 100 shell. Of
course, shell was bringing a big price then.
0775. What was the price of shell? I was dealing with Burns, Philp, and Co. then, and I was
doing well. One month old Andrew Sinclair, who was working for me, made £55, and another
month he made £45 ; and there were other white men who made more than that. He was not an extra
good man. ' .
6776. What was the smallest shell they were picking up m those days ? I have seen them coming in
with 1,500 and 2,000 shell.
6777. How much would they weigh ? A little over a ton —that was from the Old Ground. I have seen
a white man come in with 2,500 shell for about five weeks.
6778. Did the divers in those days pick up small shell ? I could not say. I believe it was put a stop to.
6779. But when you were a diver did you ever pick up a 5-inch shell ? No ;we left shell that size. We
would not bother about them. The shell was so thick when I was diving that you could not make a
mistake You could not help getting shell in 6or 7 fathoms of water on the Brady Bank on the
mainland down by Bed Island. In “ The Three Brothers ”we got 47 tons of shell there in four months.
6780 Is there any place in Torres Strait now where you could get 47 tons of shell in four months? No.
0781 ]So that shell is not so plentiful now as it was when you started ? You cannot tell where there is
shell.' Where my boats are working now we stopped working before because the ground was searched
6782.’ How long is it since you worked there before ? Four or five years.
0783' Was the shell thick then ? AVe finished it up.

29 June, 1908.
6784. Have you any idea how long it takes shell to grow from the spat to a good size ? Mr. Saville
\ Kent states in his report that it takes nine years, but I think it takes longer than that for a shell to grow
to 7 or 8 inches.
6785. By Mr. Douglas -. Is it your experience that a greater number of pearls are found in the smaller
shell ? I think the biggest pearls are found in the small dwarfed shell—that is, in old shell like the
one on the table [ ‘pointing io a specimen ].
6786. In a 5 or 6-inch shell ? In 8-inch shell.
6787. By the Chairman : What size was the largest pearl you ever got ? I have had them all sizes.
I got one the size of a wongai, but a native spoiled it.
6788. By Mr. Bennett -. What is the most you have ever sold a pearl for? I sold one for £3OO, and the
man who bought it afterwards sold it for £7OO.
6789. By Mr. Douglas : Are you working beche-de-mer now? Yes. We had been fishing up the
Cumberland Passage, but we knocked off there in January last.
6790. Did you get plenty of beche-de-mer in the earlier days? Any amount—there was more than you
could catch. Last year I got 13 tons of beche-de-mer.
6791. Prom the reefs round about Torke Island? No; we have to swim for the fish. During the day
you will not see a fish, but at night when it is moonlight they come up thick.
6792. How many boats do you work ? lam working three here now, and one little boat at Cocoanut
Island.
6793. On what reefs have you noticed the fish coming up in the moonlight? On the reefs in
Cumberland Passage, and in Hibernia Passage.
6794. Do they come up from the deep water ? They must do.
6795. You have not been actively working at beche-de-mer fishing yourself for some years ? No ; I have
not been out myself since 1 lost my leg.
6796. How many boats are licensed in your name now ? Pour swimming diving boats.
6797. What number of boats do you manage? Pifteen swimming diving boats and one pump
boat.
6798. Do you employ natives of Yorke Island ? Yes.
0799. Have they got any boats of their own ? Yes ; one, which is clear.
6800. By Mr. Bennett-. Are they earning much ? I cannot say that they are earning a great deal.
There is no management in their work.
6801. By Mr. Douglas :Do they work well now that they have the boat clear? They worked well
before, but now they humbug a lot, travelling round to the different islands.
6802. They go round visiting other islands ? Yes.
6803. By Mr. Bennett-. Cannot the Mamoose keep-them at work ? They do not obey the Mamoose. He
is not the boss here, and Ido not think any Mamoose in the Strait has any authority. Certain people
order the natives about, and they obey them.
6804. If a high reef is skinned of beche-de-mer, how long will it be before there are plenty of fish there ’
again ? I left some of those reefs alone for about seven years, and when we went back to them we
found the fishing nearly as good as it was previously. There are two ways of getting fish—walking
about and picking them up on the reef, and swimming for them.
6805. lam speaking of fish got on the top of a reef ? I reckon that if a reef is left alone for three or four
years you can get a pretty plentiful supply of fish, though not as much as you would get formerly. The
boys are getting plenty of fish now on reefs which were never worked before. At low water the stones
are visible, and the natives know a reef by the stones. Sometimes they find a patch on a reef which is
covered with beche-de-mer, and fill up a boat from that patch in three or four days ; but when they go
hack they may not be able to find that patch again. I think the fish on the Barrier Beef is all teat fish.
6806. By the Chairman-. Is not the teat fish the most valuable? No ; the deep-water red fish. The teat
fish used to be the most valuable.
6807. Do you remember beche-de-mer ever bringing such a low price as at present ? Well, I got
£9O a ton this time. I believe the fish about Murray Island and all up here is the best fish in the world,
if it is properly cured The Japanese do not cure them very well on account of the wood and water.
There is no suitable wood on Murray Island.
6808. By Mr. Bennett -. Where do you cure the fish ? It is all cured in the boats. The chalky and sand
fish are worth next to nothing. There must be thousands of tons of them on Tutu Eeef. I have seen 5
tons taken in by a Manila man.
Baenet Mosby, Pearl Sheller and Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined:
6809. By Mr. Bennett: You work in the boats ? Yes.
6810. At pearl-shelling and beche-de-mer fishing ? Yes.
,6811. For how long have yon been at that work—All your life ? Yes.
6812. What reefs about here have you been mostly working for beche-de-mer? Cumberland Reef and
Hibernia Reef.
6813. Is there as much beche-de-mer on those reefs now as there used to be when you first went out ?
There is beche-de-mer now on the same reefs that were worked when I was young.
6814. When you first went out did you get the beche-de-mer on top of the reefs ? Yes.
6815. Do you get it on top of the reefs now ? Yes ;at good low water. If it is not low water I swim
and I get fish just the same.
6810. What is this about getting fish on moonlight nights? If you want to get more fish you take a
small flour bag, and go on the reef on a fine moonlight night; and you can fill your bag in ten minutes,
they are so thick. They all come out then, but in the day time you may not find any there.
6817. Did you always know that ? I found it out about a year ago.
6818. Do other men know that, or only you ? At first only we knew it, but now they all know, as they
saw we were getting fish, and then they found out how we were getting it.
6819. Butyou must have fine weather ? Yes.
6820. How long ago before this time was it that you got plenty of pearl-shell on the Wappa Eeef? About
four years ago, when I was working for Jimmy Mills. I got plenty then, and cleaned it out, and lam
finding shell now in the same places. When I worked for Jimmy Mills I used to get thirty or forty
shell a day, and now our three boats get over 300 a day—fine big shell.
6821. Have you any boats of your own ? No; they belong to my father.

WEDNESDAY, 1 JULY, 1908.
Present:
Mn. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A. (in the Chair) | Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
Nicolas Het, Clergyman of the Moravian Church, and Superintendent of the Mapoon Presbyterian
Mission, examined :
6822. By Mr. Douglas : What are you ? A clergyman of the Moravian Church and Superintendent of the
Mapoon Presbyterian Mission.
6823. How long have you been at Mapoon ? Sixteen years.
6824. Have you been in constant touch with the natives during that time ? I have lived among the
natives the whole time, with the exception of one year, when I was on furlough in Europe.
6825. Have you been Protector of the natives under an arrangement with* the Government during any
part of that time ? No ; but as superintendent of the mission lam responsible to the Government for
the well-being of the natives.
6826. What is the area of the Mapoon Reserve ? It comprises three different reserves. One reserve
was added quite recently—in December last.
6827. How far south from Mapoon does the reserve extend ? It extends from 20 miles north of Mapoon
to 10 miles south of the Archer River—that is a coast line of 150 miles.
6828. Have you any idea of the number of natives on the reserve ? Roughly speaking, 1,500 men,
women, and children.
6829. Are any of those natives employed in the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries ? They used to be
employed in those industries formerly, but at present there are practically none so employed. There are
a few out now, but when they return it is not likely they will go out again.
6830. How many adult males are there on the reserve ? About, one-fourth of the total number.
6831. Bg Mr. Bennett : That is about 350 F Put it at 250, and you will be on the safe side.
6832. What do you call adults? Those over sixteen years of age.
6833. By Mr. Douglas : Are the natives increasing or decreasing in number ? They are decreasing in
number. I have kept a strict record for the last fourteen years, which shows that the ratio of the birth
rate to the death rate is as one to three.
6834. Are the natives physically fit for the work of swimming for beche-de-mer and pearl-shell? On the
whole the work is detrimental to them, but there are a certain number who are fit for the work, and I
think the life is congenial to them ; but they are exceptions. Taking it all round, working in any kind
of boat is detrimental to the natives.
6835. How many years is it since the Mapoon Reserve was closed to the recruiting of natives for
employment in the fisheries ? The reserve has been closed to recruiting since 1901, though the natives
have been taken on boats since then.
6836. When recruiting went on there, what was the method employed —Did the men on boats go down
there and induce the natives to go on board the boats? At that time there was no protection and no
restriction, and men could do as they liked.
6837. Did they get a permit from the Protector of Aboriginals at Thursday Island ? Men used to
recruit the natives before permits were issued. It is only during the last ten years that permits have
been required. , , .. „
6838. Some years ago men in charge of boats used to go to the grounds and bring the natives away ? Ihe
men m charge of boats remained there for some days, sometimes for some weeks, and lived among the
natives, and by bribery induced them to go away with them in the boats.
6839. By Mr. Bennett: To whom were the bribes given—to the young men themselves or to the old men?
The bribes were given to the more influential members of the tribe, so that the relatives left behind were
the persons who were benefited. , , ...
6840. By Mr. Douglas: What was the nature of the bribes given ? Flour, tobacco, and liquor.
6841 Has that system proved detrimental to the interests of the natives ? Of course, it has had a very
detrimental effect on the natives—in fact, it has demoralised them to a great extent. The most
able-bodied men, who were perhaps fit for the work, became parasites, and the weaker ones were put on
Do the natives in agriculture at Mapoon ? All natives who desire to work find
6843°^ What do they get in return for their labour ? Their clothing and their living—for themselves,
their wives and families. An arrangement has been made quite recently under which all the products not
reauired for dailv food are divided among the blacks, according to the number of days they have
worked A record of their working days is kept, and at the end of the year a division of surplus
produce is made on that basis.
6841 Are they obliged to work ? No,
6845' But if they do not choose to work they do not get any pay ? They do not get any food.
6846 Do they still continue their hunting expeditions for game ? Occasionally they fish and hunt. In
fact that is encouraged, because it is essential to their health that they should have an occasional spell

f
I.July, 1908.
6848. By Mr. Bennett: They use the women for purposes of prostitution ? Yes.
v 6848 a. Tinder those circumstances it might be advisable to establish proper supervision of the natives,
and prevent boats recruiting on their own account ? That would be less detrimental to the natives than
the present system.
6849. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that recruiting by a Government official—not allowing the actual
employers of natives to have any communication with the reserves—would be a desirable thing ?
Decidedly. If the Government would take up the recruiting, it would be beneficial to both the traders
and the natives.
CB5O. By Mr. Bennett; By that you mean recruiting outside the reserves ? Yes ; where there is no
supervision, and where the natives are engaged by aliens. 1 think it is better that the natives should be
recruited under Government supervision than that they should be recruited without any supervision.
6851. By Mr. Douglas: Have you any idea of the number of natives north of Mapoon to Cape York ?
I visited the tribes in that district quite recently, and conferred with the police official who had been
there several times, and we came to the conclusion that there were not more than 200 natives left.
6852. By Mr. Bennett: Do you include in that estimate the Seven Rivers tribe ? Yes; three different
tribes north of Mapoon —the Seven Rivers tribe, the Jardine River tribe, and the Red Island tribe.
G 853. By Mr. Douglas: Is the remuneration which the natives get in the way of flour, tobacco, and
calico regarded by them as a sufficient reward for their services on the boats ? I think the natives are
satisfied as a rule with what they get before they go on board. They consider the bribes, as I call
them, given to them before they are engaged more tfan anything else.
6854. By Mr. Bennett: You allude to what are called advances ? Yes. The advances are of more
importance to them than the actual pay they receive when their time of service has expired.
6853. By Mr. Douglas : If the recruiting were done under a Government official, would the natives still
require to be bribed in order to induce them to engage on the boats ? Ido not think many of them
would be willing to go to work on the boats at first without a bribe; but, as far as I know the people,
I believe they would gradually become reconciled to the now conditions.
6SSG. By Mr. Bennett: Under the conditions which obtained in years gone by, what were the nationali-
ties of the men who used to recruit aboriginals from the Mapoon reserve ? They were principally
Japanese, Malays, and Manila men, with a few Europeans.
G 857. Are any attempts made now to evade the existing regulations ? There have been attempts up till
quite recently.
6858. By whom ? South Sea Islanders.
6859. Have any steps been taken to bring those men to justice? The aboriginals were returned to their
homes by the authorities and were not put on the articles.
6860. So that the owners of the boats suffered a loss ? Yes.
6861. What was the rule in former years as to the age at which aboriginals were taken away to work in
the boats ? There was no age limit at all. Children of six years of age have been on board of some of the
vessels.
6862. Boys between ten and fourteen years of age were often preferred to men? Yes; because they
were said to be more willing to work than adults.
6863. What was the effect of diving on the health of those boys ? It has increased the death rate of the
aboriginals to a great extent.
6864. Owing to what causes ? Consumption has been introduced. About two-thirds of the boys have
died inside of six months after their return. I have kept a strict record of the time. That is a very
deplorable state of affairs.
6865. By Mr. Douglas : What was the length of their engagements ? Six and twelve months.
6866. By Mr. Bennett: Do you mean that two-thirds of the young boys who have been returned have
died ? Two-thirds of all those who have been employed on board of vessels for this purpose.
6867. Are you speaking of men also ? Yes. Once consumption is introduced it remains. As far as I
can make out, it is the result of exposure —getting wet and sleeping on board in wet clothes. All the
aboriginals are weak-chested.
6868. When aboriginals were taken away from the reserve under the old conditions, without any super-
vision, were they always returned? In many cases they were never returned. I know of instances were
we never heard anything of them, although we made inquiries—they disappeared altogether.
6869. If those aboriginals were in existence, would they not sooner or later turn up at their homes ? They
should have turned up by this time.
6870. But they have not? No. Nothing was ever heard of them.
6871. Aboriginals try to return to their homes at some time or other ? Yes ; unless they are too far from
homo.
6872. Do those who return bring back the fruits of their labour in any shape? Only about one-fifth of
their wages reach the station. Once a boat returned with ten boys. Dr. Roth was at Mapoon at the
time, and I requested him to go to the beach and see what the boys had brought with them. After doing
so he said that all they brought back would be dear at £l, and they should have had £5 each.
6783. Have the natives ever complained about not receiving all that they were entitled to ? Very seldom
indeed, as they do not know the value of their wages. In fact, it is no benefit to them whether they
bring back all their wages or whether they bring back nothing. About a year ago twenty boys were
returned. What they brought back amounted to £2O worth of goods. Their wages altogether were
£45. Pour days afterwards there was nothing to bo seen of what they brought. That is the rule with
them.
6874. Had they distributed it? There was fighting over it. Part of it was eaten ; but they did not have
even a fish hook after four days.
6875. I suppose it passes into the possession of the strongest? It is impossible for them to keep anything
unless they are under supervision.
6876. By Mr. Douglas: Anything they take back is regarded as common property by the tribe ? Yes ;
and, being common property, everybody tries to do away with it as quickly as possible, so that it is only
harmful to them.
6877. By Mr. Bennett: Irrespective of wages, all things are regarded as common property ? Yes; they
are socialists.


68/8. Do you think that the younger generation of aboriginals is showing anv improvement as a conse-
quence of the instruction and supervision that they have received ? Owing to their weak physique and
their dying out, very little improvement is to he seen. It would, therefore, be a good thing to get new
blood amongst them. I have ascertained from observation and experience that, when the half-castes and
aboriginals intermarry, their progeny have more vitality and energy, and their numbers increase. We
have noticed that at Mapoon.
6879. What class of half-castes do you refer to ? The children of aboriginal mothers and Manila,
Malays, South Sea Islanders, Chinese, and Japanese fathers.
6880. Have you many half-castes who are the children of white fathers ? Ido not think there are more
than four on the station. If any permanent improvement is to be effected, the natives must be kept
from all outside influences. On that point lam quite decided.
6881. Then the result of your observations is that the natives, as an aboriginal race, must die out? They
are a doomed race. The low birth-rate, rather than the high death-rate, shows that their vitality is gone.
The mixed marriages with half-castes are very prolific.
6882. From such marriages there is a large issue ? Yes. If I take Mapoon by itself, there is an increase
in the population. There we have proper supervision. But, taking the reserve as a whole, there is a
decrease, because there is not the same supervision. Outside of the reserve the decrease is still greater.
6883. Do the aboriginals within the reserve come into touch with those outside to any extent? Very
seldom. They have fixed boundaries.
6884. There is usually some hostility between the tribes ? Yes. They always run a risk if they go
outside of their own boundaries.
6885. The aboriginals of Mapoon proper are afraid of the Seven Bivers people ? Yes. They have
scarcely any intercourse with each other.
6886. So that it is a comparatively easy matter to keep the natives of one place away from those of
another locality ? Yes. Of course Nature has provided for this. There are large rivers which the
natives recognise as boundaries.
6887. Do you think that the old marriage customs of the natives in any way conduce to the decreasing
birth rate ? The customs of the natives in regard to intermarriage are very good, as marriages between
relatives are not allowed. Their law on that point is very strict. But, since they have come into
contact with outside civilisation, their law in that respect has lost its force to a great extent.
6888. It is disregarded ? It is entirely disregarded, and no doubt the dying-out of the people is due to
the fact that they have disregarded their own marriage law. My opinion is that, where the natives can
be gathered in isolated reserves, they can be raised to a higher level; but they require new blood as wejl
to keep the race alive. Up to the present time the number of half-castes has increased considerably,
especially in the Gulf district, and eventually these half-castes will be the only link with the aboriginal
natives that will be left.
6889. Do the half-castes show any disposition to settle down to a steady and industrious mode of life ?
They have much more vitality than the aboriginal', and a certain amount of ambition. There is no
ambition among aboriginals. The custom at Mapoon during the last two years has been to settle the
various families on their own little homesteads of from 10 to 20 acres, and we believe that will prove
the only solution of the problem.
6890. Having regard to the settlement of the Peninsula, do you think it is desirable that the land should
be settled by the descendants of the aboriginals ? I think Europeans will hardly ever take up the land
or live in the northern part of the Peninsula.
6891. Why ? Because the land is not rich enough; it is too poor for Europeans to live upon, unless
they discovered and worked mines.
6892. What about cattle-raising ? The country is not suitable for cattle-raising so far north. It has been
tried, and has not been a success.
6893. What is the nearest station to your place ? York Downs, which is between the 11th and 12th
parallels of South latitude.
6894. Are you acquainted with York Downs ? Yes, I know the place well.
6895. What has been the result of the attempt's to raise cattle there ? I suppose the owner would say
they have just paid expenses.
6896. Has there been a good increase in the cattle ? There has been a large increase in the stock, but a
very large tract of country is required for pasturage.
6897. Docs newly-imported stock maintain its condition, or does it improve t or deteriorate in quality ?
Stock will not thrive until about the third or fourth generation, when it becomes acclimatised. I have
proved that by my own experience. It is necessary to continue introducing new blood. The cattle in the
Gulf district are now doing well, and are in good condition. The old cattle-owners have told me that in
their earlier experiences they had very heavy losses.
6898. By Mr. Douglas: Do the natives interfere with the cattle ? Very seldom.
6899. Your Society has a station at the Mitchell River ? No —at the Archer River and the Embley
River.
6900. What is the physical condition of the natives at the Archer River ? They are very strong in
physique because they come very little into touch with civilisation. They are in a wild condition,
especially the coast blacks. I measured one man who was 6 feet 6 inches in height.
6901. By Mr. Bennett-. Did you take his chest measurement ? No. .
6902. By Mr. Douglas : Was his general build proportionate to his height ? Perhaps not; he was rather
lean But taking those men all round, they are very superior to the men you see further north ; and
that can only be accounted for by the fact that they have not come into touch with civilisation. The
more the aboriginal race and the white and alien races are kept separate, the better it will be for all con-
Mr. Bennett : Is it your opinion that, if the aboriginal race had been kept entirely to itself
within reserves, it would not have died off as it has done ? The people would not have died off as they
have done • but no regulations will keep them in reserves. That is impossible. Such a thing can only be
done in isolated instances as an experiment.
fiOOi You consider the game would not be worth the candle? It would not.
C 0 Have the natives on the Embley River come into touch with civilisation yet? Nearly as much as
the natives at Mapoon. They have been on boats.
N. Hey.
1 July, 1908.


690 G. Hare the results been the same ? The results have been exactly the same.
6907. Has there been a decrease in the birth rate ? Yes ; and the people have been demoralised. They
are losing their power of endurance and their willingness to find their own food as they did formerly,
which is the greatest drawback.
6908. Do they abandon their hunting habits ? They abandon their hunting habits, and when they reach
thirty-five years of age they are hardly fit to work on the boats any longer. Then they are set down on
their own homes, and are altogether useless, not being able to make even a spear.
6909. Do they lose their tracking instinct ? Yes, the instinct of tracking and the way of finding their
food. They lose all their cunning, and that is a very deplorable thing for any aboriginal. I think that
shows that provision should be made for their continuing one mode of life. If they find their living on
boats, they should end their davs on the boats. If that is not possible, then they should continue to live
on the land and get their living in their own way.
6910. Do you mean that, if they are taken to work in the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer industries,
they should be kept in those industries ? Provision should be made for what we might call old age
pensions.
6911. Do you mean that they should not be thrown back on their own resources ? When they
become useless in the boats they should not be thrown aside and left to their own resources.
6912. Which do you consider is less harmful to the natives —employment in the pearl-shell industry or
employment in the beche-de-mer fishery ? I do not think it matters much which industry they are
employed in ;it depends very much upon the condition of life in the boats. In pearl-shelling they swim
in shallow water, and in beche-de-mer fishery they work mostly on the reefs. The beche-de-mer fishery
is usually carried on with inferior boats and inferior men in charge of the boats.
6913. Then you consider that, on the whole, they live under better conditions on the pearl-shell boats ?
Yes, on the whole.
6914. Of course the aboriginals are not employed on the pump diving boats ? Occasionally they have
been employed as extra hands, but usually they are employed in the swimming diving boats.
6915. Do you think they are better treated in the swimming diving boats than in the beche-de-mer boats?
Yes; simply because there are better-disposed men in charge of the pearl-shell boats
6916. Which class of boats do the aboriginals themselves prefer ? So far as I have been able to ascertain,
it depends greatly on the man in charge of the boat. They say, “I go with such-and-such a man,”
irrespective of the work.
6917. Is there anything you would like to say in addition to the evidence you have given ? I think that
I-have covered everything.
6918. Can you suggest anything that we have overlooked ? As far as my knowledge goes, I would
certainly advise collecting the natives north of Mapoon and on the east coast, in some central depot
under Government supervision. Of course the officer in charge would require a boat to collect the
natives from the mainland.
6919. Where would you suggest the depdt should be? It should not be far from Thursday Island, but
Ido not think it should be on the mainland. At this depdt some industry should be carried on, so that
men waiting to be shipped would have something to do, and they would be kept continually employed.
6920. By Mr. Douglas : Seeing there is no station between Cape York and Cape Bedford, would you
suggest that a central station on the east coast should be established in conjunction with the depot you
have mentioned? No ; because the number of aboriginals is not sufficiently large to justify the expense
of two stations. lam quite certain that one station would be quite sufficient.
6921. By Mr. Bennett: Of course you are aware that a number of natives are employed on beche-de-mer
boats belonging to Cooktown ? Yes.
6922. You are aware of the difficulty the Cooktown boats would labour under if they bad to come here
for crews? I had only Thursday Island in view when I made my suggestion. If you consider Cooktown
as well, such a depot would be out of reach.
6923. By Mr. Douglas : If a depot were established on some island adjacent to Thursday Island, and
natives were brought there from the east coast, would it. not be almost a necessity to jhave a station in
some central situation on the east coast from which the natives could get back to their old haunts for a
time ? They ought to be taken back to their own homes, as they might never reach them from some
central place. They might be killed. They might have to travel 50 or 100 miles from a central station
to reach their homes ; and it would be hardly fair to expect them to go by themselves. They should be
landed at their homes. .
6924. Would not the same trafficking go on with the women ? You could control that better if you had
a central station. At present they are scattered over such a large area and the numbers are so decreasing
year after year that you can have no control. Wo have been at Mapoon for sixteen years, and it is only
now that we are able to keep the three tribes together.
6925. By Mr. Bennett: What diseases are most prevalent among the natives? Several diseases
principally syphilis. Then there are some blood diseases, and leprosy.
6926. Is there much leprosy ? Ido not think there is much ; but there are isolated cases. A risk is run
by bringing the natives into settled places like Thursday Island and Cooktown, without any medical
inspection. lam surprised that more harm has not been done.
6927. Aboriginal lepers have been brought in here ? Yes ; and some of them have been removed to the
leper station at Friday Island. There are still some cases of suspected leprosy ; and there is a danger in
bringing aboriginals to Thursday Island and allowing them to go to the stores and mix with Europeans.
6928. Do the natives readily bring under your notice any cases of disease, or do they attempt to conceal
them ? They do not conceal them. The only time wild blacks come to our station is when they contract
some disease or become old. lamin a good position to speak regarding the death-rate, as all the deaths
more or less occur at the station. When they get old or sick, their relatives sometimes carry them for 50
or 100 miles, and leave them at the station. It is different with the births. Although we find out about
the births by seeing the children, still there is a difficulty. It is quite certain that a dep&t on the
mainland, such as has been proposed, would prove a failure owing to the nature of the aboriginals.
6929. You mean that they would break bounds? Yes. There are times and seasons when no aboriginals
would be seen at a mainland dep6t, and boats would be unable to recruit. They might have gone off on a
hunting expedition, and you would have no means to hold them.

6930. At certain seasons, following their tribal customs, they must be in certain places ? Tes, to perform
certain rites, or to obtain certain fruits or certain fish. There is always a reason for their moving about, /
and it is impossible to break down these barriers to their civilisation unless they are confined to some ]
place away from their homes. I quite believe that they would be happy after some time ; but they would
require to be under continual supervision.

CAPTAIN J. MACKAY {Chairman) ) Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
John Henkt SciiLUiEiq Protector of Aboriginals, Ex-diver, and Master of Government ketch
“ Melbidir,” examined:
6931. By the Chairman : What are you? A seaman.
6932. You are at present master of the Government ketch “Melbidir?” Yes.
6933. By Mr. Bennett : What is the ketch employed in ? Patrolling the fishing grounds, mostly.
6934. By the Chairman : How long have you been in Torres Strait? Twelve or fourteen years.
6935. By Mr. Bennett : Do you remember what year you came here ? In 1891.
6936. By the Chairman: How were you employed when you first came here ? Diving for pearl-shell.
6937. How long were you engaged diving for pearl-shell. In Torres Strait about five or six years.
6938. Were you engaged diving anywhere else? Yes, over at New Guinea.
6939. How long were you engaged at diving altogether ? About fifteen years.
6940. Were you diving before you came to Torres Strait? Yes.
6941. What depth were you in the habit of going down ? All depths ; but the deepest I have been down
is about 25 fathoms.
6942. Have you suffered any physical injury from diving ? No.
6943. Then you can say that during fitteen years’ diving you suffered no physical injury ? None
whatever.
6944. You know the pearl-shell industry well ? I do.
6945. Erom your long experience in the industry, do you think it could be carried on by white divers and
white tenders ? Yes ; I cannot see why it should not be carried on by white divers and white tenders.
You do not mean with white crews ?
6946. Coloured crews —I refer now especially to white divers and white tedders? I think white men
could carry on the industry.
6947. You come from the Baltic, do you not? Yes.
6948. Are vou familiar with a fisherman’s life in the North Sea? I am not.
6949. Hou'know how cold it is there ? Yes; I sailed in the Baltic.
6950. Do you think pearl-shell diving is a more precarious and a harder life than fishing in the North
Sea? No.
6951. Which do you think is the harder life ? Pishing in the Baltic.
6952. Do you think that under normal conditions a steady man would suffer any bodily harm from constant
diving ? No ; that is, providing he has a sound constitution. A man must have a good constitution to
stand the work-
6953. Do you think it necessary for a man to undergo a medical examination before becoming a diver?
No ; a man will soon find out whether he can stand the work or not.
6953a. Can you suggest anything which would make the industry more attractive to white men? The
reason why white divers have not been able to do as well as Japanese is that they have only one diver on
a boat • whereas the Japanese have three or four divers on each boat, who relieve one another, so that the
work is not so hard on one man, and they are continually on the ground. Therefore the ground does
not get a spell. Where there is only one diver, the ground gets a certain amount of spell.
6954. Do you think it would be a good thing for the Government to have a vessel here to train young
men as divers ? Yes ; I think that would be a very good thing.
6955 Do you think men in Scandinavia would be induced to come here if it were made known in their
country that they could be trained as divers for pearl-shelling ? 1 think they would.
6956 Have you any knowledge of the scientific cultivation of the pearl-oyster? No.
6957, Do you know what number of boats are at present engaged in the pearl-shelling industry ? I
believe the number is a little over 100. ,. . , , ,, ,
6958 It is 112 Erom what you know of the pearling grounds, do you think that number should be
increased ? I think not. There are sufficient boats on the ground now to work the place profitably.
6959 Was your experience in diving gained inshore or in a pump boat out on the shell grounds ? Out
on the grounds in a pump boat. ... T . •
6960 Were you working there with a schooner as a floating station ? No. 4or a while I was working
' + rest of the time I worked from a shore station.
696L To what size do you think boats or luggers should be restricted ? To 15 or 18 tons. That is a nice
do you think floating stations have on the beds? Under the floating station system
boats are continually working the beds, so that they are more worked on that system than on the shore
he svstem of fishing from floating stations tend to deplete the beds ? Yes.
6964 Bv Mr Bennett-. Can you give us any idea of the conditions of the beds now as compared with
their condition in your time ? No. I have not been at work tor some years now, but I think shell is
not very plentiful on the Old Ground now.
J. H.
Schluter.
2 July, 1908.


69G5. Are you familiar with the Darnley area? Yes; I have worked there, but not in the deep water.
6966. Do you think the deep water there is a nursery for the distribution of spat ? I do.
, G9G7. What leads you to that conclusion ? There is very deep water at that place, and you canuot touch
the shell, so that there is more shell left to throw the spat.
6998. And the spat is distributed through the Torres Strait areas p My opinion is that it floats all
through Torres Strait.
G9G9. Carried by the currents ? Yes.
G 970. And the wind ? I suppose the wind and the currents together.
6971. Have you a good knowledge of the general trend of the currents between Darnley Island and
Thursday Island? As nearly as I can get at it, the current mostly sets to the westward.
G 972. What is the prevailing wind ? South-east.
G 973. In what direction would that tend to carry the spat ? It would set it up towards here.
6971. Would it not tend to set it over towards New Guinea P It might set it there also.
G 975. Do you not think that most of the spat reaches the Orman Reef and the northern end of Wappa ?
Yes.
6976. The spat would he more likely to reach there than Endeavour Strait? Yes. I think very little
goes through Endeavour Strait; it may go the other way to Wappa.
6977. How long is it since you left off diving for pearl-shell in Torres jStrait ? About ten or eleven
years.
6978. Why did you leave off ? First of all, because the size limit was restricted to 6 inches ; then the
shell went down in price, and got a bit scarce, and I thought the game was not good enough, and that I
could do better otherwise.
6979. In fact, it did not pay ? It did not.
6980. What income would you consider necessary to make the industry attractive to white divers ?
About a couple of hundred pounds a year.
6981. If they could not earn that ? It would be hardly worth their while going into the industry.
6982. I suppose you reckon a man would want to earn more than a mere livelihood at diving ? Yes ; he
wants a little bit over and above his living.
6983. What was the most you earned in any one year ? One year I bought a boat on Ist June for
£325, and at Christmas I had cleared it off and had £4O to the good. Then the new patch broke out at
Yrilya Point, otherwise known as Red Point.
6984. After you cleared your boat were you able to keep her clear? Yes; but 1 went south and got
married, and while I was away the man I left in charge of the boat put her on Orman Reef and knocked
her bottom out. It cost me about £2OO to get her repaired, and then I got into debt for a while. I tried
to clear it off ; sometimes I cleared off a few pounds, and at other times it blew hard, and I would go
down again.
6985. When you sold out of the industry, did you have your boat clear? No.
6986. So that, on the whole, you lost ground after that accident? Yes.
6987. What was a fair catgh of shell, year in and year out, when you were diving ? About Bor 10 tons
when I started.
6988. What did you get towards the latter end ? Pour or 5 tons.
6989. The average catch decreased by one half? Yes.
6990. The price of shell also decreased ? Yes; and then came the 6-inch limit, and since then it has
been reduced to 5 inches.
6991. Before the 6-inch limit was introduced wCre you picking up 5-inch shell ? We used to pick
up anything.
6292. I suppose you had to do so to make a catch? Yes.
6993. What is the relative weight of a 6-inch and a 5-inch shell ? There are about 2,000 6-inch
shell to the ton, and there would be a few hundred more of 5-inch shell.
6994. Did you ever weigh them ? No ; we just weighed them altogether.
6995. Then 6-inch shell would wnigh about 1 lb. each? Yes.
6996. Did you employ a white tender when you were diving? Sometimes I did.
6997. What wages did you pay a white tender ? £4 a month.
6998. What did you pay coloured tenders ? About £3 10s. a ton- It made very little difference.
6999. What kind of coloured tenders did you employ ? As a rule they were Malays.
700 J. In cruising round you have seen where the boats are working now ? Yes.
7001. Which beds were most worked in your time ? The Old Ground.
7002. How far west of Badu did you work? Right away to the sandbanks at Deliverance Island.
7003. How far have you known boats to work latterly ? I could not say.
7004. Since vou began pearl-shelling in 1891 the yield of pearl-shell has decreased very much? Yes.
7005. Grounds that you worked profitably then could not be worked profitably now ? No.
7006. You worked on the Warrior Reef then ? Yes.
7007. Would you think of working there now, from what you know of the ground? No.
7008. Did you work in Endeavour Strait at all ? Yes.
7009. With what success ? We got very good shell there in fair quantities.
7010. Do you think you would be able to get good shell in fair quantities there now? No.
7011. On the whole, you think the grounds have been considerably depleted? Yea.
7012. To what do you mainly attribute that? To too many boats being at work.
7013. And to constant working ? Yes.
7014. Do you know anything about pearling grounds in any other part of the world ? I have worked in
the Solomon Islands, at New Guinea, and the Aroe Islands.
7015. At the Aroes are boats allowed to fish all the year round? No. 1 went there in the schooner
“ Elsie,” and we dropped on the shell and got 14 cwt. in four hours. Then they came out and ordered
us away.
7016. Do you know whether they have any regulation or law providing that the beds must not be worked
at certain seasons of the year ? Ido not know.
7017. Is there any season during which the weather absolutely prevents the beds being worked? Yes,
Very often the water gets stirred up, and you cannot see to work.

7018. Can they work in the north-west season ? We were only there a rery short time, so that I had
not much experience. We had very clear water while I was there.
7019. When were you at the Aroe Islands ? We webt there in 1890. We were prospecting over at New
Guinea, and were away eleven months altogether.
7020. When a diver is on the bottom can he tell the difference between shell that measures (i inches and
shell that measures 5 inches ? Tou cannot tell exactly unless you measure them.
7021. But can you tell whether it is a small shell or a shell that you can bring up ? Tcs.
7022. Would the young shell be in the same position on the bottom as 7-inch or 8-inch shell ? Yes.
7020. Do not the young shell stand up ? It all depends on the ground. In places they are almost
buried, and you can see just the lip sticking out. On the Old Ground you can see the shell a long way.
7021. Do you know what size shell are when the byssus becomes detached from the bottom? They are
very young. I have seen shell about the size of a half-crown lying loose. Then again, very often small
shell is fastened to the bottom.
7025. From what you know of the grounds now and the amount of shell available, do you think that
white divers at the present time could make enough money to induce them to come and stay hero ? Ido
not think there will be sufficient inducement for them to come for some time yet, until the grounds have
had a spell.
7020. You consider the grounds should have a spell to allow' them to recover their former richness? Yes.
7027. Can you indicate any grounds which could bo effectively closed by patrolling or some other means ?
I should think the Old Ground would be the best to close. It is the best feeding-ground there is.
7028. But do you think it could be effectively patrolled ? Yes.
7029. What means would you suggest for patrolling it ? Just send a boat out. You need not have it
patrolling continually. It could run out once a week, or once a fortnight. You can see boats for miles
on the Old Ground.
7030. What kind of a vessel do you consider would he required for the purpose ? An ordinary sailing
boat.
7031. Do you consider a steamer would be necessary ? A steamer would bo all the better. It w r ould
enable you to get up to any boats quicker.
7032. Do you think Endeavour Strait could be effectively closed? There would bo no difficulty at all in
closing that.
7033. Could it be kept closed by means of a small vessel worked from a station in Endeavour Strait ?
Yes. With a station on some central island, you could control the whole Strait.
7031. Can you suggest an island that would be suitable ? I should think that one of the Woody Islands
would do.
7035. Is there water there ? I could not say.
7036. What about Bed Island ? Red Island -would do, but you cannot see the eastern end of the Strait
from there.
7037. At any rate you believe that a station could be established at Little Woody ? Yes ; or at Entrance
Island, which commands a pretty good view' of both ends of the Strait.
7038. By the Chairman : If the Government employed a biologist to inquire into the cultivation of the
pearl oyster, do you think that would help the industry ? I cannot say.
7039. By Mr. Bennett : You have been engaged a considerable time in looking after the aboriginals ?
Yes.
7010. What work are the mainland aboriginals mostly engaged in ? Gathering up beche-de-mer on the
reefs.
7011. Are any of them engaged in swimming diving for pearl-shell ? Yes, a few.
7012. From what place are aboriginals mostly recruited for beche-de-mer fishing and pearl-shelling ?
Between the Seven Rivers and Barrow Point.
7013. There is no recruiting further south ? Very few arc got further south, though you might get an
odd one from Cooktown. . .
7011. Arc the aboriginals available for w'ork in those two industries iucreasiug or decreasing?
Decreasing.
7015. Fast ? Pretty rapidly.
7016. AFhat is the decrease due to ? They seem to die out very fast, but Ido not know what the cause
of it is. Year after, year I notice that the numbers at the different camps are less.
7017. By whom are the aboriginals mostly employed now ? By Japanese.
7018. That is, the boats on which they are employed are sailed by Japanese ? Yes.
7019. Are the owners of the boats J apauese ? No ; but we cannot get hold of that information.
7050. As far as you know, the owners of the boats are mostly Europeans ? Yes.
7051 A 7 ery few of the Japanese own any boats ? That is so —only four or five that I know of.
7052 So far as the licenses and articles disclose, the boats are owned by Europeans ? Yes.
7053 Do you know what is the condition of the reefs on which beche-de-mer is mostly got at the present
time ? The boats are all flocking down to the reefs off Bowen and Mackay at the present time, and the
reefs there are rapidly becoming skinned.
7054 Have you been down to those reefs ? Yes ; I was there last year.
7055 Do you not consider that the employment of aboriginals as far south as Mackay is rather severe on
them from a health point of view ? Yes ; the boys complain that it is too cold to work there.
7056 Are Papuans also employed down there ? Yes ; several boats down there have Papuans.
7057! Do the Papuans prefer that place to the Strait ? No ; they prefer the Strait.
7058. Do they complain of the cold? I think so. , . , . . . ,
"0 r 9 From your own knowledge, do you consider that the recruiting of aboriginals is earned on in
accordance with the provisions of the Aboriginals Protection Act ? Yes, it is now ; there is very little
■,Vr . rccruitim? going on at the present time. A few little boats which come off the mainland get a boy
r two occasionally, and, after doing a little fishing, return them to their homes.
-060 Is the returning of the boys carried out to your satisfaction ? Yes.
'-uri As Protector you are charged with the supervision of that work ? Yes. AFhen I board a boat, I
■ k tii an in charge for his papers, and, when I see that the papers are in order, the crew arc mustered
ask tno m er to their names. Then I ask if the crew have any complaint to make. Then I inspect the
boat below and satisfy myself that all is right.


J. H.
Schluter.
2 July, 1908.
7062. Do you think the beche-de-mer industry will be able to draw its supply of labour from aboriginals
outside the reserve for a much longer period ? There is hardly a sufficient supply.
7063. As the population is decreasing, we may assume that such labour will not be available much longer?
People will not be able to man their boats.
7064. Do you think the industry is one suitable for white men to engage in as owners of boats, or as
masters and mates ? Yes; as masters and mates they could engage in it, but white men would not do the
work on the reefs.
7065. Have you known a great many white men who have been engaged in the beche-de-mer fishery ? A
good few.
7066. You have never engaged in the industry yourself, have you? No.
7067. Do you know if any of the men you refer to have done really well and have continued to do well ?
Yes, one or two. Alec. Mathieson is one.
7068. Have the majority of those men done well ? No; only some of them. At Port Douglas Moynihan
and Andreassen are doing fairly well.
7069. In spite of the Japanese competition ? Yes.
7070. Have you any idea how long it takes a reef to recuperate after it has been skinned offish ? I think
it takes a very long time, because all the reefs that I know north of Cooktown had plenty of fish on them
at one time, but were skinned, and, though they have not been worked for years, there is very little fish
on them still.
7071. By the Chairman : Have you ever known the natives to fish for beche-de-mer by moonlight ? No.
7072. By Mr. Bennett : Ido not suppose the aboriginals would fish by moonlight? No ; they would not.
7073. Por the efficient working of the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries, do you think it would be
an improvement to divide the Act into two distinct parts ? Ido not see that any benefit would accrue
from that.
7074. Are you familiar with the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Pishery Act ? Yes.
7075. You know' that right through all the Acts the two fisheries are treated as one? Yes.
7076. The conditions of the two fisheries are entirely different, are they not? Yes. There is a big
difference between beche-de-mer fishing and pearl-shelling.
7077. Having regard to the difference between the conditions of the two fisheries, do you not think
that it would be advantageous to have distinct legislation for each fishery ? I cannot see where the
benefit would come in.
7078. Is it a fact that the Japanese can recruit aboriginals more readily than white men ? Yes.
7079. "What is the reason for that? I think rum has a good deal to do with it.
7080. Do you think the Japanese give the aboriginals spirits ? Yes. In fact the boys have told me so.
I have asked them on several occasions.
7081. By the Chairman : Have you ever seen Japanese giving them rum? No; they are wise enough
not to let me see them.
7082. By Mr. Bennett: Have you ever seen a camp in a state of “ spree ” after Japanese have been
there? Yes. At the Pascoe Eiver on one occasion there was a boat—it was the “ Nancy,” if I
remember aright—and a Japanese by the name of Goichi went there to recruit some boys, and he took
several cases of spirits ashore.
7083. Do you know that he took them ashore ? I go by what the boys told me, and by the effect on
them afterwards.
7084. You know that he had been ashore ? Yes.
7085. Did you see the boat either then or shortly afterwards ? I saw it shortly after it left there.
7086. Had it Pascoe Eiver men on board? Yes. He went to Eestoration Island. He also took four
women—the pick of the camp.
7087. Was it not your duty to stop him taking women ? He had not the women when I saw him. He
took the women from Eestoration Island over to Porbos Island, and left them there. I found them
there a month or six weeks after he had been there, as near as I could gather. He went out to the
Barrier Eeef, and when he came in again he had a great old time.
7088. Did he establish a camp at Porbes Island ? No; he merely dumped them down on the island.
7089. Did he leave them any tucker ? Only flour.
7090. When you landed at the Pascoe Eiver after this boat had left, what state of affairs did you find ?
I arrived off the Pascoe, and after a lot of persuasion some of the boys came off. They were not sober
then. They told me that this Japanese had made everybody in the camp drunk, and that he had carried
four women away to the boat. 1 took the statement for what it was worth, as 1 could hardly believe it. I
asked where he took them to, and they said he had taken them to Eestoration Island. I went there, but
he had flown from there. I met Pred Lancaster on the reef off Forbes Island, and his boys told me that
they had seen a fire on Forbes Island, and they thought the Japanese was likely to be there. I went
over, but could not find him, and then Lancaster and his boys came over, and the boys found the women
for me, and I took them to their own camp, and then reported the matter.
7091. Is that Japanese allowed to recruit now? No. He is not allowed to be engaged on any boat on
which aboriginals are employed.
7092. By the Chairman : Does not drink inflame them, and lead them to make murderous attacks ? They
seem to get very wild and cheeky when they get liquor.
7093. By Mr. Bennett-. Do they not get pugnacious, too, among themselves? Yes.
7094. By the Chairman : Would not the Japanese risk their lives in giving them liquor like that ? They
will do anything so long as they get the boys.
7095. By Mr. Bennett: How long was it after the Japanese had been there that you found them in the
state you mention ? The day after he was there.
7096. So that he must have left a little liquor behind? Yes. I came up to Thursday Island, and all this
time those four women were ashore on Porbes Island. I asked them why they went in the boat, and
they said, “He been carry me.” I said “ You drunk, too ?” One owned up that she was drunk, but the
others said they were not; and they told me that the men were fighting all the time.
7097. Apart from this case which came directly under your notice, have you reason to believe that other
Japanese give liquor to the natives ? I firmly believe they do, although I have never caught them at it. The
boys do not make any secret of it after the Japanese leave. They will not tell you anything at the time r
but afterwards they will tell you that the Japanese have given them plenty of rum.


J. H.
Schluter.
2 July, 1908.
7098. Do the Japanese give them liquor while they are working on the boats ? From what the natives
have told me, I believe they do. In fact, not long ago I saw a whole boat’s crow drunk, and I have seen
a Japanese taking beer from a public-house to the boat in a billy-can. Of course he would not let me
see him giving it to the boys.
7099. Have you ever searched the boats ? I have, but never found more than the two gallons- they are
allowed to carry; but they might have had some hidden among the ballast.
7100. Have you ever searched in the tanks or the water casks? No, just in the cabins, bunks, and
lockers. I have only myself and two blackboys when I go on board. I have to leave the other white
men in charge of my boat.
7101. Have you some white men with you ? Tes, two. If the boats are under sail, I have to get up
with them and make them heave-to. If they are anchored, of course I can take the other men
with me.
7102. Is there any section in the Pearl Shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act which gives you power to
order a boat to heave-to by signal ? No.
7103. Is not that necessary ? It would be a good thing. Very often they ignore the flag, and swear
afterwards—although they are only a quarter of a mile away—that they never saw the flag.
7101. Ton have a difficulty, if you think a breach of the Act has been committed, in getting them in
before a magistrate ? Tes ; but I use a bit of bluff. I simply tell them they must come.
7105. Tou know that the Act gives you power to take any boat, with her master and crew, before a
magistrate ? Tes.
710(5. AVould you be able to do that, say half-way between here and Cooktown, supposing-the master
would not go ? I could do nothing.
7107. If a man declines to go, you are powerless ? Tes.
7108. Tou have not got a crew which will enable you to put a prize crew on board? No. When I
find a boat is in fault, I simply bluff them by telling them that they must go to Thursday Island or Cook-
town ; and, as a rule, it works.
7109. In any future legislation, would it not be advisable to insert a section giving you power to order
such a man, in writing under your hand, to proceed to a port, there to appear before a magistrate ? That
would be of great assistance.
7110. That writing should have the force of a summons ? Tes.
7111. That would be of advantage to any person administering the Act ? Certainly.

Captain J. MACK AT, ( Chairman ) | Me. H. A. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Feank Lascelles Jaedine, Grazier and Ex-Pearl Sheller, examined :
7112. By the Chairman : What are you ? A grazier, at present residing at Somerset.
7113. How long have you been at Somerset ? Forty-four years.
7114. During that time you have been familiar with the pearl-shell industry ? Tes.
7115. For how many years were you engaged in the industry ? About twenty years—from 1872 to
1892. ' ■ ■
7110. How many boats on the average had you engaged in the industry ? Nine.
7117. Were they pump boats ? Four were pump boats, and the others swimming diving boats.
7118. Have you ever worked under the floating station system ? No.
7119. Do you think that working by the floating station system tends to undue depletion of the beds ? I
think it is the only system that is workable in the Strait, because, unless there is a floating station, small
boats cannot be out at sea on the Old Ground. Of course, small boats can fish all round the islands, but
40 miles out they must have a floating station to go to, as they cannot be running in and out all the time;
if they were, there would be no time for diving.
7120. Tou mean that floating stations are necessary to develop the outer shell areas away from the
islands? Tes. . . . ,. , ... „
7121 Of course you are familiar with the conditions ot the pearl-diver s iite t xes. •
7122. Do you think it possible (hat the work of diving can be carried on by white men ? And white crews ?
7123. No—white divers and white tenders ? Tes, it is possible.
7124. From your own experience, can you suggest any means by which the industry can be made more
attractive and more remunerative to white men? No, I cannot. .
7125. Do you think the industry is sufficiently attractive already ? I think it is sufficiently unattractive.
7126 What do you mean by being unattractive ? The work is too monotonous. A white man can do it,
but he will not stick at it day after day. A diver’s life is worse than life on a deep-sea voyage.
7127 Still deep-sea voyages have to be prosecuted ? Yes. So has diving, but white men will not lead
lifo Tf thev are hard no and want to make a little money, they will go at the work for a short time,
but thev wilS stick to it. P If a white man will stick at it he is a blackfellow
7128 ton might as well include miners and bushmen in that category ? No—a miner works for
himself
jlT \Vell suppose the industry is made attractive enough to induce a white man to work for himself ?
Deep-sea diving will never be an attractive life for a white man.
71 or) Because thelifo is monotonous. Yes. t
7131' Is there anything more monotonous than a bushman s lite m Australia ? A bushman has not to
get into a helmet every day and knock about the bottom of the sea, where he cannot see; and he can
get a night’s rest.

3July^l9oB^’
7132. You know the exigencies of a backwoodsman’s life? Yes; and that is the reason why I can
speak definitely on this subject.
7133. Is not the possibility of becoming wealthy by finding pearls as great an incentive to a man as the
possibility of becoming wealthy by finding gold in New Guinea? No. There are very few pearls for
them to get, and there is too ranch expense connected with the getting of the pearls.
7134. Do you really think that the industry cannot be made attractive to the white man ? I do.
7135. Do you think that, if a marine biologist were appointed to assist in the cultivation of the pearl
industry, that would aid in the development of the industry? We have had several of those savants and
they have not done any good.
7136. Have they had an opportunity of doing anything ? They have had the opportunity, but the
Government did not take advantage of that opportunity, and they never published the results of the
work done.
7137. Do you not think that the industry would be improved by the aid of a scientist? Ido not
think an ignorant man could take up a cultivation area and run it.
7138. lam referring to a marine biologist ? 1 suppose a marine biologist would give people a start.
7130. Do you think the appointment of such an expert would be advantageous to the industry ? Yes.
7140. Suppose that some international development took place, and, as a result, the Japanese were
suddenly called away from Torres Strait, do you for one moment think that the wealth in pearl-shell
lying at the bottom of the sea would be allowed to lie there ? Ido not.
7141. Would not owners of boats get other employees ? I suppose they would get other divers. In the
early days we had a different stamp of men from those now obtainable.
7142. There were no aliens employed when you first engaged in the industry ? No.
7143. What the Anglo-Saxon has done once he can do again ? Yes ; but, as I have said, white men will
not stop at the work.
7144. You are referring to divers working for wages ? lam referring to divers having shares in boats
and working boats for themselves. White divers were the people who first broke in coloured divers. I
hod five white divers in my employ.
7145. Do you think that, if the Government provided a vessel for the purpose of training young white
men as divers, that would be conducive to the development of the industry ? I dare say that would be
an incentive, if you could get able young fellows who would take up the work.
7146. Do you think it would be an incentive to Scandinavians to engage in the industry? Yes; I think
Scandinavians would engage in it.
7147. The work would be a holiday to people who are inured to fishing life in the North Sea compared
to the work they do now ? Yes. It is not really hard work, but it is fearfully monotonous.
7148. But when men are working for themselves they will not become slaves and work day and night?
If they do not work hard, they will not make anything.
7149. Do you think the pearl-shell beds are becoming depleted ? They are not becoming depleted, but,
having been fished for forty years, the shell is not increasing in quantity. There is, however, plenty of
ground which has not been touched yet, and which cannot be touched except with the aid of floating
stations.
7150. Do you know what number of boats are at present engaged in the industry? About 240, 1 think.
7151. No, there are 112 pump boats —Do you think that number is sutficient to secure profitable
employment in the present state of the beds ? They will not make very much, but they will make a
living.
7152. Would you recommend that that number be increased or decreased, or that it remain as it is ? 1
do not think it would pay to have more boats working than there are at present, unless the boats worked
from floating stations. The boats here now are sufficient to work the fishery under present conditions,
but there is any amount of ground which has not been touched.
7153. By Mr. Bennett-. Where is the ground which has not been touched ? Away out iu the Gulf, and
past Booby Island, away towards New Guinea. There is no doubt that this shell goes to Port Darwin
and to the Aroe Islands.
7154. Do you think diving can be successfully carried on beyond the 20-fathom contour ? No, not
beyond the 20-fathom contour; but from Deliverance Island to the southward there is plenty of shell-
ground.
7155. By the Chairman : There are several islands and reefs throughout the Strait on which men could
make homes for themselves ? Yes.
7156. If the industry was made more attractive by means of Government assistance and in other ways, do
you think white men, with their families, would be induced to settle on those islands? Certainly ; that
is the only way in which the industry can be made attractive.
7157. By establishing homes wherever the islands offer facilities for that purpose? Yes.
7158. You think the industry could be profitably worked in that way by white families? I think so ;
but a great deal would depend upon the size of the family. There will be a lot of non-workers, and for
some years the head of the family would have to keep everything going. Cultivation would be the only
way to keep the industry going.
7159. Do you think cultivation will bo a success? I have no doubt about it.
7160. That will be one obstacle overcome, will it not ? Yes.
7161. By Mr. Douglas : When Mr. Saville Kent came here in 1891 he suggested that the industry should
be carried on by means of cultivation ? • Yes.
7162. As the result of his recommendations, a Bill was passed by Parliament to enable leaseholds of the
foreshores to be taken up ? Yes.
7163. People do not seem to have taken up those areas readily—Can you give any reasons why that has
been the case ? There were too many restrictions, and the legislation was too illiberal. Mr. Saville
Kent’s company here had to find big security.
7164. By the Chairman : That is the present company ? Yes. They had a lot of bother over getting a
bit of a mudbank.
7165. By Mr. Douglas-. Is seven years a sufficiently long term of lease ? No.


7166. What term do you think should he given ? Twenty-one years at least —or make it ninety-nine -
years. As the profits increase on each area, the Government will derive a proportionate revenue.
7167. "With a view to carrying out Mr. Saville Kent’s recommendations, do you think it would be
advisable to close any of the foreshore areas, and afterwards allot them in the same way as land is thrown
open for selection ? They should be closed for three years. They were closed for three years before,'
but thev were not guarded.
7168. What areas should be closed with a view to getting people to take them up for cultivation purposes?
The whole of Endeavour Strait has always been a rich shell-bearing ground. It should bo closed, for
one area. It is moderately shallow water.
7169. By Mr. Bennett : It can be worked in most seasons ? Tes ; but you do not want men to work all
the year round. They want a rest, and they can have one in the north-west season.
7170. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that other areas, such as Mabuiag and Warrior Reef, should also
be closed? Ido not know about them. Ido not know what work has been going on lately ; but they
would be valuable grounds for cultivation.
7171. Does the shell in deep water areas throw off large quantities of spat, which goes in the direction of
the Old Ground ? Yes.
7172. It has been suggested by some witnesses that the deep water areas should be closed, and kept
closed, for the purpose of allowing the spat to be deposited on the other areas ? Of course spat will not
hold unless there is a suitable bottom ; it drifts away with the tide.
7173. Take the Darnley Island and Mount Adolphus grounds ? All the shallow grounds are spat-
bearing.
7174. There is a quantity of shell in deep water which the divers cannot get up, and the possibilities are
that a large quantity of spat will come from those places, and possibly arrive at maturity ? Yes ; but I
do not think the spat travels far.
7175. Have you any idea how long spat remains on the surface before it sinks ? No.
7176. You have engaged in experiments in cultivation? Yes ; but nothing worth relating.
7177. By Mr. Bennett-. Nothing which gave you any definite knowledge on the subject? No —just the
propagation of pearls. The company here are not cultivating the shell for the shell itself, but for pearls
only.
7178. By the Chairman: Does their work hold out any prospects of success ? Yes. It is turning out
very satisfactory.
7179. By Mr. Douglas: The tide runs swiftly in Endeavour Strait, does it not ? Yes, 5 knots.
7180. By Mr. Bennett-. Not in all parts ? No.
7181. By Mr. Douglas -. Has the current any tendency to sweep the spat away ? It sweeps it along the
coast.
7182. Would a place with a current like Endeavour Strait have the same recuperative powers as the
Old Ground, which is more or less calm water with a rotary current—Do you think any portion of the
Old Ground should be closed? 1 do not think it should be closed—at any rate, not for some time.
The Old Ground is naturally protected by bad weather and long grass in the north-west season.
7183. By Mr. Bennett -. The long grass in particular is a great protection to the shell ? Yes.
7184. The Old Ground also receives protection for a certain period during the south-east season, when
they cannot work on the ground? Yes ; for a large proportion of the year the Old Ground is unworkable.
7185. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that the Act of 1891 should be liberalised ? Yes.
7186. By the Chairman: You think that at present it is of no assistance at all ? None whatever.
Anything connected with Torres Strait has been treated with contempt.
7187. By Mr. Douglas: In connection with the cultivation work being carried on here, you think the
terms are severe? Yes, a great deal too severe.
7188. By the Chairman : The company had no difficulty in securing the lease ? They had a lot of trouble
over it. They had to enter into a heavy bond.
7189. The first application for the area on this side of the passage was approved of within a week; then
they applied for the land on the other side ? Yes.
7190. By Mr. Douglas: With a view to inducing people to take up cultivation areas, and to place the
poor man on an equality with the rich man, do you think that granting priority for personal residence
or putting up the areas to public auction would be the better system to adopt ? I think that priority
for residence should be the basis of allotment; most certainly not public auction, which would give the
poor man no chance against the rich man.
7191. By the Chairman : Would not the rich man have a better chance than the poor man under the system
of priority also —he might apply for a lot of areas ?I am not speaking of dummying, but of bond fide
occupation.
7192. By Mr. Douglas: You think that a man who lives on the property and develops it should be given
priority ? It is a thing that requires looking into. As soon as an application is sent in, you should find
out who and what the man is, and that should be taken into consideration ; but I most certainly would not
grant large areas to companies. The thing’is to secure settlement.
7193. What maximum area of foreshore should bo given to any one man ? Not more than one square
7194. Do you think that severe penalties should be imposed to prevent dummying ? I leave that to other
feople to say.
195. By Mr. Bennett: You do not consider that one person should be allowed to hold a number of
16E8GS ? NO.
7196. Your idea is to get as many people engaged in the cultivation business as possible ? That ought
to be the idea. ~ . ~ .
7197. By Mr. Douglas : If the conditions were made favourable, do you think it would be the means of
getting revenue for the Government from this national wealth ? That is where the shoe pinches.
7198 Do you think a royalty should be paid on shell raised from these cultivation areas ? The leases
should be granted free to bond fide cultivators for two years. At the end of that time it should be
apparent whether it is going to be a success, and then a royalty could be paid on all proceeds.
7199 By the Chairman : Do you think a concession of that kind for two years would be sufficient ? I
think so The company working here is only engaged in working for pearls. When the shell arrives
at maturity the pearls will be taken out and the fish are killed. That shell will be sold.

• 7200. What time do you think it will take to mature pearls ? Two years.
, 7201. And of course the shell is increasing in size all the time ? Yes.
7202. By Mr. Douglas: I suppose you were one of the first to work on the Old Ground? I was among
the first.
7203. Can you give us any idea of the average annual catch of shell for your boats ? For two years it
was over 11 tons per boat.
7204. Did you have white divers then ? Yes.
7205. What was the price of shell then? £l2O a ton. The highest price I ever got was £304 a ton for
2 tons raised in Newcastle Bay by a swimming boat.
7206. What rates of pay were those white divers getting ? £2O a ton, and £l5 a mouth.
7207. £l5 a mouth in addition to the “ lay” ? In addition to the “ lay.”
7208. Then they were earning handsome wages ? Yes.
7209. They were earning between £4OO and £5OO a year ? Quite that.
7210. Had they any share in the pearls ? No ; they were mine.
7211. Did you get them ? Yes —a share of them.
7212. Even if the life were monotonous, do you not think a white man would go in for diving if he could
earn that amount ? That work was not monotonous. It was not deep-sea diving. They were working
just off the shore.
7213. You think the Queensland Government were to blame originally for allowing aliens to come in
and practically get a monopoly in diving ? Yes.
7214. Are we to infer from that that you think no divers’ or boat licenses should have been issued to
aliens ? Certainly.
7215. Those licenses should have been restricted to Europeans? Yes; they should not be allowed
licenses. Let them come as employees, not as employers.
7216. Do you think, if that had been done, Europeans w r ould have engaged in diving ? Yes. The
divers who were here would have stayed; but, as it was, the other men worked them out.
7217. By Mr Bennett : Coloured divers w r ere cheaper ? Yes.
7218. By Mr. Douglas: Would it be desirable to try to bring about a gradual change, without
interfering with existing interests, which would result in white divers engaging in the industry ? Most
certainly; but that is a very difficult problem.
7219. Do you know how many divers’ licenses there are at the present time? No.
7220. Official evidence given before the Commission shows that out of 165 divers’ licenses, 164 are held by
Japanese, the remaining license being held by a Malay—so that diving is practically a Japanese
monopoly ? Yes.
7221. By the Chairman : You do not think that is a desirable state of affairs? No.
7222. By Mr. Bennett: Apart from the Japanese question altogether, has it not been found in the past
that it is undesirable to have a preponderating number of one nationality as divers ? That is always the
case in small communities.
7223. Has that not been found to be a disadvantage in Torres Strait ? Yes.
7224. Where too many men of one nationality have been employed as divers, it has been harder for the
owners ? Yes; the owners had to put men of one nationality in the same boat, and naturally they did
not like to have too many men of one nationality on their station or ship.
7225. When men of a particular nationality found themselves sufficiently numerous to exercise a
controlling influence, did they not exercise that influence on more than one occasion ? They resented the
introduction of other races. That was what the fights were about.
7226. By Mr. Douglas : You went as a Special Commissioner to Burmah some years ago ? Yes.
7227. Have you been in touch with their methods of working the pearl-shell industry since then ? No.
7228. Do they close down those fisheries ? No ; they are fished by Chinese; they do not have Europeans.
7229. Was the shell obtained there similar to our pearl-shell ? It was called gold-lip. The take of
pearls was about equal in value to the take of shell. I can show you the report 1 made on that fishery.
7230. "Will you hand in that report for the information of the Commission ? Yes. [Document
produced .]
7231. Did you suggest in your answers to the Chairman that it would be advisable for the Government to
undertake scientific research in regard to the pearl-oyster for the benefit of the public generally ? There
are two answers to that question. Such investigations are necessary for people who are ignorant of the
habits of the oyster, but not for others.
7232. Very little information has been made public in regard to the catching of spat and bringing the shell
to maturity, and the names of the different varieties of pearl-oyster ? That is so.
7233. It is hardly likely that one person, or one body of persons, would go to the enormous expense
which such research would involve, when the result would probably be for the general benefit, owing to
the fact that the spat drifts from one ground to another ? The shell on a ground breeds sufficient spat
to stock that ground. The company who are carrying on operations in Albany Passage are not
introducing spat. They are introducing shell, and that shell throws the spat which stocks the ground.
7234. A great percentage of the spat of the pearl oyster is lost ? Devoured by fish, and swept away by
the current.
7235. I think Mr. Saville Kent, Mr. Pace, and Mr. Tosh say that only about one in a million of spat
comes to maturity ? Yes.
7236. Mr. Tosh or Mr. Pace suggested that if some method of catching the spat in its early stages were
adopted that might result in 70 percent, being saved instead of one in a million as at present —If some
institution were established on the basis of the agricultural colleges for the purpose of demonstrating
that, would it not be an advantage to the public ? Yes; it would be an advantage to have a marine
biologist.
7237. Pearl-shell being a luxury, one of the chief considerations in connection with it is to reduce the
cost of production ? Yes.
7238. Do you think cultivation will tend to reduce the cost of production ? I think it will ultimately.
7239. Assuming that a biological station is established, do you think that, with a view to the gradual
introduction of white divers, it would be desirable to have in conjunction with such an institution a
school in which young men would be taught diving and be enabled to get some experience on the grounds?
Qf course if you can get young white men to take up this work, they must be taught somewhere.


F. L. Jardine.
3 July, 1908.
7240. A training school would be an assistance ? I think so.
7241. By Mr. Bennett : In addition to the training received at a school they would require to gain experi-
ence in the actual working of the ground, would they not? Tes. The training ship would give them
rudimentary knowledge ; practice would do the rest.
7242. Which grounds were first worked about here ? Warrior Beef.
7248. Afterwards ? Newcastle Bay.
7244. And then ? Mabuiag and Orman Beef.
7245. The Prince of Wales group was also worked, was it not? Later.
7246. In addition to Endeavour Strait do you think the channels around the Prince of Wales group afford
facilities for cultivation ? The whole of Endeavour Strait, taking the Jardine Eiver as the southern
boundary on the coast.
7247. But would not such passages in the Prince of Wales group as Friday Island Passage, Aplin
Pass, and others, be suitable for cultivation, too ? Tes. I do not know about Aplin Pass; but the
Boat Channel would be suitable. That and Friday Island Passage were originally rich in shell, and a
great lot of shell was got off Scott Bock.
7248. There are many other places besides Endeavour Strait which might bo used? Tes; such as Mua
and Badu—all rich shelling grounds originally. As the demand for areas increased, there would be any
amount of ground available for the purpose.
7249. Tou think there is ample ground to give employment to a large number of white people ? 1
think so.
7250. What would be the shortest period in which people might look for a return from cultivation ?
Three years.
7251. Do you think they could get a return as soon as that ? Tes, if it is going to succeed at all.
7252. Leaving pearls out of consideration, what do you consider the most profitable size at which to take
up shell ? The shell for which I got £305 a ton averaged a little over 5 lb. a shell. Shell that will
average 2\ lb. is the most valuable, if it is taken from clean ground. It is not so much a question of the
size of the shell as of the nature of the bottom from which the shell is taken.
7253. In fact, it is a question of the quality of the shell ? Yes. Mount Adolphus shell is bad shell, filled
with purple blemishes and blisters.
7254. How long would it take a shell to attain the most profitable size from spat. Three years.
7255. What would be the diameter of the nacre in such a shell ? Seven to 8 inches.
7256. Have you any data to adduce in support of your opinion? No, except from small shell laid down
here. In three years they were marketable.
7257. AVhat size were they when they were put down ? None of them was under 7 inches over all.
The nacre of such a shell would measure about 5| inches.
7258. I presume that a person engaging iq cultivation would require some capital ? Most certainly.
7259. AVhat capital would bo required by a person taking up an area of one square mile ? I could hardly
say.
7260. AVhat work would it be necessary to do ? Tou would have to stock the ground with young shell
to start with.
7261. Tou contemplate stocking the area with young shell? Tes ; not with spat.
7262. That shell would have to be raised elsewhere and transferred to the area ? Tes.
7263. For that a boat, diver, and crew would be required? Tes. The divers you are going to break in
could get it for you.
7264. AVas 11 tons per boat the highest you ever got? Tes.
7265. AVas that average maintained for long ? No. For some years it was not less than'9 tons. That
was the average all the time I was at Naghir.
7266. AVhat was your average when you left the industry ? It dropped down to 5 tons.
7267. Then, on the whole, the supply of shell on the inshore beds was decreasing? Tes.
7268. Fairly fast ? Tes. There were enormous quantities of shell taken off at first.
7269. AVhat class of divers were you employing when you stopped shelling ? South Sea Islanders—
principally Baratongans—and Manila men.
7270. AVere they as satisfactory as the white divers? That is a question I cannot answer, because when
I had white divers shell was at its zenith, and it had fallen off when I was employing these others, so
that it is not fair to make a comparison ; but the coloured divers were more easily managed. There was
not the drunkenness and trouble and bother with them that there was with the white men.
7271. Has not drunkenness always been a trouble in Torres Strait with all classes of divers ? That is
only a minor trouble.
7272. By Mr. JDouylas : It is no more troublesome with divers than it is on a mining field ? No ; it is
only a secondary consideration. A man can get drunk on Saturday and Sunday if he will get plenty of
shell during the week.
7273. By Mr. Bennett : How many years have you been out of the industry ? I forget.
7274. Do you consider that the raising of shell under 6 inches, 'nacre measurement, is detrimental or
otherwise to the industry ? It is detrimental.
7275. AVhat should be the smallest size for exportable shell? Either 6 inches or no limit at all.
7276. AVhat is your reason for saying “no limit” ? Six-inch shell may measure 7i inches over all, and
that shell has to be opened to measure the nacre, thereby killing the fish. As people caught with shell
under the limit in their possession are liable to prosecution, such shell is thrown overboard ; whereas it
should be sent to market. Men will not gather small shell wilfully.
7277. Not for the pearls ? Ido not think pearls reach maturity in 4-inch shell.
7278. AVhat is the size of shell in which you may expect to find the finest pearls? Very old, large,
rugged, worm-eaten shell.
7279. Has not experience taught you that pearls are mostly found in shell taken from the vicinity of
reefs ? Tes. The Old Ground is poor pearl ground. Many divers fish in this neighbourhood—
at Long Island and other places —although the take of shell is small, because the take of pearls is great.
7280. \Ve have been told that divers will raise and open shell under 5 inches on the off-chance of
finding pearls—ls that likely? They will open such shell, and the worst is that the shell is then thrown
away.


F. L. Jardine.
e. 7251. Do you not think that raising small shell tends greatly to impoverish the fishery ? Yes ; but not
Nj so much as taking the large shell.
i. 7282. Why ? Because the large shell spat, and the young ones do not.
7283. But if. the small shell are not allowed to come to maturity, the supply of large shell must be
diminished ? Eventually.
7281. Consequently the fishery will be impoverished ? Yes; but Ido not think divers take up the very
small shell now.
7285. In your experience, divers were not encouraged to bring in small shell ? No. At one time we
paid so much per shell, and the agreement was that the shell were not to be under 2 lb. in weight, so that
shell under that weight would not count.
7280. Can you suggest any means by which the closure of Endeavour Strait could be enforced ? It
would have to be guarded.
7287. What do you think would be the best means of guarding the place ? You would require a boat
on Possession Island or some other island.
7288. And a station ? Yes ;or else a long gun—a long gun for preference.
7289. You think a suitable vessel working from a base on one of the islands would be the best means of
enforcing closure ? Not a vessel —a boat. A vessel is too large.
7290. Not necessarily a steamer ? Not necessarily, but a steamer or launch for preference.
7291. Were you engaged in beche-de-mer fishing at one time P Yes.
7292. Had you many boats working in that industry ? Seven and a schooner.
7293. In what localities did you fish ? At Portlock lleef.
7294. That is outside the Barrier? Yes, outside Queensland jurisdiction.
7295. Did you work the Barrier at all ? A little to the southward of Murray Island.
729 G. Did you work for many years ? No. It does not pay with a big vessel. It will pay one boat manned
by a lot of niggers, but it will not pay a big vessel.
7297. Your experience of the beche-de-mer fishery is not of recent date? No.
7298. You have no knowledge of the present condition of the industry? No. I may say here that I
think there is as much chance of the pearl-shell industry being worked by white men as there is of the
Queensland Parliament being run by a black man.
7299. By the Chairman : You do not mean that remark to apply to the employment of white divers and
white tenders only ? No.
Bf.utie Bootee Aetiiue Lasceli.es Jaedine, Assistant Manager of the Natural Pearl-Shell
Cultivation Company, examined:
7300. By the Chairman- What are you? lam a member of the Australian Ornithologist Society, and
assistant confidential manager of the Natural Pearl-Shell Cultivation Company, London.
7301. You are at present in charge of the company’s beds under Mr. Saville Kent ? Yes. lam carrying
on researches in the artificial production of pearls, and in the propagation of pearl-shell.
7302. How long have you been engaged in the pearl-shell industry? I was born in the industry, and I
have been pretty well mixed up with it since I was twelve years of age. I have been interested in pearl-
shelling off and on for the last ten years.
7303. In what capacity were you employed? 1 first joined as a clerk on a pearling schooner. I stayed
at that work for about a year, after which I purchased a boat and went out and worked for myself.
7301. By Mr. Bennett • Swimming diving ? Yes.
7305. By the Chairman : Then we may infer that you are familiar with every phase of the industry ? I
think so. 1 Have had practical experience ; I have worked personally at swimming diving.
7300. By Mr. Douglas : Have you been down in the dress ? Yes, but I have never worked in the dress.
7307. By the Chairman : Are you familiar with a diver’s life ? I am.
7308. From what you have seen, do you think a white man could carry on diving? Yes, if he had
encouragement; but otherwise, no.
7309. If the conditions of the industry were improved? Yes —improved conditions—more money.
7310. Do you think that if sufficient inducement were offered white men would undertake diving ? I do,
allowing that we got the right kind of men.
7311. Can you suggest any means by which the industry may be made more attractive to white men ?
The only thing I can see is for the Government to give a bonus.
7312. If the Government called in the aid of a marine biologist, would that contribute to the success of
the industry ? Most certainly it would.
7313. Coupled with that,' do you think it would bo a good thing to have a school for the teaching of young
white men to dive ? Yes; that would be a good idea, but lam not altogether in favour of it.
7314. Do you think it desirable that 104 out of the 165 divers at present licensed should be Japanese?
No.
7315. How could that ho altered —You have said that scientific cultivation is possible ? lam very much
in favour of that.
7310. What is your objection to a school for divers ? It is a very difficult thing to teach men diving
unless the Government go to very great expense.
7317. We have had evidence from some old white divers to the effect that there is very little in learning
diving, but that men must become familiar with the nature of the bottom? There is very little in diving ;
but there is a lot to learn in regard to the finding of shell. Experience has to be gained.
7318. By Mr. Bennett: That experience must be gained by the men themselves ? Yes. It is impossible
to teach them that.
7319. By the Chairman : But every day would add to their knowledge of the bottom of the sea? I agree
with regard to the necessity for going down to the bottom and walking about for an hour or so. It
would be a good line for a school to be established to teach young men to do that. Then, later on, they
could learn by experience.
7320. By Mr. Douglas : You think the expense of keeping a training school continually on the
grounds would be hardly justifiable ? For the Government to do it properly the expense would be fairly
large; but if the men were just to be taught to dive the expense would not be too great, because they
might be taught in a smaller vessel than would be required for a permanent staff and students.
B. B. A. L.
Jardine.
3Ju1y,1908.


7321. By the Chairman : Perhaps it might be made self-supporting—a schooner of 50 or GO tons would
be large enough to board twenty divers ; and, as the students became experienced in diving, they could
raise a little shell ? Yes.
7322. By Mr. Douglas-. The system might bo much the same as that adopted in connection with the
Agricultural College ? Yes.
7323. By the Chairman : Then you are of opinion that scientific research and a school for divers would be
successful in developing the industry ? Yes ; although I have more faith in the cultivation of shell.
7324. How long is it since you commenced your researches in connection with the cultivation of shell ?
Twelve years. We really only began working here in Pobruary of this year.
7325. What results have you attained ? Of course wo could not go in for too much, because we had no
protection, and boats came here and camped on the place. When we got this area they anchored
here and disturbed our cages, and we had to take all our things over to the other side of the Pass to
Albany Island, where the conditions are not at all favourable.
7326. Was not that a matter of consideration for you before you applied for the lease? Yes. We did
not want the Pass, because it is too deep, but the reefs here suit our purpose ; but boats come and fish
for crayfish amongst the reefs.
7327. But you knew the conditions here when you applied for the lease? Yes; but wo expected
more protection than we got. The waters are not at all satisfactory, but the conditions are far worse.
7328. By Mr. Douglas-. Have you no power to prevent boats coming here ? None whatever. I got a
legal opinion on the subject the other day to the effect that if people trespass on our leasehold area we
cannot deal with them.
7329. If you could secure protection, do you consider your operations would be successful ? Yes, on one
condition.
7330. Have they been successful as far as you have gone ? Yes. We are very satisfied with the results,
and we now see a way of securing very good results from our spat catchers. We hope to be able to catch
from 30 to 50 per cent of the spat.
7331. Can you mention any disabilities under which you labour at the present time ? The Government
should give us liberal terms and a tenure of at least ten years.
7332. What is the length of your lease? Pive years. That is absurd.
7333. Do you think ten years would be sufficient? That is if the Government would give us the right
to renew the lease afterwards. It is really not sufficient, because the beds only become fertile about the
seventh year.
7334. Then what would you suggest as the minimum term of lease? I should say twenty-one years.
7335. In what respect do you think they should give more liberal terms ? They should make the rent a
little less stiff.
7336. During the whole term, or during the initial stages ? I think they should do it during the whole
term, and claim a certain percentage by way of royalty on the shell produced, or, as in our case, on the
shell and pearls.
7337. You think it would assist people if they had a long lease and had no rent to pay for a few years?
I do.
7938. Do you think that people could afford to pay rent after a few years, though they might not be able
to do so at the beginning ? I do. Under such conditions we should be able to work with satisfaction.
7339. Are there any other terms you would suggest? Yes. The most important of all is protection.
Without protection people will come here and prey upon our beds.
7340. What form of protection would you suggest ? Boats should be prevented from anchoring on the
beds.
7341. By Mr. Bennett : You think power should be given you to prevent that ? Yes. A boat should
not be allowed to anchor on a bed without first consulting the leaseholder, or the man in charge, and
getting a permit to anchor there for a day or night. A lot of damage may be done on a bed at night—
people could disturb things, and cause us a lot of trouble.
7342. You merely desire power to protect yourself from trespassers, the same as a leaseholder on land
can do ? Yes; because there are a lot of people in the Strait who I know are not very honest, and
unless we have some power of that kind those people will raid our beds.
7343. By Mr. Douglas : The company you are connected with are mainly concerned with the cultivation
of pearls ? They are at present, because our areas are too small to go in for propagation extensively. What
we would like is a larger area, so that we might go in for the propagation of the shell, as we see our way
clear to attain success in that line.
7344. What area have you at present ? The foreshore on both sides of Albany Passage, covering 2
miles. °
7345. By Mr. Bennett: That is a mile on each side ? Yes, a mile from point to point. Most of our water
is far too deep for our purposes, but it would do splendidly as a nursery. It is too small for a big stock
of shell, but we selected the place for a nursery with the view of securing a larger area later on.
7346. By Mr. Douglas : You have several spat catchers laid down ? Yes.
7347. By Mr. Bennett: Are they proving successful ? They are.
7348. Is the spat you collect the spat of the true pearl-shell oyster or the spat of the lingah ? There
may be one or two shell of the inferior sort, but the majority of the shell wo are obtaining is the
true pearl-shell, Meleagrina maxima. The Meleagrina margaritifera is a black shell. Meleagrina
maxima is the correct name of the true pearl-shell.
7319. By the Chairman-. Did you apply for a lease on the other side of Albany Island? Yes.
7350. Did you get that lease ? No.
7351. Why? Because we thought the terms were not enticing enough.
7352. From what you have learned up to the present with regard to the cultivation of shell, do you think
cultivation can be developed to such an extent as will enable several leaseholders to be supplied from one
nursery? I do.
7353. 1 mean if men took up areas in Torres Strait, would you be able to supply them with shell from
your cultivated stock ? We would be willing to give them every information—that is, outside the production
of pearls.

7354. If the Government employed a marine biologist, do you think young shell could be supplied to
leaseholders from one nursery ? I do ; but the best way would be not to establish one nursery, but to send
the biologist round to instruct leaseholders in the methods of cultivation.
7355. By Mr. Douglas-. What would you suggest as a maximum area for cultivation purposes? Not
more than 10 miles along any foreshore.
7356. Put it in the form of square miles ? That would be a mile out to sea, and 10 miles along the
shore.
7357. You think 10 miles should be the maximum area ? I do.
7358. Do you not think that is rather a large area ? It is a bit large. I think a very fair thing would be
5 miles, but under special circumstances a person should be allowed a little more. The average sheller
should be satisfied with a maximum of 5 miles.
7359. By Mr. Bennett -. In fixing that limit, have you regard to the quality of the areas as shell-producing
grounds in different localities ? Yes; I would give a smaller area where the ground is very productive,
and a larger area where it was less productive. Where the beds were fertile 2 miles would be plenty for
one person, but the average bottom about here is very patchy, so that, probably, there would be only a few
hundred square feet of good bottom in an area of 2 miles.
7360. Are you speaking of Endeavour Strait particularly ? No, of the coast generally.
7361. Do you think that an area of a square mile in a good locality would be sufficient to enable a man to
make a good living ? I do.
7362. By Mr. Douglas : Can you advance any proof for the statement that the Meleagrina magaritifera is
the black-lip shell ? The only proof I have is in recent circulars on conchology. Mr. Hedley, the
Conchologist of the Australian Museum, informed me that the true pearl-shell is the Meleagrina maxima,
and that the Meleagrina margaritifera is the black shell.
7363. Was the circular you referred to issued by the Sydney Museum authorities? Yes, by Mr.
Hedley.
7364. Does Mr. Saville Kent agree with that nomenclature ? Yes. I have a circular now that has been
written by Mr. Saville Kent. There was only one man on Thursday Island besides myself who knew
that the trne pearl-shell was not the margaritifera, and that was Mr. Mitchell, and he took every care to
keep the information to himself.
7365. Can you furnish the Commission with a copy of that circular ? Yes ; I will do so later on.
7366. By Mr. Bennett : If a person engaged in cultivating an area of 2 square miles, such as you
mention, would he require much capital to enable him to carry on until he got some return ? Not if he
had a fleer of boats to obtain shell to commence with. I think that one condition should bo that as soon
a man took up a cultivation area he should put down as many shell as possible to give the place a start.
After the third year he could begin to lift the shell he had laid down, and, of course, there would be
some small shell there. At present there are hundreds of shell thrown overboard, and a lot of it is
dead. They may be taken up in the morning and put on deck, and the diver does not sort the shell
until the evening, and the fish die from exposure to the sun. Then again, those that are under the
5-inch limit are opened on the off-chance of their being large enough, and they also are thrown overboard.
Under a system of cultivation, those shell could be planted on the cultivation areas, and in the course
of a couple of years they would be fit for the market. If they were left for a longer period, they would
become very good shell indeed.
7367. What sized shell, nacre measurement, do you think is the best for laying down ? The younger the
shell the better —from two years old to five years old.
7368. What is the size of two-year-old shell ? About 4 inches over all. That is, if the bottom is good,
otherwise it may be stunted and thicker. On a good bottom it would be 4 inches over all, or even larger.
7369. What would be the diameter of the nacre ? About 3 inches.
7370. What would be the best size at which to take up the shell that had been laid down ? Anything
over 6 inches, nacre measurement —nothing under.
7371. Do you know the difference in weight between an ordinary Old Ground 5-inch shell and an
ordinary 6-inch shell from the same place ? No; but it would be very small indeed.
7372. You consider that shell should not be raised under 6 inches nacre measurement ? That is in
cultivation areas. If shell are killed under 6 inches they are only sacrificed. In the course of another
year or two they wmuld be of good value.
7373. Have your researches revealed to you at what size the fish begin to spat ? They begin when they
are 5 inches in size, or even younger. I think 5-inch shell is the best for cultivation work, as they
become acclimatised, or have a better chance to become acclimatised, in the shoal waters than the older shell.
7374. By Mr. Douglas -. Do you speak of 5-inch nacre measurement or 5 inches over all ? Eive-inch
nacre. It wmuld be between four and six years old.
7375. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you find that the raising of young shell, which involves the breaking of the
byssus, tends to a heavy mortality among the shell ? Not at all. The byssus is a membrane that has no
stimulating power on the fish, and it can be re-formed in a few days, and the shell can become attached
in a few days after being laid down, if they wish it, when they are very young. Larger shell can become
attached within twenty-four hours, because the byssus is constantly growing, and detaching it causes
no irritation whatever.
7376. What fleet do you regard as necessary to carry on cultivation work ? I spoke of those who have
fleets already. Those commencing with a fleet would only require two boats at the most.
7377. Do you mean pump boats ? Yes. There is nothing in swimming diving now. There is no shell
worth speaking of in shoal water now, as the swimming boats have taken pretty well everything up. The
natives take small shell from 2to 5 inches as a delicacy. The pump boats are better rationed, and they
do not bother about lifting the small shell for food. They are nearly all natives that are employed in the
swimming boats, and they eat anything in the mollusc line.
7378. Then you consider that a large amount of destruction is done by the natives using the small pearl-
oysters for food ? Yes. At Red Island we have got as many as eighty shell a day, the majority of
which were always small. I always put the small ones aside. Once I put down about 300 near an island
off Cape York, and when I went there later I found that they were all destroyed, and when I went ashore
I saw some of the shells. Some swimming boats had come along and found them, and lifted as many as
they could find. Elsewhere I have seen them using the pearl-oyster in the same way as the ordinary
edible oyster —cooked, of course.

7379. By the Chairman : Has the young shell any enemies on the bottom ? It has numerous enemies.
That is where a scientist would be required as instructor in the cultivation branch of the work. With the
special catchers that we now have we have provided against these enemies, and we are now commencing
to get fair returns. At first we used the spat-catchers used for the edible oyster, but we found they
were no use in these waters. There are too many crabs and fishes that prey upon the spat; and to fight
against them we had to lift the spat-catchers off the bottom.
7380. Is there any analogy between the pearl-oyster and the edible oyster in regard to cultivation ? I
was speaking of southern waters, where crustacesc are not so numerous as they are here. The pearl-
oyster takes better on the rocks here, because the only crabs on the rocks are the common Neptwnus and
a rock-running crab. In the deeper water there are no less than five different species that prey upon the
spat. The toad fish also preys upon the spat and upon the young oysters. I have here a shell with a
pearl attached to show you what we are doing in the way of producing pearls artificially. This one
happened to die. The pearl, as you will notice, is about one-third of an inch in diameter, and is the result
of five months’ work. [Shell produced .] I have some photographs of other shells with pearls attached.
In twelve or eighteen months that would have been a perfect pearl. Wo have a certificate from pearl
experts in London, guaranteeing these to be true pearls. The certificate is in Mr. Milman’s hands, but
I think I have a duplicate.
7381. By Mr. Douglas: Is that a shell which you laid down when it was young ? It was very little
smaller than it is now. The nacre has grown a quarter of an inch only since it was laid down. It is a
very inferior shell, being of the yellow variety, and the nacre is very dull. We hope to make 50 per cent,
of the shell produce pearls like that or something better.
7382. By the Chairman : What value do you attach to that pearl ? I do-not know much about the value
of pearls, but Ido not think £5O would buy it, if it was matured. It is only a very young growth.
7383. By Mr. Douglas-. Can you produce pearls detached from the shell ? Tes. I hope to be able to
show you some detached as well as attached pearls at the company’s cultivation area.
7381. By Mr. Bennett: As an alternative to cultivation, do you think that closure must be resorted to if
the industry is to be preserved? Ido not think so. I think it should be provided that waters round a
township or settlement should not be leased to any man for cultivation purposes. The areas should be
cut up as evenly as possible, and away from settlements the areas should be large. Ido not believe in
closing the beds, because all our best beds are away out at sea, and I presume we have very little power
outside the 3-mile limit. Our best beds are outside that limit.
7385. Do you not think it would be advisable to close some areas within the 3-mile limit ? Ido not.
7386. What about the areas around Badu and Prince of Wales Islands ? You have named the largest of
the small beds. Most of the rich places are outside the 3-mile limit.
7387. When you say outside the 3-mile limit, I presume you mean to the westward of Goode Island and
Badu—you refer to the Old Ground particularly ? Yes, and to Yrilya Point.
7388. Do you think that deep-water areas like those round Mount Adolphus and Darnley Islands should
be closed as spat-producing areas ? Ido not.
7389. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that the whole of the beds inside the 3-milo limit might be reserved
for cultivation purposes ? I do. They might be closed without causing any inconvenience to the people
who already own boats.
7390. Those beds might be cut up into suitable blocks and offered for lease ? Yes,
7391. Bailing their being taken up, they should be left until they are selected ? Yes ; that would be a
very good idea.
[The Commission then adjourned in order to visit the cultivation area of the Natural Pearl-shell
Cultivation Company on Albany Island, where Mr. Jardine exhibited his spat-catchers, explaining the
method of working, and showing the young shell in various stages of growth. He also showed two living
pearl-oysters containing what appeared to be, on looking into the interior, an attached and a detached
pearl respectively, which he said were produced artificially in five months by a secret process discovered
by Mr. Saville Kent. On returning to Somerset, Mr. Jardine’s examination was resumed.]
7392. By Mr. Douglas-. Your company has a special spat-catcher which has proved successful ? Yes.
You have inspected it, and are in a position to draw your own conclusions regarding its success.
7393. I suppose you hardly feel disposed to say anything regarding the success or otherwise of your
company’s operations ? I would rather not, although our work in connection with the cultivation of shell
is not altogether a secret. We would not mind giving assistance in cultivation to others for a little
consideration.
7394. You require more protection against boats coming on to your leasehold ? Yes.
7395. Your company are now engaged in collecting shell and planting them on your leasehold ? Yes ;
we have put down about 2,000 since May.
7390. Can you tell us when the spatting season commences ? It begins in August and continues till
March ; but the best months are from November till March.
7397. You are about to extend your cultivation operations in a series of tanks that you have constructed on
shore, and which you afforded us an opportunity of inspecting ? Yes.
7398. By that means you hope to preserve the shell in its earlier stages from its natural enemies ? Yes.
Of the small shell which you saw in the spat-catcher the majority were the pearl-shell of commerce,
or Meleagrina maxima. Only a small percentage were the bastard shell.
7399. Are you of opinion that the deep-water areas produce the spat which replenishes the whole of the
beds of Torres Strait ? Not altogether. But what do you call deep water ?
7400. The deep water naturally has a larger quantity of shell, because of the difficulty in getting it ? A
percentage of the spat does get into the shoaler waters, and it has more chance of reaching the shell stage.
7401. You believe that the fish in the shallow waters produce sufficient spat to keep the beds there
stocked without assistance from the deep-water areas. Yes. I call anything under 10 fathoms shallow
water.
7402. So that, althougfh shell has become scarcer in Endeavour Strait through continuous fishing, you are
of opinion that sufficient spat is produced there to keep the beds stocked, provided the spat can be saved ?
Yes. If we had not put down any shell here, our spat-catchers would have something to show in the
way of shell; but I believe in encouraging the spat-catchers to catch spat by having shell placed close
about. One shell is capable of producing 1,000,000 young shell annually, if all the spat came to

maturity. Without scientific treatment, very few of that number ever develop into shell. With the
aid of cultivation, we hope to get from 25 to 50 per cent., at the least, to mature.
> 7408. Does shell thrive better lying on the round side or the flat side ? In the case of a slushy bottom,
if the shell were thrown on its round side it would stand a chance of being smothered when feeding by
the mud which lodges on the top side. It would also he apt to get a stone under the shell near the hinge,
which would cant the lip towards the air and caused the oyster to he smothered.
7404. Can you say, without divulging any secret information, what percentage of shell you expect to
produce pearls ? I think I can say with safety that 50 per cent, of the shell will hear something in the
shape of a pearl of some value—that is, in cases where the pearl is attached. There will probably be a
less percentage where the pearl is detached.
7405. Can you produce pearls attached or detached, as you wish? Yes, such as I exhibited to you
this afternoon at the cultivation ground.
7106. Have you got any photographs of pearls artifically produced P Yea. [ Two photographs produced.
Vide Appendix XlXi]
7407. With regard to attached pearls, can you produce them in a perfectly spherical form or pear-shaped,
as you may desire ? I have every hope that we shall be able to do so.
7408. The ones you showed us this afternoon appeared to be round? Yes; but we can produce them
almost any shape.
7400. Can you keep the fish working until the pearls attain a certain size ? Yes.
7410. AV ill the oyster eject a detached pearl when it becomes large? Probably it will, if the pearl
becomes too large. The pearl would then fall to the hinge, and become a blister.
7411. Does the artificial production of pearls have any deleterious effect on the oyster in regard to the
making of its nacre ? None whatever.
7412. By Mr. Bennett-. Are you certain that there is a stage of growth in the specimens of young
shell which you have produced at which you can determine the species to which they belong ? Yes. I
have no difficulty in determining the species of the two small shell which I showed you this afternoon.
7413. At w r hat size is the oyster best adapted for the artificial production of pearls? Between 4 and 8
inches, nacre measurement.
7414. What would be the respective ages of 4 and 8 inch shell ? Prom three to six years. I think 8-inch
shell will produce the best pearls.
7415. Do you know the deep water at Darnley ? I do.
7416. What prospect is there of spat from there reaching the western portions of Torres Strait ? A very
small prospect. There are numerous reefs about there over which it would be very difficult for the spat to
cross. Owing to the marine fauna of the reefs being very rich—I refer to crabs and other enemies of
the pearl oyster —there is very little chance of the spat from the Darnley grounds becoming established
outside that area.
7417. By Mr. Douglas : Do you think that the eastern coast of the Peninsula, as far south as Cooktown, is
suitable for the cultivation of the pearl oyster ? I know very little about that part of the coast, except
by travelling up and down in steamers.
7418. By Mr. Bennett : How far south from here do you know well ? Only to Turtle Island. About
there would be a splendid place for cultivation —one of the best. It is a rich bed as it is.
7419. The shell there is not of first quality, is it ? No. The bottom is of a muddy nature, which leads
to the softening of the shell.
7420. Besides which, fresh water comes in from the Kennedy Eiver at times ?• Yes.
7421. By Mr. Douglas : Is fresh water detrimental to the cultivation of the shell ? A big lot of it is. A
little fresh water is of some benefit.

TUESDAY, 7 JULY, 1908.
Present :
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Me. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
William Egbert Humphry's, Commission Agent, Shipping Merchant, and Beche-de-Mer Sheller,
examined:
7422. By the Chairman-. AVhat are you? Commission agent, shipping merchant, and beche-de-mer seller.
7423. How long have you been in Cooktown ? Thirty-two years.
7424. During that time have you been engaged in the capacities you have mentioned ? Yes.
7425. Are you largely interested in the beche-de-mer business ? It has been one of my particular lines
of business for the last twenty years.
7426. In what capacity were you engaged in the industry ? As seller, and sometimes as a backer.
7427. Were you interested in boats at all? Yes, at one time, but not of late years.
7428. I presume you are familiar with everything connected with the industry ? Pairly well.
7429. AVhat is the present condition of the industry? There is very little doing here now.
7430. Is it flourishing or otherwise ? Not among the whites.
7431. Is it flourishing with others ? I think it is flourishing with the Japanese, from Thursday Island
down.
7432. What is the greatest number of white men you have known to be engaged in the industry at one
time ? In Mr. Beardmore’s time there must have been at least a dozen schooners.of an average of 60 or
70 tons, and they employed a large number of men.
7433. I mean men working their own vessels? Yes; men like Alonzo AVebb, AVilson, and the
Underwoods.
7434. How many white men, approximately, were employed ? Nearly 100.
7435. About what time was that ? Prom 1880 to 1885.

7137. Did they make it pay ? No.
7138. For what reason ? I could not tell the reason, but they did not make it pay.
7139. Can you mention any white men who did make a success of the industry ? Alec Mathieson did ;
and two men are making a living out of it at the present time.
7110. Who are they ? D. Moynihan and Barney Andreassen.
7111. Is it your opinion that the industry cannot he carried on successfully hy white men? With the
assistance of black labour it can be. The men of the days I speak of were extravagant in their habits,
and they were generally backed by people on shore.
7112. Do you attribute their non-success to intemperate habits ? Yes; a great deal of it.
7413. Do you think a good white man could make a success of the industry with plenty of black labour
to assist him ? Yes, with plenty of aboriginal labour.
7111. You think it can be carried on by white labour, assisted by aboriginal labour ? Most decidedly.
7145. Do you know anything about the operations of the Japanese ? Very little, except just on shore,
when I have had to act as agent, shipping some of their crews for them.
7446. Can you say, from wbat you have heard from fishermen, whether the reefs are plentifully stocked
with fish? Not about here, but further south, on the reefs off Mackay and Rockhampton, I believe there
are plenty of fish.
7417. The price of beche-de-mer is very low at the present time ? Yes.
7418. What is it worth per ton? I sold some very fair teat fish yesterday for £9B per ton.
7119. What would that quality of fish have realised three or four years ago ? £l2O or £l3O per ton.
7450. What is the highest price that has been received here ? The highest price I have received is £250.
7451. What is the reason for the decline in price ? One reason is the large quantities which have been
going to Hong Kong from Thursday Island—large quantities of fish got by Japanese down south.
Another reason is the very low value of silver and the dulness of trade in China.
7452. If the industry was conserved for white men, do you think the employment would be attractive to
them ? I think so.
7453. Then you are in favour of prohibiting the Japanese from engaging in the industry ? If
possible.
7454. And you think the industry should be secured for our own people ? If possible.
7455. That is for white men, fishing with aboriginal labour ? Yes ; or even with New Guinea labour, if
you cannot procure aboriginal labour.
7456. How many boats are there at present out from Cooktown ? Not more than three. lam not quite
sure that there are three, but there are two; they belong to Tommy Ah Kum. Ido not think Antonio
has taken his license out this year, but he is thinking about taking a smoke-house away.
7457. By Mr. Douglas : There is practically no beche-de-mer coming into Cooktown from the reefs now ?
Very little.
7458. Are there any Japanese coming into Cooktown with their boats ? Yes —just one or two. Lately
I sold some fish for one from Thursday Island.
7459. Do they land their fish here ? No. The one I refer to landed because he wanted some provisions,
and Mr. Farquhar wired to me to sell the fish in Cooktown, owing to the low price obtainable at Thursday
Island.
7460. Borne time ago there was a restriction on the tonnage of vessels—every vessel of over 15 tons was
required to carry a certificated master—ls that so now ? It does not appear to be. They appear to be
granting licenses at Thursday Island.
7461. But it was not the case at Cooktown ? There have been no applications that I know of.
7462. lam not speaking of the immediate past, but of a couple of years ago, when the Japanese came down
here first ? I think Mr. Hoar could answer you better on that subject, because he had an experience of
that kind himself. I was not his agent.
7463. Is it your opinion that the reefs might be closed for some time, to allow them to stock up again ?
I have never heard that ventilated among the beche-de-mer men.
7464. With a view to Europeans taking up the work again, would you suggest that Japanese and all
other coloured aliens should be prohibited from employing aboriginals, in that way conserving the
industry for the whites ? I think that would most decidedly conserve the industry for white men, if it
could possibly be done.
7465. Are there plenty of aboriginals available for crews as compared with former years ? The
Japanese appear to be able to get very full crews as they come along. The white men were rather late in
coming forward this year, and they had a difficulty in obtaining crews. ‘
7166. There is very little known of the habits of the beche-de-mer by the men who fish for it ? Nothing
much. Did not Mr. Saville Kent make full inquiry some years ago ?
7167. I think he did —Practically there have been only two successful Europeans in the industry in your
experience ? About here at the present time.
7168. But there have been quite a number of white men who have made a living out of the industry in
past years ? Yes; but they are nearly all dead now, and Ido not remember any of them who died at all
rich. They nearly all died poor, and in difficulties.
7469. Could you make any suggestions that would enable the Commission to arrive at some conclusions
as to how the industry can be conserved ? There is one thing that would help the beche-de-mer industry,
and that is by having the law laid down so clearly that all the Protectors of Aboriginals would work it
in exactly the same way, instead of having the Protector at one port doing one thing, and the Protector
at another port doing another thing, as has been the case in the past. '
7470. Has any inconvenience been caused in the past by the Protectors at the different ports administering
the law in a different way ? Yes. Concessions have been granted at one port that have not been granted
at another.
7471. By the Chairman : Are you referring to the tonnage of vessels ? lam referring to persons being
allowed to take aboriginals outside the limits of the State.
7172. But that is illegal—That has not been tolerated? It has been tolerated. I daresay Mr. Wells
can give you some information on that subject.
7473. By Mr. Douglas : Has that been the practice ? It has been the practice. No aboriginals have
been taken outside the limits of the State by boats leaving this port, but I have seen the articles of some
Thursday Island boats where permission has been grauted to take aboriginals to New Guinea.


W. R.
Humphrys.
7July, 1908.
7474. Does that practice exist at the present time? No ; I believe it has been stopped. Still, it shows
that these things ought to be attended to, so that they will not occur in the future. I believe that at the
present time Japanese are fishing 150 or 200 miles out from Mackay.
7475. What is the present system by which employers obtain labour? They get permits from the
Protector of Aboriginals to recruit for a certain time ; then they bring their “ boys” into Cooktown.
7476. Where are most of the “boys” recruited who are working here? Prom here north to Cape
Grenville.'
7477. Could any improvement be made on that system, say by establishing a central depot to which boys
might be brought by the Government, and where they might be obtained by employers, and to which they
might be returned by the employers for return to their homes? 1 could hardly give an opinion upon
that. The aboriginal is such a funny individual.
7478. When employers go to a native camp, is it the custom to give them flour, calico, and tobacco ? Tes.
7479. A form of bribery ? Well, an inducement—it is not exactly bribery. Some natives will wait until
their old master comes back again, while others will not go back to their old master. You could scarcely
force them to go. If I wanted twenty natives, and the Government brought in that number, perhaps half
of those brought in might not want to go out with me. There is a difficulty in the matter.
7480. A person might lodge an application for six or twelve boys, and, instead of recruiting them himself,
the Government might bring that number to a central camp here where they might stay while awaiting
employment —would such a system as that assist the industry? I would rather allow some of the beche-
de-mer men to answer that question.
7481. You know that it has been suggested that such a station should be established at Lloyd Bay? Yes.
7482. lam referring to something on the same lines? It would be a very good idea to have a station
like that, if a man could recruit straight away and engage the men there.
7483. And go out to work at once, thereby saving time ? Yes; but not confine beche-de-mer men to
that particular system.
7484. You spoke of some Chinese owning boats here? Yes; at least he is the reputed owner.
7485. It is alleged that there is a system of dummying going on by which an alien, who is not qualified to
get a license himself, gets it through some other peison ? Of course, you can easily ascertain who holds
the license from the Customs.
7486. Is the whole of the beche-de-mer obtained here sold locally, or is it shipped to Hong Kong and other
places for sale ? Some comes in direct to the Chinamen. They buy the fish direct from the boat, and
supply stores in return. It all goes to Hong Kong, but all that comes from Queensland and New Guinea
waters is sold here.
7487. Was that the system when Alec Mathieson and other white men were working in the industry?
Yes, except in a few instances, when Burns, Philp, and Co. shipped the fish to Hong Kong for their
customers.
7488. Do you thiuk a limit should be placed on the number of vessels working in the beche-de-mer
industry? No.
7489. Do you think that any person wishing to work in the industry should be able to obtain a license ?
Yes, if he is qualified.
7490. Does the small quantity of fish now being obtained from the reefs in the vicinity of Cooktown
indicate that those beds have been over-fished? No; it indicates that nobody is fishing from here—
nobody has got any money.
7491. Prom what you have heard, do you think the supply of beche-de-mer on the reefs is as plentiful as
it was twenty years ago ? No.
7492. Would that not indicate that the reefs have been fished to a greater extent than they can stand,
and that they are not recuperating ? No. Of course there has been a good deal of fish taken off the
reefs of late years by the Japanese. They have gone south ; but there is no one fishing from Cooktown.
7493. By Mr. Bennett ; You have spoken about concessions being granted to aliens which are not granted
to Europeans —Can you indicate some of the concessions which are being granted? AVhich have been
granted —they have been stopped.
7494. So that aliens no longer receive any concessions ? I think not.
7495. Have you ever been out recruiting aboriginals ? No.
7496. So that anything you may say on that subject is merely what you have gathered from others ?
Yes.
7497. Are the vessels which are working out from Cooktown commanded by Europeans or aliens?
There are only two boats working out of Cooktown, and they are commanded by Japanese or Manila men.
I think one is commanded by a Samoan.
7498. When vessels were owned and worked by Europeans, were they all commanded by Europeans?
Yes, almost all; they might have had one foreigner among them.
Ernest Evanson, Ship-owner and Agent, examined;
7499. By the Chairman-. What are you? Ship-owner and agent.
7500. How long have you been in Cooktown? About eighteen years.
7501. During that time have you had anything to do with the beche-de-mer industry ? Yes.
7502. In what capacity ? As boat-owner and agent.
7503. Have you been in charge of a vessel yourself? No ; I have never been on the reefs myself.
7504. You have no practical knowledge of the way in which the industry is carried on ? No.
7505. Is the industry flourishing or otherwise at the present time? I cannot say how it is this year, but
last year was a very flourishing one for those boats which were managed by Japanese.
7506. Do you say that from your own experience ? No ; I did not have any boats out last year.
7507. You only know from hearsay that the Japanese were successful? Yes, only from hearsay, and
the quantity of fish I saw coming into this port from the different boats. Prom what I saw I concluded
that they had been successful. If the boats had been mine, I would have been satisfied with the catch.
7508. Are there any white men engaged in the industry from Cooktown at the present time. No.
7509. To what do you attribute that fact ? A European cannot recruit boys alongside a Japanese.
When a Japanese is recruiting boys in the north, a European has little or no show of getting any boys.
7510. Do you know that from your own knowledge ? Yes,
E. Evanson.

7511. Does the Japanese offer more attractions to the native than the white man? I cannot say honestly
what it is.
7512. There must be some reason ? There is some reason.
7513. You know what the aboriginal is—He will go with the man who offers him the best inducements ?
I think rum is the inducement with Japanese.
7514. Do you know from your own personal knowledge that rum has been offered to the aboriginals ?
Yes.
7615. Where? At every camp on the coast—Flinders, Barrow Point, and Starcke.
7510. Were you present when the Japanese were recruiting? Yes, on two or three occasions.
7517. Did the Japanese offer rum as an inducement on those occasions ? Bum was taken on shore.
7518. And given to the blacks? I should imagine so from the appearance of the blacks.
7519. Did you see the blacks in a drunken state afterwards? I saw the state they were in on one
occasion.
7520. Then you unhesitatingly assert that the great inducement offered to the aboriginal by the Japanese
employer is rum ? Yes, Ido undoubtedly.
7521. You are aware that the majority of boats at the present time are sailed by Japanese? Yes.
7522. As a citizen of Cooktown, do you think that is a desirable state of affairs ? Certainly not.
7523. From what you know of the industry, and of the profits accruing from it, do you think that, if
Japanese were prohibited from engaging in the industry it would become attractive to white men? I do.
7524. Do you think plenty of white men would be there to engage in the industry? I would not say they
would be there —you would have to find them.
7525. Do you think the monetary inducement would attract them? Yes. I would be willing to
undertake the work again at any time if the alien was prohibited.
7520. You have recruited labour for your own boats yourself ? Yes.
7527. Did you experience any trouble in recruiting aboriginals ? Yes, a great deal of trouble.
7528. From what? From the aboriginals themselves. I will not go into a camp and give the blacks
grog-
-7529. Do you assert that the white man is at a disadvantage in competing with the Japanese for
aboriginal labour ? At a great disadvantage.
7530. By reason of the fact that the Japanese supplies grog to the natives ? Yes.
7531. Have you ever reported that experience to the Protector of Aboriginals ? No, I have not, because
I was not in a position to carry the matter through the police court. I was inclined to report it, but there
were insurmountable difficulties in the way of making up a case. All the blacks would swear that they
had not got any liquor, and, if you reported such a matter, you would only make trouble for yourself.
7532. When did you have that experience? About two years ago.
7533. Do you think that kind of thing still continues ? I cannot say, but I believe it does still exist,
because Japanese boats cannot do anything without two or three gallons of rum on board. It does not
matter where they go, they must have rum with them.
7534. Have you heard whether the fish is abundant on the reefs at the present time ? I believe that the
reefs north of Cooktown are not in a very good state at the present time, but from what I understand of
the condition of the reefs south of Cooktown any man who could get a dozen boys and a small boat could
make a real good living in the industry.
7535. By Mr. Bennett : Even with fish at present prices ? Yes. The prices paid by Chinese are not the
present prices. This I was told by Mr. Flamsteed, manager of Burns, Philp and Co., who has forwarded
fish direct to China.
7536. Did he get a better price ? He gave me to understand that he did.
7537. By the Chairman : Do you think the depression in the beche-de-mer market is only local ? I
think so.
7538. Do you think there is any ring in connection with the purchase of the fish ? I would not say that,
but I imagine it. All these years we have had to depend on the Chinese as purchasers, and have never sent
any of it away ; but, from what the manager of Burns, Philp, and Co. told me, there is a better price paid
in China than is obtained locally.
7539. There must surely be some reason? I have had as much as £250 a ton for fish.
7540. And the same fish is now sold for £9O a ton ? Yes; although the production is much less now than
it was then.
7541. By Mr. Douglas: Is there an association of European beche-de-mer fishers ? Yes. lam president
of it in Cooktown.
7542. Is it a local association ? No; it comes from Cairns.
7543. It takes in other ports along the coast ? Yes.
7544. Are you president of the entire association ? No, only of the Cooktown branch.
7545. How many members are there in the association ? I really could not say. We have not had a
meeting here for nearly twelve months, but I think the association still exists. There were nine members
in Cooktown. I forget the date when they came here and held their meetings.
7546. Do you hold a master’s certificate? No ; but I have been sailing boats pretty well all my life, and
I am able to sail a boat up to 15 tons anywhere on the coast about here.
7547. Do you know of any concessions that were granted about the time the Japanese came to work the
reefs down here ? Yes.
7548. Were they granted any concessions allowing them to take charge of vessels of over 15 tons? Yes.
7549. Did that hamper the carrying on of the industry by Europeans? Most decidedly it did. I saw a
vessel of 20 tons go out of this port with a Japanese in charge, and the very next day a vessel of 18 tons
with a European in charge was debarred from going. It was most glaring.
7550. By the Chairman : But the Japanese had nothing to do with that prohibition? Well, their boat
was 20 tons.
7551. You know that now you can take out a vessel of 25 tons without a master’s certificate ? I could
not say, but anyhow their boat was allowed to go, and this other man was stopped the next day.
7552. That is not so now—Hoar’s was the first boat ? This Japanese went away while his case was
pending.
The Chairman : That is not so. He got permission from the Marine Board.
E.Evanson,
7 July, 1908.


E Evanson.
7 July, 1908.
7553. By Mr. Douglas: You say that the supply of beche-de-mer is not so plentiful in the vicinity of
Cooktown as it used to be ? Not north of Cooktown.
7551. Does that indicate that the reefs have been too closely fished? I could not say. I can quote the
case of a Eotumah man who came here the other day with a boat of about 6 tons with about £lOO
worth of fish for two months’ work.
7555. Did be get it north of Cooktown ? Yes. He only had five aboriginals on board.
7556. By the Chairman: Was the boat his own property? Yes; but he was notable to take out a
license himself. He had to get a half-breed from Thursday Island to take out the license.
7557. By Mr. Douglas: Would it benefit the industry ultimately, if certain reefs were closed against
fishing for some years ? Ido not think it would. I have heard people say they could not get fish on
certain reefs, and that they were worked right out; and I have known other people get three or four bags
off those very reefs. Apparently, in the warm weather the fish come out, so that it is hard to tell when
a reef is really fished out.
7558. Do you know how many vessels there are working on the reefs from here south ? I should say
there are at least fifty.
7559. Do you think some limit should be placed on the number of vessels working on the reefs ? I would
not advocate any limit.
7560. You would allow any number of boats to be employed ? Yes. The thing would eventually work
its own cure. They would" find it was not worth going on, and then the fishery would be closed. At
present the European does not know whether the reefs are fished out or not.
7561. By Mr. Bennett: How long is it since Europeans were engaged in the industry to any extent?
About seven years ago there might have been a dozen Europeans working out of Cooktown.
7562. Since then how many have there been ? The number has dwindled down lately until there is
nobody now.
7563. "Did coloured aliens come into the industry before or since the white man dropped out ? They have
really come in since then.
7564. Do you know whether the vessels that you speak of as Japanese are really owned by Japanese
or by Europeans ? I. could not say.
7565. You say that you cannot get a supply of aboriginals—Eor what do you employ them ? Carrying
cargo and in general shipping work.
7566. As crew ? Yes.
7567. And you are not able to get a sufficient number? Not of the best boys. The best boys are all
snapped up by the Japanese. Whether they give them better wages or not Ido not know.
7568. You are well acquainted with the aboriginal camps south of Cape Melville? Yes; for pretty well
all my life.
7569. Has the number of aboriginals at those camps increased or decreased ? I should say it has
decreased considerably, but not of late years.
7570. The decrease has been stayed to a certain extent ? Ten or twelve years ago a big fleet of pearlers
came from Thursday Island—some 100 or 150 boats —and disease was spread broadcast among the natives,
and they dropped off one by one.
7571. I suppose you refer to 1899 ? Somewhere about that time. I should not say that there has been
any great decrease during the last five years.
7572. Have you had any beche-de-mer vessels yourself ? Yes, three.
7573. Were they commanded by Europeans ? They were at one time ; but the Europeans died off one
after the other, and I was eventually compelled to take Japanese. There is one thing I would like to
mention—that the owners of these vessels are allowed to substitute one name for another. A case
occurred the other day where a Japanese who was completely barred from working in the industry by
Mr. O’Brien at Thursday Island came up from Cairns as master of the “ Sikotana.” I think his name is
Goiki, aud that he is working on somebody else's license.
William Heiibert Flamsteed, Mercantile Manager, examined:
7574. By the Chairman: What are you ? Mercantile manager for Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co.,
Cooktown.
, 7575. How lomr have you been at Cooktown? A little over two years.
7576. During that time have you acquired any knowledge of the beche-de-mer industry, and how it is
carried on ? Owing to very heavy losses made by my firm during the last six years, I went into the
whole question. We had practically stopped the beche-de-mer business, and I went into the question
to see whether it would not be advisable to carry it on under certain conditions. 1 consulted two or
three of our clients who used to be in the business, and I learned a few particulars which decided me not
open any fresh beche-de-mer accounts, or to put the firm’s money behind anybody engaged in the
industry.
7577. Are you speaking for your firm now ? No ; lam just speaking from the little knowledge I have
acquired since I came here.
7578. You think the industry is not profitable ? It is not profitable to white men under present
conditions.
7579. But are there any white men engaged in it now ? No ; for the simple reason that they have been
frozen out by the Japanese.
7580. Do you consider that a desirable state of affairs ? It is not; especially so far as this port is
concerned.
7581. Prom what you know' of the monetary side of the industry, do you think that, if the Japanese were
restricted, the industry would be more attractive to white men ? From what I have heard from practical
men, there is still a good living to be made by white men, provided the Japanese are restricted, or done
away with altogether.
7582. Have you known any white men engaged in the industry ? Several.
7583. Are there any at present? They have practically all given it up now. Eobert McMaster was
engaged in it up till last year.
7584. Why did he give it up ? He has given it up because of the Japanese competition.
7585. Do you consider that the white men you have known in the industry have been compelled to give
it up in consequence of Japanese competition ? They have given it up solely for that reason. One of
W. H.
Flamsteed.


their principal reasons is that when a white man anchors his boat at a reef, even in the most out-of-the-
way places, the Japanese come along in their small boats. The white man is able to get very little fish,
because it takes so much time for him to lift his anchor close to the reef ; and by the time he has cleaned
up one patch the Japanese have cleaned up all the patches round about him.
7586. You mean that where the white man falls on a patch the Japanese come and clear it of fish ? Yes.
7587. Can you assign any reason for the present local depression in the beche-de-mer market ? Firstly,
it is owing to the Japanese competition, and, secondly, to the Japanese being able to obtain recruits where
white men cannot.
7588. Does that affect the market to such an extent as to bring down the price from £250 to £9O
a ton. Really the local market has no effect on the market at Hong Kong, as the quantity we supply is
so small.
7589. Surely there must be some reason for the decline in price ? The prices fluctuate very much; they
depend very much upon the quality of the fish ; and all the best fish seem to have been taken off the reefs
near Cooktown. I have got as much as £2OO per ton for teat fish in Cooktown.
7590. By Mr. Bennett: Recently? About eight months ago. In fact, a man who makes soup in a
fairly big way usually sends up here for fish.
7591. By the Chairman : Do you think the prices are worked by a ring in China and Manila? No ; they
are practically worked by a ring in Australian towns.
7592. Do you think the price realised in Cooktown is a fair indication of the value of the article ? A
very fair indication ; it gives the exporter a reasonable profit. There is another thing I should like to
mention. People tell me that Japanese are allowed to recruit aboriginals from Thursday Island to
Rockhampton.
7593. Do you know from hearsay that Japanese can recruit to better advantage than white men ? Only
from hearsay. One beche-de-mer man told me that he had been to a place where it was impossible to
obtain aboriginals, and that Japanese had gone there afterwards and got natives without any trouble
The inference my informant drew was that the Japanese offered better conditions to the aboriginals.
7594. Do you know what particular conditions the Japanese offered? Well, there is rum,
7595. ¥"ou consider that aboriginals recruit more readily with Japanese than with white men because the
Japanese offer the inducement of rum ? That is the impression I have gained from what I have heard.
Another thing the white beche-de-mer fisher has complained about is the restriction as to the size of
vessel which must carry a certificated master —a Japanese could have a vessel up to 25 tons, while a
white man was only allowed to have a vessel up to 15 tons, without a certificated master. But that
restriction was done away with some years ago. Practical men in the business seem to think that, if it
were made compulsory to register vessels over 15 tons, that would prevent aliens getting vessels. Their
idea is not to allow any boat to go fishing for beche-de-mer unless a white man is in charge of her.
7596. you think that the way to make the industry attractive to white men is to prohibit the alien
altogether? 1 do, because there are such a swarm of Japanese working the coast, and there will be no
beche-de-mer left if they continue in the industry. Another matter of complaint is that a white man
can register his boat, and then transfer his license to an alien.
7597. Do you make that statement from hearsay ? Although it is hearsay.it is most reliable information.
A white man gets his license, and three months afterwards he transfers that license to another man.
7598. By Mr. Bennett: That cannot be done ;it is illegal ? But a man can be in charge of a boat and
can put another man in his place. There is another thing I should like to mention, and that is in reference
to Japanese having the right to engage in beche-de-mer fishing, and the value they are to a port. Many
Japanese come in here, and, as soon as they arrive, the aboriginals they employ are taken in hand by the
local sergeant of police, and taken up to an alien store to make their purchases. There is no instance
that I know of where a crew are paid off anywhere by Japanese but in a Chinese store.
7599 By Mr. Douglas: You mean they get their money in the store—They are not paid off there?
They are practically paid off there. The boys are taken into the store and buy goods there, and the cost
of those goods is deducted from the money they are to receive.
7600. By the Chairman :Do you offer that as evidence ? I have been in stores repeatedly when that has
been done. It appears that the industry is run solely in the interest of the Japanese and Chinese, and it
seems an iniquitous thing that the police should help them in this matter.
7601. Do the Chinese offer any incentive for them to go to their stores—Do they sell'cheaper ? It
cannot be that, because they never buy of John Clunn and Sons, or ourselves, or any of the European
firms here.
7602. You say it is the custom that when a native crew arrive at this port they are taken in hand by
the sergeant of police, who takes them to a Chinese store ? I would not say that he takes them to the
store, but they all go to a Chinese store, and purchase their goods there. Ido not say they do not get
fair value for their money, but I say that is not fair to the white firms.
7003. By Mr. Douglas: But the Chinese consume all the fish ? No; they consume practically nothing;
all the fish is sent to Hong Kong.
7604. And it is consumed in China? Yes. There is no trouble in getting rid of the fish either by
consignment or by selling it locally.
7605. You think that the money earned by the natives should be spent among white storekeepers ? Yes.
7606. Would you suggest that no aliens should be allowed to employ natives? Certainly.
7607. And that any vessel engaged in the beche-de-mer fishery should be in charge of a white man ? Yes.
7603. And that the natives should be employed by that man ? Yes. The Japanese would be wiped out
in one act if they were not allowed to employ aboriginals.
7609. The working of the industry depends .upon the employment of aboriginals? Yes, Australian
aboriginals.
7610. By the Chairman: Do you not think that, if aboriginals were not available, the Japanese would very
soon replace them with other labour? No. They are very loyal to their own countrymen, and if they
could afford to employ them they would do so. They employ aboriginals because they are cheap labour.
7611. By Mr. Douglas: You were speaking just now of alleged malpractices in the recruiting of
natives ? Yes.
7612. uo you think that, if recruiting were conducted under Government supervision, that would have a
good effect, and tend to prevent such abuses ? Certainly. The reason given by two white men, who have
W. H.
Flamsteed.
< 7July^l9oB S


W. H.
Flamsteed.
7 July, 1908.
abandoned the industry, for the success of the Japanese in recruiting is that the Japanese give the
aboriginals rum and opium. The only way to remedy that is to refuse to allow the Japanese to engage in
\ the industry.
■ 7613. Would that not raise an international question ? lam not qualified to give an opinion on that
point.
7614. By Mr. Bennett-. When you speak of Japanese, do you mean aliens? The others are not worth
considering.
7615. Ton would not oppose other aliens being employed? I certainly would from the white standpoint;
but there are very few of them, and they are not worth considering. There area few Rotumah men,and,
as a rule, they are engaged in other industries for most of the season. There are only three white men
engaged in the industry now from here to Rockhampton that I know of; and they are at Port Douglas.
7616. By the Chairman : AVould it be any use prohibiting the Japanese and allowing other aliens to work
in the industry ? The best thing would be to allow none but white men to work in the industry.
Mr. Bennett : How long have you been in Cooktown ? Two years.
7618. i Were you here before ? No.
7619. So that your knowledge of the industry has been gained by hearsay within those two years ? Yes,
from practical men. Of course I would not take the opinion of anybody who had not been connected
with the industry.
7620. How many white men have been engaged in the industry during the last year? I believe there
were twenty fifteen years ago.
7621. I only want your own knowledge ? One last year and none now.
7622. Who are the men connected with the industry from whom you have obtained your information ?
Robert Me Master, and Andreassen and Moynihan, of Port Douglas, and two others whom I cannot call to
mind distinctly.
7623. By Mr. Douglas: Do the records of your firm show that there were a good many white men
engaged in the business fifteen years ago ? I have not looked into that; but the records of the firm
show that we have made enormous losses every time we have touched the business. At one time it was the
custom to back white beche-de-mer fishers by supplying them with goods, but that has been discontinued.
I had several applications last year for backing from white men who wanted to engage in the industry,
but who had no money. I believe it would have been all right; but, owing to the conditions obtaining
before, I would not listen to them. Robert McMaster was the only white man at work last year. He
was at work at it for many years, and he could have given you practical information, only unfortunately
he is laid up with rheumatism, and cannot shift out of bed.
7624. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know how long the Japanese have been actively competing in the
industry ? Por the last six years, lam given to understand, and they are increasing every month. There
are numerous vessels coming to this port and staying here for a week or so.
7625. When did the competition become so severe as to cause the present outcry against the Japanese ?
During the last three years.
7626. Principally since then ? I am told that the competition became really serious three years ago
owing to the Japanese getting on to the reefs north of Cooktown. They are a good deal south of here
now.
7627. Do you know how many vessels commanded by Japanese are engaged in the industry ? Only from
hearsay. I was told that there were from fifty to sixty out on the reefs about two months ago. There
is another thing that went very much against the industry up till last year. That is that the Japanese
are allowed to recruit from Thursday Island right down to Rockhampton; while a white man is only
allowed to recruit in certain places.
7628. Do you know that of your own knowledge? Yes ;so far‘as it relates to white men in Cooktown.
They can only recruit from Cape Tribulation to Cape Grenville, I understand. That was the permit
McMaster had last year, while the Japanese can recruit anywhere.
7629. By Mr. Douglas: Is there any aboriginal labour available between here and Rockhampton ? I
could not say.
7630. By Mr. Bennett: Have you seen any permits to Japanese to recruit anywhere between Thursday
Island and Rockhampton ? No; but McMaster’s permit has always been to recruit between Cape
Tribulation and Cape Grenville —a distance of 300 miles ; and he says that the Japanese can go right
down to Rockhampton, and that he has known it done.
7631. You only go by what he has told you ? Yes.
7632. By the Chairman : But, even if it were so, it would be no use having such permission, because there
are no aboriginals to the south, except at Cairns ? But nobody here could get a permit to recruit further
north than Cape Grenville. He could not go and recruit in the Gulf, for instance.
7633. But from Cape Tribulation to Cape Grenville should be sufficient for a man here? McMaster said
that he could not go to the Gulf when labour was not obtainable between those two points; but Japanese
have come down from Thursday Island, so I have been told, and have recruited labour for Thursday
Island outside of Cooktown.
Jose Denis Antonio, Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined:
7634. By the Chairman: What are you? A Portuguese subject from the Cape de Verde Islands.
7635. By Mr. Douglas : Are you not a naturalised British subject ? Yes,
7636. By the Chairman : What is your occupation ? Beche-de-mer fisher.
7637. You are settled on the Bloomfield River ? Yes. I own 59 acres of land there.
7638. How long have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer fishery ? For twenty-four years.
7639. Out of Cooktown ? Yes.
7640. I suppose you have made a fortune in the industry ? Not yet. I may make a little later on ;
but there is no chance now.
7641. Is beche-de-mer very plentiful now ? It is very scarce.
7642. You know what the reefs were like twenty-four years ago? Yes—plenty then. There was no
trouble to get fish then.
76 43. How do you account for the fish being so scarce, now ? We do not fish now the same as we used
to do. We used to get them on the top of the reef; now we have to fish in between 7 and 8 fathoms of
water. The fish work from the deep water on to the reef; they do not breed on the reef.
J. D. Antonio.
7J\dy!l£oa


7644. Do the fish come up from the depth of 7 or 8 fathoms to the top of the reef ? Yes.
7645. Do they come up on moonlight nighty ? They come up in fine weather —you see them floating in
the water.
7646. Is there any other reason why you think the reefs are not so rich now as they used to be ? If I
leave a reef to-day, another man comes along to-morrow.
7647. Are there too many fishermen ? Yes ; they come one after another, and the reef has no chance.
7648. Are there any British subjects like yourself at work now ? Yes, a good few. And you have a
lot of Japanese.
7649. How many white British subjects are working now ? Not many out of Cooktown, and only two
from Port Douglas. Since the Thursday Island boats started to work this way, they have pretty well
cleaned out the reefs.
7650. You mean the Japanese from Thursday Island ? Yes. Between here and Palm Island you get
very little fish on the top of the reefs now.
7651. As a British subject, do you think the Japanese should be allowed to strip the reefs ? I hate the
sight of them, any way.
7652. Then I presume you would like to stop them working. I would be only too glad to do so if I
could.
7653. If you succeeded in stopping them fisliing, do you think there would be plenty of white British
subjects who would make a living ? Yes. There would bo a living from one year’s end to the other; but
since the Japanese came in we can hardly make a living. Last year I only paid my bills and my boys, and
I had nothing for myself.
7654. During the last three or four years, since the Japanese came, has any white man made it pay?
Yery few.
7655. Do you think any of them have made it pay ? There might be one or two ; but it is as much as the
rest can do to clear expenses.
7656. By Mr. Douglas : Have you any difficulty in getting natives to work on the boats? No.
7657. Have you always been able to get plenty of boys? Yes; I have had no trouble in that way.
7658. By Mr. Bennett-. They know you well? Yes. I have never been before the court during the
whole twenty-four years I have been engaged in the industry.
7659. By the Chairman : Have you heard anything of Japanese giving rum to aboriginals when recruiting
them ? I have beard from some people that that is done, but I have not seen it done myself. I always
go recruiting in the winter time—about July—and I have to take what boys I can get.
7660. Have you ever seeu Japanese recruiting at the same place as you have recruited ? No.
7661. By Mr. Bennett-. Where do you recruit? Prom Cooktown to Bathurst Head.
7662. You have always been able to get “boys”? Yes. They are very easy people to work with as
long as you give them enough to eat. It makes no difference what kind of tucker they get as long as
you fill them.
William John Hoae, Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined ;
7663. By the Chairman : What are you ? Oh, anything—a bcchc-do-mer man —a resident of Cooktown.
7664. How long have you been in Cooktown? About thirty-one or thirty-two years.
7665 During that time have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer trade at all ? I was engaged in the
industry twenty-nine or thirty years ago in New Guinea.
7666. How many years’ experience have you had in the industry ? All the time off and on since I have
been here.
7667. Have you had any practical experience in the industry yourself? Yes.
7668. Have you been out on the reefs fishing ? I have.
7669. Are you a seaman by calling ? I am as good a seaman as a lot of those who have tickets.
7670. Are the reefs as prolific in fish now as they were when you first knew them ? The last six or seven
years they have been pretty well fished from Thursday Island to Cairns, but there is payable fish on
them now.
7671. By whom were the reefs in those places fished? Up to six years ago my boats and a lot of
European-owned boats fished the reefs from Night Island.
7672. How many white men from Cooktown were engaged in the industry ? There were seven or eight
vessels from Cooktown.
7673. Worked by white men ? Yes ; white men in registered vessels. Twenty-four years ago there
were twenty vessels, I believe. Twelve were wrecked in 1881 —big schooners, not small boats.
7674. How many vessels owned by white men are in the industry now ? Four or five, which have
licenses from Cooktown.
7675. Are the white men living at Cooktown ? There are Barney Audreasson and D. Moynihan.
7676. Is not Andreassen at Port Douglas ? Yes ; but he gets his license from Cooktown.
7677. If witnesses have stated in evidence that there is only one boat owned’by a white man, would they
he telling the truth ? I believe Andreassen got his license out. Tommy Ah Kum got two licenses. I do
not know whether Moynihan got his license at Cooktown.
7678. Did you do well while you were engaged in the industry ? The first two years I did fairly well,
but there were a lot of expenses connected with my boat.
7679. How did you do the last few years ? I managed to make a profit out of it. Captain Ingham was
in shares with me for twelve months, and then I went with Charley for two years. About six years ago
we made j£l,020 in two years.
7680. Do you think the industry can be made payable for white men ? Yes.
7681. Under present conditions ? There is payable fish on the reefs now.
7682. If four or five reputable men in Cooktown say that under present conditions—that is, with Japanese
working in the industry—it is not possible for white men to make the work pay, would they be telling the
truth ? We cannot compete with the Japanese who are swarming down the coast.
7683. Can white men make the industry pay under present conditions ? No ; not as licenses are issued
at present by the Thursday Island people.
7684. The issue of licenses is now stopped? No, sir.

7685. How many boats do you think the Japanese are employing in the industry at the present time ?
There are about fourteen at Mackay that I know of.
7656. By Mr. Bennett-. Have you been down there recently ? I was down last August, when my vessel
was lost there. There are fourteen boats there this season.
7657. By Mr. Douglas : You say you see no reason why Europeans should not make it pay under present
conditions ? They cannot make it pay with the Japanese boats swarming down from Thursday Island.
7688. You think that, if the Japanese were not here, it would be remunerative for white men? But
there is too much competition with the Japanese coming along. There fire any amount of fish on the
coast. A boat went out from here and in a month it brought in eight bags of fish. That was with five
boys aboard. It was just working from here to the Howick Islands.
7689. But would they not get that from any other boats ? No.
7690. You know the practice of the Japanese is to change the fish from one boat to another? I am
certain that all the fish was got by this one boat. The fish come from the deep water.
7691. You hold that Europeans cannot compete with the Japanese ? No ; the European works in a big
vessel of 20 or 30 tons, and a big crowd of small vessels worked by Japanese come along, and they skin
the reef. You are only one among about twenty.
7692. You have no boat in the industry this year ? No ; up till last year I had a boat.
7693. Constantly employed ? A es ; I had two boats last year. I have still a license for one boat.
7691. Did you have any difficulty in getting boys? No; there are any amount of boys in the Cooktown
district—the best of divers. I deliver the boys back here from Mackay.
7695. Do the boys engage more readily with Japanese than with other classes of employers ? No ; they
would sooner go with white men. There was one Japanese came down here, and he made three attempts
to get his crew before he got to Cooktown. They work on the Japanese mqre when they engage them.
7696. By Mr. Bennett : What do you mean when you say “ They work more on the Japanese” ? They
run away when they get up the coast. When they get them aboard I do not know what they do with
them.
7697. Do the Japanese not understand them as w'dl aa white men? They understand them too well.

Present:
Captain J. MACKAY ( Chairman ) | Mb. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Allison Seymour Laird Wells, Sub-Collector of Customs and Shipping Master, Cooktown, examined:
7698. By the Chairman : What are you ? Sub-Collector of Customs and Shipping Master at Cooktown.
7699. How long have you been at Cooktown ? I was here for about one and a-half years previously
aa second officer and Shipping Master, and I am now getting into my fourth year as Sub-collector of
Customs.
77(0. By Mr. Bennett-. In what years were you in Cooktown previously? About 1897 and 1898.
77ul. By the Chairman : Do you tender a list of vessels licensed under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer
PisheryAct? Yes. [Document produced. Vide Appendix ATX]
7702. Can you give us any information relating to the present condition of the beche-de-mer industry ?
There is a considerable falling off in the number of boats licensed.
7703. To what do you attribute that falling off ? I think the boats at present engaged in the beche-de-mer
industry have been licensed at ports other than Cooktown. Most of them have been licensed at Thursday
Island.
7701. Boats belonging to Cooktown ? No. One of the Cooktown boats has been lost. McMaster has
not licensed his boat, the “ Thistle.” Hoar had a small cutter called the “Rapid,” which was licensed,
but she is not licensed now.
7705. Do you attribute the non-renewal of the licenses for those boats to the depression in (ho
bcchc-de-mer industry ? Yes ; last year to the fall in the price of the fish. Owing to that fall in price,
European boat-owners did not consider it worth while renewing their licenses this year. If the information
will be of any use to to the Commission, I can give you the number of aboriginals employed in the
industry since 1905.
7706. Do you include the,white men employed? No, only aboriginals. In 1905 there were 136
aboriginals employed ; in 1906, 122 ; in 1907, 114 ; and in 1908, up to date, 115. The number of boats
licensed in 1905 was 7, men in charge 6, one of whom was a European ; in 1906 there were 9 boats
licensed, and 7 men in charge, one of whom was a European. In 1907 there were 9 boats licensed,
7 men in charge, not one of whom was a European. lu 1908, up to date, 4 boats have been licensed,
2 men in charge, neither of whom is a European. In 1905, 1906, and 1907 Robert McMaster was in
charge of his own boat, but, as he holds a master’s certificate, he does not appear as a man in charge.
The European in charge in 1905 w'as Ered. Griffin, who does not hold a master’s certificate. The
“ Whaup” had a master in charge. Hoar was the other European who was in charge of a boat, and he
holds no certificate. The “Ellen,” the “ Rescue,” and the “Beatrice" are owmed by Lai Pook, and the
“May” by Jose Antonio. Those are the boats licensed this year.
7707. By Mr. Bennett: AsShipping Master, you are acquainted with the method of engaging and
discharging aboriginals ? Yes.
7708. Are all aboriginals recruited on the coast by Cooktown boats brought to Cooktown to be shipped ?
Yes.
7709. Are they shipped at the Shipping Office? Yes. Each owner, or man in charge of a boat, recruits
his aboriginals on the coast, and on arrival at Cooktown he obtains a permit from the sergeant of police,
and upon that permit I ship them on the articles.

MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MBR ROYAL COMMISSION.


7710. On the termination of their engagement, how are they dealt with? They are brought to the
Shipping Office and paid off in my presence, the money being handed over to the local Protector of
Aboriginals, with a view to his seeing that the boys are dealt with fairly when making their purchases.
7711. That practice is authorised ? ' Under the Aboriginals Protection Act the Protector is supposed to
receive their money.
7712. By the Chairman : Does the Protector accompany them to the place where they wish to spend their
money? I cannot say.
7713. By Mr. Bennett: You do not know that as a matter of fact? I cannot answer for every
case. I know that in my presence he generally tells them when to meet him to make their purchases.
7714. It has been stated in evidence that the “ boys ” are paid off in a Chinese shop—is that so ? No.
They are never paid off in a Chinese shop ; they are paid off in the Shipping Office.
7715. By the Chairman-. Have they been taken to a Chinese shop by a policeman? I believe that the
late officer in charge, Sergeant Keogh, took some of them to a Chinese shop, but I cannot say that from
personal knowledge. In many instances it is the “ boys’ ” wish to deal with a Chinaman rather than
with a European.
7716. By Mr. Bennett : Is there anything you think the Commission should know that has not been
mentioned ? I might make a statement with regard to the form of the articles. This year two sets of
articles from Thursday Island came under my notice. They were made out in a manner which permitted
the “ boys” to be taken off the coast of Queensland. There was no special provision in them that the
aboriginals were not to be taken off the coast. I make boats take out articles restricting the employment
of aboriginals to the coast of Queensland. Tn one instance I had a set of articles which did not provide
for the “ boys” being returned to their homes after they had been discharged.
7717. By the Chairman : From Thursday Island ? Yes. On one occasion I communicated with the
Department in connection with the engagement of those boys, and the matter was submitted to Mr.
Howard, the Chief Protector of Aboriginals, and I got his reply. I think it would bo a good thing if
there was a special clause inserted in the articles or agreements for beche-de-mer boats, restricting their
employment to Queensland waters. In some cases a vessel might be in charge of a European, who
might wish to take his vessel beyond the Queensland boundary, and there should be a special provision
dealing with the employment of aboriginals in such cases.
7718. By Mr. Bennett : Of course you know that the larger vessels employed in the beche-de-mer
fishery sometimes go to reefs far beyond the Barrier Eeef ? Yes.
7719. Those reefs are beyond Queensland waters ? Yes ; outside our boundary.
7720. And in taking aboriginals there they are going against the letter of the Aboriginals Protection
Act ? Yes ; and, unless there is some provision in the articles to prevent that, I consider the master of
the ship is justified in going.
7721. You are aware of the difficulties in connection with the articles in cases where Torres Strait
islanders are living almost always in New Guinea waters ? Yes.
7722. Can you suggest any means by which that difficulty could be met ? It could be met by placing the
island boys on a different footing from that of the mainland boys.
7723. By the Chairman: Why not specify in the articles that their employment must be confined to
territorial waters ? Such a provision would apply to all aboriginals, and Mr. Bennett is referring to boys
who are virtually engaged in New Guinea waters. Those boys would be debarred by such a provision
from going into their own waters. * Where a vessel is of a size to he considered an ocean-going vessel,
is seaworthy in every respect, and is in charge of a certificated master, I do not see why there should
be any objection to allowing natives on that vessel to be employed beyond the Queensland boundary.
7724. By Mr. Bennett : That is to the reefs of the Coral Sea ? Yes.
7725. By the Chairman : In a case like that the Shipping Master would no doubt take into consideration
the antecedents of the man—whether he was reputable or not ? It would be for the Marine Board to
say what sized vessel it should be, whether the man was of reputable character, and whether he was a
certificated master.
7726. As you are aware, a lot is left to the discretion of the Shipping Master ? Yes. Only that under
the Aboriginals Protection Act you are forbidden to ship boys to go beyond the territorial waters. In
Alec; Mathieson’s time ho used to sign on the boys here, and then he would disappear for the better part of
a year, and return with a lot of fish. He “went foreign” to the reefs in the Coral Sea. I was Shipping
Master during the latter part of the time he was working here, and I know that the boys did not want to
leave his ship ; and, when they did go away to visit their homes, as a rule the majority of them came back
when he was recruiting again, showing that they were properly treated by him. Ido not remember any
instance of ill-treatment of boys being brought under my notice. Of course, he had a very good man
as his mate—Moynihan, who is in charge of the “ Spray ” now. I cannot say from personal experience,
but I am quite satisfied that a good many boats go outside territorial waters, and it would be very
difficult to prevent them, because you cannot keep an eye on the whole of the lleet employed in the
fishery.
7727. By Mr. Bennett: And the boys themselves do not know where there are going ? No.
7728. Can you furnish us with a return of the bcehe-de-mer exported from Cooktown for several years
back —say for the last three years ? I think I can safely promise that. 1 will furnish a return going
back as far as possible. [ lletum subsequently received. Vide Appendix AW/.J
Frank Bodman, Sergeant of Police, and Protector of Aboriginals, Cooktown District, examined :
7729. By the Chairman : What are you ? Sergeant of Police and Protector of Aboriginals, Cooktown
District. ,
7730. How long have you been acting in that capacity ? I came hero on 15th May last, but did not take
charge until 18th May.
7731. Do you know the custom prevailing with regard to paying off aboriginal crews ? I have not paid
off any since I came here.
,7732. So that you cannot speak from personal experience ? No. Six natives received advances in the
Shipping Office, and they went away themselves. Ido not know where they went to.
7733. By Mr. Douglas: What are your instructions from the Chief Protector of Aboriginals in regard to
the disposal of the wages of aboriginal crews engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? lam not well up
Wells.

in the work yet; but, so far as I can see, there are really no instructions. Several aboriginal servant
, girls have been paid their quarter’s wages, and I have hanked their money for them. The money is paid
to me, and I put it in the Savings Hank for them.
7734. Will the same system prevail in regard to natives working in the boats ? I have found from the
Customs officials that they are paid in the presence of the Protector, and he sees that the money is
properly spent. They look to him for protection ; and, if they want to spend their money, the Protector
goes with them.
7735. By Mr. Bennett : If you were superintending the spending of the money, would you take the
aboriginals to any place they expressed a wish to go to ? If they asked me to go to any place, I would
deem it my duty to go there with them and see that their money was properly spent. They are generally
pretty knowing, and like to get as much as they can for their money.
7736. By the Chairman : Would you deem it your duty to see that they were not imposed upon ? Yes.
7737. By Mr. Bennett : It is not your duty to see that they spend their money in any particular store?
No.

FRIDAY, 10 JULY, 1908.
Peesent:
Captain J. MACKAT ( Chairman ) | Me. G. II. BENNETT.
Philip Johnson, Beche-de-Mer Eisher and Selector, examined :
7738. By the Chairman: What country are you a native of? I am a native of the Cape de Yerde
Islands.
You are a naturalised British subject ? Yes.
’ 7740. How long have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? For thirty-nine years. I have
been settled on the Bloomfield Eiver for the last twenty-two years, and I was fishing for beche-de-mer
before that.
7741. During the twenty-two years you have been settled here you have been fishing for beche-de-mer at
intervals? Yes.
7742. When you went fishing twenty years ago was fish more plentiful on the reefs than it is now ? Yes.
There was plenty of beche-de-mer twenty years ago. I got 11 tons in six weeks,
7743. How much could you get in six weeks now ? The average now is between 2 and 3 tons a year.
7744. To what do you attribute the falling off in the catch ? Before we used to pick the fish up on the
top of the reef. Now you have to fish in deep water.
7745. Is there any other reason for the fish being scarce ? The other cause is that twenty years ago, when
we fished on the top of the reef, the fish bred all the time. They do not breed on the top of the reef now
because they do not get a chance.
7746. Is the small supply also due to there being more people working in the industry now than there
used to be ? There are too many boats now because the Japanese are fishing.
7747. Can you make a living now on the reefs? No.
7748. If the Japanese were not allowed to fish, could British subjects, like yourself, make a living ? If
you stopped the fishing altogether for four or five years, the fish might come hack again.
7749. We were at Endeavour Beef yesterday and found it quite denuded of fish, while twenty years ago
there was plenty of Mche-de-mer there? There are none there now.
7750. If fishing were stopped, how long would it take for the reefs to fill up again ? If you stopped the
fishing for three years, they would be on top of the reefs again, because they would gradually come up from
the deep water. Now, the Japanese look for them in the deep water through swimming diving spectacles,
and do not give them time to come on top of the reef to breed.
7751. The Japanese method of fishing will not allow the beche-de-mer to breed ? No.
7752. Do you think that, if fishing were stopped for three years, the industry would be profitable to
British subjects again ? Yes ; the way the Japanese fish they do not give a chance to anybody to make a
living.
7753. Are there any British subjects fishing from hero now ? Yes, Antonio.
7754. How much fish does he get ? Last year ho got about 1* tons in four months. Twenty-five years
ago I got 17 and 18 tons.
7755. If you wanted to fish, could you get plenty of labour for crew here? Yes: I can get “boys” to
work for me.
7756. By Mr. Bennett: At one time there used to be plenty of fish on Endeavour Beef ? Yes. About
sixteen years ago there vvas plenty of fish all over that reef. I got 14 tons on Endeavour Beef and the
long reef off Hope Island.
7757. How long did it take you to get those 14 tons ? We were at work about twelve months.
7758. By the Chairman : How much per ton did you get for that fish ? We used to get from £80 to £90
per ton.
7759. Did you never get £200 per ton for teat fish in the old times ? No ; £80 per to®.' I worked for
Captain Lake, and got 16 tons in one year. All my best fish were then sold for £70 a ton. Now I get
£120 a ton.
7760. You mean you got £170 per ton formerly? No; £80 for teat fish, and £50 for black fish and
red fish.
7761. That was from Captain Lake ? Yes ; the price was very low at that time.
7762. Is there anything else you would like to say about the beche-de-mer trade ? They allowed me to
ship “ boys,” but not to go to the Coral Sea, outside the Queensland boundary. Last year a Japanese
went out from Thursday Island, and had on board “ boys ” who were shipped for New Guinea.
7763. By Mr. Bennett: Where do you get your crew from? Sometimes from the Bloomfield, sometimes
from Night Island, and sometimes from Barrow Point.

P. Johnson,
io July, 1908.
7704. Have you always been able to get plenty of “boys” for crews? Tes; but since the Japanese
started working we cannot get many. f
7765. It is harder to get crews now ? Tes. The Japanese give the natives grog, and we are not allowed i
to give them grog.
7766. By the Chairman : What do you give to the aboriginals ? A bag of flour, 11b. of tobacco, a dress
for the wife, a pair of trousers for the boy, and a blanket.
7767. What do the Japanese give them? They give them two bags of flour, and stuff them with grog.
7768. Have you ever seen a Japanese give a native grog? I have never seen a Japanese do it, but I
have seen the grog down below in the boat.
7769. Have you seen a Japanese give the natives grog? I have seen a “ boy” drunk, and he must have
got the grog from the boat,

Captain J. MACKAT ( Chairman ) | Me. G. H. BENNETT.
Bobeet Punt ox Tunnie, Manager for Jack and Newell, examined ;
7770. By the Chairman : What are you? Manager for Jack and Newell, storekeepers. 1
7771. How long have you been at Port Douglas? Twenty-one years next November. ,
7772. Representing that firm ? Tea. ]
7773. Are your firm engaged in any other industry besides that of general merchants ? That is the
only industry we are engaged in, except that we supply the fishermen going out to the reefs with
provisions.
7774. Have you been interested in the beche-de-mer industry? Not any further than supplying the
fishermen with provisions. The firm supported a man in building a boat, and he was four years building it.
7775. Then you know nothing about the beche-de-mer industry ? Nothing except dealing with the fish,
and the price of fish.
7776. Is beche-de-mer realising a bad price at the present time ? The price it is realising now is nothing
to what the price was in former years.
7777. What is the highest price you have known ? £190 per ton.
7778. What is the price now ? £79 aud £80 a ton, as far as I understand.
7779. By Mr. Bennett : For teat fish ? Tes.
7780. By the Chairman : Can you assign any reason for that great falling off in the price ? The only
reason 1 can assign is that there are such a number of boats getting fish that the market is glutted.
7781. By Mr. Bennett : Is the fish exported from Port Douglas direct to China, or is it sold to Chinese
at Port Douglas ? We send all the fish that is got here to Mr. Humphrys, at Cooktown, and he remits a
cheque for the amount it realises at that place.
7782. So that you have no direct dealings with the Chinese market ? No.
7783. None of the Chinese at Port Douglas buy the fish?. No; but Chinese at Cooktown and Cairns
buy beche-de-mer.
7784. By the Chairman: What we want is some practical information in regard to the working of the
beche-de-mer industry ? I am unable to give you any. My complaint is more of a Marine Board matter,
about a man named Pegel, who applied for a master’s certificate.
Seveein Beenee Andeeassen, Master Mariner, Farmer, and Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined:
7785. By the Chairman : What are you ? A master mariner, holding a Queensland coasting certificate"
7786. What are you engaged in at present ? I am engaged in farming at present, but I am expecting to
go away beche-de-mer fishing in a few days.
7787. How long have you been in Queensland ? I came to Queensland in 1884. :
7788. Since then have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer industry. I have been engaged in that
industry about nineteen years —since 1889.
7789. When you commenced fishing on the reefs were fish pretty plentiful ? It was going down a bit at
that time, but four or five years before that the fish were more plentiful.
7790. Are fish as plentiful on the reefs now as they were when you began fishing, or are they scarcer ?
The fish are much scarcer now.
7791. To what do you attribute that change ? The number of boats fishing is one cause.
7792. Do you know the number of boats engaged in the industry at the present time? No ; I do not
know the number of Japanese boats now engaged in the industry.
7793. Do you know the total number of boats ? No; not the correct number.
7794. Can you work the industry now so as to make it pay ? Hardly.
7795. How many years have you not been able to make much profit at the industry ? I made a living
at it up to last year, although 1 was not out very long. I was in no hurry to go out last year, because the
boats were so numerous, and I did not go out until after the cold weather was over.
7796. Do you think it is possible for a white mau to make a living at the industry at the present time ?
I do not think it is possible to clear expenses considering the number of months you have to be idle during
the hurricane season.
7797. Tou attribute your inability to the number of boats engaged in the industry ? Tes.
7798. If the Japanese were prohibited from fishing for beche-de-mer, do you think white men would then
be able to make the industry pay ? They could after a year or two, when the reefs have recovered a bit.
7799. If the reefs were closed for how many years? It takes from three to five years for the fish to
mature.
7800. For what number of years would you close the reefs ? The shortest period I would close them for
would bo three years.

7801. Can you give us any idea of the number of white men who could make a living if the fishing were
• stopped for three years, and the Japanese were restricted ? Of late years Ido not suppose there have
n been more than a dozen or a dozen and a half white men altogether in the fishing vessels. With a small
number of men like that, and working the reefs one after another, they would get a chance to recruit
themselves again in a couple of years.
7802. You think that under the conditions you have mentioned there would be employment for a large
number of white men ? Yes; they would be able to make a living again.
7803. What were your average earnings for the last two or three years that you were making a living at
it ? One year it was over £5OO, another year about £lOO, and last year about £3OO.
7804. By Mr. Bennett : Gross or net ? Gross.
7805. By the Chairman : Supposing your gross earnings were £4OO, how much could you save out of
that? After paying all expenses, 1 suppose it would leave me £2OO. Of course, my boat is only
11 tons. With a bigger vessel you might earn more, and the expenses would be more in proportion.
7800. By Mr. Bennett : What reefs were you fishing last year ? I started from North Barnard and
worked down to the reefs off Townsville. Myrmidon Reef was the last I was on.
7807. Were you getting fish off the top of the reef ? Yes. On that particular reef I was getting surf
red fish. They are got in the breakers.
7808. By the Chairman-. Do you mean the prickly red fish? No; that is another kind which is found
in deep water.
7809. By Mr. Bennett: Can you get any fish on top of the reefs now ? There is no fish on top of the
reef until you get to the reefs outside the Barrier Reef. Last year I started from off the Johnstone River
and worked down by Hinchinbrook Island, and in four weeks I only got two bags of fish ; and that was in
fine weather in the best part of the season.
7810. Had you fished on those reefs before ? Yes ; for two years previously.
7811. Did you find last year that the supply of fish had decreased greatly as compared with former years ?
Yes. I could only get two bags in about a month in the best time of the year, when I ought to have
averaged about a ton a month.
7812. You had got plenty of fish off the same reef previously ? Yes. The year before I got twenty-four
bags in a month —that is over If tons; but that was an exceptional year. It was very nice weather, and I
had no lost time.
7813. By the Chairman : Have you ever fished on Kennedy Eeef, off Hinchinbrook Island ? Yes; I
was there three years ago. There are small black fish there.
7814. By Mr. Bennett : Then, in your opinion, under the present system of working, the reefs do not
get sufficient rest? They get no rest at all, because one boat comes along after another. Mr.
Mackenzie, of the “ Norn.a,” told me in Cooktown that seventy-five boats took out licenses at Thursday
Island, in January, last year; and all those boats came down and fished the reefs one after the other,
those behind not knowing that the boats ahead of them had been on the reefs. With a floating station
you do not skin the reefs, as, if you do not get enough fish, you move on. We do not skin the reefs like
the Japanese.
7815. I suppose you have been on the reefs to the north of here, too ? I have been up North. Three
years ago I started from Cape Melville and worked South, but the reefs were skinned. I had fourteen
“boys,” and in the month of January I only got a bag and a half, in fine weather.
7810. Did you ever fish on Endeavour Reef in the old days ? Yes ; there is no reef between the Home
Islands and away off Bowen that I have not been on.
7817. Did you get plenty of fish on Endeavour Reef in the old days ? A bit. It is so handy to the
Bloomfield River that the people there have a station at home and can go out to the reef at any time.
It is so skinned now that you can get hardly any fish there.
7818. Have you been able to obtain all the labour you have required in the industry ? The last few
years it has been very scarce. One year I only got seven “ boys,” and last year I managed to rake up
nine, but I had to take all sorts —old men and small “boys,” who really ought not to be taken out.
7819. Is there not a minimum age at which “ boys” arc allowed to be recruited ? Yes. They were all
right so far as ago was concerned, but they were no use. I prefer “ boys” w'ho have been out before.
7820. You are speaking of Binghis ? Yes.
7821. Where do you recruit principally ? My recruiting ground has always been from Stewart River
down to Noble Island.
7822. About Barrow Point? Yes ; principally Barrow Point, and at Cape Melville, Elinders Island, and
Princess Charlotte Bay.
7823. Can you give us any reason why the supply of labour has decreased of late years ? Ido not know
that the number of boys has decreased much, but more labour is required, and that is the only reason I
can give. I do not know that there have been been more deaths during recent years than there were
before. A few boys were lost in the cyclone up North, and a few get lost in the boats occasionally.
7823 a. I suppose you know r the tribes around there pretty well? Yes.
7824. Do you think the number of aboriginals has increased or decreased ? I believe there were more
twenty-one years ago than there are now. 1 know there were more boys at Night Island, at Cape
Direction, at Restoration Island, and at Home Islands than there are now. There are very few boys at
those places now.
7825. Have you ever been at aboriginal camps when the Japanese have been recruiting? Yes ; I was at
one last year. Ido not know whether all the Japanese there were recruiting or not, but they went
ashore. There was one recruiting at the time I was at the camp.
7820. Where was that? At Barrow Point and Indian Head.
7827. AVere you recruiting at the same time? No. I was returning boys.
7828. Did you see what means the Japanese employed to get labour? I have not actually been an
eye-witness of what they did. It is very rarely that two persons happen to be in the one camp recruiting
at the same time. The only two who go into the same camp at one time are Dan Moynihan and myself.
7829. So that you cannot speak from your own personal knowledge of anything that has occurred among
the Japanese and the aboriginals ? No.
7830. What trade do you give when recruiting labour ? Elour, tobacco, and anything in the shape of
clothes—calico, print, or anything of that kind that they may fancy,

7831. How much flour have you to give now ? We have to give two bags now, whereas we had to give
only one bag formerly, half a pound of tobacco, and a few pipes and odds and ends. The boys say that
the Japanese give them two bags of flour, and they want two bags from us.
7832. Small bags ? Yea. At the same time they told me that the Japanese pay them off with two bags
of flour, sometimes with one bag.
7833. That is, the Japanese make them a present of one bag of flour in addition to their wages? No;
the flour is for their wages. When they are paid off the local Protector goes with them to the store to
make their purchases, and I have seen the boys returning to the boats with half a dozen bags of flour
each, and afterwards the Japanese have sent them home with two bags.
7834. Have you seen that occur? No. I only know that from what the aboriginals tell me.
7»35. By the Chairman : Have you any suggestion to make for the improvement of the industry ? The
only way it can be improved is by stopping aliens from using aboriginal labour, and stopping their licenses.
The Japanese get the time for shipping “boys ” extended. We ship the “ boys ” for nine months, and
the Japanese have shipped them for twelve months.
783G. By Mr. Bennett: Are you sure of that ? Yes.
7837. From the articles ? Yes. I think nine months is quite sufficient, because we do not want to be
out during the hurricane season ; we want to get the “ boys ” home before that season commences.
7838. But you can ship “ boys ” for twelve months if you wish to do so ? I believe we can now, but I
am not certain. When I was at one camp “ boys ” had just been taken away by Japanese, and when I
returned my “ boys ” nearly ten months afterwards, the “ boys ” recruited by the Japanese were still out.
7839. Arc the boats you speak of owned by Japanese ? That is very hard to find out in many cases, but
I know that there has been a lot of dummying going on. I believe they have got information on that
subject in black and white at Cairns from people who have been approached to take out licenses on the
understanding that they were to receive £5 for every ton of fish obtained.
7840. That is hearsay, so far as you are concerned? Yes; but you will get that information in Cairns.
7841. By the Chairman : Is there anything else in the shape of a grievance that you have to state ? No.
(Cairns.)
MONDAY, 18 JULY, 1908.
PRESENT:
Cavtain J. MACKAY ( Chairman) | Mr. H. A. C. DOUGLAS, M.L.A.
Mr. G. H. BENNETT.
John Eenfhew Craig, Secretary of the Australian Fisheries Association and Alien Eestriction League,
examined :
7842. By the Chairman : What are you ? Secretary of the Australian Fisheries Association and Alien
Eestriction League. ■ ,
7843. By Mr. Bennett : What is the membership of the association ? Between fifty and sixty. ]
7844. By the Chairman : What are the objects of that association ? The aim and object of the Fisheries
Association is to attend to all sorts of fisheries all over Australia.
7845. It does not come within the province of the Commission to inquire into fisheries —if you can give
us any practical information about the beche-de-mer or the pearl-shell industry, we shall be glad to hear
you ? I believe I can give you such information.
7840. How long have you been in this district ? Eighteen years.
7847. In Cairns, or in the North? In the North. Eight years in Cairns, seven years in New Guinea
—eighteen years north of Townsville.
7848. During that time have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer or pearl-shell industry ? I was
engaged in the beche-de-mer industry for two years.
7849. At New Guinea? Sailing out of the port of Cairns in 1892 and 1893, in the schooner “ Griffin,”
and the cutter “ Nancy Lee.”
7850. In what capacity were you employed ? I was mate in the schooner “ Griffin,” and I was the charter
party in the cutter “ Nancy Lee ” from Burns, Philp, and Co.
7851. By Mr. Bennett : Were you in charge of her yourself ? Of the “ Nancy Lee” I was.
7852. By the Chairman : What was the condition of the reefs at that time ? Fish was becoming scarce.
To get good fish you had to “ bogje” in about 4 fathoms of water.
7853. Do you know anything about the present condition of the reefs as regards the scarcity or otherwise
of the fish ? Only from hearsay.
7854. Was the industry very profitable at that time ? Yes, very profitable indeed.
7855. Can the industry be worked to advantage at the present time ? I understand it is not so profitable
now.
7856. Can you assign any reason for the change ? The principal reason that I am aware of is the too
great influx of Japanese—too much fish being taken off the reefs within the last two years by the
Japanese.
7857. You think that, if it were not for the influx of Japanese, the industry would still be payable for
white men ? Certainly.
7858. By Mr. Douglas: At the present prices for fish? Yes; one of the most remunerative industries
in Australia.
7859. By the Chairman : The beche-de-mer industry ? Yes.
7800. At the present low prices ? Yes.
7861. What do you consider a white man with a boat could earn on the reefs now ? A white man with a
schooner of about 50 tons, fully equipped, ought to make a net profit of £500 or £600 a year.
7862. Would you confine that vessel to work inside the Great BirriorEeof or allow her to go to the
Coral Sea ? Confine her to working inside the Barrier Eeef.

• 7863. Was not your experience in the “ Griffin ” outside the Barrier Reef? No ;we were not outside
s the Queensland boundary. For four or five years subsequent to the year when I was with Mathieson she
h was outside the Barrier Reef.
7861. You think the only impediment to the industry becoming remunerative for white men is the Japanese ?
That is so. Cancel all licenses to coloured aliens instantaneously, on the 31st December.
7865. Do you think that would be a reasonable thing to do ? I do. I do not think it would act
injuriously to any white men, except those who are dummying for Japanese.
7866. "What do you mean by dummying? Engaging in fraudulent practices generally —either dummying
by taking out licenses for boats owned by Japanese, or letting boats out to Japanese.
7867. Do you know of any boat owned by Japanese? Yes, I do.
7868. Boats engaged in the beche-de-mer industry? Yes. There are two vessels, the “Asahia” and
“Tiervo,” built and owned entirely by Japanese in every shape and form, and licensed in the name of
G.F. Dewar, and registered in the name of G. F. Dewar.
7869. By Mr. Douglas-. Have you any grounds for making that statement? Yes. J. J. Nakashiba is
the man responsible in this matter, and he is the Japanese consular commercial agent in Cairns.
7870. Does he hold an appointment as Japanese consular commercial agent ? I believe so, but I have
not seen his documents.
7871. Then your statement that he is the Japanese consular agent is hardly one that we can accept
without some proof ? My statement is founded on a very evident fact—that in connection with every
Japanese vessel, whether owned by P. J. Doyle or by Japanese themselves, -Mr. Nakashiba goes to the
Shipping Office with them and does the business for them.
7872. But he may be acting merely as interpreter ? That is all he professes to be, but I call him the
consular commercial agent.
7873. By the Chairman : But he may only be acting as agent —For your own sake we want to get evidence
based on your personal knowledge ? It is perfectly obvious.
7874. By Mr. Douglas: You were describing this system of dummying ? About two years ago
Nakashiba and his employee or partner, or whatever he may be —Sadakane —a man well known in
Thursday Island, and who has been in the hands of the police repeatedly, and has been in gaol for six
months, and one thing and another—commenced to build a boat at Lyons’s sawmill. During the time that
the boat was building, several people were approached by Sadakane with a view to taking out a license
for the boat. One of those he approached was a member of our association, Captain A. B. Olsen. Captain
Olsen promptly refused.
7875. Do you know this of your own knowledge ? I do. I have had the statement from Captain Olsen
repeatedly. We have had the statement made in public at our association meetings, and I have taken
notes of it from Captain Olsen.
7876. By the Chairman : Has your association received recognition from the Government, or in any
other public way ? It is not registered as a society, or a limited liability company, or anything of that
sort.
7877. You merely convened a meeting and called yourselves an association ? Yes.
7878. Beyond Cairns is it recognised at all ? We have members in Cooktown and Thursday Island.
7879. By Mr. Bennett: Is there a branch in Townsville ? No. Captain Olsen promptly refused
7880. By the Chairman: Is he hero now? No. He is outside Bowen, about Whitsunday Passage
somewhere. ■
7881. As an intelligent man. you know that we cannot accept second-hand evidence —We might discuss
the matter in this way for the whole day and be no wiser at the end ? lam not here in a friendly
way. lam appearing as an official before the Commission.
7882. I hope we are going to continue our inquiries in a friendly manner ? Yes; but it is not an
informal conversation.
7883. The inquiry is strictly official, but your evidence is of no assistance to us? I have written and
wired to you asking whether you would meet the members of our association individually, and we have
received no information.
7884. If you can give hard facts based on your own experience, we are prepared to hear you? I am
giving hard facts that I can prove.
7885. You have said some things that you have admitted you cannot prove? Not that lam aware of.
7886. By Mr. Douglas : Were you asked to obtain licenses for those two vessels ? No.
7887. Then your statement about the Japanese approaching white men is only hearsay ? Precisely.
7888. Then I must support the Chairman with regard to not accepting evidence of a hearsay nature ?
Well, I would draw your attention to the fact that I am secretary of the association, and I am empowered
by the members of the association to give evidence on their behalf.
7889. Can you show us a copy of the rules of your association ? No. There is nothing except what has
been published in the Trinity Times. Will you proceed to hear the story about these two vessels ?
7890. If Captain Olsen is coming before us, he can give his oivn evidence ? If you choose to pick him
up in Whitsunday Passage, you will get it.
7891. By the Chairman :We have given every facility for witnesses to give evidence ? Well, will you
hear the story of these Japanese vessels ?
7892. We cannot hear such evidence from you because you happen to be the secretary of an association
which has no recognition outside Cairns and Cooktown —We can only recognise you as a man with
experience of the b&che-de-mer fishery ? Well, will you hear the story of these Japanese vessels? I
ended with Captain Olsen’s flat refusal.
7893. By Mr. Douglas: We cannot take anything regarding statements made by Captain Olsen?
Captain Olsen communicated the facts to Davie Thomson, myself, and others.
7894. By Mr. Bennett : Has it been put in writing at all ? Yes ; it is in the Trinity Times, which has
been tendered to the Commission as evidence.
7895. Will you tender it now ? It has been posted to the Commission. We watched the Japanese, and
we found
7896. Who watched ? I did myself, and so did Thomson, Olsen, and others. We carefully watched the
Japanese, and found that fellow—G. F. Dewar —went with Nakashiba to the Sub-Collector of Customs
and took out a license for the “ Asahia ” in the name of G. F. Dewar.


7897., By Mr. Douglas-. But do you know that he had not bought the boat? Ido not know that he did
not buy the boat; but I would remind you that a Royal Commission has power to compel the production
of persons and papers.
7898. By the Chairman-. "We are quite familiar with the powers of the Commission, and we have not
come to Cairns to ascertain them ? I believe this Commission has power to compel the production of
persons and documents, such as bank passbooks, and they could find out in that way everything that has
passed been Dewar and Nakashiba.
7899. I regret very much that you are not helping us in any way to come to a decision regarding
dummying—Have you any evidence that there was no sale of the vessel ? None whatever. I know that
Nakashiba had great difficulty in raising money to pay bills.
7900. But do you not know how the Japanese help one another in monetary affairs ? lam afraid I know
too much. I am afraid I know that Nakashiba runs a lot of brothels, and a lot of the money that went
into the vessels came out of that.
7901. By Mr. Bennett -. Do you know anything about the law of evidence ? I know it to some extent.
7902. You know very well that no court of justice would accept evidence based on hearsay ? But you
have just come to the point where I can produce documentary evidence.
7903. By the Chairman-. Evidence in confirmation of what? In confirmation of dummying.
7904. By Mr. Bennett: What evidence do you propose to produce ? Copies of letters from myself,
Captain Olsen, and from Government departments in return.
7905. By the Chairman -. What do you mean by dummying ? If an alien owns a boat and he gets a
white man to take out a license for that boat, and it is registered in the white man’s name ; and, as far
as I can read the Act, a white man doing that is liable to a penally of £lOO or two years’ imprisonment.
7906. Are you prepared to prove that in any single instance ? I am trying to do so in regard to the
“ Asahia.”
7907. By Mr. Douglas: We have official information regarding the alleged system of dummying from a
late Shipping Master at Thursday Island, so that we have it at first hand ? Still, you only say it is
alleged.
7908. By the Chairman : Can you get anybody here to confirm what you say ? I can. There is a man
waiting outside who can confirm ray statement.
7909. Can he swear that no money passed between the Japanese and the white man ? No.
7910. Now, dropping the beche-de-mer industry, on which you do not seem to be able to give us any
information, have you had any experience in the pearl-shell industry ? I protest against dropping the
beche-de-mer fishery, and the cases of the “Asahia” and the “ Tieryo.” A third boat is lying on the stocks,
having been blocked by our association writing letters to the Government departments.
7911. By Mr. Douglas-. Can you produce anything to show what is the constitution of your association,
who the members are, and how many boats are represented ? Yes. {Reading from a document.'] The first
member on the list is A. B. Olsen.
7912. Can you submit that information in the form of a return ? No ; this is the only copy I have.
7913. By the Chairman-. Will you tender that document to the Commission ? No ; this is the original.
I want you to understand that, while the whole of you five gentlemen are in the Government service, and
are being paid for your time, I am a deck hand on the dredge, and am losing time by my attendance
here. I have no time to make type-written copies of documents.
7914. When you spoke to me, I gave you to understand that, under the circumstances, we would get
through your evidence as quickly as possible ? *Yes.
7915. By Mr. Douglas: The custom in a case of this kind is to tender a document of that nature? I
have tendered copies of the Trinity Times by letter. Are they accepted ?
7916. By the Chairman-. Yes, they are accepted; but you had better supplement those documents by
tendering that list? No; I cannot give you the original, as it contains the signatures of the members.
7917. Can you not send a copy to Brisbane ? I would rather tender it now to the Commission ?
7918. Well, tender it? I cannot give you this {rejerring to document]. We have spent more time now
over this matter than it would have taken me to give the names and your secretaries to write them
down.
7919. We have asked you to submit that information, and you practically decline to do so ? No ;I do
not decline. The most important phase of the subject is to keep Japanese aliens from surveying our coast
and manning our vessels.
7920. Why should they survey our coast—ls not the coast already surveyed, and cannot Japanese get
charts all over the country ? Very inaccurately, surveyed.
7921. As far as I can see, the information you are giving us now will not assist us in arriving at a con-
clusion ? I can read you out the names of the members of the association, and the number of boats they
represent. lam unable, through lack of time and lack of funds, to give you copies of these documents.
You can hear the names read out.
7922. lam sorry to say that we cannot accept such evidence as you propose to tender? Are you going
to proceed with the “Asahia” and “Tieryo” cases?
7923. If you can give us any evidence on the subject that we can accept ? When the boats were licensed
they were allowed to leave this port without registration, but Mr. Hartley blocked them in Townsville,
and made one of them register. There is only one of them registered even now. I got that information
from Mr. R. T. Hartley last Saturday night.
7924. By Mr. Bennett : You say that one boat is not registered ? Yes ; the “ Asahia.”
7925. Where did Mr. Hartley say that ? On the boat last Saturday night.
7926. Vou have an affidavit from Moynihan, have you not? Ves ; I will tender it in due course.
7927. Tender it now in answer to my question ? I will tender it in due course.
7928. You are taking up a wrong position ; you are damaging your own case by your action in refusing
to tender that document ? Very well.
7929. 1 ask you to tender that document now ? Are you a special pleader for the Japanese ?
7930. By the Chairman-. There is no occasion for that remark at all—Our principal object is to ascertain
if the industry cannot be made attractive to men of our own colour? I trust so.
Mr. Douglas : Mr. Chairman: The last remark of Mr. Craig is an insult to the Commission, and
I suggest that he be not further heard.
After further remarks of a personal nature addressed by the witness to members of the Com-
mission individually, Mr. Craig was requested to withdraw, and he thereupon retired.
J. E. Craig.

David Thomson, Shipwright, Master Mariner, and ex-Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined: ■
’• 7931. By the Chairman : What are you ? A shipwright by trade, and the holder of a coasting master’s
certificate.
8-7932. How long have you been in Cairns? About twenty-four years. I came out with the “Platypus.”
7933. During that time have you been engaged in the bcche-de-mer trade or the pearl-shell industry?
I have been engaged in the bcche-de-mer trade for fourteen or fifteen years.
7934. In what capacity ? Master and owner.
7935. Of course, you know what the condition of the reefs were at that time P Tes. At that time and
up till a few years ago a white man could make a decent living, if he were careful and watched his
chances, and had ordinary good weather.
7930. Do you know the present condition of the reefs ? Tes.
7937. From your ow'n experience ? Tes.
7938. Has any change taken place ? The reefs are completely cleaned out.
7939. To what do you attribute their depleted condition ? They have been fished altogether too hard.
In the old days we never stopped on a reef after we could only get half a boilerful; we went to another
reef. During the last two years the Japanese have started using glasses for diving, and they go down
to Gor 7 fathoms and take everything, and never leave a reef until it is completely cleaned out. They
leave nothing to stock up again.
7940. Then you attribute the present state of the reefs to the Japanese and their method of fishing ? Tes.
7941. What would be the result if the Japanese were prohibited from coming into the industry ? The
result would be that in five or six years the reefs would be as good as ever.
7942. As a practical man would you recommend closing the reefs against fishing for a period of years ?
Tes.
7943. Five or six years would be a long time ? It would not be a long time if the reefs were only half
fished, and the fish were allowed to multiply; but there are no fish at all on the reefs now.
7944. Is it yonr experience that the fish come from the deep water on to the reefs ? Ido not think
there is a man living who knows how the fish come. The different fish are found in different depths of
water.
7945. Tou consider that to make the industry payable for white men it would be necessary to close the
fishery for five or six years ? I do.
7946. That is, provided the aliens are excluded ? Everybody should be stopped from fishing.
7947. By Mr. Douglas ■ Have you any idea of the time of year when the fish breed ? Nobody knows
anything about how the fish breed. I have spoken to the oldest fishers I know, and they all say the
same. The only people who seem to know all about it are fellows who have been only five or six months
at the game.
7948. By the Chairman : Have you been engaged in the pearl-shelling industry ? No.
7919. By Mr. Douglas : When you were engaged in the bcche-de-mer industry you employed aboriginal
crews ? Tes.
7950. Do you think that the Japanese can obtain aboriginals where white men cannot obtain them ?
Tes.
7951. Why is that ? The Japanese are not married men. When Igo home at the end of the year I pay
off my crew and lay up for a month, overhauling the vessel and getting things ready for going recruiting
again. The Japanese pay off and then hang round the blacks’ camps in I’rincess Charlotte Bay and those
other places, and they get the pick of the boys all the time. When we are fitted out again, we have to
hunt all over the coast and pick up anything that we can get.
7952. Do you know whether the Japanese supply the aboriginals with liquor? They do not let me see
them supplying it, but the “ boys” have told me of it. The Japanese are not fools enough to let me see
them doing anything like that.
7953. By Mr. Bennett: Have you ever been at the camps when the Japanese have been recruiting?
I have been recruiting where a lot of Japanese have also been recruiting ; but we never mixed with them
at all.
7954. I am not inferring that in the slightest degree ; but have you ever seen their method of recruiting ?
No.
7955. Have you ever seen drunkenness at a camp after the Japanese have been there, or while they were
there ? No ; although I know for a fact that it is common. I cannot speak from personal experience,
although 1 am morally certain of it.
7956. By Mr. Douglas : With a view to obtaining some knowledge of the habits of the beche-de-mer, do
you think it would be wise if the Government employed a scientific man to study their habits for a
number of years ? I believe it would. Ido not think there is any difficulty in finding out about their
habits. I suppose, if we had not all been too busy, we could have known a little about them.
7957. If the fishing were closed for five or six years, would it not prevent men like Moynihan and
Olsen carrying on their operations? Tes ; it would be very hard on them.
7958. By the Chairman : Have you any recommendations to make ? The only thing I have to say is that,
unless the Japanese are stopped, it will be no use white men continuing in the industry.
7959. By Mr. Bennett-. I suppose you mean unless all aliens are stopped ? Well, the other aliens are
not so bad as the Japanese.
7960. But you cannot discriminate ? The Jap is a bit too smart for us.
7961. But, if one alien is stopped, all the others must be stopped too ? Tes.
7962. By Mr. Douglas : Do you know anything about the system of dummying that is alleged to be
going on ? Tes ; there was a case here.
7963. Do you know anything of your own personal knowledge ? I can state what Ido know.
7964. Did the Japanese approach you with reference to obtaining licenses ? No.
7965. We understand that there are two boats that are being worked by aliens and that are licensed in
the name of G. F. Dewar—Are those the boats you refer to ? Tes. They are Japanese boats which were
built above the sawmill by Japanese.
7966. But is it not possible that, as the Japanese could not get licenses, they sold the boats outright ? I
do not think Dewar could have bought a boat. I have not the slightest doubt that it is as clear a case of
dummying as there ever was. That sort of business has been carried on wholesale from what I have heard
D. Thomson.

79G7. By the Chairman : Are those two boats the only ones you know anything of ? They are the only ]
ones that I have any personal knowledge of. I lent a hand to stop the first one getting away ; but, ail .
the same, it got away. i;
79G8. By Mr. Douglas : What was the tonnage of your own vessel ? Thirty-seven tons.
79G9. What was her name? The “ Whaup.” She is laid up now, as 1 can do nothing with her.
7970. You found you could not get enough fish ? It would not pay. Last year the price of fish fell
from £165 to £9O and £95 a ton.
7971. Then to some extent the prosperity of the industry depends upon the price obtainable for
beche-de-mer ? Yes. The market was glutted with fish. Now the reefs are completely cleaned out
from Thursday Island to Lady Elliott Islands. I was at Lady Elliott Islands last year, and three
Japanese came down. I have seen as many as thirty Japanese at one time all in a cluster out on Swain
Eeef.
7972. By the Chairman : Some people have the impression that they are surveying the coast? Some
of them are smart enough for that, I believe. While Moynihan and I were in company at Lady Elliott
Islands, three Japanese came down to that place.
7973. Do you get fish that far south ? Yes.
7974. Good fish ? They are not of good quality. One of those Japanese came aboard our vessel, and
wanted to know about the reefs further south. I said I did not think there were any reefs further south,
and he replied, “ I know plenty reefs outside Brisbane.” He started next morning to look for reefs
“ outside Brisbane,” but whether he got them or not Ido not know.
7975. By Mr. Douglas : Do you suggest that the employment of aboriginals should be restricted to
Europeans only ? Yes. We have to sign recognisances for the boys. Every one of us is a white
man, who has a little property of some sort, which we may lose if anything goes wrong, but the Japanese
have nothing.
7976. You have found that you cannot now obtain aboriginals very readily ? Yes ; they are getting
scarcer every year. There are plenty of aboriginals yet for the business, and will be for many years if
the business is carried on properly.
7977. Do you think that European boats should be limited to a certain number ? There is no need to
limit European boats. There will never be as many European boats engaged in the industry as there are
Japanese now.
7978. Do you think there will be profitable employment for as many European boats as are likely to
engage in the industry ? Yes.
7979. By Mr. Bennett: You mean if the beds were closed until they recuperated ? Yes ; but even now
the men engaged in the industry can manage to scratch a living out of it until such times as the reefs
recuperate. Moynihan, and men like him, do not clean out a reef —they believe in leaving enough fish
to breed. But the Japanese do not believe in anything of the kind, and they just get all they can.
7980. By Mr. Douglas : Do you make a practice of leaving a certain quantity of fish on the reef ? Yes ;
whenever the supply of fish comes down to half a boiler, we leave the reef.
7981. By Mr. Bennett: What would half a boiler represent in cured fish ? About a bag of cured fish.
7982. By Mr. Douglas : Have you any means of distinguishing between young and mature fish? Yes,
by the skin of the fish.
7983. Is it your practice to take mature fish, and leave the young and very small fish on the reef ? Yery
young fish I always throw back into the water.
7984. Would they recover after they had been in a bag for some time ? Yes. If you kept them for a
night in hot weather they would be no use, but if you throw back small fish immediately they come on
board, they will float back to the reef.
7985. What is the size of a small fish ? A full grown teat fish is about 10 inches long. A fish 4 or 5
inches long is too small, when it is boiled, to be any good.
7986. But you would not pick up a fish 4or 5 inches long ? No. For the first day or two a new crew
will bring in small fish, but, when they see you throw it back into the water, they will not bring any more
small fish.
7987. Do the Japanese pick up everything ? Yes ; they just skin the reef of fish, shells, and everything
else. When they go over a reef they are like a cloud of locusts, and leave nothing behind them, not even
a clam-shell.
7988. Do you know the Pitts ? Yes.
7989. Have they worked on the same lines as you do, leaving the small fish? I cannot say how they
work, as I have never worked beside them.
7990. How do you sell your fish ? I sell it at Cairns. There are sometimes three or four different
buyers. There are always resident buyers, and we just get them to have a look at the fish while we are
bagging it, and give us a price.
7991. Where is the principal market for the fish ? Hong Kong.
7992. Does not the whole of the beche-de-mer go to China ? Most of it. I have heard of some going to
London and Paris, but only very small quantities.
7993. By Mr. Bennett : More as samples ? Yea.
7994. By Mr. Douglas: Are the buyers Chinese? Not always. Mr. Sturt, the auctioneer, has bought
fish several times from me.
7995. By Mr. Bennett : He would buy with the view of selling it again ? Oh yes ;he sent it on to
Hong Kong.
7996. By Mr. Douglas: Do you sell fish by either auction or tender ? Yes; the last lot I got I sold by
tender.
7997. Do you think the Chinese have a ring to regulate the price ? I have heard that they have had a sort
ring in Cooktown, but I could not say for certain.
7998. To some extent you are dependent upon the Chinese market for the price you obtain ? No ; *we
can send the fish direct to Hong Kong. I did that at one time, when I sent fish from Thursday Island to
Hong Kong, and I got just about the same price as I would have done if I had sold it at Thursday Island,
but had to wait longer for my money.
7999. Do you think that fishing for beche-de-mer interferes with the health of the aboriginals? Not if
they do not got too much of it, and they are well fed. I have had boys on board who were proper

skeletons, with hacking coughs when they engaged, and when they left they were stout and plump —
different men altogether.
. 8000. Is there any age limit for boys that you are allowed to employ ? No.
8001. Do you get them at any age? Not too young. We do not care for them too young. Ahoy
should be old enough to have strength to pull a boat, otherwise he is of no use.
8002. When they finish their terms have you any difficulty in connection with paying them off? No. I
generally send them straight home, or take them there myself.
8003. Do they have the spending of their own money at the end of their term? All my boys have
had the spending of their own money. I recruited six boys at Cooktown from a man called Eomanah,
who had knocked off fishing, but had not paid off his boys. I gave him £5 a head for the boys,
and went to the Shipping Office when he paid the boys off. They never got a farthing of their money.
8004. What was done with the money ? It was put into the bank, and, I suppose, it is in the bank yet,
because the boys will never call for the money.
8005. Do you think the boys are satisfied with that system? No. I had to promise the boys I have
just referred to that, if they came with me, they would receive their wages. If I had not done that, I
would not have got one of those boys.
8000. Do you think they understand the system of paying their money into the Savings Bank ? No.
When a boy wants his money he goes to the sergeant of police, and very likely the sergeant will give
him his boot and turn him out. The sergeant has'no means of knowing whether the boy applying for
the money is the boy who has an* account in the bank. The boys never have the same name half-a-
dozen limes, and they have no book or anything else to show that they have money in the bank.
8007. They generally like to spend their money at the end of their term ? Tes.
8008. Do you think they should be permitted to spend it ? Tes. Some of them are all right. Some of
the last crew I paid off would not touch a drop of grog of any kind. I went with them into whatever store
they wanted to go, and saw that they got fair play in buying what they wanted. They all took away to
their camp a big swag of all sorts of clothes, and plenty of flour and stuff.
8009. When their purchases go to the camp, are they distributed among the natives ? When they go to
the camp they are common property.
8010. By Mr. Bennett-. Do you know the Act relating to the beche-de-mer fishery ? I ought to know
it, but I do not think I could state its provisions.
8011. Is there anything in the Act which you find operates oppressively on those engaged in the
beche-de-mer industry ? The Act works right enough. The only thing 1 have to complain of is that we
had a terrible lot of bother two or three years ago signing on boys. At one time, when a superintendent
of police was here in charge of the aboriginals, I had to sign a recognisance, and get another person also
to sign it.
8012. That was under the Aboriginals Protection Act ? Tes.
8013. I am referring to the Pearl-shell and Beehe-de-Mer Fishery Act—What about the license fee
charged for bgche-de-mer boats, do you think that oppressive? Ido not think it is very fairly fixed.
For instance, I paid £l7 10s. a year for my license, while another man, having, say, three 10-ton boats,
would pay only £3 a year for each boat—that is, a total of £9.
8014. In your opinion that does not act fairly all round ? No. If there are two boats, one big and one
little, the little boat will get as much fish as the big one, while the big one has to pay about five times as
much in fees.
8015. Then you would favour the equalisation of the fees ? Tes. I would have it made a little bit equal,
anyhow. At present it does not give a man with a big vessel a chance.
8016. By Mr. Douglas : Have you any other suggestions to make that you think would assist us? Well,
I would suggest that the Japanese be got rid of as soon as possible. They are a great trouble. Unless
they are done away with, I reckon it is no use sticking to the industry.
William Peteesen, Master Mariner and ex-Beche-de-Mer Fisher, examined:
8017. By the Chairman : What are you ? A seaman, holding a Queensland coasting master’s certificate.
8018. How long have you been in North Queensland ? About thirty-five years.
8019. How long have you been engaged in the beche-de-mer industry ? I started in 1891.
8020. Have you been engaged in the industry all the time since then ? No; I was in it for six or six and
a-half years.
8021. Were fish plentiful in those days ? Yery fair.
8022. Could you make a good living ? Tes. I generally got 10 or 11 tons a year.
8023. Did you leave the industry after six years ? Tes.
8024. When did you return to it ? I did not go back to it. I heard from people who were in it that the
quantity of fish on the reefs was not great enough for white men to make a living.
8025. Then you have not been engaged in the industry since those six years ? No.
8026. So that you can say nothing from your own knowledge of the condition of the reefs at the present
time ? No.
8027. By Mr. Douglas : How many boats did you have when you got 10 or 11 tons a year ? I had a big
boat of 35 tons register, and we carried five or six dinghies.
8028. By the Chairmen : What was the name of your vessel ? The “ Curlew” was one of them.
8029. What was the average price of beche-de-mer when you were working in the industry ? £145 a
ton for good fish and £125 for second-class fish. We only took the teat, red, and black fish. They
were the best.
8030. By Mr. Bennett-. Tou were able to pick and choose in those days? Well, there were lolly fish
and others that w r ere only worth £25 a-ton.
8031. By Mr. Douglas-. Did you take small fish ? We hardly ever got small fish. On odd reefs you
might find small teat fi«h, but you got hardly anything for them. Nearly all the fish then were of good
marketable quality. Whether there are small fish in deep w T ater I cannot say ; but I think there are. I
think they only come up on the reefs when they are a good size.
8032. By the Chairman-. How do you think the industry could be made remunerative again for white
men? G-ive the reefs a spell for a few years. Beche-de-mer is a thing that does not grow quickly. I
have fished reefs out, and, on going back there three or four years afterwards, I could not get any fish.
W. Petersen. I
N 1

8033. For how long do you recommend the reefs should be closed ? For four or five years. The way to
make the industry profitable for white men is not to license others. If only white men were allowed to
he licensed, I think there would he a good living for hundreds and hundreds of them.
8034. By Mr. Douglas -. Supposing there was a total prohibition of aliens, would you be prepared to
embark in the industry again ? In the course of a year or two, I would. I have not got much,
but I have a bit of property in the district, and I would spend every shilling to rig myself out again.
8035. Who gets the fish from the reefs ? The natives.
8036. Then, without an unlimited supply of natives, you would not be able to carry on the industry
profitably ? If we had cheap European labour, we might carry on. If you could get young fellows to
go into the w’ater for £1 10s. a week it would pay ; but you could hardly make it pay if you had to give
£2 10s. or £3 a week. There is so much bad weather to contend with.
8037. Would you not have to give white men better food than you give the aboriginals ? No. The food
of the aboriginals is tip top. We have to keep them in good health. They have to be strong enough to
stand the water.
8038. Would white men put up with the accommodation now provided on the vessels ? No ; but we could
easily give more accommodation.
8039. You think it would pay if you could get white men for 30s. a week ? Fishing is an industry in
which you should not pay wages. It should go by a “ lay.”
8040. By Mr. Bennett : In the North Sea fisheries everybody is paid by the “ lay ” ? Yes. If there is
bad weather for a couple of weeks, it comes very hard on the owners if they have to keep the men while
they are getting no return.
8041. By Mr. Douglas: Have you been engaged in fishing in the North Sea ? I was when I was a little
boy.
8042. By Mr. Bennett-. How were you paid? By the “lay” ; but as I was only a boy I got very little.
8043. By the Chairman-. Do you think fishing for beche-de-mer is a harder life than fishing in the
North Sea? Oh no ! North Sea fishing is the hardest life in the world. There are more lives lost
there than in any other fishery in the world that I know of. In the beche-de-mer industry you have
warm weather, and at night you can get shelter and anchor. You always have big vessels with plenty of
accommodation, and enjoy a night’s rest, and there is no risk. As a matter of fact, I never insured my
vessels. I had two vessels. I sold the “ Curlew” and got the “Isabel.”
8044. By Mr. Bennett-. W ere you always able to get plenty of aboriginal labour in your time ? Yes,
from the Mulgiave River. The aboriginals there knew me.
8045. Where did you recruit from ? Always from the Mulgrave River.
8046. Up to the time you left off fishing, the Japanese did not come very much into competition with
you ? He was not here at all. I never heard of him, except in pearl-shelling.
8047. So that you cannot speak of your own personal knowledge of the effect the Japanese has had on
recruiting? No, only from hearsay; and it was hearsay that stopped mo from going into the
beche-de-mer fishery again.
8048. Your reason for keeping out of the industry now is that you believe the competition with the
Japanese and other aliens is too keen ? Too keen ; and there is too much fish in the market, so that you
cannot get half the price we used to get for the fish.
8049. Would you engage in the industry if you could do so profitably ? It there were only white people
working in it, I would engage in the industry to-morrow.
8050. Is thero anything in the Act which operates harshly on the fishermen ? I have no objection to the
provisions of the Act. The only thing is the license fee.
8051. What about the license fee ? It is very fair. There is no objection to paying the license fee.
8052. You had a vessel of 35 tons when you were fishing, and had to pay £lO 10s. a year ? More than
that. I paid £3 a year for the first 10 tons, and 10s. a ton for every subsequent ton up to £2O. For
£2O you could have a vessel of 200 tons.
8053. Can a large vessel do much better than a small vessel of 10 or 15 tons ? Aloor 15 ton vessel is
too small. You want a vessel of from 30 to 50 tons. That is a handy-sized vessel. With a smaller
vessel you are continually running in for wood and water, and you sometimes lose beautifully fine weather
in that way. A big vessel is better for the Coral Sea, but I had only a coastal certificate, and could not
go out beyond the coastal boundary. A man named Alec Mathieson, of Cooktown, had a vessel called the
“ Griffin,” and I had the “ Curlew.” I believe Mathieson was allowed to clear for the Coral Sea, but the
Customs authorities would not allow me to do so, as I had only a coasting certificate. Some of us wrote
to Sir Samuel Griffith about the matter, and we were then allowed to go out to the Coral Sea.
8054. Were you allowed to fish in the Coral Sea? We were after we wrote to Sir Samuel Griffith. He
gave instructions that we should bo allowed to clear, and we then went out to the Coral Sea.
8055. You have no complaint to make in regard to the working of the Act ? No. All we ask is that you
stop the Japanese and people of that kind fishing in Queensland waters. If the Japanese are allowed to
fish, then in the course of time, if any breach occurred between Japan and England, all the Japanese
would have to do would be to put their fleets in here, and they would have the best of pilots.
Abijah Mdekay, Solicitor, examined :
8056. By the Chairman ; What are you? A solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland.
8057. You were formerly practising at Thursday Island ? 1 was eight and a-half years at Thursday
Island. j
8058. During that time you had experience of the working of the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery
Act? It was one of the principal matters that came under my attention.
8059. So that you are pretty familiar with the Act ? I think so.
8060. Can you suggest any amendments which would bo of advantage ? There is no doubt that in their
present form a coach and horses can be driven through the Acts. To give you one instance of that, there
is section 13 of the Act of 1891 referring to fishing in prohibited areas. In order to obtain a conviction
you have to prove that a man got the shell within the area. Logically speaking, it would be practically
necessary for the inspector to go down in a diving dress alongside the diver. That is one respect in which
the Act requires amendment very seriously. I would suggest that it should be an offence for a boat
equipped for pearl-shelling to be anchored in a prohibited area unless through stress of weather, or other

circumstances of that sort, throwing the onus of proving lona Jides on the man found in such an area, just
. as under the Liquor Act in regard to supplying liquor to South Sea Islanders and aboriginals, excqpt for
• medicinal purposes, the onus of proof is thrown on the defendant.
8061. By Mr. Douglas-. Would you suggest a similar amendment in regard to cultivation areas? I
would suggest much more stringent provisions than that. I should make it an offence for any person to
be there without the permission of the lessee, and I would empower the lessee to arrest a man found on
the area. We had an instance of that kind when Mr. Pace found some Japanese in a sampan taking
up the shell that he had put down in Priday Island Passage.
SOG2. By the Chairman : On Air. James Clark’s cultivation area ? Yes. It is very hard to keep boats
off such areas unless you have very severe penalties.
8063. By Mr. Bennett: Do you recollect the technicality on which that case was dismissed ? Yes. That
is avoided now under the Criminal Code. It should certainly be an offence punishable in the first
instance with imprisonment.
8064. By Mr. Douglas: Imprisonment of the man in charge ? I would extend it to all persons.
8065. By Mr. Bennett: Do you know of any cases in which the prosecution for taking shell from
prohibited areas failed ? Yes. I only succeeded in one case, and that was one in which I think the
Hon. John Douglas, who tried it, convicted the man as much for perjury as for an offence under the
Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act. A man was found in the Darnley Island area with a diving
dress hanging in the rigging drying, and the deck w'as wet. The shell might have been a day or two out
of the water. They had been cleaned, although the muscle that was left was still wet. The defendant
went into the box and swore that the wet dress and the wet deck were due to a squall. I believe you,
Mr. Bennett, and your assistant inspector, who was also on board the inspecting boat, contradicted that,
and the man was convicted.
80(56. By Mr. Douglas : Was ho convicted of perjury ? Mo, he was convicted of the offence with which
ho was charged ; but 1 think that, if he had not gone into the box —if it had gone to a higher court—it
would have been decided that there was not sufficient evidence to substantiate the prosecution. The Act
requires proof that the shell is collected iu the prohibited area, and all you can prove is possession of
shell within the area.
8067. By Mr. Bennett: Are there any other sections to which you wish to allude? Yes. I think some
provision should be made relating to the possession of shell by unlicensed persons. At present there is
no provision in the Act dealing with that. It is really a matter for the Criminal Code.
8068. Would that assist in preventing and detecting the theft of shell ? I should throw the onus on the
defendant of showing that he was in lawful possession of the shell. With regard to license fees, I think
that all boats using a diving pump should pay the same fee. That raises the question of the registered
tonnage. A vessel of 12 tons, built in Sydney, going to Thursday Island, is registered at about 8 tons,
simply because in Sydney they put privy accommodation on the deck, and that entitles them to a
deduction from the master’s accommodation. The boats built in Torres Strait do not have that
accommodation on the deck, and consequently no deduction is allowed.
8069. The Merchant Shipping Act must surely be evaded iu one of those cases ? Yes. You are allowed
a deduction for the master’s accommodation, on certain conditions being complied with.
8070. I suppose some of them allow more for that accommodation in order to decrease the net tonnage ?
Yes. When the schooner “Shamrock,” belonging to James Doyle, was measured, the registrar at
Townsville insisted on her being registered as 26 odd tons, and that brought her over the limit of 25 tons,
so that she required a certificated master. He would not allow any deduction.
8071. Not for crew r space ? No ; there was no deduction allowed, practically on the ground that there was
no bulk head and no privy. I thought it was an iniquitous decision, and appealed against it. My appeal
was uphold, and the tonnage was reduced to 21 tons. One of the grounds on which the registrar at
Townsville acted was that wo were allowing too much spate for accommodation. The accommodation
was to be occupied by Europeans, and 1 did not think that was the way Europeans should be treated in a
climate like that of Torres Strait. My opinion is that there should be a local registrar at Thursday Island,
.and that, if the Pearl-shell and Boche-'de-Mer Fishery Act is to bo amended, provision should bo made for
a separate register for the purposes of that Act.
8072. By Mr. Douglas: You suggest that Thursday Island should be a port of registry ? Yes. It is a
great inconvenience to have to send applications down South.
8073. You think the Sub-Collector of Customs should be appointed Kegistrar? Certainly. At
present a man has to send his papers South, and then semi his boats out to work. In the meantime the
Eegistrar inspects the papers, and before the man can get registration he has to take his boat in again
and carve the number on the beam. The whole thing could be done at once if we had a local registrar.
Another amendment W'hich I would suggest in the interest of those engaged iu the fishery is that the
power of the inspectors should be enlarged. Under section 6of the Act of 1891 an inspector has power
to forbid the further use of gear and tackle which, in his opinion, is unsafe or insufficient; but he has
no such power with regard to a boat, so that a man may have any kind of a boat.
8074. By the Chairman :He has only power to forbid the use of unsafe diving gear ? Diving gear and
tackle. I think his power should be extended to enable him to forbid the further use of an unsafe boat.
8075. Does not that matter come within the province of the Shipping Master? Ido not think so, but,
if it did, there would be a division ofpporer,w r er, and I think the whole of those powers should be exercised
by one officer. The whole system of engaging and discharging crew's and granting licenses might very
well be simplified.
8076. By Mr. Bennett: Will you confine yourself for the present to the engagement and discharge of
crews ? Yes. That matter should, I think, be withdrawn from the Merchant Shipping Act altogether,
and special provision should be made for it in the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act, because the
circumstances under which the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer industries are carried on are totally distinct
from the circumstances of ordinary shipping. For instance, supposing a man in charge of a vessel is
out on the grounds and one of his crew takes sick, he should be able to go to an inspector and get
permission to engage a substitute for the man who is sick. Under the present system a man in such
circumstances must “up anchor” and go to Thursday Island to get a permit to recruit another aboriginal in
the place of the man who is incapacitated, then bring in the substitute in order to ship him, and then go
back to work, so that he has to make two or three trips, which means that his boat will probably be laid
up for weeks.
254
MINUTES OF EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER ROTAL COMMISSION.


8077. Have you any suggestion to make with regard to section .10 of the Act of 1801 ? That section
might very well be enlarged, so as to allow a ease under that provision to be determined by two justices ,
instead of by a Police Magistrate only, as at present. 1
8078. Is that section workable from an inspector’s point of view, seeing that it requires the inspector to
“take ”an offender? The inspector should have power to order, in writing, a man to appear before the
court, and there should be a very severe penalty for neglect to obey that order. It is a physical
impossibility for an inspector to “take” offenders. An inspector goes out in his boat with perhaps a
couple of men, and ho comes alongside a lugger manned by seven or eight men. If they resisted, what
power would he have to take them ?
8079. Do you suggest that an inspector’s order should have the force and effect of a summons? No—
greater force than a summons, because disobedience to a summons is not an offence. I would recommend
that disobedience of an order of an inspector should be made an offence punishable on summary conviction.
I would also extend authority to hear a matter to two justices. There are a number of justices out on
the grounds, and it would be convenient to the defendant, the inspector, and all parties concerned, if the
inspector could take a defendant to one of the adjacent islands, or on board a schooner, and have him
punished there if necessary. Frequently the Police Magistrate is absent from Thursday Island, and that
means detaining a man until he returns.
8080. Have you anything further on your notes? Yes; there is the matter of master mariuers’
certificates in Torres Strait. In a great majority of cases it is a farce to insist that boats shall be in
charge of a master mariner. If I had a ketch up there, I would sooner trust her to an experienced man
who had been working in boats in the Strait than to a master mariner. I am speaking now from my
own knowledge of men who have been in deep-sea ships, and have come to Torres Strait. Such men have
been put on vessels in cases where it has been practically a hire of their certificates. It takes some time
for them to get a knowledge of local conditions. A man holding a master mariner’s certificate no doubt
learns his trade thoroughly as regards deep-sea ships, but, unless he has a knowledge of local conditions
in Torres Strait, he is not much use ou a small boat there.
8081. By Mr. Douglas: Do you not think that a man should pass an examination before he is allowed
to take charge of a small vessel ? He should, perhaps, satisfy the Harbour Master that he is competent to
take charge of a boat.
8082. By the Chairman : Do you refer to vessels over a certain tonnage ? No, to small vessels.
8083. Vessels under 25 tons can go to sea without a certificated master? Yes ; and I think that was a
very wise extension, because of the local knowledge that is required in the fisheries. But even iu the case
of a 25-ton vessel like the “ Shamrock,” which w j as assessed as a 20-ton vessel, if she xvere my property I
would sooner have an uucertificated man in charge of her than a qualified master mariner, unless the
qualified man has had experience in such craft.
8084 By Mr. Bennett : Have you anything further to suggest? The periodical examination of diving
dress and pump is nothing more nor less than a farce under the present system. If I have two pump-boats,
and the pump and diving gear on one boat is sound and in good order, there is nothing to prevent me from
getting that pump inspected and passed, and then transferring it into the other boat when it comes in for
examination.
8085. By Mr. Douglas: But the pumps are .all numbered, and are distinguishable? Well, the
examination throws a lot of work on the inspector. The diver knows when his pipe and gear are not in
good order, and if he is not satisfied with them he will not go down in the dress.
80SC. By Mr. Bennett : That applies in the case of European owners, but was it not a fact that aliens were
inclined to run the gear until it was at the last gasp ? There is no doubt the Japanese is a fatalist. He
says, “ Only die one time ; all the same die now as die by and by” ; and, if he is on a rich patch of shell,
he does not worry about his gear.
8087. Do you suggest that that section should be eliminated ? Ido not think its enforcement is of very
great moment. If new gear is tested before it is put into a boat, that should be quite sufficient. The
inspector has power at any time to condemn gear; and this periodical six months’ inspection is a big
nuisance.
8088. Do you not think it would be belter to require the inspector to examine gear without regard to
periods of time ? He has pow'er to examine it at any time.
8089. By the Chairman : It might become faulty within a month ? Quite so. Most of the deaths of
divers have generally happened shortly after the New Year examinations of gear.
8090. By Mr. Bennett : That is so ? All the gear is examined before the licenses arc issued in the
New Year. 1 do not think there is any object iu this periodical examination, so long as there are
sufficient inspectors.
Bi9l. If inspectors were required by the Act to inspect the gear at least twice within a certain
period, but not at stated intervals, how wmuld that do ? Then the difficulty wmuld be for the inspectors
to find the boats.
8092. A floating inspector can generally find the boats ; of course, a shore inspector would have some
difficulty? Yes.
8093. By Mr. Douglas : The bursting of a pipe is very often tbe cause of an accident, and there is nothing
to prevent a pipe being changed ten minutes after the examination, if the diver wants to do it ? That
is so.
8094. By the Chairman: But an inspector can go aboard at any time, and, if he finds any of the
equipment is faulty, he will interfere ? Yes.
8095. By Mr. Bennett: Your proposition does not limit the powers of an inspector? No. An inspector
has power to go on board at any time. Section 8 compels the owner to submit the gear for examination
once in six months. It is a good principle, but in its working it causes great hardship iu many instances
unless the inspectors can go right out to the boats.
8090. But surely you are aware that the inspectors did go right out to where the boats were ? No doubt
they did at times. In your time it was done, but there has practically been only one inspector there.
8097. By the Chairman : But there will be greater facilities when they get the new steamer? Yes. I
think that an inspector should also have power to take possession and forfeit anything that he condemns.
8(198. By Mr Bennett: Has he not got that pow T er now? Ido not think so. He has power under
section 0 to forbid its use, and there is a penalty under section 9 for using condemned gear; but I do not

think a man should have an opportunity of using condemned gear. The license fee for dealing in pearls
should he reduced, because there is more illicit dealing in pearls in Torres Strait than there is with
licensed pearl dealers.
8099. Should the fee he reduced or abolished ? That is an open question. If you abolish it altogether,
you might as well do away with the license. I certainly think there should be some license fee.
8100. By the Chairman: Should there not be some discrimination between the local buyer and the man
who comes along every twelve months or so ? Of course that rests with the Police Magistrate, who
grants the license under section 14.
8101. By Mr. Bennett : Does not the issuing of licenses by the Police Magistrate lead to divided
authority in regard to the administration of the Act ? Tes.
8102. Do you think that desirable ? No ; I think there should be only one licensing authority.
8103. Tou know that all the other licenses are issued by the Customs? Tes. I think that the issuing
of licenses should also be included in the general administration. It sometimes puts the Police Magistrate
in a delicate position. He might have to hear a charge against a man to whom he had practically given a
certificate of character under section 14.
8104. Have you any acquaintance with the Diamond Trade Ordinance of South Africa ? Tes. A
recommendation was made to the Government at Thursday Island to pass a somewhat similar law four or
five years ago in regard to the possession of pearls.
8105. Do you think the provisions of that Ordinance might, with advantage, be extended to pearl-dealing?
I think so. I would throw the onus on any person in possession of a pearl in Torres Strait of showing
that he came by it lawfully.
8106. Have you ever appeared in a case of illicit pearl-dealing ? Tes.
8107. Whom did you appear for? I think I have appeared on both sides. There was one case in which
a Japanese was charged with an offence.
8108. Tou will remember that there were some grave difficulties when you appeared for the prosecution ?
Tes, there were many difficulties in the way.
8109. Especially in the matter of proving purchase ? That is so. If a man has bought a pearl from an
unlicensed person, he is not going to tell that he has bought it; and, if the purchaser is an unlicensed
person, the seller is not going to tell, because he has committed an offence himself.
8110. In fact, it is quite as difficult as proving the sale of liquor? It is very similar. They are both
offenders. There is another section relating to wages being paid every six months. That is absolutely
ignored.
8111. Do you recommend its repeal ? I see no object iu it, because men sign on for twelve months at a
time.
8112. Do you think it would be advantageous to have the Acts consolidated ? There is no doubt the
whole Act should be revised and consolidated.
8113. Do you think it would be advisable to deal with the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries as
separate industries ? Certainly ; they should be dealt with separately, and so should the turtle-shelling.
It also comes under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act.
8114. Do you suggest that turtle-shelling should also be dealt with in a separate Act. No. It might
come under the Beche-de-Mer Act.
8115. Is it not the rule that turtle-shelling is fished for by the smaller beche-de-mer boats ? Tes, and
the swimming diving pearl-shell boats.
8116. Can you suggest any amendments in the Act of 1899, with a view to requiring clearer proof of
ownership of boats before the licenses are issued? It is very difficult to prove that a man has made a
false declaration in any matter in which he is practically the only person who can have the knowledge.
For instance, 1 have a watch in my pocket, and 1 say it is mine. There is nobody better qualified to say
whether it is mine or not. It is very similar with a boat. A man says, “This is my boat,” and how are
you going to disprove his statement ?
8117. But proofs of ownership are required before registration under the Merchant Shipping Act?
Under the Merchant Shipping Act the builder’s certificate is practically accepted as proof of ownership—
that and the declaration of ownership.
8118. Would you suggest that the proof of ownership under the Pearl-shell and Beche-dc-Mer Fishery Act
should go further than a mere declaration—ls not that all that is required ? No. The Act requires you
to satisfy the licensing authority, and also to make a declaration of ownership.
8119. In the penal section you will find that only the declaration is dealt with ? That is so. In actual
practice the declaration of ownership has almost invariably been accepted in cases of transfers of boats.
For instance, if A has a boat and he sells to B, a receipt for the purchase money and a new declaration of
ownership is sufficient to transfer the license. Licenses arc continually being transferred, and there is no
provision in the Act for a record of the transfers being kept.
8120. Do you know anything about the fishing sections of the Merchant Shipping Act ? Tes ; they refer
to the home fisheries.
8121. That Act provides for the issue of what are called “skippers’ certificates”? Tes, and of mates’
certificates.
8122. Do you think that those provisions might with advantage be introduced into the Pearl-shell and
Beche-de-mer Fishery Act? It was something of that nature that I referred to when I spoke of
providing for a certificate of competency.
8123. Is there anything further you would like to say? I may say that I have no doubt that both the
pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fisheries can be made white men’s industries. The only thing is that in the
pearl-shell industry the price of shell governs the industry; but 1 am satisfied that white men are able
to do the work. The unfortunate thing with white men has been that in most cases when they have made
a “ pot” they have not been careful, and have not laid up anything for a rainy day. When I first went to
Torres Strait there was a number of European divers employed, but I do not think there are any left now,
and improvidence has been mainly the cause of their retirement from the industry’.
8124. In saying that the pearl-shell industry can be made a white man’s industry, do you mean that the
crews, divers, and fenders should bo white ? It is not a question of “ should.” lam speaking on the
question of “ could,” but I see no reason whatever why Europeans should not work the industry entirely.
8125. As divers, tenders, and crew ? Tes. Ido not say that, with the present price of shell, they could


work the industry successfully from a financial point of view. With the prices obtainable at present,
there would he nothing left for a diver, even if he were the owner of the boat.
8126. By the Chairman : You base the opinion that it could be made a white man’s industry on the
possibility of obtaining improved conditions, and the cultivation of the pearl-oyster ? Undoubtedly, if
cultivation is to be resorted to ; but I think there should be a prohibition against the employment of any
but Europeans in cultivation.
8127. By Mr. Bennett: Would you exclude the natives of the islands of Torres Strait and the mainland ?
There is no reason why they should be excluded, but I would exclude all coloured aliens.
8128. By the Chairman : In your opinion there is no doubt that the industry could be carried on by white
divers and white tenders? Looking at it from a physical point of view, there is no doubt about that.
Look at the men who have been employed in the industry —they were able to do the work, and they can
do it still. In fact, I believe more of them would be in the industry still if it had not been for their
improvidence.
Geokoe Michael G um.mow, Timber Merchant, examined:
8129. By the Chairman : What are you ? A timber merchant, carrying on business at Thursday Island
and Cairns.
8130. Have you any interest in any other industry than the timber trade ? I have a business interest in
Thursday Island.
8131. Are you interested at all in the beche-de-mer industry? No.
8132. Have you ever been in the pearl-shelling industry ? Only in a small way a few years ago.
8133. Can you give us any information about the present condition of the beche-de-mer industry ? It is
all according to what information you want.
8134. Do you, of your own knowledge, know whether fish is plentiful on the reefs, or whether the industry
is payable under present conditions to white men ? Ido not know of my own knowledge.
8135. Are you aware of any Japanese fishing out of Cairns ? I know from common repute that there
are a lot of Japanese fishing out of Cairns, and I know that they have built boats iu Cairns.
8136. Do you know that the Act prohibits them obtaining licenses for boats? The Japanese do not
obtain licenses for boats, but they have boats. Ido not know anything about the business arrangements,
but the boats are evidently licensed for somebody who can hold a license.
8137. Does the Japanese in such a case hold an interest in the boat? I presume that he does, if report
speaks truly.
8138. You cannot say that he does ? No.
8139. By Mr. Bennett : Have you had any boats built in Cairns ? No.
8140. By the Chairman : You can throw no light on the alleged system of dummying ? No ; only I know
that it does exist.
8141. But it is not capable of proof ? No; Ido not think so. It is part of the' wrong-headed system that
is in vogue ; that is all.
8142. What do you mean ? That the law is wrong.
8143. By Mr. Douglas : Can you suggest any improvement in the law—Do you suggest that subsection
(2) of section 2of the Act of 1899 should be repealed? No. The only way to deal with the aliens who
have crept into the industry is to naturalise them.
8144. By the Chairman : Not prohibit them ? How can you prohibit them ? The law has been put into
force to prohibit them, but it has been ineffectual.
8145. By Mr. Bennett : In what respect is it ineffectual ? An alien cannot own or rent a boat. That is
the wrong-headed part of the law.
8146. By the Chairman : But if the alien passes out of the industry, all those contingencies will vanish,
will they not ? Undoubtedly; but they have been in the industry for many years. lam not one of those
who have assisted them to come in. I have opposed their introduction systematically, for a good many
years, but they are here against our wish.
8147. By Mr. Bennett: And you would keep them here? Ido not think you can deport them.
8148. By the Chairman : All the divers in Torres Strait are Japanese—Do you think that is a desirable
state of affairs ? It is not.
8149. We want to remedy that, and we want you to suggest some means by which it may be remedied ?
Those men have been brought here, and they have certain rights.
8150. By Mr. Douglas : Do you refer to the men known as free men ? I am not speaking about the
indented contract men at all. The contract business should have been done away with long ago. But
men who are free men, and who have licenses, should be allowed to continue their occupation ; but no
further licenses should he issued to.aliens. Those who have licenses should be allowed to hold them as
long as they wish to do so. Those men have got into the industry, and they have rights.
8151. Naturalisation would give them the right to hold property, and would put them on an equality with
ourselves ? Yes.
8152. By Mr. Bennett : Are you aware that the law would have to be amended in order to permit of
their being naturalised? No. There are Chinamen who have been naturalised.
8153. They were naturalised under a law which is now superseded by Federal legislation, so that yonr
suggestion to naturalise them is impracticable ? If it is not practicable, there is no good my saying any
more about it; but, as long as the industry is branded as a black man’s industry, you will never get
white men into it.
8154. That is your opinion ? Yes; and that is proved by every fact. Ido not believe you can name
one white man who was born in Torres Strait who is now engaged in the pearl-shelling industry.
8155. By the Chairman : Then you think the industry cannot be carried on by white men ? Ido not
say that. I have seen different.
8156. Your contention is that the aliens at present engaged in the industry should be prevented from
prosecuting it any further? There should not be any further licenses issued to aliens outside those
already licensed, so that there might be some finality.
8157. There are now 165 aliens holding divers’ licenses ? I think that in common British fairness those
men should have their licenses continued, but they should not be able to assign them.
8158. Then there can be no chance of making the industry one for white men so long as any of those
men are alive ? Oh yes.

8159. By Mr Douglas : Many of those men are under contract, and will have to be returned to their
homes at the end of their time? Very well ; let them be returned.
81G0. By the Chairman-. The same impression was abroad with regard to the sugar industry ? I have
lived hero now for nearly two years, and I got opinions from men engaged in the sugar industry, who
thought that it could nevtr be worked with white labour, and yet they never made more money than they
have made during the last two or three years, and they will continue to do well.
8101. Do you not think that will be the case with the pearl-shell industry? I believe that, if the pearl-shell
industry is put on the basis of an Australian industry, in a few years it will find its owu level and work
out its own salvation.
8162. Can you suggest how that can bo done ? Put it on the same footing as anything else, and make it
an Australian industry, allowing no aliens to work in it—by preference, as it is now, of the people who
are in it. At the present time there are no Australians engaged in pearl-shelling.
SLG3, By Mr. Bennett : You mean as workers? I mean as pearl-shellers. Any Europeans engaged
in it to-day are no more pearl-shell fishers than lam The pearl-shell fishers are the men who get the
shell.
81G1. That was what I referred to when I spoke of workers? I make the statement that there are no
Australians engaged in pearl-shell fishing to-day.
8105. By the Chairman : The alien derives all the benefit from the industry ? Yes. It is wrong, and it
has been brought about by the legislation of which we are all cognisant.
81GG. Do you not think it is desirable to introduce fresh legislation? Yes; and make it an Australian
industry.
SIG 7. Make it a white man’s industry ? I leave the white man out, because that is a bone of contention.
You wmuld fetter it by restricting licenses or anything of that sort. That is absolutely wrong.
81G8 : By Mr. Douglas- Dow many years were you residing at Thursday Island ? It is twenty-four years
since 1 went there.
SIG 9. Then you have seen a good many phases of the industry ? I have seen it in all its phases. I
remember it when we had seventy or eighty white divers.
8170. By Mr. Bennett -. Are you sure of that? lam quite sure. \Ye had the list when the Dashwood
Commission came to Thursday Island.
8171. By Mr. Douglas : But they were not all engaged in the industry at one time ? No ; but they were
within a period of three years. It could not be more, because it was not until 1888 that Burns,
Phi Ip, & Co. started selling their boats, and in 1891 the Japanese started to come in.
817 2. How do you account for those white men dropping out of the industry? They were forced out by
cheap labour. The ruling price for divers in 1888, as the records will show, was £3O a ton, and the
Japanese came in under agreements at £l5, £l6, and £lB a ton. That is what squeezed those men out,
together with the periodical reductions in the price of shell.
8173. It is all a question of supply and demand ? Undoubtedly. While shell has an upward tendency,
we know that everything booms, the same as in any other line of business ; and in bad limes things go
back again. I believe that in itself will regulate the depletion of the shelling-beds. People get squeezed
out by financial circumstances. As to protecting the beds or closing some of them, or restricting the
number of licenses, I believe from my years of experience that that is absolutely wrong.
8171. What is your opinion of attempting to cultivate ? By all means cultivate. Let the Government
give every support to it, and give a bonus, or anything like that, with regard to that.
8175. Assuming that cultivation could be carried on successfully, would you suggest the closure of a'l
inshore beds and allow them to be offered for cultivation purposes? Undoubtedly, with the same resi-
dential conditions that are imposed in connection with ordinary land selection, so that you would get
peo| le to live there. History is only repeating itself with regard to the pearl-shell industry. Twenty
years ago Torres Strait, wherever you looked round the harbour, was dotted with residences. There was
what we called the Danish settlement on Prince of Wales Island, just opposite the Government
Kesidency. I hose men were all squeezed out by the reduced price of labour and the low price of shell.
817 G. By the Chairman : If cultivation could be successfully carried out, you would have families
engaged in the industry ? That is what I mean ; but you cannot get settlement of that kind until you
get the alien out of it. If there were 2CO boats engaged in the industry, it would be far better that they
should belong to fifty people than to five. The restriction of licenses simply tends to bring about a
monopoly. If it had not been for the removal of the restriction five or six years ago, Clark and Co. would
have owned every boat in Torres Strait before long.
8177. You are in favour of restricting the number of boats which can bo owned by one individual ? No ;
I think that is wrong, too.
8178. But you said it was an evil to have a small number of owners ? Ido not think we have advanced
far enough to cut out individual enterprise. Some day we may be able to do so, but not yet.
8179. Do yon think it would be a good thing for Torres Strait if one company owned all the boats ? You
have mistaken my meaning. 1 wars trying to combat any restriction on the number of licenses, not on
the number that any person could have. That is quite a different thing.
8180. But do you think it would be a good thing for Torres Strait if one company owned the lot ? But
they could not own the lot if there was no restriction to the number of licenses, because enterprise will
always come in wherever there is an opportunity of doing anything.
8181. By Mr. Bennett -. Is it your opinion that the industry in Torres Strait can carry any number of
boats ? Yes ; because as soon as they fail to make a living they will have to drop out.
8182. By the Chairman : Would not having an unlimited number of boats tend to deplete the beds ? Of
course it would, and the weaker people would have to drop out.
8183. Is not that a thing that should be guarded against? Ido not think socialism has got far enough
ahead for that yet.
818-1. By Mr. Douglas : What do you think of nationalising the industry and closing the beds for two or
three years, the Government to purchase the boats from the present owners? Ido not think Australia
has progressed far enough in socialism to start that yet. There are one or two big questions ahead. In
the first place, it is not an Australian industry.
8185. By Mr. Bennett: What is not ? Pearl-shelling.
818 G. By Mr. Douglas -. Does it not exist in Northern Territory and Western Australia? Yes; but
while aliens are engaged in it, it is not an Australian industry at all.


8187. But with a view to making it an Australian industry ? Ido not see why the Government should
step in.
8188. By Mr. Bennett : You want it to doit of itself? I think it will do it of itself. It has recuperated
so many times.
8189. After the beds were fished out ? As soon as the beds arc fished out the boats will stop fishing,
and the beds will recuperate, the same as they have done the last two or three years.
8190. Have you any evidence to produce in support of your statement that the beds have recuperated ?
Statistics prove it.
8191. What statistics ? The Customs statistics show that before the Clark combination went away the
average catch was 2} tons per boat per annum ; now the average is up to 3*- and 4 tons per boat.
8192. How many boats are fishing now. About 200.
8193. There are only 112—Ho you know how many were fishing when the average was 2|- tons per boat ?
I think there were about 350. Still, the thing regulates itself.
8194. Has the gross yield of shell materially increased in any one year within the last decade? No ;it
has kept very much about the same.
8195. Has there not been a steady decrease ? I daresay there has.
8190. Hoes that point to the recuperation of the beds ? They were fishing hard all the time in those days ?
8197. But you said the beds have recuperated several times? Well, they have recuperated.
8198. What evidence have you to show that they have recuperated ? Only common report.
8199. Official statistics show that the gross yield of shell per annum has steadily decreased —Ho you
prefer to take common report rather than official figures? The quantity of shell obtained has decreased,
because the number of boats engaged in the industry has decreased.
8200. How long is it since the number of boats decreased materially? It must be getting on for three
years, I suppose.
8201. Prior to those three years, did the take of shell increase or decrease ? It gradually decreased,
of course, because of the number of boats engaged in the industry.
8202. By Mr. Douglas: That was when the restriction on the licensing of boats was taken off ? There
was a big lot of boats built when the restriction was taken off.
8203. By Mr. Bennett: Is there anything else you would like to put before the Commission ? Ido not
think so.
John Renfrew Chaig, recalled :
8204. By the Chairman : You are in possession of a written statement prepared for presentation to the
Commission by Moynihan and Andreassen ? Yes ; I have a sworn statement to present to the
Commission.
8205. Will you present it? I would rather take a copy of it before Ido so. When will the sittings of
the Commission close ?
8206. To-day ? At what time ?
8207. The statement was sent to you to hand to the Commission ? Yes, it was.
8208. Was there any reservation about your taking a copy of it ? No; but it is advisable that I should
take a copy.
8209. Who thinks it advisable ? I do.
8210. What authority have you for saying that? My opinion. If I have not got a copy in time to
present the original to you this afternoon, I will post it to you.
8211. Andreassen informed the Commission at Port Bouglas that the document had been sent to you to
present to the Commission, and I ask you to present it now ? Well, I shall present it as soon as I get
a copy of it.
8212. You decline to present it now ? As soon as I get a copy, I say I shall do so.
8213. Ho you virtually decline to present it now —There was no reservation sent with it—You were
simply the medium of conveyance to the Commission? Yes; incase both the gentlemen were absent
from port.
8214. They are both absent, and you now fail to deliver it? You took Andreasseu’s evidence in Port
Douglas, 1 understand.
8215. You decline to deliver the document ? No ; I merely postpone the delivery thereof.
8210. The document is the property of the Commission; it was merely sent to you as the medium of
conveyance to the Commission, and you decline to produce it? No, Ido not.
8217. You must understand that the Commission will decline to receive the document after this ? 1 will
tender it, no matter what the Commission may do with it.
8218. We shall decline to receive it—you have been asked to tender it, and have refused ? I will tender
it in due course.
George Francis Hewar, Blacksmith and Bcche-de-mcr Boat-owner, examined:
8219. By the Chairman -. What are you ? A blacksmith.
8220. Are you interested in any other industry ? I own two boats engaged in the beche-de-mer industry, (
the “ Asahia” and the “Tieryo.”
8221. Are they registered in your name? Yes. \
8222. Are you the solo owner of the boats ? I am.
8223. Who is in charge of your boats ? A Japanese.
8224. Sadakane? Yes.
8225. Is he interested in the boats? No. He has an interest in the fish. He gets a “ lay” on the fish.
8226. If it is alleged here that the boats are his property, is that correct? It is not correct. The boats
are my property, and I found the money for them.
8227. And you employ him as man in charge ? Yes.
8225. Beyond that he has no interest ? No.
8229. The same man is mentioned as master of both boats ? He was signed on as master of the first
boat, and when the other was finished he took over the last one and another man was sent in charge of
the first boat.
8230. Y r ou have got licenses for both boats? Yes.
8231. The Japanese have no interest beyond a “lay” in the fish? That is all.

. 8232. And you declare that any assertion to the contrary is not true ? It is not true. The boats belong
to me.
8233. By Mr. Douglas: Do you find it profitable to work those boats now? The boats have not been in
this year, but I think it is profitable.
8234. Are the fish plentiful ? Tes, so far.
8235. Have you been out on the reefs yourself? Not on these reefs.
8236. You have been engaged in the beche-de-mer industry in Torres Strait? A little. I was in the
pearl-shell industry for a long time.
8237. You were employed on the pearling-grounds, and had your own vessel ? Yes.
8288. You worked in the industry personally P Yes.
8239. You have not done so in the beche-de-tner industry ? No.
8240. Your knowledge of the reefs is based on the reports made to you by the men in charge of your
vessels and on the quantity of fish they bring in ? That is so.
8241. Do you think the supply is getting scarcer on the reefs? Ido not think so. Ido not think it is
possible that the supply can got scarcer, because there is such a terrible amount of reefs—from Thursday
Island to Eockhampton, besides all the reefs outside the Barrier/ I surmise that the fish come up on
the reefs.
8242. Where do your two boats work principally ? I think they are working outside Bowen at present.
That is the last I heard of them, in May.
8243. The men in charge just go wherever they like ? Yea.
8244. Would you mind letting us know what is the basis of your agreement with the men —Is it similar
to that in operation at Thursday Island ? I think it is very similar.
8245. Do you pay them so much per ton of -fish ? Yes.
8246. And do you pay all the expenses of the boat ? Yes, to a certain extent. The expenses of the
boat and everything else come out of the fish first.
8247. How do you divide whatever balance remains ? They get their full half, and what is over, less
what I get allowed for the boats.
8248. Have you a written agreement with them ? No ; I never made any written agreement. It has
always worked all right. They get their money when the fish is sold and all expenses paid.
8249. The basis on which some of them work at Thursday Island is that the owner gets a “ lay ” ranging
from about £l5 to £3O a ton, according to the amount of fish obtained —Is that the basis on which you
work ? I get so much allowed for the use of the boats —so much a ton as a sort of “ lay.” I get £lO
a ton and a percentage on the fish.
8250. £lO a ton is the boat’s share ? Yes.
8251. By the Chairman: Do you furnish supplies when the boats go out? I pay for them. It comes
out of the fish.
8252. By Mr. Douglas : Would it be a fair question to ask what is the cost of a boat like yours ? They
are very expensive boats. They cost about £650 each.
8253. Were they built of local or imported timber? Of local timber. Mr. Lyons supplied all the
timber.
8254. Were they built by Japanese labour? Yes. They were not built to my order. I bought them
afterwards. I took them over and paid the money.
8255. To whose order were they built ? Ido not know. I bought them from the builder. You can see
the builder’s receipts and papers.
8256. Were the inducements in the way of obtaining fish sufficient to warrant your buying boats to go
into the industry last year ? Yes. The first half-year I worked last year I did fairly well.
8257. By the Chairman : Is it a fair question to ask how much you cleared from each boat last year ? I
only had the one boat last year. In January, last year, she brought in about 5 tons of fish for about
seven months’ work.
8258. And that left a good profit to you ? Yes.
8259. By Mr. Douglas: The price of beche-de-mer is lower now ? Yes. At that time it was £l4O a
ton. Now it is about £llO, as far as I can hear.
8260. By the Chairman: Lower than that H Is it?
8261. We heard at Cooktown that it was £9O a ton ? Then there will not be too much in it.
8262. By Mr. Douglas: Do you know whether the Japanese in charge of your boats pick up all the fish
they see on the reefs ? No ■ these fellows will only pick up the deep-sea black fish.
8263. But do they pick up small as well as large fish ? No; it is very large fish that I see coming in.
8264. You see all the fish they bring in ? Yes.
8265. Do you examine and weigh them? I weigh them all, I see some on the tops of the boxes. Ido
not empty them out.
8266. By the Chairman: ■Do you know, or have you heard, of any boats belonging to Japanese being
engaged in the industry? Not to my knowledge. I could not say.
8267. By Mr. Douglas: A suggestion has been made by a practical beche-de-mer fisherman that the reefs
might be closed for a couple of years to enable the fish to become more plentiful —How would that affect
you ? It Tvould fairly break me. All my capital is in these boats, and I have had to go to work until
their returns come in.
8268. If the reefs were closed, it would be a hardship to you ? It would fairly close me up.
8269. Are not the boats suitable for trading ? No; because they can carry nothing. Where could you
trade with them—they would not pay for tucker ; you could not use the boats for any purpose. But
how is it possible that the grounds can be getting skinned of fish with all the reefs from Thursday Island
to Eockhampton ? Where these boats are working, and all the reefs outside the Barrier, are alive with fish.
My men tell me that, with good weather, they can easily get a ton a boat per month; but they have very
bad weather, and the natives cannot dive until the sun is well up and the water is a bit warm.
8270. By the Chairman : Have you heard anything about the reefs being depleted owing to the number
of Japanese in the industry'? Only what I have read in the papers.
8271. Do you believe that? No ;I do not think it is possible that the small number of boats engaged in
the industry could deplete such an extent of reef.
8272. How many boats do you think there are in the industry ? Ido not know. • Probably there may
be forty or fifty altogether.
G. F. Dewar.
13 July, 1908.


8273. By Mr. Douglas : Of course, if the fishery were closed, your licenses would be available for tbe C
pearl-shell fishery ? I could not go up to Thursday Island to start pearl-shell fishing. I had a good deal f
of experience in the pearl-shelling industry, which was not very favourable. 1
8274. Still, you would have a market for your boats ? Tes, at a great loss.
8275. You think that the weather conditions in the middle of the year provide a natural protection for
the beche-de-mer in the cold weather in the south ? Tes. You cannot get the natives to work in the
cold weather.
8276. By the Chairman : Do you think the industry could be carried on by white men? Ido not know.
I suppose it could, but not nearly so profitably as these men can carry it on. I daresay there are some
white men who could carry it on as profitably as the Japanese, but you have to find them. I had experi-
ence of natives in pearl-shelling swimming diving boats. I would go out in the morning, and they would
say to me: “No good work'here, boss; we got dirty water.” Another time they would say : “No good
work here, boss; no shell here.” They cannot tell the Japanese that, because they do not ask the
natives if there are any fish on the reef. They go overboard themselves and look, and then they go to work.
8277. By Mr Douglas : How many years were you engaged in the pearl-shell industry in Torres Strait ?
I owned boats in Western Australia for eighteen months, and I was engaged on two occasions in Torres
Strait for about eighteen months.
8278. Did you ever try diving in Torres Strait yourself? I have done a lot of it. I was diving all the
time I was in Western Australia.
8279. Did it affect your constitution at all ? No, except that it made me a bit short-winded. But Ido not
suppose it makes other men short-winded. I had one or two experiences on the bottom. I got foul in a
, strong tide, and in struggling to clear myself I puffed like a dog, broken-winded. Ido not think it was
the diving itself that affected my wind.
8280. Were you diving from your own boat ? Yes.
8281. Did you find it profitable at that time ? Very profitable. We were only getting £9O and £lOO a
ton for our shell then, too.
8282. The supply of shell was very plentiful ? Tes. I have picked up 650 shell in a day. One man
picked up 900.
8283. What year was that? I really forget, it is so long ago. It was just at the time of the exodus of
Clark and Smith and all the others from Torres Strait.
8281. That was about 1885 ? Very likely it was about then.
8285. Do you think diving in Torres Strait is work that white men can undertake with reasonable
comfort, provided there is enough money in it for them ? I think so.
8286. Is it a risky occupation? Tes ; there is a certain amount of danger all the time.
8287. Are not some grounds more dangerous than others ? My word, yes. Of course I have had no
experience on these grounds out here. The grounds in Western Australia are very rough and hilly.
8288. What about the Old Ground in Torres Strait ? I have never been down there.
8289. You know there have been very few accidents there ? Yes.
8290. Would you call it risky diving there? No.
Edwaed Stigant Ghf.enfikld, Harbour Master, Mackay, and Inspector of Pearl-shell and
Beche-de-Mer Fisheries, examined :
8291. By the Chairman : What are you ? Harbour Master at Mackay.
8292. You are also Inspector of Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fisheries ? Tes. ‘
8293. Are there any boats licensed in Mackay under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act?
Only one. It does not do a great deal of beche-de-mer work. It does a little fishing for turtle and ■
dugong.
8294. Where ? Bound about the different islands.
8295. Do you think the Commission could get any information at Mackay that would be of assistance to
them ? I could not say definitely; but to the best of my knowledge there is nobody there who is greatly
interested in the industry.
8296. By Mr. Douglas : There are no practical beche-de-mer fishers there ? No.
8297. Any evidence we might get there would be of a hearsay character ? I think so. A large number
of boats have been going in there last year and this year, all manned by Japanese, and licensed from
Thursday Island. They merely come in from the reefs to put their bechc-dc-mor on shore for export.
8298. By the Chairman : Do you know whether Swain Beef has been depleted by the Japanese ?
From what I can hear, I believe there is not much beche-de-mer left there. They are working now away
to the north-east of the Percy Islands.
8299. With any success, so far as you know? This year up to date there have been 19 tons of fish
exported from Mackay that these men have brought in from there. Last year there were 24 tons.
8300. Are there any boats licensed at Bowen ? I could not tell you, but Ido not think there are.
8301. Did you make it known that the Commission would call at Mackay if there was any evidence
forthcoming? I told one or two that you were coming in.
8302. Did you hear any desire expressed by anybody to give evidence ? No. Nobody has ever come to
me of their own accord, and it was known that the Commission would be coming, as it was in the news-
papers.
Benjamin Hugh Ooii.vie, Sub-Collector of Customs, Cairns, examined :
8303. By the Chairman : What are you ? Sub-collector of Customs, stationed at Cairns. ]
8304. You have prepared a return showing the beche-de-mer vessels licensed at this port ? Yes.
8305. Will you tender it ? Tes. [ Document tendered. Vide Appendix XXIII.] ]
8306. There is one boat here, the “ Asahia,” the property of G. F. Dewar ? There are two boats belong-
ing to Dewar.
8307. Can you say whether he really is the owner or not ? I really believe he is. I have known George
Dewar for some years, and I have always found him a straightforward, honest man. Besides that, 1 have
his declarations of ownership in regard to the “ Asahia” and “ Tieryo.” [Documentsproduced and inspected
by the Commission.] He has also made a declaration under the Merchant Shipping Act.
8308. It has been stated in evidence that some of these boats are owned by Japanese, and that they use
white men to get licenses for them under some arrangement between themselves—Do you know anything
about that ? Ido not. Before a license is issued I also have the builder’s certificate.

?. 8309. By Mr. Douglas : Are the men on the boats engaged in your office ? No. That is done in the
. Shipping Ofliee, and I have nothing to do with it.
i. 8310. Then you are not aware of the basis on which the boats are worked by Dewar and the Japanese ?
No.
8311. You do not know the form of agreement ? No. lam neither Shipping Master nor Protector of
Aboriginals.
8312. By the Chairman: You merely produce these documents to prove that Dewar is the owner of
those tw T o boats, according to law? That is all; and that I have complied with the Pearl-shell and
Beche-de-Mer Fishery Act and the regulations thereunder.
8313. By Mr. Douglas: Is there any evidence you would like to give that you consider would be of
assistance to the Commission ? No ; I just try to carry out my instructions; that is all. If I saw
anything irregular, I should bring it under the notice of the head of the Department—that is the
Port Master—through my chief.
8314. By the Chairman : You have not noticed anything irregular while you have been here ? No.
8315. Bu Mr. Douqlas: Before you came to Cairns you were Sub-collector of Customs at Thursday
Island? Yes.
8316. Did you hear any suggestions there of an alleged system of dummying in connection with licenses ?
I heard rumours, but nothing tangible; but Ido not think it ever took place there. Anybody can make
a statement like that, but he cannot produce proof that an officer of the Department can work on. I, and
other officers before me, made careful inquiries into the truth of any allegations of the kind, but I know
of no such case myself.
8317. When did you leave Thursday Island ? July, 1906.
8318. Was shell plentiful at that time ? The catch was not so good as it had been previously.
8319. Y r ou were the officer administering the Immigration liestriction Act ? Yes.
8320. Were reasonable facilities given by the Commonwealth Government to the owners of boats to get
labour? - Very good indeed. lam quite certain that the Federal Government were only too pleased to
assist the industry to the full extent of their power, provided everything was safeguarded. They were
safeguarded by means of bonds of .£lOO for each man, and the men were carefully inspected by the
Customs officials. The bonds were always in order. All the time I was there I found the pearl-shellers
only too willing to do what was right, and to give every assistance they possibly could.
8321. It was in your time that a great number of the boats went to the Aroe Islands? Yes.
8322. Do you think that it was not particularly on account of excessive restrictions in regard to labour
that they went away? They broke new ground over there. Whether it was to benefit themselves I
cannot say. The catch was not good, and the seasons had been bad for two or three years before that.
8323. The official figures showed a decline in the average catch ? Yes.
8324. Since the Commonwealth Government have taken over the Customs the licenses have been issued
by the Customs—Do you think it would bo better to have the whole of the licenses issued from the
Shipping Office ? It would save the Customs a lot of work, but Ido not see any advantage that would be
gained. As Sub-collector of Customs 1 would like the work to be taken away and handed over to a State
officer who would be responsible to the State itself.
8325. The Shipping Master is also Inspector of the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-Mer Fisheries, and if the
work were all placed under his charge he would know exactly which vessels were licensed and which
were not ? I think that would be an advantage.
8326. By the Chairman : Pearl-dealers’ licenses are issued by the Police Magistrate—Would it not be
more convenient if they also were issued by the Shipping Master ? I think it would be more convenient.
There would be no divided authority at all then. You would have your inspectors to inspect outside; but I
think the Shipping Master and Inspector should be the senior officer ; the other should be his deputy.
8 (27. Do you think there is enough work for a deputy inspector ? I certainly do.
8328. By Mr. Dougins: Is there anything else you would like to suggest ? No.
Archibald Carswell, Marine Diver, examined:
8329. By the Chairman : What are you ? A diver.
8330. Are you engaged in the pearl-shell or the bechc-dc-mer industry ? No.
8331. By Mr. Dougins: Do you wish to submit any evidence ? Nothing particular.
8332. By the Chairman : The object of the Commission is to inquire into the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer
industries, and among other things to ascertain how to make the industries more attractive and
remunerative for white men ? That is exactly the object lam here for.
8333. Have you been engaged in any other industry ? I have been engaged in diving.
8334. By Mr. Douglas: AVhat diving have you been engaged in ? The examination of submarine walls,
bridge construction, and that sort of thing.
8335. For how long ? Twelve or fourteen years.
8336. Have you any idea of going into the pearl-shell industry? If sufficient inducement offered, I
certainly would.
8337. If you could earn enough money? Yes, without a doubt.
8338. By the Chairman : What depths have you been in the habit of diving ? At the work I have been
engaged in they work shifts of four hours, in 90 feet of water.
8339. Apparently the work has not injured your health? No, it has not.
8340. Do you think the industry could be carried on by white men without doing them injury?
Undoubtedly.
8341. Have you been diving in the tropics ? This is the furthest North that I have dived.
8342. How long have you been in Cairns? I have been here about three years. I have worked farther
South for Mr. Willcocks and for the Government at odd jobs.
8343. Have you any knowledge of the system on which diving for pearl-shell is carried on ? A r es, from
men who have worked with me.
8344. Have you seen any of the luggers ? Yes. In Cooktown I have seen a thousand of them.
8345. Have you been in Cooktown, too h Yes.
8346. Do you think those boats would bo attractive enough to induce you and other marine divers to go
in for pearl-shelling ? Yes; provided that the remuneration was commensurate with the work.
8347. Would you be prepared to engage in the industry in Torres Strait in the event of the supply of
shell becoming more plentiful than it is at present ? Yes.

LETTER FROM THE GOVERNMENT RESIDENT, THURSDAY ISLAND, TO THE UNDER SECRETARY,
CHIEF SECRETARY’S DEPARTMENT, BRISBANE (25th AUGUST, 100«), m }th' PROPAGATION AND
CULTIVATION OF PEARL-OYSTER.
Residency, Thursday Island,
25th August, 1900.
Sir, —In respect to a letter from the Torres Shire Council, addressed to the Hon. the Premier, and
forwarded to me for a confidential report thereon, 1 have the honour to advise as follows; —
That the industry in its present state requires placing on a different footing to which it is at present is
indubitable. Most of the well-to-do pearl-shellers have left for other beds, where the mother-of-pearl shell
is found in greater quantities (though of inferior quality), and where labour is abundant, and also where
no restrictions are placed in the employment of such. This move necessitated the outlay in the first instance
of a considerable amount of capital, which the smaller men have been unable to find, and, unless .some means
can be found to render the prosecution of the industry profitable in those waters, those few remaining men
must succumb, owing, in the first place, to the low price ruling in the home markets for their produce ; and,
in the second place, to the temporary and partial depletion of the more accessible beds requiring them to
go further afield into more exposed waters in search of the shell. The prevailing high winds render this a
most precarious and hazardous task, the vessels (whose up-keep continually goes on) lying idle for weeks at
a time. That a new system of prosecuting the industry can bo adopted with success I am confident (as
pointed out in my Annual Reports for 1901 and 1905, and also in my letters of 15th July, 1905, and 8th
August, 1900, to which I again refer you), and that is by propagation and cultivation. I am satisfied,
moreover, that the experimental stage for either is passed, it having been clearly demonstrated by Air.
.Saville Kent, and also by Mr. Tosh (vide my Report for 1904) that either or both are feasible, so that 1
consider that, in lieu of an experimental station, as asked for by the Shire Council, the Government should
carry out the scheme (for which plans, as I understand, were’ prepared years ago) of starting a hatchery at
Wai Weer Island, where the spat (some 75 per cent, of the many millions that are now lost or wasted) could
be saved, and distributed in a few months to the owners of secured areas, where they could be deposited and
allowed to grow to be collected at any time without expense, and so dispensing with the alien labour to man
the boats altogether.
A small charge for these immature shells could be made, and the establishment of a nursery would
soon be self-supporting. Immense areas suitable for the growth of flic shell are available in Torres Straits.
Every small island is surrounded by a reef, the boundaries of which are clearly defined, and could be leased
on easy terms, the lessee {who should not be an alien) living on the island, or forming a small station there,
from which the beds could be watched and cared for, so that in a few years a resident white population would
be settled on the numerous islands, and Thursday Island itself become the centre of a thriving and prosperous
community. Should a steamer be placed here, fittings could be easily, and at but little cost, placed on her
to enable small and immature shell to be removed from the more exposed bods when opportunity offered
(i.e., when the weather permitted) to the secured areas, and the expenses of removal would be met by the
owners of the leases. Should this be carried out, the whole industry would bo revolutionised, and, instead’of
the product pouring in to meet a glutted market, the shell could remain safe and secure until required for
exportation. It is believed, also, now that the fish itself, if dried like beche-de-mer or tinned, would moot
with a ready market in the East, and probably would realise some £00 to £80 per ton; also that the chips
from the shell prepared for market, by being ground up, can be utilised for many things and become a
valuable commodity; this could easily be done on the islands where the shell would bo opened and would
materially enhance the profits of the business. 1 am informed that Mr. Saville Kent is shortly expected
in these waters to carry on and superintend the business on behalf of a small company he has formed
in England, and I have but little doubt his services could be obtained .to start the industry on the
lines I have laid down, to be carried on eventually by a competent and practical man, such as could be found
here. Air. Kent’s own experience with Lever Brothers has practically shown that the live shell can bo
transported with safety some 3,000 miles, and also by a process known to himself, that pearls can be grown
in the shell. Some few shells were exported lately to New Caledonia, to stock the bods there, and already
a button factory has been started there by an enterprising Frenchman. An attempt is now being made to
start a similar factory in Australia, in which venture the shellers arc prepared to invest, believing that if a
local market can bo found for their shell, the evil effects of the ring now so strong in London could be
counteracted. It will probably be asked, if this new method of prosecuting the industry is likely to be so
profitable, why was it not adopted before? and 1 think the answer is that, up to now there has been to a
groat extent a monopoly amongst a few wealthy firms, who, through being supplied with plenty of means,
wore able to prosecute it under the old methods with some degree of success, and, having so much of their
capital sunk in the requisite plant, were naturally disinclined to adopt measures that would render such as
but of little more value than old scrap iron, and also knowing that if scientific cultivation were adopted the
industry woidd be thrown open to any individual who could devote the time to it, and who could afford to
live until the shell has matured—say some four to five years—whereas the smaller man has been crushed out
owing to the speculative nature of the business under the old system.
Some additional or amending legislation would probably be necessary if these views are adopted, as
now shell found in Queensland waters of a lesser size than 5 inches cannot be “removed.” The areas leased
would have to be protected, and the question settled as to whether the mother-of-pearl oyster is an “oyster”
within the meaning of section 390 of the Criminal Code (and so a thing capable of being stolen), and if
possible the provisions of 51 Vic. No. 1 (Federal Council Act) extended, as now it is held that the State has
no control over the waters outside the 3-mile limit, except in cases of certain offences as laid down in the
said Act.
I have, &c.,

No. 2.
LETTER FROM THE GOVERNMENT RESIDENT, THURSDAY ISLAND, TO THE UNDER SECRETARY,
THE TREASURY (21st JANUARY, 1907), SUGGESTING CERTAIN AMENDMENTS IN THE PEARL-
SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER FISHERY ACT.
Residency, Thursday Island,
21st January, 1907.
k IR > —In reply to your letter of 17th December, 1906, addressed to the Portmaster, a copy of which
was forwarded to me, in which you ask, in view of the Treasurer’s intention to introduce a Fisheries Dill
next session, for any suggestions for the fostering and development of the pearl-shell industry, I beg to offer
the following on detached sheets.
I have, &c.,
The Under Secretary, The Treasury, Brisbane.
HUGH MILMAN
Government Resident.
SUGGESTIONS FOR FOSTERING AND DEVELOPMENT OF PEARL-SHELL INDUSTRY.
In the interpretation clause “Inspector of Fisheries” should be defined.
“ Fisheries” should include turtle-shell and any other marketable commodity recovered from the sea.
“Australian waters”—If the provisions of the Bill can be extended to the area defined in the Federal
Council Act of 1888, it will materialy aid in the administration of the Act when it becomes law.
Where in the existing Acts power is given to the Collector of Customs to do any act, now the Collector
is a Federal officer, it will be desirable to substitute the Shipping Master in his place.
Licenses for boats are now granted to any person qualified to hold one without restriction to numbers.
I think this matter of licensing should be left to a licensing board or authority, so that in the event of a
falling-off in the take that can be attributed to (and doubtless has been contributed by in the past) the
grounds being over-fished, a limitation may bo placed on the number of boats that may be licensed. Since
the number of boats engaged in fishing has decreased, the average take per boat for the last six months has
more than doubled. The licensing board or authority should also have power to close any areas for such time
as they may think fit, and any boat found within that area with diving gear on board, the person in charge
of such boat may be imprisoned for any period not exceeding twelve months. This provision would relieve
the employer from the Illegal acts of his servant, and would effectually prevent any poaching on closed areas.
As the Act stands at present, the provision for closing areas is quite inoperative, as it is practically impossible
to secure a conviction for a breach of it.
As shell or beche-de-mer, pearls, and blisters in small quantities are constantly being stolen by members
of the crew of the boats engaged in the fisheries and brought on shore and sold, it is most desirable that any
person in whoso possession mother-of-pearl shell, pearls, blisters, or beche-de-mer are found, may be called
upon by an inspector of fisheries or officer of police to account from whom he received it; and, failing to
account satisfactorily, the same may be seized and disposed of as may be directed by the bench, and such
person may be liable to six months’ imprisonment.
Pearl Dealer’s License.
Provision should be made in regulations for keeping books recording full particulars of each transaction,
no selling or buying after sunset, books to be open to police or Inspector of Fisheries. As Act at present
stands, the Police Magistrate at Thursday Island cannot reasonably refuse a license to any person of good
character and reputation. At certain times of the year this island is visited by respectable people, who
come here to-day, take out a license, and are gone to-morrow, having possibly purchased pearls worth a very
considerable amount. For this all the country gets is £25 for the license, while the bond fide dealer lives here,
has to pay income tax, and contributes in other ways to the well-being of the State. I would suggest that
the cost of a license to any person who has not resided at Thursday Island continuously for the previous twelve
months be, say, £100, or perhaps more.
As the knowledge that the present system of procuring the pearl-shell is not to be relied on is gaining
ground with the shellers themselves, and they are all coming round to the belief that the only way they can
carry on their business to make a success of it is by cultivation, so if under the proposed Bill a really scientific
Chief Inspector of Fisheries was appointed, it is very apparent to me that the industry would benefit largely,
in that he would be able to teach the shellers how to save and confine a considerable portion of the vast
numbers of spat that now drift away to inaccessible waters, and also how to remove safely immature shell
that they may desire to stock their leased areas with. I am confident that if the Government started a
hatchery at Wai Weer Island, by the sale of the immature shell it would bo more than self-supporting in a
very short period.
Leased Areas for Cultivation Purposes.
Lease should be for not less than ten years, with option of renewal for a similar period, that poaching
should be stopped by the same means as suggested for “closed areas.” Regulations should provide for
continuous cultivation— i.c., removal of small shell to area leased. No aliens should be allowed to lease areas.
57 Vie. No. 7 provides for deductions from seamen’s wages for hospital treatment. Under that
Act the employer is relieved of his responsibility for the care of his men when sick. The employers contribute
but a mere trifle to the institution; many of them, though employing 100 or more men, giving only
their £1 per annum to qualify them for a vote. In the employment of natives from Papua, where no similar
provision exists as is contained in our Act, those employers who engage this class of labour recognise their
responsibility by contributing Is. per month for each man engaged. Why should they not do so for other
classes of labour ? H. M.

Dear Sir, —Having seen a notice in one of our papers here about the Japanese divers being on strike,
and suggesting the sending of young men of British extraction to Thursday Island, where they would become
professional divers in a*few months, an old school chum and myself thought wo might do worse than to get
into communication with someone who could inform us as to the pay, &c., we would be likely to make, and

LETTER FROM THE GOVERNMENT RESIDENT, THURSDAY ISLAND, TO THE UNDER SECRETARY
CHIEF SECRETARY’S DEPARTMENT (21sr FEBRUARY, 1908), RELATIVE TO TRAINING AND
EMPLOYMENT OF WHITE DIVERS.
Residency, Thursday Island,
21st February, 1908.
Sib, — The strike of the Japanese divers, or rather the lock-out of the shellers, came to an end about
three weeks ago, the owners, for lack of labour to replace the Japanese, having come to fresh terms with the
latter on slightly better conditions than those that they had been working under during the past year.
Inquiries have been received here from likely men (fishermen and ex-naval men) from Victoria and New
Zealand, as to what inducement could be offered to them to come here to take the place of the Japanese,
and a reply has been sent them that once they become proficient as divers and used to the waters, really
good wages could be guaranteed them, varying together with a share in the pearls obtained of from £200 to
£400 per annum. The speediest method to obtain this most desirable form of labour would be for the
Government to tit out a vessel, place a good and experienced white diver in charge, and let these men acquire
their experience under him. The cost per annum would be to run such a vessel about £500, against which
the value of the shell obtained would be set, and a charge could also be made for a certificate of competency.
It may be said that if the facts are as stated, “ Why do not the employers start a vessel for the purpose
of training divers?” The principal reason why they do not is that they cannot afford to do so, and also
that if attempted by an individual or an individual firm, he or ft would certainly be boycotted by the
Japanese, on whom they are, under present conditions, dependent for the employment of their capital. A
vessel suitable for the purpose of a school could be hired for £10 per month, and a suitable man as instructor
is now here, at present employed as master of the coal hulk. The vessel could be used as tender to the
steamer (on arrival of the latter), and looked after by her, so ensuring her (the vessel’s) constant
employment.
I have, &c.,
The Under Secretary, Chief Secretary’s Department, Brisbane.

NUMBER OF MAINLAND ABORIGINALS AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDERS WORKING ON BECHE-

MEASUREMENT.
Office of the Shipping Master and Inspector of Fisheries, &c.,
Thursday Island, 15th June, 1908.
Sir, —In compliance with your lequest, I have the honour to state that on the 13th instant there were
141 mainland aboriginals working on beche-de-mer boats under articles signed at this office, and in all 138
Torres Strait islanders working under articles signed at this office.
During this year I find that approximately the quantity of “ AA,” or “pair” shell (5rinch) exported
amounts to 3 per cent., and the quantity of “A” shell (5j-inch) to about 10 per cent, of the total amount
of shell exported.
I have, &c.,

APPENDIX VIII.
No. 1.
THE PEARL SHELLING INDUSTRY.
(Reprinted from the Torres Straits Pilot of 28th July, 1906.)
We continue our remarks in connection with the shelling industry, in the hope of creating a lively
interest in its development and progress, as well as to secure relief from the present stagnant position in
which shellers and residents find themselves.
Cultivation. —Cultivation is impeded by the lack- of sufficient protective legislation in the matter of
areas leased, as seen by the decision of Judge Noel in the case of the Pilot Cultivation Company against
certain men, on a charge of stealing shell from the company’s leased area in Friday Island Passage.
Legislation Required. —Twelve months’ imprisonment, without power to reduce or to substitute fine,
to anyone trespassing upon or within any proclaimed or leasehold areas set apart for cultivation of the pearl-
oyster. One conviction should be a sufficient deterrent.
Propagation of pearl-oyster is not now' in initiatory stages; it is an accomplished fact. It has been
proved beyond doubt by experts in several cases. Saville Kent’s and Tosh’s reports clearly support this; but
the most particular instance to be quoted is Lever Brothers’ successful transportation, for 2,000 miles, of live
shell under Saville Kent’s direction and supervision.
Areas suitable for cultivation and bringing small shell-to marketable maturity should be selected and
marked off.
Permits. —Government, it is suggested, should grant extra permits to a limited number of the existing
pearlers, who would be prepared and undertake, at a reasonable price, to collect and supply the Government
wdth live pearl-oysters, undersized or otherwise.
Collecting Vessel. —Government to provide a suitable steamer or motor vessel, properly fitted, for
collecting the live pearl-shell oysters from the diving boats on the pearling grounds outside the 3-mile limit,
and to bring them within the 3-mile limit.
Grading. —The live oysters then to be graded as to size and quality, and to be deposited in the
proclaimed areas, in water, say, from 6 inches to 4 fathoms at low tide. By such grading and classification the
shell would come to maturity in separate sections or areas as deposited.
Royalty. —An area or section, when matured, could be leased out by the Government at a certain
royalty per ton of shell. Should there bo more than one applicant within a time to be advertised, then the
area or section should be put up to auction in the usual way.
Interest and Redemption. —These royalties would be regulated so as to pay the interest and redemption
on money expended by the Government. The royalty on an area known to be good pearl-producing ground
would be set considerably higher than on an ordinary area.
Residence.— Preference concessions should be given to European applicants residing on the mainland
or islands within the pearl-shelling areas of Queensland.
Returns —By purchasing pearl-shell oysters of all sizes and placing them within expert-approved areas,
the Government would have the satisfaction of commencing to obtain a substantial return by way of royalties
within twelve months, or eighteen months at the outside, from the shell that had matured during that time,
and so on, from one graded lot to another, with even greater certainty than from a sugar or wheat crop. As
to the rapid and prolific growth of pearl oysters, reference need only be made to the experts’ reports.
Spat.—On the areas as indicated could be constructed approved obstacles, &c., for the retention of
spat.
Hatcheries. —In addition, the Government would have hatcheries and experimental stations presided
over by an expert.
Private Enterprise.— The Government would in twelve months, or even in a less time, be in a position
to supply chicken pearl oysters from the areas and experimental farms or hatcheries to private individuals,
for the purpose of cultivation on leased areas coming under the stringent protection above suggested. A
nominal charge could be made at first for the chicken oyster. Reasonable regulations should be contained
in leases. Provisions preventing monopoly and limiting the size and number of areas held by one person or
company should be rigidly enforced.
Manufacturing Buttons, Etc. —Concessions and support could be given to individual holders of areas
who procured small button-making machines and worked them, or who held a certain number of shares in a
large Australian pearl-shelling manufacturing plant. The Government could communicate with the Agent-
General, in London, and get him to obtain detailed information for its own and public information respecting
the working up of pearl-shell into buttons and other articles, and procure from manufacturers of pearl-shell
269
APPENDICES TO EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE THE PEARL-SHELL AND BECHE-DE-MER ROYAL COMMISSION.


cutting machinery catalogues thereof. Messrs. Mnnn and Co., of the Scientific American, New York,
could bo communicated with for the like purpose. The Government Commercial Agent could also he notified
to look out for a market for pearl-shell in the Far Fast.
Protection. - A further protective tariff is scarcely required. The duty on manufactured plain pearl-
shell articles is 20 per cent. ; on pearl-shell articles, gold or silver mounted, it is 25 per cent. The costs,
charges, and expenses of cleaning, packing, oases, freight, wharfage, insurance, commissions, brokerage, &c.,
amount to about 20 per cent. ; so it will be seen that under these conditions little or no further protection
would bo required by a local manufacturer. The importation of partially-manufactured articles would,
however, require to bo watched.
“ White Australia.” —Shell gathered from the deeper areas and placed in water from a few inches
to 5 feet or 0 feet deep at low tide could be tended and the shell inspected by Europeans ; cleaned if necessary,
and artificially' fed, and the spat artificially caught or retained; and when the time for collecting the oyster
arrives any sound European could go down in a diving'dress, and remain five or six hours at a time without
being distressed, even if he had never been down before. With a small button-making machine the owner of
an area and his wife and family could keep themselves employed during their spare time, and, while watching
and protecting and tending the pearl-oysters, would be enabled to live on the shore adjacent to their area.
By this means a prosperous European population would be secured to the islands adjacent to North
Queensland, every one of them revenue producers and payers. They would be permanently “put on the
land,” and the rates and taxes paid by them, to say nothing of the royalties, should justify the outlay by
the Government without delay of at least To,ooo in purchasing the necessary pearl-oysters to stock a sufficient
number of reserved areas, and a further like sum on up-to-date manufacturing machinery. Recent reports
are that there is a pearl-shell manufacturing plant just erected at Noumea, which cost £4,000; there is also
one at Manila, and one is to be started at Bobo, Dutch Netherlands. These facts speak for themselves.
Live Shull Excokts. —ln dune last a French gentleman named Rolot took away' a quantity of live
pearl-oysters to Noumea for cultivation purposes. About two years ago Messrs. Lover Brothers took away a
special shipment of live pearl-oysters to the South Seas for propagation and cultivation, under the direction
and supervision of -Mr. Savillo Kent, the success of which experiment is undoubted. As to the removal of live
pearl-oysters from Torres Strait to alien waters for propagation and cultivation purposes, the immediate anti
serious attention of the Government should be given to it, inasmuch as it opens the field to competition on
the part of foreigners at little cost to themselves and with the almost certain result of inflicting great and
permanent injury to the industry within this State ; and no person should be permitted to transport live
pearl-oysters without first being compelled to pay a charge commensurate with the benefits likely to be
derived, it being an undoubted and absolutely incontrovertible fact that no better shell than that found in
Torres Strait waters is obtainable elsewhere.
General. —The great source of wealth and revenue the pearl-shelling industry has been to the State
may be ascertained on reference to the Customs returns in the past, which show that the export value of
pearl-shell since records have been kept, and independent of the value of pearls of which no record can be
kept, is approaching £6,000,000. From the figures to be found in the returns, the expenditure or outlay by
the Government to foster and place upon a sound and strong financial base what has been one of the largest,
most prolific, and remunerative callings in the Slate, even under the past expensive and wasteful working of
the pearl-shell beds and banks, would be more than justified ; and, from a financial standpoint, would prove
almost from its inception not only interest-paying but redemption-paying as well.
Jt might be possible, in connection with the Bill to promote closer settlement, to be submitted to the
Legislature this session, to immediately take action to request the Government to insert a clause in the
measure providing for facilities of this nature in connection with the pearl-shelling industry; and with this
object the local bodies should take the earliest opportunity of conveying to the Premier resolutions passed
by them bearing on the matter.
The suggested scheme will in no way interfere with the existing methods of working the industry, and
the vessels now engaged in it will still be necessary to successfully cope with all phases, and for collecting
shell from (he deep-water areas and transporting them to the cultivation areas. The vessels are an absolute
necessity for (he efficient and successful carrying out of the scheme, when supplemented by a steam or motor
collecting vessel.
Should the Government grant the present pearlers a further license to procure undersized shell for
Government cultivation purposes, the opening of undersized shell on (he fishing boats by the divers and crew
to look for pearls, and the subsequent throwing overboard of the shell, owing to it being undersized, would
be at an end, as there would be a purchaser in the Government in the first instance, and subsequently in
leaseholders of areas.
As all the pearl-shell is now obtained by the European-owned boats outside the 3-mile limit, the scheme
proposed removes a considerable quantity of pearl oysters from waters over which the State or Commonwealth
has no powor or control, so far as any foreign Power or vessel is concerned, to waters within the 3-mile limit,
over which the State would have full and ample powers, and the shell woidd bo the property of the Queensland
Government, and not open to bo worked by any foreign Power or subject as above shown.
One of the many benefits to be derived from having the pearl-oyster in cultivation beds would be that
shell could bo taken as required and put on the market, fresh and in such quantities as would meet the
demand and regulate the marked prices: and (he stock in the beds would be further maturing and increasing
instead of deteriorating. Another profitable source of local progress could be improved and advanced by the
expert in charge directing his attention also to beche-de-mer, turtle, and sponges.
Jt is contended that the owner of an area carefully cultivated and tended would, out of the pearls
alone, be able to maintain and keep himself, wife, and family, and pay a substantial royalty or rent and all
expenses in connection with the propagation, and the proceeds to be derived from the sale of shell would be
clear profit; or the shell proceeds would pay all expenses and the value of pearls would be profit. However,
pearls being at present an unknown quantity, until science can solve the problem of production, the lease-
holders must trust to chance for pearls and bigger returns.
The owner of pearl-shell beds would be in a position to take orders for a definite quantity of shell to
be delivered at a particular time, and would not require to collect the shell until he could dispose of it. He
would not be subject to the frequent and usual adverse weather conditions. There would bo no necessity for
him to be at the mercy of the brokers and buyers, and while awaiting a satisfactory price, his sheU would be
increasing in size, and, consequently, becoming more valuable. Moreover, all that he would require to sell
would be sufficient to meet absolute requirements, and his market would bo assured.
At the present time, under existing circumstances, it costs the pearler at the least £llO per ton to put
his shell on the market, and he gets absolutely none of the pearls. TTnder the cultivation system the cost of
production would be very considerably reduced.


The result of the financial and other assistance given by the Government to Torres Strait Islanders
during the past two years, in purchasing some seventeen to twenty vessels, now in use in the pearl-shell and
becho-de-mer fisheries, has proved a bright, financial success, to judge by recent statements in the (jumis-
lamlrr, it being shown there (hat the natives will have paid off by the end of the current year all moneys
advanced by the Government to purchase the vessels, and these will then be the absolute property of the
island natives. This is an illustration of (ho value of marine produce in the Straits and a further substantial
argument that the Government should foster and do everything in its power to protect and develop, under
export guidance, the industry of a district that has in the comparatively short time of its existence produced
and exported in pearl-shell alone, not to mention pearls, beche-de-mer, and turtle-shell, a value of several
millions sterling. By doing so under a system as outlined herein they would build up a numerous population
of Europeans, with comfortable homes, in a climate which compares more than favourably with any other part
ot Australia or elsewhere, and would remove almost entirely the marked phase of temporary residence in
Torres Strait hitherto so noticeable. On a revenue basis alone the industry is fully entitled to the Govern-
ment’s expenditure of ten times the moderate amount above suggested. A reference to the Customs returns
of this port will give ample verification of the statement; and, in view of the white Australia policy and the
difficulty existing through coloured labour restrictions imposed since it was inaugurated; in view of the present
depressed state of the industry in consequence of this desire to keep the country white and all its industries
in the white men’s hands; in view of the threatened ruin of those who first were permitted to engage in
shelling and now have had difficulties thrust so quickly upon them; in view of the immense prospect of
progress and of developing settlement in Torres Strait, it is not too much but only fair to ask and to receive
the small measure of aid necessary to lift the affairs of this part of the world out of the hole in which they
have been placed.
No. 2.
PEARL-SHELL CULTIVATION.
(Reprinted from the Torres Straits I'ilot, 18th August, 1906.)
Financial Asckct.
Just a few figures in connection with the cultivation of the pearl-shell oyster.
Taking 6,000 pearl-shell of from 1 inch up to 0 inches to make up 1 ton;
That 2,000 of G-inch shell to make 1 ton;
That out of the 0,000 there would be a proportion of 1,200 shell of 1 inch, and the same number of 2,
3,1, and 5 inches;
Say, 2 tons of pearl-oyster shells of the various sizes be placed in reserved areas, it will be seen that
should the 5-inch shell grow but 1 inch more in twelve months, 1 1-5 ton will have become marketable, and
worth, at the lowest market price, £BO per ton at Thursday Island.
The 4-inch shell at this time will have become 5-inch, and at the end of a further twelve months, from
the time of the maturing of the first lot, will in turn have become marketable; and so on down to the 1-inch
oyster, which will be increasing in size at a surprising rate. Bead Saville Kent’s report published in 1890,
which says:—“By the end of six months some of the samples of pearl-shell oyster had added as much as
half an inch to the free border of their shells, and in almost all instances lappet-like prolongations of new
shell were produced throughout, a corresponding rapidity of growth taking place in the young shells having
a diameter of 2or 3 inches.” From the above it will be seen that after the first twelve months at the very
outside from the time of placing the pearl-shell oysters within the areas, there would be a total marketable
crop of 0 tons during five years from the 2 tons of shell originally placed in the area, showing an increase in
weight of 4 tons’for the period.
As there are in the 5-inch areas or beds 2,400 oysters from the 2 tons— 1,200 oysters from each ton, as
above set forth--and it takes 2,000 of the 6-inch shell to make 1 ton, we obtain from the 5-inch shell area
1 1-5 (on, and so on proportionately down to the 1-inch oyster.
Then wo have five areas each producing 11-5 ton, which totals 6 tons of shell for five years.
Six tons at bed-rock price, say £BO per ton ... ... ... ... ... ... £4BO
Less paid to pearl-shellers fur 2 tons at, say, £lOO per ton on the grounds ... 200
£2BO
If 2 tons give £2BO, then 20 tons will give £2,800
Deduct as under- -
1--Cost of bringing in 20 tons pearl-shell oysters from grounds outside 3-mile
limit to cultivation area ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... £2OO
2 -Proportionate part of wages of caretaker for five years. He would be able to
look after, say, 100 tons of oysters, and his wages, amounting to £l5O a year
for five years, would be £750, gives us the proportionate part of wages ... 150
3 Proportionate part of interest and redemption money on £5,000 advanced
by Government at, say, £5O a year for live years 250
4 Say for collecting 20 tons matured shell from areas at £lO per ton ... ... 200
5 Proportionate part towards expert’s salary, say £5O a year for five years ... 250
6 Proportionate, part, towards interest and redemption money on cost of
machinery and plant for manufacturing pearl buttons, Ac., say £3O a year
for five years ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 150
7 For interest and redemption money on cost of steamer for transporting pearl-
shell oysters from the grounds to beds, Ac., say £5O a year for five years
(Note that £lO per ton has already been charged to transport) ... ... 250
8— -Allowance for loss through mortality, Ac., say 10 per cent, (but this will be
more than compensated by the catch of spat from the 20 tons, and should
not be deducted from the net profits) ... ... ... ... ... ... 220
£1,670
Bed-rock profit £1,130
Say we allow the pearl-shellers an extra £6 10s. per ton to ensure extra care in collecting the pearl-shell
oyster, this would bo provided for out of the odd £l3O of profits, and leave a bed-rock profit of £l,OO0 —that
is, £2OO a ybar for five years on 20 tons of pearl-shell oyster, after providing' for every possible contingency

and making provision for interest and redemption money on manufacturing plant, which is certainly not
chargeable to cultivation, but by right to manufacture. The provision has been made, however, to show that
the expenditure of, say, £5,000 on machinery would be financially justifiable.
It will be observed that no allowance has been made for profits arising from pearls, which at times are
a very considerable item.
There must also be taken into consideration the indirect profit resulting—namely, the spat to be
caught in the first instance from the 20 tons of oysters deposited in the cultivation areas, and so on
ad infinitum. . Concerning spat, see Saville Kent’s report of 1890, and the Thursday Island Government
Resident’s report for 1901. In the latter is found the statement—“ It is estimated that every second pearl-
oyster produces 5,000,000 spat in its native state annually,” and other interesting and important facts
concerning the industry.
By-products should be made to further increase the profits. The fish, at present thrown away, could
be turned into a valuable manure, and the fragments of pearl-shell into complexion powders, &o.
The foregoing figures and data are given to show the financial aspect of the pearl-shelling industry from
the cultivation standpoint; to show conclusively that a White Australia may be established, even at Thursday
Island, and that good may come out of evil, the despised and unfortunate coloured races becoming the means
of permanently placing an European population on the shores of Torres Strait.
From the foregoing it will also be seen that with the care of the industry under a scientific expert, and
the expenditure of a moderate sum, numerous families would be able to make individually the nice profit of
£200 a year for five years, from 20 tons of shell as above, and afterwards from the recultivation which would
take place during the five years.
The Government should be very particular in the selection of the class and quality of the shell brought
in for cultivation purposes, and particularly so in the initiatory stages, and if necessary give even as much as
£150 per ton for undersized shell. This could come out of the £1,000 profit abovementioned, and there would
still be the value of pearls and by-products to the good. Probably arrangements could be made with the
shellers to bring in the pearl-shell oysters for the Government from the grounds outside the 3-mile limit to
the protected areas at a reasonable remuneration. If this could be arranged, the big expenditure for a
steamer would be saved. However, a steamer would ensure despatch and more careful handling; but this
would be a matter of detail for the expert.
The Government never requires to make a profit out of money advanced to an industry over and above
interest and redemption money, and with its assistance there is every certainty of success.
All interested in shelling are invited to carefully peruse and criticise the foregoing figures.

LETTER FROM T. J. FARQUHAR TO THE HON. THE TREASURER (22nd FEBRUARY, 1908), RELATIVE
TO SUBSTITUTION OF WHITE FOR COLOURED DIVERS.
Thursday Island,
22nd February, 1908.
The Hon. the Treasurer, Brisbane.
Dear Sir, —Owing to publication of the trouble we have here with Japanese divers in the pearl-
shelfing industry, numerous letters are being received from white men in the different States and from New
Zealand asking for information and expressing a desire to go into the business. The writer and other employers
here would gladly welcome white divers and tenders, and see no reason why suitable men should not be given
a chance. It would be ruinous to any employer to discharge the Japs and engage raw men in their place, so
a feasible scheme to bring the change about is that the Government establish a school for divers—that is to
say, hire or buy a diving boat, and put in charge a competent white ex-diver (such are to be procured here)
to teach candidates the work of diving and the conditions they can work under, such as tides, localities,
different nature of sea bottom, Ac.; on being given a certificate of competency from the man in charge they
would be given charge of a diving boat, and would soon oust the Japs. Employers are willing to work on a
co-operative basis, and a fairly good steady diver could reckon on a remuneration of from £200 to £300 a
year. The cost to the Government for a twelve months’ trial of this scheme, I estimate, would be about as
follows:—Hire of boat, £10 per month, £120; man in charge, £240; provisions, £100; dresses, £25;
emergencies, say, £115; total, £600. The shell won during tuition would materially reduce this amount—
from eight to ten men could be taken in hand at one time, and from two to three months tuition would be
ample. Mr. Milman intends writing you in regard to this matter, and if you are favourable to such action, I
will be pleased to go into detail for your information, and, further, am prepared to engage from twenty to
thirty (divers and tenders) men when they are available.
Hoping that you will give this your serious consideration,
I have, &c.,
THOS. J. FARQUHAR.
P.S.—Mr. Douglas, the member for Cook, is well up in our wants, and can give you valuable
information on the subject.

LETTERS FROM Da. A. E. SALTER, HOMEBUSH, NEW SOUTH WALES, TO UlE COMMISSION.
Homobush, New South Wales,
7th July, 1908.
Sms,—By the courtesy of your secretary, I am informed that you are appointed a Commission for
the purpose of inquiring into the conditions of the pearling industry of Queensland.
As 1 believe you are all aware, I lived some years on Thursday Island, and, though not very much
engaged in the shelling industry, naturally formed some ideas upon the subject. For whatever they may be
worth I now present these ideas to you.
Methods op Shelters who Carry on this Industry.
That pearl-shellers are divided into two main camps will be a fact so well understood by you that I
need not enlarge upon the methods of the two, beyond saying that in one are the nomadic shellers, whose
base is a large ship and who have no domiciliary interest in Australia; and in the other are the shellers who
do some of the work incidental to their business ashore, are domiciled with Queensland’s citizens, and are
consequently wrapped up in the welfare of the State with whose lot theirs is mingled.


I say it is true the nomadic slieller is not domiciled in Australia, although certain owners of the fleets
of the nomads may reside in Australia. The nomads themselves reside at sea. Even the residence of the
owners in Queensland is accidental, not necessary.
What I propose to ask you to consider in connection with these two camps is whether future laws
which may be made for the control of this industry should or should not afford protection to those shellers
whose interests are ours as well as their own against the competition of those whose interests are no one’s but
their own.
I may point out to you that nomadic enterprises, whether carried out on land as the enterprises of
the Bedouins are carried out, or at sea as those of the nomad shellers are carried out, are never of much value
to that State within whose sphere of influence they are prosecuted. The Bedouins, as you know, are
destructive to the settled industries. They pounce down upon the results of the labours of the farming
classes, and have the unenviable distinction of finding that every man’s hand is against them as the outcome
of their hand being against every man. Now, the nomadic sheller does not gather the product of the labour
of our citizens as the Bedouin does that of the farmer, but he prevents him from gathering in the crop of the
sea.
So the result to the settled sheller is the same as to the settled farmer, and, like the Bedouin, he is
the enemy of settlement and, therefore, of civilisation and progress. ~
The nomadic sheller, in his central depot called the “schooner,” has the finest labour-sweating agent
that the mind of man has ever invented, and with it he is able if he so wish to keep his men at their work
from daylight till dark, and every day of the week from year’s end to year’s end. From this circumstance
alone the nomadic method is not a desirable one for a civilised State to foment.
I believe some think that the nomadic method is the “progressive” method of shelling, but that is
only because more money is made in that way by the individual owners than is made by the domiciled sheller.
I venture to think that in a civilised nation the “progressive” method of working an industry is not
necessarily the one which gathers in the most profit to the owners of it, but that which distributes it among
the most people. States may well examine into such matters with a view to seeing whether their many
citizens are not being degraded while the few are being enriched. If “schooners” produce this, the method is
retrograde, not progressive.
The nomadic shellers will doubtless say that they benefit the State because they pay a few thousand
pounds to aliens as wages once a year. They may also allege they contribute to the revenue by payment to
Customs-house of certain duties which the law demands.
These apparent benefits vanish when you consider that they are stripping the beds of pearl-shell to
the injury of the domiciled sheller, and that the money paid is largely sent away from the country. The
domiciled sheller would be paying off the men and paying the Customs dues instead of the nomadic sheller,
with the exceeding great advantage that the domiciled sheller would bo adding to that annual crop of babies
without which the State cannot continue—an addition of which we are deprived by the efforts of the nomadic
sheller.
I may add, that if there is any idea of bringing about the entry of white divers into this industry, the
existence or the nomadic method must be prevented.
The ideal method of shelling is for the diver to own his own boat, dive for himself, pay his own crew,
and be domiciled ashore. The nomadic shellers are persons who work in large companies, and while they are
about the opportunity for the diver to own his boat does not exist, be he black or white.
His opportunity is, in fact, destroyed by them. Indeed, the whole case is so simple and clear that, had
the industry been going on off the coast of Queensland, near Brisbane, so as to attract the notice of the
Parliament of the State, neither 3-milo limits nor threats of changing flags, nor any other matter would have
prevented that body of men from enacting such legislation years back as would have prevented the industry
from being carried on in that way.
As to how the nomads may be checked, I make no doubt you understand it better than I; but I
presume the course adopted would have the effect of debarring the use of oversized vessels, or of taxing them
to such an extent as would be equivalent to debarring their use, but at least their crews should be our citizens.
As it seems to be regarded as the law all over the British world that a license granted from year to
year has no vested interest beyond the period for which it is granted, it cannot well be argued that the present
licensees have any vested interests.
Number of Boats engaged in the Industry.
I do not know any way by which a certain arbitrary number of boats could be named as the sufficient
number. If it were enacted that no more boats should be licensed other than those at present prosecuting
the industry, provided that any boat built by white labour in the Commonwealth after the date of enactment
may be licensed, I should think that the number of boats would be sufficiently limited by that means.
Ihe price of shell and the yield per boat will always remain as the best gauge to apply as a means of
discovering how many boats should be allowed to work. This gauge will work automatically.
It would be a regrettable policy which would seek to prevent a man from having a boat built for him
by his countrymen, they all being Australian citizens, if a very great rise in the price of shell induced him to
embark in the industry. This would become still more regrettable if, in addition, he was desirous of going
out as his own diver.
Labour.
Whether the industry should be conducted by alien labour or by the labour of our own countrymen
has been the subject of argument.
That the nomads would state positively that shelling could not be conducted by other than alien labour
may be expected, for our countrymen would recognise at once that the “ schooner” is the engine of the labour-
sweater, and, therefore, he would eschew it. Thus the nomadic slieller only allowed white labour would bo
unable to prosecute his business under his method, and he is speaking from that point of view. As it is now,
by obtaining the cheapest and most servile of Asiatic labour, he is able to be the sea-rover that he is.
Anyhow, the opinion he expresses upon the matter of labour only proves that his method is bad for the State,
and that the industry so prosecuted may be a source of danger by the introduction of unfriendly people
among us, for, while he sets the pace with aliens, the domiciled sheller must follow on. If this be admitted,
then such method should be swept out. Any industry which affords so small a percentage of Europeans
employment, as the shelling industry as carried out by the nomadic shellers does, is of no value to the
Australian State near which it is carried on.


In my opinion, whether the sheller be domiciled or nomadic, it should be a sine qua nun attached to the
license of every boat that it should carry at least two Australian citizens aboard it. Whether they should
be ordinary crew or diver and tender is a matter for longer consideration, but that two of them should be
of our own nation is, I believe, necessary as a commencement towards making the industry our own. If no
boats were licensed from now, except built wholly by our own citizens, and the necessity for the employment
of two persons above described were enacted, the industry would begin to pay wages to our own people.
Size of Shell.
This matter many years ago was discussed by Parliament, and a limit of.G inches was put on. As
later on it was taken off, I have come to the conclusion it is not worth while changing it back again.
Closing up Areas of Ground.
This has been frequently mooted, but it presents the great difficulty of being a very hard thing to do.
On account of this difficulty I have never thought it worth trying to do. Besides that, the benefit is doubtful.
Deep-water areas have been proclaimed, but with shell at a very high price men have entered the forbidden
areas and taken the shell all the same. That is to say, they were ready to sacrifice their life for the sake
of shell. How, then, shall they be kept off any forbidden areas it the prize to be taken is so highly valued
that life is the stake offered.

PAPER ON “DIVING AND CAISSON DISEASE—A SUMMARY OF RECENT INVESTIGATIONS,” WRITTEN
BY SURGEON N. HOWARD MUMMERY, M.R.C.S., R.N., AND COMMUNICATED BY THE DIRECTOR-
GENERAL, R.N., TO “THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL” OF 27th JUNE, 1908.
As I believe that the recent and most important researches into the most interesting subject of diving
have not been published in any form in the medical Press which circulates amongst members of the medical
profession in general, I may, I hope, be pardoned for attempting to enumerate them in brief form, and
point out that the work done at the Lister Institute by Dr. Haldane, Dr. Boycott, and Lieutenant Damant,
on behalf of the Special Committee appointed by the Admiralty, has completely revolutionised both the
procedure of diving and the treatment of those morbid conditions which are met with among divers, and
attributable to that occupation. In H.M. navy diving operations are continually being carried out for
instruction, for periodical exercise, and for all kinds of practical work, though seldom at greater depths than
17 fathoms, and usually at much less. Medical officers of the navy are at times called upon to treat cases
of so-called caisson disease, and a knowledge of the principles and practice of diving, and also of the best
way to deal with any symptoms which may arise, is essential to them. Until quite recently, if anything went
wrong with a diver he was at once brought to the surface, and was on no account permitted to go down again
on that occasion. Now, on the other hand, should a diver come up suffering from the effects of too great a
depth, too long a stay below, or too rapid an ascent, he is invariably sent down again, kept there for a
certain time, and thereby cured.
When a man is subject to the normal atmospheric pressure of 16 lb. to the square inch, his tissues are
saturated with nitrogen at that pressure. Suppose, now, that this man goes down in a. diving dress to a
depth of 28 fathoms; he will then be subject to the pressure at that depth—namely, 75 lb. plus the
atmospheric pressure of 15 lb., making a total of 90 lb. The tissues, which were previously saturated with
nitrogen at a pressure of 15 lb., will now have to become saturated at the new pressure of 90 lb., or six times
as much as before. The blood will, therefore, take up nitrogen from the inspired air until that point is
reached. This change that takes place in the amount of nitrogen in the tissues is called the “process of
saturation,” and there are three chief factors in its causation—“atmospheric pressure,” or the normal one
of 15 lb.; “positive pressure,” or pressure in excess of atmospheric pressure; and “absolute pressure,” or
the total pressure at the time being plus atmospheric pressure. Therefore, absolute pressure equals positive
pressure plus 15 lb. The process of saturation takes place as follows:—The arterial blood in the lungs takes
up nitrogen from the inspired air, supplied by the pump, and conveys it to tissues, returning in the venous
state to the lungs devoid of nitrogen and again absorbing it. The tissues, being only saturated with nitrogen
at atmospheric pressure, must naturally absorb more nitrogen from the blood passing through them which
is saturated at a much higher pressure (90 lb. at 28 fathoms, as compared with 15 lb. at the surface). This
process goes on until the tissues can absorb no more nitrogen, when, they containing the same amount as the
blood, the body is said to be saturated fully at that pressure.
Rate of saturation in man: Remembering that the volume of blood in man is nearly 5 per cent, of the
volume of the body, and that the whole of this blood passes through the lungs once in one minute when the man is
at rest, it is correct to suppose that the rate of saturation will be much as follows : —
In a quarter of an hour saturation will be half-way ;
In half an hour saturation will be three-quarters of the way;
In three-quarters of an hour saturation will be seven-eighths of the way;
In one hour saturation will be fifteen-sixteenths of the way, or complete.
Thus, after a diver has been working at 12 fathoms for one hour (that is, under a pressure of 32 lb.)
he would be saturated to 30 lb. As, however, owing to their difference in blood supply, some tissues will
become saturated in man much quicker than others, it is obvious that saturation will be unequal, and, in
consequence, in actual practice, the human body is not fully saturated even after three hours’ exposure to
pressure. This process of saturation is known as “compression”; “decompression,” or the reverse process,
consists in bringing the diver up again to atmospheric pressure, and thus lowering the degree of saturation
of his tissues to the normal amount at atmospheric pressure. This latter process is by far the more important,
and on its proper management depends the chief responsibility for the health and comfort of the diver; the
only other precaution, in a healthy man, being that he should not remain down too long, the rapidity with
which he descends being of little importance—in fact, usually the quicker the better. The difficulty with
regard to decompression that the investigators had to deal with was to bring the man back to atmospheric


pressure as quickly as possible, without at any time allowing the amount of nitrogen dissolved in his blood
to dangerously exceed the amount which corresponds to full saturation at the pressure to which the man is
at that time exposed. If the pressure at which he was working were suddenly lowered to atmospheric
pressure, the excess nitrogen would begin to diffuse out at once, and would, were it possible, escape again in
the same time that it went in, the process getting slower and slower as the saturation of the body gradually
approached that of the normal atmospheric pressure. This, however, cannot take place without the
formation of bubbles in the blood and tissues, due to the liberation of excess nitrogen, which, by forming
emboli and causing blocking of vessels in various parts of the body, would lead to grave or fatal results.
A limit must, therefore, be placed on the speed with which decompression can be carried out. Dr. Haldane
gives the following as a fundamental maxim: —“ The absolute air pressure on a man can always be reduced
to half the absolute pressure at which his tissues are saturated at the time without risk of bubble
formation.” The correct way, then, to decompress a man is to reduce the air pressure on him by half at a
time, giving him sufficient pause at each stage of reduction for his body to give off nitrogen until the amount
left is only enough to produce saturation equivalent to the pressure to which he then is subjected. The
pressure is thus reduced half at a time until he reaches the surface, and once again is subject only to normal
atmospheric pressure; but—and this is most important—the nearer the diver approaches to the surface the
longer the time allowed tor his getting rid of the excess nitrogen must be.
From this it is evident that, in the case of a man who, diving, has been subjected to a pressure of,
say, 76 lb., the process of decompression would occupy hours, and the whole system be impracticable. To
meet this difficulty, however, divers are not allowed to get fully saturated at high pressures, and the time
limits are so arranged that the man diving starts to ascend saturated at a much lower pressure than that
at which he has been working, and the process of decompression is graduated accordingly. In ascending it is
important that the diver should come up between each “'stage ” as rapidly as possible, and remain at each
stage long enough—the longer the better in reason—and if he has been working at any appreciable depth he
should exercise his muscles, especially those he has been using at his work, whilst waiting before the next"
stage of the ascent.
• As any symptoms of caisson disease that may arise are due almost entirely to the time that the diver
remains down, and not so much to the depth that he has gone down, it is important that the descent should
be as rapid as possible. The only difficulty he meets with on going down is due to trdbble with his ears,
which difficulty is usually overcome by swallowing, and thus equalising the pressure between the mouth and
the tympanum by opening up the Eustachian tube. Another difficulty, which exists now only in theory—
though it used to exist in practice—is that of keeping the pressure of air inside the diving dress equal to the
pressure outside it. In theory this equalisation of pressure is much mentioned, and great stress is laid on
its importance. It can, however, be easily understood that, were a diver’s dress blown out with air at a
sufficient pressure to attain that object at any depth below a few fathoms, he would be unable to move his
limfcs in any but the most restricted degree, and would be thereby prevented from doing the work that he
went down to do. In diving at the lesser pressures in the navy it is common to employ partial inflation;
but experienced divers and those working at greater depths use another means of avoiding injury from
pressure. A strong wicker frame covered with felt, and shaped convexly to stand away from the body, is
worn round the trunk under the dress, and thus keeps the pressure outside the latter from exercising any
undue force on the thorax and abdomen. This frame also has an extension which protects the testicles and
guards them from injury. Round the limbs the dress fits tightly, and allows the diver free movement.
A single cylinder of a diving pump has a capacity of one-tenth of a cubic foot. Ten revolutions of the
pump should, therefore, produce 1 cubic foot of air. The diver at all depths will require I's cubic feet of air
every minute for respiration in comfort; it should, however, be remembered that in practice some divers are
more comfortable with more or less than that amount, and that two divers down at the same depth,’and
being supplied by the same pump, may require different amounts. If the pressure (absolute) were counter-
acted by the method of dress inflation, instead of by the wicker frame, it would be obvious that the amount
of air required for that purpose would vary according as the depth varied. To guard against injury to
divers, it is most important that all parts of the diving “ gear ” should be in good working order, and that
no possibility of air escape exists, as, in cases where divers suffer distress and show symptoms of fainting,
such symptoms are almost invariably due to an insufficient air supply, caused by the pumps not being worked
fast'enough, air leaking past the pistons, or, as has lately been found to happen, air escaping at the junction
of the pipe with the pump, owing to the nut securing the former working loose. Should decompression take
place too rapidly and slight bubble formation occur in the tissues, it takes considerable time for them to
completely disappear from the system, and this should be borne in mind before allowing a diver who has been
exposed to pressure, though apparently well, to go under pressure again until some long interval has elapsed.
The length of this interval must depend upon the depth and the time that he has been down, but as a rough
rule it may be taken that a diver who has been down in 15 fathoms for one hour should remain on the
surface for three hours, and one who has been down in 25 fathoms or more for a quarter of an hour or less
should not again go down on the same day.
The time a diver is “ down ” is counted as from the moment he leaves the surface to the beginning of
the ascent. The time he may remain down is, of course, influenced by the depth that he has gone down, and
by the nature of the work that he is doing there, to a less degree. In any depth not above 7 fathoms there
is, in reason, practically no limit to that time. The time taken over the ascent, in stages, is determined
by the depth and the time spent at that depth, as the longer the diver is down the slower must he ascend,
because the longer the time spent below the greater will the saturation with nitrogen have become, up to
the full amount of saturation at the pressure to which he has been exposed. If working at 10 fathoms, he
will have been subjected to a pressure of 26J lb.; he should be down not over three and a-half hours at the
most (counting from the time he left the surface), and should take thirty-two minutes to ascend. At a depth
of 34 fathoms he should not be down over twelve minutes, and will still require thirty-two minutes for the
ascent. The times necessary for various depths are all laid down with great accuracy in the instructions
issued by the investigators.
Symptoms of Caisson Disease.
Mild symptoms of discomfort mot with on the man first commencing the descent are really due, as
stated, to the initial difficulty of equalising the pressure at each end of the Eustachian tube, and consist of
noises in the ears, a “ bursting feeling ” in the head, and pain in the frontal region and eyes. Swallowing
usually relieves these symptoms speedily, but many divers find that they persist until the feet touch the
bottom, when they are at once relieved. “Bends ” —this name is applied to pains, more or less severe, which
a diver experiences in his joints and muscles after working at the greater depths or for long periods below,
and they are usually felt in those joints and muscles which' he has been using at his work. They are, as a
rule, prevented by the diver exercising his muscles, specially those he has used most, whilst waiting at the
stages of his ascent. These pains come on most frequently after the diver has been up half an hour or more,
and last a variable time. Sometimes they are very severe.
<T


Dyspnoea, faintings, and syncope, if mild, and only noticed temporarily or on coming up, may be due
to insufficient air supply caused by a defective pump, or to the diver not having learnt to control his valve
properly. If severe, they are almost certainly due to his having come up too quickly, and, in consequence*
to the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the circulation, tissues, and organs of the body.
Death. —Certainly due to embolism and blocking of cerebral or pulmonary vessels by the bubbles of
nitrogen set free in the circulation by the top rapid decompression.
Paralysis. —This is not at all an uncommon symptom, and may be cither unilateral or bilateral, and,
again, may be merely transient or permanent. It nearly always affects the lower limbs.
Nausea and vomiting usually occurs directly the diver has come to the surface and has had the helmet
removed. Generally seen in men who have had a heavy meal just previous to descent, or are not in good
condition; also occurs quite often in novices after their first dip.
Bladder troubles, such as pain and retention of urine, may occur subsequent to diving, and urinary
incontinence has been known to occur whilst the diver has been down, owing to pressure on the abdomen.
Pain in the testicles is also sometimes complained of, and would follow deep diving where those organs have
not been adequately protected.
Subcutaneous Haemorrhage. —l have seen one case of this, accompanied by subconjunctival ecchymosis.
Prophylaxis. — All divers should be examined medically before being allowed to undertake such duties,
especially with a view to ascertaining their chest capacity and the absence of any cardiac weakness or arterial-
disease. This examination is always most carefully carried out in the navy. The following subjects are unfit
to become divers:
Those addicted to alcohol in any but the mildest degree.
Those who are heavy cigarette smokers;
Those with any tendency to pulmonary tuberculosis;
Those Who have had syphilis;
Those who have any ear disease, especially otorrhoea ;
Those whq, are ruptured, and men who have adenoids, suffer from rheumatism, or. have any
tendency to arterial disease or varicose veins.
After any specific febrile disease, especially pneumonia, it is wise to forbid diving for some months, and
then only after careful examination of the heart -and lungs. I would draw special attention to syphilis; it is a
disease which is widespread throughout the navy, though, owing to improved methods of treatment, more
careful observation of syphilitics, and the declining virulence of the disease, much less so than it was a few
years ago. These men are never safe as divers, and it is highly probable that diving may bring on those
syphilitic arterial changes which lead to such grave late lesions of the disease. Most careful inquiry should
be made to exclude all such candidates from diving classes. Men with urethral stricture and those subject
to attacks of retention of urine are also obviously unsuitable.
Treatment.
The treatment of “ bends,” as already mentioned, is mainly a question of prophylaxis, and should
that not prevent their occurrence, resort must be had to massage and friction to ease the pains: the use of
morphine is undesirable and .seldom necessary. For the more serious symptoms of dyspnoea, fainting, and,
syncope, the correct treatment—on the supposition that these symptoms are due to too rapid decompression—
is to recompress the man. Send him down again at once to the last “ stage ”he halted at before coming to
the surface, or it the case be very severe, pointing to the nitrogen saturation being that equivalent to a
greater pressure than that of twice the pressure at the last stage, send him down further still, and then,
after allowing plenty of time, decompress him very slowly. Even should the diver come up “black in the
face ” from cyanosis, he must have the helmet put on again and go down instantly.
For the paralysis little can be done, and, as mentioned, it is generally transient. Should it persist, it.
should be treated in the usual way by massage and electricity.
Apparent Death. —ln cases of apparent death, where it would appear to be quite useless to recompress,
artificial respiration and the other usual means of restoring animation should, of course, be resorted to, but
it would seem likely that artificial respiration could only be employed with any real measure of success if done
by another diver below the surface at half the depth the man had been working at, and this* though difficult*
should not necessarily be impossible.
