With the Compliments of
WHITE HORSE DISTILLERS LIMITED
GLASGOW r LONDON , SYDNEY

T.S.S. “HOBSON’S BAY”
Arriving at Plymouth, May 18, 1928


MR. ALICK LAUDER ARRIVES WITH SPRIGS OF WHITE HEATHER FOR THE DELEGATION. MR. J. D. MACINNES,
J.P., CHAIRMAN OF THE DELEGATION, IS ON MR. LAUDER'S RIGHT
A few days before the “Hobson’s Bay” was due at Plymouth, the following Marconigram was sent: —
“Alick Lauder, brother of Sir Harry, representing WHITE HORSE DISTILLERS LTD., travelling from Scotland
in full Highland dress, to welcome Australian Scots on arrival of the “Hobson’s Bay” at Plymouth. He
brings with him 500 sprigs of White Heather. Lang May Your Lums Reek.”


A WONDERFUL SCENE AS THE “HOBNSON'S BAY ” LEFT THE PIER AT MELBOURNE.
AN ENORMOUS CROWD OF 6,000 GAVE THE DELEGATES A ROUSING SEND-OFF
The Australian Scottish Delegation visiting the Motherland represent all the AuStraliai
industries—wool growers, agriculturists, sugar growers, fruit growers, canners, dairymen, etc
A most comprehensive tour of the United Kingdom has been arranged, and two special train
were required to take the Delegation to Scotland, where they were given a very warn
welcome in each and every town they visited. Even St. Kilda is included in the programme
of at least one Member of the Delegation.
The obje£t of the visit is to help to develop those trade relations within the Empire whict
are so desirable.
On the journey to Edinburgh a 6-valve wireless set was installed in a fish van attached to the
train, and the party listening in were able to hear the skirl of the bagpipes played in a Studio in
the heart of Melbourne, and were delighted to hear the Australian announcer report “splendid
regular rains and an assured spell of agricultural prosperity.”

MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION INSPECTING A CONSIGNMENT OF “WHITE HORSE” WHISKY READY FOR
DESPATCH TO OUR GOOD FRIENDS —MESSRS. DALGETY & Co., OF SYDNEY
For “ WHITE HORSE ” only the choicest makes of Scotch Whisky are selected. They are matured for a long period in sherry
wood, and afterwards carefully blended and reblended. The scientific methods employed by White Horse Distillers Limited in
the blending produce the mellow flavour and beautiful bouquet which have always characlerised WHITE HORSE. After each
blending operation WHITE HORSE is allowed to lie in wood for a further period in order to allow the Whisky to become properly
“married.” The general public have very little knowledge of the time and the care which are taken, and the expense which is
involved, in this blending and reblending, or “marrying,” of WHITE HORSE before it is bottled.

A Scottish Shepherd’s Diary
The following extraft from the Diary of a Shepherd some forty years ago will
Strike the reader as curious :


A GROUP OF VISITORS TO OUR WAREHOUSE TAKEN OUTSIDE THE “WHITE HORSE” EXCISE BOND, MACKIE
STREET, GLASGOW, JUST BEFORE DERBY DAY. TWO MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD
HOLD OF THE “FAVOURITE”


The Latest News from Aberdeen
An Aberdeen gentleman decided to build a house, so he employed a Freemason.
* * *
The threepenny-bit is so called because of the tooth tests it undergoes in Aberdeen.
* * *
A freak show visited Aberdeen, and every bachelor proposed to the fasting woman.
♦ * *
An Optimiit. The man who, when he shouted in Aberdeen, expeCted to get an echo back.
* * *
An Englishman and a Scotsman went out together for the evening. The Englishman Stood
dinner, theatre-seats and a taxi home. The Scot Stood 5 ft. 10 ins. in his socks.
* * *
In the back parlour of the Bagpipe Tavern a crowd of Aberdonians were engaged in a game
of dominoes. They had to give it up : none of them would rap on the table for fear the waiter
came in. * * *
A gramophone needle which entered the arm of a Scotch friend some years ago has juSt
emerged from his shoulder. This, of course, is moSt annoying in view of the faCt that he had
purchased another needle in the meantime.
* * *
An Aberdonian went to the Greyhound Racing in London for the first time, and after watching
four races without making a bet, went up to a bookie juSt before the commencement of the
fifth race, and offered him u. bet on the hare !
* * *
An Aberdonian on a visit to London so enjoyed a taxi ride that he gave the driver a penny over
and above his legal fare. “ ’Ere, what’s this ? ” asked the man, displaying the coin in his out-
stretched hand. “ Mon,” the Scot said, “ ye’rr a sport! Tails.”
* ♦ *
An angler down in the south was fishing in a Stream, and had hooked a pocket-book full of
bank notes. This curious incident duly appeared in the public Press, and a couple of days
afterwards the angler received a letter from an Aberdonian asking him what kind of bait he used.
* * *
An Aberdonian opened a picture house in his native city, and, desirous of having a special
attraction for the first night, he placarded the building with the announcement—ALL OLD-
AGE PENSIONERS ADMITTED FREE, and in smaller print was added underneath—lf
accompanied by parents. * * *
A Scotsman went into a public-house to purchase a bottle of whisky, leaving a fellow Scot
outside. On being told the price, izj 1 . 6d., the would-be purchaser found he had only us. id.
He therefore went back to his friend and said, “ Lend me 4 d. I want to buy a bottle of ‘ White
Horse.’ ” His friend replied, “ Here is B d. Get me a bottle as well.”
* * *
A Dominion friend, visiting Aberdeen last summer, was inspired with an idea, and took a
photograph one Sunday morning of the Aberdeen Market Place when it was quite deserted, and
named it “Aberdeen on a Flag Day.” He took the same picture the following Saturday afternoon
when the Market Place was packed, and gave it the title, “ Aberdeen on a House-to-House
Collection Day ” —too bad a fraud to perpetrate on a very fine city!
* * *
A very prominent Scotsman was entertaining a gueSt for the night. The evening was spent
in weighty conversation, no offer of liquid refreshment being made. About ten-thirty p.m. the
hoft said suddenly, “ Now, how about a wee doech-an-doris, eh ? ’ The gueSt rubbed his hands
and chuckled, “ Splendid, that’s the one thing I’ve been hoping for.” So the hoSl, smiling
genially, rose and put Sir Harry Lauder’s celebrated song-record on the gramophone.
