FACTS ABOUT AUSTRALIA.*
?
The mainland of Australia, nearly equal in extent to two-thirds of
Europe, with its great range of climate and variety of products, naturally
offers a tempting field for the enterprise of the Old World. The
south-eastern region can now no longer be presented to the imagination as
a land of mystery, holding in its depths unknown perils, but has become
a country daily travelled over, .intersected by roads, telegraph lines, and
railways; and, in the loneliest parts, showing marks of the axe, and
prints of the horse?s hoof?the brands of the European colonist. Its
coast-line, extending over more than two thousand miles, is dotted with
an infant settlement in every inlet; and in the interior a homestead or a
hamlet is found in every valley; there every forest has its herd of English-
bred cattle; every plain its flock of Spanish-bred sheep; corn-fields and
vineyards tint the southern landscape; and sugar plantations are begin-
ning to fringe the tropical rivers. For twelve hundred miles almost every
mountain-range will show its group of busy miners, for gold and copper
are worked over all that extent of country. A horseman may travel
across the continent, and rest under a roof nearly every night. Peace
and good order, too, reign through the land; and if Australia is not all
that emigrants could wish, it is not that nature has been niggardly, or
that any lack of zeal in pioneering has been shown by the colonists.
Such obstacles as exist to providing for a much larger number of
immigrants can be removed only by time, though it may appear incredible
to most people at home that there should be any such difficulty. How-
ever, the following cursory glance at the history of these colonies will
show that they are now only working their way through a slough of
chaos, produced in pretty equal proportions by mistaken land policy in
past times, by commercial abuses more recently, and by a closely cen-
tralised system of government, into which all these colonies have drifted,
in spite of their popular institutions.
It will be seen that, with enormous production, a huge commerce, and
ambitious schemes of public works, the main sources of wealth are ad-
ministered chiefly for the purpose of paying dividends to distant creditors
and absentee shareholders; while the settlement of the people on rural
homesteads, the real wholesome life of a nation, is but now slowly begin-
ning. It will be seen that the boasted prosperity of Australia is but one-
sided, and that to pour numbers of the poor of Europe on our shores
would only be to bring them to starvation.
It is now over eighty years since Australian settlement first com- 1788,
menced; but in the first forty there is little to note, beyond the records

of the penal establishments maintained by the Imperial Government.
The original design of the colony was humane and enlightened. The
reformation of the criminals was to be one main object, and the incentive
which a new career in a young country offered, would, it was thought,
lead many to well-doing. Some of the first governors tried to realise
these intentions, but they were generally thwarted by the corruption of
their subordinates. From the first, a small leaven of free immigrants
had been introduced. Grants of land were given to several families of
labouring farmers, and these formed a very respectable body, but their
numbers were too few to make any mark on the times. Discharged
soldiers and released convicts also got small grants, but, through the
prevalent fraud and debauchery of the times, the unfortunate men seldom
kept their holdings long. The first settlers of any note were of the class
of army officers and ship captains, who had come to the colony on duty,
and subsequently they w T ere joined by civilians, specially selected to form
a distinct caste. For many years these constituted the free community, a
few hundreds among many thousands of convicts. Land was assigned to
them in proportion to their means of turning it to use. They had labour
found them for the cost of maintenance, and discipline enforced gratis, and
their produce was bought by Government.
The cause which first led to a really independent colonisation, by
creating an industry apart from the original design of the settlement, was
the introduction of sheep and cattle.
The flocks and herds increased so rapidly, that within twenty years
they spread beyond the defined limits of the settlement in search of fresh
pastures; and the first squatters,' as the pioneer graziers were called,
appeared on the scene, from that time to the present a noted body in
Australia. This pursuit of grazing, extending with the increase of the
stock, and the addition of fresh settlers attracted from the mother
country, now presented a feature not anticipated and not desired by the
authorities. The dispersion of population which followed did not har-
monise with the close supervision necessary in a penal settlement, and for
that reason the enterprises of the squatters were not looked upon with
favour. But, strengthening with its growth, squatting became an in-
dependent interest, though recognition was for some time withheld.
So, after the first forty years of Australian settlement, we find this
state of things. The settled districts occupied by the grants of the ori-
ginal free colonists, worked by convict labour, formed in connection with the
penal establishments an industrial system mainly supported by Govern-
ment expenditure; and beyond these settlements a grazing interest
appeared, stretching into the inland w r astes, coldly looked upon by the
Government, but growing into prominence by the enterprise of its
leaders and the favourable character of the country. With the rise of
squatting, the real life of Australia commenced. An interest, self-
supporting and producing wealth, being created, trade, capital, and
immigration flowed into this new channel. Government was no longer
the sole distributor of bread or of rewards. A field was opened that
offered well-paid work to every free man, and good prizes for the
fortunate.
From this stage, step by step have we gone on. First, the free


colonisation which squatting called into life brought a new element into
the population, and in time led to the abolition of the convict establish-
ments ; next, as the country became better known, came the gold dis-
covery, opening a store of wealth, and attracting the adventurous from
the old world ; then the form of Government was changed, as the neces-
sities of a larger, wealthier, and more enlightened people demanded ; and,
to come to the present day, the last ten years have been marked by the
attempts made in all the colonies, more or less successfully, to push on
the permanent settlement of their waste lands. Of these events, the
growth of forty years, one worth noting, as an index of the general
change, is,, that the population has increased from fifty thousand, two-
thirds of these being of convict origin, to one million and a-half of free
people.
The attention of the Home Government had been arrested by the
growth of squatting, and when at length the country now called Victoria
was reached by the pioneers, instructions were sent to put a stop to this
unauthorised occupation of territory. The phenomena were sufficiently
perplexing in reality, without the inevitable colouring with which these
occurrences would appear to the Minister for the colonies. Here were the
pick of the settlers, the very class of men who were expected to weld
together, by good order and example, the incoherent mass of convictism,
all at once turned into Bedouins. Their outposts had reached the
southern shores, six hundred miles distant from the seat of government,
and on every watercourse and plain they were to be seen with their flocks
and herds. Moreover, while recruits from Europe joined them daily, the
nomad instinct spread through the heart of the settlement, imperilling
the prestige of discipline ? and many an expiree, leaving behind him the
memory of the stockade and the triangles, and all who loved adventure,
or were frowned on by fortune, sought the ? bush,? and became squatters,
or squatters? men. Clearly the time was critical: a pastoral people was
bound to occupy the wilderness of Australia, and it might depend upon
the present action taken, whether its future' inhabitants should form an
orderly community under British institutions, or whether a race of white
Oomanches, more ferocious and dangerous from their peculiar experience
of civilisation, should be the lords of the pastures. There is little doubt
that if the scene of action had been less than sixteen thousand miles from
Downing Street, the difficulty would have been solved by force being
used to curb the adventurers \ but fortunately the administration of New
South Wales was in the hands of a man equal to the occasion, and
capable of reading the meaning of events.
Sir Richard Bourke was the best governor that has come to Australia.
He saw that with the number of free settlers now swarming in the
colony, and crossing the frontier of the settled districts in all directions,
restraint would be difficult, if not impossible. On the other hand, his
penetration discerned in these seemingly lawless undertakings the promise
of wealth, commerce, and extended empire, and his wisdom sought rather
to regulate than to curb. It was evident to him that the days of the
penal establishments were numbered, and that the whole attention of the


administration should henceforth be given to making a new state of things,
which would harmonise with free institutions. The representations which
he made to the Home Government on the subject of squatting at length
prevailed, and that pursuit was placed on a legitimate footing. At the
same time, in the year 1837, Port Philip, the scene of the invasion which
roused the wrath of the Colonial Office, was formally adopted as a territory
of New South Wales. Things now seemed likely to go on smoothly.
The price of land was ss. per acre, and there was little restriction as to
its sale. Squatting was legalised by the impost of a small fee, and graz-
ing regulations prevented mutual encroachments by stock-owners ; but no
right of possession, real or implied, was thus conveyed, the tenure being
simply a permissive use of the grass. Here was the germ of what might
have become, as experience was gained, a good land system. Free access
was given to the natural pastures, while, with the low price of land,
every encouragement was offered to a more permanent form of settlement.
With the general improvements which this wise Governor carried out ?
lightening the burdens of the assigned prisoners, and opening the whole
country to industry, while he curbed petty tyranny, and strove to raise
the condition of the people?there appeared a gleam of sunshine at length,
a ray of hope, after the long night of heartless cruelty, fraud, and
depravity which the early records relate ; but, unhappily, his term of
government expired before his work was half done. But Sir Richard
Bourke was, in truth, in advance of his day, and was not fully valued
either by the Government which he served or by the colonists for whom
he laboured.
Downing Street was busy bringing colonies into life by a new pet pro-
cess, which was soon to be universally applied, without regard to expe-
rience, climate, or other incidental considerations; consequently the views
of the Governor of New South Wales, being formed from the observation
of facts, were thought little of. For the colonists, his policy was too far-
sighted, and beneficent. Each clique could admire only w r hat suited its
own members. Cheap land might be a good thing, provided the right
sort of men only got it. Squatting might be a good thing if the crown
lands were kept for a certain set; but all agreed that any attempt to
protect assigned servants against the severities of their employers w T as
monstrous, iniquitous, and unheard of. That there should be an attempt
at government for the benefit of all was ridiculed as Quixotism, and many
an old official and old settler bemoaned the good old times now passed
away, before the welfare of the people was heard of, when contracts were
paid for in rum, and labour was stimulated by the cat; when any man
who went about it the right way could get a job carried through, and
when the officers of Government could take care of themselves and their
friends.
Sir Richard left Sydney in 1837, and the colonies may rue for many
a day the doings of his successor.
The next Governor was Sir George Gipps. He was the instrument
chosen for introducing into New South Wales the views on colonisation


which had been adopted by the Government, The irregular form which
the settlement of Australia was taking proved abhorrent to the traditions
of administration. It looked too like legalised vagabondism, and the
question was raised how these objectionable tendencies might be neutral-
ised, or whether they might not be counterbalanced by the superior
attractions of a better system. The answer came, and a theory found
favour at head-quarters which promised everything that was wanted.
Mr. Gibbon Wakefield had some years before visited this part of the
world, and on his return to England he published certain views which he
had formed, and gained the ear of the official circle. He advocated
colonisation ?in mass,? plausibly arguing that the power of mutual sup-
port was lost by the dispersion of the settlers. Tested solely by the
moral of the bundle of sticks, and ignoring all surrounding facts, no
doubt he was right. The English population was, according to this
theory, to be moved to their new homes in compact segments, each to be
composed of the various classes in due proportion, according to English
ideas, and each individual was to fill the same relative position as in the
old country. It was assumed that with the general success of the
scheme each person would benefit in his degree, and that before their
collective power all obstacles would speedily yield.
Thus prosperous, because well-regulated, colonies would be founded
ready made and perfect from the first, and the security and comfort
offered by these well-balanced English communities would keep the mem-
bers of all grades in willing union, and save them from the evils of dis-
persion. These views met with great favour, and had been carried into
practical form in the year 1834 by the foundation of the colony of South 1834,
Australia.
Strongly supported by Government, this new settlement attracted
many emigrants. Some took large sums of money with them, and there
seemed every prospect of a successful issue to the attempt.
A town was to be built as the nucleus, and around it the settlers
were to cluster. The land was to be laid out in town, suburban, and
country lots, and each man was at once to step into his special occupa-
tion, agriculture being the main supporting industry. Grazing was not
in the programme, as that occupation led to dispersion. It is well to
note the origin of this settlement, completely opposite as it was in con-
stitution to anything yet tried in the colonies, as the principles then put
in shape have influenced the land legislation of all the colonies up to a
recent date, whether for good or otherwise.
The key-stone of the plan was a high price for land, called by the
promoter a ? sufficient price,? and a ? hired labour price,? the lowest
rate being �1 per acre. This price, it was supposed, would establish a
distinct class of proprietors, and the funds produced by the sale were to
be used in importing labour. Thus everything was provided for, and
fixed by rule and square.
What took place was this. As ship after ship reached the shores of
Adelaide, a scene of busy traffic ensued, which looked to the unthinking
new-comers like an established commerce, and seemed to confirm the
soundness of the ? Concentration ? theory. It appeared to them that the
town, the heart of the settlement, must certainly become the focus of


wealth as w r ell as of population, therefore all strove to possess property-
near this coveted centre. Public money was spent profusely, and private
capitalists eagerly rushed into speculation, and thus a thriving settlement
in appearance was established. But after all, for what they were doing
they need have gone no farther than the banks of the Thames. When
the allotment of the town lands began, the knowing ones fixed on the
best sites for stores and public-houses; high premiums were readily paid
for choice lots, and almost before a building was up, land-jobbing
began.
Then ensued one of those gambling disorders which occur so often in
the Old World, but this time remarkable as breaking out, not in the
crowded streets of old commercial cities, but on the verge of a wilderness
of grassy plains and forests, and the men who had gone forth to subdue
and reclaim with axe and plough were turned into jobbers and thimble-
riggers. All the people of the settlement collected on the site of the
future city, and did nothing but deal in land and live by their wits.
These doings did not escape the notice of the speculators and sharpers of
the neighbouring colony, and the manifest inclination of the ? new
chums ? (as the immigrants were called in prisoner slang) for gambling
and fast living gave these birds of prey a fine opening, so they came and
joined in the game, knowing that, whatever happened, something would
stick to their fingers. The arrival of every new ship added fuel to the
flame, and each emigrant only feared that he might be too late for the
prizes. The soil gave proof on its surface of the wealth which had been
brought to light, but it was not the produce of husbandry ? on all sides,
acres of empty bottles told of the Sydney brandy and champagne with
which the colonists had cheered their labours, and, as far as the eye could
reach, stood lines of surveyors? posts, like troops in open order, marking
off the allotments which were the staples of trade. The town was partly
built, but this was the only work done; agricultural labour was inde-
finitely postponed in favour of the speedier process of money-making
which had been found out. He who had an acre divided it into four,
and sold each lot for more than the whole cost. He who had ten acres
was a millionaire, and these capitalists hugged themselves over their
land-scrip, and blessed Mr. Wakefield for bringing them to the promised
land.
But all bubbles must burst some time. At the end of two years
Adelaide was half empty. The money was all spent, and the land and
buildings belonged to the money-lenders and grog-sellers. Many returned
to England without having touched work of any kind, and the scheme
had either vanished with the mis-spent money, or had yet to be started.
Those who could not get away had to spread over the country, and see
how they could earn a living.
One of the erroneous opinions current is, that the Wakefield system of
colonisation has been successful, and the growth of South Australia and
several of the New Zealand settlements is pointed to as proof of the
fact. But by looking at what actually transpired, it is evident that the
only success which can be shown, is that numbers of people were brought
to certain places, where thriving communities are found now.
It will be seen invariably that the schemes under which the people


were to live have been found insufficient when tested by the rude neces-
sities of a new country, and that they have gone to pieces under the
pressure?two stringent facts bearing heavily upon them, namely the
necessity for finding a living at once for the emigrants, and the attractions
of the unoccupied wilderness.
Thus, the era of gambling having passed in Adelaide, all left who
had the means to get away, to escape starvation, and those who were
tied to the place scattered over the country, and took to such pursuits' as
would enable them to live. Many got employed in squatting in the back
country with stock which came from New South Wales, some took to
farming in the rich lands on the coast, and others were employed on the
famous copper-mines afterwards found. In the same way in New Zealand
people got on after a time, by following such occupations as were practi-
cable in that country, but it was by the dispersion and not by the
concentration of the colonists that the resources now supporting them
were found out.
Therefore, it is absurd to credit the Wakefield system with results
which have proceeded, not from the working of that system, but from its
systematic violation ; and, moreover, greater results have been attained
at less cost in colonies which grew entirely from a loose system of grazing
and unrestricted gold-digging?namely, Victoria and Queensland.
The legacy which all Australia has inherited from this gift of the
Colonial Office, has been a high price for land, prohibitive of profitable
occupation, and a stinted and jealous spirit in its disposal. It is not
unfair also to attribute to this source the pernicious practice of land-
jobbing, which has swept like a disease over Australia, and has blighted
many a promising settlement \ for the comedy or rather tragedy enacted
at Adelaide has since been repeated, ludicrons in appearance to an on-
looker, but fraught with ruin to many a household.
So the new Governor proceeded to graft the Wakefield views on the 133 7 to
land policy of New South Wales. And he went to work in a high and 1846.
mighty spirit, without regard to his predecessors? opinions, to the expe-
rience of the colonists, or the effects of his proceedings.
Unpractical and useless as the Wakefield theories had proved, they
were warped by Sir George Gipps, so as to become positively mischievous.
A martinet officer, with strong views as to the rights of the Crown, a
habit of reading instructions literally, and a supreme indifference to the
interests of the country he ruled, and the feelings and wishes of his
subjects, he was in every respect the opposite of his predecessor. Under
his orders the Survey Department was organised in the form it long
maintained, to the terror and wonder of the inhabitants, and it proved a
most ingenious and efficient institution for preventing the settlement of
the country. As land was wanted it was by direction cut up into small
and inconvenient portions, not such as would suit intending settlers for
use but so as to cause inconvenience and promote competition as much
as possible. Men were forced to buy at high prices to protect their
interests, and as the sales were by auction, a fraudulent system of coercion


was soon established. For every buyer who wanted the land for use,
there were several jobbers who levied their black mail on the other?s
necessities. This necessarily discouraged the sale of land for purposes of
actual settlement, as no one bought except under compulsion, or for
speculation ; but this abuse was justified on the score of duty to the
Crown, and the necessity for raising a revenue. To all arguments on the
impolicy of the high price, and the injustice of the method of sale, the
Governor was deaf.
The Crown would not sacrifice its property, and every huckstering
trick was justified to ? rig? the market. To the vicious effects of fraud
and jobbery he was blind, and he merely said, in reply to all objectors,
that they might take the land in the way it was sold, or want it.
In the same spirit he changed the conditions of the squatting tenure,
reckless of good faith, and utterly careless of the evil consequences which
followed. Sir Richard Bourke, in dealing with the squatters, never
advanced the principle that a rent should be exacted for the grazing of
the waste lands. These he looked upon as a commonage which was open
to the use of all the colonists, and the regulations framed when the
grazing fee was imposed were merely for the purpose of preventing-
confusion.
The fee itself was levied to meet the cost of administration, and for
that it was sufficient. He neither demanded a rent, nor committed the
Government to the acknowledgment of any tenancy, which would have
been the necessary counterpart to such a claim. The grass lands were
found and occupied without expense or trouble to the State, and any
person possessing stock might go upon them so long as he paid the fee
and did not trouble his neighbours.
Two theories which have been mooted of late years had no place in
his plan. The first is, that the squatting right is sacred, until the land
is wanted for ? agriculture,? meaning mere tillage; and the other is, that
all the crown lands are the people?s estate, for which the occupant must
pay rent as to a landlord. The first fallacy carried out literally would
dead-lock most of the lands for ever ; the other is an unjust assumption,
claiming property in the tenant?s labour, to which alone the value of the
squattages is due.
But this taxing of grass, like realised wealth, abuse though it is,
chimes in well with the centralising ideas which have been grafted on
our popular institutions, and is not without its parallels in other depart-
ments of our polity.
All the principal constituencies which control the votes of the assem-
blies are in the larger towns, the scattered communities in the interior
being poorly represented ; and there is a strong inclination always among
the ruling majorities to mulct the outside population, to make money out
of the public estate, and spend it among themselves ?so that it has
become a very favourite idea that the electors are the landlords, and that
the squatters owe them rent for their runs.
Sir Richard Bourke would have condemned both these notions ; either
that squattages should be held by any permanent tenure, or that the
graziers of Riverina, or the miners of Tambaroora, should carry on their
work either by the sufferance or for the profit of the politicians and traders
of Sydney.


But these false views, and others which have borne heavily on the
colonies, proceeded from Sir George Gipps? policy. Having, by the high
price, and the fraudulent system of survey and sale, stopped the alienation
of land, and dried up the source of the land fund, in fact killed the goose
that laid the eggs, he fixed his eye on the squatters, and, strong in his
perverted sense of justice, he saw no reason why they should be left alone.
That people should be allowed to make their living in their own way
seemed to him at variance with all sound principles of government, so he
decreed, on the ? sic volo, sic jubeo ? principle, that each squatter, in lieu
of rent, should be compelled to buy part of his run periodically at the
price of �1 per acre.
This unjust exaction naturally caused discontent, and the squatters
for the first time banded themselves together. Combination gave them
confidence in their strength, and they did not fail to make their case
heard, but it is to be lamented that they did not rest satisfied with the
mere redress of their grievance.
Their argument was something to the following purpose : ?? We are
clearly in a dangerous position. Our homesteads and families are on the
public lands, where our stock which give us our living are fed. We have
sunk our labour and all our means in localities from which we may at any
time be ejected unless we submit to the levy of such fines or taxes as an
irresponsible official may exact. The price put upon the land is beyond
what we can afford to pay, and even if we yield in this case we have
every reason to expect that our ready compliance will be held proof of
our ability to pay greater demands. It is quite evident that we can place
no dependence on the good faith of the Crown represented by a colonial
Governor ? therefore we must somehow obtain such guarantees as will
enable us to carry on our occupation with safety.?
So far this was perfectly fair and reasonable, and if the question had
been submitted to an impartial board of inquiry, with access to the facts,
there is no reason to doubt that the squatters would have been satisfied
with any just arrangement which would have protected them against
official interference. But the active hostility of the Governor, and the
absence of any means of redress in the colony, drove them to extreme
measures. Having massed their forces, they quickly proceeded from
mere defence to active retaliation, and the petition which they forwarded
to the British Parliament evinced a spirit of aggression most perilous for
the colony.
They represented their grievances, and demanded for their protection
regular leases, rights of pre-emption, and fixity of tenure. It is hardly
credible that Parliament, in the year 1846, passed the measure they
wanted, without instituting regular inquiry, and without any knowledge
of the bearings of the question. In this way most of the grazing country
then known was parted with for nineteen years, if not for longer, and with
hardly any provision being made for re-entry by the Crown. Now, to
estimate the effect of this enactment. ?As to the lease ;?At first a
grazing right had no defined limits, but as stock increased boundaries
became necessary to prevent disputes. Still the rule laid down only
amounted to this, that the cattle belonging to A were not to feed
beyond a certain mountain, or the stock belonging to B beyond a certain


river. When the descriptions of the lands came to be drawn up for
insertion in the leases, as the country was not surveyed and little known,
each squatter became his own geographer, and the natural features of
the country which had kept his stock became the boundaries described in
his lease.
The locality, area, and character of his run were taken as given in by
himself, and the facts were never questioned except when the interests of
two neighbours came into competition, or when, as often happened, an
official wanted to carry out a job of his own, for which the vagueness of
the description gave every opportunity. The aim of all was of course to
include as much country as possible, and to block out interlopers, and
thus the leases took in all the surface from watershed to river-bank, and
from river-bank to watershed. Boundaries between runs were made
conterminous, so that almost every inch of available pasture then known
was tied up. The term was fourteen years, with a right of renewal on
the inland runs for five years more, and the only right of resumption left
in the hands of the Government was for roads and other public purposes.
Next, the right of pre-emption. This was a reasonable enough claim
if it had been used only as was intended ?namely to secure by purchase
improved lands and homesteads. But regulations were made which
allowed the purchase of 640 acres in every 16,000; and, used in this
way, the right became a weapon well adapted to destroy the country for
future settlers. It is easy to see that with the scarcity of good soil and
permanent water all over Australia, how the purchase of a few hundred
acres here and there is sufficient to spoil the country for any other buyer,
and thus the permanent occupancy of large tracts could be made safe at
small cost.
? Fixity of tenure ? cannot be so clearly defined, but it was a principle
strongly insisted upon by the leaders of the squatting party, who main-
tained that the Act of 1846 conferred this right. They meant, substan-
tially, that they held the option of renewing their leases indefinitely.
The saying of a well-known squatter of the day illustrates this : ?? So
long as I choose to pay the rent, these lands are to me and mine a free-
hold for ever.?
Whether the Act of 1846 expressed this intention or not, the orders
in council issued to guide the working of the Act were vague.
In later times, in spite of protests, the legislatures of the different
colonies most righteously refused to renew these leases.
The monopoly of the pastures being now secured for what seemed an
indefinite time, by two or three hundred stock-holders, it seemed as if
Australia was bound hand and foot, and the future of the colony threatened
to show an agrarian despotism of the most repulsive character, corrupting
to those who were supposed to benefit, as well as tending to produce a
degraded and servile class of labour.
All the interior was closed against the public. No man but a squatter
could touch the soil or share the gifts of nature. To build a hut, to en-
close a garden, or to keep a cow on the verge of the wilderness, was to
provoke the hostility of the squatters. Only one class of building was
encouraged, and the solitary sign of civilisation which appeared on vast
tracts, was that which rivetted the chain of the monopoly, namely, the


grog-shop. In the old settled districts were still nooks and corners here
and there, where the population could grow and live in comfort, hut most
of the country was as completely shut off from general settlement as the
Hudson?s Bay territory.
Thus the wise and beneficent policy which Sir Richard Bourke sought
to establish was at an end. Freehold land was not to be had at all in a
way favourable for occupation, and the nature of squatting was changed
for the worse. In place of the progress of pastoral industry side by side
with freehold settlement, blending together and supporting each other,
both interests in the colony had been sacrificed or perverted, one to the
errors of the Wakefield theory, and the other had become an incubus on
free progress, owing to a monstrous act of injustice perpetrated at West-
minster, ?thanks to the wisdom and tender solicitude of a Parliament at
the other side of the world.
There are men in London who sneer at colonial legislation as vestry
business. Let them learn that no colonial Legislature has yet been guilty
of such gross imbecility and dishonesty as are shown in the Wakefield
scheme and the Crown Lands Act of 1846, passed by the Imperial
Parliament.
This sweeping measure had a certain effect on the position of the
squatters, ultimately not to their advantage. The command of unlimited
pasture had always tempted them to contract debt, so as to increase their
stock, and the possession of their runs greatly increased the tendency.
From being energetic graziers, looking for independence and a comfortable
living in the successful care of their stock, many of them became mere
capitalists and speculators. Formerly, to work their stock themselves,
and to take gladly the profits which nature gave them, was their pride
and pleasure. If their position had been changed to that of proprietors
of good freehold grazing farms, the sense of ownership woidd have still
more stimulated them to legitimate industry, and would have led them to
improve zealously both stock and land; but in their peculiar position as
monopolists of huge tracts, which it was beyond their power to turn to
use to the full extent, their avidity led them into dangerous channels.
Doubtless they felt a strong impulse to get the most they could out of
their bargains without delay, as, however they might interpret their
? fixity of tenure,? something whispered of a change in coming years. To
stock their country fully, they went to the banks and merchants, and
many soon found their possessions assigned, and bound to pay heavy
interest, before they could get a living from the reversion of their profits.
The local Government greatly facilitated these dealings, by legalising the
transfer of squatting titles,'and yet more by adopting a law which sanc-
tioned the mortgage of live stock and pastoral produce, a course of policy
which had no precedent elsewhere. A corresponding extension of bank-
ing was developed by this law; and when it was seen that the pastures
and stock were converted into assignable pledges, the novel phenomenon
appeared, of agents who had no money whatever negotiating large transac-
tions in paper with bank directors, who had very little more, the only
real values passing between them being the hypothecated possessions.
The banks being forced to recover their advances, a system of dealing
and jobbing in stations grew, and was stimulated by them in every pos-


sible way. New-comers with money were keenly looked after, and to
meet the speculative market thus created, stock was bred without care,
because, to increase numbers, and sell at a price per head, became the
order of the day. Many of the leading squatters became absentees from
their stations, and lived mostly at the capital, because they had to keep
right with the banks and the Crown Lands department, and it was neces-
sary to look out for buyers. Some of them became legislators, and they
gave their whole souls to the welfare of their country, according to their
light that is, they moved heaven and earth to get cheap labour, and they
defended the integrity of their tenure against all comers; and, indeed,
hampered as they became, no more could be expected from them.
There might be a chance of retrieving their position by keen manage-
ment, by a rise in prices, or by catching a confiding new-comer, but their
day of sure profits and independence was gone. Far better if they had,
from the first, limited their ambition to the possession of good grazing
farms, for the gift which Government threw to them had turned to dust
and ashes in their teeth, and, besides the burden of financial sorrow
which oppressed them, they had roused the wrath of the non-squatting
public. Year by year the people felt more and more how they were
hampered and confined. For the labourer beyond the settled districts
there was no land open but the public road, and no home but the public-
house. The man who wanted a homestead for his family had to keep
them in a town, and pay rent for a dwelling. Of the many industries
which now dot the country there were none, because the jealousy of the
squatters allowed none on their lands but men seeking for work. More-
over, as the snowball gathers, so squattages became clubbed together, be-
cause the banks, when they could not sell to advantage, threw them ?into
the hands of their customers; till immense territories fed over by stock
more remarkable for their numbers than for their value, were held by
absentees, and peopled only by overseers and solitary shepherds.
Another aspect worth noticing was, that the lands being literally
locked up, there was but the one field open for intending settlers. Men
who would have been glad to get farms, if these had been procurable in
a way that would support them, were compelled either to risk the chances
of squatting with a slender capital, or to swell the trading communities
in the towns. Thus, thronged towns, often the seats of over-trading from
competition, appeared on one side, and a vast pastoral wilderness on the
other.
You stepped almost at once from the suburbs of an English town to
the steppes of Tartary. Rural life, with its simple abundance and
wholesome labour, was little to be seen.
Thus was Australia fettered for some time; and when at length a
new world arose with the gold discovery, a legacy of rottenness was
bequeathed, which is not purged yet from our system, tainting both our
social wellbeing and our industry; class feuds generated by vicious legis-
lation, and false prosperity raised on sham credit, the fruit of mis-
directed exertions.
In fairly deciding the question as to who is responsible for these
doings, it is not just to charge the squatters of the present day in any
respect with their origin. There is hardly one of them who does not


realise the fact keenly that he has been left in a false position by his
predecessors, and too often he has paid a monstrous price both for his
stock and his run. The preceding generation are in a measure respon-
sible, but it should not be forgotten that their action was provoked by
the unjust exactions of the Government, and if they made extravagant
claims in sueing for redress, they did not depart greatly from the usual
course pursued by a plaintiff in a suit. It was the duty of Parliament,
acting as judge, to hear both sides and give a just award. The blame
must be fairly divided between the irritating interference of Governor
Gipps and the criminal carelessness of the Imperial Parliament. But if
the squatters were hoisted into an invidious position by the fault of the
Government, it must be admitted that many of them did not exercise
their privileges with discretion or consideration for their fellow-colonists.
If ever a set of men laboured to get themselves detested, it was a
clique of the leading squatters of these days. ? Cheap labour ? was
their hobby, and the time was inopportune for touching popular sensi-
bilities. Transportation had ceased, representative government had
commenced, and a craving for free institutions agitated the towns, and
even reached the country population. Blind to the power of the tide
now setting in, they left no stone unturned to gain their ends. Some of
them entered into a bond to keep wages on stations at the lowest rate,
and to reduce the ration allowance, using the argument that any surplus
beyond the barest necessaries would be converted into drink. At the
same time, inconsistent as they were unprincipled, public-houses were
often built on runs to intercept the cheques paid to the shepherds and
shearers.
An attempt was also made to work the stations with Asiatic labour,
but this had a strong tendency to semi-slavery, and it broke down.
The last effort was a petition for the renewal of transportation, and
the fury which this raised through the country was at its height, when
the gold discovery?like a thunderbolt fallen from Heaven?stopped the
contest, and changed the whole future of Australia.
In describing the squatting system up to this time, the general facts
only have been stated, as, of course, in individual cases the details dif-
fered widely. Thus all squatters did not screw down their labourers, or
harass people who sat down on their runs. On the other hand, some
strove to do good to their own people and to all around them; and all
did not involve themselves in speculation and debt, but some kept their
stations in their own hands and reared thriving little communities around
them ; but the general facts mentioned marked the history of the times,
and must be recognised as the rule and not the exception.
For the public at large, the lands were deadlocked. For the squat-
ters as a body, they drifted into the hands of moneylenders, and the wide
oceans of pasture, instead of supporting the freehold population for which
they were designed, were inhabited' only by the wretched and solitary
shepherd, the servant of him who was bondsman to the usurer.
The gold discovery took place in 1851, and before the end of the year 1851


the precious metal was dug in a dozen different places hundreds of miles
apart. Australia quivered with the shock, and for a time stood still, as
her whole population poured on to the diggings, and her standard interests
seemed to totter and threaten dissolution. The wild enthusiasm with
which the people flocked to the gold-fields told of far more than the mere
thirst for the dross; and on every side the talk of the multitude showed
that they recognised in the event not merely a new source of wealth, but
a revolution political and social. ? We?ll buy your sheep,? shouted an
old dame on the Turon, swinging a leather bag of dust raised by her sons.
? A man may get a living now without working for a master,? was heard
on all sides.
The squatters whispered their terrors to each other, and predicted
general license and destruction, while they blamed the ? Government ? for
not adopting stringent preventive measures ? to save the country.?
The Government happened to act wisely on this occasion, perhaps
because Sir George Gipps? successor did not possess his perverse zeal, and
a commissioner was appointed well up to his work, and with full power to
act, Mr. Hardy administered rough-and-ready justice, made the gold-
finders pay a good fee, let off the unlucky ones, and kept things straight.
The multitude was well pleased; the predicted pandemonium never
arrived; and the only signs of ruin that appeared consisted in flocks here
and there wanting shepherds, and respectable men lamenting that people
were not satisfied to abide in that vocation to which they were called;
for orthodox Conservatism is of very rapid growth among Englishmen. A
few thousand pounds make all the difference between a red-hot Radical
and a true-blue Tory.
Now huge camps spread along the auriferous ranges and the banks
of the rivers and creeks, and the magical effect of a gold-field was to dis-
solve all squatting rights within a radius of many miles, so there was
plenty of land open for all, and every man did as he thought best.
Butchers set up their shops without asking leave, where no man before
could go without permission, and squatters were glad to sell them cattle
and sheep. The teamster turned out his cattle where the grass was
good, and travelled by any road he thought best without fear or favour;
and the dairyman brought his little herd, and put up his hut and yard
near the diggers, and turned his milk and butter into nuggets. No law
was repealed, no new enactment was passed, but the diggers, wherever
they went, superseded the squatter as a matter of course. When gold was
struck on freehold land, the diggers readily consented to pay the owner
the same fee as the Government exacted on Crown land, so there was
little trouble about that.
The effect of the discovery soon told in the strong tide of immigration
that set in from Europe and America, Crowded ports and thronged
roads showed the advance of armies which were to effect a peaceful con-
quest, and new men with new ideas pressed in among the colonists. The
rude and untutored offspring of the convict days, and the half-wild Irish-
men of Tipperary, stared to find themselves working beside men who had
the ways of gentlemen, the aptitude of skilled engineers, and the capacity
for carrying out works of co-operation, without control or compulsion being
necessary. To think, too, that these men read books, and conversed


together without yelling out blasphemies, and that they did not indulge
in the natural relaxation of hard drinking, even though they had money
in their pockets, presented to their bleared understandings a new view of
life. Such were many of the new-comers from America and Europe.
The old officials were amazed to find that all men were not of the same
pattern as holders of tickets-of-leave, or infantry soldiers; and when the
feared and maligned Californians appeared, mostly as quiet friendly people,
good neighbours, and skilful miners, surprise quickly merged into respect
and good-will.
Unfortunately, most of the Americans left the colony soon. They
said that in California there were greater facilities given for carrying out
profitable works, and they could live more comfortably than on the
Australian diggings; but their ideas remained behind them, and have not
been lost.
A new phase of life, indeed a new world, now grew over the wide
tracts covered by the gold-fields, and in those places where the inhabit-
ants clustered it became necessary to lay out townships, and to survey
lands for more permanent use than the indiscriminate commonage which
had established itself. All over the digging country, and along the main
lines of road, then new villages arose, and through them the traffic
poured which spread the golden harvest far and wide. For some years
the people were so employed and excited by the gold discoveries that the
inclination to turn to regular industry was very slight. Thousands of men
were engaged in carrying between the ports and' the gold-fields, many in
trading and dealing in stock. When money was quickly made in those
days, there appeared little attraction in the possession of a farm. That
which was soon earned was quickly spent.
The profusion of money and luxuries, contrasting with their former
rude and simple way of living, unsettled the people, and led them into
foolish excess. The change was enough to test a more educated people.
From the strict discipline of the station, or the cramped confinement of
town labour, they were at once transported to untrammelled liberty and
the possession of an auriferous domain which belonged to all. What
would the decent working-men of England do if subjected to the trial of
such license 1 ? What the ?roughs? might do, imagination can hardly
shadow forth; but, in justice to the people of Australia, it must be told
that, during the first years of the gold, crime was comparatively rare.
With all their drunkenness and barbarity, there were everywhere to be
seen strong traits of honesty, general good-will, and kindness.
The crimes which have been common of late years?namely, highway
robbery-with-arms and horse and cattle stealing?were then less frequent,
and the notorious bushrangers, who till lately have kept New South
Wales in terror, were then boys following their parents? cows, and sitting
by their camp fires.
Tents and huts were left open to all comers, and theft was rare. The
belated traveller was sure of a meal and welcome from the poorest digger
or roughest bushman, and thus it is to the present day. Where in Eng-
land can be shown a picture of such general honesty, hospitality, and un-
selfishness 1
As time went on, the gold-fields and towns became filled with people,


and in the hands of some money accumulated. A growing desire for new
investments by the monied men, and for homesteads by those who had
families, began to be felt. It may be suitable to remark here, that gold-
mining did not increase its production from year to year. Few diggings
have ever been so good after the first opening; even in the best there has
been a falling off; and though this has been partly compensated by new
ground being struck, still the aggregate yield has slowly but steadily
declined.
The expansion of the general population had been so far provided for
by the free use of the gold country, and by extensive surveys of villages,
suburban lands, and agricultural areas, but still the appetite for freehold
possessions was unsatisfied. It had merely been lulled for a time, but was
not appeased. The gold-hunger with some was now abated, and a more
comfortable form of life was desired. Although many concessions had in
practice been made to the popular wants, still the system of land sales
was as obstructive as ever ; the quantity provided by the Survey Depart-
ment was ridiculously out of proportion to the requirements felt; the
whole working was strongly tinged with red-tapeism, favouritism, and
secrecy, and suspicions of corruption attached to it. Men got tired of
the stinted supply slowly and grudgingly given, and of the wretched
jugglery with which it was hampered. Most of the grazing runs re-
mained untouched by the diggings, and these lay temptingly in view of
the landless public. The disappointed applicants began to say that
they could find land for themselves if the runs were thrown open, so ? un-
locking the lands? and ? free selection? began to be talked of.
While these changes were going on the squatters had been bene-
fiting by the markets which had opened for their stock. Some had made
money; others felt the change only in their creditors taking advantage of
better prices to foreclose; the want of hired men had prostrated some,
but led the more pushing to devices for saving labour. However, the
difficulties incidental to the times had generally deterred fresh capital
from grazing investments up to the year 1854, when Sydney and Mel-
bourne became full of money, and new banks were formed to club hoarded
earnings and put them in circulation. About the same time it began to
be said that the annual supply of fat stock was falling off, and that the
flocks and herds would not stand the drain caused by the diggings and
the towns. Whether there was any ground for this opinion or not, the
attention of monied men was drawn to squatting, and a rise in prices
took place. Buyers of stations and stock became plentiful; banks and
merchants were eager to give their assistance, and speculation set in.
Stocked sheep-runs, which three years before were worth only 6s. per head,
were now sold readily at 205., and numbers of squatters took the chance
to sell and leave the country. Many of them up to the time of this
sudden rise in prices had barely been able to pay interest and wages, but
through this unexpected change they became all at once wealthy men
without effort and without design. It was naturally supposed by out-
siders that the large sums thus made were the added profits of many
years? successful exertion, and of course hundreds were glad to pay large
premiums to enter a pursuit in which money appeared to be made in
abundance. Had they known the real facts they would have saved their


money, as since they have nearly all come to grief. But it was long
before the unsoundness of these investments was acknowledged. The
banks and commercial firms that benefited chiefly by the station-jobbing
which took the place of squatting could not allow that to he an unsound
system which gave them 15 and 20 per cent yearly upon their advances,
these advances being in the form of hills renewed every six months, with
interest and commission added. It was common for a new beginner with
�3OOO or �4OOO to buy a station for �15,000 or �20,000, depositing
his money, and giving bills at one, two, and three years, for the balance.
The stock was commonly inferior in quality, having been bred merely to
swell the number for sale, and the buyers were generally unacquainted
with squatting matters, and after their purchase they were usually kept
in such embarrassment with money complications that they rarely could
find time to attend to their proper work, so that almost invariably it
turned out that the stock did not pay working expenses.
The bills not being taken up when due, assistance had to be sought
from merchants or agents, and after it came to this the career of a
squatter was very short. About three years generally saw the original
debt doubled, and the station again in the market.
A new buyer was soon got, and was put through the same process ;
indeed there are many stations which have ruined three or four different
purchasers during the last fifteen years, and at the same time have
realised handsome profits for the ingenious financiers who turned the
handle of the machine. Such a state of things could only have lasted so
long by every engine being kept at work to support a fictitious value.
Immigrants with capital were carefully watched from the time they left
their ships, and their introductions in Sydney and Melbourne were inevi-
tably directed to the very quarters where they were certain to be stripped
of their money. Bankers and merchants had stations on hand which
they wanted to sell. One customer had got the length of his tether, and
it was time to ? boil him down ? and get a new one into the concern.
The ?new chum? was welcomed with such cordiality, that he felt he
could not do better than place himself in the hands of his business friends.
If he travelled through the country to look out for himself, unless he
had the gift of seeing below the surface he could learn little to do him
good. As every man hoped to sell to advantage, of course he would
hear little disparagement of the common interest. Very few would
let him know that the ground was undermined, and if told so, he
would likely not believe it.
Now the time had arrived when it might have been expected that 1855 to
the Australians would have set their house in order, by adopting some 1859. ,
generally practicable land system, but most of the men to whom this
should have been a duty were entirely taken up with money-making.
Occasionally a voice was raised prompting some settlement of the
question before it should be taken in hand by excited multitudes, and
perhaps the welfare of the community sacrificed to some momentary
caprice. The various legislatures, however, did nothing but patch and
cobble, and the evil day was postponed. The squatting party still main-
tained their claim to ? Fixity of Tenure,? and ridiculed the idea that any
other distribution of the land could be possible, or could be of advantage


to the country. Reflection should have shown them that a compromise
was their true policy. They had seen how their squatting rights
vanished like smoke before the spread of the diggings, and they ought to
have known that when the same multitudes really required land in
quantity for actual settlement, their grazing tenures, however they might
interpret them, would be treated like waste paper. The impetus which
had been given to grazing ought to have shown them that the lands
they occupied had from that very cause acquired an enhanced value in
the eyes of the public, while their continued assertion that the country
was fit only for grazing in large tracts was looked upon as an interested
perversion of fact. The opportunity was very favourable for a fair settle-
ment of the question, and if wise foresight and public spirit had influ-
enced the times, it would have been better for all. More people were
coming to the colonies than could be well employed on the gold-fields ;
money was abundant, and there were thousands of men with families,
who would have jumped at the chance of getting freehold homesteads, or
farms either for agriculture or grazing. The prevailing impulse to
invest in stock and runs, might, there is little doubt, had'the land law
allowed it, have been directed into freehold settlement with much greater
advantage to the country, than in the form it took. Moreover, in the
general good humour of the times, the squatters might have made much
better terms for themselves than they could have done either before or
since. But, infatuated with the delirium which precedes a fall, they hooted
all proposals for reducing the size of their runs, or of allowing the public
to share in their territories. Several measures, aiming at this object,
were introduced in the Sydney and Melbourne Assemblies, but popular
excitement on the question had not yet come to a head, and they were
thrown out. There had been, in fact, as yet, no serious consideration
given to the matter by those most interested in a fair arrangement. ? Let
us make money, sell out, and be off; and let those who come after us take
care of themselves ! ? This was the general cry of the squatting and
commercial men, crazed with the speculation which was rampant. The
great body of the people likewise for long cared little for the matter.
Flushed with the riches which were being squandered everywhere, and with
the possession of a popular government, their pet idea was to have plenty
of public works, and a lavish expenditure of public money. Proud of the
wealth which their country produced, they wanted to have at once hand-
some public buildings, railways, and all the other appliances of civilisa-
tion ; and, pleased like children with a new toy, they bragged of the
thousands of pounds which the Assemblies, elected by themselves, voted
away, and thought it a shame to save a penny.
But still a small sturdy faction, represented by a portion of the press,
never let the land question drop. They continued to point out that
eventually the people must find their living and their homes on the soil;
the strength of the party daily increased, and the cry of ? Unlock the
lands,? at first little noticed, was repeated until it became a political
watchword.


Thus stood matters till the year 1860, when the squatting leases
issued in 1846 began to fall in, and the question as to the renewal of
these had to be decided. It was soon clear that the solution wonld not
be easy. The partial discontent with the land laws which had been
growing for some years now assumed a special significance, and suddenly
swelled to a portentous murmur. Emerging from a state of only qualified
disapproval, the public mind became all at once highly excited, and the
question of the day was echoed through every street and in every camp.
The popular press, anxious to feed the newly-awakened appetite, worked
the topic up most sedulously, and the land question was like a fresh
stock-in-trade. It was amazing how much was now made of it, and even
more singular that during many years of perfect liberty so few people had
taken any interest in the matter. Wonderful stores of information came
out about the interior wilds. Men who had never been farther than a
town ?bus would take them spoke with weight and decision of the won-
derful agricultural resources which remained undeveloped in the vague
regions called ?The Bush.? It was discovered that a land monopoly
existed, which was perfectly true, or at least had been so ? and if the press
had been content with exposing the evils in existence, and had led the
public mind to the consideration of a rational reform, it would have done
well. The substantial grounds of complaint had been in reality much
diminished, the land monopoly had been half dissolved by the gold dis-
covery, and what remained to be done was more properly a subject for
compromise than for popular denunciation. But antipathies which should
have been allayed were again aroused, and the subject was far too tempt-
ing for a moderate line of argument.
The squatter was placarded as the public enemy, and ? Delenda est
Carthago? was the key-note struck. Australia depicted as it should be
?namely, a paradise of corn-fields and orchards inhabited by a prosperous
and enlightened people ; contrasted with Australia as it was?namely, a
dismal wilderness, ruled by a gang half aristocrats and half barbarians?
presented a view of the question very striking if not very correct. The
enticing personalities which could be introduced in pointing out certain
individuals as robbers of the public lands were much approved, and the
ingenuity which showed that all the ills that ever came to the colony were
caused by the squatters had a good deal more point than truth. So on
the devoted heads of the squatters of the day the popular Nemesis poured
the vials of wrath. This was much finer reading, and paid better, than a
rational inquiry into the pros and cons of the question. Nothing could
have been more unfair than to charge the squatters of 1860 with the
evils now in existence, far less with those which had passed away. Most
of them had bought what they would, have been glad to be rid of, but no
distinction was made. The ?new chums,? who had been stripped to
enrich the men of 1850, were all put in the same category, and were
roundly abused as public robbers. This was not the way to bring about an
amicable adjustment of the question. The squatters, true to their colours,
hurled back the anathemas of their opponents, and, faithful to the tradi-
tions of their predecessors, vowed that they would not yield an inch.


The exasperation which attended the discussion of the land question
is much to be deplored, as it prevented the moderate men on either side
from getting a hearing. That which was really needed by the public was
an intelligible and efficient law which would enable all who wanted land
for real use to get it at a suitable price. What the squatters? interest
really required was not the exclusive occupancy of enormous tracts of
land, but a real tenure of a certain extent, with compensation for such
improvements as might have been made on the lands resumed by the
Government.
But neither party would listen to moderate counsels. The downfall
of the hostile class became far more the object of the popular party than
a fair adjustment of differences ; and when the Sydney Assembly entered
upon the question, faction was too powerful for reason to have sway.
Under these circumstances ? free selection? was established by law,
and as the various pastoral leases terminated the lands were thrown open.
A large extent of the country became at once available for selectors, and
the entire Crown lands of the colony were thrown into the market four
years afterwards. New leases were issued to the squatters, but these
being subject to unrestricted encroachment both by selectors and gold-
miners, as well as liable to intrusion by the Government, the rights con-
veyed were very limited. The lessee of a run became merely a tenant-
at-will, and his pasture was often little better than commonage. A
selector could take up 320 acres on payment of ss. per acre, and along
with this he acquired a grazing right over three times that area of vacant
land adjoining. He paid in annual rent 9d. per acre on his ? conditional
purchase,? and at the rate of �2 per square mile (or 640 acres) for his
grazing right. The selection could be made into a freehold by effecting
certain improvements on the land, and by making up the payment to �1
per acre, but the grazing right was liable to purchase by other selectors.
Females and children were allowed to select, so that a family clubbing
together could take up a good deal of land.
In looking at this Act by the light of the past, it cannot be doubted
that, with all its imperfections, vindictive and ill-considered as it was, it
was still a step in advance. Certainly the interests of the squatters met
with no consideration, but their unreasonable opposition to all change
makes this in no way surprising. After all, a general land-scramble is a
much better thing than the dead-lock which was fastened on the grazing
country. Of the two extremes,? rather let us have the freedom of the
Bedouin?s desert than the farce of sham colonisation and commercial
jobbery which the history of squatting shows.
But there were alternatives possible equally removed from the Scylla
on the right and the Charybdis on the left ; and now that the heat of the
conflict has abated, and mew light has been shed on the arena, there is
every prospect of the doings of ten years ago being revised with advantage.
Strange to tell, squatter and selector in New South Wales now make
the same complaint?namely, that they have no tenure which allows
them to get the full benefit of their grazing rights. When a community
of interest like this is shown, a fair adjustment is almost inevitable, but
the turn which the question has taken in these latter days is so unex-
pected that some explanation is needed.


The extension of agricultural settlement was the avowed object of the
Selection Act, and its promoters seem never to have doubted that the
cultivation of the soil would be the main, if not the sole, purpose to
which the land so taken up would be applied. As years went on, experi-
ence brought many disappointments to the agriculturists. A good year
sometimes brought heavy crops, without, in many cases, accessible
markets ; a bad season showed labour lost. No method of farming
suitable to the climate or country had yet been found out, and with true
British doggedness, the selectors were slow to move in adapting them-
selves to their position. They ploughed patches of their land, and grew
grain and potatoes. When the crops failed, which they did pretty often,
they grumbled, but made few experiments otherwise, and eventually they
found that their surest mainstay consisted in their small stocks of cattle.
Others became sheep-farmers, and ran their flocks over the adjoining
grazing rights of different selections clubbed together. Thus, the agri-
cultural character of selection was much modified, and in some districts
it became almost as much a grazing interest as squatting itself. But the
selectors are hampered by the small extent of pasture to which they are
confined, and by the unsafe tenure on which their grazing rights are held.
Grazing had always been in the popular mind associated with the
squatting system and its objectionable features, and it was not supposed
that the occupation could take any other form. It was assumed when
the bill passed that all the lands would be wanted sooner or later for the
plough, and consequently no provision was made except for temporary
pasture.
The grazing rights thrown in with the selections were for the time
little valued, and that they existed at all was more from the suggestion
of the few men with practical experience of country pursuits who sup-
ported the bill than from any deliberate intention of the party.
For the Act was carried mainly by the townspeople and the gold-
miners. Those members of the Assembly who had been long in the
country were nearly all on the other side. But it has turned out that
the right thus casually acquired comprises the chief value of a selection,
and the desire to increase the extent of the holdings under the grazing
right, and to substitute a better tenure, is now general.
The squatters have approached the same stage of conviction through
the stringent pressure of the Selection Act, and also through the influence
of another cause ?namely, the discovery that the grazing country con-
tained great capabilities of improvement, but that these could be de-
veloped with advantage only on lands held under secure conditions of
occupancy.
The scarcity and high cost of labour caused by the gold discovery had
led to the experiment of keeping sheep and cattle within fences. It was
found that both the pasture and the .stock benefited greatly under this
plan, and that a grazing property could be managed without being so
much dependent on hired labour as formerly. It appeared on trial that a
?run? fenced and subdivided into a good many paddocks, and moderately
fed down, had a tendency to become more productive from year to year ;
grass thickened, water stood better, and the stock being less harassed
generally improved.


But the effect of the Selection Law made these improvements very
precarious, because there is no part of a run in New South Wales secure
from its operation, and portions of land may be taken up with their
boundaries intersecting the squatter?s fences, or within his enclosures.'
The only protection by which the squatter can secure his paddocks is
found in what is called the ? Improvement Clause.? This enables any
one to buy land to any extent at the price of �1 per acre, provided he has
expended a like sum on its permanent improvement. But the amount of
outlay necessary is prohibitive except in some special cases. For instance,
a paddock of 3000 acres would cost �5OO for fencing in. To secure the
same under the Improvement Clause would cost �6OOO. So that any
improvement of squatting runs is ? attended with considerable risk, and
the further progress of grazing as a branch of skilled industry is allowed
no scope in the squatting districts. In those parts of New South Wales
where the old freehold grants are situated, further attempts at improving
grazing lands led to very important results. It was found that by killing
off the forest timber the growth of grass increased greatly, qnd that some
imported grasses could be grown with advantage. Inferior country, by
these means, became as productive as the best squatting runs, and cattle
actually fatten now in places where formerly they would barely live. So
much have these improvements neutralised the effects of poor soil and
adverse climate.
These demonstrated facts have turned the attention of all stock-
owners into a new channel, and the general improvement of pasture is
now only retarded by the incongruities of the land laws.
Thus, the squatter?s ambition in these latter days has been directed
to the very same point as the selector?s?namely, to*a better tenure of a
certain area for actual use, not to the exclusive retention of huge wastes
unimproved as formerly. At this present stage of transition, after eight
years of selection, one peculiarity in the way the land has been taken up
is very obvious, and induces reflections unfavourable to the wisdom of the
Act of 1861.
The pernicious tendency first displayed in the exercise of the pre-
emptive right, used as that was in buying up the most valuable spots,
was renewed in an equally prejudicial manner under the Selection Act.
The justification of indiscriminate selection is, that selectors know best
what laud suits them, and, within limits, this is reasonable ? but the ob-
jection apparent now is that the ? eyes have been picked out of the
country,? as people say, and many large tracts have been made useless by
two or three selections. The most crying abuse is that, under cover of
the law, selections have been made not for use, but with the view of coerc-
ing squatters; and large sums have been spent in buying off selectors
from positions which had their sole value from the injury which their
owners were enabled to inflict on the adjoining runs.
This, it may be said, is only turning the tables. The old squatters
clutched their lands' in an iron monopoly, and their successors have to pay
black mail for leave to run their stock.
The lessees of 1846 picked the country under the pre-emptive law,
and the selectors have picked it more thoroughly, and have sometimes
turned their advantages into coin.


If retaliation is to be the aim and end of our legislation, no doubt
this may be justified, but if the beneficial occupation of the country and
the settlement of population are to be the objects in view, then these pro-
ceedings, in both instances, must be admitted to be mischievous, the one
as much so as the other, and the principle which authorised them must
be condemned.
Indiscriminate selection is clearly indefensible, either in policy or in
justice, so long as a penny of grazing rent is charged. Another fallacy
which underlies the whole is an inheritance from the Wakefield system ?
namely, the price of �1 per acre. From the high price and the limited
areas allowed, the consequence is that the extent of land sold is only in
fractional proportion to that made unsaleable. For example, on a run of
100,000 acres, the squatter will likely have bought 3000 acres in ten or
twelve separate portions, and, if there are ten selectors in the same run
with 320 acres each, this will make about twenty small lots sold all over
the run, or 6200 purchased out of 100,000 acres, and the remainder
made unsaleable. This is the result of ?selection? with Wakefields
? sufficient ? price.
Now this same run may be dealt with differently, and the results
shown will illustrate one of the tendencies towards grazing reform which
influence people?s minds at present.
If sold in ? the gross??that is ; without picking, and not at the suffi-
cient price, but at an ? improving ? price?there will be various advan-
tages. First, in regard to the amount realised -by the sale.
100,000 acres at an ?improving price,? 2s. 6d. per acre, �12,500
against 6,200 ? ? sufficient price,? �1 ? 6,200
Balance in favour of the ? improving price,? . . �6,300
or, in ? the gross,? 2s. 6d. against Is. 3d. per acre. So much for the
money result. This change in the method of sale would only be altering
the conditions of selection from an agricultural to a grazing basis, with
the additional advantage that it dissipated grounds of contention and
brought in more money to the treasury. Further, the respective areas
of land purchasable by the squatter and the selectors could be main-
tained in certain proportions, with this proviso, that all the holdings of
one man or family should be massed together.
The obvious advantage to all is that both squatters and selectors could
acquire possession of land sufficient to work their stock and free from the
risk of intrusion, thus enabling them to carry out thorough improvements,
while the field for jobbery would be greatly narrowed.
Ideas like these, or similar in their tendencies, are now common
among the thinking men of the day.
In Queensland, the Legislature, influenced by the defects of the New
South Wales Act, passed a law in the year 1868, which aimed at placing
the sale of their lands on a better footing. The Queenslanders saw the
advantage of dealing with grazing as a permanent interest, avoiding the
fallacy into which the older colony had fallen of treating that industry as
a merely transitory condition of things. They reduced the price of land,
and granted a valid lease to the squatters of certain portions of their
runs. The runs were divided in two, as equally as possible, and one half


of each was thrown open to selection. For convenience, the lands were
separately classed and valued according to their capabilities. The ordi-
nary pastures of the country, called second-class pastoral lands, could be
purchased in any quantity up to 7680 acres at ss. per acre; the best of
the grazing country, called first-class pastoral, in quantities up to 2560
acres at 10s., and the ? agricultural lands,? being the rich soils which
could be cultivated with advantage, in portions up to 640 acres at 15s.
Deferred payments extending over ten years gave buyers a further advan-
tage besides the reduced price. This arrangement applied to all districts
near the coast. In the inland districts, different leases were framed to
meet the wishes of the squatters, but the runs are all liable to resump-
tion by the Legislature ; and all the unoccupied country, of which there
is an immense extent, is open to selection in unrestricted areas, as second-
class pastoral lands, that is, at ss. per acre with deferred payments. This
act is a great advance on those in operation in the other colonies, and
though it might be simplified with advantage, still it will undoubtedly
prove of great benefit to Queensland.
In Victoria, selection is established on a basis purely agricultural in
320 acre areas. In the last act deferred payments have been adopted,
but the price of 20s. is retained. South Australia deals with her lands
somewhat in the same way as Victoria. Land legislation suitable to New
South Wales and Queensland must be applicable to the greater part of
the continent, while that of Victoria can be suitable only for her com-
paratively small territory, her European climate, and larger population.
The last prominent event, bringing us to the present day, is the
squatting stampede in Queensland, which got to its height about five
years ago, and of which the relics are being swept up now.
This has repeated all the old evils of the squatting system in an
exaggerated form?namely, forced speculation, jobbery, and misdirection
of energy.
Even the squatters themselves, the nominal owners of these newly-
formed runs, are getting tired of their cumbrous stations, worked solely
for creditors, and ruinous to all who touch them, and now that debtors
and creditors are being swept together into a common abyss of ruin, a
new state of things may arise based on sounder principles.
The main obstacle to innovation, either in the character of the tenure
or in the form of grazing, has at all times been the indebted condition of
the squatters.
Any change of system, though palpably for the better, would lessen
the apparent value of their securities, and thus, though their chance of
recovery is desperate, they cling to their huge waste runs and thousands
of worthless'sheep like sailors to a sinking ship.
There is little doubt that, with good stock and small holdings, their
affairs might be brought within a compass which would make their
individual exertions beneficial in the manner shown in the settled districts
of New South Wales. But there seems to be some charm in the nominal


possession of a station which nothing short of absolute ruin will dissipate.
Many a man would much rather be a big squatter deep in debt than a
sheep farmer working on his own land. However, they have this time
had a lesson which should open their eyes, if anything can, to the true
principles of stock management, as well as to the secrets of finance.
Queensland was separated from New South Wales in 1809, and the
young colony proved for many years a magnet, attracting settlers from
the older colonies and immigrants from Europe, The exploration of the
unoccupied country had been pushed on by the pioneer squatters for some
time before, and a strong desire arose all over Australia for the possession
of stock and runs in the north. The squatting speculation which set in
in 1854 was still kept at red heat in spite of frequent disasters, and it
spread to this new field. All who had money or credit, and plenty who
had neither, crowded the steamers for the northern ports, and the
stock roads were trodden bare by the sheep and cattle coming from New
South Wales, for everything sold well for ready money, and the promised
land was said to be found at last. Lucky diggers, successful store-
keepers, from Ballarat and Melbourne; doctors, divines, and barristers
from Sydney, fiddlers, farriers, publicans, and sinners of all kinds from
everywhere; ?new chums? from England, armed with cheque-books
and letters of introduction?all started for Brisbane and Rockhampton to
make fortunes; or those who did not go in person paid their money to
smart ?pioneers? and ?promoters? for shares in concerns which were as
yet?on paper.
An Act was passed by the Queensland Legislature attaching the con-
dition of actual occupation with stock to the tenancy of runs, and this
rather added to the furore, as it seemed plain that unless one was
?smart? there would be neither country nor stock to be had. Young
bushmen mounted their horses, started inland, and when they got beyond
the limits of the runs they marked half-a-dozen trees with their toma-
hawks, surveyed huge tracts ? by rule of thumb,? wrote out descriptions
often attractive, but seldom intelligible, and sold the goodwill of their dis-
coveries for sums three and four figures long.
The sheep-breeders made their own of the Occupation Act. The
pressing need led the young squatters to buy any stock they could get,
good, bad, or indifferent, at prices fully three times the intrinsic value.
They often paid 15s. and 16s. for pure-bred three-year-old Darling Downs
ewes, and it is said that they sometimes got delivery, instead, of aged
veterans, which had broken their teeth against the New England granite
years before.
Now Sydney mortgagees rejoiced. Huge arrears of interest and com-
mission were wiped off as northern remittances came down, and banks and
agents laid their plans for further hauls.
They affected a maidenly coyness sometimes to the small working
squatter, but when they met with a man of the ? right sort? -that is a
speculator with cheek of brass and conscience of rhinoceros hide they
backed his luck. These veteran jobbers pursued the ? new chum ? trade
with a vigour and success unknown before. Heavy sums were bagged in
England for interests in Queensland, and the ? new chum buyer after his
arrival afforded good picking for some years before his carcass was finally


thrown into the boiler. Respectable city families dropped their �50.000
and �IOO,OOO to Queensland touters, and got in exchange squattages of dry
plains and cull sheep. A leading bell-wether kept by one of the banks,
having absorbed a quarter of a million in discounts, went to England with
a benevolent plan for making up his deficiency by taking the working
classes into partnership in �5 shares, but it is said that he was met on
landing by another speculator who threatened to blow up his scheme.
London firms incautiously entered into Queensland business, but their
capital was soon swept down the vortex.
At last all the interest and diplomacy of the commercial world
failed to keep up the house of cards which had been built. Almost no
returns were got from the stock. They were mostly bad from the first, and
were made worse by being harassed and travelled hard to take up distant
runs, and enough buyers could not be got to keep up artificial prices.
This broken-down speculation has left hundreds of squattages in the
hands of the mortgagees. These are exactly forfeited pawn pledges, and
as there is little chance of realising any value from them, the abandonment
of large tracts of country has commenced. The sheep are being travelled
to the southern markets and to the boiling pots, if possible, to save a
shilling or two from total loss ; the squatting rents are no longer paid,
and buildings and fencing, which have cost heavy sums, are deserted and
at the mercy of the elements. But no opportunity will be lost to sell
any of these properties to credulous or sanguine buyers, and it is not
unlikely that representations, founded on the prospect of meat-curing prov-
ing successful, and on the probability of a rise in prices from other causes,
may be successful in bringing about sales.
Properties consisting of millions of acres and thousands of live stock
present a very tempting aspect to English buyers, and it is not easy to
convince them of the worthlessness, far less of the actual danger of enter-
ing into such investments ; but palpable proof can be brought forward
which ought to suffice to place them on their guard.
It will be said that at present prices investments cannot fail to pay.
Stocked runs will be offered at ss. per head, which ten years ago sold at
20s. and 255., so that four stations may be bought now for the price of
one, and a purchaser will be advised that the more stock he buys, the
more profitable it will prove. If it can be shown that each sheep has
been kept at a net profit of so many pence or shillings annually, then an
investment may be worth examining with the view of buying for cash,
but in no event would a purchase on credit be advisable. If an annual
surplus cannot be shown, but, on the contrary, an o. 'lay of 3d. or 6d. per
sheep in excess of the produce realised, then he has the data for an easy
calculation. 20,000 sheep showing a deficiency of 3d. per head will re-
present an annual loss of �250, so that if he got the station for nothing
he would lose money by it, and the more sheep he bought, the more
money he would lose every year. This would be estimating the current
working expenses against the value of the annual produce?namely, the
wool, the sheep sold or boiled, and the increase j and the result could be
verified in the history of nine out of ten of the northern stations.
If the calculation were made to include the interest on borrowed
money, then, assuming an average liability and the common rate of


interest, the yearly deficiency would be about Is. 6d. per head. In short,
if he got the station as a gift, he would be �250 out of pocket every year
by it. If he bought it on credit for the amount of the debt, he would
lose �ISOO a year by it.
This statement applies to one part of Australia, but there is good
ground for the surmise that a false standard of value has been adopted
in all parts. If it is not so, it may be asked what befell all the men who
bought in the ? good times 1 ? Where are they, and where is their
money 1 Also, how is it that hardly a month passes without one hearing
of the collapse of some shepherd king in Sydney or Melbourne?men with
stations in the heart of the colonies, and whose names were, till their
smash, upheld by their creditors, the banks, as good for hundreds of
thousands 1
The banks and money-lending firms have always secured the lion?s
share of the squatting profits, and even when stations have been worked
at a loss, a traffic which poured wealth into Sydney was maintained for
many years, through forced prices and an artificial market, created by the
influence which directed the application of imported funds. To judge
whether a trade of this character can be held legitimate, in which the
advantages have been entirely on one side, is difficult, unless the duties
and moralities of commerce are clearly defined ' but the practical inference
for our present purpose is, that there is immense risk for monied
immigrants in buying stations or other properties offered to them either
for cash or on credit. No introductions that they can get in England
will avail them in Sydney, or in any other colonial community, for their
protection, so completely is every interest involved in these objectionable
dealings, and so thoroughly unscrupulous is the colonial conscience in
procuring the introduction of capital. One would think that a wise and
far-seeing policy would cherish a higher standard of integrity, for the sake
of the ultimate results, as well as for the guerdon of an honourable repu-
tation ; but with the men who hold the controlling power, the oppor-
tunities to amass heavy profits produce general carelessness for all other
considerations. There are no doubt some few business men in Australia,
who, seeing these things, refrain from their practice, scrupulously and
honourably; but individuals are little better than spokes in a wheel?they
cannot influence an established system. There are many more who never
understand all the bearings of the transactions in which they take part.
Use and habit show only one side of a question, and business jargon and
forms obscure realities to many minds.
As to banks and other corporations, presumptive right not only
releases them from the incumbrance of conscience, but it supplies them
with a special standard of morals which acknowledges no duty except to
their own shareholders. These facts are plainly put forward for the
guidance of intending immigrants with money, and no description of
Australian affairs would be true which omitted to mention, or failed
to place these facts in the strongest light.
The abandoned country will yet be taken up again. Richly grassed
and well watered for Australia, with mineral wealth scattered widely over
it, a population will straggle back to it in time. But it is to be hoped
that its day of large squatting concerns is over, and that the next


attempt at settlement will be less ambitious but more durable. People
are beginning to suspect already that there must be some way of living in
such a country, even without the hitherto indispensable creditor with his
half-yearly account.
VIII.
Having followed the principal facts of Australian settlement down to
the present day, tracing the rise and progress of different interests, the
reverses caused by unsound speculation, and the difficulties clogging the
growth of real prosperity, it is now easy to apply these facts to the ques-
tion of emigration.
The means through which new-comers in number must find subsist-
ence can only be either by working for wages in the standard industries,
or by following some known pursuits by which the colonists live at the
present time. There is one remaining alternative certainly by which
multitudes of people might be provided for, namely by co-operative settle-
ment ; but neither the laws of the colonies nor the habits and education
of the emigrants would allow of such schemes being undertaken at pre-
sent. Perhaps, when a new page on ? co-operation ? has been written in
the book of political economy, the attempt may be made with success ;
or it may be that some Government, in these days of innovation, may
commission Mr. Carlyle?s industrial Captains and Colonels for a warfare
with poverty in our inland wilds.
But, in the meantime, if numbers of people are to come here, the
majority must find their living in either of the four following methods :
Gold-mining, hired labour on squatting stations, as farmers or selectors,
or on the public works.
There are many subordinate and infant industries, but to state that
these can for long provide for any number of immigrants would be wil-
fully to mislead.
Then let us look first at the gold-fields, to see what they offer. These
have already been represented as showing a steady though slow decline
in their production, in spite of new diggings being constantly opened,
while at the same time the number of miners seems to increase. The old
diggings, the richest yet found, have completely changed in form. The
ground having been worked over and over again, the mere pick and shovel
men can no longer earn a living on them, and the heavy work now need-
ful to get the gold is done by companies. The skilled labour and
machinery necessary place gold-mining on these fields in the same position
as coal and iron mines elsewhere, and much the same system is followed
out. Some of the old diggers are shareholders in these mines, others are
working for companies on wages, and many thousands of them form a
migratory population, who follow every new ?rush,? as it is called, and
travel hundreds of miles in search of ? payable ? gold country. By them
many new gold-fields have been opened up, but there never are profits
enough to maintain all who are searching.
These swarms of miners, many of them skilled men who have followed
gold-digging ever since they could work, are to be found in dozens
?prospecting? every mountain range and river on the eastern side of
Australia; and, as many of them never earn more than a living, it is


easy to understand that gold-digging is not an occupation that will give
subsistence to many thousands of new hands, though there may be always
employment and good chances for a moderate number. The wages paid to
able-bodied miners on the fields of New South Wales and Victoria are
from 355, to �2 ; 10s. per week, the men keeping themselves, and plenty
of men can generally be got at these rates. Only certain classes of emi-
grants would be able for this work. So much for one great industry of
Australia ; now for another.
The disasters which befell the squatting interest have been detailed,
and also the changes in the method of keeping stock by fencing which are
becoming general. From both these causes the labour required now on
stations is very small as compared with former times.
When the owners of a station have come to ruin, the mortgagees
generally dismiss all the people employed, except those necessary to keep
the stock together, so that ordinarily two men out of three are paid off;
and this has been the case in a great many of the northern runs. Again,
where fencing has been largely practised, the owners are able to do with-
out shepherds, so that on a run which formerly kept forty or fifty men
seven or eight only find employment. While fences are being erected
there is profitable work to be had, but after they are finished, the
country, formerly very sparsely inhabited, becomes actually depopulated.
It is said that after the runs in Riverina were fenced, six hundred men,
many with families, had to leave the district. From this it will be
readily understood that the depopulation of the grazing runs is not solely
owing to depression in pastoral interests, but also to this change in the
method of working ? and if squatting were to become [more profitable
than ever, the only result would be the fencing of all the grazing country,
so that fewer hands still would be wanted for working the stock.
Therefore, employment on stations, formerly one great resource for the
immigrant, is now to be looked to much less than some years ago.
The public works carried on by the various Governments of New
South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, have been next in importance in
maintaining the population of the colonies during the last ten years ; but
as these works are almost completed, at least as far as the finances of the
colonies will permit, a large mass of labour, both skilled and unskilled,
has thus been pushed on the gold-fields, crowded into the towns, and even
driven out of the colonies. To give an idea of the number of men thus
employed, it may be mentioned that 700 miles of railway and many
thousand miles of road and telegraph line have been made, besides public
buildings, harbour works, and coast lights?works which, when once
constructed, are made for good. But, in any case, the public works as a
source of employment must be dismissed from the calculation of emi-
grants, as the load of debt already incurred for such purposes has been
far beyond the resources of the colonies, and further outlay would be
ruinous. Moreover, if the facts in connection with the finances were
known, the money could not be borrowed.
With respect to farming, in discussing selection enough has been said
to explain the very immature state of that interest. In fact, no such
self-supporting interest can be said to have grown yet, and it is impossible
to tell farmers what they could do with advantage in Australia.


In Queensland, cattle or sheep could he kept in combination with some
kind of tillage on purchased land. In New South Wales, the same could
not be done with security at present. In Victoria and South Australia,
arable farming may be pursued on a small scale near towns or in other
favourable positions. A small capital laid out in a selection might keep
a family, but money could not be made by it. Selectors rarely employ
hired labour, so that there is no opening in this branch of industry except
for a man who takes a farm himself. Vine-growing and sugar-culture
promise to employ a population at some future day, but they have not
approached this state yet.
As to the emigrants with nothing whatever in their pockets, thinking
of living on their twenty or thirty acres by spade husbandry, as is gener-
ally recommended to them by the immigration agents, it is the most
execrable absurdity, as the agents well know when they promise them
the land. Let them think what they are to do, placed on a patch of
ground in the middle of a waste forest or a dry plain, without a roof,
without a fence, without a stock of food, and probably a mile from the
nearest water, for this would inevitably be the case with nine out of ten.
The men must of course take the first paid job they can get, and they
will most likely sell their land-order for a few pounds to the labour-agent
who hires them.
Look plainly then at what a selection is. For a hard-working man
with a few hundred pounds it is, in most cases, but a home and a bare
living; it is a capital auxiliary as a homestead for a man who has another
string to his bow; for example, to a carrier, a contractor, a gold-miner,
or a shearer. It is quite useless to a man without money or other
resources; and to a regular farmer, it merely gives an opportunity to
make experiments with very little local experience to guide him. Such
is all that can be said of farming in Australia. The prospect of a change
for the better hinges upon two points?namely, improved land laws, and
increased knowledge of what can be done with the country.
We have now dissected the four forms of employment which have
supported the colonists for the last ten years, and have observed their
condition at the present day. First, there are the gold-mines, offering
an opening to a limited number of men possessed of endurance and
physical strength ; next, the grazing interest in its changed condition,
employing only a small population; then the public works, which have
supported tens of thousands for years, but have now nearly ceased, and
are unlikely to be renewed; and farming, which undoubtedly offers an
opening to small capitalists, but in its immature state can show but few
inducements.
Emigrants may be told, as they usually are, that any number can get
paying farms, and any number can get profitable work; but as sure as
some thousands of people come to Australia beyond the average yearly
number, so certainly will there be beggars on the high road and riots in
the towns. Witness the state of Brisbane four years ago, full of un-
employed immigrants, and the mendicancy which is always cropping to
the surface in Sydney and Melbourne.


The results of this analysis seem almost incredible, but inquiry among
the colonists will soon prove the reality of the facts detailed, and the
soundness of the inferences can be easily tested. It seems monstrous
that a territory so immense and so thinly peopled should not be able to
provide subsistence for millions more; while it is undeniable that the
Muntiy produecs many of the necessaries of life, and that its exports of
gold and wool, and its millionaires, are as household words in the world
of commerce.
. The whole evidence tends to show that colonisation has not yet got
into the right groove, and that the energies of the colonists have been
mis-directed.
Ask an Australian ?what the lands of the colonies are for,? and he
will answer unhesitatingly ?to make money by;? and this is the
standard idea. They have no value except for speculation or for bor-
rowing.
To live from the produce of the soil, to gather solid comforts round
him, to acquire cheap independence and plenty by the labour of his hands
and to do without superfluities until wealth is secured ; this is the way
for a colonist or a people to prosper, and this is the story of American
colonisation, but it is not what the Australian has been taught He has
seen wasteful living and wild speculation around him for the last twenty
years. Nowhere has he seen the steady labour and the daily thrifty
routine of people living by their fields, their dairies, and their orchards
A rush on the diggings, the wild riot of a new settlement, fortunes made
by jobbing town lots and adulterating liquor, communities living on fertile
country hundreds of miles inland, and yet importing every article of their
consumption except meat.
This has been the nature of his schooling, and moreover his experi-
ence tells him that when cash gets scarce the Government will be bound
to make railways, or to squander the public funds in some other way in
order to ?keep things lively,? Now, how is it possible that a people
reared in this way could have made any progress in real industrious home-
stead settlement? Jobbery was what they lived on, and when under
selection? a better system became possible, they could not at once
apply themselves to frugal industry,
What_ other results could follow the policy inaugurated under Sir
George Gipps ? The forced concentration and high price of land under
the Wakefield system stopped all sound progress, while the squatting
leases placed a large part of the countiy under an arrangement closely
allied to the monopoly of the Hudson Bay Company.
If the Americans had handed over their forests and prairies to fur-
hunting companies, and had confined their- people within a few seaboard
settlements, the cases would have been nearly parallel. The allotment
�i the land for the greatest good of the greatest number was never studied
after the days of Sir Richard Bourke,
The policy maintained was supposed to produce revenue in the most
advantageous manner, and to favour the investment of capital, and that
there was anything else wanted in laying the foundation of a colony


does not appear to have occurred to any one. So when auriferous wealth
was poured over the face of the land, there were to he found among the
people neither the experience nor the habits which could turn the metal
into solid prosperity and comfort. In place of such improvements, there
occurred scenes of riot and waste like the doings of liberated school-boys,
and a scramble for wealth that sacrificed everything to stock exchange
jobbery. The capitalists themselves have found that the large concessions
yielded to them have proved snares to their ruin. The very arguments
of those who take the value of exports as their sole test of national pros-
perity may now be turned against themselves, since our experience of
grazing shows that under a more economical distribution of the land
the production would be threefold. So that the most essential wants of
colonisation have not only been neglected, but the full advantages aimed
at have not been secured. Truly, if Australia should thrive, it would
not be from the result of her early policy, but in spite of it.
But there is little doubt that a new day is beginning to dawn. Occa-
sional facts are presenting themselves all over the colonies, which show,
even among the varied doings of the ? selectors,? what the real settle-
ment of the country might be, and what there is every hope of its being
yet.
Enough is shown to prove that if some method of real settlement
had been attempted in the early days, holding in view as the problem to
be solved the allotment of the lands for the greatest good of the popula-
tion, we would not now meet with an enigma in the immigration question.
With thousands of real settlers, there would have been hundreds of experi-
ments, and some discoveries would have been undoubtedly made which
would have advanced us twenty years at least in practical knowledge.
With all our existing industries reduced by practice to economic form,
and many new branches opened up, is it likely that we would now be at
a loss to employ immigrants, or unable to turn our lands to the right use 1
Insufficient as the selection system is, and inexperienced as the
selectors may be, results are to be seen which could never have been pro-
duced with the country in the hands of capitalists. In the one case,
there is a population of hired labourers, few in number, and without
stake or interest in the country; in the other an independent resident
community is being brought into life, bound to the soil by the strongest
ties.
Thus the Americans have reared their mighty empire. They sought
first to secure household plenty and individual independence, and wealth
and commerce came to them afterwards.
And so it may be with the Australians, if they build on the solid
rock, and make freehold settlement the basis of their system instead of
the shifting sands of speculation and forced prosperity.'
The doctrine of the sovereignty of capital, and the faith that whatever
is commercially sound must be eternally right and generally beneficial, are
maintained by many. That facts in other countries besides Australia tell a
different tale, the following quotation from a pamphlet on the opium trade
will show :?? Malwa, which for climate and soil is one of the finest dis-
tricts in India, is so largely taken up with the poppy culture that food for
the people has for some years back been partly carried from the valley of


the Nerbudda. I had some years ago the authority of an experienced
and observant eyewitness, then and now at the head of a public depart-
ment, for saying that, while the landholders in Malwa were amassing
money, the poorer classes were in great distress for food.? So it appears
that the rural population of certain parts of India have been starved
because it is more profitable to grow opium than human food. This
seems to show that systems the most advantageous for traders and
capitalists are not necessarily those which are best for the people of any
country; and it justifies the view that in the beginning of a colony the
staples of export are less to be studied than the means of providing for
the settlement of the people. That welfare to the workman and the pub-
lic is best secured by giving free scope to the capitalist is notoriously
untrue in Australia. What did we see to be the result of the squatting
leases 1 4 That the population was driven to the roads and the towns.
What was the result of improving the runs 1 Why, that three men out
of four were discharged after a run was fenced in. That the country can
be reclaimed, made productive, and peopled, without being handed over to
the care of capitalists, is abundantly plain ; and we can at the same time
see the very feeble results in settlement which have taken place under the
auspices of speculators and joint-stock companies.
If we can make up our minds to abjure the religion of commerce and
the worship of capital, it will soon appear that little besides labour and
organisation are needed to find homes and food in Australia for many of
the poor of Great Britain,
Until such ideas find scope under improved institutions, the chances
for an increased number of immigrants making a living in Australia are
twofold:?
1. A large increase in the production of gold all over Australia,
which is contrary to all expectation, our experience showing that, although
many new gold-fields are opened yearly, still the aggregate yield has
steadily declined since the discovery.
2. The adoption of a more successful system of farming. This will
be very gradual, as experiments in husbandry have made but small way
yet.
In addition to the remarks already made as to hired labour, it is neces-
sary to say that numbers of young Australians are yearly filling up
vacancies in all branches, and that they are better fitted for country work
than most immigrants.
This picture of the colonies as fields for labour or enterprise is not
favourable. It is not flattering, but it is true; and if, perchance, bene-
ficial discussion should ensue, these pages will not have been written in
vain.
The greatest enemies to Australian prosperity are A commercial
organisation, rooted in defective laws, forced speculation, and habits of
general improvidence, which sap the life of the working or producing
communities; and the undue predominance of the town constituencies,
acting through a strongly centralised system of government, which drains
the body of the State in order to strengthen influence and promote a
spurious vitality at the heart.
The inhabitants of the principal towns see no evil in either of these


phases of development, as thereby wealth and political influence are
thrown into their hands.
The best remedy for both must be found in the growth of an inde-
pendent rural population, and the truest conservatism, as well as the most
really liberal and humane policy, will be best secured by the settlement of
the waste lands on the widest basis of general interests.
CO-OPERATIVE SETTLEMENT.*
Emigration to Australia has gone on but slowly for some years. Those
who have conducted it have generally confined their attention to either
one of two objects ; namely, the getting rid of the superfluous population
of the mother country, or the supply of the colonies with labour. These
views, practical and natural though they may be, do not meet the whole
question of emigration, either as relates to the welfare of the emigrants,
or the settlement of the colonies.
Wakefield?s scheme professed to found self-supporting communities,
but the defects inherent in its constitution rendered it even less effective
than the hap-hazard want of system which generally has been followed.
Thanks to the diggings and the squatters, the emigrants who have
reached Australia have generally been provided for, but occasionally the
limited labour-market has been over supplied, and more than once a
Colonial Government has been compelled to check the influx.
Meantime, while settlement has thus halted and stumbled, the
phenomena remain of a huge untilled and almost untrodden wilderness in
the Southern Hemisphere, and multitudes landless and struggling for
subsistence in the Northern.
If colonisation, like trade, would work out its own problems by the
law of demand and supply, or if new communities would take root and
thrive on fresh ground by some process like vegetation without fore-
thought or arrangement, then organised schemes would be unnecessary;
but experience has shown that no individual energy, though backed by
the pressure of want, will suffice to carry out the work of settlement on an
extended scale in these colonies.
In the United States, great numbers of immigrants are quietly ab-
sorbed, year after year, by the natural progress of industry ; but Aus-
tralia is very differently placed, as none of her industries have yet reached
a mature stage, and her rate of progress is diminished by many recoils
and a good deal of stagnation.
It is usual for emigration lecturers to point to her boundless territory
and virgin soil as offering homes and subsistence for millions ; but the
precise process by which new-comers are to derive benefit from these
domains is never clearly explained. The colonists, in fact, avail them-
selves of this clap-trap on the same principle that no one criticises his
auctioneer?s advertisement, but details are necessarily left vague, because
in reality the waste lands are mainly used as bait to attract people, in-

stead of being made practically available for their support. The lands
were for long dealt with so capriciously, and distributed in so niggardly
a fashion, that no farming system, capable of supporting a population, has
yet taken root. Of late years the country has been thrown open to
general settlement, but up to the present time, without any great ad-
vance in agricultural practice having followed. Such, indeed, could
hardly be expected, because a new system, as well as a rural population,
had to be created, and the consequence is, that there is a very poor pro-
spect for any immigrant who seeks to make his living from the soil.
The man who comes to Australia to farm finds himself in a strange
world, and surrounded by repelling circumstances. He has to choose his
land from a wilderness of rugged mountain ranges, waterless plains, or
forests among which he can see only an intractable soil, covered with use-
less timber, and in this critical stage of his career he gets no help either
from the authorities or from the people among whom he comes. The
Government leaves him, ignorant of the laws and of the country, to act
at his own risk, and the interest of his neighbours in his doings is
measured by the quantity of money he may have in his pocket, and their
hope of his spending it among them.
When he decides upon a site for his farm, he is only at the beginning
of his troubles, for it takes months before official requirements are satisfied,
boundaries fixed, and all preliminary questions settled. It may be that
long after he has set to work he gets notice that he has settled in the
middle of a public reserve, or that his ? description seems to apply to a
portion of a pre-emptive purchase, of which the boundary is in doubt,? for
all surveys are enveloped in a haze.
So he will have to move after losing his labour, and his stock of cash
will be seriously reduced before he can get his family housed. Let him
at length be_ fairly settled, and he will be lucky if he does not find his
farm the centre of conflicting claims, and himself, contrary to his will, a
party in a chronic warfare, of which unintelligible grazing questions are
usually the occasion, with impoundings and threatened actions for trespass
forming the overt features. Worried with daily interruptions of this
kind, he will be able to give little attention to his work ; instead of living
from his own produce, he will buy his supplies from the nearest store,
while his money lasts, and, moreover, he will often contract an unenviable
acquaintance with law and lawyers.
The land laws are badly constructed, while their administration is
stupidly defective, and the central Government is the only source from
which any redress can be got. He will get to know soon, how far he is
from head-quarters, and how difficult it may be for a stranger to gain the
ear of authority, although under popular institutions.
Let him, by good luck, escape these shoals and quicksands, and he
will yet find how hard it is to realise the prospect which brought him to
the Antipodes, Single-handed, he will have to build his hut or cottage,
fence in a field for cultivation, and plough it up, and, unless he gets a
well-watered piece of land, he must sink a well or make a dam without
delay. If he does not get a selection within ten or twenty miles of a
market, or a railway, or steamboat wharf, he will not be able to sell the
crop which now and then he may be able to grow. Pretty often he will


have either a had market or a had crop, for the seasons are so uncertain
that either droughts or floods are at any time likely to occur. His live
stock will, in the end, he his mainstay, and he dare not increase their
number much, because a scramble for the grass always goes on beyond
the limits of the purchased land. To eke out a living, he will have to
try the diggings or look out for jobs of contract work, such as carrying and
road-making. So, instead of owning a cultivated and productive farm, he
will only be the possessor of a half-waste homestead, and will have to
scramble for a living, as many farmers or selectors in Australia do. This
would be the fate of farming immigrants in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred. If he had a thousand pounds, or even more money, the same
result would happen, as the cost of hiring labour would be far beyond the
value of anything he could raise, except in favoured spots.
The opening for immigrants in country pursuits is otherwise narrowed
by the results which have generally followed the investment of capital on
a larger scale. Experience has shown that settlers with money have
very little chance of success, from the very unsound condition of business
matters universal in Australia. A few may at times rise on the tide of
speculation, but those who follow them generally pay for their predeces-
sor?s good luck. Indeed, monied men are likely to leave these colonies
alone for the present, and it is better that they should do so, till they
make up their minds to keep clear of that chaos of confusion, debt, and occa-
sional sham prosperity, which is called the squatting interest. At the
same time it cannot be questioned that, under different conditions, grazing
might be a pleasant and profitable occupation for a man with a few
thousand pounds, but this cannot be the case while the present system is
maintained of working huge cumbrous concerns with borrowed money.
When a freehold grazing law is passed, and when stock mortgages and
squatting leases are abolished, then a new-comer will be able with some
safety to lay out his money in sheep and cattle; until then he will be
better to invest elsewhere. It has been the misfortune of Australia to
attempt working two conflicting land laws together, and the result for the
common welfare has been something like sitting down between two stools.
The squatter?s run is huge in extent, but he has no tenure. He has
to pay a rent which appears trifling for the area occupied, but it is in
reality heavy, because his right to the grass is exactly the same as that
of a gipsy on the roadside?that is, he can use it till he is told to move
off. Consequently his work is done in the worst way, with great cost,
and to very little purpose. His chances of profit hinge chiefly on sudden
spurts of speculation, and this gives him a true gambling bias, urging him
to go in heavy.
No wonder that he drifts into financial difficulties, and the money-
lender becomes his chief friend and confidant.
The selector?s difficulties are of a different kind, but they send him
somewhat in the same direction, and, moreover, the constant collisions
between the two classes of settlers cramp and injure both seriously.
Early prejudices and misapprehension of the common welfare have
aggravated this state of things, although people now begin to see that a
uniform law of freehold settlement would have been much better; but as
it is, the chief industries of the country are kept in fixed grooves, which


allow little scope either for individual progress, or for the absorption of a
new population. This stupid and cumbrous system has given a peculiar
character to the settlers. One of the worst features to be seen is the
class antagonism which is diffused over every corner of the country, in
place of public spirit and regard for the common good.
In the allotment of the land, almost every spot is the scene of a con-
test, in which the most violent hostility is displayed, and perjury and
artifice are unscrupulously used by both sides. This, of itself, prevents
the growth of any habit of combination for mutual advantage. On the
other hand, leagues and conspiracies for class ends prevail widely. The
isolation and helplessness of the individual settler are greatly increased by
the centralised action of the Government, which professes to direct a mul-
titude of matters, while the principal result is simply that in attempting
to go beyond the commonest concerns of daily life one is fet-
tered, and the settlers can neither help themselves nor benefit by joint
exertion. These causes, combined with the money difficulties which ham-
per so many, produce a character which marks nearly all?namely, isola-
tion, narrowness of views, and an utter want of resource. Their work is
done at heavy cost, because each man does solely for himself what might
be done much better and cheaper by combined effort. The squatter is
too much taken up with his mortgagee to think of anything else; the
selector can see no way of getting on but by pursuing his encroachments
on the squatter; and no one thinks of any general improvement except
such as must be carried out for him by the Government, or the Bank.
In one shape there is always a substantial progress, and the good re-
sults which attend this method offer a marked contrast to the doings of
settlers generally. It is when large families work together. This seems
to be the natural form of colonising, and it goes on irrespective of all
land laws, and keeps greatly free from the clogs which obstruct indivi-
dual attempts. Everywhere, from the southern boundary of Victoria to
the centre of Queensland, are such families to be seen thriving and con-
tented. They often begin on a small farm with a few head of cattle,
and work their way to the possession of a station and a herd. By work-
ing together, they keep clear of hired labour and borrowed money, while
their comforts grow around them and their stock increases. They do
little towards building villas for the commercial magnates of Sydney and
Melbourne; but they rarely fail to secure independence for themselves
and provision for those who come after them. The contrast which their
success offers is so marked, that one is led to question the advantages of
the usual plan of ? every man for himselfand in looking into what may
be called the undeveloped capabilities of the country, this misgiving is
much increased. There is good reason to believe, from facts which have
come to light, that works which would immensely increase the resources
of the colonies are waiting only for an appropriate organisation of labour,
but that such works are beyond the ability of the individual settler,
while they would not pay the capitalist who has to calculate interest and
pay wages. One or two of these facts are worth referring to.
Chinese are now settled all over these colonies, and in most places
the trade of market-gardening has fallen entirely into their hands.
Being generally aliens, few of them buy land, but though mere so-


journers, they are the only people in Australia who make the land yield
certain crops by systematic cultivation. Go to any gold-field, the
vegetables are grown by the Chinamen; to any bush village, you will
find the same thing; and in many a grazing district where you will meet
strings of European loafers, begging and sorning under the pretence of
seeking work, there by the road-side you will pass little groups of Chinese
cultivating old folding-grounds, with their little huts on the bank of a
lagoon, and their water-wheel throwing the gushing stream through the
tienches which intersect acres of turnips, onions, cabbage, and pumpkin.
These men live comfortably, lead inoffensive lives, and often save a little
money to take back to China. In all seasons they can raise their crops,
and when they fail to get a market they can at least live well and cheaply ?
while the European cultivators are entirely dependent on the chances of
the seasons, and cannot work their way without help from the storekeeper.
What then, it may be asked, is the secret of the Chinaman?s success ?
Clearly it consists in the habit or instinct of co-operation native in his
race, which enables him to apply with advantage a system of culture well
suited to this country.
Irrigation has been written about and recommended in Australia since
the first days of settlement. The examples of Spain, India, Egypt, and
Lombardy, have been pointed to, but the suggestions of travellers and
the reasonings of the book-learned have fallen barren to the ground before
the helpless isolation and the prejudices of the settlers. No doubt the
fact of the influential classes being mainly occupied with speculations con-
nected with squatting or commerce has partly accounted for the neglect
of irrigation and other permanent works. Probably their example might
have extended such an innovation, and might have led to combinations for
the purpose of providing water supply, but as few of them ever intended
to remain in the country for good such undertakings were the last things
they thought of. As it is, though there are hundreds of Chinese cultiva-
tion grounds in all directions being worked daily, the valuable teach-
ing of the Asiatics is offered fruitlessly to European landholders, and the
subject of irrigation as connected with farming is never mentioned, though
there is no practical difficulty in the matter, and no doubt whatever of the
certain benefit, to be derived. The average rainfall is greater than in
England, and in most parts of the country water could be periodically
Whether the helpless isolation of the settlers or their dogged
prejudice has most to do with this disregard of an obvious source of
wealth, one thing is certain?namely, that with combination and the
right men for the work, crops of all kinds might be grown abundantly in
all seasons and in nearly every part of Australia.
Such, then, are the undeveloped capabilities of tillage.
Grazing, the other great branch of agriculture, has advanced but little
beyond the roughest and most primitive state. It is only of late years
that the improvement of the natural pastures has been attempted, but the
results shown make it clear that if they were occupied under a better
tenure and by a settled population, a new condition of things would arise,
causing changes not less important than those produced by the gold dis-
covery. Very little advance has as yet been possible, owing to the peculi-
arity of Australian land legislation, which, in the face of notorious facts,


persists in treating grazing as a merely transitory industry. The Crown
lands are all professedly reserved for the plough, though experience shows
that a very small proportion of what is purchased is ever under crop.
Whatever the Australian selector may profess to be?whether called
selector, farmer, or agriculturist?he is nearly always more a grazier
than anything else. The grass is the resource most readily available;
growing everywhere and almost all the year round, it would be strange if
it were not universally used. Nevertheless legislation takes no note of
this invariable tendency, but assumes that the man who buys land must
be a cultivator, pure and simple, while the grazing of the unsold land is
administered in such a way as to breed endless dissension. Hence the
grass-scramble and the bad blood, and hence also the fact that most of the
occupied country remains almost unimproved. In certain districts the
squatters have gone to expense in erecting fences and saving water, but
they have often lost the benefit of these improvements through the
encroachments of the selectors, and it has only been in the older settled
country, where the land was distributed in freehold grants, that the latent
capabilities of the grazing lands have been brought to light. It is
reckoned that the fencing of a run in moderate-sized enclosures will
alone double its natural power of carrying stock. This arises from the
sheep or cattle being more regularly distributed over the surface, and their
feeding down the grass more evenly. The herbage grows closer, and
something like a sward begins to form in place of the scattered tufts of
bush grass.
The second step in improvement has been the thinning or destroying
of timber and the planting of artificial grasses. The result of this, so far
as it has gone, has startled many of the Australians, though it did not
surprise those much who had seen the reclamation of moors and sand-flats
in other parts of the world. These innovations are at present necessarily
kept within a narrow compass, but enough has been done to show that all
pasture may be immensely improved, and that the most worthless soil
may be made to grow good grass. In connection with the subject of
combination, one feature in this is worth noting grass-tillage can be
best carried out by men whose time and labour cost nothing, for it
appears to owe its greatest development to the daily care of the owner,
and the fostering hand of time, and cannot be forced with like results by
the expensive operations of capital.
These, then, are two of the dormant resources of the Australian
colonies, now almost untapped, but certain to develop the means of giving
comfort and wealth to millions of people when the right organisation and
the right men are found for the work, and when the local Legislations
make the occupation of their lands easier and more secure. Co-operation
by self-supporting communities offers a plain solution to one part of the
problem, but the questions as to where the right men are to be found, and
whether the colonists are likely to improve their land-tenure in the direc-
tion wanted, are by no means easily answered.
It must be admitted that hitherto our countrymen have shown no
aptitude for such undertakings. Hardly in any grade of the colonial
population would people be found willing to cast in their lot with such
communities. The men who have been the pioneers of the grazing


country are now, to the number of many hundreds, penniless ? and they
are well fitted to succeed in such attempts, having failed, not from want
of practical knowledge or energy, but simply as the victims of a high-
pressure system of credit. Still, an immense majority of them, in spite
of the lesson they have got, are so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of
commercialism that they would rather cling to the skirts of some squat-
ting jobber, and starve on his leavings, than by their clubbed exertions
and the work of their own hands make a fight for independence. Capital
is the god they have been taught to worship. They know nothing of
co-operation.
As to the common class of emigrants, among them there is observable
a want of self-helpfulness. Whether it arises from excessive subdivision
of labour in the old country, from the poor-law, or from being brought to
the colonies as passively as bales of goods, an ordinary emigrant has little
idea of walking by himself; but he must have something like a master
to lean upon, and the principal independence he shows is his aversion to
do any work except that which he has been bred to.
Such are clearly not the people for co-operative settlement. With
them work would become mere skulking, and they would be held together
only while they could sponge on the common means. With all British
and colonial labourers, too, there would be great difficulty in inducing
them voluntarily to engage in such outlandish work as irrigation; and
this would be aggravated by what would appear to them as the degrada-
tion of learning a wrinkle from Chinamen. Many of the Bush population,
the naturalised immigrants, think no shame to practise the degrading
trade of a loafer or beggar, but they would scorn, in their dirty pride as
? white men,? to learn a lesson in industry and respectability from the
Asiatics.
The Mongols? education must have been different from that of the
Christians. No Board of Guardians or Emigration Commissioners
assisted or fettered his movements. When he left the Flowery Land he
had but one article of faith to guide him. It was the primeval law
? Work or starve.? From what we see in Australia it seems by much
tlm most effective education, as it produces self-reliant men, able to make
their living where our highly-endowed Caucasians cannot.
Still, to question that men will be found to carry through these and
kindred undertakings would be to doubt the most marked tendencies of
the age ; and when once their practicability is fairly proved, it is certain
that they will be widely adopted, while the system is of itself likely to
influence beneficially the character of the members. The other question
as to the probability of any of the colonial Legislatures modifying their
land laws to encourage this form of settlement, raises many difficulties.
The point may here with propriety be raised ?For what purpose was the
Crown title of the waste lands handed over to the Colonies by the Im-
perial Government 1 Were the lands to be held in trust for the purposes
of colonisation 1 or were they handed over merely as assets to be managed
for the profit of the one million of people then in Australia 1 Every
candid mind must admit the first supposition to be the only just one, but
this is a view of the matter by no means approved by the colonists ; and
the different Governments have invariably acted as if the main purpose


for which the lands were held was to raise money to he spent among their
constituents. Only one member of a Colonial Assembly has, to the
writer?s knowledge, maintained the contrary principle consistently. He
who held this honourable position was the Rev. Dr. Lang of Sydney.
The fair ground for a colonial government to take, in dealing with a
co-operative scheme of settlement, would be something like the following.
Let us suppose that the ministry of Sydney or Melbourne, in reply to such
a proposal, says ?
? \V e acknowledge your right to land at cost price on certain condi-
tions, namely,?
? 1. That you prove to our satisfaction that your scheme is practicable,
and that you have the means to carry it out.
?2. That you find security, at the rate of <�2o per head, that each per-
son introduced by you shall fulfil his compact with your association, so
that, in case of breach of the same by desertion, the burden of his support
may not be thrown upon the colonists.
? 3. That at your own cost you place your community on the ground
to be shown you.
? 4. That within two years you enclose the land allotted to you with
a substantial fence.
? If you agree to these conditions, you can have a tract of land con-
taining an area estimated at the rate of 320 acres for each family or man
over twenty-one years. The price will be the actual cost of survey and
official management, with the addition of a sum towards payment of the
cost of railways, roads, or other public works, by which you may benefit;
and, for your convenience, we are willing to extend the payment over
five years.
? The price being paid up, and all conditions fulfilled, we shall give
you a grant of the land.
? Your corporation shall be legalised by an act of our legislature, and
we shall further provide by law that such of your members as may break
their engagement shall be liable to arrest, and their securities shall be
forfeited. The money so obtained shall be applied in re-shipping them
to the places whence they came.?
This would be quite just and reasonable. The land would be devoted
to its proper purpose, while it would only be a proper precaution to re-
quire security that the people brought out did not become a burden to
the colonists.
The condition as to fencing the land would be very desirable, to
prevent collisions between the association and the settlers. But it must
be admitted that there is little probability of any colonial government
acting in this spirit. Individual members might wish to befriend such
schemes, but the pressure which the constituencies would exert would
be all against them.
To the employing class, the idea conjured up by an extensive immi-
gration is abundant labour and low wages, while to the townspeople
it usually presents a seductive image of plenty of jobs, lots of public
money kicking about, full public-houses, trade lively, and wealthy Eng-
lish associations spending their money by the advice of Sydney and Mel-
bourne agents. Who would care for an immigration that comprised


none of these advantages 1 and what electors would ever consent to give
their land for nothing to people who did nothing for the good of trade 1
To a certainty, this would be the light in which the ordinary Australian
politician would view such a proposal, if made now; but new ideas in
these times are quickly evolved, and there is no saying what the feeling
might be twelve months hence.
It is possible that such undertakings might get into favour in some
quarters, if it could be shown that they might result in substantial settle-
ments being formed, especially if a law were passed, which favoured like
enterprises among the colonists themselves; hut it would be difficult to
reconcile the commercial people of the towns to the idea, as the very
essence of this kind of settlement, and its only chance of would
consist in its being absolutely self-supporting, and consequently, its total
avoidance of all commercial dealings. With a transferable title of their
holdings, the business world would look favourably enough on these
combinations; but the sine qud non of their existence is just this, ?there
must be no possibility of transferring the title. The holders of squatting
leases would also raise a powerful opposition to any new infringement on
their runs. As to the grazing population, the interests of a majority of
them are by no means identical with those of the registered owners of
stations ; indeed, who knows but in time even squatting men may get to
see that it is better to have a fifth or a tenth share in a co-operative free-
hold, than the whole of a mortgaged squattage, of which the profits,
when any, are absorbed in interest and renewals.
These reflections are however premature, and it may be impolitic to
anticipate difficulties which may not be realised in practice. It may be
more fitting, in concluding the present remarks, to submit a few crude
suggestions to those who may feel interested in the idea of co-operative
settlement in Australia.
A community to settle in the interior must be strong in number, if it
is to be self-supporting; and it must comprehend in its arrangements
every possible provision for the comfort and enjoyment of its members, so
that they may keep together voluntarily, and work in accord. It is not
absolutely necessary that each member should be an expert in some branch
of industry ; but it is important that there should be a few skilled men,
and that the rudiments of all trades should be acquired as generally as
possible. The equipment should include, besides ordinary farming and
bush carpentering implements, a complete blacksmith?s forge, boring
plant for water and minerals, and the iron-work for horse-mills, both for
grain and sawing. In addition, there should be money enough to supply
twelve months? rations for all hands, and to buy such articles as the
association would be unable to manufacture at first. As to luxuries, such
as liquor, groceries, tobacco, and so on, they must simply be dispensed
with, until they can be raised or procured by the sale of surplus produce.
That the want of these comforts is possible, and moreover quite consistent
with good health and ability to work, any one who has roughed it in the
colonies knows well. Instances are frequent of men living and working
hard on nothing but bad meat, and sometimes on nothing but dry corn, or
meal and water. If it is worth while to make a fight for ultimate inde-
pendence and comfort, then such little privations should count for nothing ;


besides, it is quite certain that in whatever way men are employed in the
? Bush,? whether under co-operation or not, all are at times liable to be
put on?low diet. The compensation will come when full barns, dairies,
and orchards, have been raised and planted by the hundred-handed and
hundred-headed machine going in well-oiled trim.
Thirty-two thousand acres, or fifty square miles, of ordinary bush
country, would be an extent which one hundred families could manage
with advantage under a system combining arable farming by irrigation
with grass tillage. This area would likely comprehend the diversity of
character required for a variety of purposes. There would be grass at once
for the cattle of the association, and timber for building and fencing.
There would be a certain extent of broken country which would likely
contain water, while the richer level country might require to be supplied
with water by artificial means. There w r ould be alluvial flats on the
watercourses conveniently placed for irrigation, and the lower slopes of
the hills would serve for the growth of the vine and other fruit trees;
while the more sterile ranges, cleared and planted with grass, would sup-
port small flocks of sheep, or of the Angora goat, which is already a
recognised addition to the colonial live-stock.
Thus a great variety of pursuits might be carried on, and the members
could supply within their own bounds the necessaries and many of the
luxuries of life. That they could go much beyond this after their first
struggle was over, there is little doubt, because, living on their own
resources, and with the full command of their time and labour, they
could carry out plans of a nature and magnitude equally beyond the reach
of individual settlers and of capitalists, who have to realise interest and
pay wages.
The expense of transporting from Europe and planting such a com-
munity of one hundred families would be from <�lso to �2OO each. This
would put them on the ground with a year?s supply of provisions, a pro-
per equipment of implements, and a herd of 1500 head of cattle.
To try to do without the cattle, or with a much smaller number,
would blight any European community at the outset. This would be the
source to which the members would need mainly to look, both for their
present living and for the recovery of their outlay; and grass culture
must occupy a great part of their attention. Their irrigated meadows, their
stack-yards, and their fields of ryegrass and lucerne, will then carry them
through seasons triumphantly, when the country is burned up and the
squatter?s stock is starving.
These suggestions are no doubt imperfect, but they offer the key which
may, in the right hands, open up the resources of Australia, not only to
numbers of landless Europeans, but to many of the colonists who are now
working to little purpose ; for the principle of co-operation is sufficiently
elastic to suit all forms of settlement.


NEW SOUTH WALES IN 1872.
The last few months have seen an end of the depression of 1870 and
1871, and 1872 has been heralded with an unexpected burst of pros-
perity. Sydney had already nearly retrieved her temporary loss in
northern squattages, because three-fourths of the earnings of New South
Wales and Queensland were being poured into her banks ; when wool
rose suddenly to a higher price than it had reached for many seasons, and
about the same time some rich gold reefs were discovered at Tambaroora.
Then a mining mania began, and in a few weeks over three hundred new
companies were inaugurated, largely supported by capitalists, but it is
said that only very small sums of real money are represented by the
imposing rows of figures presented in the prospectuses. The explanation
of this enigma is that when a man of weight in the money market wants
shares he gets them for nothing, and is thus paid a premium for the use
of his name. The real capital invested, therefore, often consists merely
of the payments made by the general public, who have been lured by the
advertisement of these well-known men of mark, as shareholders and
directors. Whether this is a sound principle in dealing is doubtful, but
it is largely approved and adopted by the leaders of commerce in Sydney,
The actual discoveries of gold, copper, tin, and silver, which have fol-
lowed the mining excitement, have, however, been undoubtedly great, and
it is not at all unlikely that some of these schemes, though floated in so
peculiar a fashion, may actually result in profit, but still all experience
tells that there must shortly be a dead-lock from the impossibility of
working one-third of those projected within reasonable time. Meantime,
the contagion of speculation has extended to the stock and station
market, and stations, which in former times have ruined successive pur-
chasers, are now being sold at higher prices than such properties have
commanded for five or six years.
Looking at this by the light of the past, it may be fairly assumed
that these bargains can result in one way only?namely, that the pur-
chasers will sacrifice their money, and that the stations will shortly again
be in the same hands ready for re-sale; that is, unless a further rise in
prices should save these buyers by enabling them to place the inevitable
eventual loss on the shoulders of their successors.
But the disasters of the past years are now entirely forgotten, and the
tide of recklessness setting in reminds one of 1863 and 1864.
Still, in looking at the colony, some facts are prominent which must
arrest the attention of a disinterested speculator.
One of these is the undue growth of the towns, as contrasted with
the unsteady and slow progress of settlement in the country. A late
census shows that more than one-fourth of the people of New South
Wales live in the town of Sydney, while another large proportion inhabit
the second-rate towns. Taking into account the country townships and
the mining districts, it would be safe to say that not one-third of the


population is supported by rural pursuits. Another symptom of the
times is a fact which has come to light incidentally, from a late discus-
sion on a proposed land bill, and also from a dispute existing between
the wool-shippers and the London brokers. This is that the squatters as
an order, or, as people say, the breed of squatters, has nearly disap-
peared. The real squatters are now the banks and merchants, and the
only independent class of landholders are the proprietors of the old free-
hold grants in the first settled districts. It is also widely remarked that
the new farming class, the selectors, are being quite as quickly absorbed
by the banks through the country storekeepers. What, then, candidly,
must be the prospect of a young country, where the occupants of the soil,
small and great, are eaten up by money-lending establishments, and where
the towns contain two-thirds of the entire population ] Production is
great no doubt, commerce is enormous, and money for the time is plen-
tiful ' but the prosperity generated is of the kind which will build streets
of taverns and stockjobbers? offices j and will leave a vagabond spawn
behind it of the sort which will neither consent to work nor to want.
The unwholesome development of commercialism is undoubtedly the
curse of Australia. The men who ought to be growing potatoes and
shearing their sheep with their own hands spend all their time in a
muddle of bills and accounts. The country storekeeper is again in the
hands of the Sydney merchant, and the merchant in the hands of a bank.
The financial pyramid is unsound at the base, and the unfortunates who
form the apex may at any time be obliterated with a little red ink. All
are reckless, for most have never been clear of such involvements, and the
vice of the system is aggravated by the fatal laxity of the insolvency law.
All is in favour of the man without principle, who readily undertakes
engagements which he can throw lightly off.
If liabilities were made by law permanently binding, then the honest
man would have as good a chance as the rogue, which he has not
now; and then many huge conglomerations of chicanery, which burden
the colonies like nightmares, would crumble into powder; further yet,
if the colonists would consent to abrogate those laws which sanction the
mortgage of live stock and the transfer of grazing rights, then the ground
would be cleared of weeds which now choke the growth of rural industry
and wholesome homestead settlement.
10 th August 1872.
