BUCCANEER Bibb
CHAPTER I —THE OLD TOWER.
'Tp ICKLE whistled ft ve times
under the window of
Dare Harper, expecting to hear
Dare’s voice sleepily telling
him that he’d be out in a min-
ute, and then see Dare, hastily
clothed, throw open the win-
dow and leap to the ground
beside him. Dare always pre-
ferred to come through a win-
dow, rather than a door.
Tickle began to feel
anxious. It was very early; the
night mists were still unpene-
trated by the light of the ap-
proaching day. Perhaps Dare
was sleeping heavily after the
previous night s adventure.
Only the excitement that was
gripping all the boyhood of
Corangi had got 1 ickle himself
up at that early hour; as he
came to waken Dare, he had
seen the candle-light in
Simmo’s window which told
that he. too, was an early riser;


and darker shadows moving
through the mists with an oc-
casional lowing, had told hi
that Stinker Morgan was up
also, herding the cows m early
so that he could get away to
meet the boys. That would e
the way, everywhere; all the
boys would be restless to know
how Dare and Pip Had fared
in their last night s adventure.
He tried another whistle, a
little louder. A light <Budden-
• ly sprang into being behind _
window that was not Dare s.
Tickle was appalled; he had
not meant to waken the house-
hold. The light *»appeared
and reappeared behind Uare s
window. Shortly that went
up; but it was not the boy, but
a woman, who appeared m the
Arthur ? He'snot
been home all night. f His bed
has not been slept m, declar-
Ed the woman.
"I came looking for him,
Mrs. Tarrant,” said Tickle, a
deep fear in his heart. Are
you sure he isn’t at home?
“I’ve got eyes, haven t 1 -
snapped Mrs. Tarrant. She
looked at him sharply. What
are you doing up at this time .
There’s some mischief on.
What has Arthur been
doing?” ,
Tickle was backing towards
the gate; he did not want to


let Dare into trouble by say-
ing too much —or anything.
“I’ll find him for you, Mrs.
Tarrant.” As, having reached
it, he shot through the gate he
heard Mrs. Tarrant . say,
‘There’ll be a fine row if he’s
not here to do his job when
Old Joe gets up.’
He nearly ran into Horsey
Carter as he turned a corner.
Horsey was pale-faced and full
of excitement.
“Pip h asn’t come home,” he
panted. “Not been home all
night. Where’s Dare?”
“He hasn’t been home all
night, either, said 1 ickle,
really appalled. “The house-
keeper told me, 1 woke her up,
whistling for Dare. But I didn’t
tell her about Dare.’
”1 told Mr. and Mrs. Vin-
din. They're worried,” said
Horsey. “Mr. Vindin has gone
to see Sergeant Jinks about it.
What’s happened to them?’
“It looks as though the Old
Tower has claimed another
victim, said fickle, who fre-
quently thought in melodrama.
“Two more victims,” he cor-
rected.
Strictly speaking, it was not
right to say that the Old 1 ower
had a habit of claiming vic-
tims. Certainly the last man
who had lived there, an old
“hatter,” who had found it
vacant and moved in, had been


found dead; but that was Tickle had asserted one night
after he had lived there for when the boys were discussing
years. Since his death nobody
had gone near the place. No-
body could say who had built
it or why; there were legends,
and tales had grown up about
it. The sinister-looking, grey
building stood starkly amongst
the low wind-blown bush on
the bouldery headland, and
was the district’s mystery. It
was said that the sheep who
sometimes wandered onto the
headland for such herbage as
might be found amongst the
rocks, came back helter skelter
at nightfall, to get away from
the eerie place.
“Haunted, that s what it is,
a rumour that lights had been
seen flickering about the Old
1 ower.
The Old Tower was like a
challenge to a boy like Arthur
Grayson, who has earned his
nickname of * Dare, before he
had been two days in Corangi.
That was over a little matter
of riding a wild colt in Raw-
son s paddock, the additional
challenge being that Rawson
was likely to get wild himself
if he caught any beys interfer-
ing with his livestock. Nobody
had expected that the boy from
the city could even mount the
colt, but he had, and had stuck


on, 100, bareback, tor time
long enough to justify the claim
of riding, before the colt had
got rid of him.
“It isn t safe to dare Dare
to do anything. He 11 do it,
said the admiring Fickle, to
anyone who spoke about the
boy. That deputation earned
Dare a leadership that would
have not come normally to a
boy who had arrived as a State
child. There was nothing dis-
graceful about Dare s coming.
His parents had been well-to-
do, and Dare had had a happy
childhood, until they both died
in an accident, leaving nothing
behind them but Dare. The
State had taken charge for
there were no relatives.
Old Joe, who had un-
dertaken the charge of the boy
was not a philanthropist; neith-
er was Mrs. Tarrant, his
housekeeper. They expected
work from Dare, when his
school work was done; but he
was a bundle of energy and
always appeared to have some
left over for boyish enterprises.
Tin going to have a look at
that old tower,” he announced.
“Sat’d’y afternoon’d be a
good time,’ said Pip.
“Sat’d’y afternoon nothing!
There’s the match,” said Dare.
“We 11 go over on Sunday,
suggested Horsey George
Graham Carter, and “Horsey*


because of the G.G. It dbe
good sport to take our
lunches.’
“And miss Sunday dinner,
said Pip. “Not me. We’re
having goose and apple pie,
Sunday.”
“No, I’m going at night,’
said Dare decisively. “If they
say it s haunted, there s no
sense in going during the day.
There's no hauntings in the
day-time. Thursday night,
when there’s no homework
that’s when I’m going.’’
“I’ve got a torch,” said
Tickle.
“No good to me, said
Simmonds. There might be
snakes. We might tread on
them in the darkness. Maybe
it was snakes that killed all
the people who died there.
Pip his family name was
Appel —hooted derisively. He
was glad of the opportunity to
keep pace with Dare without
the prospect of missing his
Sunday dinner.
“What people who died
there ? Who do you know
who died?” he demanded,
sceptically. I m going.
“Me, too,” said Stinker, who
the boys said always smelt of
the cows in whose handling he
had to take his share. “It’ll be
good fun and we ll show every-
body that there’s no ghosts in
the old tower.”


Perhaps we won't show
” said Dare. “We'll
keep it a secret and make a
regular camp of it.”
That future prospect whip-
ped up the excitement of the
adventure, which bubbled all
the more because the boys
kept it to themselves, in fear
that their parents might object.
The parents became merely
dimly aware of something in
the wind. Imposed tasks were
done with alacrity, sometimes
before they were imposed. The
boys were clearing the decks
for Thursday night’s action.
But, although there was a
muster at the appointed meet-
ing place, there were not many
who went forward.
What’s the idea of the
meat-chopper?” asked Simmo,
pointing to the weapon Dare
carried in his belt.
Must have something.
Might be snakes or any-
thing,” said Dare. “It was the
only thing 1 could find, so I
brought it along.”
I’ve got a tomahawk,” said
Pip.
*1 wish I’d brought some-
thing, too,” said Stinker. “But
won t be able to go along.
My old man told me I had to
be bed at half-past-nine.
There’s the cows in the morn-

when he felt scared.
"You youngsters don t thmK
you’re coming, do you? rip
demanded. "We don t want
the infants' school with us
In case anything happens.
"Oh, gee! Dare, we can
come, can’t we?” several of
the younger boys asked.
"No fear, you can t, retort-
ed Dare. "You kids can come
another time. You 11 have to
get back after you ve seen us go
ITI Perhaps that decision of
Dare’s had an effect which m-
i .Up cense or eermess
creased the sense u
that came to the boys as they
made their way on the sandy
track through the moon-flood-
ed scrub. They found them-
selves talking in whispers. Ihe
crack or the wriggle of a stick
underfoot was disconcerting.
A ridge gave a view ot the
tower —grey, menacing, wi
a quality of derisive challenge.
The night had become cold;
that might have accounted tor
some of the shivers.
"Gee, it looks a long way.
said Pedlar. “I’m tired already.
Fancy walking all that way
and then all the way home
again! There’s school m the
morning. . . n c . _
“Better leave it till
day. Dare.” said Tickle.
“We’ll be able to see better m


the daytime.
Pip was glad to get in before
Dare.
“Whatever you blokes are
going to do, Dare and I are
going to have a look-see at
that place. Better give me that
torch, I ickle.’’
I’m coming.*
T've got to be home by
eleven, Mother said. We’ll
never do it in time,’’ objected
Simmo.
And then 1 ickle d iscovered
that he had hurt his an kle. He
limped back, after accompany-
ing Dare and Pip a few yards,
and handing over his torch.
! he boys found the cold in-
creasing. Pip vanished into the
scrub.
‘Dare said that we had bet-
ter not wait, said Simmo. “He
said they’d stay down and
camp in the place a-while and
look through it thoroughly.
I’ve got to get home.’
Id better see about my
ankle, said Tickle. “Dare and
Pip’ll tell us all about it in
the morning.’
But Dare and Pip had not
returned. 1 he excitement in
the little community was not
only among the boys, as a
small party, with the two
policemen, set out for the Old
lower; there were boys in the
procession, who decided that

CHAPTER 11—THE BOAT ON THE BEACH.
ttOWFVFR Pip and Dare prise, they had first applauded
H might laugh together at so enthusiastically, it was n
might laug g Tickle without secret misgivings; that
the wav Simmons and sinister-
had withdrawn from the enter- they approached the


looking tower. There was a
shock to both of them when,
breaking away from the track
to make a direct line to the
the tower, they found them-
selves, pausing only just in
time, on the brink of a small
cliff with a fall of some con-
siderable distance to rocks be-
low. Thereafter the}' found
the track again and followed
it; it seemed to bend round as
if it, too, shunned the tower;
but it veered again after going
some distance, as if to reach
the tower on its other side.
‘Where does that track
go?” asked Dare as they
came to a branch.
‘DoWn to the beach at Jen-
ki ns’ Bay, probably,” said Pip.
‘lt’s not much of a beach and
it’s hard to get at. I say, it’s
going to take us a good time
to get to' the tower, have a
good look round and then get
home. Early morning before
we do get home, I reckon.”
“Not funking?” mocked
Dare.
“Funking!” Pip was about
ta give a warm answer when
Dare’s grip on his sleeve
silenced him.
“Look!” he cried.
Two shadowy figures had
emerged from the door of the
Old Tower.
“They’re not ghosts,” Dare
whispered. “That explains the


lights; there are people using
the place. They’re coming this
way. We’d better get under .
* »
cover. , i •
“Why 3 ” But Pip also whis-
pered; “We’ve got as much
right to be here as they have
Dare, however, had plunged
into the bush and Pip follow-
ed him. They stayed there urn
til the two men, who they cou
not see clearly, had passed,
talking earnestly.
‘‘Come on, whispered
Dare “We’ll see what they ve
been’up to, if they’ve been up
1 6 anything.
“There might be others m
the Tower still,’ objected Pip-
“ Some hoboes may have de-
cided to camp there
•‘There’s no light m the
place,” retorted Dare.
They were soon at tne
lower, a strange old place
with weeds growing out ot
some of the joins of the stones
and moss on many ot the
stones themselves. Dar SJ
hand went to the handle on the
heavy door. , ~
“It’s open, come on. saio
Pip followed at his heels,
entering before he fully rea-
lised that the beam of his torch
was unnecessary.
There was light in the room
they entered; coverings over
the window openings showed


why the light had not been
seen.
“Who are you ? What do
you want ? ”
The voice came surprisingly.
In a remote corner of the room
a ladder rose to the upper part
of the tower; underneath it a
trapdoor stood open, and half
emerged, was a man rising
from the lower depths.
“We re sorry,” said Dare,
quickly. “We didn’t know
there was anyone here.’
“So! Shut the door. ’ Ihe
man had now fully emerged.
Pip did it automatically, but
felt that he should put in his
verification.
“We just got an idea that
we'd like to have a look at this
place at night. People said it
was haunted, you know. If you
are using the place
“We had better go,’ said
Dare, We didn’t mean to dis-
turb you.”
“No; you stay,” said the
man, definitely menacing.
He strode to the door and
shot the bolt.
“ 1 here’s no reason why we
should,’’ said Pip. “We’ve
done no harm, and we’ve gol
to get home to our people.’
“Your people—so! Are you
boy skunks?’’
Ihe man was foreign. He
meant “scouts’ and his mistake
would have been amusing if


the whole adventure had not
got beyond the amusing stage.
"No. we’re not. But that
doesn’t have anything to do
with it. Come on, Dare.
His forward movement, was
checked, however, when he
saw that the man had a revol-
ver in his hand.
"You stay.” he repeated de-
finitely. ,
Dare and Pip retreated to-
gether as he advanced.
"But what’s the idea? You
can’t keep us here,” cried
Dare. , , , , .
The man’s left hand indi-
cated the trapdoor.
"You can stay down there
while I think what to do with
you, he said. ~
"You can’t keep us pro-
tested Pip- ‘Our people 11 be
looking for us. Besides.
what’ve we done? ~
"What you see, hem? de-
manded the man. 1 keep y ou,
Perhaps 1 kill you. You, e
said to Dare, “take that torch.
Go down below. ou will
find a padlock. Bring it to me.
Don’t stay. Don’t touch nod-
dings.” ,ii
Matters happened quickly.
I .eft by the door, Pip quickly
shot the bolt open and flung
the door wide. ,
“Come on. Dare! A dash lor
it!" he cried. '
The man wheeled, lilting his


revolver to fire; but Dare
moved quickly, too. I hat
meataxe came from his belt
and he hurled it aj, the revolver
hand. It hit flatly, sending the
revolver thudding to the floor.
Cursing, the man scrambled to
pick it up, but Dare leaped
upon him, kicking the weapon
towards Pip and continuing to
scuffle with his opponent.
“Pick it up, Pip!” he pant-
ed. “Hold him up.”
The man flung the boy from
him; he nearly fell through the
trapdoor opening where he
dropped. But Pip had the re-
volver now, and was presenting
it.
“Fire, Pip! Fire!” cried
Dare. Ihe maniac has another
revolver.’
“You get out, Dare,” cried
Pip. ‘‘l’ll shoot if he tries to
stop you.’
The man already had an-
other revolver in his hand. A
A bullet narrowly missed Dare
as he made for the door. Then
it was that Pip fired.
I he man crumpled, swayed
on his knees, and sprawled
over on his back.
The shuddering boys were
spellbound for a moment.
‘He’s dead,” said Dare.
I didn t mean to do it.
Even when 1 fired 1 only
meant to bluff him,” cried
Pip. “I’ve never used a revol


ver before. 1 couldn’t have hit
him if Td really tried to do

“1 pt’s v get out of here,
cried Dare. The place had be-
come a nightmare. Pip threw
down the revolver and ran
with him. They both wanted to
put as much distance as pos-
sible between them and the
place as quickly as they could.
They sat down panting on a
boulder at last. i
•‘We’re going the wrong
way." said Pip- "Wave eft the
track. This way won t take us

home.” said Dare. We ve
committed a murder; and
don’t fancy being hung.
“They don’t hang boys,
said Pip- “They don’t even
hang men, nowadays. Be ® l ° e !;
he attacked us, and we did it
in self defence.”
“They’ll try us, anyway,
said Dare. “In any case I’m not
going home. Not to Old Joe
and Mother Tarrant. I ve been

I’m too young to soldier, but l
might get on a boat as a sailor.
“1 tell you what. Pip, he
went on. struck by a thought.
“It’s different to you; you ve
<*ot people to care for you and
worry about what’s become ot
you. You go home. You could
say that it was 1 who did the


in self-defence, of
shooting
course.’
“Dare, I couldn’t do that,’’
said Pip. “Let’s both go home.
My people will stick to you,
too; and maybe it won’t be so
bad.’’
Dare had made up his mind,
however. The incident had
created the opportunity for the
breakaway of which he had
been dreaming for a long time.
Unaffectlonate and exacting as
they were, Old Joe and Mrs.
Tarrant had been just; they
had seen to it that he was well
clothed. Veil fed, well trained;
but they had nasty ways. He
could picture even if the
law exonerated him being
reminded, whenever in their
opinion he needed disciplining,
that he was a murderer.
“Let me take the blame,.
Pip. You go home,” he said.
“You’re a great cobber.
Dare,” said Pip. “But I’m going:
to stick with you. I’m scared
about going home, too.’
Then, in a strange way a
terror of being caught came to
them. It was Dare’s idea that
they should take off their boots
and climb down a watercourse
where a seepage from water
held amongst the rocks after
recent rains dribbled down to
the beach. They would leave
no tracks, Dare asserted. It was
precipitous, going down a cut


ting that the waters of time
had eaten in the cliff; and it
led them to the rocks at the
end of a beach. After putting
on their boots again they clam-
bered over the rocks and
dropped to the sand.
A big rock standing out by
itself, probably one that had
defied the erosion of tune had
hidden the view. They did not
see the boat that was drawn
up on * the beach until they
were already seen; and, obey-
ing orders sharply given,
several men came running to
them.
“What are you two mugs
doing here?” demanded one
of them. ‘You needn t tell me,
anyway. The skipper wants
♦ *
yon. • „
He was an unprepossessing
looking man. the skipper seen
in the darkness, now deep,
for clouds had come sweeping
across the moon.
“Where’s your nshing
lines?” he demanded. Vou ve
been fishing from the rocks,
have you ? ” „
“No, sir,” said Dare.
“We’ve just climbed down the
cliff-”'
“What have you seen i

this boat just now. We didn t
think any boats ever came to

didn’t wait for an answer.
‘What are you doing on this
beach at this hour?”
“We/’ began Pip
“I’ve run away from home.
said Dare, quickly interrupting
him. He felt that it was wisest
for Pip to say nothing about
the old tower adventure.
For the man who was seated
in the stern of the boat, appar-
ently waiting for it to be shov-
ed off, was certainly one of the
men they had seen leaving the
old tower!
“Where’s home ? Corangi ?
You’re out of your way, aren t
you? If you are running away,
you d go in the other direction,
towards the trains.
“No; that’s where the police
would look. They wouldn t
look towards the coast. And.
it’s only twenty miles to Port
Healy. There’ll be some
ships there.”
“It’s a job on a boat you
want, eh?’’ The words were
spoken rather grimly, ou re
only kids, but 1 dare say 1 can
find use for both of you.’
“Pip —my friend isn’t
coming,” said Dare, hastily.
“He just came to see me on
my way a bit.
Oh, he isn’t coming, eh
“I am. I’m going with Dare,’
said Pip. “But where’s the
ship?”


“She's out there," said the
captain, with a gesture into the
seaward mists. “We’ll find her
all right. Seeing you're new
chums, you’d better get in be-
fore we shove off. Get in.
“Hey, but my friend and 1
haven’t said we 11 go yet, said
Dare. “We want to talk it
over.
“There's no time. Make up
your minds now. Go on, get in.
Take places up forward.’*
Dare was about to protest
further, but a “Get in!’’ more
sharply repeated, was obeyed
by Pip , and Dare scrambled
into the boat after him.
In his mind was a nasty
thought that the captain in-
tended them to go with him
whether they agreed to go or
not; he resented his boat hav-
ing been seen by them and did
not intend to leave them be-
hind to talk about it.
Yet, in spite of misgivings
about something sinister in the
surroundings, both Dare and
Pip, experiencing It for the
first time, felt the exhilaration
of the glide of the boat over
the water, the rhythm of the
oars and the rowlocks, and the
lap of the waves against the
boat’s side. Soon the moon
by this time was completely
gone, and there was mist all
over the waters —a dark shape
loomed ahead. They guessed
/


it was the ship that was to be
their home.
Whatever happened about
the shooting in the old 1 ower
they were well away from it.
There was some relief in that
thought.
Dare and Pip whispered to-
gether and tried to engage the
oarsman with some enquiries.
“Stop that talking forward
there: I’ll talk to you lads to-
morrow,” said the captain
“Sarka. you keep your mouth
shut.” '
“Dey was ask-a-ing vat vas
de skipper’s name,” said the
oarsman. ~
“Tell them Buccaneer Bill,
said the captain.

captain. “I fight for nobody;

The look on his face, a
lined, pockmarked and scar-
red face that was indescribably
ugly and yet could be pleasant,
as it seemed when he told
Dare, who had been sick, to be
seated, indicated that anyone


who ran against his whi had a
black prospect.
Dare had a nightmarish
feeling that the talk was being
carried on from the few words
spoken in the boat; but those
were hours in between.
The boys had wakened with
surprise to find themselves in
bunks. Both had vaguely be-
lieved that sailors slept in
hammocks. How they had
climbed up the side of the
steamer was a curiously blur-
red memory; it had seemed an
immense height to climb up
the rope ladder as the ship
lurched and rolled, and the
waves below now and then
spat upward at them. 1 he exer-
tions and excitements of the
night, following on a full day,
with the Influence of the sea
air and the rocking motion of
the boat had filled them with
a drowsiness which sent them
to sleep directly they reached
their bunks, without any abid-
ing memory of how they got
there. Food was handed to
them; and Dare was sick; then
they slept again. Dare came
to a real consciousness to a
realisation of the movements of
the ship. It was pounding
through heavy seas; as it sank
into the trough of a wave his
heart rose in his throat with a
horrible fear that the ship was
going down, down, and would


not cease going down; and
then the buoyant upward rise
would come. Soon, though still
qualmish, he began to like the
motion, the slap ol the waves
against the side and the thud
of the big combers breaking
aboard. He turned in his
hunk unconsciously.
“Dare, are you all right
down there ? lip s voice said.
in the bunk above.
“I’m right.” said Dare. “But
Pip, we re in a bit ot a mess,
aren’t we ? .
A big sailor stood suddenly
by their bunks.
“You chaps keep your
traps closed, he said in a low
voice. “1 mean, be careful
what y(su say. Ihe skip ll get
to know every thing you talk
about. The crew’s a mixed
lot of scum; I’m English
meself, and me names ‘Ardy
—) Im. Watch yourselves
that’s all 1 say. It’s best to say
nothing at all.
Pip swung himself from his
bunk, and groggily found his
footing.
“Don’t we have to work
he asked. “We’ve slept a
long time.’
“You’ll work soon enough
—and ’ard,” said Hardy. “The
skipper s orders were loi >ou
to be let be. He doesn’t want
you on the deck. Me either.
He looked round cautiously.


“The swine is laying mines;
mines for the blasted Japs. He
doesn’t care what he does as
long as there s money in it.
“Mines for the Japanese!
But,” Dare began
A n urgently cautioning
motion by Hardy checked him.
A sailor had come into the
quarters, the water dripping
from an oilskin which he shed.
“Try some of these bis-
cuits,” said Hardy aloud and
ostentatiously. “They’ll help
settle your bellies.”
Pip had scrambled into his
clothes hanging beside his
bunk; Dare following his
example, although lying down,
he had become reconciled to
the ship’s movements, found
himself giddy and sick again
“Come out into the air; it’ll
make you feel better, said
Pip, taking his arm to steady
him.
“No, staya here,” said the
seaman, blocking their path.
“Captain Snaith, he say, you
stay here. He send for you,
after.”
“Why —” Pip began rebel-
liously.
“Best to obey orders on this
ship, youngster,” said Hardy,
quietly. “Not to, is dangerous,
sometimes.
They stayed. Dare, though
nearly dressed, rather thank-
fully, fell back in his bunk; he


felt better that way. 1 hough
both were unused to the sea, it
did not affect Pip at all, it
seemed. .
Coincidentally with the in-
rush of a number of the crew-
arrived hot food. Dare and
Pip found they had appetites.
The men. certainly a mixed lot,
took little notice of the boys,
though there was a rough en-
quiry here and there, as how
they were “shaking down to
it.” and advice to “cut m and
get what you want.” Most of
the men were busy shedding
oilskins hastily to take their
share in the food. Many of
them were morose, but a few
came in laughing.
“We broke open those
cases of machinery and we
threw the machinery over-
board,” laughed one. I hey 11
be fireworks in these waters.
The way he and the other
laughers looked towards Hardy,
it was a jibe intended for him.
Hardy saw it that way. too.
for he rose, a dark look on hrs
face. But he sat down again.
indeed, he had no need for
action, for the man next to the
jester who had come rn very
silently, turned on hrm with a
torrent of abuse. It may have
been English badly spoken, but
was probably in a foreign ton-
gue- it was hotly said and the
tirade finished with a swipe


across the jester’s face with the
back of a dark, heavy hand.
The riot died into a moment
of tense silence.
“Good for you, Dago Joe,
drawled a voice that, rough as
it was, was a delight to Dare
and Pip in this babel of mixed
tongues, for it had the Austra-
lian tang. “There may be
money in it, but helping to
blow other sailormen to bits is
nothing to iaugh at.
Someone essayed a sarcastic
laugh, but checked it when
there was no support. The man
who had been hit showed no
resentment and the tension
suddenly died, but the laughers
were silent. Suddenly hungry,
and surprised to find that they
could enjoy eating, the boys
joined in the assault upon the
rough but plentiful fare.
They had hardly finished be-
fore word came that the Cap-
tain wanted to see them. A
yellow-faced steward with a
scar spread all over one side of
his face, giving it a curious and
sinister look, took them to the
cabin. He had thrown them
some oilskins to don before
they started; they were needed
for as the boat dipped drench-
ing showers of spray came
aboard.
The sinister captain greeted
them with a roar of laughter,
and told them to sit down.


“Found your sea-legs, eh? ’
he said, genially. ‘‘Ready to
start work and all- ~
“We expect to work, said
Dare. „ r
“Well, that’ just as well, tor
you’re going to work, whether
you expect it or not said tne
captain. “1 suppose Jim Hardy
told you all about me.
Pip gave a quick look to-
wards Dare, but Dare was
ready with an answer.

thing to us. -pi
“1 don’t want any lies! me
captain’s voice changed to a
whipcrack. . . .
“Except that it was best to
just do what we were told and
keep our mouths shut. said
Da The captain darted a look
like a searchlight at Dare, then
turned sharply to Pip. ™V.°
added, “That was all. sir ;
then he grunted as if satisfied.
“Hardy’s a wise guy- He
knows his onions. -This is my
ship and it pays to be my

“Now you better sign up.
He adjusted a book and some
papers in front of him. You
first. Mick Reddy —You,
mean.
“Me?” gasped Dare,
“You’re Mick Reddy on this
ship/’ said the captain. And
you are lorn Daley. Oh, 1
know they’re not your right
names; • but you d want to
change those names after
murdering a man. ou don t

George (known as Pip) Appel
any more.
The captain showed very
evident enjoyment at the con-
sternation, Jthe revelation of his
knowledge about them gave
the boys.
“We didn’t kill him —”
“It doesn’t worry me wheth-
er you did or you didn’t. Ihe
German weasel was no friend
of mine,’’ said the captain.
“Nearly every man on this
ship is a murderer; i f he didn’t
kill someone the police in one


country or another want him
for something else. That chap
Hardy, for instance, would
jump overboard if he thought
1 was going back to San Fran.
Now, listen to me, I rescued
you, you understand, from a
raft at sea; you told me it
came from the Sea-Antelope,
sunk by Japanese bombers.
And you agreed to sign on as
members of the crew of the
Amirale Levanted on the re-
gistry of the port of Santa
Manesco. Republic of Para-
vama.
With the pen thrust in his
hand, Dare paused. "We
thought this was a British
ship,” he said.
The captain s ugly face
darkened unpleasantly.
“Oh, you thought, did you ?
The only thing you thought
about was getting away from
the cops. If you don t want
to sign on, you needn t,
of course. It might be bettei
for you if you did.”
“We’ll sign,” said Pip,
quickly. Dare, too, felt the
threat in the captain’s words
and used the pen. “We
thought it was a British ship,
you being English.
As Pip followed Dare, the
Captain seemed pleased.
“1 look English, heh ? he
said. The name s English, too
—Captain Bill Snaith. But my

lish and Portuguese, and he
married the daughter of a
Dutchman and a Cuban mixed-
breed. I’m as mixed as you
make them. And when there s

neutrals who make the money

ship, and what 1 say goes. I’ve
been on ships where there’s
been mutiny and it’s me that’s
come through it. Those who
work for me I pay well. Those
who don’t
He let a hoarse laugh finish
the sentence.
“Buccaneer Bill that s
me,” he said. And he went on
boasting about his exploits to
the boys, who, half scared
but fully amazed, wondered
how many of the incidents he
told them were true and when
he would stop. He seemed
childlishly pleased at an oppor-
tunity to talk about himself.
However, while he was in the
midst of it, the door half
opened. The Captain wheeled
quickly.
‘ Alright, Tasaki,” he said.
“In a minute.’
The door closed again
quickly, and Captain Snaith
pressed a bell which brought
the same steward as before.
He abruptly dismissed the
boys, talking rapidly in a lan


guage they did not understand
to the steward.
“That man who came to the
door —he was one of the men
who we saw leaving t e ow
er He looks hke a China-
man ” said Pip as they follow-
ed the steward along a pa
sage way. 11
“Chinaman nothing. He
might look like a Chow; but

ed the steward, tunng sharply
on them. He did not wait for
an answer, but led them to a

he used gave the boys a
ing that he might understand
and report any comments they
made. That kept them silent
The steward handed them
over in the engine-room to a
man as silent as himself, who
showed them by signs the work
expected of them. Talking
would have been impossible,
because of the noise of the: en-
gines; and in any case, the oy


were separated in their work.
Not until relief came, and
they climbed out of the hot
engine-room, into the coolness
of the night that had settled on
the moderated seas, did they
have any chance to speak of
what was uppermost in their
minds.
“How did that bloke know
about us? About the tower
and that man we killed ?
asked Dare.
“It’s simple. The radio
picked it up,” said Pip.
“What’s worrying me is what
the wireless is saying. I won-
der if they found anything that
linked up that man in the
tower with this Japanese,
Hi asaki. It would be alright
for us if they did.”
“They wouldn t, said
Dare, sceptically. They
wouldn’t have anything in that
tower that would put them
away. Probably they thought
that that fellow was just a
harmless German who had
lived m the country for years.
“Perhaps not, but
“For why are ye two lad-
dies yammering here the noo ?
Ye oughter have a swill, ta git
your temperatures doon, and

The chief engineer had
come upon them. He had,
earlier, passed them, watching


them at work, in the engine-
room. There always seemed
to be someone on this ship,
listening into what they had to
say. . ,
It was a conviction that grew
upon them more later.
“And a wee worrd of ad-
vice. to ye, ma laddies, the
chief engineer went on. k-ap n
Snaith is a guid mon—a very
cruid mon. He savit ma hte

If Peedro, whose place ye ha
ta’en, had keened that, he
might not ha fallen o rboar-rd,

ye.
They moved to obey, then-
eyes searching through dark-
ness that was punctuated by
flashes of whiteness where
waves broke, to a darkei
blackness in the far distance
that might have been coast.
Suddenly from the gloomy
distance a light gleamed,
faded, and reappeared several
times. There was a spluttering
sound at the masthead, and a
crackle of sparks.
“Wireless,” whispered Dare.
It was a wonder to the boys.
But the light did not show
again; the wireless continued
to crackle, but nothing further
happened; and the boys, went
for’ad.


CHAPTER IV. —DARE SPEAKS UP.
OVER the scramble for
food, which Dare and
Pip joined after a quick re-
moval of their already oil and
smudged stained overalls, and
a wash, there was excitement
over the wireless cracklings.
Someone said, “It’s them
mines; some of em have been
found. They're asking the
old man questions,” and some-
body else. “Shouldn’t wonder
if one of these navy ships
stop us.
Perhaps similar remarks
were being made in the ton-
gues that were strange to the
boys. Conversation was car-
ried on in the forecastle in a
variety of languages, as mixed
as the appearance of the men.
The talk was a babble; it sub-
sided a little when Dare and
Pip made their appearance.
Something suspicious seemed
to lurk in the looks that were
cast in their direction.
But a man whose dark skin
and features suggested some
part of negro blood, pushed a
dish of potatoes towards them.
“Guys must start
folk early in youah country,
he said. did you do m


two killed
the geyser you
foh?”
“Steady, Darky. sald
Hardy. “How’d you like some-
one to ask you about the coves
you killed, before they d
known you a day ?
Dare and Pip were startled
to discover that the knowledge
that they had shot a man was
already known amongst the
crew, and very evidently, had
been discussed. However, the
knowledge had certainly creat-
ed no feeling in their disfavour.
Dare said shortly; You
couldn’t call it killing. The
man would have shot us if we
hadn’t shot him ” And Hardy s
enquiry about how they liked
the work in the engine-room
created a new subject.
News spread in a curious
way where it would seem that
the least opportunity for know
ing it exists. Even in gaols, the
Inmates talk over happenings
in the world outside before
many free citizens know about
it Of this strange percolation
of news the youngsters were to
learn more, in a startling
fashion, shortly.
“We’re in a nice mess,
said Dare, when they got out
and climbed onto the roie
deck. There was darkness
everywhere, with no hg s
showing but the feeble flicker
of stars in breaks in the clouds


overhead. As the ship dipped
big combers seemed to break
menacingly from the misty
darkness ahead, but ever the
bow rose up, and seldom now
did any spray break aboard.
The seas had moderated some-
what.
Dare felt a certain exhilara-
tion in the motion of the ves-
sel, the sense of buoyancy m
its triumphant rise over the
waves; but feeling dismay at
their predicament was upper-
most in their heart.
“Were here amongst a
crowd of murderers, in charge
of a man who’s proud of being
a sort of pirate,” said Dare.
“And he’s helping the enemy.
“There’s nothing we can
do,” said Pip, with a shiver
“We’ve got to do as we are
told. The captain is quite pre-
pared to kill anyone wno
doesn’t go his way. a
skite. He likes to talk about
himself even to boys like
us, returned Dare.
“That doesn’t say he would
spare anyone who was incon-
venient to him, said Pip. ' '-
crew are scared of him.
“He’s helping the enemy.
He’s got a Jap aboard who
evidently has been doing
something in Australia that s
important. We ought to be
able to think of something to


do to stop him. 1 11 do anything
1 can . , t i i j
“Be careful. Dare! pleaded
Pip. He felt that Dare, hither-
to overawed like himself by
the circumstances into which
they had been plunged, was
beginning to find his old self;
and he was scared.
“If only that warship was to
stop us!” said Dare wishfully.
He looked over the rail at t e
tumultuous waters. I hey
couldn’t send a boat aboard in
this* but they’d probably make
us put into a port, if they want-
ed to examine the ship.
“What then?” shivered
Pip. “Buccaneer Bill is pro-
bably prepared for anything
like that; and if you tried to say
anything —even if he gave you
a chance to say anything . . •
If he suspected we meant to
try, he might drop us both
overboard before we got to
port.” , „ , , M , n
~ | 4*1911
Dare said, defiantly, 1 It
do something. 1 won’t stand
for helping the enemy. But
he was plainly despairing. The
hope that the hint of a stop-
page by a navy boat would
materialise in fact, had partly
prompted them to seek the fore
deck to see the approach of
such a ship; but the hope faded
as time passed; and sleepiness
stole upon them. Reluctantly
they went to their bunks.


Loud voices and a commo-
tion awoke them. There was
something of a struggle. When
they had leapt from their
bunks they saw that a seaman
it was the same man who
had laughed over the laying of
the mines, and had been struck
in the face by Joe had been
thrown backward and was half
sprawling on a seat with his
elbow on the table. But he was
still screaming and swearing.
“He keel-a my brudder! My
brudder on that a sheep.
His inprecations went on in a
strange tongue.
“He’s gone mad, said
Hardy, to the boys, when
saw them at his elbow. A
ship has been sunk by one of
those cursed mines. Some men
have got ashore; the rest are
gone. He reckons his brother
was m the ship.
“ ’Ow know your
brother was on er ? someone
asked, cutting into the bedlam
of the man’s oratory.
“Demetrio Sambia was —a
safed! He was —a my b rud-
der’s —vot you say —cobra!
Vere Sambia was —a dere my
brudder was —a. My brudder
was —a not safed.
“Well, you helped to put
out the mines,” said the owner
of that Australian drawl that
previously had heartened the
boys. “Perhaps it was one you


’andled yourself that did the
damage. . . i
That was plainly no consola-
tion to the raving man.
He was on his feet, his han
struggling at his belt. o a
vat da capitain say! He keel-a
my brudder. 1 keel-a da capi-
tal Ikeel—aheem! 1 keel—
a him!” he shrieked.
His jack knife was open m
his hand, and he made for the
door. But the broad arm ot
Hardy was across his chest and
stopped him. Hardy hurled
him backward and he v?
Ed back against the table. O -
viously the same thing ha
happened before. . .
1 “Don’t be a fool, Savierio.
said Hardy. > j
A sharp voice whipcracked
into the babel.
“Who wants to kill me •
Some dago rat that ,hasn t a
word to say when 1 am here.
he A ? silence that was almost
ghastly had fallen. Captain
Snaith. standing inside the
forecastle entrance looked a
commanding figure m spite ot
his ugliness, and more menac-
ing because of it. The men,
even Hardy. appeared to
shrink away from him as i
guilty and scared. Not the
least humble and silen
them all was the lately scream-
ing Savierio. He had caused


his open jack knife to make a
disappearance.
“You, Mick Reddy, here. In
front of me. Now who was
the swine who said he was
going to kill me ? Captain
Snaith bellowed.
“1 don’t know all the names
here, sir. If 1 did I wouldn’t
say,’’ said Dare, boldly.
“You won ’t heh ? You will
if 1 say. Point the man out to
»♦
me.
Dare stood silently in front
of his brow-beater.
“Come on; I’ve given you
an order,’’ said the captain.
The hard breathing of the
group of men could be heard;
that was all.
“Informing is dirty work,
Captain Snaith,’’ said Dare.
“I’m an Australian. So is help-
ing the filthy Japs, dirty
work!’’
Pip’s heart sank to his boots,
he heard Dare’s defiance; and
he gave a moan as Snaith s fist
bashed into his friend’s face
sending him sprawling. He
rushed to help him rise, but
Dare already rising with blood
on his face, whispered, “You
keep out of this Pip!
“You two —take that young
lout to my cabin,’’ commanded
Snaith, beckoning two of the
men. “If he makes any trouble
scruff him. You stand aside,
young Daley. As it happens, I


know who talked about kill-
ing me; but there has to be a
show-down, now and then.
You watch your tongue,
Savierio” He added some
words that were certainly not
flattering, in another tongue.
Dare, his white face con-
trasting with the blood that
was on it. held his head high
as the two men with quick sub-
servience. stepped one on each
side of him.
"Cap’n Snaith, the young-
ster’s only a boy, Hardy be-
gan — , ,
"Thai’s enough from you,
Hardy,” snapped the captain.
Pip with despair, noted that
Hardy stopped abruptly, as
cowed as all the others, bnaitb
looked contemptuously around
and then turned sharply and
followed Dare, as he was
marched off.
“Hold on. young un you
can’t do no good,” said Hardy,
seizing Pip’s arm as, waking
from a sort of stupor he made
to march after the departing
figures. “You might only make
things worse for young Mick.
Pip turned passionately
upon him and the other men,
relaxing now with some show
of being ashamed at the wav
they had been cowed.
"Are you men going to
stand for this?’’ he demanded.
"Are you going to let this


captain do what he likes with
Dare ? Perhaps kill him.”
“Gosh, son, there isn’t no-
thing we can do,” said Kelly.
Buccaneer Bill’s captain here.
He won’t do much to your
cobber; a bit of rope s end
perhaps, to learn him not to
give cheek.
“Turn in, laddie, said
Hardy, patting his shoulder.
“Aussie’s right; your mate
won’t come to no great harm.
There’s nothing you can do,
no-how.
His heart full of fears, Pip
found some comfort in the
rough sympathy of the two
men who in that forecastle
rabble seemed the most de-
cent, though he felt they were
lying to him. But his bunk was
the best place for some time;
he wanted to hide his eyes so
close to tears; for, without the
presence of Dare, he felt very
much a small boy who was
astray and helpless in a brutal,
cruel world.
* * * *
‘‘So, you young scamp, you
don’t know that 1 am captain
of this vessel yet, heh ? ” Well,
you’ll learn.’’
Dare held up his head de-
fiantly against the only blank
wall in the cabin, while Cap-
tain Snaith swinging in his
swivel chair at his desk, eyed
him from head to foot.


“1 know you are the cap-
tain,” said Dare „
“1 tried to tell you, sneer-
ed Snaith. "I told you that I
pay those well who help me,
but 1 don’t stand fior any
mutiny. It s mutiny

ers. And it’s less safe on my
ship than on others. 1 could

Dare knew that Snaith was
wanting to terrorise him m o
subjection; but his high-held
head disguised the despairing
terror that actually was in his
he "You spoke of helping the
Japanese. About mines,
Snaith said. i t
‘‘l didn’t say anything about
mines.” retorted Dare.
“Don’t tell no lies You
spoke of mines. Who has
been talking to you about
mines? Has Hardy •
“Captain Snaith, 1 told you
1 was no informer. 1 wouldn
say if anybody had spoken to
me particularly about mines.
But everybody m the fore-
castle has spoken about them.
It’s a filthy business.
“Why you j
Snaith rose in a fury and
stood menacingly m front


boy. Then, with his open hand
he struck him several times on
each side of the face. A surge
of desperation and fury which
banished all fear, welled up in
Dare. He struck hard, and
followed a blow which landed
in Snaith’s face, with a rush
that bore him back to his
desk. Then he hit again.
This success was only
momentary. Even as they
struggled, he felt the iron
power of Snaith s muscles un-
der his uniform and knew that
his own boy’s strength was no-
thing against it. Snaith slowly
forced himself to an upstand-
ing position again; then Dare
was hurled with a crash against
the cabin wall.
He felt half-stunned by the
impact, and when Snaith seiz-
ed him by the throat he was
almost past resistance.
“You young rat!” snarled
Snaith. “See, I could choke the
life out of you and what
could you do ? I am too strong.
I am the strongest man for my
size on the seven seas. In
rough-houses 1 have fought six
men at a time, six big men, and
have beaten them. I could
choke the life out of you now
as I did . . . But I let you go.”
It was only just in time. Dare
was struggling to keep his
swooning senses, his throat
was sore where the pressure


had been applied; he no longer
saw his aggressor clearly.
‘‘Here, you had better drink
this,’* said Snaith. “And you
can sit down —over there. You
young fool, 1 want to talk to
you.”
“One thing about you, Mick
Reddy, you’ve got guts/’ said
Snaith, after a pause. Those
rats in the f’castle haven’t a
spoonful of guts between them.
1 like courage. We can let
that idea of throwing you over-
board wait —if you’re ready to
play ‘ball’.”
“I’ll never be an informer,
Captain Snaith.
Snaith gave one of those
roaring, harsh laughs of his.
“Alright! 1 can get all the
Information 1 want without
you. Well, we’ll drop that.
Now look here, Mick Reddy,
you’re on my ship, and you
know, now, I’m master. Ihe
chief engineer says you a
good job. He’s satisfied. 1 m
satisfied. You 11 get paid for
your work —better paid than
on almost any ship. A darn
sight better paid, let me tell
you, than you would if you
were on a ship fighting for
your country as you call it.
“Fighting for your country,
if you have a country to fight
for, is a mug’s game. The sen-
sible man is the man who be-
comes a neutral and makes


money out of war.
“You just understand this,
young Mick Reddy. ou ic on
my ship, and you’ll do what I
tell you. What 1 choose to do
is no business of yours, and
you 11 raise no question about
it. Or else! That being un-
derstood, we can let the thi ow-
ing overboard stand over. And
the flogging 1 intended to give
you, too.’
“Does that mean 1 can go ?
asked Dare. He fell sick from
his rough handling and wanted
only to get away.
“Yes —get out. Only re-
member that that throwing
overboard is only suspended.
I’ll do it like a shot if 1 thought
it necessary. And if you go
overboard, so does that young
mate of yours. Better warn
him; 1 may have to discipline
him, too.
“Captain Snaith, he s only a
kid,’' said Dare. “It's my fault
that he s in this scrape.^
Dare saw the Captain s eyes
gleam.
“Alright; you warn him.
And remember that anything
you do will bring him in, too.
As Dare made his way back
to the forecastle, painfully, for
he was more shaken than he
had imagined by his rough
treatment, he remembered that
malicious gleam in the cap-
tain s eyes, and felt that he had


made a mistake in yielding the
sullen brute a weapon in his
protective feeling for Pip.
In the air he found that he
had literally to drag his feet
along; and slipping swooningly
on the steps leading down to
the well-deck he would have
crashed to the deck if Pip,
grown too restless to remain in
his bunk, had not been there
to hold him up. When he next
woke he had no recollection of
how he had reached his bunk.
But youth was with him. His
back muscles and head were
sore from the force of the im-
pact when Snaith had hurled
him against the cabin wall, and
his throat ached; but his worst
pain was the thought ot the
mastery Snaith had in his ship.
He had no doubt that Snaith
would go to any length to pun-
ish those who did anything to
his detriment. He was abso-
lutely ruthless.
“But still, Pip, he’s not going
to have it all his own way.
We 11 find something we can
do,” he said, resolutely.
When next they came up
from the engine-room, there
was excitement again in the
forecastle.
Savierio had disappeared
gone overboard, the seamen
said.
Dare remembered the
strength of Snaith s muscles.

CHAPTER V. —DARE FINDS A GUN.
r' APT AIN SNAITH called
the crew together and
demanded information from
any who knew what had be-
come of the missing Savieno;
Captain Snaith’s activity, how-
ever. only inclined these few
to the popular view that the
skipper himself was responsible
for the disappearance.
“The swine’ll enter it all up
in his log book.” said.
“If ever an enquiry should be
made, ’ell give that to free ’im
from suspicion. But he doesn *■
want us to be deceived, t e
way ’e spoke, as plain as could
be that ’e wants us to know in
our ’earts that ’e did the poor
cuss in, and it should be a
warning to us.
Hardy had become very
confidential with Dare and Pip.
He had a grudging admiration
for “that filthy swine Snaith.
As a neutral. Snaith had sailed


coolly into Sydney Harbour
with a cargo which, falsely
branded as regards contents
and destination, contained evi-
dence which, had it been pro-
perly investigated, would have
led to the confiscation of the
ship and prison for her owner.
Most of the crew knew that
they expected to pick up an im-
portant passenger there, but,
after mysterious and urgent
visitors had come to the boat,
it had left suddenly, dawdled
along on its way north, and
finally on a dark night, had
gone close inshore on a lonely
strip of coast while a boat had
picked up the passenger —and
Dare an d Pip.
“ ‘Li Hing' is the name on
’is baggage, what we picked up
in Sydney, but e am t no Chink
though e could pass for one,”
said Hardy.
‘ Buccaneer Bill called him
‘Tasaki,’ ” said Pip.
“ That's what e would be!
A Jap and a spy. Chinese
merchant —’e would pass for
that. Td like to know what
’e ’ad in that case ’e hugged
under his arm when he came
aboard. Might be the layout
of all the armed factories and
airfields in Australia, to make
it easy for the japs to bomb
'em out of existence.
“It might be,” said Dare,
white-lipped. We ought to


try to stop him. j y*
“And what could we do .

the captain’s wishes on thi

Pip, hopefully. He comes on

“We didn’t know about em

inery they were, on the cases,
and for delivery m Calcutta.


‘When we get to Calcutta,
then,” began Pip
“We ain’t goin’ to no Cal-

“Heaven knows where we re
bound for but it's somewhere
where the Japs are.’
“ 1 hen we don’t know when
we 11 get to wherever we’re

“It may be tomorrer; it may

Snaith —”
“The guid captain would
nae be verra pleased, mah mon,
ta ken ye had these puir laddies
oot yammering when they sh d
be ta’ing thair sleep in their
watch below.”
It was the chief engineer
who spoke. Climbing the lad-
der, unsteadily, he had come
upon them.
Yon laddie, Mick Reddy,
ah'll hae a luk at that bur-rn
ye got on yer arrm. Ah’m as
near to a ship’s dockthor as

engineer. ‘Ah’m goin’ farrad

“Drunken sot!” commented
Hardy. “The cap’n keeps ’im

Dare liked the chief engineer
MacGillicuddy. A man in the
engine-room had said, g rl
nine “Eef hees breath catck

He blow up.” But if Mac al-
ways smelt of whisky and was
frequently unsteady on
pins, there was no doubt about
his efficiency. He could
straighten up in a minute with
the knowledge that there was
something in his m.chmoy
that needed attention; and the
quickness and knowledge then
displayed was remarkable.
In Dare and Pip. the puir
laddies” always to him. he had


shown a fatherly interest.
Dare, with his arm dressed
as by an expert, came back
from his cabin so excited that
he awakened his friend from a
sleep.
“Pip! Mac is bonser,” he
said, “He’s made a good job of
my arm; it feels comfortable
now and the sting’s all
gone. But he kept me talking.
He showed me a model of a
tommy-gun he had there, he
explained all the parts to rne,
and showed me how it worked.
He says he s gom to invent a
new sort of gun and sell it to
whichever side will buy it. He
let me try and I could work
the thing. He says he’ll show
you the gun, too, if ever you
get hurt. It’s wonderful, 1 ip.
“Well, tell me to-morrow,”
said Pip, sleepily.
“But, listen, Pip, if we had
a. weapon like that and knew
how to use it, we might do
some thing.”
Pip sat up, suddenly.

'’You're mad. Dare, he
said. “You don’t want to start

‘‘Of course, but
Pip lay down again and
turned his back. But his inter-
est in that machine gun sent
Dare happy to sleep that


night. On his way to the Chief
Engineer’s cabin his mind had
been worried about Hardy s

there might be to interfere with
Snaith’s and Tasaki s plans,

spect of a way out had giyj n
him new encouragement. His
fancies might be futile things,
but they were pleasant.
CHAPTER VI— TASAKI STUDIES MAPS.
BOTH Pip and Dare were
settling down well and
finding their way about.
Corangi. and its boyish amuse-
ments seemed years behind,
and the ship as if they had
been on it for ages. 1 hey
knew all its alley ways and
ladders; they even learned to
answer their new names, an
when talking about one an-
other to others spoke of
“Mick” and “Tom The
work they did was hardening
them; they ate with an appe-
tite. and they felt fit. The
mixed crowd amongst whom
they were placed began to
sort themselves out; there were
good qualities in some of them
even if. as Snaith had said,
they were a “bunch of mur


derers. They became indivi-
duals instead of the chaotic
mass they had seemed at first.
The boys, working below
and asleep during some of the
hours above, saw few passing
ships. Those they saw in the
distance seemed to skurry as
if in a hurry to escape danger.
Occasionally a plane was
espied flying high; and some-
times one came down circling,
to have a good look at them.
But there was one day when
a destroyer came racing over
the seas, now calm in the
warmer weather into which
they had entered. Dare’s heart
gave a bound of joy, for he
thought the warboat’s ap-
proach meant that the Ad-
mirale Levante” would be
stopped and boarded.
Whatever was the conse-
quences to himself he intended
to speak to the officer who
came aboard and tell him of
the un-neutral conduct of this
supposedly neutral vessel.
The destroyer swung grace-
fully around when a short dis-
tance off, and messages were
flagged between the two ves-
sels. Dare and Pip watched
eagerly for the launch that he
expected would shortly leave
the warship’s side. But in vain.
“There’s a convoy over
there,” said Aussie. “See them
smudges of smoke there miles


away over on the horizon.
We’re being warned to take a
course away from il; they don t,
like the size of a convoy being
known by neutral vessels. ) ou

minute. i
Even as he spoke the
shadows of masts and super-
structure of the vessel shilted
strangely as she swung round
on a new course. The destroy-
er, too, turned. Ihe incident
was over. There would be no
boarding party of inspection.
Dare could have shouted
after the departing warships;
but he knew that such an out-
cry would be foolish and vain.
“We’ve got to think ol
something to Ho and think
quickly.” he told Pip- We

“We can’t do anything,
said Pip. “It’s no use our kid-
ding ourselves. We re just two
kids, and the dice are loaded
too much against us for us to
interfere. The only hope lor
us is to wait until we get to
some port where we can put
ourselves under the protection
of the British Consul, and

“We’ve got to do some-
thing,” said Dare, firmly.
“You’re wi th me, aren’t you,
Pip, if I find a way ?”
“Of course I’m with you,
sai d Pip. “But I still say there’s
nothing to be done. Let s talk
about something else. About
that machine-gun, for instance.
I’d like to see it.”
“And so ye shall see eet,
mah laddie,” said the Chief
Engineer. They had been talk-
ing on the same subject in the
engine-room, shouting against
the roar of the machines and

Whilst he washed, treated
and dressed Pip’s hand, a little
later, the chief engineer got

machine gun, which he did to
MacGillicuddy’s chuckling ap-
proval. Then the hand-dress-
ing being finished, he let Pip,
equally interested, try his skill.

planations. ...
‘Td like to have a gun like

heartily agreed with him. ft
“Whist, whist. laddies,

“1 think it beastly mean

“There’s more on this boat

“Mair, ye say! How mony
more ?
“There’s five to my know-
ledge; they do the work; but
they don’t like it. Dare de-
clared, in spite of the urgent
nudging of Pip s knee.
“Weell, laddie, keep the
knooledge of ut in y’r head.

Daley, you see what you ca.n

“A pretty picture. What
goes on here ? The harsh


voice of Captain Snaith, who
had jerked the door open sud-
denly, cut in sharply.
“Why, Cap’n Snaith, sur-r,
weelcom!” cried MacGilh-
cuddy, enthusiastically. Ah,

Cap’n hoo ut s doon.
Dare hesitated. Snaith s
face had no pleasant l°°k; he
was plainly displeased to find
them there.
“Go on, show me,” he said
curtly.
Dare obeyed. His handling
of the sub-machine gun was
workmanlike and quick.
“There ye are, Cap n! A
smart laddie an a guid gun.
No’ quite feenished yet; a little
gadget tae add for accelcratin

Captain Snaith was interest-

rounds a minute ?
“Two hundreed roonds a

"Til be in it with you, it you
wish." said Snaith. ‘‘l could

gun to my cabin .. You »° ys

cut o(f sharply.
They departed glad to
escape from the presence of
Buccaneer Bill, but paused to
hear Snaith say with his harsh
laugh. “There’s no need to
teach those young rascals how
to kill. Mac; they’ve killed a
man already. And don’t bother
about bringing a bottle; ve

“He's a cowl” Dare whisp-

his brains.’
There were four cabins,

open ports. Following his
example Dare, on tiptoe, peer-

had their first good look at

He was bent over papers on

roomy and
separate one for the sleeping
berth. 1 asaki, a squat man

for a Chinese, was too Intent

UP the steps towards the
bridge and on to the boat deck.
Following his example as he
went to ground against some
protuberances in the levelness
of the deck. Dare found him-
self against what was obviously
a fan-lighting, tarpaulin cov-
ered.
“No one will see us against
this,” whispered Pip. . } fou ™
it the night 1 was lookm round
to see what Buccaneer Bill was
doing to you.
He lifted a flap of the tar
paulin where it was loose from
the laced stays. Their heads
close together, they could look
right down into the cabin ot
Tasaki, their bodies at angles
were draped close to the tan-
light structure.
' “He’s copying maps, whis-
pered Dare. There was n 9 pos-
sibility of seeing any detail ex-
cept that he was markmg-m

was one of Australia.

maps and switched off the

lin off the fanlight. We thought
we could get down into the
cabin and find those maps.
Aussie whistled incredulous-
ly. ‘Tve got to get same caw-
fee. he said. He was back in
a minute, cup in hand.

“Listen, kids, have some

“We couldn’t get the tar-
paulin off; we hadn t our
knives with us, said Pip.
“And your call scared us
off.”
“I saw you; if it had been
someone else, you might have
been overboard in sacks or
stringing from the yard arm.

sters, have a bit of care. 1 m

I’m going now because some of
Buccaneer Bill’s pimps will be
tellin’ him that we’ve been
gassing together and he 11 want
to know what it’s about. But,
cut it out, kids. There’s too
many on this ship pleased with
Buccaneer’s big money and
scared to death of him to pull
off stuff like that.”
“Thanks, Aussie, said
Dare. He knew, thinking over
it, that that spontaneous idea
that came when 1 asaki left his
cabin was rash, and it s fulfil-


ment was unlikely. He was in-
clined to shudder at the dan-
cer they had run; it was a good
job, indeed, that it had been
Aussie and not another man
who had seen them when they
were trying to loosen that tar-
paulin.
But when the boys came up
from the engine room it seem-
ed as if the whole ship s com-
pany was scattered about the
c| 0 0
The bell had rung for-slow
speed some time ago. Now they
saw the reason and Dare s
heart sank. For alongside, no
twenty yards away, was a sub-
marine. and the aspect of the
men on its deck showed that it
was Japanese.
Dare’s immediate guess, and
Pin’s too, was that this sub-
marine, a large one had called
for the delivery of Tasaki and
his papers. That would mean
the end of any hope they had
of preventing them from reach-
ing the Japanese. They felt a
little relieved when it became
plain that something else had
caused the submarine’s appear-
3UCC.
On the bridge were Captain
Snaith, Tasaki, and a group of
officers who were, with the ex-
ception of the chief engineer, no
more than shadows to the know-
ledge of Dare and Pip. work-
ing in the engine-room. Using


megaphones, 1 asaki and the
officer who was apparently the
commander of the submarine,
shouted Japanese to one an-
other; Buccaneer Bill occasion-
ally took a hand, but, mostly,
Tasaki, or the sallow-complex-
loned wireless officer, who
looked very like a Japanese
himself, translated what was
said. None of the principal
actors seemed very pleased at
the nature of the conversation.
Buccaneer Bill appeared to
have no objection to the crew
forming an audience and Dare
and Pip joined with them; they
had seen very few boats, and
this was the first submarine
they had sighted.
A light rope was thrown
across to the sub., and again
Dare feared that the Jap and
his maps were to be transfer-
red. But, to their surprise, the
exchange came from the sub-
marine —a parcel which, wrap-
ped in oilskin, flopped in the
water and was drawn aboaid.
T hen the vessels parted com-
pany; the Amirale Levante
going full speed ahead, and
soon leaving the submarine,
which had begun already to
submerge.
The scramble for a delayed
meal was interrupted by the
entrance to the forecastle, with
the wireless operator in attend-
ance, of the first mate. They


cleared a space at the end of
a table and put down paper
and pencils. .
“Every man will this way
come, as his name called is,
and on this paper will write
announced the mate in painful,
precise English. ‘He will write
Lat.’ and ‘Long, and he will
put figures. He will also wn e

It is an order. Come. t e
summonsed the first man, Al-
casar! ’
It was a long business, men
interrupting their meals, to go
forward and sign and returning
to their food. Some could not
write at all, but made marks,
after suspicious questioning.
When it was done, and the
wireless man was bunching the
sheets together, the mate
spoke again.
“Someone on this or anuzzer
ship has been dropping mes-
sages over the board.

tude so much, such a time. Iwo

found he will be sorry. He will
be very sorry. . ,
"If he is a cursed Britisher,
Australian or American he will
be more sorry still, said the
wireless man. venomously, as


he disappeared.
The forecastle remained
stunned for a few moments.
' “That brown cow doesn t
seem to like Australians,
drawled Aussie. There was a
nervous laugh; and then a
babel of conjecture and ques-
tioning.
“You put a preparation on

coat; then the inflammable stuff

sarcastically. “An’ zee officers.

That, of course, was another
laugh. .
“You didn’t —you boys?
whispered Hardy anxiously.
“It ain’t you two coves who ve
been sendin’ them messages?


“How could we? We
wouldn’t know what figures to
use. But it looks.” said Dare,
eagerly, “as though there is
someone else on this boat who
is working against the Japs.
And the boat’s being shadow-
ed The messages would be no
good unless there was some
following boat to pick it up
a boat on which they wanted
to know our whereabouts or
the whereabouts of someone on
board. But who is it
“It might have been one ot
the officers; it probably would
be,” said Pip-
“ But which could it be .
“They’ve been with that
swine Snaith for donkey s
years,” said Hardy; except
MacGillicuddy, who he picked
up in Auckland; and he s al-
ways half sozzled anyway; and
the radio officer who was put
on by the Japs, 1 think, when
Snaith took up working with
them, and the first mate!
the first mate hates the British
and Americans.
“If he was a spy on Snaith
while he’s working for the
Japs, he’d sham that, protest-
ed Pip- „ .
While they had been talking
some news had filtered into the
forecastle. Some more men
who had been working on the
upper deck had come in.
Aussie brought the exciting


story over from the babbling
groups.
“The Aussies have licked
the tails off the Japs in New
Guinea,’’ he told the boys and
Hardy. Drove them right back
from Kokoda,’’ he announced
gladly. “There’s been a naval
battle, too, and the Yanks and
Aussies have given them yellow
bellies another hiding. They
say that’s what the Jap sub-
marine bloke was saying. He
didn’t put it like that, of
course. But that’s the gist of it.
Some of our boats were sunk,
though. Still, it must be pretty
bad when they brought orders
that this boat wasn’t to go to
New Guinea, because the
headquarters weren’t there
now, but further back.’
‘That’s great news, Aussie,”
crie d Pip.
“They’re great fighters, the
Aussies,’’ said Hardy. “The
Japs’ll learn something now
they’re up agin them. Pity
they didn’t get a good chance
at Singapore.’’
“If we’ve further to go,’
commented Dare, “That gives
us more time to stop ....
A warning nudge from Pip
caused him to leave what he
had to say unspoken. Others
beside Hardy and Aussie were
clustering around them.
In the midst of it, the almost
dumb steward arrived with the


order that Mick Reddy and
Tom Dale were wanted in the
captain’s cabin. Coming after
recent happenings, it was a
shock. As, pale faced, the
boys prepared to follow, Hardy
took a step after them.
“So it was you youngsters —
you silly kids,’’ he said.
“There’s nothing we can do;
we re helpless.’
“It wasn’t us who put those
messages overboard,” protest-
ed Pip.
“It may not be that, said
Dare, in a strained voice.
Buccaneer Bill was wearing
his darkest looks when they
faced him in his cabin.
“I want no more lies from
you boys,” he stormed. ‘You
tell the truth, or there’s means
of making you. Now, then,
who set you to watch on that
beach where 1 picked you up ?**
“We weren’t watching. We
had just climbed down from
the headland when we saw you
and you saw us.
“No lies, 1 tell you!” thun-
dered Snaith. “Don’t tel! me

ing that man and running off
because you were scared. You
didn’t kill him. The men who
killed him put you down there
to watch the beach. Now, then,
who were they?”
“What we told you was the
truth, Captain,” said Dare.


*1 ll flog the truth out of
you, if I have to get it that
way, cried Snaith angrily.
He continued to browbeat
them, but they persisted in the
story they had told him.
Right; you are a pair of
liars,” said Snaith. “Don’t
think Ive finished wi th you.
Come to the desk here and
write this: Now then, ‘Latitude
I 2, South, Longitude, 53.’ No
attempt to disguise your hands,
now; just write it quickly.”
I don’t know how to spell
‘Latitude,’ ” explained Pip.
“1 do n’t care a damn how
you spell it. Three “t’s” will do
me,” said Snaith overlooking
their work. He grunted as he
took the paper on which they
had written, comparing it with
some crumpled slips he had in
his hand.
“Whe re does that place
us?” he asked sharply and
suddenly.
”1 do n’t know,” said Dare
to whom the question was most
directly addressed. “I know
what latitude and longitude
means, of course, but —”
‘There s a map of the world
on the wall there. Find the
place; both of you.”
Both Dare’s and Pip’s grop-
ings were a revelation of the
ignorance of those who have
never been taught how to read
a map.

about that any more, Sna'th

He paused and took a few
paces up and down his cabin.
“Any more of it,’’ he shot
at them, harshly, “and I’ll
have you strung up and flog-
ged, as an example; yes, Tom
Daley will be flogged with
you, young Mick Reddy,
though you’re the ringleader.
You’ll learn what a ship’s flog-
ging is like; I’ve seen grown
men die under it.’
He had seated himself and
paused to let his threat sink in.
“Shut up, and do your
work, and you’ll be alright.
I’ve put you on man’s wages;
and I’ll give you a fiver each
over that when this voyage is
over. That’s if you behave. If
you don’t —well, there’s not
only that flogging, but when
we get to to where we re
going 1 will hand you over
to the Japs. They’re savage
people really; they don’t like
Australians; and they know a
good deal about being very
disagreeable.’
“You’d better think it over,


you boys, said Snaith, 1 m
having you watched. I was
going to have you flogged, m
any case, just as an examp c *
but you’ve escaped for the
time. One of the reasons is
that we re running into a ncvi
of a storm, soon. ou 11 know
what a hurricane's like. All
hands will be wanted to snug
down, even those free from
the engine-room, 't ou d better
get back. , ,
That Dare and Pip should
feel crushed and scared when
they left the captain s cabin,
was inevitable. They went sil-
ently. surprised to find the
change that had come over the
sea and the sky. Ihe vessel
was plunging erratically in
waves that seemed to have
pown to an enormous size and
a strong wind was whipping
the crests into foam and sweep-
ing spray aboard and across
the sea; the same wind was
humming in ropes and around
the masts; and men were rac-
ing about various parts of the
vessel tightening up. sewing
covers on the holds, and rop
ing everything that was mov-
able. Ahead a mass of amor-
phous blackness was beaiing
down upon them.
••y ou —a lads, come
here! commanded the boat-
swain, and in a moment they
were filled with the same fever


of urgency which was inspiring solid, moving wall. It came
all the other men. with a roar and a snarl, and the
A whistle blew sharply, and
Aussie came running past as
the boys finished their last tie.
'Come on, cobbers. Get
some scran while you can, he
called. “It may be our last
chance. The cook’s snugging
down, too, and no one can tell
when there’ll be more.’
But the hurricane, when it
struck, hit the vessel like a
vessel heeled as if being push-
ed over by some mighty giant
hand that was determined to
thrust it under the waves. A
sound like the tearing and
rending of iron was heard over
the tumult and every article
that had been left loose on the
tables fell, crashing, and rat-
tled across the floor.
CHAPTER VIII.—ACQUITTED!
TT N D E R that terrific on-
slaught it certainly seem-
ed that the vessel must cap-
size. A prolonged period of
time seemed to pass, and fur-
ther, further, the pressure
seemed to be forcing the ves-
sel. Then slowly, slowly, at


first, and, then, with a rush
leaping upward as it seemed,
the vessel came back to the
perpendicular; the next minute
it was heaving over the other
way so steeply that Hardy,
who had staggered to help
Dare to his feet, and Dare
were thrown, with a rush
against the bunks. ~
“She’s a beauty, this blow,
said Hardy. “Don’t be scared,
you young coves. There s one
thing HI say for that swine
(he had no other term than
that for Buccaneer Bill) .
“there’s not a sailorman m the
Pacific I’d rather have m
charge in a storm.
Appalled in his heart by
another terrible roll that seem-
ed to bring them nearer than
ever to a complete capsize,
and then by a quicker recov-
ery and a dive that seemed to
take them down, down into
the depths. Dare was unable
to speak for some minutes.^
“She can’t live m this, he
said ‘‘She’ll be wrenched
apart. There’s one thing, if she
sinks the Japs won t get what
they re expecting from her.
“You’re a game young cove,
lookin’ at it like that, sal
Hardy. “Meself, We got no
wish to be drownded. We 11
get through —alright.
Even the worst of ter-
rors softens when it is pro


longed, and, as they endur-
ed the buffeting, still think-
ing that each new terrific
roll or plunge might be the last,
the boys became used to it.
Grumbling men rushed here
and there to emergency calls,
to fasten more securely fix-
tures that had loosened, or to
work the pumps on the water
that had poured onto the
well decks.
And then, suddenly, the
chief engineer, his oilskins
dripping water, appeared.
“You twa laddies: I want ye.
Twa men hae been hurrted in
the engine room. Ye 11 hae tae
work-rk for an extra hour or
so.
“The man’s drunk as usual,
muttered Hardy, who had re-
tained his seat on Pip s bunk.
“You can smell that whisky
from here! But you’ll *ave to
go, youngsters.”
They were not unwilling. In
the terror of the storm it
might be better to be doing
something, than merely waiting
for the vessel to fall to pieces.
“Steady, laddies, steady,*
said MacGillicuddy, “keep a

slipped a few steps, but his fin-
ger-hold saved him. After that
he was more careful.
The engine room, in its way,
was more terrifying than the
forecastle. It was an inferno.
The roar of the storm was un-
heard, and the roll was natur-
ally less felt; but sometimes it
seemed as if the plates beneath
their feet had become a wall
instead of a floor; the mach-
inery rattled and groaned as if
at any moment, it would be
torn from its fastenings. Occa-
sionally there was an alarming
check in the thunderous but
rhythmic beat of the engines,
as though something had
broken.
“We ll have to keep a guid
head o steam, shouted the
chief engineer. If the ship
daesna’ have a good lee-way in
this storm, she’s gone!
Hanging on to any support
available, with every lurch
and roll the boys grew more
accustomed to the storm, and
their confidence gradually re-
turned. The vessel was still
afloat. But there still came
lurches which, it seemed, must
make a finish.
Dare felt almost regretful as
his terror of the storm became
less. He thought of other
things. If the vessel got
through, Tasaki, and whatever


he carried with him, would be
delivered to the Japanese. Un-
less they could do something
to stop it! The news that
messages had been found had
given him hopes that there was
an active, if unknown, partner
in his patriotic desires, on
board, and of some following
help. But this hurricane would
make a big difference. Any
information of their position
found by another vessel might
be useless now.
“Pip.” he shouted they
were apart by themselves, and
to shout against the rattling
and roar of the machinery was
safe; "I’m going to have anoth-

Pip turned a white, scared
face towards him. . „
“Gee, Dare, let’s drop it,
he appealed, “We can’t do
anything, and we 11 be caught.

kids .... I*ll *•
“You needn’t come; 1 11 go,
said Dare, shortly.
“Ah, gee, Dare, I d have to
go with you, said Pip. But
what’s the use?”
‘‘You're scared of that hog-
ging Buccaneer Bill promised,”
jeered Dare.
“Well —aren’t you? And


I’m scared of him handing us
over to the Japs. I’d sooner
be thrown overboard.
Dare got a queer feeling
about Pip. He felt as though
he was years older.
“Besides, Dare, it wouldn’t
be safe on that open boat
deck. A sudden lurch and —”
Forget about it, Pip, said
Dare. “I’ll do it myself.”
“Oh, gee, Dare!” protested
Pip. He made no further pro-
testations; but he looked so
miserable that Dare felt sorry
for him.
Nevertheless, later, he was
with Dare as they stole up to
the boat deck that night. Dare
had stolen out intending to go
alone, but he’d found his chum
at his heels.
The storm had moderated
somewhat but was still heavy.
The vessel lumbered through
the waves, but the well-deck
was no longer flooded. And
it was almost without water.
The wind had fallen; and the
intense darkness was an advan-
tage to the boys who, with
pounding hearts, made their
swift dash to the fanlight, and
worked away the tarpaulin.
A warm light glowed from
below and the sound of voices
came to them, as, caut ously,.
they drew back the loose flap.
Peering down, they saw Cap-


tain Snaith and Tasaki seated
at the table on which previous-
ly the maps of the Japanese
had been spread. They had
drinks before them.
“Would you honour me,
esteemed Capitan by allowing
us to talk in English, asked
Tasaki. “Your Japanese is
most excellent and learned,
but unfortunately 1 do not un-
derstand it. Perhaps you can
better understand mv humble
English.
“Well, have it your own
way, Tasaki,” said Snaith, ob-
viously nonplussed. ‘ 1 was
coming to talk matters over
with you before the storm. You
weathered it all right ?
“I am used to tornadoes, my
friend,” said lasaki. ! have

“Well, then, you knew 1

but they weren’t in that.”
“Troublesome? So! It will

them over to our people. They
will make them not so trouble
some.
! might do that. 1 told
them so, said Snaith. But,
look, Tasaki, my crew is my
crew, and I’ll not have any in-
terference. If 1 hand em over
well and good; if I want to
keep them, well and good, also
they've got stuff in them, those
boys. If they’re reasonable, 1
hope to make as good black-
guards of them as any in the
Pacific.”
“They killed our friend,
said Tasaki.
“You’re not worrying about
that lousy German ? Don t
tell me you Japs care about a
few Germans being popped
off.” Snaith laughed.
“The Germans are our
friends,” said the Japanese,
stiffly. “But if the boys did not
send the messages, who else ?
The first mate ? ”
“There’s not a man on the
whole ship whose handwriting
compares with that on the slips.
Except Sparks the wireless
man. And your people nomin-
ated him. Are you so sure of
Sparks ?”
“He is one quarter part
American: he was educated in
America; that is bad. But he
hates America; he is three-
quarter parts Japanese in blood
and all Japanese in spirit. He


has done good work for Japan.
What of the others?”
”What others?” Snaith en-
quired. ‘They’ve been with
me and they daren t do any-
thing. What do you think ot
MacGillicuddy?”
The drunken Scotchman.
Oh I have seen him get drunk

He is only a fool. The Jap
was contemptuous^
“He’s a damned good en-

“The British peoples are not clear. There’s nothing aboard

venomously. “They are merely
foolish. But they found out
about me, and I had to run for
it. They wake up, sometimes,

There was a tap on the door
and the steward came into the
light, with a large tray.
“1 thought I might as well
eat with you to-night, Tasaki,”
said Snaith. . . .
Dare nudged Pip, the latter
followed him, and swiftly they
made their way back to the
forecastle. “It was no use stay-
ing longer,” whispered Dare
as they ran.

Could you get doon that?’
“Yes, I think so,” said the
surprised Pip.
“I drapped ma favorite pipe
doon there. Ah thocht ye
might get it for me, if ye’r
small enough to get through. I
have a rope. Ah alsae have a
wee torch.” ,
Pip, hesitating briefly,
agreed. The request was sur-
prising, but it was the chief
engineer and there were no
points in not obliging him. At
the end of the rope he was
lowered down the shaft. He
had not gone far before he
touched the floor, and switch-
ed the light of the torch, sur-
prised to find himself in a
small chamber.
“Are ye all richt, laddie
came MacGillicuddy’s voice
softly down the shaft. “What
d’ ye see doon there?’
‘ Guns; guns like the one in
your cabin,” responded the
scared Pip. “Rifles, pistols and
ammunition.”
“And no’ ma pipe?”
“Yes, your pipe’s here.’
“Did ye say goons* ?

licuddy s voice. „
“Yes, there are guns.

there was not a sign of them.

And dinna say nothing to no-

He talks a wee bit too boldly.
“An wait, laddie. Guns, ye
said ? Did you say there were
many guns ? ”
“Stacks of them; and boxes

“My! My! The guid captain
must've thocht that soom time
he'd have to arm the crew to
fight. Now, run along, laddie,
and mind what 1 tell’t ye.
Mum’s the word.’
Pip felt frightened and a
good deal out of his depth.
MacGlllicuddy’s actions and
the disappearance of the guns
puzzled him. There had been a
moment when he had thought
that the incident was one of
which he could gladly tell
Dare, suggesting the chief en-
gineer as an aid to action; but
the smell of whisky he had en-
countered as MacGillicuddy
helped him out of the ventila-
tor had killed the notion. The
drunken engineer would be no


aid in anything. It would be
well, he decided, not to tell
Dare; Dare, directly he heard
about the weapons would be
alive with enterprise, to
recruit assistants amongst the
crew, and would precipitate
the trouble with which Snai
had threatened them. Ip X

floggings. a=leeD
Dare was still fast asleep
when he got back to the fore-
castle. That gave him an excuse
for what his conscience told
him was almost a betrayal
Captain Snaith s prophecy
that they would meet the hur-
ricane again, was only pa y
right The hurricane smote
again with an intensity as sav-
age as before, but passed
rapidly. There was only the
oidinary easy rol[ of the sea
when Dare and Pip prepared
for their next shift.
There was some excitement
aboard. A ’plane was causing
discussion as it swooped down
low, making a graceful cue.
over the boat. Snaith and
Tasakl were standing on the
upper deck, when the plane
Allied by its markings, dived
lower still and then began to
circle round. As it did so the
vessel’s siren hooted, once.
twice, thrice. • • • • . , . .
“What does the fool thmK
he’s doing?” cried Snaith.


The boys could not hear penings of the previous night
him, but they saw him talking:
and 1 asaki had something to
say, too.
“1 wonder what that was in
aid of?” Dare said to Pip as
they descended the iron lad-
der. “It was one of our planes
and its behaviour had Buccan-
eer Bill worried.
“We can’t be so far from
land,” was all that Pip said,
still worried that he was keep-
ing a secret from Dare. Sud-
denly he made up his mind.
“Dare, there are guns on
board. MacGilhcuddy has
some of them, he said.
Dare stared. Mac ? Pip
gave a full account of the hap-
and Dale’s face showed his ex-
citement. MacGilhcuddy! But
1 can't understand what he
would want with guns. He’s al-
ways half drunk and- . . . Pip»
we could get some of those
arms ourselves.’
Pip had known it would be
like that, and was appalled at
the prospects. Dare would want
those guns at once, and the
risks they would run would be
terrible.
“Mind, Dare,” he warned.
“There’s a chap watching us.
Don't show your excitement.
I’ll come back and talk to you
later.”
He walked away, resuming


work oiling machinery. He
could see Dare looking over to
wards him. Ideas daring

through Dare’s brain, and Kip

voice. Pip knew that Dare, m
his mind, had been counting
on help from the chief engineer
in some desperate scheme, and
that MacGillicuddy s drunken
condition wiped about his
dreams.
Smelling of whisky, the chief
engineer reached the plates,
and suddenly rivetted attention
on part of the machinery as it
attracted by something wron a .
He fingered a few pipes, an
beckoned the boys.
He was still pointing to the

“Would 1? Try me! r
“We will. You see, we ve


found out that the chief en-
gineer is with us. Will you
come to the engine-room, just
inside the door, a few minutes
after you see me go. We ve got
guns.”
‘Mutiny —cripes!” exclaim-
ed Aussie, apparently ap-
palled.
“It’s got to be done for
Australia,” said Dare urgently.
“We only need a few men.
Hardy and —” *
“Dago Joe. I’ll bring the
Dago; he’s sound,” said Aus-
sie. “But MacGillicuddy! He’s
a drunk!”
“Aussie, he isn’t drunk. He
smells of whisky, but he was
cold sober,” said Dare. “Come
and hear what he has to say.
He was relieved that Aus-
sie’s apparent reluctance had
disappeared. But he still had to
speak to Hardy.
But Hardy, as he sat beside
him at the table, spoke first.
“What madness are you about,
young cove-” he asked. Pip
as been tellin me. I ain t
goin’ to be strung up for no
madcap scheme.
“But Hardy, we’ve got
plans. We can’t go wrong,”
said Dare, hoping that what he
said was really the case. ‘We
need you.”
“Oh, I’ll be there at the en-
gine-room, said Hardy. If
anything can be done agin


that swine Snaith, s elp me, 1 11
do it.” . ,
Satisfied, Dare was glad that
the call came quickly. He
found MacGillicuddy inside
the engine room entrance.
“/\fe your men coming?
MacGillicuddy asked, eagerly,
without a trace of his Scotch
accent. And as Dare nodded
he waited until the messenger
on whose heels the boy had
followed was well down the
ladder, before speaking again.
‘Til explain when the others
come. In the meantime here s
your tommy gun. See that you
remember its action \ but put
the safety catch on. It s
loaded.*
He had opened a cupboard
normally used for oil-cans and
supplies and gear for the en-
gine-room. There were other
guns in it besides the one he
had given to Dare. The feel
of it in his hands thrilled the
boy.
The engine-room door open-
ed sharply. Aussie and the
Dago Joe arrived, with Aussie
scruffing another man ahead of
him. “ This man was snoopin ,
I thought we best bring the cow
in.
“A squeal out of you, my
man," said MacGillicuddy to
the captive, waving a revolver
in the already cowed fellow s
face, "and you're dead meat.


He turned to Aussie. “Austra-
lian initiative! You’re Austra-
lian, aren’t you? 1 thought so!
Well, you did the right
thing.’ He turned to Dare,
“Mick, hand your gun to
Aussie, and get out two others;
they’re ready loaded. 1 hey’ll
only need to know how to con-
trol and fire. I’ll have to go
down for a moment.’
Half way down the ladder
he called the men in th e en-
gine-room to attention.
“You men are to carry on
below there. Any movement
to come up and you’ll be shot,
he said. “Anyone who ap-
proaches the bridge-speaking
tube will be shot. The engines
are at half speed; they’ll stay
that way. No calls from the
bridge will be noticed. Any-
body who disobeys any of
these orders will ht shot.
We’ve got guns up here. You
all understand?’’
Their faces looked up, pale
and astonished. But they un-
derstood. Dare, machine-gun
in ha nd abo ve hi m, helped the
understanding.
“Yah, we understands.,
chief,’ said one.
MacGillicuddy was back as
Hardy and Pip came in. 1 hey
made a crowded group on the
steel platform. First the chief
engineer told Aussie’s cower-
ing captive to go below warn-


mg him to stay there. Then he
turned to the group.
“Men. In no longer a
drunken engineer. The whisky
you smell is on my clothes. 1 m

men, who hate working for the

“Well, sir,” ob 3ected
Hardy, “why all this? Why

“This is supposed to be a
neutral ship.” said MacGilh-
.cuddy. “It was suspected for a
long time; but nothing could
be done, even m Sydney -
We’ve got to be able to hand
over the evidence that will jus-
tify the seizure. That s the
only way —before the evidence
can be destroyed, as it would
be destroyed if Snaith saw that
was the only way out. __
“1 don’t like mutiny, ob-
jected Hardy. “I ’ate that swine
but 1 ain’t goin’ to ang for
nobody.’ ,
“There’d be worse than that
if Snaith handed us over to the
Japs,” said Dare.
‘‘Yes- it’s actually saving
some of you men. It’s Snaith’s
idea; to hand over to the Japs
the men who show any opposi


tion to his doings, and replace
them by new men in Manilla.
You can guess what the Japs’d
do to you,’’ said MacGilli-
cuddy.
“We’ve got to take control;
but we have weapons and sur-
prise on our side,’’ pursued
MacGillicuddy.
“Only a few men are needed;
we have enough here. We will
have to guard the engine-room
here; young Tom, you can do
that. Shoot if any of the men
below attempt to come up, or
go near the telegraph. And we
want to keep the rest of the
crew, and those who come in,
in the forecastle.’’
I’ll look after that. Chief,’’
said Aussie. “I’ll know the
blokes who won’t be sorry that
something of this sort is on.’
“You’re the man,’* said
MacGillicuddy. “The rest with
me to make a swift swoop and
capture Snaith and the other
officers. “Well, Hardy?’’
“I’m with you, sir,’’ said
Hardy. “After all I’ll be glad
to get at that swine. 1 know
how to andle a tommy-gun.*’
Swiftly MacGillicuddy arm-
ed his party, a revolver andl
sub-machine gun to each man,.
With a rush Hardy, Dare
and the Dago, on the heels of

warning that if he made an out-

A quick round of the upper
deck yielded two officers

to see armed men, and probab-
ly most of all to see an alert
MacGillicuddy with a revolver
in his hand. They quickly be-
came amenable to the com-
mand that they should make
no outcry. Then, they, with
three seamen,, joined Snaith s
steward.

“That explains why, said
McGillicuddy with a sweep ot
his arm. The grey shape ot a
destroyer was making its waj
across the waters midway to
the horizon, but was still a long
way off. Dare glowed when he
saw it. and Hardy said. Ihe

He gave them a few detail-

Dare, mounted the steps.
Amazed at the ease with which
they had succeeded so far, Dare
sprang after him. The mate,
descending, ran into them.

“You’re my prisoner. Mister
Mate, returned MacGilli-
cuddy. “Explanations can

further ing to, Mister?” Snaith called.
The first mate had his
hands above his head, but
answered his skipper. Mister

peared above the bridge com-

“ 1 here is nothing drunken

“Like hell you are!’


“1 won’t argue. Hold up

I’ll shoot you down. Keep him
covered, boy, and nre i e

It all happened in an in-
stant. One moment Snalth was
there; the next he was gone.
He had fallen flat, and al-
though the chief engineer when
he-saw his intention called:
“Fire, lad!” and himself dis-
charged his revolver t e
bullets tore into the air harm-
lessly. , . .-ii
The captain s voice was still
heard, though he was not
seen. He called at first for
those with him to get the arms
in the bridge house.
“You fool, MacGillicuddy!
You’ll pay for this!” he shout-
ed “We have arms up here on
the bridge; I have always been
ready for an emergency. It you
have the whole ship s com-
pany with you 1 defy you to
take us. here. Any man who
tries to come to this budge
will be shot down.”
As an earnest of his state-
ment, some bullets zipped un-
pleasantly close to both the
chief engineer and Dare. Mac-
gillicuddy motioned Dare to
move back. “Take this man
with you,” he said. The mate,
still with hands high, made his
way down the steps gingerly.
“Snaith,” cried MacGilh


cuddy, ‘resistance is useless. 1
don’t want to have to kill you
all up there; you’d better sur-
render.”
A laugh answered him.
“If you’re relying on that
destroyer, you’d better think
again, MacGillicuddy. In an-
other half hour that destroyer
will be blown out of the water.
We’ve radio’d for planes to do
it; they’re on their way now.’
CHAPTER X—THE BATTLE IS ON.
'"THERE was a fusilade of
A shots. Some of them
tore holes in MacGillicuddy’s
clothes, but did not actually re-
gister a hit. Dodging, he drop-
ped down to the deck beside
Dare and his prisoner, spring-
ing aside from the companion-
way steps against which the
bullets splintered.
“A set-back, laddie,” he
said, grimly. “We won t be
able to get near that bridge.
But none of those up there can
come down, either, if we keep
the way covered with machine-
guns. First thing, though, we’ll
have to put Mister Mate in
with the rest.*
“Mistare MacGillicuddy, I
am zee man of peace,” pro-
tested the mate. “None I fight.


But 1 protest, 1 am neutral; dis
sheep, he is neutral. Dis thing
you cannot do. It is against
law of neutrality. As a citizen
of Paravania, I protest.
“This isn’t a neutral ship.
It’s a pirate. Every neutrality
law has been dishonored by its
captain,” returned MacGilh-
cuddy.
Protesting still, the mate
was locked up, with the others.
Their cabin had two portholes,
not large enough probably to
allow a man to squeeze out;
yet as he opened the door,
MacGillicuddy saw one of the
men working at the port as ir
to unscrew the fittings. ,lrie
bullet he sent whistling at the
working fingers grazed them
and the man jumped back with
a howl of pain.
“That’s to let you all know
that this is no joke. If > ou y e "
main quietly here. you re
safe.” said the chief engineer.
“I’ll shoot any of you who
tries any tricks; and my men
have orders to shoot, too.
He called Hardy and Dare
to him. “We can’t get those
fellows on the bridge —yet,
he said. “This is the Part of
the ship we must hoid. e
don’t know how many there
are up there; but they are not
many. Some may try to come
over the boat deck and down
the sides. Whoever is guarding


the deck will have to watch for
that. It would be as well to
fire a burst now and then up
to the bridge companionway,
to let them know we’re awake;
but generally they can’t come
down any more than we can
go up.”
“I’ve got to do a bit more
rounding-up,” continued Mac-
Gillicuddy, turning to Dare.
I’m going to leave you in
charge here, Mick Reddy
You’re satisfied with thht,
Ha’rdy?”
“Meaning es only a lad, sir,
and you think I might object
to take orders from him?’
Hardy said. “ ’E’s a game un,
an’ there’s nobody I d sooner
work under.’
“Good! I’ll tell the Dago.
You’ll have to patrol both
sides of the deck, Mick, give
help and leadership,, and keep
an eye on the prisoners. I’m
going to the fo’csle to see how
Aussie is getting on, and speak
to the men. I’ll tell them their
position; if they’re willing to
give aid, now, they will escape
punishment for being members
of the crew of a pirate ship;
those who resist will certainly
be punished/
“Ye’ll find sev-ral ready to
come over, especially on them
terms,” said Hardy. “Joe Val-
dar’s one.’
“We can do with more


guards. . ,
“But ’ow are you gom to
get to the foVsle. Mister
Mac?” demanded Hardy. It
they has arms up there, they
pink you as you cross the we
deck.” ,
“1 can get into the forecastle
from below, decks. Hardy,
said MacGillicuddy. 111 have
to round up the rest of the
watch on deck, and speak to
them, aft. I can manage that
on my own. Remember —keep
your eyes open.
“Captain Snaith is calling
you, Mr. MacGillicuddy.
Dare’s quick ears had caught
the call. ,i i r
MacGillicuddy walked foi-
ward; until he was directly un-
der the bridge. . . ,
“What now. Captain bnaitn,
are you willing to surrender ?
he shouted.
curse answered him.
“What have you done to my
engines, MacGillicuddy?” roar-
ed Snaith. “I’m calling tor
speed and no-one answers.
“The engine-room is under
my orders, Snaith; and I U
stop the engines altogether ir
you try to steer away from that
destroyer, as you re doing.
“You’re acting like a mad-
man, mister,” Snaith called.
“Let’s talk it over. Let’s have
a parley. If you come up here,
you won’t be harmed. We can


talk it over, and you can go
down again when you wish. 1
pledge you my honor.
‘Tve no faith in your honor,
Snaith, and there’s no question
of a parley. The only way I’ll
treat with you is to let you, or
any with you, come down with
your hands up. If you try to
come down any other way,
you’ll be shot.
Disregarding the curses ol
Snaith, MacGillicuddy strode
back to Dare and Hardy.
“Look, Mr. MacGillicuddy
—the planes.”
They had come, those
planes threatened by Snaith.
Like hawks, they rode high in
the sky, five of them. Even as
they watched, gun flashes
showed from the destroyer and
the puffs of the exploding
shells spread smudges in the
sky.
MacGillicuddy looked up at
them anxiously. 1 have a lot
to do, and can’t watch the
battle,” he said. But I think
we can trust the navy. Take
charge, Mick.
He was gone. Hardy looked
after him. “Blow me, he used
to do that act well; His clothes
still smell of whisky,” he com-
mented.
“Look, Hardy,” cried Dare,
gripping his arm. Breaking for-
mation, the planes began to
circle* over the destroyer. One


only continued on and some-
thing dropping from it, catch-
ing a flash from the sun, now
and then, as it fell.
The air became lull ot
tumult, the “zoom” of the
planes and the rattle or the
pom-pons on the destroyer the
curious crack of the shells high
in the air. A stick of bombs
from the highest plane had hit
the water, but far wide ol the
mark.
The other planes had come
in for a low range attack. Com-
ing down at a terrific speed, the
first flew over at mast-head
height, its machine guns rat-
' tiing, as it swept over the stern
of the destroyer. T.he next two
planes came zooming on each
side of the destroyer; the
bombs of one were dropped,
but the geyser of water arose
far from the target. The de-
stroyer had been brought round
so that it was bow-on to the
line of attack. The fourth
plane veered away.
When he got back to Hardy,
one of the planes had evident-
ly attacked the destroyer again,
the geysers rising from the sea
were just settling down, but
were well clear of thte destroy-
er which was steering a zig-zag
course and had turned com-
pletely round.
Momentarily Dare was puz-
zled for there was now anoth


er plane in the air.
“That’s the destroyer’s
plane,’ said Hardy, when he
pointed. “They catapulted
her out just now. One against
five! Game! 111 say.
An enemy plane had de-
tached itself to go after the
navy plane which was climbing
and swerved to avoid the at-
tack. Two other planes were
circling, puzzled at the quick
changes in the destroyer s
direction, striving to get into
position for a strike. Dare s at-
tention, however, became
rivetted on the Jap plane that
had been struck.
Trailing black smoke, it was
coming back at terrific speed,
straight for the destroyer, the
pilot determined to make of
himself a human bomb.
If he hit the destroyer it
would probably be the end.
Dare felt the anxious grip of
Hardy’s hand on his arm; his
own fingers had no less tense
grip on his tommy gun.
It flashed through his mind
that if the destroyer were sunk,
they would be left with a hard
fight on the “Amirale Lev-
ante.” They would have to
clear that bridge; and per-
haps, with the destroyer gone,
the support they might get
from the crew would become
fainthearted. Their battle was
being fought over that de


stroyer.
The suicide plane seemed
to gain speed as it neared the
destroyer. At fifty feet it ap-
peared that it could not pos-
sibly miss. A roar of delight
went up from Snaith and the
men on the bridge, but it was
drowned by the noise as the
plane exploded in a roar of
flame and smoke.
Two other planes came in
on the tail of the one that had
failed, with the idea of com-
pleting the destruction that the
suicide pilot intended. As they
zoomed over the destroyer
they dropped their bombs and
machine-gunned the decks. The
bombs of the first sent / Up
spouts of water alongside the
destroyer, again straddling it;
but, as the second began to
climb again, a burst of flame
shot up from the destroyer.
The success of the Jap
plane, however, was not one-
sided. As it zoomed upward
it appeared to pause, turn in
the air; then dived, and dis-
appeared in the ocean.
'Hooray!” shouted Hardy.
“Out of control; a lucky shot
must have killed the pilot. It s
only three to one, now.
He was not the only one to
cheer. Surprised at a sound
Dare looked aft. There was a
little group of men there, and
MacGillicuddy was with them


Apparently the men were
pleased with the Japanese re-
verse. Dare waved his arm to
MacGillicuddy, who shouted
that he was returning.
The destroyer was on hre.
Smoke was coming out of her
side and men were rushing
about her decks. 1 he remain-
ing one of the two planes that
had just struck swept across
the destroyer again. It drop-
ped no bomb; but its machine
guns rattled. The men went
flat to the decks.
Then, a surprise, instead oi
returning, the plane continued
to climb upward. It was sud-
denly pointed in the direction
where, high in the heavens, the
navy plane and the two Jap-
anese were engaged in a tense
dog fight. They were weaving
in and out, swerving, climbing
for height, each of the oppon-
ents trying to secure a position
of advantage; the rattle of their
machine guns came down hol-
lowly from above, as it the
heavens were indeed a vault.

was by no means over, though
•it had its victories.
MacGillicuddy suddenly ap-
peared. He had other men,


armed, with him; and Pip was
amongst them.
“1 relieved young lom from
the engine room guard, he
said. He was young the
job, but he did splendidly.”
Dare noticed that Pip was
white and seemed shaken, and
he put his arm across his
shoulder, sympathetically.^
“Yes; Schwartz, who s a
Hun, organised the men down
there to make an attack; and
Tom had to shoot. They tried
to intimidate him, but he shot
as he was told. Good lad!
Schwartz is dead, and the oth-
ers cowed. As for the rest?
it’s all under control. A good
number of the men, when the
situation was put to them, were
glad to join forces with us as
a means of making their peace
with the authorities. That
mine-laying didn t make Snaith
popular. We ve # got the
rest under guard and locked
up. There’s only the bridge
now. But Ive got men on the
truck of the back mast with
tommy guns. They can sweep
the boat deck and command
the open ends of the bridge.
Tve told them to shoot anyone
who shows himself.
He walked forward, shouted
to Snaith, and hearing a re-
sponse, shouted details of how
he had the bridge covered.
“You’d better surrender.


Captain Snalth,” he said.
“Come down with your hands
up and my men won t shoot
you. ~
“You go to the devil,
Snaith roared back. “Your
blessed destroyer is on fire and
will be sunk directly the Japs
have destroyed its plane. We
can get more planes still. And
don’t forget this, there will be
Japanese warships here soon,
i ll get this vessel back, and
every man jack who helped
you will be handed over to
the Japs. I’ll see you tortur-
ed, MacGillicuddy. 1 asaki
has promised that. And those
two boys with you.
“Have a look your bless-
Ed navy plane has gone now!
he added exaltingly.
Something certainly had
happened to the plane. T here
was a flash and it lost height,
suddenly righted, shot forward
flying fast and straight at the
second Jap. plane, which tried
to avoid a collision, but too
late. There was smoke and
flare as the two aircraft met,,
then both appeared to fall to
pieces.
The cheer that followed the
gallant action was increased
by another as the sun caught
the white'of the opening para-
chutes. They had fallen half-
way to the sea perhaps, before
the pilot of one of the Jap


planes noticed what was hap-
pening. It took a wide curve
and came straight at the para-
chutes, guns blazing. But the
shooting was inaccurate and
the parachutes and men con-
tinued to fall. The Jap plane
banked for a return.
On the destroyer the predi-
cament of its airmen had been
observed. Good use had been
made of the breathing spell;
and though there was a black-
ened hole on the destroyer s
deck abaft of midships, only
a wisp of smoke now rose from
it. The destroyer, in fact, had
seemed about to draw level
with the Amirale Levante, but
veered its course in the direc-
tion of the falling parachutes
* More plane he come. See!
It was the voice of one of M ac-
Gillicuddy’s new men, and.
follotwing the line of his point
ing finger, a small speck in
the distant sky could be seen
Evidently the other planes
Snaith had threatened were on
their way. And now the jap
plane that had attacked the
parachutes was returning to the
attack, and the plane that had
hovered overhead in the early
stages of the attack now zoom
ed down in an attempt to
bomb the destroyer.
The guns of the vessel blaz-
ed as the aircraft passed; but
the fight was still desperate.


CHAPTER XI. —FORTUNES OF WAR.
np HE stick of bombs missed
again, but pillars of water
shot up beside the destroyer.
“If we had charge of the
bridge we could pick up those
men ourselves, said MacGilli-
cuddy. "1 wish we could take
it. . , ,
“What about the fanlight
In Tasaki’s cabin, suggested
Pip. “Going through that way
we could get behind the bridge
without being seen.
He had learnt from Dare the
situation that had developed,
and his idea was an inspira-
tion. forgetting the fight in
which so much depended Mac-
Gillicuddy went with Dare and
Pip to Tasaki’s cabin and ap-
proved the plan Pip had sug-
gested, and Dare immediately
elaborated.
With the aid of the men the
chief engineer called, a short
ladder and sharp knives, the
tarpaulin was quickly cut
adrift from the fanlight. Fully
opened, it was easy for men to
climb through onto the boat
deck.
Hardy came in with news.
“Mr. MacGillicuddy, sir,
them airmen have been picked


up; but the destroyer’s been hit
again, sir. Them Jap planes
are still attackin .
“Were workin out our
own salvation; we re goin’ to
attack the bridge,’’ said Mac-
Gillicuddy.
“Blime, can 1 be in on this,
sir?” Hardy asked, eagerly.
McGillicuddy included him
in the party he chose. His plans
were made qulckl}'. A party
armed with sub-machine guns
marshalled quietly on the boat
deck.
“Let them have it, boys,”
commanded the chief engin-
eer, sharply.
The bullets from bursts
from two machine guns thud-
ded into the bridge house.
Curses, groans and cries show-
ed that, at close range, the
bullets had penetrated.
“Now, Snaith, come out
and surrender,” called Mac-
Gillicuddy, sternly. “At close
range 1 can perforate the wall
that protects you and shoot
your men behind it.
“I’ll see you damned before
I give in, MacGillicuddy, you
traitor. Buccaneer Bill roared.
“Well, let those who don't
want to be killed come out
and surrender,” MacGillicuddy
urged.
“No man s going to leave
here,” said Snaith. “If we die
we die together. You don’t

win, anyway. 1 can cause the
whole ship to blow up, with
the pressure of a button. And,
anyway, there are more planes
coming. You can see them..’
“If you look now, Snaith,
you will see that there is only
one extra plane; and that s a
British plane or Australian.
Only one plane, but it was
prepared, when it received the
call, to come out against five
—or a dozen. That s British,
Snaith! And if you look,
Snaith, you’ll see that the Japs
don t like the look of it.
I hey’re off for their lives. And
our plane is after them. Listen
to the men —they were your
men this morning, Snaith
cheering.
If Snaith had looked, he
would have seen, too, that tht
destroyer had come round o?
its course again and was
very close to the Amirale
Levante.
“lt are lies!” The voice was
that of the wireless operator,
vibrant with anger. “Japanese
planes honorably and with
most wonderful courage ex-
pended their bombs and their
ammunition; now they only go
quickly to get more.”
“As you say. Sparks, they
go quickly too damnec
quickly,” Snaith commented,
hastily. “Your men can’t fight
—not when matched with Bri


tish fighters, on anything like
level terms. 1 wish 1 d never
been mixed up with the brown
scum. - iij
The voices were loud, and
sharp on Snaith s taunting
words, came the sound of a
slap and the captain’s bellow-
ed angry profanity.
“that for the insult!
Tasaki cried. 1. a Japanese,
will show, you I die rather than
surrender. 1 die because I fail.
For a moment he came into
the view of those below. Then
they saw him dive over the
S shouted:
“Snaith, my men are going to
fire again. Will you surrend-
er ?
“Yes; 1 surrender, Snaith
said sullenly. “We re coming
out, hands up. Much good it
will do you, though, when this
ship blows up under you.’
*❖* ' *
“It was as quickly as that
that it happened, said the
man who had been known as
MacGlllicuddy. “Twenty min-
utes before, matters, one way
and another, looked pretty
black for us; and then, in a
minute, it was finished. 1
wasn’t worried about what
Snaith said about blowing up
the ship; I knew he was always
a braggart. We marshalled
them one by one below. 1 was


thinking in my mind what an
inglorious end it was for a man
who had swaggered and biag-
U ed like Buccaneer Bill. when,
with a sudden dash am a
spring he vaulted overside. It
a )ap can show the way to die
quickly 1 can do it, too, he
said in a brief pause. 1 hen he
was gone. A 7„.
“We got the boat down,
but 1 wasn’t sorry that they
could not find him” . ■ -v .
When , an officer from the
destroyer with a troop of blue-
jackets behind him »-
aboard, he had given a forma
salute to MacGillicuddy; but
then his hand went out warm-
]y and he exclaimed: Why,
Bill —Captain Bill Lambert!
What Have you been I
tm “Tve been a drunken Scots
engineer with a burr in my
speech as thick as soup and
whisky soaked into my clothe,
to help me in an act as a sot
who emptied bottles all d .
long.” ,
“You can stand up to a lo
of it. anyway, old son. said
Lieutenant Chalmers.
“But this time 1 was suppos-
ed to go right out to it. so that
they could search my pock .
with impunity, and blab all
sorts of secrets in my presence
without fear of my noticing. A
useful disguise. Chalmers.


So by the time Dare and Pip,
by invitation, sat in the cap-
tain’s cabin, where Lambert
spoke with Chalmers, they
knew the former was a man
with a high awe-inspiring re-
cord on secret service work,
who had now added a new
performance to that record.
**| want you to meet rny
voung assistants, Chalmers,
said Lambert. “Splendid boys!
They stirred the best of the
men to feeling mean about
helping the Japs against decent
races. They inspired me, too.
1 was puzzling out how to work
matters so that when gave
you the call to step m 1 could
prevent the evidence 1 wanted
to hand over to you from be-
ing destroyed. They showed
me the way out; and they
were as brave as young lions
in the help they gave me. We 11
get them into the navy, Chalm-
ers; they want to join, and with
the start they’ve made, they 11
get on quickly.”
Dave and Pip glowed plea-
surably under the tribute; but
they were curious.
“So it was you, Captain
Lambert, who sent those mes-
sages overboard ?
He laughed. .
‘‘lf Snaith and his Jap friend
had applied a certain chemical
to those slips of paper they
would have found a lot more


on them than simple remarks
about latitude and longitude.
That’s why those notes were
there in case they were
found by the wrong people, as
a couple were. If there had
been blank sheets ol paper
some suspicions would have
been aroused and experiments
might have been made, i wrote
them with my left hand. It
gives a style of writing quite
different from my right.
“And all those weapons, and
the ammunition ? asked 1 ip '
“Don’t ask me why Snaith
stored them in a place with a
ventilator. Perhaps that corn-
er was used as a prison at one
time, and the ventilator was
necessary to keep the inmates
alive; then Snaith found it
handy as a store for weapons.
He used to boast about the
money to he made supplying
arms to the underworld and
enemy agents; and he bragged
that he had a gold mine of
weapons. So, pottering about
in a drunken way, 1 located a
heavily bolted and locked
room, and connected that
ventildtor shaft with it. That
was another ot the charges
against Buccaneer Bill - ille-
gal traffic in weapons.
” * * * *
great day it was lor
Corangl when Dare and Pip
came home. Ihe whole district


was on the railway station as
the boys stepped out of the
train with a tall man who, al-
though in civilian clothes, they
called Captain Lambert; and
fickle by reason of his close
mateship and being able to hail
Dare and Pip as his cobbers,
felt himself the centre of the
proceedings. There had been
a good deal in the papers
about Dare and Pip, very
vague as to detail, but making
it clear that those boys had
been thanked for gallant ser-
vice; and 1 ickle felt that what
he called the nolley prosy-
que-ey” entered in the case of
a man who had been shot in
the Old Tower was something
in the nature of an honour.
Military activity about the
Old Tower had attracted cur-
iosity and rumours had spread
in spite of ofhcia] secrecy. The
people of Corangi, as a conse-
quence, were proud of the
knowledge that two of their
boys had been responsible for
the death of a dangerous
enemy agent who had a wire-
less station, small but power-
ful, in the cellar of the Tower
and had, it was asserted, sup-
plied marauding Japanese sub-
marines with information.
But there was something for
Dare that he hadn't expected.
Mrs. Vindm (Pips mother;


by the \f.uTam P "" tinS
Mr. Vindin was his stepfather)
after she had recovered from
the ecstasy of welcoming her
own son, whispered it to Dare.
“If you had been her own
son. Dare. Mrs. Tarrant
couldn’t have been more con-
cerned. It wasn’t because you
were a hero; before that came
out she was standing up tor
you. She seems a ha>sh
woman. Dare, but she loves
THE
you. And old Joe showed a lot
of feeling, too.
They were there to welcome
him and Dare had been sur-
prised at their greeting. He was
glad to know they were not
merely claiming a hero.
It is fine for a young fellow,
instead of being alone in the
world, to know that ther; are
people who have a particular
care for him.
