Journal of his Expedition across the Centre of Australia , from Spencer
Gulf on the South to Latitude 18� 47' on the North. By J. McDouall
Stuart.
Communicated by Messrs. Chambers and Fxnke, through Sir R. I. Murchison,
VICE-PRES. R.G.S.
[The paper will be printed in the Journal.]
From the Journal of Mr. Stuart it appears that he left Chambers
Creek, in South Australia, at the beginning of March last year, with
Mr. Keckwick and one other man, and proceeded in a north-westerly
direction, his object being to penetrate across the continent. As
he proceeded, instead of meeting with an arid desert, as geologists
had predicted, he found a well-watered country, with numerous
creeks, several rivers, abundance of grass and scrub. The geo-
logical character of the country for the first 400 miles was tertiary
and secondary, and occasionally he saw large masses of sandstone.
He then crossed a high primary range, and for the remainder of his
advance met with little else than the older rocks, or those of vol-
canic formation. He proceeded without meeting with any serious
obstacle, and without encountering any of the natives, until he
reached the centre of Australia. There he erected a pile of stones,
planted the British flag, and enclosed within the pile a bottle con-
taining a paper with a notice of the fact. This occurred on the
16th of June. On his progress north-west his difficulties commenced.
The scrub was in places impenetrable, and ho was obliged to make
his route more easterly towards the Gulf of Carpentaria. Water
became scarce, and the soil sandy. The vegetation hitherto met
with had been principally scrub and gum-trees, but on approaching
the central regions ho saw palm-trees. Water was procured at a
short distance under ground, but there was none on the surface.


56 M'DOUALL STUART?S EXPEDITION : [J AN . U, 1861.
The country Mr. Stuart had passed through, after the first or
M?Donnell range, had been undulatory or flat; hut on advancing
north he came to ranges of mountainous hills, the principal of which
he called the Murchison range ; and from these hills the rivers that
flow north-west and north-east take their rise. Looking from an
eminence towards the west he saw a high mountain and elevated
ground. The valleys between the ranges of hills were fertile; and
one river, which was flowing towards the north by west, was about
ten chains wide, and had the appearance of being a constant stream.
This he conceived to he the character of many of the creeks and
springs that he came to. On looking towards the east there were
indications in the atmosphere of the presence of a large body of
water behind the high land which bounded the horizon in that
direction. Until he reached the range of hills he had not seen
many natives, though numerous traces of them were frequently
observed ; hut they then began to show themselves, and made
hostile signs. Two of them were first seen near the scrub, hut as
soon as Mr, Stuart approached they ran away. A few days after-
wards they appeared in greater numbers, and, with menaces, made
signs to his party to go back. It was in vain that Mr. Stuart made
friendly demonstrations; and at last the natives threw a shower of
boomerangs at him. His men were ordered to load their guns, and
as the savages approached nearer for the purpose of surrounding
the little party, they were compelled to fire. The savages did not
desist from their attacks, and a second volley was fired at them.
Under these circumstances Mr. Stuart, with great reluctance, felt
obliged to retrace his steps. He returned to the point he started
fiom on the 9th of September, after having travelled upwards of
2300 miles in six months and two days, and having penetrated within
250 miles south-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The geological
character of the mountainous ranges was igneous, the appearance of
quaitz and othei granitic rocks giving evidence of the presence of
metallic treasures. Only one portion of the route, for the distance
of about 60 miles, was sterile and sandy.
The President said, of the various subjects that had been brought before
the Society, he knew of none which exceeded in importance the one they
weie about to discuss. Explorations in Africa, or in any other part of the
globe, were interesting to us as citizens of the world, but the present explora-
tion was interesting to us, not only as citizens of the world, but more espe-
cially as citizens of tins great country. We might take pride in the fact that
a discovery had been made, not at the expense of the Government, but of two
or tkre� ot our fellow-citizens; who, not daunted by a succession of disasters
and failures, had not shrunk from supplying the necessary funds, and they
further had the judgment to secure the proper man, to whose abilities, energy,
and perseverance, was owing the success of the expedition. And so great was


Mr. Stuart?s energy that he had gone forth again with a larger party, with
strength sufficient to daunt the natives, and to overcome any of those impedi-
ments which had been the cause of his returning on the last occasion. There
was one curious circumstance : it was that an old chief, accompanied by two
sons, made a freemason?s sign to Mr. Stuart; and -on Mr. Stuart looking
intently at him he repeated the sign, and showed great satisfaction when it
was answered.
Sir Roderick Murchison, f.r.g.s., said he had always taken a special
interest in the exploration of Australia, and had lost no opportunity of stimu-
lating those researches, which had terminated in this most glorious expedition
of Mr. Stuart. The exploration, though carried out by private individuals,
had been warmly encouraged by the Governor of the colony, Sir Richard
M?Donnell. Gentlemen would recollect that a very expensive expedition
had been sent out, with twenty camels, from Melbourne, to accomplish the
same end from another point. In the mean time Mr. Stuart, with his two
men and thirteen horses, had accomplished more than the efforts of all other
explorers in that direction. Ever since he (Sir R.) had been connected with the
Society he had had at heart the establishment of some colony in one of the
great hays on the north of Australia, either in the Gulf of Carpentaria, or
more particularly in Cambridge Gulf, or near the mouth of the Victoria River,
where Gregory?s expedition was so long encamped.
He was now about to make an apology for a theoretical opinion he had
formed as to the difficulty of traversing this continent; and he might explain
why he, in common with other eminent geographers, had entertained great
doubts upon the feasibility of this enterprise. When Mr. Gregory arrived at
the extreme point of his expedition from the north, he was stopped by a
completely saline desert. Again, when Captain Sturt advanced into the centre
from the south, he also was stopped by an impenetrable saline desert. With
these facts before, them, it was not unreasonable to arrive at the conclusion
that the interior consisted of desert. Yet this Stuart, who was one of Sturt?s
men, devised for himself the route which he had taken, and which he had
so successfully followed. The discovery might he of very great importance
to this country, because, with the establishment of a port of refuge or a
colony on the north coast, it would give us a ready access to the Eastern
Archipelago, and also enable us to lay down a telegraph for communication
right across the continent with all our great colonies in the south and west
of Australia. Sir Richard M?Donnell proposed that the whole of the interior
in question should form a part of the colony of South Australia. He could not
sit down without acknowledging the high credit that was due to Colonel
Gawler, formerly Governor of South Australia, who, in spite of the reasoning
of others, and in spite of adverse appearances, had always maintained that a
passage could be accomplished.
Colonel Gawler, f.r.g.s., complimented Sir Roderick Murchison upon
his candour in acknowledging that he had altered, to a certain extent, his
former opinion. It was like men of true science, who, when realities came
before them, grasped them at once, notwithstanding their own anticipations.
They had stood opposed, but it was an amicable suit, and at last Mr. Stuart
had settled the question. He (Col. Gawler) rejoiced in the result, not because
it proved that his anticipations were correct, but on account of two circumstances
which had been often referred to. In the first place, it showed that Great Britain
possessed in Australia not only capabilities for a fringe of'colonies with some
twenty or thirty millions of inhabitants along the shores of that continent,
but capabilities for a great and compact empire, which might possibly contain
a hundred millions of souls. A perusal of Mr. Stuart?s narrative satisfied
him that, from Chambers Creek to the end of the flat-topped hills near to
the James and M?Donnell ranges, there was a very beautiful country for


Australia. In the Adelaide district, the proportion of good to inferior land
was about one-third; and he thought the same proportion would he found to
prevail in this newly-discovered territory. The M?Donnell range was mani-
festly the great dividing barrier between the waters of Northern and Southern
Australia; and, as Mr, Stuart observed that the streams south of that range
flowed in an easterly and southerly direction, it left the water system of
Western Australia a greater mystery than ever. He quite expected that
a large portion of the drainage of Western Australia went down into Lake
Torrens, but it was now quite evident that it did not take that course. In
the next place, he conceived there would be no difficulty in running a line of
railway to the northern coast, except over the M'Donnell range; for on the
other side of the range there were the immense plains where Mr. Stuart was
turned back. These plains extended, apparently, up to the Eed Sand, which
stopped Mr. Gregory from the Sturt Creek. But on them there was a large
number of gum-trees, and the gum-tree would never grow without moisture ;
and, though there might be no surface water, yet it was evident there must be
a large amount of water below the surface. Therefore he saw no reason why a
line of communication should not at once.be carried across from the south-
eastern coast to a north-western colony, and thus open an outlet for the
produce of the continent, to be shipped to the rich neighbouring islands and
the southern parts of Asia.
Mr. C. Bonney said he could bear testimony to the energy, courage, and
endurance that must have been required to accomplish the journey undertaken
by Mr. Stuart. He had recently returned from Australia, and five months
ago was within a few hundred miles of the centre of that continent. It was
then the cool season, but even at that time travelling was a work of great diffi-
culty from the almost entire absence of water and grass for horses. He could,
therefore, well appreciate the merit due to Mr, Stuart and to Messrs. Chambers
and Finke, who had fitted out the expedition. But with regard to the result of
the journey, it must not be too hastily concluded, that because Mr. Stuart had
been able to cross from south to north, therefore the whole interior of Australia
was a good and habitable country. His own impression still remained the
same, that the great bulk of Australia was uninhabitable. There was no
country more likely to deceive the traveller from the different aspect which
it bore under different circumstances. A traveller going through the country
after rain would be led to the conclusion that he saw before him a fertile
country; but if he went a few months afterwards, he would find nothing but
a sterile desert, altogether unfit for the habitation of man.
He had that day received a letter from Captain Sturt, the well-known
Australian explorer, from which, with the permission of the President, he
would read an extract.
He rejoiced, however, to think that at last a practicable route had been
discovered from south to north, which might be made available for the electric
telegraph and railway communication,
? I am not at all surprised at Stuart?s success, for I know him to be a
plucky little fellow ?cool, persevering, and intelligent, as well as an excellent
bushman; so that when 1 heard that he had gained such a footing in the
interior on his first excursion, I felt sure he would succeed in crossing the
continent sooner or later. He is entitled to all praise for his exertions ; and
it is really a matter of pride to me that it has fallen on one of my oldest
and best followers to have achieved so very creditable an enterprise, and to
have shown so much energy and zeal. He has fairly passed, or I should say
surpassed, me, and may justly claim the laurels.
?Now with regard to his journey, and the character of the country he tra-
versed, as far as I can judge from his letter to Chambers, I am really sur-
prised that he did not cross any desert such as he and I traversed together.


He states that he crossed a plain of red sand with spinifex of about 60 miles
in breadth, on which, I presume, there was no water; and this tract I should
be disposed to call desert, though of limited extent; but I took it for granted
that as Gregory, in lat. 20� and in long, 127�, found precisely the same kind
of country as that from which I was forced to retreat in lat. 24� and in long,
138�, so the intervening country would be the same.
? Gregory found the creeks by which he descended from the hills to the south
underwent exactly the same changes as those by which I had advanced towards
the north?that is to say, that they gradually lost their current, assumed, the
character of a chain of ponds, and were ultimately lost amidst sandy ridges.
Having myself penetrated at least 400 miles into the desert, I could not have
imagined that it would so soon change its features to take them up again at
a distance of 700 miles, that being about the distance between Gregory?s posi-
tion and my own.
?I believe Stuart started with the intention of making Cambridge Gulf on
the west coast, hut that, not being able to push to the westward, he ran up
north, and passed about midway between Gregory and myself, and as near as
could he the centre of the continent, and, being forced to the eastward of north,
at last succeeded in gaining the southern fall of water, in lat. 19� 47' and in
long, 134�, which would he a point about 280 or 300 miles from the Gulf of
Carpentaria in a n.e. direction, about 380 miles from me in a s.s.e, direction,
and about the same distance from Gregory in a direction of w. s. Stuart?s
course must therefore have been to the eastward of the point from which he
started, the nature of the country being such as to prevent his going to the
west of it. Now if you refer to the Introduction to my Central Expeditions
you will find that one reason I gave for taking the line I did was, that from
observations I had made of the migration of birds on the banks of the
Darling and in South Australia, I had been led to hope that about lat. 20�
and long. 134� a better country would be found, because I calculated that the
two lines of migration would meet, the one n.w. from the Darling, the other
due s. from the shores of St. Vincent?s Gulf, about where I have pointed out;
and there, it would now appear, Stuart has discovered a better country, and
added another proof to the many that have been recorded of the truth of these
natural indications.
? Had Gregory found it practicable to keep more to the south, when crossing
from the Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria, he would probably have struck
the heads of the creek from which Stuart retreated ; but he was forced to the
north by the sandy and sterile nature of the - table-land on which he travelled,
and could never get a glimpse of the depressed southern interior. I take
it that the country Stuart has discovered is far to the south and west of
Gregory?s track. Van Diemen and Arnheim Lands must at one time have
been an island, as the whole continent was once an archipelago ; and it was
the conviction on my mind as to this fact that led me to hope Gregory would
be able to descend at different points of his passage across the northern portion
of the continent by streams, the opposites to those debouching on the coast, of
which there are so many; but from the account he gave of the appearance of
the country to the south of him, I was led to apprehend that the desert came
right up to where he was, and that vast masses of sand having been deposited
on the southern slopes of the hills imbibed all the water, and thus rendered a
descent to the south impossible.
?It is worthy of observation, that whereas I found the sand-hills running
n. and s, nearly, Gregory, at a distance of 700 miles to the w.n.w., found
them running B. and w. nearly, and that too at a difference of elevation of
between six and seven hundred feet.?
Col, Sykes, f.r.g.s., said he should not have risen but for what had fallen
from the last speaker, whose observations would seem to modify the expecta-

tions Held out by Mr, Stuart, of the country being habitable and suitable for
colonization. An extensive and impenetrable scrub was found flourishing in
the tract, therefore there must necessarily be a supply of moisture to enable
the scrub to grow. Whether the water was uncler or over the surface was
another question, but there must be moisture to a great extent. Again, phy-
sical geographers were aware that the world was surrounded by a belt to
the north and to the south of the equator which was subject to annual supplies
of water both during the south-west and the north-east monsoons. The greater
portion of Australia traversed by Mr. Stuart lay within that parallel, and it
was therefore natural to assume that it came under the same physical condi-
tions as other parts of the earth as to supply of moisture. This probable fact
would remove the impression that might have been produced upon the minds
of the audience by what had just been said.
Lord Alfred Churchill, f.r.g.s., stated that he had received a letter by
the last mail from Sir Charles Nicholson, which bore out the observations of
Sir Roderick Murchison relative to the capabilities for the formation of a
colony in the northern part of Australia. The discovery of Mr. Stuart was
likely to effect very great consequences to the future of Australia, because
according to the present means of connecting Sydney and Melbourne with
India, a very long and dangerous voyage was necessary. Now, if it was pos-
sible to form a new colony at the north of the continent, the establishment of
telegraphs and railroads, to which he saw no physical objection, would be of very
great value to the south by opening up a direct communication with it. With
regard to hot winds, at Melbourne they came from the north, and at Sydney
from the north-west; and the theory had been formed that those hot winds
were caused by passing over a desert tract in the centre of Australia. That
had been proved by Mr. Stuart not to be correct as regarded the whole of the
interior. Possibly there might be desert on both sides of the region he tra-
versed. However, so far as he had gone he had discovered a fine country,
which, from its peculiar formation and peculiar vegetation, might afford or
would afford facilities for intercourse between the northern and southern parts
of the continent.
Count Strzeleoki, f.r.g.s., reminded the meeting that in 1858 he was
selected by Sir Roderick Murchison to transmit to Mr. Stuart the first token of the
Society?s approval of his exertions in exploring the north at his own expense ;
and having on that occasion expressed his belief that this acknowledgment
would stimulate Mr. Stuart to further exertion, he was extremely happy now
to find that his expectations had been more than realised. Mr. Stuart had
cleared up the mystery which for so long a time had hung over the centre of
Australia. After reviewing the various theories which had been propounded
based upon the observations of previous travellers, Count Strzelecki said that
he was at one time himself of opinion that the interior was a vast desert.
He was ready now to recant that view, to acknowledge the value of the dis-
covery which Mr. Stuart had made, and to render full justice to those, less
successful, who preceded Mr. Stuart in his enterprise.
The Noble President, in closing the discussion, said, this no doubt was a
most important point in the history of Australia; and both that country as
well as our own must feel deeply indebted to the individuals who had either
contributed the means, or through whose gallantry and energy the exploration
had been so successfully carried out.
