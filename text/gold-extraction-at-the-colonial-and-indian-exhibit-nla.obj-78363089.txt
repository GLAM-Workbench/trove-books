QUEENSLAND GOLD QUARTZ
CRUSHING MILL.


GOLD EXTRACTION
AT THE
COLONIAL AND INDIAN EXHIBITION,
SOUTH KENSINGTON.
The gold quartz crushing machinery, consisting of a five-head
battery, specially manufactured by Messrs. John Walker &
Company, Limited, of Maryborough, Queensland, has been erected
on the South Promenade for the Queensland Commission, by
Mr. J. N. Longden, their Mining Engineer, and will be worked
for about 2 hours from 3.30 p.m. on each day for the remainder
of the Exhibition season, under his supervision. Mr. Longden
has had practical experience for a number of years on the
Queensland gold fields.
The stamps are of the usual gravitation type, weighing 800 lb.
each, having a drop of nine inches and striking eighty blows per
minute. Five hundred gallons of water are used per hour during
the operations.
The gold ore intended to be crushed is first broken into small
pieces and then fed into the battery through a hopper. From
thence it passes under the stamps, and being crushed is carried by
means of a stream of water through gratings of 240 holes to the
square inch over a series of mercurialised copper plates, and through
two centre-board wells over four ripples. From the tables it is
carried by the water over a concentrator of the percussion pattern.
The concentrated pyrites are fed into a? boss ? grinding pan, and
delivered thence into two Berdan grinding and amalgamating pans,
the pulp from which enters a seven foot settler pan, which is the
finishing part of the operation.
Mercury is used throughout the whole process as the amalga-
mating agent. Sodium, the invention of Professor Crookes, F.R.S.,
being employed at regular intervals for quickening the action of
the mercury and preventing its ? flouring.?
Gold quartz mills in Queensland run continuously for the 24
hours of the six working days of the week, or a total of 144 hours
per week. The working power of the five-head mill now on view at
the Exhibition, is half a ton of quartz per hour, its weekly work
would therefore be 72 tons. As a general rule the mills in Queens-
land are ? washed up ? once a fortnight, i.e., the whole amalgam
from each of the machines and pans forming the process is collected
together, cleaned and placed in a retort, the mercury being
distilled leaves the gold in the bottom of the retort in the form of a
cake, known as ? retorted gold.? The cake of ? gold ?is
subsequently broken up, put into a crucible and smelted into gold
bars and sold to the banks. The distilled mercury from the
retort is continuously re-used in the subsequent operations.


A real cake of ? retorted gold ? (not a model) from the ? Day
Dawn Block and Wyndham Gold Mining Company?s Mine,? at
Charters Towers, Queensland, weighing 1,707 oz., and of the
value of �5,923 sterling, is on view in the Queensland Court of
the Exhibition.
The Royal Commissioners of the Exhibition provide the water
and driving power for operating the mill; the engine, a single
cylinder 8-horse power, of the horizontal high-pressure type, is by
Messrs. Davey, Paxman & Co., of Colchester.
Parcels of gold ore from various Queensland Mines, aggregating
in all about 200 tons, will be crushed and treated during the
remainder of the exhibition season.
The gold fields represented will be Charters Towers, Gympie,
Ravenswood, Etheridge and the Palmer.
Parcels from the following mines are in course of transit to
this country, viz.: the ? Disraeli,? ? Day Dawn P. C.,? ? Day
Dawn Block and Wyndham,? ? Nos. 1 and 2 South-West Queen,?
from Charters Towers, and the ? Lady Franklin,? from the
Etheridge.
It remains to be said of the machinery, that it is not a mere
experimental model, but a full-sized working gold mill, in which
the whole of the processes from the crushing of the rough bulk ore
to the production of the solid bar of the precious metal will be
shown.
The old method of winning gold from alluvial earth by
means of the tub and cradle will be shown. Several tons of
auriferous ? wash dirt ? have been forwarded from the Calliope
Gold Field, Queensland, for that purpose. The greater part
of the gold won in the early days from the Australian and Cali-
fornian Fields was obtained by this method. The tub and cradle
will be Avorked from 10.30 a.m. daily.
Accommodation is provided on the ground floor and in the
gallery for about 100 Adsitors ; a display of samples of the gold
ores under treatment Avill be shoAvn in glass cases upon the gallery
front.
Maps of the Colony, plans of the chief gold fields?Charters
ToAvers, Gympie, RavensAvood and the Etheridge, sections of gold
lodes by Mr. Joseph Shakespeare, Government Mining Inspector,
photographs and paintings of mining camps, are arranged on the
Avails of the building. The DiAudend List from Charters ToAvers,
received by cable, is posted regularly.
Many persons haA r e visited the mill since Monday, June the
sth, Avhen the mill commenced running, and the interest manifested
in the operations indicates that the Queensland Gold Quartz Mill
and the Queensland ?digger,? Avith his tub and cradle, Avill prove
to be striking features of the Exhibition.
It may be mentioned that the Avoods used for supporting the
battery haA'e been brought from the Colony.
