Recollections of T. E. Brown
By EDWIN BEAN.
Twenty years ago a Brown Society existed in Melbourne and dedicated its collective
energy to the study of the Manx poet. Alfred Deakin was one of Brown’s admirers,
and paid eloquent tribute to his genius. Professor Murdoch attended several meetings
of this “small but vigorous society” and has charmingly reported one of Deakin’s
“inimitable speeches by which he unkindly reminds us, from time to time, of the heavy
loss Australian literature has suffered by his immersion in politics.” Brown had
many admirers in the colonies. The Rev. Edwin Bean was one of those who, like
W. E. Henley and Quiller-Couch, came either as fellow teachers or pupils under the
spell of Brown’s singularly engaging personality. After sitting under Brown at Clifton
College, Mr. Bean became a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, then Classics Master
at the Geelong Grammar School (where he coached the Fairbairns who later rowed for
Cambridge), and successively Classics Master at the Sydney Grammar School, Head-
master of All Saints’, Bathurst, and Headmaster of Brentwood Grammar School, England.
On his retirement from Brentwood he lived at Hobart until his death. His widow
still lives at Hobart, and Dr. J. W. Bean, of Brisbane, and Mr. C. E. W. Bean, the War
Historian, of Sydney, are his sons. The following notes are here published for the
first time:
I first saw T. E.
Brown about the
year 1864, when 1
was a boy of 1 3 at
Clifton College. He
had joined the small
staff of the young
school (then in its
third year of exist-
ence) as second
master, under John
Percival, later Bi-
shop of Hereford,
and was to have the
right of opening the
first boarding house
next to that of the
headmaster a pri-
vilege properly be-
longing to a prior
member of the staff,
Graham Dakyns, a
friend of Tenny-
son’s, which that un-
selfish and loyal ser-
vant of the School
had chivalrously
waived in favour of
the new comer.
The new mas-
ter at once impres-
sed us as a strong
man in every sense.
We had an awful
sense of his pow-
er and his keen
searching glance.
No boy ever ven-
tured to play tricks
or shirk at his
lessons. Even the
cloisters adjoining
his classroom were
trod on tiptoe, if it
was whispered that
old Brown was
there.” As to his
learning it was
known to be prodi-
gious—Greek, Latin,
Hebrew, Italian,
French, German,
T. E. BROWN.

Mathematics far beyond school boys’
ken, Chemistry, Botany he was
master of them all. There was
not a school subject which he could
no handle like a professor. And
then the way he taught! Every
subject was alive with human interest.
His genius placed you at once at the
heart of it. The term after he came
1 was placed in his form the Vth
which was reading the Electra of
Sophocles. Oh, the breathless excite-
ment of that description of the chariot
race! How we swung in the swaying,
bending chariots as they rounded and
grazed the meta! ’ How we gasped
at the crash of the colliding cars!
How the boy artists of the form busied
themselves in playhours to depict the
drivers leaning over their horses in the
headlong gallop! And then would
come the Latin lesson when he made
us feel the scorn in Cicero’s voice as he
thundered forth his Philippic against
Antony. We could feel the hushed
wonder of the august Senate, as the
great assembly listened to those roll-
ing periods. For the great teacher had
the power to stir the wonder that lies
ready and responsive in the hearts of
youth. Never shall I forget the way
in which he taught us to look on poets
as the crown of the human race. It
came upon us like a revelation.
Soldiers, of course, we worshipped:
statesmen we could admire: heroes
and martyrs stirred our enthusiasm.
But poets! unpractical rhymesters we
had thought them. And then, to find
that our Master placed them first
the choice spirits of humanity! It set
us wondering indeed and there were
not a few who turned to the study of
the Elizabethans with a new zest—
determined to unlock those dusty
caskets and gaze on the hidden jewels.
Little did we suspect that the man
himself was rich in poetry—for he
never read a line of his poems to us
boys, nor were they given to the world
till long after my school career was
ended. But he encouraged us to
cultivate any gift of verse we might

possess, and the school which has]
produced the fire of Newbolt, and the
polished lines of Warren, owes not c
little to the prize which Brown estab-
lished for English verse.
As might be expected, there was ai
almost Shakesperian vein of humou
in his teaching. This came out oftei
in his lessons on history. I remembe
one vivid touch in a lecture on Trad<
in the 16th century, when he de-
scribed the hardy English seaman
steering his twenty-ton barque through
the ice-cold fogs to round the North
Cape, “holding the tiller with one
hand, and his nose with the other.”
This same humour made him sym-
pathetic with boys. He could adapt
his language to their ideas, and often
addressed them in their own crude
fashion. Thus when he wanted to
stir up the esprit de corps of his own
house boys by rivalry with those of
other houses, he put it in the daring
expression, “Hate School House.” He
knew well that they would not mis-
understand him; it was, as the Harrow
School song says, “hating the foe with
a playing at hate.” Akin to this was
his principle of allotting studies in the
house. If I know that two boys hate
each other, I put them in the same
study. They fight and become
friends.” “Brown’s House” was al-
ways distinguished for its spartan
hardihood and robust common sense.
Though never possessing more than
forty boarders it not unfrequently led
the School in athletics, and beat other
houses of twice its numbers.
The School always looked forward
to his sermons. Though he never des-
cended to schoolboy slang, there was
a raciness and a poetic imagery that
held the attention of even the
youngest. When he preached, which
was seldom, the subjects were always
simple, and inculcated practical good-
ness.
1 have said that we boys had a dim
idea that Brown was far greater than
the ordinary measure of a school
master. We knew that he was a Eel-


MY GARDEN.
INDWELLING.
A garden is a lonesome thing, God wot!
Rose plot,
Fringed pool.
If thou couldst empty all thyself of self,
Like to a shell dishabited.
Then might He find thee on the ocean
shelf.
And say —“This is not dead”- —
Ferned grot —
The veriest school
And fill thee with Himself instead.
Of peace; and yet the fool
But thou art all replete with very thou,
Contends that God is not —
And hast such shrewd activity,
Not God! In gardens! when the eve is
That, when He comes, He says: —“This

Unto itself —’Twere better let it be:
Nay, but I have a sign;
It is so small and full, there is no room
’Tis very sure God walks in mine.

low of Oriel—the college compeer
of Newman, K.eble and Arnold.
Rumours reached us that he presided
over the Philosophical Society of
Bristol: that he was a master of the
organ, and lectured to professional
musicians on the history of their art:
that he had written many of the
articles in Smith’s great Bible Diction-
ary. Tales came, too, of his love of
the sea. Boys who had been to the
Isle of Man had seen “Old Brown”
hauling nets with the Douglas fisher-
men, or swimming off the Ramsay
shore. Others had met him climbing
the rocks of steep Barrule, with a
bunch of mountain flowers in his hand,
and there was a joy in his face and a
breeziness in his walk that made them
feel that “one touch of nature makes
the school world kin.”
Though he never betrayed it to us
by look or word, I know how that the
routine of school work was irksome
to him. His real life he lived in the
open air among his beloved Manx
folk. Duties at Clifton were duties —
to be performed conscientiously,
forcibly, manfully: but it was in com-
muning with simple brave and homely
souls or meditating on the beauties
and mysteries of Ood s works that his
great spirit found its true delight.
Verses from T. E. Brown
PRAESTO.
Expecting Him, my door was open wide:
Then I looked round
If any lack of service might be found,
And saw Him at my side:
How entered, by what secret stair,
I know not, knowing only He was there.

India’s Degradation
“When Miss Mayo says that the
whole pyramid of the Indian’s woes,
material and spiritual, rests upon a
rock-bottom physical base one would
more or less accept the statement, but
when she defines physical base as
‘simply his manner of getting into the
world and his sex-life thenceforward,’
she reveals, even to those not inclined
to be Freudian, an abnormal sex-com-
plex.”
Professor John J. Cornelius, for-
merly Professor of Philosophy at Luck-
now University, thus wrote oL Kath-
erine Mayo’s book Mother India. “As
a species of powerful anti-Indian pro-
paganda,” he has more than a sus-
picion that though the hand be that of
Katherine Mayo, the voice is that of
the British bureaucrat. Citing the
imprisonment of Ghandi, Lajpat Rai
“and a host of others,” many without
trial, during the last half century. Pro-
fessor Cornelius is strongly of opinion
that British policy has been to comb
India of independent thinkers with
powers of leadership in order to ex-
ploit the dumb and helpless masses.
“How can India make progress,” he
asks, “when her most promising sons
are so easily gotten rid of, and patriot-
ism is so mercilessly suppressed by an
alien government?” So far from
finding the cause of India’s political un-
rest in “sexual exhaustion,” as Miss
Mayo does, Professor Cornelius, re-
viewing in Current History the “bene-
fits” of British rule, discovers it in the
belief that the fate of India must hence-
forth be determined “by Indians and
not by aliens. India is now working
for the full control of the government,
and until that goal is reached political
unrest can never cease.’’
Professor Cornelius puts an unerring
finger on the cause of India’s national
deterioration. “Granted law and or-
der, roads and railways, schools and
hospitals,” he says. “But, when the
alien Government suppresses patriot-
ism, strangles leadership, hampers
social reform legislation, betrays the
people’s confidence, crushes indigenous
industries for selfish advantage, turns
the country into a source of supply for
raw materials, will you ask why phys-
ical degeneracy, social disintegration
and economic backwardness are so
much in evidence.”
“Subjection for a long time to a
foreign yoke is the most potent cause
of national deterioration,” observes
Sir John Seeley in The Expansion of
England, quoted by Professor Cor-
nelius. In a trenchant review he clear-
ly shows that the Government being
alien, lack the confidence of the people,
and the acceleration of self-government
is essential for the enhancement of
India’s social and economic progress.
Katherine Mayo’s grave apprehen-
sion of the Indianization of the Gov-
ernment is associated by Professor
Cornelius with the fact that “all sorts
of anti-Indian propaganda have be-
come inevitable since British vested
interests are opposed to India’s legit-
imate aspirations.”
Professor Cornelius uncompromis-
ingly condemns the book as dishonest,
misleading, provocative of ill-will and
calculated to produce hatred between
the peoples of India and those of
Great Britain and America.
