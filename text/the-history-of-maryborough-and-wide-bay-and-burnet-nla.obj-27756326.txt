PREFACE.
However much opinions may differ in general, most people
are agreed on one point, viz., that every town should have
its archives, records, or chronicles, preserved for the benefit
of coming generations. Till now, there has been no history
of -Maryborough compiled ; and, in undertaking such, the
ohor does so rather as a “ labor of love ” than with a view
to profit. In no way can the multitude possess a thorough
knowledge of the bygone past —with its strange events, its
energetic and adventurous pioneers who won by hardihood
and enterprise the land from the primitive savage tribes who
ruled this favoured spot from long forgotten time—
but through the medium of a work such as the present.
“ Advance, Maryborough ” is a mere hackneyed sentiment,
given as a toast at festive gatherings and social parties,
but we have come to accept it as indicative of progress.
Nevertheless, progress requires something more than after-
dinner speeches and bumpers of wine to help it along ; a
true put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel action with every man
(not one man only), doing Ins best for the general weal of the
community, is necessary. As may be expected, though
much has been left unsaid herein, much has been recorded,
and all errors and omissions will be remedied in the second
edition of this work which it is projected to publish.

THE
HISTORY OF MARYBOROUGH
WIDE BAY AND BURNETT DISTRICTS.
PART I.
Early Settlement —Pioneers and Colonization —Old
Maryborough.
open the volume of the past with reverence,
knowing that it holds “ the secrets of a
prison-house,” which has long contained
them. Many of our pioneers who first
beheld the land, and saw it was good for habitation or
pastoral purposes, now sleep the sleep of the just, or, if
there are a few yet left, there is ever a danger of their pass-
ing away, ere from their lips that information of actual
experiences, and which must make these records so
thoroughly interesting, can be obtained. Many of the
descendants of the early pioneers have apparently but a
vague and dim idea of past events, even in which they were
mixed up in their earliest age. These are a few of the
•difficulties which beset the would-be historian, and to which
an unwillingness to give information may be added. Still,
if Maryborough is to have a reliable history it is important
to obtain the best authenticated reports, but judicious
discrimination can alone prevent publication of irremediable
errors supplied by some who wish to unburthen their minds
of superfluous knowledge and valueless information.
Our early history of pioneer settlement is so intimately
associated with the exploration of its locality, that to com-
prehend what the Wide Bay District, with its mountain-fed
streams —the Mary and Burnett rivers—was in the early
fifties, it is necessary to state that in 1842 it was a veritable
terra incognita , owned by New South Wales. Whilst the
true explorers of the Wide Bay and Burnett districts were


undoubtedly the pastoralists and overlanders who brought
stock and took up unoccupied country here, the first real
exploring expedition northwards was under the auspices of
the New South Wales Government, and in May, 1842,
when Mr. Andrew Petrie and Mr. Henry Stuart Russell
were despatched from Brisbane in a small brig, to survey
and explore the northern rivers, and on the 17th May,
1842, they entered the river now known as the Mary,
which they so named in honour of Lady Mary Fitzroy,
and the Fitzroy River was also named from the wife of the
then Governor of New South Wales. A sad calamity
unfortunately occurred to this lady, who was killed at
Parramatta, through her carriage being overturned in 1849.
After Messrs. Petrie and Russell had made reports on their
expedition, Mr. Burnett was despatched in July, 1847, to
further examine the Wide Bay district, and it was by him
the district and the river, now known as the Burnett, was
named. Like those who had preceded him, Mr. Burnett’s
report was satisfactory, as it stated that, “ although Wide
Bay had an excellent harbor for coasters, and would in time-
become a place of great importance, it would never be able
to compete against Moreton Bay for harborage of ships of
large tonnage.” As soon, therefore, as it was publicly
known that the Mary River was navigable, and a large
fertile territory unoccupied, many intending settlers began
to go northwards, sheep and cattle stations were established,
and the first township founded on the run in 1848. The
founding, unlike that of large cities, was solemnized in a
very peaceful manner, and at what is now known as the
old township, the Gregories, Aldridges, Bales, Harwoods,
Dowzers, Furburs, Palmers, and other pioneers located. To
have seen even that settlement in its primitive days when
bark humpies were plentiful, and Aldridge’s the only hotel,
Mrs. Irwin’s the only store, and Milner’s the only baker’s,,
would have astonished some of our more fastidious brethren
and sistern of modern days. The old township commenced
amidst barbarism and savagery, when aborigines were
plentiful and hostilities frequent. Many a murder was done
and never discovered, and many a poor shepherd and hut-
keeper fell beneath the spears and tomahawks of blacks
whom he had trusted as friends, but who slew him for
revenge in consequence of the shooting of their friends by


Sergt. Walker and his troopers. Before leaving the record
of early exploration of these districts it may not be out of
place to state that Mr. A. C. Gregory, in 1856, undertook a
long exploring tour northward, and ended up at Brisbane
in the same year, and that he with Alan Cunningham, the
botanist, who made known the Darling Downs, were in the
Wide Bay country. Leichhardt, the explorer, also in 1845,
was on the Fitzroy River, en route from Cape York, and
may have been here also. But, without detracting in
the least from honours won by explorers, the credit of open-
ing up the country and making known its resources is
undoubtedly due to our pioneer settlers and pastoralists,
who have civilized and colonized the locality and rendered
it fit for location and habitation. In the perilous times of
1850 to 1860 it was imperative for the settler, however
humble, to carry firearms and be on his guard against
treacherous foes, and I believe I am not wrong in stating
that every acre of land in these districts was won from
aborigines by bloodshed and warfare, whilst in some
instances, poison played an important part. We are too
apt to regard the black race as treacherous, unscrupulous,
and vile, but what of the whites—those Christian,
enlightened, and educated races—who have taken their
females without scruple, and even purchased them for
purposes of lust ? Think you, that jealousy will not inflame
the breast of the coloured man as readily as his European
brother, and that he will stay his hand in the day of wrath ?
Not he ! It was in the year 1856 that all Maryborough—
the present Maryborough—designated the “ new township ”
—was just formed, when society was startled by the terrible
murder of Furbur and his son-in-law, Jas. Williamson. The
two men were timber-getters, and had been sawing in the
scrub, when, wearied with work, they had stopped operations
for the mid-day “spell’’and a smoke, when the blacks
swooped down on them and killed both. Fortunately, Mrs.
Furbur being in Sydney, escaped hurt and outrage. Still,
after this, murders by aboriginals were frequent, and both the
Ululah Reserve and “ Oonooraba,” as the ridge near it is
termed, were a favourite camping and fighting place with
the Wide Bay tribes, who held their annual borahs here,
and also contested many an old grievance with the myalls
of Fraser Island or the Dawson.


Probably, Maryborough, with its two townships, would
have gone on in the same groove of primitive and barbarous
colonization, but for the advent of some of the later
pioneers, who, imbued with a spirit of progress and enter-
prise, established sawmills at Tinana and Dundathu, cotton
plantations, maize culture, boiling-downs, and a host of
local industries, which rose and fell according as they were
fostered or discarded; and among pioneers of energetic stamp
may be named Wm. Henry Walsh, who, though termed
oftener than not plain “Bill ” by his associates, was, never-
theless, the representative for the district, and known in
Brisbane as the Hon. Wm. H. Walsh, M.L.C. Among
other pioneers were Messrs. Kent and Weinholt, who
succeeded Walsh at Degilbo, and exercised some influence
on the future of the locality. Kent Street takes its name
from the Kent family; and I hear on reliable report that
Mrs. Kent, who died about 1870, was buried in ground
adjacent to that on which the Melbourne Hotel, Wharf
Street, now stands. The Moreton Bros., of Wetheron,
were also pioneers, whilst the names of D. M‘Taggart, W.
Powell, Hugh Graham, R. Jones, Palmer, Lawless, Bid-
well, Uhr, and other settlers here recur to memory.
The excess of sheep and cattle over the demand caused the
squatters, who had formerly sent their stock to Melbourne
and Sydney markets at a loss, to give every facility to those
who established boiling-downs here. Thus, in 1850, Mr.
Uhr, who arrived with his wife and family, opened the first
works of the kind on the site of the present Botanical
Gardens ; whilst less ambitious yet successful efforts were
those of Messrs. Sims, Gibson, and White (R. H. D.
White, M.L.C.), of New South Wales, Messrs. Cran and
Tooth, a firm whose names are “household words” all
over Wide Bay, who, with enterprise worthy better support,
erected meat extract works on the Liebig system, and only
succumbed to adverse circumstances caused by the rise in
the price of cattle. Since then, as sugar growing has been in
the ascendant and saccharine products the rule rather than
the exception of these districts, Messrs. R. and A. Cran have
taken over the trade, which, in their hands, has proved a
great success. As may be expected with dense pine or
cedar scrubs extending for miles, timber getting was a
profitable occupation, and in 1859 large sawmills to utilise


the timber of the district were started at Dimdathu, by
Messrs. Gladville and Greathead, followed by Pettigrew and
Co., of Brisbane, whilst later on Mr. Percy Ramsay estab-
lished similar works at Mungarr. After his decease, these
passed into the hands by purchase of Messrs. Hyne and
Son, who yet hold this property, but have associated it with
their Maryborough mills and removed the machinery from
Mungarr. The names of Wilson and Hart as pioneers in
this industry are widely known. In those days the roads
were mere tracks made by bullock drivers or teamsters in
going from one place to another, but travellers attempting
to follow them too often got astray, and only found settle-
ment or habitations by means of some marked tree-line
leading through scrub and undergrowth to a bushman’s
camp, where a hearty welcome and refreshing can of tea
made amends for the discomforts of being lost. Most of
the timber cut in the cedar and pine scrubs was simply
rolled into the river, and the logs floated to the mills.
To those who live in modern times, where not so much
as a hair can remain out of place long, and the slightest
breach of decorum is condemned by those who study the
rules of fashion and propriety, the contemplation of life as
it w r as in those primitive days, creates astonishment and
amazement, readily understood by the men who then
mingled with the pioneers and lived their rude state of
existence contentedly, in spite of hardships and sufferings.
For there w r ere comparatively no comforts, and at times
even the bare necessaries of life were wanting, or, when
procured, were very dear. Nor was the hardy bushman or
“bull-puncher,” when visiting the Bush Inn and other
places where grog was vended, as decorous or circumspect
perhaps, as he should have been. The early settlers round
Tinana are reported as—A. Murray, lindah ; the Elwoods,
Tinana Creek; Pountney, Yardley ; P. O’Kelly, Ferney;
Hodges and Colquhoun, surveyors. Of these only P.
O’Kelly remains. White and M‘Gregor, farmers, are also
widely known, and are yet engaged in farming.
Queensland was first settled as a penal colony in 1825,
and about forty years after, in 1859, Separation took place,
the movement in its favour being solely successful through
the energetic and persistent efforts of the late John


Dnnmore Lang, D.D., then a member of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales.
Dr. Lang, who was thoroughly patriotic, and one of
the most lovable of men, will long be remembered through-
out Queensland ; indeed few of Australia’s colonists deserve
more to be immortalized by a statue than he. He was a native
of Greenock, Scotland, where he was born in August, 1779,
ordained by the Presbytery in 1822, and arrived in Sydney
in May, 1828, in which he resided till his death in 1878.
As showing his restless and energetic disposition, he visited
England no less than eight times on missions connected
with education, transportation and immigration, and was
instrumental in bringing out many settlers from the old
country to his beloved Queensland. In 1886 he was fined
£IOO for libelling Mr. Wilson, a merchant, but refusing to
pay the fine as unjust, stayed in gaol till it was subscribed
for by his many friends. In 1843 he was elected one of the
six members for Port Phillip in the New South Wales
Legislature, and in that capacity advocated the separation
of that colony. His plans for separation of Australia
generally into small colonies were based on the prosperity
of the independent American States, his knowledge of this
being gained by a visit to America in 1840. But it was not
until 1845 that he visited Moreton Bay, and by travel-
ling the length and breadth of the land making himself
thoroughly acquainted with its resources, its territorial
extent, and its peoples. The importance of these, and his
persistent patriotic advocacy of its interests, brought about
the separation from New South Wales and the founding of
Queensland. I give this small tribute here to a man of
honour and talent, who did more for this part of the world
than any other, however much lauded and praised indivi-
dual. Though we cannot resuscitate Dr. Lang, yet his
example may emulate some of our would-be patriotic
legislators and stimulate them to action. Men such as he
come but once in a decade, and should never be forgotten.
According to Dr. Lang’s plan of the seven united provinces
of Eastern Australia, the boundaries of Queensland, or as
he termed it “ Cook’s Land and Leichhardt’s Land,” were
from Shoal Bay to Keppel Bay, and from this to Rocking-
ham Bay on the coast, or in the interior, from Mount
Hopeless to Carpentaria, Our Rockhampton neighbours


have been very much in evidence since they knew that Dr.
Lang agitated Separation into a separate province from
Keppel Bay to Rockingham Bay.
At this distant stage of time, when signs of progress and
advancement are visible all round, it seems difficult to
understand why those first settlers did not possess sufficient
acumen or perception to know that at some far distant day
a town —city would hardly be dreamed of, much less
expected—might arise hereabouts. The land was good, and
agricultural operations proved successful ; its forests were
full of useful timber suitable for many purposes ; its streams
were full of fish ; game abounded in the jungle, and the
rude accessories of savage life were plentiful. Pastoral
settlement also found every facility for progress, yet none
seem to have expected the Maryborough of that day would
ever emerge from its chrysalis state to an important centre
of commerce. But the history of Maryborough is merely
the history of scores of other places founded among
barbarous and savage elements, and growing by means of
the energy and perseverance of its people to a position of
affluence and note. The Queen City of Victoria was founded
on just such lines.
OUR PIONEERS.
Our pioneers ! our pioneers ! who paved the nation’s way,
Look back along the shores of Time, and answer, Where are they ?
A few remain to yet relate the records of past days,
The rest, who nobly played their parts, dispersed in many ways —
Some, tired of this life’s rude shocks, to other lands are gone,
Perchance to fill unhonored graves, their merits little known.
Let’s treasure those who still remain located with us here;
The man most worthy of respect should be the pioneer. —Author.
We detachments steady throwing
Down the ridges, through the passes, up the mountains steep ;
Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,
Pioneers ! 0 Pioneers !
We primeval forests felling,
We the rivers stemming, vexing we, and piercing deep the mines within,
We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil upheaving,
Pioneers ! 0 Pioneers !— Walt Whitman.


Old Maryborough.
Had the first settlers equally regarded the laws of Right
and Might in their attempts to civilize an alien race who
had inhabited this territory from all time, they would have
escaped many outrages in loss of stock and murder of men.
Of the race themselves, they could but point to stone-
covered mounds heaped with logs, beneath which the “ Rude
forefathers of the hamlet slept.” In the interior, on the
Balonne River, the dead aboriginal is usually placed in the
fork of lofty trees, and there left to rot, after which the
bones are collected and carefully preserved by the gins, who
carry them in dilly-bags as relics and charms against evil.
Prior to the advent of the whites, the race here doubtless
numbered full 5,000, and nearly that number attended a
national corroborree and fight at the old township in 1848.
To the casual observer, they were a singularly uninteresting
people, and it seemed strange that Nature, having provided
them with so much, they should need so little. The facility
with which they managed their bark canoes, and caught
fish in the river, speared kangaroo or emu, and obtained
opossums and cobi (native bee honey) from the tall gum
trees, and their accomplishments in tracking stray horses,
or sitting “ buckjumpers,” alone saved them from being
treated with contempt. Their polygamous instincts and
lax ideas as to the status of woman —her value as a
wife being merely estimated by her ability to carry
a heavy load of chattels and effects for her lord and
master —to be a submissive slave to his whims and caprices,
and to permit herself to be sold for purposes of lust nightly
to the highest bidder. Coin of any kind, and even worthless
tokens, was sufficient to secure any aboriginal female, how-
ever virtuous or apparently immaculate, if bartered by her
sable partner. Doubtless the system of concubinage in
which many squatters and their men indulged, and the
feeling of jealousy induced in the savage mind, may account
for the numerous murders and outrages which sullied the
records of the first founding of these districts, and the
grafting of civilization on the tree of barbarism. But the
blacks, whilst faithful to fault, were mischievous and
treacherous, and even sacrificed their dearest friends for
revenge. No white man was safe then without his rifle or
Colt’s revolver at hand. The jungle on the banks of the


Mary enabled them to move through the country without
being seen, and now and then the settler discovered their
presence in his vicinity by a dead bullock or two with spears
in the carcass, or in a report from the out-stations of some
unfortunate shepherd or hutkeeper having got a bad
“ poltogue ” with a nulla-nulla or tomahawk. They
cleverly marked their tracks to water, and then, perched on
branches of trees overhead, managed to spear their game.
Like the cockatoo, there was always a sentinel on the look-
out for intruders on their domains, and they had a smart
knack of approaching out-stations apparently unarmed, but
really dragging spears between their toes.
What with droughts, famines, floods, bush fires and black
outrages, the early pioneers had sufficient to try their
fortitude, and it required men of more than ordinary pluck
and hardihood to take up runs here in these barbarous
times. Some of the first squatters, never too particular,
even in civilization, cast aside all conventionalities and even
decency in dress and manner, and established themselves in
gunyahs, or rude erections of slabs and bark, from which
they sallied out at early morn to scour the run in search of
their cattle, or accompanied by a blackfellow, or general
useful new chum, rejoicing in the name of overseer, who
was gaining “ colonial experience ”in a rough school. The
scarcity of white females, and the preponderance of dark
ones, naturally had a demoralizing effect on the minds of
those who possessed little elevated tastes, and were unable
to discriminate the difference between the pure and good,
and the impure and evil. Morality was simply unthought
of, and the most shameless prostitution was extant in those
days of adulterated “ fire-water,” haphazard virtue, want of
congenial companionship, and lewdness.
But let not the realistic picture I have drawn of the state
of things in squatterdom in the forty and early fifties, lead
any modern ultra-moralist to regard this with pious horror,
since there were not only to be found men of noble minds
and instincts among the pioneers, who, having left virtuous
wives and families in cities far away, were still true to them
and refused to have neither act nor part in the “ accursed
thing,” the debaucheries extant or the orgies at stations
when shearing was over and the clip went down. Some of
the gatherings of cattle drovers, teamsters, “bull-punchers,”


squatters, and the rest of the “wild men of the bush”
fraternity at the Wide Bay and Burnett stations re-
sembled little else than a wild saturnalia, in which he who
could tell the most smutty yarn, sing the lewdest and most
roistering songs, dance and play the best antics, was re-
garded as worthy of hero-worship. On a station, not
twenty miles from Maryborough, a man, when well primed
with rum, resolved for a wager to sit a buckjumping horse
on top of a table for £5 ; and he did it, too, on the animal
being lifted bodily on to the table. Had he been thrown
headlong to the ground, he would, doubtless, have lost his
life.
If those were the days of lawless sprees and im-
morality, they were times of genuine hospitality, such
as will never perhaps be seen again. Every hut was a
traveller’s hotel for the night, and no postman brought un-
pleasant missives. Ignorance of the world’s doing pre-
vailed, and a blissful state of happiness which it was a pity
to disturb. Newspapers there were none nearer than
Sydney, and all news came verbally, and was received as
fact without question or doubt. Improvements were few,
an occasional post-and-rail fence formed the boundaries,
when a marked tree-line of blazed trees was a connecting
link between stations, and oft guided the lost traveller safe
to the desired haven. Beyond this, there were no fences,
nor bridges, and the rider could take a bee-line to wherever
he wanted to go. Gaps were cut in the scrub on the
banks of the river, so that a horseman could scramble
down, ford the river, and cross to the opposite bank.
The sight, long familiar to our pioneer settlers, will never
probably be seen again. The whole Wide Bay district was
then an uninterrupted meadow of waving grass, on which
the few stock could scarce make an impression. Kangaroos
and emus hopped or ran lazily across the plains ; ducks
flew out of every waterhole, and the black swan was often
met with ; whilst the stately bustard strutted and puffed
out its breast feathers as if indignant at the intrusion.
Every tree appeared full of foliage, and the locust sang
gleefully as if to welcome the white man to the new Arcadia
which he had long desired to possess.
During 1845, there was still a large tract of unoccupied
country open to the first comer, and the only deterrent


against a “ rush ” to secure it was caused by the low price
of sheep and cattle which were then more valued for weight
of wool and tallow than for the meat; in fact, many cattle
were not worth more than their hides, and indifferent
country was hardly worth occupation, so that some of the
best runs were held very cheap. One unfortunate over-
lander had the misfortune to get all his sheep scabbed in
the Bathurst district, and tried in vain to cure them en
route. But he safely reached his station on the Burnett,
and, aided by a skilful overseer and experienced shepherd,
soon cleared the flock from disease ; so successfully eradicat-
ing it that it never returned. A somewhat similar case
occurred at Mondure, when most of the flocks suffered from
“ foot-rot,” the result of Chinese shepherding. Captain
O’Connell gave a bonus to each shepherd who cured his
sheep, and in less than a year every hoof on the station
was as sound as ever. Ned Dias, a fellow shepherd of
mine, cured his flock of foot-rot, and was rewarded by
Captain O’Connell with a cheque for £5. Taken altogether,
the Wide Bay and Burnett districts have enjoyed immunity
from disease in the flocks. Whilst shepherding at Cania, I
observed several of my sheep affected with the “bottle,” and
foot-rot also prevailed. But by the exercise of common
sense, aided by careful dressing and attention, 1 pulled the
ailing animals through, and they were soon all right, and as
ravenous feeders as ever.
EARLY SETTLEMENT-PIONEERS AND OTHERS.
As will be readily imagined at this distant date from
the period when the pioneers of these districts arrived here,
information concerning them is but scant and unreliable,
and too often nothing save hearsay evidence is forthcoming,
or imperfect records supplied by their descendants. Cer-
tainly the experiences of one of the early settlers was very
similar to the rest —the same hardships, difficulties, rough
and ready life, the same aborigines ready to swoop down on
the defenceless squatter, kill his shepherds or drive off flocks,
and herds, .burn huts, and attack his teams when laden with


stores. It was from New South Wales most of our Wide
Bay pioneers came overland, generally with their belongings,
or else in some of the fleet of brigs, schooners, and coasters
which plied to the old Mary River for timber. In 1841,
Victoria, now one of the principal colonies of the Australian
group, had but a population of 2,500, and only 150 acres of
land were under cultivation. There were few things there
to attract settlers, and the extensive districts of Moreton
Bay, Burnett and Wide Bay appeared to present more
pleasing features and more abundant facilities for pastoral
enterprise ; this, indeed was just what suited many of the
immigrants to New South Wales, to whom the free wildlife
of the bush and cattle-tending, stockriding, horsebreaking,,
and mustering, offered great attractions —hence there was a
greater influx to Queensland than Victoria in the early
fifties, before the Wand of Fortunatusin the shape of monster
nuggets at Ballarat and Bendigo had allured population back
to the hills and gullies of those magnificent goldfields.
From 1851 onwards, rushes of a more or less exciting
character occurred, and though prospecting over the Wide
Bay and Burnett country was carried on by fossickers in a
desultory or half-hearted manner, it was not till 1876 that
Gympie gold showed that Queenslanders had struck the
right spot.
Hon. Andrew Heron Wilson, M.L.C.
Andrew Heron Wilson is a native of Ayr, Scotland,
where he was born on August 24, 1844. He was educated
at the Ayr Academy, and intended for the Law, but whilst
pursuing his studies his health was impaired, and being
advised a change, he left for Queensland in 1863, arriving
in Maryborough on April 2, 1864, where, after spending
over a year in endeavouring to find suitable investment for
capital, he met with Messrs. Robert Hart and the late
James Bartholomew, practical and experienced men, with a
thorough knowledge of the saw-milling and wood-working
trades, and was induced to unite with them in partnership,
the firm from that period being known as “ Wilson, Hart,
and Bartholomew.” Mr. Wilson’s observations of the
extensive operations carried on in the Wide Bay district,
in the large and valuable pine and cedar scrubs and well-
timbered hardwood country adjacent to Maryborough, was
convincing proof that his partners’ knowledge of the trade,


p

HON. A. H. WILSON, M.L.C.


combined with his own energies and capital, would be well-
directed, and, in order to facilitate operations, he, accom-
panied by Mr. Hart, went to Great Britain, where they
purchased a complete saw-milling plant with all the newest
“up to date ” appliances in machinery. This was safely
landed in Maryborough, and erected in 1866, on the river
bank, Granville, opposite the residence of J. E. Brown, Esq.,
and though the business was at first but gradual, it had
reached a prominent stage of prosperity when, unfortunately,
in 1881, the works were totally destroyed by fire, and the
labour of years lost. A calamity such as this might have-
damped the ardour of less energetic men than the enterpris-
ing firm of Wilson, Hart, and Co., but they lost no time in
re-establishing the large and profitable business they had
worked up ; and ere long, a new and much larger sawmill
with the latest improvements was erected on the town side
of Maryborough, adjacent to the Botanical Gardens, where
it is now as “ familiar as household words,” under the old
style and title. As fuller particulars of these works with
illustration appear elsewhere, it is but necessary to remark
that Mr. Wilson having been, in September, 1888, elected
a member of the Legislative Council of Queensland, retired
from the active management of the saw-milling business,
thus leaving this entirely to Mr. E. Hart, who, though the
firm still retains its original title of “Wilson, Hart, and
C 0.,” is the principal manager of the establishment. To
have accomplished so much in so short a period, reflects
great credit not only on the firm but on Mr. Wilson, who
has well earned the calm and pleasant retirement he now
enjoys at his beautiful residence, “ Boon Villa,” on the banks
of the Mary River, near Maryborough. Though Mr. Wilson
has never taken any active standpoint in the political arena,
he was, prior to his nomination in 1888, twice offered a seat
in the Upper House, of which, until that period, business
prevented his acceptance; though he has always been a
staunch supporter of Conservative Governments, in which
the Mcllwraithian principles predominate, and it is gratify-
ing to know he is—what all who desire the progress of this
young colony should be—a protectionist, and advocate for
fostering those industries calculated to benefit the country
of his adoption. But whilst doing so, he is no opponent of
free-trade on everything we cannot grow, raise, make, or

produce ourselves. Whilst taking no very active part at
present in public matters, Mr. Wilson is as much interested
in the Wide Bay timber trade as ever, and this, together
with the local iron industries, has his hearty support.
Whilst at Granville, where he resided for fifteen years, Mr.
Wilson erected a most comfortable home and made a beau-
tiful garden on land known as “ Canning Park,” but within
a year after the destruction of the sawmills by fire, he pur-
chased his present residence and grounds at “ Boon Villa,”
which, under his auspices and the assistance of experienced
gardeners, has become one of the prettiest and most elegant
homesteads in Queensland.
“ Boon Villa,” the name and fame of which has extended
all over the colonies, is a large and comfortable habitation
in the Elizabethan style of architecture, and occupies a
• commanding position on the banks of the Mary River, of
which glorious and attractive views can be obtained. The
house itself is most complete in every department, and the
ornamentations and internal decorations in the drawing-
room and dining-room, also the spacious halls, could not be
surpassed, if equalled, even in the metropolis. "V isitors are
always welcomed by the courteous host and hostess, whose
name for hospitality is proverbial; and more than one well-
contested game of billiards has taken place in the fine room
devoted to that popular amusement; whilst among those
who have honoured the establishment with their presence
may be enumerated Sir Henry and Lady Norman, and latest,
but not least of all, our present popular Governor, Lord
Lamington. All these have expressed the delight they felt
at seeing “ Boon Villa,” and its numerous floral and
arborescent attractions ; and have testified their appreciation
of the hearty welcome accorded them.
Like many of the country gentlemen of modern days,
Mr. Wilson has expended considerable capital in beautifying
and improving the surroundings of his abode, and has prac-
tically illustrated what can be done with soil and flat
land. Everywhere around one sees something to attract
and delight the eye and heart. Foliage, flowers, shrubs,
rich and rare plants, and exotics meet the stranger at every
turn, the whole forming a panoramic vista of beauty charm-
ing to behold. It must have been some such spot as this


which evoked the fertile muse of Scotia’s greatest bard,
Robert Burns, as he poured forth in the fulness of his heart,
“ Ye banks and braes of bonnie Doon,
How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair!”
But here, unlike this pathetic song, there is nothing to make
the visitor sad ; all is pleasant and enjoyable, with the best
of good cheer dispensed with lavish hand. The central
hall is a delightful spot on summer days, the tables filled
with attractive literature, and the adjacent fountain sending
up its sparkling streams to fall like music on the ears of the
beholder, who cannot but feel happy and contented whilst
looking out upon ferns and beautiful pot plants seemingly
innumerable. In the adjacent grounds are two glass-
covered conservatories, an aviary, and extensive stabling
and outbuildings. Mr. Wilson has a fine stud of horses and
other animals, whilst his poultry comprise many rare and
choice varieties. Among floral beauties at the time of my
visit were some magnificent chrysanthemums, which I was
glad to learn had been exhibited at the local shows and also
at Brisbane, receiving as justly due first prizes and honours,
In the large shade-houses a staff of practical gardeners were
busily engaged in sifting mould for the flower beds. The
whole of these gardens have been entirely re-made, the
original basis being hard rock, on which choice mould, care-
fully sifted and manipulated, has been deposited before aught
could be planted. The result of this is now shown in the
fertility of the soil, and the prolific character of the
arborescent gems of nature which enhance the beauty of the
spot. Among plants and flowers in the gardens of “ Doon
Villa ” the following are conspicuous :— Grammitis Gymno-
gramme ; Chrysophylla , or Golden Fern; Gymnograrnme Tar-
tarian or Silver Fern. These novelties in the botanic world
are rare specimens of nature’s handiwork. The Aralia
Veitchii ; Polypodium urophyllum , or Creeping Fern, on banks
of the Mary River; Adiantum, or Maiden-hair Fern;
Davallia, or Hare’s-foot Fern ; Alsophila Leichhardtiana , or
Tree Fern; Pithicalobrum Samen , or Rain Tree of the
African Desert. Though there are numerous other botanic
curiosities among the wonderful trees here, yet the foregoing
stand as types of the principal, and want of space alone
prevents extension of the list.
Among local societies with which Mr. Wilson is con-
nected, either as patron, president, or supporter, the follow-


ing may be enumerated :—He was captain of the first cricket
club formed in Maryborough; President of the Wide Bay
Caledonian Association ; President of the Chamber of Com-
merce ; Director of the Town and Suburban Building
Society ; and Director in many other companies established
for the benefit of Maryborough and the surrounding
districts. He is also patron of many football and
cricket clubs, and among other matters it may be mentioned
that he has set apart a fine piece of land at “ Doon Villa ”
as a bowling-green for the special use of the gentlemen
players of Maryborough. Here they meet at intervals in
friendly contest, and many an exciting game has been
played on the green sward to the delight, not only of them-
selves, but the spectators. There is also a large tennis
court for friends and visitors always kept in splendid order.
Apart from his support of all that contributes to the ad-
vancement of the spot of his adoption, Mr. Wilson’s private
generosity and benevolence is shown in an unostentatious
and kindly way, and many such acts are on record which
are hardly known beyond the recipients themselves.
Many a picnic of school children and others have been
held at the grounds of “Doon Villa,” where a skeleton shed
stands merely requiring tarpaulins over the roof to protect
them from the sun, and numerous permanent swings for
their enjoyment; whilst the Presbyterian Church, of which
Mr. Wilson is a strong supporter, has been greatly benefited
by his influence and kindly support. Held in the highest
esteem by a wide circle of friendly well wishers, Mr. Wilson
and his amiable wife stand pre-eminent as types of the
true gentleman and lady, and a fervent wish is expressed by
all that they may long be spared to continue the dispensa-
tion of those blessings and benefits which have hitherto
characterized their kindly and noble career in life.
In 1889, Mr. Wilson, accompanied by Mrs. Wilson, took
a voyage to England, and soon after their return went to
New Zealand, viewing all objects and places of interest in
those wondrous islands. The numerous adventures, sights
and scenes so impressed Mr. Wilson that he embodied Ins
thoughts and opinions on them in a very readable and
graphic little book, which he published on his return to the
colony under the title of “ From Maryborough, Queensland,
to and through New Zealand in 1891.”
Not* —Accompanied by Mrs. Wilson he is at present [1896] enjoying a tour
through the same beautiful isles of the Pacific.

E. T. ALDRIDGE.
First Pioneer Settler at Old Township, 1849.


E. T. Aldridge (First white settler).
Edward T. Aldridge may justly be regarded as
the first white settler at Maryborough, as he took up land at
Baddow, now known as West Maryborough, but then re-
garded as the “ old township.” Of this at present little
but ruins remain, though the ancient relics of settlement
and civilization stand as landmarks from the distant past.
The township was specially founded on an eligible site for
shipment of wool, brought thither by teams from the
stations of the Burnett and Wide Bay. At the close of
1848 the population numbered 880, and Mr. Aldridge opened
a general store and hotel, designated the Bush Inn. The
latter was removed at a later date to the site now occupied
by the Royal Hotel, of which it formed the foundation. In
1852, the first land sale was held, and Mr. Aldridge, having
purchased largely, became an extensive owner of property.
The new Bush Inn was erected in 1856, in Kent street,
Maryborough, and has changed hands several times since
Mr. Aldridge was the landlord. Among those who have
filled the position of host may be mentioned the late W.
Casbrook Giles, Kehlet and Gill, R. M. Hyne, and Mr.
Oelrichs and others.
In 1887, Mr. Aldridge, by great and constant agitation,
obtained from the Government in Sydney the sum of
£I,OOO, out of which was built the old courthouse and lock-
up, these being the first brick buildings erected in Mary-
borough. Mr. Aldridge retired from business in 1860, and
lived on his property at Baddow till his death on May 18,
1888. He was among the pioneers of the sugar industry,
and supported every effort to foster the prosperous business.
In 1886 Mr. Aldridge had the misfortune to lose his wife,
to whom he was greatly attached, and he raised many
tributes to her memory, two of which took the form of a
massive tower with peal of nine bells, alongside St. Paul’s
Church of England, and the erection of St. Thomas’
Church. The virtues of Mrs. Aldridge were well-known
and appreciated by her many Maryborough friends, and her
death was regarded as a great loss to the town. Mr.
Aldridge was 70 years of age at the time of his death, and
he was the father of Mr. H. E. Aldridge (Baddow), and of
Mrs. F. Bryant, wife of the well-known auctioneer.


Whilst Maryborough remains, the name of Aldridge, as the
pioneer and first white settler, will not be obliterated from
memory.
A further account of Mr. Aldridge’s history has been
sent me, which is here transcribed :
“ Edward T. Aldridge, native of England, and resident
for some time at the McLeay River, New South Wales, left
there in 1848 for the then hardly known Wide Bay terri-
tory, arriving overland on June 4th, 1848, with his wife
and family and stock. He settled on land which he named
Baddow, on the site of which the ‘ old township ’ was after-
wards surveyed and allotments sold. Mr. Henry Palmer
and his brother, R. E. Palmer, having met Mr. Aldridge at
Merodian Station, where they were resting with their
flocks, offered to accompany Mr. Aldridge, and as Mr. R. E.
Palmer had cut a marked tree-line to ‘ Girkom,’ and knew
the route to the river, he w T as considered an acquisition to
the party. Aldridge’s party comprised Enoch Rudder, jun.,
John Meyers, Win. Fitzgerald, and a blackfellow, Tommy,
from Gigoomgan. Mr. H. Palmer with his brother went
back with Tommy after reaching Baddow, and returned
from Merodian with their flocks. Mr. Aldridge left Brisbane
in April, 1848, and travelled overland to Wide Bay, crossing
the Mary River on June 4, 1848. As soon as population
gathered near the ‘ old township,’ Mr. Aldridge erected the
Bush Inn in 1849, but afterwards conferred the same title
on another hotel which he built in new Maryborough, and
which is now known as the Royal Hotel, and has been so
much added to and improved that but little of the original
structure remains.”
THE GREGORY FAMILY.
Mrs. Margaret Irwin.
Mrs. Margaret Irwin, one of the oldest residents of the
town and district, died on December 24th, 1895. She had
suffered for considerable time from a painful internal com-
plaint, and underwent a critical surgical operation, but this
last resource was of no avail, and death resulted. Mrs.
Irwin was closely associated with the history of the town
and district for the past forty-four years, having landed in
Maryborough with her sister (the late Mrs. Goodwin), in

the year 1841. She was cast in an heroic mould, and from
her girlhood, through a great part of her womanly years,
lived in an atmosphere of stirring and romantic pioneering
vicissitudes. On the voyage from Sydney to Maryborough
her sister (Mrs. Goodwin) and herself were the only female
passengers on board the small sailing vessel. The crew
mutinied, cast the officers adrift in a boat, and ran away
with the vessel and the two girl passengers, eventually
landing the latter on the New Zealand coast, where they
lived for a time with the Maoris. Her family, the well-
known “ Gregorys,” were among the first settlers at the
“ old township,” and the deceased lady herself was one of
the first storekeepers and residents in the present town of
Maryborough. She married Geo. Irwin, a noted carrier,
and left Maryborough to establish the Didcot Hotel, on the
Gayndah road, near Hegilbo. Geo. Irwin, host of the
Didcot Hotel, was interred there. Those were stirring and
dangerous times of the pioneering days, and Mrs. Irwin
tackled the difficulties with the decision and courage of a
hero, and whilst at all times showing a valiant nature, her
unostentatious hospitality, kindness and innumerable
charitable acts displayed a gentleness of heart which won a
sympathetic fame throughout the district. After her hus-
band’s death, Mrs. Irwin returned to Maryborough, and
built the Australian Hotel, which she conducted till her
death. She left considerable town property, but no family.
Note— Mrs. Irwin’s shop still stands in Adelaide street,
a relic of bygone days.
I
Mrs. Sarah Blue.
Mrs. Sarah Blue, widow of the late Neil Blue, was
born in Sydney in 1848, and arrived with her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Gregory, at the “ old township ” in 1848.
She is well-known as owner and hostess of the Melbourne
Hotel, a large and commodious house in Wharf street,
Maryborough, its close proximity to the steamer wharves
and excellent accommodation rendering it a favourite
stopping-place for travellers and families. Mrs. Blue is,
with one exception, the last representative of the time-
honoured Gregory family. The three sisters, Mesdames
Irwin, Goodwin and Blue, were strongly attached, and the

survivor naturally feels the keenest grief at their loss. Mrs.
Blue is possessed of considerable property through the
decease of Mrs. Irwin, is executrix in her estate, and
is held in high esteem by all from her willingness to aid in
every movement to benefit those needing assistance. Mrs.
Blue has three sons, Archibald Irwin, Neil Irwin, and
Herbert Irwin, so that the family name of her late sister is
likely to be perpetuated for years to come. It is seldom
such devotedness and love has been found with sisters any-
where as shown in this family—indeed, it is quite the
reverse in most communities.
Mes. Elizabeth Goodwin.
Mrs. Elizabeth Goodwin was born in Sydney, N.S.W.,and
was the eldest daughter of the late Charles Gregory. She
will long be remembered for her large-heartedness and
charitable disposition. Like Mrs. Irwin, she was a
thorough business woman, and, as one of the first settlers
of the district, had many encounters with the blacks. In
the early days of Maryborough, she often went round at
night to protect her neighbours. She was of lively disposi-
tion, and, though a woman of 17st, weight was often
sought after as a pleasant partner for a dance in a ball-
room. Her sisters, the Gregorys, were much attached to
her, and, after a trip to England, her death was a great
blow to them. She left a large family, all married and
settled in this town.
Speaking of Mrs. Goodwin’s estimable character, the
Maryborough Chronicle of November 24, 1882, remarks :
“We regret to have to announce the death of one who,
in many worthy ways, came under public notice, and was
well and favourably known to our citizens. We allude to
Mrs. Goodwin, who succumbed to a long and painful illness.
This estimable lady had only reached Brisbane on her way
back to Maryborough, after a voyage to Europe in quest of
the best medical advice, when death put an end to her
sufferings. There are few here who remember the
calamitous destruction of life and limb by sawmill explosion
in Maryborough some years ago, who do not also remember
the noble devotion which Mrs. Goodwin displayed in
attending the sufferers night and day during their long period

of recovery. Many other and similar records equally
creditable to the head and heart of this heroic lady are
engraven on the sands of time, and cannot fail to inspire
sincere regret at the announcement of her demise. The
mortal remains were brought to Maryborough by steamer,
and interred in the local cemetery.”
Mrs. Harwood.
Mrs. Harwood was in her 88th year at the time of her
death. Was a lady of amiable disposition, and is still
justly regarded as one of the first lady pioneers of the Wide
Bay district, and, like her husband, met with many terrible
adventures and hairbreadth escapes from the blacks. As a
tribute to her memory, Mr. Harwood erected an expensive
and handsome monument in the old cemetery, in which more
than one pioneer colonist is laid to rest, on the tablet of
which her many virtues are recorded. Mr. Harwood, who
resides on his property with his second wife in Lennox
street, Maryborough, though in his 79th year, is hale and
hearty, may be considered an authority on all that took
place at the first settlement of Maryborough, and can tell
some stiff yarns of the lives of pioneers there, fraught with
dangers and perils of which the present generation have no
conception. Mr. Harwood’s experiences in the Queensland
Mounted Police Force alone would fill several large-sized
volumes, and it is said he intends to publish an interesting
record of those bygone days.
James Dowzer.
James Dowzer was bom on 10th December, 1826, at
Clongall, county of Carlow, Ireland, where his father,
Michael Dowzer, was a farmer and innkeeper. When
about three years old, he was brought to Tomacork, near
the market town of Carnew, county of Wicklow, and
adopted by his grandfather, with whom he resided until his
22nd year, being educated in the Protestant School, con-
ducted by the rector of the parish, and qualified trained
teachers of Dublin. In 1850 he married, and shortly after
went to Dublin, where he entered the ironmongery estab-
lishment of Smith Brothers, in Cape! street, as general
assistant, and from thence went to Birkenhead, Liverpool,

and on the 12th March, 1853, sailed for Queensland in the
ship John Fielding , with 200 other emigrants, which arrived
at Moreton Bay on July 12 following. After considerable
difficulty in working the passage from the Bay to Brisbane
in a lighter, there being only about 18 inches of water on
the river bar, the passengers had to wait several hours for
the tide to shift the vessel over. On arrival at Brisbane,
Mr. Dowzer was unable to procure employment where his
wife would be associated with him, shepherding and hut-
keeping being the only spheres available, so he declined
these, and ultimately, through the influence of Captain
Wickham, Government Kesident, was appointed to the
Ipswich Police Force. Colonel Gray was then P.M., and,
as Mr. Dowzer’s duties were very light, he was enabled to
employ spare time as harness-maker with the late
Christopher Gorry, who then carried on a large business in
the saddlery line. Mr. Dowzer continued here about six
months, when he retired from the police, and entered the
service of Mr. Richard Gill, saddler and storekeeper, of
Bell street, at a salary of £3 per week, and ultimately,
through the influence of his employer, went to Wide Bay,
and arrived at Maryborough in November, 1854, when he
found about fifty people located in huts, erected in the
purely primitive style of bush architecture. The township
was established on the site now known as West Mary-
borough or the “ old township,” which then had but one
public house, the Bush Inn, of which the late E. T. Aldridge
was the proprietor. There was also a blacksmith’s shop,
occupied by Charles Hickson; a butcher’s shop by John
Ward; Jas. Fanning, bootmaker, Charlie Thompson, a
tailor, famed for misfits. There were also Dr. Palmer, a
clerk of petty sessions named Thorsby, a cabinetmaker
named Martin, who made chairs that would invariably
break down when sat upon. The rest of the population
comprised sawyers, splitters, and their families, and last,
but not least, the renowned William Furbur, who had just
returned from Ipswich, after having his head put in order by
Dr. Dorsey, having nearly received his death blow by a
blackfellow’s tomahawk, the head hanging by mere skin,
and there was a deep cut in the back of the neck. Mr.
Dowzer says he often examined the scar left on poor
Furbur’s neck, but never could realize how he rode back to


Ipswich, 8. journey of about 150 miles, in ten days in the
condition he was in. Furbur, together with his son-in-law,
met his fate three years later at the hands of two black-
fellows whilst felling timber on Teddington Creek, near to
the present Maryborough Waterworks. The crime was
atrocious, though it was believed that Furbur brought it on
himself, as it was well-known he did not spare powder or
ball on the “ darkies.” The most lamentable part of the
affair was that Williamson, who had married Furbur’s
daughter, had just arrived from Sydney, and was ignorant
of any injustice done to the blacks, should suffer with the
man against whom they had a grudge.
Mr. Dowzer carried on business at the “old township”
for some time as saddler and storekeeper, and took Richard
Paling as partner into his business, who, however, shortly
after left to join his friends in India, and Mr. Dowzer sub-
sequently shifted to premises in new Maryborough, on the
site now occupied by Hockley and Co. and adjoining build-
ings, where he took Mr. John Purser as partner, and the
business was continued with varying success until the firm
abandoned it in the latter part of 1865.
From that period until the present year Mr. Dowzer has
been connected with most of the local, public and private
institutions, and was nearly the cause of establishing the
School of Arts. He also helped to initiate the Mary-
borough Hospital, and was elected one of the first aider-
men, Mr. H. Palmer being the first mayor, Mr. John Faton
next, and Mr. Dowzer third, having succeeded him in that
capacity in 1862. Mr. Dowzer was appointed to the Com-
mission of the Peace on Ist January, 1868, and a magis-
trate to give consent to the marriage of minors in 1881.
On retiring from business, he engaged in dairy farming,
and carried it on near Maryborough for about eight years.
His dairy stock getting so numerous, he took up new
country and removed to Tiaro, his present abode, where he
is still engaged in pastoral pursuits and dairy farming. He
has long "been a successful exhibitor in live stock, dairy and
farm products, and obtained numerous prize medals and
certificates at the Maryborough, Gympie and other exhibi-
tions.
During his residence in Maryborough, Mr. Dowzer has
been associated with almost every public movement for the

advancement of the city and district, and was instrumental
in having the municipality established. The primary
system of education had his help as member of the com-
mittee for several years, during which the first primary
school was erected. This relic of the past still exists near
the old Immigration Barracks. Mr. Dowzer has been con-
nected with local building societies, and a director for over
nine years of the Permanent Society, of which Mr. J.
Purser has been secretary since its inception.
He was twice mayor—first in 1868 and in 1876. During
his term of office Mr. Dowzer showed great firmness and
determination of character, when the late T. Hutchins and
G. Howard (Cockey) organized a mob to destroy the cor-
poration fence and gates erected to enclose this 90-acre
■town reserve. (This exciting episode caused great sensation
in Maryborough, and is often still referred to by “ old
hands.”) Mr. Dowzer took an active part in establishing
the Wide Bay Farmers and Agricultural Society, an insti-
tution which, as shown elsewhere, was very successful.
On retiring from business in 1865, and during his occu-
pation as dairy farmer, he attended to the requirements of
the School of Arts, and for fully eight years acted as
secretary and librarian to that institution. He was also
engaged in many other capacities, and his public acts are
recorded in the local Chronicle and News , of which want of
space alone prevents a longer record.
On the establishment of the Divisional Boards, Mr.
Dowzer was one of the first nine members appointed for
the Tiaro Division, and unanimously elected the first chair-
man, and, with the exception of that period, has continued
and is still a member of that board. To Mr. Dowzer the
citizens are mainly indebted for the present Botanical
Gardens, which were fenced during his second mayorality,
and, with the assistance of the then Town Surveyor, the
late Mr. William Ramsay, he planted the first twenty-five
ornamental trees therein. Among these are the Banyan,
fig trees and others, natives of India and South America,
which were sent from the Brisbane Botanical Garden by
the late Curator, Mr. Walter Hill. Mr. Dowzer was one of
a committee appointed to carry out the erection of the first
wharf at a cost of £SOO, given by the New South Wales
Government before separation of the colony, and was also


appointed lieutenant in the Queensland Rifle Rangers, one
of the first corps established in Queensland, of which Mr.
R. B. Sheridan was captain. He was also a director and
chairman of the Cotton-growing Association in 1870.
At the laying of the first stone of the Primary School,
by the late Chief Justice Cockle, the following correct copy
of a document sealed in a fruit bottle was placed under the
stone :
“ The foundation stone of this building was laid on
Wednesday, the twenty-second day of March, in the year
of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-five,
by the Honourable James Cockle, Chief Justice of Queens-
land, in the fifth year of the Governorship of Sir George
Ferguson Bowen, G.C.M.G.

MARYBOROUGH, 1896.
Kent Street Looking E st.


PART 11.
NEW MARYBOROUGH.
title may be justly applied to the present city
which, having risen from the ashes or mists of
the past, is rapidly forging on to progress and
prosperity. It is only those who return here,
after long years’ absence, can justly estimate the improve-
ments which have taken place in the old spots which
in the early days were little more than reclaimed from
nature and kept in order by the bushman’s axe or saw.
Who would have thought in 1850 that Ululah Lagoon would
ever have been surrounded by the beautiful and well-built
residences of Messrs. E. B. C. Corser, J. M. Stafford, and
H. J. Gray, all more or less delightful homes in which
taste, culture, and adornment prevails, whilst their adjacent
gardens are filled with foliage, ferns, and flowers, with which
similar habitations elsewhere unfavourably compare ?
In the early days, the usual surveyor’s broad-arrow cut
on the ground or on a tree was the sole limitation of streets
or thoroughfares, and till the year 1860 no attempts were
made by residents to advance the town or render it a
worthy abiding-place. A single store or an hotel, one baker,
butcher, saddler, or shoemaker were sufficient for the com-
munity who dwelt in a happy family state together, and
generally had “ all things in common.” Better, perhaps,
it would have been for many had those primitive easy-going
times continued, in lieu of the rapid strides made by civili-
zation, and the changes which fashion and modern custom
has imposed as necessary to existence, for really the New
Maryborough doth in no way resemble the Old. Those
hardy sons of toil and endurance, who were lords of the
stockwhip and adepts at “bull-punching,” have passed
away, and the names of George Robertson, George Bennett,
Jack Richmond, and George Irwin are, with a score of
others, almost forgotten or seldom mentioned, unless when


two or three “old hands” foregather at the “Ariadne’ 7
or other hotel relics of bygone days.
Great difficulty, as will be supposed, has beset the path
of the author in obtaining even the most scanty particulars
of these bygone men who appear as indelibly stamped out
and forgotten as though they had never existed. Such
fragmentary evidence, however, as has been obtainable, will
be found among the biographies contained in this volume.
New Maryborough is, of course, quite the reverse of Old
Maryborough. In it “ old things have passed away and all
become new.” The ancient “ bull-puncher,” “ bearded like
the pard, full of strange oaths,” and dust begrimed moleskin
pants and cabbage-tree hat, is seldom met now. The
periodic sprees nowadays are but harmless affairs (cheques
for large sums gained by team-driving or shearing are heard
of, but seldom seen), and the orgies, revelries, and devilries
of ancient times are but remembered among things that
were and are not. In 1855, the female element was small;
in fact, there were not more than six white women in the
town and about four in the district—certainly not twenty in
all. The absence of females of refined tastes and habits
from any community is always a source of demoralization,
and, failing their presence, strong passions, unchecked
are often excited and apt to run riot in less harm-
less sports than courting, flirtation, or even dancing;
whilst the want of wives was felt by the more moral portion
of society, that leaning to less attractive females, gratified
some of sensual tastes with aboriginal partners, who were
in most instances quite as faithful to them as their more
favoured European sisters. In 1860 immigration to Queens-
land brought several vessels to Brisbane and Maryborough,
and, as among the girls who landed here, several were fair
to look upon, they were soon married off instead of
having to enter into the servitude they had expected.
Some of the unions thus contracted turned out happily.
Speaking of immigration, reminds me of Charles Colville
Horrocks, a prominent man here in bygone days, and co-
equal with Geo. Faircloth, P.M., afterwards appointed to
Gympie in 1878, Robert Gray and Henry Jordan were in-
strumental in augmenting our population by lectures in the
old country. But for immigration to Queensland, Mary-
borough would not have increased its population for years,.

and the living stream set in from the United Kingdom in
1869, with 6,701 souls for that year, continued in ratio till
1873, when 15,741 landed, and many of these came to
Maryborough and the Wide Bay district. Owing to over-
crowding the market, free immigration to Queensland was
suspended in 1878, and population was only augmented by
visitors from the adjacent colonies. The following were
the vessels which arrived here :—Glamorganshire (290),
May 3, 1874; Alardus (250), June, 1873; Golden South
(500), June 2, 1866 ; Lady Bowen, steamer, 1864 ; Sul-
tana (425), 1864; Oscar, China ship (150), July, 1873;
Ariadne, first immigrant ship, wrecked Hervey’s Bay,
October 5, 1862 ; several lives lost; Gloucester (222), 1873;
French barque, Paramie, wrecked October 7, 1873, many
lost; Humbolt (500), October 29, 1873; Wild Wave,
wrecked, Lady Elliot’s Island, February, 1864; Maria
Yassa, ship (250), April, 1874 ; Fiery Star, burnt at sea,
April 19, 1865 ; Tim Whiffler, second trip (365), June 2,
1875; Great Queensland f508), October 9, 1874; British
Admiral, wrecked May 22, 1874 ; Polmaise (200), lost
February 2, 1865; Gauntlet (308), December 31, 1874;
Sultana, 1864; Artemisia, December, 1848. This list
shows a continuous flow of immigrants for some time, and
it is to be regretted so many disastrous wrecks occurred in
Hervey’s Bay, just in sight of port. The Ariadne, on the
night of October 5, 1862 ; the Paramie, October 7, 1873 ;
and the Fiery Star, burnt at sea, were terrible calamities.
The arrival of immigrant vessels with nice girls gave
opportunities for choosing eligible partners at parties and
balls, for there was much fun after dark at Thacker’s
Hotel, at Geo. Howard’s “ Steam Packet,” and at Durack’s,
where the “ light fantastic ” was kept up till the early
hours of morn. There were clerics who visited Mary-
borough from Gayndah and Brisbane, and one or two-
stationed here, who usually put matters right in matrimony,
and among these I may mention the Rev. B. G. Wilson,
Baptist minister, a kind and thoroughly unbiassed man,
who, with his colleagues, the Revs. J. T. Hinton and S.
Wilson, performed the marriage service for most of the
Protestants who came together from 1850 to 1862 ; whilst
the Roman Catholics had the ministrations of Dean Tissot
from 1856. As the Church of England and other denomi-


NEIL BLUE.


nations are more thoroughly described later on, I need but
add that the Rev. E. Tanner was the first preacher at the
old township, but, having bad health, resigned in favour of
of Rev. Mr. Dodd. Marriages were also performed by the
Registrar, Stanley G. Hill, at the Court House, Mary-
borough. It is a notable fact that up to 1868 there were
no harlots in the streets of Brisbane, and Maryborough was
singularly free from this undesirable class. In most cases
females here “led astray” had but themselves to blame,
since our male residents, though not averse to fun and
frolic, were, as a rule, honourable men, and ever ready to
make amends for any wrong-doing.
But as the curtain of the past descends on the weakness
of a bygone generation, let us raise it on the portraiture of
the present, or New Maryborough, where on the broad
lands we have wrested from Nature architectural beauty
by the hand of Art has obliterated all traces of former
barbarism. Where once the old aboriginal patriarch and
his gins camped at the corner of what are now
known as Kent and Bazaar Streets, we find Stupart’s
Drapery Palace ; whilst further on, where tall arborescent
trees add to the beauty of the Royal Hotel, number-
less teams, laden with wool, once daily arrived. The
Gayndah road at that period was terribly dusty and
droughty in summer, and in winter full of mud and slush,
so that the drivers as well as their bullocks were fairly
entitled to a well-earned drink or feed at Aldridge’s Bush
Inn. Though this house has been remodelled to meet
modern requirements and civilized tastes, there are not
wanting “ old hands ” who quaffed many a tankard in those
early days, and yet revert regretfully to the happy meetings
with chums and boon companions at the Bush Inn, and the
“jolly sprees,” lasting for days, they had. It will take fully
another century to obliterate these blissful memories from
the hearts of the bushmen, “ bull-punchers,” stockriders,
overlanders, shepherds, and shearers of Wide Bay. Some
of the “ yarns ” told at these gatherings would bear repro-
duction were there but space here, and it is with reluctance
that I leave the subject. They were in reality, life stories,
faithfully told. Well did Gordon, the poet, depict scenes
familiar to me at Wide Bay :


’Twas merry in the glowing morn among the gleaming grass,
To wander, as we’ve wandered many a mile;
And blow the cool tobacco cloud, and watch the white wreaths pass,
Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.
’Twas merry in the black woods when we spied the station roofs,
To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,
With a running fire of stockwhips, and a fiery run of hoofs,
Oh ! the hardest day was never then too hard !
Ah, nearly all our comrades of the old colonial school,
Our ancient boon companions, Ned, are yone ;
Hard livers for the most part, somewhat reckless as a rule,
It seems that you and I are left alone!
And mournful too, it is, to contemplate the early fate of
those ancient boon companions, from George Irwin down-
wards. Who now can supply the number of “ loving cups”
drained by such at Aldridge’s, Thacker’s, or Howard’s, with
the usual toast “ Here’s luck !” or “ More of the same sort!”
I do not suppose anyone ever thought of keeping such tally ;
even the barmen are dead, whilst Aldridge, Thacker, and
Howard sleep the sleep of the just in their respective graves.
Men they were, endowed by nature with many virtues and
few faults, remembered still only for the good they did in
their day and generation. The old Blossom Inn is extinct,
not a stone left to mark the site where many a “ howling
spree ” took place. Jack Richmond’s shanty at the Six-
mile has lost its glory, and only remembrance of what has
been remains.
Storekeeping in Maryborough may be considered to have
its origin with Messrs. Uhr, Aldridge, and Dowzer, all of
whom had small establishments in which articles, useful and
necessary for bushmen and stations, were vended; but in
New Maryborough, the first store filled with goods of more
modern attractions for the million, was opened by Mr. Robt.
Travis, who, associated with Mr. Melville, carried on this
business for some time with great success. In the early
fifties, the class of goods required was very different to that
at present. Modern taste and fashion has quite eliminated
the affection we cherished for old time properties, which
were recommended by our grandmothers as protections
against colds ; in clothing especially, these changes are
noticeable, and at present there is no dress, pattern, or
colour chosen, or in request, which was “ all the rage ” in
bygone days. Our bushmen and teamsters no longer use
flint and steel to light their pipes. Bell and Black’s


matches or “ tandstickers ” are cheap enough to waste
in all conscience, and bandana silk kerchiefs are equally
cheap if wanted for crackers on stockwhips. Our female
“ helps ” can now get a dozen yards of print at Harris’ for
the price paid in 1850 for a single yard of inferior material.
Glancing back o’er the vista of the past, do we not observe
how fluctuations of trade made great changes, even in the
drapery line in Maryborough. Cutler and Co., of “ London
House,” Scott, senr., G. H. Nightingale, Buss and Co., R.
Jones, R. Dearnaley, W. Williams, John Graham, Pyne
and Foster, and last but not least, Stupart and Young, and
of all these G. Stupart’s large drapery palace alone sur-
viving ! But not only in drapery and other businesses have
we had startling changes, and men apparently most staunch
and reliable established emporiums of trade which for a
while commanded patronage. Who does not remember
Christoe’s Free Exchange from which so much was expected
when Gympie mines were in the ascendant and so few
dividends declared ? Land was offered for sale in 1865,
which is at the present day in the market, with but few
improvements, and at but small advance on the original
price ; unless in main thoroughfares, acres can be bought
cheap. Mines, including Gympie, to which this city owes
its rapid strides to opulence, are at present recording but
small returns, and new T life, energy, and capital are neces-
sary to restore confidence in the existence of extensive
auriferous reefs or payable alluvial in the Wide Bay district.
But, as nothing earthly stands still, so passes the long pro-
cession of those w r e knew or cared for, and with them many
of our cherished hopes and plans of prosperity. Among the
greatest or most notable changes here are our modes of
traffic; the bullock and horse teams, whereby station pro-
duce was carried to the wharves, and stores returned, often
with long and vexatious delays from the state of the roads.
Now, w 7 e move faster; even “ Cobb’s telegraph line of Royal
Mail coaches” wdiich carried all before them throughout the
colonies, and ran between Maryborough and Gympie, have
made way for railway traffic and greater speed, and better
accommodation in transit. A trip by rail or steamer now
is a treat, as the lines pass through some remarkable but
beautiful scenery which can be viewed leisurely and with
comfort; whilst the coastal steamers cannot be surpassed


for the excellence of their accommodation. ’Buses (Hogg
and Cheyne’s) ply at stated times from Kent Street to
Newtown, going as far as Crocker’s Globe Hotel for Bd.
No need to walk now when such locomotion is provided, or
cabs will go a mile or two for a shilling.
It will perhaps appear remarkable, yet it is a fact, that
the nationalities of the Maryborough people are —English 1,
Scotch 2, Irish 8, Germans and Danes 4, Chinese and
Aliens 5. The Scotch predominate everywhere, and most
of our leading men are of Scotch descent. Hearing this, it
seems strange that the Caledonian Society, a thoroughly
representative national institution, is not better supported
or stronger interest taken in its progress. The Presby-
terian is, undoubtedly, the best supported kirk in Mary-
borough, and whilst other churches have occasionally to
appeal to their adherents to help to increase the funds, the
Presbyterian is reported in good financial position.
As it is well to hear opinions when fairly expressed of our
town or rather “ city” (don’t forget it, ye newspaper scribes
in future), I give the following from an official publication :
“ Maryborough is a large town on the Mary River, 26 miles
from the entrance in Sandy Island Straits. These Straits
are formed by Eraser’s or Great Sandy Island, and named
from Captain Eraser who was murdered there by blacks
when his ship, the Stirling Castle, was wrecked in 1888.
The island is 68 miles long by 14 broad at its widest part,
and three miles at the narrowest. Breaksea Spit, at the
north end, runs out for 19 miles from land. Vessels from
Brisbane for Maryborough enter the Straits over Wide Bay
Bar between Inskip and Hood Points, and thence 28 miles
in to the mouth of the Mary. The natural formation of
this Strait, having Fraser’s Island on one hand and the
mainland on the other, makes it resemble a river, the
various bays in which are a paradise for oysters. There
is little attractive scenery until the farms and cane
plantations near Maryborough are reached. In the early
days the Mary was called “ Wide Bay River,” “ Mooro-
boccoola,” and “ Monooboola.” The aborigines call it
“ Goodna,” “ Yaboon,” “ Coong,” and “ Gooromandah.”
The blacks of the Mary belonged to the “ Mangiburra ”
tribes, and the Fraser Island to the “ Doomdooras.” The
latter had an especially evil repute, and many a shipwrecked


sailor met a cruel death on these shores in bygone days.
The blacks there in 1850 were estimated at 8,000 ; they are
quiet enough now, and the tourist may traverse all this part
without fear. The “ White Cliffs ” is the site of the
quarantine station, and a favourite place for watering
vessels. About three miles further is the Siate Forest
Nursery, established to grow pine trees. Remarkable to
state, no cedar grew on Fraser’s Island, its soil hot being
suitable.
The following incidents are recorded:—“ The first
explorer of the district was Mr. H. S. Russell, of Cecil
Plains, Darling Downs, whilst looking for new pastoral
country. Petrie followed him to seek for new rivers.
These two explorers discovered “ Bracefield ” and the
“ Durham Boy.” In May, 1842, Mr. Jolliffe, one of the
Russell party, took up country near Girkum, and stocked
it with sheep for Mr. Jno. Bales, of Hunter River. Great
destruction of flocks and murders of shepherds caused the
place to be abandoned, till 1847, when Geo. Furbur settled
in the same locality, and started a store and small public-
house. The particulars of Ins sad death are yet in remem-
brance and recorded elsewhere. Surveyor Burnett explored
the river which bears his name in 1847, and reported a fine
site for a town —now Bundaberg. The local squatters of
1848 were —M‘Taggart (Kilkivan), Hawkins (Bonaro),
Lawless (Boobigan), Jones (Baramba), Corfield (Gigoomgan),
Perrier (Degilbo), Herbert (Ban Ban), and Dr. Ramsay
(Cockatoo). In this year the Aurora, cutter, brought a
boiling-down plant to Maryborough to boil down catarrh
sheep from Baramba. This plant was afterwards sold to
Uhr, who entered into this business. In 1840, 1,400 bales
were exported from the old township, and in 1854 the William
Muskin, steamer, was laid on ; first land sale 1852 ; first
newspaper, Wide Bay and Burnett Times, published by Wm.
Keith and Thos. White, March 6, 1860; Maryborough
Chronicle, November, 1860 ; first sawmill started by Sims
and Pettigrew; Maryborough declared a port of entry,
1859; Customs House erected in 1861; discovery of gold
at Gympie in October, 1867 —brought a new and sensational
era of prosperity ; steam traffic between Brisbane, Mary-
borough and Rockhampton, started in 1859 by the A.U.S.N.
Co., with the Tamar, Captain Cottier, commander; Mary-


borough was represented then in Sydney Parliament by the
Hon.W.H. Walsh,M.L.C., and Gilbert Elliott; Maryborough
and Wide Bay Cotton-growing Association, founded Novem-
ber, 1859—capital £B,OOO in £5 shares, afterwards increased
to £5,000f Sir George Bowen visited the district in October,
1860, and found the company progressing. In 1865, the
Maryborough Sugar Company started on 1,000 acres at
Tinana Creek, and made sugar and distilled rum. Sugar-
growing afterwards became universal, and large plantations
were established. The Yengarie Estate was founded by J.
C. White, who also established abattoirs for boiling-down
purposes, but did little till * Tooth and Cran, of Widgee,
began boiling down and making extract of meat. Finally,
they turned it into a vast sugar mill and refinery, which is
still in progress.
The Wide Bay and Burnett districts comprise that part of
Queensland extending coastwise from about 24deg. 40min.
to 26deg. 40min. S. latitude, and from the Pacific Ocean
on the east to the Dividing Range on the west, being fully
150 miles in its greatest width and covering an area of
about 17,000 square miles, or about 11,000,000 acres, being
larger than Wales with the counties of Yorkshire and
Cumberland included. It is encompassed north, south, and
west by continuous mountain ranges which form the water-
shed of the Kolan, Burnett, and Mary rivers, and sharply
mark off the riverine system, thus defined from the systems
of the Brisbane, Darling, and Fitzroy, and other less im-
portant rivers. The sinuous trend of these mountain ranges
gives the district a scolloped or indented outline, causing
the whole to assume somewhat the shape of a vine leaf, of
which the island known as Fraser’s or “ Great Sandy,”
separated from the coast by only a narrow tide way, and
jutting out north-easterly into the Pacific, would be the stalk.
The configuration between these boundary lines is simple.
A coast line trending S.E. and N.W. runs parallel to the
seaboard, at an average distance of between 50 or 60 miles,
and divides the district into two unequal portions. The
f Note —Some of these dates are not quite correct, though from
official sources.
*Note. —ln July, 1873, a consignment of Tooth and Gran’s extract
was actually imported from England to Maryborough—where originally
made—to check the high price charged for cattle in this colony.


smaller of these —or Wide Bay proper—comprises the whole
of the coast region between the last named mountain chain
and the sea, including also Fraser’s Island ; and occupies
about two-fifths of the area of the united districts. It
differs considerably in natural features and climate from
the Burnett proper, which occupies the remaining
three-fifths, and lies wholly to the westward of the
coast range. The Wide Bay portion includes the basins
of the Wary, Kolan, and other small coast rivers, as well
as the country along the lower course of the Burnett,
and since all these rivers have well defined watersheds,
risin" in some instances to considerable altitude, the result
is a pleasing diversity of scenery, as well as an equal dis-
tribution of sites fitted to attract and support population.
The character of the Burnett is more uniform, being of
tolerably level tableland, of an altitude from 1,000 to
1,500 feet above the sea, through which the Upper Burnett
and its tributaries, Baramba, Boyne, Auburn, and others,
pursue their tortuous course. On approaching, however,
the encompassing mountain chain which everywhere borders
this inland river system, the scene changes ; rocky glens
and precipitous cliffs succeed to the gently rolling upland,
and form on all sides a picturesque fringe to its tamer
features. The united w T aters of the Burnett and its
affluents find an escape through the coast ranges, where
they have formed a gorge of considerable length and depth.
The river bed, at this point, contains hardly any w 7 ater
during the greater part of the year, but, after a brief season
of rain, it becomes a raging torrent, dangerous to cross even
in boats, and hurrying along trunks of trees, rocks, debris ,
&c., with irresistible force seaward. A little to the north-
west of this gorge, the coast range culminates in a lofty
peak Mount Perry, buttressed on all sides with mountain
masses of a broken or irregular character, showing signs of
extensive volcanic action, and highly mineralized. These
features are continued, though in a less remarkable degree
to the junction of this vast mountain system with the east
and west chain —Dawes Range—which forms the northern
boundary of the united districts. In this angle the River
Kolan and its tributaries take their rise, and thence pursue
a south-easterly and north-easterly course through cham-
paign country of high pastoral value, finally reaching the


sea to the north-west of the flat, sandy, and marshy delta
country formed by the Burnett. Crossing the latter river
and following the coast, we pass in succession the Elliott,
Gregory, Isis, Cherwell, and Burrum rivers, the last four
forming a connected river system in miniature, and dis-
charging their united waters into Hervey’s Bay. The
latter is a wide inlet of the Pacific, intercepted between
Great Sandy Island and the mainland, open to the north,
and tapering southwards, until it runs into a narrow strait
abounding in shoals and small islands, and opening at the
further extremity into Wide Bay, whence the maritime
portion of the district takes its name. At the point where
Hervey s Bay merges into the narrow tidal channel referred
to, it receives the waters of the Mary River ; the sources of
which are in a lofty and densely wooded chain of mountains
forming part of the southern boundary of the district. The
Mary pursues a northerly course, collecting a number of
affluents, and draining the wide valley, which extends
between the principal coast range, and a secondary range of
the same kind parallel to the former but nearer the sea-
board. Returning to the coast, and pursuing a direction
southward from Sandy Strait, we reach a line of dunes, or
sandhills, extending south to Point Arkwright, where the
Durundur Range, which bounds the district to the south,
abruptly falls off to the ocean. Behind these dunes,
separated from the open sea, is an inlet or branch known as
“ Tin Can,” or, as the natives call it, “ Tinkun Bay.” Here
a continuous chain of lagoons, shallow creeks, and swamps
prevail, chief outlet for this intercepted drainage is
at Laguna Bay, where a gap in the sandhills permits the
tide to sweep in and out, and forms a port—“ Noosa ”
accessible to vessels of light draught.
Territorially, the district is divided into the counties of
Bowen, Cook, March, Lennox, Fitzroy, Mackenzie, New-
castle, and Wicklow ; and politically into the electorates of
Mulgrave, Maryborough, Wide Bay, Gympie, and Burnett.
The line which divides the “ settled ” from the “ unsettled”
portion of the district connects with the boundary between
the maritime and the inland division, or Wide Bay proper,
and the district of Burnett proper.
The principal centres of population are :—Maryborough,
the capital; Gayndah, the earliest settled township;


Gympie, headquarters of the gold-mining industry ; Mount
Perry, occupying a similar position in the copper industry ;
Bundaberg, a port of entry and agricultural emporium at
the mouth of the Burnett; and Nanango, a small hamlet on
the Upper Baramba Creek, near the southern verge of the
district. Telegraph lines now extend to these and all other
places of importance, whilst the main roads, once so busy
in dray traffic, are now almost abandoned, by reason of the
greater facility afforded to the travelling public by railways.
Traversed by the 25th and 26th parallels of south lati-
tude, and extending not more than 150 miles inland, these
districts enjoy on the whole a mild and equable climate.
Excessive heat is less common than in other parts of
Queensland, and the growth of vegetation is promoted by
an abundant rainfall, most copious near the coast. The
summer months are October, November, December, January,
and February, during which a strong dry heat with vivid
sunshine prevails, broken however, by occasional thunder-
storms and electrical disturbances of singular fierceness.
This torrid season is followed by a rainy one of about six
weeks’ duration, the moist heat at the beginning being very
trying to new comers, who thoroughly appreciate the more
genial and enjoyable season which commences in April
when nature resumes its tranquility with the so-called
“ winter.” In July, 1896, the thermometer stood at 26deg.,
and at daybreak the hills and plains were covered with hoar
frost. This Arctic state of affairs was usually changed ere
midday when the sun shone forth with great brilliancy and
intense heat, affording a marked contrast to the severity of
the night’s cold. Floods which did not trouble the early
settlers much, have of late been frequent, though these
visitations have caused more annoyance and inconvenience
than actual damage, and settlers are now sufficiently fami-
liarized with them to secure themselves against very heavy
losses.
In a country marked by so many prominent natural
features, considerable diversity of scenery must exist, and
the same holds good of the comparative value of different
portions for settlement and cultivation, some areas being
doomed to perpetual sterility, whilst on others nature has
bestowed her choicest treasures without stint. The sea
coasts generally are somewhat tame, though their monotony


is agreeably relieved by tall peaks and densely wooded
mountain ranges at no great distance inland, and by the
exuberance of bird life peopling the secluded bays and
inlets, or the broad foreshores and mangrove covered islands
and mud patches in Hervey’s Bay and the neighbouring
strait. Great Sandy Island is, as its name denotes, a mass
of sand, rising on the east side into peaks some hundreds of
feet in elevation, densely wooded in some parts, notwith-
standing its uncompromising and barren soil. Along the
central ridge are numerous springs, which, forming creeks,
swamps, and miniature lakes assist in maintaining luxuriant
undergrowth of vegetation differing in many respects from
the adjacent mainland. The island is in theory maintained
as a kind of native reserve, where the remnant of the abori-
ginal tribes for a considerable distance along the coast may
congregate, and follow their immemorial habits and tra-
ditions without molestation. The “ privilege of sanctuary”
thus accorded, has, however, been greatly encroached upon
by parties of lumberers who rapidly cleared off all the best
timber, and destroyed in corresponding degree the sylvan
seclusion of the island.
Returning to the mainland, it is found that the pre-
valent character of vegetation and scenery is similar to all
parts of Queensland. The general groundwork is open
forest, comprising various species of eucalyptus, acacia,
angophora, exocarpus, casuarina, Banksia, and other sombre-
hued trees, bearing the impress of that dull monotony which
as a rule characterises the Australian landscape. But with
all this, there are in its semi-tropical parts, at intervals,
patches of dense and luxuriant forest growth, corresponding
to the “ jungles ” of the Indian and Malay Archipelago,
teeming with Asiatic and oceanic forms of vegetation.
These “ scrubs, as they are locally termed, are of two
kinds, one lining the banks of rivers and affecting alluvial
ground, the other clothing ridges or rocky hills to the height
of fully 1000 feet. The riverine or alluvial scrub is invari-
ably a sign of rich soil, as well as of sites liable to inun-
dation. The mingled vegetation of figs, laurels, eugenias,
and other innumerable evergreens with bright glossy
foliage, festooned with passion flowers, wild vines, climbers,
and creepers of all sorts with exquisitely coloured and
scented blossoms cannot but attract the beholder, whilst the


funereal-looking Araucarias tower high above the gay pro-
fusion of glinting leafage and brilliant flora, struggling
upwards to the sunlight, and forming a striking and lovely
contrast to the uniform green of the open forest, amid which
these oases of tropical vegetation occur. The line of demar-
cation is, in a great majority of instances, sharply defined;
here, the forest with endless vistas of silver grey or salmon
coloured trunks and scant shadeless boughs, through which
the sun seems to dart with redoubled intensity on the
parched turf or dusty yellow road ; there, a dense tangled
mass of emerald foliage, impenetrable to the gaze, rising
abruptly like a wall before the traveller, who unable to cut
a path through these vine entangled shades, is oft compelled
to make a detour of many miles. The “ mountain
jungle,” as it is designated, is less dense, but owing to
the preponderance of thorny twining plants is equally
troublesome to get through; bush fires have, however,
materially aided the work of clearing, but have also
destroyed myriads of seedling plants; whereas the alluvial
scrub, owing to excessive moisture, forms a complete barrier
against fire, even in the driest seasons. The principal con-
tinuous areas of alluvial scrub are found between the Lower
Burnett and the Mary. The whole of the country watered
by the Burrum and its affluents was, until partly cleared
for progress settlement, densely clothed with them, and
there are also immense tracts in the southern part of the
district between Kilkivan, Gympie, and Maroochie. When
first taken up, the River Mary was fringed with scrub to a
considerable breadth on either side. The Burnett scrubs,
where they follow the river, are generally much narrower,
but compact areas ; some hundreds of square miles are met
with at no great distance from Walla downwards. The
“ hill scrub ” is found, more or less, on all the ranges
within about forty miles of the sea, and in the south of the
district, where the towering Bunya bunya (Araucaria
Bidwillii J luxuriates in a damp and steaming atmosphere,
and red cedar is here and there found ; the two descriptions
of jungle are closely blended. In striking contrast to the
tropical luxuriance of the scrub, is the so-called “ Wallum
country,” sandy, ill-watered, barren tracts, found adjacent
to the coast, and presenting the appearance of having
formerly consisted of mud-flats, sand dunes, and brackish


swamps, similar to those near the ocean. These “Wallum”
patches support great clumps of dry, harsh and useless
vegetation, interspersed with stunted Casuarinas and
Banksias, the whole characterised by an aspect of dismal
monotony, and presenting no landmarks to guide the
traveller —hence the frequency with which men have lost
themselves whilst attempting to thread these wildernesses,
and often only being rescued by kindly aborigines, whom
good fortune or Providence sent to their aid opportunely.
On the plateau of the Upper Burnett and its tributaries
extensive tracts of rich arable land, almost destitute of
trees, and resembling in parts the black soil country of the
Darling Downs, occur. The mountain scenery on the
borders is characterised by savage grandeur, and abounds in
picturesque and romantic views which would captivate poet
and painter. This is especially the case in the north-
western angle of the district between the Mount Perry and
Dawson watershed, where rugged tablelands, broken up by
a succession of deep glens into lines of cliffs hundreds of
feet high, have at their bases brawling torrents tumbling
onward in a succession of snowy cascades. But the grandest
display of majestic and lovely landscapes is revealed in
travelling overland from Gympie to Brisbane, or vice versa .
Though many natural beauties are seen when passing
through them by train, it is well known much is lost to
those who have never visited the metropolis by the old road,
and travelled as was customary in bygone days on foot, on
horseback, or bullock team. The road follows the seaward
slope of the coast range, thus offering a constant succession
of combined marine and mountain views, a panorama per-
haps second to none other in romantic associations with any
part of the world.
In natural productions, these districts do not differ
materially from others in Australia having similar climate.
The animal kingdom presents the usual marsupials—
kangaroo, wallaby, native bears, and the myriad rat and
mouse, “ small deer ”of the same order; flying foxes, bats,
the echidna, or porcupine ant-eater, dingoes, wombat and
platypus, the latter now rare are seldom met with; but the
brief lists of animals is atoned for by the gorgeous profusion
and variety of the feathered tribes. These are—eagles,
kites, hawks, crows, pigeons of all sorts, owls, parrots,


curlews, cockatoos, bustards, turkeys, bower birds, laughing
jackass, emus, and others too numerous to enumerate ;
whilst most streams are alive with ducks, swans, pelicans,
storks, snipe, divers, &c. Reptiles include those harmless
and venomous, lizards, iguanas, frogs, toads, snakes, land
and water tortoises, and the fish-like reptile the “ceratodus,”
which inhabits the Upper Mary and its affluents. Crocodiles
have also been captured near the Mary, but are supposed to
have travelled here from other localities. The insect world
is very well represented, and only kept in check by birds
which prey on them. Scorpions, centipedes and spiders
abound, whilst beetles of various colours are more admired
at a distance than for their value ; fire-flies are also visible
at night, especially in close and rainy weather. Fruit is
liable to attacks from insect pests, some of which bore to
its interior with great persistency. Among the finny tribes,
rock cod and kingfish claim pre-eminence in size. They
are very plentiful at certain seasons, as are also mullet,
which come into the estuaries and rivers from the sea and
are captured and brought for sale to Maryborough by
aborigines or adventurous fishermen. Rock oysters abound
in the mangrove lined inlets of Hervey’s and Tin Can bays,
and all other sea delicacies are plentiful. The whole of this
trade and conservation of our fisheries is under supervision
of Captain Boult, a gentleman of large experience in
piscatorial matters, and well fitted for the office.
Among special industries, the timber trade occupies a
prominent place, and from the day the first settlers arrived
to the present time, the felling of trees for various purposes
has gone on uninterruptedly. Millions of feet of timber
have not only been shipped to other parts, but both Burnett
and Wide Bay have absorbed and utilised a like quantity, so
that the vast forests have been gradually thinned of the
best trees, and we must now either use the residue left or
wait patiently the growth of others suitable for our purposes.
In a bygone day both open forest and a dense jungle fur-
nished useful timbers, either for strength, utility, or orna-
ment. Cedar, the most valuable of Australian woods, was
once abundant, but is now getting scarce ; the grevillea, or
silky oak, useful for casks, has disappeared, and many of
the valuable scrub timbers have been exterminated in the
process of clearing the land for agriculture. The inlets of


the coasts and banks of the tidal rivers are fringed with
mangrove, avicennia, and other shore plants, among which
is the ill reputed exccecaria , an euphorbacious shrub, whose
milky juice is used by some Oceanic tribes to poison their
arrows, the least wound from which is said to prove fatal.
Inland the waters are fringed with hibiscus aegiceras;
Moreton Bay chestnut, with its pendant laburnum-like
foliage and flame-coloured blossom ; aromatic melaleucas,
with white, pink, or crimson flowers, and paper-like bark,
and brilliant eugenias rich and glossy in the sunlight, aiding
in blending in one vast picture all the shades of pink,
scarlet, gold and green. The lowland pastures are spangled
in their season with hundreds of pretty orchids, lillies, blue-
bells, ranunculus, vetches, and wild indigo; whilst in the
shade of secluded dells tree-ferns spread their graceful
fronds, and the noble corypha and Kentia palms rear high
their feathery heads, and impart a tropical character
to the landscape. Near the sea coast associating with
zamias and cycads, Banksias, casuarinas and epachrids,
the Screw Pine or Pandanus rises high and matures its large
cones of scarlet fruit. Native fruits of several species occur
in and on the borders of the scrub, and among these are the
wild lime, the native guava, the Owenia or sweet plum,
papaw, the carissa or “ cream fruit,” physalis or winter
cherry. In the hill scrubs, the Delabechea or “bottle-tree”
of the stercliaceous order, remarkable for its bulging trunk,
softness of wood, abundance of sap, and edible farina in its
cells, flourishes. Here also numerous species of wild figs
yield abundance of milky juice which becomes an elastic
gum on hardening. The araucarinas, dammaras, and
podocarpus, or pines, abound in turpentine, which exudes
from the bark wherever wounded, and collects in masses at
the lower part of the trunk. Sarsaparilla from the similax
plant abounds, whilst in the deeper recesses of the jungle
gay coloured epiphytes cluster on to the lina-bound trunks,
and the “ staghorn ” and “ bird’s nest ” ferns add a grace
and charm to the world of natural curiosities of the spot
where the calymus or creeping-palm flings its festoons from
branch to branch, and furnishes a much-prized material for
walking-canes or whip sticks. On the poorer uplands the
acacia is prominent, and supplies valuable tannin material,
whilst the bitter gum resin of some eucalypti has a high


medicinal value. Probably as time goes on this and other
products of the vegetable kingdom will prove important
articles of commerce.
But it is not wholly in its vegetation that the wealth of
the district consists. Nearly every metallic ore known to
science abounds, in some instances of productive quality, in
others of scanty proportions, though doubtless eventually
capital and energy will develop many of the yet unworked
lodes of auriferous ores or vast reefs which spread like a net-
work of veins over miles of country, of which Gympie may
be regarded as the starting-point. The principal workings
up to the present are at Kilkivan, Black Snake, Jimna,
Yabba, Nanango, Reid’s Creek, Yarrol, Rawbelle, Cania,
Degilbo, Gigoomgan, Manumbar, and Ban Ban, whilst good
alluvial has been met with north and west of Mount Perry
and other spots on the Dawson.
But whilst gold undoubtedly is more attractive to obtain
than other metals, it must not be forgotten that these dis-
tricts teem with copper, an equally useful material which is
now lying dormant owing to the low price in the English
markets. The same remarks apply to the great copper
fields of Burra Burra and Moonta in South Australia, both
being at a stand-still for want of a market for these products.
Silver, combined with lead, has been found in various parts,
whilst cinnabar covers a long range of country on the River
Mary and the main coast, extending from Traveston to
Gigoomgan in opposite directions. Antimony lodes have
also been tested in the Wide Bay and Burnett districts with
good results, but are now abandoned for other more neces-
sary and remunerative ores. Prominent among these are
coal, the surface indications from Miva southward and
Bunda north covering a vast area —especially round Burrum
and the Upper Mary. Among the valuable outcrops are
cobalt, plumbago, fire-clay. Precious stones, such as
diamonds and rubies, have been found by prospectors in the
Auburn and other streams, and future prospectors and
explorers will probably turn some of these to account and
profit.
It is much to be regretted that the first attempts at settle-
ment should have been marred by scenes of bloodshed, and
that from the year 1886, when the captain and crew of the
ship Stirling Castle met their fate at the hands of the


Fraser’s Island savages, the path of progress has been
marked by outrage and bloodshed, and that attempts to
bring the wilderness under subjugation by the husbandman,
has been accomplished only by loss of life and failure.
Passing by the Fraser’s Island episode, depicted elsewhere,
we find the first regular explorers of these districts were
Messrs. H. S. Bussell, of Cecil Plains; Jolliffe, of the Royal
Navy, and W. Wrottesley, M.L.C., of New South Wales,
who explored the whole coast, on the rivers Brisbane, Mary
and Fitzroy. In this year, led by Davis, or “Durham Boy,”
Mr. Jolliffe took up runs near Badlow for Mr. Jno. Bales,
and stocked them with sheep. The blacks, being very
treacherous and ferocious, compelled Mr. Jolliffe to abandon
his office, and he was succeeded by Mr, Last, who likewise
fell a victim with several shepherds to his adventurous spirit
and intrepedity, and the station, owing to the continued
hostility of the natives, was then broken up. From this
time, and after the arrival of the late Mr. E. T. Aldridge
and Messrs. H. and R. E. Palmer, advance toward settle-
ment was but slow, though within three years the stations
of Merodian, Barambah, Burandowan, Manumbar, Wetheron
and Mondure were occupied and held by adventurous
squatters. But it was not till 1847, when the rudiments of
the future town of Maryborough were established by George
Furbur, of Ipswich, at a place since known as “ Rose
Hill,” that Kilkivan, Boobigan, Degilbo, Bonaro, Ban Ban,
Boondamba, Taabinga, Dykehead, Hawkwood and Gin Gin
sprung to note. These, however, were followed by an influx
of new pastoralists, and the taking up of much vacant
country on the Burnett and other localities. The presence
of a fine navigable river probably formed a great inducement
for new settlers from the neighbouring colonies. Tinana,
on the south bank of the river, became a rallying point for
shearing, or boiling-down of flocks from distant stations,
communication with the south being kept up by a small
trading schooner, the Aurora. Eventually the settlement
was moved to the spot known as the “old township,” but
made only slow progress, till, through the energy and
obstinacy of Mr. Labott, Government surveyor, the popula-
tion were induced to migrate en masse to the present site
as more preferable. Gayndah, long counted the inland
metropolis of the district, can advance equal claims to


antiquity with Maryborough, having been founded in 1849
by Mr. Le Breton, to whom belongs the doubtful honour of
establishing the first public house. From 1858, w T hen the
new settlement at Gladstone attracted population to the
district, down to the date of Separation, its history is
almost a blank. The whole population, with few exceptions,
were engaged in pastoral pursuits, and “ settlement,” in the
true acceptation of the term, there was none save within
the surveyed townships of Maryborough, Gayndah and
Nanango. The land agitation which succeeded the emanci-
pation of the colony from New South Wales, paved the
way for measures which led to permanent occupation and a
vast increase in the productive wealth of the district. In
consequence of the passing of the Land Act of 1868, a
substantial agricultural reserve was proclaimed on the
Eiver Mary and Tinana Creek, and under that Statute, as
well as the succeeding one of 1866, considerable frontages
were taken up and partly cleared and cultivated. The
discovery of the adaptability of the climate and soil to the
growth of cotton, maize and sugar, gave increased value to
land, and impetus to its occupation. But it was not till the
more liberal Land Act of 1868 had extended the available
area that settlement and its concomitant industries began to
exhibit anything like the proportions they now hold. Until
that period intending settlers were confined to Mary River
Agricultural Reserve, and to such scraps and parings of
land in the vicinity of other towns as the Government would
allot for this purpose. But with the passing of the new
Land Act the change came ; whilst the discovery of the
Gympie goldfield in 1867, when the Land Bill was under
debate, was the means of pouring a large population into
these districts, and creating new townships with auxiliary
belts of agricultural settlement. River frontages then were
greatly in demand, and fetched high figures, so that* about
1870 the scrub lands on the Lower Burnett, Burrum and
Noosa rivers were taken up, and the townships of Bunda-
berg and Tewantin sprang into existence. The universal
mania of 1872 caused a more thorough exploration of
country, and left as a residuum the township of Mount
Perry, with its adjacent mines ; Kilkivan, iwith Mount
Clara and Mount Cora mines, as well as several other
valuable mining properties elsewhere which yet only await


the investment of capital to become profitable and ensure
many settlers.
The demand for land in this quarter has for years been
unabated, and settlement has proceeded at a rapid rate,
limited only by areas from time to time opened for selection.
The river scrubs are not only nearly all taken up and
cleared, but are in many parts under cultivation for maize,
sugar cane, &c. The settlers and farmers are mostly of
German and Danish origin, interspersed with a fair propor-
tion of English, Scotch and Irish.
As the first settlers devoted their time chiefly to the
rearing of sheep and cattle, for many years the export trade
from the port was confined to wool, hides and tallow. At
first sheep was the principal stock, but now on all stations
east of the Main Range they have been replaced by cattle,
the comparatively moist climate of the coast not being con-
genial to sheep, and the rapid encroachment of spear-grass,
the seed of which proved destructive to young lambs, and
also deteriorated greatly from the value of the wool. After
the passing of the Land Act of 1868, large resumptions
were made from the squattages east of the Main Range, this
having the effect of reducing pastoral pursuits within the
area thus affected to a position of subordinate importance.
Beyond the boundary of the “ settled ” districts, however,
the runs have continued intact, the freehold encroachments
being limited to mineral selections, though it is well-known
there are large tracts of land suitable for agriculture round
Gayndah, Nanango, Degilbo and other places.
It is at once perceptible that cultivation is limited to the
maritime portion of the district. The chief farming
localities are the valleys of the Burnett, Burrum and Mary,
and the lacustrine region to which Noosa Bay forms an
outlet. On the Burnett and Burrum, maize is the chief
product, whilst on the Mary saccharine produce gives em-
ployment to many mills (described later on). A few years
back, oats, barley and lucerne were cultivated for local wants,
but not sufficient to keep out southern importations.
Tobacco has thriven well, but, for want of a market, is
neglected as a crop, whilst cotton, once cultivated exten-
sively, is now seldom heard of. Arrowroot and cassava
(mandioc) used to yield well, but have never yet taken a
place among local industries. Among our local fruits the


banana and pineapple are most abundant, whilst the citrus
tribe flourish, and are in demand by buyers from “ down
south,” who reap the profit which would accrue to growers
who should combine in establishing the long-mooted, but
never tangible, preserving factory. Wheat and other cereals
have grown well over the Burrum and hill country south of
Gjmpie, and all the European and sub-tropical vegetables
are successfully cultivated.
The shipping and commercial interests of the district are
aggregated at the ports of Maryborough, Bundaberg and
Noosa. Maryborough exports gold, hides, tallow, sugar,
rum, copper, antimony, timber, &c.; Bundaberg, chiefly
maize, sugar, timber, molasses and copper ore ; Noosa,
almost exclusively timber. Imports to all the ports com-
prise general merchandise, limestone, pig iron, sugar, mats,
and other articles required in manufacturing establishments.
The A.S.N. Co.’s steamers were once the chief vehicles of
the shipping trade, but there are now two rival companies
(the A.U.S.N. and Howard Smith and Co.), with excellent
steamers to take the traveller to any part of the world he
may wish. In addition to a local fleet of smaller crafts,
coastal vessels, &c., there is now railway communication
with the metropolis or far north ports, and full cargoes of
goods arrive periodically from England to order of local
storekeepers, merchants and others.
Up to 1870 the census of population in these districts
was unknown, but it was assumed that at that period the
population was fully 22,000, distributed in the following
ratio :—Maryborough and vicinity, 9,000; Gympie and
Kilkivan, 7,000; Noosa and surrounding farms, 500;
Gayndah and vicinity, 600 ; Mount Perry, 1,800 ; Bunda-
berg, 1,000; Nanango, 400; pastoral stations, 1,500;
Fraser’s Island and Tin Can Bay, 300; mariners and
roving population, 700.
The Burnett District
is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean. It stretches
westward to the mountain range which forms its western
boundary. The most important point of interest is north-
ward on the coast, Great Sandy (more familiarly known as
Fraser’s) Island, which forms Hervey’s Bay. This island is


about fifty miles long, and is separated from the mainland
at its southern point only by a narrow channel, unnavigable
except by vessels of limited draught; large ones have to
proceed northward and round the northern point; thence
directing their course inland and southward, they reach
Maryborough twenty-five miles from its mouth. The dis-
trict is mountainous, with rich and fertile valleys and flats,,
intersected by numberless small streams, tributaries of the
Mary and Burnett rivers. The Burnett runs through the
district ; the Mary from the south has a north-east course
and empties into the southern portion of Hervey’s Bay.
The Burnett rises in the western range, and flowing easterly
debouches into Hervey’s Bay at its upper portion opposite
the north part of Fraser’s Island. The chief centres of
trade in these districts are Maryborough, Bundaberg,
Ningha, Gayndah, Gympie, Mount Perry and Nanango.
The products of the Burnett are sugar cane, cotton, ginger,
maize and arrowroot, and mines of wealth embracing coal,,
copper, gold, silver, tin, and other ores have been worked to
advantage. It is needless to enlarge on these, as they are
fully described elsewhere.
The Burnett and Wide Bay districts lie between those of
Moreton and Port Curtis, the Pacific Ocean bounding all the
eastern portion, and they are principally occupied for
pastoral purposes —(in this division Fraser’s Island is in-
cluded). Soil and climate are eminently suited to the
growth of tropical productions, such as sugar, cotton, arrow-
root, ginger, &c., whilst at present sugar is the staple in-
dustry, though there are still large exports of wool, tallow,,
hides and other station products as of yore. It is a pity
that cotton-growing was abandoned, and that maize is not
more cultivated. Sericulture is also an industry for which
there is a great future, and the like may be said of beetroot.
(These matters are fully dealt with in the section devoted to
“ Local Industries,” which appears further on). The yield
of sugar for 1878 was 8,258 tons, 111,270 gallons of
molasses, and 54,489 gallons of rum.
The Mary River is a fine stream, and has numerous
tributaries which add to its volume in flood-time. Among
these are the Kolan, Burnett, Susan, and other subsidiary
streams. It follows a south-west course through moun-
tainous and romantic country, and is estimated to cover an
area of 7,740 miles, or 4,958,600 acres,


The Port Curtis district, of which Gladstone is the
capital, lies north of the Burnett, from which it is separated
by Dawes Range, on which Mount Perry is situated. Its
area is fully 15,000 square miles, or 9,818,400 acres. The
Dawson, Boyne, Calliope and Fitzroy rivers, with their
tributaries, flow through this country, and it is intersected
by the Central Railway. Chief towns —Rockhampton,
Yaamba, Marlborough, Gladstone, and Gainsford. The
Broad Sound, Connors, and Boomer’s ranges separate Port
Curtis from the Leichhardt district on the north-east. The
highest peaks in the Gounor’s Range are 3,000 ft. above the
sea level.
The indigenous timber of the Wide Bay district is cedar,
red, white and blue gum, tulip, stringy and ironbark,
Moreton Bay pine, Cyprus and kauri pine, acacia, rosewood,
myrtle, myall, bloodwood, silky oak, ash, box, red ash,
tulip, beech, sandalwood, and others of more or less value
and utility. All the northern scrubs or jungles teem with
verdure, and the wealth of timber, not only to the present
generation, but to those who come after them, is a boundless
heritage from Nature. The fern tribe is also w T ell repre-
sented, having upwards of sixty varieties. In 1877 timber
from Wide Bay was exported, valued at T85,629; all the
woods hereabouts are of great utility for constructive pur-
poses, especially cabinet work and furniture, being beauti-
fully grained, and capable of taking a high polish
Maryborough is essentially a very healthy locality ; the
climate resembles Madeira, and there is an absence of the
distressing hot winds so prevalent at night in the southern
colonies. At times the thermometer runs up to 90deg , but
seldom at its highest reaches the century. Copious rains
fall during the hottest months, thus creating a low and more
pleasing temperature, and renovating the vegetation. At
times when there is an excess of the pluvial discharge at
Gympie to other high lands, the Mary River rises and over-
flows, and on more than one occasion has included the town
in its inundations. A great deal of such catastrophes will,
however, be averted in the future by the adoption of mea-
sures which common sense and judgment suggest. Epi-
demics here are rare, and the general health of the people
is good, as shown by hospital and medical reports. The
record on the tombs of some of the old residents is from 75


to 90 years, and even 100 years is reported of one venerable
lady. The mammalia comprises kangaroos, opossums, bandi-
coots, wombats, dingoes, flying foxes, native cats, &c.
Snakes are plentiful, and some kinds are venomous and
deadly ; alligators and crocodiles have been found north-
ward ; the birds are—pigeons, ducks, kingfishers,
black swans, turkey, quail, eagle, emu, bustard, crane,
heron, parrots (twenty varieties), cockatoo ; the fish are— ■
schnapper, eel, codfish, mullet, jewfish, catfish, bream, seal,
shark, turtle and dugong; oysters, crabs and other crusta-
ceans ; the fruits are—pineapple, guava, banana, orange,
citron, grape, lemon, doradella, melon, fig, mango, passion-
fruit, pawpaw, loquat and others ; but English fruits, like
English flowers, do not attain the perfection they do “ down
south.” Though cereals are not much cultivated and
largely imported, there is little doubt they will meet with
greater attention in the near future, and tobacco, arrowroot,
rice, coffee and sweet potatoes also receive greater attention,
as both climate and soil are favourable to their growth.
Some, indeed most parts, of these districts have a tragic
interest for the present generation, since the path of the
pioneer settlers who laid the foundation of our prosperity
and colonisation was pursued through bloodshed and assassi-
nation by relentless savages, who fought for their rights and
disputed the incursion of the white races into their territory.
The Mary River and Wide Bay 0
Like other places on the seaboard, Maryborough has its
fashionable ocean resort in Pialba, where, on holidays, our
local citizens seek change of air and relief from business
care and office confinement. Pialba is twenty-four miles
from Maryborough, in Hervey’s Bay, a large inlet of the
Pacific Ocean, open to the sea on the north and tapering to
a point on the south, having length and breadth to include
the mouth of the Mary River, the opening into Great Sandy
Strait and White Cliffs. The eastern limb of the scalene
triangle, a figure which roughly describes the bay, is formed
by Fraser’s Island, the western by the mainland ; at the apex
of the triangle, the Mary empties her magnificent stream
into the bay, which, further on northwards, receives the


lesser volume of the Burrum, a river of no great size, but
of fame, as the source of supply of the celebrated Burrum
coal. In addition to a large mining population, the spot is
being rapidly settled by the agriculturist and dairy farmer.
Near this, is Toogoom, the cattle station of Messrs. Fred
Slater and H. Aldridge. Several islands adorn the bay, but
the largest, Great Woody Island, is about five miles long
by a mile in breadth. It is regarded as a place of im-
portance, as it has lighthouse, pilot, and telegraph stations,
all being connected with the mainland by submarine cable.
Besides its official population, Great Woody is inhabited by
numberless rabbits turned loose there in a bygone day by
Messrs. Sheridan and Buchanan. There are also Angora
goats, which seem to have multiplied considerably. Pialba
consists of three terraces, viz., Walhalla, formerly owned by
ihe late Mr. Kehlet, a working jeweller, afterwards land-
lord of the Royal Hotel, and since deceased, and Messrs.
Watson and Southerden, storekeepers, of local fame.
Facing Walhalla, is excellent bathing, and on the sands
bathing shelters used to do duty instead of machines.
But the Pialba of to-day is very much more progressive
than in 1870. Formerly the amusements there were but
nominal, and if the visitor was a stranger, the greatest
attraction was sea bathing, or gathering shells on the shore.
To the southward and eastward of Walhalla are the late
Messrs. Wearin’s and Corser’s selections, the late Mr. E. T.
Aldridge’s, Mr. J. E. Brown’s selection, Bulgul Creek, and
three miles inland, Mr. B. Martin’s farm. Of Towzey’s
row of cottages, in which many lovers spent their honey-
moon, nought but rums remain. By the time this book is
issued, Pialba will be connected with Maryborough by rail;
it is, therefore, imperative it should be more fully described
further on. The branch railway, Colton to Pialba, is
sixteen miles forty-seven chains long. Tenders for its con-
struction were accepted March, 1896. A level road, good in
dry weather and easily travelled, unless the Susan is up,
leads from Saltwater Creek (the municipal boundary), to the
sandy beaches by the sea.
Great Hervey’s Strait is a long and narrow strip of water,
connecting Hervey’s Bay on the north, with Wide Bay on
the south, and dividing Fraser’s Island from the mainland.
A number of small creeks —Poonab, Cowra and others —fall


into this Strait, near the southern extremity of which is Tin
Can Bay, famed for its timber and railway. The latter was
the work of the late Mr. Sim, of Dundathu sawmills, to
bring the extensive kauri pine scrubs at Tin Can Bay within
reach of rafting ground.
Between the southernmost point of Fraser’s Island and
the mainland is the well-known Wide Bay Bar, which
instead of being, as supposed, at the mouth of the Mary
River, is forty miles from it, and divides the modern
nautical Wide Bay from Hervey and Sandy Straits. Both
bays, as well as all waters around the coast, abound with
fish, oysters, crabs, and even dugong. The latter once
formed an important industry and gave plenty of employ-
ment to local fishermen, but the discontinuance of the trade
has caused new men with new labour and capital to be in-
vested with a view to its re-establishment.
Fraser’s, or Great Sandy, Island has an area of 250
square miles or 832,000 acres. It was once inhabited by
one of the most ferocious and sanguinary of coast tribes ;
is now settled and civilized, and large supplies of fine timber
are yet drawn from it as in the past, to be utilized at the
several mills elsewhere referred to.
The Sugar Factory Company erected machinery for sugar
refinery, and are starting the work. The machinery was
erected under the superintendence of Mr. Wiseman, the
company’s manager. During the crushing season, 400 tons
of cane have arrived at the factory by road, carried by dray
and 500 by punt. One farmer alone hauled eighty-five
tons from Pialba to the factory. So pleased are the com-
pany with the cane from Pialba, which yielded 10J
density, that they have entered into contracts with twenty-
six of the farmers for cane from 220 acres, and for 500
for the season of 1897,
Mr. T. Bromiley, of Pialba, brought to Maryborough in
February, 1896, specimens of an English pineapple,
weighing 91b., and showing the splendid fruit-growing
capabilities of Pialba. He has a large crop this year, so large
that he feeds his cows on them, and he says such food gives
a large percentage of cream. He also showed several fine
samples of the “ strawberry mango,” a most delicious fruit,
much superior to the ordinary rose mango. It is of a more
oval shape, the seed is flatter and allows more of the fleshy


fruit, in which there is no fibre. There should be a large
demand for these when placed upon the market. Mr.
Bromiley’s coffee trees are a great success this year, the crop
of berries being very large and fine.
Early Explorations and Naval Pioneers.
According to the charts of 1527 of the northern coast of
Australia, the Dutch and Spaniards were the first navigators
and discoverers. Port Curtis and the Burnett River are in
their maps set down as “ Rios de beaucoup d’isles ” (rivers
of many islands). This inscription was afterwards altered
to “Ribera de muchas islas ” (coast of many islands).
Great Sandy Island on Tasman’s maps of 1642 shows that
Wide Bay was known at that time as a haven of refuge for
coastal craft.
The first regular explorer of the Wide Bay district was
probably Mr. H. S. Russell, late of Cecil Plains Station,
Darling Downs, who is still alive, and residing in England.
Mr. Russell arrived in Moreton Bay in 1842, in the same
steamer with Governor Gipps, of New South Wales, whose
visit made for the purpose of proclaiming the Moreton
district a free settlement. He had, prior to this time, whilst
in search of new runs for stock, decided to examine the
coast north of Moreton Bay, and, having purchased a small
craft for the purpose, sailed northward, having as his com-
panions a fellow passenger from the Shamrock, the Hon. W.
Wrottesley and J. Jolliffe, of the Royal Navy. At this time the
late Mr. Petrie, then superintendent of Government works
in Brisbane, who had discovered the “ Araucaria Bidwilli,”
or Bunya Bunya pine, reported on that timber and the value
of its seed-cones to the blacks as an article of food, and had
represented the hostility which would be excited against the
w hites if these trees were cut dowm by timber-getters. In
order to examine the country about the district in which
this tree only grew, the Governor instructed Mr. Petrie to
examine the Morouchidor (river of swans), known to run
into the sea north of Bribie’s Island, with all other sur-
rounding country. Mr. Russell consented to undertake this
exploration on condition of securing help to enable his party
to carry out their original purpose, and they set out in a


wretched boat called the Commandant’s gig, 32ft. long,
seven oars, and manned by seven prisoners. The attempt
to enter the Morouchidor River failed in consequence of the
strong surf on its bar; so, coasting northwards, the party
reached what they thought was Hervey’s Bay, and, having
landed, camped there some days to seek for a white man
whom they had heard was living with the blacks. Their
search was brought to an early conclusion by the white man
(named Bracefield), voluntarily coming to their camp. He
was called “ Wandi ” by the blacks, and spoke the languages
of four different tribes. In honour of this man, they named
the spot of meeting (the southern headland of the bay)
“ Bracefield Heads.” They then took bearings of moun-
tains inland to the northward and westward called by the
natives Mandan, Carura, Coura, Collimen, Yuro-Yuro,
Eirangi and Boppel; these being the most remarkable of
the many in sight.
About thirty miles from this place they came to a head-
land from which Boppel bore N.W. It was here that
Brown, mate of the ship Stirling Castle, wrecked many
years before on Fraser’s Island (so called after Captain
Fraser, who was murdered there) was met. This place was
named “ Brown’s Cape ” after him. Brown was killed by
the blacks, but Bracefield took possession of Mrs. Fraser,
the sole survivor, after the massacre of her husband and
crew, and brought her to the new penal settlement at
Brisbane, where he left her and returned to his black com-
rades. After joining Mr. Russell’s party, he acted as guide,
and they passed over a sandspit through the south entrance
to Wide Bay, and landed on a beautiful beach on the main-
land. Being puzzled by numerous shoals and inlets, they
ascended the highest points of Fraser’s Island, and dis-
covered the entrance to the Mary River, then called in the
native tongue, “ Moorobocoola.” Their next stage was to a
spot now known as Bingham, where they camped. As they
proceeded, they passed over Eaton’s Falls, and occasionally
camped on the river banks, Boppel Mount being still visible.
Here they fell in with many blacks travelling to the Bunya
Scrub, and among them another white man, James Davis, of
Glasgow, called by the natives “ Durramboi.” This man
afterwards returned to Brisbane, where he married and
settled down and worked at his trade as a blacksmith. He


died a few years ago, and left all his possessions to charities.
Bracefield was killed by a tree falling upon him at Woogaroo,
on the Brisbane River. It may not be out of place here to
mention that Jas. Murrell, a sailor of the barque Peruvian,
wrecked on these coasts, was, after being eighteen years
with the blacks, rescued and reclaimed in February, 1863.
Davis proved invaluable to pioneer settlers and explorers
in piloting them to new country which they took up as runs,
and he it was who brought Mr. Jolliffe through many
difficulties when in charge of John Eales’s flocks from the
Hunter River to Wide Bay. Hardly had he reached Tiaro
than the usual treacherous attacks by blacks occurred, and,
Jolliffe, resigning his post, was succeeded by Mr. Last, as
super for Eales. He, however, had similar experiences to
his predecessor, and was forced to abandon the station after
great losses of men and stock. The first murders of whites
by blacks occurred at Eales’s Station at Tiaro, when three
shepherds were killed. None lamented them, and their
names are unknown.

COMMERCE, TRADE, AND PROGRESS, 1896.
Ah, I can picture what perchance may be
In the bright Future’s evanescent years,
And on ihis tranquil spot located see
Some mighty nation, with new hopes and fears;
Some giant city, fill’d with busy looms,
Where honest Labour holds the hands of Trade;
A place of note, where cultur’d Commerce blooms,
And Plenty stands in regal garb arrayed.
Who knows the Future ? Who, indeed, can see
What yet may rise in that far distant time?
Imagination only holds the key
Which opes the portal of this dream sublime.
In order to show present state of local trade and com-
mercial prosperity, I append the following Report from the
Maryborough Chamber of Commerce :
Chamber of Commerce.
(Established 1860).
The annual meeting of members of the Maryborough
Chamber of Commerce was held in the School of Arts on
October 21, 1896, when the following report was read and
adopted :—Present, Messrs. J. Hockley (President), Jas,
Robertson, H. M. Ramsay, R. S. Warry, G. Horsburgh, R.
Jones, F. G. Popp, W. Walker, Jas. Fairlie, John Graham
and G. Stupart.
The President said though they had come through the
year with a credit balance, its position was not what it
should be. With regard to railway extension, it would be
noted that the permanent survey of the Gayndah Railway


was within twelve miles of Gayndah. They might con-
gratulate themselves upon the progress made, and he hoped
by next annual meeting they would be able to record that
tenders for the Gayndah Railway had been accepted. A
railway from Kilkivan to Nanango was mooted, and this
would open up excellent agricultural land. He need not
speak of the wheat growing capacity of the Gayndah
district, but was certain no wheat could be grown there
until the railway was built, as it cost almost as much for
carriage from Gayndah to here as from San Francisco.
The question of branding hides had their attention, and no
doubt in face of the evidence that had been submitted of
the damage done to hides, stockowners would be more
careful in future. It was gratifying that the Government
had recognised the importance of the fruit industry by
appointing an expert to instruct the growers. Large prices
had been obtained for Sydney oranges and other fruit on
the London market, and as the Maryborough oranges
ripened earlier than in the south, we ought to have a better
market in London than the Sydney growers. For the year
1895 the Maryborough district produced 94,5511b. of grapes,
156,927 dozen bananas, 5,626 dozen pineapples, and 160,594
dozen oranges, and no doubt the returns this year would be
far in excess of last year. Cranage power on the wharf
had been improved. There was still much to be done in
the way of shipping facilities, as they had still differential
rates to contend with. Cargoes could be shipped from
Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney to the northern ports of
Queensland as low as from Brisbane or Maryborough, which
were almost within speaking distance of the north. The
Government were partly to blame for that, through the
excessive shipping charges, and the sooner they got rid of
them the better it would be for commerce, as commerce
must have free ports. Goods shipped from a Sydney to a
northern port, paid less in harbour dues than if shipped
from one Queensland port to another. Another grievance
was the withdrawal of direct steamer communication with
Bundaberg. The A.U.S.N. Co. had abandoned that line,
and now goods for Bundaberg had to go via Brisbane for
Rockhampton, taking about a week. These and other
matters should claim their attention. Through the energy
of the Burrum Board and with assistance from the


Chamber, the railway to Pialba was now almost completed.
What they looked for was that the line would be extended
to deep water, so that ocean steamers could load coal,
timber and other bulky products of this district. Orders
for a large quantity of timber and coal went past Mary-
borough because of the heavy shipping charges and the
lack of deep draught wharfage facilities. A railway to deep
water would be a great boon to the large manufactories of
Maryborough, as Maryborough was destined to become the
Birmingham of Queensland, and had everything necessary
to become a manufacturing town. They suffered much
and lost trade through want of direct steamers of large
capacity w r ith northern ports. The expansion of their coal
trade depended largely upon having a deep sea port, and
until that was accomplished they could not hope to
participate in the oversea trade. Negotiations with the
Government in the matter of a reduction of telephone
charges had been carried on during the year, and were
likely to lead to satisfactory results. The Australian and
New Zealand bill of lading form, trade with the British
Empire, the recent Congress of Chambers in London, and
the Berne cable code were also touched upon. The river
dredging had been going on very satisfactorily, and they
might expect soon to have the whole river dredged to a
minimum depth of 10ft. at low water. There was the
question of trustees investment in colonial stocks. At
present trustees could only invest trust funds in Imperial
Consols, but a movement was on foot to make colonial
stocks a source of investment. He quite agreed with the
remarks of Mr. R. B. B. Clayton on the subject. A Con-
ference of Chambers of Commerce was to be held in Sydney
on April 15th, 1897, and he hoped the objects set forth
would be accomplished, one of which was the assumption
by Chambers of Commerce of a proper position as important
deliberative bodies, and the consequent extension of their
influence with business people, legislators and the public.
If such a body were to take in hand the different tariffs,
the anomalies in our town, shipping charges, and every-
thing in that way, it would be an immense advantage and
aid to any Government. The anomalies in the Queensland
tariff were ridiculous, and they could not be better pointed
out and remedied than by business men. The preservation


■of statistical information was a duty they owed to them-
selves, their creditors, and to posterity. The Customs and
other figures gave a good idea of the progress they were
making, or otherwise. The imports of the colony lor the
yearamounted to £5,849,007, and the exports to £8,982,600.
Some political economists said that an excess of exports
was not always a sign of prosperity, but he thought that in
■Queensland they could congratulate themselves to a very
great extent upon what came from the soil. They were
making this wealth and exporting it, where nothing was
produced before. In this district they took a very con-
siderable sum out of the ground, and that was a matter for
great congratulation. The Isis Scrub was a remarkable
instance. In 1887 he had ridden through that scrub and
there was hardly a clearing, and not a stick of sugarcane.
Yet in the present year the mills in the Isis Scrub had
crushed 8,000 tons of cane per week, notwithstanding the
severe winter, which had greatly diminished the crop.
The amount of money paid by the mill to farmers this
season would be about £IOO,OOO, and this sum of money
was being drawn from a district which nine years ago was
nearly all under standing scrub. The export of sugar for
the year 1895 was 1,344,120 cwt., valued at £796,117.
According to the last statistics, Maryborough had in her
midst 78 industries (foundries, factories, mills, &c.) in actual
operation. That spoke well for the enterprise of the people,
and showed that the town was depending upon its own
resources, and did not require 300 miles of railway to keep
it alive, though of course they expected to get their western
railway as well. They had also reason to congratulate
themselves that their foundries had been kept in full work,
as well as the timber, coal and other industries. The
Torbanlea Colliery had put out during the year 30,000 tons
of coal, and employed over 100 hands, the annual turnover
being £24,000. The Queensland Collieries Co. had made a
large advance during the year, putting out 51,250 tons, an
increase of 17,000 on the previous year, about 200 hands
being employed. Owing to statements made that Burrum
coal was not suitable for oversea export owing to a tendency
to spontaneous combustion, successful experiments had been
carried out at the Queensland Colliery pits. About 500
tons had been stored for twelve months, and, when tested,


it was found that the temperature throughout had not per-
ceptibly varied. This showed that Burrum coal would
carry without danger, and was an important point to bring
under the notice of shippers who wanted coal cargoes for
long distances. (Mr. Jas. Robertson said they bad kept
850 tons in the coal shoots at Torbanlea for years, and it
had given them no trouble with heating.) Another great
industry was the Queensland Smelting Company’s works at
Aldershot. Through the courtesy of Mr. E. A. Weinberg,
the managing director, he could give them a few particulars.
For the financial year ended July 81st, the total turnover
was £100,045, inclusive of southern branches, and the
amount of wages paid £10,141. Taking this in conjunction
with the sums paid in the Isis Scrub and at the collieries,
it was a wonder where all the money went to, and that they
all seemed to be so hard up. The ore trade at Aldershot
during the year had been a fairly good one, and though the
surrounding district remained a small contributor, the
northern mining districts had largely availed themselves of
the facilities offered to them by the presence of a public
smelting works in the colony. The ore trade to Mary-
borough from the northern ports has been greatly encouraged
by the low shipping rates obtained from Maryborough
shipowners. The Aldershot works had been going
constantly, and refining appliances had been added, and all
base bullion, which formerly was shipped to London, was
being refined at the works. The Q.S. Co.’s brand of pig
lead had been introduced into the market, and found a
ready sale. The gold produced in the Wide Bay and.
Burnett district during 1895 was as follows : —Gympie,
80,766 tons, yielding 77,9880z., an average of 19dwt. 7gr.
per ton; Eidsvold, 2,765 tons, yielding 4,7190z., average
loz. 14dwt. Bgr. per ton; Paradise, 1,372 tons, yielding
1,2800z., average 18dwt. 16gr. The gold exported from
Queensland for the year was 690,1880z., valued at
£2,265,354. The estimated value of gold in Queensland to
date was £86,955,117 10s. The natural products of the
Maryborough district in 1895 were :—Wine, 4,077 gals. ;
brandy, 109 gals. ; maize, 56,994 bushels ; potatoes, 895
tons ; sugar, 2,128 tons ; oats, 728 tons ; lucerne, 137 tons ;
grapes, 94,5511b5.; bananas, 156,927 doz.; pineapples,
5,626 doz. ; oranges, 160,594 doz. The land under cultiva-


tion in the Maryborough district is 8,877 acres, 57 being
farms conditional, 8,845 acres, and 4 unconditional, 898
acres. The number of stock was—ln Maryborough district:
Cattle, 25,888 ; horses, 5,787 ; pigs, 1,574. Tiaro district:
Cattle, 48,615 ; horses, 4,100 ; pigs, 1,258. The statistics
of cattle slaughtered in the colony were as follows:—For
preserving, 104,969; freezing, 80,487; boiling down,
98,874. Sheep : Preserving, 885,060 ; freezing, 75,600 ;
boiling down, 748,257. The total quantity of beef pre-
served was 19,849,8961b5.; frozen, 50,849,9561b5. Mutton:
Preserved, 5,088,5221b5.; frozen, 8,064,4581b5. Bacon:
Cured, 4,941,5121b5. The value of exported wool was
£2,986,989; tallow, £595,992; and meat, £1,028,172.
The revenue of the colony, £3,561,717, was the greatest
since Separation, and the expenditure, £8,374,760, was
£370,457 less than in 1890, and the least but one in the
past six years. These figures, though dry, were instructive.
The President, in conclusion, spoke of the great assistance
their members in Parliament had always been prepared to
give them, and for which they gave thanks. He also spoke
highly of the services of the secretary, and said the
Chamber was much indebted to him for its success. He
hoped to see Mr. Gardner at some future time occupy the
chair.
Mr. Ramsay, in seconding the motion, said with reference
to the steamer service with Bundaberg, the trade between
the two ports was so infinitesimal that no one could expect
any company to run a steamer to and fro. It only took
three or four days for cargo to go via Brisbane or Rock-
hampton. He congratulated the President on his address,
and endorsed the remarks respecting the secretary.
Mr. Stupart said it was an unusual luxury to have a
credit balance, and this was due to the vigilance of the
secretary. The President’s facts and figures were of a very
hopeful character. Just now they were dull, because of
the long brightness of the sky. But they must wait and
hope, not that the clouds would roll by, but that they will
roll up and discharge copious showers. He trusted that at
their next annual meeting they would have something very
definite to relate in connection with their western railway.
That was the goal to which they had to look to bring
within their reach the greater expanse of territory awaiting


development of its rich resources. He was glad to think
that at an early date thousands of the people of Mary-
borough would be able to see the sea for the first time. He
hoped the Pialba Railway would justify the strenuous efforts
this society had made to secure it. They had done a good
thing in being the first to induce the Government to
establish the railway guarantee system.
Mr. Walker said the report was a satisfactory one.
There had been scarcely a movement of any importance
but its initial force had been derived from the Chamber.
The progress in the Isis was startling. The farmers had
received £IOO,OOO for their cane this season, and, at 10s. a
ton, that would mean 200,000 tons of cane, and at 10 tons
to the ton of sugar that would mean 20,000 tons of sugar,
which, at £lB a ton, represented £260,000, as the gross
wealth of this season’s operation. A few years ago the Isis
was a dense scrub, with not a stick of sugarcane upon it.
Messrs. H. M. Ramsay and Jas. Fairlie were re-elected
vice-presidents. Committee elected —Messrs. E. B. Corser,
W. Walker, G. A. White, E. Jones, Thos. Ross, W.
Dawson, G. Stupart, J. Robertson, E. F. Hanley, A. H.
Wilson, W. F. Harrington, C. S. M‘Ghie, R. S. Warry and
G. Horsburgh, and T. Ross re-appointed treasurer, and D,
Gardner secretary.
Mr. Horsburgh asked if a decrease in the subscription
would increase membership, and the President stated that
when a gentleman became a member of the Chamber he
was supposed to pay a guinea entrance fee, and a guinea a
year subscription afterwards. That had been more honoured
in the breach than the observance, and they would notice
from the Report that there were some who were elected
last year who had not signified in any way that they would
become members. He suggested that in future anyone
proposed should be notified of his election, and requested
to signify his willingness to become a member.
On the motion of Mr. Fairlie, it was decided to hold
monthly meetings on the third Thursday in each month at
8 p.m., instead of the afternoon.
Maryborough, as we invariably hear, is improving ; every-
body believes it must go on, and declares that all to
show population is coming this way. Buildings are going


up, larger and larger every day, till at last it will be bard
to say where or when they will stop. And now that
attention to building is being given, let us take care to
make our town as attractive and pleasing in appearance as
we can, so that when strangers come to look at it they shall
not behold much to offend the eye, or merely think it a vast
conglomeration of brick and mortar, but a place beautified
and desirable to live in. Many a town is spoiled by the
irregularity of its buildings—the main thoroughfares
contain a heterogenous collection of huts, sheds, shops and
mansions, an occasional church or school, with here and
there a piece of vacant land—corners especially—for which
the owners want hundreds of pounds per foot, and failing
to get it resolve to keep their mother earth for the next
half century or so, or may be till the Day of Judgment, in
the belief that some fellow will eventually come along and
purchase it, thinking he has secured a profitable bargain.
As it is found by those who have much correspondence
that there being two towns, one in Victoria and the other
in Queensland with similar names, errors occur and letters
go astray. The matter has been referred to the local
Chamber of Commerce and discussed by that body, whilst
we can hardly expect its Victorian prototype to give up the
original cognomen. Our own Maryborough will not abandon
its well-known title. The origin of its name is involved in
obscurity and may be regarded as one of those problems of
the past which cannot now be solved.
But what’s in a name ? “ A rose,” so the poet says, “ by
any other name would smell as sweet.” And if we had
called the town by its original name of fifty years ago, it
would not now have clashed with any other place. Among
contributions to the local Press some months back I
suggested that the most appropriate title for Maryborough
would be “ Modern Athens.” Once adopt this, and the
term Maryborough will appear but common-place. Truly
we live in a period of advancement; of newness in all
things. Therefore let our town be the “ Modern Athens ”
of Queensland; that is, if Ipswich, once so dubbed, will
disclaim the appellation.
Having suggested this euphonious title, let us make it
worthy of its prototype, the Athens of old. A strictly
enforced Building Act will at once secure uniformity in


building. As leases expire, many unsightly domiciles will
disappear, and instead thereof will rise buildings more in
conformity with the progress and spirit of the times. Let
those careless in such matters know that there is such a
thing as Art; how much more pleasing to sight is an
ornamental dwelling-place, however small, than one, large
though it be, in which taste is wanting. The cities of the
East—Constantinople, Cairo, and others—are more than
elegant at a distance ; spires, minarets and towers hash in
the sunlight with a gorgeousness born of beauty, and one
feels delight in contemplating them; within there are
thoroughfares reeking with abominations, creating disgust
in the minds of the beholders. Sanitary matters are
neglected, hence the trouble —even as it is in this land of
ours. Maryborough yet needs stricter attention to sanita-
tion, and the larger its population the greater the desira-
bility of establishing a perfect system of this important
adjunct to health.
Good substantial buildings, of uniform character and
proper sanitation, will certainly go far towards making our
town a worthy compeer to others in Queensland. Fre-
quently I hear unfavourable comparisons between Mary-
borough, Toowoomba and other places, which have no
more natural facilities and resources for creating a beautiful
city than we have. Therefore let us do something to
enhance the beauty and status of Maryborough, so that it
shall no longer be the subject of unfair remarks. Let us
not trust to our Municipal Council alone to beautify the
town ; they have done much in clearing the highways and
byways, aligning the thoroughfares, removing obstructions,
and preparing the way for those improvements which
modern progress demands, but let all do their best to
improve and embellish their habitations and land ; re-model,
plant, and improve each vacant patch, whether afar
from or nigh the owner’s residence. Look at the cottage
gardens of Victoria and New South Wales, a credit to their
owners, who not only have scored marks of approval in
horticultural societies, but gained that greater satisfaction
and reward of being possessors of such “ beauty spots ”
and a true “ home,” for home is not merely four walls of
slabs and bark, brick or stone, devoid of taste, comfort or
luxury, on the adjuncts of civilized existence. Plant trees,


young man ! plant trees, and sit under your own vine and
fig-tree—an easy matter to do in Maryborough with “land
so cheap and terms so easy ” (vide the weekly auction
sales) and opportunities for the small capitalist and enter-
prising husbandman.
How vast is the wealth which good soil annually
produces; glance back fifty years and note the various
crops which have made Wide Bay famous. Trade and
commerce, as applied to our chief thoroughfares, are factors
of prosperity, but what would they be but for the land and
its products at the hands of the farmer, the horticulturist,
orchardist and husbandman. Half a century ago wool was
our staple product; then we began to grow maize, and got
splendid crops. Wide Bay maize gained top prices, and we
might have gone on cultivating it till now but for the
discovery of the suitability of the locality for cotton. In
May, 1868, thirty-six farmers exhibited cotton locally
produced at the Wide Bay Farmers and Planters’ Exhibi-
tion, and there were then 850 acres under cotton. In
Maryborough little but »cotton was talked of, and a Joint
Stock Company was suggested ; Messrs. Bailey and Bromley
were to the fore with experiments, and the merits of Sea
Island, New Orleans, and the kidney-seeded cotton of
South America discussed and fully argued out. Next came
tobacco culture, introduced by Mr. R. Fergusson at Lumeah
Farm, Graham’s Creek, and proving, by excellent samples
of tobacco exhibited, the suitability of soil here for this
plant, it skilled and experienced men were employed. But
all these minor industries had to give way before sugar-
growing and we find that on Nov. 20, 1869, Captain
Jeffreys, at a public meeting held to discuss the question,
reported that the cost of a floating sugar mill capable
of manufacturing two tons of sugar per day would
be £2OOO.
And discarding other industries which gave promise of
success, our agriculturists have ever since made sugar
pre-eminent, so that now the Wide Bay district is as famed
for saccharine products as it formerly was for maize,
cotton, station produce, wool, tallow and hides. Whether
the change to sugar has been as beneficial or remunerative
as expected, is hard to say; certainly the land has been
well tested and great results shown, but ever and anon


grumblings, not loud but deep, occur at some shareholders
meetings, in there being too many calls and too few
dividends ; and some go home in a deep study as to “ what
might have been had the original capital been invested in
other things, such as dairying, butter, cheese-making, or
fruit-growing, with a factory to utilize the surplus in jams,
jellies, candied peel, or pickles, vinegars, sauces and the like.
Mr. James Dowzer, a practical farmer, has often demon-
strated by the superior quality of his produce, that good
butter and cheese are to be made here. Tiaro may yet
become a second Bodalla, or even a copy of Wiltshire or
Dorsetshire —English counties famed for first-class dairy
products. And if Mr. Dowzer can turn out splendid butter,
year in and year out, what is to hinder others from following
his example, and giving the Maryborough public an article
fit to eat in lieu of the high-priced, rancid, ill-tasting stuff
retailed at stores as the product of the cow ? But this is
not a treatise on dairying, and I have wandered from maize
to cotton, to sugar and butter; pity ’tis we could not close
with wheat and other cereals, most of which are imported,
and which the fine agricultural lands of Degilbo and
Burnett are well qualified to grow. Agricultural societies
are the backbone of progress, and it is gratifying to find
that there are few towns throughout the Wide Bay and
Burnett districts but have their annual shows, at which
healthy competition and the best products in various lines
of cotton are shown. If beyond a desire to obtain prizes
for exhibits, the farmer fails to place an equally good class
of produce on the market for the consumers, but little good
is done and the results are nil. The Agricultural Society
and Farmers’ Association are excellent institutions for the
farmer, and even if he has gained large experience in the
school of nature it cannot harm him to obtain much more;
in fact, the meeting of men of similar tastes and callings,
and the discussion of matters in which all are interested,
cannot but be productive of good results and advantages.

NEW LAMINGTON BRIDGE.


King, J. C. Stewart, John Newell, MM.L.A.; Messrs. R.
Porter, Goldring, L. A. Bernays, A. B. Brady (Engineer
of Bridges), and other gentlemen. The visitors were met
at the railway station by Messrs. J. Bartholomew, N.
Tooth, and I. Lissner, MM.L.A., the chairman (Mr. John
Donnelly) and members of the Bnrrnm Divisional Board ;
the chairman (Mr. J. Parke) and members of Tinana
Divisional Board; the members of the Bridge Board ; the
Mayor and Aldermen Dawson, Noakes, Kinne, Rabaa, and
Jocumsen, and a large number of citizens. The visitors
were driven in cabs to the Royal Hotel, where refreshments
were provided. The party were then taken to the bridge,
which was gaily decorated with flags, the steam punt being
also decorated with bunting and foliage. At the approaches
to the bridge, there was a large assemblage of ladies and
gentlemen present, the entrance to the bridge proper being
fenced oft* by a tricolor ribbon.
Mr. Jas. Fairlie, chairman of the board, stated that they
had come to see the bridge opened—a bridge that had taken
the place of the old wooden bridge. He hoped the new
bridge would be a more enduring one, and he had great
pleasure in asking the Minister for Works, Mr. Dalrymple,
to cut the ribbon that now barred their progress and declare
it open —he was going to say free, but they could not do
that yet, though he hoped it would be a free bridge soon.
Mr. Dalrymple said he had pleasure in acceding to the
wishes of the Bridge Board to undertake this duty, or rather
privilege, of declaring the bridge open. The Premier was
unable to do so, and had sent Mr. Philp and himself up
instead. The bridge was a most substantial one, and he
was glad indeed to perform the ceremony of this descrip-
tion. It had taken some two years to construct the bridge,
which was badly wanted, and would subserve the useful pur-
pose of connecting Maryborough with the surrounding district.
They had lately had a discussion in Brisbane with regard
to their bridge, and much energy and self-reliance had been
expended in obtaining a new structure. He hoped this
bridge would be a permanent one, and last for an indefinite
period.
Alderman J. M. Dawson called for three cheers for the
“ Maryborough Bridge.'’


The hon. gentleman then descended and cut the ribbon,
and the bridge was very soon crowded with people. The
afternoon was fine, and the scene on the bridge and the
broad stretch of water on either side made the promenade
an enjoyable one to all present.
The following are the inscriptions on the marble tablets
on the abutments of the bridge :

Opened by the Hon. D. H. Dalrymple.
In the evening the visitors were invited to dinner at the
Royal Hotel. A fine spread had been laid out on the
balcony of the hotel, Mr. J. A. Phillips being the caterer.
The number present was 55. Mr. Jas. Fairlie presided*
and was supported by the Hons. R. Philp and D. H.’
Dalrymple. The vice-chairmen were Messrs. G. Stupart
and N. Tooth. Besides the visitors there were present the
Mayor, and Aldermen Kinne, Dawson, Jocumsen, Noakes
and Rabaa ; Messrs. Parke, Brennan, Habler and Hansen,
Tinana Board; Messrs. Jas. Robertson, Jas. Hockley, Jas!
Mahoney, P. Ramsay, A. Weinberg and others. ’ An
orchestra was stationed on the balcony, consisting of Herr
Geyger, Messrs. A. Miller, W. Dunn and F. Smith. After
the very excellent dinner, the usual loyal and patriotic
toasts were duly honoured, and the choice viands done
ample justice to. The speeches were “up to mark,” and
delivered by Messrs. Philp, Lissner, Dalrymple, Parke,
Stupart, Fairlie, Finney, J. T. Smith, Annear, Bartholmew!
Goldsmith, Tooth, J. M. Stafford, Hon. A. H. Wilson r’
King, and several others.


The old bridge, wrecked by the flood of 1898, took the
place of the punt ferry. This was called the Prince’s
Ferry, and did good service during the Gympie rush, and
before and after that time. In 1874 the Government,
through the advocacy of the Hon. A. Macalister, Premier,
and the Hon. H. E. King, Minister for Works, decided to
build a high level bridge, constructed of wood, which was
opened on the Ist of January, 1876. The bridge was well
constructed by Mr. W. Robertson, but succumbed after
nearly twenty years’ life. The bridge was 1800 ft. long, the
largest bridge in Queensland, and was 85ft. above high
water mark. There was half a million feet of timber used
in its construction. On arches were the names of E. S.
Booker, mayor; H. E. King, Minister for Works; W. W.
Cairns, Governor of Queensland; and Hon. A. Macalister,
Premier. A toll was levied, but some time after the bridge
was handed over to the Municipal Council and the tolls
were abolished. The bridge was managed by a joint com-
mittee from the Council and Tinana Divisional Board.
After the wreck of the bridge in February, 1898, a steam
ferry punt was built, and the traffic across the river carried
on by that. The Maryborough Bridge Act was shortly
afterwards passed, Messrs. Jas. Fairlie, G. Stupart, and
N. Tooth being constituted a Board to supervise the erection
of a new bridge. The Board have worked assiduously and
carefully for three years, and the result is the fine new
concrete structure across the Mary. The plans of the
present bridge were selected from among others with the
concurrence of Mr. A. B. Brady, the Government Engineer
of Bridges. The tender of Mr. Rees was accepted for
£16,537, and in 1895 he began, but was compelled to aban-
don it through monetary difficulties. After some months
fresh tenders were called, and that of Messrs. M‘Ardle and
Thompson accepted, at £19,995, being the lowest. They
began the work in July, 1895, and to be completed in July,
1896, but obtained three months’ extension. The new
bridge, which is a low level bridge, and said to be the only
one in Australia of the kind across a tidal river, was
designed by Mr. Brady. The total length is 618 ft., and
595 ft. between the faces of the abutments, the width being
21ft. There are eleven spans of concrete arches, each
50ft. clear span, carried on concrete piers and abutments,


the quantity of concrete used being between 4000 and 5000
cubic yards. The level of the roadway is 12jft. above high
water. The piers are constructed on two sections below
water level, and sunk down to a solid rock foundation.
Wrought-iron caissons were used for this purpose, filled
with Portland cement, composed of river sand and broken
hard stone. The rise of each arch is 4ft., and the total
width of the arch over the parapet is 22ft. Bin., in which
are placed 11 skeleton frames of steel railway rails, bolted
to cast-iron chains on each pier and abutment, the
bed-plates being well anchored down by bolts and plates.
The weight of the framing is 91 tons. The roadway is
payed with ironbark blocks, twice tarred, the interstices
being filled with boiling asphalt, and bedded on tarred blue
metal screenings. The handrails, consisting of stanchions
of wrought iron, also the lamps, are easily removable, so as
to leave the surface of the bridge clear in times of flood.
The structure appears most substantially and faithfully
built, and strong enough to withstand any flood.
The visit of Lord Lamington to Maryborough having been
arranged for from July 28 to 81, 1896, His Excellency met
with a most enthusiastic reception, the arrangements being
most complete, and well carried out by the Corporation and
its energetic Mayor (J. M. Stafford, Esq.), whilst entertain-
ments, speech-making, and sight-seeing, predominated, and
at all the Governor was the central figure of patriotic
homage and laudation. His bonhomie and good nature
at once attracted the populace, and it was evident that Lord
Lamington was likely to be the most popular Governor
Queensland has had. Lack of space alone prevents my
giving full details of the events organized in his honour,
suffice it to summarise them thus :—On his arrival 8,000
school children sang the “National Anthem,” with good
effect. A triple arch, designed by Mr. H. Kerr, covered
with palms and bunting of all colours, formed a prominent
feature in our streets. Messrs. Turley, Ingham, and O’Neill
shared the honours in arranging the greenery, which had a
pretty The procession comprised :—The Protestant
Alliance Friendly Society, Ancient Order of Foresters,
Court Robert the Bruce and Court Elizabeth Fry, the M.
U. and I. Oddfellows, Rechabites, Hibernian A. C. B,
Society, Caledonian Society, Naval Brigade, Cyclists, Fire


Engine and Manual with Fire Brigade. These, with the
Advance Brass Band and a long stream of vehicles, made
an imposing spectacle. The streets were thronged with
people; visitors from all the surrounding districts being
present, including the aldermen and divisional boardsmen.
Several addresses of welcome were presented to His Ex-
cellency by the Maryborough Council, the Divisional Boards
of Burrum, Granville, Isis, Antigua, and Tinana, and the
Caledonian Society also presented him with an elegant and
unique inkstand formed of emu’s eggs set in silver. The
Citizens’ Ball and Grand Concert, Cycling Carnival, and
other sports, were attended by His Excellency, who, though
doubtless overwhelmed by so much hospitality, was delighted
with all he saw and heard. For three days and nights the
city was en fete, the greatest goodfellowship prevailed, and
the police were specially complimented by the Governor for
the admirable way in which they had preserved law and
order.
The Agricultural Society’s Show of 1896, though it had
fewer exhibits than its predecessors, was highly attractive
and successful. The gross gate takings amounted to £179
the first day, and £7B the second. Estimated that on the
first day the attendance was fully 4,000, and 2,000 the
second.

As will be seen by this strange assortment of names those
of females predominate. Other streets bear names of old or
leading residents—thus Kent street is from the late T. Kent,
Police Magistrate ; Richmond from Jack Richmond, bullock
driver. The principal and most important streets are Kent,
Bazaar, Wharf, Adelaide, and Richmond, each containing
pretentious-looking buildings which have supplanted the
primitive structures of other days, and in the erection of
which brick and stone are used instead of Maryborough pine.
Kent street is a fine, well laid-out thoroughfare with
many imposing structures, notably the School of Arts, the
A.J.S. and Commercial Banks, Stupart’s Drapery Palace,
Jno. Bartholomew and Co.’s and Finney, Isles and Co.,
which all compare favourably with leading houses in the
same businesses in Brisbane. The State School, Grammar
Schools and other buildings are in this street. In Adelaide
street, the next best thoroughfare, are the Wesleyan Church,
and the Fire Brigade Station with its imposing tower. In
Bazaar street the R.C. Church, the A.M.P. Buildings, Wide
Bay News office, Post Office and Woodrow and Sons’
buildings command attention. The extensive shipbuilding
yards and foundry of Messrs. Walker and Co., Ltd., saw-
mills of Hyne and Son, the large sawmills of Wilson, Hart
and Co. at once attract the visitor to the lower end of the
town near the river. Facing the river are the Court House,
Custom House and various hotels, and riverside buildings
necessary to a commercial centre. The city presents an
industrial front, and everyone appears intent on business as
he hurries past along its well-kept thoroughfares. Indeed,
it is admitted by strangers that Maryborough is one of the
largest and most prosperous cities in Queensland, its
foundries and sawmills turning out work equal to anything
approached elsewhere, and even at lower price than those
of the metropolis.
George Stupart’s Drapery Palace
Is the oldest-established warehouse in Maryborough, and
has grown from very modest proportions to the present
large and commodious premises situated at the corner of
Kent and Bazaar streets. George Stupart, the proprietor,
has been in business since 1863, and has had a full share
of the ups and downs of life. He has seen the gleanings of


GEORGE STUPARTS DRAPERY PALACE


years wiped out by fire and suffered severely by the flood
of 1898, to say nothing of the copper boom, the land boom
and the various gold-mining booms. He has found, how-
ever, as many a smarter man has done before him, that it
would have been wiser to stick to his own business. Mr.
Stupart imports all leading lines direct from the best makers
in the trade and his stock is always up to date ; indeed it
is questionable if there is a larger and better assorted, or
better value north of Sydney. The chief departments are
under capable management, and the assistants are well and
favourably known for attention and civility.
In addition to the general drapery, clothing and millinery
department, very special care is given to the household
furnishing department, floorcloths, linoleums, carpets,
mattings, Japanese and Chinese furniture, American and
Austrian chairs, iron bedsteads, bedding, &c., &c. Mr,
Stupart gives particular attention to the country trade,
which his personal knowledge of the district enables him
to understand and secure. Although very much engrossed
with his business, Mr. Stupart has always identified himself
with the public affairs of Maryborough, and has done a
fair share of the work in helping to build up the various
institutions of this progressive city.
Bartholomew and Co 8 , Limited.
Occupying a commanding position in the centre of Kent
street, opposite the Royal Hotel, are the business premises
of Bartholomew & Co., Limited. Their establishments
comprise two shops, one for ladies’ and the other for gentle-
men’s wear, and they present a solid yet attractive appear-
ance. The men’s departments have a full staff of cutters
and tailors, etc., having over twenty employees and
assistants, and for excellence, variety of materials,
superiority of workmanship, unquestionably low rate of
prices, perfection of fit, they stand unrivalled. The
Company having large capital at their disposal, are
enabled to import direct from European and Continental
makers, thereby saving a middleman’s profits. In tailoring,
hats, and general outfitting, they stand unrivalled.
The ladies’ department comprises millinery, dress mate-
rials, fancy haberdashery, and Manchester goods, and each
department is fully stocked with all the latest styles and

fashions, while the prices are so low as to defy competition.
The millinery department is superb, the stocks being very
large and well assorted. A first-class milliner and artiste
is in charge of the underclothing, and of this they hold very
choice stocks. In the dress department all the newest
materials of the season, and a well-assorted stock at popular
prices are on view. For household goods, Bartholomew &
Co., Limited, are second to none. Being large importers,
they secure profits which are given to their customers in
extra good value. They invite inspection, and solicit com-
parisons between their goods and those of other local
establishments.
Messrs. James Hockley and Co o
The premises of Messrs. Hockley and Co. are situate in
Adelaide street, and occupy a considerable frontage in an
important portion of it. The business carried on is that of
hardware merchants, embracing ironmongery in all its
branches, agricultural implements, chandlery, paints, oils,
and in short every ramification of a progressive concern.
The firm was established in 1888 under the name of
Hockley, Tait, and Co., with a branch establishment in
Brisbane. Recently a dissolution of partnership took place,
Mr. Tait retiring from the firm, and trade is now carried
on by Mr. James Hockley. The front shop has a width of
40ft. and a depth of 90ft., while on the opposite side of the
road is a commodious building used exclusively as a store
for agricultural implements. The premises are within a
few yards of the railway station, and most centrally placed
for convenience and rapid despatch of goods. Messrs.
Hockley command the bulk of the western trade, reaching
out as far as Gayndah, the most important township lying
to the west of Maryborough, and at one time famous as the
centre of a vast sheep district. A very heavy stock is
carried by the firm under notice, this being necessary owing
to the fact that the town and district requirements are of a
varied and comprehensive character. Nearly all goods are
imported direct from England, America, and the Continent,
the firm keeping a buyer at home. Messrs. Hockley and
Co. are agents for F. and J. Howard, the Bedford manu-
facturers of agricultural implements, and their goods are in
demand in the Wide Bay district. Needless to say the firm

deals in a wholesale as well as a retail way, and travellers
are constantly at work securing orders in the district. The
firm enjoys a first-class reputation for probity and careful
dealing. Mr. James Hockley has been many years in the
town, and honourably filled the many public positions
which he has held from time to time.
Finney, Isles and Co.
Messrs. Finney, Isles and Co. are household words in
Queensland. North, east, south and west the name of the
firm is graven on the knowledge of the people. The
palatial drapery stores in Brisbane are a landmark in the
city, and there are few persons indeed who have not at one
time or other secured bargains from the firm. Over thirteen
years ago (May, 1888), it was determined to open a branch
warehouse at Maryborough, and fine premises were secured
in the main street and adjoining the A.J.S. Bank. The
enterprise of the firm was promptly rewarded, and has
been followed by years of success. In 1888 there was only
one man in charge and one man delivering parcels; now
there is a great staff employed, and three horses and
delivery van are scarcely sufficient to meet the daily demands.
There has been an opening out, too, of the business, and
besides the ordinary drapery trade, tailoring, dressmaking,
and millinery keep many hands busily at work. The busi-
ness done is on the cash system, and since the inauguration
of this wise method the results have been most satisfactory.
A large district trade finds its way to Messrs. Finney, Isles
and Co., thanks to the cash and perfect parcel systems
which the firm brought into operation, and which the
country people were not slow to grasp. Mr. C. J. Hodnett
is a careful, clever, courteous, and popular manager, well
liked by the thirty or forty assistants who labour with him.
Mr. James Reid is accountant. Mr. Thomas Finney, the
head of the firm, pays periodical visits to Maryborough, and
they are generally red-letter days, as Mr. Finney, with that
boundless capacity for making other people enjoy them-
selves which he possesses, usually insists upon taking all
the employees for a picnic, and such a fatherly act is
warmly appreciated. The business premises, as may be
seen from the illustration, are in height two-story, with
presentable, well-lighted front. The interior is of great

depth, and fitted with every convenience, including the
cash railway, while excellent provision is made in every way
for the employees. On the upstairs floor are the tailoring
and millinery departments and the office. Abundance of
light floods the entire establishment, giving it a very
cheerful and bright appearance. It is worthy of mention
that during the thirteen years the firm has been in Mary-
borough no less a sum than £86,000 has been spent in
wages and expenses. It need hardly be remarked that the
stock is one of the largest and most fashionable in the city,
and with such excellent management, courtesy, and expedi-
tion shown to all purchasers cannot but secure large
patronage.
G. Horsburgh and Co., Ltd.,
General ironmongers and importers, plumbers and gal-
vanised ironworkers, are one of the oldest established firms
in Maryborough. The premises, established in a small way
in 1868, has taken rapid strides till at the present time it
stands pre-eminent as the leading ironmongery house in the
district. During the early history of the firm, the opera-
tions were confined principally to plumbing, but year by
year steps in the ladder of time, progress and improvement,
and increasing trade, compelled the firm to extend their
business, and the handsome brick premises now occupied
by them in the central position of the main street, were
built and stocked with a miscellaneous assortment of
general ironmongery. Besides the main premises, there
are buildings of every description at the rear and also in the
near vicinity, while in Richmond street the general work-
shops, employing a number of men, cover half an acre of
land. The lion’s share of the principal contracts in and
around Maryborough, and many in the northern portions of
the colony have been executed by Messrs. Horsburgh with
absolute fidelity. The firm carry a tremendous stock, and
the proverbial saying “ from a needle to an anchor,” may
be justly applied to their varied assortment of general
ironmongery goods of every description. The Kent street
shops are beautifully fitted up, and the fine plate-glass
windows stocked with serviceable and beautiful articles, the
long row of handsome glass cases occupying the centre of
the shop filled with cutlery and silver plate in the very
latest designs, whilst novelties in glassware and crockery


• ' - . V ; \
G. HORSBURGH & CO. LTD.


are artistically arranged. Guns, rifles, and sporting material
of every description, combined with the well assorted stock
of ironmongery, call forth the well merited admiration of
visitors and the general public. The bulk stores are
crammed with iron, paints, oils, rope, chain, cement, wire,
wire netting, station and mining requisites, agricultural
implements, and, in fact, every item conducive to a first-
class ironmongery business. As may be surmised, Messrs.
Horsburgh are direct importers, and large shipments of
goods are continually arriving from England, America and
the Continent. The business was established by the late
Mr. Geo. Horsburgh, senr., who arrived in Maryborough
with his family in 1868, and on his decease, his place was
ably filled by his eldest son, to whose perseverance and
ability the successful progress of the business is due. He
in turn is assisted by his sons, whose names are a house-
hold word in cricket circles and aquatic sports. Mr. A.
Horsburgh is secretary to the Maryborough Rowing Club,
and one of the most zealous and untiring of its officers.
This club, unlike others, is in a good financial position,
having a credit balance and being free from debt, whilst it
has also a capital stock of boats. The following are the
officers elected for the ensuing term :—President, Hon. A.
Heron Wilson, M.L.C.; vice-presidents, Dr. Penny, D.
Mactaggart, R. Hart, and G. Horsburgh; captain, Mr.
Jno. Mactaggart; vice-captain, Alfred Wilmott; committee,
Messrs. L. R. Rawson, P. Walsh, H. Brabazon, J.
Horsburgh, D. Forster, V. H. Oelrichs, F. T. Stuckey, R.
T. Matthieson, and A. A. Walker. During holidays this
rowing club is very much in evidence on the Mary River
and contests, in which the winners receive prizes and
medals and other honours, serve to keep up a healthy
excitement and friendly rivalry among local oarsmen
known repute.
Maryborough Flour Mills,
Owned by Messrs. Creaser and Emmett, are situated in
Kent street West, close to the railway line, and are in direct
communication with Adelaide, as well as the local railway
wharves. The building, which is of American design, is
constructed of wood and iron, and fitted up with the latest
and most approved machinery. It is 72ft. by 40ft., and


from the surface of the ground to the apex of the roof is
43ft. sin. There are three floors, together with an attic
roof formed out of the “Mansard roof.” Within the mill
are four large bins, each 20ft. Gin. deep by 12ft. Gin. square,
having hopper-shaped bottoms. The sides are strengthened
with -Jin. cast-iron rods passing through the bins at every
sft. Two smaller bins are also provided. The building
rests upon a good solid foundation, composed of hardwood
bed logs, 2ft. Bin. in diameter, with a good clay bottom
under, attached to the mill is the engine-room and office.
The former is 24ft. square, and ceiled with galvanised iron,
giving the room a pleasing aspect. The latter is 20ft. by
12ft., and neatly finished off with fittings, &c. At the back
of the building is a double floored platform, the top floor
being for delivering, the bottom for receiving. The motive
power is derived from a very strong and compact engine of
the horizontal type, fitted with expansion gear, and of 82
nominal horse-power. The boiler is of the multitubular
type, 12ft. by Gft. diameter, with 50 tubes made of mild
steel plate, of Queensland make. The mill throughout is
perfect in every detail, while the G in diamond brand flour
produced is of magnificent quality, and commands a splen-
did sale in the district.
Singular to relate, the company obtain almost all their
wheat from Adelaide, notwithstanding the fact that much
fine wheat land is within easy reach of Maryborough and
adjacent to the railway lines. Wheat-farmers are badly
wanted in the Maryborough district. Messrs. Greaser and
Emmett are prepared to buy all the good wheat which can
be grown in the district. They are at present using nearly
182,000 bushels per annum, paying per bushel for it on the
Maryborough wharves, and at this price farmers from the
south could speedily make a competence. The millowners
are willing to furnish all information to any agriculturists
who may be desirous of settling in the district. Last year
about 50 acres were all that was placed under wheat, while
thousands of acres of superb wheat lands are starving for
the plough and crying out to be cultivated. That a good
opening exists in the Wide Bay districts for farmers is an
undisputed fact, and, as before stated, the millowners are
anxious and willing to assist in every way to obtain a
greater production of wheat than at present obtains.

MARYBOROUGH FLOUR MILLS.


Jonathan Murray,
One of the most popular and energetic of Maryborough
citizens, was born at Prestonpans, Edinburgh, Scotland,
in 1844, and received bis education there. After serving
an apprenticeship to the grocery business in Galashiels he
sailed for Brisbane, arriving in 1868. After spending about
eighteen months in the metropolis, he came to Maryborough
with his brother James and entered into farming pursuits.
He was also associated with the late firm of Dowzer and
Purser, and was a prominent man with Mr. G. T. Watson.
He finally settled in Maryborough in 1871 and entered into
business on his own account. Since his arrival here Mr.
Murray has taken an active part in many public movements,
among which may be mentioned his connection with the
Municipal Council for over eight years, of the Chamber of
Commerce, the Wide Bay Pastoral and Agricultural Society,
and the Maryborough Rifle Club, in which he is considered
a “ crack shot,” having gained several prizes for hisl skill.
But it is more especially as President of the Caledonian
Society he has rendered good service, and the society really
owes its inception and prosperity to his energetic endeavours
in its cause. Mr. Murray is, as natural to suppose, a. lover
of the poet Robbie Burns, and is quite an authority on
matters concerning that eminent “ son of song.” He is also
a Presbyterian and Oddfellow, but very liberal in his views
and support of all benevolent and educational institutions.
Mr. Murray married the eldest daughter of the late Mr. T.
Miller, and has a family.

JAS. M. STAFFORD, (Mayors


It is the port of shipment for the whole of the Wide
Bay and Burnett districts, and though the chief and
only city, is no mean opponent of Rockhampton, and even
Brisbane. It has, from its inception, been a place of
progress, and though at intervals bad times and stagnation
have occurred, it has recovered from serious depressions,
and gone on steadily advancing to that premier stage which
its vast resources entitle it to hold. At the census of 1876
the population was 6,687 in the municipality, inclusive of
suburbs and agricultural settlements, which would number
about 6,000 more. In 1876 there were 74 miles of streets,
1,800 dwellings, and property rated at £400,000. The
stations in the neighbourhood are devoted to raising cattle
and sheep, and are mostly in a flourishing state. The stock
returns for January, 1879, were 3,200 horses, 86,176
cattle, 2,729 sheep, 2,162 pigs.
Fortunately Maryborough has been spared effects similar
to those that followed the land boom in Melbourne and
other places which wrought so much ruin and loss. The
construction of a large number of what are termed “cock-
spur railways” intended to act as “feeders” to main
lines, impoverished the railway service to such an extent
that a loss of fully £500,000 per annum was computed,
whilst hundreds of capable workmen, dismissed and inactive,
helped to swell the ranks of the unemployed. The building
trades were the first to feel the depression, and brick and
stone houses and even mansions were left idle, or, for fear
of mischief by larrikins, let at Is. per week—some of the
finest houses and villas, once let at £3 per week. All this
led to a feeling of unrest and unsecurity, with depression in
trade, and extensive migration of population. But if
Maryborough has not wasted its surplus capital or unsale-
able ground and expensive tenements, the erection of com-
fortable habitations for the masses has been greatly
neglected, and whilst there are signs of change in all this,
brick and stone tenements of a substantial character are
supplanted by buildings of a less ambitious order ; and a
great deal of bricklayers and masons’ work will have to be
done in the way of filling in gaps and vacancies ere Mary-
borough can take the proud title of city, to which it aspires,
with credit. Though the few, rather than the many, are
comfortably housed, it is universally admitted that the day


of bark humpies and weatherboard cottages, or slab and
bark huts is at an end, and that superior dwellings should
be erected for the humbler classes. Though Maryborough
proper is undoubtedly a beautiful city, with public and
private edifices which compare favourably with any in
Southern cities, still many of its vacant allotments would,
if utilized, cause the opening up of new stone quarries, the
establishment of brick-kilns, and the employment of a
large number of artizans. A plea for the construction of a
better class of houses than in the past is found in the fact
that most of the buildings erected not more than twenty
years are terribly damaged through the ravages of the
white ant.
The municipality was formed February Ist, 1851. Area,
22 square miles; 100 miles of streets. *18,600 popula-
tion last census ; municipality, 8,700; district, 18,000;

His Worship thr Mayor, James Malcolm Stafford, is a
native of Ipswich, Queensland. Born, June 25, 1859, and
educated at the primary and grammar schools in that town.
Articled to the law, Mr. Stafford has ever since made legal
matters his constant study, and is regarded as a high
authority on such, not only here but elsewhere. First elected
Mayor of Maryborough in 1892. His decisions and ruling
in the Municipal Council are seldom disputed, whilst his
gentlemanly bearing and ability always command respect.
Aldermen.
Chas. Rabaa, native of Wurtemburg, Germany. Born,
1848. Arrived in Brisbane by ship Helena, 1856, and came
to Maryborough in the same year, where he did no small
share of pioneering work with teams on the imperfectly
formed tracks leading to and from the stations of the
Burnett district. He returned to Maryborough and settled
down in 1875 as lessee of the Royal Exchange Hotel,
Adelaide street. Elected alderman in the local council in
February, 1894, and has since taken active part in all its
movements. Councillor Rabaa is a man possessed of great
decision of character and sound common-sense, which he
brings to bear on all his transactions in daily life. Actuated
by disinterested motives for the welfare of the city of his
adoption, Councillor Rabaa has been instrumental in doing
much good, and the spirit of progress inherent in his nature
might be advantageously adopted by others.
Fritz Kinne. Born in Germany December 20, 1844.
Arrived in Maryborough, 1870, by ship Australian, and
entered into business as contractor and builder. Elected to
Municipal Council in 1890, elected Mayor in 1895 and held
office till 1896, when he resigned, but not seeking re-election
retired into private life. Mr. Kinne was till recently pro-
prietor and landlord of the Great Western Hotel, Lennox
street, Maryborough. His liberal principles have made him
popular with the masses, and he did much to advance the
interests of the town. Accompanied by Mrs. Kinne, he is
now taking a holiday trip to his native land.
Carl Christian Julius Jocumsen was born at Denmark
in 1856, and came to Maryborough June 18, 1878, since
which he has taken active part in local progressive move-
ments. Elected alderman of Municipal Council in February,


1896, and has done much good in that capacity. As all
attempts to establish a local market appeared unavailing Mr.
Jocumsen, with commendable zeal, started a farmers’
agency for the sale of dairy and other produce. This has
become a leading institution in the community, and is well
patronised by district farmers, who on Saturdays bring in
their produce from far and near. Mr. Jocumsen is connected
with several societies, but chief of these is the Protestant
Alliance, of which he is a Past Master.
James MacAdam Dawson is a native of Glasgow, Scotland.
Born in 1848, and educated at Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Arrived in Victoria in 1850 and went to Sandhurst and
adjacent diggings in 1868, and visited New Zealand and
other localities till 1888, when he returned to the colonies
and came to Maryborough in 1886, where he established
the business for which the Lombards were famed, and
which he still continues. Recently recognising that there
was an opening for auctioneering, Mr. Dawson combined
that business with the other and holds weekly auction sales,
in which he is assisted by his two sons. Mr. Dawson is
held in high esteem in the community, his genial
manner, and ability command universal respect, and
his election as alderman to the Maryborough Municipal
Council in January, 1896, was regarded with great satis-
faction by his many friends and the public. He also
contested the Burrum electorate against E. N. Tooth, M.P.,
polling a number of votes and making a close contest. It
is gratifying to know that the local municipal body have
an able financier like Mr. Dawson connected with it, as he
is able to advance money on good securities, and in time of
need, with a big overdraft to grapple with, might even loan
a respectable sum on the Town Hall, with a view to
redisposal for firewood. Alderman Dawson is an advocate
for democracy, pure and simple. Liberal almost to a fault,
he has been instrumental in doing much good, but is
utterly opposed to spending municipal funds without
obtaining corresponding advantages.
J. S. McGhie, formerly District Superintendent of Rail-
ways, now alderman of the Municipal Council and member
of Chamber of Commerce. Alderman McGhie is a gentle-
man whose opinions command respect, and he is one of the
most popular men in the community. ;


John Norman, native of Ayrshire, Scotland, arrived
in Maryborough in 1888, where he established his present
large tailoring business. Elected Alderman in 1891, being
for three years chairman of the Waterworks Department.
Was re-elected in 1894. Was twice a candidate for the Legis-
lature in the labor interest, his liberal views making him
very popular with the electors.
Charles Booker, commission agent, of Lennox street, is
the son of Mr. C. E. S. Booker, of local butchering fame,
and was elected alderman in the Municipal Council in
1896. He is a native of Maryborough, and long identified
with its industries and public movements.
Jajvies Equestrian Noakes. Born at sea in 1844 on the
ship Equestrian, after which he was named. Mr. Noakes’
career may be thus summarized :—Educated in Sydney.
Served apprenticeship with J. Ranken and Co., store-
keepers, Maitland, N.S.W. Arrived in Maryborough in
1864, when he was for some time engaged as confidential
manager for Ranken and Co. Commenced business on his
own account in 1868, and carried it on successfully for
about twenty years. Is at present engaged in sugar
growing at Bundaberg, where he has a large plantation.
Mr. Noakes is one of the best known and most popular
men in Maryborough. He was appointed to the Com-
mission of the Peace in 1885. Has been a member of the
local Chamber of Commerce for about ten years, and of
the Maryborough Permanent Building Society since its
inception. Superintendent of the Church of England
Sunday School for fully twenty-eight years. Holds high
honours in the L.0.1.; is member of the School of Arts
committee, trustee of the Grammar School, and the Wide
Bay Pastoral Association. Mr. Noakes is an active member
of the local municipal council. He was the founder of the
first cricketing eleven, and a most liberal supporter of
educational and other movements calculated to benefit the
spot of his adoption.
WATER SUPPLY.
The original water supply for Old Maryborough was the
Ululah Reservoir, a picturesque though artificial sheet of
water, a mile from the town, surrounded by park-like


grounds, which form a secluded and charming resort. On
the sea coasts about twenty miles from the town are the
marine resorts of Urangan, Poison and Pialba. At the sea
mouth is Bingham, a township almost unknown. Half
way up the river from thence to Maryborough is the timber
getting settlement of Dundathu, now deserted save by one
man (Jackson) who has charge of the telephone service.
To the westward of New Maryborough on the Gayndah
road, immediately below a picturesque gorge of the river is
West Maryborough, known also as the “ old township.”
On the right bank of the river is the hamlet of Tinana, or
One Mile, as it was first called, and further down beyond
the Horseshoe Bend, opposite the town, is Howard, or East
Maryborough, famed for Chinese market gardens. Further
on are Owanyilla and Tiaro, the latter at the head of boat
navigation on the Mary.
Report by Mr. D. Kerr (Foreman of Works, Mary-
borough Municipal Council) on the Maryborough Water
Supply for 1896 :—The water is drawn from Tinana Creek,
at the head of tidal waters, about nine miles from the
Town Hall. The quality is good and in volume equal to
the requirements of a large manufacturing city. A concrete
dam has been made across the creek on a rock bar which
crosses the creek at the head of tidal water; this dam can
be raised when required; at present it dams the water back
in the creek for about three miles. The supply is drawn
through a tunnel from the creek into the filtering well,
from which it passes into the pumping well. The wells are
connected by a short tunnel with a water-proof door
between; both walls are about 12 feet deeper than the
tunnel, the bottom forms a silt trap. Both wells and
tunnel are lined with brick and cement; the wells are 60ft.
deep. The engine, which occupies half of the pumping
well, is known as the Compound Rotative Beam, and is
capable of working up to 75 h.p.
The water is pumped from the well into a 10-inch cast-iron
main and forced through it into the service reservoir, which
is situated on the Alpha Sugar Plantation, two miles
towards Maryborough on the Teddington road, and about
110 feet above the floor of the Town Hall. The reservoir
is circular, 101 feet 6 inches in diameter, and holds about
700,000 gallons of water when full; it is lined with brick
and cement.


The town is supplied from the reservoir by gravitation
through a nine (9) inch main over six miles in length; the
part which is laid in the river bed above the bridge is of
wrought iron 12 inches in diameter. The central part of
the town is supplied by two 6 inch mains and Newtown by
one 6-inch main. About twenty-five miles of mains are
laid altogether. The plans of the works were prepared in
1877 by Mr. W. Highfield, and the works was begun that
year. Messrs. Linklater and Thompson were contractors
for excavating and lining the wells and tunnel, and excavat-
ing the branch for the main from the pumps to the river
bank. Messrs. G. Watson and E. G. Paxter were in
charge when the work was started. Towards the end of
the year (Mr. D. Kerr, who had been Clerk of Works on
the Ipswich and Toowoomba waterworks, then finished)
arrived and took charge of the works. The tunnel and
wells were partly excavated at this time, but the whole of
this undertaking was carried out by him (except the laying
of this first syphon in the Mary River which broke up
during the ’9O flood). The pipe-laying and jointing was
all done by day labour under the personal supervision of
Mr. Kerr. Messrs. Tooth and Co. made and erected the
present machinery. They also made and laid the present
syphon, and are now erecting a duplication of the pumping
machinery with a few alterations to strengthen it for
pumping over a 50 foot standpipe at the reservoir, and to
make it suitable for the present using main. Mr. D.
Jaffrey has been in charge of the machinery since the
works were finished. The works generally have proved
substantial and easy of maintenance. When the new
pump and standpipe is completed the supply available can
be considerably increased by pumping over the standpipe.
Maryborough has fourteen miles frontage to the Mary
River, nine miles to Saltwater Creek, three miles land
frontage from the river to its intersection with Saltwater
Creek, or a total of twenty-six miles boundary line. About
twelve miles water frontage is navigable.
Great dissatisfaction has been expressed at the inferior
quality of the water in Maryborough, and it is therefore the
more gratifying to announce that Mr. L. Steindl, who
recently put down a bore at his brewery at Granville, has
struck a large quantity of a splendid article which affords


a marked contrast in clearness and brilliancy to that in
general use. Mr. Steindl, knowing the importance of
securing the best quality in water for brewing purposes, a
few months ago had a well sunk on his premises—sft. 6in.
in diameter and 86ft. from the surface down, and being
bricked and cemented had much the appearance of a large
tank. It was from the bottom of this that Mr. Dickinson,
an experienced well-sinker, put down cast iron pipes in the
bore mentioned, and at 87ft. from the surface, struck an
inexhaustible supply of pellucid water, which is thought to
come from Tinana, and such being the case Mr. Steindl is
to be congratulated on having scored one against our local
waterworks authorities, in obtaining an abundant supply of
the pure Teddington water filtered through the porous
rock instead of being through iron pipes.
Whilst the discovery of this grand supply of pure water will
have a direct influence on Steindl’s beer, it is gratifying to
know that there is such a large supply of excellent water if
necessary for future requirements. Mr. Dickinson, who has
successfully carried out Mr. Steindl’s bore, has done much
boring of a similar character for coal and minerals in these
districts, the most important of which was that at Mr.
Woodyatt’s about ten years ago.
The following report and description of the city and
suburbs was contributed by Mr. J. M. La Barte, and other
friends.
Maryborough, the principal town in the Wide Bay and
Burnett districts, is situated on the River Mary, about 177
miles north-west of Brisbane. It is a port of considerable
importance, and enjoys regular communication with all
ports north and south by mail steamers twice a week,
besides several other seamers, sailing vessels, and craft of
every kind. On the 4th of May, 1842, Mr. Andrew
Petrie, Mr. Henry Stuart Russell, and two other gentlemen
left Brisbane on an exploring trip to the Wide Bay
districts, and on the 17th of the same month they anchored
at the mouth of a river which was afterwards named The
Mary, in honour of Lady Fitzroy, wife of the Governor-in-
Chief of New South Wales. The privations and difficulties
experienced and encountered by this exploring party, the
finding of “Wandi” and “ Duramboi ” (two white men


who were held prisoners by the aborigines for some years);
the inquiry into the fate of the Stirling Castle, a vessel
wrecked in the vicinity of Fraser’s Island, the survivors of
which were mostly roasted and eaten; and the further
labours and adventures of Mr. Petrie and his companions
—are they not all written in the local chronicles ? The
past is shrouded in mist, and the historian is compelled to
weave the dazzling web of imagination around the few bare
facts which have been preserved, but it may be mentioned
that in July, 1847, Mr. Burnett was despatched by the New
South Wales Government to make a further examination
of the Wide Bay and Burnett districts. His report was
satisfactory to all parties, and to the few residents of
Moreton Bay in particular. He stated that Wide Bay
would never compete with Moreton Bay, although it would
form an excellent harbour for coasting vessels, and would
in the course of a few years become a place of considerable
trade—subsequent events proving the accuracy of this
judgment. Attention being thus directed to a navigable
river and to a fertile district, population began to go north.
Sheep and cattle stations were formed, boiling-downs
established, and the foundations of peaceful settlement
laid. The early history of Maryborough differs very little
from that of many townships in Queensland and New
South Wales. There was the era of bark humpies, then
the age of wood and iron, and now the roundmg-out and
the enduring monuments of brick and stone. It was a
peaceful and progressive evolution, advanced rapidly,
perhaps, by the discovery of the Gympie goldfields in the
sixties. From its inception to the present day Maryborough
has been fortunate in capturing and retaining high-
principled men—those who came out to the colony to make
a home in it, and who were not at ease with their con-
sciences unless they were doing their level best, not only
for themselves but for the town of their adoption. Mary-
borough is the Glasgow of Queensland, and contains more
Scotchmen than any other town in the colony. Perhaps
that is the reason of its present enviable position, not only
in regard to its practical but also poetical characteristics.
The members for the town are Messrs. J. T. Annear and
J. Bartholomew, M’s.L.A., whilst Mr, N. E. N. Tooth
represents the Burrum.


Municipal.
On the 2nd of February, 1851, Maryborough was
established as a township, but it took a full decade to grow
and be incorporated into a municipality, this important
event taking place in March of 1861. On the 26th of
April Mr. Henry Palmer was elected as first Mayor; but
his reign was short, for in August he was supplanted by
Mr. John Eaton, who served the remainder of the term.
Owing to various causes municipal government was not an
entire success in Maryborough, and in June, 1874, the
council lapsed, but was reincorporated during the following
year, and since then has gone on abounding in good works
and loans. , ._ _
The town has an area of 22 square miles and 100 miles
of streets, no insignificant portion of this world’s surface
to be under the jurisdiction of one council. The popula-
tion of the municipality is set down at 8,700, and that of
the district at about 18,000. The estimated capital value
of rateable property is placed at £557,657 ; total revenue,
£15,192; total expenditure, £15,986; rates received,
£10,978 ; total assets, £88,588; total liabilities, £66,060.
There are 1,876 voters on the municipal roll.
Maryborough is picturesque and elegant, with broad,
well-kept streets, handsome public and private buildings,
and a wealth of floral beauty not surpassed by any town in
Queensland. It may be described as one great garden,
extending from the river’s edge to the boundaries of the
municipality. The town lies on an arm of the river—
almost a peninsula —and the land is unusually fertile,
composed principally of alluvial soil. Years ago a taste for
floriculture was promoted owing to the close attention
bestowed by Mr. E. B. Sheridan on the public gardens, and
the dreariness of the town speedily gave place to floral
opulence. Gardens abound everywhere; the meanest
labourer has his plot of ground, and grows some bright
flowers or tasty shrubs. It is true of Maryborough, above
all places in Queensland, that every man can sit under the
shadow of his own vine and figtree ; he can also have his
cow and acre of ground; and in politics he is, too, offered
abundant choice. The public gardens occupy a large area
of ground on the north bank of the river, and are within
one minute’s walk of the main street. They are altogether


beautiful, rich with shady avenues, clumps of bamboos,
bosky dells, green swards, placid ponds, delicate ferns and
flowers, and sturdy fig-trees of every known kind. Tropical
and temperate plants and flowers flourish in close juxtaposi-
tion. The waters of the river wash the banks, and in order
that one may not forget the solid things of daily life, a
railway line runs through the gardens, enabling coal and
timber to be delivered at the garden wharves. The railway
is not a disfigurement, as might be supposed, indeed it gives
to the gardens some necessary hard lines which serve to
intensify the soft colouring which prevails. As before
mentioned, the cottage gardens are a great feature in the
town under notice, and the residences of Messrs. Corser,
Stupart, Harrington, A. H. Wilson, Hart, White,
Harrington, Braddock, and many others are exceedingly
pretty. A typical home, a sketch of which is presented, is
that of Mr. James Stafford. The place is named Oonooraba,
so called because the ground was once the fighting place of
the blacks. Four and a half years ago the house was built
of fine pine and beech, and the quality of the timber was of
the best. The plot comprises six acres, and it was on the
spot where the house now stands that the first humpy was
seen thirty-five years ago. It commands a fine view of the
Ululah Reserve, a chain of fine waterholes, where the wild
fowl love to dwell. Before the house is a fine circular
lawn, two and a half chains in diameter, with a carriage
drive around it. On either side of the lawn are ten
beautiful Araucarias (Gookii). These, forming the inner
boundary of the drive, with the Eugenia macrocarpa and
Araucaria excelsa as the outer one, make a pleasing and
rich front. Mr. Stafford has proved beyond question that
the Japanese national flower, the chrysanthemum, is not
alone suited to the cooler climates of the south, as at the
last chrysanthemum show in Brisbane he secured the
champion prize for size and quality against all comers.
Beds of them are to be found on the shady side of the
house, and they will help to do Maryborough honour before
the season closes. One inestimable advantage of the situa-
tion is its “ openness.” A fair view of the town is seen
from the front, with the hospital buildings away on the
south, while on the other side is a panorama of river, dale,
and hill, the landscape being dotted with houses, cultivated

fields, and patches of rich scrub. It is a home to make
glad the heart of man.
The principal street in Maryborough is Kent street, a
fine thoroughfare with not a few pretentious buildings,
notably the School of Arts, the A.J.S. and Commercial
Banks, the Royal Hotel, Grammar School, State School,
and other places. Adelaide street is the second thorough-
fare, the Fire Brigade Station and the Wesleyan Church
being the only edifices worthy of notice. In Bazaar street
is the Roman Catholic Church, the A.M.P. Buildings the
Post Office, Wide Bay News office, and the commanding
premises of Woodrow and Son. In the lower part of Kent
street are the shipbuilding yards of Walkers Limited, the
sawmills of Hyne and Son, and the new mill of the
Maryborough Sugar Factory Co. Facing the river are the
Court House, Custom House, Wilson, Hart and Co.’s saw-
mills, with wharves, slips, and the various riverside buildings
necessary to a commercial centre. The city has an
industrial appearance, and possesses two large foundries,
three sawmills, a flourmill, two steam joineries, and scores
of small establishments. The foundries and sawmills may
be set down as the largest and best appointed of the kind in
Queensland. Around and about the town are many elegant
sacred edifices. The Presbyterian Church occupies °the
best site in the place. As will be seen from the illustration
it is a handsome building, and has for its pastor the Rev. J.
I. Knipe, who for 27 years has faithfully carried out his
duties, and who is the most cultured and soundest expositor
of the Scriptures north of Brisbane. The Wesleyan
Church is another striking building, while the Anglican
Church is happy in the possession of a splendid peal of
bells, the gift of a deceased parishioner. The Roman
Catholic Church, a time-worn brick structure almost hidden
by trees, is shortly to give place to a stone erection, which
will be adorned by the graces of latter-day architecture.
The Town Hall of Maryborough should be carted out to the
suburbs and used as a storehouse—it is a disfigurement to the
main street. Very conspicuous is the Fire Brigade Station,
rearing its head in Adelaide street. It is thoroughly well
equipped and controlled by a watchful and ever ready
corps of firemen. Theatrical companies need have no
fear they will not be able to secure a hall to play in ; there

are four really commodious places, and several small halls
owned by different lodges. The local hospital is outside
the boundaries of the town, and is far too large for the
requirements of Maryborough. There are altogether three
huge brick buildings, besides a Polynesian ward. Uncon-
trolled generosity has had much to do with such a lavish
expenditure in bricks. The buildings are elegant and
exceedingly commodious, but one great division is empty,
and likely to remain so unless there is a startling outbreak
of cholera, smallpox, or typhoid, which is not likely to
occur in such a cleanly place as Maryborough, where clean-
liness and godliness may always be found hand in hand.
The grounds are very tastefully laid out, and the front
entrance is adorned with three chaste lamps set in an
elegant iron circle, and adorned with scroll and fretwork.
Dr. Garde is surgeon, while Mrs. O’Connor is the experi-
enced and trusty matron. The Lady Musgrave Lying-in
Hospital is a pretty wooden structure to be found in another
part of the town.
The School of Arts is the pride of every Maryborough
citizen. Outside of Brisbane it is the finest institution of
the kind in Queensland —externally and internally. It is
the lion of the town, and every visitor is in duty bound to
go over the institution and admire it. Its present state of
blessedness is the result of many years of intelligent and
discriminating labour. The work was commenced on 80th
May, 1860, when at a public meeting it was resolved to
open a subscription list towards erecting a building to be
called “ The Maryborough School of Arts and Reading
Room.” Money was speedily raised; £2OO was obtained
from the Government, and on the sth February of the
following year the erection of a wooden building, to cost
£4BO, was commenced. A quarter of a century later the
cottage had outgrown its usefulness, and it had to make
way for the present beautiful building, which was erected
at a cost of £3,000. The library of the present institution
contains over 7,000 volumes, while 87 papers are furnished
to the reading-room. The works in the library are divided
as follows :—Arts and sciences, 490 ; history and historical
works, 207 biography, 258 ; philosophy and theology, 125 ;
voyages and travels, 441 ; poetry, the drama, and classics,
108; magazines, periodicals, and reviews, 38; fiction,


2,867; juvenile literature, 860; works of reference, 46.
Attached to the institution is a good museum, wherein may
be found specimens of minerals from all parts of Australia,
technically named, and including 144 samples of ores
crushed at the Aldershot smelting works, showing the
quantity crushed and yield of gold obtained; a large
collection of reptiles, photographs, and preserved specimens
of Queensland fishes, including the almost extinct cera-
todus ; a first-class collection of birds, arranged with much
skill, and all named; collections of shells, insects, and
coins ; specimens of Queensland and New Zealand timbers,
marketable and otherwise; curios from Japan, the South
Sea Islands, New Guinea, New Zealand, and Pompeii.
Carrying out the full meaning of ‘ its title, technical
education is an important part of the work of the institu-
tion. Nearly 150 pupils attend the various classes—
shorthand, mechanical and freehand drawing, painting in
oil and water colour, singing, harmony, carpentry, book-
keeping, ambulance, scientific lectures (illustrated by means
of lantern and oxy-hydrogen light). The session generally
includes a university and a juvenile course of special
lectures. An expensive and complete set of appliances for
the electrical, chemical, ambulance, and physic classes form
no mean part of the assets of the institution. The secretary
of the School of Arts is Mr. David Gardner, a popular,
active, resolute, high-principled gentleman, who has ever
displayed the warmest interest in his work, and since 1890
has conceived and carried into practice many of the attrac-
tions of the institution.
The Schools.
The State schools at Maryborough are the Central, with
nearly 500 children, the Albert with over 600, and the
Newtown with over 800. Besides these there are suburban
schools at Granville, with nearly 200, Tinana with 200, and
Sunbury with 100. The Central has separate departments,
under head teachers, for boys, girls, and infants ; all the
others are mixed. A visit to any one would be a revelation
to outsiders. All the buildings are handsome and com-
modious, with ample grounds. The walls are profusely
decorated with pictures, and the grounds filled with trees
and flowers. Nor is this all, the inspectors of the Education


BOYS’ GRAMMAR SCHOOL, MARYBOROUGH.


Department speak in high terms of the management of
these schools. More Grammar School Scholarships are
taken in Maryborough than in either Gympie or Bunda-
berg, the Albert School, under the tutelage of Mr. James,
having secured no less than 24 during the past six years.
The Roman Catholic and Convent Schools are also largely
attended, and the Christian Brothers’ institution is invari-
ably well attended and excellent results follow the periodical
examinations. Devoted to the higher education are two
admirable institutions—the Boys’ and Girls’ Grammar
Schools. These handsome edifices, charmingly situated,
facing each other on opposite sides of Kent street, are
thoroughly equipped and appointed, and surrounded by
large and tastefully laid-out grounds, and are unsurpassed
by any schools of the class in the colony. The past
records of both schools completely bear out all that
is claimed for them. The boys’ school particularly has,
by reason of the conspicuous successes of former scholars,
ganied a high colonial reputation, which is in no danger
of being lowered by the scholars now coming forward.
The Grammar Schools have been established 18 years, and
in the course of that time have acquired many tender
associations. It was in the year 1878, after a good deal of
correspondence and agitation in the public Press on the
advisableness of establishing a Grammar School in Mary-
borough, that Mr. R. M. Hyne, the then Mayor of Mary-
borough, brought the matter to a practical issue. Prior to
this Maryborough scholarship boys—and there were
generally a good number of them—served their terms chiefly
at the Ipswich or Toowoomba Grammar Schools. Public
meetings were held, and in the course of a few months
over £2OOO were raised by subscriptions and a bazaar.
More than was necessary to found the boys’ school and
obtain the Government endowment having been secured, it
was decided to apply the surplus to a girls’ school. After
the site had been selected, tenders for the boys’ school were
called, and that of Henry Taylor accepted at £5,500, the
design being that of Mr. Hall, of Brisbane. Good progress
was made, and the school opened on Monday morning, sth
September, 1881, the attendance being 24 boys and 26
girls—girls and boys then using the boys’ school, as
tenders had not yet been called for the girls’ school. Mr.


James Murdoch, M.A., was head master, and Miss Budgett
head mistress. Since then members of the staff, as well
as pupils, have come and gone. Mr. Murdoch was suc-
ceeded by Mr. Vaughan in 1885, who in turn gave place to
Mr. J. Thomson at the end of 1890, though Mr. Thomson
had prior to this held the position of third master from the
starting of the school. Mr. Charles H. Barton is another
old member of the staff, having handed over the secretary-
ship of the school in 1882 to Mr. Jas. Marsden, and
accepted the position of second and classical master, which
he still occupies. The other members of the staff are all
highly'qualified teachers from England. The excellent
progress of the school necessitated additional accommoda-
tion, and this was secured in 1890 by the erection of a
handsome wing to the main building and other buildings
at a cost of £8,500. The school has now accommodation
for 85 boarders and from 150 to 200 day scholars. The
school and grounds now form one of the prettiest sights in
Maryborough, and a visit over both is desirable. The
gardens are well laid out, the handsome shade trees all
about having now reached sturdy proportions, while the
flower-beds are always covered with blossoms. On one
side of the school is the cricket and football ground, with a
first-class concrete wicket, and, as the school is well sup-
plied with cricketing and football material, both games
flourish. On the other side of the building, is the gymna-
sium, all the paraphernalia being under a spacious pavilion
and over a tanbark floor, upon which the boys, if they fall,
receive no injury. Unless specially excused, each boy
must go through a course of gymnastic training* and
physical drill. There is also a good cadet corps, and a fine
tennis court provides good sport. Mr. Thomson, the head
master, is also the resident master, and, with the invaluable
aid of Mrs. Thomson, manages the house in a manner
greatly appreciated by parents and thoroughly conducive to
the domestic welfare and comfort of the boarders. The
school appears to Jack nothing that is essential to such an
establishment. The sanitary arrangements are excellent;
water is laid on throughout the building. There are six or
seven bathrooms adjacent to the dormitories, which are
roomy and well lighted, each boy having a comfortable bed
to himself. The discipline of the school is good, and


Mr. Thomson has imparted to it a kindly and improving
home influence. The culinary department is first-class.
It is questionable whether the kitchen of any hotel is so
well fitted up and so amply supplied with all cooking
requisites. The same may be said of the washhouse and
laundry, where there are the best appliances and the
utmost cleanliness. The classrooms are large, and there is
a chemical laboratory, containing everything that is neces-
sary m the teaching of chemistry, physics, mechanics, and
other allied scientific subjects. The school has a valuable
reference library for the masters, and another large collec-
tion of well and carefully selected books on travel, adven-
ture, and other attractive subjects for the boys. There is
good stable accommodation for the horses of boys who ride
into school from the surrounding districts. The scholars of
the Boys’ Grammar School have always held a high position
in the Sydney University Senior and Junior Examinations,
and gold and silver medals have been won as well. The
school has been fortunate in the matter of private
bequests. In addition to three entrance scholorships
and two commercial scholarships, there are three “Mel-
ville bursaries,” all open annually and worth from £l2
12s. down to £4 4s. Three honour boards in the
main schoolroom, nearly filled with names, testify to
the distinction gained by the boys attending this school in
the past. Facing the boys’ school, on the opposite side of
Kent street, and nestling cosily upon four acres of land,
amidst camphor laurels and blossom-laden flower-beds, is
the very pretty Girls’ School. This handsome building
and the well laid out grounds form quite a beauty spot, and
young girls could hardly be brought up in a more appro-
priate and beneficial environment than surrounds and
influences them here. It has already been stated in dealing
with the boys’ school that the early establishment of a
separate school was the result of the great success attend-
ing the founding of the boys’ school, and the fact that
there was a very large surplus sum in hand from the
proceeds of the bazaar in 1880, which the ladies at the
time decided should form the nucleus of a fund for the
girls’ school. Pressure on the space of the boys’ school
hurried the project on, and shortly after the completion of
the latter the girls’ school was started. The building was

completed and taken possession of in 1883, having cost
£8,896. The school served its purpose well till 1891,
when, further accommodation being required, very hand-
some additions, costing £2,300 were carried out. The
school as it stands now is a large and beautiful residence.
The staff of the girls’ school has always been a most
efficient one, and the results have invariably been satis-
factory. In 1882 Miss Caroline Darling succeeded Miss
Budget as head mistress, and in 1889 was in turn succeeded
by Miss A. Martin. The present head mistress, Miss
Millicent Wilkinson, has only recently taken charge, but
those who have already become acquainted with her have
discovered that she adds to a charming manner and bright
intelligence a large experience of her work, and a good deal
of enthusiasm in carrying it out. Apart from her pro-
ficiency in the routine studies of the school, Miss Wilkinson
has special accomplishments, musical and artistic. The
present staff is a capable one, and the future work of the
school should be very creditable. It is hardly necessary to
say that the school grounds, which are in charge of a pro-
fessional gardener, are very attractive. The school externally
pleases the eye, and is within a model of comfort and
cleanliness. As with the boys’ school, so here the utmost
care has been bestowed upon the most perfect drainage and
other sanitary arrangements. The classrooms and bed-
rooms are cool and well ventilated and lighted, and the
view from all the windows is simply delightful. The school
possesses probably a finer hall than any other grammar
school in the colony. It is beautifully lined with polished
cedar and pine panels, architraves, and other ornamental
devices. Altogether the comforts and the conveniences
which the girls who board at this school enjoy are such as
the majority of our citizens are unable to afford in their
own homes. There is accommodation at present for 20
boarders and a large attendance of day scholars. The girls’
school as well as the boys’ is endowed with annual scholar-
ships and three Melville bursaries.
There are eight churches in the town —Church of England
(Rev. R. R. Eva), Roman Catholic (Rev. John O’Reilly),
Presbyterian (Rev. J. I. Knipe), Wesleyan (Rev. H. Pen-
nington), Lutheran (Rev. F. Copas), Primitive Methodist
(Rev. A. Harding), Baptist (Rev. C. Boyall), andCongrega-

tional (Rev. J. C. Harris). The Salvation Army has also
many followers, and possesses a fine barracks and a good
band. A few Christadelphians meet each Sunday in the
Oddfellows’ Room. As before stated, nearly all the church
buildings in the town are handsome and palatial.
Maryborough is decidedly a musical town, and many of
those who swing the hammer in the foundries are capable
of wielding the baton at high-class concerts. Musical
entertainments occupy first place among the amusements
of the residents, and they are invariably well attended.
The musical societies have been the means of bringing
together two or three really fine orchestras, and lately
there has been formed a company of bellringers, who give
promise of high ability. With music in the heart, and
flowers in the home, there is no place for social impurity
in the town. Then there are rowing, cricket, and football
clubs, all well patronised by the sturdy youth of the place ;
a horticultural society, and the Wide Bay and Burnett
Pastoral and Agricultural Association, which holds an
annual exhibition ; and a jockey club, which is only fitfully
supported. Of lodges and clubs there are not a few—
Freemasons, Protestant Alliance, Good Templars, Recha-
bites, Hibernian, Oddfellows, Caledonians, railway servants
and the fire brigade. The Wide Bay Defence Force has
also its quarters at Maryborough; but the military instincts
of the people are not very pronounced. The fine river is
conducive to picnic parties, steamer excursions, and
regattas. Pialba, one of the prettiest watering places in
Queensland, is only two hours’ drive along a magnificent
road, and those whose taste for recreation runs in a quiet
groove can nightly enjoy an hour’s literary recreation at
the School of Arts.
Four newspapers are published in the town —the Mary-
borough Chronicle , published daily ; the Wide Bay News,
published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday ; the
Colonist, weekly ; and the Patriot, weekly. The Chronicle
inclines to an advanced Conservatism ; the News, to a breezy
Radicalism. The Colonist is the well-edited weekly issue
of the Chronicle, and finds strong support in the immediate
district. The Patriot is an audacious social scourger, and
strong supporter of the Labour party. The Maryborough


people are well served by the Chronicle and News. Each
has a wide circulation, and each is healthy in tone. The
News has an originality of its own quite refreshing.
Justice is dispensed with an even hand by the Police
Magistrate, Mr. George L. Lukin, who has been in the
Civil Service of the colony for 88 years, and whose experi-
ence is unmatched probably by any other Civil servant in
Queensland. Common sense usually sits at his right hand,
and kindness on his left, and the unfortunates who come
before him invariably get justice tempered with a broad
mercy, He has served from the Palmer, north, to the
MTntyre Brook, south, and Roma, west, and as Under-
secretary for Mines and Police Magistrate has ever acquitted
himself as an honourable, upright gentleman. Another
old colonist is Mr. Joseph Moore La Barte, clerk, valuator,
inspector of works, rate collector, and sanitary inspector to
the Burrum Divisional Board. He is a clever, cultured
gentleman of vast colonial experience, and has had more
than his fair share of ups and downs. I am indebted to
him for much information respecting the suburbs and
district of Maryborough. Every detail is at his fingers’
end, and at the command of any enquiring mind. As a
roadmaker he has more than a local reputation, and the
fine ironstone roads around Maryborough are largely owing
to the intelligent and practical oversight of Mr. La Barte.
The products of Maryborough and district may be briefly
summarised—timber, coal, minerals, sugar, fruit, and
oysters. Pine, hardwood, and cedar are found in the
neighbouring scrubs, and most of it when so vn and dressed
at the mills is readily purchased in Northern Queensland.
Messrs. Hyne and Son and Wilson and Hart weekly send
shipments by their own boats and steamers to Northern
ports. Coal is extensively worked at the Howard, Torbanlea,
and the Burrum collieries. Howard is about 18 miles from
the town, a place with about 450 inhabitants, and possess-
ing a good State school, three churches, and several well-
planted orchards. As stated elsewhere, minerals are found
all over the district —at Paradise, Eidsvold, the Shamrock,
Biggenden, and other places. Sugar planting is going on
apace, and a great deal of fresh ground is now being cleared
and ploughed. The opening out of the Isis Scrub has put
Maryborough in good heart, and great expectations are


being laid out for the future, when the scrub lands are
converted into fields of sugarcane. 'The alluvial character
of the soil renders Maryborough a promising fruit-growing
district, and scores of fine orangeries are to be met with
near the town. Over 20,000 cases of oranges annually find
their way south during the months of February, March,
and April. Experts speak of the fruit as of the highest
quality, superior to any grown in any part of Australia.
The demand from the south is steadily growing, and large
orders have lately been received from Victoria. When more
care is taken with the picking and grading of the fruit, the
orchardists may expect to reap large profits. Plums, pears,
nectarines, and strawberries, together with other fruits
are acclimatised throughout the district. Oyster-fishing is
extensively carried on in Wide Bay. Nearly all the bivalves
are shipped to Sydney and Melbourne, and command high
prices.
Thanks to a hardworking Chamber of Commerce,
insatiable members of Parliament, and a clamorous people,
Maryborough is well served in the matter of railways. She
is connected with Brisbane in the south, 160 miles away,
and with Bundaberg and Rosedale in the north. The trip
from Brisbane occupies eight hours, and the scenery is
most interesting all the way. The railway runs towards
the west 57 miles, and it is to the development of the land
which this line taps that Maryborough will have ere long
to give close attention. Agitation is on foot to construct a
line to the watering-place, Pialba, 22 miles away, but as
this line is more of a luxury than a necessity, and as it has
clinging around it just a suspicion of land booming, it
would be well to hang it up till better times, and push
ahead the Western line as far as Gayndah. Thousands of
acres of wheat land are lying in the west waiting the
advent of the plough, while year by year hundreds of
pounds are drifting to Adelaide for wheats and breadstuffs.
Suburbs and District.
On the south bank of the River Mary lies the suburb of
Granville, a thriving offshoot of the town previous to the
great flood of 1893, when the whole of the town part front-
ing the river was totally submerged, scores of houses being
bodily carried away, and the sites totally destroyed by the


rushing waters. Originally called into existence as the site
on which Wilson, Hart and Co.’s first sawmill was erected,
the workmen of which naturally clustered round the mill,
it was also the overland route to the famous pine scrubs at
Tincan Bay, and the road to the planlations on Upper
Tinana Creek, of Kircubbin, Charleville, Magnolia, and
Callart, where, in the early seventies, a large population
was constantly employed ; but now all is silent and the
mill plants are removed. In those days, during the early
seventies, Rawson was at Kircubbin, with Speaker Cowley
as manager, De Libert bossed Magnolia for General
Fielding, and Cameron was slaving hard forming Callart
into a plantation. Now the whole is either in the hands of
banks or mortgage companies.
A small watering-place has started at Boonooroo, 14
miles from Granville, on the shores of Sandy Straits, a sort
of miniature rival to Pialba as a seaside resort, having
little or no beach, but rejoicing in the possession of the
largest and fiercest mosquitoes and sandflies in Queensland.
But this must not be alluded to in the presence of a
Granville resident. It is the centre of the Granville
division, has a divisional hall and post-office, a large State
school, and church belonging to the Church of England.
The present Mayor of Maryborough is chairman of the
divisional board, with H. F. Parker as clerk and valuator.
On the same side of the river, but in the opposite
direction, connected with Maryborough by a long wooden
bridge, lies the suburb of Tinana, itself surrounded by a
closely-settled farming population, which in the days when
the sugar industry was at its height included the plantations
and mills of Eaton Vale, lindah, and Ferney on the Mary
River, and those of Alpha and Nerada on Tinana Creek.
It was one of the first agricultural settled districts in the
colony, the banks of the Mary being lined on both sides
with dense pine scrubs. Communication was entirely by
water; the logs were simply rolled into the water and
floated to the mills. Blacks were plentiful and daring,
robberies frequent, and their depredations were often quickly
revenged. Men toiled hard in those days in subduing the
wilderness, having no comforts, and often not the bare
necessaries of life, and even now on looking back they can
hardly be blamed if when visiting the town occasionally


their conduct was not quite so decorous as that which one
now finds at a social of the Y Union. A. Murray owned
lindah ; the Elwoods were on Tinana Creek, Pountney at
Yardley, O’Kelley at Ferney; Colquhoun and Hedges were
surveying. These, all cadets of good old houses at home,
brought capital into the district, but with the solitary
exception of O’Kelley they have succumbed like all pioneers ;
but Maryborough hummed whilst they were in town. The
Royal and the Melbourne hotels were lively places, and the
few old policemen about the place had their hands full.
Above the old police camp the late G. W. Bailey farmed a
large tract of good alluvial soil, and, being an educated
man, contributing regularly to the local Press, so ingratiated
himself in the good opinion of his fellow-settlers that when
the district became entitled to send a member to Parliament
he was singled out as one who knew their wants and
sympathised with their views, and was returned as their
member, which seat he held for many years, holding the
position of whip to the Liberal Party in the House. His
knowledge as a medical man, though not practising, was
most valuable to the early settlers, as he was ever ready to
attend the call of the sick and needy. At the junction of
Tinana Creek with the Mary was the residence of the first
Crown Lands Commissioner for the district, the late Mr.
Bidwell, a famous botanist whose garden has been the means
of introducing into the colony many tropical plants and
fruit-trees, which are now a source of wealth to the colony.
Tinana is a divisional board district, possessing a divi-
sional hall, church, post-office and State school. The
orangeries and fruit gardens of Messrs. Brennan and
Geraghty, G. A. White, M‘Gregor, and others will well
repay a visit, whilst on the Waterworks road Mr. John
Park’s place is worthy of inspection, as it is a perfect
experimental farm ; and about eight miles from town is
situated the now famous Maryborough Waterworks, on the
bank of Tinana Creek, its sylvan glades being a favourite
resort for picnic parties.
West of the Mary, and south of the Gayndah road, as
far as Myrtle Creek, lies the division of Antigua, a long
narrow strip of agricultural land on the bank of the Mary.
It in no place exceeds three miles in width, and the Mary-
borough and Gympie Railway runs right through it,


allowing the settlers easy communication with Maryborough,
through the stations of Antigua, Mungarr Junction, where
the line branches off towards Gayndah, Graham’s Creek
and Yengarie.
Yengarie may be called the business centre of the district,
as here are erected the famous sugar refinery works of
Cran and Co. In the early days the site of a large
boiling-down establishment belonging to Mr. (now the
Hon.) R. H. D. White, M.L.C., of New South Wales,
coming into the possession of Messrs. Tooth and Cran,
that enterprising firm erected meat extract works on the
Liebig system, which continued in operation until the
enhanced price of cattle drove the business to the south
American continent. Then arose the present refinery
works, which have been continually added to until they now
occupy several acres of ground. Mr. Robert Tooth retired
from the firm some years ago, and the business is now
managed by Messrs. Robert and A. Cran, sons of Mr.
Tooth’s partner, the late Robert Cran, to whose energy,
perseverance, and indomitable courage the sugar industry
both here and at Bundaberg owes all its success.
Formerly large sawmills were in existence at Mungarr,
having been erected by the late Mr. Percy Ramsay, and
were worked in conjunction with Ins Maryborough mill.
The machinery has since been purchased by Messrs. Hyne
and Son, and removed to extend the Maryborough works. v .
Several mills existed in this portion of the district in
the sugar days—Alford, belonging to Mr. Peter Richardson,
the Central to Mr. G. W. Gibson, Loudon, to Mr. James
Cran, and Antigua to Messrs. H. and A. Brown. All
these mills, with the exception of Loudon, are now silent.
Antigua, which is attached to a large plantation, will
doubtless be at work again shortly. Mr. Jas. Cran, of
Loudon, is chairman of the divisional board, which meets
at Yengarie at the divisional hall, a substantial brick
edifice, Mr. A. Hall, acting as clerk and valuer. There are
two large State schools in the division, one at Yengarie and
one at Mungarr.
Continuing southward along both banks of the Mary
River, a thickly and long settled district is passed through,
chiefly devoted to farming and grazing. About 16 miles
from Maryborough by road, and 22 miles by railway, lies


the village of Tiaro, on the east bank of the river. Started
into existence as a camping place and change for the
coaches in the early days of Gympie, it soon became the
nucleus of a small business site, and being at the same
time at the head of tidal waters it was also a centre for the
lumberers of the district, who rafted timber from here to
Maryborough. The Gympie Railway, having crossed the
river at Antigua, continues up the east bank right through
the division. Sawmills existed at Tiaro and Gundiah, but
are both now idle. Large quantities of maize, hay, and
potatoes, are raised in the district, and find a market at
Maryborough and Gympie. Steps have been already taken
under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act to bring the rich
scrub lands of Mount Bauple under cane cultivation. This
movement, which promises to be highly successful, owes
everything to the energy and foresight of Captain M‘Kellar,
who shows his confidence in the undertaking by sinking a
large amount of capital in the preparations he is now
making to put his estate under cane. Tiaro has long been
famous for the excellence of its cheese, several private
makers having for many years a name for their several
brands, foremost amongst whom are Messrs. Cornwall,.
Wade, Dowzer, long residents in the district. A large
cheese factory has been for some time in full work at
Tiaro, and the district has certainly benefited considerably
through the teaching inculcated by the travelling dairy, in
the improvement made in both the cheese and butter of the
district, and the colony should always gratefully remember
the late Minister for Lands, the Hon. Hume Black, at
whose instigation this travelling and much-needed instruc-
tion was first started.
Tiaro has been very fortunate in having the late Mr.
Bailey, the Whip of the Liberal party, their member for so
long a period, for, through his exertions, the village
possesses a most substantial court-house, post and tele-
graph offices, where Petty Sessions are held frequently,
having an acting C.P.S. Mr. Cadell has long held sway
over the Post and Telegraph Department. It has also a
large public school, with an efficient staff; but what the
Tiaroites are most proud of are the number of religious
establishments which grace the various knolls in the town-
ship. There is scarcely a sect that has not a place of


worship, which, with the exception of the Presbyterians,
are nearly always closed through the want of clergymen,
as the residents are not over liberal in contributing to the
stipends required before a clergyman can live. There are
thiee good hotels and several excellent stores, those of
Messrs. J. Job and M‘Kewan being the most extensive.
The pastoral properties in the district largely supply
the Maryborough market with beef. Gigoomgan has
long been famous for its herd of well-bred Shorthorns,
and is owned and managed by George Mant, one of the
oldest settlers in the district. Glenbar belongs to R. W.
Scougall, and Niva to John Atherton.
The Burrum Division, which adjoins and partly sur-
ronnds Maryborough, has an area of 1,500 square miles, a
population of about 2,600, 780 dwellings, and 1,006 rate-
payers. The total capital value of the division is set down
at £184,528, of which freeholds are placed at £148,094 ;
selections and homesteads, £12,826; lands leased for
pastoral purposes, £13,924; land held under mining
tenure, £14,684. The annual revenue is as follows :
General rates, £1,158 65.; special, £77 18s. sd. ; total,
£1,281 4s. 5d., to which must be added the Government
endowment of £3Bl 9s. sd. The Government endowment
has decreased from £2,098 on the rates of 1889 to £1,027
on the rates of 1891 ; to £7OB on the rates of 1892, to £3Bl
on rates in 1898, having been reduced from £2 endowment
on every £1 of rates raised ; then £1 endowment reduced
again to 13s. 4d. in the £, and now it has reached down to
7s. This is a strong contrast to the liberality of the
Victorian endowment, which still amounts to nearly a
quarter of a million, and to the very liberal votes for roads
and bridges in New South Wales. The board consists of
six members, and meets once a month in Maryborough, as
being central. The board has been in existence since the
beginning of 1880 ; chairman, 1880, Henry Palmer ; 1881,
William Menzies; 1882, William Sly; 1883, Harry E.
Aldridge; 1884, D. P. White and J. Cunningham ; 1885,
Joseph Cleary ; 1886, Harry E. Aldridge and N. E. N.
Tooth; 1887, 1888, 1889, N. E. N. Tooth; 1890, 1891,
1892, 1893, 1894, E. B. C. Corser. The division includes
the agricultural district of Urangan and the marine resort
of Pialba, the agricultural district of Degilbo, and the


mining hamlets of Mount Shamrock, Biggenden, and
Paradise.
Pialba and Urangan are situated on the south-east
portion of the division, about 20 miles from Maryborough.
The farming portion has been settled over 17 years, the
scrub having been previously held by timber-getters, and
was the chief supply of timber for the Maryborough
sawmills in the early days. The farmers chiefly consist of
sturdy Danes, who, with great perseverance, have turned
the thick scrub into cultivated farms, but are still heavily
handicapped by having 20 miles of land carriage to get to
a market. Large quantities of bananas, oranges, and
other tropical fruits are now produced. Maryborough is
also largely supplied with butter from this district, and now
that the Central sugar mill is established in Maryborough
it only requires the extension of the railway from Colton
Junction to Pialba, a distance of 16 miles, for the cultiva-
tion of sugar to be a success. The marine summer resort
of Pialba is much frequented by Maryborough inhabitants,
and those of the surrounding districts ; it is also a favourable
resort of Gympie inhabitants. The beach, which extends
from the town of Poison to Dayman’s Point, Urangan, a
distance of 7 miles, is unsurpassed in Australia. There are
about 80 marine residences, which are fully occupied during
the summer season ; also three large and w T ell-appointed
hotels, telegraph station, and post offices at Poison and
Torquay, several comfortable boarding-houses ; and the
necessaries of life are plentiful and cheap, several stores
catering to the wants of visitors, whilst the farmers find
from them a ready market for their produce, fruit, and
vegetables. The parishes of Dunmora and Gungaloon,
west of Maryborough, are under grass, the owners being
employed in supplying the sawmills in town with hardwood
timber, some of them coming a distance of over 25 miles
with their bullock teams, and successfully competing with
the railw r ay line.
To to west of Yengarie are the large sugar plantations of
Illawarra and Yerra-Yerra, the properties of Messrs. R.
Cran and Co., for very many years under the able manage-
ment of their old and trusty employee, Mr. M. L. Lewis.
These plantations supply the Yengarie Refinery with juice.
There is still a large quantity of undeveloped scrub lands


lying to the south of these plantations on to the banks of
Myrtle Creek. These are in the hands of the Queensland
Mortgage Company and South Australian Land Mortgage
Company, and, being intersected by the branch railway line
to Gayndah, ought to be shortly brought under cultivation,
as communication with the Maryborough Central Sugar
Mill is now available by railway.
We now come to the lately and much-talked of settle-
ments on Degilbo, Mungarr, and Woowoonga creeks, being
on the resumed half of the once-famous Degilbo run, so
long originally held by the late Hon. William Henry Walsh,
M.L.C. The run is at present held by Messrs. Kent and
Wienholt, and is used as a breeding station to raise stores, to
be fattened eventually on the famous pastures of Jondaryan
and Tarampa. The station is under the management of
Mr. Fassifern Kent. To show the liberal spirit in which
these lessees are prepared to meet the advancing demand
for agricultural settlement they have consented that a
portion of their leased half of the run may be resumed in
return for some ridgy and stony country in the resumed
half. There are now over 22,000 acres selected on this run,
the selectors numbering fully 140, and the holdings average
about 160 acres each. Three Provisional schools have
already been established ; and a good deal of energy has
been shown in a very short time, more particularly by
Messrs. Baxter, Roliinson, Cleary, Reilly, and O’Doherty,
who have demonstrated that the district is fully capable of
growing anything, provided the seasons are favourable.
Certainly the last four seasons have been more than un-
usually favourable for rainfall. The lessees of the run on
the leased half have much improved their holding by
fencing and ring-barking, and from the improvement already
resulting in the pastures there is little doubt that the day
is not far distant when sheep will again replace cattle in the
Burnett district. The old coarse seed} grass is fast dis-
appearing and giving place to the old herbs and grasses.
The district is accommodated with two railway stations,
viz., Biggenden, 54 miles from Maryborough, and Woo-
woonga, the present terminus of the line, miles from
town, also a stopping place at the Lakes, about 47 miles
from Maryborough ; post offices at Biggenden and
Woowoonga; telegraph station at Woowoonga; police
station and Court of Petty Sesssons monthly at Biggenden.


About miles from Biggenden Railway Station is
situated the famous bismuth mine, which possesses one of
the completest mining plants in the colony. It was for a
long time under the able management of Mr. B. Roberts,
who resigned to take a lucrative mining appointment in the
Malay Peninsula. When in full work fully thirty hands or
more are employed, and there is the nucleus of a small
mining hamlet round the mine. The educational require-
ments of the rising generation are supplied with another
Provisional school. From the present terminus of the
line at Woowoonga a coach three times a week takes mails
and passengers to the very old and once famous township
of Gayndah, returning on the alternate days, the journey
from Maryborough to Gayndah being accomplished in one
day. About six miles beyond Woowoonga and four miles
beyond Degilbo head station, after passing through a belt
of basaltic country, the traveller turns off towards the north,
and within a mile comes to the famous Mount Shamrock
mine, discovered by Messrs. Woodyatt, Simpson, and
J. Roberts. This mine has for some months been unre-
munerative, only dead work going on at present. It
possesses a good crushing plant and a complete chlorination
works. About eight miles in a north-westerly direction is
the mining goldfield of Paradise, now opened about five
years. The population numbers 700, of which nearly 400
are settled in the township on the banks of the Burnett.
There are four hotels, a large assembly hall, good court-
house, and Gold Warden’s office, where Mr. J. Linedale,
J.P., C.P.S., Acting Warden and Mining Registrar, reigns
supreme. Petty Sessions are held weekly. There is also a
large Provisional school with an average attendance of
over 140. The main lines of reef are the St. Mungo,
Berrie Paterson, the Nil Desperandum, and Lady Margaret.
Several of these have given good returns on the surface,
more particularly the Lady Margaret, Berrie Paterson, and
the St. Mungo. There are three crushing plants on the
field. The largest and most complete being supplied with
Frue Vanner tables, belongs to a Maryborough company,
who also possess leases on the St. Mungo and Lady Mar-
garet lines of reef. The second battery originally belonged
to a Melbourne company, who were always, unfortunately,
under a cloud financially, being continually unable to pay


their workmen. It is now leased by the present owners to
Mr. Basset, late of Eidsvold, who is now crushing for the
public at a reduced rate. The other is a small Chilian mill
plant, now owned by Mr. Berrie, but it requires extensive
repairs. A good deal of work has been done on this field
during the last five years, but much of it to no purpose.
The reefs have been as yet tried to no great depth; indeed,
neither the water-line nor the black slate has been touched,
and, though the outside public have not been at all chary
in investing on the field, they have not in many instances
received fair treatment, nor have their investments gone as
far as they should have done in the opening up the field.
The yield of gold has been steadily increasing for the last
three quarters, and the field, if proved to a depth, will
doubtless turn out better than heretofore. Further up the
river is another slate formation, the now deserted goldfield
of Gebangle, where gold seems to be distributed everywhere.
This field is just within the Rawbelle division.
About half way between Mount Shamrock and Mount
Gebangle is the once famous Lady Florence Reef, near the
banks of Chowey Creek, on which several thousands of
pounds have been squandered through gross mismanage-
ment. A good plant was erected, but the whole affair was
burst up before any crushing could be obtained to show if
the mine was payable.
Three miles beyond the western boundary of the Burrum
division lies the Venus and Mount Steadman line of reef.
Several rich patches were crushed in Gympie from the
Venus, which resulted in the mine being purchased by some
Gympie capitalists, who have erected a good battery.
There is also a small battery of four-head attached to the
Mount Steadman Claim. There is a good hotel, post
office, and Provisional school on the field, the population
of which may be put down at from 150 to 200.


THE BURNETT PASTORAL DISTRICT.
Gayndah.
On entering Wetheron Eun, the traveller is well in the
Burnett pastoral district, with the exception of several
small agricultural settlements around the small towns of
Gayndah, Nanango, and the mining town of Eidsvold,
entirely devoted to cattle-raising. The district is one of
the oldest settled in the colony, being at the time of
separation the centre of a large and thriving population,
and at that time entirely given over to sheep farming.
Since then the district, as a pastoral one, has gone back-
wards. Gayndah, the capital of the district, was 85 years
ago a very prosperous and thriving town, for in those days
breeding ewes were selling freely at over a guinea a head,
to stock northern country ; but no attention was paid
towards infusing fresh blood into their flocks, and what
with in-breeding and overstocking sheep fast deteriorated
and have now vanished from the district. In those
prosperous days Gayndah was considered by Burnett men,,
at least, as the Hub of Queensland. The Powers and
Conollys were the autocrats of Gayndah ; their will was law.
Horse-racing was carried on on lines little inferior to Eand-
wick or Flemington, and life ran pretty high when squatters
visited the local capital. But, alas! those days have
vanished, and Gayndah is now a veritable sleepy hollow,
nestling on the banks of the Burnett. A prettier site for
a town does not exist in Australia. It possesses a muni-
cipality large in size, but very small in revenue; indeed, it
may be designated a free grazing run for its 200
inhabitants. It still rejoices in a turf club, a district
hospital, school of arts, post and telegraph offices. It
is surrounded with good agricultural land, and if the
inhabitants would throw off some of the lethargy that for
a long time has seemed inherent in them, and bring the
capabilities of their district prominently under the notice
of the outside public, both population and capital would
soon appear amongst them. The resumed halves of the
runs are all open for selection as grazing farms, but do not
seem to have been taken up to any large extent. If these
areas were ringbarked and water conserved, the carrying
capabilities of the country would be greatly increased, and


the I day would not be far distant when wool would be again
in the ascendant and prosperity brought back to the district.
In the north-east of the district is situated the once
celebrated Mount Perry Copper Mine, now lying dormant
through the low price of copper, the town being the
terminus of the railway from Bundaberg.
In the north-west are scattered several small mining
communities getting more or less gold, but heavily handi-
capped for the want of machinery and capital; in fact, this
portion of the district is a perfect net-work of minerals
which only requires developing.
Eidsvold.
About half way between Mount Perry and the portion of
the district just spoken of lies the mining town of Eidsvold,
about 58 miles north-west of Gayndah. The field is
entirely a reefing one, and possesses several mining plants,
is the centre of a divisional board district, has gold warden
and police magistrate, mining registrar, hospital, State
school, post and telegraph offices. The town has a
population of about 800, the district about 4000. A small
agricultural population is gradually getting settled in the
neighbourhood, and finds no difficulty in supplying the
wants of the town with farm produce, and adding another
instance of the capabilities of the soil to successfully pro-
duce something more than cattle, and refuting the often-
times reiterated pronouncements of the pastoral tenants
that the district will never be anything else than a pastoral
one.
At the extreme southern edge of the district lies the
small hamlet of Nanango, known in prehistoric times as
the “ Burnett Inn,” where Host Bright presided. It is now
surrounded by a farming population, the German element
preponderating, and it is also the centre of a large grazing
district, and, being on the high road to the now famous
cattle saleyards at Esk, is a far more lively place than the
appearance of the village would otherwise warrant. The
roads here diverge to Toowoomba, Dalby, Gayndah, Kil-
kivan, and also down the valley of the Stanley to Brisbane
and Ipswich, via Esk. It possesses a land office, court of
petty sessions, divisional board’s district, Mr. A. Lee
acting as P.M., Land Officer, and C.P.S.


This closes a fair but by no means exhaustive
description of one of the most important districts in Queens-
land, rich in many capabilities, many of which are at
present dormant for want of enterprise and capital.
Perhaps there is no district for its size so rich in the number
of its minerals, gold, silver, coal, lead, copper, bismuth,
antimony, quicksilver, and several others. It has a climate
bracing and genial, and possesses on the coast a tropical
luxuriance able to grow sugar, coffee, and other like pro-
ductions, whilst inland all descriptions of farm produce can
be successfully raised if proper attention and care are given
to their production. The higher portions of the district
are admirably adapted for the vine and olive, and its
pastoral capabilities have been so long and favourably
known that it is needless to dwell upon them further than
to say that with the expenditure of energy and capital the
number of stock could be easily trebled, and both Glad-
stone and Maryborough would soon become the sites of
large freezing and preserving works.
The climate is healthy, and Maryborough is perhaps as
favourable to invalids as any part of Queensland. Occa-
sionally during the summer months the thermometer rises
to 95deg. but seldom exceeds lOOdeg. During the terrible
weather “ down south ” in January, 1896, when a most
disastrous “heat wave” swept over the adjacent colonies,
Maryborough was singularly free from the terrible scourge,
and sunstrokes were few, whilst elsewhere the mortality
reached from 80 to 50 per day. Even when 120deg. in
the shade was recorded in Sydney, our record was from
85deg. to 90deg., and at Pialba about 6deg. lower.
Maryborough Railway Station is a fine open structure
of considerable extent. Opened August, 1881, by Messrs.
E. Daly, then station master, Mr. Geo. Ross, present
station master, and another who came from Brisbane for the
purpose. The traffic then comprised but one train per day
from Maryborough to Gympie, and there were but 61 miles
of railway, two engines and four carriages ; now there are
800 vehicles, and all the rolling stock, excepting engines, has
been locally manufactured. It is a common sight to see
the whole station full of moving traffic, and presenting


quite as bustling appearance as that of Brisbane, and often
800 vehicles loaded with coal and provisions leave for
distant parts. Owing to the heavy traffic the line from
Maryborough to Croydon Junction is to be duplicated.
The passenger traffic is reported equal to any line in the
colonies, and excursion fares a boon to the public. The
hands employed on the railway are over 100, and it is
proposed to increase the rolling stock to meet the demand.
About 50 trains arrive and leave daily. Employees at
workshops 120, and there is a Railway Servants’ Benefit
Society of which Mr. Woolcott is secretary, and of which
he reports large membership.
H.M. CUSTOMS.
The trade and commerce of Maryborough and the sur-
rounding districts for many years was confined to Sydney,
but with the separation of the colony in 1859, Maryborough
was declared a port of entry, and a sub-collector (Mr. R. B.
Sheridan) appointed. The trade, however, was at first but
small, and the whole business then was done single-handed
by Mr. Sheridan, in the “ Custom House,” as it was
termed, but which is now the kitchen of the Melbourne
Hotel. In 1861, the present Custom House, a fine roomy
building, was erected, and afforded ample space for bonding
of dutiable goods and for the transaction of other business.
The introduction of ad valorem duties soon compelled the
Government to provide increased accommodation, and the
Immigration Barracks were at first used, and later on a
bonded store near the wharf.
Ships trading to Brisbane have inferior facilities for
getting to their wharves ; they pay nine times more by way
of port dues than prevail in Sydney; in the matter of
Customs overtime, often necessitated by the shortcomings
of the river, they are heavily mulcted in performing work
which ought clearly to be undertaken by the State ; and
when the goods are placed on the wharf, the consignee is
called upon to dole out 25., and under certain conditions 3s.
per ton, which the shipowner has also to collect for the
Customs without fee or reward, and which is a charge over
and above what is levied in any of the Australian colonies.
A ship of 1000 tons, with £7BO freight, has to pay in
Brisbane £l9l, and the same ship in Sydney only £75.


Towage is charged from Cape Moreton to Brisbane Is. 6d.
per ton, while from Sydney to Newcastle it is only 4d.
It is fitting in this that mention should be made of the
numerous works which have been undertaken in bridge
building, and punt traffic over the Mary River.
Punts ply daily on the river at Granville Ferry, T. Madsen,
lessee. The Primus Ferry which Mr. T. Christmas so ably
managed is now relegated to the past.
The following is a letter dealing with the important
question of flood protection in the Mary River, which the
Maryborough Bridge Board addressed to the various local
authorities and other bodies interested in the matter :
“ Maryborough Bridge Board,
“ July 15th, 1896.
“ His Worship the Mayor, Municipality of Gympie.
“ Sir, —With a view if possible of minimising the risk of
future destruction to bridges generally throughout our
district, through flood, etc., I have been directed to suggest
for the consideration of your Council (having authority over
bridges at Gympie), that some joint action be taken by the
various bodies between Maryborough and Gympie, inclusive,
for the periodical clearing away of all accumulation of
debris along the Mary River. Past experiences have proved
sufficiently that the great quantities of debris which are now
allowed from time to time to accumulate along our banks,
only remain to eventually be gathered in higher masses
against the bridges, thereby blocking the flow of water, and
causing the greatest strain to our structures, which would
be considerably lessened if precautions were taken in the
manner suggested; namely, by the periodical clearing away
from the banks and low-lying portions of our river of all
large accumulations of debris previous to the wet season
setting in. The cost involved in this undertaking might be
satisfactorily apportioned between the different bodies, and
it is not anticipated that this would be an expensive item.
A similar letter to this has been addressed to the Tiaro
Divisional Board, Railway Commissioners, and the Mary-
borough Harbour Board. My Board respectfully submit
that the question is worthy of some consideration, and
would be glad to have your Council’s views on the matter
at your earliest convenience.—Yours, etc.,
“ Alf, Hall, Clerk to the Board.”

Produce Removed Coastwise.
The following produce of the Wide Bay district was
removed coastwise from the port of Maryborough for the
year ended 81st December, 1895 :
A meeting of the Maryborough Harbour Board of Assist-
ance and Advice was held in January, 1896. Present—
Messrs. R. Han (Chairman), H. M. Ramsay, J. Bar-
tholomew, and J. F. Ward. Correspondence—From the
Harbour Department, forwarding plans for the conversion
of a 200 hopper barge into a suction dredge at a cost of
£IOBO, and stating that the Portmaster had had no
experience as regards the removal of gravel by suction
dredges, but judging by the work performed by the 8-inch
suction dredge recently manufactured, he was of opinion
that a 12-inch dredge would remove any gravel met with in
the channels of the Mary River.—The secretary was
instructed to ascertain from the Portmaster when the
dredge Maryborough was likely to complete her work at
Bundaberg, and whether it was his intention to carry out
his promise to put the Maryborough on the slip in Brisbane
for an overhaul before her commencement of work in the
Mary River. It is the intention of the Board to start


dredging No. 8 and 6 cuttings in the river early in April, or
immediately after the wet season. These two cuttings are
the only obstacles to navigation in the Mary at present,
and it is presumed that Sandy Flats, being a national
highway, will be attended to by the Government.
THE HOSPITAL
Prior to 1854 there was no hospital in Maryborough and
the sick were treated as best they could be by the few
medical practitioners located here, or with “ household
remedies” which were at that rough period often injudi-
ciously administered. Fever and ague prevailed in the
Burnett and Wide Bay districts, for which quinine was the
recognised specific ; occasionally Holloway’s pills, castor
oil, and patent nostrums were recommended and obtained
at station stores, or at Melville and Travis’s establishment.
In 1856 a slab hut was rented from Mr. Doran for hospital
purposes. Though historic records respecting this subject
are somewhat obscure, yet it is asserted that Mr. Arthur
Halloran was the first president, with Mr. Geo. Howard
as vice-president; the latter held office till 1861, when he
was succeeded by Mr. R. B. Sheridan. Shortly after this
the hospital was removed to a house of Mrs. M‘Adams’
in Ferry street, where it remained until the erection of the
present building, of which the late Mr. W. H. Walsh was
president. He continued to hold that office till 1872, when
the Hon. A. H. Palmer took his place. He was succeeded
by the late Mr. Sim in 1873, and by Mr. Henry Palmer in
1874 and 1875.
The Hospital is a large and commodious structure, more
noted for its excellent accommodation and management
than architectural beauty. It stands in its own grounds,
on the west side of Lennox street, with well laid-out
gardens kept with taste and care. On the north side is the
house of the resident surgeon, and at the rear of the main
building a Polynesian ward was built in 1870. The number
of beds is about 70, and the staff, both medical and nursing, is
very efficient. Dr. Palmer, who was the first surgeon, was
duly succeeded by Drs. Ward, Brown, Power, Lane, and


Little, the last from Melbourne in 1874 as resident surgeon.
Dr. H. C. Garde is the present resident surgeon, and he also
commands a large private practice. The president is Mr.
W. J. M‘Grath; vice-president, Mr. Jno. Graham. During
1896 the community sustained a serious loss in the sudden
death of Dr. Harricks, who has been so many years con-
nected with medical practice here. In 1874 the original
design of the architect of the building was completed by the
erection of the southern wing, which gives an increased
accommodation on the ground and upper floor to 29 feet by
16 feet. The foundation stone of the present Hospital was
laid in 1864. As may be expected, in the early days there
were many very bad and complicated cases of disease and
suffering in the Wide Bay Hospital, and among them those
of victims stricken down by aboriginals, who succumbed to
untimely fate.
From the time the New Township was proclaimed in 1851
and allotments of land sold, Maryborough began to advance,
and, aided by immigration and influx of pioneers from the
“ Old Township,” population grew and streets, so-called,
were named by the surveyors or owners of the allotments.
Nor was it an impossible thing for the venturesome “new
chum ” into the bush to get astray in the jungle on the
banks of the Mary, and to escape with perhaps no worse
mishap than camping out all night minus tea and damper,
reaching the township footsore and weary, piloted perhaps
by some good-natured aboriginal, whose reward would
invariably be tobacco, or “win’ feller tixpence.” In its
first stages Maryborough trade depended greatly on the
money put in circulation by careless bushmen, teamsters,
timbergetters, shearers and shepherds with “ big cheques”
who come to town to spend their hard earnings with a
prodigality never since equalled. These, and the purchase
of station stores by the squatters, the maritime trade
between Sydney and our port, were the first foundation
of business, which was generally conducted on the
haphazard principle of payment, with long credit, whilst
at Gayndah from 1855 and for ten years after LO.U.’s
were the common currency. The way was thus opened
for great losses and insolvencies. It took several years
of prosperity, and the golden era inaugurated by

Gympie to restore confidence and bring things to a more
satisfactory level and status of progressiveness. Of all
the residents in the “ Old Township ” in 1850 few remain,
but I learn that the following still reside in Maryborough :
Messrs. John Harwood, Henry Palmer, Mrs. Blue (last
of the Gregory family), Elizabeth Smith, J. Cleary, J.
Purser and Jas. Dowzer, remain to tell the tale of pioneer
hardships and adventures. Mr. McAdams, one of the
most energetic and zealous of police officers, is calmly
sleeping in the cemetery. Mr. G. J. Watson, who took
charge of the first sheep for Mr. R. Jones, of Baramba;
Uhr, of boiling-down fame ; Rev. E. Tanner, the first
Church of England minister, are all gone, whilst Mr. E, T.
Aldridge has gone to join the wife he loved so well, and
whose memory he so long lamented, and synonymous with
his, the name of John Bales is re-called, whilst his per-
sistent action in holding on to country he had faith in,
despite the outrages, pillage, and massacres by the natives
on his stations, are themes for commendation. Many a
time have I listened at the camp fires of bullock-drivers to
these wild tales of bloodshed and escapes from slaughter,
till I felt horror-struck and instinctively clutched my
firearms fearing a foe in every bush and danger lurking
’neath the shade. Ah me ! how sad it is to remember the
unnumbered dead who fell before aboriginal spears and
tomahawks, for whom neither prayer was said nor tear
shed, and who yet lie in uncoffined, unknown graves ! If
we add to these, that great army of mortals, who fell and
died of delirium tremens , “ horrors,” and the evils of liquor
poisoning, what a fearful array of mortality is here dis-
played. Rum was the popular liquor, and the fiercer its
strength the better it was liked ; O.P. drink well adulterated
was in request, and vile compounds retailed at all hotels.
During the early sixties there were few, if any, teetotalers
in the town or district, and it was not till 1869 that any
attempt was made to check the tide of intemperance or
form societies, whose moral influence might act as a
judicious counterblast to so much evil. On the 18th May,
1870, a public meeting was held at the Oddfellows’ Hall to in-
augurate a total abstinence society, and though only thirteen
members were enrolled, it has still kept on increasing,
and in less than a year after, it had 126 members on the


roll, and £llB to its credit in the bank. This was intended
as the nucleus of a fund to build a temperance hall, which
was erected in the second year, and held about 600 persons.
It is the good fortune of the author to rescue from oblivion
the memory of Mr. T. G. Watson, of Pialba, who with
commendable zeal in a good cause, donated £l5O towards
defraying expenses of the temperance hall, an example
soon followed by other citizens, who gave liberally in cash
and goods for the same object. The building, which cost
about £6OO, was opened January 26th, 1872, with space
left in front for erection of a library and reading-room,
both to be free. The total abstinence society originators
were : —President, Mr. J. Pyne; vice-presidents, Messrs.
T. P. Peat and D. M. Crowley ; secretary and hallkeeper,
Mr. E. Whitehead; treasurer, Mr. W. Foster; committee,
Messrs. J. C. Halliday, G. Jones, U. Dudley, and H.
Smith ; trustees, Messrs. T. T. Woodrow, W. A. Holme,
J. Wear in.
NEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE.
I am indebted to the late Mr. W. S. Lambert, of Mary-
borough, printer, for the following particulars of the Fourth
Estate.
Press. — Maryborough Chronicle , C. H. Buzacott, tri-
weekly, established Nov. 21, 1860. Wide Bay and Burnett
Times , tri-weekly, W. Keith, established July 2, 1870.
Wide Bay Times , T. White, established March 6, 1860,
closed in 1861. Tribune, Lambert, established 1865.
Burnett Argus, T. White. Mount Perry Mail, T. White;
The Newspaper Press of Maryborough takes an exalted
stand in the walks of journalism, and from its outspoken-
ness and ability, is regarded as an authority on local events,
political matters, and questions affecting the well-being of
the city and district. It is undoubtedly due to the per-
sistent advocacy of the Wide Bay Neics, backed by the
energies and perseverance of Mr. Corser, Mr. Chas. Power,
and Mr. John Bartholomew, M.L.A., that the Pialba
Railway line was established, and the Gayndah extension,
now an oft treated subject, must ere long become a positive
fact.


The W'ide Bay District has long been the most energetic
journalistic sphere in Queensland and its papers, started at
various times, conducted by men of undoubted ability,
fearless and honest opinions, are well worthy a lasting
record in this volume.
The following remarks from the pen of the late Mr. W.
S. Lambert, a well-known practical printer, are appropriate.
Mr. Lambert, who was a native of England, arrived in
Maryborough in the early sixties, and as showing what
energy and perseverence combined were capable of, hear
this:—
WIDE BAY NEWS OFFICE.
The Wide Bay and Burnett News
was established by Ebenezer Thorne, who purchased the
plant of the Maryborough Mail from White and changed its
name and status to one of a higher grade than it had
previously occupied. The News has for many years been a
popular paper and full of original and interesting matter,
largely contributed, both locally and from a distance. Carl
Feilberg, a writer of some note, was its first editor and
afterwards proprietor by purchase from Thorne. Mr. Wm.


Keith next joined Feilberg as partner, and ultimately Mr.
Keith became sole proprietor of the News and holds that
position at present. He is ably assisted by his brother,
Mr. D. J. Keith and Mr. A. Blue, and the office is favour-
ably known for the first-class work executed, as well as the
enterprise and ability displayed in its management, and the
excellence of the literary matter. Supplements containing
bales, poetry, fiction, &c., usually form an attraction for
the public, and as these are issued on Saturdays many a
leisure hour in the bush is beguiled of weariness on the
Sunday, and many a farmer’s home is made happy by light
reading. As in most country newspapers of the present
day there is a very liberal and cheap scale for advertise-
ments.
Maryborough Chronicle ,
Established by Charles Hardie Buzacott in 1858. It may
thus be regarded as the pioneer of journalism of Wide
Bay. Under Mr. Buzacott’s management, the paper, from
its liberal views and excellent character, enjoyed great
popularity, and was well supported by all classes. Among
the early compositors on this paper were Wm. Keith,
present proprietor Wide Bay News ; Jno. Keith Macintyre,
now of Daily Telegraph , Melborne ; Charles Hobbs, now
at Government Printing Office, Adelaide, S.A. ; David
Gardner, now secretary School of Arts, Maryborough ;
Roberts, and many others who have joined the “ great
majority,” or are fixing type in other lands. Some of the
-early “ grass hands” are now full blown newspaper men
with a large staff of gentlemen “ comps.” to work the new
tangled type-setting machines. G. E. Loyau, author of
•this work, was a contributor to the Chronicle in 1860-61,
his writings being appreciated by Mr. Buzacott, the com-
posing staff, and general readers. Mr. Buzacott resigned
proprietorship of the Chronicle to Mr. W. S. Roberts, and
left Maryborough for Brisbane, where he is well known and
♦eminently respected as a leading member of the Queensland
Legislature and other institutions.
The Colonist ,
A weekly summary of events, enjoys a leading position,
and is greatly appreciated by readers in the bush for its
tales, sketches, and entertaining literature.


Burnett Argus.
Established at Gayndah, Burnett District, about 1857 by
Mr. Thomas White, an energetic but somewhat vacillating
individual, hailing from Sydney, where he was associated
in early life with several theatrical troupes. Though
possessed of but small literary ability lie had great tact,
energy, and smartness which served him in good stead.
The Argus was edited by fully a score of versatile journalists
and novices in literature. Dr. Thomas, Dr. Stevenson,.
Duncan McNee, a local teacher, and George E. Loyau were
its editors, and supplied a variety hash of passing events
and comicalities to suit the times and tastes of the com-
munity. Ghostly paragraphs kept things likely, and the
“ Ghost of Ban Ban” (W. H. Walsh) and “Ghost of
Gayndah” (G.E.L.) rung the changes week by week. In
1861 when drays failed to arrive with the necessary supplies
of paper, Connolly’s store was the store-house whence brown
paper, tissue and tea paper was purchased to print the
paper on and keep faith with the public. This incident is
sufficient to show the difficulties and disadvantages which
beset the early printers. “ Tom ” White (as he was
familiarly called) led a very precarious existence in Gayndah.
A too overweening love for the “ social glass ” and good
fellowship brought him to grief, whilst many to whom he
had lent hard cash oft ignored their indebtedness. LO.U.’s
were the “current coin” all over the Burnett and even
Wide Bay districts, and as in some instances these were
forged, serious losses occurred to those accepting them as
genuine. Tom was often paid a year’s subscription or
quarter’s advertising in worthless LO.U.’s, so that in May,
1870, actuated with a desire for change, and encouraged by
well-meaning friends, he shifted quarters to Maryborough
where, as before stated, he brought his plant from Gayndah
and brought out a 4-page demy broadsheet entitled the
Maryborough Mail. The erratic ways of Tom White did
not increase his popularity in Maryborough, and after a
brief and somewhat inglorious career he left for Mount
Perry and started the Mail there in the copper interests.
At first prosperity seemed imminent and Fortune favoured
the struggling journalist who, warned by previous losses
elsewhere, did not wait till bad times came but “ cleared ”
for Bundaberg, where he established the Mail , which is still


in good repute and enjoys large local and district patronage
under the present proprietorship—Messrs. Barriskill and
Eadie. Compositors and staff of Burnett Argus , Gayndah,
in 1869 :—Thos. White, proprietor ; Geo. E. Loyau, editor
and reporter ; compositors : Chas. S. Hobbs, D. Gardner,.
Kramer, J. K. Macintyre.
The Tribune ,
Up to May, 1870, the Maryborough Chronicle was the
only paper published here. Mr. W. S. Lambert was
induced, from promised support, to attempt a second paper,,
and with a new plant from Sydney, brought out a small
sheet of four pages demy folio, entitled The Tribune. He
was not long, however, allowed to enjoy his position, for
Mr. Tom White, proprietor of the Burnett Argus, Gayndah,
shifted his plant to Maryborough. Mr. Lambert had his
plant on the wharf (it being important to bring his paper
out before White) put on “ steam,” and though the plant
only arrived on the Thursday, brought out his first number
on the Saturday, an effort which, perhaps, only printers
can truly appreciate the speed required in the execution.
White’s paper, a four-page demy, came out soon after as
the Maryborough Mail. From various reasons, the paper
soon stopped. The Tribune was then immediately increased
to six pages, and did fairly well. It had some good con-
tributors, M. Hill and O’Kelly, of Tiaro, Pountney (now
secretary of the Brisbane Turf Club), Ebenezer Thorne, and
many others. Unfortunately, however, through lack of
support, it also fell through. Tom White afterwards-
started in Mount Perry (the copper mines were then in full
swing), and the Mount Perry Mail came into existence, and
while the copper boom was on, he and others did well.
When that metal waned he did not wait for another
collapse, but shifted his small plant to Bundaberg, and
brought out the Bundaberg Mail, which paper is still to
the fore, and enjoys a good circulation. The plant of the
Maryborough Mail was bought by Ebenezer Thorne, who
started the Wide Bay and Burnett News, which still
enjoys popularity in Maryborough. Thorne’s interest was
afterwards secured by Mr. Carl Feilberg, a writer of some
repute, who took Mr. W. Keith into partnership. Feilberg
afterwards disposed of his share to Mr. Keith, who now


carries on that journal, now a tri-weekly, with success.
The Chronicle , too, from being a weekly at the time of the
discovery of Gympie, became a bi-weekly, then tri-weekly,
and now is an important daily.
Tom White died at Bundaberg in 1890, leaving a wife
and child.
The death of William Samuel Lambert, printer, of
Wharf street, Maryborough, on September 9th, 1896,
removed one of the “ oldest identities ” of Maryborough.
Mr. Lambert, who was a native of England, arrived here
in 1860, and was for fully thirty years one of our prominent
citizens. He was a born compositor, and came of a family
of type-setters in the old country. From an accident
which occurred in infancy, Mr. Lambert was a sufferer all
his life, and his deformity was doubtless a source of unhappi-
ness to him. But he always maintained a cheerful deport-
ment, and was much liked by a wide circle of friends, who
lament his loss. His first and most ambitious effort in
publishing was The Tribune , a newspaper, which, during its
short existence, was a power in the community. He also
printed the Isis Advocate , and later on the Isis News. He
was 66 years of age at the time of his death, by pneumonia
and left a family of three sons and a number of daughters.
BANKING.
In every large trading community financial institutions
hold a prominent place, Maryborough being no exception.
The local banks are the Bank of New South Wales, Union
Bank, Bank of Australasia, Australian Joint Stock Bank,
Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, all having chief
offices in Brisbane and doing a large volume of business.
MARYBOROUGH LAND VALUES, 1890.
In 1889 the Wide Bay district was visited by a somewhat
erratic journalist—the late Aleck J. Ivimey, who, as the
result of his observations whilst travelling Bohemian-like,
published six pamphlets or brochures on Queensland. As
his remarks on “ Maryborough and its Land Values ”
appear appropriate to this work they are here transcribed

CHURCH OF ENGLAND PARSONAGE.


He says :—“ A market on Saturday would be a splendid
thing, both for the public and the consumers alike, but the
eternal tendency to talk to death, so characteristic of the
town, may stop the market for another few years. The
State subsidy to the divisional boards of £2 to £1 raised,
will expire at the end of this year, and only £1 for £1 will
be substituted for 1890. As the present Administration is
virtually in the hands of the House, it is necessary for
country members to go together for the higher rate, lest
their own higher rate —or rather hired rate—of £6 per
week be stopped for ever and for ever. However, the
shopkeepers of Maryborough reap the advantage of the low
values of property that rule at present, for a shop in the
main street can be rented for one-third of the cost of a
similar premises in Bundaberg, or one-tenth of those Queen
street rabbit hutches, where the smallness of the premises
is made amends for by the largeness of the rent. That’s
why Maryborough is solvent when its neighbours are not.
“ The city of Maryborough is just now very much down
financially, chiefly with wild cat mines at places such as
Gebangle, with Mount Perry copper, and with Brisbane
nepotism. But the worst is past, for the Eidsvold has
given 4,800 oz. in the last quarter, and a general election
is impending that will change the state of things in the
Maryborough foundries and timber mills as with magic,
when the remnant of political virus in the Polynesian Act
has expired by effluxion ot time. The season for the
farmers is the finest on record, and the back blocks in the
Central and Northern districts are bringing forth pastoral
treasures, that will be sheared and sent home within
another six months, that will make the banks far more
formidable than they are now. The land values of the
Mary metropolis are the lowest of any town in Queensland,
and the correspondingly moderate rents has much to do
with the commercial salvation of the town, even in times
like this. In the main highway, Kent street, opposite the
Chronicle office, whose building is in an appropriate state of
crumble, indicative of its journalistic condition, the land is
worth about £4O per foot, as there is a public house further
over in the next street. The hotel at the corner of Kent
and Richmond streets is owned, site and all, by the pro-
prietor, who paid £7,000 for the land—that is worth about'


the same now, for the Chronicle side is, and always has
been the wrong side as far as Maryborough is concerned.
Further down by Horsburgh’s, the land is worth consider-
ably more, say, up to £7O to £IOO per foot. George
Horsburgh, the oldest ironmonger in Maryborough, who
employs more white men than any other such firm, is a
strong advocate of kanakas, although he has never had any
direct dealings with them. Opposite the very ancient
Royal Hotel, that stands covered up with bunya pine trees
iu front, just as it did when Gympie was being invented,
the values are nearly the highest—where Finney, Isles and
Dawson’s, the bookseller are, the price is not less than
£IOO, and at Stupart’s corner, at the junction of Bazaar
and Kent streets, the paradise of the street preacher on
Saturday night, the values reach their highest. It is at
this corner, and in the roadway intervening that the traffic
is thickest and densest on Saturday nights, the only time
■when the town really loses its mausoleum aspect. In
Adelaide street from the Kent street corner, where the
School of Arts and the Salvation Army stand—the latter
on Saturdays, as aforesaid —the values run from £BO to £35
per foot, and further on past the Royal Exchange Hotel,
where the shops are seedier than usual, the prices are
seedy too, but on the opposite side where the buildings are
more substantial, the prices are far higher. Jonathan
Murray’s is almost the only decent shop on the other side
in that, street. Wharf street frontages—a regular back
street, but leading to the steamers, with three hotels in its
fifty yards of roadway, might be worth for warehouse
purposes £4O a foot. Bazaar street, between Kent street
and the Gardens, is worth from £BO to £4O. There are lots
of blank spaces that dot the city like a chessboard, and
when these eye-sores are taxed, and taxed heavily, there
will be an improvement in addition to that good time
already spoken of that is bound to come. The rates of
living are the lowest of any coastal town in Queensland —
less than half that of Cairns or the Towers, and the climate
is one that people can live in and settle in for generations,
instead of passing a few brief years, as in Northern climes,
just to make a rise and clear out. There will be very little
left except the miners in three generation in the North,
except in the Herberton tableland, for the white man as an


agricultural labourer is even a more conspicuous frauds in
the north than he is in the south. In the Wide Bay
district, where the Danes and Swedes acclimatise as to the
manner born, and where the hottest noon-days are followed
with cool nights, different enough from the red-hot smells
of Townsville in January, there can be no doubt as to
which is the best place to speculate in land, more especially
as the auctioneer fiend has been almost comatose for the
past three years, since the bust up of the Isistown—swin—
settlement. Most of the houses there to-day have
apparently settled into the wallum, for they are there no
longer. Town values are always safe, especially in a place
of 10,000, where the people can fill a big Presbyterian
church every Sunday, and can pay their minister £IOO
more than the Anglican parson gets. That’s a sign of
solidity, as I take it anyhow.”
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
First impressions of new places are often erroneous, but
I do not think my first impressions of Maryborough are
likely to be wrong, when I say that as a large and populous
centre of trade, it will compare favourably not only with
Toowoomba and other Queensland towns, but with many
of those much vaunted and overlauded cities down south.
Certainly, one expects much progress in 85 years, and if
we revive or resuscitate some of the “ old hands ” we knew
about that time, would they not stare at the changes ?
Instead of Melville and Travis’s or Dowzer or Purser’s
being the only stores, or species of all-sorts shops, at which
everything was vended “ from a needle to an anchor,” they
would now be lost in amazement at such elegant establish-
ments as Geo. Stupart’s, or Bartholomew’s, or Finney,
Isles’ ; whilst the modern fashions would have struck our
ancient madames into the proverbial “ cocked hat.” The
Royal Hotel, which may not be inaptly termed a relic of
the past, still stands as of yore in the same place, looking
very much too as if it meant to defy the ravages of Time
for a century to come. Aldridge, its first proprietor, now
sleeps beneath the sod, and a long line of successors have


followed him. In the olden times there was only Aldridge’s
hotel and none other to satisfy drinkers with thirst unques-
tionable ; now there are at least forty others at which the
best liquors and all the requirements of modern refine-
ment and comfort are to be obtained. One sight very
familiar to the olden resident here was the numerous bullock
or horse teams which brought loading down or took stores
up country, and whose drivers were about as free-and-easy
and as good-natured fellows as could be met; whilst on the
road they were up to their work, and no bullock or horse
dared “jib at a pinch,” or bog-hole, for fear of castigation,
but the journey ended, they seemed to think it their duty
not only to drink themselves, but to draw all and sundry
who were willing into the same stream, so that “ shouting”
was the order of the day, or rather days, until all the cash
was done, and “ tick ” being refused, they departed to their
usual work well satisfied. Well, you see none of this now ;
indeed, one wonders what has become of these free-and-easy
souls, who were “no man’s enemy but their own.” And
there were rare times when the shearing was on, and the
shearers came to town with their cheques from the Burnett
or Wide Bay districts.
Oh, had you been at the shearing shed
When the clipping time was near !
Grand songs were sung, fine yarns were said,
By those who came to shear !
And the shearing was a glorious time,
Ne’er forgot, though pass’d away ;
We’ll see no more those men of yore,
The shearers of Wide Bay ?
Our bullock-drivers, with the past
Are gone, but unforgot;
O’er them the earth has long been cast,
Here was their camping spot.
We meet to-night where once they met,
With many a loaded dray;
Their memory we shall ne’er forget,
Dear “ old hands ” of Wide Bay !
But of progress municipal some imagine there is little.
People now-a-days will talk, and they ask what can you
show for your overdraft ? If we could resuscitate Mr.
Melville, mayor, and Mr. Barnes, town clerk, and inquire
of them what we have gained, their reply would be worth
recording. Take a piece of waste land with thick jungle


around it, without houses, population or settlement,
barring a hut or two, or blackfellows’ gunyahs, and turn
that into a city with well laid out streets, paved and
guttered, shops teeming with goods of modern manufacture
and art, lighted with gas lamps, and with hne public
buildings, railway station, schools and School of Arts, and
then tell me are not such signs _of progress? Certainly,
our Town Hall is not such an edifice as should adorn this
city, but when we recall the “overdraft” it is clear we
must wait a little longer to erect a suitable building worthy
of Maryborough. But “ down south ” I remember to have
seen many town halls of less pretentious appearance than
ours, even in rising cities, and the “ wait awhile ” principle
had to be applied to them even as here. I have recollection
of a somewhat ludicrous incident which occurred at Lawler
in South Australia, shortly after the foundation stone of
the new Town Hall had been laid by Mr. James Martin, the
then Mayor. As usual in such cases there was placed with
great ceremony beneath the stone several gold and silver
coins, all of which were stolen by vandals in the night.
The theft was discovered ere the builders began the rest of
the work, and more coins were substituted for those missing.
Contrary to the good old times at present, we do not observe
many of the genus lushington standing at the hotel bars
anxious to “ knock down 5 the hard-earned checjue received
for loading or shearing. In fact, since coming here I have
seen few teams; formerly they passed through the town on
average about thirty per day. Instead of the crack of the
“bull-puncher’s ” whip or the stockrider’s “gully-raker,”
you now hear the shriek of the incoming or outgoing train,
the roar and clatter of traffic in the thoroughfares, and
witness a thorough change in everything, in sight and
sound everywhere. We had no public gardens in those
days ; now I find a well laid out ornamental and beautiful
spot of resort for the people, who, on warm days, can here
find pleasant shades, comfortable seats, and fine panoramic
views of the river scenery. I also observe a fine bandstand
in these gardens, and learn that once a week a brass band
of talented performers “discourse sweet music” for the
delectation of those who choose to attend these promenade
performances.
Like many other towns Maryborough seems to have its
“gas grievance,” the high rates charged for gas militating


against a more general use ; in fact, in several of the hotels
only kerosene is used, and in the year a saving of several
pounds is effected. At the Great Western Hotel the change
from gas to kerosene has saved the landlord many pounds
expenditure in the year, an important matter in these bad
times. Here is a matter requiring reform, for considering
our vast coal supplies at Burrum, gas should be at prices
within reach of everyone. Still, with all drawbacks, Mary-
borough is well lighted, and its shops, when illuminated on
Saturday evenings, present a pleasing and attractive
appearance. As I shall have occasion to revert more fully
to municipal matters later on, I shall not continue the
subject here, though I never think of the Maryborough
Corporation without remembering poor Chiam, the celestial
councillor, his matrimonial troubles, and his vessels, and a
lot of other things familiar yet to the “old hands” of
Wide Bay. In that bygone day Mr. Sheridan was a familiar
figure in our streets. Who does not remember R. 8.5.,
the man of many parts, and a ruler of Wide Bay ? Mr.
Sheridan was a ( very great man at that period, but his
mantle has descended on others who now occupy the
position he held. Charles Hardie Buzacott and others are
never seen now, but are remembered still. Fancy pictures
too, Mr. Barns and Mr. Symes, solicitors, with those for-
midable law books at the courthouse, with Mr. Sheridan on
the bench—suave, versatile, yet upholding the majesty of
the law when some unfortunate “ drunk ” was brought
before him by Mr. Harwood, the police officer. Mr.
Harwood, yet alive and well, is one of our oldest celebrities,
and I was pleased to have an introduction to one familiar to
me in that bygone time.

THE WIDE BAY FLOODS.
These almost annual visitations, which were in bygone
times disastrous to the town and district, are now happily
much modified and less ruinous. The most notable floods
on record occurred during 1871, 1875-6, 1885, 1890, and
1898. The report of disaster for one is equally applicable
to all; I therefore give the impressions of an eye-witness
to that of 1890 :—“ There had been no lack of floods else-
where, and the Government Meteorologist, Mr. Clement
Wragge, had not been behind in prognosticating bad
weather. The north had its floods, and the Burdekin
Bridge near the Towprs had been impassable, and it
became evident that the south was to get its share. As far
back as January 17th the passengers from Noosa to Gympie
by Myles’ coach had to get out at the Six-mile Creek, and
walk round to Ccoran, the railway terminus, just in time to
catch the last train that week to Gympie. The coach got
across a day or so after, and the mails came on all right;
but the Culgoa and Adonis from Brisbane to Noosa, were
making very irregular passages by reason of stress of
weather. On the road from Cooran to Noosa by Matters’
coach, that esteemed man pointed out a ridge of some 20
chains wide, that, if cut, would take the storm waters from


Gympie, and send them into the Noosa Bay, which would
make that harbour at the heads far safer. And until the
State takes the matter in hand, at the cost of the colony,
the people of Wide Bay will continue to talk and to suffer
as they have done for the past generation. Gympie did not
seem to care much about the flood; they are things it is
used to, for not more than six months back the waters had
stopped some of the mines and the sawmills that lie on low
ground. At Maryborough there were all sorts of rumours,
but the main idea there was to keep a watchful eye on
Gympie, as the state of the river there was a sure guide to
what it would be at Maryborough. And so the days went
by till the 20th of January, the weather being as disagree-
able as the most confirmed sceptic could wish. Tales of
the old flood days of ’7l and ’75 came into fashion ail
through the district, and in a general sort of way people
thought they kept their weather eye open. Gympie was
quiet enough, and the river there was only gradually rising
during that last week in January, but on Thursday and
Friday there were exceptionally heavy downfalls, some of
them registering as much as 8 to 10 inches in one day.
Till Friday there was nothing so very bad from Gympie,
where all the attention centred, but, unluckily for Tiaro
and those of the Maryborough district, the watch was not
kept at the proper place. At Gundiah, half-way between
Gympie and Maryborough, are a couple of rivulets called
Wide Bay and Munna creeks that are ordinarily fordable,
but which are the channels of a supply from the Kilkivan
mountain district, that had an enormous quantity of rain,
which had already flooded Glastonbury as with an ava-
lanche, costing some few lives and doing incalculable damage
to the settlers there. The result was one that was as
disastrous as unforeseen. On the Friday, although the
river had swollen within a few inches of the wharf, little
notice was taken, as Gympie reported nothing extra of
importance ; but if there had been a watcher, as there
should have been, at Gundiah, he would have seen a
mighty torrent coming down from the mountains, bearing
destruction and ruin in its course. Had the warning been
taken in time, most of the Tiaro settlers who had taken up
land on what is known as Wilson’s Pocket, would have had
time to clear out, and along the river between there and


Maryborough, which is taken up mainly in small selections,
the holders would have been able to save their household
belongings, as well as the hay, potatoes, and maize lying
packed ready for market, with not a thought of danger.
No precautions of any consequence were taken at the town,
for Wilson, Hart and Co. were above the highest level ever
known as events subsequently proved ; but further up the
river on both sides, both at Granville, as will be seen in the
article on that place, and at the town wharves themselves,
the destruction was something appalling. Saturday was
when the alarm really took place, and to his credit be it
said, Mr. Sexton, the traffic manager of the railway line
wrote to Mr. Hyne, of the National Sawmill, offering him
the use of the railway to remove the million or so feet of
timber stacked there; and it is said that proposals were
made to the same man concerning the removing and stack-
ing of his timber on higher ground, that he rejected,
partly, it is said, on the ground of expense. This cost him
very dear, for by Sunday the flood had covered a space not
less than half a mile wide, and was rushing down with a
dull low roar that will be remembered for many and many
a year by the sufferers. The Tiaro farmers suffered first,
and then came the nearer settlers. The mighty mass of
boiling muddy surge did not come alone. On it, eddied and
hoisted about with continually varying currents, were trees,
haystacks, portions of houses, sheets of iron, and scores of
tons of produce, taken remorselessly from the unsuspecting
settlers of the river side, who had too often to flee at a
minute’s notice from the destroyer, carrying with them
nothing but the clothing they had on at the time ; and in
some cases it got as far as sitting on the roof of a dis-
mantled dwelling trembling with the violence of the flood,
expecting to be washed away every minute. It is satis-
factory to be able to add that, in these few extreme cases,
there were found heroic ones ready to risk their lives to save
others ; and when a whaleboat, lent by O’Kane and Cherry
to the people of Gympie, had gone up as far as the “ pocket ”
right up at Maryborough, it returned without meeting a single
case of distress unprovided for. This, however, was a fore-
gone conclusion; for, thanks to Inspector Lloyd, the
respected head of the Maryborough police, who, with
Captain Boult, the harbour master, worked day and night


to prevent any loss of life, there was really nothing to do
for the Gympie expedition, which included no less a person
than the respected Town Clerk of that city, who was
warmly cheered on his return to Mary street. The fact is,
all day on Saturday the boat’s crew commanded by Captain
Boult had gone everywhere men could go, and it will sound
strange enough to add, that in most cases people in
imminent danger of being washed away, strongly objected
to be interfered with, and in some cases nothing short of
actual violence was necessary. One woman, who repulsed
the crew at one time, waved a sheet frantically enough
half-an-hour later; and it says something for the crew, and
of their commander, that the work was done so thoroughly
in spite of these drawbacks that nothing was left for the
Gympie expedition. Walker’s shed on Saturday, which
breasted three different currents for many an hour, got
almost submerged before it gave way, while Hyne’s saw-
mill being further back kept its roof intact while the whole
of the timber was washed down—a loss that is almost
irreparable to that gentleman. The same fate befel Sim’s
mill further down, and the tramway that connected
Walker’s works with the shed, of viaduct construction, was
similarly destroyed. The Grand Hotel, a three-storied
building, the property of Corser and Co., stood the force of
the flood well throughout, being sheltered by the sheds
further up, but by Sunday the second floor was on a level
with the tide, and the only way to get out was by boats.
The old Planter's Herald office on the other side of the
street, facing the wharves, stood melancholy enough with
its upper windows just visible, while the buildings of the
Howard Smith and Co. and the Torbanlea Colliery were
completely out of sight altogether. Corser’s shed to the
right of the Grand was one of the last to be demolished
on Sunday, January 26.
Kent street, the leading thoroughfare of Maryborough,
had a circumscribed length on that memorable day, which it
is hoped it will never have again. A large crowd on horse-
back, in carriages, and on foot, were assembled at the
entrance to Walker’s yard where the water blocked their
further progress. Walker’s wharf had then disappeared,
and not long after Corser’s store at the rear suffered a
similar fate. Round the corner in the direction of the


wharves was the “ Grand ” half under the flood, while the
coastline of Granville appeared to have gone out of the
horizon altogether. Further down the stream, three
sailing vessels stood breasting the furious torrent, with the
strongest hawsers procurable attached to the nearest big
tree, that in every case proved reliable. The coastal
steamers had to pass by the Wide Bay Heads without
daring to enter, and to go on past the Burnett where the
outpouring torrent was equally formidable, Rockhampton
being the only safe port north of Brisbane. The lower
part of Kent street as far as D. Clarke’s, the chemist, was
flooded to a depth of some four feet, and opposite the
School of Arts the road was blocked as far as the Grammar
School grounds. The gardens were accessible only by the
post office entrance, and by that close to Wilson and Hart’s
office, for a great flood down in the hollow, blocked Sussex
street completely, rendering the route to the Presbyterian
Church only possible by going up past the railway, and on
to the Gayndah road as far as Ferry street. There was a
day service there, some sixty attending, and there was an
equally scanty congregation in the evening. The Rev. J.
Knipe, in his morning discourse, preached with powerful,
quiet eloquence m a manner befitting the solemnity of the
occasion, spoke of the troubles as that which had devastated
all around where they sat, being the means of bringing
their fellow sympathies closer together, and of making
their sufferings occasions of benefit. How well that
doctrine was taken to heart is seen in the fact that at the
meeting held on Tuesday following at which £SOO was
raised, the retiring Mayor’s name, Mr. J. C. Bryant,
headed the list with £IOO voted by the council. Sub-
scriptions were started throughout the district, and the
remainder of an unexpended Wide Bay subscription for the
London strike fund was ready to be included in the
municipal floods relief fund. That list was also supple-
mented by the State at the hands of C. Powers, M.L.A.
All the commercial houses gave liberally, for the farmers
were their own customers, who will experience yet more
forbearance at their creditors’ hands in view of the generosity
shown on every side. The damage at a very rough esti-
mate cannot be less than a million sterling, in fact it has
been estimated far higher, but the truth is not all known


yet. It is only enough to know that the greatest flood that
the Wide Bay district has ever seen has come for a week
and gone, and has left behind hundreds of ruined and
destitute people to provide for or succour. Is there any-
thing necessary to add to this, save that the town fund is
now (February 4) £l,lBO ?
Granville is a suburb of Maryborough, possessing some
few hundreds of inhabitants, and a fairly good back country
that has yet to be taken up, with plenty of eligible sites for
suburban villas on the topmost ridge of the suburb, which,
as experience has just shown, is flood proof from the
highest deluge that has yet visited Maryborough within the
memory of white men, although the blacks allege that
there was once a time when all the town was under water,
with the exception of the cemetery. Now that the secret
of this flood has been discovered, it is likely that future
generations will be far wiser and better prepared. Granville
is to have a bridge that would best benefit the shipping and
mercantile interests by going to Norway street, although
the local interests would be better conserved by taking the
Raglan street route. This, at any rate, is the opinion of
Mr. L. Steindl, the brewer, and who, with Mr. Heath, the
draper, have been in a position to considerably mitigate the
trouble caused by the flood, that for about a week com-
pelled the people on the river and first flats to take refuge
on the second higher elevation where the Christ Church
(Anglican) and the State school stand. The school indeed
and the church were the common asylum for the score or
so of people who suddenly found themselves without a
home, who had everything they wanted placed at their
disposal by Messrs. Steindl and Heath. The former sent
his boat and trap, with what provisions were necessary,
while Mr. Heath was ready with his drapery to those
whose clothing was washed down the river. There is one
hotel at Granville, the Granville Arms, kept by one Richard
Tighe, who had everything swept away at a total loss of
about £l5O, but who was pretty busy serving a crowd of
customers which I called, on the subsidence of the flood.
Tighe spoke very highly of Mr. Steindl, whose beer was all
that he sold, because none other was asked for ; a pecu-
liarity common to two or three houses on the town side of
the river. As far as could be gathered from enquiries


made, the damage done was as follows : —Sullivan’s shop
and house all swept away, Mrs. Ellis and Mr. Whitaker’s
adjoining, in Raglan street, coming up from the ferry,
together with the hotel just mentioned which stood serene
through the flood. Kelly’s, Mrs. Hughes’, Simpson’s,
McCredie’s, and Thomas’ houses in Napier street also
wrecked, and a farmer named Noritsky suffered the loss of
his dairy and piggery. The other sufferers whose houses
were either submerged or swept away, were given as
MacDonnell, Sullivan, Bryson, Burns, and Concanon, the
last including a house and a quarter acre of ground which
was clean washed away at a total loss of over £2OO.
Another dairyman named Gusskoff suffered the loss of
his dairy, and Dowell lost all he had. Anderson,
another dairyman, suffered in a similar manner.
Altogether Granville was represented in general trouble
by about fifty people being destitute and about eight
houses washed away altogether. Two other houses
also suffered, that of Mrs. ' Baxter being shifted, and
Mrs. Boulter’s sunk into the ground, rendered like a sponge
by the constant rushing of water. Fortunately Mrs.
Holmes, who plays the organ at Christ Church on Sunday
afternoons, and Mr. Roberts, who teaches the children in
the Sunday School, were none the worse, as the flood did
not trouble them. Sullivan’s house was the property of
Mr. Rooney, who will bear that part of the loss. A good
deal of the damage done was owing to some of the people
refusing to clear out when asked, as they had seen
the 1875 flood come and pass without touching them;
and it may be added that this sort of heedlessness on the
other side of the river was the direct cause of some of
biggest smashes that occurred there. It is cheering to add,
as showing the general character of the people at Granville,
that no sickness has since come among those left in the
church and school house, and that every ordinary necessity
was given freely and without anything more than a payment
of thanks. All cases of loss were duly investigated by the
town committee, with the mayor at its head. The total
loss at Granville cannot be far short of a thousand pounds.


At Bundaberg.
The Burnett Bridge, now in process of erection, has
suffered heavily, for only one out of six cylinders placed in
position is now left standing, while the wharf of the
Bundaberg Foundry Company has suffered severely. Michael
Duffy’s shed, the leading one, has been washed away, while
Howard Smith’s shed, and a smaller one, has gone too. A
punt moored at the ferry broke loose, and after a short
but perilous journey, its one occupant, a man, was rescued
at Fairymeade. That grand plantation of 660 acres is
almost totally destroyed, and Messrs. Young’s had deser-
vedly the name of being far and away the best employers of
labour in the district to both white men and kanakas alike.
Miss Young’s Sunday school for the kanakas is a pleasant
tradition of Fairymeade. The loss must be simply enor-
mous, running into some five thousand pounds. The
greatest height of the 1875 flood was overtopped, and the
portions of the town between Woondooma street and South
Bundaberg were all under water, so that sailing boats were
the chief means of intercommunication. Skyring’s sawmill
was flooded, and the Kennedy Bridge rails were invisible.
In North Bundaberg there was not a dry yard of ground
there on the memorable 26th of January, and there were so
few houses safe that the Masonic Hall and the Young
Australian Hotel were the only reliable camping places.
Some 250 people went by rail to Avoca, where the ground
was higher. Three of the bridge cylinders have dis-
appeared, and a lot of the working gear is gone as well—all
dead loss to the contractor, Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Tom
Penny, one of the owners of Millbank Plantation, had a
very narrow shave from being drowned, and only escaped
with the greatest difficulty. The railway station at North
Bundaberg was a hopeless mass of desolation, and all over the
yard the debris of the jumbled up waggons remarkable,,
for the flood came straight from the river, right across the
town in its desolating track, and the line in all directions is
seriously damaged. The amount of destruction at Bunda-
berg cannot be known for some time at the least, and
the total will be a terribly large one, running into scores of
thousands of pounds. One of the most memorable incidents
was the drowning of a man named Jacobsen on the 27th,
who tried to cross a running creek instead of going round


it, and never completed the contract. A man named
Moore, who had a contract for building a lightship at the
Fitzroy, was swept down the river in a punt, in which he
was in company with another man whose name has not yet
transpired. Nothing has been since seen or heard of them,
although a search party consisting of Messrs. Bennett,
Geary, Stiller, and others went in search as far as the
Kolan River, the Lady Musgrave being chartered for the
trip by the Customs people. The fact of the gasworks
being submerged at Kennedy Bridge caused the Bundaberg
Mail to make its appearance on the 28th in quarto size, in
consequence of its gas machine being inoperative. How-
ever, the Wednesday’s issue came out all right, and both
Mail and gasworks are now going ahead as much as ever.
The Star had to substitute hand labour for its Otto gas-
engine in running the Wharfedale plant, the paper appearing
in all its usual glory. The Tribune is still existent, editor
and all, and when the latter becomes “ turbulent and
truculent ” his contributions during these periods are care-
fully used for other purposes than printing.
Gympie was very dull and depressed, as anyone might
well imagine it would be after a week’s flood and a complete
cutting off from the outside world, with the exception, of
course, of her sister city, Maryborough. All that was
talked about was the flood, which has been very merciful to
Gympie, inasmuch as the main damage in the town was
confined to the thorough cleansing out of a public house in
the valley that did not, however, touch the Army Barracks
a few yards away. Hallelujah ! It was the Kilkivan flood
that did the mischief. But there is no denying that the
dulness at Gympie was simply awful, for there were many
miners out of employment. There were only three
or four mines really bad with water, including the
Nicholls and the South Ellen Harkins and Monkland,
with of course the 2 and 3 South Smithfield; and it is
equally a part and parcel of every flood that sawmill
Ferguson gets an exterior liquidation, which really does
him no harm, and besides he insists on paying his men’s
wages the whole of the time they are “ hung up.” Down
through the Brisbane road farming district the floods had
been severe enough, but the news was as yet hardly to
hand, but in one case the loss was not less than £I,OOO.


1 '^'"*' XW<i * l * i ' ” \ i y .-. ■ U I. . . . III!
OLD MARYBOROUGH BRIDGE AFTER FLOOD, 1893.


The mines were mainly exempt, and the carefulness of the
Warden in refusing to grant exception except to mines
permanently flooded was making him increasingly popular.
There had been at Gympie nothing approaching the whole-
sale desolation at Maryborough, and most of the farms in
the intermediate neighbourhood had got off more or less
lightly. Although there came no bitter cry from the many
settlers (homeless in a single night) it is because they
feel that the people of Australia only want to know in
order that the offerings of condolence, more substantial
than words, will come in as fast as did the raging
torrents themselves. The already magnificent response
made by Maryborough is full of significance, inasmuch as
its recent offering to the great Dillon was less than a half
of Gympie’s, and there are not a few in Gympie to-day
who cordially state that the gift to that gentleman,
however famous or distinguished he might be, was a mistake
when such things as floods were liable to come. How-
ever, the common affliction has washed away the jarring
discord between the two towns, seeing that it is the farmers
who dwell between, who belong to neither place, who
are the greatest losers—and the most patient and uncom-
promising losers—that it has been my lot to see.
Among the losses suffered by Mr. Hyne, of the National
Mills, are nine houses opposite his mill in Kent street;
all are gone, and the very machinery of the mill is forty
yards distant. The timber in the yard was recently valued
at £8,500. Pettigrew’s or Sim’s mill escaped, but all
the timber suffered. The Chinamen’s gardens all
around were completely swept of everything save their
owners, and the farm of Mr. Braddock, of the Union
Foundry, shared the same fate. In Mr. Perry’s well-
known house and garden not far off, the farm suffered
to the extent of £1,300. Nearly a hundred fruit trees
were uprooted, and 80,000 pines, with 800 grafted
orange trees, with 1,500 bananas, have gone. Mr.
Butler’s eight acres adjoining is in the same state,
and the farms of Messrs. Shaw, Copas, Fuchs and
Butler, with those of the Chinamen aforesaid, are
ruined ; a haystack from Mr. Butler’s having been deposited
whole and entire not far from the Presbyterian Church,
some hundred yards further down the river. The Grand


Hotel practically lost nothing, and is as good as ever,
the piles driven to the bedrock of the river having done
their work well. The Isis Co.’s and Howard Smith’s
wharves are all right, but the sheds of the latter company
are gone, while Walkers Limited has suffered the same
fate. The portions of the bridge for the Cairns Railway
still lay in the yard untouched. Two deaths by drowning
are reported so far. Mr. Bensted’s cottage and Mr.
Perry’s house went adrift, the latter making a gallant
struggle as a “ coign o’ vantage ” in the centre of the flood.
One benefit accruing by the demolition of the Union shed
will be a finer and more elaborate one —that Walkers
Limited are well able to afford, despite their losses, which
are somewhat heavy. The flood was 2 feet 9 inches above
the highest point of 1875. The work of restoring the
beacons in the river and bay will have to be done, as most
of them have disappeared, and it is too early to know how
the main channel has been affected. Some thirty families
were provided with clothes at the Town Hall, that has
been appropriately made refuge for the homeless.
It is stated from Brisbane that the way Maryborough
subscribed to the 1887 flood visitation was fully reciprocated
at the meeting which was held at Brisbane for augmenting
the flood funds, which it did by £4OO. By the Thursday
following that famous Sunday, the great flood of 1890 was
practically over.
After nearly a week, the floods gradually fell day by day,
till by Thursday morning one was able to ride down to the
ferry across the river, which had commenced running again
in something like its former channel. Walkers’ shipping
shed had gone, but the Union wharf stood there, a good
deal the worse for its frightful belabourings. The wharf of
Walkers Limited will require a general putting straight,
and the total cost of all damage done will be about £3,000,
a damage which the company, fortunately for its men—
who made up the largest local crowd—are both willing and
able to pay for as well as dividends. A plantation at
Bundaberg is owned privately by the directors, who have
only saved 80 acres out of 400 of extremely prosperous sugar-
cane. Mr. Braddock’s loss of his orchard and farm closely
approximate £2,000, but he does not appear particularly
cast down on the point. But the biggest loser is Mr. R.


Hyne, whose total loss of the National Mills, with nine
houses adjoining, means some £6,000, a good deal of which
he might have saved had he listened to the warnings of his
friends. Inspector Lloyd and Sergeant Gallagher gave the
alarm to the farmers and townspeople generally, through
the police, on the Friday before the flood, but although
wisdom cried, her voice was not heard. Corser and
Company, of the Grand Hotel, which has come very
well out of its troubles, sustained a loss of some
£4OO over an ancient store that abutted on the hotel;
in it they have all the ironwork to start with, and the
work of rebuilding had long been necessary. Mr. Henry
Taylor, of the Albion Timber Mills, was one of the
few fully prepared, and his damage is something he
can afford to laugh at, for he a is very popular “ boss”
with his men, who had their annual feast-day just
over a month ago, and who soon cleared everything the
waters could damage. Messrs. Sim and Co., of Petti-
grew’s, have also suffered heavily. Some of the lower
Kent street storekeepers—that is those who do business
at the lower end near the old barracks, that ought to have
been a State market long ago, have had their basement
floors flooded, and on the 26th of January, two or three
feet to add to their affliction. The Queen’s Hotel had four
feet of water level with the verandah, but the host
appeared to take it rather as a joke than otherwise. Elijah
Watson’s wine store and Clarke’s Eucalyptus chemist’s shop
were among these, but both proprietors were as pleasantly
visible as ever two days after, when the water disappeared.
But the real brunt of the trouble was borne by the
farmers on both sides of the river between Maryborough
and Tiaro, fifteen miles distant by rail, and a branch
committee of the Maryborough Flood Relief Committee,
inaugurated at the early part of the week, divided them-
selves into three sub-committees to seek out the sufferers.
The Tiaro men concerned were Messrs. Jonathan Job,
Ewen, Crank, and another, who included subsequently
Messrs. Scougall, H. M. Hall, Hammill, Mant, Ogilvie,
Moffatt, Dowzer, Lindlay, M‘Kellar, H. Gordon, Joyce and
Wade, with Morrow, of Gundiah. The sub-committee
appointed to do Blackmount and Wilson’s Pocket first came
upon one Sorenson, who had lost fifty-eight acres of maize,


and had his barn buildings and everything destroyed, includ-
ing potatoes. Phillpott’s, the next case, had everything
destroyed, but his house was too high for the flood to reach.
Brimm’s had not lost much, as his land was far higher.
He gave every assistance by carrying the two men across in
his boat to the sufferers in Wilson’s Pocket. Andreas
Jocumsen lost everything on his farm, but he has some
land higher up to fall back on. Jacob Hansen, who
knew himself secure from the ’75 flood, and whose wife
taught at the Sunday school, lost his home and farm and
is ruined. He had only two shillings when finally
and in Soren Sorensen’s house, with his wife and family,
they had nothing but what they wore. A. J. Madsen
is in a similar case, having lost everything, including
forty to fifty hives of bees, which were his livelihood.
Soren Sorensen, who had three families of refugees with
him, lost all his crops. Charley Davey, a bachelor, and
his two men climbed to the roof of their house in the
darkness and called aloud for help, which was rendered
by Sorensen and a party with no small risk. The
other names of men who lost their farms, and in some
cases their houses, were Jens Jensen, 22 acres of corn lost,
6 acres saved, but it is doubtful if the corn is saleable. j[
Torpey lost 44 acres, including 20 bags of maize in the
barn. John Hammell is a big loser of 12 to 15 tons of
potatoes, 5,000 bags of corn, and 12 tons of hay. His
haystack was carried down to Maryborough and deposited
in Sussex street, close to the Presbyterian Church, in a
decidedly advanced stage of decay. He does not care to
plant again, as he fears the winter frost. Lars Anderson is
another heavy loser, and his land is afflicted with nut grass,
which is not charged extra for—he pays from 20s. to 255!
per acre per annum. The Pioneer Provisional school has
been removed bodily some J-mile distant by the flood, and
stands bottom upwards with some £7O worth of school
and children’s books inside. S. T. Richards has lost 15
acres of land at Owanyilla, one of the finest crops in the
district. Gysing has lost 80 acres of maize, of which he
has saved 80 bushels. Mrs. Bensted loses 18 acres, Mrs.
Rank 28 acres, W. Carruthers has lost everything, A.
Moffatt 18 acres of maize ; Shielback loses 10 acres', J.
Neilson 800 bushels of corn, Fitzpatrick 7 acres of corn,


and Fruss 5 acres, and Jacob Eassmussen has lost every-
thing, including 12 bags of maize in his barn. There
are other sufferers in the Tiaro section —chiefly Danes.
Messrs. Magnussen, H. M. Hall (of Aurora, the irrigated
plantation), Jorgensen and Lars Anderson, T. Lawrence,
M. Stevens, Andersen, Andrews, Carlson, Jenkins, Tulloch,
Hendricksen and Johnson have lost largely. Brisbane
subscribed largely, and other towns followed suit. It is
generally felt in Maryborough that all subcriptions should
be put into a permanent fund, so that when floods come
the help will be as prompt and discriminating as the
public have a right to expect it should be. When the
Mayor, F. Bryant, asked his council for £SO for the flood
victims, he did so as one who had refused £2OO as mayoral
allowance during his term of office. And the council
responded, as they were fully justified in doing with £IOO,
after Aldermen Nick Tooth and Booker had tried to make
it £2OO.
IN THE EARLY DAYS.
“ Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and the
avenues to wrong rather than Eight and Justice were easy to follow.”
It is a fact that a settler on the Upper Burnett in 1858
engaged a servant girl for his station through an agent in
Brisbane, and after her arrival with teams, finding his
efforts to seduce her useless, one night committed an
outrage on her, and then turned her adrift. Fortunately,
after wandering for several hours in the bush, she was
discovered by a friendly blackfellow and his gin, who
piloted her to the Brisbane road, where, under escort of
some rough, but kindly teamsters, she reached her destina-
tion. To add to her misfortunes, the poor girl dis-
covered on reaching Brisbane, that the squatter’s cheque
received for wages was valueless. And yet, that man
escaped punishment for this, not the least of his misdeeds.
He is dead now, the victim of his lusts.
It is also a fact that two emigrants from England who
had been shepherding on the Burnett Downs for twelve
ments, consented to leave their earnings, £SO each, in the
squatter’s hands, and that he, to get rid of them, sent a

Drowned in Flood, 1873.


flock of worthless “culls” to a far-out station, at which,
just before, two men had been killed by the blacks. The
poor new chums met a similar fate, and their wages in
their master’s hands were kept by him, and never heard of.
After their death, the native police came and drove the
blacks to the scrubs and a better flock was then put on the
ground, and quiet prevailed, but the fate of the murdered
men was soon forgotten.
Many strange events which occurred in 1858 are con-
tinually recurring to memory, and among them the follow-
ing impressed me greatly by its suddenness and tragic
nature. Two young men, brothers from the Highlands of
Scotland, having left their native land for Sydney, were
induced to purchase a station in the Wide Bay district, and
accordingly having fitted out a party, came to Maryborough
en route to their station, which was up Widgee way, and
but partly stocked. The party were well fitted out with a
team, labourers, stockmen and stores, and started hopefully
on their outbound trip. The young men, who were
separately aged 18 and 20 years, were most enthusiastic in
their liking for the free bush life they were about to enter
upon ; whilst to become “ good squatters ” seemed the
acme of their desires. The weather was very hot when
they left Maryborough, and on reaching the Six-mile Creek,
it was resolved by the party to camp for a couple of hours,
turn out the team and made a pot of tea. The elder of
the youths, quite unaware of the indiscretion of drinking
water whilst in a heated state, went to a waterhole, and
lying face downwards, inbibed a large quantity of the fluid,
which, being screened by thick timber and dense shade,
was of icy coolness. Sudden and severe chills, gripings
and intense pains followed, and cramps and spasm in about
a quarter of an hour closed his life, for notwithstanding all
the rude remedies at hand, and the care and attention of
his mates, the poor fellow succumbed to his fate, to the
sorrow of his brother and the rest of the party who had
regarded him as a favourite. His sudden death broke up
the party, and his brother, instead of going to the station
which they had purchased, turned back to Maryborough
and took first steamer for Sydney, where he disposed of the
station by auction and then sailed for Scotland, to bear the
sad tidings to heartbroken parents in “ Auld Reekie.” The


funeral of the young man took place at Six-mile Creek, the
burial service being read by the Rev. R. Postlethwaite,
of St. Paul’s Church, a man much liked, as were also his
predecessors, the Revs. E. Tanner and T. L. Dodd, both
pioneer ministers, whose ministrations commenced at Wide
Bay in 1858. When we now attend the Sunday services at
St. Paul’s, and listen to the Rev. Canon Eva’s eloquent
discourses, how few of us think, or perhaps know, aught
of the devoted pioneer clergymen who gave time and
energies to the building up of this popular church. The
Rev. E. Tanner, the first Church of England minister,
was here from August 1858 to February 1854, and
afterwards rector of the same church from January 1878
to March 1875.
By the river as I wander
Voices whisper soft and low,
Near the rushes there I ponder
On the days of long ago ;
Speaks to me some loving spirit,
Some departed friendly soul,
Gone to purer joys inherit,
Bliss beyond this earth’s control,
As I gaze upon the river,
While such visions round me rise,
Those who are forgotten never
Draw tears from my earnest eyes !
I don’t recollect much where the dead were formerly
buried, but the present Maryborough Cemetery is
creditable to the town. Probably on tombstones there you
would not find the names of any who were buried there as
far back as 1857; the usual way on stations being to
inter the corpse in its clothes or some rough made
slab box. I have in later years been thrown in contact
with many fastidious people who believed there was no hope
of heaven or happiness in the next world unless they could
be buried in “ consecrated ground.” Think of the thousands
of bushmen, shepherds and others who have died in these
districts either lost in the bush, or struck down by the
tomahawks or nullah nullahs of savages—where are their
graves ? Not in “consecrated ground”! Where lie the last
remains of the Frazer family ? In a grass-grown mound
on the Dawson, buried near where they were massacred ?
not in consecrated ground !


It seems strange to one who, like myself, compares the
Maryborough of present time to what it was in 1856, to
observe its marvellous progress. Picture the ladies who,
though perhaps numbering but half-a-dozen, found at
Melville and Travis’ store all they required in garments,
now being resuscitated and promenading Kent-street.
What wonderful prizes could they now unearth at Finney,
Isles’, Stupart’s, Doonan and Hanley’s, and other
emporiums of modern art and fashion, wdiere the latest
up-to-date fashions are to be found, and articles which were
unthought of in these primitive times are accounted
appendages to every lady’s habiliments, and to be pro-
cured. The ladies of 1856 had, I think, but one parasol
between them, and that came from Sydney, so Melville
and Travis, thinking there would be a demand, got up
some ; perhaps if warming pans or skates had been recom-
mended they would have imported a case to order. But
umbrellas being so useful in this climate caused no loss to
them, and judging by the number about, the sale must
have been going on ever since. Everybody, too, of the
male persuasion, wore puggaries and pyjamas, and nice
smart fellows they looked too on hot days in their snowy
white linen. During my five years’ residence in and around
Maryborough I never heard a sermon preached, or knew a
minister to visit the stations.
The most lively times in Maryborough were when the
Sydney steamers came in, and Captains Knight and Cottier
were visible ashore, or when there was a goodly array of
bullock teams in town with loadings of wool, hides, tallow
and the like, or some false alarm was raised that the blacks
had been “ playing up ” at the station with new chum
“ colonial experience ” men or shepherds. Then everybody
got slightly scared and went to the stores to inspect the
firearms in stock in case we might want some you know.
But an inspection never was followed by purchase. I con-
clude the danger was but momentary and of small import,
all being more frightened than hurt.
I know I was foolishly persuaded into purchasing a Colt’s
revolver from a new-comer, but as it was more likely to kill
me than anyone else, I sold it about ten years afterwards at
the Hanging Rock without having even fired a shot out of
it. Still I always kept it loaded for fear of accidents, and
one day when a blackfellow at Graham’s Creek was


handling it in a spurt of curiosity, he pulled the trigger and
a couple of slugs passing through my hair showed me
the danger I had escaped. The blackfellow’s father,
seeing the accident, “ yabbered ” plenty at his son,
and ended by enforcing his logical argument by knocking him
down with a nulla-nulla as punishment for his carelessness.
I often think, that if it were possible, I should like
to go back to that bygone happy-go-lucky period of 1856,
and be as free from care and anxiety as then. Now-
a-days society is stirred to its foundations with discussing
the best methods to obtain rights and privileges which
justly belong to it, and from which it is unjustly debarred
by Parliament. We heard nothing then of the Gayndah
Railway extension, or that of Pialba either. I don’t think
Pialba was even named, and it probably originated in the
familiar quotation of the aboriginal—“me pialba (tell)
you.” Coal had not been found at Burrum, and a public
meeting to discuss the probability of a bridge at Howard
had not been thought of; nor did we have the least fear of
any kanaka rising, simply because we had no kanakas at
Bundaberg or elsewhere. Our own “darkies” were
sufficient to stir us up and be kept in subjection, and a
show of firearms, with the barrels shown through port holes
cut in the slabs of the hut in this township, was sufficient
to deter them from mischief. Civilization has terribly
altered us, and the presence of “ too much white Mary ” in
silks and satins has spoilt the free and easy style of pastime
which prevailed at our balls and parties in bygone days.
On all sides I hear it asserted that “ modern progress is
making rapid strides.”
Are we improved ? Our universities stand
Temples of learning in this southern land;
Improved! we know all that our fathers knew,
And all their trickery we can better now;
Their vices, not their virtues, we now emulate.
The king no more is “ parent of the State,”
New laws we make, and everything is new,
Excepting sin— here, “ give the devil his due.”
Since he no doubt is ruler of mankind,
And hoodwinks virtue, which is dazed and blind,
Thus, if the modern age is so degenerate,
Let’s try to turn the wavering wheel of Fate,
And a new era by new arts create!
An epoch worthy to be called “ The Great.”
Year follows year into the distant past,
Each in its turn no better than the last.


What a contrast between times past and present
everywhere ! so that Maryborough is not singular in this
respect, and the contemplation of this fact shows the
observer how varied are the transitions and changes of life ;
the men you knew as boys are grown beyond recollection,
and are now fathers of families ; and their sons, in many
instances, hold high and important positions in the com-
munity. I could quote many instances of the men I knew
here in 1856, who now live in their sons. The “old
standards ” have gone down to their graves “ full of years
and honours,” and the sons remain to keep up the family
name with credit. Well do I remember Mr. J. D.
M‘Taggart, pastoralist of Kilkivan, a staunch friend of Hugh
Graham’s, at Maryanna, and many a pleasant chat we had
when he stayed for the night en route to the “Bay,”
as it was usually termed. Mr. Booker, sen., is also a
living example of the type of men we had in the past,
and, though retired from active life, is worthily represented
by his sons. Butchering seems to “ run in the family,” for
from the early fifties the name of Booker, as one of the
honourable fraternity of fleshers, has been associated with
Wide Bay. And a large and important trade he did, too,
with the shippers and steamers then, and, being our only
butcher, had quite a monopoly. And the meat then, which
was always first-class, is, I am glad to find, as well repre-
sented now, and the joints as fat and luscious as heretofore,
when I dined on similar viands at the Royal Hotel. We
had only one baker, Mr. Richard Milner, and as there
were no breweries, he made his own yeast, and, as he
turned out excellent bread, this was in great request,
though he has, I hear, long since joined the silent majority.
“ Old Maryborough,” as it is now called, was even
a place of more importance than our present city, and
when it was first proclaimed a township several allot-
ments of land, minus title deeds, changed hands at good
prices, the trade being then very prosperous, and forming
the nucleus of the fine business worked up by Pettigrew
and Sim, at the Dundathu Sawmills. Sawing was at that
period mostly confined to the crosscut in the scrub by men
of the Furbur stamp. Milner, the baker, and his wife
resided at first at the “ Old Township,” and afterwards
in Maryborough. Having customers in both places, Mrs.


Milner daily delivered bread to them, nor was she deterred
by the hostile appearance of about 800 naked savages,
“ armed to the teeth ” with spears, stone hatchets, mogos
and other weapons, though advised by her friends not to
place herself in their power. But the loaves had to be
delivered, and plucky Mrs. Milner—pistols in belt ready
for use—passed safely through the heart of the savage
crowd, who, awed by her daring, did not molest her.
A few nights after this I was a spectator at a grand corro-
boree on the flat just below the rise on which Cheapside
street is now situated, and at that time surrounded with
dense jungle; the cause of so large a concourse of blacks
being congregated so near the township was due to a visit
from the Dawson and Burnett tribes, and a detachment of
“myalls” from Kolan and Frazer’s Island, who came to
learn the newest corroborees. Generally speaking, our
Maryborough and Wide Bay tribes were very quiet and
harmless, quite the reverse of the cannibals on the coast.
They were also quick learners of all they saw done by
“ whitefellow,” and considered themselves “ smart ” when
dressed in his trousers and shirt with the front side turned
to the back. Some of them were excellent fellows, too,
with fewer vices than virtues, healthy, and of splendid
physique. I remember one aboriginal who stood fully 6ft.
high, and weighed sixteen stone. He had probably been
fattened up at Aldridge’s or IJhr’s boiling-down works ;
there was plenty of “ tucker,” and hospitality prevailed.
Although I studied this curious people and learned their
language and custom, I could never discover that they had
a belief in a Supreme power until so taught by the whites.
Whilst shepherding at Graham’s Four-mile Station I was
somewhat alarmed by a terrific storm of thunder, light-
ning, hail, rain and wind, the velocity of the latter being
recorded as eighty-nine miles an hour. It began early in
the day with light rain, whilst thunder and lightning
warned me shortly after noon to hurry to my hut, and I
had but just got my flock of hoggets into hurdles when the
storm-cloud burst, and the most terrible tempest I have
ever known vented its forces ; trees were torn up by the roots
or snapped off like dry reeds, and all around, above and below
was enveloped in a dense cloud of dust, or whirlwind.
This tornado lasted all night, and I sat up and watched


till daybreak, fully expecting every moment to behold the
hut lifted bodily in the air, and perhaps removed at lightning
speed to the top of the ranges. Dias, my mate, appeared
very frightened at this probable catastrophe, and the
fierceness of the tempest appalled us both. But all was
too dark—inky blackness that could almost be felt outside,
the work of destruction there being only visible by the
flashes of forked lightning which at intervals cast a
lurid glare over the surrounding country. We were glad
when morning dawned, though a scene of devastation and
ruin met the eye far and near. Just below the hut was a
roaring, rushing stream bearing trees and debris on its
bosom. A huge gum tree, one of those veteran monarchs
of the forest which form a prominent landmark among
bush vegetation, had been stricken, and now lay
riven and shivered in splinters in my hurdles. It had
fallen in the night across the fold and killed about fifty
sheep, the slain animals being visible among its branches.
Shortly after sunrise Andrew Puller, accompanied by “ Mr.
Stewart,” a Eurasian, overseer for Graham, rode up and
gave us an outline of the sad tale of devastation by the
storm. It had taken all in its way from Maryborough to
Wetherton, killing sheep, cattle, and even kangaroos en
route . No whites were injured, but eight poor blackfellows
travelling were killed outright, and, judging by the lamen-
tations of their relations, they were very much missed and
deplored for months afterwards. We had fully tw T o days’
work in skinning the slain sheep, and were assisted in this
operation by the “ darkies ” and Puller. Graham’s loss
was about 300 sheep. For a week after the storm every
teamster travelling the Gayndah road carried a crosscut saw
to clear the way, and much time was wasted in drawing off
obstructions in logs and timber from the track. The width
of the country traversed by the storm was about a mile and
the length fully 200 miles. This incident will doubtless
not be forgotten by most of the early residents of Wide
Bay, aboriginal or otherwise.
It was not, however, till the municipality was proclaimed
that Maryborough assumed a popularity and importance it
had not hitherto attained, especially at a distance. Intend-
ing settlers who came from the other colonies were strongly
warned to “ beware how they risked their precious lives


among the savages of Wide Bay,” and to tell the truth
many a “ new chum ” who landed here “ shivered in his
shoes ” at the sight of the naked aborigines, who he fully
expected were waiting to eat him uncooked, without parsley
fixin’s. At first, I was inclined to funk, especially
when on looking at the roof of a hut in which I and my
mates were located, the sight of many dark faces peering
down on us caused a thrill to pass through my frame. But
I got over that ere long, and made many friends even
with these same blackfellows, who succeeded in wheedling
many a bit of “ collongen ” or negrohead tobacco out of me,
or perhaps white feller “ tixpence ” to buy “ tucker,” for
which spell “ rum.” Shortly after the Great Bunyah and
Borah, two popular native customs, in 1857, a monster
gathering of the Burnett and Wide Bay blacks took place
near Six-mile Creek. The crowd, which comprised some
very saucy, rowdy and treacherous “ myalls ” from Frazer’s
Island, were said to be preparing to attack the township
and make a raid on the stores ; but it culminated in
a sort of “free” fight, and the slaughter of about
ten natives. As I passed the next day, and saw the
groups of sable mourners seated on the ground, my sym-
pathies were aroused by the novelty of the scene and the
grief exhibited by the females, who cast ashes on their
heads, and even cut their heads and breasts with sharp
pieces of glass bottles, crooning as if to keep time to their
lamentations. As I observed all this, my ideas ran much
on the poetic aspect of the position, and I sat on a log to
rest, listening to the wailing of some of the weird hags,
who much resembled the witches in Macbeth or a creation
of Bore’s.
The return of torrid weather, absence of rain, and want
of feed for stock reminded me very much of the great
drought from which New South Wales and the “ Moreton
Bay country,” as this part was called, greatly suffered
through the drought of 1858, when prayers were offered
for rain in churches, and a day of humiliation and prayer
was set apart so that all “ miserable sinners,” among whom
were the squatters and members of Parliament, might turn
from the error of their ways and repent in “ ’possum skins
and dust,” alias sackcloth and ashes. ’Twas indeed a
terrible time, and as stock was perishing in all directions, a


fat joint was worth its weight in silver. To remedy this,
stock were travelled from station to station in search of
feed and water, and some flocks and herds seeking pasturage
journeyed as far as New Zealand from the Burnett and
Wide Bay. Still the drought in the latter was not quite as
bad as on the Macintyre and Maranoa, where the stockmen
were kept busy by cutting branches from young trees for
the poor starving brutes in their charge, and even then
whole flocks of sheep and mobs of cattle fell dead by the
wayside. Such a drought had never been remembered
before by the oldest inhabitants of New South Wales, or
Moreton Bay either. Great indeed are the fluctuations of
Nature in these colonies, sad the rain which swept over the
land in those bygone times. Queensland was singularly
free from floods, and it seemed reserved for modern days to
bring about these visitations. Whilst in New South Wales
I was shown flood marks at the tops of high trees; in
Brisbane on the river similar marks were pointed out, and
in the city itself even the offices on the second storey in
Queen-street yet bear these relics of disaster. I could not
help contemplating these signs of misfortune with saddened
feelings :
Drought! Drought! Drought!
The ruin’d settlers vex’t;
O’er Moreton Bay a dire drought lay
And only dust was found one day,
But a flood came down the next.


PART 111.
AROUND MARYBOROUGH.
ARYBOROUGH possesses beauty spots,
|S|S» easy of access, which offer strong induce-
wt m ents to visitors. The Wide Bay
jungles teem with game, and the river
with fish, so that with gun, rod, and line, those inclined
find abundant sport.
When hot weather fairly sets in, there is a general desire
for a seaside holiday engendered in those whose health has
been impaired by unseasonable and erratic weather, and a
large number of visitors from the town and district usually
take up quarters at Pialba for a more or less extended stay.
Numbers of private houses untenanted for months have
been re-opened, and hotels had new life infused into them
by arrival of guests. Vegetation is pleasantly green, and
the delightfully cool breeze from the sea acts as an invigor-
ating tonic to the invalid. Fish and oysters are plentiful,
and numerous bathing places on the beach offer the luxury
of a sea-bath at any state of the tide. The landlord of the
Pialba Hotel, Mr. Albert Lilley, has made many additions
and alterations to the premises. The place has been embel-
lished and improved ; indeed, every comfort may be obtained.
Mr. H. J. Brown, of the Torquay Hotel, has also made
special arrangements for visitors. The town resident can
enjoy a thorough respite at this charming resort. There
are places of interest in the vicinity of Pialba to visit; the
beautiful drive along the Seven-mile Beach to Urangan
Point, where a deep-water port will be established, with
ample accommodation. Several days could be pleasantly
spent in visiting the numerous homesteads and farms
nestled away in the adjoining scrub, and much information
gained as to the resources of the district, which only
requires railway communication to enable the farmers to
reach a market. The homestead of Tooth Bros, on the
Mountain road, three miles from the beach, is worth a visit.


presenting as it does a perfect farm landscape, and showing
.evidence of careful farming. Along this road are numerous
settlers making vigorous onslaughts on the scrub, and in
time the ground will be smiling a harvest of good things,
including sugar. One of the most interesting places is the
selection of Mr. T. A. Bromley, about three miles further,
consisting of fifty acres of rich chocolate soil, which this
energetic gentleman has, mainly with his own hands,
reclaimed from nature, and planted with all sorts of fruit
trees, &c. His attention, however, has been principally
devoted to the cultivation of the coffee plant, and in this
he has succeeded admirably, and deserves a rich recompense
for his years of toil and energy.
Remarkable to state two good hotels were offered for sale
as soon as the railway line from Maryborough was com-
menced. The influx of visitors at our only watering place
should be an incentive to property owners to continue to
provide first-class accommodation for tourists. The opening
of the railway is sure to bring the need of such. Rich
agricultural land extends along both banks of the Mary
River beyond the head of navigation, and even above
Gympie. South of Maryborough is the Noosa district,
famed for timber, scenery, and sport, and its large fresh
water lakes, discovered by Lieutenant Bligh, named
Cooroiba, Wyba, Coolala, Como, Illandra, and Cootharaba.
The route to Pialba, 28 miles from Maryborough, passes
through open forest of gums and other woods, intersected
by belts of thick scrub, and rich agricultural land.
Fraser’s Island
Is a spot worth visiting. The island was named from
Captain Fraser, of the ship Stirling Castle, who was
murdered there with his crew in 1888 by savages. Fraser’s
Island is about 70 miles long by 14 broad, and three miles
at the narrowest part, the head of Platypus Bay. Breaksea
Spit runs out 19 miles from the land. Vessels enter inward
between Inskip and Hood Points, and, after reaching the
mouth of the Mary, 28 miles, follow the river up to the
township. Tincan Bay, famed for bivalves and timber,
runs 18 miles into the mainland. The scenery is fine and
diversified by farms and plantations, till Maryborough is
reached. The Mary River has a number of native names,

“ Mooroboocla,” “ Moonooboola,” “ Goodna,” “ Yahboon,”
“ Coroon,” and “ Gooroomandoon,” the latter meaning
kangaroo ground. Sandy Cape is called “ Caree,” the
main island “ Moonbi ” and “ Talboor,” Big Woody Island
“ Tooleewa ” and “ Unloo,” Little Woody, “ Gneer.” The
Mary Elver tribes are the “ Mangeburra ” ; those of
Fraser’s Island, the “ Doondooras.” Both tribes had an
evil reputation. In 1850 the aborigines of Fraser’s Island
were computed at 8,000 ; the survivors now number less
than 800, and are quiet and civilized. White Clifts is the
quarantine station, but is not often in use. The State
Forest Nursery, established here by the Government, has
some beautiful pines, but, strange to say, Fraser’s Island is
generally unsuited for their growth.
The Mary Eiver is navigable for vessels drawing 10 feet as
far as Yengarie, 9 miles above Maryborough, and for vessels
drawing 7 feet, 20 miles further. The northern extremity
of Fraser’s Island has always enjoyed notoriety for perils
to navigation in that vicinity. Sandy Cape is prolonged
under the sea as a long and treacherous shoal, and Break-
sea Spit, in like manner, has strong and perplexing
currents. The erection of a lighthouse 90 feet high at
Sandy Cape has reduced dangers, and vessels occasionally
double the Spit in boisterous weather rather than attempt
the Wide Bay Bar. This lighthouse shows a dioptric light
of the first order, visible about 30 miles. The keepers
with their families are the only settled community on the
island, and there is a State school attended by about 80
children. An irregular aboriginal staff attached to the
establishment proves useful in landing stores and other
work. These natives find abundant food on the island,
which produces two or three varieties of zamia and cycas,
with the pandamus or “ bread fruit,” and numerous bulbi-
ferous edible plants, whilst the neighbouring waters swarm
with mullet, oysters, crabs, and dugong, with the
herbivorous pachyderm , peculiar to Northern Australia,
which, by reason of its oil, is valued medicinally, and the
meat and bacon are readily sought as delicacies by the
epicure. Whales are not infrequently stranded here, and
it is on record that more than one monster of 60 feet long
has been captured on the coast of Hervey’s Bay. Fraser’s
Island was for about three years the site of an aboriginal


mission under the Rev. E. Fuller, whose missionary efforts
were not successful, and the mission was ultimately
abandoned, its site being now pointed out at the mouth of
a running stream, opposite to the Mary River Heads.
Southward are the White Cliffs, a favourite excursion
ground, where the sandy material of the island occurs in a
more compact shape, and forms a kind of soft stone, worn
by tides and currents, into a line of steep escarpments at
the foot of which is excellent sea bathing. In addition to
the lighthouse on Sandy Cape, there is one on Woody
Island, inside Hervey’s Bay, and another on Lady Elliot’s
Island, about 40 miles to the north-west of the Cape.
OUR RAILWAYS.
The opening of the railway from Childers to Cordalba
was the occasion of an imposing public demonstration on
June Ist, 1896. A special train brought the Ministerial
party and many representative men on the scene, and the
Hon. R. Philp, Minister for Railways, performed the cere-
mony. Speeches were made and promises given of future
extensions. The track is thus described:—From Childers
the new line has many abrupt chain curves, embankments
and cuttings. It was an intensely pleasant ride for the
excursionists ; the weather delightful, the atmosphere clear
and the colour soft, and as the train speeds on an ever-
varying panorama of beautiful landscape sweeps past the
vision, and everywhere present was the luxuriant green of
the canefields. Now it appears in sloping hillsides, anon in
expansive meadows, here fringed with a feather of pine
trees, there contrasted around an island of standing scrub.
Frequently the cane billows up against the cars on either
hand, and then the scene is shut out as the train speeds
between the converging terra-cotta coloured banks of a
20ft. or 80ft. cutting. It was a wonderful sight to many,
and yet only a glimpse of the Isis sugar lands. Before the
eye accustomed itself to the beauty, the sight of canefields
is suddenly shut out, the train pulls up at a very new station
platform, and in the midst of the surrounding shadows of a
thick scrub Cordalba is reached. Cordalba is a small scrub


clearing, and contains two hotels, two stores, public hall,
and station buildings. Surrounded by fine sugar-growing
country, there is no doubt its prosperity will be ensured.
The growth of tea, coffee, rice and other products is
projected.
The Pialba Railway.
The Railway Commissioner’s report of the useful
branch line from Colton (Maryborough to Bundaberg rail-
way) to Pialba says :—This branch commences at 171 miles
74 chains from Brisbane, a little beyond Colton, a former
stopping place on the North Coast line, and turning to the
right takes a very direct north-easterly course for about 12
miles, when it meets the main road from Maryborough to
Pialba. From this point to 14 miles the same general
course is preserved, but several minor bends are introduced
to avoid heavy earthworks on the slopes of a high ridge
running parallel to the coast, the summit of which is crossed
at 18£ miles. From 14 miles the line runs alongside a,
road in an easterly direction for about a mile, a bend is
thence made to the left and keeping in a northerly course
the terminus is reached close to Hervey Bay, about the
most central part of Pialba, 16 miles 47 chains from the
junction. The first 11 miles of the route run through
barren country; the soil thence improves, scrub lands being
traversed from miles to within half a-mile of the
terminus. A considerable amount of farming is carried on
at Pialba, principally in the growing of sugarcane, which is
certain to be very largely increased as soon as railway
communication is established. The principal railway
receipts will, for a time at least, be derived from the pas-
senger traffic to and from the coast, Pialba being a favourite
watering place. Owing to the broken nature of the ground
on the latter portion of the line, there will be a considerable
quantity of earthwork, and the expenditure for drains and
culverts, in consequence of the high banks, will be com-
paratively large. On the first few miles of the route a good
deal of bridge work will be necessary to provide for the
passage of flood water on the flat country traversed. The
width of formation will be 14ft., and the permanent way
laid with 41flb. rails having 2,200 sleepers, and 1,100
cubic yards of ballast per mile. The ruling gradient is 1
in 50, although, in order to reduce the cost of construction


as much as possible, some short lengths of 1 in 40 and 1
in 44 have been used ; the weight of trains will not, how-
ever, be affected thereby. Fencing will be erected only
where the line runs through private property, and all road
crossings will be on the level and open, being protected by
cattle grids. The station at Pialba is the only one shown
on the plan, but a stopping place will probably be necessary
at Aarlberg (about 12 miles BO chains), and when traffic
warrants it one or two cane sidings between this point and
the terminus. The minimum width of land proposed to be
resumed is 1 chain, but as two-thirds of the route is
through Crown lands, about 48 acres of private land only
will be required ; much of this is at present unimproved,
and as the railway will undoubtedly increase the value of
freehold property in the district, the compensation should
not be great. Including a reasonable sum for compensation
for land to be resumed, but exclusive of rolling stock and
surveys, the cost of the branch is estimated at £48,500
(equal to £2,622 per mile), and the annual charge for
interest at 4 per cent, will amount to £1,740. This line is
to be constructed under the provisions of the Railways
Guarantee Act of 1895, and, as far as I have been able to
ascertain, the probable traffic will from the beginning be
almost, if not quite, sufficient to defray the cost of working
and the interest charge, the two items being equal to, say,
£8,750 per annum.
Tenders for the construction of the above line of railway
were opened on March 81st, 1895, from the following con-
tractors :—Messrs. Fountain Bros., Jas. Overend, G. C.
Wilcocks, Baxter and Boyd, Ahern and Patterson, Vallely
and Bowser, McArdle and Thompson, Baxter and Saddler,
Murphy and Hopkins, Kirk Bros, and Frew. The last
mentioned were lowest at £25,144.
Gayndah Railway.
Report from Mr. J. Harvey, Woowoonga, dated June 18,
1896, states that he made a personal survey of the route
already surveyed. Mr. Lethem, surveyor, has charge of
the railway survey, and the permanent survey begins at the
end of the existing railway at 45 miles 48 chains. At 46
miles 14 chains one mile Oakey Creek is crossed, where a
small timber bridge will be required; at 46 miles 50 chains


the survey crosses a big gully, also necessitating a bridge.
From the commencement of the survey to 47-mile peg the
earthwork will not be heavy. The line up to 47 miles 56
chains runs between country which is all selected. At 47
miles 56 chains the line goes through Degilbo lease, and on
to Deep Creek, which is reached at 49 miles 50 chains
over very flat country. Where the line crosses Deep Creek
the country is somewhat rough, and an iron bridge will be
required to reach from bank to bank, at an elevation of
about perhaps 100 feet. At 50 miles 40 chains Black Gin
Creek is crossed (the country between the two creeks being
open undulating country, well suited, when thrown open,
for agriculture), and will necessitate a lengthy bridge of
iron or wood; and about here would be located the station
for Mount Shamrock. From here the survey runs through
some rough country, necessitating curves and cuttings till
the 52-mile 2 chain peg is reached, and which is at present
the end of the permanent survey, 6J miles from the com-
mencement. From here on trial lines have for a few miles
been run, but no work of a permanent character done. The
survey party shifted camp from Mount Shamrock to Didcot
Creek. I believe the survey was commenced in the third
week in March. From the commencement (45 miles 43
chains) to 48 miles the work was already completed, and
only needed the old blaze marks being re-opened and the
pegs painted ; this reduces the actual survey work to about
li miles per month. While 36 miles to go to Gayndah, at
the same rate of progress it will be July, 1898, before the
survey is completed.
The construction of the two most important railway
extensions in these districts, the Colton-Pialba and Charle-
ville to Cunnamulla are rapidly progressing—the latter will
be 61 miles in length and the former 17 miles. The con-
tract for the first section was secured by Mr. G. C. Wilcocks
at £67,686, and the tender for the Colton-Pialba for
£25,144 by McArdle and Thompson.
Among railway excursions none better enable the traveller
to “ see the country ” than by the line from Maryborough
to Gympie and Brisbane. The distance to Gympie is 61
miles. The contract for the line was accepted in August,
1877 ; the work completed, and opened on August 6th, 1881.
The most attractive scenery en route is in the neighbourhood

of Tiaro and Mount Bopple, where the line runs nearly
parallel with the Mary River, crossing it at the Antigua
bridge. Level country and poor soil, timbered with blood-
wood, oak, turpentine, spotted gum, and eucalyptus abound.
On Yengarie Creek is the celebrated refinery about a quarter
of a mile distant, near the Mary River. At Mungarr
Junction a branch line goes to Gayndah, Mungarr, abori-
ginal for spotted gum, or, may it not have originally been
“ Mulgarr ” (tattoo marks) —who knows ? Mungarr has an
hotel, sawmills and school, with an attendance of about 60
children. Tiaro, next reached, is 22 miles from Mary-
borough, at the head of tidal waters. John Eaton was the
first settler in 1864, when the site was cut up into allot-
ments for a township. As the road to Gympie passed
directly through, things were kept lively there for years
after the first rush. It is surrounded by an extensive
farming and timber-getting district, and is the depot for
antimony and plumbago mines. The public school has an
attendance of about 150 children. Owanyilla, once head-
quarters of the native police, is five miles from Tiaro on the
road. Native name, “ Wanya.” Passing Kooringa, Bopple
is reached, the mountain so named from its being the home
of the frilled lizard. It was here that Davis or Duramboi
lived. After Bopple, Goondiah (or good-bye) half-way to
Gympie is passed. Here is a large sawmill in the midst of well-
timbered country. Two miles further is Gootchie (iguana),
next Kanyan and Kilkivan Junction, in the midst of hoop-pine
scrub. Kilkivan lies off at about 26 miles distance, where
refreshments can be obtained; thence to Gympie, the
golden city. From Gympie to Landsborough and Brisbane
the trip is more romantic by reason of greater diversity of
scenery. The total distance is 115 miles and 28 chains,
and this part of the line was opened on June 11,1888 ; thus
connecting Brisbane with Gympie, Maryborough, and a
large extent of northern country. The line runs parallel
with the sea-coast nearly the whole distance, and its close
proximity to salt water accounts for the barren appearance
of much of the land traversed. Leaving the Sandgate
Junction it passes through a forest of blue and grey gums,
bloodwood, ti-tree, and casuarinas to Bald Hills, where
agricultural progress forms a pleasing aspect. Ridges
timbered by box, ironbark, gum, stringy bark, and forest


oak appear, supervening on a long stretch of dwarf grass
tree and ti-tree flats. Caboolture, on a creek of that name,
is a farming district, but the town is almost hidden from
view. Official guidebooks state that “it was at Caboolture
Creek Mr. Geo. Raff started the first sugar plantation in
the colony, and that a large timber trade is done in the
locality.” From Caboolture to Beerburrum are grass-tree
and ti-tree flats and sandy clay ridges. Beerburrum Station
is an unpretentious place in the wilderness, and among
some of the most remarkable scenery in Queensland. The
“ Glass Mountains,” as they are called, once seen will never be
forgotten by lovers of romantic nature. Discovered by
Captain Cook, and named by him in 1770, they form appro-
priate land marks for navigators. Flinders, who anchored
in Moreton Bay in July, 1799, was probably the next to
discover them, and they so attracted his curiosity that he
went ashore with a party of seamen to explore a road to
them, but meeting with hostile natives, after a somewhat
serious conflict he was compelled to return without accom-
plishing his object. It was Flinders who named “ Bribie
Island ” and the Pumice Stone River. The Glass Mountains
vary in height from Beerburrum, 920 feet, to Coonowrin (or
Crooked Neck), 1160 feet, and Beerwah, 1760 feet. Stand-
ing in forest country of bloodwood gum and ironbark, they
cannot but impress the traveller with their weird majesty
and commanding presence. Geologically they belong to the
Upper Cretaceous formation similar to the Desert sandstone
of the west, and they are in reality gigantic masses of
Desert sandstone rising abruptly from a level base, each in
gloomy isolation, silent and alone. A recent tourist thus
describes them :—“ One mighty mass of rock stands facing
the railway line, cliff-fronted, savage, defiant, towering
majestically into the clear blue sky, the wild rough stone
face, scarred and caverned by the rains and tempests of ten
thousand years. Through the tree-tops you behold tran-
sitory gleams of Beerwah’s lone companions, enormous
precipices forming sudden termini of ascending spurs, or
vast pillars of rock and broken columns, standing there as
ruined fragments surviving the merciless wreck of “gray
annihilation,” looking out far over the tree-tops upon the
vast ocean beyond, unspeakably weird in their mournful
solitude, unutterably sad in their voiceless silence. So they


stand there, as Cook saw them from off Cape Moreton 120
years ago, as Flinders saw them 91 years back, as the wild
sons of the pathless woods beheld them far back in dim
centuries of times buried in oblivion, and as the stars alone
shall see them far hence. The wild savages of the locality
have only bequeathed us their names—Beerwah, Beer-
burrum, Coonowrin, Toomboomboodlum, Teeborcacan, and
Makateeboomalgri!”
GYMPIE,
which comprises three distinct portions, viz., Gympie proper,
One Mile, and Monkland, is 56 miles south of Maryborough,
and 126 miles from Brisbane. Is situated on a sharp curve
of the Mary River, and is one of the most important mining
towns in Queensland, and is situated in latitude 26deg. 12
min. south, and longitude 152deg. BBmin. east. The name
Gympie is the aboriginal term for stinging nettle tree.
Like ancient Rome, it stands on seven picturesque hills,
named respectively Surface, O’Connell, Commissioner,
Calton, Caledonian, Palatine, and Red Hill. Its population
by last census was about 10,000, with 4,000 more in the
district. The municipal area is 2,500 acres. Gympie is
one of the healthiest towns in the Wide Bay district and
an excellent place to live in, the people being courteous, the
necessaries of life cheap, whilst nearly everyone is on the
qui vive in expectancy of new auriferous ground being
opened in which fickle Fortune has too long had her golden
treasure. Geologically, the “ Gympie Beds” belong to the
Lower Carboniferous, a metamorphosed portion of the Car-
bonifero-Permian, with Devonian and Serpentine merging
into granite and slates. Governor Blackall visited Gympie
in 1869, and Governor Normanby in April, 1875. Notwith-
standing numerous improvements, Gympie remains yet a
place of hills and hollows. By day the prospect of isolated
hills and ranges cannot but please the visitor in search of
natural history. Above the town agricultural settlement
and farming extends, and the settlers generally report
favourably as to crops. But Gympie, as is well-known,
owes its origin entirely to gold, and on this metal and its


rich reefs the prosperity of the place depends. Rumours
are afloat as to the first discoverer of gold there, but the
honor is generally conceded to Nash, who in 1867, brought
to Maryborough specimens he had unearthed, and awoke
the people of “ Sleepy Hollow,” as some call it, from slum-
bering to life and action. The following particulars on this
matter supplied by Mr. A. Meston and Mr. R. J. Denman,
Grown Lands Ranger at Maryborough, who was cutting
timber at Uniahma Creek, a tributary of the Mary, in
September, 1867, will be read with interest :
“ His boy came into his camp and reported the arrival
of a man who was enquiring the way to Widgee. Denman
bade the boy tell the man to turn out his horse and partake
of tea with him. The stranger under enquiry said his
name was Nash, and that he had missed his way. Den-
man, who was an old miner, was well acquainted with
Widgee, and had prospected and found likely-looking
auriferous country there. As Denman could not then
avail himself of this, he decided to tell Nash about it, and
gave him a letter to a friend, Henry Best, at Traviston
Station, with instructions to put Nash on the track for
Widgee by a marked tree line, Nash agreed, if he found
anything good, to share it with Denman, but after meeting
with success in the gully, which bears his name, evidently
forgot all about it.”
Mr. Nash thus describes how he found the first gold:—
“ I intended to prospect along the track as far as Mary-
borough, as I had done all the way from Nanango, and if I
got nothing to go to Gin Gin, and if unsuccessful there to
visit the Calliope. I arrived at Traviston that day, and was
put on the track by Mr. Best. Crossing the creek which
bears my name, I saw a likely-looking gully, with water
about 15 yards of, so decided to try a prospect. The first
dish went a few grains, and the second a little better.
Encouraged by this I unpacked the horse and set to work ;
result for that afternoon about 10 dwts. By next evening
I had got an ounce and five pennyweights of gold. After
supper I set out for Maryborough and there sold the gold
to Mr. Southerden. I returned to Nash’s Creek alone, and
worked there for six days, obtaining in that time 62 ounces
of gold. I then went to Maryborough enroute to Brisbane,
where I arrived by steamer, and sold my gold to Flavelle


Bros. Mr. Walsh, the member, was in the shop, and, on
his enquiring where the gold came from, I replied, ‘up
North.’ I returned to Maryborough taking with me a
horse and cart, and reported the find October 16, 1867.”*
In the first eight years Gympie produced 545,0000z. of
gold, and up to 1887 a total of 1,824,0000z. The alluvial
failed in 1868, and gave way to hundreds of reefing claims.
The first quartz reef, the Lady Mary, was discovered in
Sailor’s Gully, by Pollock and Lawrence, November Bth,
1867. Gympie newspaper enterprise is represented by the
Times and Miner , both well conducted and spirited journals.
As it is well to hear various opinions on this subject, I
here give those of Mr. J. J. T. Barnett, an old resident,
who thus records his personal experiences :
EARLY RECOLLECTIONS.
The First on Gympie Gold.
In the year 1865 start was made from the Mary River—
near Owanyilla—by three teams of bullocks, the first being
driven by the owner of all the teams, the second by a man
who was termed a “whitewashed” Yankee named Mick,
and a scoundrel at that. The third team was in charge of
the very capable bullock “ puncher ” and “ white ” black-
boy, Johnny Walker, son of an old warrior, Peter, king of
Tiaro. The horses and spare bullocks were in charge of
Johnny Walker’s gin, Maggie, and I went to get colonial
experience, and got it, too. William Casbrook Giles, the
owner of the teams, once manager of Widgee Widgee
Station, and later landlord of the Royal Hotel, Mary-
borough, had decided to take the teams to Toowoomba for
sale, hence the trip undertaken. How we crawled along
the track to Gutchy, where we saw old Andrew Puller with
his black Maria, need not be dilated on. There we went to
Curra, seeing none on the way until we met, near the latter
place, the late Mr. Denman coming down the river, driving
a bullock team, heavily laden with log cedar, from the heads
of the Mary River. Twelve miles beyond Curra we came
to very rugged country, and camped on a gully, which the
*Note. — Mr. Nash is still located at Gympie, where he has charge
of the local government powder magazine. He recently contra-
dicted Meston’s and Denman’s statements in the Press.


track to Traveston, we were following, crossed. Having let
go the tired bullocks, Giles look towel and soap, and went
to the gully to wash. He shortly returned, bringing in his
hand a piece of quartz, about the size of a hen’s egg, and
sticking in it lumps of bright yellow metal. This metal
Giles (who had been on the Victorian goldfields in the old
fifties)), said was “ gold, and no mistake about it.” Giles
said he would form a prospecting party on reaching
Toowoomba, but he forgot it all, and gold then had no
attractions for Stanton, Johnny Walker or myself. Fancy,
reader, how often since I have thought of the night when
we camped on Nash’s Gully, not knowing or caring ought of
the shining heavy nuggets, or glittering fine gold lying
under our feet in thousands of ounces. But in those days
I knew nothing of gold mining. Had it grown on trees I
might have plucked it, but to dig it up like potatoes I would
not. B} a strange coincidence, I had another chance of
making a ‘ pile’ at the same spot after a lapse of nearly two
years, but did not avail myself of it. Having slowly wended
our way to Toowoomba, the teams were put up to auction
by the late Mr. Robinson, but remaining unsold, Giles put
them to work at Peechey and Deigan’s sawmills, out at
Highfields, 25 miles from Toowoomba, and left me to look
after the drivers, as road manager. Giles returned by
Ipswich and Brisbane to Maryborough, and Johnny Walker
and his gin walked back to Maryborough. Two new drivers
were engaged to drive two of the teams, while Mick Stanton
remained driver of the third. The teams were all dis-
posed of later on to Mr. Peechey. After about two years
sojourning in the districts of Dalby, Roma, up the Maranoa,
down to Ipswich, I heard of the Gympie rush, and hastened
back to Maryborough, by Brisbane, at which latter town I
met Giles, who, being indebted to me, offered me one of ten
claims on Gympie which he said he and a party held. But
I was not a miner, and had no wish to become one. It was
far too serious an occupation for a young fellow of eighteen,
as fond of roving as I had become. At this time of mature
age and serious reflection, such chances would not be
allowed to pass without my dipping my hands in the lucky
bag. I reached Gympie about a month after it was dis-
covered, and opened up. Fancy what a change had come
over the wild forest where we had camped two years before.


Then the old man kangaroo would hop away and look with
astonishment at intruders, while now all was life. The
ringing of the picks in search of the precious metal, the
rock, rock of many cradles, while the small clear stream of
old days was now a muddy, milky ditch, many upheavals
showing where search for gold had been and was being
made. I found that all Giles’s claims had been jumped,
owing to his greed in trying to hold too much ground.
Referring to a plan he had given me, I found the claim he
offered me. It was being vigorously worked, and was
almost exactly where we camped two years before. I was
informed some time after that it gave to its owners no less
than £16,000 worth of alluvial gold. Thus had I twice
missed an opportunity of becoming a lucky miner. In my
humble opinion William Cashrook Giles was the first white
man to pick up gold on the now far-famed Gympie goldfield.
The only pity is that he and his party of travellers did not
benefit by his discovery.”
OUR AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
Are of wonderful extent, and it can be readily understood
that if they were awarded justice the return here would be
materially increased, and many articles of commerce largely
imported would find a place among our exports. A
reference to those paying duty to this port opens up a wide
field for the speculative imagination of the farmer, and it is
estimated that if there were a larger consumption of local
products fully £BO,OOO a year would be saved.
The farmed lands of the Wide Bay and Burnett districts
are showing satisfactory results, aided materially by that
enthusiastic spirits that pervades the Maryborough Agricul-
tural Society, which affords every facility for the exhibition
of local products, and awards prizes and honours to suc-
cessful competitors.
As the prosperity of a country depends on the stability
of its foundations, so its staple industries contribute to its
advancement. In and round Maryborough local prosperity
is enhanced by such factors as gold and coal-mining, sugar-
growing, fruit culture, farm and dairy produce, and others.


Some important industries, those on which we depended in
bygone days, are much in the minority, and the timber
trade, once a leading line, is now but little in evidence.
Cotton-growing, another industry, once gave signs of
becoming a leading product, whilst maize was also very
much in demand. With all the facilities afforded by this
glorious country for dairy farming, good butter, cheese,
bacon, and the like are almost unobtainable. The Burnett
and Wide Bay districts have been so long closely connected
in interests, that what affects one cannot but affect the
other. But it is to an extension of railways, especially
those passing through local centres, that we look for
progress. The construction of the Gayndah line is now
an established fact, and when this is open, we hope for
rapid strides of progress in the Wide Bay district. With
all our progress, we are still in the infancy of advancement,
the great storehouse of Nature’s wealth still awaits the
hand of the husbandman, the gold-seeker, and the agricul-
turist to unlock and partake.
# To show some of the difficulties which beset the early
pioneers in forcing their way through the vast jungles of
this district, I give the following extracts from the dairy of
a squatter in 1840. The party travelled across the Darling
Downs, and reached the Burnett District about three weeks
from starting :
Jan. 12, 1840.—Followed cattle track; supposed to lead
to watercourse; deceived in the “lay” of the country;
blackfellows’ marks on trees ; deserted camps ; no water.
Jan. 16.—Reached dense jungle on 13th; cleared our
way inch by inch; scrub follows the ranges, but in conse-
quence of precipices could not continue our course. Got
clear of range after beating about three days.
Jan. 17.—Reached a watercourse, which followed, brought
us to river full of rocky bars ; must be the Burnett; believe
we are the first Europeans here ; black boy Bob shot some
ducks; a very acceptable change from salt beef.
Jan. 18.—Small plains, more level country ; scrub all
round ; looks like paddocks formed by nature ; fine country ;
open across river ; jungle dense our side ; short of pro-
visions ; dinner, iguanas and opossums. What would my
folks in London say to this ?


Jan . 19 and 20.—Attacked last night by blacks ; used
our arms and ammunition freely, and drove off the enemy;
John Williams, my right hand man, speared in side ; bad
wound.
Jan. 21.—Poor John’s wound pains greatly; no help;
weather hot; no water ; short of provisions.
Jan. 22.—Williams died last night; raved for water;
buiied the body near the spur of a range, which I named
M‘Allister’s Bluff; it is a tall and prominent landmark and
should be easily found by those who came after us.
Thus day by day did this heroic party travel on, bearing
up against hardships and suffering, and at last reaching the
broad lands they sought when their stock in charge of
experienced stockriders had come by an easier route, but
with almost as many hardships to be encountered. Horses
had been killed for food, and a blackboy of the party had
been their mainstay in getting food.
1 can but sing in mournful strain,
As I recall the bygone years,
Of those we ne’er shall meet again,
The lost and well lov’d pioneers.
They mark’d the track, they broke the soil,
They shar’d our mingled hopes and fears,
’Mid nights of peril, days of toil,
Those dauntless, good old pioneers !
By Mary’s stream old scenes I trace,
Whilst memory brings up soul-felt tears,
For whom Time can ne’er efface,
Our dear, our brave, old pioneers !
PASTORAL.
The pastoral season of 1895-6 was, if possible, worse
than its predecessors—the country in various directions
being in a terrible state through want of rain ; cattle and
sheep dying in large numbers. The mortality in stock
fortunately received a check through heavy and acceptable
rains which afterwards fell all over the Burnett and Wide
Bay districts.
At a Government land sale in Maryborough in April a
10-acre block at Biggenden realised £2O, and 40 acres near
Howard £4O. People in search of a homestead or farm


need have no difficulty in securing suitable land in all parts
of the Wide Bay and Burnett districts. Upset price of £1
per acre prevail. It is gratifying to find that the “ tick pest”
which seriously affected other districts is unknown in the
Burnett and Wide Bay districts nor does phylloxera affect
the grape vines as it does “ down south.” The Stafford-
shire (Eng.) Agricultural Society applied gas-lime to land
infested with insect pests with good results, and exter-
minated wire worms, &c.
Looking over a gazetteer of stock and station holders or
pastoralists, dated 1890, I was astonished to find the
changes which had taken place in ownership of those in the
Wide Bay and Burnett districts. Here are a few stations
familiar to me in 1856 :—J. T. Atherton, Miva, Burnett;
Thos. Bailey, Canindah, Mt. Perry—he also owned Old
Canindah, in the same district; W. Bates, Bompa, Wide
Bay ; R. 0. Barton, Toweran ; Barton Bros., Moolboolaman,
Wide Bay; Bank New South Wales, Imbil, Wide Bay;
Broadbent and Williams, Widgee Widgee (Walsh was there
when I last visited it); Broadbent, Mondure (formerly Capt.
W. O’Connell); Brown and Johnstone, Colanne, Wide
Bay; T. Broom, Agnes Yale, Wide Bay; N. W. Brown,
Barolin, Bundaberg; J. J. Cadell, Iderawa, Burnett; A. J.
Calan, Elana, Leichhardt; H. D. Caswell, Teningering ;
J. Cox, Rawbelle ; J. G. W. Cox, Eureka, Burnett; Arthur
Dight, Yendah, Burnett; Cornwell and Ezzy, Tahiti, Wide
Bay; J. Deschamps, Waroo, Gin Gin; Goldsbrough and
Harden, Auburn, Gayndah; W. 0. Gilchrist, Kolongo,
Wide Bay; W. H. Gaden, Molangool, Wide Bay; R.
Hamilton, Culrossie, Burnett; W. Hay, Tewantin ; Hender-
son and Moore, Tantitha, Bundaberg; George Hooper,
Hawkewood, Burnett; Hughes, Shand and Co., Wombah,
Wide Bay; T. F. Humphrey, Mt. Debatable ; F. J. Ivory,
Eidsvold; E. B. Lenne, Branyan, Bundaberg; H. St.
John, Ban Ban; W'. J. Johnson, Waroo, Gin Gin; A. and
A. Johnstone, Walla, Wide Bay; D. M. Jones, Bonara,
Burnett; Joyce and Gill, Lochaber; Kelly and Mactaggart,
Glenbarr, Burnett; E. Knox, Mundaburra, Gayndah ; Knox
and Rutledge, Cunnamulla; Knox and Stephen, Kolan;
Mrs. Lawless, Boobygan, Burnett; Mant and Littleton,
Gigoomgan, Wide Bay; J. B. Lloyd and Co., Maryborough
and Burnett; G. H. Lloyd, Redbank; H. Missing, Gootchy ;


Littlejohn and Alfred, Taabinga; M. Mellor, Gympie; A.
W. Melville, Doongall; Isaac Moore, Tantitha; Moore
Bros, and Baynes, Baramba ; B. B. and S. Moreton,
Wetheron ; M‘Kay and Caswell, Canindah ; J. F. M‘Mullen,
Tarong; T. MTlwraith, Gin Gin; M‘Kenzie and Halt,
Cotherstone; Executors D. Mactaggart, Kilkivan, Yabba,
Queensland National Bank; T. Province, Bannia and
Roslyn, Mt. Perry; J. S. Powell, Lower Doongal; T.
Powell, Traveston, Gympie; G. Sinclair, Knockbreak;
Shaw and Co., Eawbelle, Shand and Buchanan, Wombah ;
Rutledge and Palmer, Eureka; R. B. and J. C. Ridler,
Cania and Yarrol; T. Ross, Kilkivan; T. Robertson,
Bingera. Such are a few of the stations which I knew in
bygone days, but how few of the original owners remain!
Change, change everywhere, and not always for the best.
The hospitality for which stations of Wide Bay and the
Burnett were once famous has long departed, the fluctuations
of trade, losses, crosses and disasters are the true causes for
a less lavish show of hospitality to all callers than hereto-
fore. Leaving Gayndah, you reach Mt. Debatable, where
of yore Mrs. Green had her dairy station. Dugald Graham’s
Wigton Station passed into H. E. Tidswell’s hands, whilst
Mondure—once Capt. W. O’Connell’s—is now Broadbents’
and the O’Connell’s name is not much heard in the Burnett
as of yore. When I was last at Mondure the mustering
was on, and a good collection of stock had gone from
Baramba, Widgee Widgee, and stations round. All passed
off well, save for one accident, whereby poor Jamie Brown
lost his life, being killed at the yards. He had been
married but a year, and left a widow, but no family. The
forlorn wife’s thoughts at the sad event are here depicted
in verse: —
KILLED AT THE YAEDS.
Ye stockmen who come from the mustering to-day,
Have ye seen my dear Jamie returning this way?
Is he left with the cattle ye drove to the yard,
Or over the stragglers just keeping safe guard ?
I wait for your answer, but none can I hear,
Your faces are pallid, your looks bespeak fear
And I wait in suspense, with a tear in my eye,
No reply greets my ears. Ah, wretched am I !


Oh tell me the truth though I know it, and guess
That you’d fain delay what will cause me distress ;
I’ve heard your strange whispers, so end this suspense—
My “ Jamie was killed at the old stockyard fence ! ”
Oh try not to keep me, for here I can’t stay,
Last year a glad bride, and a widow to-day ;
I think not of dress as I rush on my hat,
And speed swift to seek Jamie dead on the flat!
With a wound on his brow, see the poor fellow lies,
A fixed stare is seen in his large glassy eyes ;
His horse neighs with joy whilst gazing around,
Near the master he loved, now dead on the ground.
His mates gather round me, and sadly regard
The corpse of their mate who lies by the yard;
Impressive the scene, as in silence and gloom
They bear my poor Jamie’s remains to his tomb.
’Tis full thirty years since that direful day,
Yet the mem’ry of Jamie has not passed away ;
And oft at Mondure the old stockmen relate
How Jamie just after New Year met his fate.
Doubtless if the records of the Wide Bay District were
ransacked, there are hundreds of cases similar to that of
poor Jamie, who, reckless riders after stock, met as sad a
fate.

Deoilbo. —First occupied by W. H. Walsh in 1847, sub-
sequently possessed by D. and H. Perrier ; next by Griffiths,
Faning and Co.; then by Messrs. Single and Sly, Degilbo
is situated on the creek of which it bears the name, a small
tributary of the Burnett River. Distant from Gayndah
30 miles, and equi-distant between that town and Mary-
borough. It has always been a favourite “house of call”
for travellers. As a deal of land has been thrown open for
selection and occupied, the agricultural interests will be in
the ascendant in the near future.

Station Property, Wide Bay and Burnett Districts.
Holders and-Pioneer Settlers, from 1850 to 1896.
Burrandowan. —The first station occupied in the Burnett
district by H. S. Russell, and afterwards taken by Philip
Friel and G. Sandeman ; later on by Towns and Co.; 80
miles from Gayndah, on the head of the Boyne River;
Several shepherds and hutkeepers killed here in 1855.
Boondooma. —Explored and occupied by Lawson Bros.,
from 1846 to 1850, when it fell into the hands of Gilchrist,
Watt and Co.; situate about 80 miles from Gayndah, on
the Boyne and Burnett rivers; blacks were very hostile
here for some time, and several murders committed.
Cooranga. —Twenty miles from Gayndah on the Boyne
River; taken up by the Messrs. Strathdee in 1848, and
remained for years in their possession, and, notwithstanding
hostile blacks and bad seasons, kept its name as a good
station property.
Toondomananinjy. —Forty miles from Gayndah, and lies
on the creek of that name ; it is intersected by Cadarga
Creek, which forms part of the run ; first occupied in
1848 by Strathdee, and associated with their Cooranga
property; it afterwards passed into the hands of J. M.
Plummer, Jno. Sydney, and Travis and Co.
Mundahurra. —Discovered and occupied by H. P. Bou-
verie, in 1848 ; passed on to Perkins and Netterfield ; then
by Knox and McCord ; situate on the Boyne and Burnett
rivers ; 80 miles from Gayndah.
Wigton and Erabangah. —First occupied in 1849 by
Moratta and Pigott; next Dugald Graham ; then Prince
and Ogg ; situated on the Boyne ; 80 miles from Gayndah.


Boonara. —Discovered and occupied by Edward Hawkins
in 1856 ; lie left for California, where lie was drowned, and
his brother succeeded him at Boonara; various changes
occurred during the fifties when station property fluctuated
greatly. Boonara was owned by Bertholdsen, and next by
the Messrs. Jones, also holders of other stations in the
district ; it lies about 50 miles from Nanango and Gayndah,
and is situated on the creek whose name it bears; this is
a tributary of the Baramba, on which in 1812 Mr. Richard
Jones took up the country and stocked it freely.
Barambah, —Always held a first-class title in squatting
circles, and, in the hands of Mr. R. Jones, was a suc-
cessful station. It 1870, Mr. Clapper ton purchased a share
in it. It is situated 70 miles from Gayndah, on the
Baramba Creek.
Boonbyjan. —Occupied in 1815 by the discoverers,
Messrs. Lawless ; after their decease it passed into the
hands of Mrs. E. Lawless. It is situated on the Liffey, a
tributary of the Baramba, and is about 87 miles from
Gayndah.
Taabinga. —First occupied by the discoverer, C. R. Haly;
afterwards representative for Gayndah in Parliament; he
was associated with Mr. J. W. W, Jackson in partnership ;
Taabinga is on the heads of the Baramba, and on the
Stuart, one of its tributaries, 95 miles from Gayndah.
Brovinia. —Discovered by Percival Stephens, 1816 ; sub-
sequently occupied by P. Butters, who committed suicide ;
the station then passed into the hands severally of D.
Coutts, Alexander Williams, Allies and Co., and Gilchrist,
Watt and Co. This run is situated on Province and
Cardarga creeks, 15 miles from Gayndah.
Kilkivan. —Fifteen miles east of Boonara, and 60 miles
from Maryborough ; was first occupied by J. D. Mactaggart,
and on his death passed into the hands of his trustees. It
was long a harbour for aborigines, and, in common with
many other stations, the scene of many outrages; gold
having been discovered at Kilkivan, a scattered population
are now there.
Mondure. —First occupied in 1811 by R. Jones, who
turned it over to Captain W. O’Connell, his son-in-law, who
resigned it in 1860 to McEwen and Green. It is situated
on Baramba Creek, about 52 miles from Gayndah.


Manumbar. —Forty miles N.E. ofßoonara; first occupied
in 1848 by John Mortimer, who also owned Tooncul in the
same locality.
Cania and Yarrol. —On Three-Moon Creek, 85 miles from
Gayndah, 67 from Mount Perry, and 22 from the great
Blackall copper mine ; it was first occupied by R. B. and
J. G. Ridler with sheep and cattle in 1848 ; both are dead,
and the property is in hands of trustees ; gold has been
found in the alluvial, and there are large deposits of copper
in the vincity, probably offshoots from Mount Perry and
Dawes Range. The country is very hilly and romantic,
some of the cliffs there being 400 feet high ; the Mount
Perry weekly mail passes this station via Yarrol, Canindah,
Milton, Dalgangle, and Krombit to Gayndah, from which
it is 90 miles distant. Being abundantly clad with thick
jungle, the Dawson blacks here found safe harbourage after
committing outrages. In 1851 the author of this history
was a shepherd on Three-Moon Creek, and eye-witness to
several murders and outrages, unavenged to this day.
Rawbelle. —Discovered by Mr. Trevethan in 1848 ; he
was a partner with Mr. Street, who was murdered at his
hut by blacks March 29th, 1852; situated on the heads of the
Burnett, and about 80 miles from Gayndah; the station
has had several owners, namely, Berry and Holt, McLean
and Beit, and the Queensland Sheep Investment Company,
and Mr. Mcßean ; vicissitudes in pastoral enterprise has
thus brought about remarkable changes.
Eidsvold, —First occupied by Archer Bros, in 1842, and
afterwards transferred to Ivory Bros. It is on the Burnett,
50 miles from Gayndah ; gold diggings were opened here
in 1890, and since continued with good results.
Redbank was taken up in 1848 as a sheep and cattle
run, by Mr. John Ross and family, after which it passed
into the hands of Mr. E. H. Lloyd. It is pleasantly situated
on the Auburn, and is distant 70 miles from Gayndah.
Yerilla. —Occupied first by W. A. Thayne, next by
Benson, Wood »nd Carruthers, and lastly by Gilchrist,
Watt and Co. On the Auburn 65 miles from Gayndah.
Rocky Bar and Redbank. —Occupied in 1848 by Jno. Ross
and family, and subsequently by R. Hamilton. Both
stations are among the finest in the Burnett District.


Dykehead. —4B miles from Gayndah on the Auburn, inter-
sected by the Taroom road. Occupied first by B. Fleming
in 1848, and by Mr. Alf. Thomas 1852, and Jno. Groker in
1860. The property then passed into the hands of the
Scottish Australian Investment Company, who still retain it.
Hawkwood is on the Burnett 85 miles from Gayndah.
Discovered and occupied by Jno. Kinchela in 1846. Messrs.
Fleming and A. Thomas were afterwards owners ; they
were followed by Bamsay and Jopp (the latter was drowned
in the Auburn Biver on the run), and it did not form a very
profitable investment for Mr. Hooper later on as owner.
Coonambula. —The names of the Brothers Archer, as
pastoralists and pioneers, is a household word, and in 1847
they took up this property, disposing of it a few years after
to Cameron, Mackenzie, Murrm and Cornish. It is now
held by Messrs. Knox and M‘Cord. It is on the Burnett,
12 miles from Gayndah.
Yendah. —On the Burnett, 12 miles from Gayndah.
Dight and Yeomans, owners. It was first occupied in
1848 by Bobert Wilkin and Elliott Brothers.
Mount Debatable. —4 miles from Gayndah on the Burnett.
Occupied first in 1848 by George Mocatta, next by the
Smith family, and in 1860 by Mr. Green, who committed
suicide. His widow carried on a dairy station there for
some time. The first hotel in this district was opened near
the main road on this run by Mr. Le Breton in 1848.
Ideraway. —Taken up in 1848 by Mr. J. B. Beid, who
sold to Mr. J. J. Cadell, M.P. The township was formed
here, and a quantity of land sold, disposed of by Beid to
Le Breton for about TIBO. This and the foregoing stations
adjoining have long been considered fine pastoral pro-
perties. Mr. Le Breton was the father of Mr. Le Breton,
late baker, of Kent street, Maryborough.
Ban Ban. —On the Barambah, 12 miles from Gayndah.
Occupied in 1846 by Messrs. Herbert, and subsequently by
John Edwards and St. John. Several murders committed
here on shepherds in 1852.
Wetheron. —Occupied by Wm. Humphrey in 1845, and
afterwards by the Hon. B. B. and S. Moreton. Lies on the
Burnett Biver, about 12 miles below Gayndah.
Teningering (aboriginal, “ bad feet ”) —J. and J. Lands-
borough were the first occupiers in 1849 ; they were


succeeded by Mr. Webber, who was accidentally shot dead
by Mr. Mackenzie, the C.P.S. of Gayndah. The station
next passed into the hands of Messrs. J. Sandeman,
Livingstone, Lament, Story, Rawson and Co., and finally
to Mr. Caswell. It is distant from Gayndah 85 miles, on
the Burnett.
Walla. —47 miles from Gayndah. Thompson and Barker,
1849; was retained, after the death of Thompson, by Barker.
Gin Gin (scrub). —Was taken up by the pioneers, Forster
and Blaxland, in 1847 ; the latter was murdered the same
year by blacks on the head station, and several shepherds
were also killed. Forster sold the station to Messrs. Brown
and Co., and abandoned pastoral pursuits.
Colanne. —Between Bundaberg and Gin Gin, 20 miles
from the former, and 16 from the latter ; is still the pro-
perty of Messrs. A. H. and N. W. Brown and D. F.
Johnston. Blacks in the early times here w T ere very bad,
and several shepherds and hutkeepers killed.
Yahha. —A famous aboriginal resort, adjacent to the
Bunyah Ranges, at the head of the Mary and Brisbane
rivers, 15 miles from Jimna, and 50 miles from Gympie ;
Brisbane, 110 miles. The scenery here is wild and grand,
and some fine waterfalls in the vicinity are the admiration
of tourists. It was taken up in 1850 by A. and I. Swanston,
and is still held by the latter. It has good grazing country
for cattle and horses. Several shepherds murdered here in
1856. The author of this work was a shepherd here in
1860, and narrowly escaped from the blacks.
Gigoornf/an. —Formerly called Merodian ; was first
occupied Toy Scott Bros, in 1848, and stocked with sheep,
which nearly all perished. It was next taken up by H. C.
Corfield, who brought more sheep to depasture, but lost all
by the depredations of the blacks. Several shepherds were
murdered, and Mr. Corfield was compelled to leave in 1850,
having sold the run to Leith, Hay Bros., who, in turn, sold
to Anderson and Leslie, the unstocked country in 1854.
It passed into the hands of Mant and Littleton in 1874,
who bought it with 9,000 head of cattle. The run is
drained by Munna Creek, which, after passing Miva, falls
into the Mary at Gootchie. Maryborough is 40 miles
distant, and Gayndah 55 miles.


Glenhar. —Occupied by Mactaggart and Kelly in 1859 ;
next by the latter and Lacey. It lies on the River Mary,
40 miles from Maryborough, and is well watered by the
river and Munna Creek, thus being a valuable pastoral
property for cattle.
Tagigan. —On the head of Tinana Creek, 64 miles from
Maryborough and 16 from Gympie ; was taken up in 1850
by Mr. W. Hay, who transferred it to Mr. John Eaton, who
sold it to Mr. Jas. Dowzer, who is still owner. The usual
troubles with aboriginals occurred hero.
Warra. —Taken up by Mr. Jas. Cleary in 1861, and pur-
chased by Or. Hamilton four years later. It passed into
the hands of Mr. John Harwood in 1866. Warra is 22
miles from Maryborough, and 7 from Elliott. It is at the
head of the Burrum watershed, and its carrying stock
capacity is estimated at 1,000 head of cattle.
Wonbah. —Ten miles north of Mount Perry, Wide Bay
district; is a cattle station, formed by George Rankin and
Frank Connolly, of Gayndah, afterwards partners with D.
F. Mackay. Messrs. Hughes and Shand are now interested
in this property.
Marianna. —Occupied for fully 80 years by Hugh
Graham, of Scotland, whose name as a pastoralist and
resident of Wide Bay is a household world. Marianna was
always a great harbourage for aboriginals, and their hostility
was a drawback to first settlement. It was considered good
grazing ground for sheep and cattle, and one of the most
representative stations in the Wide Bay District, the wool
from it fetching fully Id. per lb. more than that from other
stations. It is now cut up into selections and occupied by
small farmers and agriculturists. The Twelve-mile Creek,
now called Graham’s Creek, was a favourite camping spot for
teams in the early days, feed and water being there always
plentiful.
The following stations and owners deserve mention,
though particulars to hand are rather vague : —Barolin, A.
H. Brown ; Boompa, W. Bates ; Canandah, Jas. Gibbons ;
Currah, E. Booker ; Doongal, A, N. Melville; Eureka, H.
Palmer; Gutchy, H. Missing, formerly owned by Hugh
Graham ; Imbil, C. and P. Lawless ; Kolonga, Thos. Holt,
and at North Traviston ; Teebar, executors of John Eaton;
Lower Doongal, J. S. Powell; Moolangool, Mort, Cameron


and Buchanan; Moolboolaman, A. P. Barton; Miva, J. F.
Atherton; Sarahanna and Agnes Yale, Thos. Brown;
Stanton Harcourt and Tahiti, executors of John Eaton;
Tantitha, Isaac Moore; Toogoom, Aldridge and Slater;
Toweran, R. C. Barton; Widgee Widgee, Tooth and Gran.
The whole of these stations have more or less been the
scenes of outrage and bloodshed, many of the murders
done by the blacks being cruel and sanguinary.
In dealing with pastoral and agricultural interests, it
would be regarded as a great omission were no mention
made of the
Wide Bay and Burnett Pastoral and Agricultural
Society,
which was originally established in 1860. The objects are
thus set forth : —“ To promote the breeding of stock, the
growth of agricultural produce, and to encourage attention
to veterinary science, and to chemistry in its application to
agriculture ; to select from correspondence with kindred
societies such information as may lead to practical benefit
to agricultural and pastoral pursuits.” A large number of
subscribers were enrolled soon after its inception, and the
following were the leading representatives:—President,
Henry Palmer, Esq. ; vice-presidents, Hon. B. B. Moreton,
Jno. Eaton, Esq. ; committee, Messrs. Thos. Evans, G.
Mant, R. Clayton, S. J. B. Allbon, J. J. Power, M.D., A.
O. Jones, W. Sly, T. Ramsay, Win. Caring, Farquhar,
Hugh Monckton, E. Booker ; treasurer, Mr. Chas. Powell ;
hon. secretary, S. J. B. Allbon.
It having been decided that future meetings of the
association should be at Tiaro instead of Maryborough, a
public meeting was held at the former, in the court-house,
on August sth, 1887, to establish a Farmers’ Union for
Tiaro. Mr. Henry Maslin, chairman. Mr. J. Howzer
elected secretary, and 15 members enrolled. Members’
roll, August 8, 1887: —Jas. Howzer, Thos. Lawrence,
Henry Maslin, Magnus Steven, Alexander Douglas, P. C.

The Toolburra and Glengallan Estates on the Darling
Downs, with 80 farms and 60 farms at Toolburra, ranging
from 10 to 320 acres each, were opened to conditional selec-
tion in February, 1895. Toolburra land is valued at from
10s. to £4 an acre, and at Glengallan £1 10s. Agriculture
is rapidly taking the place of pastoral industry everywhere,
and in time, throughout the whole of the Wide Bay and
Burnett District, the pastoralist will have given way to the
agriculturist.
What has been done elsewhere should be a lesson for our
vignerons. Mr. Searle, of Roma, finding that his grapes
were more suitable for table use than wine, turned them
into raisins with the result that they brought sd. per pound
in the Brisbane market, the highest price paid for imported
raisins. As it appears unlikely for some time that wine of
a quality to compete against importation will be made in
Wide Bay, our vignerons should turn their attention to
raisin manufacture. The Zante grape should be cultivated,
and from its hardy nature would doubtless do well, as
colonial currants usually fetch higher prices than the
imported. Mr. T. Hardy, of Adelaide, has some fine crops
of currants every year, and the industry in South Australia
and at Melbourne has been very profitable. Muscatels and
table grapes should also be cultivated by vignerons in
preference to wine grapes.


ABORIGINES.
As the aborigines of Wide Bay were certainly its
primitive inhabitants, their inclusion in the category of
pioneer settlers is appropriate.
As aboriginal dialects vary at very short distances, the
following specimens may interest: —
Wide Bay.
Cobra —Head
Kera—Fire
Thalo —Food
Weel— Sun
Yurong—Rain
Mille -Eye
Burnett.
Toco —Head
I Fire
Coyoume j
sr go !>»■«>
Euroka —Sun
Coon —Rain *
Me—Eve
The tribes hereabouts, though differing materially,
acknowledge the several representatives heads of “ Bundah,’
Balgoin,” “ Dharwoin.” Throughout Australia there are
probably more than 500 dialects, each distinct from the rest,
though a few of the same words are met with all over the
continent.
The language of the aborigines of Wide Bay, with those of
other natives elsewhere over this continent, betoken one
common origin ; many of the same words indicating the
same articles prevail in parts remote from each other.
Thus “ cobra,” head, and “ boyou,” foot, used by the Wide
Bay blacks, are in vogue with the Worraderrie tribes of the
interior and others in Spencer’s Gulf. The language of a
savage is as simple as his mind, being drawn from a limited
vocabulary suggesting few ideas which obtain in civiliza-
tion. The aboriginal dialects of the Wide Bay and Burnett
tribes are very musical, the vowels generally conspicuous in
every sentence, the finals being the elongation of o, a, e, i,
and it, as in budget, &c. Some philologers claim
to have discovered Greek words in the dialects of the native
races here. Thus “ Euroka,” the sun, is said to be a
counterpart of the Greek “ Eureka ! ” —“ I have found it.”
Our present race of aborigines can tell us nothing of their
forefathers, and the simple and trustful “ child of nature ”
yet believe they were, after death, converted into “ white
fellows,” and resuscitated here. I, one day, told “ Billy
Barong,” an intelligent black attached to Graham’s Station,


that “ I was formerly an aboriginal king at Chin Chin,”
but growing tired of my after death existence had “jumped
up white fellow.” “ You woy !” was his reply, “ bale you
tell em lie. Me believe you same fellow mine know em
long time ago, Maryborough, longa boiling down (Aldridge’s)
on river.” When I enlightened him as to the truth, he
would hardly believe me, and felt better pleased to accept
the spurious than the real statement of facts connected
with myself. It is recorded of Davis, the “ Durrum Boy,”
that he entirely owed his safety after he associated with the
Wide Bay tribes, to his resemblance to the son of an old
woman, who accepted this theory of relationship and pre-
vented his being injured by hostile members of the tribe.
Bracefield, a survivor from the massacre of the crew of the
Stirling Castle, when Captain Fraser was killed by the
Fraser Island natives, regarded his immunity from harm to
his striking resemblance to one “ Wandi,” an aboriginal
chief, whom he was supposed to be, after having “jumped
up white fellow.” Billy formed a strong attachment to
me, and we frequently hunted together for opossums,
kangaroos and bees’ nests, and as he was a smart and agile
climber of the tallest trees in the scrubs, our share of
saccharine and other spoils was very great. From him I
learned the best part of the aboriginal dialect, and whilst
he complimented me in the celerity with which I acquired
the lingo, he frequently laughed right outright at my
ludicrous attempts to pronounce some torturing word or
sentence.
Rock Carvings.
It seems strange that so little interest has hitherto been
created in the carved and painted rocks of Australia, though
such real antiquities left by antediluvians are still met with
in forests and many parts of the colonies. On high hills
and precipitous cliffs, pictures—symbolical of the earliest
beliefs of the blacks—are carved, whilst, if we remember
that these rude artists had neither iron or metal tools to
do the work with, and only shell, bits of quartz, obsidian
or highly refractory stone axes, it will give us a faint idea
of the time and patience bestowed on those compact sand-
stone rocks. Even the most casual observer must admit
their mysterious importance as memorials of events in
past ages and illustrations of the names and customs of the


aborigines of a bygone time. But the chief interest which
attaches to these carvings is the way in which they connect
the natives of Australasia with those of Polynesia, and in
this they establish the fact that the ancient Australian
races are a mixture of the Polynesian. The tribes in both
localities are called by the names of different animals.
They were the Black Snake, Black Duck, Eaglehawk, Black
Crow, Schnapper, Sea and Eiver Eel tribes, Kangaroos
and Emu tribes, &c. One of the Black Snake Tribe could
not marry a woman of his own tribe, but might marry one
of the Eaglehawk Tribe, and the children of that union
would belong to the mother’s tribe, and re-marry into the
father’s tribe. Even the diet of these people was circum-
scribed. One of the Schnapper Tribe, for instance, could
not eat a schnapper if he caught one, but was obliged to
give it away, or exchange it for something else. This
illustrates the value attached by the natives to tribal
emblems, and among rock carvings an eel pursuing an
eaglehawk, absurd as it seems, had peculiar significance,
as showing that a vendetta was established between these
two tribes. lam pleased to find that Mr. Gurr has taken
up this subject, and given us a large amount of information,
but am sorry to find that he and Mr. A. Meston have
allured us onward into a labyrinth of ethnology of inter-
minable chaos and extent without clearing up the mysteries
with which we are surrounded.
The Kamilroy tribes were located from the County of
Cumberland, on the Hunter River northward to New
England, as far as the Macintyre River, where, in the
direction of Queensland, the Werriderry tribes were found.
The Yallaroy, Tangil, and Kumel dialects prevail in the
Burnett, and doubtless the language of the Wide Bay and
sea coast blacks to the N.E. is an amalgamation of words
from each of the foregoing languages.
In 1856, the Sydney Aborigines’ Board gave a grant of
160 acres of land at Blackney Creek to Harry Nelson,
an aboriginal.
Census returns of aborigines, Macintyre River, New
England, 1870, was 1848, of which there were 400 half-
castes.
For the past ten years there has been an annual decrease
in full blood natives in New South Wales and Queensland.


That the aboriginals of Wide Bay are capable of being
trained to become respectable and intelligent members of
society is proved in the case of Beeston, of whom the Wide
Bay News says :—“ Mr. Beeston called upon us the other
day, and spoke of the wrongs of his countrymen, of whom
he claims to be a representative. He is also a member of
the Salvation Army. His lineage is pure—purer than most
people in these colonies—and in his veins runs royal blood,
as blue as the Emperor of all the Russias. His people
were in Australia hundreds of years before Sir Henry Parkes
was born—perhaps before the Ten Tribes were scattered. In
those days the Australian autochthon did not work, nor
did he even after Captain Cook sailed the ocean blue. ’ Yet
he had abundance of the best and most wholesome food,
the gum-scented opossum and bear, kangaroo tail, the
tender bandicoot, to say nothing of ducks and dugongs,
turkey and tailor fish, parrots and porcupines, bustards and
barramundi, Bopple nuts and pituri. For all this, and
much more, his countrymen never had to work—the land
and all it contained were theirs by right divine. Now it is
different. He feels vexed with Master Tozer. No work, no
blanket, no food, no nothing. He says this is wrong.
The white race has taken away his land, and nothing is
given in return—nothing left but to starve, or beg, or steal
—nothing but the grave, to which this fine race is now
going fast. Beeston is a good specimen of a once free race,
speaks English well, and has shaken hands with Sir Henry
Norman.”
“ Black Campbell,” who was for some years in the local
native police force, was a most intelligent individual, and
conversant with many languages, speaking French, German,
Italian, and Gaelic. He received his education in Europe,'
where he was taken by Mr. Campbell, a squatter. On his
return here he followed horse-breaking. He met an
inglorious end through resorting to bushranging, and was
shot down in the Burnett District.
The Mary River tribes are the “ Mangiburra,” those of
the sea coast the “ Doondoras ; ” Fraser Island blacks were
called “ Moonbi,” or “Myall.” In 1850 they probably
numbered 5000 ; now a quarter that number is estimated.
The condition of the aborigines and the best method of
ameliorating it has long created great interest and sym-


pathy in the minds of philanthropists and reformers, and it
is creditable to our Government that they appointed Mr. A.
Meston (who has taken much trouble to elevate the race) to
the post of inspector. Mr. Meston seems thoroughly con-
versant with the aboriginal languages, and enjoys an
exceptional confidence among the various tribes. It
will be remembered that his aboriginal guard of honour,
from the Wide Bay District, formed one of the features of
Lord Lamington’s reception in Brisbane. It is needless to
add that, though His Excellency is a great linguist, the
aboriginal dialect puzzled him.
The aborigines of Wide Bay were very numerous in
1850, their numbers being augmented, from Fraser’s Island
and the sea coast tribes. The estimate of 10,000 for these
districts is not far wrong, but as they have succumbed
before European civilization, at present 250 will be about
the number.
Rapid decrease of the aboriginal inhabitants of any
country taken possession of by Europeans is the usual
experience, and although in this respect there is nothing
out of the ordinary in respect of the steady disappearance
of the original inhabitants of Queensland, comparatively
few pure-blooded blacks left in each colony is sufficient to
warrant the adoption of extraordinary efforts to preserve
the relics of a fast disappearing race. A good deal has been
done by the Aborigines’ Protection Board and the Aborigines’
Protection Society, and the efforts made on behalf of the
aboriginals have during the last ten years considerably
ameliorated the condition of the surviving members of the
different tribes of the colony. Still, the population has
steadily decreased, and the heavy mortality has been due
mainly to the use of intoxicating drinks. Every year since
its inauguration, the board has had a census of the
aboriginal population taken, and the figures are interesting
reading. Returns to August, 1882, gave the population as
6540 full-blooded adults, 1546 full-blooded children, 1108
half-caste adults, 1271 half-caste children, a total of 8919,
and the births during the year were 72 full-blood, and 40
half-castes. The deaths ascertained were 146, of whom 188
were full-blooded aborigines. In 1898 the returns showed:
Full-blooded adults 2888, children 1144, half-caste adults
1462, children 1811, total 7255, decrease 94. The secretary


to the board reported that on the 15th October, 1894, the
aboriginal population of the colony was 7702, of which
8756 were full bloods, and 3265 half bloods. The deaths
amongst the full bloods during the year exceeded the births
by 69, but there were 56 more births than deaths amongst
the half-castes. These figures accounted for a decrease of
only 18, but the disparity was attributed to the difficulty
experienced in making a correct census owing to the
wandering habits of the race, more especially in the remote
districts and amongst the border tribes, who frequently
passed into another colony. At the time the returns were
collected a large number of aboriginals had left their own
districts and were on the way to shearing sheds in various
parts of the colony.
Collectively, the Wide Bay aborigines are a mild, inoffen-
sive race, the less roused to avenge wrongs, when their
passions become ungovernable, and they resort to treachery
and bloodshed. Supposition as to their origin is but vague
and untenable. Their skill in making “ mogos,” or stone
hatchets, with stone heads or barbs in spears would indicate
their associations with the bygone Stone Age. The aborigines
themselves have nought to tell of the distant past, and the
patriarchs of the tribes shake their heads and evade the
white man’s queries as to their origin or meaning of their
mystic rites and barbarous ceremonies—the borah, skin
cutting, Obi worship, ordeals by fire and torture—of which
Europeans assume to know all, yet really have no know-
ledge of, are strange customs. lam quite at one with Mr.
Barton in his assertion that “ he has found reason to doubt
the necessity for assuming that Australia derived its
aboriginal population from any other now existing region.
Why should it not be coeval with the continent itself ? ”

First Circuit Court held at Fitzroy Hotel in 1860.
The first Court of Law, and first land sales held in wooden
“ humpy ” on Ululah Creek, 1852.
The township contained about fifty huts or gunyahs, and
an equal number in population, comprising chiefly sawyers,
timbergetters, splitters, and rough bushmen.
Elijah Smith, still living in Maryborough, was the first
undertaker, making coffins for Furbur and Williamson,
killed by blacks.
The pioneers of the medical profession were Doctors
Palmer, Ward, Brown, Power, Lane, Little, R. Spence,
and G. Archdall.
E. B. Uhr erected first house at Ululah Water Reserve.
G. D. Stedman had first sawmills on what was afterwards
called “ Sawmill Flat.”


The first purchasers of land at Wide Bay, in 1848, at
the Government land sales, Sydney, paid 10s. per acre, and
received one town and one country section. Few of the
original owners of this land are living, and in many
instances those having neither title or legal claim to allot-
ments are regarded as rightful possessors.
The following data is furnished by an old colonist
“ Heavy rains and floods in the river at the old town-
ship in 1858 and 1860 did much damage, but no
lives were lost. There were great inundations through-
out Queensland in 1864. First shipment of timber
to Sydney from Maryborough in February, 1861.
New Maryborough, though formed from the scattered
elements of first settlement round the “ Old Township,”
made but small progress till 1877, when the Hon. W. H.
Walsh and others exerted their influence for funds for
public works, with the result that £lOOO was voted by the
New South Wales Government, and the court-house, lockup,
and adjoining cottage built. The court-house was subse-
quently enlarged, and for several years the only brick
building in Maryborough. With improvements and better
management the aspect of primitive wildness characteristic
of early settlement gave place to a more agreeable state of
affairs, and these steps on the path of progress have been
continued to the present time.”
J. C. Bid well,
First Land Commissioner, and one of the early botanists,
was appointed by New South Wales Government in 1852
to make the survey of road from the Burnett to Brisbane.
Mr. Bidwell was a man of great ability and refinement, and
resided at Tinana Creek, and, in company with employees,
had several exciting adventures with the blacks. Geo.
Dart was one of the party, and his report, as given else-
where, is interesting, as showing what our pioneers had to
encounter. Continuous attacks by blacks, losses, priva-
tions and sickness hastened Mr. BidwelTs end, and, in
spite of the skill of Doctors Palmer and Brown, two local
practitioners, he succumbed on March 10th, 1858. The
Auraucaria Bidwillii or Bunya Bunya tree, was named in his
honour. It originally came from Switzerland, where it
attains a height of 250 feet, and though there are certain
species of bunya indigenous to the Burnett District, yet the
original tree has its home in Switzerland.


John Bartholomew, M.L.A.
Few men in the community of Maryborough are more
interwoven with its inner life and progress than the subject
of this notice. As plain li John Bartholomew,” he has
from boyhood been associated with it so closely as to be
regarded with affectionate and kindly interest. John Bar-
tholomew stands forth as one of our leading citizens, whilst
his elevation to the Civic chair in 1898-4, and his return
to Parliament at the last general election with J. T.
Annear, as members for Maryborough, were matters for
warm congratulation. John Bartholomew (we drop the
Mister or Esquire), is one of Nature’s gentlemen, ever
ready with a kind word, and appropriate action for the
occasion. He is a native of Glasgow, born on October 81,
1858. He left the old country as an infant with his parents
about 1860, and arrived in Maryborough in that year. He
has thus grown with the city, and been associated with
every movement for its advancement. Though educated at
the public school here, he received “ finishing touches ” in
Sydney. He was elected Mayor in February, 1898, after
the disastrous floods, and rendered efficient help to the
distressed. In February, 1894, he was again elected
Mayor, and it is notable that during his term of office he
reduced the overdraft of the Municipal Council from £4,682
to £2,029, and he was also enabled to get the rate of
insurance charged by the banks. Mr. Bartholomew has,
since his return to Parliament, shown considerable activity
and ability in advancing the interests of the town of which
he is so prominent a member, and I feel assured, that when
his term of office expires, none will have done more for the
community than the man all delight to honour.
John Thomas Annear, M.L.A.
John Thomas Annear, M.L.A., for Maryborough, was
born at Budock, near Penrhyn, Cornwall, on June 3rd,
1842, and arrived in Queensland in 1868. Soon after
settled in Ipswich, where he resided till 1867, when he
went to Maryborough with which place he has since
been closely identified. As a business man, he has
shown great energy, and successfully put up many
public buildings in Maryborough, notably the Com-
mercial Bank, Hanley’s Stores, the Immigration Bar-


'

racks, Hockley’s Stores, Lands Office, Court House
and State school. Of late years, and under the style
of J. T. Annear and Co., he has completed several
important railway contracts, the principal being the Mary-
borough and Gympie line. Throughout his varied career,
Mr. Annear has shown exceptional characteristics, and by
energy, determination and conspicuous fairness in all his
dealings, earned the respect of those who know him*
Commencing almost at the lowest rung, he has worked
himself into a markedly prominent social position, and,,
from starting as a manual labourer, has reached the
Chairmanship of Committees of the Queensland Legis-
lative Assembly, of which he has long been a useful
member. Mr. Annear belongs to the Liberal progressive
party; by conviction is a staunch Protectionist, and has
rendered no small service to Maryborough in building up
its industries. He is a member of the Perseverance
Lodge, Manchester Unity, and in 1890 was Grand Master.
In 1888 he visited England and the United States of
America. He was married to the second daughter of the
late Henry Skinnerty at Ipswich in 1867. As a “ self-
made man,” and one risen from the people, Mr. Annear is
a fine example to the rising generation of what earnestness
can achieve.
Thomas Finney, M.L.A.
Founder and senior partner of the firm of Finney, Isles
and Co., was born at Currakreen House, Tuam, Galway,
Ireland. Educated at a school in his native town by a
private tutor. He commenced business in 1856, subse-
quently holding the important position of buyer for the
well-known Dublin firm of Todd, Burns and Co. In 1862
he arrived in Brisbane in the ship Flying Cloud, and
shortly afterwards commenced business at Fortitude Valley,,
and from that period up to the present his name and that
of his firm have been inseparably associated with the rise
and progress of the capital city of Queensland. Commen-
cing with a small establishment and a limited number of
assistants, Mr. Finney found himself, after a quarter of a
century, at the head of the firm of Finney, Isles and Co.,
one of the largest business concerns south of the Equator,
employing nearly 400 hands and distributing over £30,000*

per annum in salaries and wages alone. Mr. Finney is
■distinguished for great force of character, no less than for
the broad and liberal ideas he entertains and freely expresses.
No better illustration of this could be quoted than his
consistent action to the Early-closing Movement. On nights
■other than Saturday he has closed at 6 o’clock from the day
he commenced business. After vainly endeavouring to
secure the co-operation of others, he decided to inaugurate
the Saturday half-hohday—a boon which his employees
have memorialised by the institution of a Charity Fund,
their subscriptions to which his firm subsidises pound for
pound. Hardly any public or philanthropic movement
has been set on foot in Brisbane with which he has not
been associated ; whilst he has done yeoman service as a
Magistrate, Licensing Justice, Member of the Board of
Waterworks, Member of the Fire Brigade Board, &c. In
days gone by he was an ardent athlete, and is still a
staunch supporter of manly sports and pastimes, being
■either patron, president, or vice-president of numerous
clubs. He has at intervals paid visits to Great Britain and
Europe, America, and, more recently, China and Japan,
and in each of them has creditably represented Queensland.
Often pressed to enter political life, he has invariably
declined on the ground that his business occupied the whole
of his time; but having definitely decided to stand for
Toowong at the generel election of 189G, and place his
abilities, energy, and high sense of honour, which have
made him so deservedly respected in commercial and
private life, at the service of the country, it is gratifying to
find he was elected to Parliament, where his counsels and
intelligence must make him a desirable acquisition.
Richard Bingham Sheridan.
One of the oldest of Queensland magistrates. Born in
Ireland in 1822, arrived in Sydney, 1842. Appointed by
Imperial Government to H.M. Customs, 1846, and in 1858
promoted to Brisbane. After “ Separation,” he was Chief
•Officer of Customs, Water Police Magistrate, Immigration
Agent, and Harbour Master at Maryborough till 1888,
when he retired on pension, and entered Parliament as
representative for Maryborough. He accepted office in the
Cabinet without portfolio, and at the beginning of 1886 was


appointed Postmaster-General. On seeking re-election he
was opposed by Mr. Pengeily, whom he defeated by 895
votes. Mr. Sheridan has always taken a warm interest in
the welfare of Maryborough, and to him is due the credit of
reforming the treatment of Polynesians engaged on planta-
tions, for which he received the commendation of His
Excellency Sir W. W. Cairns and the Press. Mr. Sheridan
was practically founder of the Maryborough Botanic
Gardens, and during his residence here mixed in public
movements such as the Volunteer Force, in which he held
the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. On leaving Maryborough he
was the recipient of an illuminated address and handsome
dessert service. Mr. Sheridan now resides in Brisbane.
Patrick Glindon,
A native of Ireland, was born in 1820. Served in the
84th Regiment at Bangalore, India, and arrived in Sydney
in 1854, but left in that year for Maryborough with his
father-in-law, Mr. Thos. Hanlon, to fill an engagement
under Mr. Henry Palmer. On leaving Mr. Palmer, Mr.
Glindon entered the Maryborough Police Force, in which
he proved a zealous officer for right years of active service.
On retiring he engaged in dairying and pastoral pursuits,
and had teams carrying loading to and from Gayndah and
the Burnett to Maryborough. He was among the arrivals
at Gympie in the “ first rush,” and having struck good gold
settled there. Thomas Hanlon died at Gympie in June,
1880, but Mr. Glindon survives him, and is hale and hearty
in his 76th year. He has a large family, all born in Mary-
borough, where Mr. Glindon, junr., and his sister, Mrs. R.
Murray, of Adelaide street, yet reside.
Thomas Manchester,
Who died of typhoid fever at Riversleigh, Bundaberg,.
in 1887, was born in Surrey, England, in 1850.
Arrived in Queensland in 1868. First engaged at
the meat works, Baffle Creek, and later on at the
Eurimbla saw mills, Bustard Bay. Settled at Bundaberg
in 1876, and with Messrs. Scott and Rattray, founded the
Burnett saw mills. Ultimately Mr. Rattray withdrew from
the partnership, and the firm became Manchester and
Scott, under which name it is still successfully continued


at Bundaberg. Mr. Manchester was one of the committee
of the Bundaberg School of Arts, the Progress Committee,
director of the local Building Society, and director of the
Land and Deposit Bank, elected J.P. in 1879. Married the
eldest daughter of Mr. Jno. Walker, Union Foundry,
Maryborough, who, with four children, survive him. He
was but 87 years old at the time of his death, and eminently
respected throughout the district.
Wm. Albert Holme.
Born 1840, died in 1884, A native of Manchester.
Arrived at Moreton Bay in 1861. He came to
Maryborough under engagement to the Lands Depart-
ment, and held the position for two years. Went to
New Zealand for a trip, but returned to Maryborough and
started business as land and commission agent. He was
an earnest and highly respected man, and devoted to the
interests of the district.
Robt. Jones.
Born at Conway, North Wales, 1842. Arrived in
Maryborough 1864, when he became assistant to
Mr. W. Southerden. He afterwards started business on
his own account, but in April, 1886, relinquished it for a
trustee and agency business. Appointed J.P. in 1882. He
has since held various offices in connection with religious,
Sunday school and musical matters. Also committeeman
of the State school ever since the passing of the Educa-
tion Act. Trustee of the Grammar School, member of
Chamber of Commerce, trustee of the public cemetery, and
was for two years member of the Municipal Council, and
took an active part in its reconstruction.
Wm. Keith,
A native of Glasgow, born 1841. Arrived in Sydney
1854. Employed shortly after as compositor on the
Brisbane Courier , but left this for engagement on the North
Australian , Ipswich. Entered into partnership with the
late Thomas White, compositor, of Gayndah, to start a
paper in Maryborough, the plant arriving in 1860, when
the Wide Bay and Burnett Times was issued. After many


vicissitudes, the paper lapsed in about eight months’ time.
Mr. Keith’s active temperament did not allow him to be
idle, and he engaged with Mr. C. H. Buzacoit, of the
Maryborough Chronicle , to work at “ case.” In 1871 he
became proprietor of the Wide Bay and Burnett News ,
which still enjoys a large circulation. Mr. Keith contested
with Mr. H. Palmer in 1881 a seat in Parliament in the
Liberal interest, but was defeated.
P. O’Kelly, Ferney.
(Odd Notes on the Maryborough District).
I arrived in Queensland in the month ol April, 1861,
having in the first place landed in Melbourne from the ship
Donald McKay.
The late Dr. O’Quinn and Dr. Cani, now Bishop ol
Bockhampton, and also Mr. E. O’D. MacDevitt, the Attorney-
General in the Macalister Ministry, were my fellow-pas-
sengers. The City of Brisbane, my landing place, was but
a poor-looking spot then. The principal streets were moss-
grown, and not formed at all. Little mobs of blacks were
seen with mangy dogs at every turn. The style of street
architecture was of the wooden shanty pattern. The two
principal hotels in Queen street were low cottage-like
wooden structures with wide verandas extending over the
whole footpath. The houses were shingled, and of various
shapes and sizes. The gentlemen went about the streets in
their shirt-sleeves, and when a stranger made his appear-
ance he was “spotted” at once, the people coming out ol
their little shops to gaze after him, and sometimes remark-
ing aloud, “ There goes another new chum !”
To account for my somewhat erratic career in my first
few years in the colony, it will be necessary to state that
after the classical education common with youths ol my
condition, I was ‘ placed ’ with a civil engineer, then engaged
on railway work in the north of Ireland, during the three
years previous to 1852.
There happened to be a railway boom on then, but it
soon collapsed, and I was left on my beam ends, so to speak.
I had, in the meantime, got a firm grasp of trial surveying
and general railway work, as well as office experience, in
making plans, calculations, and the like. My “ boss,”

having been previously in the Ordnance Survey Department,
trained his pupils in that most accurate system of land
measuring and mapping. And as a sketch plan of the
adjacent district, through which the railway was to pass,
had to accompany each trial survey, the pupils became
expert surveyors, as well as civil engineers.
But to resume : When I came to Brisbane it was quite
plain to the meanest capacity that nothing in my line could
be got; no engineering, certainly, and in the Survey Depart-
ment there were far more surveyors than could get constant
employment. To make matters worse, it was very difficult
to get any genteel employment, and a great many fellows
fit for clerical duty were quite hard up. It is true that
“high jinks” went on at the two principal hotels, the
Criterion and the Sovereign in Queen street, where these
very fellows were in the habit of putting on great airs. As
for me, I made up my mind to take the first offer of decent
work short of a splitter and fencer, but just in the very nick
of time I met one of the most genial and kind-hearted of
men, Cecil Hugh Colquhoun by name and a surveyor by
profession. He was at the Criterion, having had business
at the Surveyor-General’s office relative to a survey he was
then engaged on, viz., the Agricultural Reserve on the Logan
River. After getting fairly acquainted with this gentleman,
he invited me to his camp on the Logan. It was my first
start into the Australian bush, and I took to it at once.
There is a free and easy air of enjoyment in bush life that
is quite attractive to a person with a vigorous constitution.
As soon as I understood the style of survey carried on, I
could see it was plain sailing compared with all the intri-
cacies of crooked fences and irregular boundaries in the old
country.
The occupation of surveying is sufficiently intellectual to
take up the attention ; and the exercise of moving about
amidst the forest scenery, in the health-laden air, has a
cheering effect on mind and body. Being able to carry on
such work in a day or two, my friend got together a second
party of field hands, and we both finished the survey in a
short time.
After the usual spell of hotel life in Brisbane, we were
detailed to execute the survey of the agricultural reserves
about Maryborough. Taking charge of the party of men


with horses and the vehicle to carry the camp furniture, I
started overland for Maryborough via Kilcoy Station,
and arrived at the “Old Township” on the Ist day of
January, 1862.
The first work I did in the Maryborough district was the
feature survey of the Tinana Creek from its junction with
the Mary to what is now called Teddington, Mr. Davidson
was the district officer in charge of the Wide Day surveys,
and he at once sanctioned the cutting up of the whole of
the left bank of the creek into a double row of allotments,
varying in size from 45 to 80 acres each. I liked the
work, and went through it at a quick rate, so quick indeed,
that my friend Colquhoun was fully occupied in preparing
the plans, calculating areas, and touching everything up
for the Surveyor-GeneraTs office. We had our main camp
near the site of the Alpha Plantation, and during the
execution of the work we saw big mobs of aboriginals who
appeared to be very shy, and invariably moved away when
we came on their camps.
After this work was finished and examined by the district
officer, we did the survey of all the farms from Bidwell
Creek, opposite “ The Pocket ” at Maryborough, up as far as
Redbank, above Tiaro, a distance by water of fully thirty
miles.
The third big survey executed by me is on the left bank
of the river opposite Redbank, thence as far as Myrtle
Creek, which I named, and thence along that watershed up
to the head of navigation. This brings me to the month
of March, 1868, when all the surveys projected by the
Government were completed.
Living so much as I did in the open air and everything
being new to me, I took advantage of noticing the wild
animals of the bush, the state of the weather, and the
nature of the climate generally. We had a big drought in
1862 ; no rain whatever fell from the middle of February
to the 26th December following—a period of over ten
months. All the waterholes, except where springs pre-
vailed, were quite dried up. The river itself was positively
salt, and small sharks were to be seen as far up as the tide
reached. The course or bed of the river was in a bad state
from the stench of dead cattle that came for water, but
could not get up the banks again. As no settlers at all


were in this part of the district, no inconvenience from this
long drought was felt, except by stockowners. The frost
that prevailed in the months of June, July and August of
that year was very severe, and the cold most intense.
However, when the drought did break up, as it did on
Boxing Day, the rain continued with but little intermission
for four months. The river did not overflow its banks to-
any extent —it merely was in a state of constant fresh.
The survey of the Agricultural Reserve No. 2, where the
best land was, being now completed for some months, it was-
at length thrown open for selection in April, 1868. There
was such a rush for the allotments that they were mostly
taken up in one day—the price being £1 per acre, paid
down, and there were two rows of these allotments —a
front or scrub form, and a back one, which was not counted
so good as the front one, being mostly forest land ; but all
the same, these back farms went at the £1 per acre, too.
To mark the eagerness with which these lands were
watched by the public, intending selectors could be seen
day by day inspecting them, and in many cases they
squatted on allotments which they fancied weeks before the
opening day. It became a point of honour with most
others to respect this self-made preemptive right of the
squatter. Colquhoun’s Camp, as our place was called, was
the rallying point for the swell portion of the selectors.
Most of these having been intimate friends of mine, I
consider myself privileged to give a short account of each.
The first' was John Humphrey Greville Pountney, the well-
known handicapper, who could then tell you, without
consulting any authority, the winner of the Derby, or of
any big race, either in Great Britain or the colonies, for
the previous 100 years, and throw in the pedigrees, too, for
as many years back. He was also the most reliable
authority on such literary subjects as grammar, style, and
the correct pronunciation of all derivative words in the
English language. He knew German like a native, and was
a good classic scholar. Then comes Dr. Geo. Yerey, M.D.,
who was the friend and college chum of Pountney at Bartho-
lomew’s and London University. The third, Mr. Stone, an
ex-lieutenant of the Royal Navy, just come off an exploring
expedition in North Queensland under the Hon. Elphin-
stone Dalrymple, where the “ Captain,” as he was called,
acted in the capacity of surveyor and scientist of the party.


The favourite was James Dodd Elwood, Esq., the
descendant of a long line of Irish qintlemen , reaching back
to the time of Bryan the Brave, the monarch of all Ireland.
Last, but not least, comes the “boss” of the whole
party, the genial and versatile Colquhoun, who was the
soul of good fellowship and hospitality. Born in India, he
had travelled over most of that country in his boyhood and
could speak Hindustani with ease and fluency. He also
is conversant with several European languages. He was
unrivalled as a mimic and a caricaturist. He could with a
few touches of his pen hit off the facial peculiarities of his
friends with inimitable humour.
All these gentlemen were bent on ‘ ‘farming, ’ ’ as they called
it *, and although most other matters would come in for a
fair share of discussion from time to time, still farming, in
its most attractive form, had the lion’s share of deliberation.
It was the first subject in the morning and the last at night.
With some hundreds of pounds each in ready cash
(and the inevitable “ expectations ” behind) they fully
made up their minds to lead the rustic life in all its arcadian
simplicity, with the almost certainty of not having to rely
solely upon what they could make from farming alone.
There was some excuse, perhaps, for their entering on such
a precarious mode of living, but for me there was no such
justification to take up the same mode of existence. I had
nothing to depend on but my own exertions, and, strange as
it may appear, I was allured, it must be admitted, by their
example. True, I had once been at an agricultural college
and studied mathematics under its professors. Whilst at
this place, although not for the purpose of becoming an
agriculturist, my eyes were opened by the amount of real
and solid instruction imparted to its pupils. The curri-
culum included analytical chemistry, botany, the action of
the atmosphere on soils, the relative merits of fertilisers on
the various crops, with a variety of other intellectual studies.
Ot course, with this store of knowledge at my finger
ends, I privately looked on it as equivalent to capital,
and a cockatoo farmer I became forthwith. But what
astonishes me now is, how my mind became so cramped and
so utterly narrowed as to think of being able to make a
“rise” from such a rude and primitive beginning! Per-
haps, as my occupation seemed gone, there may have been
R


some excuse for me. There were no more big areas thrown
open for survey by the Government, and, of course, I had
to do something. I had seen farming conducted upon
scientific and economic principles, and therefore with a
measure of success, but then the surroundings were widely
different from the patches of scrub land on the Mary River.
I stuck to it, however, for over six years, and just made ends
meet, with a hard struggle.
After this date I began sugar-growing, and was one of
the first to take advantage of the sulphate of lime process
in connection with the Yengarie Refinery, and may remark
that this was the turning point in my career as a tiller of
the soil. This was in 1876. Having a splendid crop of
sugar, I purchased a crushing mill from a neighbour who
had been sugar-making, but failed. It might be considered
out of place if I mentioned the amount of my net profit
this year and in succeeding seasons. I will, therefore,
merely state that I was agreeably pleased with the result.
The fertility of my scrub land held out many years, and
when it showed symptoms of exhaustion, I at once made
use of my theoretical knowledge of agriculture by utilising
the megass or mill refuse as a manure for the new plantings,
one of the maxims in agriculture being the following ;
“ The best manure for a plant is the refuse of itself.” But
in my case the refuse was greatly improved by having been
trampled down in a stockyard by a mob of cattle, until it
became thoroughly decomposed and mixed with the nitro-
genous compounds to be found in such a place.
I have dwelt purposely upon this latter part of the
subject in the hope that those who read it may be benefited
by its perusal ; for the theory and correct system of agri-
culture —the primary industry on which all others depend—
is itself a liberal education, that is of the last importance
to the people at large.
But as regards the ultimate fate of the sugar industry, it
is doomed to decay, if not to total extinction, unless such
one-sided competition as that of the bounty-fed beet sugar
is removed. The additional bounty now given by the
German Government to the exporters of beet sugar from
that country is bound to reduce the price of cane sugar to a
figure that will cease to be remunerative.


In conclusion, let me state that in contributing this
fragment to the “History of Maryborough,” I make no
apology for not dwelling more fully upon matters personal
to myself, the somewhat private course of my life at Ferney
has caused it to be of little interest to anyone. One fact,
however, I would like to impress on the readers of this
sketch is, that “ Knowledge is power,” not merely in name ,
but in reality . This maxim was fully exemplified on two
occasions within my experience in this country. The first
was when I came to Brisbane without friends, and with but
a scant supply of cash, my knowledge of surveying enabled
me to make an honest living at that profession, when, as
pointed out above, such a thing appeared most hopeless at
first sight.
This maxim was verified a second time, when my know-
ledge of agriculture enabled me to apply a fertilising agent
to my exhausted soil, which assisted me at a minimum of
cost, to carry on sugar cultivation with profit for an
indefinite period.

Ferney, November 20th, 1896.
John Walker,
Founder of the firm known as Walkers Limited, came
from Ballarat, Victoria, to establish these works in the
sixties, and the business which to-day is one of the largest
and most important in Queensland has in a few years risen
to a large undertaking ; only those directly connected with
the iron trades can have any conception of the rapid growth
made by the engineering industries of this colony during the
last few years, and Walkers’ Foundry alone affords ample
evidence of progressive enterprise. The Union Works
belong to a limited liability company, constituted on the
co-operative principle, including amongst its shareholders
some of the leading mechanics in its employ, who were
purchasers of the business from the original firm of John
Walker and Co., the vendors agreeing to manage the
business for at least five years, and guarantee dividends for
that period at the rate of 12 per cent, on paid-up capital.
The annual reports of the company show that the guaranteed


dividends have not only been regularly paid during the
company’s existence, but a considerable reserve fund has
been accumulated, thus giving ample evidence of the excel-
lence of the management and rapid development of the
manufacturing business. Mr. John Walker, the founder,
has unfortunately of late been a great sufferer with his eyes
and is almost blind, but he has still much energy and
power. Mr. H. A. Jones, Secretary Maryborough Sugar
Company, is a son-in-law.
Brennan and Geraghty.
This well-known firm began business in Maryborough in
1872 as general merchants, and were the first to indent
direct from England. In addition to storekeeping they
have established several industries, notably wine-making,
jam, pickles and sauces. At Tinana they have a nursery
of 46 acres under fruit trees—lemons, oranges, and citrons
being prominent. The crops gathered annually are large
and good. Their factory in town supplies the trade with
orange, quinine, chili tonic, and other wines. The factory,
3 storeys high, is 110 feet long.
P. Brennan is a native of Kilkenny, Ireland, and arrived
in Maryborough in the early sixties. His partner is also
one of the early residents of the locality. Mr. Brennan
has also been a member of the local divisional boards since
their foundation, and is chairman of the Finance Board.
He was elected about eight years since a member of
the Maryborough Municipal Council, and is still a member
of the Licensing Bench.
Martin Geraghty was born in 1836 at Galway, Ireland,
where he followed the building trade. In 1868 he arrived
in Maryborough, and joined Mr. Brennan in 1871 as store-
keeper under the style of Brennan and Geraghty.
William Henry Walsh, M.L.A.,
Better known by the prefix of “ Honourable,” was a native
of England, and arrived in Maryborough in 1846. He was
well-known as a pioneer settler, having taken Degilbo in
1847, and Monduran a few years later. He was elected as
representative for the Warrego in the first Parliament. In
the early sixties he was elected M.L.A. for Maryborough,
defeating at the first contest for the borough the late


Andrew Wedderburn Melville, a local storekeeper, and
occupied the position of Speaker in the Legislative Assembly
in 1874. He was a man of great talents, and took a
leading part in all movements for the progress of Wide Bay
and Burnett districts. He was a voluminous contributor
to the Press, and his articles under title of the “ Ghost of
Ban Ban,” created a great sensation in these parts.
Mr. Walsh was president of the Wide Bay Farmers
and Planters’ Association in January, 1872, and a liberal
patron of agricultural and industrial societies. He had an
interest in the Burrum coal mines, and other mineral and
pastoral ventures in these districts. Mr. Walsh died from
accident in Brisbane in 1890, regretted by his old con-
stituents and friends.
John Eaton, Pioneer,
Is a native of England and arrived at the “ Old Township,”
Maryborough, in 1888, and took up runs in that vicinity,
which were occupied prior to his arrival by Mr. John Eales,
of Maitland, who was compelled to vacate the place from
the hostility of the blacks. At an advanced age Mr. Eaton,
who resides at Teebar, is a loving type of the good old
pioneer settler, still hale and hearty, and as popular as
ever.
Charles Powers,
Late junior member for Maryborough, is a native of North
Brisbane, and was born in 1858 ; removed to Maryborough
in 1861. Educated at the Ipswich and Brisbane grammar
schools from 1868 to 1870. Articled to the late J. P.
Lyons, solicitor, of Maryborough, 1871 ; elected alderman
in 1881, and Mayor of Maryborough in 1888. Returned
to Parliament as member for Burrum in 1888, and
appointed Postmaster-General and Minister of Education in
November, 1889. Re-elected member for Burrum in
August, 1890, and continued so till 1898. Returned
member for Maryborough in 1898, and elected Leader of the
Opposition in Parliament. Resigned in 1896. Mr. Powers,
during the whole of his parliamentary career, exhibited
great legislative ability, and his retirement from the political
arena was a source of regret to his friends. Mr. Powers
was a staunch supporter of democratic measures, especially
electoral reform. He opposed land grant railways and all


proposals to benefit a few at the expense of the many. He
was called to the Bar in 1894, and is now following his
profession at Bundaberg, where he is as popular as at
Maryborough.
George Horsburgh.
The establishments of Messrs. Geo. Horsburgh and Co., or,
more correctly speaking, Horsburgh and Co., Limited, the
title of the firm having been quite recently altered, are
known throughout the length and breadth of the Wide Bay
and Burnett districts, as well as in the adjacent colonies,
to say nothing of home and foreign countries with which
they carry on business transactions. Established in 1868,
in a not very pretentious form, the state of Maryborough
in those early days not warranting anything of a very
elaborate character, the business has continued to grow
from time to time until it has reached its present large
dimensions. In order to trace its early history, it is
necessary to “ look backward,” and hie away to that
favourite watering place and important shipping port in
Scotland called Gourock. Here was located in days gone
by the founder of the firm of George Horsburgh and Co.,
Limited, occupying the position of manager of the Gourock
Gas Works. At this time the present manager of the firm,
Mr. George Horsburgh, was but a lad, having been born in
Edinburgh, known as “ auld Reekie.” As will readily be
imagined, the removal from east to west in those remote
days was in no way equal to the facilities existing at the
present time when one is hurled along by rail at the rate of
60 miles an hour. The only means of transit between
Glasgow and Edinburgh in Mr. Horsburgh’s boyhood days
was by a canal boat, the journey occupying perhaps three
days. Like many others in the early sixties, the late Mr.
G. Horsburgh, accompanied by his son (the present manager
of the firm) and other members of his family, bid bonnie
Scotland a long farewell, and came to Queensland in search
ol one of the many fortunes that were said to be within
grasp in this sunny part of the world. The Golden
Empire (appropriate name) was the vessel chosen, and,
after a pleasant voyage, the Horsburgh family found them-
selves in Brisbane. A short stay in the metropolis sufficed,
and a start was made for Maryborough in 1868 in the good
old steamer Yarra Yarra. On arrival in this town an acquaint-

ance was struck up with Mr. R. B. Sheridan, then Sub-
Collector of Customs, who advised the family to start
business, and out of that commencement as plumbers and
galvanized ironworkers has evolved the flourishing estab-
lishments of Horsburgh and Co., Limited. Incidentally, it
may be mentioned that the friendship then made with Mr.
Sheridan has continued and continues, and the present
manager fully appreciates the many suggestions and kindly
advice given to him by his old and respected friend. Mr.
George Horsburgh has been connected with the business
throughout the many years of its existence, and it is to his
energy, perseverance, and indomitable enterprise that it
owes its present position, the success attained being due to
his careful watching. The progress of the town and district
has been carefully observed by him, and he has as carefully
expanded the business to keep pace with the advancement
of the town from its mushroom-like appearance in the
sixties to its present important position as one of the fore-
most manufacturing towns of the colony. During the year
1867, when the whole ot the colony (colonies in fact) was
agog about the discovery ot gold at Gympie, Mr. Horsburgh
with others was seized so strongly with the gold fever that,
without waiting for roads or bridges to be made, he wended
his way through the bush to the new Eldorado, and viewed
the land which is now famous as one of the first four gold-
fields in the colony. Since that memorable time he has
assisted to a very great extent in developing not only mines
in Gympie but in other parts of the district, with varying
success. He has also taken a lively interest in all matters
having for their object the welfare of the town and surround-
ing neighbourhood, and quite lately treated himself to a
well-earned respite from the worry attendant on business.
During this holiday he visited the scenes of his youth, and
as illustrative that our globe is not so very large after all,
he met an old school companion in London occupying the
position of one of that city’s leading architects. Mr. Wallace ;
the companion alluded to, in conjunction with Mr. Hors-
burgh, was always to the front in boat and yacht racing on
the famous Gourock Bay, and many were the reminiscences
recounted by these old schoolfellows when they met after a
lapse of over thirty years. During his peregrinations Mr.
Horsburgh has visited Northern Queensland, the far-famed


Darling Downs, the much-talked-of Blue Mountains in New
South Wales ; Sydney and its wonderful harbour; Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, Western Australia, and Tasmania. Eng-
land, with its cathedrals ; Ireland, the evergreen; Scot-
land, with its hills and heather ; and sunny France with
its vines and wines, are also spots on this habitable globe
that have attracted his attention, but only for a wdiile. His
home in the Wide Bay District had attractions above all
others for him, and after doing a considerable amount of
travel, he retraced his steps, as it were, to the “ Queen of the
Colonies,” fully convinced that it had few equals and no
superiors. Among the many incidents in Mr. Horsburgh’s
life none is of more importance than the fact that he was
one of the first to travel on the first railway line in
Queensland, and that before fares were exacted, being the
guest of the late Sir Arthur Macalister, then Premier of the
colony, and an enthusiastic member of the Brisbane
Caledonian Association. Mr. Horsburgh had been on a
visit to Brisbane, and was invited to a picnic as far as
Ipswich, by steamer. That town being reached, the
Premier invited his guests to take a run along the railway
line being then constructed between Ipswich and Too-
woomba, but not then opened for traffic—hence Mr. Hors-
burgh’s trip on the first railway line in Queensland. Mr.
Horsburgh received his education at the Highlanders’
Academy in Greenock, and has made excellent use of the
knowledge then acquired. Some twenty-five years ago he
sought and won the hand of one of nature’s noblest works
in the daughter of the late Mr. James Bartholomew, one of
Queensland’s pioneers in the timber industry, and a member
of the firm of Messrs. Wilson, Hart and Co. Needless to
say, she has been an excellent helpmate, and has assisted
materially in her own sphere in making the hours pass
pleasantly after the worry and toil of the day.
Marcus Boge,
Native of Schleswig-Holstein. Was born in 1851. His
early life was devoted to farming. On arrival in Mary-
borough he became partner with Mr. E. Scott, of Ellena
street. He next engaged in sugar planting at Cetchell’s
Falls, on the Mary River, where he purchased a farm and
erected a mill at the Aurora Plantation, which name it

bears to this day. This being sold to Mr. Hall, Mr. Boge
helped to establish the Tiaro Sawmills; also speculated
largely in mining at Gympie, Gebangle, Eidsvold and other
localities, (some only being successful. Mr. Boge was
appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1879, and has held
many important offices, notably president, vice-president
and committeeman in the old Liberal Association, Odd-
fellows, Alliance, and first Pastoral Association. He also
imported the sugar-cane known as the “Creole,” and
secured first and special prizes for it at local shows. He
was a prominent promoter of the Sunbury State school,
Gayndah road, a great boon to the residents. Mr. Boge is
a leading member of the cordwainer fraternity, and is still
carrying on business as boot manufacturer and importer
in Adelaide street. His genial manners have made him a
favourite, and he is one of the best known and popular men
in the community, and actuated with a spirit of progress
which others might emulate.
Miss Janet Melville,
Daughter of the late Mr. A. W. Melville (Melville and
Travis), was much esteemed for her many virtues and dis-
interestedness in the distribution to charities of money
imparted by her father. She bequeathed large sums to
the Grammar Schools, Hospital, and Presbyterian Church,
of which she had long been an active member. The
Maryborough School of Arts also participated in her
bequests to the amount of £SOO, and a neat marble tablet
in memory of this estimable lady has the following
inscription :
In graceful remembrance of
Miss Janet Melville,
For her munificent bequest of £SOO
towards founding a Museum
in connection with the institution
1888.
George W. Dart
Arrived at the Maryborough Old Township by the
schooner Liberty, Captain Johnson, in August, 1850, the
vessel being brought up from the Bay by the aborigines,
who often did good service as pilots. The voyage from
Sydney took three weeks. His shipmates were Samuel


Henry Arnold, wife and daughters, and two servant girls
engaged by Mrs. Uhr. Both soon married—one to James
Fanning, a bootmaker, by whom she was killed; the other
to Charles Hickson, a blacksmith. Mr. Dart, though
advancing in years, has a vivid recollection of the early
days, and is regarded as an authority on pioneer settlement.
He has contributed several sketches of his experiences to
the Press. He remembers the wrecks of the schooners
Liberty and Effort in Hervey’s Bay, when young Constable
McAdams, several prisoners, and Samuel Arnold were
drowned. He has a vivid recollection of the Old Township
in those primitive days, when it had neither school nor
church, the scattered population consisting of more blacks
than whites, and large camps of the latter occupied the site
of the present botanical gardens, where Mr. E. Uhr had a
boiling-down, with Messrs. Cameron and Millet as managers.
Here great fights took place between the Maryborough and
coastal tribes, or else the Gayndah and Dawson blacks were
their opponents, as many as 2000 being engaged in warfare
where the present city of Maryborough is situated. Mr.
Dart was also at Merodian Station (Scott Bros.), where
there was much fighting with blacks, who, hundreds strong,
had driven off 2500 sheep to Tinana Creek, then their great
stronghold. George and a strong party of whites from the
Old Township pursued them, but as the latter burnt the
grass en route their tracks were invisible and the sheep
never recovered. Mr. Dart was also employed with Mr. J.
>C. Bidwell, New South Wales Government Surveyor, then
making a marked tree-line from the Burnett, by which
many miles would be saved in taking prisoners to Brisbane.
The old route went via Gigoomgan, Boobygan, Baramba,
Nanango, Warrango, &c. Mr. BidwelTs starting-point was
from White and McGregor’s farms, keeping the watershed
of Tinana Creek for 45 miles, when he crossed a ridge to
the main range, dividing the waters of the Mary River and
Tinana, but after following the ranges he returned to the
Mary River, his marked tree-line going through the heart of
the present Gympie here. Mr. Bidwell was forced to erect
& temporary bridge on the Brisbane side, and whilst that
work was in progress Mr. Bidwell and an old soldier named
Walker, once cook for Henry Palmer, found gold, but this
was kept secret, and it is only the assertion that Nash was


the first discoverer of the precious metal at Gympie. That
has roused Mr. Dart to forward the following letter to the
Press :
“ I notice lately there has been some ink used in reference
“ to the first person or parties that found gold in Gympie,
“or its locality. To give the public the true facts, I wish
“ to narrate a few substantial facts, and I challenge the
“whole population of Queensland to deny the same, viz. :
“ The first gold discovered in Gympie was found by Mr. J.
“ C. Bidwell (1852), the first Commissioner of Crown Lands
“ for the Wide Bay and Burnett districts. Mr. Bidwell had
“ instructions from the New South Wales Government to
“ make a mark-tree line from Maryborough to Brisbane (the
“ shortest route he could make), so he commenced hismark-
“ tree line between Mr. M‘Gregor and Mr. White’s farms,
“ and from thence in a straight line towards Tahiti, leaving
“ Tiaro about four miles on the right hand side of the said
“ mark-tree line. Following on the watershed of Tinana—
“ leaving Neardie Station about one mile on the left of the
“ said mark-tree line, and a few miles from Neardie—he
a followed up a spur to the main range that divides the
“ Tinana waters from the Mary River watershed, and he
“ continued his mark-tree line right into Gympie; and it
“ was while he was delayed in Gympie, making a temporary
“ bridge over a creek there, he found gold ; BidwelTs mark-
“ tree line went straight through Gympie, - I might
“mention I saw the gold myself, for Mr. Bidwell was in
“ the habit of showing the gold to many of his friends
“ from the country, when they stayed there for dinner. Mr.
“ Bidwell also found gold at Glastonbury, and reported the
“same to the New South Wales Government. Mr. John
“ Eaton, Mr. Walter Hay, and others can confirm my
“ statements that Mr. Bidweli’s mark-tree line, afterwards
“ called Buchanan mark-tree line, from the fact that Mr.
“ Bidwell took ill after being eighteen days in a scrub with
“ nothing to eat but roots, and Mr. Buchanan, late surveyor,
“ was called upon by the New South Wales Government to
“ finish the line to Durundur. —G. W. Dart.”
Much more might be said of Mr, Dart’s early adventures,
and hairbreadth escapes from the blacks and exciting
station life. He still resides at Maryborough where his
wife and family reside. From the day he joined Charlie


Mason at Baramba Station to look after stock to the present
time he has been interested in cattle and sheep, and a
butcher pure and simple, and, though not always successful,
he has pulled through difficulties and trials which would
have daunted men of less energy.
Hon. John Douglas
Was Postmaster-General in the Lilley Ministry, accepted
the appointment of Agent-General for Immigration, but was
compelled to resign through the hostile attitude of the
Palmer Ministry which succeeded the Lilley Administration
in 1871. Mr. Douglas’s resignation was followed by his
return to the colony, and he was returned as member for
Maryborough in April, 1875. In June, 1876, he took
office as Minister for Lands in the Thorn Ministry, but in
March, the following year, formed the Douglas Ministry,
and retained office till January, 1879. Whilst in office, he
was re-elected in November, 1878, member for Mary-
borough. He ultimately accepted the position of
Government Resident at Thursday Island.
John Eales,
Of Maitland, Hunter River, New South Wales, may claim
the title of “ pioneer,” as he in 1847 depastured flocks and
herds near the “ old township ” for several months. He
had runs at Gigoomgan and Owanyilla, where the police
camp was established by Bligh, Walker, Morrisett, Uhr,
and other native police, who tried to convince him that he
had little to fear. The settlers were therefore lulled into a
false security, and only awoke to danger when innocent life
was sacrificed to treacherous savages. Mr. Eales also held
pastoral property at Tiaro, and doubtless would have
continued to hold it but for the frequent murders of his
shepherds and hutkeepers, and the driving off of the flocks
to the scrub, where they formed food for aborigines in a
wild saturnalia, when the tribes gathered for corroborees
from near and far. He fortunately escaped with his life,
and returned to the Hunter River in 1851. After his
departure there were many new settlers, notably Atticus
Tooth and others, who were succeeded by Mr. John Eaton,
the only one who gained a strong foothold here. During
his occupancy, Tiaro became a first-class station, and


continued so till 1864, when it fell into the hands of the
surveyors and was cut up into township allotments. At
the first auction sale, Aldridge, Eaton, Inman, Cooper, and
Markham attended and purchased largely, but there was no
progress till about three years afterwards, when Gympie
gold set people moving, and the township forged ahead.
W. J. Inman, on the advent of the Gympie diggings and
influx of travellers, turned the old station into an hotel—
regarded as a first-class place of resort until Messrs. Job
and Trail erected the Victoria Hotel on the line of road
west of the Lagoons, and from this point the main street was
formed by the erection of shanties and houses of a rough-
and-ready style. The formation of the town was thus :
A saddler pitched his tent among the trees; next, a
blacksmith and wheelwright rigged up humpies ; a shoe-
maker and enterprising storekeeper followed, and undertook
the duties of postmaster. Rival “ pubs.” arose ; a Govern-
ment school and schoolmaster were provided ; pound and
lockup were erected as necessary adjuncts, whilst a large
cemetery was reserved. This was of an extent unlikely to
be filled for centuries. A large building to hold public
meetings became a want, and the Protestant Hall was
erected. An Orange Lodge was also inaugurated, and a
School of Arts established. After this, Tiaro began to
meet with fair representation in the correspondents’ column
of the Maryborough Press.
J. D. Mac TAGGART
Was born at Campbelltown, Argyleshire, Scotland, November
11, 1823, and died at Kilkivan January 16, 1871, aged 48.
He was of military bearing and one of the early pioneers
of the Wide Bay District, and much respected for his
straightforward principles. The name of Mactaggart will
long be remembered in connection with the wool and cattle
interests of this district, and it is regretted that so little
reliable information can now be obtained as to his career.
Messrs. Mactaggart Bros., of Brisbane, are his nephews and
executors. After his decease Mrs. Mactaggart married a Mr.
Rose, and has now joined the silent majority.
Charles Hardie Buzacott, M.L.C.
Born in 1885 at Torrington, Devonshire, where he was
educated. Arrived in Sydney in 1852, where he acquired a

knowledge of the printing business and journalism, and in
October, 1860, came to Maryborough, Queensland, and
established the Chronicle. In 1864 he started the Peak
Dozens Telegram , and six years later purchased the Rock-
hampton Bulletin , bringing out a weekly edition of the
paper as the Capricornian in 1875. Entered Parliament as
member for Rockhampton in 1878, but resigned at the close
of the session. In 1875 he was again elected, and in 1879
was appointed Postmaster-General under the Mcllwraith
Government with a seat in the Upper House. Whilst in
responsible office he originated, among other useful
measures, the Divisional Boards and Local Works Loan
Acts, and secured consent of his colleagues to direct mail
communication between London and Brisbane, which
eventuated in the establishment of the 8.1. Torres Straits
Mail Service. He also carried through the Postal Card Act,
and introduced the telephone to Queensland. Resigned his
seat in Parliament in 1880, but in 1882, at the request of
the Mayor of Brisbane, drafted the Tramway Bill, which
was carried through Parliament as a Government measure.
He was the originator and chairman of the Brisbane
Tramway Company in 1886. On behalf of the Brisbane
Newspaper Company, of which he held one-third interest,
in July, 1884, he purchased the site of the Courier Building
for T40,000 cash, and spent a large amount in the erection
of the magnificent structure in which are now published
the Courier , Observer and Queenslander newspapers. Mr.
Buzacott married, in 1859, the daughter of the Rev. Geo.
Whiteford, of Sydney, and has a family of four sons and
daughters surviving. Though Mr. Buzacott now seldom
visits Maryborough as heretofore, he still maintains interest
in the progress of the city and its surroundings.
Rev. Canon Eva
Was educated at King’s College, London, where he became
an A.K.C., in 1871 ; ordained Deacon at Chester Cathedral,
June 4, 1871, by the late Dr. Jacobson, Bishop of Chester,
and a Priest in 1878. His only curacy was at Christ
Church, Great Homer Street, Liverpool, under the well-
known missioner, Rev. W. H. M. H. Aitken, M.A. The
Revs. Canon Honeyburne, M.A., and Dr. Weitbrecht,
Ph.D., were his fellow curates. Leaving England in 1874,

REV. CANON EVA,.


Canon Eva was sent to Sydney to do pioneer work in
North Queensland, and became Rector of Cooktown in 1875,
where he built a church and rectory, and organised the
most northerly parish in Australia. In 1878 he became
Incumbent of Prospect and Seven Hills, where he was
privileged to build a brick church, opened by Bishop
Barker in October, 1880. He was also at Blacktown, near
Parramatta. He arrived in Maryborough in 1881 as
Rector of St. Paul’s Church ; appointed Rural Dean in
1886, and Hon. Canon of St. John’s Cathedral, Brisbane,
in 1892. Apart from his ministerial position, Canon Eva
is largely respected by all classes of society, and his kindly
ministrations and liberal views have exalted him greatly in
the estimation of the community. He is patron of all that
is pure and elevating.
Dr. J. Hugh Harricks,
M.R.C.S., England, Lie. K. and Q. Coll. Physicians, Ireland,
was a native of Liverpool, England, and a popular and
experienced medical practitioner, whose sudden death from
syncope on the night of July 13, 1896, was a source of
universal regret. He was Hon. Surgeon of the Maryborough
Hospital. Dr. Harricks arrived in this city by the Southern
Belle, which was wrecked in Keppel Bay in 1874, and he went
from here to Clermont and Mackay. He was first resident
surgeon of the Maryborough Hospital about 18 years ago,
and when on a trip to the old country, Dr. Sugden filled
his place. He took great interest in military matters and
was the first captain of the C Company in 1885, but latterly
was on the retired list. He took great interest in the
ambulance movement, on which he delivered several
lectures under the title of “ First Aid” at the School of
Arts. He left a widow and family—one son in the Union
Bank—and his remains were interred with military honours,
members of the local Defence Force, Naval Brigade,
Foresters, and P. A. Society attending.
Rev. Joseph Irvine Knipe, D.D.,
Has been so long and intimately associated with the
Presbyterian Church of Maryborough that it is almost
imperative to give a memoir of his singularly prosperous
career to preface the historic records of his church. Mr.

DR. J. HUGH HARRICKS.


Knipe is a native of County Kerry, Ireland, and born in
1888. He studied at Dr. Bryce’s Academy, Queen’s
College, and at the Presbyterian Theological College,
Belfast. After receiving license to preach by the Presby-
terian Church of Ireland, he was appointed by the Board
of Missions to visit Queensland, and arrived in Brisbane in
1867, when he was shortly after sent by the Presbytery of
Brisbane to Maryborough, where he married, and has since
been settled. He received his D.D. degree in the Jubilee
year. The early history of the Presbyterian Church shows
that in 1868 the Rev. G. M. Reid came to minister to the
Presbyterian people of the town and district. Worship was
held in the old Court House, and a Sunday school formed,
of which the late Mr. Wm. Paterson was superintendent,
and he was ably assisted by the following active workers :
Messrs. A. W. Melville, G. and D. Groundwater, John
Linklater, Thos. Spiden, Jno. Thompson, J. Trotter, P.
and R. Graham, Jas. and W. Paterson, C. Lament, J.
McPherson, P. M. White, Geo. Horsburgh, Jas.
Bartholomew, T. T. Woodrow, D. Matheson, and T. Miller.
Mr. Reid retired from the ministry in October, 1864, and
was succeeded by Rev. R. Graham, of Sydney, on October
28 of that year. The foundation stone of the old church
was laid by Mr. A. W. Melville in June, 1865, and though
Mr. Graham resigned and left the district on November |ls,
1865, the erection of the church was still proceeded with,
M. Ramsay being instrumental in bringing it to a success-
ful termination. Mr. Knipe, the present minister, arrived
here in October, 1867, and in 1872 completed his semi-
jubilee. It was to commemorate this event that special
meetings and services were held.
The Presbyterian Sunday school has, since its formation,
been marked by steady growth, and as a number of intel-
lectual and willing men and women devoted their energies
to its interests, the school has prospered, and is reported to
be in a flourishing condition. It has a large staff of
earnest teachers. Mr. W. Dawson is the present school
superintendent, and enjoys the confidence of both parents
and scholars. The first jubilee was held on October 24,
1892, and as the Hon. A. Heron-Wilson, M.L.C., had,
with his usual liberality, offered the use of his splendid
grounds, about 400 children, with their parents, teachers,

and others availed themselves of his kindness, and
a most enjoyable time was spent at Boon Villa and its
extensive grounds, and refreshments supplied by the
generous host and hostess were highly appreciated, equally
with the hearty welcome accorded. In the afternoon an
appropriate and acceptable presentation was made to Rev.
J. I. Knipe, viz., a purse of 108 sovereigns, by Mr. Geo.
Stupart, on behalf of the congregation. The Rev. J. I.
Knipe, in reply, gave an outline of his career, from his
arrival in Maryborough, including an exciting record of
pioneer missionary work at Gympie and other towns in the
district. The debt on the old church was £6OO, and £3OO
of it was paid by the trustees, Messrs. MacTaggart,
Meiklejohn, and Melville. The foundation stone of the
new church was laid October 8, 1880, by the Rev. Colin
McCulloch, and opened by him on JNov. 20, 1881. The
whole cost of this church was £4400, of which at Rev. C.
McCulloch’s services, £8,650 were collected.
The eulogy passed on Dr. Knipe by a speaker at a
conversazione given in his honor will form a fitting close
to this article :—“ A Minister who for 27 years preserves
himself, and retains the respect and esteem of his
congregation and others, gave a testimony that he had
attained a great deal. Mr. Knipe had walked uprightly,
worked righteously, and spoken truthfully.”
Note. —It is regretted that the annual report of this
Church was not sent the author till too late for publication.
John Harwood,
An early pioneer, was born at Bradford, Yorkshire, in 1817.
Educated in Lancashire, where he followed the business of
a wheelwright. Arrived in Moreton Bay in the first
immigrant ship in 1848, and came direct to Maryborough
where he settled, to carry out a contract for George Furbur
at Girkom, near the “ old township.” The blacks at this
place w T ere very hostile and killed many, including Furbur
with his son-in-law, and Mr. Harwood had several narrow
escapes. His firmness of character alone saved him from
his comrades’ fate. The country thereabouts after arrival
of the Aldridges, Palmers, and Mr. Jones’ (Baramba)
flocks became more settled, and great business was done at
the wharves in supplies for settlers, and shipping wool,


tallow, and hides from stations. Timber was then a rising
industry, though, until the erection of sawmills with
modern appliances, the trade was limited to rough bushmen
and splitters, who did well by cutting cedar and pine in the
boundless jungles on the Mary. The site of the township
was marked out by Mr. Labatt, and in 1852 a police camp
was established here, with Mr. Harwood and McAdams as
the ruling powers. Mr. Harwood was the first mail carrier,
and served in the Mounted Police for twelve years. He
also followed team driving, and took five bullock teams a
distance of 800 miles into the bush with station stores.
This business he followed for nearly twenty years, when he
purchased Warra Station, about twenty miles from Mary-
borough, and settled there with his wife and family. Mrs.
Harwood was the second white woman at the “ old town-
ship, ” and his third son (James) the first male child born
there. His daughter, married to Mr. Jas. Marsden, was
the first female child born in the town. Mr. Harwood was
alderman of the Maryborough Civic body. Elected
Mayor in 1868, and appointed magistrate in 1884. At
present, though in advanced years, he is a living type of a
healthy and hearty man. Mr. Harwood’s son, J. Harwood,
jun., is now proprietor of the Royal Hotel, Tiaro. This
hotel has become a favourite stopping-place for visitors,
whilst the comfort of all is attended to by the affable host
and hostess.
Neil Blue,
Born at Campbelltown, Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1845.
Followed a seafaring life till 1870, when he arrived in
Maryborough, where he engaged in the steam coastal
service. After four years he purchased a small wooden
building called the Melbourne Hotel, Wharf street, and
improved it by rebuilding to render it worthy of modern
times. His wife, Mrs. S. Blue, one of the Gregory family,
well-known in early pioneering days at the “ old township,”
survives him, and still resides at the Melbourne Hotel.
Mr. Blue was a great favourite with the public for his
straightforward character and affability. He took con-
siderable interest in rowing and aquatic sports, and was for
some time captain of the Maryborough Rowing Club. He
was also a prominent member of the Oddfellows and


Masonic Orders, and held high honours in these lodges.
His death took place at the early age of 48 years through
exposure and over-exertion during the 1898 flood.
H. St. John Wood, J.P.,
After twenty-five years service, ranks as one of the oldest
and most respected officers in the Government service.
Was born at Benfleet Rectory, Essex, England, and
educated partly at home, and at Dr. Brewer’s School,
Norwich, and at the Kettering Grammar School, North-
amptonshire, He is the son of Rev. B. J. Wood, M.A.,
of St. John’s College, Cambridge University, and arrived
here in 1866. He joined the Surveyor-General’s Depart-
ment in August, 1872, having previously studied surveying
in England and the colony. He was for several years
licensed surveyor in the West Moreton District and North
Queensland, where he surveyed the present settlement of
Thursday Island. Mr. Wood is justly considered one of the
most indefatigable officers in the service, and his recollec-
tions of the old pioneer district survey office go back to its
inception, when Mr. Buchanan, Mr. W. M. Davidson, and
Mr. McDowall (the present Surveyor-General) were house-
hold words here. Since that period rapid strides have
been made in settlement, towns and villages have sprung
up, with large farming and agricultural settlements in all
directions. A few years hence it will be recognised that
the theodolite and chain have been essential means of
opening up the country and inducing settlement on the rich
and fertile lands of the Wide Bay and the Burnett districts.
Mr. St. John Wood has been district surveyor for twelve
years, and it need hardly be added that his surveys give
universal satisfaction. He was elected Fellow of the
Meteorological Society in March, 1877. This society has
its offices at 80 Great George street, Westminster, London.
He takes great interest in agricultural pursuits and football,
and all manly sports have his hearty support. Among
several important works of public interest made by Mr.
Wood may be mentioned the Trigonometrical Survey of the
City of Brisbane, and the first contour survey at Lytton for
the Military Defence Commission in 1877.
C. H. Barton, 8.A., Oxon.,
Author of “ Outlines of Australian Physiography,” who
was upwards of fourteen years classical master at the Mary-


borough Boys’ Grammar School, deserves more than a
passing notice in this work. As an intelligent literary man,
his mental gifts are of a very high order, and he has
delivered lectures and published books which appeal to all
that is elevating and pure in men’s nature. It appears
humiliating to confess that many of Mr. Barton’s sweet
and original ideas are, in Maryborough, “ wasted on desert
air.”
Fritz Kinne,
A native of Gross Wanzleben, Germany. Was born Dec.
20, 1844. Leaving school in 1858 he learned the building
trades, and although proficient in these, he embarked in a
less congenial pursuit—that of journeyman butcher. From
1861 to 1865 Mr. Kinne worked in various cities and visited
Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck, Magdeburg, Gentin,
Neuminster, Frankfurt, Cashel, and on the termination of
the war in 1866 extended his travels to St. Petersburg and
Gatschina, in Russia, remaining there nine months, when
he went to Denmark and remained till 1870, when he sailed
for Queensland, and coming to Maryborough has been
located here ever since. He entered into the butchering
business, but after a year’s trial established himself as a
contractor and builder with great success. Among the
contracts he successfully carried out may be mentioned
large stores for Mr. J. E. Noakes and Peter Graham, shops
for Priddy, Horsburgh, Woodrow, and Mrs. Goodwin’s Aus-
tralian Hotel, the Queensland National Bank, Girls’
Grammar School, Presbyterian Church, additions to Roman
Catholic Church, telegraph office, the old hospital, and
other edifices. The Great Western Hotel which he now
occupies, and of which he was the builder, is one of the
most comfortable hotels in Maryborough, and an ornament
to the city. In 1889, finding the contracting business dull,
Mr. Kinne entered on the occupancy of the Great Western
Hotel, being assisted by his wife, whose name is proverbial
for kindness. Travellers invariably visit the Great Western
in preference to other Maryborough hotels, the comfort and
attention to their wants being special attractions. Mr.
Kinne was elected to the Municipal Council in 1890, and
appointed mayor in 1895, an office he filled with credit.
On the expiration of his term he was again re-elected a
councillor. In his municipal career Mr. Kinne has shown

FRITZ AND MRS. KINNE,


great ability ; his advice and counsel have had great weight
when knotty questions affecting the welfare of the rate-
payers have been discussed. He is of liberal principles, and
a strong supporter of all movements to advance the com-
munity, and such have made him popular. Mr. Kinne has
a large family.
The Great Western Hotel
Occupies a prominent position in Lennox street, nearly
opposite the railway station, and adjacent to Kent street,
the Council Chambers, School of Arts, churches, and public
schools. It contains a large number of rooms, and has
ample accommodation for tourists, &c., travellers of all
classes. The cuisine and internal arrangements are under
the special supervision of Mrs. Kinne, who provides a daily
menu not surpassed at any metropolitan hotel. From the
balcony of the upstairs room fine views of the surrounding
country can be obtained. Adjacent to the sleeping apart-
ments (which are replete with every comfort) is a cosy
sitting-room in which there are music and other attractions.
Mr. and Mrs. Kinne celebrated their silver wedding on
October 29, 1896, at the Great Western with a supper, at
which a large number of guests were present. A pleasant
social gathering, harmony, songs, and presentation of gifts
to the happy pair, who, though advanced in years, are still
“ young in heart,” made it most enjoyable to all concerned.
Henry Palmer,
One of the oldest Maryborough residents and pioneer. He
arrived at what is now known as the “ old township ”in
1848 with his brother, Mr. R. E. Palmer and Mr. E. T.
Aldridge. He brought flocks and herds with him and
entered into pastoral pursuits, more especially on the
Burnett, where he had a station, his brother going to
Gladstone. He has been a pastoralist for years, and is one
of the best known and most respected among North
Queensland squatters. Mr. Palmer was elected the first
Mayor of Maryborough on April 26th, 1861, and held
office till August, 1861, when he resigned, but was re-elected
in 1864, and retained the position till 1866. Mr. Palmer
is still a resident of Maryborough, and on his expansive
grounds one ot the largest trees in the locality is to be
found. Though not now taking part in public life, Mr.

GREAT WESTERN HOTEL, MARYBOROUGH


Palmer has done much good for the town, and his efforts
to establish the Botanic Gardens and other institutions |are
not likely to be forgotten.
George A. Watson,
Father of the present assistant Municipal Town Clerk,
arrived at the “ old township ” in April, 1848, by the
Aurora, cutter, with Mr. Bichd. Jones, of Baramba Station,
to take charge of sheep sent from the Burnett to be boiled
down. 14,500 sheep arrived, and were taken charge of by
Mr. Watson, who faithfully carried out his duties. Mr.
Watson, a native of London, died May 18, 1889, aged 67,
after a long and painful illness. He will be remembered by
old residents as paymaster in the Roads Office. His father
was Immigration Agent in Brisbane, and Mr. Watson, who
was a moving spirit in most local public enterprises, was in
every respect a popular man.
George Furbur,
An enterprising teamster and bushman, came overland from
Ipswich to the Wide Bay District in September, 1847, and
after reaching the Old Maryborough Township settled at
Girkum, a deserted sheep station, once occupied by Sales.
The exact place is unknown, but is recorded as opposite to
Rose Hill. Here he opened the first store, but unfortunately
for himself and the men on the adjacent stations, kept a
supply of grog, which was freely dispensed and sold to any
who could pay for it. The lax system of law which prevailed
enabled him to infringe the liquor laws with impunity.
Furbur was a man above the ordinary class, and although
the locality swarmed with naked savages, he felt little fear
either for himself or his wife and child. Mrs. Furbur was
the first white woman located at the Old Township, and for
the first year she had only aboriginal females as companions,
till Mrs. Harwood, wife of Const ble Harwood, the second
white woman, arrived. Furbur, true to his native instincts,
followed bush work, such as felling timbei, fencing, and the
like. But he was ill-prepared for treachery, and one day
whilst digging a post-hole two blackfellows swooped down
upon him, and one, seizing his broad axe, buried its blade
in his skull. Astonishing to relate, the poor fellow, though
injured, succeeded in getting a horse from the bush, and


having saddled it, set out for Brisbane, where, under skilful
medical treatment, he recovered, and returned to his old
quarters at Wide Bay, where for two years he was
unmolested by the blacks ; but about the year 1850 he met
with an untimely end, at the same spot, whilst sawing
timber with his son-in-law (J. Williamson). Both were
killed during the dinner-hour, and their graves and tomb-
stones, though broken, bear silent witness of the perils
surrounding the early settlers. It is on record that Furbur
shot many aborigines shortly after his arrival, and his
death was a retribution for his rashness.
Lewis Jackson,
Native of Cambridgeshire, England. Was born in 1828.
Arrived in Moreton Bay by the ship Saldana, and came
thence to Maryborough with his family in 1862. He was
first employed in station work at Degilbo by the late Hon.
W. H. Walsh, but after a year returned to Maryborough,
where, in common with other pioneers, he saw many ups
and downs, and the rough side of life. It is also stated
that he with his family camped for some weeks on the
Town Reserve, the site of the present railway station.
Selecting land, owned by Mr. Perry, then covered with
dense scrub, on what is now called Ann street, on a clearing
lease of seven years, he remained there farming for that
term, then left in consequence of the great flood of 1864
sweeping off his crops and causing almost total ruin.
He next purchased a farm on the Mary River, near lindah,
which he named “Linton,” and planted rotation crops,
beginning with cotton and ending with sugar-cane. It may
be of interest to state that he took large and fine crops, 96
bushels per acre of wheat off forest land, whilst on scrub
land the yield was very poor. Having been fairly suc-
cessful, he retired about ten years ago from active life,
and his two sons are engaged in pastoral and
agricultural pursuits. Though he lost heavily by the
flood of 1898, he settled down at lindah quietly and
resignedly to the calamity, and in his 78rd year of age, is a
thorough type of the old Wide Bay pioneer. He is the
father of eleven children, five of whom are natives of Wide
Bay, and all living.


Ernest August Kruger
Was born in Germany September, 1855, and arrived with
his parents in Maryborough in 1864, where the family were
engaged at the station of the late N. White, grazier, of
Prawle. On leaving this in 1866 Mr. Kruger the elder
started business in Ellena street, Maryborough. Great loss
was suffered by the destruction of his premises by tire, and
other losses followed. On his father’s retirement, the
subject of this notice joined his brother Charles, but bad
times, bad debts, and other misfortunes in the butchering
trade caused dissolution of partnership in 1889, when Ernest
visited Sydney, and on returning to Maryborough started a
grocery store with J. Kenna, in Adelaide street. Ultimately,
he returned to butchering, and united with his brother to
establish a branch at Childers, but the locality not suiting
his health he sold the business to Booker. During 1898
he was elected alderman in the Maryborough Municipal
Council, but on his term expiring, did not seek re-election.
His death occurred at the Maryborough Hospital on Oct.,
1894, in his 89th year, from congestion of the lungs,
brought on by continued attacks of influenza. He left a
wife, Mrs. Kruger, hostess of the Ariadne Hotel, and six
children. Mr. Kruger was very popular, and at much
personal loss took an active part in many political movements
in which his aid was sought. During the elections of 1898
he was chairman at the Annear’s and Power’s meetings, and
was quite at home when addressing Danish or German
constituents. Ernest and his brother were instrumental in
doing much good to the early mineral prospectors, donating
large sums to help them, and they held shares in many
Gympie mines. Deceased was of kindly and genial disposi-
tion, and endowed with true nobleness of nature. He
worked hard for years, and was familiar with the dark as
well as bright side of life, and it is regretted that his
declining years were embittered by the knowledge that
many he had befriended were largely in his debt, and
evidenced no desire to meet their indebtedness to his family.
George Negus,
Builder and contractor ; native of London. Born in 1886.
Arrived in Brisbane in 1856 where, in addition to ca rying
out several large contracts, he built the Bremer Bridge,

Ipswich, at a cost of £7OOO. Having laid the foundation
of a successful business, and contracted for the Queensland
Railway Carriage buil ing, he extended operations to
Maryborough, where, on a large area from his workshops,
some extensive contracts have been turned out. His son
and brother are associated with him in the business which
has suffered by the various fluctuations recently affecting
commercial matters in Maryborough.
Mrs. Margaret Irwin,
Who died at Maryborough December 24, 1895, was one of
the oldest residents of the town and district, being a member
of the celebrated Gregory Family at the “ Old Township. 5 '
On the voyage from Sydney to Brisbane in a small sailing
craft, the crew mutinied, and cast three officers adrift in an
open boat with Mrs. Irwin and her sister, the late Mrs.
Mills, who were with the rest cast ashore on the New
Zealand coast among the Maoris. They remained here till
rescued by the Governor of the island, and taken to his
residence, when passages for them to Sydney by a sailing
vessel was successfully arranged. Young as they then were,
they retained for years a lively recollection of this remark-
able adventure. The remainder of Mrs. Irwin's biography
will be found at page 23. The information above given
was unfortunately supplied too late to admit of its being
introduced in its proper place.
♦
Nicholas Edward Nelson Tooth
Is a son of the late Jno. Tooth, founder of the well-known
brewery in Sydney, where he was born Sept. 7th, 1848.
Educated at Calder House, Redfern, and arrived in
Brisbane soon after Separation. For some years he was
overlanding, but ultimately settled in Maryborough, where,
in conjunction with J. Bryant, they started business as
forwarding agents, auctioneers, &c. Mr. Tooth was a
member of the first escort which brought gold from Gympie
to Maryborough, but in 1878 joined Richard Hughes and
Jonathan Blanchard as senior partner in the firm of Tooth
and Co., of the Vulcan Foundry. Their extensive experi-
ence was soon rewarded by large contracts for mining plants,
sugar mills, and all kinds of machinery now T working at
most of our northern goldfields. Mr. Tooth was elected


alderman in 1879, and filled the Civic chair on five different
occasions. He is a member of the Burrum Divisional
Board and the United Municipality of Maryborough and
Granville. In addition, he is trustee of the School of Arts,
St. Paul’s Church, Director of the Penn Building and
Investment Co., Major commanding the Wide Bay and
Burnett Rifles, member Licensing Board. He was elected
to Parliament as member at the general election of 1896,
as opponent to Mr. J. M. Dawson and the Labour party,
and returned by a large majority. Mr. Tooth is a sup-
porter of the Jockey Club, an enthusiastic sportsman, and
specially interested in cricket, fishing, and aquatic sports.
Mr. Tooth is married and resides in Maryborough, and is
highly respected.
Atticus Tooth,
Born in Kent, England, in 1888, and arrived in Sydney in
1889, where his cousins, Tooth, of brewing fame, were
located. With his brother, W. B. Tooth, he came over-
land to the Wide Bay District, and took up land in
the same selection, 100 miles by seventy, abandoned by
John Eales. In spite of depredations by blacks and lack
of Government protection, they held this run till 1854,
when they sold it to Messrs. R. E. and F. Tooth. Messrs.
Atticus and W. B. Tooth may be regarded as the pioneer
squatters of the Wide Bay and Burnett districts, constantly
travelling and stocking new country till 1856, when A.
Tooth settled on a new station at the head of the Mary
River, Gympie now being a portion of that holding. This
he stocked with 10,000 sheep, but disastrous rains con-
tinuing for nine months caused great loss in stock. He
then resumed his explorations and search for new country
up to 1869, during which he traversed the whole of
Northern Queensland. The experiences of Mr. Tooth,
blended as they are with hairbreadth escapes from
aborigines, droughts, floods and famine, read like a chapter
of romance—although, as is well known by early settlers,
they must stand in part, for much of what they have also
passed through. Mr. Tooth, in 1869, married the daughter
of Mr. D. R. Emmerson, of Bowen, and is regarded as the
father of that town, being the fiyst white settler, and Mr.
Emmerson the second. In the same year he rejoined his
brother as manager of various sheep and cattle stations in


the Wide Bay and Burnett districts, continuing in that
capacity for ten years. On the death of his brother in
1885, he sold several stations, and turned his attention to
agriculture. In 1885, having a large family, he removed to
Brisbane.
James Frost
Arrived in Queensland from London in 1876, and, after
being engaged in a variety of occupations, including the
Government workshops, Ipswich, was promoted to the
position of foreman in the railway workshops at Mary-
borough, and inspector of railway rolling stock, which
office he held for three years, and then left the service to
join Mr. Springall in partnership as engineers’ contractors
and rolling-stock manufacturers at Ipswich. The firm was
established in 1888, and is still among the most successful
in Queensland.
F. G. Popp,
Son of a pioneer settler, was born in the sixties near
Degilbo, Wide Bay. His career affords an example of what
may be done by perseverance. Apprenticed at the age of
12 to Mr. Jno. Travers, cabinetmaker, Queen street, Brisbane,
he came to Maryborough to work with Mr. Henry Smith,
but the wages being small and hours long, he started
business for himself, and in 1884 commenced in a workshop
7ft. by Oft. This he built in 1880, and there he spent his
leisure evenings in making cages, picture-frames and other
articles, which enabled him to buy a large kit of tools. On
starting in 1884, his finances were but 3s. 6d., and a half-acre
of land at Torquay, since turned to account by the erection
of a house known as “ Ozone Villa,” in which he took his
wife, his income then being £4 per week. It was by small
beginnings that the foundations of the large furniture
business known as “ F. G. Popp ” and “ Popp Bros.” were
laid. His brother was a partner and soon after a third party,
Mr. Scott, was associated with the concern. Failing
health caused F. G. Popp to visit Victoria, and in less than
a year he had improved so much as to resolve to settle in
Victoria for the remainder of his life, but being persuaded
by Mr. Scott to return to Maryborough, he came here only
to realise that his partners' had in his absence turned things
to their own account. A dissolution of partnership thus


I
became imperative, and Mr. Popp consented to resign his
interest in the stock-in-trade and business on receipt of an
Undertaking plant, and on the ruins of the “ Federal Com-
pany ” the I.X.L. Furnishing Establishment arose to fame
and success. Here the new-made benedict can obtain all
household requisites on easy time payments (a system origin-
ated locally by Mr. Popp). Every necessary is supplied, so
that the bride finds the house put in order, carpets and floor-
cloths down, curtains hung, furniture arranged, and trouble
dispensed with. This “ Ozone Villa ”at Torquay, of which
he made the whole of the internal fittings, was by his
neighbours designated a “ white elephant,” instead of which
it is one of the best letting properties at the bay. An
OZONE VILLA.
illustration of progress is seen in the fact that when F. G.
Popp established this business in 1892 he had but one man ;
last year about twenty were employed ; and this was accom-
plished in the face of floods, bank failures, and other
disasters, and without resorting to the too handy method of
insolvency. The I.X.L. Furnishing Establishment occupies
a prominent position in Kent street, where it is as well
known as the oldest establishment. F. G. Popp is a “ live ”
man, and never seen squatting on a fence in a silk coat and
slippers watching other folks toil and perspire freely. He
takes a hand in the game of life, is member of the Chamber
of Commerce, father of a family, a member of the Oddfellows
and other societies. He has recently bought the old Tinana


Saw Mills to establish fruit case making, and quite an army
of French polishers, wire workers, mattress hands, cabinet-
makers, wood turners and carvers are busy at his new factory
opposite the railway station. The goods he makes have
gained first awards at Brisbane, Bundaberg, Gympie, and
other exhibitions for excellence and special quality.
W. SOUTHERDEN.
Born in 1882 at the Isle of Thanet, Kent. Learned
drapery business in London, and arrived in Sydney in 1852,
where he engaged with Dawson and Eager. Found his
brother in business in Brisbane in 1854. Came to Mary-
borough in 1857, and opened a store, conducting same
until 1872, when he engaged in mining ventures,
auctioneering and brokerage. Was one of the most active
agents in developing mining at Gympie, and purchasing
gold. One of the first escort in 1867, conveying the
precious metal from that field to Maryborough. He was
also associated with others in forming the Chamber of
Commerce, of which institution he was vice-president. Mr.
Southerden has been a trustee of the Cemetery since its
formation, and connected for years with the Central State
School Committee. He also holds the following offices :
Vice-president of the hospital, member of the Municipal
Council, and was Mayor in 1876. Mr. Southerden is
married, and his eldest son is associated with him in
business, whilst a second son is at Townsville.
Nicholas Cocking,
Native of England, and a resident of the Isis Scrub since
the early sixties, was found dead in his bed at the Post
Office Hotel, Mnrvborough, on the night of the 18th
January, 1896. Mr. Cocking was an able man, and dis-
played much energy in growing experiments for the old
cotton company at Dundatha. He was appointed Govern-
ment Inspector of Timber in 1875, at which period he
settled at Abingdon, and assisted in getting the scrub
opened for homestead selection. He left a grown-up family,
and was a widower.
Samuel Mansfield,
TErated water, cordial, and vinegar manufacturer, was born
in Essex in 1841, and there educated. He arrived in Mel-
bourne in 1862, and, being attracted to mining, spent about


six years in that occupation in Victoria and New Zealand.
On the opening of the Gympie diggings in 1867, he joined
the first “ rush ”to that goldfield as a prospector. As his
brother-in-law, Geo. Sutton, was a cordial-maker in Mary-
borough, Mr. Mansfield joined him, and for twelve years
managed the business which eventuated in a partnership
with Mr. Baker, with whom he purchased Mr. Sutton’s
factory and established it on a more extensive scale in 1869,
and made the business what it undoubtedly now is, one of
the largest and most important cordial and aerated water
factories in Queensland. The extensive plant comprises all
the advanced up-to-date appliances ; the motive power is
supplied by a Bischoff gas engine ; the syrup room is fitted
wtih boiler, cooler, filtering racks and other useful trade
adjuncts for cordials and “ soft ” drinks. During summer,
the hotels and private custom usually absorb 850 dozen
daily, but the factory can double that quantity. Mansfield’s
aerated drinks, lemonade, ginger ale, and specialities are
pleasant and healthful beverages, and it is gratifying to
find that his trade is on the increase, by reason of their
delicious flavour. Mr. Mansfield, who is a leading member
of the Oddfellows and Freemasons’ Societies, accords his
patronage and support to all movements to benefit the spot
of his adoption. He is married, and is assisted in business
by his son.
Elijah Smith,
Born in Yorkshire, England, in 1819. Served apprentice-
ship as carpenter. Arrived in Sydney in 1841 by ship
Ellena, and was soon actively employed in building opera-
tions, including Government House, the residence of Sir
George Gipps. Arrived in Wide Bay November Bth, 1850,
under engagement to the late E. T. Aldridge, and erected
several buildings at the Old Township. He also built the
first store in New Maryborough for the late Robert Travis,
and also a private residence for E. B. Uhr, known later as
the Queensland Boarding House, Wharf street. Mr.
Smith’s services were in request as undertaker, and he
made the coffin for Furbur when that worthy was murdered
by the blacks, and a coffin for Mr. Farquharson, a squatter,
who committed suicide after “ a howling spree ” with some
of the choice spirits ami wild bloods of that period, Mr.
Smith married a servant of Mrs. Aldridge, who had arrived


with that lady in 1849, and by whom he had issue four sons
and one daughter. Their united adventures and hair-
breadth escapes from aboriginals would prove deeply inter-
esting to lovers of exciting exploits. Some years ago Mr.
Smith had the misfortune to accidentally lose an eye, but
beyond this he enjoys good health, and at the age of 77
years is a pattern of a hale and hearty man.
John Walker Cran,
Proprietor, Queen’s Hotel, Townsville, may be regarded as
an early pioneer. Born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in
1842, he was educated in his native town. Emigrated to
Brisbane about 1870, and shortly after entered the employ
of Messrs. Tooth and Cran, of Yengarie, as sub-manager, a
position he held for five years, during which period he
superintended the manufacturing of Liebig’s Extract of
Meat, neatsfoot oil, and the boiling-down and - preparation
of dry smoked tongues. The works were on a large scale,
between 60 and 80 bullocks and 1,500 sheep being killed
daily. As stock became valuable, these operations were
stopped, additional machinery was bought, and the Yengarie
Sugar Mills established. Thus Mr. Cran acquired his
knowledge of sugar-boiling. Leaving this, he became
manager on Macnade Plantation, Herbert River, for Neain
and Co., and later on manager for Beardmore and Omaney,
Bellandon Plains, Murray River, North Queensland,Meadow-
lands and Foulden, Pioneer River, Homebush, and Te
Kowai plantations, most of which he put into working
order. He abandoned sugar-growing in 1885, and settled
at Townsville, where he holds many local offices, including
that of committeeman of the Caledonian Association, and
member of the Municipal Council. Mr. Cran married in
1870, in Maryborough, and is well-known and much
esteemed in this city.
Hugh Graham,
A well-known pioneer settler in the Wide Bay District. He
selected and occupied the Marianna Station and run of
about fifty miles in extent on the Twelve-mile Creek (now
known as Graham’s Creek) in 1848, where for many years
his hospitality and genial manners were the theme of
admiration, and much appreciated by the rough and ready


teamsters who usually made his station a stopping place.
Born at Glasgow, Scotland, in 1816, he arrived in Wide
Bay in the early fifties. The wisdom of his choice as to
runs was seen in the fact that stock thrive well on it, and
the wool from its flocks fetched Id. more in the London
market than that from less favoured runs in the same
district Thrown in contact and closely associated with
men of the rudest tastes, habits, and manners, with
whom all approach to conventionalities of civilization was
distasteful, it is no wonder that Mr. Graham was a boon
companion not only of squatters but shepherds, shearers,
teamsters, “bull-punchers,” stockriders, and aboriginals,
all of whom loved and respected him, whilst the men in his
employ literally revered Graham as a man among a thousand
and a right down “ good fellow,” the last term being as
expressive as though applied to a sovereign ruler. In the
free wild days of the fifties, when every squatter was a
veritable hotel, it was small wonder to find a mild saturnalia
or corroboree after nightfall, when the clans, Scottish,
English, Irish, Australian, and aboriginal met and the
“ loving cup ” went round. Hard drinkers w T ere the
prevailing type of Wide Bay mortals, and woe betide the
poor new chum who could neither fight nor drink, and who
refused to join those who desired his closer acquaintance.
As the author was present at many orgies at Marianna he
can testify to the manner in which Mr. Graham kept unruly
spirits in check—even the most excited of the “ boys ”
submitting to his affectionate rule. The best known visitors
to this station were D. Mactaggart, Paul Lawless, Wm.
Powell, Geo. Bennett, Sandy McDonald, Jack Richmond,
Jimmy Murray, Geo. Pinkerton, and others, most of whom
have gone aloft, but whose memory will be kept in loving
remembrance by the old hands of Wide Bay.
Among one of the noblest traits in Hugh Graham’s
character was his devotion to two sisters in Glasgow, and
to whom he made monetary remittances annually, and at
his decease left his property to them. Mrs. B. Hood, now
of Gympie, is one of these, and Mr. Hugh Graham Hood,
of Cooktown, his nephew.
Andrew Puller and Stewart were overseers at Mari-
anna Station —the first a real “ wild man of the woods”
and a “ terror ” when intoxicated. He died as he had lived,


forgetful of the past and careless as to the future. Stewart,
an Eurasian, a man of unsavoury reputation, returned to
Ceylon, of which he was a native, carrying with him no
blessings for his happiness.
Hugh Graham died on September 28, 1866, 50 years of
age. He was interred at Marianna Station, amid the
surroundings of Nature in which he had lived.
What’er bis faults we should forget them now,
Remembering only good in his career;
Sweet Pity o’er his last lone rest may bow,
And Love bestow the tribute of a tear !
John Purser,
Born February, 1822, at Birmingham, England. Arrived
in Sydney 1850, where he was reporter on the Empire
under the late Sir Henry Parkes. Came to Maryborough
by s.s. Waratah, 1856, and soon after joined Mr. J. Howzer
in storekeeping, the firm of “Howzer and Purser” being
remembered to this day as leading representatives of bygone
trade. After about ten years he started soap manufacture,
which prospered for a time. In 1870 he became a
promoter of the Maryborough Permanent Building Society,
still a leading and prosperous institution. Ever active in
promoting mining and financial business, large mining
ventures have passed through his hands, and he is agent
for and secretary to several companies—fire, marine and
assurance. He was trustee of the Grammar School, and
in 1868 was appointed to the Commission of Peace. His
son (Mr. W.H. Purser), born 1857, is associated with his
father and is captain and adjutant of the Wide Bay
Regiment.
Edward Bernard Cresset Corser,
A native of Warwickshire, England. Was born in 1851,
and received his education in Worcester. Arrived in
Brisbane in 1864, and w r as for three years engaged on the
Maryborough Sugar Company’s Plantation. He gained
experience in various branches of the Commercial Banking
Company of Sydney in Brisbane, Maryborough, and
Gayndah for about four years. In 1872 he established at
the former place a wholesale wine and spirit and general
merchandise business, which has developed into one of the
largest and most important concerns in the Wide Bay


District in which at present the name of Corser and Co. is
a household word. The firm have been instrumental in
advancing the interests of the city and surrounding
districts, and they have invested large capital in erecting
commodious warehouses, offices, and the Grand Hotel. To
Mr. Corser is due the credit of establishing the Chamber of
Commerce, the Fire Brigade, the Town and Suburban
Building Society and Grammar Schools, all of which still
receive his especial attention. He is also member of the
Burrum Divisional Board and Western Railway Association,
and has for many years been a Justice of the Peace. Apart
from his many excellent qualities and affable manners, Mr.
Corser is held in the highest esteem by all who know him,
and he has played no small part in securing the Pialba
Railway for this district as well as the long neglected but
now soon to be Gayndah Railway extension. It is to be
regretted that through serious financial losses, the firm
were compelled recently to seek the protection of the
Insolvency Court, but it is fully expected that with the
season of prosperity likely soon to be inaugurated that the
head of the firm will recover from the calamity which has
overtaken him. This insolvency was gazetted at £81,050
liabilities.
Geoege Sutton
Was a native of Nottingham, England, where his father
had an extensive lace factory. Arrived in New South
Wales in the early fifties, and came to Maryborough as
shipmate with G. E. Loyau and Jno. Towzey, in the brig
Sea Belle in 1856, under engagement to Kehlet and Gill,
hotelkeepers, of Gayndah. After leaving them, he, in
conjunction with Towzey, established the cordial-making
business, and the firm having admitted Carl Zeitz to part-
nership, for about a year was very successful. On the
dissolution of the firm, Messrs. Sutton and Towzey
returned to Maryborough, where the latter, who was truly
the pioneer of the industry, did excellent trade, whilst
Geo. Sutton exhibited his artistic tastes as a painter. He
was of genial temperament and a great favourite, his
deafness alone being a drawback. He married Miss
Mansfield, of Sydney, whose brother, Mr. S. Mansfield,
still resides in Maryborough. Mr. Sutton is better remem-
bered as landlord of the Sydney Hotel, where he lived for


many years, and died in 1898, leaving a wife but no family.
Mrs. Sutton carried on the business till her death in 1895.
Mr. Richard Sutton, painter, of Maryborough, is a brother
of George.
John Towzey , a native of Cornwall, arrived in Mary-
borough in 1856, and after joining Sutton in business in
Gayndah, returned and did well in cordial-making. He
was twice married, his second union proving disastrous to
him, and his death in 1890 was sad in the extreme.
James Bartholomew.
Born in Stirlingshire, Scotland. Was an active, intelligent
and popular citizen of Maryborough, until his death by
drowning in the disastrous floods of 1875. He was then in
O t
his 44th year of age, and gave promise by his activity of a
long and prosperous life. He was one of those men whom
no community can well afford to lose, and his untimely fate
was a source of universal regret. Endowed with great
inventiveness and enterprise, Mr. Bartholomew, who was
associated in the partnership of Messrs. Wilson, Hart, and
Bartholomew, of the Maryborough Sawmills, was instru-
mental in lifting the firm to the leading position it now
holds. Prior to leaving the old country, he was foreman
of Martin and Co.’s Steam Sawmills, Dublin, one of the
largest works of the kind in the United Kingdom. In
consequence of failing health, he came to Queensland in
1862, with his family, of whom Mr. Jno. Bartholomew,
M.P., is a member, and settled in Maryborough, where he
took charge as manager for Messrs. Gladwell and Great-
head’s Sawmills, remaining in that position till he joined
the partnership of Wilson, Bartholomew and Co.
Francis Jeffrey Ivory,
Clerk-at-Arms, Queensland Legislative Assembly, died in
Brisbane, January 20,1896. He resided for several years at
Eidsvold Station, Wide Bay District, and engaged in pastoral
pursuits. He represented the Burnett District in Parlia-
ment from 1874 to 1878. His son, Frank Ivory, has been
for some time a leading spirit in local sports.
Henry Russell,
Explorer, left Brisbane in 1866, via the coast and Noosa
River, having gained information as to the route from the
blacks. After ten days riding he reached the Wide Bay


country and found bushmen cutting cedar. In 1869, Mr.
Russell, accompanied by a party, crossed over to Gympie,
and, struck with the suitability of the neighbourhood from
a commercial point of view, selected 5,678 acres and opened
up communication with Gympie by the Cootharaba road,
cutting through dense scrubs and assisting to form a settle-
ment. Shortly after, Commander Heath visited the bay in
the s.s. Brisbane, and gave unqualified approval of the
port. The first pioneer settlers erected a sawmill, and pur-
chased plant at the Elanda Point Works. The station
owned by Messrs. Russell and Co. is on King King Creek
and in admirable working order. Later on Mr. Russell’s
early exploratory tour and pioneer work are more
intimately detailed.
Joseph Fincher,
A native of Coventry, England. Arrived in Maryborough in
1862, where he located with his family till the discovery of
gold, when, in common with many others, he was in the
first rush to Gympie, working in Nash’s Gully, though not
with great success. On returning to Maryborough he
shortly after became lessee of the Metropolitan Hotel in
Kent street, where he resided till his death in September,
1891, at the age of 65 years. Mr. Pincher was a popular
man, and, though not taking any active part in political
matters, was highly esteemed. His son and daughter still
occupy the Metropolitan, and conduct it on the same
excellent lines as their father.
John Cheyne,
Born and educated in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was a
practical gardener, and for many years devoted attention to
floriculture, and contributed to the Press both of the old
country and Australia several valuable papers on these and
kindred subjects. Mr. Cheyne arrived in Maryborough in
1861, and took great interest in the newly organised Wide
Bay Farmers’ Association, of which he became leading
member, his practical advice with the papers on botanic
subjects he read before members being highly appreciated.
He first rented land at Baddow, from the late E. T.
Aldridge, which he laid out as a market garden, and pur-
chased ground on the spot on which Mr. E. Hanley now


resides. He devoted much time to laying out this selection,
and expended considerable sums on it to little effect, as it
was at a loss that he made fine shade-houses and planted
choice shrubs and trees. He ultimately removed to Tinana,
where he lived till 1890, where he died, aged 73, on his
40-acre selection, known yet as “ Cheyne’s Gardens.’’ He
planted about 1,600 orange trees of various sorts, together
with an endless variety of tropical plants. It is a pity his
enterprise was not better rewarded. His losses were
entailed on his family, and the large garden, yet a monu-
ment of his skill which he struggled manfully to keep in
order, has passed away, and is now occupied by Mr. Eli, by
whom it is kept in excellent order. Mr. Cheyne left a
family of three sons (one since dead) and two daughters,
the eldest son driving the Progress ’bus between Mary-
borough and Newtown, whilst another has the leading fruit
shop in Kent street.
Michael Connors
Is a native of Kilmurray, King’s County, Ireland, where he
was born in 1841. Emigrated to Queensland with his wife
and child by the ship Erin-go-Bragh, and landed in Bris-
bane in July, 1862. Arrived in Maryborough soon after,
where he engaged in dairy farming, contracting and other
matters. He also had a general store at the corner of
John and North streets, and became landlord of the
Southern Cross Hotel in 1889. Mr. Connors is the parent
of eleven children, all of whom were born in Maryborough,
are now grown up, and holding good positions in the com-
munity. One son is in the Telegraph Department, Bun-
daberg; another, Thos. Connors, of Kent street, has shown
considerable enterprise in developing the fruit and wine
industries. Two daughters are married and comfortably
settled. Mr. Connors, now in his 55th year, is hale and
hearty, and has a lively recollection of bygone identities
and local events in the early days. The Southern Cross
Hotel is an old established and favourite house of call, and
largely patronised by local sporting clubs, who hold annual
meetings there.
David Clakke,
Native of Fermanagh, Ireland. Born in 1884. Manifested
liking at early age for chemistry and mechanics. Arrived
in Brisbane in 1865, and started business as a chemist and


druggist. After six years, he removed to Ballard’s Camp
on Main Range, where he opened a drug store. In 1866
he removed to Warwick, and began the manufacture of his
famous eucalyptus oil and liver pills, both claiming highly
curative properties. In 1881 Mr. Clarke settled in Mary-
borough and opened a shop in Kent street for sale of seeds,
medicine, &c., where his affable manners soon made him a
favourite. In 1879 he took the highest award for per-
fumery, and at Melbourne and -Sydney Exhibitions gained
first honours for his preparations of the eucalyptus. He
was a member of the Licensing Board and a J.P., also a
representative of the Polynesian Hospital Committee. He
took great interest in horticultural and agricultural matters,
and contributed several papers of great merit to the Press
on these subjects. Mr. Clarke died in Maryborough in
1891, aged 57.
Thos. Pendergast,
Native of Limerick, Ireland. Born 1824. Learned car-
pentering. Arrived in Sydney, New South Wales, January
9, 1889, where he was in business for eight years as con-
tractor and builder. Went to California in 1849, and was
for three years storekeeping at Sacramento. Returning to
Sydney at the time Hargreaves was prospecting for gold, he
subscribed £IOO towards payment of expenses. Unfortu-
nately Mr. Pendergast met with an accident at the Sandwich
Islands whereby his leg was broken. In 1852 he was
landlord of the Vine Inn, and afterwards of the Hargreaves
Hotel, Sydney. He purchased property at Cook’s River,
but came to Maryborough in 1860, and married the
daughter of the late Mr. McAdams, chief constable. He
took interest in political and other movements, and con-
tributed largely to the charities of the city. After his
death his property in Ferry and John streets was disposed
of by public auction.
Constable McAdams,
The first officer of police stationed at Wide Bay. He
resided for many years at the “ Old Township,” when he was
a terror to evildoers, his zeal for the public weal often
causing him to act indiscreetly. Mr. McAdams was ably
assisted in his efforts to preserve law and order by Mr. Jno.


Harwood, who co-operated with him in his laudable desires.
Mr. McAdams at his death left much property, of which
surviving members of his family are still owners.
Emil Julius Moller
Was born at Copenhagen, 1858, and educated at the
Technical College and the Academy of Arts in that city.
He gained one State and two private bursaries there, which
enabled him to study in Paris from 1881 to 1888. Leaving
his native land, he arrived in Maryborough 1894, and in
January, 1895, commenced to teach painting and drawing
classes at the School of Arts. These having increased,
numbered last quarter 42 pupils. The subjects in these
classes were—freehand drawing, model drawing, drawing
from the cast, and painting. At the beginning of 1896
Mr. Moller was appointed visiting master in drawing and
painting at the Maryborough Grammar Schools, and his
pupils, about 20, are making satisfactory progress under
his tuition. While Mr. Moller’s forte is undoubtedly fruit
and flower painting, he excels in every other line of art,
and has taken first prizes and honours at most exhibitions.
Finding difficulty in dispensing of his works by public
sales, he has instituted the Art Union system, which has the
merit of enabling investors of a small sum to gain a fine
picture.
Peter Piggott
Brought the first sheep from R. Jones’ Barambah Station in
Burnett to Baddow. He delivered 14,500 at Bopple Lagoon
to Mr. G. A. Watson, who depastured them till the flock
was divided, part going to Owanyilla and the rest being
boiled down. Messrs. R. Jones and G. A. Watson arrived at
the Old Township per Aurora in 1843, and the former
selected Barambah Station and occupied it for several
years. Mr. Clapper ton was afterwards associated in partner-
ship, but left in 1860 to take up new 7 country.
John Cobar Anderson,
Shipwright. Born 1860, at Williamstowm, Victoria. Ar-
rived here with his parents three years later. Educated
partly in Maryborough. Served apprenticeship to his father,
Mr. Hugh Anderson, founder of the shipwright business,
which has a patent slip.


Henry Bonarius,
Bom at Rome, Italy, in 1882. Educated in Germany.
Served two years in German Army. Arrived in Mary-
borough in 1854 and settled at Gin Gin, after which he
returned to Maryborough and took an hotel for ten years.
He retired from active life about 15 years ago. He has
held the following offices : —lmmigration Agent for 8 years,
Alderman 10 years, and Justice of the Peace 8 years. He
is married and has eight children, his eldest son being
accountant Q. N. Bank. One of his daughters is the wife
of Mr. E. Booker, the well-known butcher, of Maryborough.
Captain Edward James Boult,
Born 1849, at Great Yarmouth, England. Went to sea at
18 years of age and visited various parts of the world.
Wrecked in 1869 in the cutter Volunteer whilst crossing
Mackenzie Bar, West Coast of New Zealand. Shipped in
1871 in sailing vessel trading between Melbourne and China,
and in 1876 joined W. Howard Smith and Sons’ coastal
service. After eight years, during which he commanded
five steamers, he was appointed in 1886 Harbour Master
at Maryborough, which position he still holds. Captain
Boult has been instrumental in doing much good by his
great experience in nautical matters, and his rescue of a
shipwrecked crew between Point Danger and Cape Byron,
and the picking up a boat’s crew at the River La Plata,
S. America, are deeds of which he may be proud. He is
also regarded as an authority on piscatorial matters.
Wm. Howard,
Arrived in Maryborough January, 1857, when about 19
years of age, since which he has made the Wide Bay and
Burnett districts his home. Describing his experiences he
says “ In 1868 I first saw the Isis Scrub from a hill called
by the blacks ‘Branderie.’ In 1872 I explored it, and
reported on its good lands and timber in Maryborough, and
shortly after that two blocks of 500 acres each were applied
for.” Mr. Howard may fairly claim the title of pioneer
since he was very much mixed up with the rough-and-
tumble times of the sixties. To him is due the discovery
of coal, now being worked by an English company, and Mr.
Howard, after many vicissitudes in the Isis Scrub, settled down


near Gin Gin. His address is “ Sweet Home,” Currigong.
Among pioneering incidents Mr. Howard reports that “ lie
crossed Fraser’s Island from White Cliffs to the sea to find
a wreck in 1859, and in the same year marked out Brangan
Run, on the outskirts of Bundaberg and Barolin Plains,
and inspected the now famed Woongarra Scrub. In Oct.,
1858, Mr. Howard went to the Canoona (Port Curtis) rush
in the Coquette, but returned overland in December, when
in consequence of heavy floods the party had to swim
nearly every creek and river, whilst among the jungles
lining the banks the blacks w T ere very rowdy. Later on Mr.
Howard, with Mr. Willey, found the first payable seam of
coal at Burrum. Mr. Howard’s brother George, known
more intimately by the familiar title of “ Cocky,” kept the
Stem Packet Hotel, Maryborough, and was associated with
T. Hutchins in the attempt to destroy the Corporation
fence and gates erected to enclose the main town reserve.
Charles Faulkner,
Owner of Woodlands, Barolin, Burnett River, one of the
first plantations taken in the Bundaberg District. Mr.
Faulkner first cultivated maize, but after ten years trial
entered the sugar industry with success. The estate com-
prises 872 acres mostly under cane, and he has spent
£4,000 on crushing and milling plants. The mill has an
output of 8,000 gallons of juice daily ; conveyed seven
miles by pipes to the Millaquin Refinery. The mill
and plantation give employment to 10 Europeans and
60 Polynesians. Mr. Faulkner was bom in Lincoln-
shire in 1820. Arrived in Brisbane in 1848. Worked on
the Gympie, Victorian, and California goldfields. Settled
in Maryborough in 1860, and went thence to Bundabem

diovei iO Vide Bay with stock in June, 1863. Having
brought stock to Widgee Widgee, a cattle station, then
owned by Messrs. Tooth and Cran, who were making
Liebig s extract oi beet, he settled, and continued in their
employ for five years. Leaving Widgee for Charters
Towers, Mr. Monaghan was one of the first to open a
payable alluvial claim. After strange ups and downs, he


left for New South Wales, where he bought a mob of
draught horses, took them to Widgee, and sold them at a
profit. He continued to deal m stock, principally draughts
and bulls, and took charge of the Kilkivan Station, Wide
Bay District. Thence he went to Herberton to form a
station, and, after droving about a year, went to Gatton,
where he had a stud of draught and blood horses. He
joined Mr. G. T. Bell, auctioneer, of Brisbane, as partner,
and then went to Loworth, Charters Towers, as manager
for Messrs. J. and W. D. Clark. Mr. Monaghan has been
a successful gold-digger, and is a large shareholder in mines
in various localities. He is at present residing at Charters
Towers.
Henry Barton Watson
is an old pioneer. Born in Malta in 1811. During early
life, imbued with a love for travel, he visited many lands,
including India, Arabia, the Mediterranean, Greece, Italy,
and most of the French historic towns. Arrived at
Melbourne, Victoria, in 1841, and purchased extensive
properties. These he sold, and settled in Sydney, where
he married, and purchased Cunningham’s Gap Station.
Travelling overland, he reached the Dawson, and traversed
the Burnett District, eventually deciding on the purchase
of 27 blocks of land in the Wide Bay District. In 1870
he was appointed by Governor Blackall as South Sea
Labour Agent, and for four years acted as kanaka overseer
at Cecil Plains and Jondaryan stations. In 1879, having
inherited an estate in England, he purchased Mountain
View, near Roma, where he settled with his wife and family.
Mr. Watson has introduced many labour-saving schemes
into Queensland, and was the first to import a hardy strain
of mules from Spain.
Richard Laurence Murray,
Born June 14, 1887, at Longford, Tasmania, and followed
the building trades in Launceston. Arrived with his wife
in Maryborough in 1865, and with his brother, J. A,
Murray, built the first primary school. He next purchased
a butchering business, which he conducted for several years.
In 1877 he leased the Custom House Hotel. His death in
1888 w r as caused by blood-poisoning. His widow subse-
quently conducted the hotel, but resigned in favour of Mrs.


Smith, who is still hostess. He was alderman for many
years ; took part in promoting sports and races ; acted as
M.C. at balls, and supported all movements to benefit the
town and district.

enriched his knowledge by extensive travel on the European
Continent under a clerical tutor. Mr. Uhr, the first store-
keeper, disposed of the business to Mr. Travis who, in
partnership with Mr. Melville, carried it on for many years
successfully. On Mr. Melville’s retirement from the firm,
Mr. Travis continued the business on his own account. He
was the supporter of all benevolent institutions and much
esteemed. He married an adopted daughter of the late
John Foster, of Ireland, who was left his widow in 1887,
and inherited a large property in Maryborough.
John Hood
was born in Ross-shire, Scotland, and favourably known in
his native land and afterwards in Queensland as an active
member and elder of the Free Church of Scotland. He
was a strong supporter of the Temperance Society, and
often spoke at public meetings in its favour. Mr. Hood
arrived with his family in Maryborough in 1872, his wife
taking possession of property bequeathed to her by her
brother, the late Hugh Graham. He did not engage in
business, but led a retired quiet life, which terminated in
1886, when he left a widow and six children. The eldest
daughter is a State school teacher, the second in the
Inquiry Office of the Railway Department; one son is
employed in a local bank ; whilst the other, Hugh Graham
Hood, is in the Railway Department, Cooktown, whither
he was tranferred after an honourable career in Mary-
borough.

William Williams,
A native of Wales. Arrived in Maryborough by ship
Prince Consort in 1864. First engaged in bullock-driving,
carrying wool and station produce from Wide Bay to the
Burnett. In 1878 he opened a drapery store at the corner
of Kent and Bazaar streets, and held two other shops in
Adelaide and Kent streets. About 14 years ago he
established a sawmill at Howard, but, not being successful,
entered into the insurance business and general agency, and
was local representative of the National Mutual Insurance
Company. He took great interest in Wesleyan Church
matters, was superintendent of the Sunday "School, and
senior steward and trustee of the church at the time of his
death, which occurred October 27, 1896. He left a widow,
but no family.
Geo. E. Loyau,
Born in London, England, May 15, 1835. Articled to an
architect and surveyor, and engaged in clerical work till
April, 1858, when he left for Sydney, New South Wales,
whence he went to the Turon and other goldfields, travelling
Bohemian fashion overland to Victoria and More ton Bay.
His first engagement in the Wide Bay District was
as shepherd at Marianna for the late Hugh Graham, and
he was afterwards employed in a similar capacity at
Cania and Yarrol stations, near the Dawson River, at the
time wdaen the Fraser family were killed by the blacks.
After filling an engagement as editor of Burnett Argun , at
Gayndah, for the late Tom White, Mr. Loyau returned to
Maryborough, where his literary abilities were turned to
account on the Maryborough Chronicle , of which Mr. C. H.
Buzacott was then proprietor. His next sphere of literary
labour was in Brisbane, where he was sub-editor and
Parliamentary reporter of the Guardian , under the late
Fairfax and Belbridge. He was also present at the opening
of the first Queensland Parliament by Sir Geo. Ferguson
Bowen. As a journalist, Mr. Loyau has had a varied and
chequered career, having been for over forty years associated
with newspapers throughout the colonies. He is also a
voluminous author, having written 40 volumes of tales,
sketches, poems, essays and novels of a class peculiar to
the Boccasian School. In his 62nd year, though recovering
from a severe paralytic attack, he is still as vigorous

in mental capacity as ever. He is married, and has a
family, together with a large army of friends in each of the
colonies, and few, if any, enemies. Happy they who can
say the same.

PART V.
EDUCATIONAL, RELIGIOUS, SOCIETIES, &c.
ARYBOROUGH is well favoured with
mlllW educational establishments. Aiming at a
high standard, she has succeeded in
making an excellent reputation in the
teaching world, and in place of the primitive methods of
the early “fifties,” when tuition was confined chiefly to
private instruction given in settlers’ homesteads, and
improved upon by Mr. Duncan McNee in the early days of
regular school work, there are now splendidly equipped
State schools, augmented by a fine Grammar School, doing
work equal to the best in the colony. Mr. McNee, who
came from Gayndah, died at Maryborough in 1876, leaving
a daughter, now Mrs. J. Hunter, of Newtown.
Of all the excellent public institutions in our midst the
progress of our Grammar Schools, founded 14 years ago,
arouses the deepest interest. Already 100 pupils have
been enrolled, and with the more prosperous commercial
outlook this number will be augumented. The staff of the
Boys’ School consists of the head master (Mr. Jas.
Thomson, M.A.), Mr. E. W. H. Fowles, M.A., Melbourne
University; Mr. N. Wallace, 8.A., London University;
and Mr. I. A. Dakin, 8.A., London University. It will be
apparent that every advantage is placed before the rising
generation, fitting them for the battle of life in every form,
whether it be the learned professions, commercial, agri-
cultural, scientific careers, or the more numerous skilled
artisans. The conveniences of the boarding establishment
are well-known. Steps have been taken for the cricket and
tennis clubs in connection with the school, and the cadet
corps is to be taken up with vigour again this year. Last
year it numbered 82 members. Our Girls’ School, too, has
invariably been greeted with popular acceptance. The
head mistress, Miss Wilkinson, has that innate enthusiasm


for the cause of higher education which has assured the
success of her pupils. She is ably supported by three
assistant mistresses, a recent addition being Miss Hamilton
in place of Miss Bird. This young lady, like Mr. Fowles,
the classical master of the Boys’ School, held a State
scholarship, and after a distinguished career in the Brisbane
Grammar School, comes with a good record and determina-
tion to do good w r ork for this school. Amongst the
visiting masters, Mr. E. Moller takes the higher branches of
drawing and painting in both schools. The visiting music
masters are Mr. E. Markt, of the Conservatoire of Leipsic,
and Mr. R. Geyger. The drill instructor, who gives
gymnastic training and takes calisthenics in the school, is
the resident drill instructor for the district.

fifth of cost had to be provided by committee, and to do
this they have held concerts, dances, &c., and trips to the
bay, and also procured donations from private sources.


A provisional school was established at Bidwell, in March,
1896, on Government land, near Mr. Frank Hulbner’s farm,
Kirkcnbbin road. Mr. Jas. Bell, of Kirkcubbin, was
instrumental in obtaining large donations towards its
success.

faithfully carried out at a cost of over £2OO by Mr. Henry
Neale, and is expected to prove a great boon to frequenters
of the reading room during the trying summer months,
offering, as it does, a shady and spacious retreat. In order
to commemorate the munificent bequest, which led to the
establishment of our Technological Museum, a marble slab,
“ The Melville Tablet,” has been placed on the first landing
of the staircase, and will serve to perpetuate with gratitude
the memory of the deceased lady. A rainfall diagram,
donated by Mr. J. B. Henderson, has been framed and
displayed in the entrance hall. Two dozen chairs were
added to the already extensive sitting accommodation, and
necessary repairs carried out. A few more chairs or
lounges will be required for the balcony.
“ Technical Classes. —This important branch of the educa-
tional work of our institution has been well maintained,
though a much larger number of pupils could be cared for
by the efficient body of teachers employed. The following
shows the classes, teachers, and attendance of pupils :
Subject: drawing and painting, teacher; E. Moller, No.
of pupils in class: 41 ; shorthand, G. Beer, 15 ; type-
writing, D. Gardner, 2 ; mechanical drawing, Y. Petherick,
26; English, arithmetic, and book-keeping, Jos. Wilson,
11 ; dressmaking, Mrs. Walsh, 11 ; shorthand (elementary),
W. Bullock, 7 ; art needlework, Miss Purser, 4 ; German,
C. H. Barton, 3 ; total, 120. To aid the work of the
drawing classes, models were purchased, both locally and


from Sydney, and the material portion of the teaching
apparatus may now be considered tolerably complete.
“ Lectures . —As an adjunct to the technical class work, a
course of lectures has been arranged, comprehensive
enough to suit all tastes, and so far the attendance has been
gratifying. The lectures already given were in the able
hands of Messrs. Waiter Bentley, C. H. Barton, and P.
O’Kelly, while the further subjects are to be treated by
Messrs. Petherick, Littleton Groom, Professor Shelton,
Dr. Knipe, C. A. J. Woodcock, C. H. Barton, and Miss
Bourne. The fees for this series of lectures have been
studiously kept down to the most popular scale, and a
similar syllabus will no doubt form a regular and attractive
portion of each future year’s scheme of literary entertain-
ment and instruction.
“ Museum . —Your thanks are due to a large number of
donors of specimens for the Museum, and it is pleasing to
note that this portion of your valuable property is becoming
more widely recognised as a suitable treasury lor objects of
curiosity or of educational value. It will be an early duty
of the incoming committee to provide a larger area of
accommodation and protection for the overflow of interest-
ing exhibits now in possession. To Mrs. J. E. Clayton is
due the thanks and appreciation of the members for the
valuable oil painting that has adorned the wall of the
reading room for some years. Whist, chess and draughts
continue to attract a large number of members, and several
matches have taken place. A more than usually large
number of persons from other parts of the colony, as well
as from the sister colonies and elsewhere, have visited the
institution, and in all cases have expressed themselves as
agreeably surprised at the townspeople being the possessors
of so valuable and excellent an educational establishment.
In their opinion, the inhabitants have reason to be proud
of their School of Arts, and such remarks, coming from
those who have travelled abroad, are both gratifying and
encouraging.
“You have again to thank the proprietors of publications
supplied gratuitously :—Gympie Miner, Queensland Mercan-
tile Gazette, The Colonist, Mount Morgan Herald, Bundaherg
Mail, Mackay Standard, Western Champion, Torres Straits
Pilot, Mount Morgan Chronicle , The Week , Toowoomba


Chronicle, Figaro, Cook’s Traveller's Gazette. To the
Government Printer for Government publications ; Hon.
H. S. Littleton, Proceedings of the Royal Geographical
Society; the Sydney University for copy of their calendar
for 1806 ; also Messrs. Howard Smith and Sons and the
A.U.S.N. Co. for useful illustrated handbooks, and Mr.
William Southerden, for kindly assisting at the annual
auction of papers. Your committee have already thanked
Sir Henry Norman, our late Governor, for the presentation
of his photograph as a parting gift, but no apology is needed
for referring here to such a graceful and pleasing keepsake,
and thus publicly recording your unanimous appreciation
of his kind thoughtfulness. In the early part of this year
your energetic secretary enjoyed a well-earned month of
holiday, and in the course of a trip south attended a Con-
ference of Librarians in Melbourne, also keeping in mind
the welfare of our institution by arranging for exchanges of
specimens and studying the various methods brought under
his notice in connection with the professional duties he so
ably fulfils.
“ Mr. E. L. Jackson having been transferred to the Downs
last Christmas, Mr. Robert Jones was elected to fill the
vacancy. Much sympathy was felt for the President of the
Institution, Mr. B. T. MTvay, who was unable, through a
painful accident, to be present at several of the regular
meetings of the committee, to the great regret of his
confreres.
“ Meetings. —Twelve monthly and two special meetings of
committee have been held during the year, and mostly well
attended by members.”

CHUECH OF ENGLAND.
St. Paul's. —The first place of worship for members of
this church was a slab hut at the “ Old Township.” The
first officiating minister was the Rev. E. Tanner, whose
ill-health forced him to resign, being succeeded by the Rev.
Mr. Dodd. In 1856, the late Mr. E. T. Aldridge and
others purchased an acre of land in Adelaide street, and
presented it to the church on the condition “ that it should
be the site of ihe best church in Maryborough, and for
school buildings in connection with its teachings.” Toward
the close of 1856, the old building was removed from its
original site and re-erected in modern Maryborough, where
it stands, an instructive specimen of early Queensland
architecture. For ten years this humble edifice housed the
worshippers under the successive ministries of the Revs.
Dodd, Postlethwaite, Mackenzie and Poole. In 1866 a wooden
church was built, the cost being defrayed by collections.
This building was opened for Divine service on May 27,
1866, by the Rev. H. J. Poole, who left early in 1867 for
Tasmania, and was succeeded by the Rev. H. C. Claughton,
brother of the Bishops of Rochester and Ceylon. 111-health,
however, brought this gentleman’s ministrations to a close
after a tenure of little more than a year, when the Rev. G.
G. Danvers was appointed, but as he left in 1872 for a
curacy in England, the Rev. E. Tanner was inducted into
the rectory of Maryborough. Soon after his accession, the
building, which had been too small for the congregation,
was enlarged, thus making room for fully 400 worshippers.
In 1875, Mr. Tanner resigned, and retired to his plantation
near Bundaberg, being succeeded by the Rev. J, H. L.
Zillman, in 1876. In this year the parsonage in Lennox
street was put in a state of repair.
The Rev. J. H. L. Zillman was succeeded by the Rev.
Thomas Holme in July, 1876, who at once set to work to
free the parish from debt, and erect a church worthy the
name. He was most successful, and the present structure
was opened free from debt on October, 1879. The cost was
£6OOO, of which the Rector gave over £lOOO.
The church is one of the best in Queensland and seats
700 people. Mr. Holme resigned in December, 1880, being
followed by the present Rector, the Rev. Canon Eva.


Canon Eva entered on his parochial duties on January
Ist, 1881. At that period there were only four churches in
the Wide Bay and Burnett districts; one in each place—
Maryborough, Gympie, One-mile, and Bundaberg. He set
to work to provide places of worship for all the country
townships in the Rural Deanery, and in 1884 churches were
built at Tiaro, Gayndah, Tinana, Howard, and Granville.
In 1887 St. Thomas’s, Pallas street, Maryborough, and
Christ Church, Childers, were erected. In 1888 a church
was dedicated at Kilkivan ; in 1890 St. Mark’s, Eidsvold,
was built; and in 1895 Canon Eva was called upon as
Rural Dean to dedicate St. Stephen’s Church, Torbanlea.
Meanwhile the present church at Maryborough was duly
furnished with a splendid pipe-organ at a cost to the
parishioners of £7OO, and an exceedingly handsome pulpit
of Caca stone and marble, the gift of the late Arthur
Brown, Esq. A lectern to match the pulpit was also given
by the late Rev. E. Tanner.
The massive tower, or campanile, standing near the church,
was built in 1887, in memory of Mrs. Maria Aldridge, who
died in 1886. Her husband, Mr. E. T. Aldridge, gave the
tower and peal of nine bells to conserve her memory. This
peal is considered one of the best in Australia. The total
weight is 92 cwt., the tenor weighing 21 cwt. They have
an exceedingly sweet tone, and since their dedication by
Canon Eva on Easter Day, 1888, have chimed and pealed
under the able guidance of a most capable body of
voluntary ringers to the delight of the townspeople
generally.
The latest addition to the parochial buildings is a hand-
some Rectory built in 1895. During the same year another
Rectory was also built at Gayndah for the Rev. Mr. Griffith.
There are now, therefore, in the Wide Bay and Burnett
districts, i.e., the Rural Deanery of Maryborough—lß
churches, 6 rectories, and 18 Sunday schools, while in
1881 there were only 4 churches, 3 rectories, and 4 Sunday
schools. The great difficulty is to find clergymen to fill tht
parishes. The churchwardens for 1896 are Dr. J. H.
Finemore and Mr. C. D. Forster, while Mr. J. E. Noakes if
synodsman and superintendent of Sunday school, and Mr.
A. B. Bland, licensed hon. lay reader. Messrs. Braddock,
Palmer and Hockley are parochial nominators, and Messrs.


H. Palmer, T. R. Dickins, J. E. Noakes, T. Morton, and T.
Braddock trustees of all church property in the parish.
There has been a weekly celebration of the Holy Com-
munion at 8 a.m. since 1881, and there are over 250
communicants in connection with St. Paul’s Church. There
are between forty and fifty Sunday school teachers, and a
voluntary choir ot thirty under the conductorship of Mr. A.
Brooks, while Miss Sarah Thorn presides at the organ.
Messrs. Thorn, Bland and Pywell are Parochial Councillors.
This district is part of the Diocese of Brisbane under the
Right Rev. W. T. T. Webber, D.D., Bishop of Brisbane.
Annual Report, 1896. —“ The income received during the
past financial year, available for payments of salaries and
incidental expenses connected with the church, was £529 4s.
9d.; and the disbursements made for the same period
amounted to £524 Is. 9d. The particulars of the outstand-
ing liabilities, £6B 9s. lid., are shown in the balance-sheet.
The Rector has again offered, in the terms similar to those
contained in the Churchwardens’ report for 1898, to forego
10 per cent, of his annual stipend for the forthcoming year
in order to assist the church funds.
“ The Building Committee appointed at last Easter meeting
for the erection of a new rectory have to report that the
building in Lennox street has been erected at a total cost,
including water, gas, &c., of £621 Bs. 6d. Seven tenders
were received, that of Messrs. Petersen and Sorensen for
£559 ss. being accepted. The plan and specifications were
furnished by Mr. Geo. Negus, free of cost, and the building
carried out under his supervision. To enable your com-
mittee to obtain funds, Messrs. Aldridge and Noakes
guaranteed an overdraft of £SOO to the Bank of Australasia.
Promissory notes, amounting to £4OO, as a counter guar-
antee to Messrs. Aldridge and Noakes, were given by several
members of the congregation, with the expectation that the
subscriptions would be forthcoming before the promissory
notes matured. £207 18s. Bd. has been received, leaving
£425 to be collected.”
St. Stephen's Chur oh (Torbanlea), which was opened and
dedicated by the Rev. Canon Eva, the Rural Dean, assisted
by the Rev. W. Morris and the Rev. W. Marshall, rector of
the parish, is the fifteenth church opened for public worship
in connection with the Church of England in the Wide


Bay and Burnett districts since 1881. The following are
the names of the various churches thus indicated : In the
parish of Bundaberg, St. Mark’s, Gooburrum ; St. John’s,
Woongarra; St. Paul’s, North Bundaberg; St. Mary’s,
South Bundaberg. In the Gayndah Parish—St. Matthew’s
and St. Mark’s, Eidsvold ; St.' Peter’s, Gympie ; St. Paul’s,
Kilkivan; St. Phillip’s, Tiaro. In the Maryborough
parish. Holy Trinity, Tin an a ; St. Thomas , Pallas stieet,
Christ Church, Granville; St. Matthew’s, Howard, and
Christ Church, Childers. Five rectories have also been
built during the same period at Gympie (2), Tiaro, Gayndah
and Maryborough. None of these churches, it is pleasant
to state, have any debt upon the building fund.
The late W. A. Holme, long connected with Christ
Church, Granville, was an earnest worker in a good cause.
This church was erected about 12 years ago. At present
90 children are on the roll. Mrs. Holme is still organist.
The last annual distribution of prizes was made by Rev.
Canon Eva, on the 16th March, 1896.
CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.
This church was inaugurated by the Rev. J. W. Henry
in 1879. After holding services in the Protestant Hall for
about a year, a building was erected at the corner of Alice
and Fort streets. This structure, capable of seating about
800 people, is much admired for the ornateness of its
design and its ecclesiastical style of architecture, and is
still in good preservation. In the year 1881, the Rev. J.
W. Henry retired from the pastoral charge, and was
succeeded by the Rev. J. Whiting. Under Mr. Whiting’s
pastorate the church prospered till 1886, when —having
been much weakened by the retirement of members to
form a Baptist church and other causes —it was unable to
support a pastor, and Mr. Whiting resigned, and in the
following year the church was closed, and remained so till
1891, when, in connection with a “Forward Movement ”
promoted by the Queensland Congregational Union, the
church was re-opened by the Rev. Hopper Joplin, from
England, under a three years engagement to the Committee
of the Union. After endeavouring for two and a-half
years to re-establish the church, Mr. Joplin returned to
England. For’ some months the church was without a


pastor, but through the help of the secretary of the
Congregational Union, the Rev. T. E. Peirce, and other
friends, it was able to maintain its services. In November,
1894, the present pastor, the Rev. J. Carlyon Harris, of
Tasmania, took temporary charge, and after supplying the
pulpit for three months, was unanimously invited to the
pastorate. Under Mr. Harris’ pastorate, the church and its
various institutions have been re-organised, and steady
progress is being made in all departments.
BAPTIST CHURCH.
The present (Fort street) Baptist Church was formed in
September, 1888, during the pastorate of the Rev. B. W.
Clinch. The members and adherents at that time met for
worship in the Temperance Hall, Richmond street.
Twenty-one members were enrolled at the first meeting.
Soon after the church was formed the Rev. B. W. Clinch
resigned his pastorate, and went over to the Anglican
Church. The Baptist Association then sent up the Rev. J.
McPherson from Brisbane, who supplied the vacancy for
several months. During his ministry the allotment whereon
the church stands was secured for £2OO, and an effort made
to raise funds to provide a building. The friends were so
successful in their efforts that in May, 1884, they were able
to accept tenders for the new building at a cost of £482.
The plans of the building were supplied gratuitously by
Mr. R. Gailey ; and Mr. James Robertson, of this city,
supervised the work free. The new building was opened
for worship on September 27, 1885, by the Rev. Henry
Coombs. The first pastor was the Rev. William Bonser,
who began his ministry March 7, 1886. He occupied that
position till March, 1895, when he resigned and returned
to the old country, leaving the church entirely free from
debt, and the membership was 107. He received an enthu-
siastic send-off and purse of sovereigns
His successor is the present minister, the Rev. Charles
Boyall, a young man of considerable ability. Under Mr.
BoyalPs pastorate, the church is making steady progress,
and friends are now about to erect a parsonage.
The church has in connection with it a Sabbath school,
a Christian Endeavour Society, a Ladies’ Sewing Society,

a Zenana Mission Class, a Band of Hope, a Sabbath
evening prayer meeting, and also one every Thursday
evening.
The Rev. B. G. Wilson, of Brisbane, the Rev. J. T.
Hinton, and Rev. J. Wilson were zealous and energetic
pioneers of the Baptist Church at Maryborough and
Gayndah during 1859, ’6O and ’6l.
WESLEYAN CHURCH.
It has been aptly remarked that the churches of Mary-
borough are a feature of interest, and in truth it would be
difficult to find a place of the same size with more sub-
stantial and well-appointed churches in it. The Wesleyan
Church, of which we give an illustration, was built in
1888. The initiative of building was taken in hand during
the superintendency of the present editor of the Wesleyan
journal, Glad Tidings , the Rev. M. Maddern. A con-
siderable sum of money was raised, designs invited, and
large pipe-organ ordered during his term of office. The
actual building and completion, however, were during the
Rev. F. Duesbury’s term. The Rev. M. Maddern, who was
born at Zennor, Cornwall, on July 18th, 1844, arrived in
Australia quite young, and began his ministry in the
Wesleyan Methodist Church, New South Wales, in 1867.
He spent seven years in the Wesleyan Ministry in Queens-
land, including three years at Gympie, three years in Mary-
borough, and one in Rockhampton. He was appointed
editor of Glad Tidings , which has a monthly circulation of
ten thousand, in 1886, and still holds the position. A view
of the first Wesleyan Church erected at Gympie will show
what progress has been made in ecclesiastical architecture.
The old church, which is renovated and used as a
school-room, was built in the early days of Maryborough,
the plans being drawn by the Rev. Thos. Holmes, who now
lives in Leichhardt, New South Wales. The Rev. H.
Woodhouse was the first Wesleyan minister stationed in
Maryborough ;he w T as succeeded in turn by the Rev. C. W.
Hughes and C. Wiles. The pioneer work of those days
was rough enough, but these worthy ministers laid the
foundations of the Methodism which is a flourishing force
for hundreds of miles around. Their names are still
affectionately cherished by old residents, who often speak

of them and their work. One of the oldest of the trustees,
Mr. W. Williams, has recently been called to his reward.
He was a good and loyal worker, and our Church will miss
him much.
The Saturday evening organ recitals in the church
attract large audiences week by week, under the conductor-
ship of Mr. E. Jones. These recitals have taken
immensely with the public, and have proved no incon-
siderable source of revenue to the Trust.
The Rev. Henry Pennington is the minister in charge,
and he is doing a good work, with the loyal co-operation of
the officers and members of the church.
The land on which the Wesleyan Church was
erected was bought from the late Geo. Howard
in 1868, when the Rev. H. Woodhouse arrived
from England to take the circuit. The first services
were held in a vacant building, once a store, in
Adelaide-street, next in the School of Arts, and in Sep-
tember, 1864, the new church was opened for worship free
from debt. The Sunday school was established in July,
1864, under the superintendence of Mr. J. Gee. After a
ministry of two years, Mr. Woodhouse left for Brisbane,
and was succeeded in turns by the Revs. C. W. Hughes, C.
Wiles, H. J. Lavers, M. H. Parkinson, and M. Maddern.
During Mr. Lavers’ pastorate the minister’s house was
built and important additions to the church made. The
cost was in a great part defrayed by a bazaar in 1872. The
Sunday school, always well attended, has a large library.
Mr. R. Jones, the first church steward, is still in Mary-
borough and connected with this church, as is also Mr.
Wiles.
Among early religious denominations may be mentioned
the German Lutheran, Rev. C. G. Hellmuth ; Particular
Lutheran, Rev. C. Copas ; Primitive Methodist, Rev. Joseph
Buckle and Rev. E. Fuller, Gympie ; Deputation from
British Conference, Rev. S. Antliff, D.D.; Baptist, W. T.
Godson.
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
The Sacrifice of the Mass was first celebrated in Mary-
borough in 1852, in the house of the chief constable (Sergt.
Me Adam) at the “ Old Township.” The congregation only

numbered thirty souls. In 1856, Dean Hanley accepted
the tender of Linklater and Thompson for a wooden church
to seat 800 people. It was opened in 1858 by Dean
Rigney, and in 1861 Dean Tissot was appointed by Bishop
of Brisbane (Dr. O’Quinn) the first parish priest of Mary-
borough. Gradually the congregation became too large
for the old chapel, and in 1869, the first stone of the
present handsome church was laid by Bishop O’Quinn.
The architect was Mr. Stanley, and the contractors, G.
Smith and Jesse Thomas. Dean Tissot superintended the
operations of building, which, on its completion, was con-
secrated by him in August, 1871, assisted by the Revs.
Wood, J. J. Horan, M‘Guinness, and Rossilini. The
church is a brick building of the Early English style, faced
with stone, and will comfortably hold about 800 people.
Separating the chancel from the nave is a handsome fretted
screen, the gift of Dean Tissot to the church, which, in a
great measure, owes its erection to his exertions. In July,
1878, Father O’Brien was appointed curate of the parish,
and on the recall of Dean Tissot to France, in July, 1875,
succeeded him as parish priest. A debt on the church of
long standing was more than paid-off by holding a bazaar
in May, 1874. The old chapel is now used as a boys’
school, and attached to the church is a Convent of the
Sisters of St. Joseph, which was established in 1870, and
in connection with this is an orphanage supporting eight
children. The girls’ school, taught by the Sisters has an
average attendance of 125, the number on the roll being
200. The clergy in 1867 were Rev. Father O’Brien,
Maryborough ; Rev. M. Horan, Gympie ; Rev. 0. Rossilini,
Gayndah ; Rev. J. Romani, Nanango and Mount Perry.
MISSION WORK AMONG KANAKAS
Was established in Maryborough by the Rev. C. Christian-
sen. The denomination styling themselves the “ Church
of Christ,” which meets in the Protestant Hall for Divine
worship, held a special baptismal service on Sunday, July
sth, 1896, when eight South Sea Islanders, who had pre-
viously professed faith in Christianity, were immersed.
The hall was filled, many islanders being among the
audience. Mr. F. W. Turley, one of our best gardeners,
who for years has devoted time to the religious teaching of


kanakas employed on neighbouring plantations, conducted
service. In his address he referred to the part the Rev. C.
Christiansen had taken in this work while in Maryborough,
and how he (Mr. Turley) had since continued the work,
which he hoped others would now take up, as he might not
be able to continue it much longer. He had been suc-
cessful in this missionary work among the islanders, and
had baptised many of the boys. He defended the sacra-
ment of baptism, as enjoined in Scripture, and asserted
that immersion was the mode taught, and not sprinkling
by water. Faith and baptism were each necessary, and
both commanded by Christ, and no Christian could be
worthy of the name who did not confess his faith. The
boys to be baptised that day had been taught an intelligent
belief in the Scriptures. He had spoken to their employers,
and had received high commendation of their good conduct.
As for his authority to baptise the boys, he quoted Christ’s
command to go and teach all nations, baptising them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
These were his marching orders which he must obey. Two
kanakas afterwards gave short addresses, counselling the
candidates to continue in their good work, and see that
their names were not rubbed out of the Book of Life.
They pointed out that though not white, they were equally
the creatures of God, who had made of one blood all the
people of earth, and that while their hearts were white,
the colour of their skin was of no consequence in God’s
sight. The boys, eight in number, were then immersed by
Mr. Turley, a verse of a hymn being sung after each
baptism. Charley Erromango, another islander, spoke,
and confessed that before becoming a Christian he had been
a very “ naughty boy,” and had even found his way into
the lockup. Now his life was different, and there would
be no more lockup for him. The boys spoke earnestly and
intelligently, but of course in broken English. The services
were concluded in the usual manner.


SOCIETIES, ASSOCIATIONS AND CLUBS.
Wide Bay Pastoral and Agricultural Society. —The off-
spring of the parent society, which, under the name and
title of The Wide Bay Farmers and Planters’ Association,
had its inception on October 5, 1867, on which date a
meeting, convened by Jas. Dowzer, was held. The pro-
ceedings were characterized by great enthusiasm. Mr.
Dowzer occupied the chair, and the following members
were enrolled :—Messrs. Walter Adams, Geo. Richards,
James Dowzer, Henry Fox, John Cheyne, Win, S. Roberts,
Geo. Curtis, and Wm. Keith. Mr. Win. Roberts was
elected treasurer, and Messrs. Walter Adams and Geo.
Curtis joint secretaries, pro tern. The Provisional Com-
mittee appointed to form a code of laws and attend to
other matters were:—Messrs. Jas. Dowzer (chairman),
Jno. Cheyne, Geo. Richards, Frederick Hill, Geo. Curtis,
Walter Adams.
The next meeting was held at the Council Chambers,
Maryborough, on November 2nd, 1867. Present: Messrs.
Jas. Dowzer, Jno. Cheyne, W. Adams, Geo. Richards, Geo.
Curtis. Code of rules, prepared by Mr. Jno. Cheyne, on
the lines of the Toowoomba and East Moreton Associa-
tions, were decided upon, and a schedule drafted. Mr.
Elijah Watson was elected a member. From this period
the society increased its membership, and its members

*Note. —The author is indebted to Mr. Jas. Dowzer, of Tiaro, for
the copy of minutes of the society, the reproduction of which here
cannot but be of interest to our agriculturists.


The first general meeting was held at Council Chambers,
Maryborough, November 2, 1867. Present: Messrs.
Dowzer, Cheyne, Adams, Richards, and Curtis. Rules and
code of laws, drafted by Mr. Cheyne, were submitted, dis-
cussed, and decided upon, and it was unanimously agreed
that the secretary should write to John Eaton, Esq.,
requesting permission to nominate him as president of the
society, and to Mr. Thomson, of Loudon, to be nominated
as vice-president. On November 80th the association was
in full working order, and its manifesto set forth its objects
as the promotion of agriculture and horticulture, and of all
articles of manufacture connected with same, by means of
periodical meetings for members to mutually interchange
ideas on all subjects connected with rural economy, and to
foster a spirit of friendly emulation by the institution of
one or more competitive exhibitions annually, the same
to be field and garden produce, and any description of live
stock, dairy produce, machinery, implements of husbandry,
&c. Monthly and quarterly meetings were to be held for
the reading of original papers, discussions on subjects
bearing on the interests of the society, and exhibits made
of articles of special interest. The management of the
society was vested in a president, vice-president, secretary
and committee of five, elected by subscribers at the annual
general meeting, except the secretary, who was appointed
by the committee. The general meetings of members were
held every year in January, when the annual report was
read and adopted, officers elected, and other business
transacted. No general meeting was considered properly
constituted unless nine members were present, though, if
such meeting were adjourned, at the next meeting seven
members would be sufficient. Entrance fee, 2s. 6d., and
annual subscription, 10s.; life members, £5. All payments
by the society were by cheques signed by the committee,
and countersigned by the secretary. At committee
meetings three formed a quorum. On November, 2, 1867,
John Eaton, Esq., was appointed president, and Jno.
Meiklejohn, Esq., vice-president, and the following elected
managing committee :—Messrs. Hill, Cheyne, Adams,
Dickinson, and Fox. From this time the society made
rapid progress, and its monthly meeting, February i, 1868,
was well attended, and a highly interesting paper read by


Hy. Fox, “On the Cultivation of the Cotton Plant,”
especially the Sea Island variety, as suitable to the district.
Samples of the “White Wantage” and “White Sweet
Water” grape were shown by Mr. Cheyne, not for com-
petition. Pineapples were shown by Mr. W. Adams, who
took the prize with fine fruit from Mr. Murray’s farm,
Tinana Creek. Mr. Bromiley proposed, and it was agreed
to, that the subject for discussion should be “ The Cultiva-
tion of the English Potato,” and that Mr. Geo. Richards,
a successful cultivator, should read a paper on the subject.
Some cigars made by W. H. Archer were tested, and pro-
nounced a creditable local production.
On 4th April, 1868, at a meeting, a letter was read from
the Hon. Gilbert Elliott, expressing his willingness to
become patron of the society. A first prize was awarded
by the judges, Messrs. Harwood and Simpson, to Mrs.
Dowzer for first-class butter, after which “ Dairy Manage-
ment ” was the theme of general discussion.
On May 2, 1868, seven samples of cotton were shown,
and submitted to tests by Messrs. Shaw, Butler and Fox,
experts. Messrs. Bromiley and E. Watson’s were equal in
point of excellence, and Messrs. Thos. Watson and Butler
in second quality, the land on which their cotton was grown
being unsuitable for a first-class article. It was stated
there were 86 farms with acreage under cotton, the aggre-
gate amount being 273 acres. Suggestions as to forming
a joint stock company to utilise local cotton products was
mooted, and a highly instructive paper on “Cotton Culti-
vation ” read by Mr. W. G. Bailey, giving the result of
experiments made with Sea Island cotton, New Orleans,
and the Kidney-seeded cotton of South America. Sug-
gestions as to starting a branch of the association on the
Upper Mary were favourably received. The following were
added to membership on this date :—Plon. W. H. Walsh,
M.L.A,, Messrs, Bromiley, A. McWaters, Shaw, and J.
Butler.
On June 6, 1868, during a discussion on “ Maize,” one
cob, exhibited by Mr. E. Watson, having nearly 1,000
grains, whilst Mr. Bromiley showed a sample of 40-bushel
corn to the third of an acre. The Tuscarora corn was con-
sidered the best of all for meal, though found susceptible to
weevil. Fifty bushels per acre was the average crop.


Mr. Ingham exhibited some “ Poor Man’s ” oranges, 21bs.
weight, grown on the Mary River, and demonstrating its
suitability for the culture of this fine fruit. The following
members were enrolled:—Messrs. G. Douglas, A. Moffatt,
W. Carruthers, Joseph Benson, Jas. Rankin, Samuel
Bensted, S. A. Fraser, W. Kelly, W. McDonald, and Senior
Scott.
July 4, 1868. —“ Sugar Cultivation” formed the subject
of an interesting discussion, and a highly interesting paper
by Mr. Hill, of Scarva, was read. Mr. R. Ferguson,
Lumeah Farm, Graham’s Creek, submitted samples of
Broad Dutch, Virginia, Kentucky, and Havanah tobaccoesin
leaf and manufactured, showing the suitability of the Mary
River soil for their culture. Messrs. J. E. Browne, E.
Martin, and R. Ferguson were enrolled members.
August 8, 1868. —Mr. Cheyne read an elaborate paper to
show that “Queensland farmers are in a position to compete
advantageously in the cotton and sugar markets of the
world, with the hindrances to success.” This was negatived
by Mr. W. G. Bailey, who, in reply, endeavoured to show
that our failure in this respect was want of suitable and
well organised labour.
November 12, 1868. —Meeting decided as to desirability
of holding public exhibition of general produce, &c., on
New Year’s Day, 1869, and committee appointed to make
arrangements.
January 18, 1869. —Mr. Cheyne appointed hon. sec. at
salary of T2O per annum, Mr. Jas. Dowzer, assistant secre-
tary, Mr. Simpson, chairman.
March 22, 1869.—Mr. R. B. Sheridan read a paper on
“ Breeding and Management of Domestic Fowls.” Mr.
Howard suggested formation of library, and offered books.
June 28, 1869. —Messrs. R. B. Sheridan and Howard
presented several volumes on “Poultry Breeding, Farming
and Gardening ”to the society. Mr. Cheyne read an
interesting paper on “ Orchard and Fruit Culture.”
November 20, 1869.—Public meeting held, Captain
Jeffreys in the chair, to discuss advisability of erecting sugar
mill on the Mary River. Messrs. Dickinson, Hill, Howard, and
Captain Jeffreys were appointed a committee to communicate
with the various engineering establishments as to cost of
floating sugar mill capable of manufacturing two tons of


sugar daily. This report was brought up later on, when it
was stated that £6,000 would be required. The committee
also offered prize of £lO 10s. for best plan of mill of suitable
power and capacity, and Mr. John Murray, engineer, sub-
mitted such plan, but nothing was then done from absence
of funds.
At quarterly meeting, June 4, 1870, Mr. Jas. Dowzer
read paper on “ Dairy Management,” the importance of
which subject evoked considerable interest and comment.
September 8, 1870. —Mr. Jno. Eaton donated £2 2s.
towards prize for best cultivated five acres sugar cane in the
district.
November 28, 1870. —Messrs. Barnett and Powell
appointed auditors. Mr. O’Kelly pointed out that farming
properly conducted would pay, and that with machinery
profits on farming produce increase in proportion. This
was in contradistinction to the assertion that farming would
not pay in these districts.
January 6, 1872. —Several rules were revised, altered,
or amended, and the following appointments were made :
President, Hon. W. H. Walsh, M.L.C.; vice-presidents,
Wm. Southerden, Peter O’Kelly ; treasurer, Hy. Steward ;
committee, Messrs. Cheyne, Groundwater, H. Fox, W.
Canny, R. Ferguson, Ingham, E. Watson, J. Simpson, A.
Dunn, T. Anderson, W. Southerden ; auditors, J. Purser
And Allbon.
Maryborough Temperance Societies were inaugurated
in August, 1872. The first was the
Band of Hope, formed by the United Temperance
Societies, in the hope of inducing the young to join it.
The first office-bearers were:—President, Rev. M. H.
Parkinson ; vice-president, J. Pyne ; secretary, H. Smith ;
committee, Messrs. T. P. Peat, E. Whitehead, J. C.
Halliday, G. Jones, T. T. Woodrow, R. Jones, W. A.
Holme. Meetings were held every alternate Fridays in the
Temperance Hall.
About the same period, viz., May, 1872, the
Sons of Temperance, Self-help Division, Maryborough,
were organised by the following :—Bros. T. P. Peat, W .P.;
H. Turner, W.A.; J. C. Halliday, R.S.; J. Pyne, F.S.; W.


A. Holme, treasurer ; Rev. M. H. Parkinson, chaplain ; J,
Parker, conductor; F. Krebs, A.C.; G. Ree, J.S.; E.
Walden, 0.5.; G. A. Watson, P.W.P.; Dr. Lane, surgeon.
This society met at J. C. Halliday’s store, Adelaide street,
every alternate Friday at half-past 7 p.m. The Sons of
Temperance are a benefit society, founded on strictly
total abstinence principles. Founded in New York in
September 29, 1842. Eleven years after it spread to
England and through the United Kingdom. The Self-help
Division was opened in Maryborough by the Rev. E.
Griffith, D.M.W.P., father of the present Chief Justice
of Queensland, on May 2, 1872. Branches of this society
are established throughout the Australian colonies, and the
Order is strong in membership.
With equal claims to support are the
Independent Order of Rechahites, District No. 87,
Hope of Queensland Tent, No. 6. —Bros. D. M. Crowley,
Chief Ruler ;W. Blanchard, Deputy Ruler; G. Jones,
treasurer ; G. Penberthy, secretary. This body meets at
the Temperance Hall on alternate Mondays. This “ Tent”
was opened by Bro. D. M. Crowley on September 16, 1874.
. Independent Order of Good Templars, Hope of Mary-
borough Lodge, No. 14.—Bros. J. C. Halliday, P.W.C.T.;
J. B. Price, W.C.T.; Geo. Simpson, W'.V.T. ; Geo.
Clowes, W.S.; G. F. White, W.F.S. ; Jno.'Hanson, W.T.;
Rev. W. T. Godson, W.G.; H. T. Halliday, W.M.; R.
Hibbard, W.I.G. ; H. Haybittle, W.0.G.; Geo. Walker,
W.A.S.; Bro. J. Pyne, W.L.D.; Sister Fanny White,.
W.D.M. ; Sister Jane Cane, W.R.H.S.; Sister S. Gregory,
W.L.H.S.
W.C.T, and “F.” Union (Oct. 27,1876). —The “Y” Union
was organised by Mrs. E. B. Harris in 1890, and has now 88
active and 18 honorary members on its roll. The numbers
have decreased rather than increased owing to removals
from town. Eighteen ordinary and three special meetings
have been held during the year. No fresh departments of
work have been added to the list this year on account of so
few of the members being able or inclined to take active
work ; still, under the leadership of our energetic and now
ex-president, Miss Stupart, progressive work has been
accomplished in the four departments undertaken.


The Loyal Temperance Legion, which had been dis-
banded some six months before, was reorganised by Miss
Ferguson last August twelve months, when names of 80
children were placed on the roll. Meetings were held
fortnightly until Christmas recess, but were not resumed
until May. The children were under a great disadvantage
last year, having no appointed leader, but since Miss
Ferguson has undertaken the responsibilities of the position
with the help of Miss Stupart, all fears concerning its
success have vanished. The little ones enjoy and are
interested in lessons prepared for them. A tea was given
to the children by the members of the Union on the day of
reorganisation, and the first meeting of this year took the
form of a concert given by “Y ” members. The meetings
are held fortnightly on Saturday afternoons in the Presby-
terian Sunday school-room, which has been given free of
charge. We appeal to parents to encourage their children
to join this loyal band of young people, and be early
grounded in the principles of temperance. The flower
mission department is worked by both unions, each taking
alternate months, when the Hospital is visited weekly with
flowers and texts for distribution among the patients.
Twenty-six garments were made and handed over to the
Benevolent Society last Christmas for distribution to needy
families. Through the kindness of the Press, the superin-
tendent of this department keeps half-a-column in the
Saturday’s issue of the Chronicle supplied with temperance
notes, and also sends reports of meetings. Fresh vigor has
been given to this branch by the new and able superin-
tendent, Miss Adam.
The special work of the year has been—helping with
united temperance meetings ; l a tableau and concert enter-
tainment, an “ at home,” a garden party, and collecting for
Hospital Christmas dinner. The Union’s contribution
towards the programme of the monthly united temperance
meeting is generally two solos. The usual Christmas tree
and tea was abandoned this year on account of the large
proportions it had assumed, and instead money was raised
for the Benevolent Society—to distribute the gifts among
the poor—by a garden party given by the Women’s Union
and “ Y’s ” combined in the beautiful grounds of the Hon.
A. Heron-Wilson, which were most generously placed at


their disposal. As a result £lO were handed over to that
society. For several years past the Union has collected
for the hospital dinner, but this year with greater success
than formerly, £lO being collected for the General Hospital
and £2 2s. for the Lady Musgrave. This sum entitled the
Union to twenty hospital tickets, for distribution.
The balance sheet for the year ended August 81st, 1896,
shows total receipts of £2l 18s. 5Jd., with a credit balance
of £8 Bs. OJd.
Ladies' Benevolent Society. —Members :—Mesdames Pryce,
Roberts, Knipe, Foran, O’Brien, Brennan, and A. Heron-
Wilson. This society has done great good in Maryborough
in times of depression, and the ladies who work for the poor

support in their endeavours to relieve suffering and distress.

Caledonian Society is, as its name implies, essentially
Scotch, and strongly supported by many of the sons of
Caledonia, who yet cling with affection to the customs and
ceremonies of the “ land of the mountain and the flood,”
and the national gatherings and sports which take place


strongly savour of auld Beotia, whilst at the grand banquets
in honour of Scotland’s patron saint or in memory of
Robert Burns, the “ gathering of the clans ” is in advance
of that which takes place in other northern towns. The
Hon. A. H. Wilson, M.L.C., is a patron of the society, and
Mr. Jonathan Murray is much in evidence as president at
all times. The following officers have been appointed for
the ensuing twelve months :—President, Mr. John Murray ;
vice-presidents, Messrs. F. E. Smith and Jas. Sim (tertius);
secretary, W. R. Mitchell; treasurer, C. L. Gibson ; com-

Local turf matters have always excited attention
of the larger portion of our population, and from
its inception Maryborough racing has been in good hands,
and its patrons and supporters leading members of society.
Since the winter meeting of the Jockey Club in June last,
turf matters have been quiet, but interest is now being
evinced in the Christmas and New Year meetings which
usually pass off with eclat and attract many visitors. Local
horses are well cared for by an experienced trainer, Mr. E.


Hastings, who has now several well-bred horses under his
care, and a visit to his stables in Ellena street, Maryborough,
will prove that Wide Bay can produce racing stock superior
to most other localities in Queensland.
Maryborough Jockey Club. —President, Dr. H. C. Garde;,
vice-president, W. J. McGrath ; committee, Dr. Garde, W.
J. McGrath, M. A. Phillips, W. Burke, T. B. Smyth, J.
Perel, P. Tuohy, H. E. Bray, J. Mahoney; treasurer, M.
A. Phillips; secretary, A. Boldery. Membership nearly
100. Local racing dates back to the early sixties, when
some good contests took place privately between stockriders
and others, not on regular course but in the bush, and it
remained for a modern period to bring racing matters to
perfection. The Maryborough Racecourse is situated about
If miles from the post office, on the main road to Pialba,
and consists of level ti-tree land, owned by the Municipal
Council of Maryborough. The course is about nine furlongs
round, and considered one of the best and fastest in the
colony. There is a splendid grand stand capable of seating
500 people; the usual sheds at the back are enclosed with
galvanised iron, in which is the totalisator shed alongside
the course, and jockey stand. Underneath the grand stand
is the publican’s booth, weighing room, ladies’ room, and
conveniences. There is a training track on the outer edge
of the course proper, always in good working order. The
club generally holds about four meetings annually, the
annual two days’ meeting taking place about the middle of
June.
Football clubs of Maryborough comprise—Comets,
Wallaroos, Rovers, Turkeys, and Senior Turkeys, Vic’s, and
others, ail full of life and vim, and eager to sustain the
honour of their respective factions. Well contested
matches have been played on the Show grounds. Visitors
are treated with civility, and find a hearty welcome from
the local clubs. The rough-and-tumble play so noticeable

“ locals ” come into collision with the Gympie Hornets the

A well-contested match was played between this club and
the local Turkeys at Maryborough July 5, 1896. A hearty
welcome was accorded the visitors by Mr. J. M. Stafford,
Mayor, President Rugby Union, and the proceedings were
characterised by perfect order and good feeling. The
Turkeys, who made 6 goals to Gympie’s nil, naturally felt
inclined to “ gobble up ” their friendly antagonists.

Amusements.
Maryborough is not behind in this respect. Pleasant
outings and harbour excursions are of constant occurrence,
and the “ Muriel Bell,” a handsome seaworthy craft, is in
constant requisition in clear and exhilarating weather.
The trip to the “ Heads,” or White Clift's, in the bright
moonlight, is well worth remembering ; and during each
year numbers of these enjoyable excursions, at cheap rates,
take place. Healthy rivalry is maintained between the
steamers “Muriel Bell” and “ Lewellyn ” on holidays,
both well patronised, and no casualties have been reported.
At the Newtown Gymnasium several attractive tourna-
ments have taken place. Boxing is to the front, and the
“ fancy ” have tried conclusions to their hearts’ content.
The Maryborough Operatic Society , which has been recently
augmented, is very popular in the community, and has
done much to popularise good music.
Since our Biographical Notices went to press, we regret to
learn of the death of Senior-sergeant Gallagher, on March
3rd last. The deceased had for months past been in
precarious health, which caused much anxiety to his
family and a wide circle of friends. The sad news will be
received with deep regret, not alone in Maryborough, but
by scores of old identities throughout the Burnett and
Darling Downs districts. Born in Donegal, he early
joined the Royal Irish Constabulary in Dublin. In 1862
he arrived in Queensland, and joined the Mounted Police,
then doing hard pioneering work, of which a full share fell
to the late senior-sergeant, then working between Too-
woomba and the New South Wales border. In 1867 he
was selected to form one of the gold escort from Gympie to
Maryborough. In 1870 he was appointed to Bundaberg,
and “blazed” the first track thither. Shortly after he
went to Gayndah, and during the next ten years visited on
duty every part of the Burnett District. He was next
transferred to Howard, and in 1885 appointed to Mary-
borough, and at the time of his death had been about 88
years in the Queensland Police Force. He was a zealous
officer, well informed, and of kindly disposition, and
invariably earned the respect and esteem of all who knew
him. He leaves a wife and grown-up family surviving.


PART VI.
LOCAL INDUSTRIES.
Walkers Limited.
largest industrial concern in Maryborough,-
and P° ssibl 7 in tbe colony of Queensland, is
that of Walkers Limited, ironfounders, en-
gineers, bridge and shipbuilders. Established
in a small way in 1868 as a branch of the then parent
establishment of John Walker & Coy., of Ballarat, Victoria,
the works have grown year by year, until they stand pre-
eminent among the industries of the colony. Many of the
most important public and private undertakings in Queens-
land have been entrusted to this Company, and the name
of Walkers Limited is to be found stamped on railway
bridges, dredges, dredge plant and mining machinery, from
one end of the colony to the other. During the first decade
the operations of the Company were confined to miscel-
laneous ironwork and mining and sugar machinery, but in
1878 contracts with the Government for the building of
dredges, steam hopper barges and tug steamers made it
necessary to plan out and erect large shipbuilding yards.
This was accordingly done, and two fine dredges—the
Maryborough ” and the “ Saurian ’’—were subsequently
launched from the yards, the workmanship meeting with
the warm approval of the Government officers. Work of a
similar kind followed speedily, and eight steam hopper
barges and two steam tugs were soon launched from the
stocks. The Company also undertook the task of building
a lighthouse on the North Beef, some thirty miles from
Keppel Bay, a work which under considerable difficulties
was carried out successfully, and proved an immense
advantage to oversea shipping. The Maryborough and the
Gympie Gasworks were the production of the Foundry, and
the whole of the ironwork for the bridges of the Bundaberg-
Gladstone, Cairns, Croydon and Cooktown railway lines
bear Walkers’ impress. Ironwork for the Boyne and Kolan


railway bridges was also constructed by the Company, while
they supplied all the substructure and cylinders for the
Burnett Bridge, and now have in hand the contract for
supplying all the cylinders and ironwork for the Pioneer
Railway Bridge. They have just completed the important
work of supplying all the cylinders for the new Victoria
Bridge in Brisbane, now rapidly approaching completion.
The more important work in connection with the gold-
fields of the colony has fallen to Walkers, including the fine
winding engines and gear used by the well-known Mills’
United Mine, as also winding plant for Brilliant Extended
and Phoebe mines, all of Charters Towers. A sectional
engine and portable battery were recently built for the
Walter Hodgson Gold Mines, Lid., of Goldsborough, near
Cairns —a special feature of this machinery being that no
part weighed more than 4 cwt. to enable its being trans-
ported on horse or muleback over the rough ranges. A fine
pair of winding engines has just been completed for the
Brilliant Central of Charters Towers—in fact Walkers’
quartz crushing batteries and winding engines are to be
seen on nearly every goldfield throughout Queensland.
Sugar machinery constitutes a speciality of this Company.
In addition to supplying all the ordinary machinery for
some years past for the various district sugar mills, they
have, since the inception of the Central Sugar Mills
Guarantee Act, been eminently successsful in securing
several contracts for Central Mills. The Marian, Mount
Bauple, Gin Gin, and Plane Creek Central Mills have been
successfully turned out, the Proserpine Central Mill is
nearing completion, and the contract for the Isis Central
Mill at Cordalba has just been secured. The machinery
for these mills comprise all the modern up-to-date improve-
ments, &c., consisting of triple efiet evaporators, vacuum
pans, filter presses, mechanical strainers, clarifiers, contin-
uous subsiders, cush-cush elevators, automatic megass
stokers, mechanical megass pushers, cane carriers,
macerating carriers, <fec., &c. In addition to the foregoing
a juice mill of the most modern design, and replete with
latest improvements, was erected by this Company
some years ago at Doolbi; also a complete sugar mill plant,
on similar lines to the Central Mills, has been completed
and erected for the Maryborough Sugar Factory, Limited,


WALKERS LIMITED.


while a third new cane mill for Messrs. Gibson & Howes,
of Bingera, is in hand and well on the way to completion.
Walkers Limited have during the year (1896) added a
new and important branch to their already extensive and
thriving industrial manufactures. They were the successful
tenderers for the construction of thirty locomotives for the
Government, and are now actively engaged on the work.
It is expected that the first two engines will be ready to leave
the works by the end of the year.*
The principal engineering works are in Bowen street on
a commanding site, and occupy an area of about five acres
of ground, the major portion of which is roofed in. In the
smithy are three powerful steam hammers and ten fires,
together with wrought-iron scrap furnace, where the
Company make their own forge-bars. The moulding shop
is 165 ft. long by 80ft. wide, and here the metal and coke
are hoisted by power to the cupolas ; there are two furnaces
capable of melting fifteen tons per day. The shop is fully
equipped with travelling cranes, core-drying stoves, and all
necessaries. A cast-iron patent collapsible core is used
daily in the making of cylinders, and the saving in bricks
and labour is very considerable. Adjoining the moulding
shop is the pattern store, containing the accumulations of
twenty-five years. In the pattern-makers’ workshop there
is a Yankee trimmer, a labour-saving machine of very
ingenious type, planers, bandsaws, circular saws, and all
modern appliances. The tool shop is well supplied with
modern machines of the most approved workmanship,
containing among others, a large face lathe capable of
taking 20ft. in diameter, heavy planing machine capable of
working sft. square, milling machine, while there are
numerous lathes, planing machines, slotting and shaping
machines, radial drills, gear for turning bridge cylinders,
&c., &c. In the brass moulding shop are three annular
furnaces (Fletcher’s patent), and close by is a well-appointed
coppersmith’s shop. On each side of the tool shop are
galleries fitted with small lathes, screwing, drilling, and
milling machines. One gallery is set apart as a brass-
finishing department, and the Company justly pride them-
selves on the excellent way in which all brasswork leaves

their establishment. Overhead travellers are in every part
of the foundry. The erecting shop has two very powerful
overhead travelling cranes and six smaller ones, and all
requisite appliances for handling heavy machinery—among
others may be mentioned a hydraulic press for pressing
sugar mill rollers on to their shafts, and is capable of
exerting a pressure of 200 tons.
The latest addition consists of a spacious new smithy,
measuring 180 ft. by 66ft., just erected ; this will be equipped
with about 20 fires.
In the shipbuilding yards, situated on the banks of the
river, there are three overhead cranes, large plate-bending
furnace, hydraulic boiler-rivetter, capable of exerting a
pressure of 60 tons, three portable hydraulic rivetters for
bridge work, plate-rolling mill with necessary shearing and
punching machines driven independently, straightening
machines, radial drills, multiple and countersinking drills,
and a special machine for boiler drilling. These yards
cover six acres of ground and are connected with the
principal works in Bowen street by tramway. On the river
bank are fine wharves, stores and everything necessary for
the conduct of a shipping business of very large proportions.
There is a branch of the Maryborough-Brisbane Railway
laid into the shipyard, thus affording perfect communica-
tion either by rail or water. The offices in Bowen street
are w r ell lighted, roomy and comfortable, while upstairs are
spacious rooms where all the varied draughting of the
Company is carried out.
In 1884 the business was converted into a limited
liability company, with a capital of £IOO,OOO, of which
£68,730 is paid up. Over 400 men are employed, and
many of the employees are shareholders in the concern.
Vulcan Foundry,
Established by R. Hughes and Co., in 1874, is in
Richmond street, Maryborough. The main building is
upwards of 200 ft. long by 30ft. wide, with pattern-shop
50ft. long, and side skillions adding a further wfidth of 15ft.
This is divided into a moulding shop (60ft. long), turning,
erecting and carpenter’s shop. A large brick drying-house
in the moulding shop can take moulds for castings 12ft.
wide, and a powerful travelling crane is used for lifting and


conveying castings and ladles of molten iron. Two cupolas
are employed in reducing the iron to fluid condition. Mr.
N. E. N. Tooth, M.P., is now part proprietor of this
extensive foundry, which has turned out some of the
principal mills and castings in the district.
The Aldershot Smelting- Works.
The smelting works of the Queensland Smelting Co.,
Limited, are situated six miles from Maryborough, on the
Maryborough-Bundaberg Railway, and are connected by
rail with the wharves, as well as the whole railway system
of the southern colonies. Aldershot is thus directly con-
nected by rail with New South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia. The Company is the only one in Queensland
carrying on a general ore-buying and smelting business,
and the works are complete with all modern appliances
and apparatus for the economical treatment of all classes
of ores containing gold, silver, lead, and copper. The works
have always made a speciality of the economical treatment
of auriferous concentrates and auriferous complex ores, the
gold extraction of which is being guaranteed in some cases
up to 97 per cent., and may be taken for larger parcels at
an average of 95 per cent, of the assay value of the ore.
Auriferous material of the most complex nature is being
treated at the works from all parts of the Australian
colonies, so that the works have been enabled to produce
for the past year 20,6870z. of fine gold, while the total
turnover for all metals—gold, silver, lead, copper —during
the same period reached £ 118,000.
The head office of the Company is under the management
of Mr. C. C. Raw r son, secretary, at 34 and 36 Gresham street,
London, E.C. Messrs. N. M. Rothschild and Sons are
their financial agents and bullion buyers in London. The
practical management of the business in the colony is in
the hands of Mr. E. A. Weinberg, E.M., managing
director for the Company. He has been at the head of the
concern since 1889, and, owing to his long and prominent
connection with some of the largest mining and smelting
enterprises in the United States and in Europe, is rightly
regarded as an authority on the treatment of ores.
The works contain, beside the large furnace plant, the
necessary motive power, crushing, milling, and concen-


ALDERSHOT SMELTING WORKS


trating machinery, appliances for the sampling of ores,
hydraulic lifts, and large rotary blowers. The furnace
plant proper consists of two 80-ton and one 80-ton water
jacket furnaces, two large reverberatory calcining furnaces,
two lead-refining furnaces, zinc kettles for desilverisation,
tilting and English cupelling furnaces. The smelting
capacity is over 2000 tons per month. The assay office,
which is at present the most complete metallurgical
laboratory in Queensland, contains assay, cupelling,
smelting and retorting furnaces, with a distinct department
for purely analytical work ; the scale room is furnished with
the very best Oertlings assay and analytical balances.
The business of the works is carried out on the same
lines as followed by all the large European smelting works.
The ores upon arrival at the works are first weighed and
sampled, and the vendor or his agent may be present
while these operations are being carried out. The vendor
will receive then a duplicate sample in order to have the
Company’s assay checked by any competent assayer.
Should vendor’s assay differ from that of the Company, the
difference will be divided if it does not exceed 2oz. of silver,
2dwt. of gold, 2 per cent, of lead, and 1 per cent, of copper
per ton; if greater, a third reference sample will be
submitted to an independent assayer to be selected by
agreement, and payment will be made on the middle
assay of the three. The fee for reference to be paid by the
party whose assay differs most from that of the referee.
Should the vendor be dissatisfied with the valuation made
by the Company, he is at liberty to remove the ore on
paying the cost of crushing, &c., and reloading.
It may be in place here to say a few words on the
sampling of crude ores, as the taking of proper samples
seems to be less thoroughly understood or less carefully
practised than its importance requires. The extreme
importance of thorough and systematic sampling, combined,
of course, with accurate assaying, is seldom appreciated in
mining and metallurgical operations, except in those cases
where the business of mining and that of reduction are
carried on by different parties, and there is competition in
the purchase of ores. Yet the necessity of sampling is as
great when the same Company both mines and reduces its
ores as when the industries are separated as in this case.


In the descriptions of the methods of sampling there are
certain points, whose importance is fully understood by
those in the business but which has not been sufficiently
emphasized, and on which especial stress should be laid.
As far as the trade in auriferous material is concerned, the
works have generally to deal with blanketings, concentrates
or slimes, i.e., ore in a crushed state. The stuff is emptied
into wheelbarrows and weighed into the storage bins.
Every third, fourth or fifth bag, according to the richness,
is to be weighed separately and emptied on the sampling
floor (a clean, tight, roomy floor covered with sheet iron).
After being well mixed a 101b. sample is taken all over the
pile, to serve for the determination of the moisture only.
The remaining pile is then spread out in not too thick a
layer and quartered dowm. The opposite quarters remain-
ing on the floor are again mixed, and the operation of
quartering repeated. Great care should be taken to
remove with the quartering all the fine material and dust
belonging to it, and to employ the brush or broom
constantly, so as to collect always the proper proportion
of dust. The mixing and quartering is done preferably on
a piece of stout oilcloth, when the sample has become
small enough (say, 51b.) to be handled in that manner.
The final sample, about 11b., is all passed through an
80-mesh screen and thoroughly mixed in a sample pan.
Have ready three wide-mouth 4oz. bottles, place them in a
line side by side upon a sheet of paper, empty the sample
on another piece of white or glazed paper, and pour it from
this in a small stream forth and back across the mouths of
the bottles until they are all full up to the shoulders.
The sampling of coarse ores is done in the same manner,
with the exception that the sample of the ore, either the
whole or proportions thereof, has to be reduced by means
of a rock-breaker and rollers to a uniform size. There has
never been any difficulty in getting reliable results when
sampling has been done carefully on the principles involved
above.
Ores are being purchased by the Smelting all
over the Australian colonies, with well established agencies
and purchasing depots in Adelaide, Zeehan, Melbourne,
and Sydney.
Special freight rates on quantities from 50 tons and
upwards from all Australian ports to works can be arranged


by applying to the Company’s office, Aldershot. Railway
siding into the works ; also telegraph and post-office are
now established in the township ; but there is no hotel.
Accommodation for visitors is provided by Mrs. Eyrie.
The Maryborough Gas and Coke Company, Limited.
The works of this Company are built in close proximity
to the business part of the town and occupy over one and
a-half acres, with frontages to Bowen and Kent streets.
The Bowen street frontage, of nearly 250 ft., is covered
with substantial brick buildings ; the centre part, to the
extent of about 75ft. by 60ft., being of two stories, and
contains the general office, secretary’s room, board room,
show rooms, workshop, store, etc., while the other portion
is used as engine house, purifier shed, smith’s shop, etc., and
is a very compact and well arranged structure. In the
centre of the allotment is the retort house, a lofty brick
building covered in with an iron and louvred roof, and
occupies a space of 110 ft. by 60ft. This building is also
used as a store for coal and shale—2so tons of the former
and 250 tons of the latter at times being under cover here
dry and safe from all weather. There are four retort
benches of six retorts each, two benches only being usually
in use, so that ample provision is at hand in case of an
accident to the benches in use or for any extraneous demand
for the gas ; arrangements are also made by which, in a
short space of time, additional benches can be added if
required. The condenser is of three columns, each 10ft.
high by 2ft. diameter. The tower-scrubber is 30ft. high,
inclusive of the water tank on top, and 6ft. 6in. diameter.
This tower is filled with wood grids, through which water
is constantly trickling ; the gas, having to pass through
these wet grids, undergoes a process of scrubbing or
washing. The purifiers are four in number, and measure
10ft. by 10ft., in which both lime and oxide of iron are used
for purifying purposes ; the lime is procured in the district
and is of very good quality, the oxide of iron having to be
imported from New South Wales. There are two gas
holders with a storage capacity of about) 80,000 ft. The
present rate charged for the gas is 8/9 net per I,oooft. for
lighting, and ss. net per I,oooft. for stoves, &c.

MARYBOROUGH GAS AND COKE COMPANY LIMITED.


This Company was first promoted in 1887, the provisional
directors being Messrs. William Walker, John Walker,
John Graham, John H. Gilbert, R. M. Hyne, William
Young, and Edward S. Booker. The first buildings and
plant were erected by Messrs. John Walker & Co., and the
gas was first turned on on August 2nd, 1879. In 1884 the
plant and buildings were completely re-modelled, with the
result that these works now stand among the first of their
kind in the colony outside Brisbane. The output of gas
from the start, notwithstanding the many competitors, has
been continuously on the increase, the mains at this time
extending over twenty miles of streets. The popularity of
gas as a fuel, for gas cookers, heaters, engines, grillers, etc.,
is satisfactorily growing, and it is anticipated that ultimately
this will prove a very lucrative part of the Company’s
operations. The present directors are Messrs. William F.
Harrington (chairman), John Purser and Thomas Braddock.
Half-yearly report, with profit and loss account, on the

total, £959 14s. 6d.”
THE TIMBER TRADE AND SAWMILLING INDUSTRY,
Whilst still of importance to the district, is comparatively
small with what it was in bygone years. Though it was
some time after arrival of the first settlers before systematic
cutting of timber was done by modem appliances, the vast
treasure in timber was well known, but it was not till
Messrs. Gladwell & Greathead, Pettigrew & Sim, and other
enterprising firms joined the industry that it received
marked impetus. Perhaps the best known, though not the
first of these gigantic enterprises, was the
Dundathu Saw Mills (1875),
on the left bank of the Mary River, ten miles below
Maryborough, is the property of the enterprising firm of


Pettigrew & Sim. Dundathu is only one out of five of a
similar kind. 120,000 feet of pine pass through the mill
every week, whilst the average amount stacked on hand is
700,000 feet. It is seldom that a brig or schooner is
absent from the wharf, loading with timber for all parts
of Australasia. Forty laborers are employed who represent
a population of 200, for whose accommodation cottages
have been erected in addition to a school-cum-chapel,
where the Rev. J. I. Knipe occasionally improves the
Sabbath hours ; whilst, other days, Mr. Johnson teaches
between fifty and sixty children.
The machinery, most of it manufactured in England
and Scotland, consists of three boilers, one of them fitted
with galloway tubes, the other two being the ordinary flue
boilers; four condensing engines of 15-horse power each;
two vertical saws, one of them a four-bladed and fearful-
looking instrument, used for reducing the larger logs, from
which the wood thus becomes manageable, is shifted by a
travelling crane running on transverse beams overhead ;
from this a chain is suspended, to which are two iron claws,
and the timber being grasped is carried to travelling
benches, according to size of the planks to be sawn; the
other, vertical, is chiefly used for squaring or sawung larger
logs into boards. From the travelling benches the planks
or boards pass to the two planing machines, whence they
emerge smoothly planed and, if required, beaded, tongued,
and grooved ; besides the foregoing are two shingling and two
hand-saw benches, two turning lathes —one for wood and
one for iron ; two sharpening machines ; a punching and
a drilling machine, used both for wood and iron. At the
wharf is a crane for lifting logs to the bank, whence by
means of chain and dogs they are hauled by steam power
to undergo the processes we have attempted to sketch.
Notwithstanding an increase in the quantity of beech and
ash annually sawn, the supply of pine is still plentiful,
though it is receding further afield, and the “ Hercules,” a
powerful tug steamer, the property of the firm, is constantly
engaged in towing up rafts from their lumbering stations
on Fraser’s Island and at Tin Can Bay, at which latter
place Messrs. Pettigrew & Co. have a tramway at work of
nearly seven miles in length for carrying logs from the
interior, the motive power being a locomotive engine. The


Mary scrubs fail to supply the demand for cedar; but, if
we may judge by the quality of the “ Haintree ” cedar, that
river is scarcely likely to be the source of our future supply.
The Maryborough Saw and Planing Mills,
Owned by Messrs. Wilson, Hart & Company, Limited, are
widely known as the largest and best equipped mills of their
kind in Queensland, if not in Australia. Standing on the
river bank, in an elevated position, just below the Botanic
Gardens and the Government Railway Wharves, they form
one of the most prominent features of the town, and visitors
approaching the town by the river cannot help having
their attention directed to the large pile of buildings and
outworks comprising this busy hive of industry. Thirty-
one years ago, in the early days of the timber trade of
Maryborough, this firm commenced operations at a site
chosen on the opposite bank of the river, in what is now
called Granville, and met with well-earned and increasing
prosperity until towards the close of the year 1881, when
in a single hour the visible results of years of persevering
toil and energy were swept away by an all-destroying con-
flagration. Nothing daunted, the firm showed the same
enterprise in the erection of the present works as had
characterised their previous exertions. The present com-
manding position, the pick of the town, was selected for
the new mills, and the many conveniences it affords proves
the wisdom of the choice. A branch railway siding running
along the front of the works connects them with all the
timber country tapped by the district railways, by which
the greater portion of log timber supplies are now received,
while at the same time rafted or punted lumber is hoisted
from the river into the works by means of powerful steam
cranes and winches. Railway waggons are relieved of their
heavy burdens by a steam “ traveller,” which also raises
the logs a considerable height and places them on the mill
staging ready for further handling by the sawyers. The
business-like and ever restless action of this aerial traveller
is in itself an interesting spectacle. Passing up an incline
and taking a turn to the right we obtain a full view of the
interior workings, including the large number of machines
and appliances, and the many interesting operations con-
ducted by which the giants of the forest are speedily

reduced to the requisite sizes and shapes for the construc-
tion of dwellings and their furnishings, or for shaft linings
for our goldfields. To follow the material along as it passes
through breaking-down or boarding frames, over rack
benches, self-feed or hand benches, through planing or
moulding machines or turners’ lathes, bandsaw machines
cutting it into circular or irregular shapes, or automatic
benches for box timber, or through machines for grooving
or tenoning shafting, is an interesting experience. Many
appliances are also noticed for grinding and sharpening
saws and tools, also engineers' appliances for effecting
repairs, and a blacksmith’s forge. At the back and sides
of the mills are extensive yards for stacking and drying
timber, the yards being intersected in all directions by
tramlines to facilitate the handling and removing of the
timber. Beyond are patent American hot-air drying kilns
of the latest improved designs, and a shed adjoining in
which to store the output. By means of these kilns a
supply of seasoned timber can be at all times depended upon,
even through the wettest seasons.
Wilson, Hart & Co., Limited, were the first to introduce
these drying kilns into Queensland, and their action has
been greatly appreciated by the trade. The Company have
also complete shipping facilities. Their steamers and
sailing craft on the coast and their numerous branches and
agencies throughout the colony speak sufficiently of their
wide business connection. The high quality and excellence
of their products ensures a preference in all markets, the
demand being sufficient to keep the works constantly and
fully employed. The Company also undertake extensive
coal contracts, having been for a number of years the
largest shippers of coal from this port. The Company have
been identified with the progress of the town, and its
members may feel satisfied that by their technical know-
ledge, practical ability and business enterprise they have
built up an industry in which the town justly takes pride.
Sash and Door Factory and Moulding Mills.
The founder of this extensive business, Mr. James Fairlie,
arrived in the colony in 1862 in the “ Helenslee, ” and laid
the foundations of the present establishment in a small way
in 1868. By degrees, as the colony progressed and popula-

FAIRLIE’S SASH AND DOOR FACTORY


tion increased, various machines were put in, and the male
members of the family, each in his turn, bore a hand in
developing the business. From small beginnings the
establishment has now grown into one of the largest of the
kind in the colonies, giving employment to a considerable
number of hands, and distributing its products far and
wide. A stroll through the factory shows all the operations
of breaking down logs, sawing planks, manufacturing
joinery, mouldings and turnery of every description in full
swing. Heavy trucks for cane factories grow up side by
side with the latest ideas in doors, fretwork, or office
fittings. In fact, well nigh everything that can be wrought
from timber is well within the compass of the firm’s
facilities, aided by the latest and most improved wood-
working machines. Another important branch of Messrs.
Fairlie’s operations consists of glass, from the modest
window pane to the most elaborate ornamentation in fancy
glasses, and various devices in cut glass. Putty is manu-
factured and corn cracked on the premises. Cedar in high
stacks of many years’ seasoning forms a feature of the yard;
mouldings by the mile and glass by the acre lie ready at the
call of the purchaser ; and altogether a visit to these exten-
sive premises reveals a thoroughly up-to-date establishment,
ready to lead as well as to respond to the call of the
building industries. The ice works connected with this
establishment are a boon to Maryborough, and most of our
butchers avail themselves of its cool storage.
The National Saw Mills,
of Messrs. R. M. Hyne & Son, occupy a Large extent of
ground. The works are on a direct line from Kent street,
and adjacent to the Maryborough Sugar Milling Company
and other leading industries. The firm is always busy,
and has many contracts for local and country works. Mr.
Hyne was a heavy loser in the floods of 1890, not the least
being nine houses opposite his mills, whilst timber valued
at £8,500 was also destroyed. At present the works are
fully employed, and persevering energy is meeting reward.
Mr. R. M. Hyne, who is one of the pioneers of the timber
industry, was a few years ago elected to Parliament as
junior member for Maryborough, and in that sphere did
much to advance the interests of the community. Like

most local sawmill owners, Mr. Hyne was a sufferer by the
large importations of Oregon timber, and the tariff on such
bringing about a big local competition. Mr. Hyne is a
gentleman of liberal views, but strongly in favour of a land
tax, a tax on absentees, and a definitely protectionist
Government. When the tariff on imported timber is
doubled it will mean an increased railway revenue and a
doubled wage sheet at every mill in this district.
Taylor Brothers’ Saw Mills
are situated on the banks of the Mary River, adjacent to
the town ; they occupy about six acres, the buildings alone
covering an area of 20,000 square feet. Henry Taylor, the
head of the firm, was born at Stirling, Scotland, in 1840,
and served an apprenticeship to Currie and Taylor, builders,
of that city. He arrived in Maryborough in 1868, and
after working four years as a journeyman, commenced
business for himself. Among other buildings he erected
St. Paul’s Church of England, Boys’ Grammar School,
Bank of New South Wales, Booker’s Buildings, and other
extensive contracts. The present works were established
in 1881, and comprise large steam saw and planing mills
and joinery works, giving employment to about 180 hands.
A large stock of seasoned timber is always on hand, and
full supplies can be obtained at short notice. Strangers
who visit these works gain more insight into the state of
the timber trade than by reading many books. For years
past this firm, like others, has laboured under great
disadvantages, the chief deterrent to progress being the
introduction of Oregon timber, a worthless article, unfitted
for a hot climate, highly inflammable, and exuding a
noisome smell. Against this trash local sawmilling firms
have had to compete and lower the price of good timber to
meet market rates to their own disadvantage and that of
their employees. Happily the tariff on the imported kauri,
as it is called, has been increased, and so far relieved the
unjust piessure on a leading local industry. Better times
for the timber trades are predicted, but as many have been
ruined by the imports referred to, it will probably take
years of prosperity to recover their original status and
success. Among other causes which militated greatly
against the timber trade were floods, scarcity of cedar, and


the small prices obtained for pine, which, as Mr. Taylor
says, “ went down to three shillings per hundred, with a
stationary or lessening consumption, whilst wages were
actually higher.” At present Taylor Bros’ Mills are
busy and have contracts in hand likely to occupy them for
some time to come.
Ramsay, Armitage & Co.’s Saw Mill,
Established in 1876 by Ramsay Bros., of lindah Sugar
Mill and Plantation, is on the left bank of the Mary, near
Irrawarra. For some time these works were in great
repute, with good prospects of success. Mr. Armitage, the
resident partner and manager, employed about 40 workmen
who, with wives and families made up a settlement of 120
population. Though not so extensive in operations as
other mills, and with less machinery, it furnished employ-
ment to quite an army of lumberers, sawyers, and others.
Unfortunately through bad times its “glory has departed; ”
and silence marks the spot where once all was busy life.
Scott Bros.’ Saw Mill,
At the S.E. end of Ann street, was established in 1874, and
the plant of home manufacture comprised two engines of
50 and 26-horse power, a Cornish Hue boiler, vertical frame
.saw (six blades), turning lathes, drilling, punching, planing,
and other machinery. The bank of the river being steep
was cut through to admit log timber, which was hauled to
the mill by steam power. On the wharf, level with the top
of the bank, 80ft. above high-water mark, was a travelling
crane for lifting the hardwood from the punts or pine from
the river. At this point the Mary is sufficiently deep to
admit of vessels, drawing 10ft. of water, to lie at the wharf.
THE MARYBOROUGH MEAT INDUSTRY.
E. Booker’s Establishment.
The meat industry is well represented by Mr. E. Booker’s
large butchering establishment which is on a much more
extensive scale than is generally known, as the following
description shows :
In the year 1859 when Maryborough consisted of but a
few humpies in a clearing of forest, an energetic young man


initiated a small butcher’s shop in premises opposite the
present Sydney Hotel. “E. Booker” was the name which
adorned the signboard, and that young man was as proud
of the side of beef and one sheep per day, which represented
the turnover then, as he is to-day of the great business
which still under the old name distributes 70 bullocks and
150 sheep per week, and which ranks only second in size
and importance to the Graziers’ Company of Brisbane.
Booker pere, who was inspired with the instincts of a
pioneer, worked might and main to further his business,
and as ardently for the interests of the town he had chosen
as his home. Years passed and the business forged ahead,
and when Time demanded a place for a rising and vigorous
generation, the veteran resigned to his sons the charge,
satisfied that they had imbibed the same enterprising
spirit. Mr. E. Booker, junr., is now head of the firm ; Mr.
C. G. Booker, with education and experience garnered from
contact with the great stock dealers of the colonies, has
charge of the buying and droving ; and Mr. E. Booker,
senr., is comptroller-general at the base of operations at
Oaklands, the slaughtering yards.
Oaklands occupies a charming position on the Mary River
two miles below town, and communication is by road or
water. The road is good in all weathers. Oaklands is well
adapted for the purposes required. The estate consists of
6000 acres in paddocks of well-grassed and watered apple-
tree flats. The abattoirs are on the river flat. The first
indication of their proximity is the presence of innumerable
lively grunters, for here 500 pigs run, and special care is
taken in rearing them for market. On the crown of the
hill is the piggery. Here the sows are lodged, each being
accommodated with a comfortable clean stye ; the low roof
running round two sides of the paddock, and containing 50
pens. At the foot of the hill is an immense waterhole,
which connects with a cool tree-shaded swamp, to which
the pigs have access. Butcher’s pork has an unsavory
reputation, but at Oaklands a vegetable diet prevails, and
for that purpose a patch of 10 acres of scrub soil on
the river bank carries a rich crop of rye, oats, tares, sweet
potatoes and such other succulent fodder, dried and cut for
use, and relished. Maize, pumpkins, and sweepings from
the milling company are included in the dietary. Mr.


Booker estimates that the care given to young pigs makes a
saving of 80 per cent, in wild and lost pigs. The styes are
exceptionally clean—fresh straw being used underneath,
and there is a complete absence of ammoniacal filth often
met with.
Cattle and sheep are brought in weekly from purchases
carefully selected by Mr, C. S. Booker, and the large
paddocks sustain the first-class condition of the beasts in
the short interval before they are slaughtered, which
ensures a supply of prime beef. The cattle are mostly
drawn from district herds, the firm being supporters of
local industry, and the sheep come from the rich Barcoo
country. About 1500 head of cattle are now maturing at
Bonara for the firm. Mr. Booker believes in short
droving, and finds that fattening cattle close to Mary-
borough suits admirably. The cattle drive runs between
parallel fences down the hill to small stockyards, which
in turn lead to the slaughtering chamber. As the beast
enters he is speared, and drops. The blood flows into a
concrete drain, and is carried to the river. The hide of the
beast is stripped and placed in the curing pit. The carcass,
having been previously hoisted by strong tackle, is cut up
ready for the shops. The floors are cement, and, as
pointed out by the recent report of the Health Inspector,
less likely to encourage disease germs. The tallow-house
at Oaklands is conveniently situated about a chain distant.
The building is a low open shed, containing ten vats
moulded in concrete. Water pipes deliver water pumped
from the river into the vats, and the refining of the
product is so carefully supervised that a beautiful tallow is
the result, and its excellence secures the highest prices in
Sydney, and has won the attention of European buyers.
The tallow is packed in tierces and casks, the supply of
which assists materially in sustaining another local in-
dustry—the cooperage, under tender to Messrs. F. E.
Whittaker and Co. When the stock accumulates
sufficiently the casks are rolled into the river, where a raft
of twenty or more is formed, and the outgoing coastal
steamer picks them up for transfer to Sydney.
Overlooking the tallow-house is a large ah’y building,
used for sheep-killing, drying and curing sheepskins,
storing of fodder, &c. The sheep drive branches at the


top of tbe hill and leads through convenient yards to the
killing pen, which precipitates the blood into a concrete
channel and runs it to tbe river. Tbe sheepskins are
bung on battens, about 400 at a time, till curing is
complete, when they are pressed into bales and exported.
Every part of tbe animal is turned to account. Tbe scent
of new-mown fodder and of sheep is pleasingly present in
the building, and is more suggestive of the pasture than of
the abattoir. There is certainly an effluvium in the air
about the yards, but it is of decaying bones which accumu-
late till they are turned into bone-dust.
On tbe ground stands a squat-built chimney, a rusting
boiler and sundry machinery, all that remain of an
attempt made years ago to foster a large export meat
trade. Tbe attempt was in advance of its time and “ fell
in,” but subsequent successes and the interest which now
attaches to tbe subject throughout tbe colony, awaken a
regret that better support was not accorded.
Mr. Booker has never cared for the obnoxious and
uncleanly method of transporting beef in open carts from
the slaughter yards, and be rightly contends that exposure
to the weather and gathering of dust particles and floating
germs do not conduce to a healthy state of affairs. The
meat is transported to town in a specially constructed, well-
ventilated van, wherein carcasses are hung, and saved from
bruising. In the subsequent delivery of the meat about
town six covered-in smaller carts are used.
The business is represented in Maryborough by three
establishments. The head shop is in Adelaide street, and
the branches in the suburb of Newtown, at the corner of
John and Churchill streets, and in Pallas street. The firm
recently extended operations to the Isis Scrub, by purchas-
ing the business of the late E. A. Kruger, in M‘llwraith
street. The head establishment is a centre of industry,
employing 25 men—tbe whirr of machinery and the aroma
of boiling and steaming meat telling of a busy trade. A
6-horse power steam engine drives the sausage machines,
and in small goods generally, there is a great demand
locally and throughout tbe colony, Steam pipes are set to
many vats, and meat is cooked as required. The greatest
effort is in the salting and curing of meat for the Isis, and
for export to Thursday Island, northern ports, and to Cool-


gardie, a remunerative trade having been opened up to these
places, besides the efforts required to supply the great local
demand. The business is spreading and lately it has been
necessary to take in the shop adjoining. A grand display
is made every Saturday in carcasses and small goods, with
gleaming metal and bouquets of flowers.
Some years ago refrigerating machinery was erected, but
did not prove sufficiently satisfactory to continue its use.
Mr. Booker, however, is always abreast of the times, and
when the Fairlie Co.’s cooling chambers were erected,
immediately secured two of them. It is pleasing to note
the good feeling that exists between employer and employ-
ees, and Mr. Booker attributes much of his success to this
esprit de corps , and states that he finds it satisfactory to pay
good wages, give good treatment, and shorten hours of
labour where it can be done without inconvenience to the
public. This was, we understand, the first establishment
in Queensland to initiate the afternoon delivery of meat
during the winter months, which has proved a success and
boon to employees. The business represents a thriving
local industry, and ranks as one of the best conducted and
important of local industries.
J. Billie’s Bakery Establishment,
Occupies a leading position and contains the largest and
most complete machinery for making the “staff of life”
in the colonies. Great changes have taken place in this
district since the old-fashioned damper or johnny cake
prevailed, and bakers have come and gone who made good
bread but failed to bring it to the perfection attained by
Mr. John Billie. A native of Stonehaven. Scotland, where
he learned the trade, he arrived in Man borough in 1872,
and after establishing the bakery business on the ancient
hand-made system, turning out 150 loaves per day, resolved
to attain greater expedition and excellence in manipulating
the dough by introducing modern machinery. An idea
may be formed of this machine when it is stated that it
covers the largest part of the fioorage of the entire
building. The cost of this monster plant, capable of
turning out 10,000 loaves per day, was T1,500, and as a
labour-saver it is simply unequalled. Though Mr. Billie
only turns out 1,000 loaves per day, yet with increasing


population and extensive trade with various districts it is
impossible to say what may be done ; no matter how large
the population of Maryborough, it is gratifying to know
that Mr. Rillie can supply the demand for bread from his
bakery in Adelaide street. Machines such as his are
worthy of inspection. Its prominent features are its great
cleanliness, and there is no handling the dough from first
to last. The best Adelaide roller flour is used, and no
better article can be obtained than the bread made by
J. Rillie.
L. Steindl’s Brewery, Granville.
Hot weather naturally causes the enquiry “ What shall
we drink?’' and whilst thirst-quenchers of various sorts
are recommended, most people admit, after trying all, that
Steindl’s ale the lot.
Steindl’s Brewery is situated at Granville, or. as it was
once called, East Maryborough, a mile and a-half from the
Maryborough Post Office. Passing the main gates, we were
impressed with the good taste of the proprietor, who
was his own architect and builder. We were received by
Mr. Steindl, one of the most courteous of men. From him
we gathered that the pioneer of the brewing industry in
Maryborough was Mr. Finselbach, who, in 1875, had an
hotel in Adelaide street with a small brewing plant at the
rear. Mr. Steindl succeeded him, and opened his present
works in March, 1878, and though the trade is not equal to
what it was when many hogsheads went to Gympie and
Bundaberg, the output is still large, being fully fifty
hogsheads per week, besides a quantity of bottled ale and
porter, and this in the face of there being brewers in
Gympie and Bundaberg who do a considerable all-round
trade. The holding capacity of some of the working plant
—such as mash tubs, vats. &c.—is immense, two of the
latter being estimated at 1,400 and 1,700 gallons each,
whilst there is a cooler of 2,000 gallons.
Mr. Steindl is an Austrian, and a practical brewer.
Coming from a long line of ancestors in the business, Mr.
Steindl acquired his knowledge from his father, a consulting
brewer and distiller in Austria, who had successfully passed
the fourteen grades of examination which every practical
brewer in that country is expected to know. Among these
are distilling, coppersmithing, &c., and which Mr. Steindl

understands thoroughly, as shown by testimonials and
diplomas he holds ; in fact, few colonial brewers could
show higher credentials or testimonials than he, and he
has taken prizes at all the principal exhibitions in this
colony for the superiority of his ales in draught, bottled
ales and porter, and for pickles, vinegars and sauces, in the
manufacture of which he is an expert.
Whilst the hops used are chiefly New Zealand, Tasmanian
and Kent, Mr. Steindl, having recently tried Californian,
considers it not only equal, but believes it imparts a new
and exquisite flavor to the ale. We had the pleasure of
testing their fine aroma, and Mr. Steindl gives a practical
illustration of their virtues in the excellent beverages he
supplies. English, Victorian, and even Scotch malts have
been used by Mr. Steindl, who states that the duties are
too high—hops, Bd. per lb. ; malt, 4s. 6d. per bushel.
Both duties might be remitted by the Government, since
they handicap the brewing industry.
We had the pleasure of tasting some of the genuine brew,
and testing the flavor of Californian hops. This article,
we should think, will remove the stigma on colonial ale as
being affected greatly by climatic influences and requiring a
“ quick draught.” After we had done justice to this plea-
sant and invigorating beverage, the stimulating qualities
of which reminded us of the far-famed London Alton ale,
we sampled some fine pickles and sauces and preserves
made by Mr. Steindl from vegetables grown in his garden.
We were shown the several departments devoted to cask
and bottle cleaning, bottling, and other operations
connected with the trade, in which expert hands made light
work. Though the river is not distant, it is of small
utility to the brewery, as the water used is supplied from
large tanks of rain water. Apart from these there is a fine
spring on the grounds, which Mr. Steindl has utilised, and
for this purpose he had a capacious well sunk and cemented
to a depth of 86ft., from the bottom of which men set in
with boring apparatus and tapped this spring, which gave
a supply for all purposes, and will enable the proprietor to
manufacture ale for future generations and for all time.
With so large a quantity of land at his command, it is
not strange that Mr. Steindl is an enthusiastic “fancier”
of birds and animals, and these he regards in the light of


pets, which the stranger immediately discovers from ihe
familiarity they show when he goes amongst them. The
aviary contains a multitude of beautiful pigeons, doves, &c.
Then there are fowls, turkeys, pelicans, wild and tame
ducks, and black swans. In pens adjacent are a large
number of pigs, which though not ornamental, are useful,
especially to those looking forward to porcine delicacies at
Christmas. All looked healthy and clean, and were living
examples of care and kind treatment.
The flower garden, teeming with Nature’s glories, came
in for a visit, as did the kitchen and fruit garden, in which
the superiority of Maryborough soil to grow everything,
was exemplified ; we found a well-laid out plot in which
were flourishing abundantly splendid fruits and vegetables
of all sorts. At the rear of the premises are commodious
stables and grazing paddocks, and the whole of the exten-
sive grounds are fenced in. Beyond these, stretching away
in the distance, is the “ forest primeval,” and there can be
seen a once familiar feature in the landscape—the gunyahs
of aboriginals, remnant of the once large and powerful
Wide Bay tribes, now rapidly passing away. A few of these
are employed by Mr. Steindl to do “ odd jobs,” such as
shooting and fishing.
The name of Steindl is one which will not readily be
forgotten in Maryborough during this century, the ale he
brews being so largely in favour with hotels and the public.
The bottled ale and porter are superior articles and formid-
able rivals to importations, whilst tbeir cheapness is also a
recommendation.
Meredith’s Brick and Tile Works
Occupy a prominent position in Ferry street, Maryborough,
facing the Reserve, and were established in 1875 by the
present proprietor, whose experience was gained in Staf-
fordshire and Wolverhampton, whence comes the beautiful
and elegant Burslem pottery in fashionable demand, to
which the Colonies have made but meagre advances.
Though able to undertake the manufacture of such leading
lines, Mr. Meredith finds competition too keen, and
therefore devotes his attention to the useful and more
remunerative task of making bricks (plain, fancy, and
white), drain pipes, tiles, flower pots, fernery and bush-


house requisites, bread crocks, &c. The excellence of these
articles is well known, and show the suitability of Mary-
borough clay. Though the output of bricks is at present
only 1000 per diem, it will increase when our residents
understand that Maryborough requires better tenements
than many of the weatherboard shanties and huts which
disgrace leading thoroughfares. Our Corporation should
accede to the universally expressed desire of the citizens to
build a Town Hall worthy the name, and, instead of
weatherboards, use brick and stone. There is a large
quantity of Kaolin clay in this and surrounding districts,
especially at Gympie, Kilkivan, and other goldfields, and it
is believed that artistic pottery-making may yet be added
to our products. At present, Kaolin clay, worth from T8
to £i per ton, is cast aside as valueless, though in Victoria
the same product forms a leading export to England.
Kaolin is used in the manufacture of art china and orna-
ments. Mr. Meredith’s brick and tile works are well
worth a visit.
Woodhoiise’s Atlas Stove Factory,
Situated in Pallas street, adjacent to Kent street and the
Gayndah road, was established in 1881 by Charles
Woodhouse, a practical mechanic, who first began trade at
Tiaro, and left it to start the present business. The works
occupy a quarter acre, with large workshops in which the
manufacture of stoves, ovens, and many other articles of
utility is carried on. The specialities are “ Dover ” and
“ Beacon Light ” stoves, honor and prize winners at all
exhibitions. Woodhouse’s ovens are found in most Mary-
borough homes and surrounding districts, their charac-
teristics being cleanliness and efficiency. In addition,
ornamental garden and hall seats, with castings of all
kinds, are made by modern up-to-date machinery. The
business has increased from the start, the articles being
made of the best materials by practical workmen, and at
lowest cash prices, thus largely superseding the imported
stoves and ovens on which there is a duty of 25 per cent.
Ship and Boat Building.
Reports show that the timber trade is improving, and
with a splendid river, why not a marine carnival oftener ?
A fleet of well-built boats and yachts is not impossible on


the Mary River, with the finding of such fine trees as that
cut by Mr. West at Kilkivan a few months ago, which was
56ft. long, with 126 in. girth, containing 4,415 ft. Mr. J.
G. Walker is regarded as the pioneer boat-builder. In
1858 he built the “ Blue Jacket,” which for a time traded
between Brisbane and Wide Bay; but she was wrecked,
and the “ William Miskin ” replaced her in 1854. The
“ Blue Jacket ” was built solely for the timber trade.
Regular steam traffic between Brisbane, Maryborough, and
Rockhampton was not established till 1859, when the
A.S.N. Co. placed the “ Tamar” on the line, and eventually,
she, with the “ Waratah,” both old boats, was taken off,
and the “ Clarence,” in charge of Captains Cottier and
Knight substituted.
The Chief Industries in Wide Bay and Burnett districts
are: —
Bundaherg —Sugar and general farming.
Eidsvold —Gold mining.
Gayndah —Pastoral and farming.
Gympie —Gold mining.
Kilkivan —Mining and farming.
Maryborough —Iron foundries, sawmills, brewing,
dugong, beche-de-mer, and commerce.
The Dugong Fishery.
This industry was started at Maryborough in 1860 by
a man named Ching Messrs. F. Bryant and A. G. Crocker,
the latter now landlord of the Globe Hotel, were associated
in the business. The late Dr. Hobbs, of Brisbane, is
regarded as a pioneer in the industry, and was the first to
make known publicly the medicinal qualities and dietetic
uses of the dugong. Mr. A. K. Bruce, chemist, of
Maryborough, made large sales of the dugong products in
1860-61 to southern buyers, since which time the trade has
fallen considerably. The dugong fishery is yet a latent
treasure to some persevering man in our midst.
Beche-de-mer is a species of sea slug found on the Wide
Bay coast, giving profitable employment to collectors.
In 1879 the fisheries owned by some fourteen Sydney
firms operating along our northern coasts, were for pearl,
dugong, and beche-de-mer, employing 81 Europeans and
688 natives, more or less, of Asiatic lineage ; the year’s
return of beche-de-mer alone being 52J tons.


Sugar Mills and Plantations established in 1876.
Antigua —A. and A. H. Brown, owners ; Mr. Richardson,
manager. On Mary River, opposite Owanyilla. 400 acres,
including Lower Frankstone. Plant by Mirrilees, Tait and
Watson. In 1876, 800 tons of high grade sugar turned out.
Alford —Farquhar and Dunn. On Yengarie road, five
miles from Maryborough. 500 acres, including part of
Theo. Wood’s farm. First to crush and sell juice without
converting it into sugar.
The Central —Mr. Gibson. Adjoins above, and is the
oldest mill in the district; 600 acres, half under cane.
Operations confined to crushing and disposal of juice at
Yengarie.
Eaton Vale —W. Canny. 800 acres, all under cane.
Employs 200 hands ; excellent plant.
Good Hope —Graham and Nixon. On river bank near
Graham’s Landing, two miles from Tiaro.

acres, bought from rhe late Mr. Rankin. Plant by Union
Foundry. Mr. Cowley, first manager.
lindah —Ramsay Bros. (Originally known as the Upper
Mary). Four miles by Gympie road from Prince’s Ferry.
300 acres. Machinery by Walkers Limited ; distillery a
feature.
Irrawarra —F. F. Nixon. An out-station of Yengarie,
owned by Tooth and Cran. Cane juice conveyed three
miles by pipes to Yengarie. A. Gumming, supervisor.
Area, 2,000 acres.
Maryborough Sugar Company's Estate —J. Jamieson,
manager. On left bank Tinana Creek, eight miles above
junction with Mary River. Contains 1,200 acres ; 150
employees engaged.
Magnolia —On right bank Tinana Creek ; 4,000 acres, all
fenced. Plant by Walkers Limited. Mr. Boughey,
manager.
Terra Terra —l,2oo acres ; part of Yengarie.
Tengarie —Tooth and Cran. Famed for sugar, extract of
meat, and refinery. Output, 5,000 tons sugar annually.
Large population surrounding works.


Since the above date several sugar estates have been
formed, including :
Nevada —H. Monckton. Five miles from Prince’s
Ferry, Tinana Creek. 1,000 acres; employing seventy
colored laborers, under H. Pruche Aubrey, manager.
Bingera Mill —Gibson and Howes. Extensive plant of
latest design. Main building of two stories, partly for storage
and partly for 80 coolers of 1,2u0 gallons each, for low
standard sugars. Fourteen centrifugals, new engine of
immense power, and a host of improvements, make the
equipment very superior.
Maryborough Factory , Ltd. —First annual report states
loss on first season’s operations. Treated 7,418 tons cane,
resulting in low quality juice, causing loss reported.
Millaquin Refinery , Bundaherg , receives juice per rail
from the Isis, returning refined sugar at a profit.

and Club Hotel.


PART VII.
COUNTRY TOWNSHIPS.
OTHING indicates the prosperity of these
districts more than so many flourishing
y||||L suburban townships, all indicating agri-
cultural settlement. Lands first occupied
by pastoralists have long since yielded their treasures •to
the husbandman and orchardist, to the cane-grower, farmer,
and selector, whilst near to such are villages or hamlets
containing the usual church, school, post-office, store, hotel,
pound and lockup.
The adjacent towns to Maryborough are Alpha, Appletree
Creek, Childers, Dunmora, Elliot (Musket Flat), White
Cliffs (Fraser’s Island), Goodwood, Horton, Howard, Isis,
Mungarr, Pialba, Granville, Stanton Harcourt, Ten Mile
(Mungarr-Gayndah line), Tiaro, Tinana, Torbanlea,
Urangan, Whaddon, Yengarie. All are polling places.
Bundaberg and the Sugar-growing Interests.
Sugar-growing, unknown in these districts up to 1860, is
now meeting with more than ordinary attention. Unlike
the Clarence and Manning, this and surrounding districts
appear eminently suitable for profitable sugar-cane planting.
The first sugar-cane crushing in this district (February 20,
1867), produced 1000 tons sugar.
The latitude of Bundaberg is where the actual prosperity
of the Northern sugar country begins. On the Mary-
borough side of the country the same prosperity does not
appear, and it is a fact that sugar-farming thereabouts is
not as prosperous as at Bundaberg, 51 miles further north.
The Bundaberg country seems created for the sugar
industry, for, whilst wheat and maize culture give poor
results, and cattle-breeding in bygone days proved a failure,
the sugar industry has triumphed. The white labour of
plantations is skilled and the line of demarcation between
it and the kanaka seen, and the drudgery of the canefields
devolving on the latter. From observation there seems no
reason why white men should not perform all the labour
on canefields.


Bundaberg has made rapid strides, and now ranks as one
of the most prosperous settlements. It comprises a seaport
and municipal borough on the Burnett River, 222 miles
N.W. of Brisbane, with about 4,000 inhabitants, whilst
fully 15,000 people gain a livelihood in the district by
farming. It has rail communication with Maryborough
and Gympie, and its commercial importance is enhanced by
its navigable river, the town being about ten miles from
the seaboard. The River Burnett has ample room for
sea-going craft of large tonnage, whilst vessels of over
1000 tons burthen can be accommodated at the Govern-
ment and private wharves. The railway extends northward
to Rosedale, 34 miles, or the first section of the Gladstone
line, whilst another branch runs to Mount Perry ; and it is
alleged that the prosperity of Bundaberg can be traced to
the opening up of the Mount Perry copper country.
In 1872, the fame of the great cupriferous area of the
Burnett spread throughout Australasia. The product of
raw and refined ores usually went to Maryborough, via
Mungo Crossing, near Tenningering. Prior to this a
Government official was sent up to report on the Burnett
River for navigation. Lack of experience in marine
surveying led him astray to the Elliot River, and his report
was unfavourable to the place he had to advise upon. In
1864, two residents (the Walker Bros.) left Gayndah in
search of cattle country to the eastward. Their camp was
22 miles on the coast ; the name of this run is Bingera,
When the copper fever was at its height, Mr. E. Vickery,
of Sydney, interested himself in the mineral selections and
the best means of reaching the seaboard. The country, on
account of its mountainous character, was considered
inaccessible on the north side of the Burnett by all but
horsemen. In 1871 a party of teamsters, under contract
to the Mount Perry Copper Mining Company, climbed the
lofty ranges and opened up communication for vehicular
traffic with the true natural port of the district to the west.
Having marked a line, others followed, and an embryo
town called North Bundaberg formed. A wharf was
erected, and the foundations of a future city duly laid.
This was the commencement of the port and the opening up
of its commerce. The first settlers were bushmen from the
Upper Burnett, pioneers in the sugar growing and coffee


planting ; good mechanics followed, and the native products
were turned to account. The demand for staves for casks
for boiling-down establishments, and timber requirements
generally led to the starting of a saw mill, and sailing craft
of about fifty tons were attracted to the new port.
PIONEERS OF THE SUGAR INDUSTRY.
By P. O’Kelly.
Any reference to the early history of the Maryborough
District, however brief, would be incomplete without more
than a passing reference to Messrs. Murray and Jamieson,
founders of the lindah Sugar Plantation on the Mary River.
These gentlemen were the pioneers of the sugar industry
here, and in its initiation they displayed an amount of
perseverance and industry that certainly deserved a more
enduring reward than any mere record that I can put forth.
They succeeded in accomplishing what was then considered
one of the wonders of science, i.e., the making of good
marketable sugar. But in their effort they expended their
last dollar, and like most pioneers left to others the reward
of their toil and expenditure of capital. It is impossible to
estimate the difficulties and waste of both time and money
which the pioneers of this industry had to contend with.
Were it to serve any good purpose, I could mention the
names of several imposters who then infested the district
and received large salaries by pretending they could make
sugar. But in this case one of the partners, Mr. Jamieson,
after an experience of those pretenders, went into the whole
subject of sugar-making himself, and in the long run
succeeded in evolving the process from his own repeated
trials and close observation. Such was the excellence of
the sugar which he turned out at lindah, that after being
obliged to bow to the inevitable in financial matters, he was
able to take the sole management of the old Maryborough
Sugar Company, now called the Alpha Plantation.
Maryborough to Bundaberg and Mount Perry.
The line runs parallel with the sea for the whole distance,
and traverses uninteresting country till crossing the
Burrum, Isis and Gregory rivers, and Torbanlea comes in


sight. This is a coal-mining centre with church, public
school, two hotels, and about 50 houses. Two miles further
is Burrum, where the first discovery of coal took place,
January Ist, 1865, on land belonging to the Hon. W. H.
Walsh, being in a belt, extending from Laguna Bay south,
beyond Baffle Creek in the north, about 150 miles long by
30 miles in width. Next is Howard, a small township,
producing first-class coal. Leaving this, the route crosses
to the Isis Junction. A branch line turns off at the left
for 12 miles, and enters the great Isis Scrub, covering an
area of about 40 square miles. The whole is occupied by
prosperous cane-growers and selectors. Childers comes
next, situated on the crest of a low ridge. A large sugar
mill, erected by Mr. Robert Cran, of Millaquin, is a
“ feature.” West of Childers, eight miles further, is
Cordalba, a farming settlement. On the Bundaberg line is
the Gregory River, a small creek spanned by a bridge on
concrete piers, from which the line traverses dreary
“ Wallum ” country to Bundaberg across level open forest.
Bundaberg,
The centre of a rich agricultural district, was called by the
aborigines Booralbooral. The original owners were the
“Kalki” tribes, who named the locality “ Biarbarra.”
Bundaberg, however, takes its name from “ Bunda,” a
powerful tribe now extinct, and “ berg,” a town. The
district was first explored by Forbes of Upper Doongool,
and Win. Howard, two squatters in search of fresh grazing
country. They took up land in 1856, and called the spot
“ Woongara,” which name also was given to “The
Hummock.” These settlers were followed in 1857 by A.
Walker and his brother Robert with Barnard and Parker of
Gayndah, who formed Bingera Station. 'ln February, 1858,
this party had a narrow escape on the present site of Bunda-
berg, R. Walker and black boy being surrounded by a mob
of hostile blacks, who were, however, placated. Tantitha
Station was taken up by Russell and Ogg soon after Bingera,
and in 1866 John and Gavin Stewart selected 820 acres at
North Bundaberg under the Coffee and Sugar Regulations.
The first timber vessel, the “ Elizabeth,” entered the Burnett
River in January, 1867, and Captain J. Miller loaded her
with log cedar for Maryborough. In 1868 J. S. Johnston


arrived with the first sawmill plant, and in 1869 the Watson
family came to settle. The town site was selected and
surveyed by Mr. J. C. Thompson. Selection rapidly
extended in 1869 until all available land was occupied.
The first steamer to enter the river, named after Surveyor
Burnett, was the “ Sir John Young,” Captain French.
Bundaberg is a clean, healthy town, with two-chain
streets, and divided by the Burnett into North and South
Bundaberg. The chief portion is on the south side, and
the latter, though situated on level country, is above flood
mark. Population by last census was 8,000, town, and
district 10,000. Bourbon street is a fine promenade, with
good buildings, conspicuous among which are the Post
and Telegraph Offices and School of Arts. There are
four banks and two newspapers—the Mail and Star,
East of the town is Mr. Robert Gran’s Millaquin Refinery,
a gigantic concern, covering one and a-quarter acres.
Radiating from this great central mill are conduit pipes
receiving cane-juice seven miles off in the Woongarra Scrub.
These pipes total over twenty miles. The mill interior
is a labyrinth of machinery, and the whole process of
manufacture and refining is conducted on scientific
principles.
From Bundaberg to the coast, about nine miles, is an
excellent road, through the Woongarra Scrub of 25,000
acres. In the centre is “ The Hummock,” a hill 500 ft.
high, commanding a view of the surrounding country and
of 18 sugar mills and 20,000 acres of cane. Canefields
stretch in all directions, even to the ocean. Along the
shores between the beach and scrub lie the Barolin Plains,
There is no similar scene in Queensland. North and
South Bundaberg are connected by railway bridge, which
unites the Maryborough line on one side with the Gladstone
line on the other.
The Mount Perry line, starting from North Bundaberg,
passes over much dull country, with sharp curves at the
Burnett or Dawes Range. Kn route the following are
passed :—Bingera estate and sugar mill, Goondoon, Kolan,
to Maroondan ; thence to Gin Gin. Ten miles ahead is
Watawa (or Gnalla), a small settlement of timber-getters,
who cut the hoop-pine which abounds here. Passing
Dalysford, we reach Moolboolaman and Boolboonda. The


original name of Mount Perry was “ Gnoorgnoor,” or
burial-ground. A tunnel leads to Wombah, near Mount
Webster; thence for about 58 miles, passing Degilbo
Rock. Degilbo means in the native tongue “ big stone.”
Drummer’s Greek, once a noted aboriginal fighting-ground,
comes next, and the country hereabouts is occupied by
farmers and pastoralists. Mount Perry, at 66 miles,
terminates the journey.
Tiaro.
Situated on the River Mary, 22 miles south of Mary-
borough by rail. The farmers round Tiaro are Messrs.
Paul Grevsen, Casey, Pickering, J. Maslen, Hall, Job,
Dowzer, and others of more or less energetic type.
Tiaro Divisional Board. —Geo. Lindlay (Chairman), J.
Dowzer, Jno. Dale, H. Missing, R. W. Scougall, J. Job,
M. Mellor, August Gesch, G. Mant, A. McKellar. Clerk,
A. F. Waraker.
Mount Biggenden
Is becoming a notable place. Its first settlers and pioneers
were from the “ Old Township ”in 1850. The Two-Mile,
Oakey Creek, is a favourite picnic spot. The State school
was established about five years ago ; present number of
scholars on roll, 250. Teachers, M. T. McCann and
assistants.
CuRRAJONG,
Distant from Maryborough about 20 miles. Contains
Provisional school conducted for about ten years by Mr.
Joseph P. O’Keefe, since transferred to State school,
Rockhampton.
Antigua.
A township situated about 18 miles from Maryborough,
with population of some 200 scattered residents. The line
from Maryborough to Gympie passes over Antigua Bridge.
Local affairs are managed by Divisional Board; clerk,
A. Hall; chairman, Mr. Jas. Maloney, and following
members :—Messrs. C. Staier, J. Kerr, R. Adams, S. J.
Elliott, P. Brandt, R. Beattie, C. J. Christopher ; auditors,
Messrs. Juckes and Purser. Ferry matters are under the
control of the Antigua and Tinana Divisional Boards.


Gkanville,
A suburb of Maryborough, about a mile and a-half from the
General Post Office. Its lands are low and frequently
covered by the overflow from the Mary River. Notwith-
standing this, the locality is fairly settled. It has a State
school, of which the committee are ;—H. Pursey, A. M.
Bryant, A. H. White, R. Lome, and J. Lyle. There is a
fair attendance. Granville is managed by a Divisional
Board, viz., Messrs. H. A. Paul (chairman), F. Itzstein, J.
Bushnell, J. Swanborough, H. Pursey, C. M. Hansknecht,
A. M. Bryant, M. A. Holme, R. A. Boye, and J. F. Wood.
The latter represents the Division on the Harbor Board of
Advice. Clerk, H. F. Parker, who is also clerk of the
Tinana Divisional Board, and of the United Municipality.
One of the most prominent and extensive buildings here is
Mr. L. SteindTs brewery, fully mentioned elsewhere.
Religious services are held at Christ Church, Granville, by
Rev. Canon Eva on third Sunday in each month.
Degilbo,
Scrub land, now thrown open for conditional and uncon-
ditional purchase, is much in request, and adds another
argument in favour of extension of the Gayndah line
through the fertile Burnett District.
Among farming and agricultural properties on the Mary
River is W. Barriskill’s fine selection, No. 1246, containing
about 80 acres, five miles from Tiaro, and mile from
the Netherby Railway Station.
Tinana
Is in the parish of Young, about a mile from the Post
Office, Maryborough, on the Gympie route. The road
passes Owanyilla 9 miles, Tiaro 8 miles, Gootchy 10 miles,
Thompson’s Flat 12 miles, Palmer’s 11 miles, Gympie 9
miles ; total, 60 miles. The road to Kilkivan from here is
about 55 miles and passes Owanyilla, Tiaro, Mary River,
Miva Station, and Brooyar. The prominent residents are
Messrs. Spencer, White, Morris, Christmas, Fawell,
Hanguisch, Krueger, Staib, W. Mitchell, Jones, Parker (2).
The pioneers to this locality were: John Eaton, Henry
Palmer, W. St. Ledger, White, Cheyne, J. M. Bailey, Cleary,


and J. St. Ledger, whose name is associated with the
founding of the township. The population is about 500,
but scattered, most being engaged in farming, dairying, and
pastoral pursuits. Tinana has a Divisional Board, which
meets every Thursday. President and chairman, F.
Parker ; the members being Messrs. P. Brennan, Hobler,
Raverty, and Hansen. The secretary is Mr. PI. F. Parker,
of London, who arrived in Maryborough in 1874 ; clerk
for five years with Mr. R. Lyons, solicitor, when he
started business on his own account. He is also clerk of
the Granville Divisional Board. Hotels : Diggers’ Arms
(J. St. Ledger), near Prince’s Bridge; Tinana Hotel (
Poulsen), One-mile. The Cornstalk Hotel, now closed, was
an important hostelry at the time of the Gympie rush.
Though Tinana is well laid out, yet with the exception of
one main thoroughfare, there are few streets correctly
aligned. Streets: McGregor, William, Walworth,
Thomas, and McCabe. Roads : River road, Gonora, Gympie,
Woongool, lindah, Eaton Yale, Teddington, Enfield, Spring-
vale, Springfield, Kernke’s, Nerada, One-mile, and Enfield.
A massive timber bridge, erected in 1875 at Prince’s
Ferry, was swept away in the flood of 1898. A steam
ferry was established, in charge of Mr. T. Christmas (lessee)
of Tinana, Another bridge has since been erected by
Thompson and McArdle, and is now open for traffic.
Tinana has a gymnasium numbering thirty members,
managed by Messrs. H. Smith (president) and J.
Cummings (hon. sec.)
St. Ledger’s Diggers’ Arms Hotel is a prominent land-
mark on the brow of the hill, close to the Lamington
Bridge. It is a commodious house, and favourite spot of
call. The host and hostess are very popular, and being
among the oldest residents, are well informed concerning
the place and people.
Tinana was one of the first settled spots around Mary-
borough, when William St. Ledgvr, who came from
New South Wales, arrived, and purchased a block of 40
acres of land at £1 per acre, on the spot afterwards known
as St. Ledger’s Paddock. Mr. J. St. Ledger, now landlord
and owner of the Digger’s Arms Hotel, joined his brother
in agricultural settlement in 1860, and they shortly after
brought out their parents from the old country. The


elder St. Ledgers settled down to farming on Tinana Creek,
and were fairly successful. About this period John Eaton,
a native of New South Wales, took up land at Eaton Vale ;
and Mr. Cleary, who established the boiling-down in this
locality, died and was buried at the “ Old Township.”
The Tinana Ferry was established by J. St. Leger, in
January, 18G4. Mr. Halloday built the approaches. The
traffic was large, and the ferry was shortly after taken
over by Mr. Walter Hay, who had punt for three years.
During the Gympie rush fully 500 people crossed daily*
and Mr. Hay was very successful.
The pioneer settlers of the locality are Messrs. W. and
J. St. Ledger, Uhr, Freudenfeld, McGregor, Cleary,
White, O’Kelly, Eaton, Parke, Webber, Cheyne, Bailey,
M.P., and others. W. St. Ledger died in December, 1892,
aged 52 years.
The townships of
Huxley, Hapsburg and Cordalba
Are striking evidences of progress. A few years ago they
were unknown ; to-day, railway stations are erected at
them.
Pialba
Is situated on the shores of Hervey’s Bay, 20 miles by
rail from Maryborough. In the district coffee culture has
been successfully tried by Mr. T. A. Bromiley, and sugar-
cane by Mr. Stephens, and both without black labor. " As
a seaside resort Pialba is a chosen spot, and, under the
Burrum Divisional Board, making progress. Its position,
in view of the Mombi Hills on Fraser’s Island to the east,
Great and Little Woody Islands to the southward, and
Point Vernon, makes it attractive, and it bids fair to
become a large and prosperous township. The scenery is
superb, and Sandy Cape, distant 88 miles, is visible in clear
weather. Pialba has a frontage of 18 miles from Eli
Creek to Urangan, the whole being available for building
sites. There is the usual State school accommodation,
Lutheran and undenominational churches, insurance
agencies, post and telegraph office, police force, trade
conveniences, with a population of about 600.


Mount Perry,
Formerly “ Tenningering,” first occupied as a stock
station in 1849, proclaimed a township through the dis-
covery of copper and location of residents in 1868. It is
about 200 miles N.W. of Brisbane, and 60 miles from
Bundaberg by rail and road. Gold, copper, and other
minerals abound. The population is about 800. There is
a State school, Cemetery Trust, Turf Club, Hospital,
School of Arts, &c. Police Magistrate, Octavius Armstrong,
also president of the School of Arts. L. G. Board is Acting
Land Commissioner. The religious bodies are: —Church
of England, Rev. C. A. Griffith ; Roman Catholic, Rev. C.
Rossilini visits ; Wesleyan, occasional preachers visit.
Nanango,
Sixty-eight miles on sea coast; 120 miles N.W. of
Brisbane. The country is chiefly occupied by pastoralists
and graziers, but has splendid forest land, utilised by
timber-getters and wattle-bark strippers. Selectors and
cultivators are rapidly occupying the waste lands, and
farms dot the landscape. The nearest railways are Kil-
kivan, 46 miles; Esk, 68 miles; Jondaryan, 70 miles.
Population, 1866 census, 200. A. Lee is Police Magistrate,
Land Commissioner, Land Agent, and Goldfields V\ arden.
Churches—Church of England (visited); Roman Catholic,
visited from Halby. State School: Teachers, T. G. and Mrs.
Kerby ; with average attendance of 50. There is a Race
Club and School of Arts ; lion, secretary of both, John
Barley (also agent for several insurance companies).
Hotels : Star, and Burnett Inn. Four wholesale and
general stores. Nanango, formerly known as “ Good’s
Inn,” was a favourite camping spot for teamsters, feed and
water being obtainable.
Gin Gin,
A township on the Bundaberg line, 28 miles from Bunda-
berg and 800 miles north of Brisbane. Population, 160.
The late T. P. Pugh was for years Visiting Magistrate.
C.P.S., P. Fleming; Post and Telegraph Master and
Registrar, J. W. Bear ; Police Constable, P. Fleming, in
charge; Mechanics’ Institute —Library, 500 volumes ;


secretary, E. L. Tonsel; chairman, A. Lund. Provisional
school—-D. Wagner, head teacher; 40 scholars. State
school just erected. Two hotels—Queen’s and Gin Gin.
Three stores. Sawmill, A. Greedy.
The district is chiefly devoted to sugar culture and
manufacture, and it has several good mills for crushing,
with powerful machinery.
Eidsvold,
A mining township on Boundary Creek, a tributary of the
Burnett River, 55 miles from Mount Perry. Has extensive
gold and copper deposits. Much capital has been expended in
developing the reefs, and in some instances good returns
have been made.
Isis Scrub
Is a dense, undulating, prolific tract of country, extending
about twelve miles from north to south and the same
distance east to west. It lies about twenty miles from
Bundaberg, and is undoubtedly the largest available scrub
area in the district, and is recognised as the best suited for
sugar cane. The Isis and Woongarra scrubs belong to
the Bundaberg sugar centre, and undoubtedly both had
the same volcanic origin.
Little can be said of the Isis Scrub beyond twelve years,
though Mr. Lamb, who has a selection on the Isis Biver, was
its first settler, about 20 years back, when the spot was the
home of the timber-getters and rough bushmen. The belts
of truly magnificent pines on the edges of the scrub caused
fully twenty or thirty bullock teams to be in constant use
for hauling. T. W. Butcher, who had a selection on the
south-end road, a mile and a-half from Horton, drew
rations for the timber-getters ; but settlement there was
none till 1879, when William Horton (after whom the
village is named) arrived, and with him Messrs. N. Cocking,
of Abingdon, John Hendle, and others. All these selected
near the scrub, and Mr. Lamb, one of the party, was
licensee of the Abingdon Hotel before the township was
proclaimed. About this period Ramsay and Co., of Mary-
borough, took up several miles of land and sub-leased the
area in single square miles. Most of the tracks in use as
main roads were cleared by timber-getters—that from


Grant’s Camp to Apple-tree Creek, a distance of five miles,
being once the main road. The timber was hauled to the
nearest point of the Isis River, eleven miles off, and then
rafted to Mitchem, at the junction of the Isis and Burrum
rivers. Steamers called at Mitchem with rations, and
took the rafts to Maryborough. On account of the swift
current in the Isis River, many logs got adrift, and it was
reckoned lucky if 10 per cent, only were lost. Mitchem
then was a swamp, and steamers discharged their freights
of stores utterly regardless of the fact that high tides would
swamp the place where they were left; consequently, on
many occasions 50 per cent, of the victuals was destroyed
or wasted. That and the deduction by the Maryborough
sawmillers of 10 per cent, for correct measurement of
timber —and only paid for such—made the timber-getters’
avocation by no means profitable. On Ramsay and Co.
going out of business, all the Isis pine was consigned to
Messrs. Wilson and Hart at Maryborough.
Mr. Johnson, of Apple-tree Creek, and others, have
since turned their attention to other pursuits. About 9 years
ago Mr. Horton, as secretary of the Isis Railway League,
drew up a petition to Parliament, that a railway might be
constructed from the terminus, then at the Burrum—
through Abingdon, and the eastern portion of the scrub, to
Bundaberg. After events proved the petition was useless.
Guilders,
Formerly familiarly known as Isis Scrub, is an important-
agricultural and farming tract now thickly settled. During
the 1896 season the cane gave a maximum of 100 tons per
acre. The Isis promises to become a very populous part
of the country, selections being rapidly taken up. Judging
by the Isis News (a spirited little paper), it is to become
“ the seat of a great trade and commercial centre.”
Isis is under the management of a Divisional Board,
most of whom form the Progress Association. Those
lately elected are as follows :—Presidents, Messrs. Geo.
Eales and J. Broadhurst; Vice-president, J. R. Wrench;
Treasurer, E. Engistrom; Secretary, A. H. Beiers ; Com-
mittee, Messrs. R. Gaut, W. Brand, W. Thompson, G.
Upham, W. M. Johnson, A. Sheridan, J. H. Thompson,
P. L. Rosenlund; Auditors, Messrs. G. Eales and J,
A. Slater.


Court Pride of the Isis, A.O.F.—C.R., 0. Lehman;
S.C.R , W. Reedman ; S.W., J. Pizzey ; J.W., J. McGuffy ;
5.8., J. A. Slater; J. 8., H. Hendle; Treasurer, F.
Brady; A.S., J. Broadhurst.
The Rev. T. Ashburner, M.A., rector of St. Andrew’s,
One-mile, Gympie, was transferred to Christ Church,
Childers, as rector, in July, 1896.
A hospital on the cottage principle, as proposed by Dr.
Challands, is likely to be established.
Isis Progress Association.—Messrs. Geo. Bales (chair-
man), R. Gaut, W. Brand, W. E. Engistrom, N. Sorensen,
N. L. Roselund, Geo. Upham, A. Kling, and A. H.
Beiers (hon. secretary).
The Isis Divisional Board meets here fortnightly.
Officers and members—Messrs. W. Cran (chairman), W.
Watson, W. C. Clayton, A. C. Walker, R. iWebb, F. J.
Watkins, D. P. White, T. H. Wells; clerk, C. D. W.
Rankin.
Hospital, School of Arts, and Sports Reserve are among
latest improvements.
Bopple, or Bauple,
Takes its name from Mount Bopple, a wooded hill,
about l,ooolt. above sea level, and its ascent is no ordinary
feat. The view from the top is described as wonderful.
The country below presents a flat appearance, of dark
brown colour, relieved at intervals by green patches of
cultivated land. As one of the attractions of the Wide
Bay District, visitors should include it in their list.
> Bopple is about twenty miles from Maryborough, and
distant from Nether by Station about two miles; contains
some 250 inhabitants, and has a Post and Telegraph Office.
A Provisional school was established a few years ago, but
now a State school is to be erected.
Religious Sunday services are held here by the Rev. J.
Stewart (Presbyterian), and Rev. W. Shenton (Primitive
Methodist).
Cordalba, North Isis, and Tawah Creek.
This splendid tract of pastoral and agricultural country
extends westward, and signs of progress are apparent in
railway extension, and the Isis branch to Tawah Creek
and Paradise Goldfield. 20,000 acres of rich lands south


of Booyal have been thrown open in blocks of from 160
acres to 820 acres, making this one of the finest agricultural
districts in the colony. The advancement of the locality is
in the hands of the Childers and Cordalba Progress
Association, and the taking up of small blocks only will
in future be permitted.
Kilkivan,
A cluster of small mining settlements about 45 miles west
of Gympie, near the foot of the Main Range, includes the
reefing hamlet of Black Snake, and the Mount Coora and
Mount Clara copper mines, five miles distant. The popu-
lation is fluctuating. Some of the reefs are very rich.
Kilkivan was first occupied as a stock station by J. D,
Mactaggart.
Gayndah,
One of the oldest towns in Southern Queensland, has long
occupied a leading position in trade and pastoral progress.
It was many years ago more closely identified with Mary-
borough than at present, the latter town being the
recognised entrepot for the district. In 1860, teams
carrying wool and station supplies on the roads were fully
1000 ; at present this traffic is confined to rail carriage.
Gayndah is a municipal town in the Burnett Electorate,
on the Upper Burnett River, 80 miles W. from Mary-
borough by mail coach (thrice a week). Stock-raising is
the chief industry, agriculture being limited ; though in tho
district wheat and other cereals have been grown with
success. The railway to connect with Maryborough has
been surveyed, and is expected soon to be opened. Legis-
lative representative—W. P. McCord (elected 1896).
OWANTILLA,
A hamlet on the Mary River, midway between Maryborough
and Tiaro, where 80 years ago the native police had
quarters under the various commands of Messrs. Bligh,
Morrisett, Murray, Walker, Uhr, Harris, Blackney, Price,
and Freudenthal. In 1864, on petition proclaimed • a
township, Messrs. E. T. Aldridge, Linklater, Thompson,
and Nicholls, of Clifton Brook Station, being purchasers at
land sales. Cooper’s Plains, as it was then called,
attracted settlement, and soon the place became of


importance. The following properties, with their owners,
will doubtless be familiar to our readers : —Dendrobium,
Mr. Illidge; Ferney, Mr. P. O’Kelly; Yardly, Mr.
Pountney; Messrs. Rickett and Pronger’s plantation and
mill (afterwards bought by Mr. Brown, of Antigua); and
Mr. Walter Hay’s paddocks and slaughter-yards.
Kanighin,
About five miles east of Kanyan railway station, on a
branch of Gootchie Creek; in bygone days famed for its
pine and hardwood, and the sort known as “ mill timber.”
A large quantity of good cane-growing land is still available
east of Kanighin Mountain. Mr. R. McGuigan, of the
Island Plantation, reported favorably on the land for the
Maryborough Sugar Mill Company, A tramline to connect
this locality with Mount Bopple Central Mill is projected.
A public school has been discussed, and applied for.
Gootchie (aboriginal “ Cootchie, ,? figuana) is situated on
the road to Kilkivan, and distant from Maryborough about
28 miles. Provisional school—Chairman, Mr. Phillips ;
Secretary, Mr. Missing; Treasurer, Mr. Davis. Through
the exertions of Messrs. Phillips and Missing, the requisite
funds for completing the new school and teacher’s residence
were obtained, and the provisional school building is now
second to none in the colony.
Gootchie Progress Association.—Mr. Phillips, Chairman ;
P. Knudsen, Secretary ; C. Diver, Treasurer.
NOTE.
In concluding this volume, the author begs to state that
in consequence of space-limits, many voluminous reports,
events, and descriptions of local undertakings, deserving a
place in the History, are omitted. Such shortcomings and
inevitable errors will be corrected in a second edition,
which it is projected to publish to complete the necessary
records. The author sincerely thanks all who have fur-
nished suitable matter, and given him permission to glean
extracts from documentary and other sources required to
compile the present “ History of Maryborough.”

OUR Flour is Equal to any in Australia. Flattering reports from Squatters and
graziers as to its keeping qualities. All germ is extracted so that fustiness cannot
result. Wide Bay and Burnett Farmers : Why do you not grow wheat? The Market is
here ! We consumed, for the twelve months ending August 31st, 1896—158,338 bushels,
for which we paid £32,017 cash. All this wheat was imported from the Southern
Colonies and America. It would require 10,000 acres to produce the above quantity,
whereas not more than 20 acres were grown in the whole Wide Bavand Burnett district
last year. To Flour Consumers: The “C in Diamond ” Brand of Flour should be pro-
curable at every store. Kindly ask for it. Our Flour is milled from the Finest Wheat,
and used by all the principal Bakers in Gympie and Maryborough. Im-
porters of flour naturally run down Queensland-made flour, and create prejudice.
Why ? Because they make double the profit on inferior flour and the consumer suffers.
