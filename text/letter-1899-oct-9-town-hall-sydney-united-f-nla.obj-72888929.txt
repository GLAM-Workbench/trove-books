United Federal Executive.
We are directed by the United Federal Executive, consisting of representatives
from the Australasian Federation League, Federal Association, and Ministerial and
Opposition supporters in the Legislative Assembly, to enclose herewith copy of a General
Resolution, conveying a vote of thanks to yourself and other workers in the late Federal
Campaign. There is every cause to be gratified at the magnificent result attained
by the Federalists of New South Wales on the 20th June. The decisive majority,
whereby the Commonwealth Bill was approved at so large a vote of the Electors,
proves the strong hold which the principles of Federation have gained upon the minds
of the people. To the vigorous and self-sacrificing efforts not only of Federalists
in the Metropolis, but also the Branch Leagues in the Country Districts, it is
felt that much of the credit for this result is due. The Branches in the Suburban
Districts have done equally valuable work in reducing the local majority against
the Bill, in the face of great opposition.
The enclosed memento of the success of the Federation Movement in
this Colony is therefore forwarded for your acceptance. Kindly address any
communication to Hon. Secretary of Australasian Federation League, Sydney Town
Hall.
Yours truly,
EDWARD DOWLING )
