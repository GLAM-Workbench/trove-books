JUSTICES OF THE PEACE
FOE THE
COLONY OF VICTORIA,
iHamial
38 INSCRIBED, BY THEIE OBEDIENT SERVANT
THE AUTHOR.


PREPACE.
The object of this little work has been stated in the
introductory paragraph to the first part. It is no reflec-
tion upon the magistrates, that they may require such
assistance in the prosecution of their duties, as is here
proffered. But it ivill be a reflection upon them if, having
such assistance within their reach, they do not avail them-
selves of it. The task, trifling as it may appear, has been
a task to the compiler, and has been undertaken solely
with a view to aid the Magistracy, and in consequence,
partly, of a wish expressed by some of their own body.
Any help, however, which they may find from the fol-
lowing pages, is well deserved. The community is much
indebted to those gentlemen who gratuitously act as Jus-
tices of the Peace, Avhen it is considered how few are so
situated as to be able to afford leisure for attention to the
duties of the office, without some degree of pecuniary,
sacrifice, and not often without much personal inconveni-
ence. Such a class deserves all the respect and encour-
agement which their position primd facie invites; and
without any disparagement to the services and efficiency
of the stipendiary magistrates, it is to be hoped that the
unsalaried holders of commisions of the peace will always
form a considerable portion of the Victorian Magistracy.
? With all their defects,? as was said of the British
Magistrates in a recent article in the ? Law Times,? which
are undeniable, they do substantial justice ; it is no small
advantage that our gentry should thus be induced to take


part in the business of the country, and to acquaint them-
selves with the feelings and manners of the people, as by
no other means could have been so well effected.? And
of our own Magistrates, the defects are undoubtedly
? undeniablebut in no greater degree than they appear
to exist in the mother country, with all its superior aids
and appliances. Speaking of ? commitments,? the writer
above referred to thus expresses himself:?? It is high
time that something should be done to induce Magistrates
to be more cautious in committing for trial on criminal
charges. At every assises and sessions cases occur in
which there is no evidence whatever against the prisoner,
who has perhaps been subjected to the degradation and
ruin of imprisonment in a gaol, without any proof of
guilt that could be listened to for a moment in a Court of
Justice. We know that this has been lamented by many
of the Judges, that complaints have been made by them
of the improper commitals that are brought under their
notice, and that it is the desire of most of them that some
plan should be devised to prevent so grievous an abuse of
the forms of justice.? The Australian Colonies, there-
fore, it would seem, are not singular in the possession of a
fallible Magistracy; and certainly, in Victoria, they de-
serve no such severe reproach as is implied in the para-
graph above cited. It is not to be expected, however,
that, removed as they are from all access to books or pro-
fessional assistance, especially in the country districts,
they will not sometimes commit errors; and if it be
desirable, as suggested in regard to the Magistrates of
England, that ? the Home Secretary should send to all
of them a circular, describing their duties, and urging
more caution,? such a course would seem to be a fortiori
desirable with regard to the Magistrates of a scattered
and newly formed Colony such as this. In place of such


a ?circular? as above suggested, tlje following pages have
been compiled. Since it was finished, the compiler?s
attention has been called to the Imperial Statute, 14 and
16 Viet., c.93, (passed August, 1851,) and he has been
glad to find that many of his suggestions, as to police office
practice, have in that Statute been made matter of positive
enactment. It is not improbable that some of its provi-
sions may hereafter be introduced into our own Legislature,
and, but for its interference with the course of practice
already in progress under Jervis?s Acts, its entire adoption
would, with slight modification, have been a desirable mea-
sure. The community, however, may feel satisfied that,
under the watchful eye of our able and energetic Attorney
General, any improvement of which our Colonial code
may be found susceptible, will be speedily discovered, and
as speedily carried into effect. It remains only to be
observed that nothing in these pages must be looked
upon as of judicial authority; their compilation having
been carefully framed with a view to the avoidance of any
expression of individual opinion upon points open, either
from doubt or difficulty, to future litigation.
The great expense of printing, in these times, has alone .
prevented the compiler from adding to the Manual the
whole of Jervis?s Acts in extenso ; but as the Acts them-
selves are, or ought to be, in the hands of the Magis-
trates, and the forms connected therewith have been
distributed by Government, the want will be the less felt.
The forms given in the ? Manual ? arc not in Jervis?s Act,
but are, mostly, taken from Oke?s 1 Formalist,? a work
which , in conjunction with Oke?s ? Magisterial Synopsis,?
the compiler cannot too strongly recommend every Magis-
trate to procure.

PART I.
the
MAGISTRATES? MANUAL,
FOR THE
COLONY OF VICTORIA.
The object of the following pages is to furnish a few
practical directions to magistrates, in their minis-
terial and judicial functions, in such plain and
untechnical language as to form a guide which may
be both easily understood and easily followed. It is
not designed to make their various duties the subject
of an elaborate treatise, or even of a comprehensive
survey; but simply to call their attention to such of
them as are of most frequent occurrence, or of para-
mount importance, and to present an intelligible state-
ment of the manner in which they should be performed.
For anything beyond this the writer has not leisure,
and even the brief manual now attempted may, he
fears, bear marks of the presure of those vocations,
in the midst of which, it is unavoidably compiled.
In entering upon the task contemplated it has
been taken for granted that the recent Act of
Council adopting the three British Statutes known
as Jervis? Acts, is in the hands of every Magis-
strate; for without this, he would neither ap-
prehend his own duties, nor the suggestions here
offered as to the manner in which they should be
discharged.


The Act alluded to is the 14th Vic. No. 43, in-
tituled ?An Act to adopt and apply certain Ads of
? ? Parliament passed for facilitating the performance
?of the duties of Justices of the Peace , and for pro-
u tecting them from vexatious actions , and to prevent
? persons convicted of offences from taking undue ad-
u vantage of mere defects or errors in form.? The
nature and object of the Act, and of the Statutes
adopted hy it, have been very fully analyzed and
explained, in a recent publication by Mr. G. R.
Nichols; but the main object with which these
pages are compiled may be achieved by a work of
far less pretension, and of considerably smaller
bulk.
Preliminary The first Act adopted (11 &12 Viet. c. 42)
imiict'abie m relates to the Law and Practice of procedure before
offences, Justices of the Peace out of Quarter Sessions, with
respect to indictable offences, and the examination
and committal of accused persons for trial; and, as
regulated thereby, will now be considered such por-
tions of the Magistrate?s duties as, in the words before
used, involve proceedings ?of most frequent occur-
rence or of paramount importance.?
With respect to the apprehension of offenders, the
first fifteen sections have all reference thereto; but
it is proposed only to dwell upon those which
relate to charges made before the magistrate himself,
who is required to issue a warrant or summons in
respect thereof.
what to be By the first section, the Justice is empowered to
considered
before iasu- issue either a warrant or summons in all cases where
complaint is made before him ? that any person has
on charge committed, or is suspected to have committed, any
preferred. / i / �/
treason , felony , or indictable misdemeanour , or other
indictable offence whatsoever .? Whenever, then, a
complaint of the above-mentioned description is made
before him, he should, in the first instance, assure
himself that it has some foundation in fact, and that
it amounts also to an indictable offence in Law.
For notwithstanding the maxim that every one is
presumed to know the Law, it is every day?s expe-


rience that the majority are very ignorant of its
provisions; and the consequence is, that individuals
are frequently brought to a police office, or handed
over to a constable, to answer for acts for which they
are amenable, only, to a Court of Civil Judicature.
The Magistrate, therefore, will do well to require from
parties making charges a definite statement of their
complaint; not necessarily a minute and circum-
stantial detail of every particular, but, at least, such
a clear account of the matter as to satisfy him, first
that, in point of Law, an indictable offence is im-
puted, and, secondly, that, in point of fact, the
offence charged has been ?? or that there is strong
reason for suspecting that it has been actually
committed.
Having heard the charge preferred, he will exer-
cise his discretion in granting a warrant or a sum-
mons. If he adopt the former, he will find from
the Eighth section, that he cannot do so until the
charge has been reduced to writing, and verified on
oath. As to the manner in which this, and other
matters directed by the Act, should be done, a guide
is furnished to him in the various forms appended to
the Act, ? which forms? or ? forms to the same or
like effect,? the 28th section declares, ? shall be
deemed good, valid, and sufficient in Law.? This,
however, does not proscribe the use, or impair the
validity, of any other forms; but it will be better,
nevertheless, where it can be done, to follow those
given by the Act.*
To render more intelligible the preceding directions
by a supposititous case, let it be imagined that
John Smith gives information to a justice, that his
watch has been stolen from him by Thomas Jones.
* By the 7th section of the 14th Yid>. No. 43. the forms may
be varied in the manner therein provided, and published, when
complete, in the Gazette. This has been done in Victoria ; but
as the same letters of reference have been preserved, and the
forms themselves not varied, no distinction has been made be-
tween those published in the Gazette and those given in the
Schedule to the Act.


Smith should be required to state verbally the cir-
cumstances of the theft; the time and place when
and where his watch was lost; when he first missed
it; how ho knows it was stolen ; and how 7 he has
ascertained, or why he suspects, Jones to have stolen
it. If he answ r er these questions satisfactorily, the
charge founded on his statement may then be re-
duced to writing, and, after he has sworn to a belief
of its truth, a warrant may be issued. The justice wall
remark the words, ? charge founded on his statement
for it is not necessary to take down the statement itself
for the purposes of a warrant. It is advisable to
obtain such statement, in order that the magistrate
may ascertain whether the circumstances of the case
be such as to justify a warrant instead of a summons,
but the facts wdiich he has thereby elicited, as a
guide for his discretion, need not be incorporated in
the warrant, if he be determined upon issuing
one.
Smith , then, having satisfied him that he {Smith)
has good grounds for accusing Jones of having stolen
his watch, the charge may be taken down as
follows: ?
?tj The information and complaint of John Smith, of
v ictoria | 1 ?
to wit. j Melbourne, in the Colony of Victoria (labourer),
taken this day of in the
year of our Lord 185 , before the undersigned A. 8., one of (or
if more than one, before us) Her Majesty?s Justices of the peace,
in and for the said Colony, who saith, that Thomas Jones (or
if he did not see Jones take the watch , that he hath just cause to
believe and suspect, and doth believe and suspect, that Thomas
Jones) of in the said Colony, labourer, did on or
about the day of last, at ,
in the Colony aforesaid, feloniously steal, take, and carry away
one silver watch, the property of the said John Smith.
This should be signed by Smith , and an oath in
the following words, should be then administered to
him :
? You, John Smith, do swear that the contents of
this your information, signed by you, are true and


correct, to the best of your knowledge and belief,
So help you God.?
The Justice will then add his attestation thus:?
? Sworn before me the day and year first alove
mentioned, at in the Colony aforesaid.
J. S.
The next step is granting the Warrant, which,
with the exception of the direction, may be in the
form given in the Schedule (B). The direction may,
to quote from Mr. Nichols, ? either be to the con-
stable by name, or generally to the constable of the
place or district within which it is to be executed, or
to such constable of the district, &c.?
The ? offence charged? as to time, place, and de-
scription, may, in all cases, be in the same terms as
those employed in the Information or Complaint,
if they be there properly stated ; but care must be
taken that the charge sufficiently appears on the
warrant to authorise the constable?s putting it in
force; as otherwise, in the event of resistance, he
would be unable, legally, to oppose force by force.
Not unfrequently has the writer of these pages had
under his eye, warrants, in which the party ap-
prehended thereon, was charged, simply, with
? felony,? which amounts, in Law, to no charge at all.
The particular offence should always be specified,
and in such terms as to leave no doubt that a felony
or indictable offence is charged. In order to furnish
a ready reference, a few forms are appended to this
treatise, showing how the ?offence charged? should
be stated, in regard to such crimes as are of most
frequent occurrence in this Colony.
Thus far it has been presumed that a Warrant
has been granted by the Justice ; but as in the ex-
ercise of his discretion he might see fit only to issue
a summons, the mode of proceeding in the latter
case will have to be considered.
It is provided, by the Bth section, ? thad in all
cases where it is intended to issue a summons instead


of a warrant in the first instance, it shall not he
necessary that such information and complaint shall he
in writing, or he sworn to or affirmed in manner
aforesaid, hid in every such case such information and
complaint may he hy parol merely, and without any
oath or affirmation whatsoever to support or substantiate
the same.? This does not prohibit the taking of an
information in writing and on oath; but merely
dispenses with its necessity, where the Justice de-
termines only to issue a summons. There might be
cases, however, in which, even before issuing a sum-
mons, he would do well to require of the informant
something more than his mere verbal statement;
and the consequences ? are so serious to any man,
whether as regards his character or his pocket, of
being called on to answer a criminal charge, that no
one would blame a Magistrate for receiving, with
great care and caution, statements which, even under
the restraint of an oath, are from the lips of an
interested and excited accuser, not always to be de-
pended on.
Assuming that a summons is granted, the form
given in the Schedule to the Act (C) should be
followed. The mode of service is pointed out by the
9th section, which enacts, ? that it shall he served hy
a constable or other peace officer , upon the person to
whom it is directed, hy delivering the same to the party
personally, or, if he cannot conveniently he met with,
then hy leaving the same with some person for him, at
his last or most usual place of abode, and the constable
or other peace officer who shall have served the same
in manner aforesaid, shall attend at the time and place
and before the Justices in the said summons mentioned
to depose, if necessary, to the service of such summons.?
If the party summoned does not attend at the time
specified, the Justice may issue a warrant for his
apprehension, which warrant may be according to
the form in the Schedule of the Act (D). Before
granting the warrant, however, the deposition of the
constable on oath must be taken of the service of the
summons; to render which effectual the Justice
should, on issuing the summons, cause a copy of it
to be made out and compared with the original hy


the constable who is to serve it , for, it will be observed,
that the Act directs that the service of the summons
shall be both made and deposed to, by the constable
to whom it is delivered.
This would seem to render it necessary that the
constable should be able to read ; for it does not
very easily suggest itself how he could make himself
acquainted with the contents of the summons, except
by comparison with the copy. Assuming that he is
able to read, and has examined the copy and original
together, the following form will answer for his
deposition:?
Victoria ) e P os^on J* N., constable of the ,
to wit. j the said (Colony), taken upon oath before me
the undersigned, one of Her Majesty?s Justices of
the Peace for the said (Colony), this day of
185 , who saith that he served A. 8., mentioned in the an-
nexed (within) summons, with a duplicate thereof, on the
day of last, personally (or by leaving
the same with N. O. at the said A. B.?s usual place of abode at
N. in the said Colony).
Before me,
Before the deposition is made, the copy of the
summons referred to should be attached to the depo-
position by a tape and sealing wax ; and the Justice
before whom it is taken should endorse on the copy
of the summons these words, ? This is the copy of
the summons referred to in the deposition of
(Constable) hereto annexed,? adding his signature
as well as to the deposition itself.
If the constable to whom the summons is delivered
cannot read, (which is not at all an improbable
supposition) some means must be contrived for veri-
fying the service in another way, than through the
medium of the constable?s perusal and comparison.
All that he can swear to in such case, is the fact of
having left with the party served, a certain piece of
paper handed to him by a certain person ; but of its
contents he can affirm, of his own knowledge , nothing.


f
It will be necessary, therefore, for some other person
(say the Clerk of the Bench) to ascertain by his
own comparison that a correct copy has been made
of the original summons, before the latter is delivered
to the constable employed to serve it. Having made
such copy and compared it with the summons, the
party making it should take it into his own charge,
and deliver with his own hand to the constable the
original; explaining at the same time to him its
contents. He should then indorse on the copy the
following memorandum?? Delivered to constable
(his name) the original of this copy, on (day of the
week) the day of 1852,
at about o?clock, a.m., or p.m., having pre-
viously compared the original and copy, and ex-
plained to the said (constable) the contents of the
former, and named the party upon whom it was
to be served.?
Signed,
J. S.
This particularity will enable him to make the
deposition hereinafter suggested, should the party
served not attend, and a warrant be required to
apprehend him. The deposition may be a joint one
with the constable, and may be in the following
form: ?
Victoria) ?I 0 * 11 *' several deposition of (
to wit. | Clerk of the Bench, &c., at ( ) in the
said Colony, and of ( ) constable of
( ) in the said Colony, taken upon oath before me)
the undersigned, one &c., this day of
185 ,of whom the first-named deponent, for himself, saith that
he did on day of , at about
o?clock at in the said Colony, deliver
to the above-named (constable) the original summons, of which
the paper writing hereto annexed purports to be, a copy, and, at
the same time, explained to him the contents thereof, and men-
tioned to him the name of (the party named in the summons) as
the party to be served therewith. And the said
further saith that previously to delivering the said
original summons to the said (constable) he compared and ex-
amined it with the said paper writing hereto annexed, and found


it to be a true and correct [copy thereof, and that the same
paper writing is now in the same state as it was when the said
so examined it, as aforesaid, and is, to the'best of
his belief, a true and accurate copy of the said original summons.
And the deponent, the said ( constable ) for himself saith that on
or about the day of he, the said
('constable) received from the hands of ( cleric of Bench)
the first-named deponent, a paper writing which the said
[clerk of Bench) explained!] to him the said [constable] to be a
summons one [party served ] to appear before
[justice's name'] on the day of at
o?clock sn|the forenoon, or before such other justice
or justices as should be then and there, to answer the charge
mentioned in the said summons. And the said summons so
delivered to him by the said (Clerk of Bench) as aforesaid, he
served personally on the said (party served) mentioned in the
said summons, or by leaving the same with ( )
at the said ( ) most usual (or last) place of abode
at in the said Colony.
Signatures | [cStlf Bench]
Before me
J. S. (Justice?s Signature.)
This affidavit will fully authorise the Justice
in granting his warrant to apprehend the party
served in case of his non-attendance. Care should
be taken that sufficient time be allowed for the
service of the summons, and the appearance of the
party served by inserting a day not too near at
hand ; and on the day named for the appearance of
the party to be served, the constable employed to
serve it should be in attendance to prove, if neces-
sary, the service; for no warrant can be granted
without such proof by him, vide 9th Section.
It remains to be observed, that by the latter part
of the Ist section of the Act, the Justice may, if he
think fit, issue his warrant before the time fixed for
the return of the summons ; circumstances might
render such a course expedient, but, in that case, an
information in writing, and on oath must be pre-
viously taken ; as to which and the warrant by which
it is to be followed, the directions previously given
will equally apply. If it be added that the warrant

already said on this preliminary stage ot his minis-
terial duties, sufficient information to render any
further aid unnecessary, than what he may readily
derive from the Act itself.


PART 11.
The party accused having appeared to answer the
charge against him, and, the witnesses being in at-
tendance to give evidence, the Magistrates are at
liberty to determine, if they think fit, that the
examination shall be conducted in private. This
power is conferred on them by the 19th section, and
although it is one which should be sparingly used,
there will be occasions when not merely the par-
ticular features of the crime itself, but the peculiar
circumstances of the times in which it is perpetrated
render it desirable that such a power should not be
overlooked. It is recommended, however, that in
all such cases the Attorney of the accused, if one be
employed, should be permitted to be present at the
examination, in order that he might have the oppor-
tunity of cross-examining the witnesses; for it is to
be borne in mind that, under a provision to that
effect in the Act, the depositions of witnesses taken
before the committing magistrates may, upon the
death of such witnesses, or their inability through
illness to attend the trial, be read in evidence
against the accused. A pledge, in such cases, should
be required of the Attorney not to publish the result
of the examination, in the event of his violating
which, the magistrates might decline to allow his
attendance on any future criminal case.
The hearing of the charge, whether public or
private, is to be conducted according to the pro-
visions of the 17th section, which enacts in
substance:?
Ist.? That the accused party is not to be ad-
mitted to bail, or committed for trial, until ?a
statement has been taken on oath or affirmation, of
those who shall know the fads and circumstances of
the cased ?


2nd.? That such statement shall be in the presence
of the accused , who shall be at liberty to put questions
to any witness produced against him.
3rd. ?That before any evidence is given by any
witness, the justice before whom he shall appear shall
administer to him the usual oath or affirmation.
4th. ? That after the witness has given his
evidence, his deposition shall be read over and signed
by him, and shall be signed also by the Justice or
Justices before whom such deposition is taken.
From the above it will be seen that a particular
course of proceeding is prescribed, which is some-
what at variance with the former practice. In the
first place no previous statements or information,
even though on oath, should be adopted as evidence
against the accused; but the deponent should be
sworn again , and his statement then given he reduced
to writing from his own lips in the presence of the
prisoner , as well as that of the other.witnesses to be
examined in support of the charge. The person
taking down the evidence should have at hand a
form similar to that given in the Schedule (M),
which should be filled up with the names of the
witnesses in attendance, and a statement of the charge
in respect to which they are about to be examined.
This is called the caption of the depositions, and when
once stated, need not be repeated; but the deposi-
tions of all witnesses whose names are not mentioned
in the caption must show by the heading of them
that they are taken in reference to the charge
mentioned in the caption, otherwise they will be
inadmissable at the trial, should they be tendered
as evidence under the provisions of the 17th section.
The caption of the deposition, having been written
out, the first witness to be examined should be
sworn, and it would seem from the words of the Act
should be sworn by the Justice himself. No infor-
mation need be taken, or if previously taken, again
sworn to, the charge sufficiently appearing from its
statement in the caption; as to which the evidence


is to be taken irrespective of the information on oath
on which a warrant may have been granted. The
deposition of a witness mentioned in the caption may
commence as in the form: ?? This deponent, C.D.,
on his oath, saith as follows,? and should be con-
tinued by the statement of the witness in, as near
as possible, the very words in which it is detailed.
The Act evidently contemplates that it should be
taken down in the first person ; and, indeed, before
the passing of the Act, this course was always
recommended by the English Judges as the proper
one to be pursued. It is not necessary that every-
thing which a witness says should be taken down;
but whatever is taken down should be stated, as far
as possible, in his own words. No attempt should
be made to abbreviate his statement by giving what
may be conceived to be its substance or purport.
Neither should the witnesses themselves be allowed
to state their own conclusions from facts instead of
the facts themselves, from which the conclusion may
be drawn. If, for instance, a constable say, ? when
I apprehended the prisoner, I told him why, and he
confessed the charge , he should be desired to repeat
the exact conversation which took place between him
and the prisoner, and such conversation only, and
not the constable?s summary of it, as above supposed,
should be taken down. On the same principle,
when such expressions as ?he denied it ,? ?he con-
cealed it ,? ?he prevaricated ,? ?he refused ,? and
similar assumptive assertions are used by a witness,
he should be requested to explain the particular
circumstances; to state the facts, or words , which
amount, in his own mind, to the denial, concealment,
prevarication, or refusal, to which he swears.
A witness should also be stopped in repeating
hearsay, or any thing that was told him by others,
if it was not in the presence and hearing of the
person accused. Witnesses undoubtedly will fre-
quently mix up their testimony with hearsay, and
in such cases it may be difficult to extract their
statement exactly as given; but still the effort
should be made ; - and if they persist in recapitulat-
ing the hearsay in such a manner as to make it


impossible to disentangle it from the other portion
of their evidence without making a statement for,
instead of receiving one from them, the whole had
better be taken down. In such cases, however, the
hearsay evidence ought not to affect the justice?s
decision on the charge.
Another ingredient in the deposition, which it
will be well to observe, is the addition or description
of the deponent. When the name of the witness
has been given, the justice should ask him his
calling or vocation; for so apparently trifling a
matter furnishes a key sometimes to the evidence of
the witness, without which it might not be so sig-
nificant or intelligible. And the justice should
always bear in mind that the deposition he is taking
is to go before the Attorney-General, who, in de-
ciding on the prosecution or discharge of a party
committed for trial, should be able to see on the
face of the deposition, not only what the witnesses
have said, but who they are, or what they profess to
be. Indeed, every circumstance detailed by the
witness should be taken down with great care and
accuracy, particularly as regards time, place, and
persons, whenever named; and whenever these or
any other matters appear to be loosely or ambigu-
ously spoken of, the justice should call the attention
of the witness to these points; not by leading ques-
tions, but by such as tend to elicit the desired in-
formation from the witness himself, in his own
words. Should the accused interpose an observation
during the examination of a witness, it may be in-
serted in this manner; [? The prisoner here volun-
tarily says,? &c.] putting his very ivords. All this
may seem of little consequence to the justice at the
moment, but in the subsequent proceedings, to which
the Legislature had especial view, probably, in pro-
viding for the preliminary ones, any deviation from
the prescribed mode may be productive of very mis-
chievous consequences. Previous to the passing of
Jervis?s Acts, Baron Parke thus expressed himself
in reference to a case before him; ? Magistrates are
? required by law to put down the evidence of wit-
? nesses or so much thereof as shall be material.


u They have hitherto in many cases confined them-
? selves to what they deemed material; but in
u future it will be desirable that they should be ex-
li tremely careful in preparing depositions, and
il should make a full statement of all the witnesses
u say upon the matter in question, as the experience
?we have already had of the operation of the
? Prisoner?s Counsel Bill has shoAvn us how much
? time is occupied in endeavouring to establish con-
ic tradictions between the testimony of Avitnesses
? and their depositions in the omission of minute
? circumstances in their statements made before
? the magistrates as well as other particulars.?
No one can have attended the Courts in this
colony without perceiving hoAY much of its time is
frequently occupied, in criminal cases, in the same
manner as that described by the learned Baron. It
need hardly be pointed out that the care and exact-
ness recommended by him to the magistrates on the
taking of depositions have become matter of still
greater necessity in consequence of the possibility,
under the circumstances before mentioned, of the
depositions themselves being receivable as evidence
against the accused.
After each witness has concluded his deposition,
it is to be read over by him and signed both by
himself and the magistrate before whom it is taken;
but whether the deposition is to be signed before or
after cross-examination by the accused, or both be-
fore and after, if any cross-examination takes place,
it is not very easy to ascertain from the language of
the seventeenth section. The safe way would seem
to be, after the examination in chief lias been con-
cluded, to read it over to the witness, and let him
sign it, and then to ask the accused if he AA?ishes to
put any questions. If he does not, the magistrate
also can at once sign the deposition ; if he does, the
folloAYing entry may be made: ? The above-named
Avitness, A. 8,, was cross-examined as folloAVS by
the above-named C. D., the accused or, ?by Mr.
E. F., the attorney of the above-named C. D., the
accused.? If the accused himself cross-examine the


witness, the questions as well as answers should be
taken down; but if the answers have clearly no
bearing upon the charge, they need not be taken
down. After the cross-examination is finished, it
should be read over to and signed by the witness,
after which the magistrate may append his signa-
ture to the following attestation; ?The above de-
position and cross-examination of the witness A. 8.,
were respectively taken and sworn before me at
on the day and year first above mentioned.?
(Signature) J. S.
The course just suggested may, in the language
of the lawyers, be considered perhaps as one sug-
gested ex abundanti cautela , rather than one ten-
dered obligatory by the terms of the statute. Ihc
following extract, how T ever, from Saunders s edition of
Jervis?s Acts will shew that the construction is not
a singular one, which has led to the recommendation
of the course proposed : ? Although power is given
? to the accused to cross-examine, there is no pro-
? vision expressly requiring the justice to take down
? cis part of the depositions, such cross-examination,
? and hitherto in practice it has not been usual to
? take it. When, however, it is remembered that
? on the death or inability through illness to travel,
? of the witness, his deposition, which may involve
? the life of the accused, may be given in evidence,
? every consideration of justice and humanity le-
? quires that the prisoner?s cross-examination should
� be carefully taken and returned as a portion of the
? depositions. Indeed, the latter part of this clause
? (the 17th) appears to point to the depositions
? containing also the cross-examination; for it
11 also makes the depositions, in the case suggested,
? receivable as evidence only, on proof that the
? accused, his counsel or attorney, had a full op-
? portunity of cross-examining the witness; and it
? would be idle to cross-examine, or make the power
? to do so a condition for the reception of the de-
? positions, if they need not contain the cross-ex-
? amination itself. It may, therefore, be safely laid
? down that, although the Legislature has not so
? expressly exacted, yet it w T as obviously its inten-


? tion that the depositions should contain the cross-
? examinations where any in ffict have taken place.?
There is much force in the reasons for this construction,
and, whether it be the true legal one or not, it
will, at all events, be the safer one to adopt.
It has been already stated that although an in-
formation on oath has been taken, for the purpose
of bringing the accused before the Police Court, the
informant ought, nevertheless, to be examined as a
witness, and his evidence then given taken down on
the hearing of the charge. It will not be sufficient
even to swear the informant afresh, and read over
to him the contents of his information; for the ac-
cused has a right to hear all evidence used against
him given step by step , and is to be asked in refer-
ence to the evidence so given , whether he wishes to
put any questions to the witness. Care also should
be taken that he is not asked, once for all,
whether he wishes to ask the ivitnesses any questions
after all have been examined; but at the close of
the examination of each witness, he should be asked
in reference to them severally, whether he has any
questions to put. A recent case has shewn the ne-
cessity of attending to these points. It was pro-
posed to read the depositions of the prosecutrix, and
proof having been given that she was unable to
attend through illness, the counsel for the prosecu-
tion called upon the officer of the court to read the
deposition. Upon this, the Judge, Baron Platt, ob-
served : ? Something further is necessary. You
? must shew that the deposition was taken conform-
? ably with the statute.? The report then con-
tinues as follows: ?The magistrate?s clerk was
? called. He stated that the prisoner was present
u with her father when the deposition of the pro-
? secutrix was taken. The magistrate asked the
u prisoner- whether she had any questions to put;
? but there was a little uncertainty in the evidence
? of this witness, whether she was so asked with
? reference to the particular examination of the pro-
? secutrix, or whether it was a general question at
? the end of the examination of another witness. A
? police officer was then examined. He was a wit-


? ness on the same occasion. He could not recol-
? lect whether the prisoner was asked if she had
? any questions to put to the prosecutrix; hut he
? disclosed the fact that the examinations of the
? witnesses were taken and committed to writing by
? the clerk previously to the arrival of the magis-
? trate ; that they were then read over in the pre-
? sence and hearing of all parties, and that it was
? then, if at all, that the prisoner was asked if she
? had any questions to put to the prosecutrix.?
On this state of facts, it was submitted on behalf
of the Crown, that the statute had been sufficiently
complied with, if the deposition appeared on the face
of it to be regularly taken; but Baron Platt held
otherwise. ?It was,? he said, ? the duty of the
? magistrate to ask the prisoner if she had any
? questions to put, and it must be proved that he
? did so, and did so with reference to the examin-
? ation of the particular witness. Until she was
? asked, I am of opinion she had no opportunity of
il cross-examintion within the meaning of the sta-
? tute, and the evidence is not satisfactory on that
? point. But, on another ground, the prisoner had
? not an opportunity of cross-examination. The
? examination of the witness being taken down and
? put into writing before the arrival of the magis-
? trate, the reading it over in his presence coidd not
? give the prisoner a proper opportunity of cross-ex-
? animation. She had a right to hear the evidence
given step by step , and so to have time to consider
? what questions to put. I cannot allow the depo-
? sition to be read.?
The evidence for the prosecution and cross-ex-
amination thereon (if any) having been brought to
an end, the justices will, if there be no further evi-
dence to be called on the part of the prosecution,
consider whether they should take bail, or commit
the accused for trial. If they are of opinion that
the evidence is not sufficient for either purpose, they
may, by the 25th section, order him to be dis-
charged forthwith. Should they think it sufficient,
it will be necessary for them to address to the


accused the caution prescribed by the 18 th section;
and it is suggested by Mr. Oke, in his Magisterial
Synopsis, that ? unless there is a prima facie case
? against the accused, this caution had better not be
u read to him.? At all events, there can be no
necessity for such a course; for the accused is not
to be called on with a view of substantiating a
charge against himself; but of making a statement,
if he pleases, in reply to a charge already, prima
facie, substantiated. Assuming, however, that a
prima facie case has been made out by the evidence
for the prosecution, the justices may, if they think
fit, on such evidence alone , commit the accused for
trial, or admit him to bail. They must, however,
previously ? read or cause to he read to the accused
? the depositions taken against him, and shall saij to
u him ? the words contained in the 18th section,
usually called ? The Caution,? and whatever he then
says, in answer thereto, is to ?he taken down in
? writing, and shall he signed hy the justice or justices,
? and kept with the depositions of the witnesses, and
? shall he transmitted with them as hereinafter men-
? Honed? ? *
Let it be observed here that not only is the de-
position of each witness to be read over to him, after
he has given his evidence, but the whole of the de-
positions when completed, are to be read over to the
accused; otherwise, any statement which he may
make, in answer to the caution, cannot be given in
evidence against him. It seems also that the jus-
tices, or one of them, before whom the charge is
heard, must put the question prescribed by the
18th section, and consequently that, if it be put by
the clerk of the Bench, the statement will be ren-
dered inadmissible.
* The transmission of depositions is by the 2nd section of the
Colonial Act, 14 Viet. No. 43., directed in New South Wales to
be made to the Attorney-General, ?or in Port Phillip, to the
Crown Prosecutor for which latter, however, must now be
read Attorney-General, the functions of the Crown Prosecutor
having ceased in the Colony of Victoria.


In addressing the accused in the terms of the
caution in the first part of the 18th section, it will
be desirable also at the same time , to address him in
the terms of the proviso enjoined by the latter part
of the same section. The enactment in this proviso
is not mandatory, but simply directory , and is only
efficacious where any inducement or threat may have
been held out to the accused previously to his being
brought before the magistrate, in which case, if
proved at the trial, it would render his statement,
if an answer to the first part of the caution only , in-
admissible. It would be, therefore, advisable to
have, in addition to the first part given in the forms
in the schedule to the Act, the second part, or
proviso, also printed in the forms used by the ma-
gistrate. The addition might be as follows: ? And
? you are also dearly to understand that you have no-
? thing to hope from any promise of favor , and no-
? thing to fear from any threat which may have been
? holden out to you to induce you to make any admis-
-11 sion or confession of your guilt; hut whatever you
? shall now say may he given in evidence against you
? upon the trial , notwithstanding such promise or
u threat .? This course was recommended by Mr.
Justice Coleridge, at the Cornwall assizes, in July,
1850, in his charge to the Grand Jury, and the
adoption of it would certainly, as he observed,
? prevent any difficulties when the case came on for
? trial.?
If the prisoner make any statement after the
caution has been addressed to him, it should be
taken down as nearly as possible in his very words,
and if he be willing to sign it, it will be advisable to
get his signature thereto, reading it over to him
first. The justice will then add his signature as
prescribed in that form. It is hardly necessary,
perhaps, to observe that the accused is not to be
sworn to the truth of his statement; and if, by any
mistake, the justice sign the words, ? taken and
sworn before me,? the statement will be, thereby,
rendered inadmissible, for evidence will not be
received to show that, in point of fact, the accused


was not sworn, and that the words ? and sworn ?
had been inserted inadvertently.
As has been already stated, the magistrates may
commit the accused for trial, if they please, without
hearing any evidence olfered in his defence. The
better course, however, and one, apparently, more
in accordance with the spirit of the Act, w r ould be
to hear the witnesses for the accused, as well as
those for the prosecution. In the 17th section, the
magistrates are required to take the statement of
? those tvlio shall know the facts and circumstances of
the case;? and this they can scarcely be said to have
done, if they decline to hear any witness , who is
tendered for the purpose of deposing to such facts
and circumstances. There are cases in which a
charge, primd facie , well founded, may, by other
evidence, be totally rebutted; and to reject such
evidence merely because offered on the part of the
accused, appears to be neither reasonable or just.
Upon this subject, Lord Denman in his charge to
the jury, at the Somerset Assizes, in the Spring
Circuit of 1849, made the following observations: ?
? In all cases in which prisoners, charged with
? felony, have witnesses, and those witnesses are in
? attendance at the time of the examination before
? the magistrate, I should recommend that the
? magistrate should hear the evidence of such
? witnesses, as the prisoner, on being asked, wishes
?to be examined in his defence. If such witnesses
? merely explain what has been proved in support
? of the charge, and are believed, they will actually
? have made out a defence on behalf of the accused,
? and there would, of course, be no necessity for
? any further proceedings, but if the witnesses
? so called, contradict those for the prosecution in
? material points , then the case would be properly
? sent to a jury to ascertain the truth of the state-
? merits of each party; and the depositions of the
? prisoner?s witnesses being taken and signed by
? them, should be transmitted to the judge, together
?with the depositions in support of the charge.?
Although no witnesses should be in attendance on
behalf of the accused, yet if he refers to any person


whose evidence might, consistently with his own
explanation, exculpate him from the charge, such
person should, if possible, be sent for and examined.
? If,? to quote again the language of Lord Denman,
? a person, in whose possession property is found,
?give a reasonable account of how he came by it,
?and refer to some known person, as the person
? from wdiom he received it, the magistrate should
? send for that person, and examine him, as it may
? be, that his statement may entirely exonerate the
? accused person, and put an end to the charge;
? and it also very often may be that the person thus
? referred to would become a very important witness
? for the prosecution, by proving, in addition to the
? prisoner?s possession of the stolen property, that
? lie has been giving a false account as to how he
? came by it. I wish, also, to say, that it is always
?very desirable that all that has been given in
? evidence before the magistrate should be. trans-
? mitted to the judge.?
The same accuracy and form should be observed
in taking the evidence of the witnesses examined on
the part of the accused, as that on the part of the
prosecution; for, independently of other consider-
ations, it is enacted by the 16th section of the
Colonial Act, 14, Yict, No. 43, that the depositions
of the witnesses for the accused, may be read in
evidence in his defence, if the witness should happen
to die before the trial.
If a commital be resolved on by the magistrates
it will be their duty to bind over the witnesses to
appear ; that is, such witnesses as had given relevant
and material evidence. ?It certainly,? says Lord
Denman, ? cannot be necessary for a magistrate to
? bind over every ivitness who is examined before
? him in support of a charge of felony, because it
? must often happen that some of the witnesses who
? are examinined before the committing magistrate
? really know nothing of the case, and, on enquiry,
? the whole of what they have to state may be
? hearsay only. The magistrate is only to bind over
? those whose evidence is material to the case.?


The commitment will be as in the form T. 1., No.
TOO ; and it would be advisable that the magistia.e
should for the guidance of the gaoler, direct the
words ? Quarter Sessions,? or ? Supreme Court,
to be inserted in the margin of the commitment.
Where the accused is remanded, the caution re-
quired to be given by the justices, in section 18,
should not be given at the time of the remand,
but should be deferred until u after the examination
of all the witnesses on the part of the prosecution.
Notwithstanding, the warrrant of remand having
been made out for eight days, and the party accused
committed to the gaoler?s custody thereunder, the
justice may, nevertheless, before the expiration of
eight days, order the accused to bo again brought
before him. This is a very convenient provision,
particularly where the presence oi witnesses can be
procured earlier than anticipated. No form of
order is given in the Act in the case; but the fol-
lowing (taken from Oke?s Formulary) will suffice: ?
? To the keeper of the (common gaol) at in the
said (colony) of
, T Whereas, A. 8., of &c., was on the
ictobia | committed (by me) to your
custody in the said (common gaol) charged with

were commanded to have him at on the

before such justice or justices of the peace for the said (Colony)
as might then be there to answer further to the said charge, and
to be further dealt with according to Law, unless you should be
otherwise ordered in the mean time. And, whereas, it appears

some other justice or justices of the peace for tne said (Colony)
as may then be there to answer further to the said charge, and
to be further dealt with according to law unless you shall bo
otherwise ordered in the meantime. Given under my hand and

J. S. (l. s.)
Should the magistrates not commit for trial, on
the ground of the absence of witnesses , they are em-
powered by the 21st section of the Act, in conse-
quence of such absence, u or any other reasonable
cause,? to remand the accused from time to time,
for a period not exceeding eight clear days; an ex-
pression which may either mean several remands,
each not exceeding eight days ; or several remands
not exceeding in the whole eight days. The former
was, probably, intended, and is, perhaps, the true
sense in which it should be read. When the re-
mand is for eight days, it must be by warrant ac-
cording to the form (Q. 1) ; if the remand be only
for three days, it may be by verbal order; but in
either case bail may be taken for the re-appearance
of the prisoner, according to the form (Q. 2), ac-
companied by a notice to the accused and his
sureties according to the form (Q. 3). On the
accused being brought up for further examination
after a remand, the proceedings should be com-
menced by reading over all the examinations and
depositions previously taken.
The powers and duties of the Justices as regards
taking bail are defined by the 23rd section, which
has made a material alteration in the law, as it
previously stood. Formerly, two justices w r ere re-
quired, in cases of felony, to grant bail, and
almost all cases of misdemeanor, they were bound to
grant it. Now, by the section above mentioned, one
justice may grant bail, in cases of felony, and in
certain specified misdemeanors a discretion is given
to the justices whether they will grant it or not.
If they grant bail at once, it will be according to
the form (S. 1), accompanied by the Notice (S. 2).
After committal the committing justice may grant
bail himself, by attending at the prison, and taking
it according to the forms (SS. 1 and 2). Or, he
may enable any other justice to take bail by en-
dorsing on the warrant of commitment the following


certificate (S. 3.) : ?I hereby certify that I con-
sent to the within-named A. B. being bailed by re-
cognizance, himself in and [/wo] sureties
in each. ? J. S.?
Any justice attending the prison may take bail
by virtue of the certificate, but if the sureties should
feel it inconvenient, or be unable to attend at the
gaol, the committing justice may make a duplicate of
the certificate on the w r arrant, on a separate piece of
paper, thus (S. 4): ? Whereas, A.8,, was on the ,
committed by me to the , at ,
charged with Qfc., naming the offence shortly'] : I
hereby certify? &c., as in the previous form (S. 3).
This duplicate being produced before any justice of
peace for the Colony, will enable him to take the
recognizance of the surety or sureties in conformity
with such certificate, and upon such recognizance
being transmitted to the keeper of the gaol to whose
custody the accused has been committed, together
with the certificate above mentioned, any justice of
the peace attending the said gaol, to whom the said
recognizance and certificate may be produced, may
take also the recognizance of the accused party, and
thereupon order him to be discharged out of custody;
for which purpose, however, he must lodge with the
gaoler a warrant of deliverance in the form (S. 5),
as prescribed by the 24th section of the Act. In
all cases, ineeed, this order of deliverance must be
lodged with the gaoler, where the accused is bailed
by a justice after his committal to gaol.
The above section is one to which the justices of
this Colony have hitherto scarcely given sufficient
attention. The numerous applications that have
been made to the Judges of the Supreme Court,
since the adoption of Jervis?s Acts, to admit persons
to bail, are, at all events, a proof that the section
has not been applied to the full extent of its design.
Its object w T as to invest the magistrates with such
powers in regard to bail as would enable them to
act after committal as well as before, and thus pre-
vent the necessity of an application to the Judges
of the Supreme Court; an application always at-


tended with great expense and delay to the accused.
The course pointed out to avoid this, is one of easy
application, and only requires the possession of the
printed forms given by the Act, to be carried into
practice with very little trouble. In felonies and
those offences particularly specified at the com-
mencement of the 23rd section, it is certainly dis-
cretionary with the justices whether they will take
bail or not; but if, after committal, bail be ten-
dered, it should only be refused on such grounds as
would induce a Judge to refuse also; and not merely
because the application could be made to a Judge.
In many cases it is the fault, possibly, of the parties
employed by the accused to procure their discharge,
who, instead of endeavouring to obtain bail from the
justices under the provisions of the section now
under consideration, apply at once to the Supreme
Court for a habeas corpus. Undoubtedly, it might
be inconvenient for the committing magistrate to go
down to the gaol after committal; but this might
be avoided in all cases, which the magistrates might
consider a fit one for bail, by their indorsing on the
warrant of commitment the certificate previously
mentioned, which would enable any other magis-
trate, as before shewn, to take the required bail.
In what cases bail should be taken, and on what
grounds refused, it will now be attempted to be
shewn.
The object of taking bail is simply to secure the
appearance of the accused for the purposes of his
trial; previously to which his confinement is only
tolerated for safe custody, and not in reference to
any probability of his guilt. Neither is he allowed
bail on any presumption of his innocence ; after an
investigation, indeed, which has ended in his com-
mittal for trial, the presumption, in point of fact ,
is rather the other way: but he is allowed bail be-
cause his trial cannot take place immediately.
Upon this subject Judge Coleridge thus expressed
himself in a recent case: ?I. conceive that the
principle on which parties are committed to prison
by magistrates previous to trial, is for the purpose


of ensuring the certainty of their appearing to take
their tried. It seems to me tliat the same principle
is to be adopted on an application for bailing a
person committed to take his trial; and it is not a
question as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.
It is on that account alone? (viz. the probability of
the accused?s appearance to take his trial), ? that it
becomes necessary to see whether the offence is
serious, whether the evidence is strong, and whether
the punishment for the offence is heavy.?
The view here taken is completely borne out by
the principle of the statute of 5 & 6 Will. 5, c. 83,
s. 3, which empowered justices to admit to bail
persons charged with felony, even after they had
confessed their guilt. The matter, therefore, for
the consideration of the magistrates in determining
upon the acceptance of bail, where they have a dis-
cretion, is the likelihood of the appearance of the
accused party to take his trial; and if they have
reason to think that he will not so appear, they will
only exercise a wise discretion in refusing to admit
him to bail.
In those cases where the accused is entitled to
bail, as a matter of right, the justices are bound to
grant it, on being satisfied of the pecuniary suffi-
ciency of the sureties. - A magistrate cannot, in such
cases, to use the language of Lord Denman, ? law- Regina f.
fully reject bail at his own discretion, nor is he at
liberty, wdien bail is offered, to enter into andnvestiga-
tion as to the character or opinion of such bail,
provided he is satisfied of their sufficiency to answer
for the appearance of the party, in the amount
reasonably required for that purpose.? The same
principle was upheld in a very recent case before
Mr. Baron Martin, in which the learned Baron Reginas,
held that it was no objection to the persons proposed T?Rep%oi,
as bail, in a criminal case, that they were indemnified 18 - p- I9>
by or on behalf of the prisoner.
The following are among the indictable misde-
meanours as to which magistrates are hound to take
bail, if sufficient sureties be offered; -


Abduction of an unmarried girl under sixteen
years.
Affray, &c., where two or more arc fighting in
some public place to the terror of the people.
Embezzlement by Agents or parties entrusted
with goods or merchandise for sale, &c., under 7 & 8
Geo. 4, c. 29, ss. 49-51.
Training to the the use of Arms.
Common Assault or Battery.
Attempt to commit a Misdemeanour, whether
statutable or at common law.
Publishing Blasphemous Libels.
Bribery.
Carnally Knowing girls above the age of ten
and under the age of twelve.
Promoting to Fight or sending a challenge.
Uttering Counterfeit Coin, or having poses-
sion of it with intent to utter.
Conspiracy.
Refusal to Assist Constable when called
upon.
Keeping Disorderly House.
Giving False to returning officers at
elections, or personating voters.
Forcible Entry into a freehold or leasehold.
Rescuing Prisoner from custody when not
convicted, or convicted only of a misdemeanour.


Rescuing Goods in the custody of the law, or
breaking open a pound.
Extortion by any officer, by colour of his
office.
Forgery at Common Law, not provided for by
Statute.
Printing or Publishing Obscene Writings
or prints.
Larceny of Deeds, Wills or Codicils, Records,
or fraudulently or wilfully destroying or obliterating
the same.
Libels.
Nuisances by obstructing highways, keeping a
fierce dog loose, &c., &c.
The above list includes nearly all kinds of indict-
able misdemeanours which are likely to occur in this
colony, as to which the magistrate is compelled to
take bail. Those in which, as well as in felony, he
is at liberty to exercise a discretion, are enumerated
in the 23rd section, and need not be here repeated.
The summary of the section, as given in Oke?s
Synopsis, may be thus briefly stated :
1. That it is discretionary with the examining
magistrate whether to admit to bail before com-
mittal in felonies, or an attempt to commit a
felony, and on the first specified misdemeanours;
and also discretionary whether ho shall certify
in them his consent to bail being taken by
another after committal.
2. That in other misdemeanours than those speci-
fied, he must take bail, if tendered before com-
mittal ; and, if committed, he must certify his
consent thereto ; in which latter case a visiting
justice may take the recognizances, but evidently


3. That the examining magistrate after committal
may take bail for any offence, either at the
gaol, or the sureties for the accused elsewhere.


PART 111.
A few points remain to be touched upon not ad-
verted to in Parts I. & 11. Some forms have already
been suggested which are not in Jervis? Act; and
there are others not be found there, which in con-
nexion with the proceedings already treated of, it
will be, nevertheless, expedient, if not necessary, to
adopt. Thus, whenever any document is produced
in evidence, a memorandum to the following effect
should be endorsed thereon.
This is the plan {or as the case may be) produced to me the
undersigned {one) of Her Majesty's justices of the peace for the
{Colony) of Victoria, on the examination of A. 8,, charged with
{larceny) , and referred to in the examination of C. D., touching
the said charge, this day of 1852.
Signature of justice. J. S.
Where the accused does not make any statement,
declining, as he sometimes does, by the advice of his
attorney, to do so, or replying of his own accord,
that he has nothing to say, the following memo-
randum should be made and signed by the justice,
the entry being written after the jurat to the de-
positions :
The above named accused A. 8., after having been duly cau-
tioned, declines (under the advice of his attorney) to make any
statement {or says he has nothing to say).
Signature of justice. J. S.
Where the accused is committed for trial after he
has been brought up on remand, the warrant of
commitment should run thus:?


To the keeper of &c. [or constable].
Whereas A. B. was this day brought up by you, the keeper of
&c. [or constable], and further charged before me J. S., one of
Her Majesty?s justices &c. for that [Jfc. stating shortly the offence ],
and by me now here ordered to bo committed for trial: These
are, therefore, to command you the said keeper [or constable] to
take back the said A. B. to the said [house of correction, or
gaol], and there safely keep him in your custody until he shall
be thence delivered by due course of law. Given under my
hand and seal this day of , in the year
of our Lord at in the Colony aforesaid.
Seal and signature . J. S.
No form is given in which dying declarations arc
to he taken by the Justice; nor is any particular
form necessary; the following one will suffice :
I, C. D., of in the do hereby solemnly
and sincerely declare that [here set out the statement in the very
words used]. Taken before me at . J. S., one of
Her Majesty?s justices of the peace for the said Colony of Vic-
toria.
This declaration should not be taken on oath,
for it acquires its efficacy as evidence from the
situation of the party, and not from any extrinsic
sanction required by law. It will not, however, be
admissible in evidence unless it appears: Ist. That
the cause of the death of the declarant is the sub-
ject of inquiry against the prisoner; 2nd. That the
circumstances of the death are the subject of the
declaration; 3rd. That the declaration was made at
a time when the declarant was perfectly aware of
his danger, and entertained no hope of recovery.
The form of a search warrant, which may be
granted by any one justice upon an information on
oath, and may be executed on a Sunday, according
to the 4th section of the Act, may be as follows:
To the [constable, &c.]
v n Whereas &c. [recite the information as given in the
V idOrvlA f
to wit. J f orm > and then thus :] These are/ therefore, to
command you in Her Majesty?s name, forthwith,
with necessary and proper assistance, to enter in the day time


into the said dwelling-house and premises ( or as the case may be)
of the said A. 8,, and there diligently to search for the said
goods ; and if the same, or any part thereof, shall be found upon
such search, that you bring the goods so found, and also the
body of the said A. 8., before me, or some other of the justices
of the peace in and for the ( Colony) aforesaid, to be disposed of
and dealt with according to law.
Given under [my] hand and seal this day of
in the year of our Lord , at , in the
(Colony) aforesaid.
Seal and signature of justice. J. S.
The information on which to ground the above
warrant will be in the same manner as in the form
(A), until the words u who saith and should con-
tinue thus: ?
That the following goods of (him) the said C. 1)., to wit (de-
scribe them), were on the day of , instant (or
within days last past), by some person or persons un-
known, feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away from and out
of the dwelling-house (or as the case may be) of the said C.D.,
situate at ,in the parish of ,in the
( Colony) aforesaid: And that he, this informant, hath probable
cause to suspect, and doth suspect, that the said goods, or part
thereof, are concealed in the dwelling-house or premises (or as
the case may be) in the occupation of A. 8., situate at ,
in the parish of , in the ( Colony) of
Sworn before, &c. J. S.
By the 27th section, parties committed for trial,
or bailed, are entitled, after all the examinations have
been completed , to copies of the depositions, on pay-
ment of the fee fixed, from the officer or person
having the custody of the same. If the accused, Ex parte
however, has been discharged by the magistrate, or,
if, instead of being committed for trial, he has been * l -y
committed to gaol until he should give sufficient m. &p. 323.
sureties for keeping the peace, and for appearing at
the sessions or assizes to do what would be then
enjoined by the Courts, he would not be entitled to
copies.
It remains only to call attention to the 16 th and
20th sections of the act under consideration to ac-
complish the object in view of this portion of the


work, viz. an exposition of the duties of justices under
the 11 & 12 Yict. c. 42., in matters of most or-
dinary occurrence, or of chief importance.
By sect. 16, a summons, in the form (L. 1), may
be issued by any one justice, on an oath being made
that the person within the justice?s jurisdiction is
likely to give material evidence for the 'prosecution.
Service may be personal or at the party?s abode ; if
summons disobeyed, a warrant may be issued on
proof of service according to the form (L. 2); or if
a justice is satisfied by oath that the witness will
not attend without being compelled, a warrant in
the first instance may be granted. On the appear-
ance of the witness, and his refusal to be examined
or to answer questions, he may be committed to
prison for a period not exceeding seven days. By
the 20th section the justice taking the examinations
is to bind over the witnesses to appear and give
evidence at the trial by recognizance according to
form (0. 1), which must specify the trade, residence,
&c., of the persons bound. Notice is at the same
to be given to the party bound in the form (0. 2).
Witnesses refusing to enter into the same, may be
committed until after the trial of accused by warrant
in form (P. 1), unless recognizance sooner acknow-
ledged. If accused not committed or held to bail
for the offence, any justice may discharge the wit-
ness from gaol by an order according to form (P. 2).
The above sections are so plain and particular in
their enactments, as to render it unnecessary to
make any further analysis of their contents than
what has been just given. With the help of the
forms to which they refer, the justices can hardly
go astray in acting under their respective provisions.


PART IV.
In the preceding parts have been considered and
explained, so far as was consistent with the design
of the writer, the duties of magistrates in the exercise
of their ministerial functions under the Ist of Jervis?
Acts, 11 &12 Yict., c. 42. A similar course will
now be attempted in regard to the 11 & 12 Viet,
c. 43., intituled u An Act to facilitate the perform-
ance of the duties of Justices of the Peace out of Ses-
sions within England and Wales, with respect to
Summary Convictions and Orders.?* These duties
it is the professed object of the Statute to ? define
clearly hy positive enactment ,? and accordingly, its
provisions have, for the most part, been framed with
a minuteness and particularity that will only require
attention in the perusal to be fully understood. At-
tention, however, is necessary; and the writer takes
the liberty of suggesting to all justices a very care-
ful study of the Act itself, so as to be able to form
a distinct and accurate notion of what is required
of them, before they attempt to exercise their
functions under it; however much they might be
assisted in doing so by a treatise or commentary of
the present description, Such works are most useful
as auxiliaries ; but they should never be accepted as
substitutes for the original source of the justice?s
jurisdiction and powers. The magistrate who re-
gards them only in the former light, may safely
* It is to be regretted that the introducer of Jervis's Acts
did not do so by express enactment instead of by adopting them
in totidem verbis.. Some of the provisions, as well as the very
titles of the respective acts, are utterly inapplicable to Colonial
circumstances. It is matter of congratulation that the Legisla-
ture of Victoria has avoided this error, and has hitherto adopted
no British Statute, without also adapting its phraseology and
provisions to the circumstances of the Colony.

avail himself of their aid ; but if he regards them
in the latter, his knowledge will always be super-
ficial, and he will be without that confidence in his
proceedings which he would otherwise be enabled to
acquire.
The first three sections of the Act now under con-
sideration, relate to the issuing of summonses and
warrants; the information or complaint upon which
they are to issue; and the mode of their service and
execution. The distinction between an information
and a complaint is thus stated by Mr. Oke:??An
? information is the groundwork of a charge for an
? offence or act punishable summarily, either by fine
?or imprisonment; a complaint being an application
? on the non-payment of money, or for the doing of
? some other thing, subjecting the party in either
? ease to imprisonment in default; an information
?is technically said to be laid , a complaint to be
? made ; a conviction is the affirmative result of an
? information ; an order that of a complaint.?
Informations will be first treated of; and it is
recommended that these be always taken in writing,
as the statute evidently contemplates, although it
does not expressly require, that they should be. Some
offences must , by the particular statute, be charged
in writing. The information need not be on oath
if a summons only is issued in the first instance,
unless some particular act require otherwise; but if
a warrant be issued in the first instance (as it may
be by the 2nd section) it must be preceded by an
information taken on oath, which oath may be ad-
ministered in these words :
You, C.D., do swear that the contents of this your informa-
tion signed by yon, a - e true and correct to the best of your know-
ledge and belief, so help you God.?
No forms of information are given by the Act,
but among its chief features, may be mentioned, ?
Ist, the name of the informant ; 2nd, the date of
performing it; 3rd, the place of preferring it; 4th,
the name and style of the justice; sth, the offender?s


name; 6th, the nature of the offence ; 7th, the time
and place where the offence was committed.
The particularity with which the above ingre-
dients should be stated may be illustrated by a sup-
posed case under the Malicious Injuries? Act, 7 & 8
Geo. 4, c. 30. The 24th section of this Act, makes
penal the wilful or malicious commission of any
damage, injury, or spoil, to or upon any real or per-
sonal property whatsoever, either of a public or
private nature, for which no remedy or punishment
is by the same Act provided. Let it be supposed
that A. B. has wantonly or maliciously broken the
windows of a building belonging to C. I). The in-
formation of the latter should be thus stated: ?
ViCTORI V 1 The information of C - D., Of ,in the Information
TO WIT. j colony of Victoria, labourer, taken upon oath before
me, the undersigned, one of Her Majesty?s justices of l u �' s G Ac /?
the peace in and for the said colony of Victoria, at , c. so. s. A
in the same colony, this first day of June , A. D. 1852, who saith
that A. B. of in the said colony of Victoria, labourer,
within the space of three calendar months last past, to wit, on the
sixth day of April last, at , in the colony aforesaid,
did wilfully [or (maliciously) either will do] commit damage,
injury, and spoil, to, and upon, a certain window, the property
of the said C. D., the said informant, then and there being, by
then and there breaking two panes of glass therein, and the
wood (or leadwork) thereof,' and thereby doing injury to the said
C. D., to the amount of five shillings, contrary to the form of the
statute in such case made and provided.
Taken and sworn before me the day and year first above
written. J. S.
The above information is required to be on oath
by the Statute, and to be laid within three calendar
months from the time of the offence. It is also
requisite that some actual damage, however small in Butler
amount, should be alleged. &m3!si? 0
As to the time, the exact day is not material in
any case, provided it be within the time prescribed
by the statute. Some Acts require that the con ~


viction should take place within three calendar months
from the time of the commission of the offence.
Where this is the case, although the conviction be
delayed beyond the prescribed time, in consequence
of an adjournment at the request of the defendant,
it will be, nevertheless, held invalid. Where no
time is prescribed for laying an information or com-
plaint, the 11th section of Jervis? Act provides that
in all cases, ? such complaint shall be made, and
such information shall be laid within six calendar
months from the time when the matter of such com-
plaint or information respectively arose.?
The importance of stating the place where the
offence was committed is obvious ; for, otherwise, it
would not appear whether the magistrate had any
cognizance over it. It is within the writer?s know-
ledge, however, that more than one conviction in this
colony has held invalid in consequence of this
omission. It should be borne in mind, too, that the
mere mention of the colony in the margin will not
supply the absence of an allegation as to place ; for
such mention is only to indicate where the convic-
tion is made; not where the offence was perpetrated.
If the place has been once named, however, in the
body of the conviction, or information, it may be
referred to by saying ? in the colony aforesaid.' I'? 1 '?
The most material part to be considered, perhaps,
in convictions, and informations, is the statement of
the offence. Nothing, at first sight, seems so easy
and plain a matter; whereas it often times turns
out to be a very difficult one. In many cases,
indeed, the skill of a special pleader would not be
unworthily employed in filling up that apparently
simple blank supplied by the words, ? here state the
offence .? Even where a clause directs that the
offence, if described in the words of the Act, shall
be held sufficient, those words cannot be always
safely followed. In consequence of defects, in this
respect, the Supreme Court of this colony has fre-
quently had to discharge defendants on Habeas
Corpus. It is of great importance, therefore, that
magistrates should be particularly careful in seeing


that any conviction or information to which they
append their signature, contains a legal defini-
tion of the offence charged. No doubt, they must
frequently depend on the clerk of the Bench, or the
attorney employed by the prosecutor, in this and
other matters where their summary jurisdiction is
invoked; but as, in some cases, they may become
personally responsible for the results of an error,
they will do well to render themselves, as far as
their time and abilities will allow, independent of
the judgment or dictation of either official or profes-
sional agency.
Upon this subject may be mentioned the case of a
magistrate who was found guilty of a misdemeanour,
for having committed a person under the Vagrant
Act, without having examined the witnesses on oath,
or seen the accused, before the committment was
signed. In a more recent case the magistrate went
with his clerk to the complainant?s residence to take
an information, but signed it without seeing the in-
formant, the deposition being taken and the oath
administered by his clerk. In reference to this pro-
ceeding, the judges of the Court of Queen?s Bench
expressed strong disapprobation, and held that such
irregularity deprived the magistrate of any statutable
protection in an action against him for false im-
prisonment. ? A magistrate,? said Patteson,J .,
? ought to examine the witness himself: he ought
? not to commit this part of his duty to his clerk.?
? I am glad,? said Coleridge J., ? to have an oppor-
? tunity of stating my opinion on this point, because
? it is a common practice to take depositions in a
u manner like that which was here described. The
? taking of affidavits in this Court is quite different;
? the act is purely ministerial; the party says what
? he pleases, and the effect of it comes to be considered
?by the Court afterwards. But a magistrate taking
u depositions has a discretion to exercise: he is to
? examine the witness, hear his answers, and judge of
u the manner in which they are given. If he does
? not, how is he in a condition, supposing the charge
u were felony, to decide whether or not bail shall be
? taken.?


To revert to the requisites of informations, and
convictions; it is not easy to furnish an unerring
guide to any particular case; but the following
passage from Paley , will suffice to give some general
idea of what they should contain :
? The general qualities of a conviction in substance
? are, first, that it be full and correct: and,
? secondly, as the whole jurisdiction in summary
u proceedings is founded upon, and solely derived
u from, special Acts of Parliament, it is fundamen-
? tally required, in a conviction for any offence, that
? the directions of the particular statute relative to
? that offence, should appecr upon the face of it to
? have been substantially complied with : both as to
? what regards the subject-matter of the offence
? being clearly brought within the meaning of the
? Act, and also the method of proceeding, and final
? judgment. And if the charge falls short of the
? necessary legal description of the offence, the
? omission is not cured by any allegations of its
? being done unlawfully , or fraudulently , or the like;
? or by stating that it was against the form of the
? statute ; for the allegation is no more than a legal
? inference, which must be supported by the
? premises.?
To the above may be added that uncertainty and
ambiguity (such as stating an offence in the alterna-
tive), must be avoided. The writer, however, feels
that, after all, experience and attention can alone
determine the true application of general rules.
Perhaps, by selecting such offences as are most fre-
quently the subject of summary adjudication in this
colony, and showing, definitely how, in regard to
actual facts, such offences should be described, the
magistrates will .not only have at hand a guide in
regard to those particular offences, but will acquire
something like an insight into the mode in which
they should be stated in others. This, then, will be
found attempted in an Appendix at the end of the
Manual, as it would break too much the continuity
of the part now in progress, to interpose it here.


By the 29th section of the Act under considera
ation, one justice may, in all cases, receive an in-
formation, and grant a warrant or summons, hut the
conviction must be before one or two, according to
the particular act by which the offence is created.
In the case supposed in the information above given,
one justice alone may convict. The offence therein
stated has been alleged as committed by one person
only ; but the information might have included also
any person who was aiding and abetting A. B. in
breaking the windows of C. D. The sth section of
the Act (in speaking of the Act, now under consi-
deration, is always intended, Jervis?, viz., 11 & 12
Viet., c. 43,) has introduced in the words of Mr.
Saunders : ?? a novelty into the summary jurisdic-
? tion of justice, and creates for their adjudication a
? large body of offences not heretofore cognizant by
? any tribunal. By this enactment, every person
? who shall aid, abet, counsel, or procure the com-
? mission of any offence punishable on summary
? conviction, may thereby subject himself to the
? same punishment; thus a man who is a party to
? the drunkenness of another, may be convicted as
?an aider; so by encouraging another to profane
? swearing, and in all the other cases, great and
? small, in which a justice can summarily convict.?
If, therefore, a second person, who shall for this
purpose be called E. F. was assisting or aiding
A. B. in breaking the windows in the case supposed,
as, for instance, handing him up stones to throw,
or watching that no one approached, he might have
been included in the same information; and would
be chargeable with the same offence, or that laid
against A. B. A few words would suffice for that
purpose, by adding after the conclusion of the
offence laid against A. B. the following sentence ;
And that E. F. of &c., was then and there present wilfully
aiding and abetting the said A. B. to do and commit the said
offence, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made
and provided.
When the information has been laid, the justice


may, under the Ist and 2nd section, grant either a
summons, and on disobedience to such summons, a
warrant; or, he may, in the first instance, if he
think fit, issue a warrant. In either case, however,
the information must be substantiated on oath,
previous to the issue of a warrant. In the case
supposed, under the Malicious Injuries? Act, the
statute having required the information to be on
oath, no such substantiation would be necessary;
but in cases where the information has been received
without oath, no warrant can legally issue, either
in the first instance, or after service of summons,
until the information has been verified by oath.
This can be done, where a warrant is, in the first
instance intended to be granted, by a memorandum
in the following terms, at the foot, or on the back
of the information :
The matter of the above (or, if endorsed on the back the
within) information is now substantiated before me the said
justice by oath of the above named (or within named) C. D. (or,
as the offence, by sect. 10, need not be sworn to by the informant
himself) L. M., of , in the said colony of

The warrant, where issued in the first instance,
will be in the form (B) given by the Act, and when


issued, on tlie disobedience of a summons, in the form
(C.) As to the summonses to witnesses, and other
matters not treated of in this part, the magistrates
are referred to the Act itself, and the accompanying
forms.
With reference to complaints, as distinguished
from informations, the following observations from
Oke?s Magisterial Synopsis will be sufficient, after
what has been said respecting informations : ? By
? a complaint is meant a complaint upon which a
?justice is or shall be authorized by law'to make
? any order for the payment of money, or otherwise,
? (ss. 1, 8, & 10,) and these words, ( or otherwise ,?
u seem to apply to cases where the order is for the
? doing of some other act than of paying of money,
u the disobedience of which imprisonment follows,
? (see sec. 24),
? What has before been said in regard to informa-
? tions, as to the time of making the complaint,?
? by whom to be made, ?when to be on oath, ?
? will equally apply to the complaints except, as no
? warrant in the first instance can be granted on a
? complaint, that part as to the oath will be inap-
? plicablo.
? Section Bth expressly enacts, that it shall not
?be necessary that such complaint shall be in
? writing, unless it shall be required to be so by
? some particular Act of Parliament upon which
? such complaint shall be framed; but, nevertheless,
? it would be advisable to have every complaint in
? writing.
? The same particularity as to facts is required as
? on an information in writing, and it must contain
? one matter of complaint only (s. 10.)
? It will be observed by the first section, that no
? objection shall be taken or allowed for any alleged
? defect in the complaint in substance or in form, or
? for any variance between it and the evidence; but


? as a complaint is recited verbatim in the order
? and subsequent proceedings, it is unlike an in-
? formation, and as it cannot be amended, it re-
? quires more particularity in its preparation than
?an information now does. Section 9 does not
? apply to complaints.?


PART V.
The mode of Hearing is prescribed by the 12th
and following sections. It may always take place
before one justice, except where otherwise directed
by statute or Act of Council. The place of hearing
is to be deemed an open and public Court, and both
the complainant and the party informed against, are
entitled to the assistance of counsel or attorney, if
they think fit to employ them.
On the day appointed for hearing, if the com-
plainant only, or the defendant only, appears, the
Act gives a power in either case, (sec. 13 & 16) to
the justices to adjourn, and in the mean time,
according to their own discretion, either to commit
the defendant to gaol, or take his own recognizance,
or that of sureties for his reappearance. A similar
power is given to the justices, either before or during
the hearing. ? Before the hearing,? says Mr Oke,
? would apply to cases where a defendant is appro-
? hended before the usual day of Petty Sessions, and
? the witnesses are not therefore in attendance, or
? when two justices are necessary to adjudicate, and
? only one is present at the time and place appointed
?by the summons, &c., for the hearing. During
? the hearing would apply to cases where the hearing
? has taken place, or partly taken place, and a
? material witness is absent, and the justices wish
? to adjourn to obtain his attendance, or to take
? time to consider their judgment, and also where
? variances have misled the defendant.?
Instead, however, of adjourning, if the defendant
only appears, the justices may, if they please, (sec.


13) dismiss the information, and if the complainant
only appears, they may proceed, exparte, to hear the
case in the absence of the defendant, or adjourn the
hearing until he shall have been apprehended by
warrant. ?If both parties appear, either personally
? or by their respective counsel or attorneys, before
? the justice or justices who are to hear and deter-
? mine such complaint or information; then the said
? justice or justices shall proceed to hear and determine
? the same. But this part of the 13 th section must
be read in connection with the first part of the 16th,
which, as has been already stated, enables the
justices to adjourn ?in their discretion,? either
? before or during the hearing.? It must not be
understood, therefore, as imperative on the justices
to determine the matter forthwith, although both
parties should appear and go into the case.
An adjournment on the ground of variance be-
tween the information and the evidence adduced in
support thereof, is expressly provided for by the 9th
section, which gives the justices power, in such case
to secure the reappearance of the defendant either
by committal, bail or personal recognizance. Should
the defendant, however, attend, as he is at liberty
to do, under the 13 Vic., by counsel or attorney,
the 9th section, strange to say, has omitted to make
any provision for his appearance on the day to which
the case may be adjourned. As to the particular
variances, time and place arc declared to be imma-
terial, provided the offence charged appear to have
been committed within the jurisdiction of the justice,
and the information thereof laid within the time
limited by law. The section then proceeds to state
that ? if any such variance, or any variance in any
other respect ? shall appear, the justice or justices
may, if he, or they, think the defendant has been
misled, or deceived thereby, adjourn the hearing of
the case to some future day, upon such terms as he
or they shall think jit.
? The result of the above enactment,? says Mr.
Oke, ? seems to be to entirely supersede the use of
? the information, summons, or warrant, as substan-


? tial parts of the proceedings, beyond the fact of
? their being required by way of authority for the
?justice?s interference; but that the conviction en-
? tirely depends upon the case proved by the evi-
? deuce, which neither recites nor even alludes to
? the information, summons, or warrant, as in the
? repealed form given by the 3 Geo. 4. c. 23.
u Although the strictness, which was formerly
? required in informations, will no longer bo
? necessary, they must not, however, be so drawn as
? to deceive or mislead the defendant, by varying
? from the charge in the evidence, and so varying
? the nature of the case altogether; for in that case
? the justice being empowered to adjourn the hearing
u of the case to some future day, upon such terms as
?he shall think fit , seems to be enabled to enforce
? upon parties preferring charges the necessity of
? drawing their informations in a legal form. The
? cases and rules, therefore, which were decided upon
u informations and convictions before the passing of
? the 11 & 12 Vic., c. 43, may still be found
? serviceable as a guide in framing them at the
u present time, and will be also serviceable in drawing
? convictions , as the above provisions only apply
? to the information or complaint, summons and
? warrant, more particularly as to the mode of
? describing the offence or matter of complaint,
? which, if correctly stated in the information or
? complaint, to ground the justice?s jurisdiction, and
u thence recited or stated in the conviction and suhse-
? quent proceedings , would save much trouble and
? inconvenience in the preparation of the latter.?
Magistrates will do well to attend to the above
suggestions, as in many cases the recital of the con-
viction in the warrant of commitment, is, in point of
fact, the recital of the information; and if that
should be defective, the commitment will, probably,
be defective also; whereas a good conviction will be
presumed, though none be actually drawn up, if a
sufficient recital appear on the face of the warrant,
which can hardly fail to be the case where the in-
formation has been properly framed.


In case of adjournment in any of the instances
before mentioned, no time is limited; but the justice
must take care that he do not, for the purpose of
adjournment commit to prison for an unreasonable
time. His safe course will be, in cases of adjourn-
ment, either at his own instance or that of the com-
plainant, to take bail, and where the latter has not
shaped his information properly, to discharge the
defendant upon his own recognizance. Even where
the defendant himself should ask an adjournment
it must be a very serious case which would justify
his committal to prison, especially where he has
voluntarily appeared, and when it is taken into
consideration also, that he might not have appeared
at all, if he had chosen to do so, by counsel or
attorney.
Before considering the mode of proceeding when
both parties appear, it shall be assumed that the
defendant only, or his attorney has appeared, and
that the Justice determines, instead of adjourning
the hearing, to dismiss the charge. This he may
do ?if the complainant or informant having had
? such notice as aforesaid , do not appear by himself,
? his counsel or attorney.? The ? notice ? re-
ferred to is where the defendant has previously
been apprehended, and the hearing been adjourned,
in which case notice of the adjournment is required
by the Act to be given to the informant. The first
thing, therefore, in such a case would be proof of
this notice; and the proof would depend on the
manner in which the notice was served. The Act
makes no provision in this respect; but it is pre-
sumed the notice ought to be given by the clerk to
the Justices. Assuming it to have been served as
well as given by him, he would of course be the
party to prove the fact. The following form is
given as that in which the notice should be framed:
Court of Petty Sessions for
day of , 185 , .
, 185 , at
1 beg to give you notice that A. 8., against whom a warrant
was issued on your information has been apprehended and brought


this day at the place above named, and ordered by a justice to
be brought up at the same place on ? next, at 12 o?clock
at noon, on the hearing of the said information, when and
where you are required to attend.
Yours, &c.,
W. 8., Clerk to the Justices.
To Mr. C. D., of
Printed forms, being supposed ahvays'ready, of all
memoranda in use, a duplicate of tbe above notice
can be quickly filled up, and tbe clerk having ex-
amined it with the original, should indorse on the
duplicate, at the time of his serving the former, an
entry to that effect, stating the day and time of
service. He should then deposit it among the files
of the Court, and it will be ready for use when
wanted. The service by the clerk, probably, can
only take place when the complainant or his at-
torney attends?for service on the latter would be
sufficient but the notice should still be given in
the name of the clerk. If the complainant or his Requisites to
attorney does not attend, and the Justices, never-
theless, see fit to adjourn, and for that purpose to ad j� urnment
issue a warrant for the apprehension of the defend-
ant, the service of notice to the complainant of the
day named for the adjournment, can be effected by
a constable, in which case the clerk should explain
to him the contents, if he cannot write, and make
an entry accordingly on the duplicate retained. If
he can write, let him make an indorsement of ser-
vice on the duplicate. And, in such case, the con-
stable or party serving the notice should be in-
structed to be in attendance on the day appointed for
the adjourned hearing; otherwise, should the com-
plainant not attend, the notice to him of adjourn-
ment could not be proved, and consequently the
Justices could not dismiss the charge. These may
appear minutiae, but they are just those little things
in which police-office details are often wanting, and
the neglect of which frequently creates confusion,
irregularity, and sometimes a failure of justice.
In dismissing the charge, on non-attendance of costs where
complainant at the hearing, the justices may, if they misled in?"


please, under the 18th section, give costs ; and they
are expressly authorised to give them, under the
16th, in cases of non-appearance of complainant,
after adjournment. The provision, however, was
unnecessary in the 16th, and has been properly
omitted in the 13th section, the terms of the 18th
applying to all cases of dismissal of information,
whether on the merits or for want of appearance
of parties, either in the first instance, or after the
case has been adjourned. The Act, indeed, in many
respects, is amendable both in structure and expres-
sion; the different clauses following each other in no
orderly connexion, and exhibiting occasionally, an
incoherence and inconsistency quite sufficient to
perplex magistrates of far greater legal knowledge
than the gentlemen in the commission of peace, in
this colony, can be expected to possess.
The form of the order of dismissal will be as
given under the letter [L.] ; but under sec. 14, it
is discretionary with the justices, in all cases, whether
they will make the order or not; and, in any event,
they need not make it unless required to do so.
Probably, if required to do so, they would refuse,
and generally should, when the information is dis-
missed, in the first instance, on the ground of com-
plainant?s non-attendance ; inasmuch as the making
of the order would enable the defendant to obtain a
certificate thereof [M], and set it up as a bar
against any future proceedings. There might be
circumstances, however, which would induce the
justices to give the defendant costs against the
complainant for not appearing, in which case an
order would be necessary, and the consequent cer-
tificate operating as a bar, could not be avoided.
If the information be dismissed without any order
being made at the request of the defendant, then, as
it is not upon the merits, u is seems,? says Mr Oke,
?to be in the nature of a nonsuit in a civil cause,
u anc \ fte complaint or information may be brought
? again.
If the complainant only should appear, and the
justices determine instead of issuing a warrant, to


proceed, in the absence of the defendant, they must
first be satisfied ly the oath of the constable, that
the summons has been served on the defendant,
and if personal service of it has not been effected,
they should require proof that it has come to his
knowledge in reasonable time before the day of
hearing. If they entertain any doubt upon this
point, it will be prudent to adjourn, giving defendant
notice thereof, or to issue a fresh summons; but if
they are satisfied on this head, they may at once
proceed to deal with the charge. To make sure
that the defendant is not in attendance, the constable
should be directed to call out his name at the door
of the room where the court is held, three several
times, and if he should not answer, the constable or
other person who served the summons, may then
have the following oath administered to him by the
clerk:?
? You , A. 8 ., shall mahe true answers to all such
u questions as shall he demanded of you , touching
u this case. So help you Sod .?
The result of this examination should be taken
down in writing, and signed by the deponent
as well as the justices, and it should not only be
ascertained that service has been effected, but also
that such service has been in accordance with the
terms prescribed by the statute under which the
information is laid, if it should contain any specific
directions on that point.
It has been already stated before whom, and
when the hearing must take place.
The mode of hearing, when both parties appear,
is pointed out in the 14th section, with great par-
ticularity ; but before dealing with the matter
judicially, the justices may, with great propriety, in
many cases, endeavour to bring about a compromise
between the complainant and defendant. Indeed,
in summary convictions, under the Larceny and
Malicious Injuries? Acts, (7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 29, s.


68; c. 30, s. 85,) the justices are empowered to
arrange a compromise even after a conviction.
It may be stated here, that the appearance of the
defendant, whether by himself or attorney, not only
operates as a waiver of any irregularity in the service
of the summons ; but if there has been no summons
at all, such appearance cures that defect. The
evidence given at the hearing should be taken with
the same strictness and regularity as observed in the
Supreme Courts. There is nothing in Jervis? Act
to render it imperative to take down the evidence in
writing; but it is a course which every justice should
adopt, for two reasons ; ?lst, for his own protection;
and, 2ndly, in fairness to the defendant; for,
although it is not necessary to set out the evidence
in the conviction, the Colonial Act 10th Yict, No.
43, contains certain provisions, both in favor of
justices, and parties convicted before them, which
might be rendered totally ineffectual by the want of
written evidence. By the 9th section of that Act,
any defect in a commitment may be cured, so as to
prevent the discharge of a defendant on habeas corpus ,
if ? the depositions? shall appear to the court to
warrant, in substance, the judgment of the justices;
and by the 15th section of the same Act, in every
case of summary conviction, ? all parties indicted
? therein shall be entitled to demand and have copies
u of the information and depositions, &c., in like
11 manner, and on the same terms, as they are pro-
? vided with regard to depositions against a party
? committed or holden to bail.? Now, whether or
not these enactments amount to an express declara-
tion that depositions in summary convictions shall
be taken in writing (as to which, for obvious reasons,
the author of these pages offers no opinion,) there
can be no doubt that they contain an implied in-
junction to that effect, and still less doubt that the
practice enjoined ought to be invariably followed.
It were to be wished, perhaps, that upon this point
the Colonial Act had been somewhat more explicit ;
for a subsequent part, however, is reserved a further
consideration of its very important and useful pro-
visions.


Before the passing of Jervis? Act, doubts had
existed whether an informer was a competent wit-
ness, but the 15th section of the Summary
Jurisdiction Act has been supposed to put that
doubt at rest, and to establish that he is not now
competent unless made so by the particular statute
under which he lays the charge. In reference to
this section, Mr. Oke makes the following remarks:?
? The word prosecutor evidently means a common
< 1 informer, suing for a penalty for some olfence in
? which case he is incompetent to act as a witness;
? but it is submitted that it does not render a com-
? plainant or a party aggrieved by some offence (such
? as damage to crops, &c.,) incompetent, notwith-
? standing his pecuniary intererest, where the
u amount owing or damage done is payable to him;
u the Larceny and Malicious Injuries? Act (7 & 8
? Geo. 4. cc. 29, 30) take the amount of property
u stolen or damage done away from the complainant
? where he is examined; and the penalty is always
? payable to the overseer ; (see Arch., 2nd edit., p.
u 145, and 12 J. P., 670 ;) but it has been con-
a tended that where he is not entitled as of right to
a any portion of the penalty, and therefore has
?not such a ?pecuniary interest in the result,?
?as is contemplated by the section (see Smith v.
? Prager, 7 T. R., 62 ; Doe v. Tylor , 6 Bing., 394),
? his evidence is admissible (13 J. P., 818 ; 14,
?J. P., 375). It is doubtful whether he can
? release his interest in the penalty, absolutely pay-
? able to him on conviction, so as to render his evi-
? dence admissible, because the doctrine of release
? appears to apply to those cases only where it is in
? the witness?s own power to denude himself of an
? interest already existing, and not as to the case of
? an information depending upon whether the justices
?door do not convict (13 J. P., 643), Where he
? gives evidence, that will not justify the justices in
? dismissing the information, if it be sufficiently
? supported by other evidence (13 J. P. 625,643).??
The oath should be, as in criminal cases, ad-
ministered to the witness before he gives his evidence
and may bo in the following form :


? The evidence which you shall give touching this
? information (or complaint) shall be the truth, the
? whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
? you God.?
After the evidence on both sides has been closed,
the justices will either convict the defendant or
dismiss the charge; and in either case the clerk
should make an entry thereof on the minutes of the
proceedings. These proceedings, it is recommended,
in summary convictions, should be recorded in a
book kept for that purpose, and that the evidence
of the witnesses when given should be entered therein,
so that the grounds of each decision, as well as the
decision itself, together with all the proceedings
relating thereto might be traced at once and readily
and conveniently referred to: A form of entry is
given post.
It has already been stated that if the justices
dismiss the complaint, they may do so either with or
without costs; but they cannot, if they dismiss the
case, order costs to be paid to the complainant. The
order of dismissal, if made, must be followed by a
certificate in the form [M], which will operate as a
bar to any subsequent proceedings. If the order of
dismissal give costs, the payment of them cannot be
enforced until the complainant has been served with
a copy of the minute of such order (sec. 17). The
following form will suffice for the minute.
At a Petty Sessions of Her Majesty?s Justices of the Peace for
the holden at in and for the said
the day of 185
C, D,, Complainant,
against
A, 8., Defendant.
It is adjudged and ordered that the information [or
complaint] in this case for [state shortly the charge'], be dis-
missed with costs the said C. D. not appearing [or the said infor-
mation] [or complaint not being proved] and that the said C. D.
shall forthwith [or, on or before day of
next] pay to the said A. B. the sum ofnine shillings for the costs
incurred in his defence to be recovered by distress, and in default


�ho said 0. D. to be imprisoned for unless sooner
paid [with the costs of distress and of conveyance to gaol.]
W. 8., Clerk the Justice.
This minute should be issued in duplicate, and
the time and mode of service indorsed upon it by the
person who served it, and retained by the Clerk to
the justices. The mode of enforcing it, and the
necessary forms in connection therewith, will be con-
sidered in conjunction with the same points relating
to convictions.
It is not within the scope of this treatise to com-
prehend the numerous points that will arise for the
consideration of the justices in dealing with the
various offences which may be brought under their
cognizance in the exercise of their summary juris-
diction. Each case must depend upon its particular
circumstances both as to law and fact; but the fol-
lowing extract is given from Oke?s Synopsis, as
furnishing some very useful hints respecting adjudi-
cations in general, and touching some particular
portions of the Act, which will much assist the
justices in their construction of, and proceedings
under it:??
? Having determined to convict or make an order,
? they (the justices) should openly pronounce their
?judgment, according as they are by law empowered
? to do in the particular case, neither for too much
? nor too little; and in doing so, they should dis-
? tinctly state the amount of fine, or mitigated fine
? or imprisonment and costs, or imprisonment in
? default, the mode of recovery, and time of pay-
? ment, the additional imprisonment for costs where
? adjudged (in cases where the punishment is im-
? imprisonment only, and not a fine), the costs of
? conveyance to gaol, &c., as to costs and the different
? modes of recovering them; and where the defend-
? ant is convicted at the same time of two or more
? offences, whether imprisonment for one is to com-
? mence at the termination of the other or not. The
? amount of penalty or punishment, is entirely in
? the justice?s discretion where the statute says ? not


u exceeding ? so much or such a time; nor does it
11 require that the punishment in default of payment
?of a penalty adjudged should be proportionate to
? the maximum imprisonment allowed by the Act,
?i. e. if the maximum penalty be �5., and the
? maximum imprisonment two calendar months, that,
? if the justices convict in �2 10s., they should
?commit for one calendar month; but they may
? commit for two : for the penalties and imprison-
? ment in default are very disproportionate to each
u other, throughout the whole of the summary
?jurisdiction.
? In case of the charge being for a second or sub-
? sequent offence, for which an increased penalty
? can be awarded, the justices should, after decid-
? ing to convict for the offence now before them,
? have legal proof of the previous conviction or
? convictions, first ascertaining that the subsequent
? conviction can be treated as such, and a higher
? penalty awarded, as in many instances a time is
? limited for the conviction for a second or subse-
? quent offence from the previous conviction. The
? only legal admissible evidence of a previous con-
? viction, where a statute does not allow of any other,
?is either the conviction itself, produced by the
? proper officer, or by some one who has received it
? out of his custody, or an examined copy of the
? conviction in his custody (10 J. P., 527). In
? addition to this proof, however, there must be
? evidence of the identity of the defendant with the
? conviction, by the constable or some other person.?
The power of adjudicating under the 25th section
against a defendant who shall be in prison under-
? going imprisonment upon a conviction for any other
? offence ,? requires some care in its application, and
the following note of Mr. Oke upon the subject,
shows that its application may not be so practicable
as was contemplated:?
?lf the words ?in prison? and ?imprisonment?
? imply an actual confinement in the common gaol
? or house of correction (as Mr. Archbold, in a note


? to the sect., p. 171, seems to think they do), then
? the section would be applicable to those cases only
? where the defendant is convicted of the subsequent
? offence in his absence under the 13th section,
? and particularly in some cases where the statute
? requires the conviction to take place within a
? given time, there being no authority in justices to
? order a gaoler to bring up a person in his custody
?to a petty sessions to answer a summary charge,
? unless he was in prison on a remand merely, and
? not by way of punishment. If, however, as has
? been contended (1 Magis., p. 172), the defendant
?is ?in prison undergoing imprisonment upon a
? 1 conviction? from the moment of his being convicted
? of the first offence, the section applies ; but then
? only where the defendant is present at the time of
? conviction for both offences, for if he be convicted
?of the first or both offences ex parte (which he may
? be) on the same day, he would not be in prison
? at all at the time of the first conviction ; for the
? imprisonment in such a case begins to run from
? the time of the defendant being arrested under the
? committment, and not from the date of the convic-
? tion or commitment {ln re Boivdler , 12 J. P. 709;
? 17 Law J. Pep. (N. S.) Q. B. 245, overruling
? Fletcher?s case , 1 D. & R. 726 ; 13 Law J. Rep.
? (N. S.) M. C. 16); and therefore the section will
? not at all be applicable, and no cumulative im-
? prisonment could be adjudged. Therefore, where
? the defendant is in actual confinement for the first
? offence at the time of the second conviction, (ex
?parte), the commitment for the first offence pro-
? duced by the gaoler will not, as likewise contended
?at 1 Magis. p. 172, be evidence of the previous
? conviction ; bnt the usual proof of it, as noticed at
?p. 91, must be given to the justices. This section
? it will be observed, does not apply to orders on
? complaints; but it will be applicable to all de-
? scriptions of convictions for offences, whether the
? imprisonment for the first or second offence is
? in default of payment of a fine, or in default of
? distress, or imprisonment absolutely for a time
? certain ; but the cumulative imprisonment must
?be in all cases adjudged at the time of the hear-


? ing of the information and conviction, and not
11 deferred till the expiration of the first imprison-
? ment, and the commitment must be forthwith
? delivered to the gaoler.?
By the 17th section directions are given as to the
forms of convictions and orders, which, except in the
cases specified to the contrary, may be drawn up
according to the forms given by the Act [l.l, 2, 3,]
and [K, 1, 2, 3]. A minute of the order on con-
viction, or a memorandum thereof should at once be
made and entered in a separate book kept for that
purpose; or if no such book be kept, nor any book
of the proceedings where such entry can be made, it
should be written either on a separate paper, and
annexed to the information or complaint, or on the
back of the information, complaint, summons or
warrant, and signed by the convicting justice or
justices, so that any justice might thereupon enforce
the adjudication. As has been observed, however,
it is very desirable that all the proceedings should
be entered in a book, from their commencement to
their close. ?It will of course,? says Mr. Saunders,
? not escape the attention of justices that this clause
(the 17th) will not apply to convictions or orders
upon Acts subsequently passed, if those Acts them-
selves contain the requisite forms.?
With reference to orders?not convictions the
latter part of the 17th section enacts, ? that in all
cases where by any Act of Parliament authority is
given to commit a person to prison, or to levy any
sum upon his goods and chattels by distress for not
obeying any order of a justice or justices, the de-
fendant shall be served with a copy of the minute of
such order before any warrant of commitment or
distress shall issue in that behalf; and such order
or minute shall not form any part of such warrant
of commitment or of distress.? Of the orders to be
drawn up under this section some forms will be
given in a subsequent part. They may be filled up
at the hearing and served on the defendant, if he
appears _ before leaving the court; but, says Mr.
Oke, i( if he does not appear, it should be issued in


duplicate, and served by the constable either per-
sonally, or at his abode; see form (K 3) where this
mode of service is stated, and seems, therefore, part
and parcel of the enactment. No time of seizure is
required, and no proof of service seems necessary
before warrant of commitment or of distress issues.
As all sums are to be paid to the clerk to the justices
(s. 31), he seems the proper person to sign the
minute.?
Under the 18th section, the parties are em- costs,
powered to include in convictions or orders an adju- seiwood v.
dication as to costs; but they must fix the amount b.�726.? IQ ?
for themselves, and cannot delegate to their clerk, wooOQ? 1 '
or any other person to fix the amount. B - 730.


PART VI.
The scope and design of these pages preclude the
writer from entering further into the general
requisites of convictions and orders; and for the
manner of enforcing them, the justices are referred
to the Act itself and the various forms given in the
schedule thereto. The omission would be less felt,
even in a work of greater pretensions and more com-
prehensive objects, where, as in this colony, much of
the law upon the subject is considerably narrowed
by the powers given to the Supreme Court, under
14th Viet. c. 43, in regard to summary convictions
and orders, or warrants of commitment issued there-
on. If it be shown to what extent that Act will
operate, when properly applied, in curing defects in
convictions, orders, or warrants of commitments, and
particular instances in familiar cases be also given of
the manner in which these instruments should bo
drawn up, enough, it is trusted, will have been done
to convey to the justices such practical ideas on the
subject as will enable them to dispense with refer-
ence to more ponderous folios, in at least one very
important branch of their duty.
The object of the Colonial Act in the sections now
under consideration is two-fold, being Ist, remedial
where a party ought not to have been convicted at all;
and 2nd, corrective, where a party has been properly
convicted, but committed to prison on an erroneous
commitment. The sections which relate to this sub-
ject are from the 9th to the 15 th (both inclusive)
and as most of them will have to be alluded to, in
the course of the forthcoming remarks, the whole


are given, in solido, at the close of this part, for the
purpose of ready and convenient reference.
Difficulties may, possibly, arise in the legal con-
construction of the 9th section, in consequence of
the apparent difference between the powers contem-
plated in the reciting, and those conferred by the
enacting part, the former using only the words ? de-
fects of form.? All that can with propriety be here
observed on the point is, that the spirit of the Act
ought not to be sacrificed to the letter, and that
by the former a power of rectification by adaptation
and alteration, in addition to that of mere formal
amendment, is clearly intended to be, if not sub-
stantially given.
It is not, however, every defect that will be cured
even by this comprehensive section, nor was it in-
tended to operate as a transference to a higher
court, of any power or discretion vested by law in the
justices. Thus, if a party be committed under any
act for an offence for which he might be imprisoned
for a period not exceeding three months, and the
warrant of commitment specify ? six monthsthe
Court will not alter the commitment to three; for
the sentence is, in such a case, not u warranted in
substance,? but totally illegal through its excess;
and even if it were not so the suggested alteration
could not be made; for the term of imprisonment
must be that assigned by the justices, and could not
therefore be fixed by the court. Several cases of
this description have already occurred before the
Supreme Court, in which the parties have been
liberated on habeas corpus , notwithstanding it ap-
peared from the depositions that they had been
guilty of an offence which would have warranted
their detention in prison for a period much beyond
the time at which they had applied for, and were in
consequence of the excess, held entitled to, their dis-
charge.
Should the defect bo in the statement of the
offence, it may or may not be curable according to
the facts contained in the depositions. If for instance


a party is only liable to punishment for an offence
by virtue of his holding a particular character or
filling a particular office, and this be not stated in
the warrant of commitment or conviction, and does
not appear in, or cannot be gathered from, the
depositions; it cannot be afterwards inserted, nor
any evidence subsequently received of its being the
fact. The omission in such a case will render the
commitment void. If, however, the fact be stated in
the conviction, the court will not look to the deposi-
tions, but will amend the warrant of commitment by
the former; for the depositions are only required by
them where the conviction or warrant is defective;
and they will not under this section look into the
evidence for the purpose of rendering the commit-
ment or conviction invalid, but for the purpose only
of upholding them, if in want of such assistance to
render them valid.
Under this section the information, if any, together
with the depositions and conviction should be re-
pavneyi q turn ed; the latter is in practice seldom drawn up at
b-7h?,722. once; but if a defective one has been drawn up at
Mount, IQ, the time, and a copy of it delivered to the defendant
& pf;?s? C ? 011 application for it under the 15th section, the
lufha ds justices will not be bound by it, and a good one may
aq. b. 926. subsequently be supplied.
The language of the 9th section has not been
found to be a very clear exposition of the manner in
which it was intended to be practically worked.
How, or from whom, the justices are to receive
notice, or how or by whom, or within what time they
are to be required to transmit the depositions, &c.,
and in what manner they are to be certified and
forwarded so as to evidence their own authenticity to
the court or a judge, has been all left in a state of
uncertainty. The defendant himself, or his attorney,
should probably give such notice, and make such
requisition; but what kind of notice ? is it to be
personal service, or an intimation by post; and is it
intended that the prosecutor, if notice be given to
him, should transmit the depositions, &c.; or should
they be transmitted at his request by the magistrates?


These points are suggested by an experience of actual
difficulties arising out of the queries here put in
respect to them. The course, however, recommended Practieal
to the justices to pursue, on receiving the notice and suggestions
requisition mentioned in the 9th section, is, if the i �teAct! ng
conviction has not previously been drawn up, to
cause it to be drawn up forthwith, and then to
direct copies of that and of all the depositions and
information, if any, to be made and certified either
by themselves or by the clerk or party copying
them. The whole when copied should be fastened
securely together, and attached thereto should be a
certificate on a separate piece of paper, bearing the
following memorandum: ?
Between A, 8., Complainant, Form of
and certificate
n t\ p i . on transmis-
C. D. Defendant. s i on of depo-
Whoreas, I, E. F.,one of Her Majesty?s justices of the peace,
&c. by a notice bearing date, &c. justice or his
have been required to transmit to Her Majesty?s clerk ?
Supreme Court of Victoria [or His Honor Mr. Justice
one of the judges of Her Majesty?s Supreme Court of Victoria,]
the conviction [or order], information, and depositions taken
in the above case before me, and on which the warrant of com-
mitment issued by me, [or by ], committing the above-
named defendant to gaol for a period of months, was
founded, or certified copies thereof. Now, I, the said E. F. do
hereby certify that the accompanying information, deposition,
and conviction [or order] are those which [or that the accom-
panying documents are true copies of the information, &c., &c. #
which] I have been so required to transmit, and which I hereby
accordingly transmit, in pursuance of such requisitions. As
witness my hand this day of , at ,
in the colony aforesaid.
Where the justice is absent, and the clerk trans-
mits and certifies the depositions, &c., the above form
may be easily altered to meet the case. The recital
will be the same excepting that the justice will be
spoken of in the third person, and the clerk?s name
will not appear until the part commencing ? Now I,
&c.,? which may be altered thus : ? Now I, G. H.,
being the clerk, &c., and so on to the end.


The depositions, &c., when ready for transmission
should be directed according to the terms of the
requisition respecting them. If one of the judges
be named, they should be enclosed under cover to
him, or if the directions are generally to transmit
them ?to the Supreme Court or a judge thereof,? as
would be the case, if the notice were given prior to
the application for a habeas , they should be directed
to ? The Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court Office.?
They should always be transmitted at the earliest
possible opportunity, and, where it can be done, by
return of post; or if any unforseen impediment
should arise, a communication might be made to that
effect to the Crown Solicitor.
If the recommendation previously given be attended
to, of recording all the proceedings in summary
cases, in a book, only copies can be transmitted; but
whether they be so recorded or not, the more
proper course would be to send copies, and preserve
the originals in their regular place of deposit. There
is nothing under the 9th section, which makes it
imperative on the justices to comply with the trans-
mission of depositions, &c., or to furnish depositions
for any purpose, except on the terms mentioned in
the 15 th section ; but they would, probably for their
own justification, not hesitate to transmit them, if
required to do so by the party applying for his dis-
charge. It is true that the party could have ob-
tained such copies for his own use by an application
under the 15 th section; but as their production
might cure any defect in the warrant under which
he was committed, and the court would only look at
them for that purpose, it is unlikely in many cases,
that the defendant or his attorney would take any
step not required by the Act to cause them to be
produced. There are certain cases, however, par-
taking of the nature rather of a civil action than of
an offence concerning the public, where the justices
when required to transmit the proceedings on re-
ceiving notice of the defendant?s application for his
discharge, might reasonably expect ? the prosecutor
or party interested? to support the commitment, and
to be at the trouble and expense of procuring copies


*&f the depositions, &c., and ?causing them to be
transmitted? to the Court or a judge for that pur-
pose. It is left optional to the party giving notice,
whether it shall be to the justice before whom the
case was heard, ? or to the prosecutor, or party in-
terested,? and as such notice may, by the 11th
section be given, either before or after the issue of a
habeas corpus , it is not always in the power of the
court or a judge, to suggest, in the first instance, if
they should think fit to do so, to whom notice should
be given. Where, however, they had an opportunity
of exercising a discretion in this respect, in all pro-
bability they would do so, if the particular case
should seem to invite it.
As a preliminary to what may be required of the
Justices, some directions will be useful as to what
should be done by a defendant or his attorney,
before applying for his discharge by habeas corpus ,
on the ground of a defective commitment. In all
cases the proper course to pursue would be first,
to obtain copies of the depositions, information,
and conviction, and to ascertain from their perusal
whether any defect discovered in the commitment,
in respect of which an application for a habeas is
comtemplated, is one which can be cured. If the attor-
ney sees clearly that, on inspection of the depositions,
&c., by the Court, the defect will be curable, it is
his duty to inform his client of that opinion, and its
probable consequences; and he will do well to con-
sider whether, after having formed such an opinion,
he can conscientiously make the affidavit, or advise
his client to do so, which is required by the Court
or a Judge before directing a writ of habeas corpus
to issue. It has been, however, too much the prac-
tice for attornies to make applications for a de-
fendant?s discharge from prison under a summary
commitment, without taking the precaution above
suggested, and the consequence, in many cases, has
been a fruitless proceeding, and, of course, a fruit-
less expense. Undoubtedly there might be defend-
ants so situated that the delay which must elapse
before he could obtain the depositions, &c., would
justify an application to the Court without them, **


the commitment were clearly bad ; and of course if
it were incurably defective, no end could be attained
by their production. Where, however, the deposi-
tions can be obtained without delay, the attorney
should always procure them; for if th# defect in
the commitment be not remedied by them, he can
at once show that to the Court, and save the delay
of a notice to the justices; for under the 11th sec-
mTectofsec. ?where copies of the conviction or order and
depositions shall be produced at the time of apply-
ing for the writ, it shall be lawful for the Court or
a Judge to dispense with such notice, if such Court
or Judge shall think fit,? It is true that the 9th
section prescribes both a notice of the defendant?s
intention to apply for his discharge, and a requisi-
tion to transmit the depositions, &c.; but if these
were already authenticated before the Court, at the
time of applying for the writ, they would hardly
consider it obligatory on them to go through the
form of having a requisition made to the Justices to
transmit them.
Notice under Assuming, however, that the application has been
made, or is intended to be made, for a habeas corpus
before procuring the depositions, &c., the notice is
recommended to be given, where practicable, both
to the prosecutor and the Justices; for the Court
or a Judge might, possibly, require, in the event of
the latter only having had notice, and failed to
transmit the depositions, that notice should be given
also to the former. The notice might be in the
following form: ?
Form of No- Between A. B. complainant and C. D. defendant,.
justicV or Er Take notice that I, the above named defendant, intend apply-
Prosecutor. Her Majesty?s Supreme Court, or one of the Judges
thereof, for a writ of Habeas Corpus, in order that I may be
brought up on such day as the said Court or a Judge may
appoint, for the purpose of praying that I may he discharged
from my imprisonment under a warrant issued by you [or by
E. E., one of Her Majesty?s justices of the peace, &c.] in the
above case against me, and under which I have been committed
to goal for a period of months; and I further
give you notice, and require you to transmit [or cause to be
transmitted] to the Supreme Court, or one of the Judges
V 2


thereof, the information, depositions, and convictions taken
and made before you [or before the said justice] in the above
case, or certified copies thereof, with as little delay as possible,
in order that the same may be laid before the said Court or a
Judge on such day as shall be appointed [for hearing the appli-
cation for my discharge.
Dated this day of at gaol.
To E. F. or G. Esq. [or G. H. the prosecutor].
The notice may be given by the defendant?s at-
torney ; but the form will be in other respects the
same as the above. If the notice be given after the
habeas has been made returnable, the day must of
course be specified in the notice, and the name of
the Judge, or Court, as the case may be, stated.
The parts between brackets mark the only variation
necessary where notice is given to the prosecutor.
If personal service can be readily effected, the Court
Avould probably require that to be shewn; but
having reference to the circumstances of the Colony,
it has been in the habit of being satisfied with ser-
vice by the post. No rule, however, can be laid
down on the subject, and in any event a duplicate
of the notice should be preserved, in order that the
contents of the service should be clearly shewn, as
well as the time of its transmission, and the pro-
bability of its receipt by the party to whom it is
addressed. It is suggested that the superscription
of the envelope enclosing the notice to the Justices
should be addressed to "the magistrate byname or
the clerk of the bench where the conviction has
taken place. If two magistrates have convicted,
notice to one is sufficient. The alternative address
to the Justice or clerk is recommended, because it
would enable the latter, and might become his duty
in the absence of the former, to certify and return
the depositions, &c., under his own hand; for the
Act, although it requires notice to be given to the
Justices as to the transmission, does not require
that it shall be made by them.
The contents of the 12th and 13th sections will
now be considered. Under these sections, a de-
fendant may apply to the Supreme Court, or one of
the Judges, for a prohibition to restrain the Justice


or party prosecuting from proceeding in respect of
any conviction or order, provided the application be
made within a certain time, on an affidavit ? shew-
ing a primd facie case of mistake or error on the
part of the Justices.? On the matter coming
before the Court, they may test the conviction by
the evidence, if it be attacked on the merits; and if
it be assailed only on the ground of error or mis-
take, they may, if such error or mistake be amend-
able, direct the conviction or order to be amended
accordingly; and, in all proceedings under the two
sections, a discretion is given them to award costs
in such manner as they shall think fit.
It will be seen also from a full perusal of the
above sections, that, although the rule may
calling on the Justices to shew cause why a writ of
prohibition should not issue, it can only be made
returnable before the full Court in term, or on
some day in vacation on which the Court sits as in
Banco before two Judges, and can, of course, only
be made absolute at either of those times.
The 12th and 13th sections, it will be observed
by practitioners, involve proceedings of a different
nature from those prescribed by the 9th section.
In the first place, the affidavit must state distinctly
the express ground of the application, and ought to
shew clearly upon the face of the proceedings the
particular error complained of. For this purpose
verifi ed copies of all the proceedings ought to ac-
company the affidavits, in order that the Court may
see whether there are any primd facie grounds for
the application; for as the defendant himself may
procure these under the 15th section, the Court
wou Id not throw it upon the Justices to produce
the m, in reply, but leave it to the defendant who
complains of their insufficiency to establish that
fact if he can, by their production.
The 12th section is, in some respects certainly,
in the nature of an appeal from the decision of the
Justices; but hitherto the Court has never gone the
length of reversing that decision merely because


their own conclusion might, upon the whole facts,
have been different from that of the Justices. The
principle upon which the Judges have hitherto acted
is that pursued bj them in applications for new
trials on the ground of the verdict being against
the weight of evidence; in which case, if there were
any evidence at all to go to the jury a new trial is
generally refused. So, under the present section,
it is conceived that their duty would be, as it has
hitherto been their practice, in looking at the evi-
dence taken before the Justices, to see simply whe-
ther it is sufficient in point of law to support the
conviction. With reference to costs, each case must
depend on its own circumstances. In a recent case
before the Supreme Court of N. S. Wales {Ex parte
Smith), although the rule for a prohibition was
discharged, the Court refused to give costs, remark-
ing ? that a person seeking his liberty ought not to
be mulcted with costs except in extreme cases ; and
it could not be denied that the point involved in the
case before them was one of much difficulty.?
The most important decision, however, given by
the Supreme Court of N. S. Wales respecting the
12th section was decided on the 27th of April last,
in the case of Ex parte Towns?ln re Sharp ; in
which the Court held that the clauses relating to
prohibition and amendment extended ? only to orders
and convictions in criminal cases , or concerning
matters in their nature criminal?not to adjudications
or orders in cases of debt , or on claims or complaints
in the nature of suits for debt.? They held, there-
fore, that they had no power to restrain Justices
from proceeding to enforce an order made by them
under the Colonial Merchant Seamen?s Act, 13 Viet.
No. 28. s. 15., for the payment of wages. The
?whole case is an important one, and it is therefore
given in full in a subsequent Part. A few other
cases are also appended which will furnish some
hints both to the magistrates and the profession, in
a view of their respective duties and liabilities
under the Statutes referred to.

PART vm.
Cases decided by the Supreme Court of New South
Wales under the 14 Viet. No. 43.:
EX PARTE TOWNS. ?IN RE SHARP.
Sir Alfred Stephen, Chief Justice, delivered
the judgment of the Court in this case, as follows ;
This was a motion for a Prohibition, under the
Prohibition and Amendment Act, 14 Yict, No. 43.
s. 12. to restrain two of Her Majesty?s justices from
proceeding to enforce an order, made by them under
the Colonial Merchant Seamen?s Act, 13 Yict. No.
28. s. 15. ?for the payment of wages to Sharp, as a
seaman on board Towns? vessel, on a voyage from
Hongkong and Amoy to Sydney.
It appears that, in the course of the voyage,
Sharp was guilty of some acts of insubordination ;
and that, on the last of these occasions, the captain
ordered him off duty ?and so kept him (the man
never offering to return to his duty), for seventeen
days following. On arrival in this port, the captain
proceeded against Sharp for the insubordination,
under sect. 6 of the Seamen?s Act already men-
tioned ; and Sharp was sentenced, for the offence,
to thirty days? imprisonment. The justices awarded
against him, moreover, a deduction of forty shillings
from his -wages, for costs ?incurred (we presume)
in his apprehension.
Sharp suffered this imprisonment, and then sued
for the balance of his wages; which Towns resisted,


by claiming a forfeiture of six -days? pay, under
sect. 7 of the Act, for each of the seventeen during
which the man was off duty. But the justices held,
that the prosecution and punishment of Sharp, under
sect. 6, precluded all question of forfeiture under
sect. 7 ; and they awarded payment of the wages ac-
cordingly? certain deductions being allowed, which
will be more particularly referred to presently.
The questions which arise in this case, and on
which we have been pressed for an opinion, are
stated to be of much importance to the shipping
interests; and such as the magistrates, as well as
the parties more immediately concerned, would be
glad to have finally decided. We proceed, there-
fore, to offer our opinions upon them ; although, for
a reason which will appear in the sequel, those
opinions mush be considered, whenever the questions
shall again arise, as still open to discussion.
On the general question, whether the forfeitures
created by sect. 7 of the Seamen?s Act are cumula-
tive (that is to say, are irrespective of and in ad-
dition to the punishment provided by sect. 6), we
incline strongly to think that they are cumulative.
But we conceive that the sentence under sect. 6,
must be either to imprisonment alone, or the award-
ing of costs alone; not both. The imprisonment,
it appears to us, is in its nature and object punish-
ment, as for a crime. The awarding of costs, on
the other hand (although undoubtedly in one sense a
punishment) seems rather to be intended as a com-
pensation to the owner, in cases where he does not
press for the imprisonment. The forfeiture of wages
provided by sect. 7, would appear to be of the same
character; but to be irrespective of the enactment
as to imprisonment. The extreme limit of thirty
days might, in many cases, be a very inadequate
punishment. The forfeiture of wages, however, in
each case, is in due proportion to the offence; that
is to say, to its duration, and therefore to the extent
of the injury.
It could hardly be contended, we think, that in a


case of (for example) gross insubordination, whereby
the seaman would forfeit two days? pay only, the
master or owner would, by insisting on that for-
feiture, lose his right to prosecute criminally, under
sect. 6. But, if the master or owner may so pro-
secute, after deducting the forfeiture, in any such
case, why may he not first prosecute, and then
insist on the forfeiture ? By sect. 9, a seaman who
deserts forfeits all his wages. If that forfeiture be
no bar to his punishment, under the 6th section
(and it would be difficult to say how it could so
operate), then the two provisions are cumulative.
But if these are, why are not equally the provisions
in sections 6 and 7 ? It seems to us most unrea-
sonable to hold that they are either cumulative or
not cumulative, according to the section under which
the owner may first proceed.
We do not say, however, that in the present case
any forfeiture was established. If no other w r as re-
lied on than that of which the 17 days formed the
ground, we should not hesitate to express our
opinion, that none was established. In the first
place, the non-performance of duty during those days,
was, upon the evidence, the result of the Captain?s
own act. If, therefore, the man w T as thereby absent
from duty, he was not so (in the words of the enact-
ment) wilfully and without leave. But, secondly,
the man was not in any just sense absent at | all
during those days. The absence contemplated is,
plainly, something different from mere refusal or
neglect. It would require strong authority to in-
duce us to hold, that a seaman can be deemed
? absent? from duty who is present on the spot, (or,
at any rate, in the vessel,) able at a moment?s notice
to do that duty. The offence is, that, being present,
he refuses or omits to do it. The absence, in short,
must be of the same class or nature with desertion ;
something that, if without the animus revertendi ,
(or possibly, if long continued,) may amount to de-
sertion :?a bodily, entire absence from the ship, and
not a part of it only. Or, if the employment be in
a boat, or on a wharf, then the absence must be
wholly therefrom. If, in any such case, the absence


were without intent to return, it would be desertion
punishable by imprisonment, and" total forfeiture of
wages. But, if ? not treated as such? by the
Master, it will be punishable merely as absence
without leave.
But, although there was here no forfeiture by
absence , there was (we think) a forfeiture of two
days pay incurred, by every act of insubordination
or refusal established, or which might have been
established, against the seaman; supposing Such
act or acts to have been, as the proviso in s. 7 re-
quires, duly entered in the log. And, had the man
been daily ordered to do his duty, instead of being
put off? duty, during the 17 days in question, and
then had he refused or neglected such duty, a series
of similar forfeitures would have been incurred by
him; or, if the refusal or neglect were continued
throughout the twenty-four hours, a forfeiture in
each case of six days? pay.
It was suggested, that the acts of insubordination
complained of entitled the Master, immediately
thereupon, to dischange Sharp from his service ; and
so that the man henceforth earned no wages. But
(independently of the objection, that this was not
the ground on which his claim was resisted), we are
by no means prepared to assent to that proposition.
It is a very debateable point, to say the least,
whether the several provisions in the Merchant
Seamen?s Act, creating forfeitures and establishing
punishments by imprisonment, specifically, for acts
of insubordination, absence, and refusal to do duty,
were not (except in cases so flagrant, or of such a
nature, as to render the discharge almost a matter
of necessity,) intended as substitutes for the power
contended for. In the ordinary case of master and
servant, it is not every act of misconduct that will
justify immediate dismissal. And in the particular
case of seamen, it has been held expressly that neg-
lect in a single instance, (even when the offender
acted as Chief Mate,) will not defeat the claim for
wages, unless followed by injurious consequences;
nor will occasional acts of drunkenness, unless


habital. Sir Stephen Lushington has laid it down
as law, that the seaman?s misconduct ? must he such
as to render his discharge necessary for the safety
of the ship, and the due preservation of discipline.?
See the cases of Blake and the Duchess of Kent ,
cited in Shee?s Abbott, p. 652.
The forfeitures provided by s. 7, it was contended,
apply only only to offences committed in Port; the
previous section being confined, in terms, to offences
during or before commencement of the voyage. It
has already been seen that we do not adopt this con-
struction. If s. 6 applies, exclusively, to offences
committed at sea, or before the commencement of
the voyage, then desertion, or any act of refusal or
insubordination, however gross after such commence-
ment, if committed in port, are punishable by for-
feiture of pay only. On that question we distinctly
abstain from giving any opinion. But, whatever the
true construction in that respect of s. 6, and what-
ever cause may have suggested the use, in s. 7, of
terms varying from those used in the previous sec-
tion, we see nothing in the language of s. 7, in any
part of it, entitling us to say that it does not extend
to offences committed at sea, as much as to offences
committed in harbour.
The decision in Sharp?s favor is complained of,
as to amount ; that is to say, in not giving the owner
credit for certain payments in dollars, at a higher
rate of exchange. That the payments were so made
was not disputed; but the Justices allowed only
4s 2d for each dollar, whereas the claim was 5s per
dollar. The evidence on this point, we must say,
was, on either side, singularly loose and inconclusive.
The owner proved, that he had paid his own agent
the higher rate. For the sailor, it was shoAvn that
the British Consul debited only the lower.
The question, therefore, seems to have been one
solely of evidence ; as to what was, in fact, the cur-
rent exchange, or market value of the coin. And
we see nothing to justify us in holding, that the
Justices were wrong in adopting the Consul?s rate,


in preference to that of the Agent. It was but a
choice between difficulties, where there was no cer-
tain guide.
The important question yet remains, however;
has the Supreme Court any appellate authority, in
cases of this kind, over the decisions of Justices ?
And we are of opinion that it has not. By the com-
mon Law, the Writ of Prohibition lies, only/'where
the inferior Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction.
But no such excess is here asserted. The authority
which we are asked to exercise, therefore, must be
vested in this Court by positive enactment, or we
possess it not at all. We turn, then, to the Prohibi-
tion and amendment Act, which was relied on for
this purpose; and, after a careful consideration of
its provisions, we are of opinion that it extends, only,
to Orders and Convictions in criminal cases, or con-
cerning matters in their nature criminal ?not to Ad-
judications or Orders in cases of debt, or on claims
or complaints in the nature of suits for debt. Now,
unquestionably, many offences are created, or made
summarily punishable, by the Merchant Seamen?s
Act. These, therefore, it would seem clear, are
within the former class of cases. But the provision
respecting wages, establishing a summary mode for
their recovery, does nothing more than confer a
jurisdiction purely civil-; the exercise of which by
the justices, although the proceedings may (in
form) commence by way of complaint , cannot change
the nature of the claim, or make it other than what
it in truth is?a suit, and not a prosecution.
The remedy by prohibition, Ave entertain no doubt
Avas not provided for any case of that class. If it
A\ T ere, every action for debt, in the several Courts of
Petty Sessions, Avould be equally Avithin the enact-
ment. But the language of the first and ninth sec-
tions, as well as of the twelfth, Avhich gives to ag-
gricA T cd parties the remedy in question, is strong to
show that cases of prosecution for offences , alone, (or
acts in some sense criminal, not being the mere non-
payment of money due) Averc intended to be within
that enactment. Taking the three sections together,


and considering the use of the words ? offence? and
? party prosecuting,? and the provision as to amend-
ing errors of form, and respecting the production of
copies of depositions, we entertain no doubt as to the
correctness of this conclusion.
The rule for the Prohibition, therefore, in this
case, must be discharged. And, as we cannot say
that the application has failed on a technical point
merely, or that in such a case, either the Seaman
or the Magistrate (especially the former), should
bear the expense of opposition, the Rule must be
discharged with costs.
IN RE JOHN SMITH.
A writ of habeas corpus had been granted on Fri-
dap last, in obeisance to which John Smith, a pri-
soner charged before the Water Police Bench with
desertion, was now brought before the Court, and a
return was made by the Magistrates, from which it
appeared that the case was still pending, the prisoner
haying been remanded until Tuesday (to day) for
judgment. The question to be decided was, whether
or not the ship?s articles, which had formed the
basis of the charge of desertion, were void for un-
certainty as to the nature of the voyage contracted
for by the parties.
Their Honours held that the question at issue
could not be raised and determined at that stage of
the case. The prisoner was properly in custody
under any circumstances, so far as regarded the
ultimate decision of this question, for he was merely
under remand to await the decision of the Court be-
low upon a charge, undoubtedly within its jurisdic-
tion. It did not follow but that he might yet be
discharged. Either upon conviction or upon the
magistrates declining to give a decision, the judg-
ment of the Supreme Court might be properly in-
voked, but as the case stood, such a judgment ?would
be wholly extra-judicial. The return was conse-
quently held good, and the prisoner remanded to his
former custody.


IN RE THORPE PROHIBITION.
Samuel Thorpe, a carrier, was convicted on the
24th December last before the Bench of Magistrates
at Gayndah, under the 67th section of the 13th
Victoria, No. 29; the charge being in substance
? carrying about for, or exposing to sale, liquors
without a license.? The Clerk of the Bench drew
up a memorandum at the foot of the depositions,
which was signed by the presiding magistrate, in
these words, ? The Bench having duly considered
the case, are of opinion the charge is fully proven
against Samuel Thorpe, and they sentence him to
pay a fine of �5O to the Queen, and the costs of the
case: to be allowed fourteen days for payment ; in
default of payment to be committed to Brisbane
Gaol for three months.?
On the 22nd January, Mr. Purefoy obtained
from a Judge in Chambers, a rule nisi, under the
12th section of the 4th Victoria, No. 43, calling on
the prosecutor, Mr. Sandeman, and the Magistrates,
Messrs. O?Connell and Wilkins, to show cause on
the Ist day of the present term, why a writ of pro-
hibition should not issue to restrain them from fur-
ther proceedings in respect of the said conviction,
on the grounds, Ist, that the conviction appears to
have been made under the 67th section of the 13th
Victoria, No. 29, and which section gives no power
to the magistrates to imprison for three months;
2ndly, that the judgment is in the alternative, and
therefore bad; and 3rdly, that no amount of costs
is named in the conviction.
Mr. Holroyd, for the magistrates, took a pre-
liminary objection, that the alledged conviction or
order was merely a memorandum appended to the
depositions, and not such a conviction or order as
could be acted upon.
The Court decided that it was an order, but that
under the 13th section of the 14th Victoria, No. 43,
they had power to amend it, and should do so most
completely if necessary.


Mr. Holroyd, in showing cause, said, that the
magistrates in considering the guilt of the accused,
had a right to take into consideration the circum-
stances attending his conduct. It would he most
difficult to convict of this offence unless the conduct
of the party were taken into account; as it rarely
happens that a party who has purchased grog will
come forward as a witness against the sly-grog seller.
The magistrates had jurisdiction in the case, though
the spirits and dray of the defendant were not taken
before them. But if they had no jurisdiction this
objection was too late now, it should have been
taken at the hearing.
Mr. Purefoy, in reply, contended, that the pro-
ceedings were illegal, that the spirits in not haying
been seized by a magistrate or constable were ille-
gally seized, and that the conviction or order was
bad for fixing a term of imprisonment and being in
the alternative.
His Honour the Chief Justice delivere d the
judgment of the Court. The conclusion at which
we have arrived is, that we must wait the arrival of
the conviction, as it is expected in Sydney, if it
come within a reasonable time. As a general rule,
the party intending to apply for a prohibition should
mention his intention to the magistrates, and ask
for a copy of the conviction. In this case the ma-
gistrates should merely have said, ? We adjudge you
to pay a fine of �50.? If the conviction be silent
on the subject of imprisonment, it will be good. The
67th section of 15th Victoria, No. 29, is clumsily
worded. We think, however, that the magistrates
may inflict a fine though the liquor is not seized and
brought before them. The question is one of diffi-
culty, and not without doubt. The question which
the magistrates had to determine was this: Was
there sufficient evidence before them to convict
Thorpe ? An affidavit has been made by Thorpe to
establish his innocence; this we think we ought to
disregard. Throwing aside this affidavit and the
others which have been filed, we think there was suf-
ficient evidence before the magistrates to justify them
G 2


in coming to the conclusion that Thorpe was~carry-
ing about liquor for sale. We think Thorpe was
rightly convicted in the penalty of �5O. Instead of
the fourteen days allowed for payment, a distress
warrant should have been issued. If the penalty be
all that is included in the conviction, we hold it good;
but for the purpose of seeing the conviction, we shall
enlarge the rule till next Thursday.
IN THE MATTER OF THE CONVICTION OF NATHAN
%
AND MARKS. ?PROHIBITION.
Mr. Holroyd, on the part of Messrs. Nathan and
Marks, moved for a rule calling upon Colonel Mor-
riset and Major Wentworth, Justices of the Peace, to
show cause why a Writ of Prohibition should not
issue, to restrain them from proceeding further in a
conviction under the 13th Victoria, No. 29, s. 2,
made by the said justices on the 23rd July last.
The learned counsel stated that the defendants were
convicted on the 18 th July of selling spirituous
liquors without a license. The evidence before the
magistrates was conflicting; and it seemed extraordi-
nary that, on the face of the evidence they should
have adjudged the defendants guilty of the charge.
After conviction, repeated applications were made
to the Justices for a copy of the conviction, with a
view to apply to the Supreme Court for a Prohibition ;
and on the 2nd of September (six weeks after the
conviction) a letter was received by the defendants?
attorney, from Colonel Morriset, from which it ap-
peared that the depositions had been sent to Sydney
for the Crown Prosecutor to draw the conviction, a
most extraordinary proceeding on the part of the
Justices, inasmuch as the Clerk of the Bench, at
Bathurst, at that time was a professional gentleman,
and he could only account for the depositions having
been sent to the Crown Prosecutor, in consequence of
a circular which that officer had some time ago
addressed to the different Magisterial Benches, in
which he offered to draw their convictions. Eventually,
on the 2nd of October, the conviction was drawn,
and a few days after, a copy was forwarded to the


defendants? attorney. The learned counsel added
that by the 14 Victoria, No. 43, s. 12, the applica-
tion should have been made to the Court within
thirty days after conviction, hut as there was no
memorandum or order drawn up at the foot of the
depositions, the time should count from the time the
conviction was actually drawn, and not from the
time of the verbal finding and adjudication of the
Justices.
The Chief Justice said, that the Court must
refuse the rule, as the Act under which the applica-
tion was made restricted the interference of the
Court to within thirty days after conviction. The
Magistrates had acted most improperly in not fur-
nishing to the defendants the copy of the conviction
when applied for, or within a reasonable time after.
The defendants were not without a remedy if they
thought right to enforce it.


PART IX.
The third of Jervis?s Acts adopted by the Colonial
Act, has for its object and title, the ? Protection
of Justices of the Peace from vexatious Actions
for Acts done by them in Execution of their
Office.? In addition to this Act, the 14th section
of the Colonial Act (see page 72 ante) contains
an enactment prohibitory of any action being
brought at all, where a rule or order to shew cause
shall have been obtained under the previous clauses,
even though it should be subsequently discharged.
The provisions of Jervis?s Act are classified by Mr.
Oke as follows:?
1. No action is to be brought unless commenced within six
calendar months next after the act complained of is committed
(s. 8); and one calendar month?s notice in writing of such action
is to be given to the Justice, either personally or left at his
abode (s. 9).
2. After notice of action given, and before it is brought, de-
fendant (the Justice) may tender amends; or after action
brought, and before issue joined, pay money into court. If no
more damage proved, a verdict to pass for defendant, and the
sum paid in to be paid out of court to the defendant; and if the
amount exceeds the defendant?s ?costs, the residue is to be paid
to the plaintiff. If plaintiff elect to accept the sum paid in, in
satisfaction of damages, a judge to grant an order to that effect,
and that defendant shall pay the plaintiff?s taxed costs, and the
action be determined (s. 11).
3. The onus of proof of due notice, of action brought within
the time limited, of the cause of action stated in the notice,
and that it arose in the county laid as venue, to lie on the
plaintiff; in either case, if no proof, the plaintiff to be nonsuit,
or a verdict for the defendant (s. 12).
4. The venue is to be laid in the county where the act com-
plained of was committed, or in the county court in the district;


and the defendant may plead the general issue, and give any
special matter in evidence under such plea; but no action is to
be brought in any such county court if the Justice object
thereto; and if within six days after being served with a sum-
mons, such justice, or his attorney or agent, shall give written
notice (k) to the plaintiff that he objects to being sued in such
court, all proceedings afterwards had in such court shall be null
and void (s. 10).
5. No action to be brought for the manner in which a Justice
shall exercise a discretionary power given him (s. 4).
6. If a Justice refuse to do an act, the Court of Queen?s Bench
may, by rule grounded on an affidavit of the facts, order him to
do it, and no action shall be brought against him for doing it
(5.5).
7. If an action be brought where by this Act it is prohibited, a
Judge may set aside the proceedings (s. 7).
8. For an act done by a Justice in the execution of his duty
as such Justice, with respect to any matter within his jurisdiction,
the action shall be on the case; and it shall be expressly alleged
in the declaration that such act was done maliciously, and
without reasonable and probable cause (s. 1).
9. For an act done by a Justice without jurisdiction, or ex-
ceeding his jurisdiction (1), any person injured thereby, or by
any act done under any conviction or order made or warrant
issued by Justice thereon, may maintain an action in the same
form and in the same case as he might have done before the
passing of this Act, without making any allegation in his decla-
ration that the act complained of was done maliciously, and
without reasonable and probable cause (s. 2); but see proviso in
Nos. 11 and 12 post.
10. If the act complained of is shewn to have been done
maliciously, and without reasonable and probable cause, and a
verdict is given against the Justice, or if judgment by default,
full costs of suit follow; and where there is a verdict for the
Justice, he is to have his costs as between attorney and client
(s. 14); (vide No. 10 post, where the plaintiff is not entitled to
any costs).
The particular provisions of the statute (11 and
12 Viet., c. 44), which, in addition to the general
provisions above noticed, are applicable more imme-
diately to the acts of Justices in matters within
their cognizance, are as follows :
11. No such action (for an act done without or exceeding his
jurisdiction, as in No. 9 supra) shall be brought for an act done


under a conviction or order until after such conviction shall
have been quashed, either upon appeal or by the Court of
Queen?s Bench;
12. Nor for anything done under a warrant issued to procure
the appearance of the party, and which shall have been followed
by a conviction or order, until after such conviction or order
shall be so quashed;
13. Nor for an act done under a warrant to compel appearance
(if not followed by a conviction or order, or if it be a warrant
for an indictable offence), if a summons were previously issued
and not obeyed (s. 2).
14. If one Justice make a conviction or order, and another
grant a warrant upon it, bona Jlde and without collusion, the
action must be brought against the former not the latter, for a
defect in such conviction or order (s, 3).
16. After a conviction or order confirmed upon appeal, no
action is to be brought against a Justice who granted a warrant
of distress or commitment upon it, for anything which may have
been done under the same, by reason of any defect in such con-
viction or order (s. 6).
16. If the plaintiff in an action is entitled to recover, and shall
prove the levying or payment of any penalty or sum of money
under any conviction or order as part of his damage, or if he
prove that ho was imprisoned, and seeks to recover damages for
such imprisonment, he shall not be entitled to recover th#
amount of such penalty or sum so levied or paid, or any sum
beyond twopence as damages for such imprisonment; or any
costs of suit whatsoever, if it shall be proved that he was actu-
ally guilty of the offence of which he was so convicted, or that
he was liable by law to pay the sum he was so ordered to pay,
and (with respect to such imprisonment) that he had undergone
no greater punishment than that assigned by law for the offence
of which he was so convicted, or for non-payment of the sum
he was ordered to pay (s. 13).
Previously to the passing of the statute above
analysed, most of the statutes giving summary
jurisdiction contained protective clauses, upon which
the most liberal construction was always put by the
courts ; particularly as regards the right of Justices
and others to notice of action, under the belief that
they were acting within the scope of their jurisdic-
tion or in the exercise of their office. The general
rule upon the subject, which is equally applicable
now, was thus stated by Lord Campbell in a very


Juddowand recent case : ?? There can be no rule more firmly
Moore, r 'pn established than that, if Justices bona fide and not
c. Rep. 283. absurdly believe that they are acting in pursuance
of statutes and according to law, they are entitled
to the special protection which the legislature in-
tended for them, although they have done an illegal
act.?
The following case is an illustration of the appli-
cation of the doctrine. To an action for trespass
for assault and false imprisonment defendants pleaded
not guilty (by statute), relying on the Game Act,
I&2W. 4, c. 32, s. 31. The Judge left it to the
jury to say whether or not the defendants believed
they were acting in pursuance of the statute, and if
so, whether they had reasonable grounds for so be-
Cox v Beid lieving. The jury found that the defendants thought
and another, they were acting in pursuance of the statute; in
is q. b. 558. conge q Uence 0 f -which the Judge directed a nonsuit,
for want of a month?s notice of action, according to
sec. 47. On a motion for a new trial, on the ground
of misdirection, the Court of Queen?s Bench held
that the question was properly left to the jury, and
that the defendants were entitled to notice, whether
the trespass was actually justifiable under the statute
or not.
Horn The doctrine extends also to persons apprehending
Thom-' another under the Malicious Trespass Act, 7& 8
E O xch'. R �. , B4o. G. 4, c. 30, although not the owner of the property
injured, if he causes such apprehension under the
bona fide belief that he is acting in pursuance of the
statute.
In an action against the Judge of a County Court,
for making an order after having been served with a
Booth v. writ of prohibition, the Judge at the trial told the
and p. 2 283 M ? jury that if the defendant acted in the bona fide
belief that his duty made it incumbent on him to do
so notwithstanding the prohibition, the Act must
be considered as ? done in pursuance of? the County
Courts Act; and that the defendant did ?reason-
ably ? believe it was his duty to proceed, jf he be-
lieved according to his reason, as contra-distinguished


from caprice. The direction was held by the Court
of Common Pleas to be correct.
Other recent cases on the point are Kine v. Ever-
shed, 10 Q. B. 143, 151, and Hughes v. Buckland,
15 M. $ W., 346, where most of the previous author-
ities are cited.
The interpretatation of the protective clauses of
Jervis? Act 11 and 12 Viet., c. 44, sec. 1 and 2,
has been illustrated in tAvo very recent cases, one of
which is noted in the margin, and the other is of
sufficient importance to give entire as reported in 13,
Q. 8,, 393.
Trespass for seizing Goods. Plea: Not Guilty by statute. On
the trial before Platt 8., at the Oxford Spring Assizes, 1850, it
appeared that the defendant was a Justice of the Peace, and had
convicted the plaintiff under stat. 29 Car. 2, c. 7., for Sunday
trading, in a penalty of ss. and 11s costs. The conviction was in
the form set forth, ante, p. 389., and was quashed by this Court
on certiorari, on account of the adjudication that the plaintiff
should be put in the stocks for two hours unless the penalty and
the costs were sooner paid. Before the conviction was quashed,
penalty and costs were levied by distress on the plaintiff?s goods. The
conviction being quashed, this action was brought for the distress.
The learned Judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff, reserving
leave to move to enter a verdict for the defendant if the Court
should be of opinion that he was entitled to the protection of
stat. 11 and 12 Yict., c. 44.
Keating, in the ensuing term, obtained a rule nisi accordingly.
Whateley and J. Gray now showed cause. This is an action
brought against a Justice of the Peace for an ?act done? in a
matter in which he has ?exceeded his jurisdiction.? It is there-
fore within the words of stat. 11 and 12 Viet. c. 44, s. 2.; and the
action lies, as before the passing of that statute; Leary v. Patrick.
The 13th section shows that the plaintiff may recover, though
the justice had general jurisdiction.
Keating and Greaves, in support of the rule. Stat. 11 and 12
Viet., c. 44 was passed to protect justices from vexatious actions.
Sect. 1 protects them from actions of trespass for any act done
with respect to a matter within their jurisdiction. This must
mean to give them protection where they would not have
it but for the statute; and it must therefore embrace cases
in Avhich their proceedings are informal. Such a case as the


present seems precisely what the legislature intended to meet.
Then sect. 2 is, if construed literally, not with sect.
1 ; but, giving it a reasonable construction, it means that the
action shall be where the act complained of was in excess
of jurisdiction. Here the act complained of is the levying
by distress of the penalty and costs: that was an act within the
defendant?s jurisdiction, and protected by sect. 1. Had the
action been brought for putting the plaintiff in the stocks, that
would, like the acts complained of in Leary v. Patrick , have
been an excess of jurisdiction, and within sect. 2. It must be
owned that no sensible construction can be put on sect. 13.
Coleridge, J.~-This, certainly is an important case; and I
fear I must also agree that this statute is exceedingly ill worded.
I think the present case falls within both the words and the in-
tent of sect 1. The facts are these: There is an information laid
before the justice ; he convicts: he awards a penalty and costs,
and orders them to be levied by distress. All this was right; and
the justice so far pursued his jurisdiction. But he added an
alternative, that the plaintiff should be put in the stocks in case
the penalty and costs were not paid, or raised by distress: that
was beyond his jurisdiction. But the plaintiff was not in fact
put in the stocks. His goods were seized under a distress ; and
afterwards the conviction was quashed. Now it cannot be
doubted that the justice had jurisdiction in everything except
the alternative order ; and the action is brought, not for putting
the plaintiff in the stocks under it, but for doing that which the
defendant might have justified if he had drawn up his conviction
in proper form. Then we have stat. 11 and 12 Fict. s c. 44, s. 1.,
which relates to actions ?brought against any Justice of the
Peace for any act done by him in the execution of his duty as
such Justice, with respect to any matter within his jurisdiction
as such justice.? I think words can hardly be found more accu-
rately to describe the act which the defendant had done and for
which this action is brought. But sect. 2 raises a question
whether the words in sect. 1 are to have full effect given to them
so as to protect the defendant. The case is within the spirit of
the Act, which is one for protection of justices, and, therefore,
assumes that the justice has been guilty of some irregularity, or
he would not need protection. Now sect. 2 enacts that, ? for any
act done by a Justice of the Peace in a matter of which, by law,
he has not jurisdiction, or in which be shall have exceeded his
jurisdiction, any person injured thereby, or by any act done
under any conviction or order made or warrant issued by such
justice in any such matter, may maintain an action against such
Justice in the same form, and in the same case as he might have
done before the passing of this Act,? after the conviction has
been quashed. lam not prepared to deny that the present case
falls within the literal meaning of those words; for this is an
act done under a conviction in a mattorjn which the defendant


has exceeded his jurisdiction. But, if wo give these words their
full literal meaning, they contradict the first section. We must
then try to construe them so as to give effect to the whole of the
Act: and I think we do this if we confine sect. 2 to cases in
which the act by which the plaintiff is injured is an Act in
excess of jurisdiction: for instance, if the plaintiff in the present
case had been put in the stocks under the illegal alternative and
the action had been brought for that; in which case, probably,
trespass might have lain; as it is, I think it does not.
WigMman , J. ?I also think the objection that the justice is
entitled to the protection of stat. 11 and 12 Viet, c. 44, s. 1, well
founded, as this action is brought with respect to a matter within
his jurisdiction. The complaint which forms the subject of the
action is that he distrained the plaintiff?s goods. This he did in
a matter in which he had general jurisdiction, and in which he
had, down to the very moment of the drawing up of the conviction,
duly pursued his jurisdiction. But in drawing up the convic-
tion, he adds an illegal alternative, that if the costs are not levied
the offender shall be put in the stocks. Now the plaintiff was
not put in the stocks; but his goods were seized: and that seems
to me an act, within the meaning of sect. 1, done by the justice
in the execution of his duty with respect to a matter within his
jurisdiction. It is said, also, to be within sect 2, because, though
the act for which the plaintiff sues was not beyond the justices
jurisdiction, yet it was an act done in a matter in which he ex-
ceeded his jurisdiction in one point. But the matter in which
he exceeded his jurisdiction was ordering the plaintiff to be put
in the stocks: had he acted on that, and caused him to be putin
the stocks, trespass might have lain; as it is, I think the action
is not brought for a matter in which he exceeds his jurisdiction
and the case is with sect. 1.
'Erie, J . ?I am of the same opidion: I think the cause of action
was an act done by the defendant in the execution of his duty
a as justice with respect to a matter within his jurisdiction as such
justice. The justice had jurisdiction to convict, and to order
payment of the penalty and costs, and to levy them by distress.
All these things he had to do in the execution of his duty; and
he had jurisdiction to do them. But there was a defect in the
conviction, as the justice ordered an alternative beyond his juris-
diction. If anything had been done in respect of the wrongful
order, it would have been an act beyond his jurisdiction ; but
there was nothing of the sort. It was a mere error as to the man-
ner in which the conviction should be framed, which caused the
justice to draw it up in a wrong form; and, on account of the
formal defect, the conviction was quashed. I think the case is
precisely that which sect. lis intended to protect. Then I think
the construction of sect. 2 must be so controlled by sect. 1 as to
be consistent with it; and that is done by so construing sect. 2as


to confine its application to cases in which the cause of action
arises from the excess of jurisdiction, as it would have done in
this case if the plaintiff had been put in the stocks, and he had
brought the action for that.

Greame and imprisonment against the committing magistrate.
cTm'aie 1 . 3 Thus, where a party was committed to prison for
non-payment of a sum ordered to be paid on con-
viction under the 7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 80, and two
convictions were subsequently sent to the Quarter
Sessions, it was held, in an action for false imprison-
ment against the committing magistrate, that he
might defend himself by the second conviction, if it
was valid in itself.
Actbn for 0 connex i� n with the subject of actions against
refusing Bail magistrates, a case of great importance has recently
been decided. An action was brought against a
magistrate for refusing to take bail; and it was held
Fitzroy "a lat could not be sustained without proof of
q l . b?240. malice, even though the plaintiff were entitled to
bail, and had tendered sufficient sureties. The judg-
ment of the Court of Queen?s Bench upon the point
was thus delivered by Lord Denman;?
This was an action on the case against the defendant, a
magistrate of the county of Norfolk, for refusing to admit the
plaintiff to hail. The declaration stated that the plaintiff was
charged with an assault upon a constable in the execution of his
duty; that sufficient hail was tendered; hut the defendant
absolutely, unlawfully, and maliciously, and without reason or
probable cause or ground whatsoever, refused to accept the
security offered, or any other security whatsoever. The jury on
the trial negatived malice , but found a verdict for the plaintiff.
The question therefore is, whether the declaration is good with-
out the allegation of malice; for the effect of the finding is to
strike out that allegation. This depends upon another question,
whether the duty, the breach of which is charged in this declar-
ration, was judicial or ministerial.
The statute of Westminster (the first) 3 Ed. 1, c. 15, provides
that, ?If any withhold prisoners replevisable, after that they
have offered sufficient surety, he shall pay a grievous amercia-
ment to the king�y the same statute the offenders declared


replevisable are defined, and, amongst others, those accused of
other trespasses (than those specially mentioned) ? for which
one ought not to lose ife nor member.? Some doubt may have
existed in early times whether this definition included all misde-
meanours, or only common misdemeanours, and, if the latter
only, what were common; but for many years the received
opinion and practice has been, that all persons accused of misde-
meanour, whether common or otherwise, are entitled to he
admitted to bail. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that the
legislature, in a late Act of Parliament, 11 & 12 Yict., c. 42, s. 23,
has drawn a distinction, and has given authority to magistrates
to admit to bail, at their discretion, persons accused of certain
specified misdemeanours (among which is the very one of
assaulting a peace officer in the execution of his duty) but has
directed that in all other cases of misdemeanour magistrates
shall admit to bail.
Assuming, however, that this plaintiff was entitled to bo
admitted to bail, what was the nature of the magistrate?s duty
who was called upon so to admit him ? Clearly, that duty w T as
to a great extent judicial; namely, in respect of fixing the
amount of bail and of determining as to the ability of the per-
sons tendered, which two requisites make up the sufficiency. It
is, however, contended that if those requisites exist, the act of
admitting to bail becomes ministerial only; that this declaration
shews those requisites to have existed; and that the jury have so
found; consequently, that nothing remained for the magistrates
to do but to admit to bail; and that his duty had become minis-
terial ; that he refused to perform that duty without reasonable
or probable cause; and is, therefore, liable to an action, even in
the absence of malice, just as an action will lie against a sheriff
for refusing to take bail or grant replevin, or against a magistrate
for refusing to take examinations under the statute of Hue and
Cry. In Regina v. Tracey, 6 Mod. 179, it was said by the Court
that ?It is an offence in a Justice of the Peace to refuse bail in
case of a common misdemeanour. And it suffices to say in the
indictment, that sufficient bail was tendered, without saying that
the party knew them to be sufficient! ? and upon that authority
principally it is that the plaintiff contends that this declaration
shews that the defendant?s judicial duty was satisfied and at an
end, and his ministerial duty only remained to be exercised.
We have had much doubt and difficulty in coming to a conclu-
sion upon this point. But upon the fullest consideration, we
are of opinion that the duty of the magistrate in respect to
admitting to bail cannot be thus split and divided; that it is
essentially a judicial duty, involving inquiries in which discre-
tion must be exercised, and, in some cases of misdemeanour,
discretion under circumstances of much nicety; and that we
cannot lay down a rule which is to depend upon the peculiar


facts of each case. The broad line of distinction is this, ?that,
unless the duty of the magistrate is simply and purely minis-
terial, he cannot be made liable to an action for a mistake in
doing or omitting to do anything in execution of that duty,
unless lie can be fixed with malice, -which in this case has been
negatived by the jury.
In further illustration of the efficacy of the 11 &
12 Vie., c. 44, in protecting magistrates, the fol-
lowing digest of a recent case is extracted from the
Law Magazine for August, 1851, p. 45: ??By
section 1 of 11 & 12 Vic., c. 44, every action to
be brought against any Justice of the Peace for any
act done by him in the execution of his duty as such
Justice, with respect to any matter within his juris-
diction, shall be an action on the case.? By section
7 of 53 Geo. 3, c. 127, two Justices are empowered,
? by order under their hands and seals,? to direct
the payment of money due for church rates, with
costs; and upon refusal of parties ?to pay according
to such order,? by warrant under hand and seal to
levy the rate and costs by distress. By section 14
of 11 & 12 Vic., c. 43, it is enacted, ? that if Jus-
tices convict or make an order against a defendant,
a minute thereof shall be then made, and the con-
viction or order shall be afterwards drawn up in a
proper form under their hands and seals.? By sec-
tion 17, ?In all cases where, by any Act, authority
is given to levy any sum upon any person?s goods
by distress, for not obeying any order of Justices,
the defendant shall be served with a minute of such
order before any warrant of distress shall issue in
that behalf.? The plaintiff having been rated to a
church rate and refused to pay, a complaint was
made before Justices, and duly heard; and on the
6th of May a verbal order was made for payment by
the plaintiff of the amount of the rate and costs.
This order was not formally drawn up till some days
afterwards. On the 7th a minute of the order was
served upon the plaintiff, who refused to pay. After
such refusal the order was formally drawn up, dated
the 6th of May, and a warrant issued by the de-
fendants, dated the same day, wdiich w T as not exe-
cuted until October, when a cart of the plaintiff was
seized for the distress. It did not appear whether


tli� warrant was drawn up before or after the order
dated the 6th of May, nor did it recite the order.
The plaintiff having brought trespass for the seizure,
held that it was not necessary, before issuing the
warrant, that an order should have been formally
drawn up under hand and seal, but that the pro-
nouncing of the order on the 6th, and the service of
the minute of the order on the 7th, were sufficient
to justify the issuing of the warrant; and that the
non-recital of the order in the warrant, aud the fact
of the date of the warrant being the same as the
date of the order, and the neglect to shew in the
warrant that it had issued subsequently to the dis-
obedience of the order, being all only matters of
form, the defendants were entitled to the protection
of section lofll & 12 Vic., c. 44. Semble (per
Jervis, C. J.). The words ? exceeding his jurisdic-
tion,? in section 2 of 11 & 12 Yic., c. 44, mean
doing something which the Justice could by no
possibility have a legal right to do. Rail v. Par-
kinson, 20 Law J. (N. S.), M. C. 208.?
From the above cases it will be seen how broad
the shield thrown by the law over the actings of
magistrates, where they do not spring from cor-
ruption, or from error culpably negligent, capricious,
or perverse. At the same time no one should accept
the office of magistrate .who is not sensible of both
the desire and capacity to attain such a knowledge
of his duties as will enable him to perform them
with an ordinary degree of security to himself, and
of satisfaction to the public.
The mode of compelling a magistrate to do any
act which he may have by virtue of his office to
perform, has hitherto been by Mandamus , but the
sth section of the Act now under consideration has
enabled parties to substitute a much more simple
mode of proceeding. The words of that section are
as follows: ?
And whereas it would conduce to the advancement of justice,
and render more effective and certain the performance of the
duties of Justices, and give them protection in the performance
of the same, if some simple means, not attended with much ex-


pense, were devised, by which the legality of any act to be done
by such Justices might be considered and adjudged by a Court
of competent jurisdiction, and such Justice enabled and directed
to perform it without risk of any action or other proceeding
being brought or had against him: Be it therefore enacted, that
in all cases where a Justice or Justices of the Peace shall
refuse to do any act relating to the duties of his or their office as
such Justice or Justices, it shall be lawful for the party requiring
such act to be done to apply to Her Majesty?s Court of Queen?s
Bench, upon an affidavit of the facts, for a rule calling upon such
Justice or Justices, and also the party to be affected by such act,
to shew cause why such act should not be done! and if, after due
service of such rule, good cause shall not be shewn against it, the
said Court may make the same absolute, with or without pay-
ment of costs, as to them shall seem meet! and the said Justice
or Justices, upon being served with such rule absolute, shall obey
the same, and shall do the act required! and no action or pro-
ceeding whatsoever shall be commenced or prosecuted against
such Justice or Justices, for having obeyed such rule and done
such act so thereby required as aforesaid.
This enactment appears to have been hitherto
overlooked by the profession ; and has hardly, even
in England, come to be fully appreciated and acted
upon. Two recent instances of its application will
be found in the cases cited in the margin; but
neither in New South Wales nor in this Colony has
advantage been yet taken of its provisions.


PART X.
It was stated previously (ante p. 5) that forms
would be given of the manner in which criminal �� ar c ? mioa!
offences should be described in warrants and com- c arge '
mittals; but as any error in this respect seldom
produces practical evils, either as regards the escape
of the prisoner or the liability of the?Magistrate, it
has been deemed unnecessary to burden the work
with the forms alluded to. It will be sufficient to
observe that a party apprehended ? on suspicion of
felony,? or as ? charged with felony,? or for
? having stolen goods in his possession,? or ? utter-
ing forged notes,? would be apprehended on an in-
strument having no legal validity; inasmuch as the
nature of the felony ought to be specified, and it is
no felony at all to have stolen goods in one?s posses-
sion, nor to receive stolen goods without the know-
ledge that they were stolen, nor to utter forged notes
without knowing them to have been forged. It is not
material that the offence should be stated with all
the precision requisite to support an information;
but, at least, care should be taken not to state that
which is no offence at all. A few words, however,
will suffice to give even a technical definition of the
offence, as the recent Act ?For improving the Ad-
ministration of Criminal Justice? has very much
simplified the statement of criminal offences.
In summary convictions a much greater degree of
care is requisite; and an attempt, therefore, will be
made to exemplify by supposed cases, under particular
statutes, hoAV offences in violation of them should be
charged. The Masters and Servants Act shall be
first taken, 9th Vic., No. 27 (Cal. 1572), under the
second section of which the Magistrates of this
Colony are so frequently called upon to exercise


their jurisdiction. That section enables the magis-
trate to punish, by imprisonment or forfeiture of
wages, ? any servant ? who ? shall contract with any
person whomsoever to serve him for any time or times
whatsoever, or in any manner, and shall not enter
into or commence his service according to his con-
tract (such contract being in writing ), or, having
entered into such service, shall absent himself from
his service before the term of his contract (whether
such contract be in writing or not in writing) shall
be completed, or neglect to fulfil the same, or be
guilty of disobedience, or of any other misconduct
or misdemeanour in the execution thereof, or other-
wise the same.? Two cases are provided
for by this enactment; Ist, where a servant con-
tracts in writing to serve, and does not enter upon
his service; and 2ndly, where, under a contract
either oral or in writing, he enters upon the service
and absents himself from such service.
Let it be supposed, then, that A. B. has entered
into a contract in writing to enter the service of
C. D. on the Ist February, 1852, and has neglected
to enter into such service. The conviction may be
drawn up in the following form ;
Be it remembered, that on the second day of March, in the
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two,
A. B. was committed by and before us (naming the Justices) two
(or more) of her Majesty?s Justices of the Peace duly authorised
in that behalf, for that he, the said A. 8., did, on the twentieth
day of January in the year aforesaid, at ,in the Colony of
Victoria, contract with C. D., of in the said Colony, to
serve him in the capacity and employment of a servant in hus-
bandry {or, groom, house servant, or as the case may be) at
in the Colony aforesaid, for the term of one year from the first
day of February in the year aforesaid, and for the wages of the
said contract being in writing, and signed by the said A. B. and the
said C. 8., the contracting parties; and that the said A. B. did
not at any time enter into or commence his said service, accord-
ing to the said contract; but, on the contrary, wilfully and with-
out lawful excuse, omitted to enter upon such service, contrary
to the Act of the Governor and Council of New South Wales,
passed in the ninth year of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, inti-
tuled, ?An Act to amend and consolidate the Laws between
Masters and Servants in New South Wales;? and we, the said
Justices do hereby order and adjudge the said A. 8., for the said


?offence, to be committed to and confined in (place where to be
confined) for the space of three months.
This form* follows that given by the Masters and
Servants Act, including the statement of the offence,
which is the very portion mostly misapprehended by
the Justices; and in respect of which, under the
above clause, prisoners have frequently been dis-
charged on habeas corpus. It will be observed
that the particularity of the form given consists not
only in shewing the previous existence of a written
contract signed by the contracting parties, in relation
to a service to be performed within the Colony, but
in shewing also that the servant wilfully and without
lawful excuse abstained from entering upon the ser-
vice under such contract. Where the service has
been entered upon, the blank left by the Form B,
given by the Act, may be filled up thus :
for that he, the said A. 8., on the
day of at in the Colony of Victoria, did
contract with C. D., of, &c., to enter into his service for the
period of six months from the day of
at the wages of and that the said A. B. having
entered into such service accordingly, did afterwards, to wit, on
the day of at in the said
Colony (where the said A. B. was then and there employed)
before the term of his said contract was completed, unlawfully,
and without leave of the said C. D., and without any lawful or
just excuse, absent himself from his said service, and hath from
thence neglected to fulfil his said contract, contrary, &c.
The above conviction, with an appropriate commence-
ment and conclusion, may be easily turned into a war-
rant of commitment; in which case the latter will ope-
rate as a conviction. And indeed, the warrant of com-
mitment under the act in question ought to have all
the requisites of a conviction, according to recent
cases; although, probably, the Colonial Act would
* It is not imperative to follow the form above given, inas-
much, as the 17th sect, of Jervis? Act, 11 and 12 Yic., c. 43, enacts
that, ?In all cases of conviction upon statutes hitherto passed,
whether any particular form of conviction have been there given
or not, it shall be lawful for the Justice or Justices who shall so
convict to draw up his or their conviction on parchment or
paper in some one of the forms (1,1 ?3) in the Schedule to the
Act, or to the like effect.?
H 2


come in aid of any defect in the former, which,
without such aid, would not be curable in the British
Courts.
The following cases w ill show the necessity of the
insertion of the particulars above referred to. A
return to a habeas corpus ad subjiciendum set forth a
document being a conviction and committal under
stat. 4 G. 4, c. 34, s. 3, which recited an informa-
tion and complaint by the agent of D, that the pri-
soner had contracted to serve D for a term, and did,
before the contract w?as completed, ? absent himself
from his service , and did thereby , then , and there ,
neglect to fulfil the same , contrary to the form of the
statute ,? &c. And the document added; therefore,
? it manifestly appearing to me? (the Justice) that
the prisoner ? is guilty of the said offence charged
upon him in the said information and complaint, I
do hereby convict him of the offence aforesaid: and
I do hereby order and adjudge that ? the prisoner,
? for the offence aforesaid, be imprisoned,? &c.
Upon motion to discharge the prisoner, it was held
that the information shewed no offence, as there
might be some lawful excuse for the absence, though
the statute simply makes the party?s absenting him-
self from service the ground of complaint; and that
the conviction therefore w T as bad. ? The information,?
said Patteson, J,, ? does add that the prisoner did,
by absenting himself from service, thereby neglect
to fulfil the same,? contrary to the statute ; but that
is not a direct charge ; it is only an inference from
what precedes; if the absenting does not constitute
an offence as laid, the inference is not warranted. It
therefore comes to this, ?whether it is necessary to
negative lawful excuse. I think it is, and that the
absence must be shewn to be wilful, or without lawful
excuse. As this information is framed, it would
have been proved by shewing that the prisoner had
stayed away because he had broken his leg.?
In Lindsay v. Leigh , 11 Q. 8., 455, an action of
trespass for false imprisonment w T as brought against
a Magistrate for committing the plaintiff (a collier)
to prison, under a warrant which alleged that the


latter had been guilty of divers misdemeanours, par-
ticularly that he had absented himself from the
service of his master before the term of his contract
with them was completed, contrary to the form of
the statute, &c. The plaintiff succeeded in obtain-
ing a verdict in his favour, it being held that the
legality of the imprisonment depended upon the suf-
ficiency of the commitment alone, and that this
being in the nature of a conviction was bad, for not
averring either that the contract was in writing, or
else that the service had been entered upon. ? Every
instrument,? said Parke 8., in delivering the judg-
ment of the Court, ? which is to affect a man?s
liberty or property out of the course of the common
law ought, on the face of it, to shew the authority
sufficiently ; and I think this would not. Ido not
consider it necessary to say whether the objection is
well founded, which appears to have prevailed in
Seth Turner's case to a similar warrant, viz., that it
does not state that the plaintiff ? absented himself
without lawful excuse because I think that the com-
mitment is invalid, as it does not bring the case
within the statute 4 G. 4, c. 34, by the averment
either that the contract to serve was in writing or
that the service was entered upon, one of those two
ingredients being essential to give the Magistrate
jurisdiction to commit to hard labour.?
In Joseph Askew's Case, 2 L. M. & P. 429 (June,
1851) a prisoner was brought up on Habeas Corpus,
and discharged on a warrant in the following form:?
?Whereas complaint,? &c., ?hath been made
by,? &c. ? agent for Thomas Mayer, John Mayer,
and Joseph Mayer, potters,? &c. that Joseph Askew,
late of Longport, in the county of Stafford, hath
contracted with the said Thomas Mayer,? &c., ? to
serve them as their servant, in the business of pot-
ters, at the parish of Burslem, in the said county,
for a certain time, to wit, for the term of one year,
to commence from the 11th day of November last,
and that the term of his contract being unexpired,
the said Joseph Askew did, on the 2nd day of June
instant, unlawfully misdemean and misconduct him-


self in his said service by neglecting and absenting
himself from his said masters service, without the
leave of his said masters, and without assigning any
sufficient reason for so doing, contrary to the pro-
visions of the statute in such case made and pro-
vided,? the warrant then proceeded to adjudicate in
the words of the complaint, and ordered him to be
committed for one calendar month, with hard labour.
Pashley , as counsel in support of the commitment,
argued as follows;?? Lindsay v. Leigh is certainly
an authority that a warrant under sect. 8 of the 4
Geo. 4, c. 34, whether it is to be looked upon as an
order or as a conviction, ?is bad, unless it aver
either that the contract was in writing, or that the
service had been entered upon. In the present-
case, however, the warrant sufficiently shews that
the service had been entered upon; for it states that
he unlawfully misconducted himself ? in his said
service,? by ? absenting himself from his said
master?s service,? and he could not have been guilty
of misconduct ?in his said service? unless he had
entered upon the service. Without relying on the
allegation that he did so ? unlawfully? and ? con-
trary to the provisions of the statute in such case
made and providedwhich if the instrument were
to be construed as an order might, as has been held
in some instances, supply defects in form?this
warrant is distinguishable from that which was held
bad in Lindsay v. Leigh , as it gives the date of the
contract, and therefore sufficiently shows that the
offence was committed during the term for which he
contracted. At any rate, if the Court entertain any
reasonable doubt as to the sufficiency of the warrant,
they will leave the defendant to his remedy by
action.?
Wightman , J., however, said he could not distin-
guish the case from Lindsay v. Leigh. ? The
Judge?s warrant,? he observed, ? does not state
either that he contracted in writing, or that he
entered upon his service ; but only that he had con-
tracted to serve, without stating that he had pre-
viously entered upon it. It is said, however, that,
cx vi termini, he must be taken to have previously


entered upon such service, before he could properly
be said to have absented himself from it. Ido not
see that there is any necessary implication to be
drawn from these words, and the statute seems to
shew that there is not; for it says ?or having entered
into such service shall absent himself from it before
the term of his contract shall be completed. ?
The Masters and Servants Act, 9 Vie. No. 27,
has been recently amended by an Act passed by the
Legislature of Victoria, and its duration prolonged
until the 31st December, 1854. The amendments
have extended the amount of wages recoverable under
it, from �3O to �SO, and instead of postponing the
enforcement of compliance with any order, convic-
tion, or award for the payment of wages, fines, or
penalties, has made them enforceable forthwith. By
the 23rd section of the 9 Vic. No. 27, all fines or
penalties are to be paid to the Colonial Treasurer,
but it is not now necessary to direct any specific
appropriation of fines, &c., either under this or any
other act passed previously to Jervis? Act, 11 &
12 Vic. c. 43. This was decided by the Court of
Queen?s Bench, in January 1852, in Reg. v. Hyde ,
Law Term Rep. vol. 18, p. 223, where it was held
that a conviction for a penalty, and in default,
imprisonment, is good in the form given in the Sche ?
dule Ito 11 & 12 Vic. c. 43, directing the penalty
to be paid and applied according to law, even though
the statute creating the offence imposes upon the
convicting Justices the duty of distributing the
penalty. The ?form,? said Patteson , J., ?in
statute 11 & 12 Vic. c. 43, which is here adopted,
applies to all cases where under previous statutes an
offence is created punishable upon summary convic-
tion before Justices ?by a penalty, and in default
of payment, by imprisonment.? ? And per Cole-
ridge, J., ?I should have felt some difficulty if this
case had stood upon the two statutes 1 & 2, Will. 4,
c. 32, and 5& 6 Vic. 4, c. 20; but I think the ob-
jection is conclusively answered by sec. 17 of stat.
11 & 12 Vic. c. 43, and the Schedule I. 1, 2, 3.
That Act reduces all convictions under earlier
statutes into three heads, the second of which is that


to which this conviction belongs, and the statute
makes these forms available ? in all cases of con-
viction upon statutes hitherto passed.? It may turn
out, that in consequence of this, some particular cir-
cumstances upon which the Act constituting the
offence requires an adjudication will not appear in
the form of conviction ; but the legislature thought
it better to be content with general forms than to
incur the risk of minute and technical objections.
No one can suppose that defendants practically suf-
fer any real hardship, or are imprisoned from not
knowing to whom to pay the penalty,?
The Licensed Publican?s Act, 13 Vic., No 29
(Cal. 2007) is another Act, as to which some
suggestions may be useful. A form of conviction
(Schedule II) is given by the Act, which, if fol-
lowed, will be sufficient in other respects if the
offence be properly stated. Supposing A. 8., a
keeper of an eating house, to be convicted under the
37th section, for permitting drunkenness and other
disorderly conduct in his house, the offence should
be th is stated :
For that he, the said A. 8., on the day of
at in the Colony of Victoria, being then and there
the keeper of a public eating house and premises there situate,
wherein refreshments were then being sold and consumed, did
wilfully [or knowingly] permit drunkenness and other disorderly
conduct* in his said house and premises there situate, against the
form of the Act of Council in that case made and provided.
If the charge relate only to disorderly conduct, it
may run thus :
Did wilfully permit disorderly conduct in his said house and
premises, by then and there suffering persons, to the number of
twelve and more, to remain fighting, drinking, and making a
great noise and disturbance there, [or as the case may le,~\ at a
late hour of the night, to wit, at one o?clock, against, &o.
If the charge be for suffering unlawful games,
thus;?
? It was decided in Wray v. Too he, 12 Q. B. 492, that this
mode of stating the offence is sufficient. See also this case as
shewing how a previous offence should be stated.


Did knowingly suffer a certain unlawful game, to wit, an un-
lawful game of rouge et noir [or hazard] to be played by one
E. F. and G. H. and several other persons unknown [or by
several persons unknown] in his said house and premises,
against, &c.
Or for suffering any gaming whatsoever, thus :
Did knowingly suffer gaming in his said house and premises,
by then and there permitting one E. E. and G. H. [or several
persons unknown 1 to play [for money, or ale, or spirituous
liquors, if the case J at cards [or as the case may be], against, &c.
Or for permitting persons of notoriously bad cha-
racter to meet together, &c., thus: ?
Did knowingly permit [or suffer] one E. E., one F. G., and
other persons, the said E. E., E. G., and the said other persons
there, being persons of notoriously bad character, [or knowingly
permit persons of notoriously bad character] to meet together
in his said house and premises, and remain therein for a long
space of time, to wit, the space of [as the case may be], against,
&c.
Under the second section for selling without a
license, the offence may be stated thus: ?
Did, on, &c., at, &c., in the Colony of Victoria, sell [or barter,
exchange, or for valuable consideration dispose of] to one E. E.,
[or to some person unknown], [or did permit, or suffer, to be
sold, or bartered, &c.,] in the said house [or place] then and
there situate, a certain quantity of spirituous liquors, to wit 5
one pint of gin, he, the said A. 8., not being then and there duly
licensed so to do, and not being then and there the heir, execu-
tor, administrator, or assignee of any person duly licensed so to
do, against, &c.
A few forms will be found useful under the
Vagrant Act, 15 Vic., No. 4 (Cal. 2,541). It is
true that the 15th section of the Act enacts that
?in every conviction for an offence contrary
thereto, it shall he sufficient if the offence shall be
stated in the words thereof, declaring any offence or
attaching any penalty thereto.? The form, how-
ever, given by the same section seems to require
something more than the statement of a conviction
in the words of the Act. The form is as follows: ?


Be it remembered, that on the day of
A- D. 18 at . in the Colony of New South
Wales, A. B. is convicted before me, C. D., one of Her Majesty?s
Justices of the Peace in and for the said Colony, of [here state
the offence, in the words of this Act], within the intent and
meaning of the Act of the Governor and Legislative Council,
passed in the fifteenth year of the reign of her Majesty Queen
Victoria, intituled, ? An Act for the more effectual Prevention of
Vagrancy, and for the Punishment of idle and disorderly Persons ,
Pogues and Vagabonds, and incorrigible Rogues, in the Colony of
New South Wales; that is to say, for that he, the said A. 8., on
th� day of at in the said Colony,
[here state the offence proved before the Magistrate,] and for
which said offence the said A. B. is ordered to be committed to
Her Majesty?s Gaol at [or house of correction] there
to be kept to hard labour for the space of [or until
the next Quarter Sessions to be holden at ].
Given under my hand and seal the day, year, and at the place
first above written.
This is not very intelligible; for it either requires
the offence to he stated twice over, or makes a dis-
tinction between the offence of which the party w r as
convicted, and the offence proved before the Magis-
trate. Independently, therefore, of the general rule
of law upon the subject, it will not be safe to state
?the offence proved before the Magistrate? in so
compendious a form as would satisfy the previous
direction to state it ? in the words of the Act,? A
few forms, therefore, will be given, applicable to that
part of the third section which enacts that ? every
person having in his or her custody or possession any
picklock, key, crow,jack, bit, or other implement, with
intent feloniously to break into any dwelling house,
warehouse, coach house, stable, or outbuilding, or
being armed with any gun, pistol, hanger, cutlass,
bludgeon, or other offensive weapon, or having upon
him or her any instrument with intent to commit
any felonious act, every person being found in or
upon any dwelling house, warehouse, coach house,
stable, or outhouse, or in any enclosed yard, garden,
or area, or being found in or on board any ship or
other vessel, when lying or being in any port, har-
bour, or place within this Colony, for any unlawful
purpose, every suspected person or reputed thief fre-
quenting any river, canal, or navigable stream, dock,


or basin, or any quay, wharf, or warehouse near or
adjoining thereto, or any street; highway, or avenue
leading thereto, or any place of public resort, or any
avenue leading thereto, or any street, highway, or
place adjacent, with intent to commit felony, and
every person apprehended as an idle and disorderly
person, and violently resisting any constable or other
peace officer so apprehending him or her, and being
subsequently convicted of the offence for which he
or she shall have been so apprehended, shall be
deemed a rogue and vagabond, within the true intent
and meaning of this Act.?
Supposing a party to have been convicted of any
of the above offences, or indeed of any offence under
the Act, and the form given by the Act to be pur-
sued, it is suggested that the first part be filled up
not by stating the offence ? in the words of the Act,?
but by simply inserting instead, the words ?the
offence hereinafter mentioned ; for it is not imperative
that the exact form given should be followed ; and
not stating the offence until the subsequent part.
For instance, as regards the offence of having pick-
locks, &c., with intent, &c., it may be thus stated,
after the words ? in the said Colony? :
Unlawfully had in his custody [or possession], to wit, in his?
[and if so, add, at the time of his being then and there appre-
hended by one C. I).] a certain picklock [or key, crow, jack, bit,
or instrument, to wit, a knife] with intent then and there felo-
niously to break into a certain dwelling house [or warehouse,
coach house, stable, or outbuilding, to wit, a ], then being,
in the occupation of one E. E., against the provisions of the said
Act of Council.
When party armed with gun , with intent , fc.,
the following form; ?
Was unlawfully armed with a certain offensive weapon, to wit,
a gun, [or pistol, hanger, cutlass, bludgeon] with intent then
and there feloniously to steal, take, and carry away the goods and
chattels of one E. E., then and there being, against, &c.
For being on premises for an unlawful purpose, the
following form: ?


Was found in and upon a certain enclosed yard [or garden,
or dwelling house, warehouse, coach house, stable, or outhouse,
to wit, a ], then in the occupation of one C. D., for a certain
unlawful purpose, to wit, [describe it as, ?to steal, take
and carry away apples, or potatoes, then and there growing, or
feloniously so steal, take, and carry away certain fowls, to wit,
two fowls, or a certain coat, or harness, saddle, or as the case may
io], the property of the said C. D., then and there being,
against, &c.
Reputed thieves, frequenting public places with
intent, &c. :
There being a suspected person, or reputed thief, did then and
there frequent a certain river [or canal, or navigable stream,
dock, basin, or quay, or a certain wharf, or warehouse near, or
adjoining to a certain river, &c.; or a certain street, or highway,
or avenue leading to a certain street or highway, or a certain
place of public resort called ] there situate with intent, the
goods and chattels of a certain person unknown [or of one C. D.
taen and there being,] then and there feloniously to steal, take,
and carry away, against, &c.
Resisting apprehension
Did violently resist one C. D., a constable of the said
who was then and there apprehending him, by virtue of the Act
of Council in that behalf, as an idle and disorderly person, for
that he the said A. 8., theretofore, to wit, on the
*tey test, at, &c., [here state the 'particular offence
in respect of which the defendant was convicted of being an idle
and disorderly person ] and of which said offence the said A. B.
was subsequently, to wit, on the day of
instant, convicted before J. S., Esq., one of Her Majesty?s Jus-
tices of the Peace in and for, &c., against, &c.
In reference to the Vagrant Act, a question on
the construction of the English Act, 5 G. 3, c. 83,
s. 4, was decided in Re John Brown , 18 Law T.
Rep. 238. That Act (and the 3rd section of the
Colonial Act, 10 Vic., No. 4, is in this respect
similar) makes any reputed thief found frequenting
inter alia , a highway , with intent to commit a felony,
punishable as a rogue and vagabond. The Court
were not unanimous upon the point, but the majority
of the Judges, of whom Lord Campbell was one,
held that this meant any highway , and not merely a
highway connected with the other places specified in


the section All the judges, however, concurred in
holding that in a conviction under this section it
was not necessary to allege that the defendant fre-
quented the highway with intent to commit a felony
there.
The Summary Ejectment Act is one which is fre-
quently resorted to in this Colony, and especially
under its present circumstances, when the relation of
landlord and tenant, so far as the amount of rent is
concerned, can be formed upon no permanent basis.
The Colonial Act, 11 Yic., No. 2 (Cal. 1780), is a
transcript of the Imperial Statute, 1 & 2 Yic., c.
74 ; with this difference, that the operation of the
latter is limited to cases where the terra does not
exceed seven years, and the rent is not beyond �2O,
whereas in the former there is no such limitation.
The forms of notice, complaint, and warrant, are
given by the Act. The jurisdiction of the Magis-
trates exists in all cases where the holding of the
tenant sought to be ejected has ended, or been ? duly
determined by a legal notice to quit or otherwise .?
The words ? or otherwise ? have given rise to doubts
whether the Act applied in a case of forfeiture, or
breach of covenant by which, according to stipula-
tion, the lease was to be rendered void. The ex-
press point was raised but not decided in the case of
Ex parte Gray v. Rodd and others , before the Su-
preme Court of New South Wales. The case is
thus reported in the Sydney Morning Herald : ?
EX PARTE GRAY V. EODD AND OTHERS.
This was a rule nisi for a prohibition, granted under the fol-
lowing circumstances. It appeared that Gray had obtained a
piece of land from one Curran, on a building lease; the lease
of land was of four years duration. The tenant was to build a
house of a certain description within the first year thereof; fail-
ing that, the landlord had a most absolute power of re-entry.
It being alleged that Gray had broken the covenant ?s to build-
ing the house of a certain description, an application had been
made before the defendants, Magistrates, to grant a warrant to
give the landlord possession under the Act to facilitate the reco-
very of Possession of Tenements after the due determination of
the Tenancy. The matter was heard, and a warrant to give
possession was issued. To prevent the execution of that warrant,
on a former day, a rule nisi was obtained for a prohibition.


The Solicitor General'iiow moved that the rule be made
absolute.
Mr. Darvall showed cause. He contended that the Magis-
trates had jurisdiction, and could only have entertained the
question and arrived at the decision they did. The Colonial Act
was almost a transcript of an English statute; except that the
Colonial Act gave jurisdiction in all cases, no matter what the
term of the lease or rent might be. The object of the English Act
was clearly upon default, where ejectment would lie, to give the
landlord an easy remedy of getting possession, without resorting
to the expensive remedy of ejectment. The language of the
first section of the Colonial Act was large enough to comprehend
this case. The material words were, ? when and so soon as the
term or interest of any tenant of any house, &c., held by
him shall have ended, or shall have been duly determined by a
legal notice to quit, or otherwise. 55 Again, the Justices, upon
proof ? of the holding, and of the end or other determination of
the tenancy, with the time or manner thereof, 55 &c., may issue a
warrant, &c. It was clear from the above words, and other
words throughout the rest of the Act, that the Act was to apply
in every case of default by a tenant which would be a good
foundation for an ejectment. Here, clearly, as against the
tenant, by not building the house according to the specified des-
cription, an action of ejectment would lie, at the suit of the
landlord. It might be that the Colonial Legislature did not
intend the law to apply to a case of this kind, but having
used words that would include the case, the Court must give
effect to them. No good reason, indeed, could be advanced why
the Magistrates should not have such a jurisdiction.
The Solicitor General replied: He said, the Act in ques-
tion must be strictly construed on the well known principle,
that it is in derogation of the common law; for by it a summary
jurisdiction was given to the Magistrate. Construing it by this
principle, it was manifest ?regarding, too, the whole terms of the
Act ?it was only intended to give an executive power to Magis-
trates in all cases where the determination of the tenancy was
plain and indisputable, and they were not to decide a question
of determination where a difficult question of fact or law would
arise ; which would and must arise, when it became a question
whether a certain covenant had been complied with or not. He
contended that the words ?or otherwise, 55 so much relied on by
the other side, could not be held to apply to a case of this kind
Lastly, he contended that here there had been no determination
of the tenancy, inasmuch as on the failing of the condition of the
lease, the landlord had not re-entered; so, on this ground, the
Magistrates had no jurisdiction in the matter, supposing even
the kind of tenancy camejwithin the principle of the tenancies
contemplated by this Act.


His Honor the Chief Justice delivered the judgment of the
Court. He said, one question here was, whether the Magis-
trates had had jurisdiction over the subject matter of complaint
before them. The Act in question gives the Magistrates a pecu-
liar power or jurisdiction : it is not a summary jurisdiction, hut
authorises them to adopt peculiar proceedings, the determina-
tion?of which by them is not to be final. It is clear, from the
proviso of the first section, and from the language of the third
section if the Magistrates should act, this would be no protec-
tion to the landlord. It might be conceded, said his Honor, here
there was a right of possession; but the question remained, was
there a determination of the tenancy ? It did not appear on the
affidavits that the landlord had entered on the lan I upon failure
of the condition : it was not alleged that he did enter. As there
had been no entry with a view to determine the tenancy, the
tenancy existed in full force to this present time. Without a
determination of the tenancy, the Magistrates could have no
jurisdiction under the Act. As to the other question raised, viz.,
whether, supposing the tenancy was determined, and was void
by reason of the covenant not having been complied with, the
Magistrate had jurisdiction over it, it was a difficult question,
and one the Court would not offer any opinion on, as it would
be extra judicial to do so. The writ of prohibition would go,
but without costs.
It would be improper for the compiler of these Doe d Car
pages to offer any opinion upon the point left unde- �?? Hoe,
cided in the above case ; but if the question should 540 ; iW?d.
ever be raised in this Colony, the following authori- R o n e dal 2 !' B .
ties will be found deserving of perusal : ?Doe d. g o^ d d > 922;
Cardigan v. Roe , 1 D. and R. 540; Doe d. Tindal day�. sharpl

PART XI.
In this part, some few matters, which have been left
for the closing pages, will be supplied. It was sug-
gested (ante page 54), that all the proceedings
before Magistrates in their summary jurisdiction
should be recorded in a book; bnt in whatsoever way
they arc recorded, the following form is recom-
mended :
C. D. AGAINST A. B.

Before and Esquires.
The defendant appeared on a [warrant] granted by
Esquire, charging him with assaulting and beating, at L., on the

to he recovered by distress , and in default one calendar month s
imprisonment with hard labour, unless sooner paid, with costs
of distress and conveyance to gaol.


A form of the minute of order for service under
eec - 17 of 11 &12 Vic. c. 43 (referred to ante 58),
has~already been given (ante page 54), where the
adjudication was the dismissal of the complaint.
Where imprisonment only is adjudged, the same
form will suffice as far as the words, ? It is adjudged
and ordered,? and then as follows ;
That the said A. 8., who does [not] appear, do [here state the
matter shortly required to be done ] forthwith [or on or before
day of ,] and on disobedience to be
imprisoned, with hard labour, for and to pay to the
said 0. D. for costs; and in default of distress for that
sum, the said A. B. to be imprisoned for an additional term of
unless sooner paid.
Where a sum of money is adjudicated, the minute
will be as follows :
That the said A. 8., who does [not'] appear, shall forthwith

said C. D. the sum of , and also for costs
[to he recovered by distress], and in default the said A. B. to be
imprisoned with hard labour for , unless sooner paid,
with the costs of [distress and] conveyance to gaol.
The following forms, as well as those given in the
previous pages are not in Jervis?s Acts, but they
will be found, nevertheless, necessary to be used
when the circumstances arise to which they apply.

J. S. (L. S.)
The following cases, relative to the summary juris-
diction of Magistrates have been decided in the
Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District
of Port Phillip: ?Ex 'parte Kearey and Evelyn
Shadforth?s Judgments for 1849, p. 49, deciding
that upon a party being committed to gaol for not
paying a fine under the 2 Vic., No. 2, sec. 40, it
should appear on the warrant that there has been a
default in payment, or an ineffectual distress to
obtain it. A similar decision was given in the same
volume, p. 52, in Wilson?s case, where a party had
been committed under the 74 th section of the licensed
Publican?s Act. In Jenning?s case (p. 4) it was
decided that a warrant of commitment under 9th
G. 4, c. 31, sec. 27 (Cal. 827), need not state the
application of the fine, and that alterations in
the copy of a commitment cannot be made the
ground of objection to the commitment itself. La


the same volume, Re Riddle and Payne , p. 44, the
digest of the decision is as follows:?? Under the
Summary Ejectment Act, 11 Vic., No. 2, A by his
attorney applied for a warrant to eject B, the alleged
tenant of A. Nobody appearing on the part of B
the Justices said, after hearing the case, they would
order a warrant to issue ; but in consequence of cer-
tain information subsequently made to them, they
declined to sign the warrant, but offered to re-hear
the case, and appointed a day for that purpose. A
mandamus, under the circumstances, to command the
Justices to issue a warrant, was refused.?
In the Queen v. Halley , (Judgments for 1850, p.
14), it was decided that a commitment in execution
under the 69th section of the 18 fic., No. 29, (the
Licensed Publicans Act,) for the amount of penalty
and costs as thereby authorised, after no goods found
oil levy, is bad, if it includes the five shillings men-
tioned in the section for the expenses of distress.
In the same volume, p. 15, in Hxparte Copeland , it
was decided that under the 18th section of the same
Act, the licensing Justices are at liberty in all cases
to grant or refuse a license, according to their own
discretion. As to their obligation to hear evidence
on facts within their own knowledge, the Resident
Judge thus expressed himself:??l need not deter-
mine whether the Justices ought or ought not to
have evidence on oath given of objections emanating
from themselves. Certainly, they have a right to
act upon such objections, and many can be imagined
which could not very well be made the subject of
proof. The object of the 18th section was to pre-
vent clandestine information operating to the preju-
dice of the applicants, and in order to enable them
to meet by evidence any objection which might be
raised against them. Li the present case, it does
not appear how the Justices obtained their informa-
tion ; and all I will say on this point is, that though
I consider them at perfect liberty to act upon their
own knowledge, and upon the information of others
when they can rely on it; yet I think it would be
more in accordance with the spirit of the Act, when
particular facts , and not mere matters of opinion,


are the ground of their objection, that they should,
if possible, require them to be proved before them,
or give the applicant an opportunity of denying
them.?
In the same volume (p. 39 ?43), a conviction is
set out {Ex parte Halley $ Hughes ), also under the
13 Yic., No. 22, which was held valid, upon the
general principle, that the Court will intend every-
thing in favour of a good conviction which is not
inconsistent with the terms of the commitment.
