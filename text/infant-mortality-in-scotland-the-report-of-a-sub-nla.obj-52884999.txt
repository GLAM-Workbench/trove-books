INFANT MORTALITY
IN SCOTLAND
FOREWORD
/ | 'HE conclusions—perhaps still more, the implications—of this momentous
-*■ Report, should be drawn to the attention of every Scotsman and
Scotswoman.
Most of the facts and figures, and particularly the figures showing that our
Infant Mortality rate is 40 per cent, worse than England’s and is higher than
the rate in any British Dominion or the U.S.A., higher than in Dire, higher than
in any nation in Western Europe except Spain and Portugal—these figures
have already been the subject of anxious comment.
But here for the first time all the known comparisons are carefully mar-
shalled and a medical committee of great experience and authority, under the
chairmanship of one of the leading nutritional scientists of our time, has
diagnosed the cause or causes of the lamentable place Scotland takes among the
great nations in the saving of infant life.
Our infant mortality compares badly with England’s ; but it is not without
significance that so, year after year, do our unemployed figures and our per-
centage of overcrowded houses. These have been the chief blots upon our social
arrangements in the past and they have been productive of the most part of
the poverty evils from which we have suffered. It is interesting to note that
the industrial town of Falkirk, which has the smallest unemployment among
the large burghs, has one of the smallest rates of infant mortality.
We are seeking through the Council of Industry and by other means to
find employment for larger proportions of our fellow-citizens, and we are
planning tremendous housing developments. But remedies and alleviations
must be found for our infant mortality position in the immediate post-war
years. They can be found and applied by Local Authorities, Medical Practi-
tioners and Associations of men and women of goodwill, and to them all I
commend an earnest study of this Report.

INTRODUCTION
IN accordance with our instructions we have made an investigation into the
causes of the high infant death rate in Scotland. For reasons which will
become apparent in the course of this study we consider that, to get a true
picture of the total loss of infant life, it is necessary to include stillbirths within
the scope of our investigation.
The Committee has confined its attention to pre-war conditions, except in
the discussion of stillbirths in Scotland, where it was necessary to take into
account the statistics for the years 1939 to 1941. The reasons governing this
decision were that there is little published information for the war years ; that
the most important environmental conditions, diet, housing, employment and
medical services, are highly abnormal in most areas; and it is impossible to
judge to what extent any of the changes which have occurred since the end of
1939 are likely to be permanent.
The Infant Mortality Bate is the number of registered deaths of infants
under the age of twelve months during any year per 1,000 live births registered
during the same year.
The Neonatal Mortality Rate is the number of registered deaths under
one month of age per 1,000 live births registered during the same year.
The Stillbirth Bate is the number of stillbirths registered during the
year per 1,000 live and stillbirths registered during the same year. The defini-
tion of a stillbirth is “ any child which has issued forth from its mother after
the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after
being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show any other signs of
life.”
Prematurity : In 1938, a joint committee of the Royal College of Phy-
sicians of London and the British College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
adopted the following standard of prematurity :
“ That in conformity with the standard in international use an infant
whose birth-weight is 5| lb. (approximately 2,500 grammes) or less shall
be considered, for the purpose of comparison of records, as either im-
mature or prematurely bom, according as the estimated period of
gestation is full time or less.”
The task of preparing this Report has been made less easy because official
statistics generally provide information only on the more obvious aspects of
infant mortality and the statistics for Scotland provide even less information
than is available for England and Wales and some other countries. Further,
the customs governing registration of birth, and the definitions of stillbirth and
modes of expressing mortality rates, differ in many countries from established
practice here. The international comparisons made in the Report are therefore
not, in all cases, strictly accurate but the errors involved are small in relation
to the magnitude of the differences shown.
Our thanks are due to the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Labour
and National Service for information on unemployment; the Registrar-General
for Scotland for permission to quote from the Annual Report for 1939 and for
information on the Vital Statistics of the Netherlands ; the Ministry of Health
for statistics ; the Registrar-General for England and Wales for unpublished
statistics. The figures quoted for years since 1938 are provisional and subject
to adjustment.
We have to thank Miss Katherine Lenroot, Director, and Miss Marian Crane,
Assistant Director, of the Children’s Bureau, U.S. Department of Labor,
Washington, for the account of maternity and child welfare services, printed as
Appendix 3, and for informative literature; Dr. Hermann N. Bundesen,
President of the Board of Health, Chicago, for descriptive reports; Dr.


Rowland Wilson, Department of Labour and National Service, Australia,
and Dr. H. Watt, Director-General of Health, New Zealand, for specially-
prepared accounts of conditions in Australia and New Zealand which, we regret,
were received when this report was already in the press and too late for
inclusion.
We also wish to express our appreciation of the work of the Secretary, Mr.
J. B. Swan, whose efficient help has contributed greatly to the success of the
work of the Committee, and our thanks to other officials of the Department of
Health for Scotland for their assistance.
SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE
THE evidence presented applies almost entirely, except for Part 11, Still-
births, to conditions up to 1939.
Part I.—The Mortality of Live-Bom Infants
Scotland has the highest infant mortality rate of seventeen countries,
including the Dominions, the United States of America and all the countries
of Western Europe, except Spain and Portugal.
The problem of this high mortality has been analysed in two parts : deaths
under one month of age (neonatal mortality) and deaths between one month
and twelve months. To bear comparison with New Zealand or Holland,
Scotland would have to reduce neonatal mortality by 30 per cent., and mortality
between one and twelve months by 75 per cent. It is therefore obvious that
success is more likely to follow quickly on efforts to improve the latter than
the former. The saving of lives by these reductions would be 3,640 annually.
Comparison of the death rates in different areas shows that there is, in
Scotland, a general heaping up of adverse conditions contributing to high
infant mortality, affecting both rural and urban areas, greatest in the West
Central (urban) and North East (rural) areas.
Study of the causes of death shows that prematurity and deaths ascribed
to “ congenital debility ” are mainly responsible for the excess mortality in
the first month. The causes are therefore mainly operative before birth, but
some reduction could be effected by improving nurseries and nursery staffing
in maternity hospitals so that premature and sick babies can be isolated, and
neonatal infection brought under stricter control.
The excess between one and twelve months is due chiefly to infectious
diseases. To understand this finding, it is necessary to appreciate the nature
of the adverse environmental conditions contributing to the high incidence of,
and mortality from, infections.
These are in the main poverty, faulty feeding and poor housing. In Scotland,
as compared with England and Wales, the percentage of unemployment is
higher, the proportion of people living in poverty twice as high and the per-
centage of overcrowding six times as great. In addition, especially in the in-
dustrial belt, severe winter conditions influence child life adversely and tend
to increase the severity of the commoner infectious diseases of children.
The birth rate among the Scottish poor is at a high level such as is desired
for the whole population. Families are therefore larger. This in itself increases
poverty since wages are not adjusted to the size of the family. But the ex-
perience of New Zealand and Holland shows that a high birth rate need not
be accompanied by a high infant death rate.
Fart n.—Stillbirths
The excess of stillbirths in Scotland is as great as the excess of neonatal
deaths.


Examination of the causes of stillbirth shows that about two-thirds are
referable to antenatal conditions, i.e. to poor physique and poor health of the
mothers, and only one-third to the hazards of birth.
A review of data suggests that improvement in obstetrical practice should
reduce the stillbirth rate in Scotland from 42 (in 1939) to about 33, and that
extended and improved antenatal medical supervision should reduce it still
further and certainly to less than 30. But the basic rate attainable under the
best conditions, where housing and diet, as well as obstetrics and antenatal
care, are good, is of the order of 11 per 1,000 total births.
Reduction of stillbirths to the level in Holland would save 1,570 lives
annually. This, taken with the possible saving of live-bom infants, represents
a toted saving of 5,210 lives.
Part m.—The Feeding of Mothers and Infants
Working-class mothers are often underfed and their diets are of poor
quality, deficient in materials for bone and blood formation and in vitamins
needed for health. Such diets are important causes of poor physique and
maternal ill health, premature birth, low vitality of the infant at birth and
inability of the mother to suckle and care for her child.
It is considered of first importance that infants should be breast fed. To
produce a sufficient quantity of milk of high quality, the mothers must be
well fed. Evidence is presented which suggests that, on account of the high
incidence of poverty and poor diets in Scotland, there may be a high pro-
portion of unsatisfactory and short lactations.
Human milk is of special importance to the premature infant, but there is
no organised breast milk service in Scotland.
The incidence of underfeeding and of malnutrition is high in bottle-fed
babies. After weaning, underfeeding and poor diets, lacking sufficient milk
and protective foods, are common in poor families. In both bottle-fed and
weaned infants, the resulting malnutrition lowers resistance to disease and,
taken with the excess exposure to infection due to bad housing and overcrowd-
ing, explains the high mortality from infections in Scottish infants.
Part IV.—'The Medical Services
Scotland has lagged behind in the provision of maternity and child welfare
services. Clinic premises are often poor, ill-equipped and overcrowded.
Nutritional supervision is inadequate. Liaison between the hospitals, the
family doctors and the child welfare service is poor.
Health visitors have usually much larger districts than they can efficiently
manage.
Powers to supply extra food and domestic help are not sufficiently used by
Local Authorities.
The maternity bed accommodation in Scotland is inadequate and voluntary
hospitals in particular are overcrowded. There should be so many beds that
all first births and all mothers with known disabilities and from poor houses
could be admitted to hospital. Three times the number of beds available in
1937 are required, and this would represent only the minimum desirable.
The rules laid down by the General Medical Council and the Central Midwives
Boards for the training of doctors, midwives and maternity nurses in obstetrics
and the care of infants are satisfactory but they are not complied with, and the
training is therefore inadequate. Insufficient attention is paid to the teaching
of children’s diseases and the principles of child health, and to the teaching of
the principles of nutrition or their clinical application. Trained experts are
required in all the maternity and child welfare services for supervision, con-
sultation and advice in both of these subjects.
For such training there are not enough teachers and suitable teaching units
do not exist.


RECOMMENDATIONS
THE Committee desires first to record its conviction that infant mortality
in Scotland is high because a large part of the population, both in towns
and rural areas, lives under poor housing conditions and in poverty. Unemploy-
ment has, in the past, seriously aggravated the problem, and recurrence of
unemployment on any large scale would add greatly to the difficulty of its
solution. There is little use of health education if the principles cannot be
practised.
The Committee therefore makes the following recommendations :
1. Housing
No other measure taken to safeguard the health of infants is likely to
have its full effect unless, at the same time, housing is improved. In Scotland
the housing position is so bad that it cannot wait on formal town planning.
There should be a temporary housing scheme to take the people out of the
congested areas. ■
2. Food
The Committee notes with satisfaction that the Government has accepted
the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Food and Agri-
culture at Hot Springs, Virginia, 1943, and undertaken the task “ of increasing
the food resources and improving the diets of their people in accordance
with the principles and objectives outlined in the findings of the Confer-
ence. ...” The Committee recognises that it will not, at once, be possible
to bring a diet, adequate for health, within the reach of every family. Much
has already been done to improve the health of mothers and infants by the
special measures taken by the Ministry of Food. Until the recommendations
of the Hot Springs Conference have been implemented, these measures should
be continued and extended as far as food resources permit.
3. Child Welfare Services
The child welfare services should be extended and improved. Education
of mothers in infant feeding and domestic hygiene is of paramount importance
and is the primary function of the service. The health visitor carries into the
homes of the people the teaching of the medical staff at the welfare centre
and her chief care is the health of the young child. Her training should be
still further improved in the principles of mother and child care. The number
of families for which a health visitor is responsible should be limited, and no
health visitor wholly engaged in maternity and child welfare work should be
responsible for the care of more than 500 children under five years of age. This
is especially important as there is widespread ignorance of simple rules of
hygiene and principles of dietetics amongst the masses in our large cities.
The medical staff should be more highly trained, especially in the principles
of child health and nutrition. Their work should not be confined to child
welfare clinics but they should be available for home visiting. They should
be associated with hospitals caring for sick children and the work of the welfare
centres and hospitals should be integrated.
Powers to provide home helps exist but are not sufficiently used. A greatly
increased service of home helps should be organised by the Local Authority
in all areas.
4. Antenatal Clinics
The antenatal clinic, where it exists, should be an essential part of the
obstetric service and staffed by obstetricians. In these clinics more attention


should be paid to the diet of the expectant mother and instruction given in the
principles of correct feeding. The services of dietitians and of doctors specially
trained in nutrition work will be required.
5. Maternity Hospitals
More maternity hospitals, well planned and with full-time obstetricians
in charge, are required. The aim in this expansion of the service should be to
make possible the admission to hospital of all primigravidae and all others
with bad obstetrical histories or from unsuitable homes. Without extending
the stay in hospital or making any allowance for the present increasing ten-
dency to seek hospital confinement, at least 45 beds per 1,000 total births would
be required, and this should be regarded as the first minimum to be attained.
The nurseries in maternity hospitals should have cubicles for premature
infants and accommodation for the isolation of infections. They should be
under the direct charge of adequate medical staffs specially trained in the
care of infants. The problem of neonatal infection requires further investigation
and the institution of stricter measures of control.
6. Training in Child Health and Nutrition
To provide the special training of the increased medical staffs required
and to improve the services of the general practitioner, more attention should
be given in the medical curriculum and in post-graduate courses to the teaching
of child health and nutrition. The teaching should include instruction in the
correct feeding of mothers and infants.
Education should be provided in schools in the general principles of health
and preparation for parenthood.
7. Illegitimate and Boarded-out Infants
To avoid the difficulties and anomalies which arise from divided supers
vision, the Medical Officer of Health should be made Infant Life Protection
Officer and the Health Visitor should be Infant Life Protection Visitor, re-
sponsible, to the Medical Officer of Health. The administration of the Adoption
Acts on behalf of the Local Authority should be solely in the hands of the
Clerk to the Local Authority and the Medical Officer of Health.

PART ONE
THE MORTALITY OF LIVE-BORN
INFANTS
CHAPTER 1—THE HIGH INFANT MORTALITY IN SCOTLAND
Total Mortality compared by Country : Table 1 shows the infant mortality
rate in Scotland compared with other countries. The figures are for the pre-war
quinquennium 1934-38.
From this it will be seen that the infant mortality rate in Scotland compared
unfavourably with that in other parts of the English-speaking world and
all other countries in the west of Europe except Spain and Portugal.
Total Mortality compared by Period : That this has not always been the
case is shown in Table 2.
All countries show a decline over a period of years. Scotland, however, has
shown only a slow rate of decline and from a relatively favourable position in


1871-75 has fallen behind in the race until, in the immediate pre-war period, it
occupied the position shown in Table 1. The reversal in the relative positions
of Holland, Scotland and England and Wales * is particularly noticeable (see
Fig. 1). England and Wales and New Zealand have been able to reduce their

1880-1940
infant death rates by two-thirds of what they were sixty or seventy years ago,
but Scotland has been able to reduce her infant death rate by only 40 per cent.
Neonatal Mortality and Mortality from 1 to 12 Months : A study of the
incidence and causes of mortality during the first year has shown that the problem
* Wherever the phrase “ England and Wales ” occurs, it refers to the two together and
does not imply that the statement is true of both England and Wales separately.

may most conveniently be analysed in two parts. Deaths between the end of
the first month and twelve months of age may be largely attributed to environ-
mental causes and those during the neonatal period in great part to causes
relating to the health of the mother during pregnancy or the character of the
labour. The evidence for this will be discussed below (p. 18).
In Table 3 the neonatal mortality and the mortality between one and
twelve months in Scotland in the pre-war quinquennium are compared with
those in seven other countries. Scotland has in each subdivision the same
unfavourable place in relation to these countries as for total infant mortality.
Scotland’s neonatal mortality is 68 per cent, greater than that of the best
countries and 23 per cent, greater than that of England and Wales. The
mortality between one and twelve months is four times that of the best countries
and one and a half times that of England and Wales. This suggests that the
later mortality is more easily brought under control than the early. The his-
torical comparison in the next section supports this suggestion. But, never-
theless, the neonatal mortality is very high and the mortality between one and
twelve months excessively so.
Historical Comparison of Mortality under 1 Month and from 1 to 12
Months : The changes which have taken place in neonatal mortality and that
during the rest of the first year in the same eight countries are shown in
Tables 4 and 5.
It will be seen that, in each country, the 1-12 months’ component of infant
mortality was originally higher than the neonatal, and has shown the greater
decrease. In countries other than Scotland and Canada, it is now less than the
neonatal mortality.
Scotland’s improvement has been less in both components than that of any
of the other countries shown. The neonatal rates of New Zealand, Australia,
England and Wales, and Scotland have decreased by 21 per cent., 16 per cent.,
26 per cent, and 14 per cent, respectively between 1911-15 and 1936-40. The

corresponding percentage decreases of mortality between one and twelve months
are 60, 68, 63 and 44.
The data for New Zealand, Holland and Norway suggest that the neonatal
rate has tended to stabilise at just over 20 ; mortality between one and twelve
months can be reduced to 10 or 12. Scotland would need to reduce her neonatal
mortality by one-third and her mortality between one and twelve months by
three-quarters to bear comparison with the best countries. This would save
3,640 infant lives annually, 1,080 in the first month and 2,560 between one and
twelve months.
CHAPTER 2—DISTRIBUTION OF INFANT MORTALITY IN
GREAT BRITAIN
Scotland compared with England and Wales : A comparison of the total
infant mortality rates, the neonatal mortality rates, and the mortality rates
between one and twelve months for Scotland and England and Wales, and various
subdivisions thereof, is shown in Tables 6 (geographical areas) and 7 (urban and
rural areas).
From this it will be seen that West Central Scotland shows the highest infant
mortality of any region in Great Britain. The remainder of Scotland, Wales and
the North of England are all alike fairly bad. Greater London and the Midlands
are fairly good and the predominantly rural areas of the South and East of
England are best. The distribution of neonatal mortality is similar, although
there is no such violent contrast between West Central Scotland and the other
bad areas as there is in mortality between one and twelve months. Greater


London and the rest of the South East have neonatal rates almost as good as the
best countries in the world, Holland, New Zealand and Norway.
The high rates in West Central Scotland are also shown in Figs. 2 and 3,
which give the infant and neonatal mortality rates in the administrative

counties (excluding the twenty-four largest burghs in Scotland and the eighty-
four county boroughs of England and Wales) of Great Britain for the quin


quennium 1934-38. Lanark, Ayr, Wigtown, Clackmannan and Durham have
the worst infant mortality, and the N.E. of Scotland, the Lowlands, Wales
and the North of England, are all high. The distribution of neonatal mortality
is similar. It is interesting to note that the predominantly rural areas of S.W.

and N E. Scotland are as bad as, or worse than, the mining villages and small
industrial towns of the Lowlands of Scotland and the N.E. of England.

1 In England, Rural Districts.
The mortality over parts of the Highlands and Islands is low and bears com-
parison with the S.E. of England.
Urban and Rural Areas : When urban and rural areas in the two countries
are compared (Table 7), the same difference in favour of England and Wales is
found in both types of area. Both in Scotland and in England and Wales,
the infant mortality is lower in rural areas than in urban areas.
The excess mortality in urban areas in general suggests that certain town
influences adversely affect infant mortality, but recent experience in the U.S.A.
shows that such influences can be overcome. From 1915 to 1928 urban mortality
was higher than rural, but since then the reverse has been the case. In the
U.S.A., births and deaths are not allocated to the place of residence of the
mother as in Great Britain, but to the place of occurrence of the birth or death.
A special investigation in 1939 (Sommers, 1942) of infant mortality in the white
population by place of residence showed that the mortality in cities (over
10,000) had been reduced to 41, and was below that in rural areas, 46 ; but
that mortality in small towns (2,500-10,000) was still 50 and above both the
city and rural death rates. “ Towns provided the least favourable oppor-
tunity for infant survival, having apparently sacrificed the healthful environ-
ment of the rural area without having attained the superior facilities of the
city.” The experience of Holland, where the infant mortality rate (1930-32)
in towns with a population over 100,000 was 37, and in rural areas 54, has
been similar (Titmuss, 1943). The general surplus of adverse conditions in
Scotland, affecting both rural and urban areas, places the special hospital and
medical services at a disadvantage and prevents their full influence from being
manifested.
Cities of Great Britain : The four Scottish cities are compared with
cities or aggregates of cities of comparable size in England and Wales in
Table 8 (p. 15).
From this it will be seen that the infant mortality rate in Glasgow in 1934-38
was 99, the highest of any city or large burgh in Great Britain. Its rate is 27 per
cent, higher than that of Liverpool and 57 per cent, higher than that of Birming-
ham, cities of comparable size. It is 60 per cent, higher than that of the county
of London and 83 per cent, higher than that of Greater London. The cities of
Aberdeen and Dundee show rates of 76 and 77 ; Coventry, Southampton,
Bolton and Swansea are all 20 to 25 per cent, lower ; only Sunderland is as
high. Edinburgh is the only Scottish city which compares at all favourably
with cities of similar size in England and Wales, but, even so, Bristol and
Sheffield, with rates of 46 and 54, are lower.
Similarly the neonatal rates of the four Scottish cities, particularly Glasgow,
are among the highest in the list.
Yet from the preceding discussion of urban and rural rates in U.S.A. and
Holland, it is evident that the conditions of life in large cities need not be
associated with a high infant mortality rate.

These figures are further illustrated in Fig. 4 (opposite).
Occupational or Social Class Mortality in England and Wales : Table 10
shows the mortality of legitimate infants, according to the social class of the
Registrar-General’s classification by father’s occupation.* In social class I are
included those with the highest incomes ; in class V are those with the lowest
incomes. No data for occupational or social class mortality are available
in Scotland.
There is a steady rise in mortality from class I to class V at all ages under
one year, which becomes more marked as the baby gets older. The neonatal
* The five classes distinguished by the Registrar-General include : class I, higher ranks
of business and professional life ; class 11, retail trades, clerks, teachers, etc., farmers ;
class 111, skilled labour ; class IV, neither artisan nor wholly unskilled, farm labourers ;
class V, unskilled labour. They are not co-extensive with income groupings, but an
analysis of 5,000 families by Crawford and Broadley (1938) indicates, along with the fact
that children tend to be concentrated in low-income families, that so far as families with
children are concerned the association between class and income is very high.


mortality in class Vis 50 per cent, greater than that in class I. Between one
and three months, mortality is three times as great, between three and six
months four times as great, and between six and twelve months five timps as
great.
From Tables 1 and 3, it will be seen that New Zealand’s infant mortality
rate (32) is comparable with that of social class I and Scotland’s (77) with that
of social class V. Similarly with neonatal rates; New Zealand’s (23) is com-

parable with that of class I, but Scotland’s (37) is greater than that of
class V.
It appears therefore that only the “ upper ranks of business and professional
life ” in England and Wales had, ten years ago, attained the low standard of
infant mortality established in New Zealand as a whole and that infant
mortality in Scotland lagged behind at the level held by the poorer working
classes in England and Wales.
In any big city in Britain a very wide range exists in the mortality in
different wards. The poorest and most overcrowded districts have the highest

rates and the middle-class residential districts are much lower. In 1938, the
wards with the lowest and highest infant mortality in Glasgow had rates of
47 and 131 ; in Edinburgh, 34 and 99 ; in Aberdeen, 19 and 94 ; and in Dundee,
47 and 127.
CHAPTER 3—THE CAUSES OF INFANT DEATH
Comparison by Country : The causes of infant death in different countries
during the first month, during the period 1-12 months and for the whole year
are shown in Table 11 (p. 19).
Neonatal deaths are recorded, in all countries, as due mainly to ( a) pre-
maturity and congenital debility, and ( b) malformations and birth injuries. All
other causes together account for only about one-fourth of the total.
In the succeeding eleven months, half or more than half the deaths are due
to infections.
These facts make clear the reason, referred to in Chapter 1, p. 10, above, for
differentiating between the two periods. Prematurity and congenital debility
are, without doubt, largely referable to the condition of the mother during
pregnancy. The aetiology of congenital malformations is not understood.
Some may be examples of arrested or disturbed development, and, as such,
related to antenatal conditions. Birth injuries may be due to poor maternal
physique, as in rachitic pelvis; to such physiological disturbances as uterine
inertia; or to faulty obstetrics. But the most frequent form of birth injury,
cerebral birth trauma, at times associated with cyanosis, occurs in many cases
where there is no obvious physical disability or obstetrical fault. This is
especially true of premature infants. The great majority of neonatal deaths
are therefore referable to antenatal causes.
On the other hand, it is mainly because of poor hygiene that infants con-
tract acute infections, although their chances of survival may be seriously
reduced by lack of reserves at birth, or by incorrect and inadequate feeding.
Historical Comparisons : The historical review in Table 12 (p. 20)
extends this picture by showing that the improvement in the infant mortality
rate in New Zealand and in England and Wales has been due mainly to the
reduction of deaths from infection and that the present excess in Scotland is
due chiefly to a much smaller reduction under this heading. The slower rate of
improvement is particularly marked in respect of respiratory infections.
The death rates from the causes special to the neonatal period have been
and still are closely similar in Scotland and England and Wales, with the
exception of congenital debility. The present superiority of England in respect
of neonatal deaths is almost entirely due to reduction of deaths from congenital
debility. In the 1-12 months period, only a very small fraction of the Scottish
excess is due to tuberculosis, syphilis, convulsions, accident or unknown causes.
The excess is explicable as shown in Table 13.

Occupational Mortality : Table 14 shows the causes of death by social
class as distributed by the Registrar-General.
There is a steady rise from class I to class V in all causes shown except
congenital malformations and injury at birth. The rise is greatest for infectious
disease. Whooping-cough mortality in class Vis nine times that in class I;
for bronchitis and pneumonia it is seven times and for tuberculosis, diarrhoea
and enteritis and other common infections, four times. In class V the recorded
prematurity rate is not quite double, and the congenital debility rate not quite
three times, that of class I.
Comparison of these data with those in Table 12 shows, in respect of causes,
that only the upper classes in England and Wales are comparable with New
Zealand, and that Scotland, as a whole, approximates to the lowest occupational
class in England and Wales.
The Importance of Prematurity : In almost all records prematurity is
the most frequent single stated cause of death in the first month. Even so. the
records greatly understate the importance of prematurity because, usually, if
it is possible to assign any other cause, a death will not be ascribed to prematurity.
Yet the cause specified may be closely related to the prematurity. For
instance, congenital debility and malformations may be simple expressions
of incomplete development, and injury at birth is more likely to occur to the
premature infant because its tissues are more fragile. An attempt has therefore
been made to assess the effect of prematurity on infant mortality. Only studies
in which premature births are distinguished by a birth weight of less than
2,500 g. (5| lb.) have been considered.
Two studies of the incidence and effect of prematurity in general popula-
tions have been found. One relates to mortality in New York State, excluding
New York City, in 1936 ; the other to mortality in New York City in 1939. The
former includes both white and coloured infants since these were not separately
stated. From the latter the data for births of white infants have been extracted.

1 This figure is not strictly comparable with that for single births. Twins weigh on
the average less than single born infants and when the same weight standard is used to
assess prematurity, the proportion of twins among prematures is overassessed. On the
other hand, the inclusion or exclusion of twins makes little difference to the final result.
Negro infants also appear on the average to weigh less than white. For this reason
data for white infants only have been presented where it is possible to separate the two.
Where they have not been separated, the incidence of prematurity would have been less
if white infants only had been included.
The data are presented in Table 15. The incidence of prematurity in Chicago
in 1940 was 6-5 per cent, but the data have not been presented in a form to
make assessment of its effect possible.
The general neonatal rates in New York State and City are low in comparison
with the data in Table 3. In both cases the rate in full-time infants is less than
half that in the entire group. Prematurity has more than doubled neonatal
mortality.
Similar evidence is afforded by hospital data. No close correspondence in
detail would be expected between the data for a community and those for a
hospital, because a hospital population is seldom, if ever, a cross-section of the
area it serves. Hospital records will be weighted by an excess of the poor, and
by complicated pregnancies and difficult labours. It might be expected, there-
fore, that premature labours would show an excess in hospital cases but the data
for Chicago Lying-in Hospital, with 5-6 per cent, prematurity, taken with the
1940 figure of 6-5 per cent, for Chicago as a whole, do not support this view.
In any case, the records are instructive. Illustrative recent data are presented
in Table 16. A general estimate for American hospitals of sto 6 per cent, is
given in Appendix 3 (p. 80).
Peckham’s survey covered forty years. He stated that there had been no
significant change in that time. The rates are relatively low. Flax et al. do not
give data for full-time births but the mortality of premature infants is high.
The two Scottish hospitals show higher prematurity rates than the American
hospitals and higher mortality rates than Baltimore. In these prematurity has,
in the one case, more than doubled and, in the other, more than trebled the death
rate. Mortality in Baltimore was less than doubled by prematurity.
The incidence of 7 per cent, prematurity quoted from Anderson’s study at
Cincinnati General Hospital applies only to single white live births since their
twin births were not distinguished by race.

Both Peckham and Flax show that the heavier a premature child is at birth,
the better are its chances of survival. Peckham’s data are discussed further
below in connection with stillbirths, and illustrated in Fig. 5, p. 42.
The following table (Table 17) compares the distribution of birth weights of
premature live-born infants at Aberdeen and Edinburgh Maternity Hospitals,

with that at Cincinnati General Hospital (Anderson et al., 1941) and the Johns
Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore (Peckham, 1938) and the distribution of the birth
weights of premature infants dying in the first month of life in Aberdeen,
Edinburgh and Baltimore. Only white single births are included in the
American data.
It will be seen that, in both sets of data, Aberdeen and Edinburgh show a
smaller proportion of the higher birth-weights and more of the lesser weights than
the American hospitals. This, taken in conjunction with the higher incidence
of prematurity in the Scottish hospitals as compared with the American (Table
16), is at least sufficient to suggest that the general incidence of prematurity in
Scotland is higher than in the United States.
Flax et al. present tables showing causes of death by weight groups, from
which it appears that in infants of less than 1500 g. (3-3 lb.) at birth, 83 per cent,
of deaths are due to atelectasis, cranial injury or prematurity without other
assignable cause. Above this weight an abrupt change occurs. In infants
weighing from 1500 g. to 2500 g. (5J lb.) only 38 per cent, of deaths are due to
these three causes together and 42 per cent, to broncho-pneumonia and diarrhoea
alone or 50 per cent, to infection (excluding syphilis). The reduction in deaths
shown in Table 16 in the second period coincided with improvements in super-
vision and nursing care in 1939 with provision of breast milk for the smallest
babies, and the opening early in 1940 of a special unit for premature infants
with isolation for the sick.
The distribution of causes of deaths in this series is closely similar to that
reported for Edinburgh Maternity Hospital by McNeil, who stresses the need
for better control of infections. The data are compared in Table 18.
Further evidence, both of the importance of birth-weight and of the possible
reduction of infection comes from Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, with a different
classification of deaths. (Table 19.)
The largest group is the first. It includes 74 per cent, of the deaths. Most
of the infants died within three days of birth and most of them were very small.
These deaths must be attributed to prematurity alone.
In the last group, 6-6 per cent, of the total, the deaths are in no wise due to
post-natal environment. In the second group it seems likely that most of the
deaths were due simply to prematurity but there may have been infection.
In the third group, 14-6 per cent, of the total, most of the infants were heavier
and the deaths may have been avoidable. Of the twenty deaths, sixteen occurred
in 1941 and only four in 1942 when increased nursery accommodation and staff
were provided to deal with ill babies.
Taken with Flax’s data, this suggests that, with the most careful isolation
and nursing, the death rate from infection in premature babies can be reduced.
But, even if all the deaths from infection were eliminated, the result would still
be unsatisfactory. For instance, in the Aberdeen data, the complete elimination
of deaths from infection, assuming that the infants would then survive, would

reduce the neonatal death rate in prematures only from 391 to 334 per thousand
premature births, and the general neonatal rate from 60-2 to 53-9. There would
remain the much larger problem of eliminating prematurity, by which the general
rate could be reduced to one-third, without any change in the full-time death
rate.
From time to time the conventional certification of infant deaths has been
criticised as concealing causes of death (Bundesen et al., 1937; Spence and
Miller, 1941) and therefore providing an unsatisfactory basis for improvement.
Bundesen and his co-workers made a careful investigation into the causes
of infant deaths, up to fifteen days of age, in Chicago in 1936. There were 1123
such deaths (61 per cent, of the total 1,848 infant deaths), and of these 681 were
deaths of premature infants. Satisfactory post-mortem examinations were
maHp of more than a third of these. During the following four years an intensive
campaign to reduce the mortality of premature infants was instituted (Hess,
1936 ; Bundesen et al., 1936-38). Approximate comparison of the 1936 data
with the corresponding data for 1940 (Report of Board of Health for the year
1940) indicates that the death-rate of premature infants under fifteen days fell
by about 10 per cent, during this period, while the general infant mortality rate
fell by 25 per cent. This is, in itself, no insignificant result but it is small com-
pared to the reduction of mortality that might be achieved by the elimination
of premature birth.
• Spence and Miller approached the problem from a different angle, attempting


by special inquiry to throw light on the causes of infant deaths over a year in
Newcastle. The greatest value of this survey possibly lies in the attempt to
discover the causes of the premature onset of labour.
There were 272 deaths investigated out of a total of 274. Of these, 78 were
of premature infants born to 73 mothers. The prematurity was attributed to
twin pregnancy in 15 cases. It was associated with toxaemia in 13, with
rheumatic heart disease in 2 and with infection in 3. There was a history of
repeated premature birth or miscarriage in 4 and Caesarean section was necessary
in 2. There were 34 cases left with no obvious associated abnormality.
These findings differ little from other attempts to associate prematurity
with pathological conditions in the mother. In the surveys of Clifford (1934),
Breese (1938), Potter and Adair (1938), the review by Anderson and Lyon (1939)
and the findings of Anderson, Brown and Lyon (1941), about half of the prema-
ture births investigated were associated with toxaemia, haemorrhage or premature
rupture of membranes, and more than 40 per cent, occurred without any obvious
maternal complication. The associations were mostly considered insignificant
and these investigations therefore apparently contribute little or nothing to a
solution of the problem of premature birth. Even if the associations had been
definite the problem would still be unsolved because the causes of the toxaemias,
haemorrhages, and premature rupture of the membranes would still be unknown.
Anderson, Brown and Lyon carried their analysis further. Of the 2,373
births investigated, 9'7 per cent, of the prematures were illegitimate and only
4-6 per cent, of the full-term infants; 12-6 per cent, of the mothers of pre-
mature infants complained of excessive fatigue and only 6-4 per cent, of the
mothers of heavier infants. An assessment was made, in terms of number of
visits, of the adequacy of antental care. Care was judged inadequate in 51-9
per cent, of the mothers of premature and in 38 4 per cent, of the mothers of
mature infants.
No account was taken of diet beyond establishing that there was a cor-
relation between low maternal and low infant birth weight, which might be
associated with diet. Such a correlation would, however, be found in general
even if all the mothers were equally well nourished. Since in fact this hospital
population was all from “ the lower economic strata ” in which much malnutri-
tion would be expected, the most promising line of investigation would have
been a comparison of the diets of mothers of premature and mature infants
(cf. below, p. 48, Graham and Cameron).
The known facts concerning the relationship of diet to toxaemia, premature
birth and the viability of the young are summarised in Part 111.
In Table 14, p. 21, the registered mortality attributed to premature birth in
class Vis nearly twice that in class I. From what has been said above and from
Table 27, p. 36 below, this social class difference appears likely to be due chiefly
to a greater incidence of prematurity among the poor.
The Importance of Infections after One Month of Age : The data
assembled above show the overriding importance of normal development of the
child for survival to one month of age, and of infection as a cause of death after
one month *
Epidemics of infectious disease in young children vary greatly in extent and
severity, particularly those that occur in the winter months. Their extent and
severity may be said to depend on (a) the virulence and infectivity of the infect-
ing organisms, (b) the exposure and (c) the powers of resistance of those exposed
to attack. The spread of infection, particularly droplet infection, is most fre-
quent in overcrowded houses in congested areas of towns and cities (see also
below, p. 29). There is evidence that the severity of the major epidemic
diseases of young children has shown a general decline in recent years but this
improvement has not been fully manifested among the infant and child popula-
tions where housing conditions are poor and exposure most free and frequent.
The periodic mortality from the main epidemic diseases accounts for part,
but not all, of the excess in areas where the infant death rate is high. In addition
to this, deaths from respiratory and gastro-intestinal disease show a continu-
ously high rate in such areas. Housing conditions are no doubt partly respon


sible, but, in this class of infections, the powers of resistance of the subject may
be of as great importance. The importance of the correct feeding of infants for
resistance to such infective disease will be discussed in Part 111.
Infections in Maternity Hospitals: It has been shown in Table 11, p. 19,
that, according to the certification of causes of deaths in the first month in
Scotland, about one-quarter are due to infection. Some authorities consider
that this is an underestimate and that the true mortality from infections cannot
be stated without post-mortem examination of all infants dying. It is a matter
of greater immediate concern that epidemic and endemic infections in some
maternity hospitals should be responsible for a fair proportion of these deaths.
In a consecutive series of 225 post-mortem examinations of infants dying during
the first month in the Maternity Pavilion, Royal Edinburgh Infirmary (McNeil,
1942), 27 per cent, of the deaths were judged to be due to infection.
The infections responsible for-these neonatal deaths in maternity hospitals
are of four types : epidemic diarrhoea, staphylococcal disease, Bacillus colt
infections and thrush. Craig (1936) and Henderson (1943) have described out-
breaks of enteritis (acute alimentary catarrh) in an Edinburgh hospital in which
no organism of the dysenteric group was isolated. Almost all of the infants
affected were bottle fed. Graham (1939) described one in Glasgow due to B.
enteritidis (Gaertner).
Similar outbreaks have been described in English hospitals by Ormiston
(1941) and in American hospitals by Rice et al. (1937) and Best (1938). These
American reports were followed by administrative action by which diarrhoea of
the new-born in institutions was made notifiable and special regulations designed
to prevent its occurrence. In Ormiston’s series, as in some of the American out-
breaks, none of the usual dysentery organisms was responsible (Crowley et al.,
1941).*
In an extensive study of fatal pneumonia in the new-born, Macgregor (1939)
has shown that staphylococcal and B. colt infections are common. Pneumonia
due to B. colt is extremely rare at any later age. Craig (1936) in a series of
21 cases of neonatal meningitis found B. coli to be the infecting organism in 10
and Staphylococcus in 5.
Ludlam and Henderson (1942) studied the incidence of thrush in infants in
a Scottish maternity hospital and found 163 cases among 2,540 infants that
survived for more than forty-eight hours, an incidence of 6-4 per cent. The
condition was relatively much more frequent in premature than in full-term
infants. The incidence increased with length of stay in hospital and the pro-
portion of infants infected was much greater than the proportion developing
lesions while in hospital. Over a period of four years, twenty cases of ulceration
of the oesophagus, due to thrush, were found at post-mortem examination and
the ulceration was regarded as the cause of death in thirteen, i.e. in 4-3 per cent,
of deaths after forty-eight hours in hospital. Three-fifths of the fatal infections
were in premature infants. Other publications are cited by Ludlam and
Henderson, which show a similar high incidence in other maternity hospitals in
England and elsewhere.
It will be seen later, Part IV, pp. 64-66, that maternity hospitals, especially
the voluntary hospitals, in Scotland, are overcrowded. This is probably partly
responsible for the high incidence of these infections. Since the tendency is
towards an increase in the proportion of births in institutions, the problem is
clearly one that calls for immediate investigation and for effective counter-
measures.
* A more recent paper on outbreaks in Canadian Hospitals (McClure, 1943) describes
the isolation of the same strains of haemolytic colon organisms from the fasces of infants and
nurses and from tables and feeding bottles.


CHAPTER 4—ASSOCIATIONS WITH HIGH INFANT
MORTALITY RATE
Climate : Titmuss states in his most recent book, Birth, Poverty and Wealth,
that if it is a fact that climate has a significant effect on infant mortality we
should expect to find that infants in class I, as distinguished by the Registrar-
General, in the North, would have a higher death rate than in the South. But
this is not the case. For instance, Lancashire and Cheshire, with a damp climate
and heavy smoke belt, have a lower class I rate than the South West of England
and South Wales with a more favourable climate. It will be remembered from
Table I that Iceland and Norway, with much more severe winter climates than
either England and Wales or Scotland, have much lower infant mortality rates.
Fig. 2 and the data in Appendix 1, Table 52, show that the islands of Orkney and
Shetland and some of the Highland Counties have the lowest infant mortality
rates in Scotland. If, therefore, climate has any important effect on infant
mortality, as measured by annual death rates, it is more than offset by other
influences. On the other hand, the seasonal incidence of mortality, which for
some years has been highest in the first quarter of the year, suggests that winter
weather does affect the susceptibility to and the severity of infections and especi-
ally respiratory infections. This effect would be most likely to appear where
housing and general environment are poorest.
Economic and Social Conditions : It is apparent from the data presented
in Chapters 2 and 3 that adverse economic and social conditions have a direct
effect on the infant’s chances of survival. But there is in Great Britain no
detailed investigation of which particular factors in this complex are the most
important. Such data as are available in Scotland and England and Wales on
the incidence of low incomes, unemployment, overcrowding and high birth rates
are presented here.
Low Incomes : In 1936 an investigation by Orr into income distribution in
Great Britain showed that 10 per cent, of the population had an income per head
of less than 10s. a week, which meant that, on the average, only 4s. a week was
spent on food. A similar investigation in Scotland in 1936 showed about twice
as high a proportion of the population in this income group.
Overcrowding : In the housing survey of 1935, the percentage of families
overcrowded in Scotland was 22-6 ; in England and Wales it was 3-8. Table 20
shows the overcrowding in the twenty-four large burghs of Scotland. The
mortality between one and twelve months is presented rather than total infant
mortality since, as has been shown above, it tends to be more sensitive to poor
environmental conditions.
The percentages range from 11-3 in Inverness to 44-8 in Coatbridge, with an
average of 26-2. In English cities the overcrowding is of an entirely different
order. Of the twenty-three in Table 8, only Sunderland, with a percentage of
20-6 and Newcastle and Gateshead with 12-0, are in any way comparable with
the Scottish cities. The remainder vary from 0-9 to 8-4 and the average is 4-5.
From Table 20 it can be seen that there is a correlation which is statistically
significant between mortality and overcrowding. The average overcrowding is
26-2 per cent. Ten out of the first twelve cities in order of mortality have a
higher percentage than this ; only two out of the last twelve. The average
overcrowding among the first twelve is 33T per cent. ; among the last twelve
it is 19-3 per cent.
It must be remembered that these percentages represent families over-
crowded. The proportion of people living under overcrowded conditions is
naturally higher. The standard used in the survey was not over high ; the
permitted number of “ persons ” to each room of a " house ” was two, a child
between one and ten years of age being only half a “ person ” and an infant not
a “ person ”at all. The standard does not take into account overcrowding per

building as distinct from overcrowding per “ house ” and does not therefore give
an adequate idea of the massing of humanity in tenements that is a feature of
Scottish slums. The most crowded houses will also usually be the oldest and
most dilapidated, with decaying woodwork and pest infested, sometimes
without water closet, indoor water supply or even the most meagre larder
accommodation.
The very great difference in social class mortality from whooping cough
shown in Table 14 is certainly due, in large part, to overcrowding in poor families
where it is practically impossible to isolate the infected. An investigation by
Halliday (1928) in Glasgow showed how tenements contribute to the spread of
measles among young children. In schools serving tenement areas twice as
many children had measles by the age of five as in schools serving a middle-class
housing estate. The case mortality of children under two years is from ten to
twenty times that of children of school age. The same must be true of other
epidemic infections. Not only so, but overcrowding must favour the spread of
all respiratory infection and the poor standard of sanitation and domestic water
supplies will greatly increase the risk of gastro-intestinal disease. In this way
infants are subjected to repeated or mass infections of the most varied type.

Unemployment : The unemployment rate also is higher in Scotland than
in Great Britain as a whole, although Wales and North England show higher
percentages (Table 21).
A high percentage of unemployment in any district probably increases
poverty both directly and indirectly by depressing wage rates, and the depressing
effect of economic insecurity will hardly be conducive to the careful rearing of
children.
Table 20 gives the percentage of the insured population unemployed in
twenty-three of the twenty-four large burghs of Scotland, 1934-36. A high
unemployment rate was then correlated with a high mortality rate between one
and twelve months. The correlation is statistically significant. In the first ten
burghs arranged in order of mortality the average unemployment rate was 20T
per cent.; in the last ten 15-7 per cent. The average rate was 16-2 per cent.
Eight out of the first ten had a higher rate than this and one of the last ten.
The Scottish cities had a much higher unemployment rate than London.
Percentage rates are not available for other English cities.
Birth Rate : In Great Britain, a relatively high birth rate is unfortunately
associated with poverty and poor surroundings. In 1930-32, in England and
Wales, the number of legitimate births per 1,000 married women aged 15 to 44
was 95 in class I and 152 in class V. In 1938 the figure for the whole of England
and Wales was 112 and for Scotland 152, the same as class V in England in
1932. The rate for class Vin Scotland would be much above that of Scotland
as a whole.
This means that poor mothers in Scotland begin having children at a rela-
tively early age and have large and closely spaced families. No analysis on a
large scale has been made of the effect of maternal age and birth order on infant
mortality, but such local inquiries as have been undertaken (e.g. Elderton, 1925 ;
Yerushalmy, 1938, 1940; Burns, 1942) have shown that very early and very
late child-bearing give high mortality rates. The findings suggest that at least
neonatal mortality will be related in much the same way as stillbirths to age
and parity. The relationship for stillbirths is shown for England and Wales in
Table 33, p. 43. It is further shown in Table 35 that, as far as expectation of
live births is concerned, the age and parity distribution of Scottish births is
highly favourable. Hence it may be tentatively concluded that early breeding
and large families would not increase the expectation of neonatal mortality
among the poor in Scotland. But the close spacing of the family may affect
later mortality. Woodbury (1925) has shown that when there is an interval of
only one year between births, the death rate is 50 per cent, higher than when the
interval is two years or more. When a new baby is started before the first is a
year old, the chances of death of the first baby are multiplied by three.
Children are in themselves a source of poverty since young wage-earners

have low wage rates not adjusted to family needs. The younger the parents and
the more closely spaced the family, the greater will be the poverty. On the other
hand, those who postpone child-bearing until they “ can afford it ” will then
have a lower natural fertility than those who start reproduction at an early age.
This is recognised in clinical practice to be so, and has recently been demonstrated
experimentally in animals. Those who begin late will therefore tend to have
fewer children, apart from voluntary restriction, than those of similar age who
begin early. The postponement of child-bearing may increase the risk of child-
birth but this increase appears to be more than offset by the advantages of better
economic status, including the possibility of securing better medical and nursing
care.
Declining birth rates in recent years have caused additional attention to be
directed to problems of infant death. The birth rates in England and Wales
and Scotland in 1938 of 15T and 17-7 represent net reproduction rates * of 0-81
and 0-96. Hence Scotland as a whole and class Vin England and Wales are
not quite maintaining themselves ; England and Wales as a whole is far from
doing so. It is a mistake, therefore, to talk of a high birth rate for any area or
class in Great Britain, except perhaps the Scottish poor. The loss of infant life
is, therefore, all the more important. But it is also certain that a high birth rate
need not be associated with high infant mortality. In Holland, where in 1938
the birth rate was 20-7, giving a reproduction rate of well over 1, the infant mor-
tality rate was only 37. Further, the birth rates of New Zealand, Australia,
Norway and Sweden appear to show a definite rise above the low values reached
between 1933 and 1935. In New Zealand, for instance, the birth rate rose from
16T to 22-8 between 1935 and 1941, while the infant mortality rate fell from
32-3 to 29-7.
Illegitimacy : In Scotland, illegitimate births form a higher percentage of
the total, and the excess of deaths in illegitimate children is greater than in
England and Wales (Table 22).
There was an average difference, over the five years, between the legitimate
death rates of 20 and between the illegitimate rates of 26. In Scotland the
average excess mortality in illegitimate children was 38 ; in England 32. Thus
the high death rate of illegitimate infants is a serious problem in itself, but it
contributes little to the total mortality, and reduction to the same level as that
for legitimate infants would reduce total mortality by only 2 per 1000.
Poverty and overcrowding bear more hardly on the illegitimate child.
Illegitimate births include a higher percentage of first births and probably a
much higher percentage of mothers in employment and unable to give the child
the necessary care.
Yet, given good conditions, the illegitimate death rate need not be high. In
* The Gross Reproduction Rate is a measure of the number of girl babies produced per
woman of the present generation. If the rate is unity, the women are just being replaced.
The Net Reproduction Rate takes into account the death rates at various ages and is a
better measure of the expected size of the next generation of women.


Oslo in 1935, " foster children ” under the control of the Department of Health,
mostly illegitimate infants, had a mortality of only 10 per 1,000. In Birmingham
in 1938, a plan was made to improve the standards of care for the unmarried
mother and her child. Three special workers were appointed. There are now
six homes for unmarried mothers, run by voluntary societies, to which the
Local Authority, through its Maternity and Child Welfare Committee, can send
mothers, either before or after confinement. The Committee pays the charges.
There is also a service of foster mothers, under the control of the Health
Department and paid by the Local Authority who recover the whole or part of
the cost from the mother. Good results seem to be appearing as the following
table shows.
1938 1939 1940 1941
Legitimate death rate . . .60 58 70 69
Illegitimate death rate . .80 94 69 75
In Scotland, too, illegitimate and boarded-out children are subject to divided
supervision in a way that does not obtain in England and Wales. The Infant
Life Protection Officer in Scotland is the Public Assistance Officer. In England
and Wales he is usually the Medical Officer of Health. The Health Visitor is the
most suitable person to act as Infant Life Protection Visitor and she should be
responsible to the Medical Officer of Health, whereas in Scotland she is in fact
responsible to the Public Assistance Officer for this part of her work. In many
instances, the Public Assistance Departments have their own officials who act
also as Infant Life Protection Visitors and whose views from time to time are
likely to, and in fact do, differ from those of the Health Visitors as to what is
best for the child.
In the same way, too, the administration of the sections of the Adoption
Acts referring to the duties of local authorities should be solely in the hands of
the Clerk to the Authority and the Medical Officer of Health. This applies
particularly to section 7 of the Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act, 1939.
SUMMARY OF PART ONE
1. The infant mortality i;ate in Scotland compares unfavourably with that in
other parts of the English-speaking world and all other countries in the
West of Europe except Spain and Portugal.
2. All countries show a decline in their infant mortality rate over a period of
years, but in Scotland the rate of decline has been slow. England and
Wales and New Zealand have reduced their infant death rates by
two-thirds ; Scotland by only one-third.
3. The causes of infant mortality can be most conveniently analysed in two
parts, i.e. deaths under one month of age and deaths between one month
and twelve months. Scotland would need to reduce her neonatal
mortality by one-third and her mortality between one and twelve
months by three-quarters to bear comparison with the best countries.
This would save 3,640 infant lives annually.
4. The West Central region of Scotland shows the highest infant mortality of
any region in Great Britain. Taken as a whole, in both Scotland and
England and Wales, the infant mortality is lower in rural areas than
in urban areas. Even so, the predominantly rural areas of South-West
and North-East Scotland are as bad as or worse than the mining villages
and small industrial towns of the Lowlands of Scotland and the
North-East of England.
The excess mortality in urban areas in general suggests that certain
town influences adversely affect infant mortality but recent experience
in the U.S.A. and Holland shows that such influences can be overcome.
It is apparent that there is a general surplus of adverse conditions in
Scotland affecting both rural and urban areas and that there is as yet


little evidence of any tendency of special hospital and medical services
in large towns and cities to offset their disadvantages.
5. Edinburgh is the only Scottish city which compares at all favourably with
cities of similar size in England and Wales. Glasgow in 1934-38 had
a higher infant mortality rate than any other of the twenty-four large
burghs in Scotland or any of the eighty-four county boroughs of
England and Wales.
6. The infant mortality rate for Scotland as a whole is no better than that
found among the poorer working classes in England and Wales.
7. The failure in Scotland to reduce the infant mortality rate between one and
twelve months is mainly due to the fact that the death rate from
infections remains high.
8. Prematurity plays a dominant part in the causation of death in the first
month. Reliable statistics are not available for the general incidence
of prematurity in Scotland, but such evidence as exists indicates that
the rate is high.
Some improvement could be made in the neonatal deaths of pre-
mature infants by improved isolation and nursing but it would be even
more important to discover and remove the causes of premature birth.
9. If climate has any effect on the broad geographical distribution of infant
mortality, it is not detectable in the evidence examined. But the
winter peak of infant mortality suggests that winter weather does
affect the incidence of and mortality from infections and the effect of
bad weather would be most felt where housing conditions are worst.
10. Adverse economic and social conditions have a direct effect on the infants’
chances of survival. In Scotland, as compared with England and
Wales, the percentage of unemployment is higher, the proportion of
people living in poverty is twice as high and the percentage of over-
crowding is six times as great. This explains the high rate of infections
referred to in paragraph 7 above.
11. The experience of Holland has shown that the infant mortality rate can be
reduced to a very low level, although the birth rate is high.
12. Although it contributes little to the total mortality, the high death rate of
illegitimate infants is a serious problem in itself and could be improved
by better standards of care for the unmarried mother and her child.

PART TWO
STILLBIRTHS
CHAPTER 6—THE INCIDENCE OF STILLBIRTHS
Countries compared : Accurate information on the incidence of stillbirths
exists only for a few countries, and only for a few years. Registration of still-
births has been compulsory in New Zealand since 1913, in Holland since 1925,
in Canada since 1926, in England and Wales since 1927 and in Scotland only
since 1939.* These countries are compared in Table 23.
There has been some decline in the rate in Britain during the war. The
excess in Scotland is of the same order as the excess of neonatal mortality. In
each country, the stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates are of similar magnitude
(Table 24) and, as total mortality decreases, for-m an increasing proportion of
the whole.
* For this reason comparisons of stillbirths must be brought into the war period. Apart
from this, the discussion is confined to the pre-war position.

This supports the earlier contention that there are important causes operat-
ing before and immediately after birth, different from those which are the chief
determining causes of death after the first month. Causes of the second class
are more easily brought under control than those of the first.
Districts and Cities of Great Britain : These different causes, although
distinguishable in effect, tend to operate together. Where the total mortality
is high the stillbirth rate is high also. This was shown in the last table and is
further shown in a comparison of areas and towns in Great Britain in Table 25.
Mortality by Occupation or Social Class : The Registrars-General have
not yet made an analysis of stillbirths by occupation, but the incidence, as
shown in Tables 24 and 25, and data to be presented below (Tables 26 and 27)
suggest that a social distribution similar to that of neonatal mortality would be
found. In a special study of 1,083 deaths in four districts, two urban and two
rural, an attempt was made (Campbell and McKinlay, 1929) to distribute the
deaths according to the classification adopted by the Registrar-General (England
and Wales). The results were inconclusive, probably because only deaths were
investigated, not the concurrent successful births, and the samples were small.
Evidence of the existence of a social gradient in incidence of stillbirths is
provided by studies in Stockholm (Rietz, 1930) and Aberdeen (Baird, un-
published).

The data analysed by Rietz refer to legitimate infants born in Stockholm
and suburbs between 1918 and 1922. The total number of births was 17,856
and of deaths 656.
In the Aberdeen analysis three groups are distinguished (Table 27). The
first two are of upper middle-class women with all the advantages of good diet,
adequate rest and good postpartum nursing care. They differed in the ob-
stetrical care they received, the first group being attended by a specialist and
the second by a family doctor. The stillbirth rate in the second group was three
times and the neonatal rate twice that in the first, the difference being chiefly
due to birth trauma.
The first and third groups were both supervised by specialists so that there
was much less difference in obstetrical care between them than between groups
1 and 2. The chief difference was in type of patient. In groups 1 and 2 the
incidence of contracted pelvis, toxsemia and premature labour was much less.
and the general nutritional condition of the women was much better, than in
group 3.
Comparing Tables 26 and 27, the stillbirth and neonatal rates in the highest
income group in Stockholm correspond closely to those of group I in the
Aberdeen study. These, therefore, represent the results that may be obtained
where the health of the mother, obstetric skill and nursing care are all good.
The Possible Saving of Life : By reducing her 1939 rate of 42 to Holland’s
level of 25, Scotland would save 1,570 lives annually. Taken with the possible
saving of live-born infants (Part I, p. 11), this means a total of 5,210 lives
unnecessarily lost each year.

CHAPTER 6—THE CAUSES OF STILLBIRTH
Scotland as a Whole : The Registrar-General for England and Wales does
not publish analyses of the causes of stillbirths. An analysis of the registered
causes in Scotland in 1939 (Preliminary Returns) is as shown in Table 28.
The Registrar-General makes the following comment in his Annual Report
for 1939; “Of the broad groups, the largest number is contained in the ill-
defined and unknown. Of the total 3,832 stillbirths, the cause is ill-defined in
901 and is stated to be unknown in 362 cases. Part of this high proportion of
ill-defined and unknown causes is, no doubt, due to the novelty of the scheme
and will doubtless be reduced as the value of specification of stillbirths by cause
becomes apparent. For instance, in the group of ill-defined causes, 341 are
ascribed to asphyxia, some of which are probably due to difficulties of delivery
of various kinds ; macerated fcetus (175), of which in some cases the cause
(toxaemia, syphilis, etc.) may have been known to the certifier. It will be noted
that the 362 cases where it was definitely stated that no obvious cause was
apparent represent nearly one-tenth of all stillbirths. If no large part of this
group is attributable to detectable causes, and therefore not likely to be reduced
by more accurate recording on the certificate of the cause of death, the size of
the group is of itself evidence sufficient to show the need for investigation
of the factors leading to stillbirth before any hope of improvement can be
entertained.”
Since, then, the value of registration of cause lies in the possible indication of
methods of prevention, and since causes of stillbirth will certainly be divisible
into two parts, those arising primarily from the hazards of birth and those pre-

existing in the child or mother, an attempt has been made to subdivide this
classification according to these two types (Table 29).
It is probably wrong to classify all the deaths attributed to asphyxia under
hazards of birth because, although some of them, like neonatal deaths, will be
due to cerebral injury, others are almost certainly due to defective development
and should be in the second group. It is also true that many of the deaths in
difficult labour will be due to poor physique of the mother, e.g. contracted
pelvis, or to poor health leading to prolonged labour and uterine inertia. But,
since much can be done by good obstetrics to prevent stillbirth eveij in cases
of contracted pelvis, all have been included under hazards of birth. It has been
assumed, although this is unlikely, that all the minor specified causes belong
also to this class.*
Antepartum haemorrhage has been allocated to the other side. Something
can be done by Caesarean section to reduce stillbirths in cases of placenta praevia
but the condition obviously belongs to those pre-existing at birth. In accidental
haemorrhage separation of the placenta is usually due to some pre-existing
abnormality and not to the stress of a normal labour. Since there was no
obvious cause of death in the “ unknown ” cases, it seems more likely that they
should belong to the second than to the first class.
On a conservative estimate, therefore, in at least 60 per cent, of the cases,
there is little or no hope of reducing the stillbirth rate by better obstetrics in
the narrow sense of care of the woman during labour. This view is strengthened
by studies which have included observations on the time of death. In Campbell
and McKinlay’s (1929) study, from 22 to 45 per cent, of deaths were stated
to have occurred before the onset of labour. Eden (1931) considers that
the evidence from hospitals indicates that about 50 per cent, of stillborn
infants die before labour begins and Dunham et al. (1938) record a still higher
proportion, namely 58 per cent.
Hospital Data : The above analysis may be compared with a similar
analysis of stillbirths at the Aberdeen Maternity Hospital during the years
1938-42. These have been divided into full-time and premature births, and
" booked ” are distinguished from “ emergency ” cases.f (Table 30.)
* These tables were prepared from the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar-General for
1939. Since this was written, it has been possible to consult the Annual Reports for 1939
and 1940. From these it appears that more than half of the “ other specified causes ”
should be classed with causes pre-existing at birth. This would increase slightly the per-
centage of cases in this class.
t It has been stated on page 22 that hospital data do not represent a cross section of
a community. This difficulty would be partly got over if hospitals conducting antenatal

clinics separated in their records “ booked ’’ cases from “ emergencies.” For instance, at
Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, " booked ” cases represent the working-class population
attending antenatal clinics, including an excess of primiparae, those with known complica-
tions and those from the poorest and most crowded homes, leaving an excess of later
births and of uncomplicated deliveries to domiciliary midwifery in the better homes.
“ Emergency ” cases represent selected sick or otherwise abnormal women from those
not attending antenatal clinics. The cases not included in these categories or cared for at
nursing homes, where the experience will be similar to that of the hospital, would there-
fore be expected to show a mortality lower than that of the city as a whole and still lower
than that of the hospital. Rough calculations show this to be true, although accurate
comparisons could not be made without an ad hoc survey.

The booked cases with a stillbirth rate of 30-3, that is less than three-fourths
of the Scottish rate of 42 in 1939, show a shift from hazards to pre-existing
causes in the distribution of deaths. The difference is almost entirely due to
reduction of deaths from the hazards of birth, but, when it is recalled that the
hospital population is to some extent selected, the reduction in deaths due to
maternal abnormality is probably greater than appears. The case records
suggest that little further improvement can be obtained by obstetrical skill since
most of the deaths were associated with very prolonged labour due to uterine
dysfunction. The proportion of deaths from hazards of birth is higher in the
emergency cases, although still substantially less than that in the general
Scottish distribution. Many of these deaths could have been avoided if the
patients had been admitted to hospital sooner. On the basis of the booked
hospital cases, it might be inferred that the Scottish rate could be reduced
from 42 (in 1939) to 33 by better obstetrics and by better supervision so that
admission of complicated cases to hospital is not too late.
Turning to the conditions pre-existing at birth, in order to compare the
relative incidence of causes of death, these have been expressed as percentages
of the total number of cases in this group. The result is shown in Table 31.
In the original analysis of Scottish stillbirths (Table 28), 9-5 per cent, were
classified under " cause unknown.” In the Aberdeen booked hospital cases,
32 per cent, of the total were so classified. Hence the more accurate certification
possible in hospital has not reduced but increased the proportion of unexplained
stillbirths. It is probable that most of the deaths in the “ ill defined ” group in
the Scottish analysis should be added to the “ cause unknown ” total, and Table
31 shows that this would bring the two distributions into close agreement on
this point. It appears, therefore, that, while the immediate cause of death
should be ascertained by post-mortem examination in every case where that is
possible, this in itself will neither help to define a larger number of causes nor
directly to lower the stillbirth rate.
Antepartum haemorrhage and toxaemia are in many cases the immediate
causes of death but they are not, strictly speaking, primary causes. They are
themselves due to causes which are unknown. Hence the total of stillbirths
due to unknown causes is much higher than appears from the classification and
more progress in reducing stillbirths is likely to result from studying the ante-
natal condition of mothers in areas where the stillbirth rate is low than from
intensification of pathological and bacteriological studies after the child is dead.
On the other hand, the data for the selected sick show a striking divergence
from the other distributions with large excesses of stillbirths due to placenta
prsevia and toxaemia. It is obvious that a proportion of these stillbirths could
be prevented by earlier diagnosis and treatment.
Incidence and Effect of Prematurity : A comparison of Scottish with
other data (Table 32) shows the incidence of prematurity and its effect on the
rates.

It is impossible to make reliable deductions from the hospital figures without
information on the nature of the hospital experience. The relative proportions
of booked and emergency cases will greatly influence the general rate. This is
shown by the Aberdeen figures where the incidence and the effect of prematurity
in booked cases approach most nearly to the American. The other extreme is
shown by Glasgow Maternity Hospital where a high proportion of the births
are in selected abnormal and emergency cases. In contrast with the stillbirth
rate of 108 for those delivered in hospital, the Outdoor Service of the Hospital,
dealing with the normal residuum of the cases under supervision, recorded in
the same year 3,202 births with only 77 stillbirths, i.e. 26 per 1,000. With these
reservations, the incidence of prematurity in Scottish hospital experience
appears to be higher than in America. The increases in stillbirth rate due to
prematurity are in all instances substantial, though less than for neonatal deaths.
Further valuable evidence of the importance, for survival to birth and after,
of antenatal development is given in Peckham’s study. Fig. 5, relating to white
single births, is reproduced from his paper.
It shows that, for weights up to 1,200 g. (2-6 lb.), a falling stillbirth rate was
compensated by a rising neonatal mortality, so that the two together remained
stationary at about 90 per cent, of births. From 1,200 g. to 2,500 g. (5-5 lb.)
both rates decreased, neonatal more rapidly than stillbirth, but the rates were
not stabilised until the weight reached between 2,700 and 2,800 g. (about 6 lb.).
At this stage of development, the stillbirth rate was about 25 per 1,000 total
births and the neonatal death rate 9 per 1,000 live births.
Holland is the only country in which the stillbirth rate has reached Peck-


ham's stabilised weight level. New Zealand and Canada are approaching it.
The best population groups in these countries have possibly reached a level

CHAPTER 7—ASSOCIATIONS WITH HIGH STILLBIRTH RATE
General : The conditions associated with high stillbirth rate are, in
general, the same as those associated with high neonatal rate and high total
infant mortality, namely poverty, poor housing and sanitation, overcrowding,
relatively high birth rate and poor diet. All of these must clearly affect the
health of the mother.
Age and Parity : In addition, information is available on the distribution
of stillbirths according to the age of the mother and the order of birth. The
rates shown in Table 33 have been calculated from the data in the Registrar-
General's Statistical Review of England and Wales for 1938.
The stillbirth rate is relatively high in the first pregnancy, least in the second
and thereafter rises with each pregnancy. The rate is least in women under
twenty-five years of age and, in each parity, it rises with age. Similar tables

prepared by the Registrar-General for Scotland for 1939 and 1940 deal with a
much smaller total of stillbirths but suggest the same general trend.

42 per cent, of the primiparae were under 25 years of age.
It would be in accordance, Peckham says, with general belief to assume that
the increase in stillbirths with age and parity, after the second birth, is due
partly at least to increase in premature births. But Peckham’s analysis lends
little support to this view. In his records there was no evidence of an increase
in incidence of prematurity before the age of thirty-five, or before the tenth
pregnancy. The viability of the foetus must therefore be reduced with increasing
age of the mother and repeated pregnancies, even if it is not born before it
reaches 5| lb. weight.
The age and parity distribution in the Aberdeen study, for which the
mortality rates were shown in Table 27, are shown in Table 34.
In the combined upper middle class groups, there was a much higher per-
centage of first, and fewer later pregnancies than among the hospital cases. The
average, age of the primigravidae was also much higher. From the Registrar-
General’s distribution (Table 33), stillbirth rates of about 39 for the upper
middle class group and 35 for the hospital group would be expected, compared
with actual rates of 26 and 30. Hence both are below expectation from the
distribution for England and Wales as a whole ; the middle-class group very
much below, in spite of a relatively unfavourable age and parity composition.

The advantages of superior physique and health more than compensate for the
other disadvantages.
How far, then, can unfavourable age and parity be held responsible for the
excess stillbirths in Scotland ? To answer this question, the data shown in
Table 35 have been assembled. The Registrar-General gives the age and parity
distribution of all births in the areas shown, but not the stillbirth rates by age
and parity for the separate areas. A comparison has therefore been made on
the assumption that the rates would be the same as for England and Wales as
a whole.
The calculated English and Welsh rates differ only slightly from area to
area with a range from 36-4 to 38-7. Greater London, with a worse than average
age and parity distribution, has the lowest rate of all. Of the four other areas
with actual stillbirth rates below the average, three have better than average
distributions. Of the seven areas with rates above the average, four have better
and three worse than average distributions. Hence in England and Wales, there
is no obvious correlation between age and parity distribution and stillbirth rate.
In Scotland the age and parity distribution is more favourable to a low stillbirth
rate than in any of the English areas, but its actual rate is higher than any except
North IV and the two Welsh areas. This point is further illustrated by the
following table.

The two bad areas,North IV and Wales I, show an excess at all ages. Intheage
group 20 to 24 the excess over London or New York is 50 per cent. This cannot be
attributed to closeness of spacing of births and consequent higher average parity
because the general distribution shows no definite increase even with the fourth
birth in this age group. Hence there are influences operating in Wales and the
North of England which increase the stillbirth rate even between the ages of
twenty and twenty-four when the prospects are best. Since these are depressed
areas, the influences most likely to be responsible for the excess mortality are
poor physique of the mother, poor diet during pregnancy and probably a poor
standard of obstetric care.
Illegitimacy : The next table shows the effect of illegitimacy on the stillbirth
rate in England and Wales.
The difference between legitimate and illegitimate stillbirth rates is less than
that between the corresponding mortalities of live-born infants (Table 22, p. 31).
Although the rates for illegitimate births are, on the average, about 20 to 25
per cent, above those for legitimate, the total effect is to increase the stillbirth
rate by only 0-5 per 1,000 births.
SUMMARY OF PART TWO
1. Scotland shows an excess of stillbirths, in comparison with such countries as
New Zealand and Holland, of the same order as the excess of neonatal
deaths. *
2. The excess has the same regional distribution as that of later infant deaths.
It is highly probable that the occupational, or social, distribution is
also the same.
3. Looking at the causes of stillbirth in Scotland generally, it is noted that in
1939, when the stillbirth rate was 42 per 1,000 total births, 38 per cent,
were attributed to hazards of birth and 62 per cent, to abnormalities
pre-existing in the mothers. During the five years 1938-1942 the
stillbirth rate in booked cases at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital (with
some adverse selection) was only 30 per 1,000. Of these, 20 per cent,
were classed under hazards of birth and 80 per cent, under pre-existing
conditions. The difference between the general rate and the Aberdeen
Hospital rate is due chiefly to reduction at the Hospital of deaths due
to the hazards of birth.


4. A study of stillbirths in " emergency ” cases admitted to Maternity Hospitals
shows that more of the deaths are associated with pre-existing
abnormal conditions in the mother than with the hazards of birth.
In the Aberdeen Maternity Hospital the proportions are 74 and 26 per
cent. In the group of stillbirths attributed to pre-existing abnormali-
ties, half were associated with severe toxaemia and in many of these
cases the antenatal care was poor. In the group attributed to - the
hazards of birth, many of the deaths could have been avoided if the
women had been sent to hospital earlier. Many stillbirths could
therefore be avoided by better antenatal supervision and obstetric care.
5. It is calculated that greater obstetrical skill throughout the country should
reduce the Scottish stillbirth rate to 33 and the extension of antenatal
care should further reduce the general rate below that of the Aberdeen
Hospital booked cases (because they are a selected group) ; i.e. to less
than 30. In the same area, the stillbirth rate in specialist practice was
only 11 per 1,000 and this seems to represent the basic rate attainable
under really good conditions.
6. The difference between the hospital booked population and specialist practice
is explained by prolonged labour due to uterine dysfunction on the
one hand and by unknown causes, toxaemia, accidental haemorrhage
and prematurity on the other. The data for stillbirths support the
contention in Part I that the incidence of premature birth in Scotland
is high.
7. Since the incidence of all these known and unexplained conditions is so much
less among the well-to-do, it seems probable that the primary difference
lies in the health of the mothers. And health, in this sense, implies
better feeding and more rest during the pregnancy, in addition to the
better physique which results from good feeding and environment
from birth.
8. No other significant adverse influence was found. The age and parity
distribution, in spite of the relatively high birth rate in Scotland, is
favourable to a low mortality rate and the effect of illegitimacy is
negligible.

PART THREE
THE FEEDING OF MOTHERS AND INFANTS
CHAPTER 8—THE DIETS OF MOTHERS
The General Position : It was shown by Orr in 1936 that the adequacy
of diets in the United Kingdom closely parallels the economic status of groups
of the population. This was confirmed by the later Carnegie U.K. dietary survey
(unpublished) and by numerous other surveys of particular groups. In general,
the quality of the diet is reflected in the stature and health of the consumers.
These observations have shown that, in the United Kingdom, few diets
reach the standards recently prescribed as optimal for health, and as many as
30 per cent, may be seriously deficient in several respects. The most common
deficiencies are of calcium and vitamins A and C. It is a common observation
in poor families that, where food is short, the mothers deprive themselves for
the other members of the family. Hence, whenever it has been found that a diet
is inadequate for the family as a whole, it will usually be true that the mother
will suffer most.
Ad hoc Surveys : Few surveys of the diet of pregnant or nursing women
individually have been made. The results of one such, on 120 pregnant women
in England in 1938 (McCance et al.), are shown below in Table 38 in terms of
foods eaten. For comparison, Table 39 gives the allowances of foods recom-
mended in 1936 by the League of Nations Technical Commission, in 1939 by
Stiebeling (moderate cost diet) and in 1941 by Tisdall et al. Table 40 shows
the analyses of the diets in terms of a number of constituents, and Table 41 the
allowances proposed in 1941 by the U.S. National Research Council. It is plain
that in all classes (Table 38) the consumption of milk, cheese, fruit and vege-
tables falls short of the amounts considered by authorities to be desirable.
The usual social gradient in quality of diet is shown and the diets of the lowest
income group fall below the standard for foods in all items except cereals and fats.
These differences in food consumption are reflected in the composition of
the diets. The recommended allowance of 2,500 Calories is for the second half
of pregnancy. Since McCance’s survey included pregnancies between three and

nine months, without details of the distribution, it is impossible to say whether
deficit of energy was common. It seems possible that the three lower groups
were insufficiently nourished. Only the two highest groups approached the
standard for protein and iron, and only the highest for calcium. The supply of
vitamins A, B and C was inadequate except perhaps in the highest group, the
position becoming progressively worse towards the lowest income group. The
diets of the lower income groups would also provide less than the optimal
amount of riboflavin and other components of the vitamin B 2 complex.
Similar observations on the diet of 200 pregnant women have been made by
Williams and Fralin (1942) in the United States, and the analyses of these diets
also show a social gradient, with undernourishment and deficiency of calcium,
iron and vitamins, more marked in the lower cost diets. According to their
assessment the deficiency of riboflavin was of the same order as the deficiencies
of vitamins A and C.
We have not been able to find individual dietary surveys of nursing mothers,
except for professional wet nurses in America, where diets were supervised and
of high quality. But, since the requirements for lactation are greater in all
respects than those for pregnancy, it is most probable that the deficiencies are
the same. Even if total food intake is increased, as it must be to maintain milk
production, it is unlikely that the quality of the diet habitually eaten would be
substantially changed. It would be most likely to deteriorate from increase in
consumption of bread, sugar and fat, without increase in protective foods.
Correlation with Infant Mortality : Confirmation that tjiese findings
apply also in Scotland and, in addition, that deficiencies are correlated with
stillbirth and prematurity is afforded by a survey in Glasgow by Graham and
Cameron (unpublished) in 1942 of the diets of 300 mothers, of whom 100 had
stillborn infants, 100 premature live-born infants and 100 full-term live infants.
The results are shown in Table 42. The first half of the table shows the require-
ments and the values of the diets as recorded. The second half compares the
quality of the diets if all the women had eaten amounts of the same foods to
give the energy requirement of 2,500 Calories.

Statistical analysis of the data showed that the difference between the diets
of mothers with full-term infants and mothers with premature infants was
significant but not that between mothers with live premature and stillborn
infants.
Due allowance must be made for the fact that these surveys were by question-
naire and not by weighing all food eaten. But the agreement with other accurate
surveys, such as that of McCance et al. quoted above, and with the observations
of Wills et al. (1942) on nurses, indicates that the figures are, without doubt, of
the correct order.
These women had not increased their food intake during the last trimester
of pregnancy, as they ought to have done. In relation to the accepted require-
ments for this period, they were all underfed and the mothers of premature and
dead infants seriously so.
The second part of the table shows that if, without change of diet, they had
all eaten enough food to provide their energy requirement of 2,500 Calories, the
diets of the mothers of full-term babies would then have been adequate in
protein, calcium and vitamin B 1 only slightly deficient in iron, but still deficient
in the other vitamins. The other diets all have less protein and fat and more
carbohydrate ; less calcium and iron and an appreciably greater deficiency of
vitamins A and C.
In comparison with accepted standards, therefore, the diets of poor mothers
in general are characterised by low energy value, low protein content and
deficiency of calcium, iron, vitamins A and C and riboflavin. This does not
complete the list of deficiencies but enumerates only those definitely known.
Correlation with Poor Housing : It has been shown above that infant
mortality rates vary with social class, that is to say, rise as poverty increases and
diet deteriorates. High mortality rates are also associated with poor and insani-
tary housing and overcrowding. McGonigle and Kirby (1936) in Stockton-on-
Tees found that the infant mortality rate during the five-year period following
rehousing was insignificantly less than that in the control slum area. Both areas
showed a notable reduction during that period. Child mortality at later ages
was relatively higher in the rehoused area. McGonigle attributed the dis-
appointing results to deterioration of diet due to the increased overhead costs
of living in the new area. Experience has been similar in some but not all other
areas. In some the influence of poor housing per se on mortality rates cannot be
denied. In Glasgow experience has shown that by rehousing alone the death
rate in young children from respiratory diseases can in some instances be
reduced by more than half while the incidence of the commoner infectious
diseases is materially reduced.
CHAPTER 9 —THE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF POOR
MATERNAL DIET
A brief review of the effect of diet on pregnancy in animals and the survival
of the young after birth is presented in Appendix 2. The implications for human
pregnancy and infant mortality are considered here.
Underfeeding : In comparison with the accepted standard, the energy
value of the poorer diets discussed above is low for the last part of pregnancy,
and this remains so even if the standard requirement be reduced to correspond
with the low average non-pregnant weight of poorer women. No sufficiently
careful combined dietary and clinical study has been made from which the effect
of such underfeeding could be assessed. It is unlikely that it would noticeably
affect the birth weight, for, except in extreme deprivation, the foetus will grow
at the expense of the mother’s body. An effect on birth weight is most likely to
be seen in young primigravidse where the mother’s body may compete against

the foetus for nourishment or in multiple pregnancy where the total foetal
demands are high.
The effect of underfeeding in pregnancy is most likely to be shown in failure
to lay down reserves in preparation for lactation, without which lactation will
be initiated but not maintained. The magnitude of the reserves that can be laid
down in subjects with poor nutritional histories is shown in a recent study by
Hummel et al. (1937). Underfeeding has been deliberately practised, and even
recommended by doctors, in order to restrict birth weight. Apart from the fact
that the attempt is unlikely to be successful, its probable effect on lactation
makes it undesirable. Milk production can be maintained at the expense of the
mother’s body only for a short time and with serious effects on her health.
Deficiency of Protein : Restriction of protein intake in pregnancy was for
long, and sometimes still is, considered desirable as a means of restricting
the formation of “ toxic ” products in the blood and preventing " toxaemia.”
There is no scientific evidence to support this practice. Albuminuria is not
evidence of excess protein intake and more success appears to have been achieved
in the control of the toxaemias of pregnancy by a well-balanced diet of high
protein content (see below, p. 53, Toxaemia).
Further, storage of protein during pregnancy is necessary for the successful
establishment of lactation and a relatively high protein intake during lactation
is necessary to maintain milk yield.
Lack of Calcium and Vitamin D : In the extreme case, lack of calcium or
vitamin D during pregnancy results in osteomalacia in the mother and foetal
rickets in the child. With lesser degrees of deficiency the foetal skeleton will be
normally calcified at the expense of the maternal, but this process cannot be
often repeated without injury to the mother or foetus or both. It is probable
that with repeated, closely spaced pregnancies on diets of low calcium content,
the standard of calcification of the infant’s skeleton at birth deteriorates. Such
drafts on the maternal skeleton will, in each pregnancy, prejudice the coming
lactation because it appears to be impossible to absorb and retain sufficient
calcium, even when it is available in the diet, to provide, from current supplies,
for a high milk yield. Skeletal reserves are necessary. Milk yield is strictly
limited by the amount available from diet and reserves. The vitamin D content
of breast milk, which is of importance for postnatal skeletal calcification,
depends on the maternal supply from sunshine or a vitamin D concentrate such
as cod liver oil.
Iron Deficiency : Anaemia due to iron deficiency is common in women of
the working class and when women who have borne children are compared with
women of the same age who have not, the anaemia is, at all ages, greater in the
mothers. The average iron supply in working-class diets is, therefore, inadequate
for Ihe needs of women in general and the demands of reproduction are greater
than the menstrual losses. Apart from the depletion of the iron reserves of the
young adult, it is not certain that pregnancy has any effect on blood formation.
During pregnancy the degree of anaemia appears to be intensified by dilution of
the blood which is said to be maximal during the eighth month. In spite of this,
the haemoglobin level of pregnant women can be maintained at about .90 per cent,
of that of the healthy non-pregnant adult by a balanced diet providing about
15 mg. of iron daily. This is shown, for instance, in Chapter 8, Table 40 above.
If the diet is not altered, it is more difficult to prevent or cure the condition
and opinion differs as to the medicinal doses of iron required. Indeed, some
observers, failing to effect a cure with medicinal iron, have suggested that the
anaemia is physiological. There is no real basis for this view. The secretory
activity of the stomach is profoundly affected by poor diets and iron absorption
may be so reduced as to make repair of the anaemia very slow.
It is impossible to state definitely whether iron deficiency anaemia in the
mother affects blood formation in the foetus or its viability at birth. But there
is no doubt that it has a great effect on the strength and vigour of the mother,
on her ability to care for the infant and hence on the infant’s prospects of life
and health.
Vitamin A Deficiency : There is no clinical information to show the effect


of deficiency of vitamin A on the development of the human foetus and its
healthy survival to birth but it is certain that, where the mother’s diet is of low
vitamin A content, the infant will start life without reserves. Indeed, there
appears to be difficulty in getting vitamin A through the placenta to the foetus
and this renders the infant after birth all the more dependent on an adequate
supply in the milk. Colostrum is much richer in vitamin A than later milk and
is of special importance for that reason. The amount of vitamin Ain colostrum
and milk depends on both the mother’s reserves and the current supply in her
diet. Reserves accumulated during pregnancy would, therefore, be passed on to
the infant after birth, even if they cannot be passed through the placenta.
Deficiency of Vitamins and B 2 Complex : There is no clinical evidence
to distinguish the effect of minor degrees of deficiency of vitamin B x in human
pregnancy. But there is an important clinical aspect of deficiency of the
vitamin B 2 complex. The occurrence of macrocytic anaemia in pregnancy has
been recognised for several years in tropical countries but, until more recently,
the only type of anaemia of pregnancy in temperate regions was supposed to be
microcytic and due solely to deficiency of iron. American workers within the
past few years have, with increasing frequency, reported macrocytic anaemia as
a not insignificant part of the anaemia of pregnant women. Within the last five
years reports have been made on the same subject from Glasgow (Stevenson,
1938), Edinburgh (Davidson et al., 1942), Aberdeen (Fullerton, 1943), Newcastle
(Ungley, 1938 ; Miller and Studdert, 1942) and Burton-on-Trent (Lescher, 1942).
Bamum and Woodward (1938), from a review of the published data, esti-
mated the incidence of macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy to be about 29 per 1,000
births in India and lin 10,000 births in the temperate zone. There cam be no
doubt that both are underestimates because the condition is not commonly
recognised and the diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation. It has been so
little studied that it is not properly differentiated from the so-called “ toxaemias ”
and other conditions with which, Miller reports, it is confused.
The onset is usually about the seventh month, but the patients may not be
seen until after delivery when they may be sent to hospital as cases of puerperal
sepsis. Pyrexia is usual; gastro-intestinal symptoms with severe prolonged
vomiting are prominent; there may be oedema. Other symptoms of deficiency
of vitamin B 2 complex are sore tongue and paraesthesiae. The confusion in
diagnosis with toxaemia and puerperal sepsis, combined with the fact that
spontaneous recovery may occur after delivery, suggests that the incidence may
be much higher than is thought.
The condition as seen hitherto, that is in its more severe form, is grave.
Barnum and Woodward report that death of the foetus in utero is common, but
if the child is born alive its prospects are good. In nineteen of the twenty-three
cases studied in Newcastle, dietary histories were procured, and in seven of these
there was gross deficiency of protein and vitamins. The condition is cured by
administration of rich sources of the vitamin B 2 complex and there seems little
doubt that general improvement of the diet of pregnant women or prophylactic
supplements of such rich sources as liver and yeast would obviate the occurrence
of the disease.
Deficiency of Vitamin C : Deficiency of vitamin C is not known to affect
directly the course of human pregnancy but it may have indirect effects, for
instance, on the absorption of iron. An abundant supply during lactation is, of
course, required for the health of the infant.
Toxaemia. The etiology of the toxaemias of pregnancy is not understood.
There may be more than one type, or other little-known conditions, such as
macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy, may be classed under toxaemia. It is reason-
ably suggested that toxaemia may be due to endocrine imbalance and attempts,
alleged to have had some success, have been made to control and cure it by
treatment with different hormones. The obvious association with poor diet of
the condition (or conditions) known as toxaemia has caused some writers to class
“ toxaemia ” as a deficiency disease (Mcllroy, 1934 ; Theobald, 1937). This is
justifiable in as far as the manifestations can be controlled by diet. It has, until
recently, been common practice to restrict the protein intake of toxaemic patients

to very low levels with the idea that this would control the hypertension and
albuminuria. Recently American workers (Strauss, 1935, 1937, and others)
have recommended a high protein intake. De Snoo (1937, 1938) in Holland
advocates elimination of salt from the diet. There is an increasing weight of
testimony from America that this treatment is helpful. Some American
advocates have elaborated and extended the principle involved. Medicaments
containing sodium are prohibited and the elimination of sodium from the body
speeded by giving ammonium chloride. The diet is supplemented with vitamin
concentrates, especially the B vitamins (Anderson, 1940 ; Strauss, 1937, 1939).
It is not claimed that this treatment prevents the occurrence of toxaemia
but that it greatly improves the clinical condition and reduces the associated
mortality. Two independent observations (Wadlow, 1940; Pomerance and
Daichman, 1940) have also been made that unsalted diet improves uterine
contractions and reduces both the duration and the distress of labour.
The several deficiencies of poor diets have been discussed separately but, in
fact, they do not occur separately. The diets of poor mothers are such that they
suffer from multiple deficiencies, of which now one, now another, may appear
dominant because of individual idiosyncrasies of diet or differences in physio-
logical constitution. The treatment of obvious symptoms with single drugs or
vitamins may be abortive because of the other deficiencies, or may even unmask
further deficiency. There is only one correct treatment and that is by adequate
and well-balanced diet. The suggested prophylactic treatment of toxaemia by
high protein, unsalted diet is probably in a different class and aims at counter-
acting a metabolic upset which the previous diet was unable to control.
Experiments with Supplemented Diets ; There are three experiments to
be discussed under this heading. The first (Williams, 1936-1938) began under
the control of the National Birthday Trust in the Rhondda Valley in 1935. The
initial experiments aimed at determining whether additional food, medicine or
nursing care would favourably affect the high maternal mortality in that area.
The experiment was extended, by a Committee of the Joint Council of Midwifery,
to other areas in Wales, to County Durham and other depressed areas in the
following two years and, in 1936, a revised scheme of investigation was prepared
in co-operation with representatives from the Medical Research Council. For
the first fifteen months under the revised plan, which covered areas in North-
umberland, including Newcastle-on-Tyne, Durham and Glamorgan, 11,000
mothers were given supplementary foods and 25,000 were recorded as controls.
In the fed group the combined stillbirth and infant mortality rate was 58 per
1,000 total births ; in the unfed group, 85. Within the latter group, the sub-
group attending clinics had a combined rate of 71 and the others a rate of 92.
The second study was made in Toronto (Ebbs et al., 1942). There were three
groups of pregnant women : one of 120 on poor diets, not altered during the
period of observation ; one of 90 on similar diets, supplemented by foods and

vitamins provided by the clinic in charge of the experiment; and a third of 170
women on moderately good diets, who were given advice on how to improve their
diets. The supplements were given for four or five months before confinement
and for four weeks after the women left the hospital. They consisted of 30 oz.
milk, 1 oz. cheese, 1 egg, 1 orange and 3| oz. canned tomatoes daily with wheat
germ and capsules containing viosterol. The course of pregnancy was rated as
excellent or good in 66 per cent, of those on the poor diet, 94 per cent, of those
receiving supplements and 85 per cent, of those given advice only. The incidence
of abnormalities is shown in Table 43.
The birth weights and weights at six months, the rating during the first
two weeks and the rating of milk production by the mothers are shown in
Table 44.
Morbidity during the first six months was much less in infants of the
mothers on good diets than in those from mothers on the poor diet. There were
three deaths in the poor group ; none in the other two.
The third study was made in 1938 and 1939 by a Committee of the People’s
League of Health. The diets of a large number of women attending antenatal
hospital clinics were assessed by questionnaire and, in agreement with what was
said above about the diets of the poor, were found to be most frequently deficient
in calcium, iron and vitamins A and C. The women were divided by alternate
allocation into two groups, excluding those who were not in good health or who
were within sixteen weeks of term. Supplements were given to one group of
iron, calcium and small amounts of iodine, manganese and copper ; vitamins
Bj and B 2 complex, ascorbic acid and halibut liver oil. The subjects totalled
2,510 receiving supplements and 2,511 controls.
There was a difference, claimed as significant, in the incidence of toxaemia
(albuminuria) and premature births in favour of the supplemented group.
These experiments are criticised by competent critics as lacking statistical
significance. If this be true, it is not surprising because the periods of study
have been relatively short and superimposed on long periods of poor or bad
feeding. It would be more surprising if there were a dramatic effect on a process
like pregnancy, the success of which must obviously depend so largely on the
maternal constitution and reserves. And, in any case, the social groups to
which reference has so often been made above, themselves provide a lifelong
experiment, of which the results are highly significant.

CHAPTER 10 —THE FEEDING OF INFANTS
General Considerations : Infants spend their lives almost entirely within
the restricted environment of their home. Their chances of survival depend
largely on the kind of home into which they are born. Evidence has been
presented in Part I, p. 28, to show that the high infant mortality in Scotland
is associated with overcrowding in houses that are old and insanitary, often
without indoor water supply. Such conditions increase the concentration of
infective material in the home and make the hazards to infants acute. It is
in these homes, too, that the mothers are ill-nourished and most liable to give
birth to premature and weak babies, ill-equipped for the environment into
which they are born. A large part of the infant population, therefore, starts
life handicapped both by antenatal conditions and by the physical environment
after birth.
It is generally recognised that diet has a profound influence on resistance to
certain types of infection, mostly of the gastro-intestinal and respiratory tracts.
It is extremely important, therefore, considering the conditions just described,
to inquire into the feeding of infants in Scotland.
Breast Feeding : It will not be disputed that, provided the milk is ade-
quate in quantity and of good quality, breast feeding is best both for infant
and mother. The findings reported in the last two chapters suggest that the
diets of mothers may often be inadequate to support a sufficient yield of milk
and that, since the vitamin content of milk depends on the mother’s diet and
reserves, breast milk may often be deficient in essential vitamins. Information
has therefore been sought on the incidence of breast feeding in Scotland and
the health of Scottish infants.
A number of recent studies of the incidence of breast feeding in England
and Scotland are summarised in Table 45.
There is no indication in these sample surveys that the establishment of
breast feeding at two weeks is less frequent in Scotland or that lactation is less
well maintained than in England. Nor is the incidence of breast feeding higher
in the two areas of relatively low mortality, Ilford and Newbiggin, than in the
others.

The data collected in Table 46 suggest that there may have been a decline
over a period of years, probably not in the rate of establishment but in the
maintenance of breast feeding, and this would be in accord with continental
records. Yet, during this period there has been a reduction of infant mortality
so that, if the decline of breast feeding is real and significant, the effect has
been offset by other changes.
More important evidence is afforded by two studies of the incidence of
breast feeding in relation to social class (Table 47). The percentage of lactations
established is highest in Aberdeen’s well-to-do subjects and about equal in
Ilford, in both districts, and the Aberdeen poor district. The big difference is
in the maintenance of lactation. The well-to-do Aberdeen women, who were
possibly of higher economic class than the Ilford good district, were outstand-
ingly successful and the Aberdeen poor district outstandingly unsuccessful.
It appears from these three tables that the endocrine regulation at parturi-
tion is sufficient in at least 70 per cent, of cases to initiate lactation. The
proportion is certainly higher than 70 and probably at least 90 per cent., because
a number of lactations are spoiled by mismanagement at so early a stage that
they would not appear at two weeks. This is illustrated by a recent special
study of the histories of 100 consecutive infants admitted to Edinburgh Sick
Children’s Hospital (McNeil, unpublished data). In 28 cases, breast feeding
had been given up by three days after birth. At two weeks of age 39 infants,
at three months 58, and at six months 76 were no longer breast fed. In 13 out
of the 28 cases where breast feeding was given up between birth and three days,
the excuse was “ lack of milk," but, at that time, lactation is only being initiated
and it is impossible to judge whether it would be successful or not.
There is no information to show in what proportion of cases failure to
establish lactation can be attributed to the premature ending of pregnancy or


to abnormal conditions of the mother during pregnancy, but McNeil’s data
suggest that many of these failures are due to misdirection by doctors and
nurses who are ignorant of the principles of lactation.
If a satisfactory flow of milk has once been established, either dietary or
environmental causes may be responsible for failure to maintain it. It has
already been shown that underfeeding and defective diet will affect milk
production. There is no doubt, too, that fluctuations in the frequency and dura-
tion of breast feeding are sometimes due to extraneous circumstances. The
medical profession has not insisted enough on the advantages of breast feeding.
There is no provision for employed women, who must work, to feed their
infants. Hence breast feeding may be more frequent when unemployment
among women is common and show a spurious correlation with periods of
adversity. It has been shown by Robinson (1939) in Liverpool that the incid-
ence of breast feeding among women, and especially primiparse, living in houses
of their own was higher than among those living with relatives or in sublet
rooms. Similar observations have been made in other areas. It is difficult to
distinguish such circumstances from the “ lack of will ” to suckle with which
mothers are so often reproached.
Summing up these findings, it does not at once appear from the samples
examined that the incidence of breast feeding is less, or that lactation is less
well maintained, in Scotland than in England with its lower infant mortality
rate. The effects of poor diet and poor environment appear clearly in the social
class difference in the maintenance of lactation demonstrated in Ilford and
Aberdeen. Hence, since we have seen that there is much more poverty, and
hence poor diet, and bad housing in Scotland, the presumption is that, all over,
there will be a smaller proportion of successful lactations. Merely to say that
an infant is breast fed is not necessarily to say that it is well fed. Both quantity
and quality of milk must also be adequate to meet the requirements of growth
and resistance to disease, and we have already seen that the diets of poor
mothers are inadequate both in quantity and quality.
The Special Problem of the Premature Infant : Breast feeding is of even
greater importance for the premature than for the full-term infant. Growth
is most rapid during the last three months of pregnancy. At full-term the
infant’s tissues are mature to meet the conditions of separate existence ;
in particular, the digestive system is ready to deal with food. In the premature
infant, the digestive glands are not fully developed and the infant is not ready
to be given food by the mouth (McNeil, 1942). The premature infant is also
specially susceptible to infection. Hence anything that serves to protect it from
the risk of infection and to ease the work of digestion assumes special importance.
For these reasons, panels of wet nurses or breast milk depots have been
established in many continental and American cities. The milk is reserved for
premature and sick infants. Experience on a small scale in Aberdeen has shown
the great value of provision of breast milk for prematures, but there is no organ-
ised service of this type in Scotland.
Bottle Feeding : It will be shown in the next chapter that the general
decline in infant mortality rate, which began early in this century, coincided
with the beginning of systematic efforts to improve the artificial feeding of
infants. The risk of infection is much greater when infants are fed on cow’s
milk which may not be clean from the start and may be further contaminated
in handling. Successful bottle feeding, therefore, requires constant and careful
attention to hygiene. The danger of infection is minimised by the use of dried
milk but, even then, dishes, bottles and teats require sterilisation. Where the
facilities are poor and instruction lacking, the danger of infection is greatest.
When the infant is breast fed, its food intake is regulated by the supply ;
when it is bottle fed a standard is necessary, and careful instruction is required
on how to adjust the amount of food to the needs of the infant. Obviously,
where the mother is not under medical supervision or in constant touch with a
Welfare Clinic, the adjustment is likely to be faulty.
The change from breast to bottle feeding may give rise to serious trouble
also, because the occurrence of constipation and vomiting maybe misinterpreted


by the inexperienced mother as meaning that “ the baby’s digestion is weak,”
when the real fault is underfeeding. The infant fails to thrive and the feed is
further reduced. Finally infection, respiratory or alimentary, supervenes and
produces the marasmic infant with an acute infection so frequently seen in the
wards of children’s hospitals. In a study at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children,
Glasgow, covering a year from Ist September 1940 to Ist September 1941,
Graham (unpublished data) found that two-thirds of the infants examined
(295 eases) did not attain 90 per cent., and one-fifth did not attain even 70 per
cent, of their expected weight for age. The death rate in the latter group was
43-8 per cent. Although death in most instances was attributed to infection,
the chief underlying cause was probably malnutrition.
It is also true that, where mothers are not under adequate medical super-
vision or in contact with Welfare Clinics, the need for supplementation of
artificial feeds with iron, with cod liver oil to supply vitamins A and D and
with fruit juice to provide vitamin C is not recognised. The infant, artificially
fed without these supplements, is anaemic, develops rickets, and becomes
increasingly susceptible to respiratory and alimentary infections.
The Period from 5 to 12 Months of Age : It is generally agreed that the
transition from breast or bottle feeding to a mixed diet should begin not later
than the sixth month. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the change
must be to an adequate, balanced diet, providing all the necessary vitamins
and minerals. That means a diet including at least a pint of milk daily, with
egg or some form of meat, green vegetables and fruit, and with cod liver oil, at
least in winter.
The first additions to the milk diet are usually cereal products and in poor
families not adequately supervised the process of weaning too often consists of
reducing milk in favour of cereals and potatoes, without addition of other
protective foods. The undernourishment of bottle-fed babies in the earlier
period is often continued and, in the absence of the necessary supplements,
deficiency disease inevitably follows. In studies in the Glasgow area between
1938 and 1941 (Hutchison, 1938; Mclntosh and Morris, 1941), 70 per cent, of
infants attending Welfare Clinics between six and twelve months of age were
found to be anomic. Hutchison found breast-fed infants less anaemic than
bottle-fed, probably because a high proportion of the bottle-fed babies were
premature and of low birth weight. In Graham’s (unpublished) studies at the
Sick Children’s Hospital, Glasgow, at least one-quarter, and more probably as
many as one-half,* of the infants in this age group suffered from rickets.
In the presence of one or more of these conditions, underfeeding, anaemia
and rickets, probably associated with deficiency of vitamin A, infection occurs
and death is attributed to the infection. No mention is made, even by the
pathologist, of the underlying nutritional defects. Yet they are quite well
recognised and known to be preventable and, if they were prevented, infection
would be less likely to occur and less likely to prove fatal (Graham, 1940).
Hence, when stress is laid on the high infant death rate from infection in
Scotland, it must be clearly realised that there are two underlying causes,
excessive exposure due to poor housing and overcrowding, and deficient diet
leading to lack of resistance.
It is important and urgent that housing should be improved but, as has
appeared in studies of rehoused populations, the full benefit will not be reaped
unless the diet is also improved. Indeed, it should be possible, without the
delay that will be unavoidable in improving housing, to ensure that all infants
are fed in accordance with the full energy requirements for their age and with
such protective foods and supplements as will ensure prevention of the
malnutrition which predisposes to infection.

that the mother usually suffers most. Special studies of the diets of
pregnant women show that poor mothers have insufficient food and
that deficiencies of calcium, iron, vitamins A, C and the components
of the B a complex are common. In Glasgow, such diets have been
shown to be associated with prematurity and stillbirth. They must
also prejudice the chances of successful lactation and affect the quality
of breast milk. Since the proportion of the population living in poverty
in Scotland is high, the proportion of mothers inadequately fed will
also be high.
2. The correlation of such deficient diets with anaemia in pregnant women is
well known. The toxaemias of pregnancy, in general, may be to some
extent correlated with poor diet, and the experience of other countries
shows that their most serious clinical manifestations can at least be
controlled by diet. Three experiments with supplemented diets are
discussed, in which the incidence of stillbirths and of prematurity was
reduced and the health of the infants improved.
3. Breast milk is the best food for the young infant, but the production of milk
in adequate quantities and of high quality depends on the maternal
diet. Studies in Scotland show no difference from surveys in England
in the percentage of lactations initiated or the average period of breast
feeding, but social differences in respect of maintenance of lactation
suggest that in Scotland in general (because there is more poverty)
there may be an excess of unsatisfactory lactations of short duration.
4. Breast milk is of special importance for the premature infant. Experience
has shown its value but there is no organised breast milk service in
Scotland.
5. The artificial feeding of infants is not satisfactory and improvements in
practice are required.
6. The diet of infants after weaning is often lacking in protective foods.


PART FOUR
THE MEDICAL SERVICES
CHAPTER 11—MOTHER AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES
Historical: During the second half of last century, the general mortality in
Britain declined steadily but infant mortality showed no decrease. It seems
surprising that this should be so, over a period which showed a great increase in
national wealth, very substantial improvements in sanitation, in medical
education and services and in the general standard of living. That no decrease
in infant mortality rate occurred would appear to contradict what has been said
above about the importance of such improvements for the reduction of infant
mortality, but does not, in fact, do so.
There were two main reasons for what happened. First, sanitary improve-
ments were concerned chiefly with public sanitation and the conditions in
workshops; less with domestic conditions and, for instance, not at all with the
milk supply. Hence they affected infants less than other age groups. Second,
while national wealth grew and the general standard of living rose, there was
an increasing concentration of population in towns and cities and an increasing
differentiation into rich and poor. By the end of the century, although probably
there were nowhere conditions quite as bad as those described in the Reports of
the Medical Officer to the Privy Council for 1863 and 1864, and there was a small
proportion of the populatiou living under greatly improved conditions, there
was a much larger proportion living under bad conditions.
The same tendency has continued into recent times. Titmuss (1943) has
shown that in England and Wales between 1911 and 1931, i.e. between the
Registrar-General’s first and third decennial surveys, in spite of a substantial
further rise in the general standard of living and improvement in mortality in
all social classes, the gap between the rich and the poor had widened. Relative
stability of mortality rates may reflect not so much absence of progress as
differentiation, with the improvement in one section of a population offset by
deterioration in another. The rich both in England and Scotland have infant
mortality rates approaching the limit of what is attainable with present know-
ledge of how to control the environment. They buy the application of
knowledge. The poor in both countries suffer from the failure of society to
make that knowledge operative throughout the social structure. And Scotland
has now a much higher proportion of poverty in comparison with England or
her own past history.
A definite and steady decline of infant mortality in Europe began about the
end of last century, first in the more advanced of the continental countries and
a little later in England and Scotland. The beginning followed close on the first
systematic efforts to improve the artificial feeding of infants. These appeared
almost simultaneously in Oslo (1891), Paris (1892) and New York (1893) * in
the form of the provision of sterilised milk for babies. Oslo followed this in 1893
with arrangements for the supervision by the Public Health Department of
" foster children,” by arrangements in 1910 for the care of unmarried mothers,
by sickness insurance in 1911 and by a law in 1916 providing allowances to
mothers so that they could look after their babies for at least six months.
In 1899 the first milk depot in England was established. The first two in
Scotland were opened in Glasgow and Dundee in 1904. In 1906 the first infant
* There are no reliable records to show when and how infant mortality in the United
States began to fall.


welfare centre was started by a doctor in Battersea and in 1906 Glasgow
appointed a woman doctor to hold infant consultations at the milk depot.
Thus mother and child welfare began by tackling the most urgent and obvious
problem, the feeding of infants on dirty cow’s milk, when that was to be had,
or, when it was not, on substitutes which were nutritionally worse, and perhaps
little cleaner. As the supply of milk to towns improved, the need for these
depots, from the mother’s point of view, decreased and attendance dwindled.
Unfortunately, the supply improved more rapidly than the quality and the need
then became acute for education in the homes on the preparation, which, at
first, meant the sterilisation, of feeds.
A parallel line of development, not so closely related in time to the beginning
of the decline of infant mortality, took place on the sanitary side. In 1862 the
Ladies’ Sanitary Reform Association of Manchester appointed " a respectable
working woman to go from door to door among the poorer classes of the popula-
tion to teach and help them as opportunity offered.” This example was fol-
lowed by other towns, slowly at first, and more rapidly in the first five years of
this century, so that by 1905 about fifty towns in Great Britain had appointed
health visitors, or female sanitary inspectors as many of them were called.
From these dual beginnings, the mother and child welfare service developed.
It was first officially subsidised from public funds in 1914.
Comparison with Other Countries : It is difficult and of doubtful value
to make comparisons between the present Scottish services and those in other
countries because the nature of the services varies and detailed information is
difficult to procure, and because in countries with few socio-economic problems,
the need for public health services is less. Although the organisation is similar
in England and Wales, there are differences in detail. In most other countries
the type of organisation is so different that no useful detailed comparison can
be made (cf. Appendix 3, which gives a summary of the position in the United
States supplied by courtesy of the Director and Assistant Director of the
Children’s Bureau). In New Zealand, the history has been different from that
in this country (Official Year-books, 1926-1941; Director-General of Health,
1935 and 1942 ; Woodbury, 1926). The decline of infant mortality began about
thirty years earlier but the rate of decline increased early in this century, the
acceleration coinciding with the registration of trained nurses (1901), the Mid-
wives’ Act (1904), the establishment of the first State (St. Helens) Maternity
Hospitals (1905-1907), which were reserved for the wives of less well paid workers,
and the foundation by Dr. Truby King (1907) of the Royal New Zealand Society
for the Health of Women and Children, whose educational work on infant feeding
and nursing must have been of inestimable value. In addition to this voluntary
welfare service, New Zealand had in 1939 fifty-three public antenatal clinics for
mothers and babies, attached to the State Maternity and Voluntary Hospitals.
That represents only one clinic per 560 total births in the country. Five of
these clinics are attached to the State Maternity Hospitals which have about
2,000 births per annum, giving an average of about 400 per clinic.
For comparison. Table 48 shows the approximate positions in Scotland and
England and Wales in 1937.
It appears from the ratios shown that the services in Scotland lag behind
those in England and Wales and that expenditure per birth in Scotland is only
two-thirds that in England and Wales.
In so far as comparison can be made between those figures and the data
quoted for New Zealand in the preceding paragraph, it might seem as if services
were more highly developed here, but it appears that all the public maternity
hospitals give antenatal attention to their “ booked ” cases and that this is
additional to the care offered by the fifty-three public clinics to women who will
not subsequently be confined in hospital.
The Aims and Facilities of Clinics • Under ideal conditions, the mother
and child welfare service would be occupied only with the maintenance of health
and the education of mothers to that end. Since, in the past, these mothers
have received no health education in school, the teaching of mothercraft by
welfare workers is the more difficult and the need for it the more urgent. As

things are, mother and child welfare clinics ought to be even more concerned
than they are with the detection and elimination of ill-health. The routine
clinical examination at antenatal clinics is designed chiefly from the obstetrical
point of view ; such biochemical tests as are used are usually only for albumin-
uria and syphilis. To illustrate the shortcomings of such a system, it has been
shown above that 80 per cent, of stillbirths in booked hospital cases are due to
antenatal conditions and outwith the control of obstetricians when the women
come to confinement. For this reason alone, more attention should be paid to
the nutritional condition during pregnancy. The attention given to anaemia is
insufficient, and other deficiency diseases, for instance the angular stomatitis of
riboflavin deficiency, may pass through the clinic unrecognised. These and
other indices of defective feeding should be used as a guide to the health of
mother and foetus. This would require more and better qualified staff. There
is need for qualified dietitians to inquire into and give advice on diet. The same
is true, though perhaps to a somewhat less extent, of postnatal and infant
welfare clinics. Hence number of clinics alone does not guarantee adequacy
of service.
Apart from such desirable additions to the routine, the premises and staff
of clinics are often grossly inadequate to the work now undertaken. Often the
buildings are ill lighted, badly ventilated and dingy ; insufficiently heated,
cramped and without facilities for lectures and demonstrations. Even if the


premises are suitable, it may be necessary, in order to deal with all the subjects,
to crowd the clinic sessions beyond the capacity of the staff to do efficient work.
Frequently there may be both poor premises and overcrowding.
Under such conditions, it is difficult to envisage the extension of nutritional
work that would be desirable. The recognition of deficiency states requires
special training; confirmatory clinical or chemical laboratory work may be
required. The facilities for consultation with experts and for laboratory work,
if required, are poor because medical teaching provides little instruction in the
principles of nutrition and there are few clinical laboratories staffed or equipped
to deal with nutritional problems.
The Health Visitor : The health visitor is concerned not only with
mothers and babies but also with other pre-school children. In many areas she
takes a share of school medical work and the care of tuberculosis patients. Her
efficiency will depend on the nature of her duties and the number of families
allotted to her care. When the child welfare service was started, it was con-
sidered that if she could spend at least six half-days weekly on visiting, only
one whole-time health visitor was required to 1,000 children under the age of
five in compact urban areas. The requirement will obviously depend on the
nature of the district and the amount of advice and assistance called for.
Experience has shown that if the work is to be efficient, a health visitor in a
compact area cannot visit more than a maximum of six homes in one half-day.
This corresponds to not more than 500 children below the age of five. Some
authorities consider such a district too large. Few, if any, are smaller. If the
nurse has school or other duties in addition, her welfare district should be
reduced in proportion.
Powers to Provide Additional Services : In addition to the provisions
outlined above, powers exist under the maternity and child welfare scheme, to
provide, where there is need, food for both mothers and children and domestic
help, Domestic help is urgently needed in many homes, and the number of cases
in which help and food are provided is far below the number in which they are
required. Until a long-term policy of social and dietary improvement has had
time to show results, the powers that exist should be more often used.
CHAPTER 12—HOSPITAL, MEDICAL AND NURSING SERVICES
It has been found impossible to make all the comparisons desired under this
heading because information presented in reports is never complete and different
reports select different items for presentation. Points on which it has been
possible to make comparison are discussed below.
Confinements in “ Institutions ” : Tables 49 and 50 show the percentages
of births that take place in " institutions,” which include hospitals of all types
and nursing homes. In 1937 the percentages in Scotland and England and Wales
were 37-5 and 35-2 respectively. The percentage in England (36-4) was much
higher than in Wales (17-5). Thus Scotland and England are not very different
in this respect. For comparison, in U.S.A. in 1939 the percentage was STI,
varying from 84-6 in the large cities to 2TB in rural areas. In New Zealand in
1934 it was 74-8.
Hospital Accommodation : From Table 49 it appears that there is no great
difference between England and Wales and Scotland in the provision of hospital
beds in relation to total births. In Scotland the percentage of births in hospital
is greater, and, therefore, there is greater crowding, which appears to be confined
to the voluntary hospitals. A comparison with New Zealand shows that New
Zealand has roughly 50 per cent, more hospital beds per 1,000 births. The
percentage of births in hospital is the same. Assuming the beds to be fully and
continuously occupied, this means that, on the average, women confined in
Scotland spend only two-thirds as long in hospital as they do in New Zealand.

In order to estimate the average length of time spent in hospital per birth,
it would be necessary to know how many beds are occupied by antenatal cases
and for how long. This information is not available. From common knowledge
the average period in voluntary hospitals for a confinement in Scotland does
not exceed ten days. Local authority hospitals aim at fourteen days. If it be
remembered that the voluntary hospitals deal with a high proportion of abnormal
and difficult cases and those in which antenatal care has been inadequate, the
position appears all the more unsatisfactory from the point of view of the health
of the mother. And, recalling the surroundings to which these women are
returning, the poor diet, the overcrowded and unhygienic dwellings into which
the infants are being introduced at so early an age, the very short period in
hospital may be significant also from the point of view of the survival of the
infant. There is no information on the subsequent history of the babies
separately to show whether this assumption is justified.
Hospital accommodation should be available for all primigravidae and for
all others with a bad obstetrical history and from unsuitable homes. The
percentage of first births in Scotland is 35, and 33 per cent, of total births take
place in hospital. Hence the 1937 bed accommodation is not quite sufficient for
primigravidae alone. An increase from 15-6 to 40 or 50 beds per 1,000 births
would be required on the suggested basis without any allowance for an extended
stay in hospital or for more antenatal admissions. Since 1937 the number of
beds in hospitals has increased by about 30 per cent. The number in private
nursing homes has decreased. There are 300 beds in emergency maternity
homes and 1,845 in hospitals. This increase would need to be made permanent
and a further increase to treble the 1937 total is necessary.
Domiciliary Midwifery and Maternity Nurses : In New Zealand the
proportion of cases delivered by mid wives alone is very low, less than 3 per cent.,
including district cases under the supervision of the State Maternity Hospitals.
In contrast with less than 3 per cent, in New Zealand, 24 per cent, of births
in Scotland are attended by midwives alone and the proportion of midwives to
total births was 1 to 65 in 1937.
In the same year in England (excluding London) midwives employed under
the Midwives Act were responsible for 24 per cent, of the total confinements.
This takes no account of those practising independently, so that the proportion
of births attended by midwives alone must be much higher in England than in
Scotland. The proportion of midwives, practising under the Act, to total births
was 1 : 85 in 1937 and of midwives who had given notice of the intention to
practise 1:34 in 1936 in England and Wales. Later data are not available.
The supply of trained maternity nurses in New Zealand is very high, so
that where the woman is confined at home by her family doctor (23 per cent, of
the total) a fully qualified nurse is also in attendance. Altogether New Zealand


had slightly more than one practising midwife or fully qualified maternity nurse
for every! twelve births in 1934. It has not been found possible to make a
direct comparison with England and Wales or Scotland, but it is unlikely that
the supply of practising midwives and maternity nurses would approach this
standard.
The Training of Midwives and Maternity Norses : The time occupied
in the training of midwives and maternity nurses and the general scheme of
training are practically the same in Scotland, England and Wales and New
Zealand. The conditions of training in Scotland are not always good. Student
midwives and nurses are used largely in the service of the hospital and the allow-
ance of free time for study is inadequate. In the wards of some hospitals where
medical students are also taught, nurses compete against the students for the
limited amount of clinical material available. Little attention is paid to the
rules laid down by the Central Midwives Board (Rule C. 32 (m)) for training in
the hygiene and feeding of infants.
Health visitors have only six months’ special training, and the course should
be both extended and improved. Consideration should be given to the advis-
ability of developing a service of specialist health visitors on the lines of the
service first organised by Dr. Truby King in New Zealand, to which reference
has been made on p. 62.
Medical Teaching : The standard of teaching of medical students, and
post-graduate instruction, at least as far as the principles of child health are
concerned, should be much higher. Sweden, for instance, had the first Chair of
Paediatrics in the world, founded in 1845, and instruction of medical students
in this subject was made compulsory in that year (Schiotz, 1934; Jundell, 1939).
It was followed by the first American Chair in New York in 1860 (Jacobi, 1911).
Paediatrics has been taught for many years as a major subject in all advanced
countries except this, and the children’s doctor has been a recognised part of
medical systems in which there are more specialists and fewer general practi-
tioners than here. In most British medical schools, paediatrics is a minor sub-
ject ; of Scottish medical schools, only Glasgow * has implemented the recom-
mendations made by the General Medical Council in 1932 that infant hygiene
and diseases of children should be included in the subjects for final examinations.
The Reports on which these recommendations were based considered neglect
of the study of children’s diseases to be a serious defect in the medical cur-
riculum and the attention given to the subject of infant hygiene to be “ farcical.”
While this persists, the training of general practitioners to take care of child
health will remain grossly unsatisfactory.
There is an equally serious lack of appreciation of the importance of instruc-
tion in the principles of nutrition and their clinical application. In the United
States in 1939 (Rose, 1935 ; Committee of American Dietetic Association, 1939),
71 out of 82 medical schools provided courses of instruction in nutrition,
conducted by Professors of Nutrition, Medicine, Biochemistry and Physiology
or by dietitians. A doctor’s degree in nutrition was first granted by Columbia
University in 1932 and, by 1935, more than 300 Universities and Colleges were
training teachers, hospital dietitians and dietitians for extension work under the
Department of Agriculture and for welfare and relief work throughout the
States. America has also a wide and richly endowed system of Research
Foundations. In contrast with this, in this country, there are only four institu-
tions giving recognised diploma courses in dietetics. A few hospitals train
dietitians in hospital work. There is no organised University teaching of
nutrition.
But the fault goes deeper than the lack of text-book teaching and examina-
tions. There is also a general lack of facilities for teaching. In children’s
hospitals, healthy infants and children are not to Be found and, although the
theory of infant health and infant diet may be taught there, practical and clinical
instruction cannot be given. Yet it is as important to know and understand
the healthy child as to recognise disease, and child welfare centres, especially
those attached to hospitals, would provide abundant clinical material. Here
* Edinburgh has now implemented the recommendations.


and there, in both England and Scotland, attempts are being made to establish
such " well baby ” clinics but medical teaching in this, as in other branches of
medicine, has been too long occupied with disease and has lacked contact with
health.
The ideal teaching unit would be a child welfare clinic on the same site as
a maternity and a children's hospital. The same medical staff should be avail-
able for service in both the child welfare clinic and the hospitals.
Again there is no evidence to show that England and Wales enjoy any
better placing in this respect than Scotland.
The Co-ordination of Services ; At the present time medical and nursing
practice in infant health is divided between three services : the child welfare
service, with its medical personnel and health visitors; the family doctors ;
and the paediatricians preoccupied with the problem of disease in hospitals,
but here and there taking a small part in the health side in maternity hospitals
and child welfare centres attached to these institutions. The liaison between the
three services is weak ; personal contacts between the doctors engaged in them
hardly exist. Family doctors do not receive a proper training in the problems
of infant health ; the work of child welfare doctors is monotonous and apt to
lose interest because contact is not maintained with sick children; and the
hospital doctors, expert in problems of disease, have little experience either of
home conditions or of the work of the child welfare clinics.
This is obviously a most unsatisfactory system, both inefficient and wasteful.
Reorganisation is under discussion. It will fail of its main purpose, to promote
child health, if it does not provide the means for satisfactory clinical teaching.
It will fail also if it does not ensure much closer contacts between the three
services.
SUMMARY OF PART FOUR
1. Scotland has lagged behind in the provision of maternity and child welfare
services. Clinic premises are often poor, ill-equipped and overcrowded.
Nutritional supervision is inadequate. Liaison between the hospitals,
the family doctors and the child welfare service is poor.
2. Health visitors have usually much larger districts than they can efficiently
manage.
3. Powers to supply extra food and domestic help are not sufficiently used by
Local Authorities.
4. The proportion of births in hospitals and nursing homes is much higher in
New Zealand and the United States than in England and Wales or
Scotland. There is no difference between New Zealand and Scotland
in the proportion of births in hospitals, but the ratio of maternity beds
to confinements in hospital is 50 per cent, higher in New Zealand.
The shortage in Scotland is shown chiefly in crowding in the voluntary
hospitals.
5. In New Zealand only about 3 per cent, of confinements are conducted by
midwives alone as compared with 24 per cent, in Scotland. The
number of highly trained midwives and maternity nurses is so high that
practically every birth in the country has a trained nurse in attendance.
6. The provisions for the training of midwives and maternity nurses in Scotland
are similar to those in,England and Wales and New Zealand, but the
conditions of training are unsatisfactory.
7. There is, in Britain, practically no instruction in medical schools in the
principles of child health. In countries with low infant mortality rates,
such instruction has been part of the routine for from fifty to nearly one
hundred years. There is an equally serious lack of instruction in the
principles of nutrition and their clinical application. There are neither
enough teachers nor adequate facilities for teaching.
8. The co-ordination of the three services which care for mothers and children
is extremely poor and the replanning of medical services in general
should include measures to improve contact and collaboration.

APPENDIX 2—THE EFFECT OF DIET ON FŒTAL AND
INFANT MORTALITY IN ANIMALS
Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition —21st September 1942
FARM ANIMALS
Foetal and infant mortalities are high in farm animals. In a first-class dairy
herd, stillbirths, over a period of two years, were 1-9 per cent, of the total births
and mortality during the suckling period was 3-7 per cent, of live births. The
rates would be considerably higher in the average herd. The loss of lambs
varies from over 20 per cent, on poor grazings to between 5 and 10 per cent,
under conditions of good management and good feeding. In pigs, even under
good conditions, stillbirths average about 7 per cent, of total births and about
20 per cent, of those born alive die during the suckling period. The death of
chick embryos during incubation of the eggs from hens on “ normal ” diets is
20 to 40 per cent, of fertile eggs and in eggs from hens on deficient diets all
embryos may die or those thatched out be too weak to survive.
It is recognised that the magnitude of these losses is to a large extent


dependent on diet. The known facts regarding the effect of diet are briefly
summarised as follows:
Energy Supply: An adequate supply of energy is essential to successful
reproduction. Acute shortage will cause interruption of pregnancy and abortion.
Farm animals are usually fed so that they improve in condition during preg-
nancy, but this is not always true for ewes; and it has recently been shown that
underfeeding, with the consequent mobilisation of body fat, is the main cause
of ketosis in pregnant ewes. Fatty infiltration of the liver occurs, and the con-
dition is one of the main causes of foetal and maternal mortality in flocks on
poor pasture. This pregnancy toxaemia of ewes is thought by some to resemble
pregnancy toxaemia in women.
During lactation, cows are normally stall fed according to milk yield, or
pastured on good grass with concentrate supplements, but ewes are not always
given supplementary feeding in proportion to the number of lambs, and the
supply of milk for the lambs may therefore be inadequate. If they have been
underfed during pregnancy, lactation may fail. Sows are usually inadequately
fed during lactation and lose heavily in condition. Such treatment is certain
to restrict milk production and probably explains part of the high mortality
during the suckling period. The smaller the litter the faster, on the average,
do the pigs grow and the larger is the percentage surviving. On the other hand,
sows that become overfat during pregnancy, on unbalanced rations of high
carbohydrate content, produce small litters of poor viability.
Protein : There are optima for the protein content of the diet during both
pregnancy and lactation. The number, size and viability of the young at birth
are affected and the yield of milk is largely dependent on an adequate supply of
protein. If the supply is inadequate, the yield falls. Composition is not affected.
The yield of eggs depends on adequate supplies of energy and protein.
Composition is not affected.
Calcium and Phosphorus; Adequate supplies of both calcium and
phosphorus are necessary for the birth of normal young. Maternal reserves
may be adequate to meet the demands of one pregnancy and lactation, but where
reproduction is continued on deficient diets the results become steadily worse.
In pigs, for instance, the effect of calcium deficiency (pig rations are not deficient
in phosphorus) is cumulative from litter to litter and generation to generation.
The number of pigs born dead increases rapidly and the number of deaths from
bone fractures rises progressively. This may be one of a number of possible
causes contributing to the deterioration of breeding records of sows with
increasing age. The sow’s best performance is at the early age of two to
three years.
The supply of calcium and/or phosphorus also limits milk production and
so may determine survival of the young after birth.
In poultry too, calcium and phosphorus are important. In the long run,
deficiency and depletion of the hen’s reserves will cause arrest of egg laying,
but before then, deficiency of calcium will affect the thickness of the shell and
this is believed by some observers to have a direct effect on the hatchability of
the egg.
Iron : Anaemia in the mother does not appear to affect fertility but it does
profoundly affect not only the viability of the young during the suckling period
but also the health and development at much later ages. In pigs, the haemo-
globin at birth depends on that of the parent sow. A physiological reduction
occurs as in all mammals and the degree of anaemia developing depends on two
main factors, the supply of iron to the sow and exposure to sunlight. The
haemoglobin value at two weeks of age is closely correlated with the mortality
and the rate of gain in weight during the suckling period and, what is more
surprising, the haemoglobin value at eight weeks is correlated with the subse-
quent progress, in bacon pigs, to slaughter at 90 kg. live weight. In a survey of
several thousand pigs, only 64 per cent, of those anaemic at eight weeks were
classed as completely healthy at slaughter, compared with 92 per cent, of those
not anaemic at weaning. The maintenance of a normal haemoglobin level in the
sow is essential to continued successful reproduction. An anaemic sow, rebred


without change of diet, produced a large litter of which only one was weaned.
Iron deficiency may therefore also contribute to the deterioration of breeding
records with age.
In poultry too, iron is of importance. The haemoglobin level of the hen’s
blood rises and falls with the rate of egg laying. A severe anaemia occurs in
embryo chicks, responsible for a high mortality at an early stage of develop-
ment. It is not known exactly how these two facts are correlated but some
correlation would be expected to exist.
Trace Elements : Deficiency of iodine results in abnormal development of
the foetus (apart from goitre) and a high proportion of stillbirths. Naturally
occurring deficiencies are reported for cattle, sheep and pigs. Manganese is also
indispensable and naturally occurring deficiency affects the development of
poultry. It is responsible for perosis in the growing bird and for a late peak in
embryo mortality.
Vitamin D : It is known that deficiency of vitamin D affects the viability
of the mammalian foetus and the chick embryo, but whether this effect is in any
way apart from its effect on calcium and phosphorus metabolism is not clear.
Vitamin A : In cattle, sheep and pigs, severe deficiency of vitamin A results
in the birth of premature, dead or weak calves, which may be blind and which
do not usually survive more than a few days. The birth is described of pigs
that were blind, some of them without eyeballs, with misplaced kidneys, cleft
palate and hare lip, and other deformities.
The vitamin A content of milk depends on the diet of the lactating animal
and an adequate supply is essential to the survival of the young.
Vitamin E : It has frequently been suggested that deficiency of vitamin E
may be responsible for failure of gestation in farm animals, but there is no
conclusive evidence to show that vitamin E deficiency occurs in mammals
other than the rat. Resorption of foetuses does occur, at least in pigs, but since
that can occur in the rat as the result of deficiency of vitamin A and probably
from other causes, it cannot be regarded as specific for vitamin E deficiency.
That does not mean that vitamin E is not required for mammalian development
in general. The difference between the rat and farm animals may lie in ability
to synthesise or to transmit vitamin E across the placenta. There is no informa-
tion to show. Vitamin Eis required for development of the chick embryo and
embryos from hens on a deficient diet die at an early stage of development.
Vitamin B x : There is no evidence to show that vitamin B! deficiency has
any effect on gestation or lactation beyond that of the resultant anorexia and
inanition.
Riboflavin : The role of riboflavin in mammalian embryonic development
is not known but, since it is essential at all stages of life after birth, it is unlikely
that it should not affect the earlier stages.
Deficiency of riboflavin is one of the common and best-known causes of
embryo mortality in chicks. The time of death depends presumably on the
degree of shortage. Chicks dying in the later stages show the nerve lesions
typical of the deficiency. Chicks that hatch continue to show a high mortality
rate during the first week of life, even on a normal diet.
LABORATORY ANIMALS
All the statements given above for farm animals have been amply proved in
experiments on laboratory animals. Deprivation of food causes interruption of
pregnancy and abortion ; it limits or prevents production of milk. The protein
requirement during gestation is higher than the usual adult requirement and
during lactation it is higher still. On a diet deficient in calcium (half the
“ normal ” supply) rats will produce a first litter fairly successfully but, of the
second generation, only a small proportion will bear young and none of the young
will be reared. Rats on a diet deficient in iron will also produce one litter
successfully but a second litter will cause a severe anaemia both in mother and
young. The young die usually within one or two days of birth. Second genera-
tion rats on iron-deficient diet give similar histories. They bear young, but many

The effects of deficiency of iodine are similar to those in other mammals. Rats
from mothers on diets deficient in manganese are born normal but too weak to
suckle.
It has also been found that rats on diets deficient in magnesium bear normal
young but are unable to suckle them. Such young as survive show the charac-
teristic signs of vasodilatation and hyper-irritability. The possibility of
magnesium deficiency in farm animals does not appear to have been considered
except in the case of milk tetany in calves.
The effect of deficiency of vitamin A on reproduction in the rat has not been
so much studied as might be expected. Defects in eye development, tooth
development and a high incidence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia have been
reported. Pregnant rats show prolonged gestation, difficult delivery and a high
percentage of stillbirths. Newton’s data are as follows :
Experimental vitamin E deficiency has been intensively studied in rats and,
although there is at present no reason to consider this deficiency of primary
importance to other mammals, yet it affords certain points of interest that may
be of wider importance. The effect of vitamin Eon the development of the rat
embryo is exerted on the embryo side of the foetal membranes and transmission
across the placenta is therefore necessary. It has recently been shown thgt
transmission becomes increasingly difficult with age and that fertility at differ-
ent ages corresponds with power of transmission. This raises the general question
of whether transmission of other substances across the placenta also varies with
age, for the rat is not peculiar in showing an early maximum fertility. The same
has been shown to be true of the pig and appears, according to Bums, to be true
of women, or at least of women subsisting on poor diets.
The roles of the several constituents of the B complex have not been studied
separately but the first-year records of rats reared on a diet deficient in the
entire complex showed only small litters and none were reared.
It has recently been discovered that rats reared on a rachitogenic diet of
high calcium content, supplemented by viosterol to prevent rickets, show a high
incidence of resorptions, atrophic foetuses and skeletal deformities of a definite
pattern, including shortening of the mandible, shortening or absence of limb
bones and syndactylism. Other changes were seen with less frequency. The
abnormalities were completely prevented by giving liver or an alcoholic extract
of liver.
Guinea-pigs on a diet of low vitamin C content do not produce living young.
The foetuses are aborted or resorbed. This is attributed to failure of develop-
ment or degeneration of the Graafian follicle.
With the possible exceptions of vitamin E and manganese all the findings
reported above are directly applicable to human beings. Women on poor diets
are liable to suffer from deficiency of any one or more than one of the constitu-
ents discussed.
An interesting study has recently been made of the effect of early and delayed
breeding on the fertility and reproductive performance of rats.
Breeding late in the life of the female rat reduces her reproductive ability
by increasing the interval between litters and reducing the size of the litters.

Females that produce the first litter when they are old have difficulty in deliver-
ing their young, and generally are poor mothers.
Females that are permitted to reproduce and lactate at a young age are not
so productive as are animals that have some further development following
puberty before they begin producing and raising young. Although the differ-
ence is not large, the interval between litters is longer and the size of the litters
is smaller for those females that reproduce and lactate early in life.
ADDENDUM, JULY 1943
As this Report is being completed, there is in the press (Richards, Brit.
Med. J., 1943) an account of a breeding experiment with rats at the Rowett
Research Institute, designed to determine the effect on reproduction of a poor
human diet with and without supplements. The supplements tested were milk,
calcium, vitamin and yeast, separately or in different combinations. The
results are shown in the following two tables.
These records show clearly the importance of diet in determining the breed-
ing performance of animals in controlled environment and indicate the large
part it may possibly play in the problem of infant mortality and maternal health
in the human population.


APPENDIX 3 —HEALTH SERVICES IN THE U.S.A.
U.S. Department of Labor, Children's Barean, Washington
December 17. 1942.
Miss Lenroot has received your letter requesting information regarding
measures directed toward the lowering of infant mortality that have been
adopted in the United States, and has requested me to send you material
on this subject.
One of the early studies of the U.S. Children’s Bureau was of the factors
associated with infant mortality. The findings of this study are summarised in
the publication Causal Factors in Infant Mortality,* a copy of which lam sending
you. While this study was published in 1925, we have no reason to believe that
the conclusions are not, for the most part, applicable to-day. The relative im-
portance of some of the factors has changed, however. For example, we do not
see the same influence of seasonal conditions upon mortality from gastric and
intestinal diseases, since there is now more widespread knowledge of correct
methods of artificial feeding. For the same reason, it is doubtful whether there
is now as marked a difference in the mortality of breast-fed and artificially-fed
infants.
Gastric and intestinal diseases were formerly the chief cause of death in
infants during the second to twelfth months. In the early years of the present
century activities directed toward lowering infant mortality were, therefore,
chiefly directed toward improvement in infant feeding. Milk stations, at which
prepared feedings were distributed for artificially-fed infants, were organised in
a number of cities. It was soon learned, however, that more could be accom-
plished by teaching the mother how to prepare the feedings and how to care
for her infant, and by providing medical supervision for the mother during
pregnancy and for the child after birth. Consequently, it has become customary
to provide health services for expectant mothers and for children under school
age in the form of prenatal clinics and child health clinics, with services of
public health nurses both in the clinics and at home visits.
The marked decrease in infant mortality, especially from gastric and
intestinal diseases, that occurred previous to 1935, cannot be attributed entirely
to the development of special health services for mothers and children, which
up to that time existed chiefly in the larger cities. A number of general factors
undoubtedly played an important role, such as improved sanitation and control
of milk and water supplies, increased medical knowledge of the correct care and
feeding of infants, and general dissemination of ideas of personal hygiene and
particularly of child hygiene. Probably the most important factors have been
the increased use of pasteurized or evaporated milk in artificial feedings and the
education of mothers as to the importance of boiling all fresh milk used for
infant feeding.
In 1935 Congress passed the Social Security Act. One title of this Act
authorized the appropriation of Federal funds for allotment to the States for
the development of maternal and child health services in the States, especially
in rural areas and areas of special need. This Act has greatly stimulated the
development of such services. The booklet Maternal and Child-Health Services
Under the Social Security Act outlines the development of this program from
1936-39. It also describes the type of services rendered. Of course, not all of
the services described are as yet widely available throughout the country. The
extent to which the various services are now provided is discussed in the folder
Facts About Child Health, on pp. 9-11.
The measures taken to reduce infant mortality have been more effective in
reducing deaths in the second to twelfth months than in the first month of life,
• Woodbury (1925).


and particularly in the first day. Since deaths during the first month are chiefly
due to prenatal and natal causes (84 per cent, of the neonatal deaths in 1940),
increasing attention has been directed in the last few years towards reducing
deaths from these causes. Measures directed towards this end include extension
of prenatal services, measures to provide medical and nursing care for the mother
at the time of childbirth and for the newborn infant, efforts to make hospital care
for maternity patients more generally available and to raise the standards of
hospital care for maternity patients and newborn infants, and special measures
for the protection of premature infants.
In most of our large cities women who are unable to pay the cost of maternity
care can receive such care at clinics and hospitals or through home delivery
services, although in some cities where there is unusual crowding as a result of
war activities the services normally available are inadequate under present
conditions. The steps that are being taken to provide maternity care in rural
areas and small cities are described on pp. 17-29 of the booklet Maternal and
Child-Health Services Under the Social Security Act. The extent to which
nursing or medical care at the time of childbirth are made available from public
funds to those who cannot pay is, as yet, very limited outside of the large cities.
Efforts to raise the standard of hospital care of maternity patients and
newborn infants have taken various forms. Physicians and hospital adminis-
trators, through their professional organizations, are continuously educating
their own members. Certain cities, notably New York and Chicago, have estab-
lished minimal standards for hospital maternity services that are enforced as
public health regulations. Many States have licensing authority over maternity
homes and hospitals and are attempting to enforce minimal standards in so far
as they have the personnel to carry on this function.
The mimeographed outline of Standards and Recommendations for Hos-
pital Care of Newborn Full-Term and Premature Infants, which I am sending,
has been prepared recently in the Children’s Bureau, in consultation with the
United States Public Health Service and with the advice of committees of
obstetricians and pediatricians. Relatively few of the maternity services in
our hospitals can meet these standards at the present time, but it is believed that
it will be helpful to set before them a yardstick for evaluation of their services
and a goal toward which to work.
Premature birth is the most important single cause of death during the first
month of life ; 46 per cent, of all neonatal deaths in 1940 were attributed to
this cause. Recognising this, increased efforts have been made in the last few
years to provide better care for infants born prematurely. This problem and
the steps being taken to meet it are described in the publications : Mortality from
Premature Birth in the United States ; Birth Weight and Its Relation to Neonatal
Mortality *)The Care of the Premature Infant f; The Premature Inf ant in the Public
Health Program I; The Care of Premature Infants, a Plan of Co-operation Between
Hospital and Public-Health-Nursing Services § ; Standards for Care of Premature
Infants in Hospitals Having a Maternity Service ; Provisions for Care of Pre-
mature Infants (abstracts from the 1941 plans for maternal and child health
services submitted to the Children’s Bureau from the various States).
The Children’s Bureau has for several years conducted studies of the
physiology and care of premature infants. The results of studies of incubators
for premature infants are being sent you.
The pamphlet Maternity Care for Wives of Men in Military Service and
Medical Care for Their Children describes a special war-time service recently
developed as a part of the maternal and child health program under the
Social Security Act.
One other phase of the maternal and child health program that is im-
portant in prevention of infant mortality is that of postgraduate education in
pediatrics and obstetrics for practising physicians. This is described on pp.
66-68 of Maternal and Child-Health Services Under the Social Security Act.
At the 1940 White House Conference on Children in a Democracy, recom-

mendations were made for a program for the next ten years for promotion of
all phases of child welfare. The recommendations pertaining to child health are
reported in the chapter beginning on p. 51 of the general report of the Conference.
With regard to your specific questions, I shall try to answer them as far as
possible.
1. What is the importance of poor housing and overcrowding P
As shown in the studies reported in Causal Factors in Infant Mortality ,*
poor housing and crowding bear a definite relation to infant mortality. Study
of infant mortality rates for various sections of a city usually shows that higher
rates prevail in those sections in which there is crowding and poor housing.
It is difficult to be certain to what extent crowding and poor housing are
actually a cause of higher mortality of infants because they are always associated
with other factors, such as low economic level, and lower educational level of
parents.
2. What is the numerical ratio of health visitors per 1,000 births P
In the United States, health visitors such as are employed in Great Britain
are not utilized in the community health programs. Public health nurses
are employed by official and non-official agencies.
I am sending a map which shows the population per public health nurse in
urban and rural areas in each State as of January 1, 1940. We do not have
figures on the number of nurses in proportion to births, though this could be
calculated from the data on the reverse side of this map and the number of live
births given on the reverse of the map showing birth rate in each State. Since
there are relatively few specialized maternal and child health public-health-
nursing services and the tendency is more and more toward generalized services,
calculations based on the ratio of nurses to live births are not particularly
appropriate.
In general, it is considered that to provide adequate service there should be
one public health nurse for every 2,000 population, but for any given locality
the number of nurses needed will depend upon the type of community and upon
how effectively the services are organized to avoid duplication and provide for
maximum efficiency.
3. How are health visitors trained?
Since we do not have health visitors, I am substituting a brief outline of the
qualifications of public health nurses engaged in direct service :
Academic education —
High school graduation.
Professional education —-
Completion of basic three-year program of study in an approved
school of nursing and licensed to practise. Satisfactory completion of
university program of study in public health nursing granting
academic credit.
The qualifications of supervisors and administrators in public health nursing,
in addition to the above, are usually college graduation and additional prepara-
tion in public health nursing supervision and administration.
Public health nurses in all State programs and in a large proportion of
city programs do generalized public health nursing, including maternal and
child health services as a part of their generalized service. The services in which
public health nurses participate which relate specifically to infant care are :
Maternity—
Prenatal supervision
Through home visits ;
Through clinic service ;
Teaching group classes of mothers.
Nursing assistance at deliveries in the home.
* Woodbury (1925).


Postpartum nursing care.
Infant health supervision—
Throughout infancy and pre-school period
In home ;
In clinic.
I am sending tables giving figures on the number of public health nurses in
the United States employed by different types of agencies, and on the qualifica-
tions of these nurses ; also a statement prepared at the time the maternal and
child health services under the Social Security Act were inaugurated, showing
the implications of that program for public health nursing.
4. What are the standards of provision of beds for premature and sick babies
per 1,000 births?
No definite standards have been established. It has been recommended
that the maternity services of hospitals provide for care of five or six premature
infants for every 100 live births. But since premature infants remain in the
hospital longer than full-term infants, and certain types of infants which,
strictly speaking, are not in the premature category nevertheless need the same
special care, it is suggested that the provision for premature infants should be
on the basis of 15 to 20 per cent, of the total live births.
5. What provision is there for convalescent care of sick babies?
There is no public program providing institutional convalescent care for
sick infants. Public health nurses instruct parents regarding the care of infants
who are sick or convalescing in their homes. There are some private institutions
for convalescent care of sick babies in cities. Most of the convalescent services
are for older children, particularly those with heart disease.
6. What percentage of babies are breast fed?
No figures are available. The percentage probably varies greatly in different
population groups.
7. What measures are taken to educate mothers in infant feeding ?
In the prenatal clinic —
Advice to mother as to how she can prepare herself to nurse her baby.
In the child health clinic —
Instruction by physician ;
Instruction and demonstrations by public health nurses
In individual conferences with the mother ;
In group conferences.
Home nursing visits by public health nurses—
Instruction ;
Demonstration.
Distribution of literature.
Samples of the literature regarding care and feeding of infants prepared for
parents by the Children’s Bureau are being sent you. These publications and
others prepared by State or city health departments or private agencies are
given to parents at prenatal and child health clinics, and by nurses at home
visits. The publications are also sent directly to parents upon request. It has
been found that printed material is more effective when it is used to reinforce
or supplement specific advice by the doctor or nurse than it is when distributed
without explanation as to its use.
The publications to which I have referred, together with some additional
material, are being sent you under separate cover. If they are not received
within a reasonable time, please let me know.
If the Children’s Bureau can be of any further assistance at any time, I hope
you will let us know.
Very sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) Marian M. Crane, M.D.,
Assistant Director, Division of Research in Child Development.

HEALTH AND INDUSTRIAL
EFFICIENCY
An inquiry into factors responsible for long-term
incapacity for work ;
The Clyde Valley investigation aimed to prevent
health breakdown among young industrial
workers ;
A study of the health and working experience of men
and women invalided out of the Forces and
returned to civil life ; and
The recently developed Gleneagles Fitness Centre
for Miners—
These and other Scottish experiments in social medicine
are described in this booklet, which was first published for
the Department of Health for Scotland in September 1943.
Its first edition was quickly exhausted.
The experiments which are presented from the medical
point of view were in the nature of “excursions into
difficult and little explored fields of preventive medicine
and rehabilitation ” —the result of co-operation between
the Department of Health and other organisations and
individuals interested in the promotion of the health and
well-being of the working population.
They have been recorded to stimulate further research and
guide the extension and development of health services.
