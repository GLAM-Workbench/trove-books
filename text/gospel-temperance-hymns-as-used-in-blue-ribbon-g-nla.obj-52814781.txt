ON Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wistful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.
We will rest in the fair and happy
land, by-and-by,
Just across on the ever-green shore,
Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb
by-and-by,
And dwell with Jesus evermore.
2 O’er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son for ever reigns,
And scatters night away.
3 When shall I reach that happy placo,
And be for ever blest?
When shall I see my Father’s face,
And in His bosom rest?
4 Filled with delight, my raptured
Would here no longer stay; [soul
Though Jordan’s waves around me
Fearless I’d launch away, [roll,

I WILL sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.
Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.


9 I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.
I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
Bow the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.
4 I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought
Son of God, with Him to be. [me,

Everlasting life shall have.’*
Gospel bells, how they ring!
Over land, from sea to sea;
Gospel bells freely bring
Blessed news to you and me.
fi The Gospel bells invite us
To a feast prepared for all;
Do not slight the invitation,
Nor reject the gracious call.
“ I am the Bread of Life;
Eat of Me, thou hungry soul,
Tho' your sins be red as crimson,
They shall be as white as wool,"
S The Gospel bells give warning,
As they sound from day to day,
Of the fate which doth await them
Who for ever will delay.
“ Escape ye, for thy life;
Tarry not in all the plain,
Nor behind thee look—oh, never,
Lest thou be consumed in pain."
i The Gospel bells are joyful,
As they echo far and wide,
Bearing notes of perfect pardon.
Through a Saviour crucified.
Good tidings of great joy
To all people do I bring;
Unto you is born a Saviour,
Which is Christ the Lord” and

May be raging and deep, may be
wrathful and wide;

Shall guide thee and keep thee,

Hath called thee to suffer and reign

And His crown thou shalt wear,
And for ever and ever His glory shalt
share.

YIELD not to temptation*
For yielding is sin,
Each vict’ry will help you
Some other to win;
Fight manfully onward,
Dark passions subdue,

Ask the Saviour to help you,
Comfort, strengthen,and keep you*
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.

Bad language disdain,
God’s name hold in rev’rencet
Nor take it in vain ;
Be thoughtful and earnest,
Kind-hearted and true.
Look ever to Jesus,
He’ll carry you through,
3 To him that o’ercometh
God giveth a crown,
Thro’ faith we shall conquer*
Tho’ often cast down;
He who is our Saviour
Our strength will renew,
Look ever to Jesus,
He’ll carry you through.
11 P.M.
WHERE is my wand’ring boy to-
night?
The boy of my tend’rest care,
The boy that was once my joy and
light,
The child of my love and prayer.
Oh, where is my boy to-night ?
Oh, where is my boy to-night ?
My heart o'erflows, for I love him,
he knows;
Oh, where is my boy to-night ?
2 Once he was pure as morning dews,
As he knelt at his mother’s knee;
No face was so bright, no heart more
true,
And none was so sweet as he.
3 Oh, could I see you now, my boy,f
As fair as in olden time, [a joy,
When prattle and smile made home
And life was a merry chime !
4 Go for my wandering boy to-night;
Go, search for him where you will ’
But bring him to me with all hit
blight,
And tell him I love him still.

0 SPIRIT, o’erwhelmed by thy
failures and fears,
Look up to thy Lord, tho’ with
trembling and tears:
Weak Faith, to thy call seem the

To thee is the message, “ Hold fast
till I come.”
“ Hold fast till I come,”
“ Hold fast till I come; ”
A bright crown awaits thee;
“ Hold fast till I come.”

allure thee to sin;
Hold fast when the tempter assails

I’VE found a Friend; oh, such a
Friend I
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him.
And ’round my heart still closely
twine
Those ties which nought can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine
For ever and for ever.
2 I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a
Friend I
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me.

To guide me on my onward course,
And bring me safe to heaven.

To nerve my faint endeavour;
Bo now to watch, to work, to war,
And then to rest for ever.

Friend I
So kind, and true, and tender,
So wise a Counseller arnd Guide,
So mighty a Defender I [well,
From Him, who loves me now so

Shall life, or death, or earth, or hell ?
No; lam His for ever.
16 9s.
I HAVE heard of a land far away,
And its glories no tongue can
declare;
But its beauty hangs over the way,
And with Jesus I long to be there.
To be there, to be there,
And with Jesus I long to be there.
2 There are foretastes of heaven
below,
There are moments like joys of
the blest;
But the glories no mortal can know,
Of the land where the weary shall
rest.
3 In that noon-tide of glory so fair,
In that gleam of the river of life,
There are joys that the faithful
shall share— [the strife I
Oh, how sweetly they rest frohi

In the shade of the sheltering
fold;
Evermore by Immanuel’s side,
They shaa dwell in the glory

Faintingon the deck,
With what joy they hail their
Saviour,
As He hails the wreck!

Sinking 'neath the wave,
Souls that perish, heed the message!
“ Christ has come to save! ”

He in love has come; [trusting.
Leave the wreck; and in Him
Thou shalt reach thy home!

REVIVE Thy work, 0 Lord,
Thy mighty arm make bare;
Speak with the voice that wakes the
dead,
And make Thy people hear.
Revive Thy work, revive Thy work.
And give refreshing showers;
The glory shall be all Thine own,
The blessing shall be ours.

Disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smould’ring embera
By Thine Almighty breath, [now

And by the Holy Ghost, our love
For Thee and Thine inflame.

WHY do you wait, my brother,
Oh, why do you tarry so long?
Your Saviour in mercy would give
you
A place in His sanctified throng.
Why not ? why not ?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not ? why not ?
Why not come to Him now?
2 What do yop hope, my brother,
To gain by a further delay ?
There’s no one to save you but Jesus,
There’s no other way but His way.
3 Do you not feel, my brother,
His Spirit now striving within ?
1 Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off 1 thy burden of sin 7


1 Linger no longer, brother!
Tho harvest is passing away,
Your Saviour is longing to bless you;
There’s danger and death in delay.
SO 8.7.
WHEN the storms of life are
raging,
Tempests wild on sea and land,
I will seek a place of refuge,
In the shadow of God's hand.
He will hide me, He will hide me,
Whore no harm can e’er betide me;
He will hide me, safely hide me
In the shadow of His hand.
B Though He may send some afflic-
tion, [home;
'Twill but make me long for
For in love and not in anger
All His chastenings will come.
3 Enemies may strive to injure,
Satan all his arts employ; [me
God will turn what seems to harm
Into everlasting joy.
4 So, while here tho cross I’m bearing,
Meeting storms and billows wild,
Jesus for my soul is caring; [child.
Nought can harm His Father's

Would you know God’s peace with-

Jesus who on the cross did die,
Jesus who lives and reigns on
He alone can justify! [high,
Fix your eyes upon Jesus!

Fix your eyes upon Jesus 1
Would you know His power to save?
Fix your eyes upon Jesus !

world I have said,
And gladly lie down to my rest;
When softly the watchers shall say,

And fold my pale hands o’er my
And when with my glorified vision
at last
The walls of “ That City ” I see,
Will any one then, at the beautiful
gate.
Bo waiting and watching for me?
Will any one then, at the beautiful
gate,
Be waiting and watching for me?
2 There are little ones glancing about
in my path,
In want of a friend and a guide;
Thero are dear little eyes looking up
into mine,
Whose tears might be easily dried.
But Jesus may beckon the children
away [their glee—
In the midst of their grief and
Will any of them, at the beautiful
gate,
Be waiting and watching for me ?
3 There are old and forsaken who
linger awhile
In homes which their dearest have
left;
And a few gentle words or an action
of love
May cheer their sad spirits bereft.
But the Reaper is near to the long-
standing corn,
The weary will soon bo set free-
will any of them, at the beautiful
gate.
Be waiting and watching for me?
i Oh, should I be brought there by tho
bountiful grace
Of Him who delights to forgive,
Though I bless not the weary about
in my path,
Pray only for self while I live —
Methinks I should mourn o'er my
sinful neglect
If sorrow in heaven can be,
Should no one I love, at the bvauti-
ful gate,
Be waiting and watching for me I


23 S.T.
LET us gather up the sunbeams
Lying all around our path;
Let us keep the wheat and roses,
Casting out the thorns and chaff;
Let us find our sweetest comfort
In the blessings of to-day,
With a patient hand removing
All the briars from the way.
Then scatter seeds of kindness,
Then scatter seeds of kindness,
Then scatter seeds of kindness,
For our reaping by-and-by.
S Strange we never prize the music
Till the sweet-voiced bird has
flown! [violets
Strange, that we should slight the
Till the lovely flowers are gone!
Strange that summer skies and sun-
shine
Never seem one half so fair
As when winter’s snowy"pinions
Shake the white down m the air.
8 If we knew the baby fingers
Pressed against the window-pane
Would be cold and stiff to-morrow—
Never trouble us again—
Would the bright eyes of our darling
Catch the frown upon our brow ?
Would the prints of rosy fingers
Vex us then as they do now ?
4 Ah I those little ice-cold fingers,
How they point out memories back
To the hasty words and actions
Strewn along our backward track \
How those little hands remind us,
As in snowy grace they lie,
Not to scatter thorns—but rosea—
For our reaping by-and-by!

Victory is nigh!
“ Hold the fort, for I am coming !”
Jesus signals still; [heaven—
Wave the answer back to
“By Thy grace we will! ”
R See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone.

Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader’s name we’ll triumph
Over every foe!

But our h|lp is near; [mander:
Onward comes our great Com*

BRIGHTLY beams our Father’s
mercy
From His lighthouse evermore,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.
Let the lower lights be burning!
Sepd a gleam across the wave !
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-
man
You may rescue, you may save.
2 Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shofe.

Some poor seaman, tempest-tost,
Trying now to make the harbour,
In the darkness inwb be lost.

To be there I To be there!
Oh, what must it be to be the»el

Its walls deck’d with jewels so rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold,
But what must it be to be there!
3 We speak of its peace and its love,
The robes which the glorified
wear,
The songs of the blessed above,
But what must it be to bo there!
4 We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation, and
care,
From trials without and within;
But what must it be to be there I
B Do Thou, Lord, in pleasure or woe,
For heaven our spirits prepare ;
Then shortly wo also shall know ,
And feel, what it is to be there !

RING the bells of heaven! there is
joy to-day
For a soul returning from the wild!
See I the Father meets him out upon
the way, [child.
Welcoming His weary wand’ring

COME, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys bo known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.
8 Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly Kiug
May speak their joys abroad.
3 The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields#
Or walk the golden streets.
4 Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We’re marching through Imman-
uel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high.

I’VE reach’d the land of corn and
wine,
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimm’d one blissful
day,
For all my night has passed away.
O Beulah land! sweet Beulah land!
As on thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea, [mo,
Where mansions are prepared for
And view the shining glory shore,
My heav’n, my home for evermore.

And sweet communion here have
Ho gently leads me with His hand,
For this is heav’n’s border-land.

Is borne from ever-vernal trees;
And flowers that know no fading
grow [flow.
Where streams of life for ever
4 The zephyrs seem to float to me
Sweet sounds of heaven’s melody,
As angels, with the white-robed
throng,
Join in the sweet redemption song.

THE mistakes of my life have been
many, [more,
The sins of my heart have been
And I scarce can see for weeping,

I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But when the dear Saviour shall
bid me come in,
I’ll enter the open door.

I am weakest of those who pray;
But I come as He has bidden,
And He will not say me nay.

cover,
My sins He will wash away;
And the feet that shrink and falter
Shall walk through the gates ol

And my spirit is sick with sin,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But the Saviour will let me in.

OLAND of rest, for thee I sigh I
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armour by,
And dwell in peace at home?
We’ll work till Jesus comes;
We’ll work till Jesus comes;
We’ll work till Jesus comes;
And we’ll be gathered home.
2 No tranquil joys on earth I know,
No peaceful sheltering dome;
This world’s a wilderness of woe,
This world is not my home.


8 To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;
Ho bade me cease to roam,
And loan for succour on His breast,
Till He conduct me home.
8 I sought at once my Saviour’s side:
No more my steps shall roam,
With Him I’ll brave death’s chilling
tide,
And reach my heavenly home.

Amid the crowd that gathered

And straightway she was whole.

His saving power this very hour
Shall give new life to thee.

OUB Master has taken His journey
To a country that’s far away,
And has left us the care of the vine*

To work for Him day by day.
There’s a work for me and a work for
you,
Something for each of us now to do;
Yes, a work for me and a work for you;
Something for each of us now to do.

As we work, and we watch, and we
wait, [us.
If we’re filling the place He assigns
Be its service small or great?

cern us,
To find just the task that is ours;
And then, having found it, to do it
With all our God-given powers.

To reckon with ev’ry one;
Shall we then count our toil or our
sorrow
If He say to us, “ Well done ! n

By-and-by we Shall greet Him!
And with Jesus reign in glory,

We’ll pasture where He feedeth.
We’ll yield to Him who pleadeth
From on high, from on high;


Then nought from Him shall sever,
Our hope shall brighten ever,
And faith shall fail us never;
He is nigh ! He is nigh!

No trials dark to move us,
But Jesus dear to love us
There on high, there on high;
We’ll give Him best endeavour,
And praise His name for ever,
His precious words can never,
Never die! never die!

THERE'S a land that is fairer than

To prepare us a dwelling-place
there.

on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by-and-by, we shall meet
on that beautiful shore.
2 We shall sing on that beautiful
shore
The melodious songs of the blest;
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

We will offer the tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our

There is a fountain filled with

Drawn from Immanuel’s veins,

Wash all my sins away.

Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

I’ll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammer-

For the injured interceding,
To the light the lost ones leading,

FATHER, don’t you hear the angels
Floating just above my head,
Singing songs of heav’nly sweetness
Round about my dying-bod ?

Of that angel home on high;
Linger near me, ere I leave you;
Promise this before I die—
Father, promise you will never, never

Sweetly singing all the night ?

Promise this before I die —

WHEN the mists have rolled in
splendour
From the beauty of the hills,
And the sunshine, warm and tender,
Falls in kisses on the rills,
We may read love’s shining letter
In the rainbow of the spray—
We shall know each other better
When the mists have rolled away.
We shall know as we are known!
Never more to wake alone,
In the dawning of the morning,
When the mists have rolled away.
2 If wo err in human blindness,
And forget that we are dust;
If we miss the law of kindness
When we struggle to be just;
Snowy wings of peace shall cover
All the plain that hides away—
When the weary watch is over,
And the mists have rolled away.
3 When the mists have risen above us.
As our Father knows His own,
Face to face with those that love us,
We shall know as we are known ;
Love, beyond the orient meadows
Floats the golden fringe of day,
Heart to heart, we bide the shadows,
Till the mists have rolled away.

OF course you know that to and fro,
throughout our glorious land,
The Temp’rance Army rolls along
like waves upon the strand,
Its mighty ranks still swelling with
recruits so brave and true.
Whose emblem of enlistment is the
fameus badge of blue!
’Tis the signal to mankind, they are
soldiers of the free—
To King Alcohol, the tyrant, no
more they’ll bend the knee.
Hail, my comrades, with the signal,
the emblem of the true!
The nation is awaking to the wearing
of the blue!
2 Across the land, from sea to sea,
they’re falling into line,
Forsaking all the gilded haunts of
sin and shame and wine;
Awaking to a better life, to proudly
dare and do—
The emblem of their honesty, the
famous badge of blue;
’Tis the pledge of loyalty to a grand
and noble cause;
They are true and faithful subjects,
obeying all its laws.
3 Then why delay? enlist to-day; with
us stand side by side.
Though friends may jeer with taunt
and laugh,away with all false pride
To-day may be the turning-point
that’s all in all to you,
Then take the conq’ror’s emblem
now, the famous badge of blue!
'Tis the mark of victory other hearts
have proudly won,
Heaven’s smile will rest upon you
when the grand deed is done.

I REMEMBER a voice which once
guided my way,
When, tossed on the sea. fog-
enshrouded I lay:
’Twasthc voice of a child as he stood
on the shore, [billows’ roar:
It sounded hke music o’er the dark


“ Come this way, my father! steer
straight for me, [for thee.”
Here safe on the shore I am waiting
“ Come this way, my father steer
straight for me, [for thee.”
Here safe on the shore I am waiting

lone way,
Mid rocks and thro’ breakers and
high dashing spray;
Oh, how sweet to my heart did
it sound from the shore,
As it echoed so clearly o’er the dark
billows’ roar:
“ Come this way, my father I steer
straight for me, [for thee.”
Here safe on the shore I am waiting

once guided my way,
The form I then pressed is now
mingling with ofay;
But the tones of my child still
resound in my ear,
The voice of mv darling how dis-
tinctly I hear: [on life’s sea,
“I’m calling you, father! tossed
And on a bright shore I am waiting
for thee.”
4 I remember that voice in the oft
lonely hour,
It comes to my heart with fresh
beauty and power,
And still echoes far out over life's
troubled wave,
And sounds from the loved lips that
lie in the grave:
“Come this way, my father! steer
straight fcr me, [for thee.

O’er a little pallid face;

Hoping yet to clasp his hand.

Satan steals the power away:

But he took the fatal glass,
’Twas a fleeting joy,
Drank, and 10, the hand of death
Grasp’d my darling boy.
Save the boy! Save the boy I
Heav’n will ring with joy :
Loving hearts are pleading now,
Save, oh save the boy.
•2 Once he was so brave and true,
Shunn’d the tempter’s pow’r,
Once for right he firmly stood,
Till that dreadful hour.
Bright and sparkling was the cup,
Seemed without alloy,
Fair the hand that captive led
My poor wandering boy.
3 Once he was my only hope,
Source of joy and pride,
Then I thought that love might
Hold him to my side. [clasp,
But to-day my boy forsakes
Home with all its joys,
Far in sin he’s wandering now,
Save, oh save my boy.
4 Tell him, though he’s wandered far*
Love can never die,
Lives in hope of his return,
Looks with patient eye.
Loving hearts have pleaded long,
Pray’d for light and joy,
Keeping still a welcome there
For the wandering boy.

I AM wearing the blue for Jesus,
And seeking mankind to save,
From drink’s awful curse, and from
something far worse,
Beyond the poor drunkard’s grave.
Oh, put on the blue for Jesus,
Oh, wear it for His dear sake,
Men will know by this token, though
nothing be spoken,
That of drink you never par-
take.
2 I am wearing the blue for Jesus,
I am witnessing every day
That we never should touch, either
little or much,
Of the drink which leads souls
astray.
Oh, put on the blue, &c.
3 I am wearing the blue for Jesus,
The victims of drink to set free;
For He says, “ Inasmuch as ye do it
for such,
Ye have done it indeed unto Me.”
Oh, put on the blue, &c.
4 I am wearing the blue for Jesus,
Who died on the cross for me;
And tho’ worldlings should scold, and
friends all be cold,
I know He is smiling on me.
Oh, put on the blue, &c.
5 I am wearing the blue for Jesus;
Not ashamed of Him will I be;
And when He shall appear, my heart
shall not fear—
He will not be ashamed of me.
Oh, put on the blue, &c.


B 4 s.r.
OH, how sorrowful the picture
That intemp’rance daily shows,
See the drunken father reeling,
As he, maddened, homeward goes!
See the look of grief and anguish
That the wife and mother bears,
Hear the cry of little children
In that home of grief and cares.
Heaven help the drinking man
To forsake the maddening bowl!
Oh, reclaim his dying soul !
Heaven help the drinking man!
Oh, what gloomy thoughts enthrall
us,
As we see the young and bright
Going down the road to ruin—
Oh, how sorrowful the sight!
Fathers load the way before them,
Gilded halls of sin ensnare,
Idle friends, with wiles entrancing,
Lead them down to dark despair.
B God in heaven, look in mercy
On these dark and sinful souls,
Turn, oh turn them, ere the breakers
Drive them on to Death’s dark
shoals!
Many hearts for them aro bleeding,
And Thine own almighty plan
Can redeem them from their
danger—
Heaven help the drinking man!

All promise, all fulfilment,
And end of mystery 1

With doubt or terror nigh,

Come! oh, come to Me !
Weary, heavy laden,
Come! oh, come to Me ! ”

From such a loving Friend !
Cling closer, closer to Him,
Stay with Him to the end;
Alas! lam so helpless,
So very full of sin,
For I am ever wanu’ring,
And coming back again.

That soon the “ Come ” may be
Nought but a gentle whisper
To one close, close to Thee;
Then, over sea and mountain,
Far from or near my home,
I’ll take Thy hand and follow
At that sweet whisper, “ Come 1 ”

Shout, shout, shout, as we go marching
’Neath the flag of liberty,
For our banners won't be furled till

Marching, proudly marching on to

In the thickest of the fight
We will battle for the right,
Marching, proudly marching on to

And the bright and happy days

When the people of all lands
Clasp us gladly by the hands,

That flows by the throne of God.

Dashing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever
All the happy golden day.

Lay we every burden down;

And provide a robe and crown.

Raise their songs of saving grace.

Soon our pilgrimage will cease,
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace.

I HEARD the voice of Jesus say,
“Come unto Me, and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was—
Weary, and worn, and sad:
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.
2 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“ Behold, I freely give
The living water—thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul
revived,
And now I Jive in Ifim,


3 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“ I am this dark world’s Light:
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun ;
And in that Light of life I’ll walk
Till travelling days are done.

SWEET is the work, my God, my
King, [and sing;
To praise Thy name, give thanks
To show Thy love by morning light,
And talk of all Thy truth at night.
2 Sweet is the day of sacred rest,
No mortal care shall seize my breast;
Oh, may my heart in tune be found,
Like David’s harp of solemn sound !
3 My heart shall triumph in my Lord,
And bless His works and bless His
word! [shine!
Thy works of grace, how bright they
How deep thy counsels! how divine!
4 Lord, I shall share a glorious part,
When grace hath well defined my
heart,
And fresh supplies of joy are shed,
Like holy oil, to cheer my head.

I THINK when I read that sweet
story of old,
When Jesus was here amongmen,
How He called little children as
lambs to His fold, [Him then.
I ebould like to hsye beep with
I wish that His hands had been
placed on my head,
That His arms had been thrown
around me,
And that I might have soon H is bind
look when He said,
“ Lot the little ones come unto Mo.”
2 Yet still to His footstool in prayer I
may go,
And ask for a share of His love;
And if I thus earnestly seek Him
below, [above—
I shall see Him and hear Him
In that beautiful place He has gone
to prepare, [given;
For all who are washed and for-
And many dear children are gather-
ing there, [heaven.”
For “of such is the kingdom of

wander and fall, [home :
Never heard of that heavenly
I should like them to know there is
room for them all, [come.
And that Jesus has bid them to

The fairest, and brightest, and

every clime, [blest.

WHEN I survey the wond’rous
cross
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my
God: [most,
All the vain things that charm me
I sacrifice them to His blood.
3 See! from His head, His hands, His
feet, [down I
Sorrow and love flow mingled
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
4 Were the whole realm of nature
mine, [small:
That were an offering far too
Love so amazing, so divine.
Demands my life, my soul, my all,
129 7s.
TAKE my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Det them flow in cetiseless praise.


2 Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my foot, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for thee.
3 Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only for my King ;
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages for Thee.
4 Take my silver and my gold ;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.
5 Take my will and make it Thine ;
It shall be no longer mine:
Take my heart: it is Thine own,
It shall "be Thy royal throne.
6 Take my love : my Lord, I pour
At thy feet its treasure store:
Take myself: and I will be
Ever, only, ALL for Thee.

HAVE you any room for Jesus—
He who bore your load of sin ?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinner, will you let Him in ?
Boom for Jesus, King of glory!
Hasten now, His word obey!
Swing the heart’s door widely open,
Bid Him enter while you may J
2 Boom for pleasure, room for busi-
ness ;
But for Christ the crucified—
Not a place that He can enter.
In the heart for which He died!
3 Have you anytime for Jesus,
As in grace He calls again ?
Oh, “ to-day” is “time accepted,”
To-morrow you may call in vain!

Soon will pass God’s day of grace
Soon thy heart be cold and silent,
And thy Saviour’s pleadings cease.

WHEN the dewy light was fading,
And the sky in beauty smiled,
Came a whisper like an echo,
From a pale and dying child:
“ Mother, in that golden region,
With its pearly gates so fair,
Up among the happy angels,
Is there room for Mary there ? ”
Come, there’s room! come, there’s
room!
Boom with the glorified angel band I
Yes, there’s room! yes, there’s room!
' Boom in the beautiful heavenly land
fi “ Mother, raise me just a moment;
You’ll forgive cfie when I say,
Tou were angry when you told me
I was always in your way.
You were sorry in a moment,
I could read it on your brow;
But you'll not recall it, mother,
You must never mind it now.
3 “ When my baby sister calls me,
And you hear my voice no more,
When she plays among the roses
By our little cottage door,
Never chide her when you’re angry—
Do it kindly and in love,
That you both may dwell with Mary
In the sunny land above.”
Then she plumed her snowy pinions,
Till she folded them to rest,
’Mid the welcome song of rapture,
On her loving Saviour’s breast.
In the bright and golden region,
With its pearly gates so fair,
She is singing with the angels:
“ There isroom for Mary there.”

AWAKE, my soul, in joyful lays,
And sing thy great Bedeemer’s
praise;
He justly claims a song from me:
His loving-kindness—oh, how free!

Yet loved me, notwithstanding all;
He saved me from my lost estate :
His loving-kindness—oh, how great!
3 Though numerous hosts of mighty
foes, [oppose,
Though earth and hell my way
He safely leads my soul along:
His loving-kindness oh, how

Prone from my Saviour to depart;
But though I oft have Him forgot,
His loving-kindness changes not.

ISAW a way-worn traveler,
In tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain,
It seemed that he was sad;
His back was laden heavy,
His strength was almost gone,
Yet lie shouted as he journeyed,
“Deliverance will come!”
“Then palms of victory, crowns of
Palms of victory I shall bear.” [glory,
2 The summer sun was shining,
The sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty,
His step seemed very slow;
But he kept pressing onward,
For ho was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed,
“ Deliverance will come ! ”
3 The songsters in the arbour
That stood beside the way
Attracted his attention,
Inviting his delay:
His watchword being, “ Onward I ”
He stopped his ears and run,
Still shouting as be journeyed,
“ Deliverance will come f”
4 I saw him in the evening,
The sun was bending low;
He’d overtopped the mountain.
And reached the vale below :
Ho saw the Golden City,
His everlasting home,
And shouted aloud, “ Hosanna!
Deliverance will come! ”
$ While gazing on that City,
Just o’er the narrow flood,
A band of holy angels
Came from the throne of God;
They bore him on their pinions
Safe o’er the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph:
Deliverance had come!

Death is earnest drawing nigh:
Sinner, wilt thou trifling be ?
Time and death appeal to thee.

His help He’ll quickly give;
Haste then, no longer doubting!

1 That we pilgrims journey
through,
And our Father’s constant blessings
Fall around us like the dew;
But its sunshine and its beauty
To our hearts no joy can bring
Like the splendours that await us
In the palace of the King.
Oh, the palace of the King,
Royal palace of the King,
Where our Father in His mercy
All the ransomed ones will
bring;
Where our sorrows and our trials
Like a dream will pass away,
And our souls shall dwell for eve..
In the realms of endless day.
2 Our Redeemer is the King;
What a sacrifice He made,
When He purchased our redemption
And His blood tho ransom paid!
In His cross shall be onr glory:
To that blessed cross we’ll cling,
Till we reach the gates that open
To the palace of the King.
3 In this goodly pleasant land
Only strangers now arc we,
For we seek a better country,
And ’tis there we like to be:

That for evermore shall ring

ONE sweetly solemn thought
Comes to me o’er and o’er —
I’m nearer home to-day, to-day,
Than e’er I've been before.
Nearer my home ! nearer my homo
Nearer my home to-day, to-day,
Than e’er I’ve been before.
2 Nearer my Father’s house,
Where “many mansions’’ be;
Nearer the great white throne to-day
Nearer the crystal sea.
3 Nearer the bound of life,
Where burdens are laid down;
Nearer leaving the cross to-day,
Nearer gaining the crown.
4 Be near me when my feet
Are slipping o’er the brink;
For I am nearer home to-day,
Nearer now than I think.

THERE is beauty all around,
When there’s love at home,
There is joy in every sound,
When there’s love at home,
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling sweet on every side,
Tim n doth softly, sweetly glide,
Wh ;n there’s love at home.
2 In the cottage there is joy,
When there’s love at home;
Hate and envy ne’er annoy,
When there’s love at home,


Eoses blossom ’neath our feet,
All the earth’s a garden sweet,
Making life a bliss complete,
When there’s love at home.
3 Kindly heaven smiles above,
When there’s love at home;
All the earth is filled with love,
When there's love at home.
Sweeter sings the brooklet by,
Brighter beams the azure sky;
Oh, there’s One who smiles on high
When there’s love at home.
4 Jesus, make me wholly Thine,
Then there’s love at home;
May Thy gentle life be mine,
Then there’s love at home.
Safely from all harm I’ll rest,
With no sinful care distressed,
Thro’ Thy tender mercy blessed,
With Thy love at home.

COURAGE, brother,do not stumble,
Though thy faith be dark as
night;
There’s a star to the humble,
Trust in God and do the right.
2 Let the road be dark and dreary,
And its end far out of sight;
Foot it bravely, strong or weary,
Trust in God, and do the right-
-3 Perish policy and cunning!
Perish all that fears the light!
Whether losing, whether winning,
Trust in God, and do the right.
4 Simple rule and safest guiding,
Inward peace and inward might;
Star upon our path abiding,
Trust in God, and do the right.

thee,
Some will flatter, some will slight;
Cease from man,and look above thee,
Trust in God, and do the right.

Till every foe is vanquished,
And Christ is Lord indeed.

In this His glorious day!

Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,

Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you—
Ye dare not trust your own:

Where duty calls, or danger,
Be never wanting there.

WEEPING will not save me!
Thoujh my face were bathed
in tears,
That could not allay my fears,
Could not wash the sins of years:
Weeping will not save me!
Jesus wept and died for me,
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free:
He alone can save me!
2 Working will not save me!
Purest deeds that I can do,
Holiest thoughts and feelings too,
Cannot form my soul anew :
Working will not save me!
3 Waiting will not save me!
Helpless, guilty, lost, I lie;
In my ear is Mercy’s cry;
If I wait I can but die;
Waiting will not save me!

Let me trust Thy weeping Son,
Trust the work that He has done,
To His arms, Lord, help me run;
Faith in Christ will save me !

I WAS a wand’ring sheep,
I did not love the fold ;
I did not love my Shepherd’s voice,
I would not be controll’d,
I was a wayward child,
I did not love my home,
I did not love my Father’s voice,
I loved afar to roam.
2 The Shepherd sought His sheep,
The Father sought His child;
They follow'd me o’er vale and hill,
O’er deserts waste and wild.
They found me nigh to death,
Famish’d, and faint, and lone;
They bound me with the bands of
love,
They saved the wand’ring one.
3 Jesus my Shepherd is:
’Twas He that loved my soul,
’Twas He that washed me in Hia
blood,
’Twas He thatmade me whole.
’Twas He that sought the lost,
That found the wand’ring sheep ;
’Twas He that brought me to the
’Tis He that still doth keep, [fold,

I love to be controll’d;
I love my tender Shepherd’s voice,
I love the peaceful fold.
No more a wayward child,
I seek no more to roam;
I love my Heavenly Father’s voice,
I love, I love His home.

Jesus! sound of love;
Cheering exiles onward
To their rest above.
Jesus! sweetest song-note
On the sinner’s ear—
Jesus! breath of gladness
While we wander here.
2 Jesus! name of beauty,
Beauty far too bright
For our earth-bound fancy,
For our mortal sight.
Jesus! sweet Refreshment
When our spirits faint,
Flashing forth sweet visions
Love alone can paint.
3 Jesus! oh the deepness
Of the soft love sound!
How it thrills and trembles
Through Creation’s bound 1
Jesus! oh, my Saviour!
Can I ever tell
Half the love that saved mo
From the pains of hell ?

Words I cannot find,
Language fails to utter
Things which fill my mind.


Jesus I how it flutters
This poor heart of mine,
When I hear Thee tell me
I am only Thine!
6 “Jesus only ” shall be
My glad watchword here;
“ Jesus only” will be
My own treasure there;
In the land all sunlit,
Whence the night shades flee,
Where His own dear sunbeams
Light the crystal sea.

Flows to us from over there !

And the weary are at rest.


We shall rest by-and-by,

“ Come, ye laden, come to Me!
I have rest and peace to offer ;
Rest, thou labouring one, for thee :
Take salvation—Take it now, and
happy be.”

Still the Saviour calls to tliee;
Faith can hear His gracious accents,
“ Come, ye laden, come to Me ;
Take salvation—Take it now, and
happy be.”

Now it speaks, and speaks to thee :
Sinner, heed the gracious message—
To the blood for refuge flee:
“ Take salvation —Take it now, and
happy be.”

Only there ’tis offered thee —
Offered without price or money,
’Tis the gift of God, sent free—

DEPTH of mercy, can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear,
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

Long provoked Him to His face;
Would not hearken to His calls;
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.
3 Jesus speaks, and pleads His blood;
He disarms the wrath of God I
Now my Father’s bowels move :
Justice lingers into love.

Me He now delights to spare— *
Cries, “ How shall I give thee up ? **
Lets the lifted thunder drop.

Shows fils wounds and spreads His
hands.
God is love! I know, I feel:
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.

Christ has suffered on the tree;
Streams of mercy are abounding,
Grace for all is rich and free.

died for thee.

Refuge find in Him to-day;
Christ invites you to the fountain,
Come and wash your Sins away;
Do not tarry, come to Jesus, while you
may.

Millions there have been supplied;
Still it flows as fresh as over
From the Saviour’s wounded side;
None need perish, all may live, for
Christ has died.

Soon we hope to meet above ;
Then we’ll bathe in the full ocean
Of the Great Redeemer’s love;

VY chilly wave, [grave,
Just on the border of the silent
Shouting Jesu’s power to save,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb ?
Sweeping thro’ the gates to the New
Jerusalem,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.
2 These, these are they who in their
youthful days [ways
Found Jesus early, and in wisdom’s
Proved the fulness of His grace,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.
3 These, these are they who in afflic-
tion’s woes [repose,
Ever have found in Jesus calm
Such as from a pure heart flows,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

conflict dire [Are;
Boldly have stood amidst the hottest
Jesus now says, “ Come up higher,”
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

shore, [all are o'er,
Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow,
Happy now and evermore,
Washed In the blood of the Lamb.

Swell the triumph of His train;

Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at nought and sold

Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, l
Shall the true Messiah see.

Heaven and earth shall flee away;
All who hate Him must, confounded,
Hear the trump proclaim the day;

The angels can do nothing more
Than fall at His feet, and the story
repeat,
And the Lover of sinners adore.

my song, [see 1
Oh that all His salvation might
He doth love me, I cry, He did suffer
and die
To redeem such a rebel as me.
