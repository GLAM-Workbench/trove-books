THE LION.
The Lion is placed at the head of
the beasts of prey. He is cruel only
when urged by hunger, but when
satisfied, ceases to be an enemy.
His mode of attack is by stealing
slowly and silently till within a leap
ol his destined prey, on which he
then springs, or throws himself, with
great force, which is thought to de-
prive the victim of life before the
teeth are used. It is said that this
blow is sufficient to divide the spine
of a horse : and the power of the
Lion s teeth will break the largest
bones. The height of the Lion is
from three to four feet, and his length
is from six to nine feet


THE PANTHER.
The length of the Panther is usually
more than six feet, not measuring
the tail, which is about three feet
long. The colour of the upper parts
of the body is light tawny-yellow,
with many black, roundish marks,
several of which have in the middle
of them a black spot. The under
parts of the body are white.
In most of its habits of life, the
Panther is like the tiger ;it lurks in
secret amongst bushes or shrubs, on
the borders of the forests, and springs
with a sudden leap on such animals
as pass by. So rapid are its move-
ments, that few animals can escape.
Should any one seek for refuge in the
trees, even there the Panther pur-

sues and destroys him very quickly.
1 he. Panther has none of the noble
qualities of the lion. His thirst for
blood is very great; and his ferocity
is such, that even when in the power
of man, and in his gentlest moments,
he seems rather to be subdued than
tamed. He has a fierce countenance
and a restless eye: his cry, though
more strong and harsh, is similar to
that of an angry dog.
The mode adopted to destroy the
Pantheris usually as follows: A bait,
consisting of a piece of flesh, is sus-
pended on a tree near which the
hunter has previously erected a hut
lor his own concealment and security ;
the smell of the flesh attracts the
animal to the spot, and, whilst he is
seizing it, the hunter shoots him, and
almost always wounds him mortally.


THE CHITTAH.
The Chittah, or Hunting Leopard, is
described as having the qualities of
the cat and the dog tribe. Its habits,
as well as its teeth, identify it with the
former; while, by its sagacity and
docility, it is assimilated to the lat-
ter : it has therefore been called, the
Canine Cat. It is smaller than the
leopard; the body is less bulky, the
legs are longer, and the great promi-
nence of the forehead gives to the
features somewhat of the character
of the dog. The colour of the upper
part of the body is yellowish lawn,
studded with black spots ; that of the
under parts is white, thinly spotted
on the chest. The ears are round and
short, and the tail very long.


THE CHITTAH.




M. F. Cuvier, speaking of one of
these animals, says, that, except in
regard to that mistrust natural to
cats, he had all the habits of those
animals, playing in the same grace-
lul manner and with the same ad-
dress ; and although his nails were
not cutting, he employed his fore
paw in play in the same manner as
ca,ts, striking any small moving body
with it, and seizing his food in both
paws. Familiar with every one, he
always" purred when caressed. He
was brought up in perfect liberty,
and was accustomed to live even with
children and domestic animals. In
r ranee, he was kept, during the sum-
mer, in a park ; when he wished to
come in doors, he made a frequent
mewing; this he also did to express
his hunger, thirst, or affection.


THE PUMA.
The length of the body of the Puma
is about five feet, and its height
about two feet and a half; the tail is
about two feet long. The head is
round, and the ears are short. By
the Spaniards of Peru and UhUi,
this animal has been called the Lion
of South America; and in its colour,
its voice, and general shape, except
that it has no mane, it is not unlike
that animal.
The Puma inhabits the thickest
forests and the most inaccessible
mountains, from whence it makes in-
cursions into the plains to attack do-
mestic animals, particularly horses,
whose flesh it prefers to that ot any
other creature. Watching the oppor-

THE STRIPED HYÆNA.
The Striped Hysena is a native of
Ttarbarv, Egypt, Abyssinia, Nubia,
Syria, Persia, and the East Indies.
Its ground-colour is brownish gray.
Its sides are marked irregularly with
blackish stripes or bands, which are
usually of a deeper tinge on the lower
narts. The neck is black in front,
and the muzzle and outside of the
ears are of the same colour. Ihe
colt consists, for the most part of
long hairs, which on the shoulders
assume the form of a mane ; this
together with the bushy tail, is
striped or spotted with black.
This creature lives in the caverns
of mountains, in the clefts of rocks,
or in holes and dens which it digs m
the earth. Like the wolf, it gets its

iood by plunder, but is stronger and
more daring. It follows the flocks,
robs the sheepfold, and destroys
every thing within its reach, and
seems never to be satisfied. Its eyes
shine in the dark ; and it is thought
that it can see nearly as well by night
as by day. When destitute of other
provisions, it tears up and devours
human bodies that have been long
buried. The voice of the Hyaena
is very peculiar : the beginning of
its sound seems tp be somewhat like
the moaning of a human voice, and
the ending like a violent effort in sick-
ness. The Hyaena defends itself
with great obstinacy against much
larger animals; it is not afraid of
the lion or the panther ; it will some-
times attack the ounce, and seldom
fails to conquer.


THE JAGUAR.
The Jaguar is somewhat larger
than the wolf; it is of a brownish
yellow colour, variegated on the up-
per parts of the body with streaks,
and open oblong spots of black. The
thighs andlegs also have black spots,
but without central spaces; the
breast and belly are whitish; the tail
is about two feet and a half in length.
The Jaguar is so strong and vora-
cious, that he is able to seize and
carry off a sheep or a deer with the
utmost ease ; and yet he is so cow-
ardly, that he may sometimes be put
to flight by a shout. He often at-
tacks cows and horses. The strong-
est of the wild boars he is able to
overthrow by a single stroke of his

paw. Few of the American animals
are, in point of strength, a match for
the Jaguar, except the enormous
serpents which frequent the savan-
nahs ; and these, by entwining them-
selves round his body, are able to
strangle and destroy him.
?l»e Jaguar is not by any means
an indolent animal, as has been some-
times asserted. He frequently at-
tacks dogs ; and oftentimes commits
great destruction among flocks ; and
in the deserts is formidable even to
flian. The power which these ani-
mals have of ascending trees is very
remarkable. M. Sonnini states, that
he has seen the impressions of the
talons of a Jaguar on the smooth
bark of a tree, betwixt forty and fifty
teet in height, which had not a single
branch except on the top.


THE JACKAL.
Jackals are of different sizes; and
are found in most parts of Asia and
Africa. Those of the warmest cli-
mates are said to be the largest, and
are of a reddish brown colour; the
smaller ones are about the size of
foxes, and their colour is a bright yel-
low. These animals roam through
the villages and gardens, and carry
off every thing they can eat; they also
enter stables, yards, and out-houses,
and devour skins, and every thing
made of leather. They will even
tear up the dead out of their graves,
and greedily devour the most putrid
bodies.
They may be considered as vul-
tures among quadrupeds; and, like


THE JACKAL.




those destructive birds, devour every
thing that once had animal life-
They hide themselves in holes and
dens by day, and seldom appear
abroad till the evening, when they
fill the air with their noise, and be-
gin the chase. “ The cry of the
Jackal,” says Captain Beechey,
“ has something in it rather appal-
ling when heard for the first time at
night; and the first shriek which is
uttered is the signal for a general
chorus: the sudden burst of the
answering scream, succeeding im-
mediately to the opening note, is
scarcely less impressive than a clap
of thunder.


THE ARCTIC FOX.
This animal inhabits the countries
bordering on the Frozen Sea. It, in
some countries, burrows and makes
holes in the ground, several feet in
length ; at the end of which it forms
a nest of moss; but in other countries
it lives in the clefts of rocks, being
unable to burrow on account of the
frost. Two or three of these crea-
tures dwell in the same hole.
The Aritic Fox has all the cunning
of the common one ; it preys on
young geese, ducks, and other water-
fowl, before they are able to fly, as
well as on hares, birds, and eggs :
and, in Greenland, for want of other
food, it feeds on berries and shell-fish.
In Lapland, and the north of Asia,


THE ARCTIC FOX.
c




its principal food is the leming, or
Lapland marmot, of which a great
many are found in that country.
The foxes follow them, as they go
from one place to another ; and, "as
the return of the marmot is very un-
certain, and frequently after great
intervals of time, they are sometimes
absent for three or four years in
pursuit of this their favourite prey.
The hair of the Arctic Fox is of an
ash colour, but changes to white in
the winter, when it is long, soft, and
somewhat woolly: its tail is shorter
than that of the common fox, and
more bushy; its nose is sharp and
black ; and its ears short, and almost
hid in the fur. It is sometimes taken
in traps ; but its skin is of little
value.


THE SLOTH BEAR.
This animal, which is now proved
to be a species of bear, was impro-
perly placed by Pennant and other
naturalists among the Sloths, under
the name of the Ursine Sloth. The
error arose from Pennant and Shaw
having, in the year 1790, seen an
aged one which had lost the inner
teeth; and founding their opinion
upon this accident, they pronounced
the animal to be a Sloth. M. Bu-
chanan, in his journey from Madras
through Mysore and other countries,
was the first to announce that this
animal was no other than a Bear
found in the Indian mountains, and
the largest of three bears found in
India, the two others being the Ma-
lay and the Thibet.


THE SLOTH BEAR.




The Sloth Bear is described as
having a thick and singularly length-
ened muzzle: the head small, the
ears large, the hair on the muzzle at
first smooth and even, it grows sud-
denly rough around the head as far
as the height of the ears, and com-
pletely buries them under a thick
fur, enlarging the head considerably.
The end of the lower lip goes beyond
the upper, and gives to the animal a
stupid look. Its limbs are elevated,
its body long, and its motions easy.
This Bear is often exhibited by the
jugglers for the amusement of the
people. It feeds chiefly on white
ants, fruits, and honey, but it may be
presumed, in viewing the teeth, that
it feeds on flesh like Bears in gene-
ral.


THE RHINOCEROS.
The single-horned Rhinoceros is not
exceeded in size by any land animal
except the elephant, and in strength
and power it gives place to none.
Its nose is armed with a formidable
weapon, a hard and solid horn, some-
times above three feet in length, and
eighteen inches in circumference at
the base, with which it is able to
defend itself against the attack of
every ferocious animal. The tiger
will rather attack the elephant than
the Rhinoceros, which it cannot face
without danger of being torn to
pieces. The body and limbs of the
latter are defended by a skin so hard
as to be impenetrable, except in the
belly, by either a knife or a spear.


THE RHINOCEROS.




It is said, that even to shoot a full-
grown Rhinoceros of advanced age,
it is necessary to use iron bullets,
those of lead having been known to
flatten against the skin.
The upper lip of this animal an-
swers, in some measure, the same
purpose as the trunk of the elephant;
it protrudes over the lower one in
the form of a lengthened tip; and,
being extremely pliable, is used in
catching hold of the branches of trees
and shrubs, and putting them into
the mouth.
The Rhinoceros is generally of a
quiet and inoffensive disposition, but
when attacked or provoked, he be-
comes extremely dangerous. This
animal has a most acute and atten-
tive ear, and runs with great swift-
ness.


THE BISON.
The American Bison has short
rounded horns, pointing outwards.
It is covered, in many parts, with
long shaggy hair, and has a high
protuberance on the shoulders. The
fore parts of the body are exces-
sively thick and strong, and the
hinder parts are comparatively very
slender.
In the interior regions of North
America, immense herds of these
animals are frequently seen. They
feed in the open savannahs morning
and evening; and retire, during the
sultry parts of the day, to rest near
shady rivulets and streams of water;
frequently leaving so deep an im-
pression of their feet in the moist


THE BISON.




[and, as to be thus traced and shot
by the artful Indians.
In this undertaking, however,
great care is necessary, since, when
only wounded, the animals become
excessively furious. In taking aim,
they direct their piece to the hollow
of the shoulder, by which means they
generally bring them down at one
shot. If they do not fall, they imme-
diately run upon their enemy, and,
with their horns and hoofs, as offen-
sive weapons, tear him to pieces and
trample him into the earth. They
are so amazingly strong, that, in
their flight, they frequently knock
down trees as thick as a man’s arm ;
and, be the snow ever so deep, they
are able to plunge through it much
faster than the swiftest Indian can
run in his snow-shoes.


THE BRAHMIN BULL.
No one can visit the gardens of the
Zoological Society without noticing
a beautiful creature known by this
name. It has acquired the title from
its being an animal held in venera-
tion by the Brahmins of India, who
treat it with a degree of homage,
almost amounting to adoration. In
some towns this “ sacred ox of Brah-
ma” is almost a public nuisance.
Numbers of privileged individuals,
wandering at their ease about the
streets, fed by the hands of blind, but
zealous devotees; and thus em-
boldened by the toleration they ex-
perience, they make free with
whatever vegetables they can get

to, or lie down and obstruct the way,
no one daring to strike or drive them
away.
The Brahmin Ox, venerated as it
may be, is,with the exception ofthese
just referred to, and which are ex-
empt from all services, commonly
made use of as a beast of burden. In
some parts of India, it is saddled, but
in general, it is harnessed to a car-
riage, and employed for draught,
Its rate of travelling is from twenty
to thirty miles a day. The Hindoos,
of course, abstain from shedding the
blood of the ‘ ‘ sacred ox, ” but its flesh
is used as food by the Mohammedan
population.


THE ZEBU.
These animals are merely a variety
of the ox, and not a distinct species,
as they were formerly considered
by naturalists. They are natives of
the cultivated parts of southern Asia,
as far as China, and are also met
with in the south of Africa, and on
the eastern coasts, from Abyssinia to
the Cape of Good Hope, where they
supply the place of oxen as beasts of
draught and burden, principally for
purposes of husbandry,
Zebus are often saddled like horses,
and are also used in drawing chariots,
carts, &c. Their usual rate of tra-
velling is said to be from twenty to
thirty miles a day.
The chief difference between the


THE ZEBU.




Zebu and the common ox consists in
the hump on the shoulders of the
former, and its more slender legs.
The hump has been known to weigh
fifty pounds, and is esteemed a great
delicacy.
They are all equally docile and
gentle when tamed; and are in
feneral covered with fine glossy
air, softer and more beautiful than
that of the common cow. In India,
specimens selected by the priests on
account of their beauty and size,
receive especial veneration, and all
are held sacred by the Hindoos, who
consider it a crime to kill them.


THE PERSIAN SHEEP.
For the following account of this ani-
mal we are indebted to Mr. James
Wilson: “ The black headed sheep,
which lived with me as a pet for
nearly a year and a half, was, I un-
derstand, one of a small flock. It
was thin and in poor condition. It
rejoiced greatly in its first feed of
sweet fresh grass, after a sojourn of
some days in a large lumber room.
As winter was approaching, we ge-
nerally housed it in the stable before
night; but it was always on the alert
at an early hour in the morning, and
anxious to be brought to a little plot
of grass before our cottage windows,


THE PERSIAN SHEEP.




where it seemed to enjoy the vicinity
of human beings, and delighted to
be spoken to or fondled by children.
It was extremely mild, gentle, and
affectionate in its disposition, never
attempting to make a butt, or other-
wise annoy its friends. It would
follow us about the garden, and, if
taken no notice of, would frequently
remind one of its presence by a gentle
insertion of its muzzle into the band,
or even the pocket. This habit pro-
bably arose from its being so fre-
quently fed through the day with
bits of bread, biscuit, apples, &c.
To human creatures, especially chil-
dren, it continued much attached.”


THE CASHMERE GOAT.
This celebrated animal is subject to
many varieties, differing both in co-
lour and in the quality of the wool,
or rather the fine hair, of which the
fleece is composed. The principal
points, in the most approved, are
large ears, the limbs slender and
cleanly formed, the horns not spirally
twisted, and, above all, the fleece
being long, straight, silky, and
white.
Besides the true Cashmere sheep,
from which originally the celebrated
Cashmere shawls were made, there
are several others which have been
employed for the same purposes in
different parts of India; and there is
a Tartar half-breed, which has been

found to survive well in a colder
climate, and which has been intro-
duced, with considerable success,
into France. Those most in request,
however, are still brought from the
kingdom of Cashmere. Sixteen
thousand looms are there supposed
to be in constant motion, each giving
employment to three men, and it is
calculated that thirty thousand
shawls are disposed of annually.
The persons employed sit on a
bench at the frame, sometimes four
people at each, but if the shawl is a
plain one, only two. The borders
are worked with wooden needles,
having a separate one for each co-
lour. The rough part of the shawl
is uppermost wnileit is being manu-
factured.


THE ELK.
The Elk, or Moose Deer, have legs
of great length, and a neck so short
that they cannot graze on level
ground like other animals, hut are
obliged to browse the tops of large
plants, and the leaves or branches of
trees. In all their actions and move-
ments they appear very awkward.
In their common walk they lift their
feet very high, and are able, with-
out any difficulty, to step oyer a gate
five feet in height. Their faculty
of hearing is supposed to be more
acute than that of sight or scent,
which renders it a very difficult task
to kill them in the summer time ;
and the Indians have then no other


THE ELK.




method of doing this than by creep-
ing after them under the trees and
bushes, till they get within gun-shot.
In winter the natives are able fre-
quently to run these animals down;
lor their slender legs break through
the snow at every step, and plunge
them up to the belly. They are so
tender-footed and so short-winded,
that a good runner will generally
tire them out in less than a day. In
summer the Elks frequent the mar-
gins of rivers and lakes, getting into
the water in order to avoid the innu-
merable multitudes of musquitoes,
and other flies that pester them
during that season. When pursued
in this situation, they are the most
inoffensive of all animals, never
making any resistance.


THE NYL-GHAU.
The Nyl-ghau is a native of the in-
terior parts of India. In its wild
state it is said to be extremely vi-
cious ; but when domesticated, it is
very tame, and even affectionate.
This animal seems to be somewhat
allied to the bull species. It is rather
more than four feet in height at the
shoulder. The male has got short
horns, and is of a dark gray colour ;
but the female has no horns, and is
of a pale brown.
The sense of smelling in the Nyl-
fhau is very acute. Their mode of
ghting is curious. They fall on
their fore knees a distance apart,


THE NYL-GHAU.




but when within a few yards, they
make a spring, and dart at each
other with such force, as sometimes
to break the enclosure within which
they are kept. In several parts of
India none are allowed to hunt the
Nyl-ghau but princes.
The first Nyl-ghau that was seen
in England, was sent as a present to
Lord Clive, in 1767.


THE WILD BOAR.
This animal is found in all parts of
the globe except in New Holland;
and is the original of all the tame
varieties of the hog. In Europe he
inhabits the dense forests, and fat-
tens upon vegetables and fallen
fruits; or he commits great devas-
tation in the cultivated fields adjoin-
ing his native forests; and, when
pressed by hunger, he will attack
even living animals. In Egypt, on
the contrary, the Wild Boar has no
shelter, but is exposed to the burning
sun ; he traverses the sandy plains,
subsisting on the few scattered shrubs
which those barren districts afford.
The Wild Boar is of a brownish
black over the whole of the body;


THE WILD BOAR.




his snout is longer than that of the
tame hog, and he has formidable
tusks in each jaw, which serve him
as weapons of defence, as well as for
digging his food, which consists
chiefly of roots and vegetables. These
tusks are sometimes nearly a foot in
length, those in the upper jaw being
very sharp; the under tusks are,
however, most to be dreaded, for
with them the animal defends him-
self, and frequently gives mortal
wounds. The old Boar lives usually
alone; but the females unite together,
and with their little ones form very
numerous troops for mutual defence.
The chase of the Wild Boar is
very dangerous; the great strength
of the animal, and his powerful tusks,
render him formidable to the dogs
and hunters.


THE SPANISH MASTIFF.
There is a pair of these beautiful
animals from Cuba in the garden of
the Zoological Society. In the sum-
mer they are chained to separate
kennels, as mastiffs usually are; and
through the winter they are placed
in a den, perfectly sheltered from the
weather.
In their general form they very
much resemble the English mastiff;
they are of a reddish brown, with their
muzzles approaching to a jet black:
they are tractable and gentle.
The dog was entirely unknown to
the inhabitants of the New World,
before the time when it was taken

there by the Europeans; if we except
a very small kind called Alco, which
the Peruvians are said to have tamed
as a sort of lapdog. But these ani-
mals were carried there by the con-
querors, and became very numerous.
One hundred and fifty years ago, in
Hayti, as it is now called, Cuba, and
all the Caribbee Islands, they were
in such multitudes, that they were
occasionally killed to prevent them
from destroying the calves and foals
of the wild cows and mares. Ac-
cording to the account given by the
American voyagers of the seven-
teenth century, these dogs hunted in
packs of fifty or sixty, and they would
attack a herd of wild boars without
any fear.


THE PERSIAN GREYHOUND.
Almost every country of the world
has some kind of dog, and each of
these kinds are trained for different
uses. The Esquimaux dog draws a
sledge, the shepherd’s dog guards a
flock, the mastiff protects a house,
the Spanish blood-hound hunts the
naked Indian to death, while the dog
of St. Bernard rescues the perishing
man at the risk of his own life- lhe
dog is certainly the most faithful
companion of man of all the race of
animals.
Of Greyhounds there are many
varieties, and among them those ot

THE ZEBRA.
In beauty this animal must be con-
fessed as superior to almost any
other quadruped; but its native
wildness defies every effort to render
it serviceable in a domestic state.
These creatures live in herds, Ire-
quentiner the open plains, and usually
in company with the ostrich, where,
bv their beauty and liveliness, they
adorn and animate the dreary scene ;
their voice is remarkably shrill,
somewhat like the sound of a post-

with my pocket telescope; they were
the most beautifully marked animals
I had ever seen: their clean, sleek
limbs glittered in the sun, and the
brightness and regularity of their
striped coats presented a picture of
extraordinary beauty, in which, pro-
bably , they are not surpassed by any
quadruped with which we are at
present acquainted. It is, indeed,
equalled in this particular by the
mountain horse, whose stripes are
more defined and regular, but which
do not offer to the eye so lively a co-
louring.”
There does not appear any reason
why Zebras should not be tamed by
patience, perseverance, and kind
treatment.


THE MANDRILL BABOON.
This formidable animal, the fiercest
and most powerful of its race, is a
native of the Guinea coast, and has
been well known for a long period in
our menageries. When grown to
its full size, the colours of its fur may
vie with any of the four-handed ani-
mals. In the young, the hair is of a
uniform tawny green.
“ Happy Jerry,” the property of
Mr. Cross, and so long the prominent
attraction to Exeter ’Change, was a
Mandrill or Rib-nosed Baboon. He
is described to have been docile to his
keepers, but easily made angry by
strangers. He had been taught to
drink, sling, and smoke tobacco.


THE MANDRILL BABOON.




In the first he delighted, the latter
appeared no favourite; and a bribe
of gin and water was promised be-
fore its performance. His cage was
furnished with a strong arm-chair,
into which, when ordered, he would
seat himself with great gravity.
His keeper having lighted the pipe,
presented it to him ; he inspected it
minutely, sometimes feeling it with
his finger, as if to know if lighted,
before inserting it in his month. It
was then introduced almost up to the
bowl, and retained without any ap-
pearance of smoke for some minutes;
he would then exhale a volume, fill-
ing his cage, from the mouth, nose,
and sometimes even the ears.


THE BONNETED MONKEY.
Monkeys form by far the largest
portion of the four-handed animals.
The variations of their form and
structure are too numerous to follow.
In one species the shape of the head
resembles the human form, while
another can only be compared with
the head of the hound. There is as
much diversity in their degrees of in-
telligence. It is remarkable that this
can only be brought into play in
young animals, which have not at-
tained their full growth: the older
individuals, even of the most tracta-
ble races, losing the docility of youth,
and at length becoming as stupid as
the most barbarous of the tribe.


THE BONNETED MONKEY.




Monkeys are not fitted for abode
on the ground; but are inhabitants
oi trees, for which they are admi-
rably adapted by nature. Hence
they congregate amidst the forests of
Asia, Africa, and South America,
and in the greatest number in the
tropical regions.
The Bonneted Monkey has the
r a** disposed in the form
of a flat bonnet, from which its name
has been derived. When fruits and
succulent plants fail, these animals
are said to eat insects, and sometimes
to watch by the sea-side for crabs
and other shell-fish, which they are
very clever in catching.


THE SPIDER MONKEY.
This animal is called the Spider
Monkey, on account of the length
and slenderness of its legs and tail.
This curious creature, apparently
possessing all the exterior necessa-
ries for great activity, is, neverthe-
less, F. Cuvier remarks, one of the
most sluggish. It moves with slow-
ness, and, as it were, with a dragging
motion. The limbs are placed where
they are required with deliberation,
and. as if every movement required
a fresh exercise of thought to deter-
mine its position. The tail is con-
stantly made use of, and is never re-
lieved from one object until the feet
are firmly fixed, when it is again

Gr




wound round some other object of
support, as if the former were not
sufficiently able to maintain it.
F. Cuvier gives a description of a
young female which joined to a con-
siderable degree of intelligence a
mild and affectionate disposition.
1 he body of these animals are co-
vered with long, soft, and silky, but
strong black hair, thinner on the un-
der parts, and without any mixture
oi a woolly texture. The fore extre-
mities want the thumbs, the hinder
are formed like the other four-handed
cr eatures, but with longer fingers-
and the long tail is terminated on the'
under side by a tender and fine skin
which seems to be endowed, like the
hands, with the sense of touch.


THE LLAMA.
Llamas bear a general resemblance
to camels, but are smaller, and have
no hump on their backs. They are na-
tives of South America, where they
are used as beasts of burden. Before
the conquest of Peru, they were the
only animals so employed by the peo-
ple ; since that time, the increase of
the horse, and the superior vigour
and sagacity of mules, have dimi-
nished their importance and conse-
quent numbers among men; still,
however, many are used by the
poorer inhabitants in the difficult
passes of the mountains. When
overloaded, they are apt to lie down.


THE LLAMA.




and they will on such occasions re-
refuse to rise, notwithstanding every
method is tried by their drivers to
induce them to proceed; yet the
larger species will carry a man of
moderate weight, and trot, or rather
run, with great swiftness, for several
miles. The weight usually imposed
does not exceed one hundred and
fifty pounds, which they convey from
sixteen to twenty miles a day. The
hair is long, soft, elastic, ana woolly
on the neck, throat, body, and tail;
it is close and short on the head and
limbs. Llamas revenge themselves
on any one who may chance to dis
please them by spitting on them ; but
their saliva does no injury.


THE AMERICAN BLACK
SQUIRREL.
The Squirrels are for the most part
light, nimble, and elegant animals,
climbing trees with the utmost
agility, and springing, with astonish-
ing security, from one branch to
another. Some of them are provided
with hairy membranes, extending
from the fore to the hind legs;
which, when spread out, by render-
ing them more buoyant, enable them
to leap through considerable dis-
tances from tree to tree. Some form
their nests and live almost entirely in
the trees ; and others burrow under
the ground. None of them eat flesh.
Many of the Squirrels may be tamed;


THE AMERICAN BLACK SQUIRREL.




but when they are in the least irri-
tated, they attempt to bite. In con-
finement they are generally very
playful. When they are on the
ground they advance by leaps; and
in eating they sit erect and hold the
food in their fore paws.
The Black Squirrel is a native of
North America. It is the least of all
the American races, is much shorter
in the tail than the gray Squirrel, and
the ears are nearly naked.
The gray Squirrel is very fond of
warmth, and in a captive state, to-
wards evening, will collect all the
hay and straw in its cage, form it
into a ball, and retire to "rest in the
midst of it until morning. In its
native woods it passes its winters in
the hollow trunks of trees, where its
stores are deposited.


THE VIRGINIAN OPOSSUM.
This animal is furnished with a bag
under the body. It has ten front
teeth in the upper, and eight in the
lower jaw. From the formation of
its feet, which, in some respects, are
like those of monkeys, it is evident
that its motions on the ground must
be difficult and awkward. As a
compensation, however, for this ap-
parent defect, it is able to ascend
trees with wonderful agility. There,
by the help of its tail, which is so mus-
cular and flexile as to admit of being
coiled firmly round the branches,
it is more active than most other
quadrupeds. Sometimes it will
continue for a long time together
with its body suspended, and on the


THE VIRGINIAN OPOSSUM.




watch for prey. At other times, like
monkeys and squirrels, it will leap
from tree to tree, in pursuit, or to
escape from its enemies. If an Opos-
sum be pursued and overtaken, it will
feign itself dead till the danger is
over. M. du Pratz says, “ It will
not, when seized in this condition,
exhibit signs of life, though even
placed on a red-hot iron; and when
there are any young in the pouch of
a female, she will suffer both herself
and them to be roasted alive rather
than give them up. This creature
never moves till its assailant is either
gone to a distance, or has concealed
himself. It is so difficult to kill, that,
in North Carolina, there is a well-
known saying, ‘ If a cat has nine
lives, the Opossum has nineteen.’ ”


THE FLYING SQUIRREL.
The Flying Squirrel is found in all
the northern regions, both of the old
and new continents. It is distin-
guished by a membraneous conti-
nuation of the skin of the sides and
belly, which extends from the fore to
the hind feet, and assists it greatly in
making leaps from one tree to ano-
ther. Its head is small and round;
its eyes are full, round, and black;
and its ears small and naked. It is
smaller than the common Squirrel,
lives in trees, and sleeps in the day,
but is very active during the night.
In the act of leaping, the loose skin
is stretched out by the feet, whereby
the animal becomes lighter in pro-

H




portion to its bulk, and it appears
to sail or 8y from one place to ano-
ther. Where numbers of them are
seen at a time leaping, they are said
to appear like leaves blown off' by
the wind.
In the islands of the East Indies,
is a variety as large as a hare, called
the Taguar, or Great Flying Squir-
rel, which perfectly resembles the
other in figure, and in the form of its
lateral membrane. The head is
smaller in proportion to the size of
the body ; the colour of the skin is
dark brown, mixed with white, and
the tail is brown. Its bite is so
strong, that it can with ease make
its escape from a wooden cage.


THE RACCOON.
The colour of this animal is gray;
and its head is somewhat like that
of a fox. The face is white; and the
eyes, which are large, are surrounded
with a black band, from which a
dusky stripe runs along the nose.
The tail is very bushy, the back is
somewhat arched; and the fore legs
are shorter than the others. The
length of the Raccoon is about two
feet from the nose to the tail, and
the tail is about a foot long. It is a
native of North America, and it in-
habits the hollow of trees. It feeds
on maize, sugar-cane, fruits, birds,
eggs, shell-fish, and various other


THE RACCOON.




things. These animals are fond of
oysters and crabs, in the taking of
which they exhibit much cunning.
The Raccoon will stand on the side
of a swamp, and hang its tail over
into the water ; which the crabs, mis-
taking for food, lay hold of; and as
soon as the beast feels them pinch,
he pulls them out with a sudden jerk,
and devours them. These animals
feed chiefly by night.


THE WOMBAT.
This curious little animal is a na-
tive erf New Holland. It is about
the size of a badger. It burrows in
the earth, and lives upon vegetables,
either green or withered. Its colour
is a brownish cinnamon, rather paler
under the neck, and round the ears
than elsewhere. The colonists call
it the bear, from a slight resemblance
in its form to that of a small brown
animal of that kind.
Indeed we find, that Cuvier de-
scribes it as a species isolated in na-
ture, forming the type of genus, and
itself solely constituting that genus.
Its relations to other mammalia are
so remote, that it is uncertain to


THE WOMBAT.




what order it should be referred. It
is true, it carries its young in a
pouch, like the opossum ; but this
family is so far from being governed
by the laws that regulate the animal
kingdom in general, that its leading
character does not necessarily sup-
pose the presence of any other.
Wombats, when tamed, appear
rather to be habituated to the pre-
sence of men in general, than to
distinguish or know them as indi-
viduals. All their motions are ex-
cessively slow. They suffer them-
selves to be carried off without re-
sistance, and when set again on the
ground they move no faster than be-
fore.


THE ARMADILLO.
Armadillos are natives of South
America, and of the province of Pa-
raguay. Some inhabit the forests;
others are found in the open country.
There are several species, all of
which are covered with a coat of
mail, or a kind of plate-armour, re-
sembling the covering of the pango-
lin, or scaly ant-eater, and the shell
of the tortoise. This shell covers
the upper parts of the animal, and
consists of four or five different divi-
sions. The head may be said to have
a helmet, and the shoulders, a buck-
ler, composed of several series of
plates. Transverse bands, varying
in the different species, from three


THE ARMADILLO.




to twelve, which are moveable, cover
the body; the crupper has its buck-
ler similar to that on the shoulder,
and the tail is protected by numerous
rings.
. I* l a living state, the whole armour
is capable of yielding to the motion
of the body; the pieces or plates
being connected like the joints in the
tail of a lobster. The legs are thick
and strong, but only just long enough
to raise the body from the ground ;
the nails are used for digging, and
the mole, it is said, is not more ex-
pert in burrowing the earth. These
animals can neither leap, run, nor
climb ; so that, when pursued, they
can only escape by hiding themselves
in their holes


THE BEAVER.
These industrious little animals live
together in companies of about two
or three hundred.
Beavers erect their houses on piles,
with arched tops, giving them the
appearance of a dome on the outside,
and plastering the inside with sur-
prising neatness. The walls are
about two feet thick; and the floors
so much higher than the surface of
the water, as always to prevent
them from being flooded. Some of
their houses have only one floor,
others have three, and the number of
inmates vary from two to thirty.
They sleep on the floor, which is
strewed with leaves and moss; and

each one is said to have its own
place. It costs a whole season to
build the houses of a new settlement
and lay in their winter provisions •
which consists principally of bark
and the tender branches of trees cut
into certain lengths, and piled in
heaps under water.
All the mo vements of Beavers are
conducted with regularity; for this
purpose an overseer is chosen, whose
commands are punctually obeyed •

THE PACA.
These curious little animals inhabit
most of the eastern parts of South
America. Their place of abode is
generally in the forests, and, d pos-
sible, near some water.
The Paca, when full grown, is
about two feet in length, and about
one foot in height, but of a thickset
and clumsy form. Its eyes are large
arid prominent, its nose broad and
blackish, and its ears nearly naked.
It has five toes on each ot its leet.
Its claws are broad, thick, and well
formed for digging. This animal,
when attacked, makes an obstinate
resistance '■ and if it finds no other
means of escaping from its enemies,


THE PACA.




it flies to the water, and by so doing,
frequently saves its life, as it can
both dive and swim very well. Its
flesh is very sweet, and is the prin-
cipal food in many parts of its native
climate. It is never to be seen in the
day-time, but goes in search of food
always at night, its principal being
the sugar-cane, but it not able to get
that, it feeds on herbs and fruits.


THE CRESTED PORCUPINE.
The Porcupine is very harmless and
inoffensive, never becoming the ag-
gressor ; and, when pursued, rt
climbs the first tree it can reach,
where it remains till the patience of
its adversary is exhausted.
If, however, it is roused to self-de-
fence, even the lion dares not meet
it. Upon the smallest irritation, it
raises its quills, and shakes them
with great violence, directing them
to that quarter whence it is in clanger
of being attacked, and striking at the
object of its resentment with them
at the same time. It has been ob-
served on such occasions, when the


THE PORCUPINE.




animal was moulting or casting its
quills, that they would fly out, to the
distance of a few yards, with such
force as to bend the points of them
against any hard substance they
struck: the largest of the quills are
from ten to fifteen inches in length,
thick in the middle, and extremely
sharp at the end. Between the quills,
the hair is thin, black, and bristly;
and the tail is covered with white
quills, which are short. The Crested
Porcupine has four toes before and
five behind; and is found in India,
Persia, and Palestine.


THE INDIAN TORTOISE.
The largest of the land species is
that brought from India. It grows
to the length of four feet, and is en-
tirely of a dull brown colour. The
shell of this species is used in the
manufacture of combs, exquisitely
carved specimens of which are com-
mon in the bazaars of India.
The Tortoise, when caught by the
Eastern Islanders, is suspended over
a fire kindled immediately after its
capture, until the effect of the heat
loosens the shell, so that it can be
easily removed. The animal, now
stripped and defenceless, is set at
liberty. If caught in the ensuing
season, or at any subsequent period,


THE INDIAN TORTOISE.




it is asserted that the unhappy crea-
ture is subject to a second trial of
tire, rewarding its cruel captors, this
time, with a very thin shell. At
ban Blass, on the coast of Darien, a
small settlement of Indians are esta-
blished for the sole purpose of taking
Tortoises, and they make a vast
profit by the shells. The quantity
ot 1 ortoise-shell taken by them, on an
average, amounts to fifteen thousand
pounds weight, per year, the value
ot which is about twenty-eightthou-
sand pounds; and in some years
they have taken thirty-two thousand
pounds worth of shells. The hand-
somest shell, and consequently the
most valuable, is stripped from the
animal whilst living, the beauty of
the shell being diminished by the
death of the Tortoise.


THE HARPY EAGLE.
The Harpy Eagle inhabits the warm
f arts of North and South America,
ts predatory powers are denoted by
its robust legs, and the crooked form
of its beak and talons; the upper jaw
being verv sharp. By this structure
and the shortness of the wings, it is
readily distinguished from the other
Eagles.
The usual length of a full grown
one is three feet and a half from
beak to tail. The head is covered
with a thick downy plumage of slaty
gray with a crest of black and gray
leathers rising from the back part of
the head. The back, wings, and fore
part ofthe neck are black, the feathers


THE HARPY-EAGLE.
K




of the back terminating with a rather
lighter hue; and from the breast
backwards they are pure white.
The tail is ashy, banded with black.
It is quarrelsome, sullen, and fierce.
Travellers state that, in its native
forests, Guiana, the Harpy Eagle
commonly feeds upon the two species
of sloth, and carries off in its talons
fawns and other young quadrupeds.
A specimen of this Eagle, which had
been tamed, seized with his talons
some monkeys, which had approach-
ed too near his cage, and devoured
them entire, with the exception of
a few bones, having first carefully
skinned them.


THE BUTCHER-BIRD.
The Butcher-bird is a native both
of Europe and America; it is about
ten inches in length. Its bill is black,
and hooked at the end. The upper
parts of the plumage are of a pale ash-
colour ; and the wings and tail are
black, with white. The throat, breast,
and belly are of a dirty white ; the
legs are black. He seizes the smaller
birds by the throat, and thus stran-
gles them. When his victim is dead,
he fixes it on some thorn, and tears it
to pieces with his bill- When con-
fined in a cage, he often treats his
food in much the same manner, by-
sticking it against the wires before he


THE BUTCHER-BIRD.




devours it; and from this he derives
his title of Butcher-bird. In spring
and summer he imitates the voice of
other birds, by way of decoying
them within his reach, that he may
devour them. In America it adopts
an odd stratagem for the purpose of
decoying its prey. A gentleman
there, observing several grasshop-
pers stuck upon the sharp thorny
branches of the trees, inquired the
cause, and was informed that they
were put there by this bird in order
to entice the small birds, which feed
on insects, into a situation from
whence he could dart on and seize
them.


THE EMEU.
The Emeu, when full grown, stands
nearly seven feet high, the bill is
straight and pointed ; the feathers
appear like hair: their colour is a
dull brown, varied with dirty gray.
The wings are small, and clothed
with feathers like the back, and hang
over the body on each side. Its form
is like that of the ostrich, but its legs
are longer, its neck shorter, and it is
altogether of a more clumsy make.
The food of the Emeu consists of
grass, berries, roots, and seeds. Like
the ostrich, it runs with amazing
speed, so that it can be chased down
by none but the swiftest dogs, nor by


THE EMEU.




them but in open pastures. The
Emeu is much hunted for its oil; the
bird frequently weighs a hundred
pounds ; and its taste, when cooked,
rather resembles beef than fowl. The
only parts used for food are the
thighs, which, in a full grown bird,
are large and heavy. Emeus are
easily tamed, bear the climate of
England well, and have been reared
in different collections. When the
female has laid her eggs, the male
bird sits upon them for nine weeks,
and when the young are hatched, he
takes the entire charge of them.]


THE OSTRICH.
This is the largest of all birds, and
few inmates of a menagerie attract
more attention than the Ostrich.
The Ostrich reaches the height of
eight feet and upwards, and is al-
most confined to Africa and Arabia.
Its wings are sufficient for sustaining
its bulky body in the air, but the
chief security of Ostriches from dan-
ger, is the speed with which they
run. The Arabs hunt them on horse-
back, and have reduced the chase
to an art. They begin the pursuit
by a gentle gallop, for should they
at the outset act at all rashly, the
matchless speed of the game would
carry it in a short time beyond their


THE OSTRICH.




reach. But when they proceed gra-
dually, it makes no particular effort
to escape. When tamed, they will
allow themselves to be ridden like
horses. The wings of the Ostrich
have no quill feathers, but are clothed
with graceful plumes; the latter
likewise form the tail. The neck is
disproportionably long, the superior
half being covered with thin down;
the head is small, and similarly co-
vered, except on the top, which is
bald. The eyes are large; the ge-
neral colour is ashy-brown, tipped
with white, and the feathers so much
prized, are obtained from beneath
the wings and tail.


THE DEMOISELLE CRANE.
This Crane is a native of North
Africa. French writers describe the
bird as a Demoiselle, from the ac-
cordance of its form and gestures to
those of a slender female. It is the
most elegant of the Cranes. Its full
height is about three feet and a half,
and its length about three feet; of
which measurement the body forms
but a small portion, the neck and
legs being very long. The plumage
of the body is slaty gray, the sides
of the head and neck black, and
from the lower part of the latter,
over the breast, hang long slender
black feathers; the quill feathers are
also partly dingy black, as are the


THE DEMOISELLE CRANE.

legs and claws. This species is found
along the shores of the Mediterra-
nean, feeding on fish, and is most
abundant at Tripoli. Their manners
are gentle, and their attitudes ele-
gant, though not seldom uncouth,
especially when they may be said to
imitate dancing. At Florence, a
bird of this species was taught to
dance to a tune which was played or
sung to it. They have long legs, the
lower part of which are bare of fea-
thers, so that they may wade through
or stand in the water, without wet-
ting their plumage, when watching
for prey,


THE
RING-NECKED PHEASANT.
The Ring-necked Pheasant chiefly
inhabits the forests of China, where
the common species is also abundant.
The eggs of the ringed bird also
differ: they are of a pale bluish-
green, with small marks of a deeper
tint; while those of the common
Pheasant are of an olive white, and
without any spots. The Ringed
Pheasant, in its wild state, is always
of a smaller size, the extreme length
never exceeding two feet five inches,
and the tail is much shorter in pro-
portion to the body. The head is of
a whitish fawn colour, tinted with
bluish-green; and above each eye


THE RING-NECKED PHEASANT.




there are two white lines, forming a
sort of eyebrow. The markings on
the back are different and
the white ring, broadest upon the
sides of the neck, is a mark which
can never be mistaken.
The female is smaller than the
male. The ground colour of her
plumage is brown. There are no
dark spots upon the breast, and the
barring of the tail is very distinctly
marked; but the principal distinc-
tion in the female, is a little band of
thick and black feathers, which runs
a short way under each eye, which is
wanting on the male.


THE GOLDEN PHEASANT.
The head of this bird is crested and
even more amply than that of the
Silver Pheasant; the tail is broad;
folded, and bending, and the neck is
adorned with a ruff of broad, but
short feathers, which fall like a hood„
and can be raised and depressed at
the will of the bird. This form is
exhibited only by the present bird,,
and another called Amherstia.
This Pheasant is so generally
known that a detailed description
is unnecessary, particularly where
words are so inadequate to convey an
idea of the brightness of the plumage.
In addition to the brilliant ruff of
golden orange, and black, differing


THE GOLDEN PHEASANT.




from the plumage of the Pheasants,
we have the feathers covering the
rump particularly upon the sides,
long, narrow, with loose webs, but
of a texture quite stiff and almost
horny. The plumage of the female
is of a brownish colour, broken with
black crescent-formed bars, and the
tail is short.
This bird is a native of China. It
is kept in a domestic state, and may
now be procured in considerable
numbers from many parts in the
south of England,


THE WILD COCK.
This beautiful bird is a native of the
continent of India, inhabiting the
highest wooded districts, particu-
larly Hindoostan, where, among En-
glish sportsmen, it receives the name
of Jungle Fowl; and specimens of it,
next to the Bankion cock, are much
the most frequent in collections in
this country. In size, it is nearly
equal to an ordinary domestic fowl,
the proportions rather more slender
and graceful: the comb is large, and
with an unequal margin; and double
wattles hang from the base of the
under jaw. But the most singular
part in the plumage is in the form of
the shaft in all the long hackled fea-


THE WILD COCK




thers: those of the neck, wing, and
tail coverts have a dark grayish
ground, but the shafts are of a bright
golden orange, and in the centre and
at the tip dilate into a flat horny
plate, similar to what is seen in the
wings and tail of the Bohemian wax-
wing. The centre of the back, the
throat, breast, belly, and thighs are
of a deep and rich gray, having the
shafts and edges of a paler tint. The
tail is of a rich and deep green: the
feathers which immediately succeed
the long hackles of a rieh purple,
edged with a pale yellow, and those
immediately succeeding, of a golden
green, edged with gray. The bill,
legs, and feet are yellow.


THE BARBARY PARTRIDGE.
This handsome bird belongs to a
small group of Partridges which are
remarkable for the beautiful ap-
pearance of the feathers covering
the flanks. The general tint of plu-
mage is very regular throughout;
the bill and legs are always red, and
the latter are sometimes slightly
spurred and knotted. They inhabit
Europe, the north of Africa, and
India.
The most familiar example is the
common Red-legged French, or, as
it is sometimes termed, Guernsey
Partridge. There are others equally
beautiful, but less known. The
Rock, or Barbary Partridge, inha-
bits the most southern countries of


THE BARBARY PARTRIDGE.
M




Europe, stretching into Spain, and
then upon the coast of Africa. It
delights in rocky districts and the
rugged precipices of the southern
Alps, and seldom or ever strays down
upon the plains. It is distinguished
from all the other species by the patch
of deep chestnut upon the sides of the
neck, beautifully relieved by the
clear white spots. It is not very
commonly met with in collections,
being, like almost all the birds of
southern Europe, more difficult to be
procured than those of more distant
countries. The Greek Partridge is
found also abundantly upon the Ger-
man Alps, of middling height, never
descending to the plains or low
valleys. These birds scarcely stretch
into France, appearing rarely in
some of the higher mountainous pro-
vinces.


THE SPOONBILL.
This bird differs from the stork only
in the singular form of its bill,
which, as its name imports, is
shaped like a spoon, This organ is
unlike that of other birds in struc-
ture as well as shape; for, instead
of being hard, it is soft and flexible
like leather. The bill is, indeed, the
distinguishing characteristic of the
tribe, of which there are five species.
The White Spoonbill is somewhat
less than the wild goose. It is a na-
tive of the coasts of Europe, especi-
ally of Holland, whence the speci-
mens in the Zoological Gardens were
obtained. The plumage is pure
white, with yellowish marks on the
breast, sides, and about the eyes and


THE SPOONBILL.




throat. The bill is black, margined
with a bluish tinge, and tipped with
pale yellow; the legs and feet are
black. The only sound it produces
is by snapping its jaws, which it
does when excited. It builds in trees,
or amidst the reeds of marshes, and
feeds on fishes, frogs, snakes, and
grass. It is tame in the poultry-
yards ; and the flesh resembles that
of a goose, especially when the bird is
young. Spoonbills live in flocks. In
Srocuring their prey, they do not
art out the beak, but use it much in
the same manner as the duck, feed-
ing in the mud and dirty water, with
the broad end of its beak, at the same
time opening and shutting the jaws.
They swim with considerable ease,
owing to the extent of webs between
the toes.


THE SCARLET IBIS.
T. he Ibis was held in great esteem
by the Egyptians; they paid divine
honour to it, and the killing of this
bird was held as a capital crime. It
was, likewise, adopted by the Egyp-
tians as the emblem of their country,
and the symbol of the overflowing of
the Nile. At present, the Ibis is
rather uncommon in that country, at
least in Lower Egypt; it is, however,
found in South Africa.
The Scarlet Ibis, although a native
of South America, is thought to be
the same as the Ibis of ancient
Egypt. It has a long and slender
bill, which curves downwards to-
wards the end; the head and neck
are sometimes bare. The adult


THE SCARLET IBIS.




plumage is a most brilliant scarlet
colour, except the tips of the wings,
which are black: the size of the bird
is that of a common fowl. The newly-
hatched young are covered with
down, which is successively blackish
ash-colour, and almost white ; they
then begin to fly; after the second
moulting the red tinge appears, and
increases with age, the scarlet at
length becoming of intense brilliancy.
The Ibis is easily domesticated:
in which case it may be seen search-
ing in the ground for earth-worms,
and roosting with poultry. The cold-
ness of this country, compared with
its native climate, must however
check its extensive domestication.


THE TOUCAN.
This bird is a native of South Ame-
rica. He is about the size of the
magpie, but his beak is one-third
as big as the rest of his body; his
head is large and strong, and his
neck very short, in order more easi-
ly to support the weight of his beak.
Ihe tongue of this bird is not less
singular than its beak, being several
inches in length, but so narrow as
tahave the appearance of a piece of
whalebone. The plumage of the up-
per parts of the body, throat, and
neck is of a glossy black, tinged with
green, the breast is orange colour :
the belly, sides, thighs, and short
leathers of the tail are bright red ;

the rest of the tail is a greenish black,
tipped with red. Monkeys are very
great enemies to this bird, frequently
attacking their nests, and destroying
their young.
The Toucan is easily tamed, and
when in a domestic state, will eat
almost anything that is offered to it:
but it is said to be particularly fond
of grapes. These birds live the
greater part of the year on fruits.
But they do sometimes eat flesh.
