WAR
PRODUCTION
BY
GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDENS' LTD.


’ROUND THE G.M.H.
FACTORIES IN AUSTRALIA
Here are a few pictures of typical G.M.H.
people around the Company’s factories.
These are some of the men and women who
are helping Australian Industry in its job
of war production. Every day they’re
tackling some tough problem — but they’re
getting things done.


THIS booklet has been prepared for the information of the members of the
G.M.H. Family Employees, Shareholders, Distributors, and Dealers.
Its publication is the result of many requests for authentic information about
the Company’s war production. Even employees have not known what is
being done in other plants; and Shareholders, Distributors and Dealers have
a natural interest in knowing the extent to which the Company’s facilities have
been turned over to the manufacture of war supplies. This booklet deals with
much of the work we are doing but for obvious reasons, details of some of the
projects cannot be given.
The G.M.H. Policy is clear cut and definite the war effort comes first.
Nothing is allowed to interfere with the execution of that policy. Today our
activities are 80% to 90% devoted to war production. In this connection
it is worth recalling that the Chairman, Hon. E. W. Holden, M.L.C., in his
address at the last annual meeting of Shareholders said
“We are in a State of War when profits are a secondary consideration
compared with the effectiveness of the Company’s effort in playing its
part in the War activities in Australia.” '
All employees from top to bottom are carrying on the Company’s war policy
with a willingness and enthusiasm that are outstanding. All are doing their
best to support the Fighting Forces, including 750 of their own colleagues who
have enlisted.
For some of the projects in our factories we act as organising contractors. In such
cases we accept responsibility for final assembly and delivery of the particular
products, making some of the components in our own Works and arranging for
other of the parts to be made by other Manufacturers and Engineers. We are
working with over 700 such firms at present. This system which has worked
with conspicuous success has brought forward and made the most efficient use
of the country’s industrial skill.
Everyone at each of the General Motors-Holden’s plants is doing his or her
best to meet every demand for greater and faster war production. We are
thankful that our peace-time experience of planning and organising for quantity
production has helped us to handle this work efficiently.

PRECISION
ENGINEERING
Meticulous accuracy is vital in the production of modern
war supplies. To ensure accuracy and efficiency at every
stage of manufacture and greatest speed of output G.M.H.
is equipped with many modern precision instruments. The
pictures on this page show: —
1. E.M.F. Crack Detector for steel parts. Part is magnetised when
placed in tester and when special fluid containing iron filings is
poured over part the iron
filings adhere to any cracks
that may be present.
2. Profllometer machine
the only one in Australia.
Used for testing surface
finish.
3. Electro-limit Comparator
used for high precision
checking of gauges.
4. Connecting Rod Align-
ment Tester for checking
alignment of connecting rod
bores.
5. “ Rockwell ” Hardness
Tester for determining hard-
ness of any kind of metal
to specifications.
6. Cathetometer Optical
Measuring Instrument for
checking dimensions of all
parts to blueprints.
7. Measuring Screw Thread
Gauge on Pratt & Whitney
Measuring Machine, capable
of measuring to 100,000 th
of an inch.
8. “ Westminster ” Profile
Projector for projecting
screw threads, small con-
tours, etc., against standard
profile gauges.
9. Dial Indicator for mea-
suring concentricity of cam-
shafts and other parts.
10. Surface Table used for
checking Anti - Tank Gun
tools (possible to check to
10,000 th of an inch).
11. Section of the Gauge
Checking Room (Tempera-
ture Controlled).

VAST PRODUCTION
OF WAR SUPPLIES
AT GENERAL MOTORS’
OVERSEAS PLANTS
Military vehicles aircraft engines aircraft components shells machine
guns diesel engines. These are some of the war supplies now being produced
in quantity by General Motors factories in England, Canada, in other British
Dominions, and in the United States. As in Australia, war work comes first
and the facilities of General Motors have been placed at the disposal of the
Governments of these various countries; they are being used today almost to
the limit of their capacity. In England Vauxhall, whose mechanised Army
equipment proved to have the best combat record, has been entrusted with very
great responsibilities. The above picture shows officials inspecting a Pratt and
Whitney 1,200 h.p. Aircraft Engine, which will be manufactured and assembled
at a great new General Motors plant in America. This plant, alone, will employ
10,000 persons.
