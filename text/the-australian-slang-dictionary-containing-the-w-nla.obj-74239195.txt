PREFACE.
My aim in compiling this small Dictionary is to place
in the hands of the police and the public a work
through which they may become conversant with the
slang terms used by the rogue fraternity as a me Hum
of communication with each other.
A number of these terms are used by criminals to
act in a similar manner to pass words used by different
secret anl friendly societies., Although I have entitled
this book the ? Australian Slang Dictionary,? I
would ask the reader to bear in mind that but few
of the terms it contains have been invented by
Australian criminals; the most of them have been
brought into use by the criminal classes who have
emigrate 1 here from different parts of the world
where criminals have had almost a language of their
own for centuries past.
I trust the circulation of this work will hive the
desired effect of preventing criminals, rogues and
gamblers from conversing with impunity in the
presence of the police and public.

Church Bill,
Meet me at net to darkman in blooming slum near
the old padding ken to dispose of the swag. I know a
lavender cove and a swag chovey bloke that will take some
of the white yacks. We must get a thimble faker to christen
and church the redge yacks. I gave a skikster?s red thimble
and slang and a cat to my mollishes for stalling while we
cracked the faker?s chovey. The noise of milling the glaze
brought tray flies. She chucked a reeler, and was lugged
before the beaks and was fined a bull. I met owt men of the
world tray lightmans ago. I chucked a dummy while they
buzzed the clys of owt old blokes with nail cans. They
made owt finnips, a couter, a red yack and jerry and red spark
prop. I got my regulars. lam now flush of balsam, but on
the shallow, and don?t go near the boozing kens to avoid
suspicion. When we dispose of the swag and get our
regulars we will go to the ballum rancum next week. I met
an old flame of mine to lightmans that I thought was put to
bed with a spade and shovel stretches ago. May I dance at
my death if I knew her when she said ? Bob, old pal, tip us
your daddle, my bene cove.? She does not now attend the
?cock and hen club, as she got japanned by the Salvos. Don?t
forget net to darkness. Mum now. Send this stiff to blazes.
Yours truly,
1/6.
[translation.]
Dear Wm.,
Meet me at ten o?clock to-night in the narrow lane
near the old lodging house to dispose of the proceeds of our
recent burglaries. I know a pawnbroker and a receiver of
stolen property, who will take some of the silver watches.
We must get a watchmaker to alter the names and numbers,
and put new cases on the gold watches. I gave a lady?s gold
watch and chain and muff to my fancy girl for keeping watch
while we broke into the jeweller?s shop. The noise of break-
ing the window brought three policemen. She shammed
drunkenneness. They arrested her, and brought her before


the magistrate?, and she was fined five shillings. I met three-
pickpockets twm days ago. I shammed in a fit. while they
picked the pockets of two old gentlemen with tall hats.
They stole two five-pound notes and a sovereign, a gold
watch and chain, and gold and diamond scarf pin. I got my
share. I have plenty of money, but am wearing shabby
clothes, and I don?t go near the public houses to avoid
suspicion. When we dispose of the property, and we get our
share of the money, we will go to the social of thieves and
flash women, to he held next week, I met an old sweetheart
of mine to-day that I thought was dead and buried years
ago. May Ibe hanged if I knew her when she said, ? Robert,
old comrade, give me your hand, my good fellow.? She
does not now attend the society of thieves and prostitutes, as
she got converted by the Salvation Army. Don?t forget ten
o?clock to.night, and don?t mention it to anyone. Burn this
letter.
Yours truly,

ROBERT TANNER.
Back slang, which is much used by street-sellers and some-
larrikins as the channel of conveying their ideas, is generally
formed by pronouncing words backwards. There is exception
made to this ruD in the case of woids which cannot be
agreeably sounded by a backward pronunciation, and to meet
this difficulty in harmony various means are made use of. At
times it happens (hat a syllable is added or prefixed to the
word in order to give it an aspect quite foreign to what the
uninitiated might have expected. Again, if a word of one
syllable does not admit of being sounded by pronouncing the
letters backwards, another syllable is introduced, so that the
monosyllable becomes a dissyllable. Frequently, for the
sake of sound, h at the beginning of a word is pronounced as
if c were before it. It also happens that the initial letters at
the beginning of words are made to exchange their positions.
Great difficulty presents itself in unravelling some words of
back slang. The trouble arises from the way in which the


original words were spelt backwards. I here give examples
of the general rule and various exceptions thereto that I have
touched upon, adding that letters often exchange their
positions in words in order to please the ear :
Doog, good Net, ten
Emag, game Occabot, tobacco
Xool, look Reeb, beer
Eslop, policeman Dob tros, a bad sort
Lawt, tail Nevis stretch, seven years
Yannep, penny Nosrap, a person
Esclops, police Owt, two
Yanneps, pence Revlis, silver
Nammows, women Genol, long
Flatch, half Steswart, trousers
Tatch, a hat Warrob. a barrow
Dunop, a pound Yob, a boy
Elrig, a girl Taf, fat
Pout of stint, a pint of stout
There is also a rhyming slang in existence, but I believe it-
is seldom used in the Colonies, on which account I shall only
give a few examples of it.
Abrahams willing, a shilling
Artful dodger, a lodger
Birch broom, a room
Bushy park, a lark
Cain and Abel, a table
Castle rag, a flag
Charing Cross, a horse
Daisy roots, a pair of boots
Ding dong, a song
Elephants trunk, drunk
Epsom races, a pair of braces
Flag unfurled, a man of the world
Fly my kite, a light
Garden gate, a magistrate
Hod of mortar, a pot of porter
I?m afloat, a boat
Isabella, an umbrella
Read and w'rite, a fight
Turtle doves, a pair of gloves


The following is taken from Davitt?s Diary
? Shor ditch?lB7o
? ?DEERE JIM
? was in quod, doiu 14 days when i heerd you was
lagged i blaklied Polly S ?s peepers who called me names
she was fuddled and hit me fust, when i kolered her nut and
give her a fine slugging and her mug was ail over blud the
spiteful thing bit me she did, and funked fight, when we were
both taken by the Kopper, and the beek only giv me 14 days,
and her got 21 for bitten me fust and been fuddled, cheer up
Jim i am sorry wot you are lagged, and i wont pal with
nobody wile your in quoit, good uy Jim from your tru luv
Sally.?
? Happy the days vhen I vorked avay,
In my usual line in the prigging lay ;
Making from this and that and t?other,
A tidy living without no bother.
When my little crib vas stored vith swag,
And my cly ( a ) vas a velldined money-bad.
Jollv vas 1 for I feared no evil,
Funked (5) at nought, and pitched care to the devil.
I had, besides my blunt, my blowen,
* So gay, so nutty (c), and so knowing ; ?
On the very best of grub (d) we lived,
And sixpence a quartern for gin I gived :
My toggs ( e ) was the sporting'st bunt could buy,
And a slap up out-and-outer was I.
Yith my mot on my arm, and my tile on my head,
That ere?s a gemman every one said.
A-coming avay from Wauxhall one night,
I cleared out a muzzy covey (f) quite ;
He?d been a-strutting avay like a king,
And on his digit (g) he sported a ring,
A diamond sparkle, flash, and knowing.
Thinks I, I?ll vatch the vay he?s going,
And fleece my gemman neat and clever,
Or, at least, I?ll try my best endeavour.


? A?ter the singing and firevorks vas ended,
I follows my gemman the way he bended ;
In a dark corner I trips up his heels,
Then for his tattler and reader I feels ;
I pouches his blunt, and I draws his ring,
Prigged his buckles and everything.
And saying, 4 1 thinks as you can?t follow, man,?
I pikes me off to Ikey Solomon (h).
Then it happened, d?ye see, that my mot,
Yellow (i) a-bit 'bout the swag I?d got,
Thinking that I should jeer and laugh,
Although I never tips no chaff
Tries her hand at the downy trick,
And prigs in a shop, but precious quick
? Stop thief ! ? vas the cry, and she vas taken ;
I cuts and runs and saves my bacon.
? Then says he, says Sir Richard Birnie,
? I adwise you to nose on your pals (&), and turn the
Snitch (�) on the gang, that?ll be the best vay
To save your scrag (w).? Then, without delay,
He so prewailed on the treach?rous varmint (w).
That she vas noodled by the Bow' Street sarmint (o),
Then the beaks they grabbed me and to prison I vsa
dragged,
And for fourteen years of my life I was lagg?d.
? My mot must now be growing old,
And so am I, if the truth be told ;
But the only vay to get on in the world,
Is to go wdth the stream and however ve?re twirled,.
To bear all rubs : and ven ve suffer
To hope for the smooth ven ve feels the rougher.
Though very hard, I confess, it appears,
To be lagged, for a lark (q), for fourteen years.?
(a) Pocket. (J) Feared. (c) Fond.

THE CONVICTS DREAM.
[The following verses were found in the possession of a
prioner who had just finished serving a long sentence in
pentridge.]
I dreamt a dream so beautiful
As in my cell I laid,
In a dark and a dismal dungeon
In the penttidge stockade.
Methought I saw a damsel
So beautiful and fair,
Whose eyes like diamonds spark'd
Neath her glorious golden hair.
I dreamt of dear old England
And the church where we were wed,
Of my lovely little angel wife
Who-e now some years been dead ;
And again I saw that happy home
The fairest spot on earth,
In England, dear old England,
The land that gave me birth.
I dreamt of little children
Prattling gaily at my knee,
Of that home to me, ?Home, s-veet Home,?
That ne?er again I?ll see.
How I yielded to temptation
And then quickly went astray,
And was captured and transported
Direct to Botany Bay.


ADDENDUM.
I wish to inform my readers that some of the
words in this Dictionary were taken from examples
of prison slang given by Mr. Michael Davitt. He
had ample scope for observation during his political
retirement at Newgate, Mi 11 bank, Dartmoor and
Portsmouth, and his prison diary gives numerous
specimens of the slang which he found was used
hy the thieving fraternity. I have also to acknow-
ledge assistance from many other persons and sources,
and more especially to express my indebtedness to
Detective D. G. d?Donnell and J, O?Sullivan, of
Fitzroy. Yet, with all the sources at my command,
I confess the present work is not as perfect as I
would like it to be. This may be accounted for by
the fact that slang language is ever changing, and,
o o o O O'
accordingly, there must be many words in use which
have escaped my attention. Should any person bring
them under ray notice I will tender him my best
thanks, and assure him of their insertion.

Persons wishing to avoid the buzz attendant to staying
