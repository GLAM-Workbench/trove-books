Reinforcements Referendum
Commonwealth Government’s
Official Proclamation
The recent reverses in Russia and Italy have created a situation so grave as to threaten the very
existence of Australia and the Empire, and have imposed tremendous added responsibilities upon the
English-speaking peoples.
America has marshalled her great resources; the chief burdens of the war rest upon the British
Empire. Every part must do its share; Australia must maintain her five Divisions in Europe and her
forces in Palestine and elsewhere at their full strength. To do this 7,000 men a month are necessary.
Voluntary recruiting, though given every opportunity, has proved itself quite inadequate to raise
this number.
National safety imperatively demands that Australia should do her duty. The Government there-
fore asks the electors to give it power to raise 7,000 men per month in the terms of the following
proposal:—
1. Voluntary enlistment is to continue.
2. The number of reinforcements required is 7,000 per month.
3. Compulsory reinforcement will be called up by ballot to the extent to which voluntary enlistment fails to
supply this number.
4. The ballot will be from among single men only, between the ages of 20 and 44 years (including widowers and
divorcees without children dependent upon them).
5. The following will be exempt:—
(a) Married men.
(b) Persons who are physically unfit for service.
(e) Judges of Federal and State Courts, and Polxce, Special, and Stipendiary Magistrates,
(d) Ministers of religion.
(e) Persons whose employment in any particular industry is declared by the prescribed authority to be
necessary for the supply of food and material essential for the war.
(f) Persons whose religious belief does not allow them to bear arms; but this objection will only exempt them
from combatant service.
(g) Persons, the calling up of whom for military service would, because of their domestic circumstances,
cause undue hardship to those dependent upon them.
6. The Government will prescribe the industries essential to the prosecution of the war and the national welfare
of Australia, and a special tribunal will determine the amount of labour necessary for their effective opera-
tion.
7. Where a family is or has been represented in the Australian Imperial Force by the father or a son, or by a
brother, one eligible son or brother (as the case may be) shall be exempt.
8. Eligible males of families which are now or have been represented at the front shall not be balloted for until
after eligible males of families not so represented have been called up.
9. All ballots shall be so conducted that families will contribute as nearly as practicable pro rata, and that in
no case shall the sole remaining eligible member of a family which is or has been so represented be called up
for service. Males under the age of 20 will be exempt in addition to the one eligible male over that age.
10. In determining the pro rata contribution, regard shall be had to all members of the family who have joined the
Australian Imperial Force, irrespective of age.
11. Ballots will be taken by States, on the basis of the proportional number of eligible persons in each State.
12. The tribunals for deciding exemptions will be constituted by Magistrates specially appointed; and an appeal
will lie to a Supreme Court Judge.
This is the proposal of the Government, upon which the electors are asked to vote on December 20th.
The power asked for is definite and limited; IT APPLIES ONLY TO SINGLE MEN AND
WIDOWERS AND DIVORCEES WITHOUT DEPENDENTS BETWEEN 20 AND 44 YEARS.
The Government gives the electors a definite pledge:-
1. That the power here asked for will be limited to the period of the war.
2. THAT THE LIMITS OF THE POWER WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED.
3. THAT THE TOTAL REINFORCEMENTS, INCLUDING VOLUNTEERS, WILL NOT
EXCEED 7,000 PER MONTH.
4. THAT THE NUMBER OF DIVISIONS WILL NOT BE INCREASED.
5. THAT IF THROUGH ANY CAUSE FEWER MEN THAN 7,000 ARE NEEDED FOR
REINFORCEMENTS IN ANY MONTH, ONLY THE NUMBER ACTUALLY REQUIRED
WILL BE CALLED UP OR ENLISTED.
6. THAT MARRIED MEN WILL BE EXEMPT.
7. THAT OTHER CLASSES OR PERSONS EXEMPTED UNDER THE PROPOSAL WILL
NOT BE CALLED UP.
8. THAT SUFFICIENT LABOR TO CARRY ON THE NECESSARY INDUSTRIES OF THE
COUNTRY, INCLUDING THE RURAL INDUSTRIES, WILL BE EXEMPTED.
// Prime Minister.
