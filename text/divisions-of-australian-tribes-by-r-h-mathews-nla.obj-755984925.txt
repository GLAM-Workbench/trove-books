DIVISIONS OF AUSTRALIAN TRIBES.
BY R. H. MATHEWS. L.S.
{Read April 15, 1898.)
In 1891, my attention was drawn by an article contributed to the
Royal Society of South Australia, 1 by the Rev. L. Schultze, to the
existence of eight classes or divisions among the native tribes in-
habiting the Finke river in South Australia. On making further
inquiries, I found that this eight-class system, with different modi-
fications, extends northerly from the Finke river almost to Port
Darwin and the Gulf of Carpentaria. It also prevails in a westerly
direction, from the boundary of Queensland to that of West Aus-
tralia, and may therefore be said to be in force over the greater
part of the Northern Territory—a name given to the northern por-
tion of South Australia.
Owing to the great apathy regarding native customs shown by the
white population sparsely distributed over this immense tract of
country, I have experienced much difficulty in obtaining particu-
lars respecting these classes. Among my correspondents I was,
however, fortunate enough to find Mr. S. N. Innes, the owner of a
station in the Northern Territory. He had read a paper on the
class systems of other tribes contributed by me in 1894 to the
Geographical Society at Brisbane, 2 which had awakened his interest
in the subject, and when I wrote to him he willingly offered to
collect particulars of the divisions among the natives in his district.
The tribes reported upon by Mr. Innes are divided into eight
classes or sections—the names of the women being slightly different
from those of the men in each section. Four of these sections
form a group, which may be called A, and the other four sections
become group B. This division will be readily understood by
means of a table.
It will be seen by the accompanying table that the women of group
A are the mothers of the men of group B, who marry the women be-
longing to the latter group. The women of group B are likewise the
mothers of the men who marry the women of group A. In other
words, the sons of the women of one group marry the daughters of
the women of the other group. Or, what amounts to the same thing,

On examining the table further it will be observed that the
daughters of the women of group A belong to the same group as
their mothers, but to a different section or class of it. For example,
Ningulum has a daughter Palyareenya; Palyareenya produces
Nooralum; Nooralum produces Bungareenya ; Bungareenya is the
mother of Ningulum, and this series is continually repeated. The
women of the A group pass through each of the four classes in as
many generations—the same class name reappearing in the fifth
epoch. If our example had been taken from the B group, an
analogous result would have been obtained.
When on the Culgoa river some years ago I collected some in-
formation respecting a large tribe speaking the Moorawarrie lan-
guage, who occupy the country from about Goodooga on the
Bokara river to Barringun on the Warrego, extending southerly
about fifty miles and northerly into the Queensland frontier about
the same distance. They are divided into four sections, having the
same names for the men and women as those of the Kamilaroi tribe,
with rules of marriage and descent as exemplified in the following
table:
Husband. Wife. Sons and Daughters.
Ippai, Kubbitha, Murri and Matha,
Kumbo, Matha, Kubbi and Kubbitha,
Kubbi, Ippatha, Kumbo and Butha,
Murri. Butha. Ippai and Ippatha.


ft The whole community is divided into two groups—the members
of the Ippai and Kumbo sections forming the one, and the Kubbi
and Murri people constituting the other. The families composing
these groups bear the names of different animals, plants, or inani-
mate objects, which are called totems, a word copied by us from the
North American Indians. Among the totems of the people consti-
tuting the Ippai and Kumbo sections may be mentioned the follow-
ing:
Wirroo (parrot), Bilbee, Mulga Snake,
Emu, Gray Kangaroo, Red Kangaroo,
Native Dog, Jewfish, Bronze-wing Pigeon,
Codfish, Swan, Plain Turkey,

East of the Moorawarrie is a large tribe speaking the Uollaroi
dialect; they have the same sectional divisions as the former, and
with some variations their totems closely agree. In both tribes
descent is reckoned through the mother. In gathering the particu-
lars respecting the Moorawarrie tribe, now for the first time pub-
lished, I desire to thank Mr. J. E. Miller, of Goodooga, for his will-
ing assistance.
