The Grand Romantic Drama, semi-historical in character, founded upon
leading incidents and events in the marvellous career of the
great Napoleon, and entitled,
A ROYAL DIVORCE,
Written by the late W. G. W ills, Esq.
The Renaissance in Napoleonic Literature and Art has, during the
past few years, become widespread, pervading the Libraries, Periodicals,
Art Galleries, and the Stage. Many plays have been written having for
their central figures Napoleon Buonoparte, First Consul and
Emperor of France, and Joesphine, his Empress ; but the most continu-
ously successful Drama founded upon the fascinating story of their lives
is that given to the Stage by the late W. G. W’ILLS, author of “ Charles
1,,” “ Oliva,” “Jane Shore,” “ Claudian,” “ Mary Stuart,” &c. Without
trying to he absolutely correct as to historical sequence of time or events,
Mr. Wills endeavoured to write a Play which would be an interesting and
exciting compilation of leading incidents as adapted for Dramatic
purposes. •

FRUIT SAUCE.
This unique digestive relish is made from the
tropical PAW-PAW APPLE at Hunter’s Steam
Preserving Works, Cairns, North Queensland,
and is unrivalled as a digestive condiment.
PAPAIN" is the dried juice of the PAW-
PAW APPLE and is the most energetic digestive
ferment known to medical science, hence the
well-known digestive properties of HUNTER’S
PAW-PAW FRUIT SAUCE.
In a recent issue of the British PharmaeeMi-
cal Journal, Professor Finkler, of Bonn, record-
ing experiments of digestive ferments, including
pepsin and trypsin thus sums up :—“From all
these experiments t is only too clear that the
preference should be given to PAPAIN as a
digestive ferment for the treatment of dyspepsia
and indigestion.

THE LADY AND HER ILLS.
A QUEENSLAND STORY.
Mrs. Knibb, of Earle-street, Toowong, Queensland, is one of those who are
prepared to testify to the value of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
“The neighbours know the good they have done me,” she said when inter-
viewed at her residence. Mrs. Knibb is the wife of a well-known and
industrious resident of Toowong. She is well advanced in years, and the cure
in her case should be an encouragement to others who fancy that rheumatism
and other ills of the kind are a penalty of age, to try Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills instead of sitting down to brood in despair. “Pear me,” said Mrs.
Knibb, “ I have been a great sufferer from rheumatism. Twelve years ago I
had a bad accident ; my thigh bone was broken, and since that time I have
suffered a great deal. I lost the sight of my left eve mainly through the
disease, and even after treatment of it was over I suffered from great pain
across the bone over the eye. Last Christmas twelve months I was so bad
that I could scarcely move in bed. I had to go to the hospital after being
treated for a long time by the doctors ; but after coming out again I suffered
ust the same. If I did a little washing in the day time I could hardly turn
in bed at night, and during westerly Avinds I was always laid up. About a
month ago I read of the cures effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, but I was
doubtful about them. One of my family, however, said that the cases reported
must be genuine, or the people would not dare to print them, and so I bought
a box of the pills and took one after each meal. That gave some relief, but I
still suffered, and I was told to take two pills after each meal. I did that,
and the effect has been wonderful. I have got rid of the rheumatism, and the
pain over my eye has gone. During the recent westerly winds I was up and
about and suffered no ill effects.”
“ You attribute that to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ?” the interviewer asked.
“Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Knibb, “I do, and to nothing else. Tf it were
not for them, I should not be standing out here talking to you now.”
Mr. Knibb arrived on the scene at this stage, and confirmed all that his
wife had said, and added that recently he had experienced his first attack of
rheumatism and suffered a great deal, but after a few doses of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills he was able to go to work again.
ff'STapr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are not a patent medicine, but
are a thoroughly scientific preparation, the result of years of careful study on
the part of an eminent Edinburgh University physician, and they were suc-
cessfully used by him in his every day practice for years before being offered for
general sale. They positively cure rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, neuralgia
and influenza’s evil after-effects, and are a specific for all diseases of women'
such as ansemia, poor and watery blood, female irregularities, nervous head-
ache, hysteria. They are not a purgative medicine, but brace up and
nently strengthen the whole system.

Dr. WAUGH'S BABIMG FOWDEE Beats all the Best.
A bat can absorb and digest in one
night three times the weight of its own
body. Bats never have more
little ones at a time.
Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Domestic Incident. —“ Wow ! ” It was
Mr. Newpop. He had taken a mouthful
of water melon. “ Marie, what the d-deuce
is the matter with this melon ? ” “ Doesn’t
it taste good, George?” “No; tastes
like a hot wind. What’s the matter with
it ? ” “ Well, you know, George, the doc-
tor said to —and—and—” “ You boiled
it! Oh ! ” Mr. Newpop settled down in
his chair and cross-eyed at the ceiling for
a few minutes ; then arose and walked un-
steadily into the open air.
Old Bullion—“ What! You wish to

Boy —“In the desert.” Teacher—“ What
do they call those pious men who flee to
the desert ? ” Boy—“ Deserters.”
Willy—“ Why do they call them Birds

cause their feathers make such heavenly
bonnets.

‘ The dear, dear girls,” exclaimed Mrs.
Pawkins, looking at her fashionable
daughters enthusiastically. “ Yes, the
dear, dear girl,” muttered Mr. Pawkins
despondently.
Question of Prerogatives.—Tommy—
“Are my lips myprerogatives?” Mamma—
“ Why, no. Why do you ask ?” Tommy —
“ Cause I saw Mr. Stayelight kissin’
sister, an’ he said he was jo.-’ exercising
his prerogatives.”]
Newsboy (a novice)-—“ Extry special!
Collision of two men-of-war ! Four hun-
dred men killed ! ” Bigger newsboy —
“ What an ass you are ! ' If you go and
tell folks all about it, nobody will want to
buy the paper. Let me show you what

An impecunious Irishman said he liked

flattering and nourishing.
Mirages.
There are few phenomena in nature so
striking as mirages, whether they take
the form of the palm groves seen across
a desert, as, tor instance, in going through
the Suez Canal, or of portents in the sky
like that wonderful storm-blow figuring
in the three crosses of Calvary, which
forms the frontispiece of Mr. Whymper’s
“ Scrambles in the Alps.” A species
mirage commonly seen across lakes in
fine weather is the Fata Morgana , whereby
diminutive cottages are magnified into
gorgeous fairy palaces, rocks become pin-
nacles, and so on. M. Delebecque has
recently been making an examination into
the causes of this phenomenon, and has
communicated his researches to the
Academic des Sciences. He finds that if
the magnified object be scrutinised
through a telescope it resolves itself into
a number of separate superposed images
which cannot be distinguished by the eye.
iucreover, it may happen that only one
portion of the object is magnified at a
time; thus he has seen a boat with double
hull and normal sails suddenly transform
itself into a single hull with gigantic
spread of canvas. As many as five
images raay.be reflected at the same time.
The mirage also occasionally takes the
reverse form, of diminishing objects
looked at. It occurs most frequently
when the temperature of the air is higher
than that of the lake,

PER
BILE BEANS for BILIOUSNESS are one of the safest and surest purgative medicines on the market. They are unlike most
laxative remedies, because they act direct on the bile ducts, causing the liver to secrete and cast increased quantities of
this fluid into the bowels, thus flushing the same out as a stream of water would a drain. Defective bile secretion causes
various ailments, such as HEADACHE, CONSTIPATION, COSTIVENESS, PILES, LIVER TROUBLE, RHEUMATISM,
INDIGESTION, DIZZINESS, BUZZING IN THE HEAD, DULLNESS AFTER EATING, etc., etc. A BILE BEAN
taken now and then will keep one free from these digestive troubles, their attendant evils and dangerous after effects. These
beans are sold at per box, for small size. Is l|d for regular size, because most of the profit that the various middlemen
usually gets goes to the consumer. When you ask for Bile Beans don’t be put off with something else. If you need a purgative
medicine, Bile Beans will prove effectual when all other medicines probably have failed. BILE BEANS are obtainable
from ALL CHEMISTS, or the Australian Branch of THE BILE BEAN MANUFACTURING CO., 19 Macquarie
Place, Sydney.

a lady’s remark while lunching with a friend the
other day. “Yes,” returned the host, “-it is
the PAW PAW SAUCE that gives it that nice
flavor. They say it contains a large percentage
of Papain too, which greatly aids digestion.
We always use it.”
Important Reminder
Physiologists In modern times con-
demn the ordinary bran of wheat
as irritating and likely to inflame
the delicate intestines, and in this
fact lies the great value of
GRANUMA,
because its special manufacture i&
devoted to rendering the bran por-
tion smooth, soluble and digestible,
retaining the natural phosphates
always attached to the outer shell
of wheat. Phosphates supply
vitality, teeth and brain.

Why is the Negro Black ?
The pigmentation of the negro is a
question that has long vexed ethnologists.
One of the most curious theories yet
tc account for it, however, is put
forward by Mr. A. H. Keane in “ Ethno-
logy ” (Cambridge Geographical Series),
that “it seems due to the stimulating
action of solar heat, combined with mois-
ture and an excess of vegetable food, yield-
ing more carbon than can be assimilated,
the character being then fixed by heredity.”
It is the ambition of every young man to

The “ gentleman farmer,” so called, has
to put up with ipany jokes at his expense
in print. In real life he is not often
treated to speeches as amusing as one
which recently came to our ears. Before
leaving his place for a winter visit to gayer
scenes, the “ farmer ” of the anecdote
called his Hibernian head man and said —
“ Flynn, I have to be away for a fortnight.
I hope everything will run smoothly on
the farm.” “ Oh,” said Flynn, heartily,
“ye don’t do a bit o’ harm, sir, when
you’re here ! ”
Pastor (preaching)—“ And five were
foolish and had no oil in their lamps.”

“ I believe 1 saw you coming out of a

Mr. Wilgus. “ I guess you did,” said the
parishioner. “On business, I hope ? ”
“ No. I will be candid with you. I went
in to get a drink. You see it was this
way. I had a counterfeit coin passed on
me.” “ Yes.” “And there are only two
places a man can get rid of a counterfeit
coin—a church and a public-house. And
of course I didn’t want to pass it on th«
contribution box.” The Rev. Mr. W.—

The Sinai Copper Mines
M. Berthelot, in a communication to
the Academic des Sciences, describes the
results of an analysis of some ores from
the famous copper mines of Sinai. These
mines were worked by the early Egyp-
tians, and were a frequent cause of wars
at a time when copper was the only sub-
stitute for wood and stones. M. Ber-
thelot finds the ore to be remarkably poor
and difficult to work, probably the reason
why the mines were abandoned two thou-
sand years ago ; but an interesting point
which has been brought to light is that
the ancients practised precisely the same
method of extraction as we do at the
present day —namely, reduction with
charcoal combined with silicious and cal-
careous fluxes.

The sale of Gilbey’s Dry Gin in New South
Wales five times exceeds that of any other
brand, and it is daily increasing in popularity.
It enjoys the same popular call in the other col-
onies, other competing brands being nowhere.
Gilbey’s Dry Gin is specially recommended by
doctors for kidney and allied maladies. Taken
with a dash of Angostura, or with Soda or Ginger
Beer, it is a most refreshing and wholesome
stimulant.

Electric Lighting in Bolton.
The demand for electricity in Bolton
has grown rapidly since its introduction
by the Corporation ; and the recent
adoption of what is known as the Brighton
scale of charges promises to give such a
stimulus to the public demand that it has
been decided to spend an additional
£30,000 on the extension of the works
and plant. The revised scale places the
electric light within the means of the in-
dustrial classes, and before long it is
expected that many working men’s homes
in the town will be lighted by electricity
in place of gas.
