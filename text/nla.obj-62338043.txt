"The Aussies are Coming?
(Dedicated to the " Boys?? who left Australia sth May, 1940.)
It "was on the fifth of May, on a bright and sunny day.
Another lot of Aussies boarded ship to cross the way.
It was the greatest convoy that this world ever knew,
And our Escort was a beauty, manned by men both brave and true.
We sailed out from Port Melbourne with many a heavy heart,
But every Soldier on the ships was out to do his part.
Not one man got an inkling of whither we were bound
Though everyone was hoping they?d arrive on English ground.
The flagship of our Navy took the lead across the blue
And steered a course of safety that was a credit to her crew,
Accompanied by her Sisters, they were always within
And we were just as safe as kiddies in a kindergarten
We?re not allowed to to you the ships of our convoy
Because it might endanger and all our future plans destroy,
But when the fightings over, their names we?ll surely write
How they kept formation round the Great Australian Bight.
We stopped at old Freeuiantle, the troops were in delight
To set their feet on Aussie soil few yet another night.
They gave us a good welcome and a send-off all combined
A memory we?ll all cherish when we?re in the fighting line.
We left the shores of Aussie, comrades all were we,
For each one had a part to play to set the Empire free.
One day a man went overboard, one of the gallant crew.
His name shall live in memory when this great war is through.
Our next stop was at Capetown, the Table Mountain Port
But it came out in Ship?s orders that leave had been cut short.
Of course our boys took ? French leave?* for which they had=to pay
But each one took his medicine in the good old Digger way.
wï¿½n, we had to leave South Africa, hoping soon to be
In a place they call the ?Old Dart? across the mighty sea,
We all were in good spirits, and everyone there knew
They were the Sons of ??Way down South? and had a job to do.
Just a word here for the Kiwi lads who left New Zealand shore
They were with us in the convoy with numbers in galore,
We swopped them bats and badges when ere we hit a port
They showed by all their actions they were the fighting sort.
Now, we can?t forget our Sisters, the gallant Red Cross Nurse,
They?re ant to do their duty amid the war?s great curse,
They?ll help the sick and wounded, they?ll share your troubles too,
They?ll write home to your old folk,, if that you cannot do.
So let ns take our hats off to those Sisters brave and fine,
And may God in Heaven bless when they?re in the fighting line,
When this bloody war is over find they?ve helped us suffer pain
Their names shall live for ever nspn the scroll of fame.
