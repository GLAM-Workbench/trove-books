A doctor is a useful man.
Who does us all the good he can.
But DR. WAUGH now takes the cake.
With housewives who can cook and bake.
Would you know the reason why
DR. WAUGH is voted best ?
Then just his BAKING POWDER buy,
And put it to the test.
With it a girl can make a cake.
As light as any feather ;
But if she some other take,
’Twill turn out j ust like leather.
So let us all unite 0
In praise of DR. WAUGH,
Whose Baking Powder, of which we write,
Is now a household law.

CAUTION —Mouth-organ Artists and Learners are respectfully
cautioned against unscrupulous Shopkeepers, who try to “talk-in”
the Customer by offering him inferior goods, which are only a weak
imitation of the BOOMERANG, the Monarch of Mouth Organs. If
your man has not a Boomerang Mouth Organ, the one you came
for, walk straight out, don’t accept the spurious substitute with the
shopkeeper’s assertion “just as good,” and get the Boomerang from
another store as the Boomerang Mouth Organs are stocked by every

A 1 —THE ONLY GENUINE TASMANIAN HERBAL REMEDY, “VITADATIO” IS HONESTLY GENUINE.
WORDS OF COMFORT FROM A WIDE-AWAKE MAN. Launceston, Tasmania, 23/2/99.
MR. MORRIS, thh Much-Travelled Agent, gives his opinion of Webber’s “Vitadatio” as under—and at the same time hands us his photograph that there may be no mistake as to the Gentlemen
referred to. He says :—‘‘lt was while we were playing in Melbourne I first heard of “ Vitadatio” through Mr. Palmer, the Agent, who assured me he had been cured of Hydatis and Bright’s disease
of the kidneys of 14 years’ standing by the use of this great remedy. I had been a great sufferer with Kidney and Liver Troubles, which gave me great inconvenience in my calling, and tried very many
medicines to effect a cure, but all were to of avail. I then went in for a course of “Vitadatio”—and with such good results—it having cured me completely —and Tam again in splendid condition; all the
ill effects of my trouble have disappeared ; and moreover, I cannot keep quiet on the subject. I gave “Vitadatio” my strongest recommendation to all who complain of being any way ‘off.’ lam told
that as a blood purifier “Vitadatio" has no known equal, and I quite believe it. Yours gratefully, J. MORRIS, Agent Fitz-Gerald Bros.’ Huge Combined Shows.

To Mr. S. A. Palmer 15th July, 1898.
Dear Sir,—lt is with much pleasure that I add my testimonial to the many others you have
received about your wonderful herbal remedy, “Vitadatio.” For nearly two years I have suf-
fered with an ERUPTION OF THE SKIN, and I have tried all sorts of medicines, without
avail. After much persuasion I resolved to try a course of your “Vitadatio,” and lam thankful
that I ever did so. for the result has been beyond my expectations. My friends cannot fail to
notice the change that has taken place in my skin. Hoping that others may benefit by this.
