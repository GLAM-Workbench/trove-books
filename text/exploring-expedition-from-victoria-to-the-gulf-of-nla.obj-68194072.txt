Brahe.*
Mr. A. W. Howitt?s Despatch.
Poria Creek, Oct. 10, 1861.
Sir, ?I have the honour to report my arrival here with the Con-
tingent Exploring Party, on my return journey, having on Sep-
tember 15, in lat. 27� 44', and long. 140� 40', found John King,
the only survivor of Mr. Burke?s party, living with the Coopers
Creek natives. Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills had died some time
previous to my arrival, from hunger and exhaustion, and Gray
died before reaching Cooper?s Creek, on their return journey from
the Gulf. King was in a very weak, exhausted state when found,
but I am happy to say has recovered wonderfully since, and Mr.
Wheeler has just reported him to me as being out of his hands.
The full particulars will be found in my diary, which, with King?s
narrative, is enclosed. I may state regarding my diary, that I
have only transcribed that portion subsequent to our reaching this
place on our outward journey, as up to that time we had followed
the Expedition track, and nothing of interest had occurred. It
may suffice for me to state that from leaving Menindie we had
travelled without meeting with any particular hindrances, finding
splendid feed almost the whole way, and sufficient water for our
use, with the exception of three nights, when our horses were
without. The rain had been very partial, and in places we only
found sufficient for our immediate use. Torowoto and Carriapundy
swamps and the mud-plains were perfectly dry, and no water that
could long be relied on, without subsequent rain, from Nuntherunga
hack to this place, a distance of about 180 miles. I had intended
leaving the Expedition track at Carriapundy, hut was deterred
from doing so by the very dry appearance of the country; and,
therefore, followed the track to this creek, which is permanent. I
am happy to be able to state that the party are and have been in
* Despatches were received in Melbourne late on Saturday, 2nd November,
from Mr. Howitt, the leader of the Victorian Contingent Exploration Party, con-
taining the disastrous intelligence that, after successfully crossing the Australian
continent, Messrs. Burke and Wills had died of starvation in the neighbourhood
of Cooper?s Creek, and Gray a short time before Cooper?s Creek was reached;
King being the only member of the party who survived, and who was rescued by
the Contingent party.

perfect health, and that the horses are in excellent working order.
The camels are, on the whole, in as good condition as when they
left Menindie, and may be pronounced cured of the scab, which I
cannot help attributing in a great measure to the bad management
of the sepoys. So far I have met with no loss or accident of any
kind, and the natives, wherever I have seen them, have been
friendly. I expect to be down at Menindie in three weeks, and
may probably spend two or three days at Torowoto to endeavour
to find permanent water, as I know of none there that can be
relied on. I forward these despatches by Mr. Brahe and Weston
Phillips, with four of our best horses. I consider that they will
have no particular difficulties in going down, excepting as regards
water, which would not be lessened by a larger party, and 1 cannot
well spare more men, from the number of camels and pack-horses
to look after. Should there be horses at Menindie fit for the
journey down, I have instructed Mr. Brahe to proceed at once to
town, taking with him the documents and field-books belonging to
Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills, and relating to the journey to and from
the Gulf. King I shall send down on my arrival at the Darling.
I beg to urge on the committee the necessity of sending me
immediate instructions to Menindie respecting the further disposal
of the party and equipment.
I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,
A. W. Howitt,
Leader of the Contingent Exploring Party.
To the Hon. John Macadam, m.d.,
Hon. Secretary to the Exploration Committee, Melbourne.
John King?s Narrative.
Mr. Burke, Mr. Wills, and I, reached the depot at Cooper?s
Creek on April 21st, about half-past seven in the evening, with
two camels?all that remained of the six Mr. Burke took with him.
All the provisions we then had, consisted of a pound and a half of
dried meat. We found the party had gone the same day, and
looking about for any mark they might have left, found the tree
with DIG, April 21. Mr. Wills said the party had left for the
Darling. We dug, and found the plant of stores. Mr. Burke
took the papers out of the bottle, and then asked each of us
whether we were able to proceed up the creek in pursuit of the
party ? We said not; and he then said that he thought it his duty
to ask us, but that he himself was unable to do so: but that he
had decided upon trying to make Mount Hopeless, as he had
been assured by the committee in Melbourne that there was a
cattle-station within 150 miles of Cooper?s Creek. Mr. Wills was


not inclined to follow this plan, wishing to go down our old
track, but at last gave in to Mr. Burke?s wishes; I also wished to
go down by our old track. We remained four or five days to
recruit, and make preparations to go down the creek by stages of
four to five miles a day, and Mr. Burke placed a paper in the
plant, stating what were our plans. Travelling down the creek,
we got some fish from the natives, and, some distance down, one
of the camels (Landa) got bogged, and although we remained
there that day and part of the next trying to dig him out, we
found our strength insufficient to do so. The evening of the
second day we shot him as he lay, and having cut off as much
meat as we could, we lived on it while we stayed to dry the
remainder. Throwing all the least necessary things away, we
made one load for the remaining camel (Rajah), and each of us
carried a swag of about 25 lbs. We were then tracing down the
branches of the creek running south, but found that they ran out
into earthy plains. We had understood that the creek along
Gregory?s track was continuous ; and finding that all these creeks
ran out into plains, Mr. Burke returned, our camel being completely
knocked up. We then intended to give the camel a spell for a
few days, and to make a new attempt to push on forty or fifty
miles to the south, in the hope of striking the creek. During the
time that the camel was being rested, Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills
went in search of the natives, to endeavour to find out how the
nardoo grew. Having found their camp, they obtained as much
nardoo-cake and fish as they could eat, but could not explain that
they wished to be shown how to find the seed themselves. They
returned on the third day, bringing some fish and nardoo-cake
with them. On the following day the camel Rajah seemed very
ill: I told Mr. Burke I thought he could not linger out more
than four days; and as on the same evening the poor brute was
on the point of dying, Mr, Burke ordered him to be shot. I did
so, and we cut him up with two broken knives and a lancet. We
cured the meat and planted it; and Mr. Burke then made another
attempt to find the nardoo, taking me with him. We went down
the creek, expecting to find the natives at the camp where they
had been last seen, but found that they had left; and, not knowing
whether they had gone up or down the creek, we slept in their
gunyahs that night, and on the following morning returned to Mr.
Wills. The next day Mr. Burke and I started up the creek, but
could see nothing of them, and were three days away when we
returned, and remained three days in our camp with Mr. Wills.
We then made a plant of all the articles we could not carry with
us, leaving 5 lbs. of rice and a quantity of meat, and then followed
up the creek, where there were some good native huts. We
remained at that place a few days, and, finding our provisions were


beginning to run short, Mr. Burke said that we ought to do
something, that if we did not find the nardoo we should starve,
and that he intended to save a little dried meat and rice to carry
us to Mount Hopeless. The three of us then came to the conclusion
that it would be better to make a second attempt to reach Mount
Hopeless, as we were then as strong as we were likely to be, our
daily allowance being then reduced. Mr. Burke asked each of us
whether we were willing to make another attempt to reach the
South Australian settlements, and we decided on going. We
took with us what remained of the provisions we had planted?two-
and-a-half pounds of oatmeal, a small quantity of flour, and the
dried meat; this, with powder and shot, and other small articles,
made up our swags to 30 lbs. each, and Mr. Burke carried one billy
of water, and I another. We had not gone far before we came
on a flat, where I saw a plant growing which I took to be clover,
and, on looking closer, saw the seed, and called out that I had
found the nardoo. They were very glad when I found it. We
travelled three days, and struck a watercourse coming south from
Cooper?s Creek. We traced this, as it branched out and re-formed
on the plains, until we at last lost it in flat country. Sandhills
were in front of us, for which we made, and travelled all day, but
found no water. We were all greatly fatigued, as our rations
now consisted of only one small johnny cake and three sticks of
dried meat daily. We camped that evening about four o?clock,
intending to push next day until two o?clock, p.m., and then should
we not find water, to return. We travelled, and found no water,
and the three of us sat down and rested for an hour, and then
turned back. We all felt satisfied that, had there been a few
days? rain, we could have got through. We were then, according
to Mr. Wills?s calculation, forty-five miles from the creek. We
travelled on the day we turned back very late, and the following
evening reached the nearest water at the creek. We gathered
some nardoo, and boiled the seeds, as we were unable to pound
them. The following day we reached the main creek; and
knowing where there was a fine water-hole and native gunyahs, we
went there, intending to save what remained of our flour and dried
meat, for the purpose of making another attempt to reach Mount
Hopeless. On the following day Mr. Wills and I went out to
gather nardoo, of which we obtained a supply sufficient for three
days; and finding a pounding-stone at the gunyahs, Mr. Wills
and I pounded the seed, which was such slow work that we were
compelled to use half flour and half nardoo. Mr. Burke and Mr.
Wills then went down the creek for the remainder of the dried
meat which we had planted, and we had now all our things with
us, gathering nardoo, and living the best way we could. Mr.
Burke requested Mr. Wills to go up the creek as far as the depot,
VOL. XXXII. 2 F


and to place a note in the plant there, stating that we were then
living on the creek, the former note having stated that we were on
our road to South Australia. He was also to bury there the .field-
books of the journey to the Gulf. Before starting he got 3 lbs. of
flour and 3 lbs. of pounded nardoo, and about a pound of meat, as
he expected to be absent about eight days. During his absence I
gathered nardoo and pounded it, as Mr. Burke wished to lay in a
supply in case of rain.
A few days after Mr. Wills left, some natives came down to the
creek to fish at some water-holes near our camp. They were civil
to us at first, and offered us some fish; on the second day they
came again to fish, and Mr. Burke took down two bags, which
they filled for him; on the third they gave us one bag of fish, and
afterwards all came to our camp. We used to keep our ammuni-
tion and other articles in one gunyah, and all three of us lived
together in another. One of the natives took an oilcloth out of
this gunyah, and Mr. Burke, seeing him run away with it, followed
him with his revolver and fired over his head, and upon this the
native dropped the oilcloth. While he was away, the other blacks
invited me to a water-hole to eat fish ; but I declined to do so,
as Mr. Burke was away, and a number of natives were about
who would have taken all our things. When I refused, one took
his boomerang and laid it over my shoulder, and then told me by
signs that if I called out for Mr. Burke, as I was doing, that he
would strike me. Upon this I got them all in front of the gunyah
and fired a revolver over their heads, but they did not seem at all
afraid, until I got out the gun, when they all ran away. Mr.
Burke, hearing the report, came back, and we saw no more of
them until late that night, when they came with some cooked fish
and called out ? white fellow.? Mr. Burke then went out with
his revolver, and found a whole tribe coming down, all painted,
and with fish in small nets carried by two men. Mr. Burke went
to meet them, and they wished to surround him; but he knocked
as many of the nets of fish out of their hands as he could* and
shouted out to me to fire. I did so, and they ran off. We collected
five small nets of cooked fish. The reason he would not accept
the fish from them was that he was afraid of being too friendly,
lest they should be always at our camp. We then lived on fish
until Mr. Wills returned. He told us that he had met the natives
soon after leaving us, and that they were very kind to him and
had given him plenty to eat both on going up and returning. He
seemed to consider that he should have very little difficulty in
living with them; and, as our camp was close to theirs, he returned
to them the same day and found them very hospitable and friendly,
keeping him with them two days. They then made signs to him
to be off. He came to us and narrated what had happened, but


went back to them the following day, when they gave him his
breakfast, but made signs to him to go away. He pretended not
to understand them, and would not go, upon which they made
signs that they were going up the creek, and that he had better
go down. They packed up and left the camp, giving Mr. Wills a
little nardoo to take to us.
During his absence, while Mr. Burke was cooking some fish,
during a strong wind, the flames caught the gunyah, and burned
so rapidly* that we were unable, not only to put it out, but to save
any of our things, excepting one revolver and a gun. Mr. Wills
being returned, it was decided to go up the creek and live with
the natives, if possible, as Mr. Wills thought we should have but
little difficulty in obtaining provisions from them if we camped on
the opposite side of the creek to them. He said he knew where
they were gone, so we packed up and started. Coming to the
gunyahs where we expected to have found them, we were dis-
appointed ; and seeing a nardoo field close by, halted, intending to
make it our camp. For some time we were employed gathering
nardoo, and laying up a supply. Mr. Wills and I used to collect
and carry home a bag each day, and Mr. Burke generally pounded
sufficient for our dinner during our absence ; but Mr. Wills found
himself getting very weak, and was shortly unable to go out and
gather nardoo as before, nor even strong enough to pound it, so
that in a few days he became almost helpless. I still continued
gathering ; and Mr. Burke now also began to feel very weak, and
said he could be of very little use in pounding. I had now to
gather and pound for all three of us. I continued to do this for a
few days; but finding my strength rapidly failing, my legs being
very weak and painful, 1 was unable to go out for several days,
and we were compelled to consume six days? stock, which we had
laid by. Mr. Burke now proposed that I should gather as much
as possible in three days, and that with this supply we should go
in search of the natives?a plan which had been urged upon us by
Mr. Wills as the only chance of saving him and ourselves as well,
as he clearly saw that I was no longer able to collect sufficient for
our wants. Having collected the seed, as proposed, and having
pounded sufficient to last Mr. Wills for eight days, and two days
for ourselves, we placed water and firewood within his reach, and
started. Before leaving him, however, Mr. Burke asked him
whether he still wished it, as under no other circumstances would
he leave him ; and Mr. Wills again said that he looked on it as
our only chance. He then gave Mr. Burke a letter and his watch
for his father, and we buried the remainder of his field-books near
the gunyah. Mr. Wills said that, in case of my surviving Mr.
Burke, he hoped that I would carry out his last wishes in giving
the watch and letter to his father.


In travelling the first day Mr. Burke seemed very weak, and
complained of great pain in his legs and back. On the second
day he seemed to be better, and said that he thought he was
getting stronger, but, on starting, did not go two miles before he
said he could go no farther. I persisted in his trying to go on,
and managed to get him along several times, until I saw that he
was almost knocked up ; when he said he could not carry his swag,
and threw all he had away. I also reduced mine, taking nothing
but a gun and some powder and shot, and a small pouclTand some
matches. On starting again, we did not go far before Mr. Burke
said he should halt for the night; but as the place was close to a
large sheet of water, and exposed to the wind, I prevailed on him
to go a little farther, to the next reach of water, where we camped.
We searched about, and found a few small patches of nardoo,
which I collected and pounded, and, with a crow which I shot,
made a good evening?s meal. From the time we halted Mr.
Burke seemed to be getting worse, although he ate his supper.
He said he felt convinced he could not last many hours, and gave
me his watch, which he said belonged to the committee, and a
pocket-book to give to Sir William Stawell, and in which he
wrote some notes. He then said to me, ? I hope you will remain
with me here till I am quite dead?it is a comfort to know that
some one is by; but, when lam dying, it is my wish that you
should place the pistol in my right hand, and that you leave me
unburied as I lie.? That night he spoke very little, and the
following morning I found him speechless, or nearly so; and
about eight o?clock he expired, I remained a few hours there ;
but as I saw there was no use in remaining longer, I went up the
creek in search of the natives. I felt very lonely, and at night
usually slept in deserted wurleys, belonging to the natives. Two
days after leaving the spot where Mr. Burke died, I found some
gunyahs, where the natives had deposited a bag of nardoo, suffi-
cient to last me a fortnight, and three bundles containing various
articles. I also shot a crow that evening, but was in very great
dread that the natives would come and deprive me of the nardoo.
I remained there two days to recover my strength, and then
returned to Mr. Wills. I took back three crows; but found him
lying dead in his gunyah, and the natives had been there and had
taken away some of his clothes. I buried the corpse with sand,
and remained there some days. But finding that my stock of
nardoo was running short, and being unable to gather it, I tracked
the natives who had been to the camp, by their footprints in the
sand; and, when some distance down the creek, shooting crows
and hawks on the road, the natives, hearing the report of the gun,
came to meet me, and took me with them to their camp, giving
me nardoo and fish. They took the birds I had shot and cooked


them for me, and afterwards showed me a gunyah, where I was to
sleep with three of the single men. The following morning they
commenced talking to me, and putting one finger on the ground,
and covering it with sand, at the same time pointing up the creek,
saying ? White fellow,? which I understood to mean that one white
man was dead. From this, I thought they were the tribe who had
taken Mr. Wills?s clothes. They then asked me where the third
man was, and I also made the sign of putting the fingers on the
ground, and covering them with sand, at the same time pointing
up the creek. They appeared to feel great compassion for me
when they understood that I was alone on the creek, and gave me
plenty to eat. After being four days with them, I saw that they
were becoming tired of me, and they made signs that they were
going up the creek, and that I had better go downwards; but I
pretended not to understand them. The same day they shifted
camp, and I followed them ; and, on reaching their camp, I shot
some crows, which pleased them so much that they made me a
breakwind in the centre of their camp, and came and sat round
me until such time as the crows were cooked, when they assisted
me to eat them. The same day, one of the women, to whom I
had given part of a crow, came and gave me a ball of nardoo,
saying that she would give me more only she had such a sore arm
that she was unable to pound. She showed me a sore on her arm,
and the thought struck me that I would boil some water in the
billy and wash her arm with a sponge. During the operation the
whole tribe sat round, and were muttering one to another. Her
husband sat down by her side, and she was crying all the time.
After I had washed it, I touched it with some nitrate of silver,
when she began to yell and ran off, crying ? Mokow! mokow! ?
(Fire! fire !) From this time she and her husband used to give
me a small quantity of nardoo- both night and morning, and when-
ever the tribe was about going on a .fishing excursion, he used to
give me notice to go with them. They also used to assist me in
making a wurley, or breakwind, whenever they shifted camp. I
generally shot a crow, or a hawk, and gave it to them in return
for these little services. Every four or five days the tribe would
surround me and ask whether I intended going up or down the
creek; at last I made them understand that if they went up I
should go up the creek, and if they went down I should also go
down, and from this time they seemed to look upon me as one of
themselves, and supplied me with fish and nardoo regularly.
They were very anxious, however, to know where Mr. Burke lay,
and one day when we were fishing in the water-holes close by, I
took them to the spot. On seeing his remains the whole party
wept bitterly, and covered them with bushes. After this they
were much kinder to me than before, and I always told them


that the white men would be here before two moons, and in the
evenings, when they came with nardoo and fish, they used to talk
about the ? white fellows ? coming, at the same time pointing to
the moon. I also told them they would receive many presents,
and they constantly asked me for tomahawks, called by them
?bomay ho.? From this time to when the relief party arrived?
a period of about a month?they treated me with uniform kind-
ness, and looked upon me as one of themselves. The day on
which I was released, one of the tribe who had been fishing came
and told me that the white fellows were coming; and the whole of
the tribe, who were then in camp, sallied out in every direction to
meet the party, while the man who had brought the news took me
over the creek, where I shortly saw the party coming down.
Brahe?s Letter.
The following is the letter deposited by Mr. Brahd in the cache
at Cooper?s Creek on the 21st of April, when he left that for
Menindie:?
Depot, Cooper?s Creek, April 21st, 1861.
The depot party of V. E. E. leaves this camp to-day, to return to
the Darling. I intend to go south-east from Camp 60, to get into
our k old track near Bui 100. Two of my companions and myself
are quite well; the third?Patton?has been unable to walk for
the last eighteen days, as his leg has been severely hurt when
thrown by one of the horses. No person has been up here from
the Darling.
We have six camels and twelve horses in good working con-
dition.

Burke?s Last Letter.
The following is the despatch of Mr. Burke, left at the Depot
at Cooper?s Creek:?
Depdt No. 2, Cooper?s Creek. Camp No. 65.
22nd April, 1861.
The return party from Carpentaria, consisting of myself, Mr.
Wills, and King (Gray dead), arrived here last night, and found
that the depot party had only started on the same day. We
proceed to-morrow slowly down the creek towards Adelaide, by
Mount Hopeless, and shall endeavour to follow Gregory?s track,
but we are very weak. The two camels are done up, and we shall
not be able to travel farther than four or five miles a day. Gray
died on the road from exhaustion and fatigue. We have all
suffered much from hunger. The provisions left here will, I think,
restore our strength. We have discovered a practicable route to


Carpentaria, the chief portion of which lies on the 140 th meridian
of east longitude. There is some good country between this and
the stony desert. From there to the tropic the country is dry and
stony. Between the tropic and Carpentaria a considerable portion
is rangy, but it is well watered and richly grassed.
We reached the shores of Carpentaria on the 11th February,
1861. Greatly disappointed at finding the party here gone.
E. O?Hara Burke, Leader.
P.S. The camels cannot travel, and we cannot walk, or we
should follow the other party. We shall move very slowly down
the creek.
Wills?s Last Letter.
The following is Mr. Wills?s letter, which he buried in the cache
at Cooper?s Creek, after finding it impossible to get through to
South Australia :
Dep6t Camp, 30th May.
We have been unable to leave the creek. Both camels are
dead, and our provisions are done. Mr, Burke and King are
down the lower part of the creek. lam about to return to them,
when we shall probably come up this way. We are trying to live
the best way we can, like the blacks, but find it hard work. Our
clothes are going to pieces fast. Send provisions and clothes as
soon as possible. w j WILLS
The depot party having left, contrary to instructions, has put us
in this fix. I have deposited some of my journals here, for fear of
accidents. /o* i\ ttt twt

Howitt?s Diary.
September 1. Camp 20, Poria Creek; lat. 28� 44', long. 142� 42'.
?The country, after leaving Camp 19 (Koorlegur), was generally
sandy ridges, running variously from north-east round to north-
west. Between these sandy tracts we passed a good deal of
clayey flat ground?in places hard and smooth, in others spongy
and rotten, and cracked deeply by the heat; polygonum and cane-
grass growing in great quantities. The feed everywhere poor and
scanty, and very dry. I believe that very little rain has fallen
here this season. After about ten miles, the sand-ridges became
more marked, and of a red colour, and the flats wide, and draining
to the north-east. Scattered box-trees began to appear, and birds
were more numerous. At five miles more, struck Poria Creek, a


deep channel coming from a northerly direction, and containing
abundance of water: its general width appears to be about 00 feet,
and the banks are lined with small box-trees ; water-plants and a
species of water-moss grow in the bed, and, from fish and crayfish
being found in it, I have no doubt that it is permanent ?in fact,
the only water I can consider such of all these we have seen on
this side the Daubeny Ranges. At a distance of about half a mile,
the course of the creek is followed by high red sand-ridges, running
parallel to its course. There is no timber anywhere but on the
creek, and only small bushes and one or two kinds of pittosporum
and mulgar on the sand-ridges. The country is very inferior in
every respect, but water as we proceed. Signal-fires in two places
as we were travelling; both very large, and no doubt intended to
announce our arrival. On some of the flats I observed quantities
of the plant growing from the seeds of which the natives make
their bread. It appears to choose a loose blistered clayey soil,
subject to be flooded, such as is generally found in polygonum
ground. The leaves resemble clover, but with a silvery down,
which is also found on the seed when fresh; these grow on short
stems springing from the roots, and are flat and rather oval: in
places where the plant has died down, these seeds quite cover the
ground ; they are gathered by the native women, and, after being
cleaned from the sand, are pounded between two stones and baked
as cakes.
Sept. 2. Camp 20.?Spelled here to-day before starting across
for Cooper?s Creek. Mending pack-bags, dressing camels, baking
four days? bread, &c. Day warm; wind from south-east, which
seems to be the prevalent quarter. Flies begin to be troublesome.
Sept. 3. Camp 21, lat. 28� 22', long. 142� 31'.?Started at
eight o?clock, and left the expedition track at Poria Creek. Struck
a course for Cooper?s Creek north-west by compass. For seven
miles travelled over sand-ridges running north-east and south-west,
with wide clayey valleys between, in which were occasional small
pools of muddy water. The feed everywhere very dry, but
tolerably plentiful on the sandhills. Bushes and small mulgar-
trees were growing in places. We here crossed a dry box-swamp,
where crows, wood-swallows, kites, and small birds were numerous ;
and I observed here several trees with a rough bark resembling
cork, and with bunches of long, pointed, dark green leaves growing
at the ends of the small branches. The sandhills here became low
and flat, and the valley wider. Shortly afterwards crossed the
track of a large camel going north-east, apparently about eight
months ago. The country undulating and well grassed, and, as
far as I could make out, the watershed both to the north-east and
south-west. At twelve o?clock, after crossing a dry swamp full of
watercourses, and passing a low sandhill, came on a creek running


south-west, thickly timbered with large box-trees, the bed wide
and the banks steep, and in several places large pools of clear
water. Marshmallows and other vegetation now perfectly dried
up were on the banks. Native camps were numerous; but none
that I saw were very recent. Mussel-shells and the claws of
crayfish were lying near them. I have every reason to believe
that some of these pools are permanent. Crossing this we passed
several branch creeks running through a clayey plain, and all
lined with trees; large pools of water in several. I named this
creek after the Hon. David Wilkie, m.d., m.l.c. On leaving
the clay-flats at the creek we again crossed sandhills and undu-
lating country for several miles, mostly well grassed but much
burned up. Saltbush and cottonbush plentiful in the hollows, and
scattered timber beginning to appear. At half-past two came on
a watercourse running north, and containing large but shallow
pools of water. The feed round about excellent, and enough
timber to be called a thin gum-forest. The gums here a new
species not before seen by us, several feet of the butt having a
rough semipersistent bark, above which it is smooth and greenish,
with a red tint; leaves thick and glossy, very much resembling
one growing near Oraeo. Ducks here very tame. Camped,
having made eighteen miles, and country not looking so well
ahead. The general fall seems to be to the westward. Samla,
the largest of our camels, lay down just before reaching the camp ;
he is the only one of the lot that has not improved in condition,
and he keeps himself poor by constantly watching the other camels,
and driving them away from the females. He only carries 2 cwt.
Sept. 4. Camp 22, Stokes?Ranges; lat. 28� 20', long. 142� 19'.
?Left camp at half-past seven. Travelled for three miles through
open gum-forest, growing on clayey land. Water-channels fre-
quent, with occasional small .pools of water. Saltbush and grass,
but very dry. Then crossed an open plain with claypans, the
drainage of which, running westward, forms numerous small box-
creeks, which form and spread out again on the plain. No water
here, only liquid mud. At about five miles passed a small box-
creek with pools of water, and came on an open sandy plain
destitute of vegetation, excepting the remains of salsolaceous
plants grown last season. At ten o?clock crossed a large dry gum-
creek, full of gravel and boulders, coming in an easterly direction
from the range. As it lay in our course, we followed it up for
some distance, but found no water, although crows, rose cockatoos,
and crested pigeons were on it. The country here became stony,
but with more dry grass, and gradually rose to the range; from
this point the travelling was very severe upon the horses, and
consequently very slow, as the ground is everywhere covered with,
fragments of sharp flint-stones. The ranges are of no great


height, and slope gently upwards; hut are cut by numerous deep
gorges, filled with blocks of stone and scrub, and mostly containing
a dry gum-creek. These lying across our track made it difficult
to get on. The mulgar-scrub was very thick in places, a great
deal of it dead, and numbers of shrubs new to me. Camped at
3*30 at the edge of a deep scrubby gorge, with plenty of dry grass,
but no water. Went down the gorge after camping to look for
water, but found none: nor could I see any chance, from the loose
gravelly bed and large boulders. Scrub very thick ; among other,
the native orange, of large size, and covered with unripe fruit.
Distance, twenty miles.
Sept. 5. Camp 23, north side of Stokes? Ranges; lat. 28� 10',
long. 142� 8'. ?Had some difficulty in crossing the gully this
morning, the sides being steep and covered with large blocks ot
stone ; thick mulgar-scrub up both sides. From here, travelled
over similar stony ridges to those described yesterday for several
hours, crossing two wide deep gorges, each with a dry creek and
large gums, and flanked by precipitous stony ranges. On reach-
ing the summit of the range, found it to be a stony tableland,
almost devoid of vegetation. Some remarkable flat-topped peaks
to the north about 12 miles. At noon, suddenly came to the
edge of a bluff overlooking the Cooper?s Creek country ?appa-
rently a boundless extent of plains, with dark lines of scrub or
timber on the horizon. To descend from this bluff to a wide
basin of open country below, probably 700 to 800 feet, occupied
an hour, and I could only consider it a happy chance that some of
the packhorses or camels met with no accident among the large
blocks of loose stone. I could not have believed that the camels
could have carried their loads up or down such places as we have
crossed to-day. On reaching the basin, found it stony to a degree
difficult to describe. The ground was literally paved with angular
and rounded fragments of sandstone and flint, coated with a
shining oxide of iron. Vegetation very scanty, and water nowhere
visible, although I saw birds which I have seldom seen far from
springs. Travelling for several miles over this country, sur-
rounded by a chain of abrupt square hills, we slowly picked our
road as best we could. Several of the horses were very footsore,
and most of them fagged with the severe day?s work and want of
water. The day, too, was unusually warm. At 3*30 found it
necessary to camp, the camels and horses being very tired. No
water, scarcely any feed.
After camp went to a square steep hill, with Mr. Brahe, to
reconnoitre the country. From it had an extensive view towards
Cooper?s Creek, and was pleased to see that the stony country
does not probably extend more than 4 miles from us. Beyond
that open plains, and on the horizon what seem to be sandhills


and timber. A large body of smoke to the west. I found the
summit of the hill to be covered with large masses of a white
crystalline stone, grouped in irregular columns, and ringing with a
metallic sound when struck. It is the same stone as that uni-
versally strewn over the country, and of which and a coarse sand-
stone and conglomerate the ranges are mostly formed. Managed
to give the horses two quarts of water each, in the hope that they
would feed. They were so thirsty that two tried to take the
quart-pots off the fire.
Sept. 6. Camp 24; lat. 28�, long. 142� 2'. ?Left camp shortly
after six. The horses had not fed during the night, partly from
thirst, partly being afraid of the stones. Followed down a gully
leading into very stony plains, which we crossed for several hours,
being obliged to lead the horses very slowly. No timber and
scarcely any vegetation ; the most desolate, stony wilderness
imaginable. About ten o?clock came near the sandhills, and the
country improved as regarded travelling, but not for feed or water.
On a dry watercourse came on a party of natives, of whom some
ran away; the others, consisting of an old grey-haired man, an
old hag of a woman, a younger man, and two or three lubras and
children, waited until I rode up. They were in a very excited
state, waving branches, and jabbering incessantly. The younger
man shook all over with fright. Sandy could not understand
them, and I could only catch ? Gow ? (Go on). At last, by the
offer of a knife, I prevailed on the old man to come with us to
show us the nearest water; but after half a mile his courage gave
way, and he climbed up a box-tree to be out of reach. Mr.
Brahe rode up to him, when he climbed into the top branches,
jabbering without stopping for a moment. Finding that he would
not come down, and kept pointing to the north-west (our course),
we left him. All the natives were naked, and the old man was
the only one who had any covering for his head?a net.
We here entered undulating sandy country, slightly scrubbed
and well grassed, and at the same time came on Brahe?s down-
track. Our horses at once struck into a better pace, going at
least miles an hour. The camels also pushed on well. The
loose horses kept wide of the track, looking out for water in the
polygonum-ground, and at ten minutes past twelve one old stager
found an ample supply in a channel on the right hand. The
horses at once made a rush, and it was almost impossible to pre-
vent them drinking as much as they wished. Three had for the
last hour shown unmistakeable signs of giving in, and all were
very much pinched with thirst. Camped by the water, in first-
rate feed. Rain came on steadily from the north-east shortly after,
and has continued. The horses have just been a third time to
water. ,


Sept. 7. Camp 24.?1t rained very heavily during the night,
with strong gusts of wind from north-east, and this morning the
flats and claypans are swimming with water, and the ground very
soft. Resting to-day, as the horses require it. Drying things,
shoeing horses, and digging tank to try and hold water later in
the season.
Sept. 8, Camp 25, Cooper?s Creek ; lat. 27� 51', long. 141�
55'.?(Half-a-mile above Camp 60 of Victorian Expedition.)?
Travelled north 60� w., through a succession of sandhills, with flats
of rotten polygonum-ground between. The vegetation very green
and in full flower, and box-trees growing in most of the flats.
Towards noon, after crossing some high red sandhills, came into
the earthy plains through which the various channels of Cooper?s
Creek run to the westward. The ground very rotten, and cracked
by numerous deep fissures; dry channels in every direction. About
6 miles brought us to a patch of sandhills, where the bare loose
summits were crested with a pink flowering mesembryanthemum ;
the pink flower, with the orange-coloured sand, and the light-
green vegetation, produced a very singular effect. We here sud-
denly came upon a native camp of four wurleys. Only one
black fellow was at home, and the three leading men of our pro-
cession came suddenly upon him as he was lying on the ground
playing with his dog. He gave a succession of yells, and then
ran off as if electrified. Here we crossed the first branch of
Cooper?s Creek, a wide shallow bed, full of green weeds and
grass, and lined with box. From this we crossed about 3 miles
of loose earthy plains devoid of vegetation, and camped on the
north side of a large branch, near a shallow sheet of water. No
feed on the plains, but grass and green weeds in the channel.
Large box-trees on the bank. Distance travelled, 24 miles.
Sept. 9. Camp 26; lat. 27� 49', long. 141� 38'. ?While loading
up this morning five black fellows made their appearance on the
opposite side of the creek, and, as usual, commenced shouting and
waving their arms. We cooed in return, and one waded across,
but waited on the bank until I broke a branch and beckoned him
to come up. The others then followed him; they were all fine,
well-built young men, with open, intelligent faces, and very dif-
ferent from the natives usually met with. They wore nets wrapped
round their waists, and one, apparently the head man, had his
front teeth knocked out. Sandy said he could only understand
? narrangy word ? they said; but I believe that he could not
understand them at all, as he was quite unable to make them
comprehend that I wished to know if they had seen any stray
camels about the creek. Before we had finished loading, they
returned to the opposite bank, and sat down watching us. On
our starting they waded across to our camp ?probably to pick up


anything left behind, which would be very little. To-day we
travelled over earthy plains for 13 miles; they were cracked in
every direction, and covered with a network of channels. In
times of flood the whole of them must be under water, and I can
scarcely imagine anything more luxuriant than the appearance of
these plains after a wet season. At present everything is dry and
withered, but everywhere the stalks of marsh-mallows and other
flowering plants are as high as a horse's back, and very close
together. Tufts of grass line each side, and cover the beds of the
watercourses. Here and there clumps and lines of timber mark
the course of the larger creeks, and sandhills rise like islands
from the plains. To the south of west, at about 9 miles, we had a
range, probably stony, and following its base a strongly marked
line of timber, which I believe to be the main creek. No floods
appear to have come down for two seasons, and water-holes which
were tolerably well filled five months ago are now dry, or nearly
so. At 13 miles crossed a branch, where Burke?s marked tree,
LXI, stands, and camped at a claypan under a sandhill, about a
mile to the west. Strong breeze from the north-east and north
all day, and steady rain at night. Near here I observed, for the
first time, a new tree, with a rough scaly bark and thick foliage,
the leaves small and oval, and set in pairs on a stem. The tree
grows to 15 or 20 feet, and bears numbers of flat brown pods,
each containing from five to six hard light-brown beans, known by
us as the bean-tree.
Sept. 10. Camp 27 : lat. 27 :> 39', long. 141� 30'. ?The rain
ceased shortly before sunrise, and the travelling was in consequence
very heavy, the earthy plains being not only soft, as before, but
sticky. Shortly after leaving camp, saw several natives on a sand-
hill making signs. I went up to them with Mr. Welch, and after
a great deal of trouble persuaded one to come to me. He was
a fine-looking fellow, painted white, skeleton fashion, and carried
a very long boomerang stuck in his girdle behind. I could make
nothing of him, excepting that he gave me a small ball of what
seemed to be chewed grass, as a token of friendship, and in return
I gave him a piece of cold doughboy I had with me for lunch,
which he seemed to relish very much. We travelled till noon
over a succession of earthy plains, broken by numerous box-
channels, one of which contained a large reach of water, but the
feed everywhere was miserably dry and scarce. The country
looks wretched. After passing this channel seven natives made
their appearance, one of whom Mr. Brahd recognised as one of
the party who tried to surprise the depot last season. They pre-
sented him with a small quantity of some dried plant, from a
bundle which one of them carried ; it had a strong, pungent taste
and smell, and I am at a loss to conjecture its use, unless as a


kind of tobacco. Our black boy was frightened, and told me be
thought they meant to ? look out, kill him ? ?as I understood?
by witchcraft, or enchantment, or poison. They followed us at a
distance to our camp, where they sat down a little way off,
making signs that they were hungry, and wanted tomahawks.
After an hour?s waiting they decamped. Killed two deaf adders
and a snake of a sulphur colour on the track. Halted near a
small pool of water, where there was a little green feed, which has
become a rarity; the country looks miserable ahead. Travelling
very heavy on the horses, as the mud balls in great lumps.
Stony ridges to the south of the creek, at about 4 miles, and a
good deal of timber visible on all sides. Weather still threatening
rain ; flies very troublesome.
Sept. 11. Camp 28 ; lat. 27� 35', long. 141� 19'.?Our horses
strayed for feed during the night, and made it late before we
started. Travelled through a box-forest full of channels, when
we came to a dry creek coming from the north-east, with a rocky
bed. From here, for some distance, stony ground to the right
hand, and deep channels running parallel to each other in a
westerly direction. I observed flood-marks considerably higher
than our heads on horseback, and the water must be much con-
fined by the stony rises on each side of the creek, although they
are probably 2 miles apart. Mint was growing on the edges of
the channels, and tea-tree of large size. We then came on a
long reach of water about 60 yards wide ; the country miserable ;
not a vestige of feed to be seen anywhere, except the withered
and blackened remains of plants on the plains, and occasional
patches of green couch-grass in the creek-bed. After this we
traversed a box-forest, and came on a deep channel from the
north-east, where Mr. Burke?s first depot was situated. The feed
was slightly better, owing to the sandy nature of the ground.
About noon, passed large reaches of brackish water, and numerous
pools of brine in the channels of the creek, but saw no feed any-
where. At length found one place where patches of couch-grass,
with green plants and tufts of coarse grass, were growing among
the stones, and halted, as the clay-plains before us were perfectly
bare. It is long since I have seen such a barren, miserable place
as this part of Cooper?s Creek. Native camps were numerous,
but all deserted. During the day flights of cockatoo-parrots
passed us, migrating to the eastward. Where we are camped the
creek is wide, with a stony bed; the south bank is formed of
limestone, and large quantities of opalised wood are lying about.
A short distance above the rocky banks come close down to the
creek.
Sept. 12. Camp 29 ; lat. 27� 35', long. 141� 6'.?Travelled
over clayey plains, with scattered timber and a good deal of


withered herbage. A rugged range, apparently sandstone, with
flat-topped hills and peaks to the north, running north-east and
south-west, at about 9 miles? distance. At 4 miles passed a wide
deep reach of water, several miles in length, between steep banks,
and probably brackish, from its colour. Numbers of pelicans,
spoonbills, cormorants, and other waterfowl on it. On each side
bare cracked plains, extending to the stony rises. At 3 miles
more, the stony country on our right-hand closed in numerous
deep channels, forming the creek, some of which were rocky, some
sandy. Here, as elsewhere, were green grass and plants growing
on the sand. Rather thickly timbered. At noon, came to where
the creek forces a passage between rocky ridges; the channels are
deep and tortuous, and in places encumbered with large blocks of
stone. I here saw red gums for the first time on the creek. This
continued for 4 miles, with narrow ridges of hard clay, covered
with dense polygonum, separating the watercourses, when we came
on more open country, with detached sandhills and better feed,
though very dry. Large reaches of water ; rocky banks of sand-
stone in places ; bars of rock cross the creek. Camped near some
sandhills, at a large waterhole. After camping, tried fishing, and
good success, only that I lost two hooks, which I can ill spare.
Caught five silver perch, weighing from lb. to 3 lbs., and several
others were caught by the party by firelight. The fish excellent,
and of a fine flavour. Distance, 17 miles.
Sept. 13. Camp 30 ; lat. 27� 38', long. 141�.?Made a short
stage to-day, for the sake of feed for the horses, which is a thing
to be considered from the dry appearance of the country. Reached
the depot, Fort Wills, in 3 miles, through country rather better
than we have seen for some days. More rain has fallen here
lately than elsewhere, and the grass is just springing, but too
short to be of much use. I believe this to be the first rain for
many months. The water all down the creek, as far as we have
come, has fallen at the rate of about 3 feet in the last four months.
Found the depot as Mr. Brahe left it, the plant untouched, and
nothing removed of the useless things lying about but a piece of
leather. But from the very evident fact that things are buried, I
cannot understand why the natives have not found them. From
here, followed down the creek for several miles, and camped at
some sandhills near a pool of water. Saw here the track of a
large camel going up the creek. The small crested pigeon, spoken
of by Sturt, numerous. Cool wind from south-east.
Sept. 14. Camp 31 ; lat 27� 42', long. 140� 4',?We had a
late start this morning, as three of the horses went away, and one
ill: indeed, I doubted at first whether he would be able to travel.
Followed the course of the creek down for about 9 miles, crossing
several branches which go out south, and form a reach of water


before re-entering the main creek. Here the rocky ridges on
both sides close in, and the water has forced a narrow deep channel
through a perfect wall of rock, forming below the finest reach of
water we have yet seen ?about 500 yards wide and several miles
long, and very deep. The rugged hills on the north side, and the
fine gums on its banks, produce a fine effect. The rock through
which the channel has been worn is of a hard, flinty nature, in-
clined to be columnar, but forming huge masses of boulders.
Deep round hollows have been worn in these by the floods, and at
the water?s edge, in one place where I tried the depth, the rock is
perpendicular below the surface. Waterfowl, fish, and turtle are
plentiful. The immediate neighbourhood, and as far as one can
see on each side, is destitute of vegetation and very stony. We
had some trouble in getting the horses and camels over the masses
of rough stone which block up both sides of the creek. Leaving
this, we struck across a large bend, over sandy country, with large
red-sand hummocks, and better grassed than any we had yet seen
on the creek. More rain must have fallen here, as pools of water
were visible in many places. About 3 o?clock struck the creek
again, with a wide sandy bed, heavily timbered with box and gum,
and scrubby. This creek, I think, had been running slightly, from
the watermarks, and a good deal of green grass was growing on
the banks. Camped on a large waterhole, about a quarter of a
mile below Mr. Burke?s first camp after leaving the depot. We
could see where the camels had been tied up, but found no marked
tree. To-day I noticed in two or three places old camel-droppings
a id tracks, where Mr. Brahd informed me he was certain their
camels had never been, as they were watched every day near the
depot, and tied up at night. Mr. Burke?s camels were led on the
way down. It looked very much as if stray camels had been
about during the last four months. The tracks seemed to me to
be going up the creek, but the ground was too stony to be able to
make sure.
Sept. 15. Camp 32 ; lat. 27� 44', long. 140� 40'.?On leaving
this morning I went ahead with Sandy, to try and pick up Mr.
Burke?s track. At the lower end of a large waterhole found
where one or two horses had been feeding for some months; the
tracks ran in all directions to and from the water, and were as
recent as a week. At the same place I found the handle of a
clasp-knife. From here struck out south for a short distance
from the creek, and found a distinct camel?s track and droppings
on a native path; the footprint was about four months old, and
going east. I then set the black boy to follow the creek, and
struck across some sandy country in a bend on the north side.
No tracks here ; and, coming on a native path leading my way, I
followed it as the most likely place to see any signs. In about 4


miles this led me to the lower end of a very large reach of water,
and on the opposite side were numbers of native wurleys. I
crossed at a neck of sand, and at a little distance again came on
the track of a camel going up the creek; at the same time I found
a native, who began to gesticulate in a very excited manner, and
to point down the creek, bawling out ? Gow, gow! ? as loud as
he could. When I went towards him he ran away, and finding it
impossible to get him to come to me, I turned back to follow the
camel-track and to look after my party, as I had not seen any-
thing of them for some miles. The track was visible in sandy
places, and was evidently the same I had seen for the last two
days. I also found horse-tracks in places, but very old. Crossing
the creek, I cut our track, and rode after the party. In doing so,
I came upon 3 lbs. of tobacco, which had lain where I saw it for
some time. This, together with the knife-handle, the fresh horse-
tracks, and the camel-track going eastward, puzzled me extremely,
and led me into a hundred conjectures. At the lower end of the
large reach of water before mentioned I met Sandy and Frank
looking for me, with the intelligence that King, the only survivor
of Mr. Burke?s party, had been found. A little farther on I found
the party halted, and immediately went across to the blacks?
wurleys, where I found King sitting in a hut which the natives
had made for him. He presented a melancholy appearance?
wasted to a shadow', and hardly to be distinguished as a civilised
being but by the remnants of clothes upon him. He seemed ex-
ceedingly weak, and I found it occasionally difficult to follow what
he said. The natives were all gathered round, seated on the
ground, looking with a most gratified and delighted expression.
Camped where the party had halted on a high bank close to the
water. I shall probably be here ten days, to recruit King before
returning.
Sept. 16. Camp 32,?King already looks vastly improved,
even since yesterday, and not like the same man. Have com-
menced shoeing horses and preparing for our return. Wind from
south-west, with signs of rain. The natives seem to be getting
ready for it.
Sept. 18. Camp 32.?Left camp this morning with Messrs.
Brahd, Welch, Wheeler, and King, to perform a melancholy duty
which has weighed upon my mind ever since we have camped
here, and which I have only put off until King should be well
enough to accompany us. We proceeded down the creek for 7
miles, crossing a branch running to the southward, and followed a
native track leading to that part of the creek where Mr. Burke,
Mr. Wills, and King camped after their unsuccessful attempt to
reach Mount Hopeless and the northern settlements of South Aus-
tralia, and where poor Wills died. We found the two gunyahs

pretty much as King had described them, situated on a sandbank
between two waterholes, and about a mile from the flat where
they procured the nardoo-seed, on which they managed to exist so
long. Poor Wills?s remains we found lying in the wurley in
which he died, and where King, after his return from seeking for
the natives, had burled him with sand and rushes. We carefully
collected the remains and interred them where they lay; and, not
having a Prayer-book, I read chapter xv. of 1 Corinthians, that we
might at least feel a melancholy satisfaction in having shown the
last respect to his remains. We heaped sand over the grave,
and laid branches upon it, that the natives might understand by
their own tokens not to disturb the last repose of a fellow-being,
I cut the following inscription on a tree close by, to mark the
spot: ?

The field-books, a note-book belonging to Mr. Burke, various
small articles lying about, of no great value in themselves, but now
invested with an interest from the circumstances connected with
them, and some of the nardoo-seed on which they had subsisted,
with the small wooden trough in which it had been cleansed, I
have now in my possession. We returned home with saddened
feelings, but I must confess that I felt a sense of relief that this
painful ordeal had been gone through. King was very tired when
we returned, and I must most unwillingly defer my visit to the
spot where Mr, Burke?s remains are lying until he is better able
to bear the fatigue.
Sept. 19. ?Shoeing horses. A very slow and troublesome job,
as many have never been shod before, and our forge is of the
most primitive description. This afternoon got the pigeons in
order of flying. Their tails being rubbed down by travelling so
far in a cage, I got the tails from several crested pigeons, and
inserted feathers in the stumps of our carriers, fastening the splices
with waxed thread; the plan answered far better than I had ex-
pected, and the birds can now fly about the aviary we have made
of a tent with the greatest ease.
Sept. 20. ?Started the pigeons at daybreak, each with a message
fastened to its legs. On throwing them up, they commenced
wheeling round the camp, but separated, one being chased by one
of the large kites which are always hovering about the creek.
After flying round in various directions with great speed they
gradually drew across the creek, when we lost sight of three; the

fourth, after making a large circle, pitched in a tree about a mile
off. After breakfast he was found under a bush, with a kite
watching him; and the feathers of one of the other pigeons were
found not far off, it having been killed. ? Of the two others nothing
has been seen, and I hope that they got clear away, but I am
much afraid that the experiment has proved a failure ; however, I
should have thought more of it if the pigeons had made a more
decided start. Last night the wind changed from north-east to
south-west, and brought up a slight shower. This morning south-
west, with heavy clouds, threatening rain. King improving
slowly, but very weak. Turned out the white pigeon again this
afternoon ; he flew into a gum standing in the camp, and has
taken up his quarters there?not a proper proceeding for a carrier-
pigeon, according to my ideas.
Sept. 21.?Finding it would not be prudent for King to go out
for two or three days, I could no longer defer making a search for
the spot where Mr. Burke died ; and with such directions as King
could give, I went up the creek this morning with Messrs. Brahe,
Welsh, Wheeler, and Aitkin. We searched the creek upwards
for 8 miles, and at length, strange to say, found the remains of
Mr, Burke lying among the tall plants under a clump of box-trees,
within 200 yards of our last camp, and not 30 paces from our
track. It was still more extraordinary that three or four of the
party and the two black boys had been close to the spot without
noticing it. The bones were entire, with the exception of the
hands and feet; and the body had been removed from the spot
where it first lay, and where the natives had placed branches over
it, to about 5 paces? distance. I found the revolver which Mr.
Burke held in his hand when he expired partly covered with leaves
and earth, and corroded with rust. It was loaded and capped.
We dug a grave close to the spot, and interred the remains
wrapped in the union-jack ?the most fitting covering in which the
hones of a brave hut unfortunate man could take their last rest.
On a box-tree, at the head of the grave, the following inscription
is cut: ?
Sept. 22.?The pigeon still keeps its quarters at the camp, and
comes down to feed now and then. I have removed the message,
and shall leave it to its fate. It has been trying hard to rain for
two or three days, but does not seem able; great clouds drift over,
looking ready to burst, but only squeeze out two or three drops,
and then pass over. I expect fully that it will clear up without
2 g 2


rain; another dry season will make Cooper?s Creek look fearfully
miserable. When the hot weather comes on, the water-holes will
many of them be dry, unless filled by rain or a flood. I have
written down King?s narrative as much as possible in his own
words. Shall annex it to this diary. Finished shoeing the horses.
Sept. 23.?Went down the creek to-day, in search of the natives.
One of the party accompanied me, and we took two days? rations,
in case it should be necessary to prolong our search. Two days
after we camped here the natives left, and have not been seen
since ; and I could not think of leaving without showing them that
we could appreciate and reward the kindness they had shown to
Burke?s party, and particularly to King. For 3 miles we travelled
over alluvial flats along the creek, timbered with box and large
gums, and dotted with bean-trees, orange-trees of large size, but at
present without fruit, various kinds of acacias, and other bushes.
To the right hand level flats and sand-ridges, apparently tolerably
grassed. We then came on a large reach of water, where four or
five natives had just been fishing; their nets were lying on the
sand to dry, and the fire yet burning. Not seeing any one about,
and getting no answer to a cooey, we went on. At 3 miles
more we passed the first feeder of Strzelecki?s Creek, going to the
southward, and at a large reach of water below found the natives
camped. They made a great commotion when we rode up, but
seemed very friendly. 1 unpacked my blanket, and took out
specimens of the things I intended giving them?a tomahawk, a
knife, beads, a looking-glass, comb, and flour and sugar. The
tomahawk was the great object of attraction ; after that the knife;
but I think that the looking-glass surprised them most. On seeing
their faces some seemed dazzled, others opened their eyes like
saucers, and made a rattling noise with their tongues, expressive of
surprise. We had quite a friendly palaver, and my watch amused
them immensely. When I gave them some of the sugar to taste,
it was absurd to see the sleight-of-hand with which they pretended
to eat it; I suppose from a fear of being poisoned, which I suppose
is general, as our black boys are continually in dread lest the
?wild black fellow? should poison them by some means. I made
them understand that they were to bring the whole tribe up next
morning to our camp to receive their presents, and we parted the
best of friends. The names of the principal men are Tchukulow,
Mungallee (three in number), Toquunter, Pitchery (three in
number, one a funny little man, with his head in a net, and a
kite?s feather in it?another a tall man, with his beard tied in a
point), Pruriekow, and Borokow.
Sept. 24.?This morning, about ten o?clock, our black friends
appeared in a long procession, men, women, and children, or, as
they here also call them, piccaninnies; and at a mile distance they


commenced bawling at the top of their voices as usual. When
collected all together on a little flat, just below our camp, they must
have numbered between 30 and 40, and the uproar was deafening.
With the aid of King, I at last got them all seated before me, and
distributed the presents ?tomahawks, knives, necklaces, looking-
glasses, combs, among them. I think no people were ever so
happy before, and it was very interesting to see how they pointed
out one or another who they thought might be overlooked. The
piccaninnies were brought forward by their parents, to have red
ribbon tied round their dirty little heads. One old woman, Carra-
waw, who had been particularly kind to King, was loaded with
things. I then divided 50 lbs, of sugar between them, each one
taking his share in a union-jack pocket-handkerchief, which they
were very proud of. The sugar soon found its way into their
mouths; the flour?so lbs. of which I gave them?they at once
called ? white fellow nardoo,? and they explained that they under-
stood that these things were given to them for having fed King.
Some old clothes were then put on some of the men and women,
and the affair ended in several of our party and several of the
black fellows having an impromptu ? corroboree,? to the intense
delight of the natives, apd, I must say, very much to our own
amusement. They left, making signs expressive of friendship,
carrying their presents with them. The men all wore a net girdle;
and of the women, some wore one of leaves, others of feathers. I
feel confident that we have left the best impression behind us;
that the ? white fellows,? as they have already learned to call us,
will be looked on henceforth as friends; and that, in case of emer-
gency, any one will receive the kindest treatment at their hands.
Sept. 25, at Camp 31. ?This morning I turned my face home-
wards. The object of our mission being fulfilled, I had to do so,
but I return with a great regret at not being able to go on. We
take back five months? rations from this date, at the scale we have
been using, and which has proved sufficient. The party are in the
best of health, the horses in fine order, and the camels none the
worse for their journey, and decidedly in better health than when
they left the Darling. On the edge of a country so well worth
exploring, in a tolerably good season, and with the means I now
have at my disposal, I feel how much might be done. We camped
to-day at our last camp but one coming down the creek, making
an easy stage for King. Got in by noon, as the horses were very
fresh after their spell. The camels gave us a good deal of trouble
this afternoon, and from a cause which may, and probably will,
constantly occur. One of the male camels had taken to driving
the females about, and fighting with the other male, Sama, who up
to this time had been master. To-day the other camel was furious,
and, in spite of being short-hobbled, and having his head tied


down to his knee, chased the whole of the camels from the camp,
ten minutes after they were let loose; and although Brahe went
immediately after them, and was for three hours on their tracks, he
was unable to overtake them. Coming back for a horse, he took
Sandy with him, and cut across to where he had left the tracks,
running north, over some very rough stony country. It was dark
before they returned, having found the camels some miles away.
From this and similar occurrences I find it very unwise to take
male and female camels on a journey together. One is never safe
for a day from their straying, and from continual fights between the
male camels for mastery. The result is, that the camels are con-
tinually harassed, and watch each other instead of feeding. With
either all male or all female camels there would be less, or certainly
not more trouble, than with horses; and with this drawback, I
firmly believe in the suitability of camels for exploring.
Sept. 26.?Made 10 miles, and camped where the creek forces a
passage through the rocks.
Sept. 27.?Obliged to stay where we are, as one of the mares
foaled during the night. Knocked the foal on the head. Blowing
hot wind.
Sept. 28.?Camped at the fish-pond, having made only 15 miles.
King very tired; cannot ride on a camel, as he thought, and had
to give him a horse, to try if it would be easier for him. Dug up
the things planted by Mr. Burke and Mr. Wills, and found the
field-books and papers all safe. All hands fishing this evening,
and a large number of fish caught, varying from a quarter of a
pound to three pounds and a quarter. Blowing a strong hot wind
from north and north-east; will dry up the surface-water very fast.
Sept. 29.?The doctor does not consider that King should travel
to-day, so shall remain here. Could not have a much better place
on the creek?plenty of feed and abundance of fish. A dozen
caught this morning, weighed nearly 20 lbs. Two of the party
caught 72 lbs. weight from three o?clock to sundown. They are
most excellent eating. Ido not know any fish of as fine a flavour.
Strong gale from north and north-east, and very hot. If this goes
on without rain, we shall have some pushing to do before reaching
Kolialto ;* and, without rain has fallen, 1 do not think we can
depend with certainty on any water from Poria to Nandtherunga
Creek?about 180 miles.
Sept. 30.?Camped at our 28th camp. Surface-water nearly all
gone, and no feed. Found a small pool at the mouth of a gully,
but all the other water in the creek was as salt as brine. Hot
wind again.
October I.?Halted above our 27th camp, at a number of water-

holes, where there was pretty good feed. Passed our black friends
on the road, who invited us to stop and eat fish and nardoo, and
have a corroboree. Strong hot wind from' north-west round to
north-east ?the fifth day now ; and it seems to have blown away
every sign-- of clouds. The sky looks hard and blue, with a grey
haze on the horizon, and the vegetation is withering fast. Where
we camped happened to be not more than a couple of hundred
yards from a large native camp, situated in a branch channel, and
completely hidden by dense timber and scrub. When we arrived, all
the men excepting three old fellows were away, and only the lubras
and piccaninnies were at home, in a terrible fright at so many
white fellows squatting down close to them. They began to pack
up their things for a flight; but an amicable understanding being
brought about, and some of the men returning, we were soon the
best of friends. I distributed the few remaining presents, and they
gave in return some chewed pitchery and nardoo-balls. One old
greybeard had been as far as W 7 anominta Creek, and could repeat
the names of the various waters between here and that place, via
Balloo ; but I found him impenetrable on any other road. There
were about twenty men, all well made and well fed; and several
were old patriarchs, and some of them apparently old rascals too.
They were far more inclined to be troublesome and importunate
than our friends lower down, particularly one tall young fellow,
rubbed all over with red earth, who pestered me for a tomahawk.
One of them had had his arm broken above the wrist, and roughly
bandaged up with rags and grass-cord; the doctor set it properly,
and it was remarkable to see the perfect composure with which the
black fellow bore the operation. In assisting, I had to use my
clasp-knife to cut bark-splints, and, laying it down beside me, it of
course vanished, and I saw no more of it; but, strange to say, in
the same place shortly afterwards one of the knives was found which
I had given the black fellows, which, I suppose, they had exchanged
for mine, on the principle of the old saying, that ? exchange is no
robbery.? After a whde the natives began to draw in too close to
our camp, talking a good deal about our ? portos,? or bundles, so
that we had to draw a line as a boundary?a hint they took at once,
and all squatted down beyond it. At dusk I fired off two rockets,
to their unbounded surprise; but they were not so alarmed as I
expected, probably from feeling that we were kindly disposed
towards them. I believe that the sight of us smoking, and seeing
the smoke coming out of our mouths, alarmed them much more, as
some made signs to put the pipe away, and others got up and
walked off, looking behind them. At dark they retired to their
camp.
Oct. 2.?This morning the natives came up and commenced a
brisk trade in nets, grass-string girdles, boomerangs, and other


things, for old clothes, rags, and such like valuable property. For
part of an old blanket I obtained two boomerangs; a large staff
used in digging roots; one of the long-pointed sticks used in
fishing; a stone tomahawk, cemented into a box-wood handle; and
the head of a larger one, about the size and shape of am American
axe, which the proprietor, a tall old warrior, with one very sinister
eye, scraped up from the sand by his hut. The smaller tomahawk
he dropped twice between his camp and ours, and pretended he had
never had it, until I made him understand that I was not going to
be done, when he burst out laughing, and sent his lubra back for
it. Phe whole mob sat down by our camp, and observed us
packing up with great interest, but were terribly frightened at the
horses, more so than at the camels. They accompanied us for
half a mile on our road, and then waited looking after us for a
while. Camped at some sandhills near our 26th camp; the only
water near being a pool of liquid mud, from which we obtained a
small supply of water by draining the surface. In going up, this
was a fine channel. Day rather hot, but the wind from the south,
and a great improvement on the last five of hot winds.
Oct. 3. This morning the clouds began to bank up from the
south, drawing northward, with every sign of a thunder-storm.
During the time we were travelling, before reaching our camp, the
clouds continued to gather in masses, threatening rain, but dis-
persed as they passed over towards an arch of blue sky to the
north. The country much greener since we came down, owing to
the two nights? rain we had. Camped at the remains of what was
a large sheet of water in one of the branches of the creek. It has
now a very unpleasant taste of soda, and produces thirst, rather
than quenches it. Sent Phillips away after dinner on one of the
spare horses, to run our track as far as possible before night among
the sandhills, to see if there was any water in the polygonum-flats.
1 he clouds still gathering, and thunder and heavy rain to the north-
west and south-east. We lit a fire at dark on the edge of the
plain, but had great difficulty in keeping it up, as the natives had
burned all the dead wood near the water; by means of this, and
rockets fired occasionally, Phillips returned about nine o?clock,
having been 10 miles on the track. He reported the water to be
almost dried up, and had only seen two small pools of mud. The
night very dark, with thunder and lightning, but no rain.
Oct. 4.?Started late this morning, as I wished all the horses to
drink well before leaving the creek; and also as I had to send the
camels 2 miles to fill the water-bags, this pool being scarcely drink-
able. I went on ahead of the party to search for water, but did
not leave the track for the 10 miles Phillips had been over. The
sandhills are looking splendid, the two nights? rain having covered
them with grass and herbage; and even the earthy flats between


the ridges show some signs of vegetation. About three o?clock I
came on four native children sleeping under the shade of a box-
tree, and covered with nets. One waking suddenly, started up in
a terrible fright at such an unusual sight, and ran off screaming
into the polygonum, where I saw its mother peeping at me through
a bush. When I called out to her to come, she did so, but kept at
a very respectful distance. I asked her for water, and, to reassure
her, gave her an old handkerchief. She got her children gathered
round her, two on her back, and one carrying a fourth, all of them
screaming loudly; and, having pointed out a little pool of mud,
moved off to a sandhill, where she commenced bawling to some of
the natives, who seemed to be about half-a-mile off. I went off to
hunt over the flat for water, and shortly heard shouts of ? Gew,
gew,? behind me, from three natives, who came running up in an
excited state, each with a boomerang ora waddy. We soon, how-
ever, came to a friendly understanding by means of the few words
I knew ; and the promise of a knife decided them to show me the
water. One of them, a jolly-looking young fellow, minus his front
teeth, took the lead; the other two, both of them dressed in red
paint and a head-net, keeping a little on one side. We kept up a
sort of conversation, and in half an hour came to their camp, a
large hut on a sandhill, with a small pool of water near, among
the clay-pans. I was very much amused at the ceremonious way
in which my guide led the way, pointing out the best road, and
very earnestly making me notice the bushes in my way, as if I were
in danger of falling over them. They gave me as usual a ball of
chewed pitchery, and seemed very much surprised that neither I
nor my horses cared about drinking. I found it quite impossible
to make them understand that the water-hole was too small. My
guide, having received his knife, was now very anxious to have my
shirt, which, of course, 1 objected to ; and, as I could learn nothing
more, I gave them a few matches, and rode on my way. My four
black friends, however, either out of politeness, or in the hopes of
getting my shirt, followed me, and kept so close behind the tail of
my horse, each with a waddy in his hand, that I thought it best to
send them back to their camp, whither they went, after some jab-
bering among themselves. About 3 miles farther on I found eight
small channels of water in a polygonum-flat, containing sufficient
water for ourselves and our horses for two days. Camped here,
when the party came up, in splendid feed.
Oct. s.?Camped to-day at the tank, which, with the channel
by it, is brimful of water. The country looks beautiful, the sand-
hills are covered with flowers and bushes in full bloom, and swarm
with birds of all kinds. It has every appearance of being spring
here. Passed several fine channels of water by the track. Natives
in various places scattered through these sandhills. It is very


difficult to estimate the number of the blacks here, but I believe
they cannot be far short of 400, belonging to Cooper?s Creek.
Oct. 6, Stokes? Ranges, Surprise Creek.?Left the tank this
morning, carrying as much water as possible on the camels, and
two horseloads, sufficient for ourselves for four days, and one drink
for the horses; calculating on making Koliatti or Poria Creek in
four days. If I find water on the track, I intend striking for
Wilkie?s Creek. The sandhills covered with grass and flowers,
and even the bare clayed plains and the miserable stony country
between them and the ranges had struggled into something
resembling vegetation. The ranges, where we entered them, by
Brahd?s Gap, are not so high as where we crossed them more to
the westward, but ran in low ridges along wide stony valleys,
formed by the numerous gorges we found so difficult to cross.
Mulga and acacia scrub everywhere, but not much feed ; only salt-
bush and very short herbage grown since the rains. We were
agreeably surprised by a fine water-hole in the first creek we came
to, which proved to be the lowest of several of nearly the same size
higher up the creek. I believe it to be about 10 yards wide and
80 long, and some 3or 4 feet deep. Distance 18 miles.
Oct. 7, Stokes? Ranges, Keppel Creek; lat. 28� 17', long.
142 J 30'.?We were late in leaving camp this morning, as nineteen
of the horses had followed the track back for several miles. The
country travelled through for 15 miles was much of the same cha-
racter?wide stony flats surrounded by low ridges, and intersected
by gum-creeks coming from the gorges in a northerly direction.
We passed through a succession of gaps, in each of which we found
a creek with pools of clear rain-water; and, from the very loose
gravelly nature of the ground, I am inclined to believe that these
creeks are still running slowly underground since the rain. At 15
miles came on the south slopes of the range, with a wide view
towards Koliatti and Poria. Camped on a small watercourse near
its junction with Keppel Creek. Two tolerable pools of water.
Another make-believe thunderstorm to-night, with violent gusts of
wind, but no rain, excepting at two places to the north-west, where
it appeared to be raining, about a mile wide. Everything looks
spring-like here.
Oct. 8, Junction Camp, No. 21.?Crossed Keppel Creek, and
crossed over stony slopes for 6 miles, when we crossed the creek on
to barren sandy plains. At 3 miles entered the sandhills, and
found the country terribly burned up, and no signs of water. Rain
cannot have fallen here for some time. Made our old camp in
22 miles from Keppel Creek, and found water still in the small
creek, but the feed very dry and scanty.
, Oct. 9, Poria Creek. ?When the party started this morning I
went to the westward of the track, and found that at a short


distance the sandhills terminated in the gum-forest and poly-
gonum-swamps before mentioned. From a high sandhill I could
see across these for many miles towards the range, in a westerly
direction; and I believe that they also extend to or across Wilkie
Creek to the south. I found no water, but lam convinced that
there are other channels similar to the one we camped on last
night, which will contain water for months after rain. At Wilkie
Creek I again left the track, and followed the creek upwards,
crossing several deep channels running in and out from it, and lull
of water. At a short distance I came on a large sheet of water,
certainly more than a mile long, and about 80 feet wide, and, with
the couch-grass growing on its banks and large box-timber,
having a striking resemblance to some of the smaller branches of
Cooper?s Creek. It is a far finer watercourse than lat first sup-
posed. Made Poria Creek about two o?clock. The country very
dry and parched ; we seem, in one day?s journey, to have travelled
from spring to spring.

Sunday, December 16, 1860.?The two horses having been shod,
and our reports finished, we started at 6?40 a.m. for Eyre?s Creek;
the party consisting of Mr. Burke, myself, King, and Charley,
having with us six camels, one horse, and three months? provisions.
We followed down the creek to the point where the sandstone
ranges cross the creek, and were accompanied to that place by
Brahe, who would return to take charge of the depot. Down to
this point the banks of the 'creek are very rugged and stony, but
there is a tolerable supply of grass and salt-bush in the vicinity.
A large tribe of blacks came pestering us to go to their camp and
have a dance, which we declined. They were very troublesome,
and nothing but the threat to shoot them will keep them away ;
they are, however, easily frightened, and, although fine-looking
men, decidedly not of a warlike disposition. They show the
greatest inclination to take whatever they can, but will run no
unnecessary risk in so doing. They seldom carry any weapons,
except a shield and a large kind of boomerang, which I believe they
use for killing rats, &c. ; sometimes, but very seldom, they have a
large spear ; reed-spears seem to be quite unknown to them. Fhey
are undoubtedly a finer and better looking race of men than the
blacks on the Murray and Darling, and more peaceful; but in other
respects I believe they did not compare favourably with them, for,


from the little we have seen of them, they appear to be mean-
spirited and contemptible in every respect.
Monday, Dec. 17. ?We continued to follow down the creek.
Found its course very crooked, and the channel frequently dry for
a considerable distance, and then forming- magnificent water-holes,
abounding in waterfowl of all kinds. The country on each side is
more open than on the upper part of the creek. The soil on the
plains is of a light earthy nature, supporting abundance of salt-hush
and grass. Most of the plains are lightly timbered, and the
ground is finer, and not cracked up, like at the head of the creek.
Left Camp No. 67 at ten minutes to six A.M., having breakfasted
before leaving. We followed the creek along from point to point,
at first in a direction w.n.w. for about 12 miles, then about north-
west. At about noon we passed the last water, a short distance
beyond which the creek runs out on a polygonum (.Polygonum
Cunninghami) flat; but the timber was so large and dense, that it
deceived us into the belief that there was a continuation of the
channel ; on crossing the polygonum-ground to where we expected
to find the creek, we became aware of our mistake. Not thinking
it advisable to chance the existence of water a head, we camped
at the end of a large but shallow sheet of water in the sandy
bed of the creek. The hole was about 150 links broad. In
most places the temperature of the water was almost incredibly
high, which induced me to try it in several places. The mean
of two on the shady side of the creek gave 97-4�. As may
be imagined, this water tasted disagreeably warm, but we soon
cooled some in water-bags, and, thinking that it would be interest-
ing to know what we might call cool, I placed the thermometer
in a pannikin containing some that appeared delightfully cool
?almost cold, in fact. Its temperature was, to our astonish-
ment, 78�. At half-past six, when a strong wind was blowing
from south, and the temperature of the air had fallen to 80�, the
lowest temperature of water in the hose, that had been exposed to
the full effect of evaporation for several hours, was 72 \ This
water for drinking appeared positively cold, too low a temperature
to be pleasant under the circumstances. A remarkable southerly
squall came on between five and six p.m,, with every appearance
ot rain. The sky, however, soon cleared, but the wind cbntinued
to blow in a squally and irregular manner, from the same quarter
at evening.
Wednesday, Dec. 19.?Started at a quarter past eight A.M.,
leaving what seemed to be the end of Cooper?s Creek. VVe took
a course a little to the north of west, intending to try and obtain
water in some of the creeks that Sturt mentioned that he had
crossed, and at the same time to see whether they were connected


with Cooper?s Creek, as appeared most probable from the direction
in which we found the latter running, and from the manner in
which it had been breaking up into small channels flowing across
the plains in a north and N.N.W. direction. We left on our right
the flooded, flats on which this branch of the creek runs out, and
soon came to a series of sand-ridges, the direction of which was
between north and N.N.W. The country is well grassed,
and supports plenty of salt-bush. Many of the valleys are liable to
be inundated by the overflow of the main creek. They have
watercourses and polygonum-flats, bordered with box-trees, but we
met with no holes fit to hold a supply of water. At about 10
miles we crossed a large earthy flat, lightly timbered with box and
gum. The ground was very bad for travelling on, being much
cracked up, and intersected by innumerable channels, which con-
tinually carried off the water of a large creek. Some of the valleys
beyond this were very pretty ; the ground being sound and covered
with fresh plants, which made them look beautifully green. At
15 miles we halted, where two large plains joined. Our attention
had been attracted by some red-breasted cockatoos, pigeons, a
crow, and several other birds, whose presence made us feel sure
that there was water not far off; but our hopes were soon destroyed
by finding a claypan just drying up. It contained just sufficient
liquid to make the clay boggy. At ten minutes to seven p.m. we
moved on, steering straight for Eyre?s Creek, north-west by north,
intending to make a good night?s journey, and avoid the heat of
the day; but at a mile and a half we came to a creek, which
looked so well that we followed it for a short distance, and, finding
two or three water-holes of good milky water, we camped for the
night. This enabled me to secure an observation of the eclipse of
Jupiter?s Ist satellite, as well as some latitude observations. The
night was so calm that I used the water as a horizon, but I find
it much more satisfactory to take the mercury, for several reasons.
Thursday , Dec. 21 (20).? We did not leave this camp until
half-past eight, having delayed to refill the water-bags with the
milky water, which all of us found to be a great treat again. It
is certainly more pleasant to drink than the clear water, and at the
same time more satisfying. Our course from here, north-west by
north, took us through some pretty country, lightly timbered and
well grassed. We could see the line of creek-timber winding
through the valley on our left. At a distance of 5 miles there was
a bush-fire on its banks, and beyond it the creek made a con-
siderable bend to the south-west. At 2 miles farther we came in
sight of a large lagoon bearing north by west, and at 3 miles more
we camped on what would seem the same creek as last night, near
where it enters the lagoon. The latter is of great extent,, and
contains a large quantity of water, which swarms with wild fowl of


every description. It is very shallow, but is surrounded by the
most pleasing woodland scenery, and everything in the vicinity
looks fresh and green. The creek near its junction with the lagoon
contains some good water-holes, sto 6 feet deep. They are found
in a sandy alluvium, which is very boggy when wet. There was a
large camp of not less than forty or fifty blacks near where we
stopped. They brought us presents of fish, for which we gave
them some beads and matches. These fish we found to be a most
valuable addition to our rations. They were of the same kind as
we had found elsewhere, but finer, being 9 to 10 inches long, and
2 to 3 inches deep, and in such good condition that they'might
have been fried in their own fat. It is a remarkable fact, that
these were the first blacks who have offered us any fish since we
reached Cooper?s Creek.
Friday, Dec. 21.?We left Camp 70 at half-past five a.m., and
tried to induce one or two of the blacks to go with us, but it was
of no use. Keeping our former course we were pulled up at 3
miles by a fine lagoon, and then by the creek that flows into it:
the latter being full of w 7 ater, we w'ere obliged to trace it a mile up
before we could cross. I observed on its banks two wild plants of
the gourd or melon tribe ; one much resembling a stunted cucumber,
the other, both in leaf and appearance of fruit, was very similar to
a small model of a water-melon (probably MucMa micrantha).
The latter plant I also found at Camp 68. On tasting the pulp of
the newly-found fruit, w r hich was about the size of a large pea, I
found it to be so acrid that it was with difficulty that I removed the
taste from my mouth. At Bor 9 miles from where w 7 e crossed the
creek we passed another large lagoon, leaving it 2 miles on our
left, and shortly afterwards we saw one nearly as far on our right.
1 his last we should have availed ourselves of, but that we expected
to find w r ater in a creek winch w r e could see, by the timber lining
its banks, flowed from the lagoon on our left, and crossed our
course a few miles a-head. We reached it at a distance of 4or 5
miles farther, and found a splendid water-hole, at which we
camped. Ihe creek at this point flows in a northerly direction,
through a large lightly-timbered flat, on which it partially runs out.
The ground is, however, sound and well clothed with grass and
salsolaceous plants. Up to this point the country through w'hich
we have passed has been of the finest description for pastoral
purposes. The grass and salt-bush are everywhere abundant, and
water is plentiful, with every appearance of permanence. We met
with porcupine-grass (Triodia pungens, Br.) and only tw 7 o sand-
ridges before reaching Camp 71.

Saturday , Dec. 22.?At five minutes to five a.m. we left one of
the most delightful camps we have had in the journey, and pro-
ceeded on the same course as before, north-west by north, across
some high ridges of loose sand, many of which were partially
clothed with porcupine-grass. We found the ground much worse
to travel over than any we have yet met with, as the ridges
were exceedingly abrupt and steep on their eastern side, and
although sloping gradually towards the west, were so honeycombed
in some places by the burrows of rats, that the camels were con-
tinually in danger of falling. At a distance of about 6 miles we
descended from these ridges to undulating country of open box-
forest, where everything was green and fresh. There is an
abundance of grass and salt-bushes, and lots of birds of all de-
scriptions. Several flocks of pigeons passed over our heads,
making for a point a little to our right, where there is no doubt
plenty of water, but we did not go off our course to look for it.
Beyond the box-forest, which kept away to the right, we again
entered the sand-ridges, and at a distance of 6 miles passed close
to a dry salt-lagoon, the ridges in the vicinity of which are less
regular in their form and direction, and contain nodules of
limestone. The ground in the flats and claypans near has that
encrusted surface which cracks under the pressure of the foot, and
is a sure indication of the presence of saline deposits. At a distance
of 8 miles from the lagoon we camped at the foot of a sand-ridge,
jutting out on the stony desert. I was rather disappointed, but
not altogether surprised, to find the latter nothing more nor less
than the stony rises that we had before met with, only on a larger
scale, and not quite as undulating. During the afternoon several
crows came to feed on the plain. They came from an e.n.e.
direction, no doubt from a portion of the creek that flows through
the forest which we left on our right. In the morning, as we were
loading, a duck passed over, but it was too dark to see which way
it went.
Sunday, Dec. 23.?At five a.m, we struck out across the desert
in a w.n.w. direction. At 4 miles and a half we crossed a sand-
ridge, and then returned to our n.w. by n. course. We found
the ground not nearly so bad for travelling on as that between
Bulloo and Cooper?s Creek?in fact, I do not know whether it
arose from our exaggerated anticipation of horrors or not, but we
thought it far from bad travelling ground; and as to pasture, it is
only the actually stony ground that is bare, and many a sheep-
run is worse grazing than that. At 15 miles we crossed another
sand-ridge, for several miles around which there is plenty of grass


and fine salt-bush. After crossing this ridge we descended to an
earthy plain where the ground was rather heavy, being in some
places like pieces of slaked lime and intersected hy small water-
courses, Flocks of pigeons rose from amongst the salt-bushes and
polygonum, hut all the creeks were dry, although marked by lines
of box-timber. Several gunyahs of the blacks were situated near
a water-hole that had apparently contained water very lately, and
heaps of grass were lying about the plains, from which they had
beaten the seeds. We pushed on, hoping to find the creeks
assuming an improved appearance, but they did not, and at one
o?clock we halted, intending to travel through part of the night;
about sunset three flocks of pigeons passed over us, all going in
the same direction, due north by compass, and passing over a ridge
of sand in that direction. Not to have taken notice of such an
occurrence would have been little short of a sin, so w r e determined
to go Bor 10 miles in that direction. Starting at seven o?clock
p.m., we, at 6 miles, crossed the ridge over which the birds had
flown, and came on a flat, subject to inundation; the ground was
at first hard and even, like the bottom of a clay pan, but at a mile
or so we came on cracked earthy ground, intersected by number-
less small channels running in all directions. At 9 miles we
reached the bed of a creek running from east to west; it was only
bordered by polygonum-bushes ; but as there was no timber visible
on the plains, we thought it safer to halt until daylight, for fear we
should miss the water. At daylight, when we had saddled, a small
quantity of timber could be seen, at the point of a sand-ridge,
about to 2 miles to the west of us, and on going there we found
a fine creek, with a splendid sheet of water, more than a mile long
and averaging nearly three chains broad; it is, however, only 2or
3 feet deep in most parts.
Monday , Dec. 24.?We took a day of rest on Gray?s Creek to
celebrate Christmas. This was doubly pleasant, as we had never
in our most sanguine moments anticipated finding such a de-
lightful oasis in the desert. Our camp was really an agreeable
place, for we had all the advantages of food and water attending a
position on a large creek or river, and were at the same time free
from the annoyance of the numberless ants, flies, and mosquitoes
that are invariably met with amongst timber or heavy scrub.
Tuesday , Dec. 25.?We left Gray?s Creek at half-past four a.m.,
and proceeded to cross the earthy rotten plains in the direction of
Eyre?s Creek. At a distance of about 9 miles we reached some
lines of trees and bushes, which were visible from the top of the
sand-ridge at Gray?s Creek.* We found them growing on the
banks of several small creeks, which trend to the north and n.n.w.
At a mile and a half farther we crossed a small creek, n.n.e., and
joining the ones above-mentioned. This creek contained abundance


of water, in small detached holes, from 50 to 100 links long, well
shaded by steep banks and overhanging bushes. The a
suspiciously tiansparent colour and a slight trace of brackishness,
but the latter was scarcely perceptible. Near where the creek
joined them is a sandhill and a dense mass of fine timber. The
smoke of a fire indicated the presence of blacks, who soon made
their appearance, and followed us for some distance, beckoning us
away to the north-east. We, however, continued our course to the
north-west by north ; but, at a distance of a mile and a half, found
that the creeks did not come round as we expected, and that the
fall of the water was in a direction nearly opposite to our course,
or about west to east. We struck ofl north -J-west for a high
sand-ridge, from which we anticipated seeing whether it were worth
while for us to follow the course of the creeks we had crossed.
We were surprised to find all the watercourses on the plains
trending rather to the south of east; and at a distance of 3 miles,
after changing our course, and when we approached the sandhills
towards which we had been steering, we were agreeably pulled up
by a magnificent creek, coming from the n.n.w. and running in
the direction of the fire we had seen. We had now no choice but
to change our course again, for we could not have crossed even if
we had desired to do so. On following up the south bank of the
creek, we found it soon keeping a more northerly course than it
had where we first struck it. Phis fact, together with its magni-
tude general appearance, lessened the probability of its being
Eyre s Creek, as seemed at first very likely from their relative
positions and directions. The day being very hot, and the camels
tired from travelling over the earthy plains, which, by-the-by, are
not nearly so bad as those at the head of Coopers Creek, we
camped at one o?clock p.m., having traced the creek up about 5
miles, not counting the bends. For the whole of this distance we
found not a break or interruption of water, which appears to be
very deep: the banks are from 20 to 30 feet above the water, and
very steep; they are clothed near the water?s edge with mint and
other weeds, and on the top of each side there is a belt of box-trees
and various shrubs. The lower part of the creek is bounded
towards the north by a high red sand-ridge, and on the south side
is an extensive plain, intersected by numerous watercourses, which
drain off the water in flood time. The greater portion of the
plain is at present very bare, but the stalks of dry grass show that
after ram or floods there will be a good crop on the harder and
well-drained portion: I believe the loose earthy portion supports
no vegetation at any time. Phe inclination of the ground from
the edge of the creek-bank towards the plain is in many places
very considerable. This I should take to indicate that the flooding
is or has been at one time both frequent and regular.
voL, xxxii. 2 a


Wednesday , Dec. 26.?We started at 5 a.m., following up the
creek from point to point of the bends; its general course was at
first north by west, but at about 6 miles the sand-ridge on the west
closed in on it, and at this point it takes a turn to the N.N.E. for
half-a-mile, and then comes around suddenly north-west. Up to
this point it had been rather improving in appearance than other-
wise, but in the bend to the north-west the channel is very broad:
its bed, being limestone-rock and indurated clay, is, for a space of
sor 6 chains, quite dry; then commences another water-hole, the
creek keeping a little more towards north. We crossed the creek
here and struck across the plain on a due north course, for we
could see the line of timber coming up to the sand-ridges in that
direction. For a distance of 7 or 8 miles we did not touch the
creek, and the eastern sand-ridge receded to a distance in some
places of nearly 3 miles from our line, leaving an immense extent
of grassy plain between it and the creek. The distinctly-marked
feature on the lower part of this creek is, that whenever the main
creek is on one side of a plain, there is always a fine billibong on
the opposite side, each of them almost invariably sticking close to
the respective sand-ridges. Before coming to the next bend of the
creek, a view from the top of a sandhill showed me that the creek
receives a large tributary from the north-west, at about 2 miles
above where we had crossed it. A fine line of timber running up
to the north-west joined an extensive tract of box-forest, and the
branch we were following was lost to view in a similar forest
towards the north. The sand-ridge was so abrupt when we came
to the creek, that it was necessary to descend into its bed through
one of the small ravines adjoining it. We found it partially run
out; the bed being sand, and strewed with nodules of lime, some of
which were 1| to 2 feet long. They had apparently been formed
in the sand-downs by infiltration.

Tuesday , December 30.?Finding that the creek was trending
considerably towards the east, without much likelihood of altering
its course, we struck off from it, taking a ten days? supply of water,
as there were ranges visible to the north which had the appearance
of being stony. A north-east by north course was first taken for
about 7 miles, in order to avoid them. The whole of this distance
was over alluvial earthy plains, the soil of which was firm, but the
vegetation scanty.

Saturday , Jan. 5, 1861.?0n leaving Camp 84, we found slight
but distinct indications of rain in the groves, and a few blades of
grass and small weeds in the little depressions on the plain. These
indications were, however, so slight, that but for the fact of our
having found surface-water in two holes near our camp, we should
hardly have noticed them. At a distance of about 2 miles, in a
n.n.e. direction, we came to a creek with a long, broad, shallow
water-hole. The well-worn paths, the recent track of natives, and
the heaps of shells, on the contents of which the latter had feasted,
showed at once that this creek must be connected with some creek
of considerable importance. The camels and horses being greatly
in need of rest, we only moved up about half a mile, and camped
for the day.
Sunday, Jan. 6.?Started at twenty minutes to six o?clock,
intending to make an easy day?s stage along the creek. As we
proceeded up in a northerly direction we found the water-hole to
diminish in size very much, and at about 2| miles the creek ran
out in a lot of small watercourses. At the upper end of the creek
we found in its bed what appeared to be an arrangement for catch-
ing fish. It consisted of a small oval mud-paddock, about 12 feet
by 8 feet, the sides of which were about 9 inches above the bottom
of the hole, and the top of the fence, covered with long grass, so
arranged that the ends of the blades overhung scantily by several
inches the sides of the hole. As there was no sign of timber to
the north, we steered off to north-west by north for a fine line that
came up from the south-west, and seemed to run parallel with the
creek we were about to leave. At a distance of about 3 miles we
reached the bank of a fine creek containing a sheet of water two
chains broad, and at least 15 feet deep in the middle. The banks
are shelving, sandy, and lightly clothed with box-trees and various
shrubs. On starting to cross the plains towards this creek, we
were surprised at the bright green appearance of strips of land,
which look in the distance like swamps. On approaching some of
them we found that there had been a considerable fall of rain in
some places, which had raised a fine crop of grass and portulac *
wherever the soil was of a sandy and light nature; but the amount
of moisture had been insufficient to affect the clayey ground which
constitutes the main portion of the plain. The sight of two native
companions feeding here added greatly to the encouraging pro-
spects ; they are the only specimens of that bird that I remember to
have seen on that side of the Darling.
Jan. 7.?We started at half-past four a.m. without water, thinking
* Portulaca olerasca.?L.

that we might safely rely on this creek for one day?s journey.
We, however, found the line of timber soon begin to look small;
at 3 miles the channel contained only a few pools of surface-water.
We continued across the plains on a due north course, frequently
crossing small watercourses, which had been filled by the rain, but
were fast drying up. Here and there as we proceeded dense lines
of timber on our right showed that the creek came from the east of
north. At a distance of 13 miles we turned to the n.n.e., towards
a fine line of timber. We found a creek of considerable dimen-
sions that had only two or three small water-holes; but as there
was more than sufficient for us, and very little feed for the beasts
anywhere else, we camped. I should have liked this camp to have
been in a more prominent and easily recognised position, as it happens
to be almost exactly on the tropic of Capricorn. Ihe tremendous
gale of wind that we had in the evening and night prevented me
from taking a latitude observation, whereas I had some good ones
at the last camp, and at Camp 86. My reckoning cannot be far
out. I found on taking out my instruments one of the spare ther-
mometers was broken, and the glass of my aneroid barometer
cracked; the latter, I believe, not otherwise injured. This was
done by the camel having taken it into his head to roll while the
pack was on his back.
Tuesday , Jan. B.? Started at a quarter past 5 a.m. with a load
of water, determined to be independent of all creeks and water-
courses. At a mile and a half found surface-water in a small creek,
and at a mile farther water in two or three places on the open
plains. The country we crossed for the first 10 miles consists of
fine open plains of firm argillaceous soil, too stiff and hard to be
affected by the small quantity of rain that has fallen as yet. They
are subject to inundations from the overflow of a number of small
creeks which intersect them in a direction e.n.e. to W.S.W. Nearly
all the creeks are lined with box-trees and shrubs, in a tolerably
healthy state; of the remains of dead trees there is only a fair
proportion to the living ones. After traversing a plain of greater
extent than the rest, we at 10 miles reached the creek, propor-
tionately large and important-looking. The channel, however, at
the point where we struck it, was deep, level, and dry, but I believe
there is water in it not far off; for there were some redbreasted
cockatoos in the trees, and native parrots on each side. On the
north side there is a part bearing off to the n.n.w. The mirage
on the plain to the south of the creek was stronger than I have
before seen it. There appear to be sheets of water within a few
yards of one, and it looks sufficiently smooth and glassy to be used for
an artificial horizon. To the westward of the plains some fine sand-
hills were visible, nearly in the direction in which the creek flowed.
To the north of the creek the country undergoes a great change.


At first there is a little earthy land subject to inundation. The soil
then becomes more sandy, and the stony pans occur in which water
collects after rain ; the whole country is slightly undulating, lightly
timbered, and splendidly grassed. A number of small disconnected
creeks are scattered about, many of which contained water, pro-
tected from the sun by luxuriant growth of fine grasses and small
bushes. We passed one or two little rises of sand and pebbles, on
which were growing some trees quite new to me: but for the seed-
pods, I should have taken them for a species of casuarinae, although
the leaf-stalks have not the jointed peculiarities of those plants.
The trunks and branches are like the she-oak, the leaves like those
of a pine ; they droop like a willow; and the seed is small, flat, in a
large flat pod about 6 inches by three-quarters of an inch. As we
proceeded the country improved at every step. Flocks of pigeons
rose and flew off to the eastward, and fresh plants met our view on
every rise ; everything green and luxuriant. The horse licked his
lips, and tried all he could to break his nose-string to get at the
feed. We camped at the foot of a sandy rise, where there was a
large stony pan with plenty of water, and where the feed was equal
in quantity, and superior as to variety, to any that I have seen in
Australia, excepting, perhaps, on some soils of volcanic origin.
Wednesday , Jan. 9.?Started at five minutes past five without
water, trusting to get a supply from the rain that fell during the
thunderstorm. Traversed 6 miles of undulating plains covered
with vegetation richer than ever. Several ducks rose from the
little creeks as we passed, and flocks of pigeons were flying in
all directions. The richness of the vegetation is evidently not
sudden, arising from chance thunderstorms, for the trees and
bushes on the open plain are everywhere healthy and fresh-looking;
very few dead ones are to be seen ; besides which the quantity of
dead and rotten grass which at- present almost overgrows in some
places the young blades, shows that this is not the first crop of the
kind. The grasses are numerous, and many of them unknown to
me, but they only constitute a moderate portion of the herbage;
several kinds of spurious vetches and portulac, as well as salso-
laceae, add to the luxuriance of the vegetation. At 7 miles we
found ourselves in an open forest-country, where the feed was
good, but not equal to what we had passed, neither had it been
visited by yesterday?s rain. We soon emerged again on open
plains, but, the soil being of a more clayish nature, they were not
nearly so much advanced in vegetation as the others. We found
surface-waters in several places, and at one spot disturbed a fine
bustard which was feeding in the long grass. We did not see him
until he flew up. I should have mentioned that one flew over our
camp last evening in a northerly direction : this speaks well for the
country and climate. At noon we came to a large creek, the


course of which was from ej.e. to w.s.w. The sight of white
gum-trees in the distance had raised hopes which were not at all
damped on a close inspection of the channel. At the point where
we struck it there was certainly no great quantity of water; the
bed was broad and sandy, hut its whole appearance was that of an
important watercourse ; and the large gums which line its banks,
together with the improved appearance of the soil, and the abun-
dance of feed in the vicinity, satisfied us as to the permanency of
the waters and the value of the discovery. Although it was so
early in the day, and we were anxious to make a good march, yet
we camped here, as it seemed to be almost a sin to leave such
good quarters. The bed of the creek is loose sand, through which
the water freely permeates: it is, however, sufficiently coarse not
to be boggy; and animals can approach the water without any
difficulty.
Thursday , Jan. 10.?At 5*20 a.m. we left our camp with
a full supply of water, determined to risk no reverses, and to
make a good march. I should mention that last evening we had
been nearly deafened by the noise of the cicadae, and but for
our large fires should have been kept awake all night by the
mosquitoes. A walk of 2 miles across a well-grassed plain
brought us to a belt of timber, and we soon afterwards found our-
selves pulled up by a large creek, in which the water was broad
and deep. We had to follow up the bank of the creek in a north-
east direction for nearly a mile before we could cross, when, to our
joy, we found that it was flowing, not a muddy stream from the
effects of recent floods, but a small rivulet of clear water as pure
as crystal. The bed of the river at this place is deep and rather
narrow: the water flows over sand and pebbles, winding its way
between clumps of melaleuca and gum-saplings. After leaving
the river we kept our old course, due north, crossing, in a distance
of one mile, three creeks with gum-trees on their banks. The soil
of the flats through which they flow is a red loam of fair quality
and well grassed. Beyond the third creek is a large plain, parts
of which are very stony ; and this is bounded towards the east by
a low stony rise, partly composed of decayed and honeycombed
quartz-rock in situ , and partly of water-worn pebbles and other
alluvial deposits. At about 2 miles across this plain we reached
the first of a series of small creeks with deep water-holes. These
creeks and holes have the characteristics peculiar to watercourses
which are found in flats formed from the alluvial deposits of schis-
tose rocks. The banks are on a level with the surrounding
ground, and are irregularly marked by small trees, or only by
tufts of long grass which overhang the channel and frequently hide
it from one?s view, even when within a few yards. At about 5
miles from where we crossed the river we came to the main creek


in these flats?Patten?s Creek ; it flows along at the foot of a
stony range, and we had to trace it up nearly a mile in a n.n.e.
direction before we could cross it. As it happened, we might
almost as well have followed its course up the flat, for at a little
more than 2 miles we came to it again; we re-crossed it at a stony
place just below a very large water-hole, and then continued our
course over extensive plains, not so well grassed as what we had
passed before, and very stony in some places. At 8 miles from
Patten?s Creek we came to another, running from south-west to
south-east. There was plenty of water in it, but it was evidently
the result of recent local rains; on the banks was an abundance of
good feed, but very little timber.
Friday , Jan. 11.?Started at five A.M., and in the excitement of
exploring fine well-watered country forgot all about the eclipse of
the sun, until the reduced temperature and peculiarly gloomy
appearance of the sky drew our attention to the matter; it was
then too late to remedy the deficiency, so we made a good day?s
journey, the moderation of the midday-heat, which was only about
86�, greatly assisting us. The country traversed has the most
verdant and cheerful aspect, abundance of feed and water every-
where. All the creeks seen to-day have a course more or less to
the east by south. The land improves in appearance at every
mile. A quantity of rain has fallen here and to the south, and
some of the flats are suitable for cultivation if the regularity of the
seasons will admit.

Saturday , Jan. 12. ?We started at five A.M., and, keeping as
nearly as possible a due north. course, traversed for about 8 miles
a splendid flat, through which flow several fine well-watered creeks,
lined with white gum-trees. We then entered a series of slaty,
low sandstone ranges, amongst which were some well-grassed flats
and plenty of water in the main gullies. The more stony portions
are, however, covered with porcupine-grass, and here and there
with mallee. Large ant-hills are very numerous; they vary in
height from 2| to 4 feet. There was a continuous rise perceptible
all the way in crossing the ranges, and from the highest portion,
which we reached at a distance of about 7 miles, we had a pretty
good view of the country towards the north. As far as we could
see in the distance, and bearing due north, was a large range,
having somewhat the outline of a granite mountain. The east end
of this range just comes up to the magnetic north ; the left of this,
and bearing n.n.w., is a single conical peak, the top of which only
is visible. Farther to the west there were some broken ranges,


apparently sandstone ; to the east of north the tops of very distant
and apparently higher ranges were seen, the outline of which was
so indistinct that I can form no idea as to their character. The
intermediate country below us appeared alternations of fine valleys
and stony ranges, such as we had just been crossing. From here a
descent of 2 miles brought us to a creek having a northern course,
but, on tracing it down for about a mile, we found it turn to the
south-east, and join another from the north. We crossed over to
the latter on a north-by-west course, and camped on the west bank.
It has a broad sandy channel; the water-holes are large, but not
deep; the banks are bordered with fine white gums, and are in
some places very scrubby. There is abundance of rich green feed
everywhere in the vicinity. We found numerous indications of
blacks having been here, but saw nothing of them. It seems remark-
able that where their tracks are so plentiful, we should [have seen]
none since we left King?s Creek. I observed that the natives here
climb trees like those on the Murray, &c., in search of some animal
corresponding in habits to the opossum, which they get out of the
hollow branches in a similar manner. I have not yet been able to
ascertain what the animal is.
Sunday , Jan. 13.?We did not leave camp this morning until
half-past seven, having delayed for the purpose of getting the
camels? shoes on, a matter in which we were eminently unsuc-
cessful. We took our breakfast before starting, for almost the first
time since leaving the depot. Having crossed the creek, our
course was due north as before, until at about 6 miles we came in
sight of the range ahead, when we took a north half-east direction
for the purpose of clearing the eastern front of it. We found the
ground more sandy than what we had before crossed, and a great
deal of it even more richly grassed. Camp 93 is situated at the
junction of three sandy creeks, in which there is abundance of
water. The sand is loose, and the water permeates freely, so that
the latter may be obtained delightfully cool and clear by sinking
anywhere in the beds of the creeks.

Saturday , January 19, 1861.?Started from Camp 98 at 5 - 30
a.m., and passing to the north-west of Mount Forbes, across a fine
and well-grassed plain, kept at first a north by east direction; at
a distance of three miles the plain became everywhere stony,
being scattered over with quartz-pebbles, and a little farther on
we came to low quartz-ranges, the higher portions of which are
covered with porcupine-grass, but the valleys are well clothed with
a variety of coarse and rank herbage. At about 5 miles we


crossed a creek with a sandy bed, which has been named Green?s
Creek. There were blacks not far above where we crossed, but
we did not disturb them. After crossing the creek, we took a due
north course, over very rugged quartz-ranges of an auriferous
character. Pieces of iron ore, very rich, were scattered in great
numbers over some of the hills. On our being about to cross one
of the branch-creeks in the low range, we surprised some blacks?
a man, who, with a young fellow apparently his son, was upon a
tree cutting out something, and a lubra with a piccaninny. The
two former did not see me until I was nearly close to them, and
then they were dreadfully frightened. Jumping down from the
trees, they started off shouting what sounded to us very like ? Joe,
joe! ? Thus disturbed, the lubra, who was some distance from
them, just then caught sight of the camels and the remainder of
the party as they came over the hill into the creek, and this
tended to hasten their flight over the stones and porcupine-grass.
Crossing the range at the head of this creek, we came on a gully
running north, down which we proceeded, and soon found it open
out into a creek at two or three points, in which we found water.
On this creek we found the first specimen of an eucalyptus, which
has a very different appearance from the members of the gum-tree
race; it grows as high as a good-sized gum -tree, but with the
branches less spreading; in shape it much resembles the elm ; the
foliage is dark, like that of the lightwood ; the trunk and branches
are covered with a grey bark, resembling in outward appearance
that of the box-tree. Finding that the creek was trending too
much to the eastward, we struck off to the north again, and at a
short distance came on a fine creek running about s.s.e. As it
was now time to camp, we travelled it up for about a mile and a
half, and came to a fine water-hole in a rocky basin, at which
there were lots of birds.

Sunday , Jan. 27, 1861,?Started from Camp 105, five minutes
past two in the morning; we followed along the bends of the creek
by moonlight, and found the creek wind about very much, taking
on the whole a north-east course. At about 5 miles it changed
somewhat its features; from a broad and sandy channel, winding
about through gum-tree flats, it assumes the unpropitious appearance
of a straight narrow creek running in a n.n.e. direction between
high perpendicular earthy banks. After running between 3 and 4
miles in this manner, it took a turn to the west, at which point
there is a fine water-hole, and then assumed its original character.
Below this we found water at several places, but it all seemed to


be either from surface-drainage or from springs in the sand. The
land in the vicinity of the creek appears to have received plenty of
rain, the vegetation everywhere green and fresh, but there is no
appearance of the creek having flowed in this part of the channel
for a considerable period. Palm-trees are numerous, and some
bear an abundance of small round dates (nuts) just ripening.
These palms give a most picturesque and pleasant appearance to
the creek.
Wednesday , Jan. 30.?Started at half-past seven a.m. After
several unsuccessful attempts at getting Golah out of the bed ot
the creek, it was determined to try bringing him down until we
could find a place for him to get out at; but after going in this
way two or three miles, it was found necessary to leave him
behind, as it was almost impossible to get him through some of the
water-holes, and King had separated from the party, which became
a matter for very serious consideration, when we found blacks
hiding in the box-trees close to us.

Sunday , February 3, 1861.?Finding the ground in such a
state from the heavy falls of rain that the camels could scarcely
be got along, it was decided to leave them at Camp 119, and for
Mr. Burke and I to proceed towards the sea on foot. After
breakfast we accordingly started, taking with us the horse and
three days? provisions. Our first difficulty was in crossing Billy?s
Creek, which we had to do where it enters the river, a few hundred
yards below the camp. In getting the horse in here, he got
bogged in a quicksand-bank so deeply as to be unable to stir, and
we only succeeded in extricating him by undermining him on the
creek side, and then lunging him into the water. Having got all
the things in safety, we continued down the river-bank, which bent
about from east to west, but kept a general north course. A
great deal of the land was so soft and rotten that the horse, with
only a saddle and about 25 pounds on his back, could scarcely
walk over it. At a distance of about five miles we again had him
bogged in crossing a small creek, after which he seemed so weak
that we had great doubts about getting him on. We, however,
found some better ground close to the water?s edge where the
sandstone-rock runs out, and we stuck to it as far as possible.


Finding that the river was bending about so much that we were
making very little progress in a northerly direction, we struck off
due north, and soon came on some tableland where the soil is
shallow and gravelly, and clothed with box and swamp-gums.
Patches of the land were very boggy, but the main portion was
sound enough; beyond this, we came on an open plain covered
with water up to one?s ankles. The soil here was a stiff clay, and
the surface very uneven, so that between the tufts of grass one
was frequently knee-deep in water. The bottom, however, was
sound, and no fear of bogging. After floundering through this
for several miles, we came to a path formed by the blacks, and
there were distinct signs of a recent migration in a southerly
direction. By making use of this path we got on much better, for
the ground was well-trodden and hard. At rather more than a
mile the path entered a forest, through which flowed a nice water-
course, and we had not gone far before we found places where the
blacks had been camping. The forest was intersected by little
pebbly rises on which they had made their fires; and in the sandy
ground adjoining, some of the former had been digging yams,*
which seemed to be so numerous that they could afford to leave
lots of them about, probably having only selected the very best.
We were not so particular, but ate many of those that they had
rejected, and found them very good. About half a mile farther
we came close on a black fellow, who was coiling by a camp-fire,
whilst his gin and piccaninny were jabbering alongside. We
stopped for a short time to take out some of the pistols that were
on the horse, and that they might see us before we were so near as to
frighten them. Just after we stopped, the black got up to stretch
his limbs, and after a few seconds looked in our direction. It was
very amusing to see the way in which he stared, standing for some
time as if he thought he must be dreaming, and then having
signalled to the others, they dropped on their haunches and shuffled
off' in the quietest manner possible. Near their fire was a fine hut,
the best I have ever seen, built on the same principle as those at
Cooper?s Creek, but much larger and more complete. I should
say a dozen blacks might comfortably coil in it together. It is
situated at the end of the forest, towards the north, and looks out
on an extensive marsh, which is at times flooded by the sea-
water. Hundreds of wild geese, plover, and pelicans were enjoying
themselves in the water-courses on the marsh; all the water on
which was too brackish to be drinkable, except some holes that
are filled by the stream that flows through the forest. The neigh-
bourhood of this encampment is one of the prettiest we have seen
during the journey. Proceeding on our course across the marsh,
* The Dioscorea of Carpentaria.


we came to a channel through which the sea-water enters. Here
we passed three blacks, who, as is universally their custom, pointed
out to us, unasked, the best part down. This assisted us greatly,
for the ground we were taking was very boggy. We moved
slowly down, about three miles, and then camped for the night.
The horse, Billy, being completely baked, next morning we started
at daybreak, leaving him short-hobbled.

Tuesday , February 19, 1861, Boocha?s Camp.
Wednesday , Feb. 20, Pleasant Camp, 5 R.
Thursday , Feb. 21, Recovery Camp, 6 R.?Between four and
five o?clock a heavy thunderstorm broke over us, having given
very little warning of its approach. There had been lightning
and thunder towards the "south-east and south ever since noon
yesterday. The rain was incessant and very heavy for an hour
and a half, which made the ground so boggy that the animals
could scarcely walk over it. We nevertheless started at ten
minutes to seven a.m., and, after floundering along for half an
hour, halted for breakfast. We then moved on again, but soon
found that the travelling was too heavy for the camels, so camped
for the remainder of the day. In the afternoon the sky cleared
a little, and the sun soon dried the ground, considering. Shot a
pheasant, and much disappointed at finding him all feathers and
claws. This bird nearly resembles a cock-pheasant in plumage,
but in other respects it bears more the character of the magpie or
crow ; the feathers are remarkably wiry and coarse.
Friday , Feb. 22, Camp 7 R.?A fearful thunderstorm in the
evening, about eight p.m., e.s.e., moving gradually round to south.
The flashes of lightning were so vivid and incessant as to keep
up a continual light for short intervals, overpowering even the
moonlight. Heavy rain and strong squalls continued for more
than an hour, when the storm moved off w.n.w. ; the sky re-


mained more or less overcast for the rest of the night, and the
following morning was both sultry and oppressive, with the ground
so boggy as to be almost impassable.
Saturday , Feb. 23, Camp 8 R.?ln spite of the difficulties
thrown in our way by last night?s storm, we crossed the creek.
We were shortly afterwards compelled to halt for the day, on a
small patch of comparatively dry ground near the river. The
day turned out very fine, so that the soil dried rapidly; and we
started in the evening to try a trip by moonlight. We were very
fortunate in finding sound ground along a billihong, which per-
mitted of our travelling for about five miles up the creek, when
we camped for the night. The evening was most oppressively hot
and sultry?so much so, that the slightest exertion made one feel
as if he were in a state of suffocation. The dampness of the
atmosphere prevented any evaporation, and gave one a helpless
feeling of lassitude that 1 have never before experienced to such
an extent. All the party complained of the same sensations, and
the horses showed distinctly the effect of the evening trip, short as
it was. We had scarcely turned in half an hour when it began to
rain, some heavy clouds having come up from the eastward, in
place of the layer of small cirro cumuli that before ornamented the
greater portion of the sky. These clouds soon moved on, and we
were relieved from the dread of additional mud. After the sky
cleared, the atmosphere became rather cooler and less sultry ; so
that, with the assistance of a little smoke to keep the mosquitoes
off, we managed to pass a tolerable night.
Sunday , Feb. 24, Camp 9 R.?Comparatively little rain has
fallen above the branch-creek with the running water. The
vegetation, although tolerably fresh, is not so rank as that we
have left. The water in the creek is muddy but good, and has
been derived merely from the surface-drainage of the adjoining
plains. The Melaleuca continues in this branch-creek, which
creeps along the foot of the ranges.
Monday , Feb. 25, Camp 10 R.?There has been very little
rain on this portion of the creek since we passed down. There
was, however, no water at all there, at this point. At the
Tea-tree Spring, a short distance up the creek, we found
plenty of water in the sand, but it had a disagreeable taste from
the decomposition of leaves and the presence of mineral matter?
probably iron. There seems to have been a fair share of rain
along here, everything is so very fresh and green; and there is
water in many of the channels we have [crossed].
Tuesday , Feb. 26, Apple-tree Camp, HR.
Thursday , Feb. 28, Reedy Gully Camp, 12 R.?Came into
the Reedy Gully Camp about midnight on Tuesday, the 26th.


Remained there throughout the day on Wednesday, starting at
2 a.m. on Thursday.
Friday , March 1, Camp of the Three Crows, 13 R.
Saturday , March 2, Salt-bush Camp, 14 R.?Found Golah.
He looks thin and miserable. Seems to have fretted a great
deal, probably at finding himself left behind; and he has been
walking up and down the tracks till he has made a regular
pathway. Could find no sign of his having been far off it,
although there is splendid feed, to which he could have gone.
He began to eat as soon as he saw the other camels.
Sunday , March 3, Eureka Camp, 15 R.-?ln crossing a creek
by moonlight, Charley rode over a large snake. He did not
touch him, and we thought it was a log until he struck it with
the stirrup-iron. We then saw that it was an immense snake,
larger than any that 1 have ever before seen in a wild state. It
measured 8 feet 4 inches in length, and 7 inches in girth round
the belly. It was nearly the same thickness from the head to
within 20 inches of the tail; it then tapered rapidly. The weight
was lbs. From the tip of the nose to five inches back the neck
was black, both above and behind; throughout the rest of the
body the under part was yellow, and the sides and back had
irregular brown transverse bars on a yellowish-brown ground. I
could detect no poisonous fangs, but there were two distinct rows
of teeth in each jaw, and two small claws or nails, about three-
eighths of an inch long, one on each side of the vent.
Monday , March 4, Feasting Camp, 16 R. ?-Shortly after
arriving at Camp 16, we could frequently hear distant thunder
towards the east, from which quarter the wind was blowing.
During the afternoon there were frequent heavy showers, and
towards evening it set in to rain steadily, but lightly. This lasted
until about eight p.m., when the rain ceased, and the wind got
round to west: the sky, however, remained overcast until late in
the night, and then cleared for a short time ; the clouds were soon
succeeded by a dense fog, or mist, which continued until morning.
The vapour having then risen, occupied the upper air in the form
of light cir.-stratus and cumuli clouds.
Tuesday , March 5, Camp 17 R.?Started at two a.m. on a s.s.w.
course, but had soon to turn in on the creek, as Mr. Burke felt
very unwell, having been attacked by dysentery since eating the
snake. He now felt giddy, and unable to keep his seat. At six
a.m., Mr. Burke feeling better, we started again, following along
the creek, in which there was considerably more water than when
we passed down. We camped at 2T5 p.m., at a part of the creek
where the date-trees * were* very numerous, and found the fruit

nearly ripe, and very much improved on what it was when wo
were here before.
Wednesday , March 6, Camp 18 R.?Arrived at the former
camp ; and find the feed richer than ever, and the ants just as
troublesome. Mr. Burke is a little better, and Charley looks
comparatively well. The dryness of the atmosphere seems to
have a beneficial effect on all. We found, yesterday, that it was a
hopeless matter about Golah, and we were obliged to leave him
behind, as he seemed to be completely done up, and could not
come on, even when the pack and saddle were taken off.
Thursday , March 7, Fig-tree Camp, 19 R.?Palm-tree Camp,
No. 104, and 20� latitude; by observation coming down, 20 J
21?40'. There is less water here than there was when we passed
down, although there is evidence of the creek having been visited
by considerable floods during the interval. Feed is abundant,
and the vegetation more fresh than before. Mr. Burke almost
recovered ; but Charley is again very unwell, and unfit to do any-
thing. He caught cold last night through carelessness in covering
himself.
Friday , March 8, Camp 20 R.?Followed the creek more
closely coming up than going down. Found more water in it
generally.
Saturday , March 9, Camp 21 R.?Reached our former camp
at P3O p.m. Found the herbage much dried up, but still plenty
of feed for the camels.
Sunday , March 10, Camp 22 R.?Camped at the junction
of a small creek from the westward, a short distance below our
former camp, there being plenty of good water here; whereas the
supply at Specimen Camp is very doubtful.
Monday , March 11, Camp 23 R.?Halted for breakfast at
the Specimen Camp at 7 - 15 a.m. Found more water and feed
there than before. Then proceeded up the creek, and got safely
over the most dangerous part of our journey. Camped near
the head of the gap, in a flat about two miles below our former
camp at the gap.
Tuesday , March 12, Camp 24 R.
Wednesday , March 13, Camp 25 R.?Rain all day, so
heavily that I was obliged to put my watch and fieldbook in the
pack, to keep them dry. In the afternoon the rain increased, and
all the creeks became flooded. We took shelter under some
fallen rocks, near which was some feed for the camels, but the
latter was of no value, for we had soon to remove them up amongst
the rocks, out of the way of the flood, which fortunately did not
rise high enough to drive us out of the cave; but we were obliged
to shift our packs to the upper part. In the evening the water fell


as rapidly as it had risen, leaving everything in a very boggy
state. There were frequent light showers during the night
Thursday, March 14, Camp 26 R, Sandstone Cave. ?The
water in the creek having fallen sufficiently low, we crossed over
from the cave, and proceeded down the creek. Our progress was
slow, as it was necessary to keep on the stony ridge instead of
following the flats, the latter being very boggy after the rain.
Thinking that the creek must join Scratchley?s near our old camp,
we followed it a long way, until, finding it trend altogether too
much eastward, we tried to shape across for the other creek; hut
were unable to do so, from the boggy nature of the intervening
plain.

evening the sky was clouded about nine p.m., and a shower came
down from the north. At ten o?clock it became so dark that we
camped on the bank of the creek, in which was a nice current of
clear water. To-day we halted, intending to try a night-journey.
The packs we overhauled, and left nearly 60 lbs. weight of things
behind. They were all suspended in a pack from the branches of
a shrub close to the creek. We started at a quarter to six, but
were continually pulled up by billibongs and branch-creeks, and
soon had to camp for the night. At the junction of the two creeks
just above [are] the three cones, which are three remarkable small
hills to the eastward.
Thursday , March 21, Humid Camp, 33 R.?Unable to
proceed on account of the slippery and boggy state of the ground.
The rain has fallen very heavily here to-day, and every little
depression in the ground is either full of water or covered with
slimy mud. Another heavy storm passed over during the night,
almost [extinguishing] the miserable fire we were able to get up
with our very limited quantity of water-logged and green wood.
Having been so unfortunate last night, we took an early breakfast
this morning at Camp 33, which I have named the Humid Camp,
from the state of dampness in which we found everything there;
and crossing to the east bank of the main creek, proceeded in a
southerly direction nearly parallel with the creek. Some of the
flats near the creek contain the richest alluvial soil, and are
clothed with luxuriant vegetation. There is an immense extent
of plain back, of the finest character for pastoral purposes, and the
country bears every appearance of being permanently well watered.


We halted on a large billibong at noon, and were favoured durino*
dinner by a thunderstorm, the heavier portion of which missed
some passing north and some south, which was fortunate, as it
would otherwise have spoiled our baking process, a matter of some
importance just now. We started again at seven o?clock, but the
effects of the heavy rain prevented our making a good journey.
Friday, March 22, Muddy Camp, 34 R.?Had an early
breakfast this morning, and started before sunrise. Found that
the wet swampy ground that checked our progress last night was
only a narrow strip, and that had we gone a little farther we might
have made a fine journey. The country consisted of open, well-
grassed, pebbly plains, intersected by numerous small channels, all
containing water. Abundance of fine rich portulaca was just
bursting into flower along all these channels, as well as on the
greater portion of the plain. The creek that we camped on last
night ran nearly parallel with us throughout this stage. We
should have crossed it to avoid the stony plains, but were pre-
vented by the flood from so doing.
Saturday, March 23, Mosquito Camp, 35 R,?Started at a
quarter to six, and followed down the creek, which has much of
the characteristic appearance of the river Burke where we crossed
it on our up-journey. The land in the vicinity greatly improves
as one goes down, becoming less stony and better grassed. At
eleven o?clock we crossed a small tributary from the eastward, and
there was a distant range of considerable extent visible in that
direction. Halted for the afternoon in a bend, where there was
tolerable feed, for the banks are everywhere more or less scrubby.
Sunday , March 24, Three-hour Camp, 36 R.
Monday , March 25, Native-Dog Camp, 37 R. ?Started at
half-past five, looking for a good place to halt for the day. This
we found at a short distance down the creek, and immediately
discovered that it was close to Camp 89 of our up-journey. Had
not expected that we were so much to the westward. After
breakfast, took some time-altitudes, and was about to go back to
last camp for some things that had been left, when I found Grey
behind a tree, eating skilligolee. He explained that he was
suffering from dysentery, and had taken the flour without leave.
Sent him to report himself to Mr. Burke, and went on. He having
got King to tell Mr. Burke for him, was called up, and received a
good thrashing. There is no knowing to what extent he has been
robbing us. Many things have been found to run unaccountably
short. Started at seven o?clock, the camels in first-rate spirits.
We followed our old course back (south). The first portion of
the plains had much the same appearance as when we came up;
but that near Camp 88, which then looked so fresh and green, is
now very much dried up, and we saw no signs of water anywhere.
VOL. XXXII. 2 I


In fact there seems to have been little or no rain about here since
we passed. Soon after three o?clock we struck the first of several
small creeks or billibongs, which must be portions of the creek
with the deep channel that we crossed on going up, we being now
rather to the westward of our former course. From here, after
traversing about 2 miles of the barest clay-plain, devoid of all
vegetation, we reached a small water-course, most of the holes in
which contained some water of a milky or creamy description.
Fine salt-bush and portulac being abundant in the vicinity, we
camped here at 4 - 30 A.M. When we started in the evening, a
strong breeze had already sprung up in the south, which conveyed
much of the characteristic feeling of a hot wind. It increased
gradually to a force of five and six, but by eleven o?clock had
become decidedly cool, and was so chilly towards morning that we
found it necessary to throw on our ponchos. A few cir. cum.
clouds were coming up from the east when we started, but we
left them behind, and nothing was visible during the night but a
thin hazy veil. The gale continued throughout the 26th, be-
coming warmer as the day advanced. In the afternoon it blew
furiously, raising a good deal of dust. The temperature of air at
four p.m. was 94� in the shade. Wind trees all day.

good dry feed, various shrubs, salt-bushes, including cotton-bush
and some coarse kangaroo-grass ; water in the hollows on the
stony pavement. The neighbouring country chiefly composed of
stony rises and sand-ridges.
Monday, April 1, Camp 43 R.
Tuesday , April 2, Camp 44 R.?Thermometer broken.
Wednesday , April 3, Camp 45 R, Salt-Meat Camp.
Thursday, April 4, Camp 46 R, The Plant Camp.
Friday , April 5, Camp 47 R, Oil Camp.?Earthy and clayey
plains, generally sound and tolerably grassed; but in other places
bare salt-bush, withered.
Saturday, April 6, Wild-Duck Camp, 48 R.?Earthy flats, cut
into innumerable watercourses [succeeded by] fine open plains,
generally very bare, but having in some places patches of fine salt-


bush. The dead stalks of portulac and mallows show that those
plants are very plentiful in some seasons. [Towards noon came
upon] earthy plains and numerous billibongs.
Sunday, April 7, Camp 49 R.?Find the water and feed much
dried up. Nearly all the water we have met with has a slightly
brackish taste of a peculiar kind, somewhat resembling in flavour
potassio tartrate of soda.
Monday, April 8, Camp 50 R.?Camped a short distance above
Camp 75. The creek here contains more water, and there is a
considerable quantity of green grass in its bed, but it is much
dried up since we passed before. Halted 15 minutes to send back
for Gray, who gammoned he could not walk. Some good showers
must have fallen lately, as we have passed surface-water on the
plains every day. In the latter portion of to-day?s journey the
young grass and portulac are springing freshly in the flats and on
the sides of the sand-ridges.
Tuesday , April 9, Camp 51 R.?Camped on the bank of the
creek, where there is a regular field of salt-bush, as well as some
grass in its bed, very acceptable to the horse, who has not had a
proper feed for the last week until last night, and is, consequently,
nearly knocked up.
Wednesday, April 10, Camp 52 R.?Remained at Camp 52 R
all day to cut up and jerk the meat of the horse Billy, who was so
reduced and knocked up for want of food, that there appeared
little chance of his reaching the other side of the desert; and, as
we were running short of food of every description ourselves, we
thought it best to secure his flesh at once. We found it healthy
and tender, but without the slightest trace of fat in any portion of
the body.
Thursday, April 11.?Plenty of water in creek down to this
point.
Friday, April 12.?Extensive earthy plains, intersected by
numerous watercourses.
Saturday, April 13.?Small watercourses lined with lakes.
Plenty of salt-bush and chrysanthemums on either side. Camped
on Stony Desert.
[Note by Transcriber. ?Up to this point, as it appears from
Mr. Wills?s Fieldbook, the Expedition never passed a day in which
they did not traverse the banks of, or cross, a creek or other
watercourse.]
Sunday, April 14.
Monday, April 15. ?It commenced to rain lightly at five A.M.
this morning, and continued raining pretty steadily throughout the
day. Owing to the wet and the exertion of crossing the numerous
sand-ridges, Linda became knocked up about four o?clock, and we
2 i 2


had to halt at a claypan amongst the sandhills. [The party
seems to have crossed a creek near a native camp, about ten A.M.]
Tuesday , April 16.
Wednesday , April 17.?This morning, about sunrise, Gray died.
He had not spoken a word distinctly since his first attack, which
was just as we were about to start.
Thursday , April 18.?[Another creek and native camp were
passed.]
Friday , April 19.?Camped again without water on the sandy
bed of the creek, having been followed by a lot of natives who
were desirous of our company; but as we preferred camping alone,
we were compelled to move on until rather late, in order to get
away from them. The night was very cold. A strong breeze
was blowing from the south, which made the fire so irregular, that,
as on the two previous nights, it was impossible to keep up a fair
temperature. Our general course throughout the day had been
S.S.E.
Saturday , April 20.
Sunday, April 21. ?Arrived at the depot this evening just in
time to find it deserted. A note left in the plant by Brahe com-
municates the pleasing information that they have started to-day
for the Darling; their camels and horses all well and in good
condition ; we and our camels being just done up, and scarcely
able to reach the depot, have very little chance of overtaking them.
Brahe has fortunately left us ample provisions to take us to the
bounds of civilisation, namely:?flour, 50 lbs.; rice, 20 lbs. ;
oatmeal, 60 lbs.; sugar, 60 lbs.; and dried meat, 15 lbs. These
provisions, together with a few horse-shoes and nails, and some
castaway odds and ends, constitute all the articles left, and place
us in a very awkward position in respect to clothing. Our dis-
appointment at finding the depot deserted may easily be imagined ;
.?returning in an exhausted state, after four months of the
severest travelling and privation, our legs almost paralysed, so that
each of us found it a most trying task only to walk a few yards.
Such a leg-bound feeling I never before experienced, and hope I
never shall again. The exertion required to get up a slight piece
of rising ground, even without any load, induces an indescribable
sensation of pain and helplessness, and the general lassitude makes
one unfit for anything. Poor Gray must have suffered very much,
many times when we thought him shamming. It is most fortunate
for us that these symptoms, which so early affected him, did not
come on us until we were reduced to an exclusively animal diet of
such an inferior description as that offered by the flesh of a worn-
out and exhausted horse. We were not long in getting out the
grub that Brahe had left, and we made a good supper off some


oatmeal-porridge and sugar. This, together with the excitement
of finding ourselves in such a peculiar and almost unexpected
position, had a wonderful effect in removing the stiffness from our
legs. Whether it is possible that the vegetables cjfti so have
affected us, I know not; but both Mr. B. and I remarked a most
decided relief and a strength in the legs greater than we had had
for several days. I am inclined to think that but for the
abundance of portulac that we obtained on the journey, we should
scarcely have returned to Cooper?s Creek at [all].
Burke?s Notes of the Expedition.
These notes were often illegible, and in many places the pages
of the book had been ripped and cut out. The book was evidently
kept for rough memoranda.
The following extracts are from the memorandum-book of
Mr. Burke. Mr. Archer, to whom the task of transcribing it was
entrusted, writes the following preface :?? I went carefully through
Burke?s note-book last night. It is an ordinary memorandum-
book, with a clasp, and a side pocket for a pencil. It is much
dilapidated, and several of the leaves are torn out. Some so torn
had been written on. I have numbered these consecutively
throughout. The following is a copy, letter for letter, and word
for word, of all that remains of Burke?s pencillings. I have
queried all doubtful points.?

well before giving an answer, and never speak except from strong
convictions.
Dec. 16, 1860.?Left Depot 65, followed by the creek.
Dec. 17.?The same, 66.
Dec. 18.?The same, 67,
Dec. 19.?We made a (?) small creek, supposed to be Otta
Era (?), or in the immediate neighbourhood of it. Good water,
Camp 69.
Dec. 20.?Made a creek where we found a great many natives
?they presented us with fish and offered their women, Camp 70.
Dec. 21.?Made another creek, Camp 71. Splendid water, fine
feed for the camels; would be a very good place for a station.
Since we have left Cooper?s Creek we have travelled over a very
fine sheep-grazing country, well watered, and in every respect
well suited for occupation.
Dec. 22, Camp 72.?Encamped on the borders of the desert.
Dec. 23.?Travelled day and night, and encamped in the night
in the bed of a creek, as we supposed we were near water.
Dec. 24. ?Encamped on the morning of this day on the banks
of Gray?s Creek, called after him because he was detached on


horseback from the party, and found it good water. The third
day without it. Now for a retrospective glance. We started from
Cooper?s Creek, Camp 66, with the intention of going through to
Eyre?s Crelk without water. Loaded with 800 pints of water,
four riding-camels carried 130 pints, each horse 150, two pack-
camels 50 each, and 5 pints each man.
Dec. 25, Christmas-day.?Started at four a.m. from Gray?s
Creek, and arrived at a creek which appears to be quite as large
as Cooper?s Creek. At two p.m. Golah-Sing gave some very
decided hints about stopping by lying down under the trees;
splendid prospect.
Dec. 26, Dec. 27, Dec. 28, Dec. 29, followed up the creek until
it took a turn to the south-east, which I thought rather too much
to put up with, therefore left it on the morning of the 30th
December, 12*30, on the road?started at seven o?clock, travelled
eleven hours. 31st, started at 2*20, sixteen and a-half hours on
the road, travelled thirteen and a half hours.
Jan. 1, 1861.?Water.
Jan. 2, from King?s Creek.'?Eleven hours on the road. Started
at seven, travelled nine and a half hours ; desert.
Jan. 3.?Five started, travelled twelve hours no minutes.
Jan. 4.?Twelve hours on the road.
Jan. s.?Water at Wills? or King?s Creek. It is impossible to
say the time we were up, for we had to load the camels, to pack
and feed them, to watch them and the horse, and to look for
water, but I am satisfied that the frame of man never was more
severely taxed. [Here follows an entry for March 28th, com-
mencing thus, ? March 28th?At the conclusion of? then some of
the leaves appear to have been torn out from pages 43 to 55.]
Jan. 13, 1861.?As I find it impossible to keep a regular diary,
I shall jot down my ideas when I have an opportunity and put the
date. Upon two occasions, at Cooper?s Creek and at King?s
Creek, on New Year?s Day, whenever the natives tried to bully or
bounce us and were repulsed, although the leaders appeared to be
in earnest, the followers and particularly the young ones laughed
heartily and seemed to be amused at their leaders? repulse. The
old fellow at King?s Creek who stuck his spear into the ground
and threw dust in the air, when I fired off my pistol, ran oft - in the

Jan. 18. ?Still on the ranges, the camels sweating profusely
from fear.
Jan. 20.?1 determined to-day to go straight at the ranges, and
so far the experiment has succeeded well. The poor camels


sweating and groaning, but we gave them a hot hath in Turner?s
Creek, which seemed to relieve them very much. At last through
?the camels bleeding, sweating, and groaning. [Leaves 35 to 89
torn out, and eight leaves preceding torn out, no marks*of writing
visible on the remnant Leaves 24 to 33, both inclusive, blank on

March 28.?At the conclusion of report, it would be well to say
that we reached the sea, but we could not obtain a view of the
open ocean, although we made every endeavour to do so.
Leaving Carpentaria?Flour, 83 lbs.; pork, 3 lbs.; D. meat,
35 lbs.; biscuits, 12 lbs.; rice, 12 lbs.; sugar, 10 lbs. [Page
15 blank.] ?Return party from Carpentaria arrived here last
night, and found that the D. party had started on the same day.
We proceed slowly down the creek towards Adelaide by Mount
Hopeless, and shall endeavour to follow Gregory?s track, but we
are very weak, the camels are done up, and we shall not be able to
travel faster than 5 miles a day at most. Gray died on the road
from hunger and fatigue. We all suffered much from hunger, but
the provisions left here will, I think, restore our strength. We
have discovered a practicable route to Carpentaria, the principal
portion of which lies in the 140 th meridian of east longitude.
Between this and the Stony Desert there is some good country;
to the tropic the country is dry and stony; between the tropic
and Carpentaria a considerable portion is rangy, but it is well
watered and richly grassed.

Journal of Trip from Cooper s Creek towards Adelaide, April, 1861.
(Transcribed by Mr. Archer.)
The advance party of the Victorian Exploring Expedition,
consisting of Burke, Wills, and King (Gray being dead), having
returned from Carpentaria on the 21st April in an exhausted and
weak state, and finding that the depot party left at Cooper?s Creek
had started for the Darling, with their horses and camels fresh and
in good condition, deemed it useless to attempt to overtake them,
having only two camels, both done up, and being so weak them-
selves as to be unable to walk more than 4 or 5 miles a day;
finding also that the provisions left at the depot for them would
scarcely take them to Menindie, started down Cooper?s Creek lor
Adelaide, via Mount Hopeless, on the morning of the 23rd April,
intending to follow as nearly as possible the route taken by


Gregory; by so doing they hope to be able to recruit themselves
and the camels whilst sauntering slowly down the creek, and to
have sufficient provisions left to take them comfortably, or at least
without rilk, to some station in South Australia. Their equip-
ment consists of the following articles:?flour, 501b5.; sugar,
60 lbs.; rice, 20 lbs.; oatmeal, 60 lbs.; jerked meat, 25 lbs.;
ginger, 2 lbs.; salt, I lb.
[Then follow some native words, with their meanings.]
Tuesdag, April 23, from Depot.?Having collected together all
the odds and ends that seemed likely to be of use to us, in addition
to provisions left in the plant, we started at a quarter past nine
a.m., keeping down the southern bank of the creek. We only
went about 5 miles, and camped at half-past eleven on a billibong,
where the feed was pretty good. We find the change of diet
already making a great improvement in our spirits and strength.
The weather is delightful, days agreeably warm, but the nights
very chilly. The latter is more noticeable from our deficiency in
clothing, the depot party having taken all the reserve things back
with them to the Darling. To Camp 1.
Wednesday , April 24, from Camp I.?As we were about to
start this morning some blacks came by, from whom we were fortu-
nate enough to get 12 lbs. of fish for a few pieces of straps and
some matches, &c. This is a great treat for us, as well as a valu-
able addition to our rations. We started at a quarter past eight
p.m., on our way down the creek, the blacks going in the opposite
direction, little thinking that in a few miles they would be able to
get lots of pieces for nothing, better than those they had obtained
from us. To Camp 2.
Thursday , April 25, from Camp 2.?Awoke at five o?clock, after
a most refreshing night?s rest. The sky was beautifully clear, and
the air rather chilly. The terrestrial radiation seems to have been
considerable, and a slight dew had fallen. We had scarcely
finished breakfast when our friends the blacks, from whom we
obtained the fish, made their appearance with a few more, and
seemed inclined to go with us and keep up the supply. We gave
them some sugar, with which they were greatly pleased. They
are by far the most well-behaved blacks we have seen on Cooper?s
Creek. We did not get away from the camp until half-past nine
A.M., continuing our course down the most southern branch of the
creek, which keeps a general south-west course. We passed across
the stony point which abuts on one of the largest water-holes in the
creek, and camped at half-past twelve about a mile below the most
dangerous part of the rocky path. At this latter place we had an
accident, that might have resulted badly for us. One of the
camels fell while crossing the worst part, but we fortunately got
him out with only a few cuts and bruises. The water-hole at this


camp is a very fine one, being (to Camp 3) several miles long, and
on an average about * chains broad. The waterfowl are nume-
rous, but rather shy?not nearly so much so, however, as those on
the creeks between here and Carpentaria-; and I am convinced that
the shyness of the latter, which was also remarked by Sturt, on his
trip to Eyre?s Creek, arises entirely from the scarcity of
both human and otherwise, and not from any peculiar mode of
catching them that the blacks may have.
Friday , April 26, from Camp 3?Last night was beautifully
calm, and comparatively warm, although the sky was very clear.
Reloaded the camels by moonlight this morning, and started at a
quarter to six. Striking off to the south of the creek, we soon got
on a native path, which leaves the creek just below the stony
ground, and takes a course nearly west across a piece of open
country, bounded on the south by sand-ridges, and on the north
by the scrubby ground which flanks the bank of the creek at this
part of its course. Leaving the path on the right at a distance of
3 miles, we turned up a small creek which passes down between
some sand-hills; and, finding a nice patch of feed for the camels
at a water-hole, we halted at fifteen minutes past seven for break-
fast. We started again at fifty minutes past nine A. M. Continuing
our westerly course along the path, we crossed to the south of the
watercourse above the water, and proceeded over the most splendid
salt-bush country that one could wish to see, bounded on the left
by sandhills, whilst to the right the peculiar looking flat-topped
sandstone ranges form an extensive amphitheatre, through the far
side of the arena of which may be traced the dark line of creek-
timber. At twelve o?clock we camped in the bed of the creek, at
Camp* our last camp on the road down from the Gulf, having
taken four days to do what we then did in one. dhis comparative
rest and the change in diet have also worked wonders, however;
the leg-tied feeling is now entirely gone, and I believe that in less
than a week we shall be fit to undergo any fatigue whatever. The
camels are improving, and seem capable of doing all that we are
likely to require of them. To Camp 4.
Saturday , April 27.?First part of night clear, with a light
breeze from south. Temperature at midnight, 10� (Reaumur);
towards morning there were a few cir. cum. clouds passing over
north-east to south-west, but these disappeared before daylight;
at five a.m. the temperature was 7*s� (Reaumur). We started at
six o?clock, and, following the native path?which at about a mile
from our camp takes a southerly direction ?we soon came to the
high sandy alluvial deposit, which separates the creek at this point
from the stony rises. Here we struck off from the path, keeping
* Blank in ms.


well to the south of the creek, in order that we might mess in a
branch of it that took a southerly direction. At twenty minutes
past nine we came in on the creek again where it runs due south,
and halted for breakfast at a fine water-hole, with fine fresh feed
for the camels. Here we remained until noon, when we moved on
again, and camped at one o?clock on a general course, having been
throughout the morning south-west 8 miles. The weather is most
agreeable and pleasant; nothing could be more favourable to us
up to the present time. The temperature in the shade at half-
past ten a.m. was 17'5� (Reaumur), with a light breeze from south,
and a few small cir.-cum. clouds towards the north. I greatly feel
the want of more instruments, the only things I have left being
my watch, prism-compass, pocket-compass, and one thermometer
(Reaumur). To Camp 5.
Sunday , April 28, from Camp s.?Morning fine and calm, but
rather chilly. Started at a quarter to five A.M., following down the
bed of a creek in a westerly direction, by moonlight. Our stage
was, however, very short; for about a mile one of the camels
(Linda) got bogged by the side of a water-hole, and although we
tried every means in our power, we found it impossible to get him
out. All the ground beneath the surface was a bottomless quick-
sand, through which the beast sank too rapidly for us to get bushes
or timber fairly beneath him ; and, being of a very sluggish, stupid
nature, he could never be got to make sufficiently strenuous efforts
towards extricating himself. In the evening, as a last chance, we
let the water in from the creek, so as to buoy him up, and at the
same time soften the ground about his legs; but it was of no avail.
The brute lay quietly in it, as if he quite enjoyed his position. To
Camp 6.
Monday , April 29, from Camp 6.?Finding Linda still in the
hole, we made a few attempts at extricating him, and then shot
him, and after breakfast commenced cutting off what flesh we could
get at for jerking.
Tuesday , April 30, Camp 6.?Remained here to-day, for the
purpose of drying the meat, for which process the weather is not
very favourable, [Meteorological note follows.]
Wednesday , May 1, from Camp 6.?Started at twenty minutes
to nine, having loaded our only camel, Rajah, with the most neces-
sary and useful articles, and packed up a small swag each of
bedding and clothing for our own shoulders. We kept on the
right bank of the creek for about a mile, and then crossed over at
a native camp to the left, where we got on a path running due
west, the creek having turned to the north. Following the path,
we crossed an open plain, and then sand-ridges, whence we saw the
creek straight ahead of us, running nearly south again. The path
took us to the southernmost point of the bend, in a distance of


about 2� miles from where we had crossed the creek; thereby
saving us from 3 to 4 miles, as it cannot be less than 6 miles round
by the creek. To Camp 7.
Thursday , May 2, Camp 7.?Breakfasted by moonlight, and
started at half-past six. Following down the left bank of the
creek in a westerly direction, we came, at a distance of 6 miles, on
a lot of natives, who were camped on the bed of a creek. They
seemed to have just breakfasted, and were most liberal in the
presentations of fish and cake. We could only return the compli-
ment by some fish-hooks and sugar. About a mile farther on we
came to a separation of the creek, where what looked like the main
branch looked towards the south. This channel we followed; not,
however, without some misgivings as to its character, which were
soon increased by the small and unfavourable appearance that the
creek assumed. On our continuing along it a little farther it
began to improve, and widened out with fine water-holes of con-
siderable depth. The banks were very steep, and a belt of scrub
lined it on either side. This made it very inconvenient for tra-
velling, especially as the bed of the creek was full of water for a
considerable distance. At eleven a.m. we halted until half-past
one p.m., and then moved on again, taking a s.s.w. course for about
2 miles; when, at the end of a very long water-hole, it breaks into
billibongs, which continue splitting into sandy channels until they
are all lost in the earthy soil of a box-forest. Seeing little chance of
water ahead, we turned back to the end of the long water-hole, and
camped for the night. On our way back Kajah showed signs of
being done up. He had been trembling greatly all the morning.
On this account his load was further lightened to the amount of a
few pounds, by doing away with the sugar, ginger, tea, cocoa, and
two or three tin plates. To Camp 8.
Friday, May 3, Camp B.? Started at 7 a.m., striking off in a
northerly direction for the main creek. At mile came to a
branch which [left unfinished.] To Camp 9.
Saturday , May 4, Junction from Camp 9.?Night and morning
very cold. Sky clear, almost calm ; occasionally a light breath of
air from south. Rajah appears to feel the cold very much. He
was so stiff this morning as to be scarcely able to get up with his
load. Started to return down the creek at 6*45, and halted for
breakfast at 9 a.m., at the same spot as we breakfasted at yester-
day. Proceeding ? from there down the creek, we soon found a
repetition of the features that were exhibited by the creek exa-
mined on Thursday. At 14 mile we came to the last water-hole,
and below that the channel became more sandy and shallow, and
continued to send off billibongs to the south and west, slightly
changing its course each time, until it disappeared altogether in a
north-westerly direction. Leaving King with the camel, we went


on a mile or two to see if we could find water; and, being unsuc-
cessful, we were obliged to return to where we had breakfasted, as
being the best place for feed and water.
Sunday , May 5, to Camp 10.?Started by myself to recon-
noitre the country in a southerly direction, leaving Mr. Burke and
King with the camel at Camp 10. Travelled south-west by south
for two hours, following the course of the most southerly billi-
bongs. Found the earthy soil becoming more loose and cracked
up, and the box-track gradually disappearing. Changed course
to west, for a high sand-ridge, which 1 reached in one hour and
a half; and, continuing in the same direction to one still higher,
obtained from it a good view of the surrounding country. To the
north were the extensive box-forests, bounding the creek on either
side; to the east, earthy plains, intersected by watercourses and
lines of timber, and bounded in the distance by sand-ridges; to the
south, the projection of the sand-ridge partially intercepted the
view; the rest was composed of earthy plains, apparently clothed
with chrysanthemums; to the westward, another but smaller plain
was bounded also by high sand-ridges, running parallel with the
one on which I was standing. This dreary prospect offering no
encouragement for one to proceed, I returned to Camp 10 by a
more direct and better route than I had come, passing over some
good salt-bush land which borders on the billibongs to the west-
ward. [Here follow some meteorological notes.]
Monday , May 6, from Camp 10 back to Camp 9.?Moved up
the creek again to Camp 9, at the junction, to breakfast, and
remained the day there. The present state of things is not calcu-
lated to raise our spirits much. The rations are rapidly dimi-
nishing ; our clothing, especially the boots, are all going to pieces,
and we have not the materials for repairing them properly. The
camel is completely done up, and can scarcely get along, although
he has the best of feed, and is resting half his time. I suppose
this will end in our having to live like the blacks for a few months.
Tuesday , May 7, Camp 9. ?Breakfasted at daylight; but when
about to start, found that the camel would not rise, even without
any load on his back. After making every attempt to get him up,
we were obliged to leave him to himself. Mr, Burke and I started
down the creek to reconnoitre. At about 11 miles we came to
some blacks fishing. They gave us some half-a-dozen fish each for
luncheon, and intimated that if we would go to their camp we
should have some more, and some bread. I tore in two a piece
of macintosh-stuff that I had, and Mr. Burke gave one piece, and
I the other. We then went on to their camp, about 3 miles
farther. They had caught a considerable quantity of fish, but
most of them were small. I noticed three different kinds?a
small one, that they call cupi, 5 to 6 inches long, and not broader


than an eel; the common one, with large coarse scales, termed
pern; and a delicious fish, some of which run from 1 pound to 2
pounds? weight?the natives call them cawilchi. On our arrival
at the camp they led us to a spot to camp, on, and soon afterwards
brought a lot of fish and bread, which they call nardoo. The
lighting a fire with matches delights them, but they do not care
about having them. In the evening various members of the tribe
came down with lumps of nardoo and handfuls ot fish, until we
were positively unable to eat any more. They also gave us some
stuff they call bedgery, or pedgery. It has a highly intoxicating
effect when chewed even in small quantities. It appears to be the
dried stems and leaves of some shrub.
Wednesday, May B.?Left the blacks? camp at half-past seven,
Mr. Burke returning to the junction, whilst I proceeded to trace
down the creek. This I found a shorter task than I had expected,
for it soon showed signs of running out, and at the same time kept
considerably to the north of west. There were several fine water-
holes within about 4 miles of the camp I had left, but not a drop
all the way beyond that, a distance of 7 miles. Finding that the
creek turned greatly towards the north, I returned to the blacks?
encampment; and, as I was about to pass, they invited me to stay.
I did so, and was even more hospitably entertained than before,
being on this occasion offered a share of a gunyah, and supplied
with plenty of fish and nardoo, as well as a couple of nice fat rats.
The latter found most delicious. They were baked in the skins.
Last night was clear and calm, but unusually warm. We slept by
a fire, just in front of the blacks? camp. They were very attentive
in bringing us firewood, and keeping fire up during the night.
Thursday , May 9. ?Parted from my friends the blacks at
half-past seven, and started for Camp 9.
Friday , May 10, Camp 9. ?Mr. Burke and King employed in
jerking the camel?s flesh, whilst I went out to look for the nardoo-
seed for making bread. In this I was unsuccessful, not being able
to find a single tree of it in the neighbourhood of the camp. I,
however, tried boiling the large kind of bean which the blacks call
padlu; they boil easily, and when shelled are very sweet, much
resembling in taste the French chesnut. They are to be found in
large quantities nearly everywhere.
Saturday , May 11, Camp 9.?To-day Mr. Burke and King
started down the creek for the blacks? camp, determined to ascer-
tain all particulars about the nardoo-seed. I have now my turn at
the meat-jerking, and must devise some means for trapping the
birds and rats, which is a pleasant prospect after our dashing trip
to Carpentaria, having to hang about Cooper?s Creek, living like
the blacks.


Sunday , May 12.?Mr. Burke and King returned this
having been unsuccessful in their search for the blacks, who, It
seems, have moved over to the other branch of the creek. Decided
on moving out on the main creek to-morrow, and then trying to
find the natives of the creek.
Monday , May 13.?Shifted some of the things and brought
them back again ; Mr. Burke thinking it better for one to remain
here with them for a few days, so as to eat the remains of the
fresh meat, whilst the others went in search of the blacks and
nardoo.
Tuesday , May 14.?Mr. Burke and King gone up the creek
to look for blacks, with four days? provisions. Self employed in
preparing for a final start on their return. This evening Mr.
Burke and King returned, having been some considerable distance
up the creek, and found no blacks. It is now settled that we
plant the things, and all start together the day after to-morrow.
The weather continues very fine; the nights calm, clear, and cold,
and the days clear, with a breeze generally from south, but to-day
from east, for a change. This makes the first part of the day
rather cold. When clouds appear they invariably move from west
to east.
Wednesday , May 15. Camp 9. Planting the things, and
preparing to leave the creek for Mount Hopeless.
Thursday , May 16.?Having completed our planting, &c.,
started up the creek to the second blacks? camp, a distance of
about eight miles. Finding our loads rather too heavy, we made
a small plant here of such articles as could best be spared.
[Here follow a few meteorological notes.]
Friday, May 17, Nardoo.?Started this morning on a blacks?
path, leaving the creek on our left, our intention being to keep a
south-easterly direction until we should cut some likely-looking
creek, and then to follow it down. On approaching the foot of
the first sandhill, King caught sight in the flat of some nardoo-
seeds, and we soon found that the flat was covered with them.
This discovery caused somewhat of a revolution in our feelings, for
we considered that with the knowledge of this plant we were in a
position to support ourselves, even if we were destined to remain
on the creek and wait for assistance from town. Crossing some
sand-ridges running north and south, we struck into a creek which
runs out of Cooper?s Creek, and followed it down. At about five
miles we came to a large water-hole, beyond which the water-
course runs out on extensive flats and earthy plains. Calm night;
sky cleared towards morning, and it became very cold. A slight
easterly breeze sprang up at sunrise, but soon died away again.
The sky again became overcast, and remained so throughout the


day. There was occasionally a light breeze from south, but
during the greater portion of the day it was quite calm. Fine
halo around the sun in the afternoon.
Saturday, May 18, Camp 16.?[No entry except the following
meteorological entry on an opposite page, which may probably
refer to this date.] Calm night, sky sometimes clear and some-
times partially overcast with veil-clouds.

Thursday, May 23. ?[No entry beyond this citation of date.]
Friday , May 24.?Started with King to celebrate the Queen?s
birthday by fetching from Nardoo Creek what is now to us the
staff of life. Returned at a little after two P.M., with a fair supply,
but find the collecting of the seed a slower and more troublesome
process than could be desired. Whilst picking the seed, about
eleven o?clock a m., both of us heard distinctly the noise of an
explosion, as if of a gun, at some considerable distance. We
supposed it to have been a shot fired by Mr. Burke; but on
returning to the camp, found that he had not fired nor heard the
noise. The sky was partially overcast with high cum.-str. clouds,
and a light breeze blew from the east, but nothing to indicate a
thunderstorm in any direction.
Saturday, May 25. ?[No entry beyond this.]
Sunday, May 26.?[No entry beyond this.]
Monday, May 27.?Started up the creek this morning for the
depot, in order to deposit journals and a record of the state of
affairs here. On reaching the sandhills below where Landa was
bogged, I passed some blacks on a flat collecting nardoo-seed.
Never saw such an abundance of the seed before. The ground in
some parts was quite black with it. There were only two or three
gins and children, and they directed me on, as if to their camp, in
the direction I was before going; but I had not gone far over the
first sandhill when I was overtaken by about twenty blacks, bent
on taking me back to their camp, and promising any quantity of
nardoo and fish. On my going with them, one carried the shovel,
and another insisted on taking my swag, in such a friendly manner
that I could not refuse them. They were greatly amused with
the various little things I had with me. In the evening they
supplied me with abundance of nardoo and fish ; and one of the
old men, Poko Tinnamira, shared his gunyah with me. . . . The
night was very cold, but, by the help of several fires?[The entry


suddenly stops, but in the margin of the opposite page are written
the names of several natives, and certain native words, with their
meanings in English.]
Tuesday , May 28.?Left the blacks? camp, and proceeded up
the creek. Obtained some mussels near where Landa died, and
halted for breakfast. Still feel very unwell from the effects of the
constipation of the bowels. The stools are exceedingly painful.
After breakfast travelled on to our third camp coming down.
Buy to Blowr [sic].
Wednesday , May 29.?Started at seven o?clock, and went on to
the duck-holes, where we breakfasted coming down. Halted
there at thirty minutes past nine for a feed, and then moved on.
At the stones saw a lot of crows quarrelling about something near
the water. Found it to be a large fish, of wdiich they had eaten a
considerable portion. Finding it quite fresh and good, I decided
the quarrel by taking it with me. It proved a most valuable
addition to my otherwise scanty supper of nardoo-porridge. This
evening I camped very comfortably in a mia-mia, about eleven
miles from the depot The night was very cold, although not
entirely cloudless. A brisk easterly breeze sprang up in the
morning, and blew freshly all day. In the evening the sky
clouded in, and there were one or two slight showers, but nothing
to wet the ground.
Thursday , May 30.?Reached the depot this morning, at eleven
o?clock. No traces of any one, except blacks, having been here
since we left. Deposited some journals, and a notice of our
present condition. Started back in the afternoon, and camped at
the first water-hole. Last night being cloudy, was unusually
warm and pleasant.
Friday , May 31.?Decamped at thirty minutes past seven,
having first breakfasted. Passed between the sandhills at nine,
and reached the blanket mia-mias at twenty minutes to eleven;
from there proceeded on to the rocks, where I arrived at half-past
one, having delayed about half-an-hour on the road in gathering
some portulac. It had been a fine morning, but the sky now
became overcast, and threatened to set in for a steady rain ; and
as I felt very weak and tired, I only moved on about a mile
farther, and camped in a sheltered gully, under some bushes.
Night clear and very cold. No wind. Towards morning sky
became slightly overcast with cirro-str. clouds.
Saturday , June 1. ?Started at a quarter to eight a.m. Passed
the duck-holes at ten a.m., and my second camp up at two p.m.,
having rested in the mean time about forty-five minutes. Thought
to have reached the blacks? camp, or at least where Landa was
bogged, but found myself altogether too weak and exhausted ;in


fact, had extreme difficulty in getting across the numerous little
gullies, and was at last obliged to camp from sheer fatigue.
Night alternately clear and cloudy, with occasional showers
Sunday, June 2.?Started at half-past six, thinking to break-
fast at the blacks? camp, below Landa?s grave ; found myself very
much fagged, and did not arrive at their camp until ten A.M., and
then found myself disappointed as to a good breakfast, the camp
being deserted. Having rested awhile, and eaten a few fish-bones,
I moved down the creek, hoping by a late march to be able to
reach our own camp, but I soon found, from my extreme weakness,
that that would be out of the question. A certain amount of
good luck, however, still stuck to me, for, on going along by a
large water-hole, I was so fortunate as to find a large fish, about a
pound and a-half in weight, which was just being choked by
another which it had tried to swallow, but which had stuck in its
throat. I soon had a fire lit, and both of the fish cooked and
eaten. The large one was in good condition. Moving on again
after ray late breakfast, I passed Camp 67 of the journey to
Carpentaria, and camped for the night under some polygonum-
bushes.
Monday , June 3.?Started at seven o?clock, and, keeping on
the south bank of the creek, was rather encouraged, at about three
miles, by the sound of numerous crows a-head ; presently, fancied
I could see smoke, and was shortly afterwards set at my ease by
hearing a cooey from Pitchery, who stood on the opposite hank,
and directed me around the lower end of the water-hole, continually
repeating his assurance of abundance of fish and bread. Having
with some considerable difficulty managed to ascend the sandy
path that led to the camp, I was conducted by the chief to a fire,
where a large pile of fish were just being cooked in the most
approved style. These I imagined to be for the general consump-
tion of the half-a-dozen natives gathered around, but it turned
out that they had already had their breakfast. I was expected to
dispose of this lot?a task which, to my own astonishment, I soon
accomplished, keeping two or three blacks pretty steadily at work
extracting the bones for me. The fish being disposed of, next
came a supply of nardoo-cake and water, until I was so full as to
be unable to eat any more, when Pitchery allowing me a short
time to recover myself, fetched a large bowl of the raw nardoo-
flour, mixed to a thin paste ?a most insinuating article, and one
that they appear to esteem a great delicacy. I was then invited
to stop the night there, but this I declined, and proceeded on my
way home.
Tuesday , June 4.?Started for the blacks? camp, intending to
test the practicability of living with them, and to see what I could
learn as to their ways and manners.

Wednesday, Jane 5. Remained with the blacks. Light rain
during the greater part of the night, and more or less throughout
the day, in showers. Wind blowing in squalls from south.
Thursday, Jane 6.?Returned to our own camp; found that
Mr. Burke and King had been well supplied with fish by the
blacks. Made preparation for shifting our camp nearer to theirs
on the morrow. ini?
Friday, Jane 7.?Started in the afternoon for the blacks camp,
with such things as we could take ; found ourselves all very weak,
in spite of the abundant supply of fish that we have lately had.
I myself could scarcely get along, although carrying the lightest
swa g ?only about thirty pounds. Found that the blacks had
decamped, so determined on proceeding to-morrow up to the next
camp, near the nardoo-field. > ,
Saturday, June B.?With the greatest fatigue and difficulty
we reached the nardoo-camp. No blacks, greatly to our disappoint-
ment. Took possession of the best mia-mia, and rested lor the
remainder of the day.
Sunday , Jane 9.?King and I proceeded to collect nardoo,
leaving Mr. Burke at home.
Monday, June 10.?Mr. Burke and King collecting nardoo;
self at home, too weak to go out. Was fortunate enough to shoot
a crow.
[Here follow some meteorological notes, which appear to relate
to another period,] _ , ,
Tuesday , June 11.?King out for nardoo. Mr. Burke up the
creek to look for the blacks,
Wednesday, June 12.?King out collecting nardoo. Mr. Burke
and lat home, pounding and cleaning. I still feel myself, if any-
thing, weaker in the legs, although the nardoo appears to be more
thoroughly (?) digested.
Thursday, June 13.?Last night the sky was pretty clear, and
the air rather cold, but nearly calm; a few cir.-str. hung about
the north-east horizon during the first part of the night. Mr.
Burke and King out for nardoo. Self weaker than ever, scarcely
able to go to the water-hole for water. Towards afternoon cir.-
cum. and cir.-str. began to appear, moving northward ; scarcely
any wind all day.
Friday, June 14.?Night alternately clear and cloudy, cir.-
cum. and cum.-st. moving northwards; no wind, beautifully mild
for the time of year; in the morning some heavy clouds on the
horizon. King out for nardoo; brought in a good supply. Mr.
Burke and lat home, pounding and cleaning seed. I feel weaker
than ever, and both Mr. Burke and King are beginning to feel
very unsteady in the legs.
Saturday , Jane 15.?Night clear, calm, and cold; morning


very fine, with a light breath of air from north-east. King out
for nardoo ; brought in a fine supply. Mr. Burke and 1 pounding
and cleaning. He finds himself getting very weak, and lam not
a bit stronger. I have determined on beginning to chew tobacco
and eat less nardoo, in hopes that it may induce some change in
the system. I have never yet recovered from the effects of the
constipation, and the passage of the stools is always exceedingly
painful.
Sunday, June 16,?Wind shifted to north, clouds moving from
west to east; thunder audible two or three times to the south-
ward ; sky becoming densely overcast, with an occcasional shower
about nine a.m. We finished up the remains of the Rajah for
dinner yesterday. King was fortunate enough to shoot a crow
this morning. The rain kept all hands in pounding and cleaning
seed during the morning. The weather cleared up towards the
middle of the day, and a brisk breeze sprang up in the south,
lasting till near sunset, but rather irregular in its force. Distant
thunder was audible to westward and southward frequently during
the afternoon.
Monday, June 17.?Night very boisterous and stormy. North-
erly wind blowing in squalls, and heavy showers of rain with
thunder in the north and west. Heavy clouds moving rapidly
from north to south ; gradually clearing up during the morning,
the wind continuing squally during the day from west and north-
west. King out in the afternoon for nardoo.
Tuesday, June 18.?Exceedingly cold night. Sky clear, slight
breeze, very chilly and changeable; very heavy dew. After
sunrise, cir.-st. clouds began to pass over from west to east,
gradually becoming more dense, and assuming the form of cum.-st.
The sky cleared, and it became warmer towards noon.
Wednesday, June 19.?Night calm; sky during first part over-
cast with cir.-cum. clouds, most of which cleared away towards
morning, leaving the air much colder, but the sky remained more
or less hazy all night, and it was not nearly as cold as last night.
About eight o?clock a strong southerly wind sprang up, which
enabled King to blow the dust out of our nardoo-seeds, but made
me too weak to render him any assistance.
Thursday, June ?2O. ?Night and morning very cold, sky clear.
I am completely reduced by the effects of the cold and starvation.
King gone out for nardoo. Mr. Burke at home pounding seed ;
he finds himself getting very weak in the legs. King holds out
by far the best; the food seems to agree with him pretty well.
Finding the sun come out pretty warm towards noon, I took a
sponging all over, but it seemed to do little good beyond the
cleaning effects, for my weakness is so great that 1 could not do it
with proper expedition. I cannot understand this nardoo at all ;
2 k 2


it certainly will not agree with me in any form. We are now
reduced to it alone, and we manage to get from four to five
pounds per day between us. The stools it causes are enormous,
and seem greatly to exceed the quantity of bread consumed :
it is very slightly altered in appearance from what it was when
eaten.
Friday , June 21.?Last night was cold and clear, winding up
with a strong wind from north-east in the morning. I feel much
weaker than ever, and can scarcely crawl out of the mia-mia.
Unless relief comes in some form or other, I cannot possibly last
more than a fortnight. It is a great consolation, at least, in this
position of ours, to know that we have done all we could, and
that our deaths will rather be the result of the mismanagement of
others than of any rash acts of our own. Had we come to grief
elsewhere, we could only have blamed ourselves : but here we
are, returned to Cooper?s Creek, where we had every reason to
look for provisions and clothing; and yet we have to die of
starvation, in spite of the explicit instructions given by Mr. Burke,
that the depot party should await our return, and the strong
recommendation to the Committee that we should be followed up
by a party from Menindie. About noon a change of wind took
place, and it blew almost as hard from the west as it did previously
from the north-east. A few cir.-cum. continued to pass over
toward east.
Saturday , June 22.?Night cloudy and warm. Every appear-
ance of rain. Thunder once or twice during the night. Clouds
moving in an easterly direction. Lower atmosphere perfectly
calm. There were a few drops of rain during the night; and in
the morning, about 9 A.M., there was every prospect of more rain
until towards noon, when the sky cleared up for a time. Mr.
Burke and King out for nardoo. The former returned much
fatigued. lam so weak to-day as to be unable to get on my feet,
Sunday , June 23.?A1l hands at home. I am so weak as to
be incapable of crawling out of the mia-mia. King holds out
well, but Mr. Burke finds himself weaker every day.
Monday , June 24.?A fearful night. At about an hour before
sunset a southerly gale sprang up and continued throughout the
greater portion of the night; the cold was intense, and it seemed
as if one would be shrivelled up. Towards morning it fortunately
lulled a little, but a strong cold breeze continued till near sunset,
after which it became perfectly calm. King went out for nardoo,
in spite of the wind, and came in with a good load, but he himself
terribly cut up. He says that he can no longer keep up the work,
and as he and Mr. Burke are both getting rapidly weaker, we
have but a slight chance of anything but starvation, unless we can
get hold of some blacks


Tuesday, June 28 [�c]. ?Night calm, clear, and intensely
cold, especially towards morning. Near daybreak King reported
seeing a moon in the east, with a haze of light stretching up from
it: he declared it to be quite as large as the moon, and not dim at
the edges. lam so weak that any attempt to get a sight of it was
out of the question; hut I think it must have been Venus in the
zodiacal light that he saw, with a corona around her. Mr. Burke
and King remain at home cleaning and pounding seed. They
are both getting weaker every day. The cold plays the deuce
with us, from the small amount of clothing we have. My ward-
robe consists of a wide-awake, a merino shirt, a regatta-shirt with-
out sleeves, the remains of a pair of flannel trousers, two pairs of
socks in rags, and a waistcoat of which I have managed to keep
the pockets together. The others are no better off. Besides
these, we have between us, for bedding, two small camel-pads,
some horsehair, two or three little bits of rag, and pieces of oil-
cloth saved from the fire. The day turned out nice and warm.
Wednesday , June 24 [stc]. ?Calm night; sky overcast with
hazy cum.-strat. clouds. An easterly breeze sprang up towards
morning, making the air much colder. After sunrise there were
indications of a clearing up of the sky, but it soon clouded in
again, the upper current continuing to move in an easterly
direction, whilst a breeze from the east and north-east blew pretty
regularly throughout the day. Mr. Burke and King are pre-
paring to go up the creek in search of the blacks. They will
leave me some nardoo, wood and water, with which I must do the
best I can until they return. I think this is almost our only
chance. I feel myself, if anything, rather better, but I cannot
say stronger. The nardoo is beginning to agree better with me ;
but without some change I see little chance for any of us. They
have both shown great hesitation and reluctance with regard to
leaving me, and have repeatedly desired my candid opinion in the
matter. I could only repeat, however, that I considered it our
only chance, for I could not last long on the nardoo, even if a
supply could be kept up.
Thursday , June 25 [sic]. ?Cloudy, calm, and comparatively
warm night, clouds almost stationary. In the morning a gentle
breeze from east. Sky partially cleared up during the day,
making it pleasantly warm and bright; it remained clear during
the afternoon and evening, offering every prospect of a clear cold
night.
Friday, June 26 [sic]. ?Clear cold night, slight breeze from
the east, day beautifully warm and pleasant; Mr. Burke suffers
greatly from the cold, and is getting extremely weak; he and
King start to-morrow up the creek to look for the blacks: it is the
only chance we have of being saved from starvation. lam weaker


than ever [sic], although I have a good appetite and relish the
nardoo much, but it seems to give us no nutriment, and the birds
here are so shy as not to be got at. Even if we got a good supply
of fish, I doubt whether we could do much work on them and the
nardoo alone. Nothing now hut the greatest good luck can save
any of us; and as for myself, I may live four or five days if the
weather continues warm. My pulse is at forty-eight, and very
weak, and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can
only look out, like Mr. Micawber, ? for something to turn up; ?
but starvation on nardoo is by no means very unpleasant, but for
the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for,
as far as appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.
Certainly, fat and sugar would be more to one?s taste: in fact,
those seem to me to be the great stand by for one in this extra-
ordinary Continent; not that I mean to depreciate the farinaceous
food, but the want of sugar and fat in all substances obtainable
here is so great that they become almost valueless to us as articles
of food, without the addition of something else.

[ln the last four days it will be observed that the dates are wrongly stated.
Doubtless the melancholy situation of the party had in some degree affected
the writer. The journal was kept in a note-book which was completely filled
up, the signature being attached at the bottom of the last page. The journal
closes on the 27th June; and about four days afterwards, King having left
Burke dead on the route, returned to the hut and found that Wills also had
expired.]
Mr. Wills's Astronomical Observations on his Beturn from Carpentaria
to Cooper's Greelt.
These observations consist of a series of sextant measures, for latitude,
chronometer errors, and lunar distances, with two observations of the eclipses
of Jupiter s satellites. The latitude observations I think were all approxi-
mately computed by himself, for the positions of the camps as laid down on
his chart correspond very closely in that respect with those that have since
been computed carefully from his observations. But, as regards the longitude,
his chart positions I believe to be ? by account,? or ? dead reckoning.?
As the question of the longitude at which the Expedition reached the
northern part of the continent is a matter of considerable interest and im-
portance, the few observations available for the determination have been
very rigorously computed, especially as, although they appear to have been
made with every care possible, their results differ considerably from the
plotted track at the northern portion of the journey, and appear somewhat
anomalous.
It is especially fortunate that on the dates on which Mr, Wills made his
lunar observations, the moon?s places were obtained both at the Greenwich and
the Williamstown observatories (having received observations made at Green-
wich by last mail), enabling me to correct the observations for errors of the
? Nautical Almanac ? which at two of the camps would have made his longi-
tude from 20 to 30 miles east of where they really were. Subjoined are the
positions of the camps at which longitude observations were made, deduced


from the observations. At all the other return camps, observations for latitude
only were obtained, and their positions in that particular are laid down with
sufficient accuracy on Mr. Wills?s chart: ?

Memorandum for the information of His Excellency Sir H. Bar My.
It will be seen that Mr. Wills did not reduce his observations for Longitude,
or he would not have plotted his route on the Exploitation Chart, forwarded
herewith, in the way he has done, at Camp 3 (11.) Return, This Camp, by
the reduction of his observations at the Williamstown Observatory, would be
very much to the eastward of his route, as plotted by himself, 24 miles and
12 seconds. But your Excellency will be pleased to learn that the differences
between his own Map and the Astronomical Observations, as reduced at the
Williamstown Observatory, are reduced to miles at the Northern extremity
of the route at the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and leave no reasonable
doubt as to its having been Flinders River which the Exploration reached.

Instructions to Leader.
Exploration Committee, Royal Society of Victoria,
Melbourne, 18th August, 1860.
Sir, ? I am directed by the Committee to convey to you the instructions and
views which have been adopted in connection with the duties which devolve
upon you as Leader of the party now organized to explore the interior of
Australia.
The Committee having decided upon Cooper?s Creek, of Sturt?s, as the basis
of your operations, request that you will proceed thither, form a depot of pro-
visions and stores, and make arrangements for keeping open a communication
in your rear to the Darling, if in your opinion advisable ; and thence to
Melbourne, so that you may be enabled to keep the Committee informed of
your movements, and receive in return the assistance in stores and advice of
which you may stand in need. Should you find that a better communication
can be made by way of the South Australian Police Station, near Mount
Serle, you will avail yourself of that means of writing to the Committee.
In your route to Cooper?s Creek, you will avail yourself of any opportunity
that may present itself for examining and reporting on the character of the
country east and west of the Darling.
You will make arrangements for carrying the stores to a point opposite
Mount McPherson, which seems to the Committee to be the best point of
departure from this river for Cooper?s Creek ; and while the main body of the
party is proceeding to that point you may have further opportunities of
examining the country on either side of your route.


In your further progress from Mount McPherson towards Cooper?s Creek,
the Committee also desires that you should make further detours to the right
and left with the same object.
The object of the Committee in directing you to Cooper?s Creek, is, that
you should explore the country intervening between it and Leichhardt?s track,
south of the Gulf of Carpentaria, avoiding, as far as practicable, Sturt?s route
on the west, and Gregory?s down the Victoria on the east.
To this object the Committee wishes you to devote your energies in the first
instance; but should you determine the impracticability of this route, you are
desired to turn westward into the country recently discovered by Stuart, and
connect his farthest point northward with Gregory?s farthest Southern Explo-
ration in 1856 (Mount Wilson).
In proceeding from Cooper?s Creeek to Stuart?s Country, you may find the
Salt Marshes an obstacle to the progress of the camels ; if so, it is supposed
you will be able to avoid these marshes by turning to the northward as far as
Eyre?s Creek, where there is permanent water, and going then westward to
Stuart?s farthest.
Should you, however, fail in connecting the two points of Stuart?s and
Gregory?s farthest, or should you ascertain that this space has been already
traversed, you are requested if possible to connect your explorations with
those of the younger Gregory, in the vicinity of Mount Gould, and thence you
might proceed to Sharks? Bay, or down the river Murchison to the settlements
in Western Australia.
This country would afford the means of recruiting the strength of your
party, and you might, after a delay of five or six months, be enabled, with the
knowledge of the country you shall have previously acquired, to return by a
more direct route through South Australia to Melbourne.
If you should, however, have been successful in connecting Stuart?s with
Gregory?s farthest point in 1856 (Mount Wilson), and your party should be
equal to the task, you would probably find it possible from thence to reach the
country discovered by the younger Gregory.
The Committee is fully aware of the difficulty of the country you are called
on to traverse, and in giving you these instructions has placed these routes
before you more as an indication of what it has been deemed desirable to have
accomplished than as indicating any exact course for you to pursue.
The Committee considers you will find a better and a safer guide in the
natural features of the country through which you will have to pass. For all
useful and practical purposes it will better be for you and the object of
future settlement that you should follow the watercourses and the country
yielding herbage, than pursue any route which the Committee might be able
to sketch out from an imperfect map of Australia.
The Committee intrust you with the largest discretion as regards the forming
of depots, and your movements generally, but request that you will mark
your routes as permanently as possible, by leaving records, sowing seeds,
building cairns, and marking trees at as many points as possible, consistently

Mr. Burke's Despatch from Torowotto.
(Received 3rd December, I860.)
Torowotto, October 29th, 1860.
Sir, ? I have the honour to report that I left Menindie on the 19th instant,
with the party as per margin and Mr, Wright, who had kindly volunteered to
show me a practicable route towards Cooper?s Creek, for a distance of a
hundred miles from the Darling; and he has more than fulfilled his promise,
for we have now travelled for upwards of two hundred miles, generally
through a fine sheep-grazing country, and we have not had any difficulty
about water, as we found creeks or water-holes, many of them having every
appearance of being permanent water, at distances never exceeding twenty
miles. Mr. Wills?s report, herewith forwarded, gives all the necessary details.
Although travelling at the rate of twenty miles a day, the horses and camels
have all improved in condition, and the country improves as we go on.
Yesterday, from Wannaminta to Raldromatta Creek, we travelled over a
splendid grazing country, and to-day we are encamped on a creek or swamp,
the banks of which are very well grassed and good feed all the way from our
last camp (44), except for two miles, and here the ground was barren and
swampy. Of course it is impossible for me to say what effect an unusually
dry summer would produce throughout this country, or whether we are now
travelling in an unusually favourable season or not. I describe things as I
find them.
Mr. Wright returns from here to Menindie. I informed him that I should
consider him third officer of the expedition, subject to the approval of the
Committee, from the day of our departure from Menindie, and I hope that they
will confirm the appointment. In the mean time I have instructed him to
follow me up with the remainder of the camels to Cooper?s Creek, to take
steps to procure a supply of jerked meat, apd I have written to the doctor to
inform him that I have accepted his resignation, as, although I was anxious to
await the decision of the Committee, the circumstances will not admit of
delay, and he has positively refused to leave the settled districts. I am
willing to admit that he did his best, until his fears for the safety of the party
overcame him ; but those fears, I think, clearly show how unfit he is for his
post. If Mr. Wright is allowed to follow out the instructions I have given
him, I am confident that the result will be satisfactory ; and if the Committee


think proper to make inquiries with regard to him, they will find that he is
well qualified for his post, and that he bears the very highest character. I
shall proceed on from here to Cooper?s Creek: 1 may or may not be able to
send back from there until we are followed up. Perhaps it would not be
prudent to divide the party: the natives here have told Mr. Wright that we
shall meet with opposition on our way there. Perhaps I might find it
advisable to leave a depot at Cooper?s Creek, and to go on with a small party
to examine the country beyond it: under any circumstances it. is desirable
that we should be soon followed up. I consider myself very fortunate in
having Mr. Wills as my second in command; he is a capital officer, zealous
and untiring in the performance of his duties, and I trust that he will remain
my second as long as lam in charge of the expedition. The men all conduct
themselves admirably, and they are all most anxious to go on ; but the
Committee may rely upon it that I shall go on steadily and carefully, and
that I shall endeavour not to lose a chance or to run any unnecessary risk.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
E. O?Hara Burke, Leader.
P. S.?The two blacks and four horses go back with Mr. Wright.
Dr. Macadam, Secretary.
Mr. Burke's Despatch from Cooper's Creels.
(Received 30tli June, 1861.)
Cooper?s Creek, 13th December, 1860.
Sin, ?I have the honour to report that the expedition under my command
left Torowotto on the 31st of October, and arrived at Cooper?s Creek on the
11th November, men, horses, and camels well. The road from Torowotto to
Wright?s Creek is good, but from Wright?s Creek to the point where we
struck Cooper?s Creek it is in some places very stony, although not by any
means impracticable. From the 11th of November we travelled slowly down
the creek until the 20th of November, in order to recruit the strength of the
animals. On the 20th we arrived at what I considered to be an eligible spot
for the depot, and we remained there (Camp 63) until the sth instant, when
we were driven out by the rats, and obliged to remove lower down, to the
place from whence I now write (Camp 65), and where I have permanently
established the depot.
The feed upon this creek is good, and the horses and camels have greatly
improved in condition ; but the flies, mosquitoes, and rats which abound here
render it a very disagreeable summer residence.
From Camp 63 we made frequent excursions in order to endeavour (in
accordance with instructions) to find a practicable route northward, between
Gregory?s and Sturt?s track, but without success. Mr. Wills, upon one occasion,
travelled ninety miles to the north without finding water, when his camels
escaped, and he and the man who accompanied him were obliged to return on
foot, which they accomplished in forty-eight hours. Fortunately upon their
return they found a pool of water. The three camels have not yet been
recovered.
I am satisfied that a practicable route cannot be established in that
direction, except during the rainy season, or by sinking wells, as the natives
have evidently lately abandoned that part of the country for want of water,
which is shown by their having sunk for water in all directions in the beds of
the creeks.
I also think that it would be very desirable to establish the route to
Cooper?s Creek, and from Cooper?s Creek to the north farther to the westward,


as the eastern, or upper part of the creek, up to Camp 63, runs through earthy
plains, which even now, in fine weather, are very difficult to travel over ; but
in winter, or during wet weather, they must be quite impassable for horses
and cattle.
I have therefore left instructions for the' officer in charge of the parly,
which I expect will shortly arrive here, to endeavour during my absence to
find a better and shorter route between the depot (Camp 65) and Wright?s
Creek, or between the depot and the Darling. I proceed on to-morrow with
the party as per margin to Eyre?s Creek, and from thence I shall endeavour to
explore the country to the north of it, in the direction of Carpentaria; and it
is my intention to return here within the next three months at latest.
I shall leave the party which remain here under the charge of Mr. Brahe, in
whom I have every confidence. The feed is very good ; there is no danger to
be apprehended from the natives, if they are properly managed ; and there is,
therefore, nothing to prevent the party remaining here until our return, or
until their provisions run short.
I did not intend to start so soon, but we have had some severe thunder
storms lately, with every appearance of a heavy fall of rain to the north, and
as I have given the other route a fair trial, 1 do not wish to lose so favourable
an opportunity.
We are all in good health, and the conduct of the men has been admirable.
Mr. Wills co-operates cordially with me. He is a most zealous and efficient
officer. I have promoted Mr. Brahe to the rank of officer?the position he is
now placed in rendered it absolutely necessary that I should do so. He is
well qualified for the post, and 1 hope the Committee will confirm the
appointment. ,
I have given instructions to Mr. Brahd to forward this letter by the first
opportunity.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
E. O?Hara Burke, Leader.
Mr. Wright?s Diary.
Saturday, 26 th January. Pamamoroo, Darling Fiver, New South Wales.?
Packing stores until 11 a.m., when the camels were sent on under charge of
Dr. Beckler, with instructions to camp on the west side of Pamamoroo Lake.
Owing to the unruly dispositions of the horses recently purchased, it was one
o?clock before Smith, accompanied by the native boy Dick (who had been
persuaded to venture again in the interior), started with four of the horses,
followed at 2 p.m. by Mr. Hodgkinson and Stone with five, and 3 p.m. by
Mr. Becker and myself with the remaining four horses. The afternoon was
occupied in packing and unpacking, nearly every horse throwing off his load,
and the party becoming separated by the trouble thus caused. Smith was
unable to find Dr. Decider?s halting-place, and camped about a mile and a-half
to the east of it. Two horses broke loose, and went away with their packs
into the thick polygonum of the lake, where they remained till next day.
Distance, five miles; weather very hot, with occasional light breezes. Country
occupied by Mr. McGregor.
Sunday, 21th. Pamamoroo Lalce. ?Started at dawn to look for the two
missing horses. Took Dick with me, and found one some eight miles away,
at a place called Tandower Swamp, Returned with it to camp, sending Dick
after the other horse, which he recovered in the afternoon, and brought into
camp. In accordance with my instructions Dr, Beckler had moved the camp
two miles farther on the western border of the swamp. During the day
Smith came up and reported his horses all safe. Resolved upon issuing the


following weekly scale of rations per man:?Flour, 7 Iks.; meat, 7 lbs., salt or
dried; sugar, l|lb.; tea, 30z.; with preserved vegetables, rice, &c., at
discretion. Thermometer at 2 p.m., 104 degrees.
Monday , 28^. Famamoroo Lake. ?In consequence of the intense heat and
the certainty of a small allowance of water for three or four days, I decided
upon travelling at night, and instructed the party to prepare for a move a
little before sundown. After breakfast Dick, the native, who had shown on
several occasions a disposition to slip away, borrowed a clean shirt and then
bolted. His unwillingness to accompany the party arose from his fear of the
natives, and was to be regretted, as his absence deprived us of our only inter-
preter. At 10 a.m. the thermometer stood at 104 degrees in the shade, and
at 2 p.m. had risen to 112 degrees. At a quarter to 6 o?clock commenced
packing, and started at 9 p.m,, with the rise of the full moon. The horses
went first and were followed by the camels, both keeping Mr. Burke?s track,
which was well marked from the recent trip of Dr. Beckler to Duroodo.
Continued travelling all night, the men walking and greatly fatigued.
Tuesday, 29 th. Coorkereya, or Kokriega .- ?At 7 a.m, the horses arrived at
the base of a rocky range, 25 miles north-west of the Darling, and camped in a
glen close to the main track. A large cave, adorned with native drawings, and
covered with the marks of various visitors, furnished an acceptable shelter from
the scorching heat; and at 9 a.m. the whole party were recruited by the arrival
of Dr. Beckler with the camels. Water being very scarce, owing to the evapo-
ration from our leathern water-bags, Hodgkinson and Smith set to work
cleaning out a well about 100 yards from the mouth of the cave. In a short
time water commenced to percolate through the sand, and ultimately several
buckets of a rather nauseous though desirable fluid were obtained. I then
had another well sunk higher up the glen, and fortunately succeeded in pro-
curing a bucket of water for nine of our horses, together with a sufficient
supply for personal use. About 6 p.m. a cool breeze sprang up, but the
horses suffered greatly from want of water, huddling round the well, and
refusing to feed until near sunset, when they scrambled up the rocks and
travelled along the crest of the range. Though there is no permanent water at
Coorkerega, and in fact none nearer than the Darling, except at rare intervals,
the worn-out cavities of the rocks furnish shelter to numerous marsupial
animals, more particularly to a species of rock wallaby, termed wanguroo by
the natives, and to the best of my belief not found southward of the Darling.
I should, however, be infringing on the province of the naturalist were I to
furnish a detailed description of this interesting animal ; but I may state that
I called Mr. Becker?s attention to several which were shot by Mr. Hodgkinson
duritig the progress of his party,
Wednesday, 30 th. ?On searching for the horses at dawn, it was found they
had strayed considerably. Stone and Hodgkinson started in quest of them.
Dr. Beckler, Belooch, and the cook packed the camels, and had just completed
their task when Hodgkinson returned with one horse, and stated that he had
followed the tracks ot four until he catight one; the others, which were not in
sight, heading straight for the Darling, Giving instructions to Dr. Beckler to
move on with the camels to Bilpa, the next stage, I saddled the horse thus
opportunely brought in and started after the others. It was dark ere they
were recovered; but I decided upon moving, and started as soon as possible,
camping within three miles of Bilpa, at which spot two water-bags had been
deposited previous to our leaving the Darling, Dr. Beckler camped at Bilpa,
and reported to me that a thunderstorm, accompanied by rain, had broken to
the north of his course at 1 p.m., and a few drops had fallen at Bilpa. Distance
from Coorkerega to Bilpa, twelve miles.
Thursday, 31s�. Bilpa. ?Started at dawn, and reached Bilpa with the
horses at 6 a.m. Found the camels packed and just about to start. Kept


Hodgkinson to assist in watering the horses; and told Dr, Beckler to move on
to Batoja, eighteen miles in front. The water remaining in the two pair of
water-bags sent here from the Darling filled about fifteen buckets of seven
quarts each, but was nauseous to the taste, being tainted by the smell from
the camel tarpaulings with which it was covered. We were only too glad,
however, to drink it, and to have the opportunity of giving each horse about
two gallons. As there were two other pairs of bags at Batoja, I decided
upon losing no time in going there, and immediately the horses were watered
started for that spot, keeping Mr, Burke?s track, and travelling over eighteen
miles of uninteresting and arid sandhills. At 5 p.m. I rejoined Dr. Beckler,
and heard with regret that two of the four bags cached near the camp were
quite empty on his arrival, and that the other two only contained five buckets.
The horses were suffering much from the want of water, being accustomed to
a well-watered country, and it was evident that unless speedily relieved they
would perish at the outset of the journey. Under these circumstances I
resolved upon sending to Motanie or Mutwongee Ranges for water, Mr. Burke?s
track leading to them, and the distance to the first water not exceeding twenty
miles, Mr. Hodgkinson and Belooch accordingly started in the morning with
the ten camels and five pairs of water-bags. At 1 a.m. they reached the Motanie
Range, tied up the camels, and worked all night at filling the bags from a
small rocky basin situated in a gloomy ravine. During their absence Mr.
Becker discovered a plant of Mr. Haverfield?s containing a jar of water, but I
did not make use of it, as the quantity was too small to be of much service,
and I thought it likely Mr. Haverfield might suffer inconvenience and dis-
appointment, as he was still out in the back country,
Friday, Ist February. ?Upon inspecting the horses this morning, I found
them so knocked up from thirst that a few hours? further suffering would
inevitably cause the loss of several. I therefore thought it advisable to push
on for the Motanie Ranges, leaving the packs, saddles, &c., behind. I was
the more resolved to pursue this course, as Hodgkinson and Belooch were un-
armed, and I thought it possible they might have fallen in with natives at the
water, and been prevented from obtaining a supply. Shortly after dawn I
started with Stone driving the horses. To my great satisfaction I met Hodg-
kinson and Belooch with a supply of water, ten miles from Batoja. I imme-
diately gave the horses a bucket of water each, which enabled them to go on
to Motanie, where we arrived in the course of the afternoon, and camped in a
valley covered with kangaroo-grass, - leading to a rocky basin containing an
abundance of beautifully clear water.
Saturday, 2nd, to Thursday, Ith. Motanie Range. ?During the period inter-
vening between Saturday morning and Thursday, the 7th, the party was
encamped in the Motanie Range, Dr. Beckler bringing up the camels with
their loads, and Smith and Hodgkinson again returning to Batoja with six
of the camels for the purpose of fetching up the horse packs, saddles, and
bridles. As this country has doubtless been described to you by Mr. Burke
as far as Torowotto (or Duroodo) Swamp, I do not think it necessary to state
more than that it abounds in fine pasturage, and consists of a valley some
twenty miles in length, flanked on its eastern and western sides by ranges of
lofty hills, formed of rock, and intersected by picturesque gorges, in many cases
forming at their heads fine pools of clear water. Though we saw the country
under a very different aspect from that it presented at the period of Mr.
Burke?s transit, it appeared even at the time we passed through it still a fine
and verdant tract. On Wednesday I moved the camp to another gorge about
eight miles north. On Thursday morning we left Motanie Range, and shortly
before sundown reached Nantherunge Creek, eighteen miles distant from our
last camp in the ranges.
Friday, Bth. Nantherunge Creek. ?The morning broke cloudy, with strong


gusts of wind from the south-west. During the night it was piercing cold, and
most of us were glad to augment our wearing apparel. Nantherunge is a fine
creek, witli water-holes two-thirds of a mile in length, bordered with heavy
gum-trees, but at this time the water in them was rather shallow. Near the
camp there were some pine-bearing sandhills, and somewhat peculiar dome-
shaped eminences. The camels, which had hitherto been tied up at night, I
now turned out in hobbles, and found they gave little more trouble, if any,
than the horses. This creek seemed to be a great resort for feathered game.
Emu tracks were very numerous, and droves of water-hen ran along the
margin. Early in the morning flocks of Sturt?s pigeons came down from the
sandhills to drink, and flights of parrots enlivened the vicinity of the camp
by their cries. We saw no natives here, but there were a number of mia-
mias close by us, and the fences which they form, in order to catch water-hen,
met the gaze in every bend of the creek. At 6 a.m, we commenced packing,
and at 11 a.m. started for the next creek, Wannaminta. Our course bore a
little to the west of north, and the track was flanked on the right by a bold
range called by the natives Toorltoro, and on the left by undulating sandhills,
beyond which were the ranges east of Flood?s Creek, called Wa-Ya-Boorla.
The sandhills were covered with pine and withered acacia, commonly known *
as mulgar. Grasses of various descriptions were abundant, and a small tree,
with a light-green foliage and bushy form, lent quite a charm to the otherwise
somewhat sombre character of the vegetation. The journey throughout the
day was very heavy for the camel men, who, in consequence of the heavy loads
on their beasts, were obliged to walk. About three miles from Wannaminta
two small hills of a singular shape rear themselves from the flat country by
which they are surrounded, and form a natural landmark, showing the termi-
nation of the plateau to the south. On reaching a spot midway between them,
a fine view, peculiarly Australian, presents itself. To the north a line of white
gum-trees mark the course of Wannaminta Creek ; while at some distance
(nine or ten miles) to the n.e. a bold but short and very remarkable range,
called Koorningbirri by the blacks, Wannaminta Bange by Mr. Wills, and I
understand Mount Jamieson by Mr. Haverfield, forms a striking feature in
the scene. During the day two turkeys were seen, but were too wild to be
approached within gunshot. We reached the creek at sundown, and estimated
the distance from Nantherunge at twenty miles. The weather throughout the
day was cold and cloudy, and at about 2 p.m. a slight shower fell. We
reached Yeltawinge Creek at 4 p.m. I had to send back to our last camp for
a swag of stores which was found to have been left behind. Mr. Hodgkinson
shot six water-hen, a teal, and four of Sturt?s pigeons.
Sunday , 10th. ?Moved the camp eight miles to a fine waterhole on the
Teltawinge. A number of emu were seen here, and several birds shot.
Mr. Hodgkinson here complained of rheumatic pains. During the day the
mirage was observable in every direction, and the range to the n.e. presented
strange changes of outline as we approached it.
Monday , 11th ?At thirty-five minutes past 8 the camels left Teltawinge,
but some delay was occasioned by two of the horses having strayed. Our
course lay over clay-plains, on which Mr. Burke?s track was very indis-
tinct, and in some places altogether invisible. Koorningbirri, of which Mr.
Becker made a sketch, now bore s.e., and a large, though low, hill faced
Teltawinge, on its western bank. The vegetation consisted chiefly of cotton
bush and salsolaceous plants, and the absence of timber, except in the vicinity
of the creek, rendered the scene rather uninteresting. The country around
our camp of last night bore traces of inundation, and the footprints of the
natives who had accompanied either Mr. Burke or Lyons were deep in the
clay soil. Shallow watercourses intersected the wide plain extending around
ns, and every hollow was coated with dry sand, glistening and cracked. A


few of Sturt?s pigeons, with occasionally a small bird not unlike a mule canary,
were the only animated objects to be seen. The heat was excessive. The
camels were unable to stand in one place more than a few minutes, lifting
their feet from the hot sand in quick succession. An emu was started, which
was feeding near the track ; and so bewildered did the bird appear to be, that it
kept walking in front and around us for some time, but eventually made off.
At half-past 5 we reached Paldrumatta Creek, where we camped for the
night, with abundance of shallow water of a creamy hue. The distance from
Teltawinge to Paldrumatta is about twenty-two miles.
Tuesday, 12 th. ? We left Paldrumatta Creek at 9 a.m., running up its south-
ern bank for about half a mile to Mr, Burke?s crossing-place, and then ascend-
ing the northern hank, bounded by sandhills presenting the usual features.
About a mile from Paldrumatta the track passes to the east of a salt lake,
which presented a remarkable view, from the contrast of its snowy white
incrustations with the scenery around. Mount Koorningbirri and other ranges
were nearly out of sight. About 5 p.m. the horses reached Torowotto (or
Duroodo) Swamp, and shortly afterwards were joined by the camel party,
camping on the site of Mr. Burke?s forty-fifth camp, though no numerals are
marked on the tree bearing his initials.
Wednesday , 13 th. ?Torowotto Swamp, where I resolved on spelling for a
couple of days, is one of a numerous series of hollows, receiving the drainage
of the surrounding country, and presents a surface of thick green foliage,
intersected by a thousand little watercourses, and traversed by a main channel
running nearly east and west. Stunted box-trees overshadow the swamp,
which is matted with a thick undergrowth of polygonum and plants particu-
larly agreeable to the camels. Besides this there is abundance of marsilice, a
plant creeping close to the ground, with leaves not unlike clover, and bearing
a seed largely used by the natives as food. On this seed Lyons and McPherson
subsisted for some time, and the tree under which they camped and pounded
their bread was close by us. Shortly after our arrival at Torowotto a tribe of
natives came towards us. They were about seventeen, perfectly unarmed. A
tassel tied round the loins of the men, and a few emu feathers depending from
the chin as ornaments, composed their stock of clothing. They appeared to be
very healthy and in good condition. I gave them two tomahawks and some
broken biscuit, endeavouring to make them comprehend that I wished two of
them to accompany the party. I selected two, and gave them each a shirt.
They were well acquainted with the various creeks, and named several places
in advance, but our mutual ignorance of each other?s language rendered it im-
possible to obtain any serviceable information. In the evening they brought
their women to the camp, and freely offered them as presents in return for the
few things we had given them. Most of the males were circumcised, but
the cicatrices in the arms and breasts peculiar to some tribes were not marked
in the Torowotto natives. The weather during the day was very hot, while
occasionally, without the least intimation of its approach, a whirlwind would
sweep round the packs and scatter the lighter articles in every direction.
These winds moved in segments of circles, and their directions seemed quite
capricious.
Thursday, 14 th. ?Spelled at Torowotto. The day was employed in mending
saddles, cleaning firearms, and looking over the stores. I discovered that the
flour planted by Mr. Burke had been dug up, the hoops of the cask lying near
our camp. The camel-rug under which Lyons and McPherson lay was still
suspended from the tree to which it had been tied, the natives apparently
thinking it too heavy to be useful to them. All day our black visitors kept
walking about, pilfering any little articles they could, and burying them in the
sand with their feet.
Friday , 15 th. ?Bose at dawn, filled water-bags, packed and started the


horses at 8 a.m. and the camels at 9. Two of the natives accompanied the
horses as guides, but proceeded only a short distance with us. On leaving
Torowotto the tribe gathered together, and the women made a show of
whimpering at our departure. Skirting the n.e. shore of the swamp for
half a mile, we then struck over the sandhills on our old course to w, of
K passing over precisely similar country to that bordering the southern shores
of?the swamp. At eighteen miles? distance from Torowotto the track cut the
summit of a lofty sand-ridge, affording a view of the surrounding country. To
the north lay a dreary salt-bush plain, diversified by claypans, and flanked on
its eastern and western slopes by sandhills of small elevation. As there was
no si"n of water, and the camel-men were fatigued by a long walk through
heavy sand, I camped upon the verge of this plain, and experienced consider-
able difficulty in preventing the horses from wandering during the night back
to Torowotto. No water. Weather close and oppressive.
Saturday, 16 th. Mud-Plain Camp.? Fortunately we had brought from
Torowotto a pair of leather bags filled with water, and all the goat-skin bags.
The latter, however, would not retain water at all, and arrived at the camp
nearly empty. Neither camels nor horses would feed; the former, though closely
hobbled going straight away, and requiring strict watching to keep them near
the camp: At the period of Mr. Burke?s transit this country was completely
bogged, the tracks of his party being deeply imbedded in the claypans around.
At the date of my arrival not a sign of water was discernible, no birds could
be seen save hawks, and the ground was burrowed in every direction by rats,
which seemed to exist independent of water. As the cattle were suffering
from thirst, I sent Stone back with the horses to Torowotto, and Dr. Beckler,
Mr. Hodfkinson, and Belooch with the camels. They took all the water-bags
with them. Shortly after their departure, I started with Smith to look for
water in a northerly direction. Mr. Becker and Purcell remained at the camp.
At 7 p m. a peculiarly brilliant meteor fell towards the n.e. _
Sunday, VUh. Mud-Plain Camp.? Dr. Beckler, Mr. Hodgkmson, Stone,
and Belooch returned to camp with the cattle and a supply ot water. 1 was
absent throughout the day, searching the N.w. boundary of the plain and
adjacent ranges for water, and ultimately discovered a small puddle about
twenty miles north of the camp, and about two miles west of Mr. Burke s
track. Weather intensely hot. . , x , ,
Monday, 18$. Mud-Plain Camp During the night the camels and
horses were very troublesome, requiring watching to prevent them straying
in search of water. The water-bags were protected as well as possible from
evaporation, by tarpaulins. At 3 p.m. I returned to camp with Smith, having
travelled at least 140 miles since my departure on the 16th. 1 found tne
country in front of the most fearful description. Mr, Burke s track runs to
the n.n.w. over some high ranges covered with sharp stones, and emerges
upon the plains upon which we are camped, at a spot where it changes to an
apparently limitless expanse of dried mud. The track is utterly effaced, and
the whole country the picture of desolation, not a vestige of herbage growing
upon the plains. The horses were watched throughout the night and the
camels tied up. A bucket of water was given to each quadruped from our
Wa SesS* 19$. ?At 4 a.m. called all the hands. Saddled and started with
the horses*at 7 a.m., the camels following half an hour later. A fierce glare,
even at this early hour, rose from the plains, and the sun beat down oveihead
with an intense heat. Till 1 o?clock we traversed this weary plain of baked
mud, skirting the sandhills upon its western flank, and leaving Mr. Burkes
track, which ran more to the eastward. Not a sign of animal life was dis-
cernible, save the clouds of flies which tormented us throughout the journey.
At 1 p m two prominent headlands reared themselves to the west, and m a


bay between them was sufficient feed to warrant me in camping there, at about
one and a-half miles distant from the water I had discovered. I had left the
horses to go on in advance, and returned to the camels in order to lead them
to the spot, previously cautioning those in charge not to let the horses get to
the water. Unfortunately, however, the horses? rushed into the hole in spite
of every opposition, and in a very few minutes rendered it a mass of mud.
Ihe camels were tied up during the night to some bushes, on which they
greedily fed, but the horses remained near the water. At nightfall a thunder-
storm gathered in the western horizon, breaking upon us and passing, un-
accompanied by rain, to the southward. For hours afterwards we were buoyed
up by the hopes of a rainfall, but, beyond a few drops, none fell near our camp,
though it seemed to be raining heavily a short distance to the southward.
Wednesday , 20th. Rat Point. ?This morning slight showers fell, from
which we managed to collect three or four quarts of water. At thirty
minutes past one I started with Smith in search of water, taking about eight
quarts from the bags as a supply, and two camels. Previous to leaving, I
inspected the store of water at the camp, and found it to amount to forty-two
quarts for eight camels, thirteen horses, and six men. The nearest supply
known to us was at Torowotto, thirty-eight miles distant, I placed the water
in Mr. Hodgkinson?s charge, with instructions to issue two quarts daily to each
man, and three pints to each horse, and requested Dr. Beckler to take a pair
of water-bags to the mud-hole and scoop up any small quantity he might be
able to obtain. 1 also instructed Stone if I was not back by 10 a.m. on
Friday following to return to Torowotto with the horses, and Dr. Beckler,
Mr. Hodgkinson, and Belooch with the camels, for a supply of water. Dr.
Beckler succeeded in obtaining four quarts of a very indifferent fluid from the
hole. Thunder continued throughout the day, but no rain fell. A water-hen
was shot close to the camp in the afternoon.
Thursday, 21st. But Point. ?The camels remained near the camp all last
night. The first annoyance was experienced from the rats, which abound
throughout this country.
Friday, 22nd. Rat Point. ?The rats visited the camp in myriads, not only
gnawing through every pack-bag, but absolutely biting the men when at rest.
The horses suffering greatly from thirst, Stone started with them for Torowotto,
and at a few minutes past ten I returned to camp just as Dr. Beckler, Mr.
Hodgkinson, and Belooch were starting with the camels. During my absence
I travelled upwards of a hundred miles, crossing the country northwards in
every direction, without finding a drop of water. The camels with me suffered
greatly from rapid travelling and thirst, but I thought it best to send them on
at once with the others to Torowotto. Stone and the camel party met with
water from the late rainfall about ten miles from camp, and the horses re-
turned in the evening after drinking as much as they could. Dr. Beckler also
came back with a pair of water-bags containing a small supply, but Mr.
Hodgkinson and Belooch went on, as no more water could be found near the
spot.
Saturday , 23rd.?Remained in camp throughofit the day. At 10 p.h.
Mr, Hodgkinson and Belooch returned with a supply of water, which they
had procured from the claypans on the plain, sixteen miles distant.
Sunday, 24th. Rat Point. ?Mr. Hodgkinson reporting that a good supply
of water might be stored by sinking a hole in the vicinity of the claypans
from which he obtained the late supply, I instructed him to proceed thither
with Dr. Beckler, and sink a hole for that purpose. At the same time I sent
six of the camels and Stone with all the horses to spell there, during my
absence on a further attempt to explore northward. Should the claypans dry
up previous to my return, they were to proceed to Torowotto, leaving Mr.
Becker and Purcell at Rat Point in charge of the stores. At noon I left Eat
VOL. XXXII. 2 L


Point with Smith and Belooch, four camels, and seven days? rations, resolving
to penetrate to the first permanent water on the line of route, and if possible to
reach Cooper?s Creek, which I conjectured to be within a hundred miles. Dr.
Beckler, Mr. Hodgkinson, Stone, and the cattle remained near the claypans;
the two former sinking a hole and watching the camels, and the latter attend-
ing to the horses. In order to preserve the continuation of events at the
camp during my absence, the report of my trip will be given on the date of
my return.
Monday, 25th. ?Dr. Beckler and Mr. Hodgkinson finished sinking their
water-hole this morning, and collected a considerable supply of water from the
claypans adjacent. Neither camels nor horses strayed from the vicinity.
Tuesday, 26th. Bat Point.? The water in the claypans being exhausted,
Dr, Beckler, Mr. Hodgkinson, and Stone moved with the cattle to Torowotto,
reaching that place at 3 p.m. The natives were still at the swamp, and very
friendly.
Wednesday, 21th. Bat Point.?Dr. Beckler, Mr. Hodgkinson, and Stone
remained at Torowotto with the cattle ; Mr. Becker and Purcell at Rat Point.
Thursday, 28th. Bat Point.?Dr. Beckler conveyed a supply of water to
Rat Point, and Mr. Hodgkinson and Stone remained with the cattle at Toro-
wotto.
Friday, Is# March. Bat Point.? The party, as before mentioned, were
divided between Torowotto and Rat Point. A drizzling rain fell through the
night at Torowotto. The natives became rather troublesome, pilfering little
articles.
Saturday, 2nd. Bat Point. ?Dr. Beckler returned to Torowotto with rations.
The party were stationed as before. Mr. Hodgkinson killed a snake some
three feet in length, very thick in proportion to its length, of a dirty deep
brown colour, with large livid irregularly-marked blotches. The natives
represented it as highly poisonous, but did not scruple to devour it with great
relish.
Sunday, 3 rd. Bat Point. ?No change in the disposition of the party.
Monday, Mh. Bat Pom#.?Still no change.
Tuesday, sth. Bat Point.? No change. Prepared to return to Rat Point
on the following day.
Wednesday, 6th. Bat Point? Mr. Hodgkinson took a supply of water to
Mr. Becker and Purcell, from Torowotto.
Thursday, Ith. Bat Point. ?The party stationed at Rat Point and Toro-
wotto, as before.
Friday, Bth. Bat Point. ?Mr. Hodgkinson returned to Torowotto with
rations, having previously submitted to Mr. Becker a plan for following my
track, as they were apprehensive, from my lengthened absence, that some
accident had occurred to me. The horses strayed from Torowotto, but were
recovered some ten miles distant.
Saturday, 9th. Bat Point. ?No change in the disposition of the party.
Sunday, 10th. Bat Point.? Dr. Beckler and Messrs. Hodgkinson and
Stone, having filled six pMr of water-bags, started for Rat Point with the
intention of pushing out in search of me, with four of the camels and two
men ; but on their arrival at the waterhole, sixteen miles from Rat Point,
found Smith and Belooch, whom, on my arrival this morning, I had sent there
with the camels, and instructions that Stone should return accompanied by
Smith to Torowotto, that Dr. Beckler should at once push on to Rat Point
with water, and that he should be followed on the following day by Mr.
Hodgkinson and Belooch with the camels. The events occurring during my
absence northward are as follow:?On February 24th, the day I started, I
went about twelve miles nearly due north, searching for water in every likely
spot, and camping upon a dry sandy creek. From thence I proceeded twenty


miles farther on the same course, crossing large dry gum-creeks running from
all directions, and finally camped on one of them. The third day, while still
seeking water, I saw Mr. Burke?s track for the first time since leaving Bat
Point, and camped that evening upon some sandhills to east of Karriapundi
Swamp, whence I could not obtain water, in consequence of the boggy nature
of the ground, and the presence of a large body of natives. The next morning
I struck for the north-east, over a sandy undulating country, and at 2 p.m.
reached a large watercourse coming from the eastward, but containing no water.
Upon the fifth morning, at dawn, I noticed a fire from a native camp, about
half a mile from my own, and passed the day in searching for water, not once
seeing Mr. Burke?s track, which I then conjectured must he upon the north-
western side of the swamp. On the sixth?morning 1 found the camels greatly
exhausted from fatigue and want of water, they having had but twelve quarts
each since leaving Rat Point. I returned, therefore, to where I had seen the
water in the swamp, and camped, still unable to get a supply. The following
(seventh day) I skirted the swamp, and at noon succeeded in reaching a place
where the water was accessible. On tasting it, it was found to be excessively
brackish, or rather like lime-water, since when thrown on the heated claypans
it caused a hissing sound. The camels drank greedily without any ill effects, but
the men and myself suffered from it very considerably. On the eighth morning
I returned to the place where I had last seen Mr, Burke?s track, and found that
he had diverged from his course of n. by w. to n.e. Our rations were this day
all finished, with the exception of three pounds of oatmeal and a little tea.
I was determined, however, to push on to the next permanent water, in order
to be enabled to bring on the party. I gave orders that each man should have
three spoonfuls of oatmeal per diem. Camped thirty-four miles from the lime
water in Karriapundi Swamp, on a sandhill. On the ninth day I made a
water-hole about five miles north-east of my last camp, and saw two bullocks
there. Passed on, and twenty-seven miles farther, still crossing undulating
sandy country, reached a fine creek (Poria), and camped six miles on its north
side. On the tenth morning I made a camp of Mr. Burke?s, marked 52, and
situated upon a dry arm of Bulloo Creek, Crossed during the day, twenty-five
miles from Poria Creek, another fine creek (Koorliatto), apparently dry. Saw
no water or natives throughout the day, though signal-fires rose in every
direction, at brief intervals. On the eleventh day I reached Bulloo, and after
remaining a few minutes returned to Rat Point, arriving there on the fifteenth
day. We were fortunate enough to kill a turkey and three pigeons during our
return, the former of which enabled us to get along tolerably well, but the
pigeons were stolen by the rats in the night.
Monday , 11 th. Vat Point. ?The horses and camels strayed during the
night from the water-hole dug upon the plains to Torowotto, and it was
12 o?clock before the latter reached Eat Point, as they were not overtaken
till they had regained the swamp. The horses were left in charge of Stone
and Smith at Torowotto, with orders to start thence on Wednesday. The
health of the men gave me much anxiety. Smith, Belooch, and myself
suffered from diarrhoea. Mr. Becker and Stone manifested scorbutic symp-
toms, and Purcell had swollen legs and numerous sores. Trusting that a
change from the inaction of Rat Point would benefit them, I gave orders to
start on the following morning.
Tuesday, 12 th. ?Upon uncovering our stores, which we had buried, in
order to preserve them as much as posible from the rats, I was gratified to
find that less damage had been caused than I had had reason to expect. I
thought proper to despatch Dr. Beckler, Mr, Becker, Mr. Hodgkinson, Purcell,
and Belooch, with the camels in advance, so that the water they carried might
enable the horses to reach the water-hole I had discovered between Karria-
pundi and Poria Creek, a distance of 102 miles from Torowotto. After
2 L 2


travelling twelve miles, the camels had to stop, from the bottom of one of
the pack-bags falling out. Mr. Becker and myself remained at Rat Point.
Wednesday, Vdth. ?I had given orders to Dr. Beckler not to tie up the
camels at night, in order that they might have every opportunity to feed.
Unfortunately the majority of them took advantage of this liberty to stray
hack to Torowotto, and Dr. Beckler and Belooch had to return there, a dis-
tance of fifty-two miles, for their recovery. Mr. Hodgkinson and Purcell
remained with the saddles, stores, and water, amounting to twenty buckets.
Dr. Beckler, in returning to Torowotto, took three pairs of water-hags with
him, and previously to his starting a couple of buckets were given to the camel
he rode. Stone and Smith came into Rat Point with the horses, as instructed,
and camped there with Mr. Becker and myself. The weather was so tearfully
hot that the horses appeared knocked up by their journey from Torowotto
here.
Thursday , 14 th. Mud Plains. ?l started early in the morning with the
horses, and on reaching the camel camp, at twelve miles? distance, gave each
horse a bucket of water, and took four buckets for use. Leaving instructions
for the camels to push on as soon as they should arrive from Torowotto, I
hastened onwards with Mr. Becker, Stone, Smith, and the horses, reaching
the water-hole north of the Karriapundi Swamp on the 16th inst., after
experiencing great difficulty, both men and horses being knocked up; our
supply of four buckets of water from the camel-camp having almost all leaked
away.
Friday , 15 th. Mud Plains. ?Mr. Hodgkinson and Purcell remained at the
camel-camp with the stores. Dr. Beckler and Belooch were engaged in getting
the camels back from Torowotto.
Saturday, 16th. Mud Plains.? Dr, Beckler and Belooch returned from
Torowotto with the camels, and rejoined Mr. Hodgkinson and Purcell at the
camp.
Sunday, 17 th. ?The camel camp started after me, and reached a spot seven-
teen miles in advance of their last camp. Fortunately for them, a shower fell,
which tilled the claypans near their camp, and enabled the camels to drink to
their content. Purcell was reported to me as suffering greatly from pains in
his legs, and rode upon one of the camels throughout the day. Two of the
camels, Gobin and Raugee, had very bad hump-sores, from the ill-fitting
saddles supplied them. The horses reached Poria Creek with the party accom-
panying me, and one horse died from want of water and fatigue, though
every caution was used in supplying the weaker ones with a drink.
Monday , 18/ A. Karriapundi Plains. ?The camels, skirting the north-west
hank of Karriapundi Swamp, camped about eight miles to the north of it.
Gobin, one of the camels, became very footsore, and his load was distributed
among the other camels. Coppin, or Janglee, one of the Cremorne camels, was
also slightly affected in the same manner ; and the whole of the camels were
considerably fatigued by the heavy work they had lately performed. Shadow,
the smallest of the camels, was by far the best in condition, and carried her
heavy load with apparent ease. Another horse died at Poria to-day from the
effects of his push across the waterless plain south of it.
Tuesday, 19 th. Mud Plains, at 3 p.m.? Still among the same uninteresting
salt-bush plains. The camels reached the water-hole where the horses had
camped on the 16th inst, Mr. Hodgkinson and Belooch contrived to preserve
sufficient water by digging a hole and filtering the mud through the large
marsh-mallow seeds growing near the spot. Smith, whom I sent this morning
from Poria Creek with a supply of water, joined the camel party in the after-
noon, but found them tolerably well supplied from the rain that had fallen
south of Karriapundi.
Wednesday, 20 th. Poria Creek.? The camel party reached Poria Creek


this day, and I found Purcell much worse than when I last saw him at Eat
Point. Poria is a fine creek, abounding in fish, and when very full throwing
its surplus waters towards Karriapundi. Our camp was situated at its south
termination, its course being nearly north and south. The banks were fringed
with stunted bastard box, and we derived much benefit during our stay there
from the waterfowl shot.
Thursday, 21 st, to Thursday, 28th. Poria Creek. ?During the period in-
cluded between the above dates I spelled the party at the creek, hoping that
the men would in some degree regain their health, I regret to state, however,
that I had little reason to congratulate myself upon the results. Mr. Becker
and Purcell became much worse, and utterly unable to w T alk about, and Smith
and Stone did not at all improve, though energetically discharging their
respective duties. As I had found no water in the crossing at the next
creek (Koorliatto), I sent Dr. Beckler, Smith, and Belooch thither with a
supply, directing them to conceal it as well as possible from the natives.
Friday, 29 th. Poria Creek. ?The rats committed great ravages during our
stay at this creek, and were far bolder than the majority of domesticated
animals in their attacks. Owing to the necessity of examining every bag, it
was half-past 12 before the camels started with Dr. Beckler, Mr. Becker,
and Purcell, who had to be carried upon camels. Mr, Hodgkinson and Belooch,
Smith, Stone, and myself, remained at the creek with the horses. The camel
party camped at 4 p.m. on the site of Mr. Burke?s 51st camp. A heavy fall of
rain took place during the night.
Saturday, 30 th. Koorliatto Creek. ?At 9 a.m. the camels started, the rain
still falling, but ceasing in an hour?s time. At 3 p.m. they reached Koorliatto
Creek, and at 8 p.m. the horses, which travelled from Poria, joined them.
Stone, who had received a wetting on the night of the 29 th, became much
worse, and 1 had a tent put up for Mr, Becker and Purcell, who were unable
to proceed farther. We found the creek running, though dry a few days
before. Its course trended from e. to N.w. for seven or eight miles, skirting
the south-west base of the Bulloo Eange, and then turning sharp to the west
direct for Poria Creek, of which I conjecture it to be a main feeder. There
was much more timber on this creek than on Poria, and splendid feed for the
cattle on the sandhills adjacent.
Sunday, 31si. Koorliatto Greek. ?Morning broke piercingly cold, with a
cloudy sky and drizzling rain. About 10 a.m. the rain cleared off, but I did
not think it prudent to move with so? many sick.
Monday , Ist April. Koorliatto Creek. ?Spelled, as rain fell at intervals
throughout the day. Ko improvement in the health of the men.
Tuesday, 2nd. Koorliatto Greek. ?Though the weather cleared up, I was
compelled to remain in camp, Stone being affected with severe rheumatic pains.
In the morning a native made his appearance, and gave us the names of the
surrounding localities. He wore no covering, save a tassel of native grass
round his loins, and pointed out Bulloo as lying much more to the west than
our course lay. After taking a minute survey of the camp, he left.
Wednesday, 2>rd. Koorliatto Creek. ?Seeing plainly that any attempt to
move Mr. Becker and Purcell would retard their prospect of ultimate recovery,
and finding no cause for apprehension from the natives, I resolved to push,
forward to Bulloo, which I conjectured from our northern position would be
Cooper?s Creek. My anxiety to move arose from the fact that I feared Mr.
Burke?s stores must require replenishment, and that any party left at Cooper?s
Creek would be anxiously expecting our arrival. On these considerations I
gave orders to prepare for a start on the following day.
Thursday, Ith. Bulloo or Wright's Creek. ?At 9 a.m. the camels started,
under charge of Mr, Hodgkinson and Belooch, Gobin?s saddle being left behind,
as her back was getting very sore, and her lameness incapacitated her from


carrying any load. Considerable difficulty was experienced in crossing the
creek, which had been slightly escarped from the steepness of the banks, but
eventually the camels with their loads were got over without injury. The
track led over the narrow belt of sandhills bordering the north bank of the
creek, and then, debouching upon an extensive plain, intersected with water-
courses, and crowded with rat-holes, pursued a course some few degrees to the
east of north. In places Mr. Burke?s track was hardly perceptible, but no
difficulty was found in regaining it, as it was flanked on the west side by the
Bulloo Range, and on the east side by a line of creek-timber running with
prominent headlands towards it at distances varying from six to eight miles.
Twelve miles from Koorliatto we passed one of these points where Mr. Burke
had pitched his 52nd camp. We found no water there. Eight miles farther
we sighted Bulloo, and established the camp at the point where we first struck
it. The horses which started after the camels overtook the latter, and reached
camp about half an hour before them. We saw no natives throughout the day,
save two who accompanied us a few miles from Koorliatto, but signal-fires
broke out in all directions. The weather continued fearfully hot.
Friday, sth, to Wednesday, 17 th. Bulloo. ?Throughout the period included
in the above-mentioned dates Mr. Hodgkiuson, Stone, Smith, and Belooch
remained with me at Bulloo, spelling the camels and occasionally visiting
Koorliatto, to convey supplies to the party there. Dr. Beckler?s patients
were gradually sinking, and Stone became much worse. As the natives were
very numerous, and apparently collecting from the surrounding districts, I
cut logs for a rough stockade, which was subsequently erected. Though
there was no feed near the camp, at four or five miles? distance grass and
salsolaceous plants were abundant, so that the cattle rapidly improved. From
the absence of any indication that Mr. Burke had stopped at this creek, I felt
convinced that Cooper?s Creek lay still farther in advance, and made two
advances, north-east and north-west, for the purpose of tracing the course of
the track. I found Bulloo watercourse to consist of a large sheet of water,
extending some five miles to the north of our camp, with a breadth of 100 to
200 yards and a depth in some parts of sixteen or twenty feet. Fish of a
considerable size were caught by the party ; and at the northern termination
of the water-hole, where the creek branched with insignificant channels,
numbers of ingeniously-constructed fishing dams showed that the natives
derived a considerable sustenance from its waters. At the northern com-
mencement of the small channels, which apparently connect the larger water
basins, but from their intricate courses are difficult to follow, the plains
became extremely stony, and the track, turning rapidly to the west, com-
pletely obliterated. On the two occasions to which I have referred as advancing
northerly 1 was compelled to turn back from the hostility of the natives, who,
upon my camping, collected in large numbers, making fires all round me, and
trying to entice Smith, who accompanied me, by means of their women.
Bands often visited the camp, signifying the ground to be theirs, and ordering
us to move away. All these demonstrations, in the present state of my party,
gave me much anxiety, and I felt anxious to obtain additional stores for
recruiting the sick and effectually supplying the advance party, I instructed
Mr. Hodgkinson, therefore, to start for Menindie on the 18th instant, with
Belooch and seven of the camels, to escort Mr. Becker and Purcell to that
township, and having engaged two men in their places, to return as quickly as
possible with stores. By these means I should do away with the incon-
venience of two camps, afford two of the sick what I considered a chance of
ultimate recovery, and only, by Dr. Beckler?s return to the Bulloo camp, lose
one available hand. Moving backwards or forwards with the whole depot was
impossible with so many sick, and I thought myself still sufficiently strong to
hold an intrenched position against any attack made by the natives.


Thursday, ISth. Bulloo. ?This morning I sent Mr. Hodgkinson on his
journey to Menindie, directing him to take charge of Mr. Becker and Purcell,
and to request Dr, Beckler to rejoin me. I had constructed a cudjowar, or
camel-palanquin, for the carriage of the two sick men, and I trusted that the
prospect of a return to the settled districts would lend them energy for the
journey. The natives visited the camp during the day, and pertinaciously
hung round the stores. They were accompanied by a hoy, some eight years of
age, singularly impudent in his behavour. Stone rapidly got worse, being
seized frequently with severe rheumatic pains. Mr. Hodgkinson, as afterwards
reported, reached Koorliatto.
Friday, 19 th. Bulloo. ?On this day Mr. Hodgkinson returned from Koor-
liatto, bringing with him a note from Dr. Beckler, in which that officer so
strongly protested against the removal of Mr. Becker and Purcell to Menindie
as to leave me no alternative but that of countermanding my instructions on
that point. I therefore directed Mr. Hodgkinson to return to Koorliatto and
bring Mr. Becker and Purcell to Bulloo, together with the whole of the camels,
as I resolved not to send to Menindie any of the party until I could form some
more definite opinion regarding the prospects of the recovery of the sick.
Stone being much worse, I instructed Dr. Beckler to return without any delay,
that he might alford his medical assistance. No natives came near the camp
throughout the day, but the necessity of watching throughout the night fell
very severely on the few in health.
Saturday, 20 th. Bulloo. ?Mr. Hodgkinson left for Koorliatto, reaching
there at 11 a.m., but Dr. Beckler did not start for Bulloo, being unable to
leave Mr. Becker and Purcell with safety.
Sunday, 21st. Bulloo. ?Throughout last night signal-fires were burning
around the camp here, and the natives imitated the howl of the native dog,
apparently for the purpose of ascertaining our vigilance. Fifty-one rats were
killed by means of a trap which I had made; but this slaughter, though
greatly exceeding the subsequent nightly average, did not seem to diminish
either their boldness or their numbers. Dr, Beckler arrived at Bulloo at
5 p.m., and Mr. Becker and Purcell were not reported as having suffered from
their removal. Two tents were at once pitched for their accommodation,
Mr. Hodgkinson remained at Koorliatto, as only two of the camels were found
when Dr. Beckler and Belooch started.
Monday, 22nd. Bulloo. ?Between 9 and 10 this morning, eight natives
came to the camp, armed; and upon being told to move off, two went up,
and the other six down the creek, joining respectively two bands who
had crossed the plains west of the camp, and concealed themselves in the
creek-timber. In a few minutes a large body of them appeared on the bank
of the creek, distant sixty yards from our stores, thronging through the scrub,
and occasionally showing in the open, in parties of seven and eight. A black
fellow, who went by the appellation of ? Shirt,? from having had that garment
presented to him by us, was particularly active, coming boldly up to the
stores, and walking unconcernedly around them. He then picked up about
forty rats, that were lying dead around, and, dropping a portion of them,
motioned for me to pick them up and carry them for him, merely, I think, to
get my head in an unguarded position. Several other blacks were meanwhile
drawing nearer to us, violently gesticulating, making signs that they were
hungry, and that we were camped upon their ground. One tall, strapping
luhra accompanied them, and was exceedingly active, bearing a boomerang
with considerable grace, and inciting her companions to attack us. At this
time I had but two able men with me, Dr. Beckler and Smith, Belooch having
started for Koorliatto to assist Mr. Hodgkinson in finding the camels and
bringing them in. Our cooking-place was close to the creek, for the benefit of
shade and water; and the utensils were round the fire, together with several


clothes which had been washed by the party. Dr, Beckler reporting to me
that he saw natives creeping on their hands and knees near the fire, I took
Smith down with me to clear them away. It was indeed high time. Several
of them were fingering their boomerangs as if impatient for a fight; and lifting
up the lappels of Purcell?s tent, commenced unpacking the medicine-basket,
while a third, with an armful of boomerangs, was throwing them carelessly
upon the ground near his brother warriors. However, they were not quite
resolved upon hostilities, as when Smith and I pointed our pieces at them
they quietly moved off before us, and retired without any further manifesta-
tions of hostility. Throughout this scene Stone, though dying, behaved with
great intrepidity, raising himself upon his bed and aiming his revolver at the
natives when they approached him. About 2 P.M., just as the blacks moved
off, I was called by Stone, who, grasping me by the hand, said, ? I am going.?
He then spoke a few words, and repeatedly asked that cold water should be
thrown over him, as he could not breathe. Within ten minutes from the
time he first called me, he turned upon his face and died. At 7 p.m. he was
buried near the camp, by Dr. Beckler and Smith. I have omitted to state
that the blacks took away every portable article from the fire, throwing away
the tea and salt, and taking the bags. Belooch reached Koorliatto early this
morning, and Mr. Hodgkinson started with him towards Bulloo, but were
compelled to camp eight miles from Koorliatto, owing to the late time at
which they recovered the camels.
Tuesday, 23rd. Bulloo. ?Mr. Hodgkinson and Belooch reached Bulloo
with the camels at 8 this morning, and immediately they arrived we un-
packed all the stores, and passed the day in mending rat-holes, and
repacking them in the form of a stockade; two sides being formed by as many
logs sufficiently straight as we could procure at a reasonable distance. These
logs were about four feet in height above the ground, allowing us to fire easily
over them. The other two sides were not so high, but still a tolerable pro-
tection. Inside the stockade, every available weapon was placed so as to be
handy for immediate use, and some of us always slept within it. At the
same time our fire was brought within ten yards of it, as we had no more
cooking-apparatus to spare. Our watch commenced at 8 p.m., and terminated
at 6 a.m.
Wednesday, 24 th. Bulloo. ?The first announcement this morning was that
Purcell had died in the doctor?s presence during the night. For some days
past he had been so weak as to faint after drinking a little water, and we had
long been expecting his decease. I sent Belooch and Smith to look after the
horses which fed between Bulloo and a tributary creek. About an hour after
they started the natives made their appearance, coming in twos and threes
through the thick scrub on the creek, until about a score had collected. They
were armed with new boomerangs, spears, and waddies, and were accompanied
by the boy previously mentioned, whose conduct was even more impudent
than before. At first the boy advanced with two powerful fellows hesitatingly
towards the stockade, while in their rear could be seen a dozen others atten-
tively watching their proceedings. Mr. Hodgkinson having brought in the
things from the fire, I advanced with him towards the natives, motioning them
to be off. Disregarding my attempts to clear them off, I caught hold of the
boy, and, turning him round, gave him plainly to understand that he would
not be allowed to remain near the camp. I thought proper to do this, as he
was evidently only brought to insult us, and at length he retired with the
others to a short distance. We then entered the stockade and watched the
proceedings of the natives, who were joined about this time by another party
from the south-west. The whole body then clustered around Stone?s grave
and became most insulting in their demeanour. Taking up a dead rat, one
of them made a harangue upon it, and concluded by flinging it contemptuously


at us. Finding we did not notice this, they threw the earth from Stone?s
grave in the air, and after carrying logs as if mocking the erection of the
stockade, made signs that we should all meet the same fate as those dead. I
was very unwilling to fire at them, and allowed them to throw several sticks
at us rather than commence actual hostilities. By noon they had concluded
their demonstrations, and moved quietly off to a camp which they had
established to the north of us. Smith and Belooch returned at nightfall,
having been unable to find the horses. Shortly afterwards Dr. Beckler and
Mr. Hodgkinson commenced digging Purcell?s grave.
Thursday , 25 th. Bulloo. ?At daylight 1 directed Mr. Hodgkinson to
complete Purcell?s grave, and, with Dr. Beckler?s assistance, he was buried
by 8 a.m. Immediately after breakfast I started with Smith for the horses,
but had not proceeded two miles before signal-fires rose all around me, and I
returned to the camp, so that the natives should not derive any advantage
from my absence. I should have premised that we had heard a horse-bell in
the morning on the opposite side of Bulloo Creek, and that Mr. Hodgkinson,
who swam over for the purpose, ascertained that six of the horses were feeding
upon the bank. I now resolved upon crossing them if possible, and Dr.
Beckler swam with Mr. Hodgkinson across the creek at mid-day, for the
purpose of driving them into the water. This desirable object was accom-
plished, after a little delay in getting them to take the water. The natives
did not molest us throughout the day, and in the afternoon I disposed of the
few clothes belonging to the men lately deceased, as some of us were sadly in
want of a fresh supply.
Friday , 26 th. Bulloo. ?The day passed very quietly, no natives appearing,
Saturday , 27 th. Bulloo. ?This morning, fortunately, no one went after
the cattle, as the horses were quietly feeding within sight, and the camels
came home with great regularity at sunset, camping close to the stockade.
The stores were all unpacked, and, after the rat-holes had been mended,
replaced in their former position. About 11 o?clock the cry of ?Natives!?
started us to our feet, and every article near the fire was carried into the
stockade with the utmost celerity. On looking out, a body of natives,
numbering between forty and fifty, could be seen advancing towards us from
the west, not seeking any cover, but marching in good order straight across the
open plain. On this occasion I saw plainly that they meant mischief, as they
were all painted, and bore more spears than we had seen on any former
occasion. Most of them were painted with a deep-red band, from the neck
down the centre of the chest, crossed by similar bands at right angles to it.
When within a couple of hundred yards, they quickened their pace into a run,
exciting each other with war-cries, and placing their arms in position.
? Shirt,? accompanied by two other leaders, was in the van, and despite all
my motions for them to stop, had approached within a few yards of us before
I gave the order to fire. A few discharges repulsed them, but as they collected
again some ! 600 yards off, I fired a rifle at them and effectually dispersed them.
As soon as they disappeared, we visited Mr. Becker in his tent, and found
that he was quite unconscious of any unusual occurrence. I now resolved
to quit Bulloo immediately, as such a small party was quite unfit to maintain
a long contest against the large tribes around, and any men would be picked
off while necessarily absent in search of the camels. I instructed Mr.
Hodgkinson and Smith to get up the camels without delay, and all save
Coppin and Mutwala, which could not be found, were brought in, and tied
around the stockade.
Sunday, 28 th. Bulloo. ?At 6 a.m. Dr. Beckler and Belooch started after
the two missing camels, and succeeded in getting them. The day was passed
in preparing for a start on the following morning?repacking the loads, and
burning all articles of a cumbrous and useless description. The cattle were
kept near the camp all day, and appeared inclined to remain near us.


Monday , 29 th, Bulloo. ?The horses were very troublesome during the
night, perpetually trying to steal away, and, though closely hobbled, more
than once attempting to swim the broad creek. About 3 a.m. a bell was
heard from the south, and a number of dark objects, like cattle, could be
dimly seen through the darkness. When daylight broke these objects were
recognised as forming part of the mob of horses taken on by Mr. Burke, and
shortly afterwards Mr. Brahe came up, and reported that he had just arrived
from Cooper?s Creek, where Mr, Burke bad left him on the 16th of December
in charge of a depot consisting of Patten, McDonough, Botan, six camels, and
twelve horses. Mr. Brahe had received instructions to remain at Cooper?s
Creek for three or four months, but had extended that period to eighteen
weeks, and only left when his rations ran short. Previous to leaving he had
made a cache of provisions, sufficient to enable Mr. Burke and party, if
competent to retrace their steps, to reach the Darling. Mr. Bvahe had not
followed Mr. Burke?s track to Bulloo, but had pursued a direct course, and
reached the 52nd camp of Mr. Burke, eight miles south of my depot, in about
eighty miles. His horses had been 100 hours without water, but travelled
with much less difficulty than could have been hoped for. On proceeding to
Mr. Brahe'?s camp I found Patten suffering from scurvy to an alarming extent,
McDonough almost unable to work, and Botan complaining. Mr. Brahti
placed himself under my orders, and I united the two camps in the course of
the morning. Of the camels brought down by Mr. Brahd I found three?
Beer, Rowa, and Mustana ?suffering severely from scab. The others were in
good condition.
Monday , 29 th. ?At a quarter-past 5 this afternoon Mr. Becker died.
Tuesday , 30 th. Bulloo. ?The night passed quietly, no signs of natives being
near having occurred. Early this morning Mr. Becker was buried, the
stockade pulled down, and the logs used tp form, as far as possible, a pro-
tection to the dead. Mr. Becker?s clothes, bedding, tent, &c., being quite unlit
for use, were burned, and his other effects placed in a pack for conveyance to
Melbourne.
Wednesday, ls� May. Bulloo. ?Saddling commenced at 6 a.m., and at half-
past 10 a.m. we left Bulloo on our return to Menindie. Dr. Beckler, Mr.
Hodgkinsou, Mr. Brahe, Botan, and myself were the only healthy members of
the party ; and I did not see the utility of pushing on the depot to Cooper?s
Creek for the purpose of remaining there the few weeks our stores would last.
Our cavalcade made quite an imposing appearance with its twenty-two horses
and fifteen camels, and the spirits of the whole party were animated by the
prospect of regaining the settled districts. Several stoppages took place during
the day, from the necessity of altering the seat of our invalids or readjusting
loads; and, to show that our departure was not unnoticed by the natives, fires
sprang up at every mile of our progress until we reached Koorliatto, at a
tolerably early hour in the afternoon, Patten was greatly fatigued by his ride.
Thursday , 2nd. Koorliatto. ?Spelled at Koorliatto. Got up a tent for
Patten.
Friday, 3rd. Koorliatto. ?As I was anxious to ascertain before finally
leaving the country whether Mr. Burke had visited the old depot at Cooper?s
Creek between the present date and that on which he left on his advance
northward, or whether the stores cached there had been disturbed by the
natives, I started with Mr. Brahe' and three horses for Cooper?s Creek, and
reached the head waters of that creek on Sunday, the sth, in about seventy
miles, steering about w.n.w. I did not find any water throughout that
distance, but crossed several fine large gum-creeks, and saw an immense
number of native dogs. The remainder of the party stayed at Koorliatto.
Saturday, ith. Koorliatto. ?The party at Koorliatto got up two other
tents for the accommodation of the invalids, and formed a temporary stockade
of camel-saddles, &c. A black fellow visited them during the day.


Sunday, sth. Koorliatto. ?Depot spelled at Koorliatto.
Monday, sth. Koorliatto. ?Depot spelled at Koorliatto. McDonough and
Smith became much worse, and, with Belooch, were unfit for any duty
whatever.
Tuesday, Ith. Koorliatto. ?The depot spelled at Koorliatto.
Wednesday , Bth. Koorliatto. ?This morning I reached the Cooper?s Creek
depot and found no sign of Mr. Burke having visited the creek, or the natives
having disturbed the stores. I therefore retraced my steps to the depot which
remained at Koorliatto.
Thursday, 9th. Koorliatto. ?The depot still spelling here, Simla, one of
Mr." Burke?s camels, strayed during the day, and could not be found.
Friday, 10th. Koorliatto. ?The natives appeared again within sight of the
depot, and one walked through the camp. Mr. Brah4 and myself still en
route for Koorliatto.
Saturday, 11th. Koorliatto. ?The depot still spelling at Koorliatto. Mr.
Brahe and myself en route for the depot.
Sunday, 19th. Koorliatto. ?Mr. Hodgkinson and Botan engaged in search-
ing for Simla, and found that he had lain on the previous night at a place
called the Doctor?s Camp, a little higher up the creek. At 6 p.m. a violent
thunderstorm broke over the camp, during which the absent camel voluntarily
rejoined the mob. Kain continued throughout the night.
Monday, 13 th. Koorliatto. ?l returned to the depot at 8 this morning,
and found the country between it and Cooper?s Creek to be in general well
grassed, but destitute of any permanent water-supply, though, from the
presence throughout my course of numerous wild dogs, pigeons, &c., there
must be water accessible. The country bordering Cooper?s Creek is the most
miserable I have ever seen, and I am at a loss to account for the favourable
impression it has made upon the minds of previous explorers. The creek
itself is bordered by stony rises entirely destitute of herbage, and mud-plains
so fissured as to render travelling over them when dry extremely dangerous,
and so liable to inundation that it would be unsafe to camp upon them for
any length of time. The natives who camped in great numbers while Mr.
Brahe?s depot was there, had disappeared at the period of my visit, and but
four were seen by Mr. Brahe and myself. Our horses had no water from
Friday evening until last evening, when the same thunderstorm that visited
the Koorliatto depot passed over us.
Tuesday, 14 th. Koorliatto. ?The depot prepared for a start, and took down
the tents, &c.
Wednesday, 15 th. Koorliatto. ?Packed stores, &c.; the camels did not
return to camp at night, as was their usual custom, the females, accompanied
by Simla and Bell Sing, staying out.
Thursday, 16 th, to Sunday, 19 th. Koorliatto. Looking for the lost
camels, which were eventually recovered on Sunday, the 19th, by Mr. Brahe
and Belooch, with the exception of Bell Sing, which camel they were unable to
find.
Monday, 20 th. Koorliatto. ?Mr. Brahe and Smith engaged in looking for
Bell Sing, but were unable to find him either on this or Poria Creek, or in the
country lying between. At night they returned, and all the camels were tied
up ready for stalling next morning.
Tuesday, 2,lst. Koorliatto. ?Commenced loading at 6, but did not finish
till 1 p.m., the horses being a considerable distance from the camp, and the
sick requiring great care in their removal. When about to place Patten on a
camel, he stated that he should not feel safe upon the contrivance rigged for
his conveyance ; I therefore gave orders to unpack, and re-camp immediately,
pitching a tent for his convenience. At nightfall only eight of our fifteen
camels returned to the camp.


Wednesday , 22nd. Koorliatto. ?Daring the night the cries of the camels
were heard in the direction of Mr. Burke?s camp on this creek, and at daylight
they were discovered to have passed the night there. Getting them up at
twenty minutes past 12 we effected another start, but had not travelled
above half-a-mile before we were compelled to re-camp, McDonough, who rode
on horseback, fainting from weakness. Finding the camels greatly encum-
bered by the carriage of the sick, I placed 3 cwt. of their loading upon the
horses, which were but lightly burdened,
Thursday, 23 rd. Koorliatto. ?Having made some change in the disposition
of the carriage of the sick, I started at a quarter past 11, and reached a
sandhill twelve miles from Koorliatto, where I camped. During the day?the
horses were watered at a claypan filled by the recent rains. The weather,
which was very cold and windy, prevented the camels from feeling any
inclination to drink. A continual watch was set upon them while feeding.
Friday, 2 A.th. Poria Creek. ?Saddled at dawn. The morning was bitterly
cold and very dark. Got away at a quarter past 10, and after travelling three
miles passed near a large body of natives, who slunk away on observing us.
Our rate of progress with the camels was very slow, Patten frequently
entreating me to stop, as the motion pained him. At 4 p.m. Poria Creek was
sighted, and half an hour subsequently we camped within a mile of Mr. Burke?s
50th camp, keeping watch all night.
Saturday , 25 1h May, to ls< June. Poria Creek. ?During the period thus
included, the depot remained at Poria Creek, partly in the hope of recruiting
the weak, and partly to prepare for the country between here and Torowotto,
as I could not hope for water between these points, unless rain fell. For a
few days I had some hope of a serviceable fall of rain, as heavy clouds passed
to the southward, and a few drops occasionally fell near the camp. The
camels all became affected with the scab, and one of them died from its
effects. I made several searches after Bell Sing without avail, and on the
28th Mr. Brahe' and Botan started with the camels fit for service to take on
water two days? journey towards Torowotto, and on the 31st they returned;
Mr. Brahe reporting that he had deposited the water six miles north of
Karriapundi Swamp, which appeared to be quite dry. While searching for
Bell Sing, I several times met a small body of natives, camped down the
creek, and presented them with a tomahawk in return for some fish which
they gave me. Patten appeared slightly improved by his stay at Poria, and
McDonough and Belooch were decidedly better. Weather exceedingly cold.
Sunday, 2nd. Karriapundi Plain. ?At 4 a.m. all hands were called, and
at 9 o?clock we started for our next water dependence, Torowotto, 118 miles
distant. Smith and McDonough, who were much better, rode on horseback.
Botan conducted the camels, and Dr. Beckler and Mr, Hodgkinson escorted
Patten and Belooch, who were carried by Jambel. After great and frequent
delays, caused by the necessity of adjusting pillows, &c., for Patten, the camp
was pitched fifteen miles from Poria Creek. The camels were watched while
feeding till 9 p.m., and then tied up.
Monday, 3 rd. Karriapundi. ?At 2 a.m. the camels were fed and watched,
and at 8 a start effected. Patten, who fancied he could ride Simla with
greater ease, being placed upon that animal, I started with the horses some
time after the camels, overtaking them at 1 p.m. I learned from Dr. Beckler
that Patten had been incessantly moaning since leaving the camp, and begging
that we might stop. This request, with no prospect of water before reaching
Torowotto, except that we had sent on, was not to be listened to, however
much to be regretted ; and, after attempting to console the poor fellow as far as
possible, I gave orders to Dr. Beckler not to allow any delays under any
circumstances whatever. Soon after Patten became delirious, insisting that
we had brought him on to kill him, and begging to be allowed to die where


he then was. Under these painful circumstances, the party proceeded till a
quarter to 6, when I reached the spot where Mr. Brahe had deposited the
water. 1 was alarmed to find that a great portion of the water had leaked
out, and issued one bucket to each horse and camel. We had very little rest
throughout the night, as the horses kept hanging about the water, and, at
twenty minutes to 12, I ordered the camels to be loosed, in order to give
them every chance of feeding. Heavy rain-clouds hung over us for many
hours, and a few drops disappointed our hopes of a greater fall.
Tuesday, 4 th. Karriapundi. ?At a quarter to 8 started, and, travelling
without stoppage till sunset, reached a spot twelve miles north of Rat Point;
finding there to our great surprise a fine pool of water. Half a mile previously
to reaching it, Burra, one of the sick camels, fell down, and, evidently being
unable to travel, was left behind. Patten travelled in nearly an insensible
condition all day. The weather was bitterly cold, and a tent was pitched at
night immediately we arrived at camp for his accommodation. The feed was
very luxuriant, and the camels were allowed to remain loose all night.
Wednesday, sth. Bat Point. ?The unexpected meeting with water induced
me to delay a little this morning, for the purpose of giving all those desirous
of doing so the opportunity of a good wash, and it was twenty minutes to
11 before a start was effected. While saddling, an unusual number of
native dogs were noticed hunting round the water, and regarding the camels
with great curiosity. My intention on leaving camp was to camp at Rat
Point," as I confidently expected to find water in the hole I had previously
discovered when leaving Torowotto. On arriving at the spot, however, so
circumscribed was the area covered by the late rainfall, I found no traces of
water, and camped 5 miles nearer Torowotto. Patten was all day insensible,
and unconscious of any change in his position.
Thursday, 6 th. Mud-Plains, ?At 4 a.m. it was found that Patten had died
during the night, and Mr. Brah<s and myself dug a grave for him by firelight.
As soon as his funeral could be performed, the party started for the hole dug
by Dr. Beckler and Mr. Hodgkinson during their stay at Rat Point, and
reached it at 1 o?clock, finding abundance of water in the vicinity.
Friday, Ith. Torowotto. ?A great improvement was discernible in the
health of the men. Smith, Belooch, and McDonough, the former especially,
were able to work a little, and Botan was the only man in very bad health.
At an hour before sunset the horses reached Torowotto, but not a drop of
water could be found in any part of the swamp. This was a great disappoint-
ment, as I had certainly calculated upon finding a supply, and was unwilling
to send the camels backward and forward as water-carriers. There was a
strong probability of rain from the appearance of the sky, and during the
evening and night sufficient fell to afford us a tolerably good stock of water.
Saturday, B th. Torowotto. ?Spelled at Torowotto. Put up two tents for
protection against the rain, which fell intermittingly throughout the day.
Sunday , 9 th. Torowotto. ?Spelled at Torowotto. Packed up for a start.
Intermittent showers throughout the day.
Monday, 10 th. Paldromatta Creek. ?Started at twenty-five minutes past
9 a.m. Camped at Paldromatta at a quarter to 8 p.m. No water in the creek,
but passed a little on the road.
Tuesday, 11 th. Wannaminta. ?Started at fifteen minutes past 8 a.m. ;
travelled sixteen miles, and camped at a claypan near the creek, which was
erroneously named Teltawinge in the first part of the diary,
Wednesday, 12 th. Wannaminta. ?Started at 2 p.m. with the camels, as
they strayed during the night. Met some natives who had accompanied Mr.
Burke to Torowotto, and accepted their services as guides to a shallow rocky
water-hole, eight miles from our last camp.
Thursday, 13 th. Teltawinge. ?Started at a quarter to 10, and reached


water in Tirltawinge Creek, formerly marked on the diary as Wannaminta, at
4 p.m. Tracks of kangaroo abundant, whence the name of the creek, Tirlta
signifying kangaroo. Not expecting water at the next creek (Nuntherunge),
I had a couple of bags filled for a supply. The natives remained near us, and
were very solicitous to assist us.
Friday , 14 th. Nuntherunge. ?On leaving Teltawinge I made several
presents to our black friends, and took one of them, a youth of some fifteen
years of age, on with the party. We reached Nuntherunge at an early hour
in the afternoon, and found the bed of the creek quite dry, but, by sinking a
couple of feet, obtained sufficient water for camels, horses, and bathing
purposes. Splendid feed on the creek.
Saturday, 15 th, to Friday, 21 st. Nuntherunge. ?After camping at Nanta-
bulla or Hobson?s Basin, and Wotwinge?two gorges amply supplied with
water, in the Motanie Ranges?l proceeded to Batoja; and finding no water
there, and only sufficient for the camels at Bilpa, pushed on with the horses to
Coorkerega, or Kokriega, from whence, after remaining two days, 1 reached the
Darling on the 18 th instant; the camels arrived on the following day. Ex-
periencing heavy rain-storms at Bilpa, and between Coorkerega, or Kokriega,
and the river, I established the depot camp in its former situation at the
junction of Panamoroo Creek with the Darling. I had the honour, on the Friday
following, to despatch Mr. Brahe with a summary of this diary, and Mr.
Burke?s despatches, addressed to the Committee ; and I trust that the celerity
with which I forward the messenger will be sufficient excuse for its imper-
fect compilation and clerical deficiencies.
W. Wright, Officer in Charge.
William Brahe's Report.
(Received Ist July, 1861.)
To the Eon. Secretary, Exploration Committee, Melbourne.
Melbourne, 30th June, 1861.
Sir, ? I have the honour to report to you, for the information of the Committee,
that on the 16th of December last Mr. Burke gave me charge of the depot
formed by hjm at Cooper?s Creek, and started for Eyre?s Creek, en route for
the Gulf of Carpentaria, at 6-40 a.m. on the same day. His party consisted
of himself, Mr. Wills, King, and Gray. He took with him six camels and
one horse. The party was provided with provisions for twelve weeks. I
accompanied the party for a distance of twenty-two miles along the water-
course of the creek. The party remaining at the depot consisted of myself,
Patten, McDonough, and Dost Mahommed. My instructions, received by
word of mouth, were to remain at the depot three months, or longer, if
provisions and other circumstances would permit. I left the party at 4 o?clock
p.m. on the same day and returned to the depot. On the following day, the
17th December, we commenced cutting timber, for the purpose of erecting
a stockade.
22 nd December.- r?Natives, about twenty-five in number, approached the
camp, but I considered it advisable not to allow them to come near the tents.
30 th. ?On several days during the week were annoyed by number of
natives. On Wednesday they succeeded in stealing six camel pack-bags,
which we had washed that morning and spread out on the turf on the water?s
edge to dry. The thief, by keeping under shelter of the high bank, escaped
unobserved. Noticing the loss only late in the afternoon I did not think it
advisable to go in pursuit. During the night of Thursday I observed two
blacks within a hundred yards of the camp, but on my shouting to them they
ran off. On the 23rd finished the stockade, 20 by 18 feet, and put up Mr.


Burke?s tent within it. In this tent I kept the ammunition and firearms.
From within the stockade we had the other tents and the camels, which were
kept tied up at night, under cover of our guns.
31s#.?Observed some blacks stealing stealthily along the hank of the
creek towards the camp, while one directed them from behind a big tree. I
allowed them to come to within twenty paces of the camp, when suddenly
I called out to them, we at the same time firing off our guns over their heads.
They seemed much frightened and hardly able to run away. Great numbers
of blacks camped near us.
6th January, 1861.?A large number of natives came to the camp, whose
demeanour roused my suspicions. Got hold of a young native and shoved
him off, when he fell down. In the afternoon the whole tribe returned, the
men armed, some with spears and some with boomerangs : most of them had
painted their faces and bodies. I met them at a short distance from the
camp ; and, marking a circle round it, I gave them to understand that they
would be fired at if they entered it. On some of them crossing the line I
fired off my gun into the branches of a tree, when they retired, and did not
molest us any more.
24#/i December [sic], ?I should like to explore the neighbourhood a little,
but cannot safely leave the camp for longer than three or four hours; one of
the men looking after the camels the greater part of the day, while the other
is away from four to five hours daily to prevent the horses from straying. I
should" have mentioned that 1 had charge of six camels and twelve horses, two
of the camels very scabby. Grass is getting very dry and scarce near the
camp. We are obliged to hang all our stores on boughs of trees to protect
them from the rats, of which we killed about forty every night for some time.
2 6th February. ?I rode up a conical hill bearing north-west by north from
the depot. It is distant about nine miles, and one of a chain of hills running
north-east and south-west. From the top of this hill I saw another range,
distant about fifteen to twenty miles, much broken and considerably higher
than the one I was on. The country between the two is stony, like that
between the first range and the depot.
Ist March. ?Natives less numerous. Looking out anxiously for Mr. Burke?s
return. One day I took a ride up the creek which joins Cooper?s Creek
opposite our camp, coming from e.s.e., following it up about six miles, and
found bed and banks thickly timbered with myall. The country in that
direction is very stony. From the top of a stony rise I saw a low range
running east and west, distant about fifteen miles. Blacks passing now and
then, offering us nets and fish; we made it a rule never to accept the least
thing from them, but made some of them little presents, as left-off clothes.
15th. ?About twenty-five natives with their families passed here last night
on their way up the creek, offering nets and fish. They gave me to understand
that there would be plenty of water in the creek shortly, and that we might
swim on the flat the stockade was on.
Is# April. ?During the first twenty-four days of March the heat has been
greater than might be expected for the season, and especially the nights were
intolerably sultry, a great deal more so than the warmest of January. On
the 24th there was a sudden change : it began to blow hard, the nights became
very cool. On the evening of the 29th we observed lightning in all quarters,
and heard thunder in the north. A slight shower of rain fell between 8 and
9 o?clock p.m., and another on the following morning, not sufficient, however, to
lay the dust. The blacks stole a camel pack-saddle from us on the 27th,
while I was away from the camp. They carried it about a mile down the
creek, where Patten overtook them and recovered the saddle, but it was tom
to pieces.


\th. ?Patten commenced shoeing the horses, lest he might become incapaci-
tated by disease, as he felt very unwell.
Patten, after shoeing two horses, was obliged to take to his bed, suffering
acute pain, and was not afterwards able to move about.
15 th. ?Patten is getting worse. McDonough and I began to feel alarming
symptoms of the same disease.
IHth. ?There is no probability of Mr. Burke returning this way. Patten is
in a deplorable state, and desirous of being removed to the Darling to obtain
medical assistance, and our provisions will soon be reduced to a quantity
insufficient to take us back to the Darling, if the trip should turn out difficult
and tedious. Being also sure that I and McDonough would not much longer
escape scurvy, I, after most seriously considering all circumstances, made up
my mind to start for the Darling on Sunday next, the 21st. The horses have
lately got into the habit of straying ; missed five of them a few days ago, and
found them about fifteen miles from the camp. Last Monday we had a
welcome rain for the first time since Bth December (except some slight showers
on 24th and 25th March). The last three days have been fine and cool, but
now it again looks like rain, although the barometer is very high?higher,
indeed, than it has been during our stay here.
2\st. ?Left the depot at 10 o?clock a.m., leaving 50 lbs. of flour, 50 lbs. of
oatmeal, 50 lbs. of sugar, and 30 lbs. of rice buried near the stockade, at the
foot of a large tree, and marked the word ? dig? on the tree. I took 150 lbs.
of flour, 75 lbs. of sugar, about 70 lbs. of oatmeal, 1 bag of rice, 4 lbs. of tea,
and a small quantity of biscuits. Taking into consideration that we would be
obliged to travel slowly on account of Patten, and on account of the scarcity
of water which I calculated to have to contend with, and would probably be
on the road to the Darling at least six or seven weeks, I considered that 1 could
not take less provisions. Patten was placed on a quiet camel. We travelled
very slowly, and halted at 5 o?clock p.m,, having made about fourteen miles.
22nd. ?Started at 8 o?clock, and reached Camp 63 (Rat?s Hole) at 1130
a.m., finding the frame of a camel pack-saddle stuck in a tree. We had put
away the saddle in some bushes when we abandoned the place on account of
the rats, but the natives had found it. Halted at Camp 62,
23rd. ?Were visited by about seventy or eighty natives, some of them old
acquaintances. Threw away a bag of camel-shoes to lighten the burthens of
the two sick camels. Travelled twenty-eight miles, and halted at Camp 60.
Splendid grass in bed of creek.
24:th. ?Filled two pair of water-bags with water, and started for Bulloo at
12*30 p.m., going e.s.e. Finding a little water and plenty of good grass, halted
at 5 p.m. Was compelled to throw away nine pair of water-bags to be able to
carry water. Finest country in the neighbourhood of Cooper?s Creek.
25 th. ?Started at 8 a.m. From eleven o?clock passed over very stony
country. Three o?clock, stony range. Halted at 6*15 p.m., between ranges
without water or grass.
26 th. ?Having kept a careful watch over the camels and horses, we were
enabled to start at 6*30 a.m. Till 11 o?clock very stony and scrubby
country to pass over. When clear of ranges, followed an e.s.e. course, crossing
several creeks without water running; south-west bank of creeks thickly
timbered with gum. The creeks looked likely to contain some water, but
pushed on without searching for it. At 3 p.m. came upon sandy, well-grassed
and thinly-timbered country; saw a variety of birds, as pigeons, crows, &c.;
halted at a creek, probably McDonough?s Creek. We had to watch our cattle
closely the whole night, as want of water made them inclined to ramble, and
they showed no inclination to feed.
27 th. ?Started at 6*4 a.m., taking an east by south course, as the appearance


?of the ranges to the north and north-east led me to believe that I had kept
rather too much to the south. I continued on this course till 9 a.m., when I
got a glimpse of a high ridge, which 1 recognised as the western boundary
ridge of the Bulloo Plains. Went east till 10 a.m., then east by north, and
arrived at the Bulloo Creek, at Camp 52, at 1'45 p.m. When crossing Mr.
Burke?s old track I noticed fresh tracks of horses and camels going in different
directions,which were not more than ten to twelve days old, and I conjectured
that the party left at Menindie had been at Bulloo, or were there still. As I
could not expect to find water down the creek, I followed up our old track,
knowing that there must be water in a large channel which we had passed
on our way to Cooper?s Creek, about five miles from Camp 52. At 4 p.m, I
reached several small but deep water-holes with plenty of water, and camped
there. We had much trouble to keep the horses from plunging into the water,
most of them having had no water for exactly 100 hours. I decided upon
remaining there the whole of the following day, not only to refresh the cattle,
but also to search for traces of the Darling party.
28th. ?Went very early in search of the horses up the creek. At about
daylight I got in sight of them, at the same time observing smoke rising
within 300 yards from me, and near the horses. There was not light enough
to see well, and I thought I had dropped upon a camp of natives, and resolved
to try to obtain some information from them respecting the Darling party.
After going a few yards farther, I saw to my great surprise a European
advance towards me. It was Mr. Hodgkinson. He led me to Mr. Wright?s
camp ; and after bringing in our party, with horses and camels, &c., I placed
myself and party under the orders of Mr. Wright.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
William Brahe.
XXVll. ?Route in Exploring a Road from Albernie Canal to
Nanaimo, in Vancouver Island, in May, 1861, with a Track
Chart. By Commander Richard C. Mayne, r.n., f.r.g.s.
[Communicated by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.]
Read, May 12, 1862.
To Captain Gr. H. Richards, b.n., f.r.g.s., H.M.S. Hecate.
Sir, h.m.s. Hecate, Vancouver Island, May, 1861.
I have the honour to inform you that, in compliance with
your orders, I left the Albernie settlement at 10 on the morning
of the 29th of April, with six Indians, one man from the Hecate,
and Mr. Bamfield, the Indian agent. After crossing the low coast-
ridge we passed over about 2 miles of level land, and then com-
menced a gradual ascent, and continued to ascend till we camped,
?our camp being about 800 feet above the sea. During the latter
part of the day the old hunter, who was the leader among the
Indians, had been edging more to the northward than I liked; and
I explained that we wanted to pass between Mounts Arrowsmith
and Moriarty, and pointed it out on the chart to him. He insisted
that if we went that way we should have to cross snow mountains,
