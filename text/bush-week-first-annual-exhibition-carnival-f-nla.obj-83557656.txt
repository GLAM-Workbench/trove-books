Many New Ideas
For Decorating the Interior
Of The Home
Our unlimited Colour Schemes in Wallpaper, designed for
every room in the house, are worthy of inspection before completing
your “Bush Week” festivities.
We screen in our Showroom as many designs as possible in
such a manner that intending purchasers can see readily what colours
would harmonise with their present furnishings.
Wallpapers make a perfect decoration, being attractive and
of great service to cracked and faulty walls.
Our pretty “Cut-out Friezes” hung under the picture rail give
excellent results, particularly to lovers of colour. Make your selec-
tion this week, or write for book of patterns.
THE WOOD-FINISH FOR YOUR BUNGALOW :
LACKLUSTRE
A stain and finish combined. A treatment occasionally with
Lacklustre will keep the interior woodwork in excellent condition.
It is easily applied, and dries with a slight gloss finish. Lacklustre

SHEEP STATION CYCLORAMA.
Wool being our most valuable staple, we naturally give prominence to the wool-
raising industry in this pictorial representation.
SHEARING SHED CYCLORAMA.
• Here is graphically shown the most modern method of shearing the wool from the
sheep.
SUGAR CANE CYCLORAMA.
So much of this State is adaptable to growing special tropical products that the
sugar cane industry is making great headway and proving a very profitable undertaking to
those who adopt up-to-date methods.
WHEAT FARM CYCLORAMA.
Next to wool, wheat is one of our most important primary products. The wheat
yield in N.S.W. sometimes approaching phenomenal proportions. Modern methods of wheat
culture include the use of tractor drawn ploughs and self-contained tractor driven strippers
and harvesters.
VINEYARD CYCLORAMA.
The winemaking industry in New South Wales promises to be an industry of great
national importance. During the war period wines from the Hunter River and from
Corowa were used in all big hospitals, and, generally speaking, the wines made a great
name for themselves. The result is that now the demand is unlimited. The Government
is settling returned men on vineyard areas, a true indication that viticulture is regarded as
a safe and profitable undertaking. The chief varieties are: —Port, Chablis, Sherry, Hock,
Burgundy and Champagne.
ORCHARD CYCLORAMA.
New South Wales, in addition to its many other productions, can offer a selection
of the finest of fruits, and every house which has even a small plot of ground nearby should
•cultivate several fruit trees. Fruit culture on a big scale is being entered into in many parts
of this State, and is producing very good returns for those who seriously take up this phase
in primary production. Fruit culture will be even more profitable when each of our large
country centres have on the spot canning or preserving works which will allow of the fruit
to be preserved in all its pristine freshness.
MODEL TOWN CYCLORAMA.
Many of our country towns, and cities, too, for that matter, were put up without any
preconceived plan or design. This cyclorama is staged for the purpose of fostering a more
picturesque surrounding for the dwellers in our country centres.
WORKING EXHIBIT.
HAND WEAVING OF TWEEDS.
The Australian Red Cross Society have for some years been finding occupation for
returned soldiers in this interesting and profitable industry, and here is given a practical
demonstration of how the Red Cross tweeds which you get from your tailor are woven
from the wool produced in this State.
IRRIGATED FARM CYCLORAMA.
Nothing is so necessary in this State as wide developments of the Irrigation and
Water Conservation scheme, which finds it pictorial expression in the cyclorama devoted to
this subject. What was once practically a barren plain in dry seasons along the Murrum-
bidgee River is now a land flowing with milk and honey, a green oasis which delights the
eye and fills the pocket of those who live in this favoured region which is able to produce
almost everything the State can grow all the year round.

POULTRY FARM CYCLORAMA.
The poultry industry is worth annually £3,000,000 to the State of N.S.W. It has
made the most rapid strides of any primary industry during recent years. Ihe Govern-
ment and the people have always combined to promote the welfare of the poultry farmers
Laying tests and utility experiments are conducted regularly at the Hawkesbury Agricultural
College. Numbers of returned soldiers are now engaged poultry farming. Ihe Gyclo-
rama shows a model poultry farm.
CITROUS FRUITS CYCLORAMA.
Citrous fruits of all kinds, particularly oranges and lemons, grow profusely all over
the State, where sufficient moisture and the right soil is available. The cultivation of fruits
suitable for marmalade and preserving generally is an extension of the industry that is re-
ceiving considerable attention.
DAIRY FARM CYCLORAMA.
From a very obscure position in the list of exports dairy farm produce, and par-
ticularly butter and cheese, have reached such magnitude that they now rank high in the
list of primary products exported from this State. No less than four hundred factories,
mostly on a co-operation basis, exist in N.S.W., notwithstanding which there is always an
unsatisfied market for dairy farm products.
SOLDIERS’ SETTLEMENT CYCLORAMA.
The most important part of the Repatriation Department is the Soldiers Settlement
Branch in securing suitable farms and land for farms on which to place our soldiers who
have returned in numbers from Europe. A number of these are located in different parts
of this State. It will be noted that the cultivation of tropical and sub-tropical fruit is an
activity that is receiving much attention, since there is always a keen demand for t”® B ®
throughout the State. Over 5,934,303 acres have already been made available, and 6,319
farms have already been made available, including poultry farms, vineyards, general fruit-
growing, sheep and pig raising, and tropical fruit raising, which latter forms the subject of
our cyclorama.

This is also an exhibit that should on no account be missed, since it is practically
a complete indication in actual form of the many agricultural products of this State. The
Agricultural Department have also given every assistance within their power to make this
Exhibition a complete success, and in addition to supplying the produce seen on this ex-
hibit, have also equipped several of the smaller stands, and also the fine display at the
“Bush Week Bureau” Offices at 772 George Street.
N.S.W. FORESTRY COMMISSION.
Midway betwen the Mineral Court and the Agricultural Court will be found a very
comprehensive display of the utility timbers of this State which, according to report, are
more appreciated outside the border than in the State itself.
T ABORIGINES PROTECTION BOARD

and Druitt Streets visitors will find a practical demonstration of the Manual
Training Work that is being accomplished by the Aborigines Protection BoaißjLthe vari-
ous Training Schools throughout N.S.W. Here the visitors may purchase for sum
such quaint souvenirs as Shell Work, Wooden Nick Nacks, Spears, Boomerangs, Nulla
Nullas, and other weapons of a more or less interesting nature. Most of these souvenirs
are for sale, the proceeds of which go to the school or training centre in which they were
made for the further extension of their educational activities among our fast dwindling black
race.

GAS AND FUEL STOVES.
EXHIBITOR: JAMES WARD, LIMITED, 372 PITT STREET.
The industry manufactures Gas and Fuel Cooking Stoves and Ranges from the raw material into
the finished article.
The Gas Stoves are made with open or closed tops, the latter being very economical in the con-
sumption of gas. All the ovens are lined with porcelain enamel, the top plates are highly polished, also
mountings on oven doors. All taps are fitted with regulating burners and compare very favourably with
the imported article. Made in Australia, with Australian material.
The majority of the hotels in all the capital cities of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand have
been fitted up by us, as well as most of the transports, interstate and coastal steamers.
Copper work in all its branches, from Coppers to large Jam Pans, as well as Hot Water
installations, are also displayed.
SULPHIDE CORPORATION, LTD.
SELLING AGENTS: GIBBS, BRIGHT & CO., 37 PITT STREET, SYDNEY
The up-to-date farmer knows that to get the best results from the soil he must fertilise, and the
scientific methods of fertilisation are among the outstanding features of modern agriculture.
The attention of visitors is directed to the very comprehensive exhibit of fertilisers shown by
The Sulphide Corporation, Ltd. Foremost amongst the fertilisers exhibited is the well-known wheat
grower, Sulphide Superphosphate, which is extensively used by wheatgrowers throughout New South
Wales.
Sulphide Superphosphate is manufactured at Cockle Creek from the highest grade phosphate
rock, which is brought in its faw state from Ocean and Nauru Islands in the Pacific. Samples of phos-
phate rock are shown in the exhibit,.
The three main plant foods required by the various crops grown by the farmer and orchardist
are Phosphoric Acid, Nitrogen and Potash. These plants foods are taken up in varying quantities by
the different crops, and it is the expert knowledge of what proportion of the different plant foods the
various crops require which results in scientifically blended fertilisers.
Amongst the numerous special fertilisers exhibited by the Sulphide Corporation mention may
be made of Nitro Super (for hay and green fodder crops), Bone and Super, Orchard Manure, Potato
Manure, Maize Manure, Root Crop Manure, etc., etc.
The Sulphide Corporation are also manufacturers of high grade Bluestone (Sulphate of Copper),
some fine samples of which are shown. This is used extensively for spraying, wheat pickling, etc.
The Selling Agents for the Sulphide Corporation, Ltd., are Messrs.. Gibbs, Bright & Co., of 37 Pitt

COUNTRY HOUSE SANITATION.
EXHIBITORS: WALES & BOWER, 107 CASTLEREAGH STREET, SYDNEY
The problem of the outhouse has long been a worry to those who live in unsewered districts.
Aside from the elements of refinement and fastidiousness there is always the question of health to be
considered. Many are the expedients which have been resorted to in order that the customary evils
of bad sanitation might be minimised—yet the average unsewered outhouse is, to-day, both obnoxious
and extremely unhealthy.
The "Walbow” is a method of dealing with the problem which has proved economical, efficient
and absolutely reliable. It takes the form of a well-made Cabinet or Pedestal which complies with the
latest ordinance of the Board of Health..
AUSTRALIAN FURS.
EXHIBITOR: G. F. BROOKS, 244 PITT STREET.
In this exhibit will be found a varied array of fur garments —coats, wraps, stoles, capes, muffs
and motor coats made from beautiful Australian and imported skins; for Australia, owing to its climate,
is not so well provided with furred animals as are some of the less temperate countries. The prices
recently realised by rabbit skins in American and Continental markets has placed quite a premium on
the skin of bunny, and will probably go a long way towards exterminating this pest. The whole of this
.exhibit was dyed, dressed and tanned in Australia by Australian workmen.
HEALTH FOODS, CEREALS AND FRUIT.
EXHIBITOR: NATURAL FOOD CO., LTD., 241 ELIZABETH STREET, SYDNEY.
Now that wheat is so far above the “dollar mark” in price, it is not only hygienically but also
sound practice to use as much of the giain as possible. It has long been recognised that
the glutens in the covering of wheat has highly nutritive qualities, and as evidence of the growing popu-
larity of whole meal food this company, which commenced business a little over three years ago, have
mow four branches in other parts of the city, which all cater for a growing demand in this class of food
stuffs. Sultanas, raisins, lexias, prunes and others of our products are all used in various varieties
.of products of this company. You can learn more of the advantages of a wholemeal diet from the
/booklet available on this stall, entitled “The Whole of the Wheat.

GUMLYPTA EUCALYPTUS. •
EXHIBITORS: GILLARD, GORDON, LIMITED, 13 BRIDGE STREET, SYDNEY.
This purely Australian industry was established quite sixty years ago, and has to-day developed
into three divisions, or spheres, of usefulness medical, industrial and perfumery. Many will be interested
to learn that there are over 500 different classified types of Eucalyptus more or less valuable, though
only about 14 are being commercially exploited. The industry is still in its initial stages, and there is ample
room for expansion, for it should be classed among our valuable primary industries.
SMALL DAIRY AND FARM SEPARATORS.
EXHIBITORS: DIABOLO SEPARATOR CO., LTD., KENT AND MARKET STREETS, SYDNEY. ,
The display of the DIABOLO SEPARATOR COY. during Bush Week is confined to two types 6f
machines the DIABOLO DAIRY No. 0 and the DIABOLO SEPARATOR No. 00, 10 gallons; No. U,
30 gallons; No. 2, 50 gallons; No. 3, 82 gallons.
The DIABOLO DAIRY is a wonderful innovation introduced by the DIABOLO SEPARATOR CO.,
and is really a separator and a churn combined. It not only does separating, but with a slight change
over of the bowl it churns the cream into well-preserved butter with the utmost ease. It is really a
butter factory in miniature, and is being welcomed with open arms by small dairy farmers and house-
holders in general. In fact, any one who keeps a cow can save money and reduce the cost of living
with this compact little plant.

Progressive Districts in N. S.W
whose Primary Products are being shown in Sydney this week,
February 9lh to 17th (inclusive), 1920
BATLOW.
Now, there is only one thing that Batlow wants to make the district big and pros-
perous. That is a railway, and only Imiles of it at that. The Country Promotion League
thinks that such a rich locality should have a railway, and is going to try hard to bring it
about. Some of the finest fruit that comes to Sydney comes from Batlow, and its timber
resources are almost unlimited and in great variety. Mountain ash from this district is now
being manufactured into axe handles and implement handles of all kinds, and are said to be
better than the best imported. There is now a soldiers’ settlement on the area, and soon
the productions of the district will be doubled. But, says the oldest inhabitant, just you
wait till we get a railway, then things will roll along at 60 miles an hour. Let us get a rail-
way for Batlow.
CROOKWELL.
Population 1,600, district 4,093. 172 miles South-West from Sydney, on branch line
from Goulburn (36 miles). Chief products: Wool, oats, hay, potatoes, butter, and fruit
(principally apples and cherries), 2,910 feet above sea-level, bracing climate. Two dairy
factories, flour mill, two freezing works and machine brickworks.
Anyone desiring particularly to take up potato growing or apple and pear growing
should give Crookwell a look up. It is famed for the products named.
DUNEDOO.
Situated about 240 miles North-West from Sydney on the Wallerawang-Mudgee and
Coonabarabran line, and is situated about 50 miles North-West of Mudgee. Although
only a new district, it is growing wonderfully quick. It is an important wheat-growing dis-
trict. Increasing areas are being put under wheat each year. It is also an important mineral
district. There are a number of silver and copper mines being developed, and it promises
to be a very important mining centre. It is also an important stock centre. Regular sheep
and cattle sales are held. The town of Dunedoo has a population of 700, and is growing
rapidly. The district has a population of 3,000.
DUNGOG. I
Population 1,500, district 10,000. By rail, 156 miles from Sydney, along the
North Coast Railway; 34 miles from West Maitland. Since the arrival and extension of
the railway the district has gone ahead wonderfully. District is chiefly agricultural and
dairying. Cattle, butter, pigs, timber, citrus fruits, apples, maize, lucerne. Seven dairy
factories and number of timber mills.
GILGANDRA.
Population 2,500. On Castlereagh River, Dubbo-Coonamble Railway; 60 miles from
Coonamble, 40 from Dubbo, and 290 North-West from Sydney. Important pastoral, farm-
ing and timber centre.
The people of Gilgandra possess great pride of place. It was from this town that
the “Coo-ees” began. The folk of Gilgandra also pride themselves on the fact that 764
brave boys went to the front out of a total population of 5,000. Prune-growing and grape-
growing promises to be a big industry, and for this purpose the Government has purchased
“Rosewood,” a highly suitable property adjacent to the railway.
GOSFORD.
Population 2,500, district 6,000. By rail 54 miles from Sydney on main Northerti
line, on shores of Brisbane Water, and half-way between Sydney and Newcastle. One of
principal tourist resorts in New South Wales. All trains running North from Sydney stop
at Gosford, railway refreshment rooms second largest in New South Wales. Chief indus-
tries: Dairying, timber-cutting and fruit growing—citrus, stone and passion fruits. Rainfall
50 inches per annum.
It is said that Gosford has some of the finest citrus groves in the world, and it is
about time that we knew it, and that it could supply the whole of New South Wales with
vegetables. The soil is there, but more farmers are wanted. The local Country Promotion
League will extend the hand of welcome to all intending settlers.

Electricity has brought prosperity to
hundreds of farms throughout the
world. Electric service means “horse-
power” instead of “man power. Elec-
tric power brings abundant crops, more
leisure, greater profits and lighter
labour.
In dry sections proper irrigation will
more than double crops. G.E.

pumps, and can also be used to
drive various farm machines. G.E.

GRENFELL. _
Population 3,500, district 15,000. Distant from rail, via Blayney, 272
miles; also connected by rail South, via Young, and with Forbes-StC c ki n bingal line. Im-
portant grazing and agricultural district. Products: Wheat, wool, oats, cdTTI, b a y*

Grenfell possesses folk of the “get together” kind whenever any movement toddles
into the town, for the district’s good. There is no need to ring the breakfast bell—every-
one is up bright and early. Grenfell is the town that claims to have first started the Bush

HUNTER RIVER DISTRICT.
The Hunter River district is famous, particularly for the high-class wines which are
made from the grapes grown on its sun-kissed hills. You will only want to see its exhibit in
Bebarfald s to be impressed with its possible future greatness of the wine-growing industry.
All over the world Hunter River wines are acclaimed among the best that the world produces.

pany in the world. There are several smaller co-operative and proprietary establishments.
The butter and bacon factories distribute over £3,000,000 annually. The timber industry
is a very extensive one; immense quantities of hardwood and pine are exported. Beef
production is carried on extensively, and one of the largest meat preserving companies
operates in the district. The exportation of vegetable and poultry products is considerable.
Lismore has direct rail communication with Grafton (70 miles), south, and Murwillumbah
on the Tweed River, north (60 miles). A very complete telephone service links up the
whole of the towns throughout this vast district. Lismore has one of the most up-to-date
sewerage systems in the State; it is municipally controlled, as also are the water supply,
gas works, and sale yards. Electric light is supplied by a private company. One of the
principal State Experimental Farms is situated a few miles from Lismore; it is famous by
reason of the fact that its stud of pure-bred Guernsey cattle is one of the largest in the
world. Official stock returns December 31, 1917: —Lismore-Tweed: Horses 20,980, cattle
271,708. Richmond Electorate: Horses 35,158, cattle 456,747.
Now such evidence of wealth must make you blink. Lismore says; “Go north for
cattle, corn and cash.” Sounds sound advice, doesn’t it?
LITHGOW.
Population 14,500, district 40,000. Flourishing mining and manufacturing town,
95 miles West of Sydney; in the valley at the foot of the Great Railway Zig Zag on the
Western slope of the Blue Mountains. Contains five collieries, large iron and steel works,
coke, shale and oil works, copper smelting works, and brick works, potteries and tweed
mills. The celebrated Eskbank Ironworks are a feature of the industries. Pig iron, bar, sheet
iron, and steel of the best quality are manufactured from native ores. Commonwealth
Small Arms Factory is in the vicinity. Gold, silver, copper found in neighbourhood. Sum-
mer climate delightful. Apples, pears, peaches, quinces grown.
MITTAGONG.
The folk of Mittagong will tell you that they have the finest climate in Australia; then
they will tell you that the soil ‘‘licks creation.” Both are good, very good, and the district
being only a few hours’ run from Sydney by train, why not see for yourself?
NARRANDERA.
Population 2,400, district 15,000. On Murrumbidgee River, at the junction of
Hay and Jerilderie branches of South-West Railway; 347 miles South-West from Sydney,
and on the main Northern Murrumbidgee Irrigation Canal, the irrigation area commencing
on the Western boundary of the municipality. Yanco is distant 1 3 miles, Leeton 17. Noted
pastoral and agricultural district, practically everything being grown on the surrounding
farms and irrigation areas. Wheat, wool, farm and garden produce, with gold and tin, are
principal products. Chief industries: Wool scouring, flour and saw milling, brewing. Prin-
cipal minerals worked are tin in abundance (Ardlethan) and gold. Dairy factory, flour mill
and six pine sawmills. 2,945 horses, 12,097 cattle, 699,927 sheep.
Just see the display of this great district at Lassetter’s and you can judge for your-
self just what the district can do. The people there say that before you can get anywhere
worth while you must pass through Narrandera, the open doorway of the great south-west.
Narrandera says that it is the open doorway to prosperity. Seeing what they can produce
we believe them. _ NOWRA
Population 2000, district 10,000. On Shoalhaven River, about 9 miles from
Heads; 92 miles South from Sydney. Terminus of South Coast Railway. Centre of flourishing
district, dairying being the principal industry. Choicest breeds of dairy cattle realising as
much as several hundreds of pounds for certain of the animals, whilst the best of the land is
worth £1 00 per acre. Maize, potatoes and fruit grown. Gold found. Four dairy fac-
tories, milk condensory, bacon factories. Nowra is famous the world over for its dairy
products, and for its beautiful tourist resorts. It is not a big place, but what there is of it
is good. Still, there is room for a few new neighbours. Will you make one?
PARKES.
Population 4,000, district 8,000. 270 mil es from Sydney, on the railway from
Sydney to Condobolin, shortly to Kalgoorlie and Perth, Western Australia; and forming a
junction v/ith another line, shortly to connect Brisbane with Melbourne and the great north-
ern, western, central and southern systems of railways. Parkes is connected by rail with
Molong, Forbes, Bogan Gate, Trundle and Peak Hill, which surround it at easy distances*




Chief products: Wheat, wool, rabbits, chaff, butter, horses, cattle, sheep, fruit. Its minerals
include gold, platinum, copper, silver, magnesite and kaolin. 150,000 acres under wheat.
Dairy factory, flour mill, coach factory, foundry, furniture and joinery works, and three
motor garages.
Parkes came early into the Bush Week movement, and they came with both hands
full. The people of the district say that they have one of the finest farming areas in Aus-
tralia. They are prosperous and happy, but being a very sociable community they want
more neighbours. Now, who will make a neighbour for some prosperous farmer in Parkes?
PENROSE.
When you mention stpples everyone lifts an ear and asks: **ls it a Penrose?” Apples
and Penrose go together. During the last five or six years this locality has become a
famous fruit growing centre: mostly apples and pears of exportable varieties. It is easily
accessible to railway, being on the main Southern line beyond Mittagong. If you desire
to be a fruitgrower just make a few enquiries about Penrose.
PORT MACQUARIE.
Population 1,120. An old and picturesque town, with magnificent district. Dairying
is principal industry. Mixed farming and fruit-growing promise to be great factors in its
prosperity. When the North Coast Railway is opened to Wauchope the attractions of Port
Macquarie will make it a favourite with tourists and pleasure-seekers. 16,062 horses, 124,671
cattle, 2,533 sheep. SINGLETON.
Population 5,000, district 12,000. On banks of Hunter; by rail from Sydney 149
miles; 49 miles from Newcastle. Splendid agricultural, pastoral and dairying industries.

municipally well favoured. Gas. Picturesquely situated; healthy climate. The stock sales
held weekly range among the most important of the country selling centres in the State.

TENTERFIELD.
Population 3,400, district 9,500. 481 miles north from Sydney, on the
Sydney line, 1 2 miles south from the Queensland border town of Wallangarra. Centre of New
England tin mines. The town is beautifully situated on the River Dumaresq. The sanatorium of
Southern Queenslanders and people of the North Coast. Largest cattle trucking town in
New South Wales. Cattle raising, dairying, wheat, maize, all stone fruits, strawberries,

Wolfram, tin, silver, gold, bismuth, molybdenite found. Stock in district: 284,000 sheep,
98,000 cattle, 1 1,000 horses. 14,000 swine. Tenterfield would tell you (in confidence) that
there is no district in the Bush Week display that can come within coo-ee of them. It is
certainly a great district, famous for many products, as you will see. It is a hospitable place
and will give you a great welcome. TOO RA WEEN AH.
Tooraweenah claims to be “the best little spot in Australia.’’ Now there is pride of
place for you. During the last severe drought they had ample feed for all stock, natural
pasture grasses being particularly abundant. They say that it is the agistment paddock of
the north-west. There are big things coming to Tooraweenah.
TUMUT.
Population 1,600, district 10,000. Centre of splendid pastoral, agricultural and
dairying district; terminus of Cootamundra-Tumut branch railway. 322 miles South-West
from Sydney, Chief products: Maize, cereals, tobacco, potatoes, butter, cheese, fruit,
timber, gold, copper, tin. Two butter and cheese factories, rabbit freezing works, eucalyp-
tus oil works, flour mill.
Tumut says that their population is now 1 0,000, but that they could do with 1 0,()00
more. The representative to Bush Week said that there is “good rich land on every hand,
and every hand in welcome.” Sounds like a nice place to go to, don’t you think so? The
oldest inhabitant is 96, and says he likes the idea of Bush Week, but is sorry that he has
had to wait so long for such a great movement, and might not be able to give it the help
he would like to in another 20 years.
WELLINGTON.
Wellington is a progressive town and one that is surely coming into its own. It is
a great wheat centre, and a visit to the district just now would show hundreds of teams
busy turning over the ground for the coming wheat crop.

THE STOKE AT YOURM)R
IF it were possible, by some magic means, to transport
Farmer’s and all its merchandising advantages and shop-
ping facilities, right into the vicinity of your own country
home, each time you had needs to fill, how you would web
come the opportunity of availing yourself of its manifold
conveniences. All the splendour of variety that the highest
degree of buying knowledge and buying power could gather
from the markets of the world, all the assurance of quality
and value summed up in the hall-mark “Farmer’s,” all the
perfection of organisation gained by the experience of 80
years —all these would be at your service. And all these are
at your service, for, by the simple expedient of writing a letter,
you put in motion a highly organised Mail Order System
which will carry out your wishes with thoroughness, thus
placing at your disposal all the varied excellences that have
made “Farmer’s, Sydney,” an institution of the city.
An Invitation to Country Visitors
Sydney expects a big inrush of Country visitors over Bush Week,
to become acquttiftted with the city’s recognition of her dependence
upon the success and prosperity of Australia’s vast Primary Industries.
All such visitors are reminded that the great Store of Farmer s is
“open house” to them and they are invited to wander through its
many floors, its innumerable departments and fashions salons to
view at leisure the working of an efficient organisation, which,
though city in location, reaches with its Service the furthest corners
of Australia. A special effort should be made to visit the Oak
Luncheon Hall, the Tea Rooms and the Roof Garden, where high
above the hustling city, delightful viands are served amid the
brightest, most congenial surroundings.
