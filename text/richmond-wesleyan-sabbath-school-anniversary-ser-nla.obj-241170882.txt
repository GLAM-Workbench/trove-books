HYMNS TO BE SUNG BY THE SCHOLARS.
Hymn 1.
i Come, let us sing His praises
Who reigns above the sky;
Let old and young, rejoicing,
Lift up their songs on high.
One family we gather,
One common name we bear,
And in the sweet “ Our Father!”
We lift our common prayer.
Refrain —-Then let our songs, ascending,
Like morning incense rise ;
And prayer and praises blending
Be wafted to the skies.
2 No sect nor creed divides us,
When Christ is all our theme;
And only love abides us
Who are complete in Him.
One blessed faith unites us,
One glorious hope sustains ;
One heaven of love invites us,
Where life immortal reigns.— Ref.
Hymn 2.
i Precious Sabbath morning,
Sent from God on high;
How we love its dawning
In the eastern sky.
Then we meet the loved ones,
Faithful, kind, and true; —■
Happy, happy teachers,
Happy children too.
Chorus. —Messengers oLglory, *>
Angels bright and fair,
Now are hovering o’er us,
And our praises share.
2 What a blessed shelter
Is our Sabbath school;
What a bond of union
Is the golden rule :
“Doing unto others
As we’d have them do;”
Happy, happy teachers,
Happy children, too.— Cho.
3 How we love to gather
Every Sabbath-day,
In our pleasant schoolroom,
There to sing and pray
AVith the hearts that love us,
Faithful, kind, and true ;
Happy, happy teachers,
Happy children, too. Cho.
4 When the King of Glory-
Calls His children home,
May we gladly answer,
“ Dearest Lord, we come !”
To the land celestial,
Beautiful to view,
Happy, happy teachers,
Happy children too. Cho.
Hymn 3.
Hail the day that sees Him rise, Hallelujah!
To His throne above the skies, Hallelujah !
Christ, the Lamb for sinners given,
Enters now the highest heaven. Hallelujah!
Amen.
2 There for Him high triumph waits, Hallelujah !
Lift your heads, eternal gates, Hallelujah !
He hath conquered death and sin;
Take the King of Glory in. Hallelujah ! Amen.
3 Lo, the heaven its Lord receives; Hallelujah!
Yet He loves the earth He leaves ; Hallelujah !
Though returning to His throne,
Still He calls mankind His own. Hallelujah!
Amen.
4 Still for us He intercedes, Hallelujah !
His prevailing death He pleads, Hallelujah !
Near Himself prepares our place,
He the first-fruits of ourrace. Hallelujah! Amen.
5 Lord, though parted from our sight, Hallelujah !
Far above the starry height; Hallelujah !
Grant our hearts may thither rise,
Seeking Thee above the skies. Hallelujah!
Amen.
Hymn 4.
I My sister, the Master is calling for you,
Oh ! hear His sweet voice and obey;
The harvest is white, but the labourers are few.
Go, work in- my vineyard to-day.
Cho. —The Master is waiting, waiting, waiting,
The Master is waiting and calling for you.
2 He waits where His children are crying for bread,
Where the tempted are ready to fall;
“I would not that any should perish,” He said,
“I come with salvation to all.”— Cho.
3 He waits'in the homes of the poor and oppressed,
To lighten the burdens they bear;
And brings to the weary and fainting ones rest—
Go quickly, and meet with Him there. — Cho.
4 My sister, the Master is waiting for you;
He calls for the reapers to-day.
There’s work for each one of His children to do ;
Oh ! haste thee, no longer delay. -— Cho.
Hymn 5.
I There is a land, a beauteous land,
_ Where ransomed saints in glory stand,
And songs of rapture fill the air;
Oh ! tell me, Lord, shall I be there?
Rejratn —Shall I be there, shall I be there,
And in those songs of rapture share?
Shall I be there, shall I be there —
Oh ! tell me, Lord, shall I be there?
2 Shall I those glories e’er behold,
Those pearly gates and streets of gold ?
A crown of glory shall I wear ?
Oh ! tell me, Lord, shall I be there? — Ref.
3 That glorious land when shall I see ?
Oh! is that blessed place for me ?
Is there a crown for me to wear? —.
Shall I indeed, O Lord, be there? — Ref.
4 Whene’er my wand’rings here shall cease,
Receive me into perfect peace;
And may Thy voice to me declare:
Oh ! yes, my child, thou shalt be there !
I shall be there, I shall be there,
And in those songs of rapture share ;
I shall be there, I shall be there,
Thro’ faith in God, I shall be there.


Hymn 6,
X No mortal eye that land hath seen,
That land beyond the river;
Its smiling valleys, hills so green,
The land beyond the river.
Its shores are coming nearer,
The skies are growing clearer,
Each day it seemeth nearer,
That land beyond the river.
With Jesu’s aid well stand the storm,
Its rage is almost over;
Well anchor in the harbour soon,
In the land beyond the river.
2 No cank’ring care nor mortal strife,
Beyond, beyond the river;
But happy never ending life,
Beyond, beyond the river.
Thro’ the eternal hours
God’s love, in heavenly showers,
Shall water faith’s fair flowers
In the land beyond the river. Cho.
3 That glorious' day will ne’er be done,
Beyond, beyond the river ;
When we’ve the crown and kingdom won,
Beyond, beyond the river.
There is eternal pleasure,
And joys that none can measure,
For those who have their treasure
In the land beyond the river. Cho.
4 When we shall look from Zion’s hill.
Beyond, beyond the river ;
With endless bliss our hearts sh^L-thrill
Beyond, beyond the river.
There angels bright are singing,
Where golden harps are ringing;
We ne’er shall cease our singing
In the land beyond the river.— Cho.
Hymn 7.
My life flows oh an endless song,
Above earth’s lamentation;
I catch the sweet, tho’ far-off hymn,
That hails a new creation.
Thro’ all the tumult and the strife,
I hear the music ringing;
It finds an echo in my soxd,
How can I keep from singing.
What tho’ my joys and comforts die,
The Lord my Saviour liveth ;
What though, the darkness gather round?
Songs in the night Pie giveth.
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge Clinging;
Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth,
How can I keep from singing?
I lift my eyes, the cloud grows thin;
I see the blue above it;
And day by day this pathway smoothes
Since first I learned to love it.
The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart —
A fountain ever springing;
All things are mine since I am His;
How can I keep from singing.
Hymn 8
i “ Whither goest thou, pilgrim stranger,
Wandering thro’ this lonely vale?
Knowest thou not ’tis full of danger,
And will not thy courage fail?”
Solo —“ Pilgrim thou dost justly call me,
Wandering thro’ this lonely void;
But no ill shall e’er befall me,
While I’m blessed with such a Guide.”
He will guide me to the end.
Chorns —Who will, guide you,
Who will guide you to the end?
2 “Such a Guide? No guide attends thee—
Hence for thee my fears arise;
If some guardian power defend thee,
’Tis unseen by mortal eyes. ”
Solo —“Yes, unseen; but still, believe me,
Such a Guide my steps attend;
Pie’ll in every strait relieve me,
He will guide me to the end.”— Cho.
3 ‘ ‘ Pilgrim, see that stream before thee,
Darkly rolling through the vale;
Should its boisterous waves roll o’er thee,
Would not then thy courage fail!”
Solo —“ No, that stream has nothing frightful;
To its brink my steps I’ll bend.
Thence to plunge will be delightful—
There my pilgrimage shall end.”
•t Pie will save you to the end.
Chorus —He will save us,
Jesus saves us to the end.
Hymn 9.
i Who shall harm you, chosen band ?
Guarded by a Father’s care,
In the hollow of His hand.
He will hold you ever there.
Refrain —Little flock, be not afraid,
Pie will bid the tempter fly;
None shall dare your peace invade,
Safe beneath a Father’s eye.
2 Angels at His word descend,
Charged their constant watch to keep,
_ He from danger will defend,
Israel’s God will never sleep. — Ref.
3 If a sparrow cannot fall,
But He marks it from above,
Surely He will hear your call,
Children of His tender love.— Ref.
4 Courage, then, your way pursue,
Pilgrims on a desert wide;
He your-vigour will renew,
To the end will safely guide.— Ref.
Hymn 10.
i Travel on thro’ the fast fleeting years,
And turn not aside from the way,
For God will remove all thy fears,
And bless thee with strength every day.
Chorus —Travel on to a home thy God hath given;
Hear the song; Oh, travel on to heaven.
2 Travel on to the haven of rest,
To thy home on the glorified shore,
Where Jesus will welcome the blest,
v , Oh, happy in God evermore. — Cho.


Hymn 11.
Solo (We love the sunny clays of spring,
‘ , ) With early buds, and birds, and flowers;
‘j) f ) But most we love, when Sundays bring
ue [ Of Sabbath school the happy hours.
Chorus —Sweet Sabbath school, sweet Sabbath
school,
The children’s happy, happy home;
Thro’ thy blest ways,
In future days,
Shall many happy children come.
2 We love to learn, all thro’ the week,
The things that make us good and wise;
But most we love the truths to seek
That light our pathway to the skies. Cho.
3 We love the stories of the brave,
The noble men who earth have trod ;
But more to hear of Him who gave
His life to bring us up to God. — Cho.
4 We may not roam o’er Olivet,
Nor view the pleasant Jordan near;
But He who met his children there,
Will surely come to meet us here. Cho.
5 O children, hither will you turn
With willing hearts, your Lord to meet ?
O teachers, while of Him you learn,
Like Mary, sit at Jesus’ feet. Cho.
Hymn 12.
i God wants the boys to be good and kind,
With honest heart and a truthful mind;
To read His Word, and obey His laws,
And give their lives to His holy cause.
God wants the boys in His precious fold,
’Tis better far than the purest gold;
He speaks to all from the sacred page,
The star of youth, and the strength of age.
Chorus —God wants the boys from the crowded
street,
In the Sunday school where the faithful meet;
From the lowly cot and the stately dome,
Oh, bring them in to the Sabbath home.
2 God wants the boys in their early days,
To love His house and His name to praise;
To cease their mirth as they enter there,
And bow their souls when they kneel in prayer.
God wants the boys in His grace to grow,
He wants the boys in his field below;
There, young and strong, they must learn to share
The heavier load which their elders bear. Cho.
3 God wants the young; in His Book we see,
“ Forbid them not, let them come to Me.”
As thoughts unfold, and their minds expand,
We should train them up with a careful hand—
That, when the years of our toil are o’er,
And we go home to return no more,
Our happy souls with delight may trace,
A Christian band in the rising race. Cho.
Anthem 1.
I Solo — Answer me, burning stars of night!
Where is the spirit gone,
That past the reach of human sight,
E’en as a breeze hath flown?
Quartette —Hai'k! a voice whispers, “Be thou still;
Enough to know is given;
Chorus —Clouds, winds, and stars their parts fulfil;
Thine is to trust in heaven !”
2 O many-toned and chainless wind !
Thou art a wanderer free;
Tell me, if thou its place canst find
Far over mount and sea?
Quartette —Hark, &c.
3 Ye clouds that gorgeously repose
Around the setting sun,
Answer ! have ye a home for those
Whose earthly race is run ?
Quartette —Hark, &c.
4 Oh speak, thou voice of God within !
Thou of the deep, low tone !
Answer me, through life’s restless din,
Where is the spirit flown ?
Quartette- —Hark, &c.
Anthem 2.
I Ist Voice — We have heard thee speak of the
better land,
Thou callest its children a happy band;
Dear teacher, where is that radiant shore;
Oh ! may we not seek it, and weep no more?
2 nd V. —ls it where the flow’r of the orange blows,
And the fire-flies glance thro’ the myrtle boughs ?
Response —Not there, my child, no, not there ;
Not there, my child, not there.
2 Is it far away in some region old,
Where rivers are wand’ring o’er sands of gold ?
Where burning rays of the ruby shine,
And diamonds illumine the secret mine ?
Does the pearl gleam forth from the coral strand ?
Is it there, dear teacher, that better land? — Resp.
3 Quartette —Eye hath not seen it, my gentle child !
Ear hath not heard its sweet songs so mild;
Dreams cannot picture a world so fair,
Sorrow and death may not enter there;
Time doth not breathe on its fadeless bloom;
Beyond the clouds, and beyond the tomb, —
Chorus, —It is there, my child, it is there!
Antliem 3.
Recit. —And there were in the same country
shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over
their flocks by night. And, 10, the angel of the
Lord came upon them, and the glory of the
Lord shone round about them; and they were
sore afraid. And the angel said unto them,
Solo —Fear not, for behold, I bring you good
tidings, of great joy, which shall be to all people ;
Duet —For unto you is born this day, in the
city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
Solo —And suddenly there was with the angel
a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God
and saying,
Choms —Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good-will toward men.

CHORUS. —In accents hush’d the throng reply :
“ Jesus of Nazareth passeth by,”

8 Jesus! ’tis He who once below

HYMN IX.
1 They are coming ! they are coming !
Who have been in darkness long ;

With a g'ad, triumphant song.
From the lands beyond the ocean,
From the islands if the sea,
From the valleys and the mountains,
They are coming, Lord, to Thee,
2 Long they sat beneath the shadow
And the gloom of moral night,
Waiting only forjhe dawning
Of the promised heavenly light.
But they’ve heard the glorious gospel
Of salvation full and free,
Now they read the “ blessed Bible,”
They are coming, Lord, to Thee.
3 Hasten, Lord, the coming morning

In that world so bright and fair ;
Shall we dare to love the m all
With an overflowing heart ?
Will they never leave our side,
Shall we meet no more to part ?

Where the saints, all immortal and fair,
Are robed in their garments of white.

And the mansion of life to secure.
Let me learn how to pray for the blessings in store,
And walk in the way of the saints gone before.
Till I reach glory’s gate where the angels shall wait
Eor my soul, on that beautiful shore.
2 Look on me, Saviour mine, with Thy sweet glance
of love,
While I trustingly cling to the cross;
Let that glance draw my soul in communion above,
And refine all the gojd from the dross;
I will heed not the thorns, tho’ they pierce my feet
through.
Nor weep, tho’ my blessings be scattered and few,
If I feel but thy grace while I’m running the race.
With the heavenly mansion in view.
3 Look on me, Saviour mine, when the earth shall
recede,
And my mission be over below ;
O divinest Redeemer! in this my great need.
One sweet look of compassion bestow;
Lend me wings like a dove, that with Joy I may fly
To meet thee in glorified realms when I die,
Evermore to have rest with the pure and the blest,
Evermore to be happy on high.
HYMN 11.
1 LEAD me to Jesus, lead me to Jesus,
Help me to love Him, help me to pray ;
He is my Saviour, I would believe Him;
I would be like Him —show me the way.
CHORUS.—Quickly haste, and come where happy chil-
dren meet,
Hither come and rest thy little weary feet;
Turn from thy pleasures, turn from thy
Play,
Come to our Sunday school away.

He is so loving, gentle, and mild ;
Calling the children, bidding them welcome ;
Surely he calls me—l am a child. —Chorus.
3 Tell me of Jesus, tell of His mercy ;
Is there a fountain flowing so free ?
All who are willing drink of its waters;
Say, is that fountain flowing for me ?
4 Lord, lam coming! Jesus, my Saviour,
Pity my weakness, make me Thy child ;
I would receive Thee, trust and believe Thee,
I would be like Thee, gentle and mild.

When our Journey is complete.—Cho.

Prom all the rough paths where your footsteps now
stray,
To pastures where Jesus, our Shepherd still stands,
And waits for His children, with gifts in his hands.
Chorus. —0 come with us, come ! come with us, come !
O Come, for the Shepherd will welcome us
home.


2 For tenderest lambs He has gardens most sweet,
With easiest paths for their faltering feet;
The Shepherd doth know how they stumble and stray,
And guiles them with gentleness all the long way.

The beautiful home of the blest;

of light,

Are open by night and by day;
The city whose splendour can never be told,
Whose pleasures will never decay ?

Beyond where the bright planets roll;
Above the clear arch of the blue ether sky.
The beautiful home of the soul.
Chorus. —’Tis a home, &o.
HYMN VII.
1 It is not in the noisy street.
That happiness is found;
It is not where the idle meet.

But where the faithful teacher stands.
With firm but gentle rule;
Oh, there’s the happiest place for me —
The pleasant Sunday-school.
CHORUS —Come along! come without delay!
Gome from ev’ry dwelling on the holy day;
Our Sunday-school is large enough,
Our teachers good and true ;

While life and health are ours;
But when the bell begins to throw
Its welcome on the air,
In spite of rain or drifting snow,
You’ll always find us there. —Chorus,
3 The stamp that covers manhood’s brow,
Is made in early years;

In future life appears;
And since we wish to do the right,
And mind the Scripture rule.
We ev’ry boy and girl invite
To come to Sunday-school.—Chorus,
HYMN VIII.

Let us hope and trust,
Let us watch and pray,
And labor till the Master comes.

To the fountain of Life let the hungry be led ;
In the cross and its banner our glory shall be,
While we herald the tidings, “ Salvation is free!”
Chorus—Toiling on, &c.
3 To the work! to the work ! there is labor for all.
For the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall;
And the name of Jehovah exalted shall be
In the loud swelling chorus, “Salvation is free”
Chorus —Toiling on, &c.
i To the work ! to the work ! pressing on to the end.
For the harvest will come, and the reapers descend;
And the home of the Ransomed our dwelling will be.
And our chorus forever. “Salvation is free”
Chorus —Toiling on, &o.

HYMN XII.
“ A vast fortune was left in the hands of a minister for
one of his poor parishioners. Fearing that it might be
squandered if suddenly bestowed upon him , the wise
minister sent him a little at a time , with a note, saving:—
‘ This is thine; use it wisely; there is more to follow.’
Brethren, that’s just the way the Lord deals with us.”
D. L. MOODY.
1 Have you on the Lord believed ?
Still there’s more to follow;
Of his grace have you received ?
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh, the Grace that Bather shows!
Still there’s more to follow;
Freely he his grace bestows,
Still there’s more to follow.
CHORUS—More and more, more and more,
Always more to follow;
Oh, His matchless, boundless love!
Still there’s more to follow,
2 Have you felt the Saviour near ?
Still there’s more to follow;
Does His blessed presence cheer?
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh, the love that Jesus shows!
Still there’s more to fo follow;
Freely He His grace bestows,
Still there’s more to follow.—-Chorus,
3 Have you felt the Spirit’s power?
Still there’s more to follow;
Balling tike the gentle shower,
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh, the power the Spirit shows,
Still there’s more to follow ;
Freely He His power bestows.
Still there’s more to follow.—Chorus.
IM.
2 So the Guardian of my soul,
Does my wandering feet control;
He leads me thro’ the darksome maze,
And brings me back to wisdom’s ways.
8 When the dreary vale I tread,
By the shades of death o’erspread ;
My steadfast heart no ill shall fear.
Bor Thou, 0 God, art with me there.
CHORUS.—Hallelujah, Amen.

HYMNS.
Hymn I.
1 In the golden sunlight, shining bright and fair,
On our cheerful Sabbath home;
Christian friends and teachers gladly meet ns here,
In our cheerful Sabbath home.
OIIORUs —We will sing together, for our hearts are gay,
As the bird when soaring on its wings away;
Little lambs of Jesus, happy we will be,
In our cheerful Sabbath homo.
2 Jesus watches o’er us with a shepherd’s care.
In our cheerful Sabbath home;
He will kindly listen to our simple prayer,
In our cheerful Sabbath home. —Chorus.
3 Gentle, loving Saviour, may thy spirit dwell,
In our cheerful Sabbath home;
Here thy tender mercy, oh, ’tis sweet to tell,
In our cheerful Sabbath home.—Chorus.
Hymn 11.
1 I’m kneeling, Lord, at mercy’s gate,
With trembling hope and fear ;
I’ve waited long, and still I wait,
Thy gracious voice to hear.
Thy precious word has bid me seek
The joys Thou bast in store :
Wilt Thou, 0 Lord, in mercy speak ?
I’m kneeling at the door.
OHOBtI —l’m k-eelihg at the door,
Kneeling at the door ;
Wilt Thou. 0 Lord, in mercy speak?
I’m kneeling at the door.
2 None ever empty turned away
Who truly sought thy face ;
And I, my Saviour, come to-day.
To seek Thy pard’ning grace.
Thy precious blood is all my plea ;
This can my soul restore ;
Wilt Thou in mercy speak to me ;
I’m kneeling at the door. —Chorus.
3 And when the ransomed millions stand
On Zion’s flowery hill,
With palms of vict’ry in their hand,
Waiting their Master’s will;
Oh! may I bear the living green,
And that dear name adore,
Whose love the sinner did redeem
While kneeling at the door. —Chorus.
Hymn 111.
1 ’Round the throne of glory.
Happy children throng ;
And Redemption’s story.
Wake the harp and song,
On the verdant mountain,
By the shining stream!
Oh! the living fountain,
Jesus is their iheme.
CHORUS— Children, happy children!
By the crystal stream ;
Singing with the angels ;
Jesus is their theme.
2 Robes of snowy whiteness.
Beautiful and rare ;
Crowns of radiant brightness,
Such those children wear,
Safe from death, bereavement,
Sorrow and the grave,
Safe from sin’s enslavement,
Victory’s palm they wave.—Chorus.
3 Now the skilful fingers
Sweep the golden lyre ;
Not a harper lingers
In that ransomed choir.
Voices sweetly blending
With the tuneful string,
To the throne ascending,
Praise the heavenly king.—Chorus.
4 Children now sojourning,
In a world of sin.
From your follies turning,
Strive to enter in,
Let your young affections,
’Bound the Saviour twine,
And ’mid heaven’s attractions.
Ye shall sing and shine.—Chorus.
Hymn IV.
1 Hark, the lilies whisper
Tenderly and low,
“ In our grace and beauty,
See how fair we grow ; ”
Thus onr heavenly Father
Cares for all below.
The lilies of the field,
The beautiful lilies of the field,
Your Father cares for them,
And shall he not care for you.
2 Hark, the roses speaking,
Telling all abroad
Their sweet, wondrous story,
Of the love of God,
In the Kose of Sharon,
Jesus Christ the Lord.
The roses how they bloom !
The beautiful roses how they bloom!
Your Father cares for them,
And shall he not care for you.
8 Buttercups and daisies.
And the violets sweet,
Flowers of field and garden :
All their voices meet; _
And their Maker’s praises,
To our souls repeat.
They sing their Maker’s praise,
The beautiful flowers, how they sing !
Your Father cares for them,
And shall He not care for you.


4 Let ns, then, be trustful.
Doubting not, although
Much of toil and trouble
Be our lot below.
Think upon the lilies,
See how fair they grow.
The lilies of the field.
The beautiful lilies of the field,
Your Father cares for them,
And shall He not care for you
Hymn V.
1 They have reached the sunny shore,
And will never hunger more;
All their grief and pains are o’er, Over there ;
And they need no lamp by night,
For their day is always bright.
And their Saviour is iheir light, Over there.
CHORUS—Over there, over there,
Thej 7 can never know a fear over there ;
» All their streets are shining gold,
And their glory is untold,
’Tis the Saviour’s blissful fold, Over there.
2 Now they feel no chilling blast,
For their winter time is past,
And their summers always last, Over there ;
They can never know a fear,
For the Saviour’s always near,
And with them is endless cheer, Over there.
Chorus —Over there, &c.
3 They have fought the weary fight,
Jesus saved them by his might,
Now they dwell with him in light, Over there;
Soon we’Jl reach the'shining strand,
But we’ll wait our Lord’s command,
Till we see his beck’ning hand. Over there.
Chorus—Over there, &o.
Hymn VI.
I Thank God for the Bible, ’tis there that we find
The story of Christ and his love;
How he came to the earth from his beautiful home
In the mansions of'giory above.
Thanks to him we will bring,
Praise to him we will sing,
For he came to the earth from his beautiful home
In the mansions of glory above.
2 In the Bible we read of a beautiful land,
Where sorrow and pain never come ;
For Jesus is there with a heavenly band.
And ’tis there he’s prepared us a home.
Jesus calls, shall we stay ?
No, we’li gladly obey,
For Jesus is there with a heavenly band,
And ’tis there he’s prepared us a home.
3 Thank God for the Bible! Its truth o’er the earth
We’ll scatter with bountiful hand!
But we never can tell what a Bible is worth,
Till we go to that beautiful land.
There our thanks we will bring,
There with angels we’ll sing,
And its worth we can tell when with Jesus we dwell
In heaven, that beautiful land.
Hymn VII.
1 The sea is widely tossing,
And often filled with gloom,
On which we’re swiftly crossing
To our eternal home.
CHORUS—Over the sea. over the sea,
Gracious Saviour pilot me,
Over the sea, over the sea,
Over the jasper sea.
2 ‘We’ve many a foe to conquer,
And many a storm to face.
Ere w 7 e in heaven anchor,
And sing redeeming grace.—Chorus.
3 Sail on, then, oom-ades, boldly,
And make God’s word your chart ;
Do every duty nobly,
With Joyful, frosting heart. —Chorus.
4 We’ll float the gospel banner,
And guard it with our life,
And shout aloud “ Hosanna ! ”
Victorious in the strife! ’’—Chorus.
Hymn VIII.
1 Oh when shall I dwell in a mansion all bright,
And Jesus my Saviour behold ?
Or walk by his side like an angel of light,
In a city all garnished with gold?
CIIORUs—Home of the blest! home of the blest!
When wilt thou ever be mine ?
Home of the blest! home of the blest'
Soon shall thou ever be mine.
2 No pearl from the ocean, or gold from the mine,
Can pardon or purity buy;
I’ll trust in the blood of a Saviour cliyine,
And cling to the cross till I die. —Chorus.
3 Tho’ light are the sorrows that burden the child.
And gentle the tempest of woe.
I long for the land which was never defiled.
To the throne of the blest I go,—Chorus.
4 But while I’m a stranger away from my home,
I’ll toil in the vineyard and pray ;
I’ll carry the cross while I think of the crown,
And watch for the break of the clay.—Chorus.
Hymn IX.
1 Now buckle on your armour
The time of strife is nigh ;
Take truth to be your girdle,
And on to victory !
Gird on your sword —the Spirit,
Which is the Word of God ;
And watch the cunning foeman,
And wait the onset word.
CHORUS —Be strong in the Lord, Be strong in the Lord,
Be strong in the Lord, Your armour put on;
Bear bravely the Cross, And inherit the
Crown.


vk js
2 Now buckle on your armour,
The saints have prov’d its strength.
They fought a gallant battle.
And won the day at length;
With fortitude undaunted,
W ith breast-plate—righteousness.
Their helmet was salvation,
Their feet were shod with peace. —Chorus.
3 Now buckle on your armour.
That so you may withstand
The evil day that cometh
To try a guilty land ;
The shield of Faith before you,
To stay each fiery dart.
And Christ, our mighty Captain,
To animate the heart. —Chorus,
Hymn X,
1 I am now a child, of God,
For I’m wash’d in Jesus’ blood ;
I am watching and I’m longing while I wait,
Soon on wings of love to fly,
To my home beyond the sky,
To my welcome, as I’m sweeping thro’ the gates.
CHORUs—In the blood of yonder Lamb,
Wash’d from ev’ry stain t am ;
Rob’d in whiteness, clad in brightness,
I am sweeping thro’ the gates.
2 Oh! the blessed Lord of light,
I have loved him with my might:
Now his arms enfold, and comfort while I wait,
I am leaning on his breast,
Oh ! the sweetness of his rest,
And I’m thinking of my sweeping thro’ the gates.
Chorus—ln the blood, &c.
3 I am sweeping thro’ the gate
Where the blessed for me wait;
"W here the weary workers rest for evermore.
Where the strife of earth is done.
And the crown of life is won,
Oh! I’m thinking of the city while I soar.
Chorus —In the blood, &c.
4 Burst are all my prison bars,
And I soar beyond the stars,
To my Father’s house, the bright and blest estate.
Lo 1 the morn eternal breaks.
And the song immortal wakes,
Rob’d in whiteness, I am sweeping thro’ the gates.
Chorus —In the blood, &c.
Hymn XL
1 There is a land, a sunny land,
Whose skies are ever bright,
Where evening shadows never fall,
The Saviour is its light.
CHORTJs —If the cross we meekly bear.
Then the crown we shall wear,
When we dwell among the fair,
In the bright forevermore.
2 There is a clime, a peaceful clime,
Beyond life’s narrow sea,
Where ev’ry storm is hushed to rest,
There let our treasure be. —Chorus.
3 There is a home, a glorious homo,
A heavenly mansion fair;
And those we loved so fondly here,
Will bid us welcome there. —Chorus.
4 We long to leave these fading scenes,
That glide so quickly by ;
And join the shining hosts above,
Where joy can never die.—Chorus,
Hymn * XII.
1 They’re gathering homeward from every land.
GathTing home, one by one ;
Their weary feet rest on the shining strand,
Resting, one by one.
Their brows are inclosed in a golden crown,
Their travel-stained garments are all laid down ;
And clothed in white raiment they rest on the mead,
Where the Lamb loveth his children to lead.
CHORUs—One by one, we’re gath’ring homo,
GathTing home, one by one,
Soon we’ll all be gathered home,
Gathered, one by one.
2 Before they can rest they must pass thro’ strife,
Passing through, one b}r one ;
’Tis only through death they can enter life.
Ent’ring, one by one.
To some are the floods of the river still,
While fording their way to the heavenly hill;
To others the billows rage fierce and roar, —
Still they all land on the heavenly shore. —Chorus.
3 We also shall come to the river’s side,
Coming home, one by one ;
We’re nearer its waters each eventide,
Nearer, one by one.
We hear now the noise and the dash of the stream,
Again and again thro’ our life’s deep dream ;
And sometimes the floods o’er the banks o’erflow,
Sometimes in ripples the smaller waves go.—Chorus,
ANTHEM.
Cry out and shout thou inhabitant of Zion,
Cry out and shout thou inhabitant of Zion,
For great is the Holy One, for great is the Holy One,
for great is the Holy One in the midst of thee.
Beautiful for situation, beautiful for situation,
Beautiful is Zion joy of the earth,
Beautiful is Zion, O beautilul is Zion, beautiful is
Zion, the joy of the earth.
Walk about Zion, and go round about her; tell her
towers, tell her towers, ma'k well her bulwarks,
consider her palaces, tell it to the generations
following thee.
Cry out and shout, cry out and shout, cry out and
shout, cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion,
For great is the Holy One in the midst of thee,
Cry out and shout,
Great is the Holy One in the midst of thee,
Great is the Holy One in the midst of thee.

HYMN'S
My Sabbath Home. 3 Leaning on Thee.
1. Sweet Sabbath school! more dear to me 1. Leaning on Thee, my Guide and Friend,
Than fairest palace dome, My gracious Saviour, I am blest;
My heart e’er turns with joy to thee, Though weary, Thou dost condescend
My own dear Sabbath home. ” To be my rest.
Chorus—Sabbath home I Blessed home! Chorus—Leaning on Thee, leaning on Thee,
Sabbath home! Blessed home!
My heart e’er tarns with joy to thee,
My own dear Sabbath home.
2. Here first my wilful, wand’ring heart,
The way of life was shown ;
Here first I sought the better part,
And gained a Sabbath home.
3. Here Jesus stood with loving voice,
Entreating me to come.
And make of Him my only choice,
In this dear Sabbath home.
We Are Coming.
Spirited.
1. We are coming, we are coming,
Blessed Jesus, at Thy call;
In the dewy time of morning,
Ere the dark’ning shadows fall.
We are coming, blessed Saviour,
With our willing hearts and true,
Out of every tribe and nation,
Out of ev’ry clime and hue.
Chorus —We are coming, we are coming,
Blessed Jesus, at Thy call;
In the dewy time of morning,
Ere the dark’ning shadows fall.
2. We are singing, we are singing,
Songs of gladness as we pass ;
For Thy love, in us distilling
Like the showers upon the grass;
For the home in heaven preparing
To receive our weary feet;
For Thy smiles, our pathway cheering,
Songs of praises we repeat.
3, We are coming, we are coming,
Speeding onward to Thy throne,
Where in majesty Thou’rt waiting—
Waiting to receive Thine own.
Out of ev’ry tribe and nation,
We are gathering at Thy call,
For Thy glorious coronation,
Jesus, Saviour, Lord of all.
Jesus, on Thee alone :
Still I’m leaning on Thee, leaning on Thee,
On Thee alone.
2. Leaning on Thee with childlike faith,
To Thee the future I confide,
Each step of life’s untrodden path
Thy love shall guide.
3. Leaning on Thee, though faint and weak,
Too weak another voice to hear,
Thy heavenly accents comfort speak,
“ Be of good cheer.”
4. Leaning on Thee, no fear alarms,
Although I stand on death’s dark brink,
I feel the everlasting arms :
I shall not sink.
I will Guide Thee.
I. Precious promise God hath given
To the weary passer-by,
On the way from earth to heaven,
“ I will guide thee with Mine eye.”
Chorus. —“ I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
I will guide the with Mine eye ;
On the way from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with Mine eye.”
2. When temptations almost win thee,
And thy trusted, watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee :
“ I will guide thee with Mine eye.”
3. When thy sacred hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished :
“ I will guide thee with Mine eye.”
4. When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die,
Hear thy trusty Leader calling,
“ I will guide thee with Mine eye.”


5 Come to the Saviour To-day.
Earnestly.
1. Come to the Saviour, children, to-day,
Jesus invites you, hear and obey ;
Here in His word He’s shown you the way ;
Come to the Saviour, come.
Chorus —Far and wide we’ll send His praise along,
All the world shall echo with the song,
Jesus can save you, save you to-day ;
Come to the Saviour, come.
2. “ Suffer the children,” oh! hear Him say,
“ I am the Life, the Light, and the Way!”
Jesus commands you, do not delay,
Come to the Saviour, come !
3. Come to the Saviour, He is your friend ;
He will sustain you, He will defend ;
And He will save you when life shall end,
Come to the Saviour, come.
6 In My Father’s House.
In March time.
1. In my Father’s house are many mansions fair,
In my Father’s house on high,
And there a blessed home the Saviour will
prepare,
In my Father’s house on high.
Semi-Cho. —Blessed, blessed home eternal,
Happy land beyond the sky ;
There we all may meet, and worship
at his feet,
In my Father’s house on high.
Chorus —Happy home, blessed home,
Happy, happy home eternal;
Happy home, blessed home,
Happy home beyond the sky.
2. In my Father’s house the children saved by
grace,
In my Father’s house on high,
Shall meet from every land to worship at His
face,
In my Father’s house on high.
3. In my Father’s house the ransomed all shall
meet,
In my Father’s house on high,
The Saints and angels bow together at His feet,
In my Father’s house on high.
By and By.
1. By and by we shall know Jesus,
By and by ! oh, by and by !
Even now He looks and sees us,
Journeying toward His home on high ;
And He smiles upon us, saying,
“ By and by ! oh, by and by !
Cares and trials you’ll be laying,
With your earthly garments, by.”
Chorus. —Oh, “ By and by ! ” —we sing it softly,
Thinking not of earthly care,
But the “ by and by ” of heaven,
Waiting for us over there.
2. By and by we shall be standing,
By and by ! oh, by and by !
At fair heaven’s shining landing,
While the river murmurs by ;
And our friends will round us gather,
By and by ! oh, by and by !
Saying, “Welcome, for the Father
Loves to have His children nigh.”
3. “By and by! ” —we say it gently,
Looking on our peaceful dead ;
And we do not think of earth life,
But of heaven’s sweet life instead.
By and by we all shall gather,
By and by ! oh, by and by !
In the love of God our Father
That shall know no “ by and by.”
8 By the Gate they’ll meet Us,
1. In the fadeless spring-time, on the heavenly shore,
Kindred spirits wait us, who have gone before ;
There no flowers wither, and no pleasures cloy,
In that land of beauty, in that home of joy.
Chorus. —By the gate they’ll meet us,
’Neath that golden sky,
Meet us at the portal—
Meet us by-and-by.
2. In the misty gloaming, death awaits us all ;
Silent is his coming, sure the Master’s call ;
And the angel footsteps mark the upward way,
Till the twilight merges into heavenly day.
3. Trusting in the Saviour, may we humbly, wait
Till the holy angels ope the pearly gate,
And the loving Father, from His gracious throne,
Smiling bids us welcome to our heavenly home.


Guide and Bless Us.
The Better Way.
Andante.
Andante.
1. Guide and bless us, 0 our Father,
Through the toilsome march of life ;
Keep us ever, ever near Thee,
Keep our hearts from sin and strife.
Great temptations lie before us,
And we falter at the sight;
1. There’s a better way of going,
There's a lighter load to bear,
Than the heavy, grievous burden
That so many of us wear.
Be our guardian, guide and Saviour,
Through the day as well as night.
Chorus —Cast your care on Jesus,
Cast your care on Jesus,
Cast your care on Jesus,
He will your burden bear.
2. Guide and bless us, O our Father,
In the long and toilsome way ;
Be Thou watchful o’er our footsteps,
Lest our little feet should stray.
There are dangers that surround us,
2. There’s a voice for ever sounding
In the weary pilgrim’s ear,
Voices of tenderest compassion
Framing sweetest words of cheer.
There are trials we must meet;
Be a light unto our pathway,
And a lamp unto our feet.
3. “ Cast on me your heavy burden,
Cast on me your loads of care ;
I invite you, 1 entreat you,
All your burdens I will bear.”
3. Guide and bless us, 0 our Father,
Little children though we be ;
We are weak, hut Thou art mighty,
And no other strength have we.
And when life’s short day is over,
On a loving Saviour’s breast,
Bear us tenderly to heaven,
To Thine ever promised rest.
Art Thou Weary ?
1. Art thou weary, art thou languid,
Art thou sore distrest ?
“ Come to me,” Saith One, “ and coming,
Lead Thou Me.
Be at rest ! ”
1. Though the way be sometimes dreary,
Father, lead Thou me !
2. Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my guide ?
Though the heart be sometimes weary,
Father, lead Thou me !
Though a host encamp before me,
Fearless will I be !
With Thy banner floating o’er me,
“ In His feet and hands are wound prints,
And His side.”
3. Hath He diadem as monarch
That His brow adorns ?
Father, lead Thou me !
“ Yea, a crown, in very surety,
2. Through the valley dark and lonely,
Father, lead Thou me 1
Give me then Thy presence only,
But of thorns.”
4. If I find Him, if I follow,
What His guerdon here ?
“ Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Father, lead Thou me !
When I hear the billows roaring,
Bid the shadows flee ;
Many a tear.”
Then my fainting soul restoring,
Father, lead Thou me!
5. If I still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last ?
3. Sins oppose and fears alarm me :
Father, lead Thou me :
Led by Thee there’s nought can harm me
Father, lead Thou me !
By Thy mighty power surrounded,
Trusting all to Thee,
Let me never be confounded :
“ Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,
Jordan past.”
6, If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me, nay ?
“ Not till earth, and not till heaven
Father, lead Thou me.!
Pass away.”


The New Commandment.
Chorus. Allegro.
1. Welcome, welcome, the New Command,
The Christian’s glorious sign ;
Welcome, welcome the law so blest, so grand,
The law of love divine.
Quartet or Semi-Chorus. Moderate.
That love the world shall bless,
The suit ’ring shall relieve,
Shall soothe all sorrow and distress,
And none shall harm or grieve.
And like their heavenly king,
(The Lord their God is love),
To all around they blessings bring,
And comfort from above.

lEL IT IMI IST S.
MOMIIGr SERVICE.
We Hail this Day.
1. We hail this day of gladness,
With gratitude and joy,
No tears nor trace of sadness,
It’s pleasures shall alloy.
Chorus—Every heart and tongue rejoices
While we raise our cheerful voices,
Every heart and tongue rejoices
While we raise our cheerful voices
2, Now spring, with rosy fingers,
Sheds beauty o’er the earth,
And though cold winter lingers,
Gives flowers a sunny birth.
3. So, like the spring in beauty,
May we in early youth,
Encircle every duty
With rays of sacred truth.
4. Thou, Saviour, great and holy,
Exalted now on high,
Didst once on earth so lowly
Bless such an one as I.
6. Oh, now on us before Thee
Bestow thy gracious love,
That we may all adore Thee,
And dwell with Thee above.
2 The Saviour’s Love.
1. When I think of the love which my Saviour has
shown,
And all His great kindness to me ;
How he calls such a weak little creature his own,
All His grace and His mercy to see ;
Then my heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me,
Then my heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me.
Chorus—The love of my Saviour to me,
The love of my Saviour to me,
Then my heart overflows with a sense
of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me.
2. When I think how He left the bright mansions on
high,
And laid all his glory aside ;
The homage, the worship, and praise of the sky,
And came down with man to reside !
Then my heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me,
Then ray heart overflows with a sense of his love,
The love of ray Saviour to me.
3. When I think of the anguish and pain that He
bore,
His passion and death on the tree ;
And to think that my sins afflicted him sore,
And know that he suffered for me ;
My heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of ray Saviour to me,
.My heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me.
4. When I think of my home in the “bright sunny
land,”
The glory for ever untold ;
And the robes and the palms at my Saviour’s
right hand,
The streets of pure glittering gold ;
Then my heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me,
Then my heart overflows with a sense of His love,
The love of my Saviour to me.
The Sure Foundation.
1. Built on the Bock of Ages,
Foundation fixed and sure,
On Jesus as my Saviour,
I evermore endure ;
Defying powers of darkness,
This fortress is my rest,
My Jesus is my Saviour,
Of every good possest.
Chorus—With Jesus as my Saviour,
Defying earth and hell,
I conquering go to conquer,
1 conquering go to conquer, to conquer,
For who His love can tell,
For who His love can tell ?
With Jesus as my Saviour,
Defying earth and hell,
1 conquering go to conquer,
For who his love can tell ?
2. Bent on my work of conquest,
My weapons I must use,
For Jesus is my Saviour,
None can his help refuse ;
No weapon formed shall prosper
’Gainst those who trust in Christ,
The sword of God’s good Spirit
Has evermore sufficed.
3. To trust on God my Father,
So faithful and so true ;
Now Jesus is my Saviour,
His gifts are great and new.
Bound for a land of glory
A crown my great reward,
I here by faith would vanquish,
And all His laws regard.
Oh, We are Volunteers.
1. Oh, we are volunteers in the array of the Lord,
Forming into line at our Captain’s word ;
We are under marching orders to take the battle
field,
And we’ll ne’er give o’er the fight till the foe
shall yield.
Chorus—
Come and join the arm}', the army of the Lord,
Jesus is our Captain, we rally at his word ;
Sharp will be the conflict with the pow’rs of sin,
But with such a leader, we are sure to win.
2. The glory of our flag is the emblem of the dove,
Gleaming are our swords from the forge of love ;
We go forth, but not to battle for earthly honors
vain,
’Tis a bright immortal crown that we seek to gain.
3. Our foes are in the field, pressing hard on every
side,
Envy, anger, hatred, with self and pride,
They are cruel, fierce, and strong, ever ready to
attack,
We must fight, and watch, and pray, if we’d drive
them back.
4. Oh, glorious is the struggle in which we draw the
sword,
Glorious is the kingdom of Christ our Lord ;
It shall spread from sea to sea, it shall reach from
shore to shore,
And his people shall be blessed for evermore.


Gathering Home.
I. Gathering homeward from every land,
Gathering one by one ;
Pilgrims are joining the heavenly band,
Gathering one by one ;
Each brow is enclosed in a golden crown,
Their travel-stained robes are all laid down;
Gathering homeward from every land,
Gathering one by one.
Refrain —Home, home, sweet, sweet home ;
Home, home, gathering home.
2. Loved ones have gone to that distant shore,
Gathering one by one ;
Others are going for evermore.
Gathering one by one ;
Our sisters so gentle, our brothers so brave,
The beautiful children o’er the wave,
Gathering homeward from every land,
Gathering one by one.
3. We too shall come to the river side,
Gathering one by one ;
Nearer its waters each eventide,
Gathering one by one ;
0 Jesus, our fainting strength uphold,
The waves of that river are dark and cold ;
Gathering homeward from every land,
Gathering one by one.
4. Jesus, Redeemer, be Thou our stay,
Gathering one by one ;
Cross the dark river with us we pray,
Gathering one by one ;
Then boldly we come to Jordan’s side,
And fearlessly breast it’s swelling tide ;
Gathering homeward from every land,
Gathering one by one.
He in mercy hath watched o’er us
Through the year that now has sped.
Driving dangers from before us,
Shielding each defenceless head.
3. Ne’er will be His care diminished,
If in faith we seek His aid ;
Till our life on earth be finished,
By his strength shall we be stayed.
Let us ask Him for His blessing,
Let us His forgiveness crave ;
Every sin and fault confessing,
By His power He can save.
J ewels.
1. When He cometh, when he cometh,
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own ;
Chorus —Like the stars of the morning,
His bright crown adorning,
They shall shine in their beauty,
Bright gems for His crown.
2. He will gather, He will gather
The gems for His kingdom ;
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.
3. Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and own.
AFTEMOOI SERVICE.
This Happy, Joyful Day.
1. Long we one and all have waited
For this joyful happy day,
Till its dawn has compensated
For the seeming long delay.
Now our hearts are filled with gladness,
And with thanks to God above ;
He has banished all our sadness
Thro’ the mercy of his love.
Chorus—Then hail, all hail !
This happy, joyful day,
Then hail, all hail!
This happy, joyful day,
This happy, jojTul day,
This happy, joyful day,
This happy day,
We meet to sing our Saviour’s praise,
Whose mercy crowns our happy days;
Then hail, all hail I
This happy, joyful day,
Then hail, all hail !
This happy, joyful day.
2. Sing we, then, with hearts and voices,
Gladsome anthems to our King ;
Each of us in Him rejoices,
And delights His praise to sing.
Not My Will.
1. We think of those, dear Saviour,
Who in thine arms were press’d,
Who shared thy love and favor,
And smiled as they were blest ;
And yet in accents tender,
Thou callest us to-day,
Our love to early render,
And be as blest as they.
Chorus—Oh, may we ever follow,
The straight and narrow way ;
May every heart to thee be turned,
While with our lips we say,
“ Thy will be done our Saviour,
What e’er that will may be,”
So shall thy wisdom trace the way
That leadeth home to thee.
2. We sing the blessed story
The angels sang to earth—
The highest King of glory,
A babe of mortal birth ;
So we may bring before thee,
Our every joy and grief,
To thank or to implore thee,
For mercy and relief.
3. We need thy love, presiding
Each moment o’er our way,
Thy tender care and guiding,
In all we do and say ;
Thy strength, in self-denial,
That we, ’neath smile or frown,
So bear the cross of trial,
That we may win the crown.


Go On!
1. Goon in the glorious cause of right,
And strong in our Father’s word ;
Let this be the voice of ev’ry heart,
For us we will follow the Lord.
Chorus-— Go on !goon!goon ! go on !
Ever hold to the right, go on !
Go on ! go on ! go on ! go on !
In the Saviour’s might go on !
2. Go on with a sure and steadfast faith,
A firm and united baud ;
We’ll walk with delight the King’s highway
To Canaan’s delightful land,
3. Go on till the Saviour bids thee come,
The joy of His rest to share ;
Oh, then we shall see his glorious face,
While angels will welcome us there.
lO Welcome to Our Sabbath Home.
1. When the week of toil is over,
Comes the restful Sabbath day,
With its promises of heaven,
Mile-stones on the Christian’s way ;
Then from near and far the children
Eagerly and quickly come,
And they sing, in glad hosannas,
Welcome to our Sabbath home.
Chorus —Welcome, welcome,
Welcome they are sweetly singing,
Welcome to our Sabbath home.
2, When the storms of life are passing,
Let us keep the prize in view ;
Should our hearts grow faint, remember,
Christ can bring us safely through.
When in paths of sin no longer
Wearily our feet may roam,
With the ransomed we will praise him,
In our heavenly Sabbath home.
EYEIIIGr SERVICE.
Sabbath Bells.
1, Sabbath bells so sweetly calling !
Angels voices in the air !
How your echoes softly falling,
Win the heart to praise and prayer !
Every weekly toil and duty
Your sweet melodies repay,
For, in bright and loving beauty
Earth seems nearer heaven to-day !
Chorus —Sabbath bells, so sweetly calling !
Angel voices in the air !
How your echoes, softly falling,
Win our hearts to rest and prayer, to
rest and prayer!
2. Sabbath bells ring on for ever !
Echo all the earth around !
Dark the world, if we should never
Hear your bright and soothing sound !
Oh, ye seem to weary mortals,
Heavenly music far away,
Echoed thro’ the golden portals
Angels leave ajar to-day !
Love One Another.
This is my commandment,
That ye love one another,
That ye love one another,
As I have loved you.
1. Blessed words of Jesus
We have heard to-day—
Saviour, by thy spirit,
Help us to obey.
May thy love unite us
To the living Vine !
May our hearts, enlightened,
Glow with love divine !
2. May we seek thy glory,
Strife and envy flee ;
By our love to others.
Prove our love to thee.
Evermore as brethren,
In sweet union live.
As we wish forgiveness,
May we each forgive.
3. Grant us thy salvation,
Fill us with thy love ;
Give us each a foretaste
Of the joys above.
Ever meek and lowly,
Ever kind and true,
Ever pure and holy,
Paths of peace pursue.
13 Our Gracious God is Everywhere
1. Our gracious God is everywhere,
Upon the land and sea ;
His temple is the boundless sky—
To worship we are free.
He dwells upon the thunder cloud,
He lives upon the wave ;
And prayer will find Him on the mount,
Or in the dismal cave.
Chorus— Our gracious God is everywhere,
Upon the land and sea ;
His temple is the boundless sky—
To worship we are free.
•2. When unbelief was rampant most,
And pagan kings held sway,
The early children of the Lord
In secret met to pray.
In rocky wilds and deep, deep mines,
They gathered oft in prayer ;
But God was with them even then,
For He is everywhere.
3. A contrite heart, a spirit meek
Are God’s best sacrifice ;
A soul of purity and love,
A gem beyond all price ;
Then let us ask our Saviour kind,
To grant that blessing rare,
Nor deem our prayers reach not his throne,
For God is everywhere.
14 The Royal Road.
1. While our hearts are light, and our homes are
bright,
And the sun is shining o’er us,
We come to learn of a brighter path
To a better land before us ;
Of a royal road to the blest abode
Of love, and joy, and beauty,
And the Golden Rule of our Sunday-school
Is the Royal Road of Duty.
Chorus— We’ll follow, we’ll follow, we’ll follow
the Golden Rule.
2. We will love our neighbours as ourselves,
We will treat them like our brothers,
And as we would they should do to us,
We will kindly do to others ;
We will thus obey, from day to day,
That law so full of beauty,
For the Golden Rule of our Sunday-school
Is the Royal Road of Duty.


Remembered.
1. Fading away, like the stars of the morning,
Losing their light in the glorious sun ;
So let me steal away, gently and lovingly,
Only remembered by what I have done,
Only remembered by what I have done.
Chords —
Ever remembered, for ever remembered,
Ever remembered while the years are rolling on ;
Ever remembered, for ever remembered,
Only remembered by what I have done.
■2. So let my name and my place be forgotten,
Only my life-race be patiently run ;
So let me pass away, peacefully, silently,
Only remembered by what I have done,
Only remembered by what I have done.
3. So in the harvest, if others may gather
Sheaves from the fields that in spring I have sown;
Who ploughed or sowed matters not to the
reaper—
I’m only remembered by what I have done.
4. Fading away like the stars of the morning,
So let my name be unhonored, unknown ;
Here, or up yonder, I must be remembered —
Only remembered by what I have done.
16 Let Hill, and Lofty Mountain.
Let hill and lofty mountain
Their Maker’s praise declare,
Whose word subdues the waters,
And stills the stormy air ;
While suns and starry wonders
His mighty laws fulfil,
In all their constellations
Obedient to his will.
Duet —And in the lowly valley
Where gentle zephyrs woo
The op’ning bud and blossom,
His care awaits us too :
And thus the tender children
Grow up beneath His love,
And share His guiding mercy
With orbs that roll above.
Chorus— Oh, may the power Almighty,
That planned creation -wide,
The mountain and the valley,
To-day with us abide ;
Our willing souls constraining
To hymn His praise, as when heaven
rings with hallelujahs,
And angels cry Amen.
Heaven rings with hallelujahs,
And angels cry Amen,
Heaven rings with hallelujahs,
Heaven rings with hallelujahs,
And angels cry Amen, Amen,
And angels cry Amen,
Heaven rings with hallelujahs,
And angels cry Amen.

Oh, ’tis Avise to flee from sin ;
Who His “ great salvation ” know,
Find their heaven begun below.
He will fill your hearts with love,
FioAving from His throne above ;
Grace abundant He will give
All who to His glory live.
Chorus —Seek ye the Lord, &c.
4. When this fleeting life is done ;
When the battle’s fought and won ;
When the toils of life shall cease ;
When we lay us down in peace ;
Then the angels shall convey
Us to realms of endless day ;
Waft our happy souls above
To the land of light and love.
Chorus —Seek ye the Lord, &c.
He will Hide Me.
I. When the storms of life are raging,
Tempests wild on sea and land,
I will seek a place of refuge
In the shadow of God’s hand.
Chorus —He will hide me, He will hide me,
Where no harm can e’er betide me;
He Avill hide me, safely hide me,
In the shadow of His hand.
2. Though he may send some affliction,
’Twill but make me long for home;
For in love and not in anger,
All his chastenings will come.
Chorus —He will hide me, &c.
3. Enemies may strive to injure,
Satan all his arts employ;
He will turn what seems to harm me
Into everlasting joy.
Chorus— He will hide me, &c.
4. So while here the cross I’m bearing,
Meeting storms and Wlloavs wild,
Jesus for my soul is caring,
Naught can harm His Father’s child.
Chorus —He will hide me, &c.


AFTERNOON SERVICE
“Come.”
1. Oh word of words, the sweetest,
Oh word, in which there lie
All promise, all fulfilment,
And end of mystery,
Lamenting or rejoicing,
With doubt or terror nigh,

And to his cross I fly.
Refrain —Come, oh come to me,
Come, oh come to me,
Weary, heavy laden,
Come, oh come to me.
2. Oh soul why should’st thou wander
From such a loving form?
Cling closer, closer to Him,
Stay with Him to the end,
Alas! lam so helpless,
So very full of sin,
For I am ever wand’ring,
And coming back again.
Refrain —Come, oh come, &c.
2. Oh, each time draw me nearer,
That soon the “ Come ” may be,
Naught but a gentle whisper,
To one close, close to Thee;
Then over sea or mountain,
Far from or near my home,
I’ll take thy hand and follow,
At that sweet whisper “ Come ! ”
Refrain— Come, oh come, &c.

As they sound from day to day,
Of the fate which doth await them,
Who forever will delay.

Nor behind thee look, oh, never,
Lest thou be consumed in pain.”
Chorus —Gospel bells, &c.

As they echo far and wide,
Bearing notes of perfect pardon,
Thro’ a Saviour crucified.

To all people do I bring,
Unto you is born a Saviour,
Which is Christ the Lord,” and King,
Chorus— Gospel bells, &c.

Suffer the Little Children to Come
unto Me.
And they brought young children to Him, that He
should touch them ;
But His disciples rebuked them that brought them.
But when Jesus saw it, He was much displeased and
said unto them—
Solo —
Suffer the little children to come unto Me,
Suffer the little children to come unto Me,
Suffer the little children, Suffer the little children,
Suffer the little children to come unto Me,
And forbid them not, and forbid them not, for of
such is the kingdom of heaven.

And He took them up in His arms, put His hands
upon them, put His hands upon them, and

Then loud and long, to Christ so strong
To save the lost, we raise our song,

Show what all my life should be ;
Yielding all by faith to Jesus,

To sing each day faith’s Sabbath song^.

And we see the steady gleaming
Of our changeless beacon light.
O, the light is flashing brightly
From a calm and stormless shore,
Where we hope to cast our anchor
When the voyage of life is o’er.
2 Though the skies are dark above us.
And the waves are dashing high,
Let us look towards the beacon ;
We shall reach it by-and-by.
’Tis the light of God’s great mercy.
And he holds it up in view,
As a guide-star to His children,
As a guide to me and you.

With voices loud and clear ;

Of Adam’s scattered race,
To Christ all power ascribe,
Who saved them by His grace ;

13. WHEAT AND TARES.
1 Growing together, wheat and tires,
Clustering thick and green,
Fanned by the gentle summer airs,
Under the sky serene.
Oyer them both the sunlight falls,
Over thu-in both the rain,
Till the angels come when the Master calls*
To gather the golden grain.
Jesus, 0 grant when Thine angels come*
To reap the fields for Thee,
We may be gathered safely home,
Where the precious wheat may be.
2 Growing together, side by side,
Both shall th < reaper meet.
Tares al »ft in their scornful pride,
Bowing their heads the wheat.
Swift and sure o’er the waving plain,
The sickle sharp shall fly,
And the precious wheat, the abundantgrain,
Shall be harvested in the sky.
Jesus, 0 grant when Thine angels come,&c.


3 But for the tares, for them the word
Of a terrible doom is cast ;
u Bind and burn,” said the blessed Lord ;
They shall leave the wheat at last.
Never again the summer rain.
Never the sunshine sweet.
That were lavished freely, all in vain,
On the tares among the wheat.
Jesus, 0 grant when Thine angels come,
See,
4 Where shall the reapers look for us
When that day of days shall come ?
Solemn the thought, with grandeur
fraught.
Of that wondrous harvest home.
None but the wheat shall be gathered in*
By the Master’s own command.
For the tares alone the doom of sin
And the flame in the Judge’s hand.
Jesus, 0 grant when Thine angels come,

1. Greeting Song.*
Tune 67.—(White Robes.)
1 A year again has passed away,
Time swiftly speeds along ;
We come again to praise and pray,
And sing our greeting song.
Chorus —
We come, we come,
We come with songs to greet you ;
We come, we come,
We come with songs again.
2 We come, the Saviour’s name to praise,
To sing the wondrous love
Of Him who guards us all our days,
And leads to heaven above.
Clio. —We come, we come, &c.
3 We’ll sing of mercies daily given,
Through every passing year ;
We’ll sing the promises of heaven,
With voices loud and clear.
Cho. —We come, we come, &c.


4 We’ll sing of many a happy hour
We’ve passed in Sunday School,
Where truth,like summer’s genial shower
Extends its gracious rule.
Clio. —We come, we come, &c.
Before Beading the Lesson.
2. Guard the Bible.
Tune 476.
Guard the Bible well, All its foes repel,
The sweet story tell Of the Lord ;
Guard what God revealed, As our sun and shield ;
Never, never yield His holy word.
Bouse then, Christians ! Bally for the Bible !
Work on, pray on, Spread the truth abroad ;
Stand then like men, in the cause triumphant,
For the Bible is the word of God.
Book of love divine, Precious word of Thine,
Let it ever shine All abroad !
In the Spirit’s might We must win the fight
For this gospel light, The truth of God.
Clio. —Bouse then, Christians ! etc.
Shout the Bible song, Swell the mighty throng 1
In the cause be strong Of the right;
Look to God in prayer, When the foe you dare,
And for ever wear His armour bright.
Clio. —Bouse then, Christians ! etc.
0 ye Christian band, For this Bible stand !
By the Lord’s command, Ne’er give o’er ;
Lead the army on, Till the strife is done,
And the cause is won For evermore !
Cho. — Rouse then, Christians ! etc.


3. The Little Pilgrim’s Song.
Tune, 216.
1 The world looks very beautiful,
And full of joy to me ;
The sun shines out in glory
On everything I see ;
I know I shall be happy
While in the world I stay,
For I will follow Jesus
All the way.
2 I’m but a youthful pilgrim ;
My journey’s just begun ;
They say I shall meet sorrow
Before my journey’s done.
The world is full of trouble,
And trials too, they say ;
But I will follow Jesus
All the way.
8 Then like a youthful pilgrim,
Whatever I mav meet,
«/ ✓
I’ll take it—joy or sorrow-
And lay it at his feet.
He’ll comfort me in trouble.
Hell wipe my tears away :
With joy I’ll follow Jesus
All the way.
4 Then trials shall not vex me,
And pain I need not fear,
For when I’m close to Jesus,
Grief will not come too near.
Not even death can harm me,
When death I meet one day ;
To heaven I’ll follow Jesus *•
All the way.

4. Thanksgiving Hymn.
Tume, 248.
We plough the fields,, and scatter
The good seed om the land,
But it is fed and watered
By God’s Almighty hand :
He sends the snow ini winter,
The warmth to swell the grain,
The breezes, and the sunshine,
And soft refreshing rain.
Cho. —All good gifts around us
Are sent from heaven above,
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord,
For all His lovei!
He only is the Maker
Of all things, near and far;
He paints the wayside flower,
He lights the ewening star ;
The winds and wave3s obey Him,
By Him the birds are fed :
Much more to us hi* children.
He gives our daiily bread.
Cho, —Alll good gifts around us, etc.
We thank Thee them, O Father,
For all things Ibright and good,
The seed-time and tthe harvest,
Our life, our headth, our food ;
Accept the gifts we; offer
For all Thy lov/e imparts,
And, what thou most desireth,
Our humble, thiankful hearts.
Cho. —Alll good gifts around us, etc.

Raise the standard high for the Lord ;
Grird your armour on ; Stand firm, every one ;
Rest your cause upon His holy word.
Clio, —Rouse, then, soldiers ! rally round the banner
Ready ! steady ! pass the word along :
Onward I forward I shout a loud hosanna !
Christ is captain of the mighty throng.
Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go,
While our cause, we know, must prevail;
Shield and banner bright Gleaming in the light;
Battling for the right, we ne’er can fail,
Clio. —Rouse, then, soldiers I etc.
O Thou God of all ! Hear us when we call;

AFTERNOON SERVICE
6. Stand up for Jesus.
Tune, 242.
1 Stand up ! stand up for Jesus !
Ye soldiers of the cross ;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss :
From victory unto victory
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished,
And Christ is Lord indeed.


Stand up ! stand up for Jesus !
The trumpet-call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict,
In this His glorious day :
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes ;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose
Stand up ! stand up for Jesus !
Stand in His strength alone ;
The arm of flesh will fail yon ;
Ye dare not trust your own ;
Put on the Christian’s armour,
And watphing unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger,
Be never wanting there.
Stand up 1 stand up for Jesus !
The strife will not be long ;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s song :
To him that overcometh
A crown of life shall be ;
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally.
Before Reading the Lesson,
7. The Bible says I may.
To be Sung by Infant Class only.
Tune 27, White Kobes.
1 I AM a little soldier.
/
And but a few years old ;
I mean to fight fur Jesus,
And wear a crown of gold.
I know he makes me happy,
And loves me all the day ;
I’ll be His little soldier,
“ The Bible says I may.”


2 I love my precious Saviour,
Because he died for me,
And if I did not serve him,
How sinful I should be ;
He gives me every comfort,
And hears me when I pray ;
I want to live for Jesus,
“ The Bible says I may.”
3 I now can do but little,
Yet when I grow a man,
I’ll try and do for Jesus
The greatest good I can.
God help and keep me faithful
In all I do or say ;
I want to be a Christian,
“ The Bible says I may.”
8. The Beautiful Stream.
Tune. 501.
0 have you not heard of a beautiful stream
That flows through our Father’s land ?
Its waters gleam bright in the heavenly light,
And ripple o’er golden sand.
Clio. —0 seek that beautiful stream,
O seek that beautiful stream ;
Its waters so free are flowing for thee,
O seek that beautiful stream.
With murmuring sound doth it wander along
Through fields of eternal green,
Where songs of the blest in their haven of rest
Float soft on the air serene.
Clio. —0 seek that beautiful stream, &c.
Its fountains are deep, and its waters are pure,
And sweet to the weary soul;
It flows from the throne of Jehovah alone :
O come where its bright waves roll.
Clio. —0 seek that beautiful stream, &c.


4 This beautiful stream is the river of life,
It flows for all nations free ;
A balm for each wound in its waters is found,
O sinner, it flows for thee.
Oho. —O seek that beautiful stream, &c.
5 O will you not drink of the beautiful stream,
And dwell on its peaceful shore ?
The Spirit says, “ Come, all ye weary ones, home,
And wander in sin no more.”
Cho» —O seek that beautiful stream, &c.

9. Gentle Words.
Tune 67.
1 The sun may raise the grass to life,
The dew the drooping flower ;
And eyes grow bright, and watch the light
Of autumn’s opening hour ;
But words that breathe of tenderness
And smiles we know are true,
Are warmer than the summer-time
And brighter than the dew.
Gentle words! Loving smiles !
How beautiful are gentle words and loving smiles !
2 It is not much the world can give,
With all its subtle art ;
And gold and gems are not the things
To satisfy the heart;
But O ! if those who cluster round
The altar and the hearth
Have gentle words and loving smiles,
How beautiful is earth !
Gentle words ! Loving smiles !
How beautiful are gentle words and loving smiles !


After the Last Prayer.
10. Strike for Victory.
Tune, 517.
1 Strike ! 0 strike for victory, Soldiers of the Lord,
Hoping in His mercy, Trusting in His word ;
Lift the Gospel banner High above the world ;
Let its folds of beauty Ever be unfurled.
Cho. —Strike ! strike for victory, heroes bold ;
Strike ! till the victory you behold,
Strike ! strike for victory, ne’er give o’er ;
Rest then in glory evermore !
2 What, though raging lions Meet us on the way,
Zionward we’re marching, Toward the gates of day ;
Ever pressing onward, Onward to the light,
Till we reach the Jordan With our home in sight.
Cho. —Strike ! strike for victory, etc.
3 Strike ! 0 strike for victory, Heroes ofthe cross,
Sacrificing pleasure, Glorying in loss ;
Bind the helmet stronger, Tighter grasp the sword £
Conquering and to conquer, Battle for the Lord.
Cho. —Strike ! strike for victory, etc.
4 Hand to hand united. Heart to heart; as one,
Let us still keep marching Till our journey’s done,
Till we see the angels Come in glory down,
With the shining garments And the victor’s crown.
Cho. —Strike ! strike for victory, etc.

Thou art exalted for ever, evermore.
King of Glory, Hail, mighty King !
Thou our Deliverer, Thee we adore.

Before Reading the Lesson.
12. How Holy the Bible.
Tune, 499.
1 How holy the Bible ! how 7- pure is the light
That streams from its pages divine !
’Tis a star that shines clear through the gloom of the
night,
Of jewels a wonderful mine.
2 ’Tis bread for the hungry, tis food for the poor,
A balm for the wounded and sad ;
’Tis the gift of a Father : His likeness is there,
And the hearts of His children are glad.
3 ’Tis the voice of the Saviour ; how sweet in the storm
It speaks to the sinner distressed !
The tempest is hushed, and the sea becomes calm,
The troubled and weary find rest.


’Tis a friend’s loving counsel, the voice of a guide,
How gentle and faithful and true !
No harm can the dear little pilgrim betide
Whose feet its directions pursue.
No words like the words of the Saviour, nor can
Their sweetness or value be told ;
They are words 4 fitly spoken' to sorrowful man,
Like beautiful 4 apples of gold. 5
0 teach me, blest Jesus, to seek for Thy face,
To me let thy welcome be given ;
Now speak to my heart some some kind message
grace,
Some words that shall guide me to heaven.
13. Christ’s call to the Children.*
Tune, 40 (W kite Robes.)
1 There’s a voice that is calling from far,
In tones that are loving 1 and dear;
’Midst the strife and clamour of life.
That voice do you hear, do you hear ?
Oh, turn not away from its pleadings;
’Tis calling, ’tis calling to thee,
The voice of our holy Redeemer,
Oh, come now, oh, come unto me.
Chorus —
Come now in life’s earliest morning,
While life is so fair unto thee ;
Oh, come in thy youth’s freshest dawning,.
Oh, come now, oh, come unto me !
2 It is still, it is small as the voice
One hears in his half-waking hours,
But it comes from the Lord of the earth,
Who rules o’er its mightiest powers ;
The sweet breath of mom wafts it hither,
Oh, heed now its one earnest plea !
It comes in the stillness of ev’ning,—
’Tis calling, ’tis calling to thee !
Clio, —Come now, etc., etc.


3 Dost thou need a strong rock of defence ?
Ho tower so mighty as I ;
In each hour of affliction and grief,
On me canst thou safely rely ?
Are cares and temptations arising ?
My strength is sufficient for thee ;
Oh, turn not away from my pleadings !
Oh, come now, oh, come unto me ;
Clio. —Come now, etc., etc.

14. The Child’s Eeply to Christ-
Tune 474.
1 Jesus, who calledst little ones to Thee,
To Thee I come ;
0 take my hand in Thine, and speak to me,
And lead me home ;
Lest from the path of life my feet should stray,
And Satan prowling make Thy lamb his prey.
2 I love to think that Thou with holy feet
My path hast trod,
Along life’s common lane and dusty street
Hast walked with God,
On Mary’s bosom drawn a baby’s breath,
And served Thy parents dear at Nazareth,
S 0 gentle Jesus, make this heart of mine
(So full of sin)
As holy, harmless, undefiled, as Thine,
And dwell therein :
Then, God my Father, I like thee shall know,
And grow in wisdom as in strength I grow.
4 To Thee, my Saviour, then, with morning light
Glad songs I’ll raise,
My saddest hours and darkest shall be bright
With silent praise;
And should my work or play my thoughts employ,
Thy will shall be my law, Thy love my joy.


After the Last Prayer.
15.— 0 n Our Way Rejoicing.
Tune 156.

Wilt give large increase.
Crown the head with blessings,
Fill the heart with peace.
Clio. —On our way rejoicing,
As we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O Thou God of love.
2 On our way rejoicing
Gladly let us go,
Jesus is our Leader,
Vanquished is the foe.
Christ without, our safety,
Christ within, our joy ;
Who, if we be faithful,
Can our hope destroy ? On our, &c.
3 Unto God the Father
Joyful songs we sing ;
Unto God the Saviour
Thankful hearts we bring ;
Unto God the Spirit,
Bow we and adore,
On our way rejoicing
Ever, evermore. On our, &c.

MOHNINGr SKRYICK.
♦
L— Praise Ye the Lord.
Praise ye the Lord all ye moorlands and
mountains,
Praise Him alone, all ye evergreen hills ;
Grlory to Hod shout the bright flowing foun-
tains,
Till all the earth with your melody fills.
Woodlands and meadow flowers,
Bloom of the summer hours,
Bend t o the winds with your anthems of praise:
Sprays of the Waterfall,
Chant ye a coronal,
Here at the feet of the Ancient of Days.
Praise ye the Lord, all ye winds of the
corners,
Up from the glen peal the notes of your
song;
Praise Him who cheereth the hearts of earth’s
mourners,
Sing to the Lord, in His praise be ye strong.
Praise Him each bounding wave,
Desert, and cliff, and cave,
Rock and ravine where the shadows are
dim ;
Wake from your silentness,
Sing to the wilderness.
Praise ye the Lord, pay your homage to
Him,


Sing to the Lord all ye kindred and nations,
Tribes and dominions that people the world;
Where’er the sun sheds his glowing carna-
tions,
There let your standards of praise be unfurled.
Shout, till the bending sky,
Ringing, shall send reply.
Back from the furthermost wandering star;
Shout till your songs of love,
Peal through the air above,
Bearing your lay to the mountains afar.
(Before Reading the Lesson.)
2.—By Grace we are Saved.
Oh the wonderful love our Redeemer bestows,
He has died, not alone for his friends, but
his foes !
To embrace the poor prodigal waiting he
stands,
With the print of the nails in the palms of
his hands.
Choeus. —By His grace we are saved,
And through faith in His name
The poorest and weakest,
His mercy may claim.
Oh ! the wonderful fountain that flows from
His side.
There is health, there is peace, in its life-
giving tide,
And its blood-crimsoned waters are bound-
less and free;
Heavy-laden, behold it is open for thee,* — Cho.


Oh, the cross and its story will never grow old;
’Tis a wonder of wonders we cannot unfold ;
To that cross, guilty sinner, oh, cling while
you may,
’Tis the Saviour invites you, why will you
delay.— Clio.
( Before the Sermon,)
3. —Never from Thee.
Tenderly guide us, oh Shepherd of Love,
To the green pastures of heaven above,
Guarding us ever by night and by day,
Never from Thee will we stray.
Never, oh, never, for thou art the way ;
Never from Thee will we stray.
What tho’ the heavens with clouds be o’ercast-;
Fearful the tempest and bitter the blast;
What though the river of death bar the way,
Never from Thee will we stray. Never, &c.
Over our weakness Thy strength has been cast
Keep us in meekness, Thine own till the last;
Then safely folded, where Thou art the day,
Never from Thee will we stray. Never, &c.
(During the Collection. Music by Organist.)
4, —Stand Still, oh, Child of God.
Stand still and trust His might,
Who bids your trembling cease
The Lord for you shall tight,
And ye shall hold your peace.
Chorus —Stand still, oh child of God !
Whatever ill betide ;
Stand still,-and trust His Word,
And in His love abide.


Stand still, though Jordan’s waves
In gathering billows roar,
The Lord who surely saves,
Leads on to Cauaan’s shore. — Clio.
Stand still, and sing and praise,
The battle is not thine ;
Stand still, while God displays
His grace and power divine. — Clio.
s.—More than Tongue Can Tell.
The love that Jesus had for me, —
To suffer on the cruel tree :
✓
That I, a ransomed soul might be
Is more than tongue can tell.
Chorus —His love is more than tongue can
tell. (Repeat).
The love that Jesus had for me ;
Is more than tongue can tell.
The many sorrows that he bore,
And, oh ! that crown of thorns he wore ;
That I might live for evermore,
Is more than tongue can tell.
His love is more, &c.
The joy I feel that he is near,
The hope I have so bright and clear ;
The peace he gives without one fear,
Are more than tongue can tell.
His love is more, &c.
Oh, how I love his blessed name !
In sweetest songs to sing his fame !
And everywhere his grace proclaim
Yes, more than tongue can tell.
His love is more, &c.


AFTERNOON SERVICE.
6.—Toil On.
Thrust in the sickle, reap for God,
Behold the ripening grain ;
A glorious harvest soon will prove
Our labour not in vain.
Cho.—Toil on, toil on, let not our vigour wane.
How sweet to know the faithful here
Shall labour not in vain.
The gleaners soon will gather in,
With joy their precious gain ;
The weakest Christian soul will find.
His labour not in vain. Toil on, See.
The welcome song of harvest home,
Well sing o’er hill and plain ;
And angel choirs take up the theme,
We laboured notin vain. Toil on, &c.
But sweeter far thanharps of gold,
When He, who once was slain ;
Shall say to all His toiling ones,
Ye laboured not in vain. Toil on, See.
(Before Reading the Lesson.)
7.—Let the Master in.
Once I heard a sound at my heart’s dark door,
And was roused from the slumber of sin ;
It was Jesus knocked, He had knocked before;
Now I said, Blessed Master, come in.
Chorus —Then open, open,
Open, let the Master in : [light*
For the heart will be bright with a heavenly
When you let the Master in.


Then He spread a feast of redeeming love.
And He made me His own happy guest:
In my joy 1 thought that the saints above
Could be hardly more favoured or blest.
Chorus.
In the holy war with the foes of truth,
He’s my Shield, He my table prepares,
He restores my soul, He renews my youth,
And gives triumph in answer to prayers.
Chorus.
He will feast me still with His presence dear,
And the love He so freely hath given,
While His promise tells, as I serve Him here,
Of the banquet of glory in heaven. Clio.
(Before Address.)
B.—Yes, There is Pardon for You.
Oh. come to the Saviour believe in His name
/
And ask Him your heart to renew ;
He waits to be gracious, Oh, turn not away,
For now there is pardon for you.
Chorus —Yes, there is pardon for you,
Yes, there is pardon for you ;
For Jesus has died to redeem you,
And offers full pardon to you.
The way of transgression that leads unto death
Oh, why will ye longer pursue ?
How can you reject the sweet message of love
That offers full pardon to you
Be warned ofyourdanger ; escape to the cross s
Your only salvation is there ;
Believe, and that moment the Spirit of grace
Will answer your penitent prayer. — Cho ,


(During Collection. Music hy Organist.)
9.— Leaning on Jesus.
burden was laid on my spirit,
Whose weight was too heavy to bear ;
And so I just leaned upon Jesus,
And His loving heart heeded my prayer.
Chorus —Leaning on Jesus, my Refuge and
Guide,
Leaning on Jesus, what want I beside ?
Earth’s golden treasures seem nothing but
dross,
Since I have anchored my heart to His
cross ;
Leaning, leaning, leaning on Jesus alone.
The shadows of doubt gathered round me,
While the skies above me were dim :
/
And I scarce could see through the darkness,
The road that would lead me to Him,
Leaning on Jesus, &c
Then weary I sat by the way-side,
And the tears fell fast from my eyes.
When, 10, on the far-away mountains,
I beheld the glad morning arise.
Leaning on Jesus, &c.
And its light came down from the hill-tops
And smiled on the valleys below,
, »/ /
1 ill my heart sang aloud in its gladness,
For the sunshine’s bright radiant glow.
Leaning on Jesus, &c.
And I looked on the face of the Master,
As it shone through the glory of day ;
And leaning my spirit upon Him,
The burden slipped softly away.
Leaning on Jesus, &c.


(.Before the Last Prayer.')
10.—Too Late.
Too late! ah, no, the pulse of life
Still throbs within thy breast;
And while that blessed spark remains,
Thy soul may find a rest.
The Lord in mercy spares thee yet,
His love to thee is great;
But do not tempt that love too far,
Or it may be too late.
Refrain —Too late ! too late !
Soon Twill be too late !
He stands, He knocks, He Calls, He waits
He tarries at thy heart;
Canst thou reject His gracious call ?
And wilt thou say, “ Depart”
Oh. think on what a slender thread
/
This moment hangs thy fate ;
Arise—admit thy heavenly guest,
Or it may be too late.
Too late, &c.
Behold His hands, His bleeding side !
His crown of thorns behold !
And let His arms, extended wide,
Thy trembling form enfold.
His mercy lengthens out thy days,
His love to thee is great;
Oh, do not tempt that love too far,
Or it may be too late.
Too late, &c.


EVENING SEHVICE.
XL—Pressing On.
This is the day of toil
Beneath earth’s sultry noon ;
This is the day of service true,
But resting cometh soon.
Choeus —Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !
There remains a rest for us.
Spend and be spent would we.
While lasteth time’s brief day ;
No turning back in coward fear,
No lingering by the way.— Clio.
Onward we press in haste,
Upward our journey still :
Ours is the path the Master trod.
Thro’ good report and ill.— Clio.
The way may rougher grow,
The weariness increase ;
We gird our loins an d hasten on :
The end, the end is peace. — Clio.
(Before Reading the Lesson.)
12.—Ten Thousand times Ten
Thousand.
Ten thousand times ten thousand,
In sparkling raiment bright.
The armies of the ransomed saints
Throng up the steeps of light ;
’Tis finished —all is finished—


Their tight with death and sin !
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in !
Chorus —Hallelujah ! Hallelujah
To the Lamb who once was slain !
Hallelujah ! Hallelujah
To Him who lives again !
What rush of u Hallelujahs ”
Fills all the earth and sky !
w
What ringing of a thousand harps
Bespeak the triumphs nigh !
Oh day, for which creation
And all its tribes were made !
Oh, Joy ! for all its former woes
A thousand-fold repaid!
Hallelujah, &c.
Ob, then what raptured greetings
On Canaan’s happy shore !
What knitting severed friendships up,
Where partings are no more 1
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle,
That brimmed with tears of late ;
No longer orphans, fatherless,
Nor widows desolate.
Hallelujah, &c.
(Before the Sermon.)
13. —The Sweet Voice.
When the roses of youth all their beauty
display,
And the world seems as bright as a glad
summer’s day;


When our hearts are as happy, as happy can
be,
There’s a sweet voice that whispers, Oh, come
unto me.
Chokus— Softly and low,
Telling of rest in its love breathing tone,
Softly and low,
Saviour, dear Saviour that voice is thine
own.
When we gather with friends in the temple
of prayer,
And the eye of our Father looks down on us
there ;
When we mingle our voices with hearts glad
and free,
Still the call is repeated—Oh, come unto me.
Softly and low, &c.
Let us come in our youth, and. as long as we
live,
Our affection, our worship to Jesus well give ;
Then whatever our trials or conflicts may be,
Still that sweet voice will whisper —Oh. come
unto me.
Softly and low, &c.
When the Springtime is over, and Summer is
past,
When the snowflakes around us are falling
at last ;
To the Spirit how joyful the message will be,
Come and rest you—for ever in glory with
me.
Softly and low, &c.


(During the Collection. Music Organist.)
14,—Eejoice Evermore.
Rejoice, rejoice, for Jesus reigns,
The Prince of Peace and love ;
To guide the children of his grace.
To heaven their home above.
And they who seek his loving care,
Through dark and sunny days ;
Shall know how safely they may walk,
When God directs their ways.
Chorus—Rejoice, rejoice for evermore,
Immanuel’s praises sing,
They must rejoice who surely know,
That Jesus is their King.
Rejoice, rejoice, the Christ has come,
The Saviour of mankind ;
To seek the lost ones of his fold,
And heal the halt and blind.
Oh, erring and repen tent soul,
Look up and thou shalt live ;
The friend of sinners comes to save,
i
To ransom and forgive.
Rejoice, rejoice, &c.
Rejoice, rejoice, for evermore,
Nor let one soul repine ;
Though friends forget, and hearts grow
cold,
A Father’s love is thine.
And if the world seem dark with frowns,
Just meet them with a smile ;
And with the hope of future bliss,
All present ills beguile.
Rejoice, rejoice, &c.


{After the last Prayer. )
15.—Gathered Home.
Shall we all meet at home in the morning.
On the shores of the bright crystal sea,
With the loved ones who long have been
waiting ?
What a meeting indeed it will be !
Chorus-—Gathered home ! gathered home !
On the shores of the bright crystal sea ;
Gathered home ! gathered home !
With our loved ones for ever to be.
Shall we all meet at home in the morning,
And from sorrow for ever be free ?
Shall we join in the songs of the ransomed,

Beaming from Thy word.

All the coming year.

Join every voice the Master to greet ;

Go work in My vineyard, the Master saith, Go I

And toiled for our Master, when Jesus said, Go !

These two little eyes that God has given
Must always look to Him,
And He will show us the way to Heaven,
And teach us to walk therein.

To walk in the narrow road ;
These two little ears must only listen
To words that are pure and good.
These two little hands must be ready
.For Jesus all my days ;
This one little heart must seek His favour,
These lips must speak His praise,
That when He calls us home to Heaven,
The beautiful city of light,
To each little head will then be given
A crown of glory bright.

In your own happy land :
But send the tidings farther,
To Afric’s burning sand.

Name of all names most dear;
Spread wide the glorious tidings,
Till all the earth shall hear.
To China’s millions send it ;

The blessings He will give them,
The home He has above :
Oh, send the name of Jesus
To India’s burning land ;
’Twill heal the wounded spirit,
And raise the fallen hand.
Chorus —Oh, speak, &c.
The idol gods will perish
Beneath the blessed sound,
As news of Jesus’ mercy
From lip to lip goes round ;

Floats in its sweetness by,

Since hope sustains this thought of home,
And spirit voices softly say,
“Thy God shall wipe all tears away,
Beyond the swelling flood ! ”

What sounds shall greet the listening ear I
What thrills of rapture wake the soul
As back those golden gates shall roll,

2, —Fading like a Lifetime.
Methodist Sunday School Hymn Booh , No, 487 •
Tune 511.
Fading like a life-time ends another day ;
Bend in mercy, Jesu, hear us as we pray.
The morning’s glory’s long since fled,
The noon’s strong manhood too is dead,
And evening, like old age, is here,
And midnight’s stroke is near.
Fading, surely fading dies another day :
Its solemn voice to each doth say, Life glides
away.
Just beyond the nightfall comes another day :
Thou in glory throned, hear us as we pray.
The grave is not the end of all.
Our souls shall hear the trumpet-call,
The summons to a higher state,
Where faith’s reward is great.
From beyond death’s nightfall shines another
day ;
«If ye would live,” faith hears it say, “love,
work, and pray.”
3. —Why Waitest Thou.
Song Evangel , No. 109.
One there is who loves thee,
Waiting still for thee ;
Canst thou yet reject Him ?
None so kind as He.
Do not grieve Him longer.
Come and trust Him now ;
He has waited all thy days,
Why waitest thou ?


Refrain —Still His love would save thee,.
Oh, receive Him now ;
He has waited all the day,
Why waitest thou ?
Tenderly He wooes thee—
Do not slight His call ;
Though thy sins are many,
He’ll forgive them all.
Turn to Him repenting,
He will cleanse thee now ;
He is waiting at thy heart,
Why waitest thou ?
Ref? • ain —Still His love, &c.
Jesus still is waiting ;
Sinner why delay ?
To His arms of mercy
Rise and haste away.
Only come believing,
He will save thee now ;
He is waiting at the door,
Why waitest thou ?
Refrain —Still His love, &c.
4,—Arise, go forth, to Conquer.
Anniversary Gems , No, 91,
Arise, go forth to conquer,
Young champions for the Lord !
Fling out the royal standard !
Uusheath the mighty sword !
The Church that sword has wielded
In many a dreadful fray,
Till Satan’s Army trembled, ,
And, vanquished, fled away.
Chorus —Arise, go forth to conquer,
Young champions for the Lord I
Fling out the royal standard,
Unsheath the mighty sword.


Go forth, go forth, young soldiers,
The grand old cause defend ;
Take up the cross and bear it,
Be faithful to the end:
Go forth to fill their places,
Whose work is almost done,
Whose course is well nigh finished,
Whose crowns are nearly won.
Chorus— Arise, go forth, &c.
Oh, swell our ranks, young soldiers.
And, by our Captain led,
From conquering still to conquer,
March on with fearless tread;
Fight manfully and bravely,
We’ll die with sword in hand,
And leave, for those who follow,
Our foot-prints in the sand.
Chorus —Arise, go forth, &c.
(After the Benediction.)
5. —learer Home.
Song Evangel, No 69.
Nearer home I yes, one day nearer
To my Father’s house on high ;
To the green fields and the fountains
Of the land beyond the sky ;
For the heavens grow brighter o’er us,
And the lamps hang in the dome ;
And our tents are pitched still closer-
For we’re one day nearer home.
One day nearer, sings the seaman,
As he glides the waters o’er ;
While the night is softly dying,
On his native distant shore ;
Thus the Christian on life’s journey,
As his life-boat cuts the foam,
In the evening cries with rapture,
u I am one day nearer home.”

Methodist S.S. Hymn Book , No. 12. Tune 430.
HERAPHS laud Thee, God the Father,
U In the sweetest, noblest lays ;
Can it be that Thou wouldst rather
Listen unto children’s praise ?
Yea : Thou hearkenest to our voices.
Children’s voices though they be ;
Take the glory each rejoices,
Lord of all, to render Thee.
Cherubs praise Thee, God the Saviour,
In sublimest strains above ;
Wilt Thou grant to us Thy favor,
And accept of children’s love ?
Yes ; Thou listenest to our singing,
Children’s singing though it be ;
Take the hearts we all are bringing,
Sovereign Son, to Thee, to Thee.


Angels praise Thee, God the Spirit,
Source of life and light and truth ;
Wilt Thou, for the Saviour’s merit,
Hear the simpler songs of youth ;
Thou receiv’st our adoration,
Children’s homage though it be ;
Make our hearts a new creation,
Holy Spirit, fit for Thee.
Triune God, the heavens hail Thee,
Harpers, choirs, and white-robed throng.
Nor shall children’s voices fail Thee,
In the universal song.
Now receive our highest praises,
Children’s praises though they be ;
Then to bliss at last upraise us,
Triune God, to worship Thee.

LIFT the Gospel banner,
Wave it far and wide,
Through the crowded city,
Over ocean’s tide :

Peace to all mankind,
Jesus and salvation
All the world may find.
Let us raise the fallen,
Lend the oppressed a hand,
Teach the Christlv lesson
%/
All may understand ;
Go, where hardening vices
Have their strongest hold,
Like a sweet dove, gentle,
Like a lion, bold.


Lift the Gospel standard,
Spread the Gospel light,
Let the blessed radiance
Flame o’er heathen night ;
Love is God’s own sunshine,
Such as angels prove ;
Conquer men by kindness,
God himself is love.
Let us rise to action,
Work with one design,
Work with Christ, and triumph
In the work divine ;
Victory’s palm awaits us,
Let us then work on
Till we hear the welcome,
“ Faithful ones, well dot e !”

Where all shall dwell in perfect peace,
And worship at Thy feet.

2.—INFANT CLASS HYMN.
Methodist S.S. Hymn Booh , .Vo. 146. Tune 280.
FESUS when He left the sky
And for sinners came to die,
la His mercy passed not by
Little ones like me.
Mothers then the Saviour sought
In the places where He taught,
And to Him their children brought
Little ones like me.
Did the Saviour say them nay ?
No, He kindly bade them stay ;
Suffered none to turn away
Little ones like me.
Children then should love Him too,
Strive His holy will to do,
Tray to Him, and praise Him too
Little ones like me.
3.—CHILDREN ONWARD.
Seraph Songs , \o. 31.
CHILDREN, onward I onward for the Lord
Valiant soldiers, trusting in His word ;
Pressing onward, keeping heav’n in sight,
Fearing not. but daring to do right.
•17/o. —Christ is with us, onward we will go,
We shall triumph over every foe.
Vict’ry, vict’ry, vict’ry over sin,
Trusting Jesus, we shall surely win.
Children, onward I happy be your song,
Pressing ever thro’ the busy throng ;


Tarry not, nor cast a look behind.
Pressing onward, till the rest you find.
'Cho. —Christ is with us, &c.
Children, onward ! Jesus is your friend.
On His care you safely may depend ;
I fe will guide you while you journey here.
Trusting Jesus you need never fear.
Clio. —Christ is with us, &c.
Children, onward I lift your banners high,
Following still your leader to the sky ;
* Frist will guide us to His home above,
4 here to praise Him for His boundless love
€ho. —Christ is with us, &c.
4.—GRACIOUS SAVIOUR.
Methodist S.S. Hymn Book , Xo. 115. Tune 416.
RACIOUS Saviour, gentle Shepherd,
vJ Little ones are dear to Thee ;
Gathered with Thine arms and carried
In Thy bosom may we be ;
Sweetly, fondly, safely tended,
From all want and danger free.
Tender Shepherd, never leave us,
From Thy fold to go astray ;
By Thy look of love directed,
May we walk the narrow way ;
Thus direct us, and protect us,
Lest we fall an easy prey.
Let Thy holy word instruct us ;
Fill our minds with heavenly light ;
Let Thy love and grace constrain us
To approve whate’er is right ;
Let us feel Thy yoke is easy ;
Let us prove Thy burden light.


Taught to lisp the holy praises
Which on earth Thy children sin*?,
Both with lips and hearts unfeigned,
Glad thank-offerings may we bring ;
Then with all the saints in glory
Join to praise our Lord and King.
{After the Benediction.)
S.—OPEN THE BEAUTIFUL GATES.
Children's Hosannas , Xo. 12.
THERE is a beautiful story,
That when earth’s pilgrim’s get home.
To the bright mansions in glory,
No more to wander or roam ;
Be they so humble or lowly,
Yet a sweet welcome awaits,
This the grand song of the holy,
Open the beautiful gates ;
This the grand song of the holy,
Open the beautiful gates.
Cho. —Open the beautiful gates,
Here is a wand’rer that waits,
Weary and cold,
Out of the fold,
Open the beautiful gates.
Loved ones are leaving us ever,
Fading from you and from me,
And the dear faces we never,
Here in this earth home shall see ;
Heaven’s bright sunlight is falling,
Over the loved one that waits,
Angelic voices still calling,
Open the beautiful gates ;
Angelic voices still calling,
Open the beautiful gates.
Cho. —Open the, &c.


Wearily here we now wander,
Over the troublesome way,
Looking with glad eyes up yonder,
To that fair realm of bright dav :
%/ 7
Keeping the sweetest foreknowing,
Of all the bliss that awaits,
Hearing this song in our going,
Open the beautiful gates ;
Hearing this song in our going,
Open the beautiful gates.
Clio. —Open the, &c.

Methodist S.S. Hymn Bool'. No. 539. Tune 404
EATHER, from Thy throne of glory
Listen to our praise and prayer,
Thou hast spared us in Thy mercy,
Here to meet another year.
Crown, crown it, God of love,
With blessings from above ;
Fill our hearts, fill our hearts
With Thy fear and love.
Blessings more than we can number
Hitherto have marked our way ;
And Thine eye that knows no slumber,
Hath watched o’er us every day.
Praise, praise unto Thy name,
Praise, praise we loud proclaim ;
Heaven shall ring, heaven shall ring
With the loud acclaim.


Still vouchsafe to us Thy blessing,
And direct our future course ;
Still surround our every dwelling,
Thou who art of life the source.
Shine, shine upon our way,
May we Thy laws obey ;
Hear us now, hear us now,
Bless our school we pray.
Wilt Thou, O Almighty Father,
Bless our meeting here to-day,
Ere the night’s dark shades shall gather,
And our praises die away ?
Come Lord, and bless us now,
Thy grace and mercy show ;
Evermore, evermore
May Thy blessings flow.
May we all, when life is over,
Teachers, children, meet above,
Joining in that song for ever
Of our risen Saviour’s love.
Then shall we sweetly sing
Praise to our Saviour King ;
Heaven shall ring, heaven shall ring,
With the strain we sing.

Children's Hosannas , No. 39.
CtAVIOUR, breathe an evening blessing,
O Ere repose our spirits seal ;
Sin and want we come confessing,
Thou canst save and Thou canst heal :


Though destruction walk around us,
Though the arrows past us fly.
Angel guards from Thee surround us—
We are safe if Thou art nigh.
Though the night be dark and dreary,
Darkness cannot hide from Thee ;
Thou art He who, never weary,
Watchest where Thy people be :
Should swift death this night o’er take us
And our couch become our tomb,
May the morn in heaven awake us,
Clad in bright and deathless bloom.

I Suffer ttte IVittle Childreu,
Methodist S.S. Hymn Book, Ho. 106, Tunc 235..
GOD who hath made the daisies,
And every lovely thing,
He will accept our praises,
And hearken while we sing.
He says though we are simple,
Though ignorant we be,
Suffer the little children,
And let them come to Me.
Though we are young and simple,
In praise we may be bold.
The children in the temple
He heard in days of old.
And if our hearts be humble,
He says of you and me,
Suffer the little children.
And let them come to Me.
He sees the bird that wingeth
Its way o’er earth and sky,
He hears the lark that singeth
Up in the heaven so high,
Yet sees the heart’s low breathings
And says, well pleased to see,
Suffer the little children,
And let them come to Me.


'Therefore we will come near Him
And solemnly we’ll sing,
No cause to shrink or fear Him,
We’ll make our voices ring
For in His temple speaking,
He says of you ami me,
Suffer the little children,
And let them come to Me.

THROUGH the glorious heavenly arches.
Rang of yore the angels’ song,
And they longed to send the tidings
To the sons of men along.
Heav’n and earth were widely sundered,
And between was sin’s dread ban ;
’Twas too wide, too deep a chasm,
Wider than a song could span.
Chorus —Hallelujahs ever swelling
From the throne of God on high,
Let us echo back the tidings
That salvation now is nigh.
Hallelujah !
Echo the tidings
cu
Salvation is nigh.


So the King of heav’n for ever.
Prince of Peace, and Son of Light,
He himself became the message,
Left His throne of power and might.
Then the song became a cable,
Binding earth with yonder sky ;
And the glory in the highest
Was the Saviour’s lullaby.
And the bond still groweth stronger,
Still the song gains voices new,
As the ages, growing longer,
Prove his love, enduring, true.
Hallelujahs, loudly swelling,
Floating earthward meet our strain ;
Upward from our hearts are welling
Hallelujahs back again.
3 The hand of I*ove«
Methodist S.S. Hymn ißook, Mo. 439 , Time 175
THERE is a land of love,
God’s children know it well;
A holy place above,
Where saints and angels dwell.
Chorus. —Little children, come,
Come at God’s command ;
Find a sweeter, dearer home
In yonder happy land.
No vexing thoughts are there,
No sorrow and no pains ;
Eternal blessings where
Your dear Redeemer reigns.


And hallowed songs are snug
By loving hearts and true ;
And golden harps are strung
To strains for ever new.
In that divine abode
The Sabbath shines for ave,
The ransomed worship God
In everlasting day.
Your loving Saviour stands,
A welcome there to give ;
And calls with outstretched hands T
‘ O, come to Me, and live.’
And striving now with you,
o %j 7
The Holy Spirit given,
Is waiting to renew
o
And fit you all for heaven.
4 The Flight to Egypt.
Methodist SB. Hymn Booh, No. 138, Tone 95
THE fierce wind howls about the hills,
Most angrily, most drearily ;
The stars shine out with brilliant light,
O 7
t All tremblingly, all frostily ;
The bird lies sheltered in its nest,
The fox creeps to his crafty rest,
And angels watch by children blest,
All tenderly, all tenderly.


But who are these that through the night
Move wearily, all drearily 1
’Tis Joseph, forth from Brethlehem,
All hastily, all eagerly ;
For Herod seeks the Child to slay,
And death will come if they delay,
And forth ere ever break of day
They thus must flee, to Egypt flee.
The mother screens Him at her breast,
All carefully, all prayerfully ;
She feels Him shivering in the blast,
All fearfully, all tearfully ;
*•7 '
And so along their way they go,
Now numbed b\ r night winds as they blow,
Now starting, fearful of the foe,
All helplessly, all homelessly.
Had we been there, 0 gracious Lord,
Most tenderly, most lovingly,
Our hand, our home, our all were given,
To comfort Thee, to shelter Thee.
And we may still : for Thou hast said
When hungry little ones are fed,
And outcast ones find home and bed,
’Tis done to Thee, as unto Thee.
CAfter the Benediction.)
5; Qod is Qood.
Methodist S.S. Hymn Booh , No. 34, Tune 140•
SEE the shining dewdrops
On the flowers strewed,
Proving, as they sparkle,
God is ever good.


See the morning sunbeams
Lighting 1 up the wood,
Silently proclaiming
God is ever good.
Hear the mountain streamlet
In its solitude,
With its ripple saying
God is ever good.
In the leafy tree-tops,
Where no fears intrude,
Merry birds are singing
God is ever good.
Bring, my heart, thy tribute,
Songs of gratitude :
All things join to tell us
God is ever good.

SWEET Sabbath-school, place dear to
Where’er through life I roam,
My heart will often turn to thee,
My childhood’s Sabbath home.
O holy place ! where first we shed
The penitential tear ;
Where youthful steps are taught to tread
In paths of peace and prayer.


Within thy courts of Him I’ve heard,
Whose birth the angels sane* ;
When o’er the shepherds, filled with fear
The star of glory shone.
O holy place ! where first we shed
The penitential teai ;
Where youthful steps arc taught to tread
In paths of peace and prayer.
Sweet Sabbath-school, place dear to me,
Where’er through life I roam,
My heart will often turn to thee,
My childhood’s Sabbath home.
When all our wanderings here shall cease,,
And care and life shall end,
In God’s eternal Sabbath home
May we our anthems blend.

CHILDREN of Jerusalen
Sang the praise of Jesus’ name ;
Children, too, of later days
Join to sing the Saviour’s praise.
Hark ! while youthful voices sing
Loud hosannas to our King.
We have often heard and read
What the royal Psalmist said.
Babes and sucklings’ artless lays


Bhall proclaim the Saviour’s praise.
Hark ! while youthful voices sing
Loud hosannas to our King.
We are taught to love the Lord ;
We are taught to read His word ;
We are taught the way to heaven :
Praise for all to God be given !
Hark ! while youthful voices sing
Loud hosannas to our Kiner.
O
Parents, Teachers, old and young,

Higher and yet higher rise,
Till hosannas reach the skies.
Hark ! while youthful voices sing
Loud hosannas to our Kine.
J The Qreat I,ove of Christ,
Methodist S.S. Hymn Booh , No. 164, Tune 57.
There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.
We may not know, we cannot tell
What pains He had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.
He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Saved by His precious blood.


There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin,
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven and let us in.
0, dearly, dearly has He loved ;
And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.
4 i<et it Pass,
MethodUt S.S. Hymn Booh, Mo. 391, Tan
BE not swift to take offence,
Let it pass !
Anger is a foe to sense,
Let it pass !
Brood not darkly o’er a wrong,
Which will disappear ere long ;
Bather sing this cheery song,
Let it pass !
Echo not an angry word,
Let it pass !
Think how often you have erred,
Let it pass !
Since our joys must pass away,
Like the dewdrops on the spray,
Wherefore should our sorrow stay I
Let it pass !
If for good you suffer ill,
Let it pass !
O, be kind and gentle still,
Let it pass !


Time at last makes all things straight ;
Let us not resent but wait,
And our triumph shall be great :
Let it pass !
(After the Benediction.)
B Flowers.
Children'’s Hosannas, No. 57.
FLOW’RS of the garden, flowers of the
grove,
Blessings sent down by the Father in love;
Oft have your beauties sorrow beguiled,
For ye are fair in the eyes of a child.
Chorus —Gather bright flowers,
Glory to God who has given us
flow’rs, sweet flow’rs.
But there are sweet flow’rs found in the
heart,
Ne’er shall their freshness and fragrance
depart,
Planted by Jesus, nurtured by grace,
Changes shall never their beauty efface.
Faith, ever twining round the dear cross ;
Hope, never drooping, but smiling at loss ;
Love, e’er the same, come sunshine or show’rs,
Brightest and fairest, the queen of the flow’rs.
Now, in my childhood, Saviour divine,
Plant in my heart these flow’rets of thine ;
Earth ne’er afforded, Faith, Hope and Love,
Their native home is the garden above.

1 Hear Xhou in Heaven
Methodist S.S. Hymn Booh, No. 272, Tunc 206.
WHEN the weary, seeking rest,
To Thy goodness flee ;
When the heavy-laden cast
All there load on Thee ;
When the troubled, seeking peace,
On Thy name shall call ;
When the sinner, seeking life,
At Thy feet shall fall :
Chorus —Hear, then, in love, 0 Lord,,
the cry
In heaven, Thy dwelling-place
on high.
When the worldling, sick at heart,
Lifts his soul above :
When the prodigal looks back
To his Father’s love ;
When the proud man from his pride
Stoops to seek thy face ;
When the burdened brings his guilt
To Thy throne of grace.
Here then, etc.
When the stranger asks a home,
All his toils to end ;
When the hungry craveth food,
And the poor a friend ;
When the sailor on the wave


Bows the suppliant knee :
When the soldier on the held
Lifts his heart to Thee.
Here then, etc.
When the man of toil and care
In the city crowd,
When the shepherd on the moor
Names the name of (rod ;
When the learned and the high,
Tired of earthly fame,
Upon nobler joys intent,
Name the blessed name.
Here then, etc.

3 Angel Voices,
Methodist S.S. Hymn Booh , Xo. 92, Tune 249.
JLOYB to hear the story
Which angel-voices tell,
How once the King of glory
Came down on earth to dwell.
I am both weak and sinful,


But this I surely know,
The Lord came down to save me
Because he loved me so.
I’m glad my blessed Saviour
Was once a child like me,
To show how pure and holy
His little ones might be ;
And if I try to follow
His footsteps here below,
He never will forget me,
Because He loves me so.
To sing His love and mercy,
My sweetest songs I’ll raise;
And though I cannot see Him,
I know He hears my praise :
For he has kindly promised
That even I may go
To sing among His angels,
Because he loves me so.
4 Stray lambs,
Methodist S. S. Hymn Booh , Ao. 558, Time 464,
THE streets of the city are full
Of poor little perishing souls,
Who wander away from the light
In places that Satan controls !
They see not the snare at their feet ;
They know not the danger they’re in ;
O Saviour, can these be Thy lambs,
So changed and disfigured by sin ?
Famishing, perishing every day ;
Lambs of the flock, how they go astray !


Then out of the desert of sin,
And out of the darkness of night,
Go, bring the dear lambs to the flock,
And lead them up into the light.
Their voices with tenderness train,
Their wilfulness try to subdue ;
Be patient and tender with them,
As Christ has been patient with you.
Famishing, perishing every day ;
Lambs of the flock, how they go astray!
(After the Benediction.)
5 Onward, Children ! Onward $
Methodist SB. Hymn Booh , No. 283, Tune 159.
ONWARD, children! onward! leave the
paths of sin ;
Hasten to the strait gate, strive to enter in :
None can knock unheeded, none can strive
in vain,
For the Saviour’s welcome, all that seek
obtain.
•Chorus —Onward, children ! onward ! is the
call to-day;
Come with ready footsteps, and that
call obey.
Onward, children ! onward! in the narrow
way,
Christ your Lord shall lead you safely day by
dav,
j
And with such a Leader what have you to
fear ?


Satan may oppose you, but your King is
near.
Onward, children, etc.
Onward, children ! onward ! seek no cross
to shun ;
Mind when night approaches, that your work
is done ;
That you may with gladness, as life closes
here,
Enter death’s dark valley, having nought to
fear.
Onward, children, etc.
Onward, children ! onward ! guardian angels
sing :
Hasten to the palace of your God and King;
Clad in heavenly armour, to the end endure,
You with Christ shall triumph, victory is
sure.
Onward, children, etc.
Onward, ever onward! till you join the
throng
Who in dazzling raiment sing the triumph-
song ;
And to heavenly music cry with one accord,
* Holy ! holy ! holy ! is our sovereign Lord.
Onward, children, etc.

Keeping close beside you, glad as we can be,
Looking up to Jesus while we say ;
Welcome, welcome happy day !

While her many voices,

Praising God to-day.

Joyfully they bend our praise to hear,

On bright wings of love

Sweeping o’er the tide of years along,
Awake to-day,
Hosanna in the highest,
Glory be to Jesus evermore.

Mem’ry its pleasure oft will restore,
Till at the river, happy for ever,
Home we shall gather, safe on yonder shore.

SUMMER suns are glowing
Over land and sea,
Happy light is flowing,
Bountiful and free.

Int e mellow rays,
All earth’s thousand voices
Swell the psalm of praise.
God’s free mercy streameth
Over all the world,
And His banner gleameth
Everywhere unfurled.
Broad and deep and glorious
As the heaven above,
Shines in might victorious,
His eternal love.
Lord, upon our blindness
Thy pure radiance pour ;
For Thy loving kindness
Make us love Thee more.
And when clouds are drifting
Dark across our sky,
Then, the veil uplifting,
Father, be Thou nigh.
We will never doubt Thee,
Though Thou veil Thy light
Life is dark without Thee ;
Death with Thee is bright
Light of light I shine o'er us
On our pilgrim way ;
Go thou still before us
To the endless day.


4. THE VOICE OF JESUS.
Methodist Sunday School Hymn Booh , No. 326
Tune 59 —“ Land of Best.”
1 HEARD the voice of Jesus say,
‘ Come unto Me and rest ;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down,
Thy head upon My breast
1 came to Jesus as I was.
Weary and worn and sad ;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
1 Behold I freely give
The living water ; thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink and live;’
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream ;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.
1 heard the voice of Jesus say,
‘ I am this dark world’s Light ;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright
I looked to Jesus and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun !
And in that Light of life I’ll walk
Till travelling days are done.

Of happy saints above,

And sing and praise and love ?

And, through the Saviour’s merit,
Receive us as Thine own :
May we possess that treasure
Unfolded in Thy word.
And find seraphic pleasure
For ever with the Lord I

3. HUSHED WAS THE EVENING HYMN.
Methodist Sundag School Hymn Ho oh, No. 214.
Tune 101.
EUSITED was the evening hymn,
The temple courts were dark,
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark ;
When suddenly a voice divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine
The old man meek and mild,
The priest of Israel, slept ;
His watch the temple-child,
The little Levite, kept ;
And what from Eli's sense was sealed
The Lord to Hannah’s son revealed.


O ! give me Samuel’s ear,
The open ear, O Lord
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of Thy word ;
Like him to answer at Thy call.
And to obey Thee first of all.
O ! give me Samuel’s heart,
A lowly heart that waits
When in Thy house Thou art,
Or watches at Thy gates
By day and night, a heart that still
Moves at the breathing of Thy will
O ! give me Samuel’s mind ;
A sweet unmurmuring faith,
Obedient and resigned ,
To Thee in life and death ;
That I may read with childlike eyes
Truths that are hidden from the wise.

And raise thee to His throne.
