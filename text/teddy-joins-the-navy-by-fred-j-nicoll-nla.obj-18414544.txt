When Teddy’s Bush Friends helped him build
a Fine Boat,
They Shouted With Joy when they got it Afloat,
Teddy was Captain, and all his Brave Crew,
Were Dressed up in Caps and in Uniforms, too.
The Boat sailed on merrily, then it went Thump,
And stuck on a Log with a Terrible BUMP!
Poor Teddy so Sad, with a Tear in his Eye
Said “Let off a Rocket, right into the sky.”
a &
They all gathered round as the Rocket was lit
The Crew didn’t like it —not one Little Bit;
The Rocket went Up, and it made a Great Show,
But Poor Captain Teddy Forgot To Let Go!

What happened to Teddy, in Uniform Blue ?
You’ll know when you have read this Story

RACIOUS Me,” sighed Teddy as he gazed at what he had
been doing, “this is not as Easy As It Looks. In fact it is
VERY HARD.” Just outside his front door he had fixed up a table
which was covered with pieces of paper on which he had been drawing.
There were also a lot of Crayons red, yellow and blue. Pencils and
Rubbers were all over the place, for Teddy had been hard at work all
the morning, but somehow, didn’t seem to get very much done. He
went into his house to get a Pot of Jam to see if that would Help a
Bit. After eating about half of it, he felt EVER SO MUCH BETTER.
Jam always put Teddy in a Good Mood, and he started to sing this
little song:
“I Do hope these plans will soon be done,
Then I’ll build me a Bonny Big Boat,
And when it’s all finished I’ll get lots of Fun
If only the boat will Float.”
Johnny Kookaburra, who had been sitting on a branch of a gum-
tree said; “That’s a nice song, Teddy, what’s it all about?
Page 2


Teddy looked up in Great
Surprise. “Hello Johnny,” he said,
“I didn’t see you up there. Do you
know anything* at all about Boats?”
“About What?" asked Johnny.
“Boats,” said Teddy.
“Not very much,” replied Johnny,
but I know a lot about Grubs and
Thing’s.”
“Just what sort of Thing’s?”
asked Teddy.
“Well,” said Johnny, “Worms and
Lizards.”
Teddy sighed. “That wouldn’t
help One Bit, Johnny! Do you think
Hoppy the Hare or Benny Bunny
would know anything about Boats?”
hv tZ"rif a r, d - ask them ’ Teddy ” said John ">'- “I saw them playing
y the river this morning. They ought to know what Boats look like.”
Johnny flew away and quickly found the two friends, Hoppy and
Benny. He told them that Teddy had a lot of paper and pendls and
was trying to make a Boat. “He can’t make a boat Zt way ” sa”d
boat P f’or?” he W ° Uld g6t a " WCt and shlk ' What does he want a
,^ e didn’t say,” said Johnny,
but he wants you to go along and
help him.”
“All right,” said Hoppy, “let’s
go and see what it’s All About.”
When they got to Teddy’s place
he had just eaten a little more of
his jam, and some of it was still
sticking on his nose.
_ Hello Hoppy and Benny,” said
Teddy, “you are just in time to help
me.”
“What for?” asked Benny Very
Hopefully.
“To build a boat,” replied Teddy.


£k> Heart X I
“Oh!” said Benny sadly, “we
thought you meant we were just in
time to help you Finish The Jam.”
“What Jam?” asked Teddy,
crossly.
“The Other part that isn’t on
your Nose,” said Hoppy.
Teddy rubbed his nose with his
paw.
“One Thing At A Time,” he
said; “let me finish my work first,
then, perhaps, PERHAPS, Hoppy, we
can finish the Jam.”
“What are you drawing all
those Pictures for, Teddy?” asked
Benny.
“I’m going to Build a Boat,” Teddy replied, “and it will Float —at
least I Hope it Will,” he said doubtfully, scratching his ear again.
Benny looked at the pictures. “Wouldn’t it be better if you made
the boat FIRST, and painted pictures of it offer?” he asked.
“Don’t be silly, Benny,” Teddy said; “I’ve got to Draw the pictures
so I will know what the boat is Going To Look Like.”
“But how do you know the pictures will be like the Boat, when you
haven’t even started to Build It?” asked Hoppy.
“I think you’d better go away,”
said Teddy crossly; “You’re not the
slightest Bit of Help At All.”
“Hold on!” said Hoppy excitedly.
“I know! Let’s ask Pretty Pat
she has a very Big Book All About
Boats.”
“Why didn’t you think of that
before instead of Wasting All This
Time?” asked Teddy; “you and
Benny hurry off and ask Pat to
lend me the book. Now, then, Off
You Go.”
Page 4


“Benny looked Very Sad. “Teddy,” he said, “it’s such a long way
to Pat’s place —do you think we could have some jam before we go?”
Teddy picked up the pot of jam and looked inside. “Not much left,”
he said: “There’s really only enough for two. But perhaps you could
have a TINY bit, Benny; you are Very Little, you know.”
Benny hopped on a stump and Tried His Hardest to look Very Big.
Teddy divided up the jam, and when Benny had scraped the pot
Quite Clean, they went off to borrow the Big Book. Pat was delighted
to hear that Teddy had something to do, as it would Keep Him Out of
Mischief.
-r j/F* a Bi§r 800k ’ Hoppy ’” said Pat. “perhaps you’d better take
Teddy s cart, and Benny can help you. And tell Teddy when he’s all ready
to start the Boat we can borrow a lot of Tools from the Wood-man’s
camp. I’m sure he would lend them to him.”
“Thank you, Pat,” said Hoppy,
“I’m sure Teddy will be pleased. Come
on, Benny.”
They managed to get the Big
Book in the cart, and as it was a very
hot day, poor Hoppy and Benny were
Very Tired by the time they got back.
Teddy was delighted when he saw
what a Big Book it was, and as he
thought he’d like a little Jam himself,
he opened a pot and gave some to his
very hot and tired friends.


!|
\|| kla,wl€V Sh*
“Now,” said Teddy, “let’s all get to work.”
“Can we help?” asked Hoppy.
“Thank You Very Much,” said Teddy, “you run along and get the
Tools.”
Benny looked disappointed. “It’s such a long way, Teddy,” he said;
“what are You going to do? Won’t you come, too, and help?”
“I have to look right through this Big Book,” said Teddy, severely,
“and that’s a Very Important Job. All You have to do is to hurry along
and Bring Back the Tools.”
“Oh,” said Benny, “perhaps you’re right, Teddy. Shall we tell all the
others to come over and help us to build the Boat?”
“Yes,” said Teddy, “especially Kanga the Roo. He’s Very Strong.”
Hoppy and Benny scampered off, and soon had the truck all loaded
up with Saws, and Hammers, and All Sorts of Things.
On the way back they met
Johnny Kookaburra, and told him
to try and find Kanga the Roo,
Emma Emu and Tony the Tortoise.
“All right,” said Johnny, ‘Til
see if I can find them. But I’ll
leave a message just in case they
come this way.” So he nailed a
big notice to a tree, and it said:
“HELP WANTED BY TEDDY.
Please HURRY.”
When they got back, Teddy
had at last decided what sort of
Boat he wanted to build, and
before long Kanga and Emma Emu
arrived.
Teddy set them all to sawing
Page 6


down trees, and while Hoppy and Benny got very hot turning the handle
of the saw, Kanga pushed in the logs.
“What are YOU doing, Teddy?” asked Benny; “You’re not very busy.”
“Indeed, I am, Benny,” he said, “I’m making up a Song. It goes
like this:
“Hoppy and Benny are Very Good Boys,
But doesn’t that saw make a Terrible Noise!
If they work Very Hard without even One Squeak,
The Boat will be finished in Less Than A Week!”
“That’s not fair, Teddy,” said Kanga; “you have left ME out of your
Song.”
“You’re Quite Right, Kanga,” replied Teddy; “you should not be
Left Out. In fact, I’ll put you IN at once. How about This?”
“Another Grand Chap who’s working hard, too,
Is our dear old friend Kanga Kanga the Roo.”
Thank you Very Much, “Teddy,” said Kanga gratefully.
Just then they heard a loud
puffing and blowing, and Tony the
Tortoise came creeping out of the
bush.
“You are Very Late, Tony,”
said Teddy crossly, “and whatever is
that Big Thing you’ve got tied on
your Back?”
“I found it, Teddy,” replied
Tony. I thought it would do for a
gun or a funnel for your Boat. I
hope you won’t make me take it
back again, Teddy. I’m Very Tired,
and it’s a long way and I’m So Hot.”


“Thank you, Tony,” said Teddy
Kindly; you are Very Thoughtful;
Fm sure it will come in handy.
Perhaps we could cook our Dinner
in it. Now cuddle up and have a
little rest, then you can help build
the Boat.”
Tony crawled away, and tucking
his head inside his shell was soon
asleep.
By this time plenty of wood was
ready, and Kanga brought a lot of
iron and wheels and things that he
had found near an old mine. Soon
Teddy had them all hard at work at
last on the real job of building the
Boat.
The next day Pat came to see how they were getting on, and was
surprised to see how hard everyone was working.
“Pat, what do you think of ALL THAT?” asked Teddy, proudly.
“It’s going to be a Grand Boat, Teddy,” she said; “won’t you have
great Fun. I’ll hurry home now and make you all some Uniforms.”
Teddy clapped his hands with joy. “That will be FINE,” he cried;
“will mine be Very Pretty, Pat?” he asked.
“Oh yes, Teddy,” she replied, “as you will be the CAPTAIN, it will
have Gold Buttons and Braid and Everything.”
Page 8


Teddy jumped up and down with excitement. “Thank you, Pat,” he
said as she hurried off to get on with the sewing.
About a week later the Boat was finished and all ready to launch.
Teddy called a meeting of all his friends, and standing on a box said:
“Friends, the Boat is Finished At Last, and now it must have a NAME.
Now please say what you think we should call it, and don’t all speak At
Once. You first, Benny.”
“I think ‘BENNY’ would be a Very Nice Name Indeed,” he said.
“Nonsense, Benny,” Teddy said crossly; “the Boat is far too big to
be called after a little chap like You. What do You say, Emma?”
Emma Emu looked very thoughtful. “Well,” she said, “EMMA is a
very nice name. It’s easy to spell, too, and won’t use up a lot of Paint.”
Then they all started to speak at once. Kanga wanted the boat to be
named after Him, and Hoppy said that of all the names he could ever
think of, he couldn’t think of a better one than “Hoppy.” Tony the
Tortoise, and Squeaker Squirrel were arguing about Their names, but at
last Teddy held up his hand and said:
“Now please stop your squabbling, I’ve settled All That—
“I vote that the Boat will be called ‘PRETTY PAT.’”
“Hooray,” they all cried, “that’s the best name of All. Hooray!”
The Boat did look fine as it stood all ready to be pushed into the
water. It had a Sail and an Anchor and a Gun and Everything.


The very next morning they got
a lot of ropes, and while Kanga,
Tony, Hoppy and Benny pulled, all
the others pushed as hard as they
could. After a lot of PUSHING and
PULLING, at last they got the Boat
into the water. “Hooray,” cried
Teddy, “it FLOATS!” Now,” he said
jumping down, “we want a First
Mate and a Cook.”
Everybody wanted to be First
Mate and Nobody wanted to be the
Cook, and the squabbling started all
over again. At last Teddy said:
“The First Mate has to Give
Orders and needs a Very Loud Voice.
Now go behind that Big Tree one
after the other, and call out ‘Ship
Ahoy.’ The one with the Biggest
Voice will get the job.”
“First Mates don’t have to do
much work, Teddy, do they?” asked
Benny.
“Well, Benny,” replied Teddy, “not a Terrible lot. It’s mostly
GIVING ORDERS.” One after another they went behind the Big Tree
and called out “Ship Ahoy” as loudly as they could, and at last it was
Benny’s turn. As he went behind the tree, he pulled a large sheet of
paper out of his pocket and rolled it
up. Then he put it to his mouth and
called out as Loudly As He Could:
“SHIP AHOY! SHIP AHOY!”
■ His friends were Terribly Sur-
prised.
“Gracious, Benny,” said Teddy;
“I had No Idea that you had such
a Loud Voice! Have you a Cold or
something?”
“It was your Jam, Teddy,” replied
Benny; if I could have some more I
could sing out Twice as Loud.”
“Benny,” said Teddy, “I think
your voice is quite Loud Enough.”

Just then Peter Pelican came flopping- out of the sky and perched
on a limb. “Hello, Teddy,” he said, “can I sail on your Big Boat.”
“I don’t know, Peter,” replied Teddy: “do you know anything about
Guns, please?” “Yes,” said Peter, “there are Thousands of them in the
bush.”
“Thousands of WhatT ’ asked Teddy in surprise.
“Gum-trees,” replied Peter.
“Not gum-trees” said Teddy, crossly, “GUNS.”
“Oh,” replied Peter, “Fm afraid I don’t, but if you will let me sail
on your Boat I’ll tell you something that will please you Very Much.”
“Tell me First, Peter,” said
Teddy.
“Well, it’s This Way,” replied
Peter; “Pat asked me to come and
tell you she had the Uniforms all
ready, and a large box of Other
Things for you.”
“What sort of Other Things,
Peter?”
“I’m not sure,” replied Peter,
“but there are Three Boxes, and a
long stick sort of a thing, with
Another Thing on the end of it.”
“We’d better get Kanga and
Emma to go and Bring Back Every-
thing,” said Teddy. So off they went
and very soon returned.
“Wonder what’s in the Boxes?”
asked Teddy excitedly; “off with the
Lids!” Soon the boxes were opened
and Teddy sat down plop with
Surprise.


“FIREWORKS!” he cried,
“Gracious ME!”
“Can I let some off, Teddy,”
asked Benny. ~ „ ~
“Indeed Not, Benny,” said Teddy
severely. “You are Far Too Little.
Wait till you Grow Up. Besides, we
will have to wait till it’s dark to see
fireworks properly.”
“Will I be grown up by the time
it’s dark?” asked Benny anxiously.
“No, Benny,” replied Teddy, “but
if you are good you can help me let
them off.”
“Now you and Tony get all the
boxes down to the Boat, Benny,” said
Teddy, “while we look at the Uniforms
Pat has sent, and if you Hurry Up you can try Yours on too.”
By the time Benny got there, Teddy and all his friends had their
..nifnrm* nn and went to the Boat. “Here’s your uniform, Benny, said
uniforms on, and went to the Boat.
Teddy.
show, and Teddy told them all to
at this moment Pretty Pat arrived.
“You DO Look Nice!”
They certainly made a grand
stand up straight and salute. Just
“Well, Well, Teddy,” she said;
“Thank you, Pat,” replied Teddy, “and what do you think of Kanga
and Emma and Benny and All of the Others?”
“Splendid,” said Pat, “and what a
Fine Boat!”
“And Pve made up a Little Song,
Pat,” said Teddy; “shall I sing it?”
Teddy’s little song went something
like this:
“We’ll sail on the Ocean,
And over seas Blue,
And Hoppy and Benny
Will be in the Crew,
With Emma and Tony
And Kanga the Roo,
And this Lovely Boat, Pat,
Is named after YOU.”
“Excellent, Teddy,” said Pat; “You
Do make up nice songs. How do you
manage it?”
“It’s Quite Easy,” replied Teddy
proudly, “but you’ve got to KNOW
HOW.”

“I must hurry home now,” said
Pat; “I have some shopping to do.
Now be careful, Teddy, and don’t go
and get into a lot of mischief!”
“Very well, Pat,” replied Teddy
obediently, “everything will be Quite
All Right.”
Pat hurried off, and Teddy began
to call out Orders. Soon smoke was
coming out of the funnel, and the
boat slowly started to sail down the
wide river. But it was Far Too Slow
for Teddy!
“Benny,” he called, “go down to
the engine room and tell Hoppy to
put more wood on the fire. We must
Get A Move On.”
Benny went off, and soon Much
More Smoke was coming out of the funnel and the Boat began to move
ever so Quickly.
“Is it Quite Safe, Teddy?” asked Benny anxiously; “look opt for
that Log!”
“I see it,” said Teddy; “we’re all right. I’ll miss it by a Mile!”
But Something must have Gone Wrong, for the Big Log got Right in
the Way, and the Boat hit the log with a Terrible BUMP!
“We’re in for it Now, Teddy,” cried Benny; “whatever will we Do?”


Teddy scratched his ear.
“I know,” he cried, “we’ll send
up a Rocket. Then everyone will
know we are IN TROUBLE.”
“May I let it off, please?” asked A
Benny. Hoppy got the rocket and f
Teddy held it. “Now, Benny,” he
said, “light the match, and don’t ‘f|’
Burn Your Fingers.”
Benny lit the match and held it
to the rocket. It fizzed and splut-
tered for a minute, then All Of A f
Sudden, and before Teddy could let
go, off it went with a WHOOSH 3
straight up into the sky! ,#
His friends gazed up in astonish-
ment as poor Teddy got Smaller and

Smaller! / ai § /
“NOW look what you’ve done, Benny,” cried Hoppy; “what if it
Goes on Going Up and Never Comes Back!”

“What if he lands at the North Pole and Freezes?” asked Kanga.
/ W f f/T1 i
“What if he goes right up to the Sun and Frizzles?” said Emma.
“Suppose he lets go, Benny, What Will Happen Then?” asked Kooka.
js ■
And while they were just wondering, Teddy was going Up and Up. He
was very scared, and sparks kept falling on him and burning holes in
his fur. He wished he hadn’t let Benny light the Rocket.
“I’d better make up a little song
to Pass The Time Away,” he said:
“I’m up in the sky, Oh! Ever So High,
But I don’t like this At All—
I don't want to fly, and I’m sure by
and by
I’m going to have a Big Fall!”
“That’s Very Good, considering ,”
said Teddy, “but I’m still going UP,
Bother It. Hullo! What’s This?”
He noticed that he was no longer
going up, but was coming DOWN.
And the trouble was he was coming
Down much faster than he went UP!
Page 14

Then All Of A Sudden he found he was both UP and DOWN!
“Gracious,” he said, “Pm certainly Down, but somehow Fm Downside
UP!”
“Whoo Whoo!” said the deep voice of Mr. Owl; “Who are you?”
“Stop saying- Whoo, Whoo!” said Teddy, crossly looking at the Owl,
“Fm Teddy. And why, may I ask, are you Upside Down?”
“Fm Right Way Up,” replied the Owl; “it’s YOU that is Upside
Down.”
“Am I?” asked Teddy.
“You ARE,” said the Owl. “What day is it, please?”
“Tuesday,” replied Teddy, “and it’s about four o’clock. At least it
was about four o’clock when Benny
Let Off The Rocket. Why?”
“I see you didn’t read my Notice,”
said the Owl; “I only receive visitors
on Mondays and Fridays from 9.30
to 11.30. Mornings Only.”
“Oh,” said Teddy, “Fm sorry,
Mr. Owl, and if you will help me to
get down I’ll call next Friday.”
“Very Well,” said the Owl, “at
9.30, please.”
Teddy at last got down, but when
he saw the Big Hole in his trousers,
he was a Very Sad Teddy.
“I wonder what Pat will say?”
he said.

He hurried off home trailing his torn trousers behind him. He was
Very Sad. His beautiful Boat had been Wrecked, and he couldn’t Help
Thinking of poor Benny and Hoppy and Tony and all of the Others.
At last he got in sight of his house, and to his surprise he saw Pat
getting his tea ready. Johnny Kookaburra had flown off to tell her all
about the Wreck and Teddy and the Rocket and Everything, and that all
the Others had got off the Boat safely. So Pat hurried to Teddy’s place
to have his tea all ready for him. Teddy gave a shout of joy, and
started to run as Fast As He Could. When they were sitting down
eating Cakes and Blackberry Jam, Teddy sighed happily, and Pat said:
“Don’t eat all the cakes, Teddy;
the Others will be home soon, and
I’m sure they will be hungry.”
“Very well, Pat,” he replied.
Then he sighed again, and said Very
Seriously:
“The Boat got wrecked, and I was Sad,
But now I’m feeling Ever So Glad,
