In the House of the Soul
(Harlequin and a Woman under one Skin)
TXT" ell, they are gone !
* ' And we are here alone :
I, the mime, and master of surprises.
Who have fooled that mob with fifty new disguises?
You, who sit still in the soul
Like a quiet wife ;
You, who are Control,
Weaving the long continuous web of life.
I should have little courage to continue with this jest
Could I not meet you here, and be at rest.
Sometimes I think that there is nothing of my winning.
That all we have of service from our union is your
spinning ;
But when of shame my heart is full?
Then you remind me, dame :
I bring you wool.
It is our business here to make a song?
Whoever is sore, whatever is wrong.
King Alfred and the Peasant Woman
''"P'hrew me from the house, did he ?
A Well, to new chivalry that is no great thing !
I am my father?s daughter, Lady,
And he?s a pretty figure in the ring.
But my man, my master, there he sat a-dreaming,
While all the house might burn, and he?d not sorrow ;
Nor had I any warrant that his scheming
Would bring us any victory on the morrow.


And I spoke to him?O I informed him !
He?d be a dead man, if he were not stung.
Could any man keep hands down, and me lashing ?
Ach, you insult my tongue !
I?d rather he fought me than missed his combats.
Though I?m not built for blows upon the heart.
Give me a breastplate and I?ll at ?em?
Though that?s fool-woman?s part!
I love him, and if he comes back with honour,
After the fight I drove him to is won.
He?ll find his woman, with her glory on her :
Please God, the child?s a son !
The Venturous Shepherdess
T isten, good Ewes, to this wonderful thing I
There?s a troll in your woods, with the eyes of
King.
I have marked out the path to his cave with a stone,
And I?ll drive him with boughs to the height of a throne
For he shall inherit your grazing land ;
His head is an orb, and a sceptre his hand.
I?ll run to the hills, and run to the glen.
And call to the maidens, and call to the men :
? Wake, sleepy folk, to this wonderful thing?
In a cave of your woods, I have found you a King;
In a cave of your woods, I have found you a Lord ;
His word is a crown, his glance is a sword !


? Bring spears, ye striplings ; hunt for his pleasure !
Bring flowers, ye girls, and dance for his leisure !
With rare sweet food shall the King be fed.
And ten white maids shall smooth him his bed ;
And I will sit and laugh all my life,
For a keeper of sheep is the King-troll?s wife.?
Song of the 'Lonely Shepherd
(Written for Mme. Nicklass Kempner)
T found her asleep in the snows :
Her head and her feet were bare,
And she was like a wild sweet rose
By miracle flung there.
I carried her in to my love and my rest.
And I thawed her feet at my breast.
And all the winter long
She neither spoke nor stirred :
My heart made a happy song
(O I was blithe as a bird ! ) :
? There?ll be an end to these bitter days ;
I?ll see her dance down flowery ways.?
And on an April morning,
Alas ! I was early abroad
To pluck a crown for adorning
The head that my soul adored?
Alas and alas ! I was home too late :
The cruel feet had danced out through my gate


O little feet, matched like two happy lovers.
Have you no pity on me ?
Know ye not that this sheepskin covers
Sore wounds, and my piteous misery ?
Your ice has burned a brand on my breast;
Then lead her back, to my love and my rest!
The Heavenly Bitch
TV J aster, O master, turn to me, speak !
?1-? A Why do you wander, and what do you seek
Long on the edge of this foetid lake ?
Come with me, come for your leman?s sake.
We drowned a priest in that horrible hole.
And weighted his corpse with a live man?s soul.
The air is thick with his odious stink :
O walk no more by the deathly brink.
Master, O master, why do you stare ?
What do you see on the lake out there ?
It?s only a clot of floating weed.
Why do you wait ? O will you not heed !
In the mud of the lake, a saint lies dead
With a live man?s soul for a stone at his head.


It is no weed looks up at the sky
A.s if the mere were a beast with one eye.
This is my winnings, this my reward,
That my soul is tied to a stretching cord,
To the rotting flesh of a silly priest:
It has mounted to air like a bubble in yeast;
It is mocked at noon by the high hot light,
A.nd stars invade its void by night.
Girl, my girl, I would have it again.
My flesh dissolves to ash with pain.
Master, O master, am I not your witch ?
See ! I am transformed to an old black bitch ;
So I run swift through the menacing night
To your cave, to your shelter, to your delight.
And I am a valiant swimmer, my lord :
I will fetch the stone for love?s reward.
I?ll pay for the gift you were loath to take.
For a feeble, pitiful changeling?s sake.
I?ll swim to the saint, and swim to the land.
And lay the stone in my master?s hand.
The stinking beast with the single eye
Shall not stare in vain at the stubborn sky :
For, if my lord would climb to their Heaven,
Importunate doors of the sky shall be riven ;
A bitch shall lurk at God?s high gate
And yap and yap at his solemn state
Till she wreck God?s peace with her tireless din
And Saints shall open and let her man in.


The Girl and the Jester
A si ran weeping out of the house
Of my foster-mother. Misrule,
Carolling high of the loves of a mouse,
I met the Cardinal?s fool.
Now, he was meagre and he was thin,
But a wonderful man to see ;
For a curious light shone out of his skin,
And he came and accosted me.
He said with never a smile or bow :
? How little you honour your face ;
You?re wearing it very uncivilly now,
And so you offend God?s grace.?
He plucked my sleeve with his finger and thumb
? How little you honour your hands !
For over your weaving they wander glum
To sully its intimate strands.
? Come, give me your jewel, my girl,? said he.
I raised my hand to my breast;
And there by unholy wizardry
I found an adder?s nest.
Then I ran shrieking back to the house
Of my foster-mother, Misrule :
To my brother the Tiger, my sister the Mouse,
I set myself to school.
Now Beauty and Peace are pensioners here
And all for the love of a fool.


War of the Cave
Old Witch, old Witch, come lend me your broom !
Himself is walking the pine-wood?s gloom
With Dulcibella, the wench of the farm.
She has a mouse?s wit beneath her hair ;
We of the craft must have a care
Or he?ll take harm.
Old Sloven, Sloven, are you not shamed
Of your sucking Wizard ? She?s inflamed
To think herself a goddess from his cozening !
She?ll teach him flight;
Climb slow before him to a dung-hill?s height
And queen it with him for a vassal king.
Ach, you have lost your claws, old Cat!
Time and your sloth have seen to that!
Yet there is virtue in you, that I now concede !
By this unwonted courtesy, by this most silly honesty,
I beg a broom of you, though I?ve no need.
Would you withhold him from me?you a fairy-woman ?
Can you be jealous, like a puling human ?
If he be that fine essence you believe him?
If you. Witch-mother, are not blind and daft?
Now, for the honour of our kind and craft.
I must fly farmwards, to retrieve him.
Your broom, your broom, I say ! Give it me quick !
Else I am out, away, on my own stick :
I?ll to the zenith with him in straight flight;
Upwards I?ll sweep on a fiend-driven wind.
With your sweet changeling pillioned behind,
To dash his carrion from the utmost height!


Song of Ophelia the Survivor
npHERE is no smirch of sin in you, only its fires.
You are a man burned white with merciless desires ;
A restless heat consumes you, and your brain,
Tortured to torturing, craves for ugly pain.
Beauty still lives in you, and from her seat
Controls your glances, and directs your feet;
One look from you taught me so much of love,
I have all pleasure, just to watch you move.
That look was like a wet blue mist of flowers.
Which held compelling loveliness and sleepy powers.
I dreamed of calling pipes down a warm glade ;
By the transposed music of your soul I was betrayed.
Pipe for me, my dear lover ! I will come.
And your sick soul shall find in me a home ;
I will be your house, clean, high, and strong.
And You shall live in me, all winter long.
As you are fevered, I will be a pool.
Full of green shadows, level, silent, cool.
You shall bathe in me, in my being move ;
I will put out your fires with my strong love.


lament of the Red Knight
npREE-blossom and May
Are vanished away ;
The mad merry month is over.
Alas ! and alas !
How came it to pass
Not all that month was I any woman?s lover ?
The Queen sits up in her sullen bower ;
Her eyes shoot wrath like darts from a tower.
Such a melancholy harridan never was seen !
But alas 1 and alas ! I love the Queen.
Now I must bear Winter to every warm glade ;
For never again will I kiss a young maid.
The Captive
T loved so that my blood became new substance.
Like the wine of priests.
There was no Time for me, but one eternal moment of
desiring :
The woman had one scented garment;
I had one sense, to find her.
I came to her chamber ;
She was upon her bed :
The room was heavy with incense ;
It was lighted by high tapers ;
The woman?s skin shone like as a stormy moon.


She was more gracious than reality.
More lovely than phantasy ;
She slept, her upturned palms invited me.
What spell could keep me by the curtains of the door ?
In the shadows of the walls were pillars the height of
men;
They were boxes faced with glass :
I stept stealthily, and gazed at them ;
They were dead men, coffined dead men.
High in the dome of the chamber was a raven chained.
A voice fell like a stone :
? This woman?s name is Beauty; her lovers are dead
men :
Go, bridegroom, to her bed ! ?
Then I would have gone out into the sun
Where rosy mothers played with children in the air.
The woman?s skin shone like a stormy moon :
My soul died like a candle that is blown out,
And like the smoke of an extinguished candle trailed my
song :
? Let me die, O Beauty, let me die ! ?


Love Song
T am like sand sucked down by the tide ;
Love has compelled my soul:
Not for my fears, not for my pride.
Can I regain control.
I must be still with the thought of fire ;
I cannot move for pain :
Woman I am, transposed by desire
To a broad upland plain.
I am a down, spread green by the sea ;
And white cliffs are my feet:
My hair is a wood, and the breasts of me,
Hills where storms meet.
Between the hills is a broad white road
Down which a king shall ride :
I am firm earth, with the earth?s load ??
I, who was drawn by the tide.
When I remember your horse?s feet,
I am like mountain grass ;
And your young colts so free and fleet
Shall trample me?and pass.


Song to Amidon
Fragrance,
Be no more a man
But a small hill of herbs !
And I will take you in my hands
And press you to more intimate fine scent;
And I will hold you to my heart
Till I know grace.
The hungry winds shall woo me for your sake.
Incontinent, I?ll fling you to high air ;
And you, ascending to poor God?s assault.
Shall burden Heaven with your subtle sweet,
Till he repent him of old odorous smoke
And fling out bolts to throw the altars down.
Inconsequent Lover
T will drive you down odorous hours
With a whip of white exquisite flowers,
Till, worn by my wooing, you lie
On a bed of delight, and so die.
I will steal from the magicky night
Blue Moth for a young acolyte ;
And a sad, solemn mass shall be said
For the beautiful thing that is dead.


The Winds
npHE quality of your rage is my delight:
I saw a wind in a volcanic night
Incline a fir-wood almost to the ground.
And with such strength that I could hear no sound
So is your anger written for my mind.
In driven trees, and in that mastering wind.
A quality of courage is my gift.
First would you wreck, O Builder ? Lift
Your hammer against me, and strike your fill;
Cleave me to dust?and from that dust my will
Will rise in spirals, masterful as flame.
Till whirlwinds march in triumphs of your name !
Song
X/'our spirit is my treasury.
My storehouse and my armoury.
There rich, bright stuffs are found
And rare sweet foods abound;
With curious knives designed to slay
Those prowlers of the night and day
Who ate my noon and took my sleep.
And held me captive in my keep.
Now in your being I can move,
My air, my path, my fight, my love !


Garnett*s Garden
T look down from my window.
And I see
A ramble of forget-me-not
Beneath a flowery tree ;
As if the sky had fallen
To let pass
A lovely girl
To dance upon the grass.
I could lie happy dead beneath your garden
If my soul could walk the skies
With such white lovely women,
In a cool paradise.
Mare Bred from Pegasus
?C\)R God?s sake, stand off from me :
There?s a brood mare here going to kick like hell
With a mad up-rising energy ;
And where the wreck will end who?ll tell ?
She?ll splinter the stable and eat a groom.
For God?s sake, give me room ;
Give my will room.
? Make Beauty for me ! ? ?that was what you said,
While I was cowering at your dying fire.
Laconic, blowing at your chill desire.
Then flame broke out in me to char you dead ;
A fierce hope and a more fierce distrust
To char your bones to dust.


My pretty jockey, you?ve the weight
To be a rider, but not my mate ;
And yet your spirit?s bold to impregnate.
And I?m a lashing, butting hate.
Since my poor life began
I had desire to serve my man
With all my wit, all imagination,
And every subtle beauty of creation ;
And you come late,
And mock me in my masterless hard state.
? Make Beauty for me ! ? ?that was what you said.
Desire rose up in me to strike you dead,
With that mad mare my will
To lash and smash her fill.
Run, run, and hide you in some woman?s heart.
In a retreat I cannot kick apart!
Pilgrimage
T think of the room at Bon Secours :
The clock on the shelf, and the bare-board floor.
The tallow smell from the out-blown light.
And the laughter and love of the prodigal night:
I wish we were young, dear,
As young and as poor
As when we stole Heaven
At Bon Secours.


Call of the Dead
'T'he stone is riven, I?m free, I?m free.
Come out, my Ransomer, out to me.
Leave the wrecked tenement behind ;
The night is ours, and the night wind.
Up we ride from the dim places.
Out we swim through the great spaces.
Driven in tracks of liberty
On ether-piercing ecstasy.
Follow me quick, my Love, my Friend,
To the blue steep at Time?s end.
The Boor?s Wooing
T love her for her fine blue coat.
And for that ivory at her throat
All cut about in charming shapes.
Small flowers, and nests, and birds and grapes.
I love her for her white, deft hands.
With what an art, she smooths the strands
Of Chloe?s hair to make a seemliness
Among the gins of that sweet-scented wilderness !
But most, I love the farmwoman who drowses
While my fine lady walks the dim-lit houses :
And by my head ! that canny wench shall wake
And laugh and labour for her peasant?s sake.


When first I saw her in her painted room
My unskilled silence spoke her doom.
What call had I to waste my power in speech
When what I willed was still beyond my reach ?
But I have cut a rope from the tough vine.
And I?ve distilled a draught more strong than wine
First she shall drink, and then I?ll draw her hence.
To pin an apron on her elegance.
And she shall kilt her skirt, and bare her arms.
And live about my fields, and on my farms.
Is she thin Venus on a painted fan ?
No ! she?s right woman, and Myself?s her man 1
The Silent Singer
T have no words that could prevail
Against the furies of my male.
When we go out I come behind,
While he expounds his angry mind :
O I walk humbly in the path
Of his just wrath !
Then he goes singing?
Sings like a mavis, or a boy.
From a still secret source of joy;
And I am all humility,
His pleasure?s me.
Silent I follow many a mile?
Trying my hardest not to smile?
To my heart?s singing.


The Sick Assailant
T hit her in the face because she loved me.
-*? It was the challenge of her faithfulness that moved
me;
For she knew me, every impulse, every mood.
As if my veins had run with her heart?s blood.
She knew my damned incontinence, my weakness ?
Yet she forbore with her accursed meekness.
I could have loved her had she ever blamed me;
It was her sticky, irritating patience shamed me.
I was tired-sick. It was her business to amuse me :
Her faith could only daunt me and confuse me.
She was a fine great wench, and well I knew
She was one good half panther, one half shrew?
Then why should my love, more than any other.
Induce in her the silly human Mother ?
She would have nursed me, bathed me, fed me, carried me;
She?d have burned her soul to thaw me?she?d have
married me !
I hit her in the face because she loved me ;
It was her sticky, irritating patience moved me.
The Shameless Lady
Qaid the lass that I love, one flowery May :
? Ho, thou great loon, go away ! go away !
For thou?lt not lay thy head to my breast.
Go find some other to share that jest;
It?s little grace thou?lt get from me,
For I have all that I need of thee.


? Before this happy year is done.
I?ll yield my heart to my own sweet son.
A girl has small need for a man, I say.
With work to be done, and a babe on the way.
I?ll bear a boy when my time is done ;
For I loved thee well, three months agone.?
And she?d not go to the church that year ;
Though I wooed her long, for I loved her dear.
And when at last she deigned to come.
The little master slept at home ;
Said she, ? I loved for this happy thing.
And not for a farm, and not for a ring.?
A Girl to her Baby
r dear Postilion, who has caught the rein
To set this colt upon her road again ;
She will not fear the smart of any spur
For the strong sires who set the seed of her.
For stout hill-mares who fasted in the snows
When frost had blackened such poor grass as grows :
Let thy red livery be a note of joy
To all who starve and stray, thou lovely boy !


The Happy Mathematician
(An Arithmetic Lesson for a small boy
Written for John Untermeyer )
When he was nine, he thought he knew
All about two times two.
He sang his tables out aloud.
And he was very glad and proud.
He thought: ? I?ll not be weak or poor,
Because twice two are always four;
I know this now, and I?ll get knowledge
Even more fine, when I?m at college.?
When he was ninety-nine or more.
Wise Death came knocking at his door.
Death said : ?As you get nearer Heaven,
Twice two are five or six or seven ;
And at the centre of God?s heart.
The whole is as the smallest part.?
The old man laughed : ? That interests me
Teach me your tables, Death,? said he.
The Boy and the Trees
Some day she will come to me
All lit-up like a Christmas tree.
Her arms out-stretched like lovely boughs.
And meet me in my Mother?s house ;
And so my lips will touch her breast,
And I will be at rest.


Then I will wake in golden morn,
With me and all the world reborn ;
And from my window I shall see
My Mother by an apple tree.
And I will call her frank and clear;
And she will pluck a rosy sphere
And fling it from her lovely hands
And laugh like one who understands
That fragrant fruit so red and sweet.
My Love shall eat.
The Show
T am no man?s love,
But a lonely devil
Tossing the balls of good and evil;
Slogging the air :
A mime at a fair !
I am no man?s love,
But a bearded wench
Lolling in a booth on a scarlet bench.
Where yokels come to grin, and see
What I be !
I am no man?s love.
But a five-legged calf;
And I am penned to raise a laugh ;
And now and then I try to run?
And that?s the fun.


The Sportsman
T?m watching my power and my rapture
Go by me like leaves on a wind :
If I held up my hand, I could capture
And hold them?if I had the mind.
Is it Hell that I fear for my soul.
Or Heaven I?d come to at length ?
No ! I?m staking to-day on Control!
I?m backing an ultimate Strength !
Stable Talk
TXT' hen the hart pursues the hunter
* ? God send that I?m a punter !
When that strange race begins.
We know which wins.
The hunter will need little start
To get away from the poor hart:
Though he pursued her reckless while she ran.
He?ll run, to see a deer turn on a man.
Harts, if you would thrive and live
And keep a thing you have no wish to give.
When first you see the hunter come pursuing.
Go out to meet him with a hotter wooing.


Pugilist
npnouGH I am well-clothed, well-booted, and well-fed,
I yet have the hunger of Hell in me
For a dream that is dead ;
And that, though I have gained two grades in rank.
Have a horse, and a house, and gold in the bank.
My mind is dull with fullness, yet I know
I have one utter need?
To find a foe !
I will strip off this fine constricting coat
And grip Necessity by his thin throat.
The Striker at the Gate of A.U-Sloth
How long have you lingered on the ways
To be inhabited by the first wanton ;
Your guest-chamber befouled
By any insensitive penetrating Will ?
Most hypnotisable poor soul,
What is left for honour but your sterility?
That Will in you has not consented to a base conception ;
That you have chosen the ugliness of still-birth.
And have not raised posterity to Death !
The Begetter is come, O Daughter of Joy.
He is enamoured of your shape :
Yet for his love he?ll work his way with scorn !
He woos you with a whip. Now you are free to fear ;
And the fruitfulness in you, so long controlled.
Will break its barriers like a dam its wall
And Chaos shall be all about.
From him, so long awaited, you shall fly !


Long have you masqueraded through a hundred false
alliances.
Let chastity be your garment.
Go nymph to your cloud !
Now, are you withheld ! That last is fit!
Sterility is well placed on the cold height.
I, who will have pleasure of you and the brave increase
of joy.
Would dream a little of our consummation.
How delicately made are you ! How proud am I,
Who hold the living nucleus to induce new symmetry.
Times there are when simulated scorn
Grows real in me?
When I recall your dalliance,
How you are lessened and besmeared :
Then my hate is hard and bright as crystal.
Are you fit to be desired ?
Shall I leave you where I have driven you.
Till you issue out an ugly harridan
Decked with the rags and scraps of dead men?s dreams ?
No ! I have lusted with a sanctifying flame.
You are my tower ! I set my flag on you !
Make ready for the Guest;
Send down your serving-men to sweep the floor I
The Dilemma
Tf he roam far away
From the herd?s track.
He may run mad one day
And not come back.


If he feed where he stands.
He will find nothing strange nor sweet:
He must die in home lands
Because he cannot eat.
Conscience
(Written for Fjtton Armstrong)
T dreamed my heart was a grave
-*? In which were dead embalmed princesses.
In jewelled stomachers and dresses.
Flaunting their never-rotting tresses
For the skull smile of the brave.
I dreamed Dionysius spoke :
A free beast howled from the Christians? heaven ;
All ugly cerements were riven ;
And breath, and blood, and breasts were given ;
And the kings and the girls awoke.
Da Capo
TXT'oo me with ordures ;
* * Calm me with castigations ;
Have my lips wet
With the plague?s sweat:
Raise me to all prostrations !


Clamp me with pain so close around
That I lose sense and sight and sound :
Induce in me old ecstasy
Of infinite frustrations !
To Compassion
TT'ashion me a garment of repentance
Lovely as the colour of my sin ;
For the livery of God is beauty.
Though Hell carouse therein.
Hide me from my fault within your blindness :
Let your silence comfort me to tears ;
For the tongue of God was ever Loving-Kindness?
And Grace, his eyes and ears.
Prayer to Love
(Written for D.H.L.)
ive me the moment of self-forgetfulness
ln which the perfect thing is bred ;
Fill this small cup of time with an infinity :
Give me quick union with the dead.
Not till that moment shall I be transfigured to beauty.
Now I come out to you by paths well-trod :
You are the wall at my road?s end ;
Open your gates, and let me through to God.
