CHAPTER 1. 14 k'4y $45
HANS knew all about gardens.
His father had been a gardener too, but the garden he had cared
for had been the tulip garden of the Burgemeester of a famous
city in Holland, far away across the sea.
Although he had been only a very small boy when he had left this Dutch
city, Hans remembered that glorious garden. He could still see the blaze of
colour in tuliptime, hear the flapping of the wings of the windmill in the
distance.
He could remember the Burgemeester well ... the Burgemeester with
his great black beard and his booming voice. But his voice had been soft
when he spoke to Hans, for the old Burgemeester loved children almost as
much as he loved flowers.
In the garden where Hans worked now, there were no tulips; there was
no bearded Burgemeester to stride along the paths beside the flowerbeds; and
wnrcT nt oil m j. _
worst of all, there was no Father to
hold his hand and smile at him and tell
him all about the flowers and the best
way to care for them.

Burgemeester; but the rich man who
owned it did not love flowers any more
than he loved children. When he
strode along the paths beside the flower
beds, he did not stop to look at the
flowers or to talk to Hans, as the
Burgemeester would have done. He
marched along with his head in the air,
his fat hands clasped together around
his fat body, looking very rich and im-
portant and pleased with himself, but
not at all interested in anything or
anybody BUT himself; and certainly
not at all interested in the flowers that
grew in his garden or the boy who
looked after them.
Hans didn?t feel that anyone in
this country really loved flowers. And
certainly no one loved HIM.
There were three gardeners and two gardener?s boys beside himself. But
none of them was friendly to him. The Head Gardener was always scolding
him; the other two gardeners laughed at him and called him Stupid and
?Scatterbrain?; while the two boys, with whom he shared the little bedroom
up above the stable, teased him and bullied him so much that sometimes he
felt miserable enough to cry.
But Hans was much too big to cry. So he just bit his lip and clenched his
hands and said nothing; and then they would stop scolding him and laughing
at him and teasing him, and he could go back to his work in the gaiden.
He was always happy when he had his hands deep in the brown earth
and when he was helping the flowers to grow and to show their beauty to the
world.
He loved the smell of the earth, and the scent of the flowers, and the
strange small noises made by the
insects of the garden. It seemed to
him that every insect made a different
noise, sometimes loud, sometimes so
low that he had to strain his ears under
his mop of yellow hair to hear just
what it was.
He often wished he could under-
stand insect language .. . understand
what they were saying as they flew or
crawled or crept or wriggled in the
garden.
Wishing hard enough very often
makes a thing come true. Anyhow,
that?s how it was with Hans.


It was one very sunshiny day it happened first . . . one bright shiny day
that made the garden glow as brightly as the garden of the Burgemeester at
tuliptime.
CHAPTER 2.
Hans had just finished weeding a bed of anemones. Red and mauve,
pink and purple. They reminded him of the tulips in the Burgemeester?s
garden?although of course they weren?t nearly so beautiful. And, being
reminded of that time before he and his father had come across the seas . . .
that time long ago when his dear father was as well and strong as he was
happy and wise, Hans began to feel very sad indeed.
He was kneeling there on the grass feeling lost and alone, when he felt
something stroking his face . . . something that seemed like a soft finger.
A voice that was as soft as the touch spoke to him:
?Poor old Hans. Poor little old Hans.?
As, wondering and amazed, he put his hand up to his face, a gorgeous
blue and gold butterfly flew down and settled on his earth-stained hand.
Hans thought he had never seen anything so beautiful. It was a dream
butterfly. But, he thought, perhaps lAM dreaming. I must be dreaming.
Butterflies don?t talk. Not really.
But this butterfly did.
?Don?t look so surprised,? laughed the Butterfly. ?I am your friend. We
are all your friends in this garden. All the insects and all the flowers. You
love us . . . and so we love you. And we want you so badly to smile and be
happy.?
?It?s . . . it?s difficult to be happy,? said Hans at last, when he had got
over his surprise enough to be able to talk. ?It?s awfully difficult when you?re
away from home and have no one to speak to, or to smile at you, or to hold
your hand.?
?I?m holding your hand now,? said
the Butterfly. ?It?s a pity my hands
are so little that you can scarcely see
them. Still, they?re there. And I?m
smiling at you, in my butterfly way.
And I?m speaking to you. We?ve made
up our minds that we?re all going to
speak to you whenever we see you.?
?You CAN all talk then??
?Of course we can. To anyone
worth while, that is. And you?re worth
while. We wouldn?t be bothered talking
to those other horrid gardener?s boys.
Sam and Bob you call them, don?t you?
Awful boys! Sam, would you believe

it, once put a pin through my Great-
uncle Yellowstripe. That was a long
time ago, when I was only a tiny-wing.
But we don?t forget these things.?
?Your Great Uncle Yellowstripe!?
repeated Hans. ?Why, do you have
names??
The Butterfly?s voice sounded a bit
offended.
?Of COURSE we have names,? she
said. ?My name is Goldenwing. Just
as yours is Hans.?
?Yes, of course. It?s a lovely name too.? He was frightened that he
might have offended Goldenwing. But she smiled at him in her butterfly way,
and went on:
?We?ve all got lovely names,? she told him. ?Or anyhow, names that suit
us. You couldn?t think of a better name than Mr. Cree P. Crawley for a
caterpillar, now, could you??
Hans clapped his hands delightedly.
?Creepycrawly? That?s good.?
But clapping his hands had clapped the butterfly off them. She flew
round in the air, flapping her wings at him.
?MR. Crawley to you,? she said. ?Just as it would be bad manners for
you to call Mr. Busy Bertram.?
?Mr. Busy Bertram??
?No, of course not. Mr. Bertram Busy. Surely you?ve heard the saying,
?as busy as a Bertram?.?
?I?ve heard ?as busy as a bee?,? said
Hans.
?Well, that?s what I said. Bertram
Busy is a Bee. And a very handsome
Bee at that.?
?At what?? asked Hans.
?At buzzing. Just as I?m good at
flitting from flower to flower. Which
reminds me, I must do a spot of flitting
now. And you?d better get back to
YOUR work. Can?t you see, that pink
anemone. . . . Clara it is. . . . Clara
wants to talk to you.?


CHAPTER 3.
Hans looked after Goldenwing. He felt happier than he had felt for years
and years. This was something really thrilling ... the most exciting thing
that had ever happened. In the sunlight Goldenwing?s blue and gold wings
glowed like precious stones. For a little while he sat there, looking after
her, and then he couldn?t see her any more.
He began going over in his mind the interesting talk they had had to-
gether.
What was that last thing she?d said? Something about Clara? Some-
thing about an anemone?
He felt a tweak at his ankle.
He looked down.
One of the anemones had leant down right out of the bed and was biting
his ankle!
That was silly! Flowers didn?t bite. But why shouldn?t they? He had
thought just a little while ago that butterflies didn?t talk!
Hans leant down and lifted the slender green stalk in his fingers.
The flower?s face was lovely. Two colours of pink, a pale one and deep
one; and the most beautiful fine black collar. But although she was so lovely,
Hans thought he could see a frown on her face.
?Whatever?s the matter?? he asked.
Clara Anemone?s voice, when she answered him, sounded squeaky with
temper.
?It?s Shortoo,? she squeaked. ?That awful Shortoo.?
?Who on earth is Shortoo?? asked Hans.
?Huh! Call yourself a gardener and you don?t know THAT!? And she
began singing in a very funny high voice:
?Everywhere the winds do blow,
Everywhere the flowers go,
If you do not use your hoe,
Weeds are simply Shortoo grow.?
Hans burst out laughing.
?You mean ?SURE TO?,? he said.
?SHORTOO and SURE TO.
What?s the difference!? squeaked
Clara. ?Anyhow, remove Shortoo, or
I won?t be answerable for the conse-
quences. He?s simply strangling me.
Strangling me, that?s all!?
Hans looked down, and saw that a
weed actually was growing round
Clara Anemone?s stem. He dug his
fingers down into the earth, and began
to pull it out.


?Gently, gently,? squeaked Clara. ?Why, it?s as bad as going to the
dentist?s.?
?What do YOU know about going to the dentist?s?? asked Hans.
?You?d be surprised the things you hear when you?re in a seed packet,?
Clara told him. ?Now, young man, be careful of my roots. Gently does it.
Ahhhhh!? She breathed a sigh of relief as Hans finally got the weed out and
threw it on top of the other weeds in his wheelbarrow. ?There. That finishes
Shortoo.?
?I was just wondering,? said Hans, ?what the weeds feel about it.?
?What the Shortoo family feel,? Clara squeaked sniffily, ?doesn?t matter
one tiny scrap. The Shortoos! Huh! You just can?t keep them down! Talk
about rabbits and the families they have! But they?re nothing . . . nothing
at all . . . compared with the Shortoo family. Anyway, I suppose I?d better
say thank you. I certainly feel much more comfortable now.?
?I?m glad about that,? said Hans. ?Any time I can be of any help to
you, just call me.?
?Or nip you,? said Clara, with a giggle. ?You should have seen you face
when I nipped you! That?s a thing to tell the buds about.?
?Well, I?ve never been nipped by an anemone before,? Hans confessed.
?You won?t be again if you do your
weeding properly. Anyway, look at
Mrs. Sun. It?s dinner time, by the look
of her.?
Hans looked up, and, sure enough,
Mrs. Sun was high in the sky. It had
been such an exciting morning that
he?d never once thought about food.
?Thanks, Miss Anemone,? he
said.
?Clara to you,? she answered
graciously.
Hans got to his feet.
? ?Bye, Clara,? he waved his hand
to her and began to trundle his wheel-
barrow along the path, feeling suddenly
very hungry indeed and glad that there
was a plate of dinner waiting for him
at the kitchen door.


stable as Hans opened his eyes.
He had been having the oddest
dream, all about legs. Dozens and
dozens of legs, hundreds of legs. Legs

CHAPTER 4.
The early morning sun was sending
its first fingers of light through the
window of the little room above the
mean?
?Gooddd Dmorning,? said a funny
fat voice. Voices CAN be fat, just as
much as people. ?Gooddd Dmorning.?
Hans sat up and rubbed his eyes. Was it Sam or Bob playing another of
their tricks? But it wasn?t Sam or Bob he was looking at. It was a large,
fat, blue-nosed caterpillar, who was sitting curled up on his pillow.
?Fm sorry,? said the caterpillar fatly. ?I?m sorry that I haven?t brought
a visiting card. But it was a pretty long way up here. Too long to bring any
luggage.?
Luggage? repeated Hans. ?You wouldn?t really call a visiting card
luggage, would you??
?I would,? said the caterpillar. ?Most certainly I would. Still, it?s no good
arguing oyer that. The thing we?ve got to argue over is how I can introduce
myself without a visiting card.?
.. Hans thought for a moment, and then suddenly his talk with Goldenwing
the Butterfly came back to him.
?I know,? he cried, ?I know. You?re Creep ... Mr. Crawley. Cree P.
Crawley.?
The caterpillar wriggled delightedly on the pillow.
?Got it in one,? he said. ?You?re nearly as clever as your hair?s yellow.?
?Thank you,? said Hans. He didn?t know quite whether the caterpillar
was meaning to be nice or nasty, but he thought he?d better pretend it was
nice, at any rate.
?It?s very kind of you to call, Mr. Crawley.?
?Glad to crawl on you at any time,? the caterpillar told him. ?Funny!

. ? MYfe^: Cree fr* Crawle y told him proudly. ?I should think you would
dream about them. Not everyone has the honour of having Cree P.?s feet
ciawlmg over him in the dead of the morning.?
?The dead of night, you mean??
u 1 The caterpillar?s voice sounded fatter than ever. ?However,
we haven t got time to be arguing about that. I?ve got a long journey in front


of me. Quite a long journey. And it wouldn?t do for me to be here when
that Sam and Bob wake up. They?d try to put me into a box, or squish and
squash me. And, if they heard you talking to me, they?d think you re madder
than they do now.?
?I suppose they would,? Hans agreed. ?Still, I?d rather be me. Ive had
a lovely time talking to you . . . and to Goldenwing. Not to mention Clara
Anemone.?
?Oh, I forgot,? said Mr. Crawley. ?Just as well you mentioned HER
name. Clara said to tell you that the Shortoo family are keeping in their
place, and that she?s got a new bud.?
?I?m so glad.?
?And now,? the caterpillar stretched and wriggled himself round on the
pillow. ?And now I must be off. Glad to have met you, Hans. Very glad.
Return the call soon. I can?t say ?return the CRAWL?, because you can?t, can
you??
?I?m afraid I can?t.? Hans shook his head.
?Never mind,? said Mr. Cree P. Crawley kindly. ?We can?t all expect to
do the right thing, can we? So long. So long. See you soon.?
And he wriggled himself along the bed, over the table, and out the win-
dow, just as Bob stretched himself with a yawn, and yelled out:
?Hey there, Hans, you lazy loafer, get up, get up, get up!?
CHAPTER 5.
?What are you made of?sugar??
bellowed Mr. Snodgrass, the head
gardener.
No, sir. But it really is a bit
slushy, sir,? apologised Hans.
It certainly was ?a bit slushy.?
The rain was pouring down cats and
dogs, pelting so hard on the flowers that
it made them bow their heads to the
earth. Most of them, that is. Not the
tigerlilies. They stood straight up on
their strong stems, looking as if they
were much too high and mighty to take
notice of even a heavy shower of rain.
But Mr. Snodgrass wasn?t bother-
ing about the tigerlilies. He was
glaring at Hans, and shouting harder
than ever.
?Not a scrap of sense you?ve got.
Not a scrap. A bit of rain and you?ll
melt! Well, if you?re scared of a drop
of rain, what?s the matter with the


potting shed? There?s work to do in there. GET BUSY!?
?Yes, sir.?
Hans scuttled away into the potting shed and started to work putting
dried seeds into packets and naming them as he had been taught to do.
It wasn?t much fun in here. Nothing like as much fun as it was in the
garden, where Goldenwing the Butterfly might come flying down to sit on his
shoulder or whisper in his ear, or Mr. Cree P. Crawley might come wriggling
and slithering along on all his legs to tell him some of the gossip of the gar-
den. But here in the potting shed there was no one to talk to. No one at
all.
What about ME?? The voice that came to answer his thoughts was a
harsh, queer sort of voice. It seemed to come from somewhere up high but
Hans couldn?t make out from where it did come.
Then the strange harsh voice came again in a queer jangly song*
?Hi, Hi, Hi,
Can?t you spy
Septimus Spider?
Fie, fie, fie.
Please supply
A nice fat fly,
Or if you can?t just
Say Good-bye.?
he sang^ S lo � ked Up to where the long-legged spider sat, spinning his web as
?I don?t WANT to say Good-bye,
Mr. Spider,? he said. ?I haven?t even
said ?Hallo? yet.?
?Here,? the Spider told him
severely, ?we don?t say Hallo. If you
had any manners at all you?d say ?How
do you do, Mr. Septimus Spider,? and
bow three times.?
o . ? How . do you do, Mr. Septimus
Spider,? said Hans, and he bowed three
times, very low. It had to be very low,
because it hid the fact that he was
smiling. It would never do for Mr.
Spider to see him smile.
?Yes yes, that?s right,? said the
Spider. You learn easily, I?ll say that
for you. And of course, when you come
from over the sea, you can?t be ex-
pected to know everything. Denmark
you came from, I?m told.?
?I?m sorry, Mr. Septimus Spider,


but you were told wrong. I come from
Holland.?
?Same thing, same thing,? growled
the Spider. ?And, if you want an
argument, I should say that wrong
should be wrongly. Or is wrong
right??
?I don?t think wrong could ever he
right.?
?Oh, don?t you? Oh, indeed? Don?t
you think it?s wrong for you to be right
away from the place you were born??
?Yes, I do. Oh, I do. I just long
to get back to the Burgemeester?s
garden. But that?ll never happen.?
Hans was horrified to see a big tear
drip from his eye into a seed packet. He hoped it wouldn?t make the seed
grow too quickly. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand.
?Tch, tch, tch,? the Spider?s voice sounded most sympathetic now. ?Bad
as that, is it? Funny thing, you know. When flies cry, it doesn?t mean a
thing to me. But with you, now, it?s different. Tch, tch. The whole thing?s
as tangled as my web. But I?ll get it straightened out. I?ll get it straightened
out.?
?I?m sorry your web?s tangled,? said Hans politely.
?It?s YOUR tangle I?m thinking about, not mine,? the Spider told him.
?But I?ll fix it. I?m as great a fixer as lam a webber, and that?s saying some-
thing.?
?A webber?? repeated Hans in a puzzled voice.
?Certainly. Champion webber of Spidersville. I don?t want to boast,
but I can make a web twice as fast and twice as strong as any other spider
here, there or anywhere else. And I can fix up your troubles if you?ll only give
me time.?
?I?m afraid ...? began Hans. But at that moment Mr. Snodgrass the
Head Gardener came into the potting shed. So for that time at least Hans had
to stop talking to the Spider. But, all the time Mr. Snodgrass was shouting
at him, Hans could hear, very faintly, the song of Mr. Septimus Spider:
?Please supply
A nice fat fly,
Or, if you can?t, just
Say Good-bye.?


CHAPTER 6.
?Of course,? remarked a very
proud and haughty voice. ?Of course
you wouldn?t expect anything else
from those common flowers, would
you??
?Anything else but what?? asked
Hans with interest.
?Don?t you think,? the proud voice
came from the bell of an orange tiger-
lily speckled with brown spots, ?it
might be more polite to call me by name
when you speak to me??
?That?s an idea,? said Hans, ?if I
knew your name.?
?Daffodil-haired Hans,? the Tigerlily said importantly, ?allow me to pre-
sent Sir Titiano, the proudest branch of the tigerlily family.?
A chorus of protest came from a clump of yellow tigerlilies and another
group of magnificent blooms which were pink with black spots.
?Just listen to him!?
?I like that!?
?Who does Titiano think he is, anyway??
?Everyone knows that the orange
tigerlily is the commonest of the lot of
us.?
Sir Titiano Tigerlily went on as if
they had not interrupted.
?I speak,? he said, ?for the whole
Tigerlily family ... the Titianos, of
course, being the main branch, and I
wish to draw your attention to what
happened in the rain.?
?What DID happen in the rain??
asked Hans. While he was enjoying
this talk with the titled Tigerlily, he
didn?t stop working. He was busy
dragging quite a number of the Shortoo
family out of the bed where the pink
and yellow and orange lilies grew.
?You noticed it. Even your
daffodil-head took it in. I could sense


you taking it in. We Titianos have a
great sense of sense.?
?What?s a sense of sense? It?s not
sense to me. And I wish you wouldn?t
call me daffodil-head. I don?t like it.?
?A sense of sense is knowing what
lesser people are thinking. All flowers
have it, but we most of all. And your
hair IS the colour of a daffodil. And of
COURSE you took it in.?
?Took what in?? Hans looked
almost in a daze. Certainly this orange
creature on its high green stem was
jolly difficult to understand.
?Took in the fact,? Sir Titiano
informed him loftily, ?that the flowers
in the garden hid their faces when the
rain came. All but Titiano and histribe.?
?Yes, I DID notice that,? Hans admitted.. ?But why is it so important??
?Because it proves my contention.?
?What?s a contention??
?You do ask a lot of questions, don?t you, daffodil-head? A contention,
of course, is a point put forward in argument.?
?But I?m not arguing,? said Hans. ?I?m only listening. And I?m most
interested to hear what your contention is.?
?My contention is,? Sir Titiano announced, ?that the Tigerlily is the
champion of the floral world, whatever those Orchids and Gardenias say.?
?But what do the ...? Hans was beginning, when Sir Titiano inter-
rupted.
?Question time is over,? he said importantly. ?And the Shortoo family
are gone. For the moment. For the moment.? (Hans had certainly re-
moved a large number of weeds, in spite of its being question time). ?And,?
continued Sir Titiano, ?here is your Very Greatest Friend.?
Sure enough, down through the air came flying Goldenwing, her blue and
gold wings glowing in the soft sunlight.
As Hans moved away down the garden path, Goldenwing, perched on his
shoulder, whispered in his ear:
?Keep away from old Titiano. He?s the greatest bore in the garden.?
?But he IS very handsome,? said Hans.
?Yes. But one of these days, when he starts to shrivel, he?ll realise that
he?s talked himself off his stem.?
?CAN they do that??
?I?ll say they can,? said Goldenwing, ?but don?t bother about him any more.
I?ve promised to take you along to see Clara Anemone?s new bud.?

CHAPTER 7.
When they arrived at Clara
Anemone?s bed, they found she had
another visitor. And it was a visitor
she didn?t seem to like very much. She
was squeaking at him in fury.
?Get away from my baby!? she
shrieked. ?Don?t buzz around my
baby-bud. You know it?s against the
rules.?
?Dear, dear,? said Goldenwing.
?That?s Bertram again. He really IS
a nuisance.?
?Bertram??
?Yes, you know, Bertram Busy.
Wait a minute. I?ll take his mind off. Bertram,? she called, in that soft voice
of hers, that yet somehow seemed to sound for a long way. ?Bertram, there?s
a gentleman here who wants to meet you.?
A big brown Bee with yellow stripes on its fat body buzzed along and
started circling round Hans? nose as though it imagined that Hans was one of
Clara Anemone?s buds.
?ZZZZ!? he said. ?ZZZ to you, Goldenwing. ZZZ a very pleasant day,
don?t you feel??
?You haven?t met Hans yet, have you?? said Goldenwing. ?Hans, this is
Mr. Bertram Busy.?
?How do you do,? said Hans politely.
?ZZZ to you, HanZZ,? said Mr.
Busy, just as politely. ?ZZZ a pleasure
to meet a boy who?s like my name.?
?Like your name?? Really these
creatures of the garden made the most
puzzling remarks.
?ZZZertainly. Every time I?ve seen
you you?ve been working. Talking too.
But working. And every time I?ve
thought: Good boy, that boy. Why,
he?s almost as BuZZZZy as a Bertram.?
?But I don?t buzz,? protested Hans.
?He means ?busy?,? whispered
Goldenwing, ?Bees? S?s are always
Z?s.?
?Ohhh,? said Hans.
?Don?t ZZay Ohhh. ZZay hoe,?


Bertram told him. ?ZZZZ a good thing you can use a hoe, even if you can?t
ZZay it properly. Can you ZZZing as ZZZwell??
?I?m afraid I can?t sing,? Hans shook his head. ?But I love listening to
songs. Clara Anemone sang me a beautiful song.?
?ZZZ a pity you have to mention that Anemone creature,? Bertram Busy
buzzed in an annoyed sort of way. ?That Clara doeZZn?t appreciate me when
Hans hurried to change the subject.
?I liked Septimus Spider?s song, too.?
But this was even worse. The Bee?s buzzes became positively terrifying.
?ZZZeptimus ZZZZZpider, iZZ it? That pirate, that . . . that. . . .
Goldenwing whispered in Hans? ear again.
?Septimus is always trying to catch Bertram in his web. They?re very
old enemies.?
?Ohhh,? said Hans; and then, catching Mr. Busy?s sharp black eyes glar-
ing at him, he altered it to: ?I mean, Hoe.?
?That?s better.? Mr. Busy actually smiled. And Hans hastened to ask
him politely:
?I wonder, Mr. Busy, if YOU would favour us with a song??
?ZZZZZZactIy what I was thinking of doing,? said the Bee. ?Wait a
minute and I?ll think of the very beZZt one I know.?
He put his brown head on one side
and closed his eyes as if he was think-
ing very hard, and at last he began to
sing in a very buzzy voice indeed:


*
?I huzzzz round a flower
In zzunzhine and zzhower.
I get from it pollen and honey,

BERTRAM BUSY.?
He finished off the verse with another
set of buzzes, and seemed to be starting
off on another one ... but Goldenwing?s
soft voice came in just in time:
?Thanks for singing to us, Bertram.
It was a lovely song. But we?d better not keep you from your buzzing any
longer. Come on, Hans. Thanks again.?
And off went Hans and Goldenwing, followed on their way by the squeaky
voice of Clara Anemone, complaining:
?He didn?t even LOOK at my new bud.?
CHAPTER 8.
?The impertinence of it! The utter impertinence of it! Oh! Oh! Oh!?
Hans put down his spade and listened.
Yes. It was Cree?s voice. But not a scrap like Cree P. Crawley?s usual
fat cheerful voice. Something pretty awful must have happened to him.
Hans hurried in the direction of the voice, and found Mr. Crawley puffing
and blowing, and dabbing his blue nose with a Will-o?-the-wisp.
?Why, what on earth?s happened to you, Cree??
?Sniff. Sniff. What?s happened to HIM, you?d better ask.?
?Who?s him??
?I wish you?d speak better grammar,? put in Septimus Spider, who, as
it was such a lovely day, was taking a few hours in the sunshine, and spinning
a web from tree to tree. ?Who?s him, indeed! Anyway, it wasn?t a him, it
was a her.?
?What Him was a Her?? asked Hans in a puzzled voice.
?The Her who had a fight with poor old Cree P. If you could call it a

fight. That silly little Lizzie Redbreast,
to be exact. If you must be exact.?
?I don?t think YOU?RE being very
exact, Mr. Spider, calling a Redbreast
Lizzie. In all the books I?ve ever read
Redbreasts are called Robin.?
?Sniff,? came from Cree P. ?This
Redbreast? . . . Sniff . . . Sniff . . .
?IS called Lizzie. Now I come to think
of it . . .1 called Her a Him because
she?s so like her Uncle Robin. Lizzie!
But there are other names I?d like to
call her!?
?Tch, tch, tch,? Mr. Spider came
down from where he was webbing to
put a long hand on Cree P.?s arm.
?Tch, tch. There, there. No rude lan-
guage here, I beg of you. Though she
doesn?t deserve to have anything nice
said about her.?
?I do so. Ido so.? The sad little
voice that came in then made Hans
look toward a bush nearby. Leaning
against it was a little bird, looking the
saddest thing you?ve ever seen in your
life. She was rubbing her crimson
breast with one leg, and opening and
shutting her beak as if she couldn?t get
her breath.
?I do so,? she panted. And then:
?I was only doing my worm-eating
exercises. How was I to know that that
thing with the blue nose wasn?t one of
the Wriggley Willy family.?
?Sniff. Sniff. The impertinence of
it,? cried Mr. Crawley again. ?Any
bird that doesn?t know the difference
between a Wriggley and a Crawley . . .
well!!!!?
?I do now,? said the Redbreast
sadly. ?I didn?t realise I was such a


{ K.ssi&
little bird, or that Mr. Crawley was
such a very long worm ... I mean
caterpillar ... or such a very strong
wo . . . caterpillar. Or that he was
likely to squeeze me nearly to bits.
When Uncle Rob taught me my worm-
eating exercises he didn?t say anything
about THAT. So how was Ito know??
?Well, you know now.? Mr.
Crawley had finished sniffing, and had
tucked his Will-o?-the-wisp tidily into
a Blue-bell. ?No, if you?ll say you?re
sorry and look out for blue noses and
perfect figures in future everything
will be 0.K.?
?I?m sorry,? said Lizzie.
?And I?d be sorry, too,? said Hans,
?if Mr. Snodgrass caught me stopping my digging to talk to you. ?Bye, Cree.
?Bye, Mr. Spider. Glad to have met you, Lizzie.?
And in a few minutes Hans? spade was once again turning over the brown
earth, being careful to cover what Wriggleys made their appearance from the
sharp eyes and sharp beak of little Lizzie Redbreast.
CHAPTER 9.
Life nowadays was pleasant for Hans. He had made so many friends in
the garden that he almost forgot his life in the Dutch town and the Burge-
meester and the tulips.
There was always someone new to talk to, but his greatest friend was
still Goldenwing the Butterfly, who was always introducing him to new insects
and flowers and birds, and making his life happy.
But it?s funny how a wish that you keep in the back of your mind comes
to the surface again.
Anyway, that?s how it was with Hans.
It was one day Mrs. Sun hadn?t shone at all, and that old North Wind had
been making a frightful nuisance of himself all over the garden, and every-
body was bad tempered. Not only the insects and the birds and the flowers,
but Mr. Snodgrass, the Head Gardener, and the two under gardeners, and
Sam and Bob, the gardener?s boys. They had all bullied and teased and
laughed at Hans till he felt most awfully unhappy and miserable.
But Hans kept his chin up and dug his hands in the ground and fought
very hard to get the happy feeling back.
He was working, in the late afternoon, in a little bed hidden by a big tree,
when from behind the tree there came the sound of voices: Mr. Snodgrass
the Head Gardener?s voice, and another very important-sounding voice that
Hans didn?t for a minute recognise. And then he realised that it was the


voice of Mr. Gold, the gentleman who
owned the garden, and who, Hans had
always thought, wasn?t a scrap in-
terested in his garden or in the flowers
that grew in it.
He was amazed to hear Mr. Gold
say to Mr. Snodgrass:
?Yes, over there will be the place
for them. A tremendous bed of tulips.
Just a blaze of colour. I can picture it.
Yes. It will be the finest display of
tulips in the country.?
Mr. Snodgrass seemed to have got
over his bad temper, for his voice
sounded quite excited:
?It will be a pleasure to grow them,
Sir. Yes, indeed.?
Hans could almost see him rubbing
his hands together in a way he had
when he was pleased about something
?which wasn?t often.
?I am quite prepared,? said Mr.
Gold, ?quite prepared to take the trip
to Holland and procure the best bulbs
that can be bought. Price is no object.
I want the best bulbs in the world.?
?Yes, indeed,? said Mr. Snodgrass
again.
?The point is,? Mr. Gold?s voice
sounded a bit doubtful; ?the point is,
where can the best bulbs in the world
be bought.?
Hans never knew exactly what
happened to him.
But, before you could say will-o?-
the wisp, he had run round to the
other side of the tree, and was telling
Mr. Gold all about the city in Holland
where he was born, and about the
Burgemeester, who had the VERY best
bulbs in the world, and about the sort
of bulbs to choose . . . the ones that
would grow the most easily in this
country.
At the beginning, Mr. Snodgrass
looked as though he would bite Hans?
Head off, but, as he saw how interested


Mr. Gold was looking, he stood there
saying nothing, and smiling as if he,
not Hans, was giving all this informa-
tion to the Gentleman who Owned the
Garden.
?Very interesting,? said Mr. Gold
at last. ?Very interesting indeed. This
boy has sense. I shall be going next
week, and before I go I shall certainly
see you again, my boy, and make notes
of all you have said. Here?s a nice
bright shilling for you.?
?Thank you, Sir,? said Hans.
And Mr. Gold went off, muttering
to himself:
?Very interesting. Very interest-
ing indeed.?
CHAPTER 10.
Hans was lying awake in the
middle of the night.
And he was crying.
He hadn?t been to sleep at all . . . not for one minute.
Goldenwing the Butterfly, who always seemed to know when anything
was wrong with him, had flown through the window and brushed her soft wings
against his eyes and over his head, because he had such an awful headache.
And then at last she had gone, and had sent Mr. Cree P. Crawley to keep
him company.
Cree P. was curled up on the pillow, his blue face all crinkled in sym-
pathy, and his voice extra fat and friendly.
?But, why, Hans . . . why, suddenly, when you?d forgotten to be home-
sick, and were so happy with us??
?Oh, Cree, you don?t understand. I hadn?t forgotten to be homesick. I?d
just pushed homesickness into the back of my mind. And then, talking to Mr.
Gold, it all came back again, worse than ever.?
?But
?It isn?t fair, Cree, it isn?t fair.?
?What isn?t fair?? asked Mr. Crawley.
?That Mr. Gold should have all that money, and I should have only a nice
bright shilling, and seven and sixpence that I?ve saved. Mr. Gold has hun-
dreds and hundreds of pounds.?
?What would YOU do with hundreds and hundreds of pounds?? asked
Cree P. ?Money always seems a very silly thing to me.?
?It isn?t silly when you could do something with it . . . something that?s


more important than anything else in
the world.?
?And what IS so important? To me
important things are green leaves and
things to eat . . . but to you . . . what
IS important to you??
?I want to go back to Holland,? said
Hans.
Cree P. Crawley wriggled round
on the pillow, squirming in horror.
?And LEAVE US!I!?
?Well ...?
?It isn?t well,? roared Cree P., ?it?s very bad. Leave us, US . . . your
friends. Just go away and leave all of us by ourselves. The insects and the
birds and the flowers in Holland didn?t talk to you like we do. Not a bit of
it! But . . . YOU?D LEAVE US!!!?
The boy put out a hand and stroked Cree P.?s coils.
?Please understand, Cree,? he said. ?I don?t want to leave you for ever.
I love you all. But Ido want to see the Burgemeester again, and the tulips
and the windmill and the water, and the girls in their white caps and clogs and
the boys in their patched trousers. Oh, I do!?
?It all sounds pretty silly to me,? said Cree at last. ?But, if you want it,
you want it.?
?I?d come back, you know,? Hans assured him. ?Really I would. I want
to come back. Especially if there?s going to be a tulip garden here. It?ll be
just like Holland . . . only better, because you . . . all of my friends . . .
would be here too.?
?Well, that?s something,? said Cree P.
But just once,? said Hans, ?I want to see my home again. Just once.
And then I?d be happy. But I never shall. No. I ne. .ver s. .shall.?
The tears started to fall again.
Ciee P. sat on the pillow, watching him. There was nothing he could say
01 do. But he could think. There was nothing to stop his thinking about
poor Hans and his wish. He sat there, thinking and watching. And, after a
little while, Hans began to breathe softly. And Cree, looking down, saw that
he was at last asleep.
CHAPTER 11.
The Creatures of the Garden were having a meeting.
It was a very noisy meeting. They were shouting so loudly that nobody
could hear what anyone else was talking about.
At last Bertram Busy decided on a way to quieten things down a bit. He
buzzed around threatening to sting anybody who didn?t keep quiet.


V, a 1,
Most of them knew just what Bertram?s stings meant?and his furious
buzzes showed them that he meant business?so they settled down quietly in
their places once more.
Mr. Busy, perched up on a rose bush, took charge.
?LadieZZZZ and gentlemen,? he announced, ?we are met together here
to deZZZZZide what we can do to help our friend HanZZ to get hiZ wiZZh.
IZZ that agreed??
?Yes,? and ?Aye, aye, Sir,? they all cried.
?Very well then,? went on Mr. Busy. ?I ZZhall call on the first ZZugges-
tioner!?
?What?s a suggestioner?? asked Lizzie Redbreast.
?A ZZZZomebody who makes a ZZZZuggestion, of course,? said Bertram.
?Now, I call Mr. ZZZZZeptimus
ZZZZpider.?
Mr. Spider climbed up on his long
legs and perched beside Bertram Busy.
?I suggest,? he said in his harsh
voice, ?I suggest that we make a magic
carpet.?
?A magic carpet!? they all cried. _
?Yes. A magic carpet. I shall
spin it. Everyone knows I?m the best
spinner in Spidersville, and then Mr.


a|:^d*pL>.
Busy can strengthen it with honey, and
you can all put leaves and things into
it, and . . . ?
?But,? objected
Goldenwing,
?Hans is very, very big. I think it
would take us years and years and
years to make a carpet that would carry
him. And it?s no use waiting till he?s
grown up to give him his wish.?
?What does time matter?? asked
a Will-o?-the-wisp that had blown
along.
?Nothing to us,? agreed a Shortoo,
?but a lot to Hans.?
But nobody took any notice of him.
?I think,? announced Bertram
Busy, ?that Goldenwing is right for
onceZZZZZZ.?
?For once!?
Goldenwing?s soft
voice was quite indignant. But she
stopped fussing when she saw that Mr.

Cree P. Crawley had wriggled up to say a few words.
?I have thought all night long ,? he said fatly, ?and I have found a WAY!?
?What way?? they all asked. And they waited while Mr. Crawley puffed
himself up ready to make his announcement.
?We?ve got to make the Gentleman who Owns the Garden take Hans with
him,? he said.
?But how can we?? asked Clara Anemone squeakily.
?Yes,? Sir Titiano Tigerlily chimed in. ?Why should a great man like
Mr. Gold take a lad like Hans? Why, Mr. Gold is as proud as a Titiano.?
The other Tigerlilies started to object, but Bertram silenced them with an
angry buzz.
?ZZZZenough,? he said. ?Continue, Cree.?
And so Cree continued.
?The plot,? he said, ?will start to-morrow morning. I have all my family
sharpening their teeth ready for it.?
?I didn?t know you HAD teeth,? objected Septimus Spider.
But Bertram buzzed at him, and he stopped.
?I want you all to be ready,? Mr. Crawley said. ?After the Crees have
finished, there?s heaps to be done. Even the Shortoo family can help.?
?I don?t think ...? began Sir Titiano ?and then he looked at Bertram,
and stopped.
?You, Mr. Spider, will need to get ready to web quickly and strongly.?
Mr. Spider waved a leg airily.
?No trouble to me,? he said. ?I?m the best webber in Spidersville.?
?You, Bertram,? went on Cree P. Crawley, ?must be ready to sting with
a capital S.?
?BuZZZZZ to you,? said Bertram. ?Pm aIwayZZZZ happy to ZZZZting
any friend of yourZZZZZ.?
?What about me?? begged Clara Anemone.
?Your job, Clara, is to help Bertram.?
?Help Bertram? I like that! Bertram?s always buzzing round my buds!?
?You must forget all your quarrels to-morrow,? said Cree, ?and work to-
gether for Hans.?
?But,? interrupted Septimus Spider, ?what exactly IS the plot??
?That I cannot tell you at the moment,? said Cree. ?I?m sorry. But only
Goldenwing and I must know until the times comes. Now, you?ll all be
ready??
?We?ll all be ready,? chorused the Creatures of the Garden.
?Till to-morrow then,? said Cree.
And Septimus Spider agreed:
?Until to-morrow.?
?ZZZZZZ to you all,? said Bertram Busy. ?The meeting iZZ now over.
ZZZZZZZZ to you all.?

CHAPTER 12.
It was the morning after the
Meeting, and Mr. Gold, the Gentleman
who Owned the Garden, was striding
down the path on his way to the Office.
He marched along with his head in
the air, his fat hands clasped together
around his fat body, looking very rich
and important and pleased with him-
self.
And then, suddenly, he let out a
yell.
Bertram Busy was stinging the
back of his neck! While at the same
time Clara Anemone and her sisters
and brothers had leant down and were
nipping his ankles as hard as they
could go.
Mr. Gold was too busy rubbing his
stings and nips, and yelling, to notfce
that Mr. Cree P. Crawley, and dozens
and dozens of his uncles and aunts and
sisters and cousins were all chewing
away at his pocket. Chew. Chew.
Chew. They thought they?d never get
the job done in time. But at last they
did it!
The bottom of Mr. Gold?s pocket
was quite chewed away, and his big fat
wallet had fallen on to the ground.
Cree and the other blue-nosed
caterpillars, helped by Lizzie Redbreast
and some of her friends, were dragging
it to Clara Anemone?s bed and hiding
it under her leaves.
It was awfully difficult business.
But at last it was done.
Mr. Gold didn?t see them doing it
at all. For he was running up to the
house, calling out for something to put
on his stings and nips.
Goldenwing the Butterfly, who
had been flying around watching all
this, called out to Septimus Spider.


?Silverfish, that?s what?s done it! f
Silverfish!? he cried. I ' A v
His housekeeper wrung her hands X?U v
and said she was careful never to let a
?NOW, Septimus, hurry!? It was wonerful the way her soft little voice
carried all over the garden.
Septimus sat on top of the wallet, and started webbing for dear life.
Over and over it he spun his silken threads. Every now and then Lizzie
Redbreast poked a leaf in among the threads. Every now and then Bertram
Busy dropped some honey on it to make it stick stronger and tighter.
At last that job was finished.
And then the Shortoo family got to work. They grew and they grew
and they grew, all over the wallet that was now almost hidden by Spider
webs and leaves and honey. And soon you couldn?t see any sign of any wallet
at all.
Clara Anemone kept looking down to see that the Sh: v toos weren?t
strangling her, but they kept well away, and did the best wo. : any weeds
could possibly do.
When it was over, all the insects and flowers and birds were very tired,
and they all went to sleep, making Sir Titiano promise to wake them up when
anything exciting happened.
CHAPTER 13.
You?ve never heard such excitement as was going on up at the Big House.
Mr. Gold?s stings and nips were
feeling much better. But he?d dis-
covered that he?d lost his wallet, and
that there was a hole in the pocket.


silverfish or any other insect into the house.
?Ha Ha,? snorted Mr. Gold. ?No insects in the house??? Then what?s
that? What?s that??
THAT was Goldenwing, who had flown in the window to see what was
going on, so that she could report it to Cree and the others.
?It must be found,? cried Mr. Gold. ?My wallet must be found, that?s
all.?
And he i ang up the police, and he sat down and wrote out an advertise-
ment:
LOST.?A wallet containing hundreds
and hundreds of pounds and a
ticket to Holland. Finder please
return to Mr. Jonathan Gold at the
Big House. Generous Reward.
And then he got Mr. Snodgrass the Head Gardener in, and told him to
stop work and make everybody search until the wallet was found.
For three days they searched, Snodgrass and the two under gar-
deners, as well as Sam and Bob and H,ans, and the housekeeper and the others
who worked up at the Big House and z..
who worked up at the Big House and
the Police and Mr. Gold and everybody
else.
They searched and they searched
and they searched, and no trace of the
wallet could be found.
And Mr. Gold was at his wits? end.
It was on the fourth day that Cree
P. Crawley decided it was time to act.
And when Hans woke up in the
morning he found Cree P, Crawley
coiled up on his pillow.
?He had every reason to ask, for
Mrs. Sun had scarcely opened her eyes,
it was so early.


But Cree P. wasn?t bothering about that. The point was to fix things up
before anyone else was awake.
?Get dressed quickly,? he commanded, ?and come into the garden.?
So Hans got dressed quickly and went down into the garden, being careful
not to wake Bob or Sam, who were sleeping in their beds in the little room at
the top of the stable.
When he got down into the garden he found everybody very busy. Cree
and all his relations, and Mr. Spider, and Bertram and Lizzie Redbreast and
her friends, all digging and pulling and licking and tweaking . . . and at last
they got the wallet out from all its wrappings.
Hans could hardly believe his eyqs.
?There you are,? said Cree P. ?Now take that up to Mr. Gold, and when
he asks what reward you want you know what to say.?
?I DON?T know ...? stammered Hans.
?Never mind,? said Goldenwing softly. ?I?ll come with you. I?ll help you
to say the right things.?
And she perched herself on Hans? shoulder, and he walked up the path to-
ward the Big House, carrying the wallet in his hand.
CHAPTER 14.
Mr. Gold stood there in his dressing
gown beaming down at Hans.
?Well, well,? he said. ?Well, well.
This is a bit of luck. It certainly is.
Where did you find it, my boy??
For a moment Hans didn?t know
what to say. But Goldenwing whis-
pered in his ear, and he answered, most
respectfully:
?Please, Sir, I?ve been looking and
looking for days?and this morning
when I woke up I thought: I wonder if
it?s got buried somewhere. And I
looked again, all over the place. And
at last I found it in C1a.... In the
anemone bed.?
?How extraordinary!?
?There were Shorto. .. . There
were weeds growing all over it, Sir.
They grow so quickly this weather.?
?Hmmm! We might never have
found it. Never. Well, my boy, I?m
proud of you. And most grateful.
Now, ask any reward you want, and


I?ll give it to you. Generous reward, I
said in the advertisement, and you?ll
find Mr. Jonathan Gold a generous
man.?
?I?m sure I will,? mumbled Hans.
?Well. Ask. Ask.?
Hans hesitated. But Goldenwing
whispered again in his ear.
?Please, Sir. ... Oh, please,
Sir. . . . COULD you take me to
Holland with you??
?WHAT! Take you to Holland
with me? I?ve never heard of such a
thing. Never heard of such a thing.?
?Ohhh!?
Mr. Gold saw the sad, disappointed
expression on Hans? face.
?But why do you want to go to
Holland?? he asked.
?Please, Sir, it?s my home. I?ve been so homesick to see the Burge-
l|L meester?s garden again, and the windmill and the water, and the girls in
|i| their white caps and clogs, and the boyp in their patched trousers . . . and
the tulips . . . the tulips. ...?
Mr. Gold kept silent for a long lime, and then at last he said:
?It mightn?t be a bad idea. It mightn?t be a bad idea at all. You could
help with the luggage. And, when we get to Holland, you could talk the
language and help me to buy the tulips, couldn?t you??
?Yes, I could! I could!? said Hans.
?But you?re a good boy in the garden. I don?t want to lose you. Especi-
ally when I?m going to bring all those bulbs back with me.?
?Couldn?t I come back with you, too?? asked Hans. ?Couldn?t I come back
and look after the bulbs? I know how to grow tulips, Sir. I could make it
the most marvellous tulip bed in the whole country.?
?Not a bad idea,? said Mr. Gold. ?Not a bad idea at all. And when we
come back I?ll give you complete charge of the tulip beds, shall I ? No one
to interfere with you?not even Snodgrass??
?Ohhh!? said Hans again. But this time It was a very different sort of
?Ohhh!?


as he waved his hand to the garden v I A
and
CHAPTER 15.
And that?s how it happened.
Last Tuesday, Hans and Mr. Gold set off on their journey to Holland.
All the Creatures of the Garden were there to say Good-bye to Hans?but
of course Mr. Gold didn?t notice them.
Cree P. Crawley actually cried! You mightn?t believe it, but he did.
There they sat, in Mr. Gold?s big motor car that was to take them to the
ship. Hans had a new suit on, and looked very smart indeed?and oh so very,
very happy.
And, just before the car started on, Goldenwing the Butterfly flew
through the window and brushed her soft wings against Hans? face.
?Good-bye, Hans, darling,? she whispered. ?Have a lovely time. But
don?t forget US.?
Hans shook his head.
?And you will come back? Truly? You WILL come back??
?Of course I will,? whispered Hans,
as he waved his hand to the garden
and the creatures in it he had grown to
love so well.
