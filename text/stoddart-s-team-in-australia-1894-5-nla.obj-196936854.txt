STOODART’S TEAM
in AUS TRA LI A, 1894-5
THE PLAY.
NEVER, or hardly ever, have the doings of an
English Eleven in the Australian Colonies
aroused such keen and widespread interest in the
Old Country as that which marked the performances
of Mr. Stoddart’s team during the winter of 1894-95.
This, it must be admitted, was in a great measure owing
to the enterprise of the Pall Mall Gazette in so fully
reporting the details of the tour. Still, stay-at-home
cricketers would have eagerly seized upon even the most
meagre reports, so intense in itself was the public interest
in the combination collected by the brilliant Middlesex
Amateur. Moreover, interchanges of visits between
English and Australian representatives are not now quite
so frequent as they were a few years back —a fact which
tends to invest them with increased importance. And
how nobly the latest band of Englishmen acquitted
themselves is now a matter of history. Though a com-
parison of the results with those of previous tours shows
that still better records have been achieved in the past,
none the less Mr. Stoddart’s men have proved themselves
thoroughly capable of maintaining the prestige of English
cricket. Those historic “ ashes ”of which we have heard
but little since the days of the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s visit to
the Colonies, have loomed largely on the horizon once
more, but Stoddart & Co. have made it plain that, so far
at least, there can be no question as to their resting-place.
The complete record shows that the tour embraced
twenty-three matches, of which nine were won, four lost,
and the large proportion of ten drawn. These latter
though, were all matches against odds, of which there
were eleven—games “of no importance.” Setting these
aside, we have twelve contests on level terms, and of
these eight were won and four lost. And in the five of
this dozen that were between the full strength of England
and Australia, the visitors were successful thrice. So, hats
off to the sturdy tourists.
Leaving Albion’s shores on September 21st, on board
the Orient Liner Ophir , the team had a pleasant voyage
(broken by a call at Colombo, and a match there against
Thirteen residents), and in due time (on November 3rd)
made their first appearance on a Colonial ground, the
outcome being a draw with Eighteen of Gawler and
District. Then followed the first important game, at
Adelaide, against South Australia. The result was not of
good omen for our men. Despite a masterly innings of
115 by Brown, and the excellent batting of the Captain
(66), F. G. J. Ford (66), Brockwell (45), and Ward (41),
as well as other useful contributions towards a first total
of 476, South Australia in their turn —thanks mainly to a
score of 117 by Darling (who was facing English bowling
for the first time) and an item of 64 from George Giffen
—were enabled to respond with a sum of 383. When
the visitors went in a second time, they utterly failed
before the bowling of George Giffen, who (on a splendid
wicket) disposed of five batsmen for 49 runs, and in the
end were all out for 130. Needing 224 to win, South
Australia attained that sum for the loss of four wickets,
Reedman making 83, G. Giffen (not out) 58, Darling
(not out) 37, and Lyons 32.
This disaster was fully atoned for in the next encounter,
against Victoria, at Melbourne. Mr. Stoddart again
winning the toss, his side went to the wickets and stayed
there till a first total of 416 had been registered. Mr.
Maclaren was the hero with a magnificent 228, his skipper
lending useful aid with 77. Victoria then batted con-
sistently for 306, to which the highest contribution was
the 70 of J. Harry, who went in on the fall of the sixth
wicket. At their second attempt the Englishmen made
288 (Mr. Stoddart 78, and Peel 65), and Victoria,
succumbing in the final stage for 253, were defeated by
145 runs. Victory, too, followed the visitors in the
succeeding match, against New South Wales at Sydney.
The batsmen again had a look-in. In the first important
match 34 wickets produced 1215 runs, in the second 40
wickets realized 1263, and in the Sydney contest 32
wickets fell for 948. Mr. Stoddart having, for the first
time during the tour, lost the toss, the New South Welsh-
men went in first and made 293. Of these 133 came
from Iredale. Mr. Stoddart’s team, in reply, bettered
this performance by 101. For this they had chiefly to
thank Brown (117), Brockwell (81), and Mr. Stoddart
(79)—the trio between them subscribing as many as 277
of the English first total of 394. When New South
Wales went in again, Peel and Briggs were seen to great
advantage with the ball. Gregory was the only batsman
to do much, making 87 of the innings total of 180. The
visitors got the 80 needed to win for the loss of two
wickets.
After playing drawn games with Armidale (N.S.W.) and
Towoomba (Queensland), the tourists defeated Queens-
land at Brisbane by the very decisive margin of an innings
and 274 runs. The visiting Captain having again been
successful in the spin, his side went in and accumulated
the formidable total of 494. Mr. Stoddart (149) registered


his first century of the tour, made at the rate of more
than a run per minute. He and Ward, who made 107,
put on 249 while together. The next highest scorers were
Mr. Maclaren (74 not out) and Mr. Philipson (59). Then
Richardson (11 wickets in the match for 63) stuck up the
Queenslanders, who were twice dismissed for totals of
121 and 99, and lost as stated.
In the face of the English performances so far, the next
match—England v. Australia - naturally was welcomed
with intense interest. The game opened under the most
favourable conditions, and huge crowds flocked to the
Sydney ground. Australia won the toss, and took first
innings. At the outset there was nothing to fore-
shadow the big score to come (the largest ever made in
test matches, and the largest against an English eleven
in Australia), the third wicket falling at 21. But then
came the fine stand of George Giffen and Iredale, which
carried the total to 192, and later, when the bowling had
become worn out, the lively 201 of little Sid Gregory, and
the noteworthy 74 of Blackham. In view of the magni-
tude of the task set them, England’s achievement of 325
was a fine one, demonstrating the all-round strength of
the batting. But even better things were to come. Be-
ginning their second essay on the morning of the fourth
day, England were not dismissed till late the following
afternoon. Ward was in four hours for his 117, and gave
but one chance. The others again batted consistently,
with the outcome a total of 437. And then, on the fifth
evening, when Australia had got 113 for two wickets, and
their victory seemed assured, rain came to the rescue of
England. On the sixth day, Peel and Briggs had a
bowler’s wicket to perform on, and the side were out for
an addition of 53 runs. The aggregate for the match is
a world’s record in first-class cricket, by the bye.

After a brief interval, during which a drawn game was
brought off with the Sydney Juniors, the second test
match was entered upon, the venue being the Melbourne
Club enclosure. Rain overnight had saturated the turf,
and Gififen, who won the toss, decided to take the field.
The in-side made an inglorious display against the bowl-
ing of Turner and Trumble, but, in their turn, Australia
could do but little better. Though the pitch was an im-
proving one, Richardson bowled with great effect, and on
the close of an innings to each side Australia had a lead
of 48 runs. Now came one of those changes which are
the glory of the game. Mr. Stoddart and Ward opened
the batting, and when the former was out for 173, the
board showed 320 for the loss of five wickets. Peel
played a patient 53, and when the tenth wicket fell Aus-
tralia were left with 428 to win. Despite the plucky bat-
ting of Bruce, Iredale, and H. Trott, in the end England,
after having all the worst of the luck at the outset, claimed
a well-earned victory by 94 runs.

Richardson and Lockwood each bowled one
wide, and Lockwood
one no-ball.
The customary drawn game with a local eighteen (that
of Ballarat) preceded the third meeting of England and
Australia, this time at Adelaide. A check was in store
for the Old Country representatives, who had hitherto
been but once defeated. Australia proved their superiors
at every point on this occasion, and, thanks in particular
to the bowling of Callaway and A. Trott, and the batting
of the latter, Iredale (who scored his second century
against the Englishmen in splendid style), and Bruce, our
men succumbed by 382 runs. The bowling of Richardson
in Australia’s initial essay was the best feature of the
English cricket. That sterling player, “Bobby” Peel, had
the unenviable distinction of bagging a brace.

Having beaten Eighteen of Broken Hill, and drawn
with Eighteen of Dandenong, the fourth test match fol-
lowed. Mr. Stoddart won the toss for the first time in
the series, and sent Australia in to bat on a sticky wicket.
Six wickets were down for 51, when some faulty fielding
allowed Graham and Darling to put a different complexion
on the game. When, at 119, their partnership was broken,
Graham and A. Trott played lively cricket for an addition
of xi 2, at which figure Graham was stumped for a dash-
ing 105. Trott’s not out 86 was a pretty display. The
English fielding during the latter part of the innings was
of the poorest description. Rain that night and through-
out the day following, brilliant sunshine the next (Sunday)
till the evening, then more rain, and finally steaming sun-
shine on the Monday morning ruined the English chances
altogether. Their first essay lasted an hour and three-
quarters, and their second an hour and a half, and Aus-
tralia thus rendered “honours easy” by an innings and
147 runs majority. Peel bagged a further brace—one of
Mr. Thomas Hardy's “small ironies of life.”

Another drawn game against odds — v. Eighteen of
Armidale—was sandwiched between the game just alluded
to and that between Combined New South Wales and
Queensland. This the visitors had very little difficulty in
placing to their credit, although the Colonial combination
was a strong one. Messrs. Stoddart and Maclaren, and
later Peel and Mr. Philipson, batted well, with the result
that the tourists showed the way with a total of 192.
On a deteriorating pitch, rain having fallen in the night, the
Colonials were dismissed for 107, in which Iredale’s not
out 37, Coningham’s 20, and Percy McDonnell’s 18 were
the largest items. Briggs took four wickets for 15, and
Richardson five for 42. The weather next day was all
that could be desired, and the Englishmen piled up a
total of 279. To Mr. Maclaren (a lively 106) and Ward
(47) chief credit was due. Then a further downpour of
rain made the wicket so easy for the bowlers that the
combined eleven were dismissed for 86. Iredale (33)
again carried his bat, and Turner subscribed 20. Rich-
ardson secured four wickets for 35, and Briggs three for
14 runs. Mr. Stoddart’s eleven thus won by 278 runs.
A drawn game with Eighteen of Newcastle and District
served as a curtain raiser for the final of the test matches.
In view of the fact that this was the rubber game, each
side having won two of the preceding four matches,
interest of course was more keen than ever, and the
attendance at the Melbourne Club ground was a record
one. Australia, who were the first to go in, registered a
fine batting performance. Practically every man did his
share, and the result demonstrated the all-round character
of the Australian defence. When their turn came,
England’s exposition was on curiously similar lines.
It was the stand of Gregory and Darling for the fifth
wicket that laid the foundation of the Australian total,
and the stand of Mr. Maclaren and Peel for the fifth
English wicket carried the total of their side from 166 to 3 28.
The visitors deserved all credit for finally getting within
29 of the heavy sum set by the Colonists. On Australia
going in again, they gave for the most part a wearisome
exhibition, partly due to the close fielding. Runs came
slowly, only Lyons and Graham attempting a forcing
game. Darling’s was undoubtedly the best individual
batting show of the innings. By-the-way, it was the first
time that Richardson had succeeded in getting Giffen’s
wicket during the tour. The Surrey express trundler,
indeed, was in splendid form, playing quite up to his
reputation. Left with 297 to get to win, our men made
an unpromising start, losing the skipper and Brockwell
for 28 runs. But then came the historic partnership of
Brown and Ward, lasting two hours and twenty-five
minutes, and producing no fewer than 210 runs —certainly
the most brilliant feature of a most brilliant match. This
decided the issue, and in favour of the old country by
six wickets. Despite that it was the accident of weather
that practically gave the Englishmen their victory in the
first of the test matches, such a magnificent win as this
last one in itself justified their claiming all the honours
attached to securing the rubber.

Prior to the winding-up of the tour, came two matches
against odds, both drawn — i.e., v. Eighteen of Northern
Tasmania, and Fifteen of Southern Tasmania. Then
followed the return with Victoria, from which Mr. Stoddart
was absent through illness. At the outset the wicket was
all in favour of the bowlers, and the English skipper
losing the toss, the Victorians elected to take the field.
H. Trott was in great form with the ball, taking eight
wickets for 63 runs, and the side were disposed of for
131. But for the excellent play of Mr. Maclaren (43)
and Brockwell (25), and the free hitting of Richardson at
the close for 20, the Englishmen would have fared badly
indeed. Victoria responded with an innings of 269, the
batting of Bruce, Albert Trott, C. McLeod, and the colt
Peryman forming an important factor. Though Mr. Ford
(85), Brockwell, and Brown all played pluckily in Eng-
land’s second venture, the innings amounting to 270, it
was of no avail, and Victoria in the final stage registering
137 for three wickets (Bruce not out 72, A. Trott 44),
the trippers were defeated by seven wickets.
The closing contest at Adelaide, from which Mr.
Stoddart was again an absentee, was —as regards sen-
sational incident —quite in character with its predecessors,
and more than atoned for the defeat at Melbourne. The
opening stage resulted in a good score of 397 by South
Australia, in which Clement Hill, a young cricketer of 18,
carried his bat for 150, and Walter Giffen made 81.
Nothing daunted, the Englishmen in reply hit up a record
score against Australian bowling —609, to wit. The
innings contained no fewer than three centuries —Ward’s
219, Brown’s 101, and 106 from Mr. Ford, who, as in
the preceding match, gave the Colonials a taste of his
real quality. Peel, too, topped the half-century, and
there were only three single-figure scorers on the side.
Success was out of the question for the Australians, but
on going in again they batted steadily and consistently
for 255, in which young Hill was again seen to advantage
for 56, leaving the Englishmen with 44 to get, and but
20 minutes in which to accomplish the task. Mr. Ford
and Brockwell, however, hit so freely that the runs were
knocked off without loss and with three minutes to spare,
and Mr. Stoddart’s eleven were thus left with a victory by
ten wickets.
When the final composition was announced last
autumn, it was generally considered that the strength of
the team laid in the bowling, which on paper was varied
and extensive. As events proved, however, it was in the
batting that the tourists were strongest. In representative
encounters, the Englishmen scored 6204 runs for 206
wickets, while the Australians lost 217 wickets for an
aggregate of 5934. It was undoubtedly fortunate for the
success of the trip that each side should have won two of
the first four test games, this intensifying the interest in
the rubber match in such a remarkable degree. And
that the tour has tended towards the good of the game
in Greater Britain is beyond doubt. For purposes of
reference, the results of the eleven-a-side matches are

THE PLAYERS.
Andrew Ernest Stoddart, the brilliant captain of
the band, who very fittingly heads the batting tables, with
an average of over 51 for 17 completed inning in eleven-
a-side games, was born at South Shields, on March n,
1864. Strange to say, he did not go in for cricket till he
had attained his majority, his sporting reputation resting
till then on his exceptional ability in the football field.
Once started, however, he quickly got into his stride.
First playing for the Hampstead Club in the spring of
1885, his wonderful batting led to his inclusion in the
Middlesex eleven ere the summer was ended —a remark-
able instance of rapid promotion. On the 4th of August
in the following year, playing at Hampstead for his club
against the Stoics, Mr. Stoddart compiled an innings of
485, which remains the highest individual score ever
obtained in any match. For the past decade his equals
as a batsman have been few, and Middlesex has had good
reason to be thankful for his aid. Within a week of
piling up the huge score just mentioned, he registered
his first century for the Metropolitan county —116 against
Kent at Gravesend on August 12th and 13th —and since
then three-figure innings from his bat have been far from
scant. During the Australian tour he reached the century
on two occasions.
Archibald Campbell Maclaren, who claims the
second place in the batting tables, was born at Manchester
on December Ist, 1872, and, unlike his skipper, wielded
a bat when of tender years. He had made a name,
indeed, at Elstree School when but ten years of age, with
a score of 82 not out against Finchley School. His first
century, too, was made during his early days at Elstree.
At Harrow later on he kept up his reputation for tall
scoring, and played against Eton in 1886 with marked
success. It was in August of 1890 that Mr. Maclaren
made his first appearance in county cricket, against
Sussex at Brighton, and he signalized the event by
knocking up a matter of 108, thus making his place in
the Lancashire eleven secure. His centuries in the
course of the Australian tour were three in number, his
228 against Victoria ranking as the highest individual
score of the toYir.
J. T. Brown, the hero with Ward of the never-to-be-
forgotten stand in the last of the test matches, was born
at Driffield on August 20, 1869, and is the pride of his
fellow-townsmen. Since his opening trial for Yorkshire,
at Bradford, against Leicestershire, in July, 1889, result-
ing in a creditable score of 59, he has never looked back.
Promising at the outset, by the end of 1893 his career
was assured, his name then figuring at the top of the
Yorkshire batting averages. He brought off so many
sterling achievements in 1894, too, that his inclusion in
Mr. Stoddart’s eleven —though it came late —was highly
popular. How well he justified that inclusion is now a
matter of cricket history. He topped the century four
times, it may be noted, and took part with Ward in many
a plucky stand.
Albert Ward, who is credited with a trio of centuries,
one of them the second highest score of the tour, was
born at Waterloo, near Leeds, on November 21st, 1865,
and early displayed a capacity for the game. He was
given a trial with the Yorkshire Colts in 1884, but met
with small success, as was again the case a couple of years
later. Though he was chosen to assist his native shire
on a few occasions in 1886, he did not show anything
like his present form until, in 1889, he enlisted in the
ranks of Lancashire. He had not long been a member
of that eleven, though, when his brilliant score of 114
not out against Middlesex, at Lord’s, laid the foundation
of a reputation which his recent performances in Australia
have gone far to enhance.
Francis Gilbertson Justice Ford, another century-
scorer, is the youngest of seven brothers who have all
won distinction in the field. He was born in Sussex
Square, London, on December 14th, 1866, and had his
earliest experiences of school cricket at Eagle House,
Wimbledon. At the close of his stay there he registered
the highest score ever made at Eagle House —an innings
of 67. Later on, at Repton School, he took part in an
extraordinary Junior House match. Going in first for
his side with Mr. J. H. Kelsey, the pair knocked up 312
without the loss of a wicket. Mr. Ford (202), his partner
(101), and the rest of the eleven then retired en bloc , when
Messrs. Ford and Kelsey straightway dismissed their
opponents for 8 runs in each innings, the two bowlers


equally dividing the twenty wickets. F. G. J.’s bowling,
indeed, caused him to be tried for the School in 1882,
but he did not secure his colours till the following summer.
One of the most distinguished Public School cricketers of
his day, equally good with the bat and ball, on going to
Cambridge his “ blue ” was soon assured. His batting
for the University came fully up to expectation, too, and
during the season of 1889 he acted as captain. His
debut in county cricket took place on August 10th, 1886,
for Middlesex against Gloucestershire, at Clifton.
William Brockwell was born at Kingston-on-
Thames, on January 21, 1866, and comes of a good
cricket stock. He learned his cricket on Ham Common,
and at the age of eighteen became a member of the Ham
Club. His good all-round form led later on to his
taking part in the test practice at the Oval, and this first
trial was successful enough to secure him a place among
the Eighteen Colts chosen to oppose the County Eleven.
An engagement at the Oval followed, and so well did he
perform in minor matches, that in July, 1886, he took
his place in the County ranks, against Derbyshire at
Derby. It was not till some years later, however, that he
became regularly identified with the eleven, while his
splendid record in 1894, when he piled century upon
century and headed the first-class averages, will be fresh
in the reader’s mind.
Robert Peel was born at Charwell, in Yorkshire, on
February 12th, 1857, and for the past twelve years has
been recognised as one of the best all-round cricketers
we have one of those players you would rather have on
your side than amongst your opponents. If one day he
does not come off with the bat, he will atone with the
ball, and vice versa. His bowling during the Australian
tour was of the greatest value to his side, as it has often
been to Yorkshire, for whom he made his first appearance
on July 10th, 1882, against Surrey, at Sheffield. The
success that he met with on that occasion was only the
precursor of a long run, during which he has done
excellent service to his county and his country.
John Briggs— better known as “Johnny” or “the
Midget”—was born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts, on
October 3 r d, 1862, and was introduced to first-class
cricket at the age of sixteen. He did so well in the
Colts match at Old Trafford, in the spring of 1879, that
he was given a place in the Lancashire eleven in their
opening contest of the year, against Notts, in which he
acquitted himself so well against the difficult bowling as
to prove the highest scorer - on the side. During his
sixteen years of important cricket, he —like Peel —has
always been in the front rank of all-round players, while
his bowling in particular was a distinct factor in the
success of Mr. Stoddart’s tour. Briggs is one of the only
four cricketers (the others being W.G., Barlow, and
Flowers) who have bowled a thousand wickets and
scored ten thousand runs.
William Henry Lockwood, an equally distinguished
“all-rounder,” was born at Old Radford, Notts, on
March 25, 1868, and made his initial appearance in
county cricket on June 28th, 1886, playing for Notts
against Gloucestershire, at Moreton-in-Marsh. Though
he did not meet with overwhelming success in his four
shows for his native county, the Surrey committee deemed
it good enough to give him an engagement at the Oval,
and how correct their judgment was has since been
conclusively demonstrated. His first noteworthy achieve-
ment for Surrey was against Oxford University, at the
Oval, in June, 1889, when he carried out his bat for 53.
He has since come to be recognised as one of the main-
stays of the Surrey eleven.
Thomas Richardson was born at Byfleet on August
nth, 1870, and obtained his earlier cricket on Mitcham
Green. His first appearance for Surrey —against Essex
at Kennington Oval on May 16th, 1892 —was attended
with marked success, the express bowler getting twelve
wickets in the match at a cost of 100 runs In 1893 and
’94 he was responsible for not a few noteworthy feats.
At the Oval in June of the latter year, for instance, he
secured all ten wickets of Essex in an innings. Many of
Surrey’s later victories have been largely owing to his
strong right arm, while, all things considered, his record
for the Australian tour is distinctly creditable. It was
chiefly owing to his bowling that England got the upper
hand in the last of the test matches. Apart from his
bowling talent, Richardson is a very lively hitter, usually
having a short but merry life at the wicket.
Hylton Philipson, who kept wicket in four of the five
test matches, and showed brilliant form in that position,
was born at Tynemouth on June Bth, 1866. He was a
member of the Eton eleven of 1884, and shone with the
bat as well as “ behind the sticks.” His Public School
reputation was fully maintained at Oxford, and he cap-
tained the University eleven in 1889. He was once con-
cerned in a memorable partnership. Playing for Oxford
against Middlesex, in June, 1887, at Chiswick Park, he
and Mr. K. J. Key put on 340 runs for the seventh wicket,
of which sum his share was a well-got 150. Though not


so renowned for his batting nowadays, his wicket keeping
is evidently as good as ever.
Walter Humphreys was born at Southsea on October
28,1849, and made his first appearance for Sussex as long
ago as 1871. He has in his time been credited with not
a few good scores, though he is of course best known as
a lob bowler. In 1893, indeed, his lobs proved remark-
ably effective. In Australia, however, they only came off
in the rural districts. And yet, in 1880, he got the wickets
of Murdoch, McDonnell, Groube, Bonnor, and Blackham
for 32 runs, the three last with successive balls. He was
not played in any of the five test matches.
L. H. Gay, an excellent wicket-keeper and capable
batsman, was born on March 24, 1871, and educated at
Brighton College and Cambridge University. He figured
as a member of the Light Blue eleven in 1892 and ’93,
and with success. In the latter year he assisted Hamp-
shire, but the season following he transferred his allegiance
to Somersetshire.

THE COMBINATION The „ e cautioned
against spurious imitations of
our celebrated RUBBER'FACED

any climate and not to harden
The ball is firmly held and does
not slip.
