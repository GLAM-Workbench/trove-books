INTRODUCTION.
In presenting my Catalogue for the present season to my numerous patrons in New
South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and the various provinces in New Zealand, I
very respectfully tender my sincere thanks for past favors, and solicit their con-
tinued patronage and recommendation, which will receive my faithful attention.
Owing to the distance of Camden from the Railway, I have formed a Depdt
at Campbelltown, therefore I shall be more favorably situated for executing orders
both for the up-country and adjacent Colonies, and may also remark that I hav6
spared no expense in making structures for the growth and packing of Plants
superior to anything to be found in New South Wales, and parties may rely on
goods being packed so as to insure their safe arrival, if only ordinary care be
bestowed on them after leaving my hands.
Gentlemen who contemplate planting largely are invited to inspect the Camp-
belltown depot, where they can choose from a collection of 50,000 well-grown
healthy plants, superior to anything to be found in the Australian colonies. The
endless variety of plants now in cultivation renders it impossible to enumerate all,
and it is with a view of assisting purchasers that I have named only those most
worthy of cultivation, although all the older kinds are still kept and can be sup-
plied at the usual prices.
Ladies and Gentlemen, unacquainted with botanical nomenclature, will do
well to make me aware, in general terms, with their wants, and leave the selection
to me, limiting the amount, and may rest assured that none but the best kinds
will be sent, and at less than Catalogue prices.
Amateurs and others, in selecting their own varieties, are requested to add a
few extra plants at the foot of their orders, lest the stock of any particular kind
should have been disposed of ; but this will never be made use of if the required
kinds are on hand.
I also have great pleasure in calling particular attention to the many novelties
I this year offer, all of which have been introduced by myself, regardless of ex-
pense, and which I trust will meet the approval of all interested in new Plants.
] have made arrangements with my despatching Agents so as to insure the
speedy transmission of all parcels for the interior. All orders above £2 will be
delivered ireo in Sydney, and extra plants added to orders from a distance to com-
pensate to some extent for the cost of transit.

CAMELLIAS.
Next to the Rose, perhaps no flowering shrnb is so universal a favorite as this.
To cultivate them successfully choose a sheltered situation, well drained, and
trenched two feet deep, adding a quantity of alluvial soil; avoid rich animal
manures. The first summer the plants will require a few branches of Tea Tree or
Pinus halepensis placed around them, so as to break the sun’s rays. When
they require watering, let this be applied copiously, and at long intervals. In
making a selection choose young, thrifty plants, that have been but a short time
in pots ; avoid as much as possible selecting plants because they have a few flower
buds, for it invariably happens in this colony such plants are forced into flower
through being starved and otherwise badly managed. These never do well, but
dwindle on for a year or two, and then die. This is the real cause of so many
failures : it is not the cold, for there is no part of the table land of this colony
where spots may not be found admirably adapted for the growth of this favorite flower.
My stock of this is exceedingly healthy, and numbering upwards of 6000 plants,
in 100 varieties ; many of the older kinds are suppressed, but can still be supplied
at the usual prices.

INDIAN AZALEAS.
1s. 6d. each.
These, in point of beauty, follow after the Camellias. Usually I grow large quantities,
in many varieties; but the present season, owing to the great amount of humidity,
has been peculiarly favorable to the spread of the “thrips,” a little insect exceedingly
destructive to this plant in particular. This has prevented me propagating my usual
large collection, and, therefore, offer only the following limited but exceedingly choice
list, as being the hardiest kinds and those sorts which will resist the attacks of the
“ thrips.” I have ceased to grow the old and common kinds. The Azalea requires a
moist peaty soil and a sheltered situation, with copious waterings during the dry
summer months.
