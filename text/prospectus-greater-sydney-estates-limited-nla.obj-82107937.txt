OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY
The Company is being formed with the object of:?
1 Subdividing, developing and selling on the usual terms of deferred
payment 634 acres (approximately) in the Parish of Narrabeen,
Shire of Warringah.
2 , Purchasing, subdividing, and selling on the usual terms of deferred
payments, other properties, from time to time.
3 Assisting purchasers of building lots, on the properties offered for
sale, by financing them in the building of suitable residences and by
providing transport facilities.
4. Carrying out such other enterprises and projects as shall be incidental
to and assist the Company in the achievement of its main objects.
5 . Purchasing city property and re-selling at a profit.
OBJECTIVE No. I.?GENERAL REFERENCES.
LAND.?The land which the Company has acquired is situated
in the Parish of Narrabeen, in the Shire of Warringah, and comprises
127,000 selling feet, the selling price being estimated at �381,000.
127,000
Selling Feet
for �381,000
The cost of land and construction of roads, together with the
expense of selling and administration would be, approximately,
�231,000, leaving a profit of �150,000.
POPULATION. ?The rapidly increasing population of Sydney
has outpaced the housing accommodation. Although 10,000
houses were built in Sydney last year, thousands of houses are still
needed to meet the immediate demand. It is, therefore, obvious that
the residential area must be carried further into the suburbs.
Greater
Sydney.
Allied to the increasing congestion, there is a growing disposition
to abandon flat life, with its monotony and inconvenience, and to
get out into the open spaces, where the acquisition of land for building
is a sound investment and an appreciating asset for years to come.
NATURAL LOCATION. ?The natural residential area of
Sydney is on the North side of the Harbour, and Dr. Bradfield, the
designer and engineer of the North Shore Bridge, estimates that the
population of Northern Sydney will reach 1,250,000 within the
next few years, and he predicts a period of great development fol-
lowing the completion of the Harbour Bridge, and the electrification
of the railway system.
Population of
North Sydney
1,250,000.
Ten years ago, ten miles from the City was regarded as a long
distance and costing too much time and money to make practicable
the building of a home. To-day housing conditions have altered.
The problem of cheap and rapid transit has been solved and now


fine residential areas close to the most magnificent beaches in the
world and all naturally beautiful country, arc being rapidly ac-
quired for building purposes.
The North Shore Bridge, the Spit Bridge and Roseville
Bridge, have not only created interest but they have led to the
recognition of the wonderful advantages and possibilities of the
Northern side of the Harbour.
Ist ESTATE SUBDIVISION, WARRINGAH SHIRE.
The first estates acquired by the Company are in the Parish of
Narrabeen, in the Shire of Warringah.
Warringah Shire is one of the most beautiful tracts of country
in the world and its area of 69,120 acres, including 39 reserves
covering an area of 1,205 acres, and a portion of Kur-in-gai Chase,
comprising another 15,800 acres. Thus there is one acre of park
land for every three acres of residential land or, approximately, one
acre to 50 people, compared with the highest standard in England
and America garden cities of one acre of park to 10 acres of acquired
land, one acre of park to 200 people.
The climate is ideal and no district either North or South of
Sydney enjoys more equitable temperature. Frosts are unknown
and tropical fruits may be grown all the year round.
The Warringah Shire is the Florida of Australia and about the
most beautiful district of its kind in the world, and yet with all
its natural beauty and advantages it is within ten miles of the
General Post Office, Sydney.
10 Miles
from G.P.O,
Statistics show that this area has progressed more rapidly in the
last few years than almost any other part around Sydney. Many
fine homes have been erected already, some of them costing thousands
of pounds to build.
Wahroonga is the highest point of the North Shore Line, being
620 feet above sea level, but the properties the Company proposes
to acquire in the first instance have an elevation of 640 feet above
sea level. Some parts of the property are on the shores of the
Narrabeen Lakes.
Health-
640 feet
Above Sea
Level.
Fishing, boating and swimming are available and within a short
distance are fine beaches, where surfing may be enjoyed. A new golf
links is being made in the vicinity and when completed will be the
finest course in Australia.
Recreation.
The line of the new railway passes through the properties and
provides direct railway service from the North Shore Bridge to
Narrabeen, via North Sydney, Crow?s Nest, Neutral Bay, Mosman,
and the Spit.
Access
Railway.


The Daily Guardian, 19th October, 1926, reported Dr. Bradfield
as predicting an unprecedented period of unfettered development fol-
lowing the completion of the Harbour Bridge and the electrification
of the railway system. The Northern Suburbs, Dr. Bradfield thinks,
should develop into an independent city with a population of one
and a quarter millions. He stated that his main idea is to provide
direct railway service from the bridge to Narrabeen, via North
Sydney, Crow?s Nest, Neutral Bay, Mosman and the Spit. With
good trafficable roads throughout the Northern Suburbs and with
four lines of railway crossing the bridge, carrying fom 180 to 200
trains an hour, Dr. Bradfield thinks that the Northern side will soon
grow to be an independent city. To cater for the enormous motor
traffic, which he estimates will be about 3,000 vehicles daily, Dr.
Bradfield predicts that the North Sydney waterfront will be lined
with shops.
Bradfield.
Road 100
feet wide.
The Warringah Shire Council is about to lay a concrete road
from the Spit to Newport, 100 feet wide. The Survey is in progress
and actual construction will start within a few months.
Motor ?Bus
Service.
A particularly fine motor transport service is now operating a
fast comfortable fleet of safety coaches, running throughout the
district.
In regard to those lots which in the opinion of the Company
are not adequately served with transport, the Company undertakes
to institute a regular ?bus service, communicating with the main
arteries of traffic.
Some of the properties referred to are already roaded and the
materials for making the other necessary roads for sub-division are
on the land.
Land in this district is already bringing high prices and several
large blocks have recently changed hands at figures undreamt of a
few years back.
Value?
In the Dee Why District, which adjoins Narrabeen, a man who
purchased three acres less than four years ago at �5O an acre, has
disposed of one acre for nearly ten times that amount. Other blocks
of land near-by, which a decade ago were practically unsaleable, now
command �3 a foot. Land in the adjacent District of Pittwater
has realised up to �2O a foot and there is a big demand for all
classes of land throughout the Warringah Shire. All recent sub-
divisions have been sold very quickly.
�2O a foot.
It is abundantly evident that the demand for residential land
will exceed the supply for very many years to come and greatly
increasing values must obtain, even beyond the ten mile boundary.
Great
The next three to five years will witness the most tremendous
development and it is not at all difficult to visualise that before
long the demand will force us out to the tweny-mile boundary
for suburban area and transit facilities will be provided. It is merely
history repeating itself, for this has happened in all the largest cities
of the civilised world.
Development.


PROFITS AND SECURITY.
These seldom go together. Usually as the possibility of profits
increases the risk increases proportionately.
Profit* for
You.
Of all investments known to Australian mankind, real estate
represents the last word ?every financial institution in this country
places it easily first, the finest of all securities. So far from de-
preciating with the passing of time, the value often doubles, trebles
and quadruples in value in a year or so. Men who know, know
for a certainty that when the North Shore Bridge is opened for
traffic there will be a general rush for land and land values will
enormously increase. Values have not been anticipated to anything
like their full worth. The man who waits until the Bridge is up
and open before he buys land, will not make anything like the
money that will be made by the man who buys NOW. The man
who has the land can call the tunc to the man who has not.
Your
In Sydney's huge population there arc tens of thousands of in-
vestors, large and small, who have never been able to share in the
tremendous profits from real estate, for the simple reason that they
have never been allowed the opportunity. The opportunity is here
now. Those who take up shares in the Company will have prac-
tically simultaneously the opportunity of purchasing land which
will in effect materially reduce to them the cost of the investment
and they will share in the profits earned by the Company.
opportunity.
All conversant with the development which has taken place in
the City of Sydney and suburbs during the last few years must
realise that the movement of Real Estate has been marked by a rise
in prices which has been continuously and steadily maintained.
Large fortunes have been made by people who have been awake to
opportunities and whose successful results have proved their con-
fidence in the growth of the City fully justified.
City of
Sydney.
If reference were made to a map of the City, it would be seen
that the City Area is extremely circumscribed, being limited on the
West by the waters of the Darling Harbour, and on the East by
land reserves such as the Botanic Gardens, the Domain and Hyde
Park, which are never likely to be alienated.
Large areas are frequently being resumed for Government, Mu-
nicipal and other purposes, and this land is withdrawn from the
market permanently, thereby further restricting the area of city
land available for commercial needs which, owing to natural de-
velopment of the City and increase in population, are constantly
increasing. Sydney has now attained to the position of the second
largest White City in the British Empire, being surpassed only by
London. The following figures, tabled in the Legislative Assembly
last year, eloquently demonstrate the development which has taken
place over a short term of years.

PROFIT RETURN ON CAPITAL-25 per cent.
Apart altogether from the big prospective value in the land which it is
proposed to develop, it is estimated that a profit of 25% per annum will be made
on the capital involved. This return is shown by the following conservative
estimate: ?
Proceeds of Sales:?
127,000 feet of land at valuation (�3 per foot) �381,000
Cost of Land (9/1 per ft.) �57,520
Road Construction and Survey 63,500
Selling Expenses 63,500
Formation, Administration, Overhead Expenses,
Rates and Taxes (including Income Tax
�29,800) 71,480
} 256,000
�125,000
Estimated Profit (in 5 years)
The selling price, estimated at �3 per ft. frontage, is a conservative figure
baaed upon the average development only, but for the higher and more distinctive
development intended, the Company is advised that the average will be about �4
per ft., in which case the profit of the Company will be increased and shareholders
will receive higher returns.
The Directors are of the opinion that Paid-Up Capital of �lOO,OOO will
prove adequate to finance the transaction outlined above. As the estimated
annual profit is �25,000, the return is equal to 25% per annum on capital.
The figures provide for the payment of the land and the sale of the lots
within five years; but as a matter of fact, as already stated, the policy of the
Company is to acquire other properties from time to time, to create a permanent
organisation for the acquisition, subdivision and sale of suitable estates.

THE COMPANY?S PROSPECTUS
INDICATED BY
PRESS REPORTS.
THROUGH BUS SERVICE
Sun, Nov, 9, 1926
Two motor bus companies made application last night to the Warringah Shire
Council for permission to run additional buses. One company intends establishing a
half-hourly through service to Newport and Palm Beach, which would obviate the
changing-over at Narrabeen, as at present. The same company, with a view to
encouraging settlement from Newport northwards, is offering free transport to and
from Manly for 12 months to every householder who builds his own home and settles
in that area. Council appointed a committee to go into the question of drawing up a
time-table.
GROWTH OF BEACH SUBURBS
A few striking comparisons showing how Sydney?s Beach land has increased in
value during the past few years: ?

These prices are a fair average for Residential land, and do not include shop sites.
LAND VALUES
ARE STILL RISING
Evening News, Oct, 18, 1926
The increase in land values which has been such a pronounced feature of Sydney?s
recent growth, should continue. It is nothing in these days to see quotations of from �8
to �l6 a foot in attractive suburbs, and for choice positions anything up to �4O a foot is
frequently required. No one can visualise a stoppage of the growth of Sydney. It is and


will remain Australia?s leading city. Its unique central position; its magnificent
harbour, and the unrivalled beauty of its environs, ensure for it a proud pre-eminence
among the cities of the Southern Hemisphere. Sydney has a destiny of which we can
have only an imperfect idea, but undoubtedly it will be a glorious one. Even now our
city is reaching out for its second million, and another generation will see it containing
as many people as there are now in the whole of New South Wales and Victoria
combined.
IMPROVING DAILY.
We can conscientiously say, too, that "every day in every way it grows better and
better.? In the heart of the city the old buildings which were good enough 40 or even
20 years ago, are being replaced by magnificent structures more in keeping with the
immense business requirements of the present day, while the strings of old terraces in
which the early citizens of the inner suburbs lived are steadily being replaced by shops,
factories and warehouses. No one will regret the passing of these out-of-date tene-
ments, for they offered a minimum of sunshine, fresh air, sanitation and comfort. A
very welcome contrast is afforded by the modern, convenient and airy villas which are
a distinguished feature of the newer suburbs. Set in large allotments, and with plenty
of room for lawns and gardens and playing spaces for children, they are doing much to
raise the general standard of health.
LESSON FOR HOME-SEEKERS.
All this has its lesson for those who are securing or intend to secure their homes in
some part of Greater Sydney. They will undoubtedly see enormous increases in land
values, and sites which are now available at �2 or �3 a foot will, at no distant date, be
unprocurable at two or three times their present value. Every young man and woman
would therefore be well advised to look ahead and make provision for the years to come.
KEEN DEMAND
FOR HOME LOTS
ONLY SMALL AREAS LEFT
Evening News, Jan. 21, 1927
The demand for residential lots is so keen that agents are forced to re-subdivide
suburban areas in order to satisfy clients. Prices, as a consequence, have risen to an extent
that would not have been dreamt of even so short a period as two years ago. An instance
is given of an estate in the northern suburbs, when the average price offered was
�3/18/- a foot; but no sales were effected. During this month the whole was sold at
prices ranging from �6 to �B/5/- a foot. Unlike those who purchased blocks before
the present Local Government Act came into force, buyers at present subdivision sales
are assured good roads and decent footpaths. The provisions of the Act that ensures
that streets of new subdivisions must be kerbed and guttered has relieved purchasers of
a great liability, besides convening upon them the inestimable benefit of having proper
access to their properties. Kerbing and guttering alone save purchasers at least 10/- a
foot frontage, which they would have to pay if the local council had to carry it out; but
at the same time the fact that the streets and footpaths are formed tends to cause keener


competition, and consequently high prices have to be paid. There are no large areas of
land in the near suburbs to be cut up, but in the outer suburbs many estates are coming
on to the market, and the roads and footpaths that have been made are better than most
of the busy streets of the inner old settled suburbs.
LAND BOOM
IN WARRING AH SHIRE
TALK OF RAILWAY
Evening News, July 26, 1926
Ever since Dr. Bradfield gave it as his opinion that the Spit railway bridge would
be an accomplished fact before very long, something like a land boom has set in, in
Warringah Shire. Several large blocks of land have recently changed hands at figures
undreamt of a few years back. The vicinity of South Creek Road, which branches off
Pittwater Road, about half-way between Dee Why and Collaroy, is a much-favoured
locality with speculators. A man who purchased three acres facing the road, less than
four years ago, at �5O an acre, has disposed of one acre for nearly ten times that amount.
Other blocks of land nearby, which a decade ago were practically unsaleable, now com-
mand from �2/10/- to �3 a foot.
COMPARISONS
THE SUBDIVISION QUESTION
DEMAND EXCEEDS SUPPLY
Evening News, 1926
Some interesting sidelights on a rather debatable question as to whether the sub-
dividers in the Sydney metropolitan area are making available sufficient home sites to
meet the demand, or whether the subdividor is too far ahead, were afforded by one of
the leading subdivisional firms. The opinion expressed was that the point resolved itself
into one of simple arithmetic. Thus, in a city where the population exceeds a million,
as Sydney?s population now does, a fair expectation of the annual increase would be 5 per
cent. That is to say, our annual population increases at the present time by about 50,000
people. Calculating upon a basis of five people to the household, this would mean an
annual requirement of 10,000 additional houses each year. The building statistics pub-
lished by the Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board show that this is about the number
of new dwellings erected. Assuming that there are four allotments to the acre, and this
would be a fair assumption, when allowance is made for streets, reservations, railways,
parks and other utilities ?it will be seen that not less than 2,500 acres would require to
be annually subdivided in the metropolitan area to meet the existing demand. It is
stated that the total area of land in subdivision to which the suburban councils have
attached their seal of approval has not, on the average for the last few years, exceeded
this area. It must follow that the demand for some time has exceeded the supply, and
that reserves of subdivisions arranged and carried out in previous years, have been
drawn upon to meet the needs of the growing population.


RECORD PRICES
RESIDENTIAL LAND
A MARKED REVIVAL
Evening News, Oct. 22, 1926
There is a marked revival in residential land values throughout the whole metro-
politan area, and at this season?s outdoor sales agents expect to obtain record prices. The
demand for building sites comes at a time when land is scarce. The boom of five years
ago practically depleted many of the most desirable suburbs, and "close-in? land is, as a
consequence, hard to obtain. There are, however, a few estates that were held back, and
these are now coming on to the market. Following a depressed period that extended over
the past two years, due to the shortage of money available for building purposes, agents
are naturally jubilant over the new turn of events.
SELL PRIVATELY.
As showing the brisk turn which the demand has taken, they report that even for
blocks that are advertised for sale by auction only they are inundated by requests to sell
by private treaty. Prospective buyers seem aware of the fact that they will have to
pay considerably higher prices now ?20, and in some instances, 50 per cent, higher than
ruled last year. The average increase in values is accepted as 10 per cent., and the excep-
tional appreciation that is now evident is put down to the fact that building loans are
easy to negotiate, thus causing the demand for building blocks to exceed the supply.
The progress of the electrifying of the railways, and the building of the Harbour
Bridge are also factors that must be taken into consideration.
EXPANSION OF SYDNEY
Sydney Morning Herald, Jan. 6, 1927
The annual return of the Water Board indicates the amazing rapidity with which
Sydney is expanding. According to figures supplied therein, 10,844 buildings were
completed in the city and suburbs during the year which has just ended. Taken over
a period of years, the statistics supply further evidence of growth. In 1914 the aggre-
gate was 10,546. Since 1920, on the average, more than 10,000 buildings have been
constructed annually.
The city quota represents a mere fraction of the whole?actually it is 168 ?and
we may safely assume that the vast majority of the suburban buildings are new. Also,
while the former, with the exception of some blocks of flats, are used for business pur-
poses, a high proportion of the latter are residences. Yet, despite these large annual
increases, the housing problem continues to be acute. The industrial suburbs in the
immediate vicinity of the city proper are already built upon to the limit of their
capacity; they are almost stationary, as far as building is concerned. Much of this
development has been, if not caused, at least facilitated, by the motor buses. They have
opened up new routes and provided communication with places which were formerly
inaccessible.


It is interesting to speculate on the effect which the opening of the Harbour
Bridge will have upon the north side. Unquestionably it will be very great. Had Sir
Henry Parkes? dream been fulfilled, and had the bridge come into being half a century
or so ago, the whole topography of Sydney and its environs would be quite different.
The south side, with its long start and its established claims, would have remained the
business centre. But the development of the north side for residential purposes would
have been anticipated by many years. We may conjecture that a chain of suburbs
would have stretched from the North Shore heights to Narrabeen, by way of French?s
Forest on the one hand, and to Ryde on the other. This region has many advantages
over certain low-lying and dusty areas on the outskirts of Sydney, and had direct com-
munication with the city been available it would probably have been "colonised? be-
fore they were. Its turn will come. Growth is a natural process, which cannot be
checked. The owners of those 10,000 buildings chose the sites of their own volition
and because they suited them. We cannot dictate to them where they are to build. Let
us rather take pride in the fact that we are citizens of a great city?a city which is
destined to become greater still.
BIG FUTURE FOR NORTH SHORE
ABNORMAL LAND VALUES ARE PREDICTED
NEW RAILWAYS
Daily Guardian, Nov. 24, 1926
That property values in the Northern Suburbs will increase at an abnormally rapid
rate during the next few years, is the general prediction of experts. In the experience
of Great Britain and America, it has been shown that the construction of large public
works has accelerated the increase in property values beyond the normal, and this will
certainly take place in the Northern Suburbs owing to the construction of the Harbour
Bridge and the electrification and extension of the railways. In an interview with The
Guardian , Dr. Bradfield said that the future would be a period of unprecedented devel-
opment for the Northern Suburbs.
EXCEED CITY VALUES.
"In 1921,? he said, "the unimproved capital value of property in the City of
Sydney was more than double that of the shires and municipalities on the northern side
of the harbour. But within the next 20 years the unimproved capital value of North
Shore property will exceed that of the City. This will be mainly due,? continued the
engineer, "to the fact that the Bridge will afford the Northern Suburbs adequate rail-
way and roadway communication with the City. In addition,? he went on, "the Coun-
cils of the Shires and Municipalities on the North Shore should be in a much better
financial position than they are to-day. In 1931 they should have at least double the
amount of money to expend in civic improvements than they had in 1921, while in
1941 they should have at least four times the amount they had in 1921. As a result
of the Bridge, it has been estimated that the population of the Northern Suburbs will
be at least 290,000 in 1931, which will be double what it was in 1921.?


J ft?/-'
"This must result,? said Dr. Bradfield, "in an increase in business and general
prosperity.? From these statistics, which show the past and forecast the future growth
in population, traffic, and property values, Dr. Bradfield is able to visualise the
Northern Suburbs of the future.
IN THE FUTURE.
The City proper, he thinks, will become a New York in miniature, while North
Sydney, Mosman, and Willoughby will merge into a second Brooklyn, with property
values in places equalling those of the City. Then, too, there will be cross-country elec-
tric railways, such as that from Gordon to St. Ives to Tumble-Down Dick and Narra-
been, giving these fine residential suburbs immediate access to the beaches extending
from Manly to Palm Beach.


�30,000,000 SPENT BY 1930.
The Daily Guardian, 20th Aug., 1927.
Remarkable progress made by Sydney during the last ten years has definitely established it as the second greatest
white city of the Empire.
Standing on a great tongue of sandstone, the city proper embraces an area of 3,000 acres, and is fast outgrowing
the available building space.
Massive structures of concrete are rearing their mighty frames to the skies, and the building reconstruction of
Sydney proper, involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, is proceeding apace.
The fringe of intensive residential settlement has long since been forced past the old-established and congested
municipalities, and the outer and newer suburbs are benefiting extensively from this outward trek of population.
The population of Sydney increased from 139,000 50 years ago to 1,350,000 at the present time, and as
authoritative statistics estimate the average annual increase at 30,000 the population of the metropolis should
reach a million and a half within the next four years.
There is every indication of this remarkable figure being reached when one considers the stimulus that must
come from industrial and commercial expansion, overseas and interstate migration, and fostering of secondary
industries.
OVERWHELMING EXPANSION.
Already the older suburbs, unable to cope with the progress of modern town planning and hygienic housing
principles, have been affected adversely, and year by year sees the irresistible and overwhelming expansion of
Sydney's teeming thousands.
The City of Sydney may be likened to a huge octopus, forever throwing its hungry and enveloping tentacles
further and further, and covering within its grasp many square miles of new residential territory.
Already the Government has realised the immense problems of the immediate future, and huge developmental
schemes and comprehensive and radical transit plans are now in hand to cope with and satisfactorily administer
the many and varied public services required by one of the greatest cities of the world.
SPENDING �30,000.000.
Approximately �30,000,000 is to be spent by 1930 on the transformation and improvement of existing
railway transit services, while Local Government bodies and private enterprise are assisting materially to meet
the impending difficulties of this great metropolis.
While a broad national legislative policy of protection can, and is, of invaluable assistance to the general
welfare and prosperity of the State, yet it is in particular the Local Government bodies and kindred associations
that are slowly but effectively bringing into being a greater and a more splendid Sydney.
The Sydney of 1930 should be wonderful to behold, and with such great industrial and business expansion
and extensive suburban settlement one is not unduly optimistic in estimating the unimproved capital value of
the county of that date at �200,000,000.

THE COMPANY?S PROSPECTS & ACTIVITIES
in the opinion of individual authorities.
cMr. NORMAN WEEKES.
Mr. Norman Weekes, a recognised authority with wide experience in the subject of city and suburban
development, has, after a close study of the development of Greater Sydney, made some notes upon the possibilities
of this district and the estates acquired by the Company and refers to the unique situation of the locality and sites
in these terms: ?
?LOCALITY.??A population, while yet comparatively small and accustomed to the almost infinite bounty
of Nature in the Harbour and tributaries, can scarcely realise the value for residential purposes which the people
of less fortunate cities would place upon such a locality. Charming as almost any suburb of Sydney is, the
highlands, creeks and gullies of the Shires of Warringah and Kuringai constitute the ideal locality for residential
purposes, and there are few where Nature has made this so abundantly clear and unmistakable.
This is, in fact, demonstrated by the demand which exists for the North Shore Line, and the irresistible
attraction of the ocean beaches, and it is inevitable that on the same principle the creation of new centres must
open up equally valuable land in the locality as the desire and necessity arise for homes situated in healthy and
beautiful surroundings.
And with regard to the Company?s Estates, Mr. Weekes states: ?
SITE.
LOCATION.?In a locality where every prospect pleases and every site has some advantage it is not easy
to say which is most attractive: but if a choice were made for beauty, it is difficult to imagine one with better
prospect than the Company?s 600-acre Estate lying around the head of Narrabeen Creek and upon the ridge
overlooking the head of the Davidson Park and tributaries to Middle Harbour, and where the French?s Forest
and Pittwater roads meet.
This particular Estate in size and location is an ideal centre for the creation of a new township: for access
it is equi-distant from the existing North Shore Line?Gordon Station 5 miles, Narrabeen tram and ?bus services
4i miles?and the regular ?bus services which the Company will run to Chatswood provides the Estate with a
direct connection to what Is and will become more and more the shopping metropolis of the Northern Suburbs
and within 45 minutes of the city. All the Estates are in a particularly favourable position, lying right on the
route of the future Gordon-Narrabeen Electric Railway Extension, with a station at the entrance to the township.
HOMES.?The topography of these Estates is such that, properly planned, every home will, as an improvement
on most subdivisions, have the fullest opportunity to enjoy the views and other natural amenities of the site and
locality.
That it is the Company?s intention to render the fullest assistance to purchasers, not only in financing the
building of their homes, but without restricting the style to assist and to advise upon their design and landscape
setting, is an admirable spirit of co-operation between vendor and purchaser and will ensure the most appropriate
and desirable result to the owners? advantage and that of the Estate generally.
SERVICES. ?In studying typical suburban estate subdivisions the most outstanding impression has been
the painful lack of adequate services and convenience, and a company able to foresee and provide for all services
beforehand will find it mutually beneficial and profitable. I have had in mind always that, when a home site is
offered for sale, with it there should go a roadway and footway properly drained and suitably paved, tree
planted and fenced: with water, gas and electricity already laid on, and adequate septic or other satisfactory
means of waste disposal.
The provision of these facilities will constitute the greatest advance of recent years in estate subdivision,
and one which will place it in the forefront of estates most acceptable to the public desiring homes under the
most favourable conditions.
SUPPLIES. ?The planning of such an estate will include provision for local retail shopping, and
for distributing depots to place the residents within ready access of the convenience of city stores.
RECREATION. ?Probably the earliest need of all in a new community centre is a GUEST HOUSE, a
focal centre or gateway to the township where intending residents may be offered an hospitable acquaintance
with the locality, provided with rest, refreshment and car service: casually, daily, or for any period that they
desire to see, enjoy, and come to understand the possibilities of the development.
The Company is to be congratulated on its intention to provide such a building. It will be the avenue
of introduction for all and sundry who desire from whatever cause to become acquainted with the Estate development
and the Company?s activities, and to enjoy the natural recreational facilities which are the outstanding feature of
this area.
GOLF is within walking distance at Pymblc, at Mona Vale, or the Country Club links immediately adjacent
to the Estate. TENNIS and BOWLS will be provided at once in the grounds of the Guest House on the larger
Estate. SURFING is also within walking distance, and the Estates are surrounded by parks and parklands through
which WALKS and DRIVES afford an unparalleled advantage to a residential neighbourhood.


cMr, W. H. JACKSON , Estate Agent , of Newport , oMona Vale,
and City, writes :
Land situated in the Parish of Narrabeen, Shire of Warringah.
When the subdivision roads are completed according to the requirements of the Warringah Shire Council,
and taking into consideration the fact that water, electricity and transport facilities are guaranteed when purchasers
are living on the Estate, also that it is proposed that if a purchaser dies during the time of contract of purchase
it is guaranteed that the title deeds are to be handed to the next of kin free of all encumbrances, I estimate that
this land, handled by an efficient selling organisation, could be sold on extended terms in subdivision blocks at
�3 per foot or more.
The proposed railway from Gordon to Narrabeen passes alongside the property, with a station within one
hundred yards of portion of the property.
When the North Shore Bridge is completed and communication provided, I consider that the value of this
land will more than double.
The new Country Club and Golf Links at Narrabeen, when completed, must have a further favourable
effect on land values in this district.

MEMO TO OUR CLIENTS.
After nearly thirty years experience in the handling of investments, we are in the
unique position of being able to say that during the whole of this time we have never
offered our clients shares in any Company which did not prove a good investment.
This is the first occasion on which we have had the good fortune to offer an investment
in real estate, and we have not done so without having spent many months of the most thor-
ough investigation and careful thought on the
cribes the aims and objects of the Company,
emphasis.
scheme. The enclosed prospectus fully des-
There are, however, several points worthy of
Many real estate operators have expressed
to acquire the properties referred to at such
astonishment that the Company has been able-
a low figure and, indeed, even while the
prospectus was being printed, a certain real estate syndicate offered the Company a profit
of �lO per acre making a total of �5,360, for one of the subdivisions. This offer was
declined. The Directors are fully aware of the value of this property and do not intend
to deviate from their original plan to give the public an opportunity to invest, enabling
them to participate in the substantial profits which inevitably must accrue. The Direc-
tors feel, also, that a great number of those who invest in the shares of the Company will
purchase blocks in the subdivisions as an additional investment of remarkable potential
value. Hitherto, real estate firms and private syndicates have been reaping the profits
from subdivisions. THIS WILL BE THE PEOPLE'S INVESTMENT!
Those subscribing for 250 shares or more end purchasing within six months one or more
blocks of land, WILL BE ALLOWED A SPECIAL DISCOUNT OF TEN PER CENT OFF THE PRICE OF THE
LAND SO PURCHASED.
Another point worthy of special mention is that it is the consensus of opinion, not
only in this State, but realised by authorities in all the States, that on the completion
of the North Shore Bridge, the land referred to will IMMEDIATELY DOUBLE IN VALUE AND WITHIN
FIVE YEARS IT WILL BE WORTH FIVE TIMES THE PRICE WHICH THE COMPANY NOW PLACES UPON IT.
Still another good feature is the fact that we, as the Company's Brokers, show our
confidence in the Company's prospects by underwriting firmly 25,000 shares, thus enabling
the Company to proceed to allotment immediately.
The holders of the first 50,000 shares are entitled to an Option over an equal number
of shares to those applied for at par value (�l) within eighteen months.
For another Company whose capital we secured we received a large number of applications
for shares carrying Option Rights AFTER the issue was closed. We therefore suggest that as
there are only 50,000 Option Shares in the present issue, YOU LOSE NO TIME IN FORWARDING
FOUR APPLICATION ON THE FORM ENCLOSED.
