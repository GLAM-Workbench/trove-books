RESOLUTIONS
Passed at a General Meeting of Subscribers holden within the Walls of
St. Andrew’s Cathedral, on Tuesday, the 2nd March, 1858.
HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL in the chair.
Moved by the Lord Bishop of Sydney,
Seconded by Sir A. Stephen, Knt.:—
1. That the Report now read be adopted and printed.
Moved by John Campbell, Esq.,
Seconded by the Rev. George King:—
2. That independently of all other considerations effecting us as a religious
community, the great and increasing number of persons visiting Sydney from
the Interior, and of strangers arriving here from other countries, to whom the
Cathedral will always be open, and who have no other Church accommodation,
renders it peculiarly a duty to complete this noble structure without delay.
Moved by Sir William Burton, Knt.,
Seconded by R. M. Isaacs, Esq:—
3. That this Meeting, recognising that duty, and regarding the object as most
important, pledges itself to renewed efforts in order to complete, if possible, the
roof of the building within the present year.
Moved by T. W. Smith, Esq.,
Seconded by W. T. Cape, Esq.:—
4. That the Committee he requested to re-organise a plan for the general
canvass of those portions of the City hitherto unvisited ; and this Meeting will
endeavour personally to forward the undertaking.
Moved by the Rev. P. P. Agnew,
Seconded by James S. Dowling, Esq.:—
5. That the thanks of the Meeting be accorded to the Governor-General for
kindly presiding on the occasion.




REPORT.
The Committee for the erection of St. Andrew’s Cathedral congratulate
their friends and supporters on the progress which they have been
enabled to make in the work during the past year, and feel persuaded
from the measure of success which followed their labours in the
endeavour to submit its claims to the attention of the members of the
Church throughout the diocese, that they require only a number of
willing zealous advocates to aid them in their public canvass, in order
to carry out the work to its immediate completion.
After the Annual Meeting of last year, your Committee divided
the City into eight districts,, and apportioned two collectors to each,
with the understanding that they should go round from house to house,
a nd bring the subject personally before all who might be interested in
its progress; and although, from circumstances over which they have no
control, the canvass was but very partially carried into effect—not more
than one-fourth of the City having been perfectly traversed by the
collectors —yet was their success of such a nature as to warrant them
in the hope that this mode of collecting, if fully pursued, would soon
crown their labours with success.
To the gentlemen who devoted themselves in earnest to this labour
of love, the Committee return their most grateful thanks ; and they
have now the satisfaction of reporting that .£1095 were added to their
funds within five months, through the personal exertions of those kind
friends.
Your Committee desire to invite particular attention to this scheme,
with the hope that fresh volunteers may come forward to strengthen
their hands, in order to work it out effectually.
Your Committee accepted tenders for two several contracts during
the past year for the completion of the clerestory walls, inclusive of the
three gables, which have been fully executed; thus preparing the


building as far as to the western towers for the erection of the roof;
and they confidently expect that the Quinquennial Fund contributions
which will become due in June next, with a few donations from
private friends, will suffice to complete the stone work. They, there-
fore, now appeal to the Members of the Church at large for means to
enable them to roof in the building, and to prepare it for the celebration
of Divine worship, and they are not without a hope that the friends
who have so long laboured with them in this good cause, will renew
their efforts during the present year, and enable them to bring this great
work to perfection.
The Quinquennial Fund closes with the present year, but it is hoped
that the subscribers will continue their annual contributions for three
years longer, to enable the Committee to furnish the internal fittings,
and to erect a suitable gate and fence for the front entrance.
The claims which this Cathedral possesses upon our special regard
are manifold and important. Whether we regard it parochially, stand-
ing, as it does, in the midst of a dense population, where Church
accommodation is much required; or more extensively, as inviting
within its spacious walls the traveller and stranger who may sojourn
amongst us ; or, nationally, as our Metropolitan Church, with all its
hallowed Cathedral services, it must be regarded in every way as
worthy of a large share of attention and support from every member of
the Church of England, not only in Sydney, but throughout the colony.
