Introduction
SHUT YOUR EYES and think of war-time Australia for a
moment. Think of ships unloading guns and 'planes and
tanks instead of peace-time clothing . . . hundreds of thousands
of men and women making munitions instead of luxury goods
. . . textile workers speeding up production of military clothing
to meet Service requirements . . . dwindling supplies of clothing
in retail stores.
Do you get the picture? On the one hand . . , millions
ot people—industrial workers, office workers, housewives,
children—-all with the same needs as in peacetime; on the
other hand ... a serious shortage of supplies.
WAR BROUGHT THIS POSITION TO AUSTRALIA. We met it
by introducing rationing -a scheme carefully planned to ensure
that we all get a fair share of available supplies—that no one
section goes without while others get more than they need.
Of course rationing cannot INCREASE supplies. All it can
do is to see that hardships brought about by the war are shared
by all. IT SEES THAT EVERYONE'S MINIMUM NEEDS ARE
SUPPLIED.
Maybe your coupons don't go as far as you thought they
would. Maybe you're wondering just how you're going to
get over the rationing year.
Well, this is where WE CAN HELP YOU. We can't gel your
coupons back, but we can help you to help yourselves and
the nation at the same time.
Those outdated coats and (rocks you’ve got slowed away
somewhere—wouldn't you like to be able fo turn them into
smart outfits for yourself - -and the children?
WELL, START RIGHT NOW. Ransack those drawers and cup-
boards for discarded clothing. Unpick the seams and cut
\ yourself a new garment. Go on. Don't be afraid to start.
•Axi
2) You’ll make a few mistakes at first. That s inevitable,
z But when you've got the knack- and there's nothing to it
really—you'll be delighted at the saving ot money and
coupons and thrilled at seeing ATTRACTIVE NEW GARMENTS
GROW OUT OF THE OLD.


Conti
When cutting an old
garment always use a
reliable pattern you know
will fit.

★ YOU ARE DOING MORE THAN JUST RENOVATING—
★ YOU ARE HELPING THE WAR EFFORT.

To-day we are fighting for our

It is vital to the United Nations'
cause that Australia be held.
I It can only be held if Australia
[wages total war.
f Our gallant fighting men are making
unparalleled sacrifices to drive a
relentless enemy back from our shores.
Our factory workers are making prodi-
gious efforts in the battle for
production,
YOU must back them up I
YOU must make the Domestic Front
Australia's Second Front!
YOU can save vast quantities of
material and manpower by plying the
needle and thread at home. Patch
and mend, darn and sew. Let your
watchword be: "Everything for the

Will Australian women do less

YOU must give your answer without
reservation, because the word now is
MUST.

THE YOUNG MAN WHO BOUGHT THIS SUIT IS NOW

THE BATTLEFIELD, HIS SISTER PLAYS HER PART ON THE
HOME FRONT BY USING EVERY MEANS TO CONSERVE
MATERIALS AND MANPOWER. IT MAY SEEM SACRILEGE

HOME HOWITZERS
1. WHEN CUFFS OF A MAN'S PULLOVER become worn, cut them off and sew on
the lops of a pair of socks as near to matching as possible.
2. CORSETS ARE PREClOUS— rubber is scarce —so, when you wash them, never
dry them near a fire and never try to iron them. Before washing, open metal
clips and suspenders.
3. ALTERNATE THE WEARING OF CLOTHES. The life of clothes can be almost
doubled if they are not worn consistently day after day.
4. A DASH OF VINEGAR or pinch of salt in rinsing water when RED materials
are washed will prevent the colour from running.
5. POLISHING SHOES WITH A DAMP CLOTH instead of a dry one will result
in a brighter shoe and a saving of polish.
6. KEEP THE NECKLINE OF FROCKS FREE FROM POWDER and residue of face-
creams. Unless removed, these particles create a point of wear.
7. DAMP AND RUB PERSPIRATION STAINS with lemon juice before washing.
Otherwise soap sets the stain.
8. PATCHES MARK THE PATRlOT —patch garments which are rubbed by braces,
suspenders or fastenings and reinforce worn or wearing spots, e.g., inside
elbows, under pocket corners.
9. MAKE A PAIR OF NEW GLOVES if you find them essential from two old pairs,
one gone at fingertips, and the other at hand and wrist. Gloves of different
colours can be used with smart effect.
10. STUFF WET SHOES WITH CRUMPLED PAPER and dry them away from direct
heat. When dried too fast shoes shrink and become hard, tight and out of
shape.
11. A NEAT WAY TO LENGTHEN
CHILDREN'S PYJAMAS is to knit an
extension on to the material, using odd
pieces of wool for winter pyjamas and
crochet cotton for summer.
