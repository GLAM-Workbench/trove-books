BRISBANE
"DRISBANE, capita! of Queensland,
has the largest metropolitan
area of anv Australian capital city.
It is the centre of a State which is
widely active in commerce, industry,
agriculture and tourism. The State
itself has been called “the most
successful experiment of white
settlement in the tropics to be seen
anywhere in the world.”
Brisbane is outside the tropical
zone, geographically. But it has a
semi-tropical climate which, com-
paratively free from humidity in
summer, and mild and pleasant in
winter, is one of its most attractive
features and greatly encourages all
forms of outdoor relaxation through-
out the year. It has a number of
excellent hotels, some fine shopping
centres, and is becoming more and
more the headquarters of a State
which is, among other things, a vast
playground for people from all over
Australia and from other parts of
the world as well.
Conscious of the special advan-
tages and disadvantages of its
climate, Queensland has developed a
style of living which makes for
enjoyment of its position. Its
domestic architecture has long been
planned to offset heat and to safe-
guard against tropical dampness;
dress, working hours, and the whole
tempo of life, are developed to har-
monise with fine, warm days.

prises within the metropolitan limits
over five hundred square miles ol
city, suburban residential areas, and
their small business centres. The
city business area, with its wider
streets and lower buildings, gives a
first impression of spaciousness, airi-
ness and light. The city area_forms,
roughly, a square, each side of
which is 25 miles long, and which
is cut across by the Brisbane River
The centre of this square is occupied
by the city of Brisbane proper,
THE CITY HALL
The true heart of the city is its
splendid City Hail, a freestone
building which occupies more than
two acres of land, with a frontage
of 297 feet and a clock tower that
raises its head for 302 feet above
the street. This Hall, the audi-
torium of which will seat 2,000
people, has been acclaimed as the
finest civic centre in Australia, and
provides the observation post from
which to gain a bird’s eye view of
the city. The observation platform,
which is usiially open to the public,
is 250 feet up the clock tower, and
immediately above the dials of the
dock. From the platform, which is
io|; miles from the shores of
Moreton Bay, a magnificent pano-
rama of the whole city may be
shewed.
Perhaps the first and most
striking impression from this view
is the manner in which the Brisbane
River bisects the city, providing a,
waterway for commercial purposes
and tourist activities alike, and
making Brisbane a city of bridges.
The oldest of these is the. Victoria
Bridge, which links the principal
street. Queen Street, with the com-
mercial centre of South Brisbane; it
also carries the main tramline for
communication between both sides
of the city. The Grey Street Bridge,
and the modern Storey Bridge, on


either side ol the old Victoria
Bridge, provide main links with the
arterial roads leading to the residen-
tial areas.
The next point to impress itself
as one surveys Brisbane from the
City Hall tower, is that this city
is practically surrounded by park-
land —or, since the city proper actu-
ally occupies so large an area, that
the business centre of the city is
surrounded by parkland. Down at
the river’s edge, only ten minutes
easy walking from the City Hall,
one finds the Botanical Gardens and
the Domain. In the opposite direc-
tion, and just above the Roma
Street markets, lie Albert Park and
Victoria Park, which between them
comprise a green belt extending
from the city to the Queensland
National Museum, some two miles
away.
Close into the heart of the city,
also, lie two Squares—the broad,
sunny King George Square onto
which the City Hall opens, and the
smaller Anzac Square near the cen-
tral railway station, in which one
may sit on park benches on the
grass within sight of the everlasting
Same which burns always in the
war memorial.
When one comes down from the
observation tower and begins to move
about the busy centre of Brisbane,
the main impression is one of com-
pactness. The main city streets bisect
at right angles, giving square blocks
of buildings; the streets which run
parallel with the main street,
Queen, are named after female
Royal personages —Anne, Adelaide,
Elizabeth, Charlotte, etc., while
those which bisect them are named
after kings: William, George, Albert,
Edward, etc. There is some logic,
too, in the disposition of the mam
buildings, and the Government
offices, beginning with the imposing
Parliament House which stands
overlooking the Botanical Gardens,
they are grouped along William and
George Streets to the Queen Street
intersections where the Treasury
stands. The main commercial
houses and big stores are grouped
along Queen Street and in adjoin-
ing streets, and following this main
thoroughfare all the way through
to The Valley, one sees a parade
of Brisbane’s business life.
The finest residential areas of the
city are within a very short distance
of its business heart; fifteen or
twenty minutes by tram or train
serves to transport the traveller
from the centre of the city to the
choicest home areas.
The fine new University of which
Queensland has every right to be
extremely proud, is situated on the
quiet upper reaches of the river at
St. Lucia, which is only some half
hour from the city, but is quite
removed from distraction, providing
at once a quiet and beautiful but
readily accessible centre of learning,
the architecture of which is the


most modern and most artistic, in
many people’s view, of any in Aus-
tralia, if not in the Southern
Hemisphere.
There is about Brisbane an air
of leisureliness which is completely
deceptive; but the lack of bustle
probably stems from the fact that
less than one-third of Queens-
land’s population live within the
limits of the capital. In this respect
the Northern State is unique; but it
has developed over the years a de-
centralised system of railways which
has led to its having smaller but
more numerous cities than the other
States of the Commonwealth, and
spreading its population more thinly
but more evenly over its territory.
CITY OF SUNSHINE
Brisbane, in its design, and in
its colourful vegetation, is a tropical
city: but it is the most moderate
climate of any Queensland city, be-
ing farthest south. It has in winter
an average of 630 hours of sunshine
(other Australian cities are said to
have: Melbourne 569 and Sydney
597) and 45 inches of rain a year.
This situation and climate have
made Brisbane the Mecca of winter
holiday-makers, who can enjoy
Spring in Winter by travelling
north: and who find that they can
bathe and enjoy the sunshine when
* places farther south are experiencing
* cold conditions. In summer Bris-
bane is hot but not humid. The
fact that the city lies some 30 miles
inland from the sea protects it from
the moist and muggy conditions
which add to the discomfort of
many Australian summer climates.
By far the most common means
of public transport through Bris-
bane is the tramway, which spreads
a network through the city and its
environs, and which operates a
unique system of carrying each ser-
vice from one boundary right
through the heart of the city and
out to the other boundary, instead
of taking its trams to a central city
terminal. Thus it is possible to step
on a tram on one side of the city,
travel through the residential areas,
through the heart of the business
centre, and out to residential areas
on the other side. The system has
made the transport frequent, cheap,
and efficient, and considerably
facilitates the movements of visitors
who wish to see as much as possible
in a limited time.
The train services have two dis-
tinct terminals: interstate and south-
bound trains leave from the South
Brisbane station, on the south side
of the river, while local and north-
bound trains terminate at Central
Station, on Anne Street, on the
northern side of the river. There
is no train link at all between the
two sides of the city, this com-
munication being maintained by
tram and by supplementary omnibus
services. Brisbane also enjoys ex-
cellent taxi service.
It is important for the visitor to
Brisbane to remember that, if he be
going to a southern resort such as
Southport, he must travel to South
Brisbane Station by road to take
the train: there are cases on record
of people who have grown old wait-
ing at Central Station for a train
to Southport.


Eagle Farm and Archerfield are
the two main airports in Brisbane,
both of which are modern and well-
equipped and capable of receiving
and accommodating the largest
planes.
Because of its geographical situa-
tion and general suitability, all
commercial planes now operate
from Eagle Farm. It is expected
to become one of the greatest of
Australia’s international airfields.
Redland Bay, situated approxi-
mately 24 miles from the city, is the
seaplane base for Brisbane.
Although Brisbane is bisected by
a river, it has no regular ferry
passenger services; it does have,
however, numerous beautiful water
trips both up and down the river,
on comfortable small launches which
have interesting itineraries of the
river resorts and Moreton Bay
Islands.
For the motorist Brisbane offers
few traffic complications, and good
roads, with some steep hills. Park-
ing in the business area is restricted,
and there are few special rules, one
important one being that a U-turn
mav not be made between inter-
sections. There are automatic traffic
lights on the principal intersections
which greatly facilitate the flow of
traffic, and there are numerous
roads out of the city, the only three
crowded points, even at peak, being
the bridge crossings.
Out of the city towards Archer-
field there is a resort known as The
Oasis which is extremely beautiful.
It is a privately developed botanical
garden comprising also swimming
pools, a bird collection, magnificent
floral displays, and outdoor refresh-
ment services. For some it is a
playground; for others it is a place
of restful relaxation; for every
visitor it is a place worth seeing and
enjoying. Another favoured resort
near the city is Lone Pine, a reserve
built on high banks above the tran-
quil river, secluded among a wealth
of growth, shady, cool and peaceful.
It may be reached either by road
or by launch on the river, and is
an ideal day, or even afternoon, trip
during the week-end.

cliff, Scarborough, Wynnum, Man-
ley, all of which serve as week-end
resorts for Brisbane people, who
swim and fish there, indulge in boat-
ing, surf-board riding, surfing, and
sunbathing.
Horse-racing is very popular, and
there are three major race courses
at Albion Park, Eagle Farm and
Hamilton, where a very high
standard of horse-racing is seen.
In fact, the carefree Queens-
landers love a gamble: their legalised
lottery, the Golden Casket, is a
prominent part of life there, and
almost every city corner has its
“Casket Shop” where tickets, c-r
shares in tickets, in the great lottery
may be purchased.
Sooner or later, any visitor to
Brisbane will go to Mount Coot-
tha, also known as “One Tree
Hill,” a lofty height which, rising
behind the lovely suburb of
Toowong, dominates the landscape
for many miles around. Here,
by, daylight, guided by the brass
plate on its pedestal on the
highest point of the hill, the
features of Brisbane itself and the
surrounding country for fifty miles,
may be seen; the view from this
eminence by night is one of great
beauty, for the whole city lies
spread out like a diamond-studded
carpet, and impresses, once again,
the greatness of this semi-tropical
city’s widespread area.
BACKWARD GLANCE
Today Queensland is important
for many reasons: gold put it on the
map; cattle have made it rich; its
tropical fruits —especially pineapple,
pawpaw, mango, bananas, sugar-
cane—and peanuts are ranked as
the finest in the world; its fishing is
as lush and wealthy as only tropica!
fishing can be; its prawns are among
the world’s biggest and are air-
freighted daily, in special refrigera-
tion planes, throughout Australia; it
has established a whaling industry.
(A special article on this industry
can be found on Page 38.)
Yet this is the youngest of all
the Australian States, for, though
Brisbane itself is an old settlement,
it remained part of New South
Wales for many years.
The city was founded in 1824 as
a penal colony and named after
the then Governor of New South
Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane; it was
regarded as a town of that State
until, in 1859, it became capital ol
the new colony of Queensland.
Then, and for very many years-
almost within the last decade —
Brisbane was hampered by disas-
trous floods when, periodically, the
river burst its banks. It was not
until 1932 that the Government
decided that it could solve two diffi-
culties with one great solution, and
commenced to build the vast
Somerset Dam across the Stanley
River Valley, some 80 miles above
Brisbane. The Dam was designed
to secure a permanent and adequate
water supply to the city through
dry summer periods and, at the
same time, to store the water which
formerly raced down the Stanley
Valley to swell the Brisbane River
and inundate the town.
The early history of Brisbane is
colourful and in spots romantic.
For the site of the city was actually
discovered by a shipwrecked sailor
named Thomas Pamphlet. This man
was a cedar-getter from the Illa-
warra District of the South Coast
of N.S.W., who had put to sea at
Sydney in a small craft which he
intended to sail south to Wollon-
gong. He and his three companions
sailed on March 23, 1823, and were
within eight miles of their destina-
tion, well south of Sydney, when a
gale-sprang up. For nineteen days
they were tossed around in the
stormy sea, out of sight of land and
in a sorry plight. Then they saw land.

but were washed to sea again, and
on April 12, twenty-one days out,
they again saw land. They landed
in the afternoon of that day on an
island where natives received them.
Without any idea of where they
were, and unable to gain informa-
tion from the natives, they lived
with the aborigines along the shores
until they lost count of time. Finally
a boat of white men came ashore—
then Pamphlet learned that the day
was November 29, and that he was
in Moreton Bay, five hundred miles
by sea north of Sydney, instead of
being, as he hoped, about fifty miles
south. The white man who had dis-
covered him was the Government
Surveyor, John Oxley, looking for
the site of a new penal settlement.
Oxley, having met Pamphlet, pro-
ceeded to examine the “bay” and
discovered it to be the wide mouth
of a river. He named this the
Brisbane River, and travelled up it
until he found and named the site
where the city of Brisbane now
stands. Within a year the first
settlement was made —not up the
river, but near the river mouth at
Humpy Bong; soon afterwards, how-
ever, it was transferred up-river tc
the present site of the city.
The earliest days of Brisbane’s
settlement were marked by two
bloody circumstances: the cunning
and relentless skirmishes between
white men and black, which were
more savage here than anywhere in
Australia, and the vicious and in-
humane discipline exercised over the
convict population. Selected as an
outpost gaol, Brisbane lived up to
its official status with a vengeance
and when, in 1849, the trans-
portation of convicts to N.S.W. was
supposed to have ceased, extra ship-
loads of prisoners arrived, they
were handed on from Melbourne to
Sydney and from Sydney to Bris-
bane, and were dispersed among
the small settlements around More-
ton Bay, where shortage, of labour
was a bar to progress.
It was due to the strenuous work
of Dr. Dunrrfore Lang, who spent
three years in England organising
the emigration of suitable settlers,
that Brisbane finally ceased to be a
convict settlement, and became the
capital of a separate Colony. The
free settlers who came to Brisbane
at Lang’s instigation, opened their
farms in the land behind Brisbane;
one of the ships that brought them,
the Fortitude, leaves its name today
on Fortitude Valley, which is now
part of the city of Brisbane and is
generally called “The Valley.” This
immigration was followed by the
separation of Queensland as a
separate colony—and when it was
accorded that status in 1859 it
began its career with sevenpence
halfpenny in its Colonial Treasury,
and it was seven years before that
situation changed appreciably. Then
it was the announcement one morn-
ing of a man named Nash that he
had discovered gold at Gympie, that
gave Queensland its first real im-
petus.
GOLD STRIKE
Nine years earlier an announced
discovery of gold on the Fitzroy
River had proved disastrous to the
prospectors, but out of the ruins
of that disappointment grew the
now prosperous city of Rockhamp-
ton. The richness of the discovery
at Gympie gave the entire Colony
zest; it founded the city of Gympie;
the gold rush to Charters Towers
helped stabilise the port of Towns-
ville; and the great discovery of
the three Morgan brothers in 1882,
that a hill of ironstone in the Fitz-
roy Valley was shot through with
gold, turned out to be the most im-
portant gold-strike in Australia; in
four and a half years the Mount
Morgan mine paid four and a half
million pounds in dividends.

Queensland had this to mark it
off from the other Australian
colonies: it was a tropical settle-
ment. The outbreak of the Ameri-
can Civil War in 1861 led to the
founding of its cotton industry, and
its first prospect of earning a place
for itself was in endeavouring to
build a cotton trade; the end of the
Civil War and the reappearance of
American cotton on the English
market, however, put a stop to
Queensland’s cotton development;
but the idea of tropical crops there
had taken root, and the next tropi-
cal crop in line was sugar. The first
plantings showed how successfully
sugar could be grown in Queens-
land, and side by side with the rich
gold strikes there developed agri-
cultural gold, in the successful and
ever-increasing crops of sugar,
which since then have become the
moneyspinner of Northern Queens-
land.
NOW THERE ARE CITIES
It is easy to see from this back-
ward glance at the factors which
made Queensland, why its activities
are spread over a very large tract
of territory, why it has numerous
small cities. The cities of Queens-
land, mainly on the coast, arc
twelve in number, including Bris-
bane. The others arc:
All of these cities are important
centres of production and transpor-
tation, and share between them the
full length of the Queensland coast.
It is interesting to note that the
famous Thursday Island, with a
population of something over 1,000,
is a town of Queensland.
The development of sugar and
cotton and grazing, in particular,
and the increase in tobacco produc-
tion in recent years, have combined
to make Queensland a busy
and a wealthy State; but the fact
that its coastline is spotted with
cities, that its population is spread,
and that it has many natural
beauties on the mainland and the
world-wonder Great Barrier Reef
at its seaboard, has made it rich in
another aspect. With every passing
year Queensland becomes more and
more a favoured tourist place, and
a more and more popular holiday
resort. Being a place of great
variety, offering every kind of at-
traction in addition to a climate
which is virtually winter-free, it is
rapidly becoming the playground of
Australia. Its leisurely wav of life,
and many of its local institutions,
including the opening of hotels to
the public until ten o’clock in the
evening, help give it the background
which assists enjoyable holiday-
making.
Whether the visitor to Queens-
land wishes to spend a few days in
Brisbane or to venture further north
into the tropics, Queensland offers
fun on every hand. The fact that
it is light on nightclubs and the
usual forms of city entertainment
(apart from cinemas) is not even
registered by the-crowd of tourists
who find everything from sight-
seeing and fishing to all-the-year
bathing, and a host of novel occupa-
tions.
From the N.S.W. border to Bris-
bane, the Queensland South Coast
is sprinkled with delightful beaches
such as Coolangatta, Currumbin,
Burleigh Heads, Southport, Surfers’
Paradise, where the beaches are big.

clean and wide, the tides gentle,
and the water always warm; north
of Brisbane, from Redcliffe up as
far as Gympie, stretch the resorts
of Caloundra, Mooloolaba, Alex-
andra Heads, Coolum, Noosa,
Double Island Point, and Tin Can
Bay.
Through the north run the
Blackall Ranges like a tremendous
backbone; here are to be seen such
famous and fascinating sights as the
Glasshouse Mountains, named by
Captain Cook because of their re-
semblance to the great glass furnaces
of his native Whitby; and here are
the double attractions of exotic
tropical growth adding romance to
the landscape, and game fish wait-
ing to create excitement for any-
body with enough enterprise to get
a boat.
FUN ON EVERY HAND
Mooloolaba is a base from which
big-game fishermen can operate
without unduly exposing themselves
to danger, and is still only some 60
miles from Brisbane by rail and
a connecting motor coach. And
farther on at Noosa Head, which
is 80 miles from Brisbane, is the
famous Golden Beach, with its
unique possibilities of driving along
the hard ocean beach to Teewah,
where there are about fourteen
different coloured sands exhibited in
300-fect-high cliffs. From Noosa
Head, also, there arc launch services
operating to Tewantin, where it is
possible to make trips on charming
and picturesque lakes.
The entire coast along which
these playgrounds are situated is a
panoramic picture of semi-tropical
splendour, “the Fruit Garden of
Queensland,” where the southern-
most of the Queensland cane fields
are to be seen, and where pineapple,
pawpaw, citrus crops, and an abun-
dance of tropical plantations make
a rich and exotic landscape. Farther
inland and a little to the south lies
Maleny, the centre of a fertile
dairying district, and an attractive
place for the motorist, who can
drive through the Blackall Ranges
on splendid roads, winding through
tall forests, palm groves, and out
on to razorbacks looking down upon
the terraced hillsides away to the
coast.
As Maleny, Nambour, and the
other towns of this territory offer,
in common with the coastal resorts,
facilities for all sports, good hotel
accommodation, and a combination
of beauty and activity which is
unique, the entire district is be-
coming an increasingly popular
holiday resort.
All of these areas are within a
hundred miles of Brisbane, to the
north; striking out from the capital
to the west, one comes easily to the
heights of Toowoomba, where the
bracing climate is in contrast with
the warmer conditions of Brisbane
itself, and from which a wide
variety of pleasant scenic tours may
be made of beautiful, fertile and
gentle plain country.
While these beauty spots and in-
terests are waiting for vacationists,
Brisbane offers generously for the
business visitor who has perhaps
only a day or two of the week-end
in which to relax. This is where
the Brisbane River comes into its
own, with its restful launch trips
up-river to Lone Pine reserve, and
its day-trips down across Moreton
Bay to Bribie Island and other
places of interest. It is also possible,
now, for visitors to see the whaling
station recently established at
Moreton Island, and thus enjoy a
unique and thrilling experience
within three hours of the city itself.
There are, too, the day-trips to
beaches and fishing grounds near
Brisbane, at Sandgate, Manlev,
Scarborough, Redcliffe, Wynnum,
and similar places.

FARTHER AFIELD
Undoubtedly the greatest single
attraction Queensland has to offer
is the Great Barrier Reef (a more
extensive article appears on page
33). It is perhaps the most fas-
cinating of all playgrounds for the
planned vacation, combining unique
and beautiful scenery with romantic
island resorts, exciting big-game
fishing, day and night swimming,
and the most balmy of all climates.
Many of the islands of the
Barrier are accessible to holiday-
makers, offering good accommoda-
tion, excellent food, and a carefree
freedom which is often said to be
obtained in no other way. Here,
really remote from the world, amid
exceptional beauties, a new world
of leisure and pleasure opens up.
The details of the places and their .
offerings are too numerous to be
listed in any single survey, but are
readily available on enquiry, and
with the ready accessibility of the
mainland bases by air travel, a holi-
day in these surroundings becomes
a quick and easy matter for any-
body who cares to go. Indeed, air
travel has made all the difference
here; for where formerly days of
travelling overland ate up vacation
time before the destination was
reached, it is now possible to arrive
at any of these islands within 24
hours from Melbourne or Sydney,
to make the most of a long vacation.
Every type of entertainment, in-
cluding seeing the tropical seabed
through the glass bottom of a
specially constructed boat, combines
to make this a time of fascinating
interest as well as of carefree fun.
Comfortable guest houses, modern
hotels, luxurious cabin cruisers are
available in many parts of the
Queensland coast and assist the
tourist to enjoy to the full his stay
in what has been termed a “holiday-
maker’s paradise.”

GENERAL INFOR MA T ION
AIR TRAVEL: Brisbane's an
terminal is at Eagle Farm. Over-
seas and interstate aircraft arrive
and depart here; so do various air
lines linking various parts of the
large State with the capital. Air
travel has done much to make
Queensland holiday resorts and
Barrier Reef trips easily accessible
to visitors. There are many splendid
tropical holidays available in this
way.
CHURCHES: Brisbane has fine
churches in the heart of the city,
and the services at these are listed
in the press. The leading churches
of various religious groups are listed
on page 23.
CITY HALL: A lookout open to
the public is situated in the clock
tower of this fine civic centre. The
City Hall also houses the Art Gal-
lery, which is open to the public
throughout the week.
CONCERTS and other entertain-
ment programmes are regularly held
at the Albert Hall. It is always
worth while finding out what the
current programme is at this hall,
which is situated in Albert Street
near the Roma Street station.
LIQUOR: In Queensland liquor
may be sold, and hotels are open,
until 10 p.m.
LOTTERIES; The Queensland
Golden Casket is a big-prize lottery
drawn at least once a week. Not
only whole tickets, but shares in
tickets, arc purchaseable, and there
are very many agencies throughout
the city and suburbs.
MAILS: Letters may be addressed
c/- G.P.0., Queen Street, Brisbane,
and collected by visitors who are
passing through or uncertain of
their temporary address in Brisbane
MONEY; Exchange rates may be
obtained and the exchange of cur-
rency and the despatch of money
may be arranged from the Common-
wealth Bank Head Office, Queen
Street, Brisbane, almost next door
to the G.P.O.
MOTORING: Parking restric-
tions in the city area must be care-
fully observed; in the city area no
turn may be made between inter-
sections; the vehicle must proceed
to the intersection and turn there;
traffic lights are installed at prin-
cipal intersections; the speed limit
of 30 miles an hour is enforced;
there are good roads out of Brisbane
for motoring trips, and service to
motorists is provided by the Royal
Automobile Club of Queensland.
MUSEUM: The Queensland
National Museum is situated at the
Valley end of Victoria Park and is
most easily approached by car
through Gregory Terrace or by tram

through The Valley. It holds a
particularly fine collection of ex-
hibits and well repays a visit.
POLICE: Headquarters are in
William Street, near the end of the
Victoria Bridge; the Queensland
police are particularly helpful to
visitors. They are assigned to the
duty of regulating pedestrian as
well as motor traffic at peak points.
They are readily available for all
kinds of advice.
RAILWAYS: The distinction be-
tween South Brisbane Station, Stan-
ley Street, South Brisbane, and the
Central Station, Anne Street, City,
must be carefully borne in mind.
Apart from being the terminal for
interstate trains, South Brisbane is
the terminal for trains to South-
port, Beaudesert, and a few southern
destinations. The main body of
Queensland rail traffic clears
through Central, Anne Street, in-
cluding trains to near beaches, such
as Sandgate.
RIVER TRIPS: The wharves
from which launches leave for Bris-
bane River and Moreton Bay ex-
cursions are at the city end of the
Victoria Bridge, near the corner of
Queen and William Streets.
SPORT; Newspapers offer a full
indication of the variety of sport to
be enjoyed in Brisbane; the main
race courses are at Hamilton, Eagle
Farm, Albion Park and Doomben;
there are some fine public golf links
in the vicinity of the city; bowling
greens always welcome visitors;
there is a stadium where boxing
may regularly be seen. Fishing
resorts within easy distance of Bris-
bane are many, with good boating
readily available; main surfing
beaches are some distance from
Brisbane itself, but a number of
centres have river bathing and
municipal baths.
TAXIS: The taxi service in Bris-
bane is exceptionally good, and
may be relied upon. Fares are a
little higher than in most Aus-
tralian capitals; radio taxis are in
service.
TIPPING: Overseas visitors will
find that tipping is generally ac-
cepted throughout Australia in
hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and
theatres, and if any assistance is
required in respect to correct
charges in this direction, the “ten
per cent” common on the Continent
is as good a basis as any other.
However, it should be pointed
out that many organisations dis-
courage tipping. T.A.A., 8.G.P.A.,
8.0.A.C. and Qantas, for instance,
do not permit their personnel to
accept tips for services provided.
TELEPHONES: The telephones
are available throughout the city in
numerous public booths; numerous
telephone services such as time-of-
day, wake-up calls, and Enquiry
Section are maintained to all sub-
scribers; trunk-line calls are quickly
made. Most Queensland resort
guest-houses gladly accept telephone
bookings.
TOURIST ACT I V ITIES:
Queensland is very largely a tourist
State. Not only the Great Barrier
Reef, but numerous lovely districts
of sporting enjoyment and natural
beauty, offer unique and un-
paralleled vacations. Consequently
Brisbane is fully equipped to cater
for tourists; the Government Tourist
Bureau is in Adelaide Street, on the
corner of Anzac Square, very close
to Central Station; there arc numer-
ous tourist and travel agencies and
services throughout the city, pro-
vided by air lines, in conjunction
with hotels, and in other ways.

THE GREAT BARRIER REEF
Nowhere in the world docs
Nature duplicate that wonderful
phenomenon which has made a
place of beauty for Queensland’s
tropical playground the Great
Barrier Reef, a magnificent natural
structure of coral. Coral is found
in almost every part of the world:
so are reefs. But no casual refer-
ence to the size or beauty of
Queensland’s great reef can convey
any idea of its magnificence. It is
about 1,200 miles long, stretching
from Fraser Island to the Torres
Strait. The very name of Fraser
Island conveys the dark side of the
picture, for this place takes its name
from the captain of the ship
Stirling Castle, which was wrecked
there; and truly in the past the
Barrier Reef has been a graveyard
of ships, the scene of memorable
wrecks and great tragedies.
That, however, is past. Today,
through vast areas of the reef, it
presents a picture of numerous
islands covered in vegetation, with
a deep blue tropical sea woven be-
tween them in a series of channels.
Of these islands none are better
known than the Cumberland
Islands, which have a deep water,
easily navigable passage giving
access to them. It is in this vicinity
that the famous Daydream Island
is to be found; and this is one of
the most popular of the reef islands
for vacationing. The islands seen
from the famous Whitsunday Pas-
sage, and its famous counterpart,
the Hinchinbrook Channel, rise
steeply from the sea, forest-clad,
and inviting, with strips of gleam-
ing beach and picturesque hillsides
There is little about them to sug-
gest that they are founded upon the
minute skeletons of million upon
million coral polyps. However, sur-
rounding these stately islands are
reefs which, only a short distance
below the surface, provide all the
variety of tropical sea life and show
to the full the loveliness of coral
formations in the marine stage.
These reefs provide one of the most
fascinating of all Barrier Reef
sights, for they are viewed through
the glass bottoms of specially con-
structed boats. Beautifully coloured
fish moving in an underwater
garden—and the occasional octopus
or groper to lend a touch of realism
to the otherwise fairyland, picture —
thus seen they offer an experience to
be had nowhere else in the world.
Some of the islands near the
mainland are not coral formations
at all, but the peaks of mountains

which were once part of the main-
land, left standing above the water
as, with the passage of long ages of
time, the coastline has gradually
sunk under the sea.
But these islands, too, lie close
to the reef, which follows the coast-
line, and topographically are re-
garded as part of it. The landscape
they offer differs in some ways from
that of the coral islands, and helps
to provide that infinite variety
which has made the name of the
reef famous.
SEA-GOING TURTLES
The coral itself stretches some
forty miles to sea from the main-
land, and much of it is flat, low-
lying, and to be distinguished from
the islands of the reef, these flat
landings are known as cays. It
would be wrong to think' that be-
cause they are low, flat and barren,
they lack interest. These cays are,
first of all, the home of the green
turtles. These are sea-going but
they deposit their eggs on the cays,
and the mother forms her nest in
the fine coral sand with her front
flippers to deposit at one time about
120 eggs. When the eggs have been
laid, the mother covers them with
sand, flattens the sand over them,
and moves off, her part of mother-
hood having been so easily accom-
plished. The sun is now responsible
for hatching the eggs; and the tiny
turtles burrow' up through the sand
and assume responsibility for them-
selves from then on, making their
own way to sea for the first time,
swimming instinctively.
De Rougement, who got the
name for being the “Greatest Liar
on Earth,” was the first man to
draw attention to the natural won-
ders of the Barrier Reef, but he did
it by such picturesque over-
statements as claiming that he him-
self rode on the back of giant
turtles.

The turtles hardly offer a ride to
the tourist, but they certainly offer
a variety of interests, and are
hunted to make delicious soup,
though the meat itself is not par-
ticularly valuable. Turtle eggs, too,
may be found and eaten with
pleasure.
There are many other facets of
interest which make a visit to at
least one coral cay a matter of great
importance—yet it is not easy. No
ray, by its nature, can afford ac-
commodation; many of them are a
long way from the nearest accom-
modation, and the business of
reaching them by boat is tricky,
since quick storms can create
serious dangers, and the rise and
fall of the tide is sufficient to sub-
merge large areas of coral which at
low tide become interesting places
for a walk, but within a few hours
are savage traps for even small
boats, as they lie just beneath the
surface of the water.
The most accessible of these cays
is Heron Island, in the Capricorn
group, which is easily accessible,
and which exhibits all the wonders
of the farther and more treacherous
cays. The place derives its name
from the magnificent flights of
heron and other birds which are
to be seen there at any time; it is
typical of the Barrier Reef that
bird life is profuse.
FORMATION OF CORAL
The tiny organisms (polyps)
which are responsible for the
creation of coral reefs are in them-
selves a dramatic little story. They
are not “coral insects” as they are
sometimes called; but small as they
arc, they are carnivorous animals
which feed upon even tinier single-
celled animals which abound in the
tropical waters. But though they
are animals and feed on these tiny

cells, the coral polyps grow like
flowers! They develop by shooting
off branches, on the ends of which
are stinging cells, each of which is
a mouth to take in food. This
animal-plant does not suck in its
food —it harpoons it. A tiny thread
with a barbed end is darted out of
the cell-mouth, and fastens to the
passing tiny organism, which is
speared on the point of a barb and
hauled back into the coral cell.
Here it is attached to the main body
of the polyp by a sticky substance,
and is conveyed, as the tentacle
bends, to the mouth, through which
it is eaten.
Such is the coral. And as it is
lumped up in great undersea reefs,
It is living coral—a great colony of
these microscopic polyps, eating
away as it grows, and looking
through the bottom of your glass-
bottomed boat you are seeing no
rock formation, but a mass of mil-
lions of these curious living animals,
growing like plants, feeding upon
the tiny organisms of the sea. It is
a point not often enough appreci-
ated that these great coral masses
are living, feeding, reproducing
animals, in mid-life, at the time they
are viewed by the tourist.
While the coral is feeding, its
beauty is greatly enhanced —and its
sting is real to those who contact
its tiny feelers. It is said that the
coral polyp is related to the blue-
bottle, and that, for its size, its sting
is comparable.
GROWING POPULARITY
Many books have been written
about the fascinating wonders of
coral reefs. To the vacationist the
more practical point is that these
wonders exist and are to be seen.
His opportunities of spending his
holiday among them have vastly-
increased in recent years owing to
the number of resorts opened
throughout the reef country, and
the accessibility of the reef by air
travel which brings it within a day
or two of any part of Eastern
Australia.
The reef may be seen in two
ways: either by staying at a resort,
or by taking a cruise. Both are
ideal holidays, but the permanent
resort proves the more popular with
the majority of people, giving them
every opportunity for combining the
unusual beauties of the reef with
the gaiety and companionship of
normal holiday comforts.
PACIFIC PLAYGROUND
A whole new vista of sport opens
up here as, apart from searching
for turtles and their eggs, and play-
ing the sports which are so well
catered for, there is surf-board
riding, swimming, and unparalleled
opportunities for fishing.
The climate is one which induces
living in swimsuits and light tropi-
cal rig, and though always warm
and balmy, lacks the fierce tropical
heat which so many people dislike.
It is unfortunate that fear of what
are generally called “tropical con-
ditions” has kept so many people
from the Reef, since the entire con-
ception of this type of weather is
wrong. People who have come from
all parts of the world to spend time
along Queensland’s Great Barrier
Reef have hailed the weather as
ideal, and probably the most
steadily enjoyable of weather con-
ditions anywhere in the world.
It is a wonderful thing that such
natural beauty is so situated as to
offer such complete enjoyment, and
the vast expansion which is steadily
taking place in the tourist industry
along the Reef is the best indication
of how warmly Australians art
taking to this, one of the greatest
natural playgrounds in the world.

WHALING-A NEW INDUSTRY
A splash of drama was given to
Moreton Bay last year with the
introduction to Moreton Island, in
the mouth of the Bay, of a whaling
station which established one of the
oldest and most dramatic industries
known to man right at Brisbane’s
front door.
Surprise was occasioned by
whaling being attempted in such a
warm climate, whaling being
traditionally {but not quite rightly)
regarded as a cold-water, if not
near-Arctic pursuit. However, the
simple scientific knowledge of the
whale’s life cycle and habits made
Moreton Island an ideal situation
for the station, a fact which was
borne out by the catch of 600
whales in the six months of the
station’s first season.
The site of the station, an island
of fine sand covered with vegeta-
tion, has remained quite uninhabited
except for the lighthouse-keepers
and occasional week-end fishermen
who camp on the island. Wild
horses and wild pigs roam the
undergrowth of the hilly interior,
the pigs being a relic of the early
days when the ordinary domestic
pig was let loose there to provide
food for shipwrecked sailors, the
horses being those turned loose
there by the Army after the last
war, during which time the island
was a military camp.
The building of the station in
this isolated semi-tropical location
was, in itself, a splendid engineering
feat, for the entire plant was
erected and ready to go into
operation in a matter of months-
and this included the erection of a
power station, a processing factory,
and a large concrete-based flensing
deck for the reception and cutting
up of the whales.

1 liree Norwegian whaling vessels
were purchased and attached to the
station under the captaincy of
Norwegian skipper-gunners, it being
traditional in the whaling industry
that the skipper of the ship is also
the gunner. Many of the crew of
the whaling vessels are Norwegians,
but the specialised work of cutting
up or flensing the whale was
rapidly learned to expert pro-
ficiency by Australians.
The island station and the small
fleet of catchers are all linked by an
open-circuit radio system, and the
factory manager orders the whales
according to the demands of the
plant.
Like every other whale station
in the world, the Tangalooma in-
dustry operates under the direction
of a world whaling commission with
headquarters in Norway. This body
supervises the taking of every
whale, to ensure that while an ade-
quate supply of whale products is
released to the world market, the
whale itself will not be in danger
of becoming extinct. The quota for
a season’s catch allotted to Tanga -
loonia by the whaling commission
was five hundred whales; but as
these were taken in record time
and whales were plentiful, the com-
mission allowed an extra hundred
to close the season.
The minimum length of a whale
to be caught is 35 feet; most of
those caught in Moreton Island’s
first season measured about 40 feet
in length, and their weight is
approximately a ton per foot. The
whales are taken by harpoon, to
which an explosive war-head is
attached; when the harpoon hits
the whale it penetrates into the
great body and this war-head ex-
plodes, killing the whale instan-
taneously. The dead whales are
then towed into the island factory
by the chaser that catches them.


As the length and physical con-
dition of the whale at the time of
capture varies considerably, it is
almost impossible to give any
general estimate of the worth of a
whale, and as the giant pressure
cookers process three or four whales
at a time, results are not judged on
the individual whale, but on the
prpgressive total of oil and by-
products.
However, the gross value of
products taken at Tangalooma last
season was in the vicinity of three-
quarters of a million pounds, but
this, again, was governed by the
fact that the price of whale
products was not high on the
market at the time. Nevertheless,
the new industry, in its first season,
turned in a nice profit.
Permits to inspect the whaling
station are obtainable from the
Whale Industries office in Brisbane;
the trip down the bay takes about
three hours.
RACING INFORMATION
The Queensland Turf Club, Head
Office, Q.T.C. Building, 503 Queen
Street, Petrie Bight, controls horse-
racing in Queensland.
The Q.T.C. Eagle Farm (or
Ascot) Racecourse is situated about
four miles from the G.P.0., and is
within easy access of trams, trains
and main roads. Situated at Ascot
in beautiful surroundings of gardens
and shrubs, it caters efficiently for
the comfort and convenience of
patrons attending meetings; the
grass course, is considered one of
the fastest and best in Australia.
The Brisbane Cup, which carries a
prize of £12,000, is run yearly at
Ascot in May. At the same time
that the Brisbane Cup is run, there
is also the Stradbroke Handicap,
which carries prize money to the
value of £lO,OOO.
Race meetings are also held at
two other courses in close proximity
to the City by the Brisbane
Amateur Turf Club, viz., at Doom-
ben on a grass track, and at Albion
Park on the sand track.
Doomben Racecourse is situated
quite close to the Q.T.C. Course
in Nudgee Road, Eagle Farm. It is
readily accessible by train and is
only a short distance from the
Doomben tram terminus.
The Newmarket is run each year
at Doomben in July and carries a
prize money to the value of
£10,500. It is definitely the richest
sprint race held in Australia. Like-
wise in July is run the Doomben
Cup with prize money to the value
of £B,OOO,
Albion Park Racecourse lies in
close proximity to Breakfast Creek
Bridge, just off the Hamilton Road,
and is reached both by tram and
road.
On all the above courses book-
makers operate in the enclosures
and totalisator facilities are pro-
vided.
There is a historic spot in the
Botanic Gardens as it is recorded
that where the present Kiosk is
situated is the point where the first
Brisbane racecourse for steeple-
chases marked the commencement
of the races. The course went
across ditches and fences in Frogs’
Hollow, where today are the sites
of the Town Hall. King George
Square and parts of Roma Street,
and the course ended near the
present G.P.O.
