timber, in the development of secondary industries,
and in the growing of rubber.
For the Man with Small Capital on Government Land?
With �l5O to �2OO a man can start dairying in
a small way, and gradually increase his herd and
operations. A good deal, of course, depends on the
man.
Suppose he had �250 or �300?
He could make an excellent start with that.
Suppose he tried Fruit Growing?
With about �lOO he could make a start. He
could grow vegetables and minor crops until his trees
grew old enough to bear, which would be in about
three years from planting.
What could a Man do without Capital?
He could work for a station-owner or farmer
until he had made enough to pay his deposit on the
land he eventually selects,

How far from the Railway is the Available Land?
Most of the land is not far from existing lines.
The policy of the Government, however, is to build
light railway lines (as feeders to the main lines) to
tap agricultural districts, and to anticipate settlement.
Light Railway Lines Opening Large Areas.
Some of these short lines which it is proposed to
build will open up an immense area of good land.


Crown Lands at Auction.
Crown lands may be acquired in fee-simple by
auction purchase in areas up to 5,120 acres. No limit
to area which may be held by one person.
Price.
The minimum purchasing price for land bought
at auction is 10s. per acre.
Terms of Purchase.

What Assistance does the Government Give the Intending
Settler?

and one set of harness are carried free to the railway
station nearest to his selection.
What Other Assistance?
Special reduced rates are granted for the carriage

What is the Agricultural Bank?
A Government Bank institution established,
primarily, for the purpose of assisting new settlers
and also agriculturists and graziers, to whom it makes
advances on the security of freeholds, licenses, and
leases from the Crown, for the purpose of making
improvements on the land or for paying off liabilities,
at 5 per cent, per annum, repayable in twenty-five
years or at any time at the option of the borrower.
What Security is Required?
The applicant for an advance must give a first
mortgage on his holding. The bank advances 12s. in
the �1 on the total value of the land and improvements.
When is it Repayable?
For the first five years only simple interest is
charged at 5 per cent, per annum. After five years
the borrower must begin to redeem his advance at the
rate of �4 Os. 3d. half-yearly for each �lOO borrowed,
inclusive of interest, until the whole has been paid.
Can the Settler Borrow Money to Buy Stock?
Yes. The Agricultural Bank will advance 12s. in
the �1 of the total value of the land and improvements

dwelling-houses as homes for themselves and their
families. The applicant must show that his income
does not exceed �2OO per annum, and that he is not
the owner of a dwelling-house in Queensland or else-
where.
Freehold Farms.
Plenty of good freehold farms change hands from
time to time in Queensland at from �3 to �2O per acre.
Settlers not desirous of taking up Government land
can easily be suited privately.
What is the Nature of the Soil?
It varies with the locality. All of the Northern
and Eastern scrub lands are intensely fertile with
vegetable mould. The Darling Downs contains
4,000,000 acres of magnificent black soil, principally
decomposed basalt. The soil in the Maranoa district
is lighter and more suited to wheat-growing and vines.
These descriptions apply, pretty generally to the whole
of Queensland.
Who are the most Successful Farmers?
Those who carry on mixed farming, such as
dairying, agriculture, sheep, pig and poultry raising,
horticulture and bee-farming.
Do many of the Farmers Keep Sheep?
Yes; many of them now go in for lamb-raising
on lucerne. There are also a number of selectors who
have sheep on areas of from 640 to 4,000 acres.
Is Dairying Increasing in Queensland?
A (?s, every day; and nearly all the dairy farmers
are independent men.


How much Milk was Obtained in 1910?
87,648,322 gallons. This quantity was not utilised
for making butter only. It includes the quantity
required for cheese (3,932,090 gallons), 2,103,789
gallons utilised for condensed milk, besides that sold
for domestic purposes (3,099,162 gallons) and
4,950,531 gallons used on farms.
How did these Dairymen Begin?
Most of them began in a very small \yay, buying
a cow now and again as they could afford it-
Were they all Small Farmers?
Yes, for the most part. The larger farmers have
also taken up dairying in addition to wheat, maize,
barley, lucerne, and oat growing.
What was the Butter Production in Queensland in 1910?
31,258,333 lb., valued at �1,333,800.
Cheese, 1910?
4,146,661 lb., valued at �93,000.
Condensed Milk made 1910?
7,843,670 lb., valued at �136,379.
What will a Good Average Cow Earn?
From 15s. to �1 per month.
What is the Price of a Good Cow?
From �5 to �B. Of course some well-bred cows
fetch a much higher figure.
What is the Class of Dairy Herd in Queensland?
Dairy stock have been imported to Queensland
from the principal herds of the world, and a splendid
class of cow is now in use, comprising the following
breeds: ?Milking Shorthorn, Ayrshire, Holstein,
Guernsey, and Jersey.


How many Cows does the Average Farm Carry?
It all depends on the size of the holding. There
are two large properties in Queensland, each milking
1,000 cows. The average herd is about 20, but many
farmers milk from 80 to 150 daily.
How many Cows could you Carry on 160 Acres?
With good land, mixed farming, and by growing
crops and conserving fodder, you could carry 30 to
40 at a low estimate. Some 160 acres cleared scrub
farms carry 70 to 80 cows.
Monthly Cheques.
Suppliers to the factories are paid monthly by
cheque, and some draw �lOO and over per month for
milk and cream.
Pigs.
Pig-raising is now considered to be a part of
dairying, and is very profitable. The climate is
particularly suited to pigs, and no housing is required.
Pig Farms.
, On some holdings large mobs of young pigs are
grazed on barley or alfalfa (lucerne), and topped up
in batches in large sties.
Market for Pigs.
There is a certain market for pigs in Brisbane,
Toowoomba, &c., where there arp bacon-curing estab-
lishments.
Wheat.
Wheat is sown (late maturing varieties) in March
and April, and (quick maturing varieties) in May,
June, and July. Harvesting extends from October to
early in December.


Where Wheat is Principally Grown.
In Southern Queensland. It can also he grown in
the Central-western districts of Queensland.
Wheat Yield.
Crops of 20 to 30 bushels to the acre are com-
monly reaped in the best wheat-growing districts of
Queensland. Forty bushels per acre have often been
obtained in individual instances.
Maize.
Maize is planted in July and August right up to
January, and is fit for harvesting in 120 days. It can
be grown all over Queensland, where the rainfall is
sufficient. Two crops a year are possible in sub-
tropical scrub and coastal country.
Maize Yield.
Immense yields of maize, from 40 to 80 bushels
per acre, are frequently obtained on the rich scrub
lands.
Barley.
Barley does particularly well on the Darling
Downs, where the quality of the crop for malting
purposes is held by English experts to equal the best
Hungarian. Crops of from 30 to 40 bushels are
frequent in a good season.
Sugarcane.
Sugarcane growing is carried on along the coastal
area from Brisbane northwards. It is planted from
January to June; 1,840,447 tons of sugarcane were
produced in 1910.
Bonus for Sugarcane Grown by White Labour.
A bonus of from 6s. to 7s. 6d. per ton is allowed
by the Commonwealth Government for all sugarcane
grown by white labour. Crops of from 40 to even 70
tons per acre have been obtained in the North.


Hay.
Hay averaged about 1% tons to the acre for the
last twenty years. Individual crops yield much
heavier results.
Potatoes.
Both English and sweet potatoes give heavy
yields.

in Southern Queensland Once planted, it lasts from
seven to ten years.


Lucerne Crops.
The roots of lucerne have been known to penetrate
the soil for a depth of 30 ft. In a good year five to
six cuttings can be obtained. Ten cuttings per annum
are often obtained around Laidley, Southern Queens-
land.
Can a Man get any Crop with his First Ploughing?
Yes. Wheat or Maize.
What First Crop can bs got off Scrub Land?
The method is to fell the scrub, and, after it has
dried, put a fire through it. Maize is then put in with
a hoe between the stumps. Some crops up to 80
bushels per acre have been garnered in this way.
Stats Agricultural College.
There is a State Agricultural College at Gatton,
South Queensland, where students can undergo a three
years? training at a cost of under �3O per annum.
Are there any other State Experimental Farms?
Yes. At Hermitage, near Warwick; Westbrook,
near Toowoomba; Roma, Biggenden, Warren, near
Rockhampton; Gindie, near Emerald; Kairi, Atherton
district (North Queensland); and at Kamerunga,
near Cairns (North Queensland); Sugar Experiment
Station and Laboratory, Mackay (North Queensland) ;
and experimental plots in all the principal sugar
districts.
House and Buildings.
At first a farmer generally erects a rough, cheap
building of materials cut on the place, and when
matters improve puts up a more suitable dwelling.
This only runs into a few pounds.
21
UNPEOPLED COUNTRY.


Where can Building Materials bs Obtained?
Iron and wood can be obtained in any part of
Queensland. Competition among the timber merchants
is so keen that timber can be procured at a small cost.
A comfortable cottage can be built for about �IOO.
Do Droughts Often Occur?

were parts of Queensland not affected by it. Droughts
do not, as a rule, affect the whole country, and with
extended railway communication relief country will
be available.

I Some Successful Queensland Farmers. 1
It will be noted that all the extracts from letters here given
are from people who have come to (Queensland from oversea
(Australia and New Zealand excluded), and who are con-
tented with the steps taken by them in becoming residents of
Queensland. All the facts stated can be verified.
How Property worth �B,OOO was Acquired.
Me. George Lovbday, Cooby Creek, Darling Downs,
writes:?-
I arrived in Queensland when twenty-two years of age
from Great Chishill, Essex, England. I worked as a general
hand on stations for a number of years, and then made a
start on my own by selecting 147 acres at �1 per acre from
the Crown, I started farming, and in five years increased
my holding to 500 acres by further selecting. The proceeds
obtained from the land enabled me to go on further increas-
ing my holding, which now amounts to 1,700 acres. I have
reared a family of four, and have assisted in settling my two
sons on the land. My holding and stock represent a value
of �B,OOO, and have been acquired from working the land
and not through speculation.?
Hard Work Obtains 2,400 Acres.
Me. W. Molony, Goombungee, South Queensland, writes
? After my arrival in Queensland forty-three years ago I
worked at various occupations for a few years. Any man,
whether tradesman or labourer, who is willing to work, will
find his services eagerly sought after, at very good wages.
I then selected 640 acres of good land, which became my
property absolutely on selection. After a few years of hard


work and successful farming and dairying, I was able to
select further areas, and also to make purchases of other
farms, until now I have a total of 2,400 acres all my own
and absolute freehold. In the district where I am situated
I know a great number who made a start from very limited
means ?indeed, some of them on a few pounds only?and
who are now people of independent means. Many started
upon 80 acres or 160 acres, and by their own hard work and
perseverance now hold from 600 acres to 2,000 acres of
freehold land. ? ?
Golden Opportunities.
He adds: ?-
?It is the opportunity which Queensland offers to
acquire land and the liberality of its land laws that prompts
me to recommend its suitability to people in search of a home
and independence. The progress made by farmers and dairy-
men during the last ten or fifteen years has been very
satisfactory indeed, as is evidenced by the many comfortable
homes that adorn the farms. Queensland has a sunny
climate, and the absence of severe winters renders it unneces-
sary to either rug or stable cattle during that season. The
natural grasses are usually sufficient for the feeding of both
horses and cattle, though a wise farmer will have without
much trouble a good store of hay and other feed. Should
this short statement be the means of inducing any old-country
people to try their fortunes here, they will never regret it. ?
A German Settler Lands with 215.; now worth over �4,000.
Statement by C. F. Schelbach, Roadvale: ??
?I am a native of Germany. I left there in 1877 when
nineteen years of age, and arrived in Moreton Bay in a sailing
ship, and have lived in Queensland ever since (thirty years).
I landed with 21s. in my pocket, and unable to speak English.
My first work was splitting timber and fencing at 10s. per
week and keep. I worked there (Rosewood) until I saved
enough to repay my parents in Germany the �5 for my
passage money, and to pay the first rent and survey fee for
the selection on which lam still living. In 1880 I married an


English girl, and we have had nine children, seven of them
still alive. lam now the owner of 567 acres of first-class land
and about 140 head of cattle, and a number of working
horses, pigs, and fowls; also vehicles and farm machinery.
The whole value of it is over �4,000. My two eldest sons are
now farming on their own account. Queensland is a fine
country?in fact, it is one of, if not the best, countries under
the sun.?
�2 of Capital Eventuates in 660 Acres of Property.
Mr. James Miot, The Cedars, Boonah, writes:?
??l sailed from Broomielaw, Glasgow, in the barque
?Toowoomba,? On the 3rd December, 1872, and landed in
Brisbane in the end of March, 1873, with �2 in my pocket. I
went to the Immigration Depot, and stayed there three days,
when I got a situation on a station with my wife as cook and
myself as wood-and-water joey. Stayed there two years, and
left-with �7O, when I went to another cattle station, and
afterwards to Dugandan. Selected 160 acres there, and
started farming. I have now increased the area of my
property to 660 acres.
?Now a man with �2 capital in the old country would
remain a poor man all his life. I knew plenty of tenant
farmers in Scotland with a capital of from �SOO to �I,OOO
going on from year to year, and only making a living through
high rents and foreign competition. If those men were here,
they would be independent in from ten to twenty years.
?I have no hesitation in saying that Queensland is
of the best countries in the world for a poor man. ? ?
Landed with ss. in his Pocket. Saving at the Rate of �IOO
a Year for 22 Years.
Mr. J. T. Hooper, Hampstead, advises as follows: ?
?I left the Isle of Wight on 11th August, 1862, and
landed in Moreton Bay in December, 1862, with ss. in my
pocket. Began work in Queensland as assistant stockman. In
1876 I had saved �2OO, and invested in land in the Dugandan
Scrub. I first put 6 acres under corn, and the next year 16


acres. In these days, with railways, telegraph, improved
agricultural machinery, intending settlers have an easy time
compared to the days when we had to cart our stuff 28 to 40
miles on unmade roads. I felled on an average from 10 to 15
acres of scrub every year for seven years, took off two crops,
and put it out to pasture. Ten years afterwards I started
breaking up with the plough on the land first cleared. There
were 250 acres in this property, and here I remained for
twenty-two years, and during this period I reared and
educated a family of eight children, and in addition saved on
an average �IOO per year for these twenty-two years. In
1893 I purchased an additional 350 acres. On the properties
thus acquired I settled my four sons, who are all doing well.
I may state that I made it a practice to pay my sons a regular
wage from about sixteen years of age. In 1887 I netted �SOO
out of a total of �BSO worth of produce sold in that one year.
I am contented with the position that I have attained in this
State, and do not see anything to prevent others doing even
better.?
Satisfied with his Prospects.
Statement by Mr. W. G-. Chatham, Wolverley, Warwick:??
?With reference to Queensland as a country for a man
of means to settle in, I beg to state that I have been in Queens-
land for six years, for most of which time I have been engaged
in farming pursuits. At first I had but indifferent success
owing to bad seasons then prevailing, since which I have had
much better results, and consider this part of Queensland
well adapted for combined farming, grazing, and dairying,
particularly dairying; and lam of opinion that, given a fair
run of seasons, I am in a fair way to improve my positon, and
can express myself as satisfied with my prospects.?
20 Years of Farming.
Statement by Me. Thos. Beaithwaite, Inglefield, War-
wick :
?I have been in Queensland for twenty years, farming
continuously all the time. I have been fairly successful, and
I consider it a country suitable for farming?either stock-


raising, dairying, or green production. I consider it a good
country for a man to come to, provided the man is the right
stamp of man to go on the land.
Entering a Period of Great Advancement.
Mb. Harold M. May, Englebourne, Warwick, says:?
?I left the South Hams district of Devonshire, England,
in 1892, and have been engaged in agricultural pursuits on
my own account here for the past fourteen years. lam well
satisfied with Queensland, both from a commercial and a
residential point of view. This State offers opportunities of
advancement in many walks of life, but especially in land
matters, which are not available in the old country. We are
entering on a period of great advancement, and any new-
comer who is steady and, industrious, and takes time to
acquire local experience before investing his capital, cannot
very well fail to get on. ? ?
Good Agricultural Prospects.
Me. T. Y. Levingb arrived in Queensland from Ireland in
June, 1907, and since that time has been engaged in agricul-
tural pursuits on a small farm (60 acres) near Warwick;
and, as. far as his experience goes, is well satisfied with the
agricultural prospects of that district.
Successful Grazing Farmers.
Mr. Robert Grieve, of Summerhope, in the Roma district,
states:?
?I am a native of Dumfrieshire, Scotland. I came to
Queensland in 1883, with a family of six sons and three
daughters. Three years after arriving in Queensland I
bought a share in Cooinda Station, near Roma, and went in
for sheep-raising.
?I afterwards sold out, and selected the country now
known as Summerhope, Roma district, and continued sheep-
breeding.
?Two of my sons have selected grazing country in this
district, fenced it in, stocked it, and are now in a fair way of
becoming successful grazing farmers.
?I am quite contented with the step taken by me in
becoming a resident of Queensland.?


What a Lincolnshire Man says.
Mr. J. H. Butters, Sunnyside, Crow?s Nest, gives his
experience:?
1 ? I am a Lincolnshire man. After twenty years ? residence
in this part of Queensland., I am in a position to give a fair
opinion of its capabilities, and am perfectly satisfied that I
made it my home. My health gave way in England, and
doctors advised a residence in Australia or New Zealand. On
landing, I was advised ?not to go on the land at first, but get
into the Toowoomba district and take employment for a year,
to get experience, as the conditions of farming are so different
to England.?
?In 1888, I selected 160 acres at 2s, 6d. per acre?about
half scrub and half forest. Maize and potatoes were our
principal crops until about seven years ago, when dairying
came to the front, and has been the making of hundreds of
farmers. The cream cheque comes in regularly every month.
? I myself have been handicapped by poor health, but
to-day the farm that cost me �2O is worth nearer �2,000 than
�l,OOO.
General Prosperity.
? ? The greater part of the land in this district was taken
up in 160-acre blocks, often by men with no capital. Now
these men have comfortable homes, farms well stocked, and
in many cases have bought more land and increased their
holdings. Prosperity can be seen on every hand. Of course,
there are drawbacks, such as spells of drought; but, if the
Queensland farmer would make the same provision that the
English farmer has to do for every winter, he would come out
all right. The climate in this district, as far as health is
concerned, is just perfection, being on the Main Range and
never too hot.
? ? Any young Britisher with pluck, not afraid of work or
roughing it, need not be afraid to settle in Southern Queens-
land, for if he wishes to better his position he can do so.
? ? I consider Canada, where so many are going at present,
not to be compared to Queensland.?


What another Lincolnshire Man did with a Capital of �4.
Mr. Fred Smith, of Virginia, Crow?s Nest, was born at
Asserby, a hamlet of Bilsby, Lincolnshire, England,, and
brought up on a farm. He became a farm foreman at the age
of twenty-one years, and followed that occupation for eleven
years; but, finding that there was only just a living and a few
clothes to be made out of it, emigrated to (Queensland, and
landed there in January,, 1900. He had a wife and five
children, and when he landed had only �4 with which to start
life in Queensland. He says: ?I got work before I had been
in Queensland a week, at 30s. per week (dam-making) and
found. I worked on wages for the first five years until my
two boys were old enough to select a homestead. We took up
160 acres each, and afterwards 160 acres each more. After
five years, we were owners of 320 acres apiece. I now hold
940 acres freehold and 247 acres leasehold, and have it
stocked with all requirements?implements, horses, cattle,
pigs, and fowls. My sons are also doing well, one of them
renting from me 195 acres in addition to his 320 acres. If we
had remained in England. I don?t suppose we would have
had �5 each.?
A WelLknown Grazier?s Opinion.
The testimony of John Moffat, Esq., of Camoola Park, a
well-known grazier in the Longreach district, is of more than
ordinary interest. Mr. Moffat says:?
? ? There were never better opportunities than the present
in Queensland for young men and women who have energy
and ambition, and are not frightened of honest work. I came
from Scotland when a baby with my parents (emigrants)
during the fifties to Adelaide, South Australia. My father
worked as a blacksmith, and afterwards as a carrier taking
goods to the Victorian goldfields, and subsequently began
farming in New South Wales. I had seven brothers and
three sisters.
?I left home without a shilling, and took to shearing
during the season, and did contract work at other times until
I had enough money to select a half section (320 acres) in
New South Wales. There I married, and in time increased


my area sufficiently to carry on sheep-grazing and wheat-
growing. In time I sold out to good advantage, and came to
Queensland, where lam now a grazier. My brothers are all
employers of labour. I have reared and educated three sons
and two daughters. If I were a young man now with my
usual health, I would not be afraid to start life again under
similar circumstances and present conditions. I attribute my
success to perseverance and ambition, and using the proceeds
judiciously. Australia is a good field for any industrious
man or woman who sets his or her mind to honest work and
tries to give satisfaction, as there are employments to suit
nearly all classes of labour, as also for a man of moderate
means, to take up a small farm in a suitable locality,
especially after getting some experience in one of the State
Agricultural Colleges. I have been in the State now fifteen
years, and consider it a very good field for emigrants. ? ?
What a 40 Years? Resident Thinks?Sends for his Three
Brothers.
?Queensland, the Premier State for the Working Man.?
Statement by Mr. Thos. Spence, Rosedale, Longreach:?
?I landed in West Australia over forty years ago, and,
after travelling all over Australia, with the exception of
South Australia, decided to remain in Queensland. I worked
in various States, and came in 1885 to Queensland, where I
have remained ever since.
?I am satisfied that Queensland is the best State of the
lot for any honest working man, in proof of which I sent home
to the old country for my three brothers. These, with their
families, are now comfortably, settled in Queensland, and
doing well, and I have no hesitation in recommending Queens-
land to anyone desirous of getting on in life. My present
occupation is that of a grazing farmer. ? ?


An Irishman?s Eulogy of Queensland.
Me. James Connolly, Oaklands, Crow?s Nest, is a native of
the ?Island of Landlordism,? and can speak with authority
on some comparative advantages. He says:?
?? In the first place the acquisition of Crown lands for
farming purposes is so easy at the present time in Queensland,
as compared with the ? Old Land, ? that anyone who has a little
cash need not waste his time on arrival here competing for the
odd jobs about the towns, but may, with the information at
his disposal and the railway facilities now in existence, imme-
diately take up a piece of good agricultural land, and so be
assured of a comparatively comfortable living from the very
start. ? ? He points out the advantages offered to the intending
settler by State assistance, for effecting improvements or
purchasing stock, as offered by the Agricultural Bank.
Climatic Advantages.
He adds:???Then take our climate (the finest in the
world), and compare it with the much-talked-of Canada, or
with the last winter I spent in the old land?six months frost,
without one thaw ?when here in mid-winter you will find
farmers at work in shirt and trousers at 9 o?clock in the morn-
ing. Just try to realise the paradise the British dairyman
would consider himself in could he allow his cows to roam
about the fields night and day all through the winter with no
protection, other than (in some cases) a rug thrown over
them.? He also points out to Irishmen contemplating
emigration that two crops of potatoes can be raised in Queens-
land in a year. ?Pig-raising is a business in which there is
more than an ordinary living to be made.?
Darling Downs Land Superior Soil to Anything in the
World.
Mr. John Patrick Geaney, of Mile End, Warwick, has
spent forty-four years in Queensland as a farmer and grazier,
and all his sons and daughters are married, settled on the
land, and doing well. ? Four years ago,? says Mr. Geaney,
? I took a trip to my native country, Ireland. Prom there I


travelled across to America, and was highly impressed with
some of the country I saw there. Nevertheless, I consider
Queensland, and particularly this portion (Darling Downs),
superior to anything I saw in my travels.?
No Farmer would Leave Queensland for the Old Country.
Boom for Millions.
Mr. James Kemp, of Yangan, writes: ?
?After more than forty years? residence in the Yangan
district as a practical farmer, I say by all means let the
Government settle men of the right stamp on the land, not
in driblets, as in the past, but in ever-increasing thousands,
and Queensland will speedily take her rightful position as the
leading State in Australasia. The fact is that given such
land as is the rule in this district, and assuming that the man
who settles on the land is not afraid of work, then success is
assured. No man in his senses, who knew what farming
meant in the old country, would ever dream of leaving a farm
in Queensland to occupy one in Scotland. The successful
farmer here enjoys an experience of independence and
general well-being that was altogether unattainable in the old
land.?
Queensland ?the Right Place for a Steady Man.
The opinion of Mb. Patrick S. Kelly, Crow?s Nest, is that
Queensland is the right place for a steady man to prosper in,
and he has no hesitation in saying it is second to none in the
world. ? When I arrived from Ireland in 1857,? he says,
? ? I had little or no means, and I am pleased to say that I am
now an independent man. I have several sons, all of whom
have secured land and are doing well. ? ?
A very Large Family all Comfortably Settled.
? One of the Best Countries in the World.?
Statement by Mr. Thos. Williams, Crow?s Nest: ?
? I arrived in Queensland in November, 1867, and settled
on the Darling Downs. I secured a piece of land, sold out,
and took up land at Crow?s Nest, and commenced farming
and grazing. I have a very large family, who are now in very


comfortable circumstances, some of whom have entered into
business, and others have secured good agricultural home-
steads. I am a fairly well-to-do man. I have no hesitation
in saying that Queensland is one of the best countries in the
world. ? ?
Success Easy to Industrious Men.
Mr. Matthew Gleeson, also of Crow?s Nest, has a large
family of sons who are settled on the land and in comfortable
circumstances. ? I arrived in this State from Ireland in
1859,? writes Mr. Gleeson, ? and on my arrival I secured a
piece of land on the Darling Downs, and commenced farming
and grazing, both of which proved very satisfactory. Any
steady man can prosper in this State. A man that cannot get
on in Queensland, where he has all the facilities imaginable,
will not do so elsewhere.?
No Other Country is like Queensland for a Man with
Limited Capital.
Statement of Me. James Debbain, of Bromelton, Beaudesert,
dairy farmer and grazier:?
? I was born in King?s County, Ireland, in 1849, and
arrived in Queensland in 1862. Followed cotton-growing
successfully at Waterford, Lower Logan, for some years.
Afterwards (in 1872) selected land at Bromelton. The area
of my present selection is 300 acres. I turned my attention to
maize and potato growing. Like all other new settlers, I had
my ups and downs. About the fourth year maize was bring-
ing a good price, and I had planted about 50 acres in a belt
of scrub along the river bank. This was all planted with the
hoe, and produced a very heavy crop?over 80 bushels to the
acre. This can be verified by several of my neighbours, who
had river frontages, and who were also fortunate. The next
year I was able to take up 280 acres for my wife, besides
purchasing a few dairy stock. lam now the owner of 1,600
acres of freehold property, well stocked and improved. My
family are all on the land. Like other successful men on the
land, my capital was very limited. My experience is that the
good seasons more than counteract the bad ones. No other


country is like Queensland for a man with limited capital. I
am pleased that I settled in Queensland, where I and, I think,
400 of my shipmates have all done well and have splendid
homes. ? ?
? The Best Thing I Ever Did.?
Mb. John Murray, farmer and grazier, of Bromelton,
Beaudesert, was born in Dublin in 1837, arrived in Queens-
land in 1861. Followed mining in the North and West, and
in 1872 came South, and selected 320 acres at Bromelton, his
present home.
? This I consider,? writes Mr. Murray, ? was the best
thing I ever did. My present holding is 2,700 acres, part of
which I have since given to my son, who is doing well also. I
never regret coming to Queensland, and making my home
here. I have always enjoyed the best of health in it, and
after a residence of over forty years I am still of opinion that
there is no country in the world which offers such splendid
opportunities for anyone wishing to follow farming, grazing,
or dairying pursuits.?
How an Ayrshire Man Succeeded.
Statement of Mb, William Ferguson, farmer and grazier,
Cedar Creek, Beenleigh:?
? I was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, and arrived in
Queensland in 1857, under contract to grow cotton for the
Manchester Cotton Company at Nerang. Afterwards selected
land at Cedar Creek, where I have been engaged in grazing
and general farming ever since. I consider Queensland an
ideal country for both. I now hold the deeds of 2,00,0 acres
of first-class country, highly improved, well stocked, and
deriving a good income from dairying. I am now in every
respect independent, and my family of ten are all doing well
in various parts of the State, and would not leave it. Queens-
land is a most healthy country to live and prosper in,?


Opinion of a Resident of 47 Years.
? No Greater Country on the Face of the Earth.?
Statement by Me. John Curtis, President of the Middle
Eidge Shire Council, Middle Eidge, Toowoomba:?
? After an experience of forty-seven years in this
country, during which I have reared a family of twelve, most
of whom are now settled down in life, I am quite satisfied that
there is no greater country than Queensland on the face of
the earth. I speak from practical experience of agricultural
life in Queensland. No finer opportunities await the emigrant
in any part of the world than are to be found in this
country. ? ?
Increase of Stock as Profit.
Mb. Andrew Geddbs, of Balmoral, Yaamba, writes that he
never regrets coming to Queensland, where he has brought
up six sons and three daughters. He has been forty-six years
in his district, and all his sons are settlers on the land. His
experience is that people who settle on the land have a far
better chance of saving money than those who remain in the
towns. Most of the small selectors produce sufficient from
dairying to keep themselves in rations, pay wages, &c., and
then have the increase of their stock pretty well as profit.
Satisfied with Queensland.
Mr. J. Woodward, of Warrill Creek, Ipswich, after an experi-
ence of farming, dairying, and sheep-raising in both Queens-
land and New Zealand, prefers the former country. He came
to Queensland in 1895, and in a few weeks bought a farm of
400 acres as a going concern for �l,OOO. Prom the first week
the farm paid its way, and a living was assured. As time
went on, the income kept improving as his methods and cattle
improved. ?Every year,? writes Mr. Woodward, ?I
provided more winter food, and kept culling the dairy herd,
eventually working into a good useful lot of cows. And what
with the monthly cream cheque, pigs, surplus calves, and
springers, there was money to be banked monthly.?


A Snug Little Holding of 4,000 Acres.
Mb. A. McLaughlin, J.P., of Burnside, Springsure, landed
in Brisbane on St. Patrick?s Day, 1866. Engaged in cotton-
growing in West Moreton until 1869. Then followed station
work and contracting in Springsure district for six years.
Worked as a carrier with bullock teams from 1879 to 1884.
Then selected ? Burnside,? his present holding, part of
Cardbeign Sheep Station, where he now resides, engaged in
mixed farming. He writes : ?? ? I can strongly recommend
Queensland to anyone wishing to make a home, but would not
recommend taking up a small area in this district. In my
opinion, stock must be the leading line on a selection.
? My native birthplace is County Derry, Ireland, and I
am proud to say that I have a family of twelve healthy
children all engaged on the homestead, which consists of
4,000 acres.?
Never Regretted Coming to Queensland.
Mb. J. W. Westcott, Sandiford, near Mitchell, Maranoa
district, is a native of Devonshire, England, and came to
Queensland in the year 1882, being little more than seventeen
years old. After spending four years connected with sheep
on the Darling Downs, he came to the Maranoa district, and
selected 160 acres near Mitchell. He has kept adding to that
area, and now holds about 2,000 acres freehold, and 3,000
acres leasehold.
? I have gone in for mixed farming,? writes Mr.
Westcott, ? but chiefly for sheep. I have never regretted
coming to Queensland.?
Started Without a Shilling.
Statement by Me. R. Ceuice, Terror?s Creek, North JPine: ?
? I am well satisfied since coming to Queensland. I
think it is the finest country in the world. I think that every
man who goes on the land ought to be well satisfied. There
are plenty of men I know who started without a shilling
twenty or thirty years ago, and now they are independent.
I inquired of a good many neighbours, and they all seem to
be satisfied with Queensland.?


A Family of Ten All Doing Well.
?? I came to Queensland from Ireland forty years ago,?
writes Mr. Edmond Quirk, Chinchilla, ? during which period
I have engaged in various pursuits, such as farming, grazing,
and dairy-farming. I have reared a family of ten children,
all of age, doing well, and two of the oldest holding land
adjoining me. I have spent about thirty years in the
Chinchilla district, and I can sincerely say that I am
thoroughly satisfied with my lot, and the step I took in
coming to this State.
From Stockman to Stockowner.
Mr. Richard Neagle, Gaylong, Capella, states: ?
? ? I arrived in Queensland in September, 1882, and since
then I have been engaged at the following occupations;?
Stockman, contractor, miner, and grazing farmer. I have
found all the above occupations satisfactory, more especially
grazing farming, which I started about sixteen years ago,
principally in sheep. For land settlement there is no place
better suited, or more profitable, than Queensland.
? At the present time I hold a selection of about 12,000
acres, with 7,000 sheep, and about 50 head of cattle and
horses. ? ?
Arrived in Queensland with Sixpence?Now a Well=to=do
Farmer.
(Reprinted from the ? Tooivoomha Chronicle ? of 7th October, 1911.)
One of the greatest identities in the Clifton district is
Mr. Maas H. Hinz, J.P., typical pioneer, and one whose
industry and perseverance have done much to push on that
busy farming place, Clifton. Like many other of the old
residents there, he has seen the Clifton Back Plains develop
from sheep and cattle country into one large farming com-
munity. How the scenes have changed during the regime of
these sturdy old pioneers! Instead of hearing the crack of
the stockwhip or the bleating of sheep on the plains, they now
hear the merry laughter of school children wending their way


to school from the many happy farms that are dotted here
and there around the Clifton township. Mr. M. H. Hinz was
born in Holstein, Germany, in January, 1841. After leaving
school he worked as a farm labourer. Left the Fatherland
for Queensland on 28th May, 1864, by the ship ? La
Rochelle,? and landed in Brisbane on 6th September, the
same year. On landing all he
Possessed was a Solitary Sixpence!
After residing two days in the depot he secured a job with a-
farmer named Mr. R. "Wilson, of Biley Creek, at 10s. a week.
Subsequent to six months with Mr. Wilson, Mr. Hinz got
another job on the construction work of the Ipswich-
Toowoomba Railway line, and later on worked as a navvy
on the Dalby and "Warwick lines. In 1867, when wages were
very low, he went across to the Burnett district, and took on
shepherding on Coringa Station. He remained in that
district until 1870, and then returned to the Toowoomba
district, where he took up fencing and other contract work
until 1872. The discovery of tin at Stanthorpe about this
time attracted his attention, and he went there to try his-
fortune in the tin rush. On 30th December, the same year,
he took up 760 acres at Back Plains, about ten miles from
Clifton. Three or four months after selecting he started
working his land. For twelve months his life was a lonely
one. In December, 1873, he married, and, to use his own
words, ? the taking up of a farm and the securing of a good
wife I can safely say were the two best things I ever did in
my life.? In 1875 he selected another 320 acres. When he
secured the last block there were no less than thirty-two
applicants. His luck was right in on that occasion. In 1877
he bought from a neighbour 160 acres; and in 1893, when the
Clifton Estate was sold, he purchased 960 acres adjoining his
own property. In 1900 he bought 160 acres from a man
leaving the district, and shortly afterwards purchased
another 760 acres of grazing land. It will thus be noticed
that while working his farm land.


By Hard Work and Indomitable Perseverance,
he gradually increased his holdings. During the whole of
the time he carried on mixed farming?dairying, maize and
wheat growing, and sheep and horse breeding. He tells an
interesting tale of the feeling regard which the squatter felt
for the embryo settler of that day, and shudders to think of
the fate that might have befallen him had a station gate
remained unclosed whilst he footed the paths to the country
now known as Back Plains. But he came and saw, and the
magnificent range of buildings ?to say nothing of the
splendid homestead of Holstein Hill?furnish the sequel that
he conquered! Mr. Hinz has not denied his services to the
community in which he lives, for he is a magistrate of many
years ? standing, and was a member of the divisional board for
twelve years, once occupying the position of chairman. He
was also chairman of the local cheese factory, school com-
mittee, School of Arts, and several other bodies.
Enjoying the Fruits of his Arduous Labours.
His life has been an active as well as useful one, and it is his
privilege now to enjoy the fruits of his arduous labours and
early settlement. Mr. Hinz toured the continent, of Europe
in 1900, and visited the Paris Exhibition, as also the earlier
scenes of his youth. He has reared a family of eight
children, five girls and three boys. On January this year, on
attaining the age of 70, he gave over the farm lands to his
three sons, who are now working the property on the same
lines as himself, while he and his wife and two daughters are
living privately at Clifton. He and his good wife have
worthily earned a rest, after putting in such good work in
developing the district of Clifton.
A Successful Turk?Started with a Shilling.
( Reprinted from the ?Walsh and Tinaroo Miner,? 23rd December, 1911.)
A visit to the farm of Fer.ris Germanus (a Turk by
birth, but now a naturalised British subject) is an object


lesson in what can be done by perseverance. Seven years
ago he landed in Mareeba, in the Cairns hinterland (North
Queensland), with only the proverbial shilling in his
pocket. He selected the area of land he is now settled on
(160 acres), about 2 miles above Mareeba, on a very pretty
bend of the ever-flowing Barron River. Here, by dint of
hard work, he has now made a home for himself and family.
Corn, always a risky crop, was the mainstay for the first few
years, but now he has learned that other crops pay much
better. Still he has about 20 acres ploughed ready for corn,
awaiting rain at the time of our visit. On an easterly slope
experiments have been made in fruit-growing. Here are
to be seen figs, olives, lemons, peaches, custard apples, grapes,
pomoloes, papaws, mangoes, mulberries, &e. An interesting
experiment, and a successful one, was grafting English figs
on to a wild fig-tree. The difference between the fruit on this
tree and the original English fig-tree is very marked. On
the banks of the river is a sandy loam flat, and this is the
market garden. Potatoes are growing right up to the
water?s edge in almost pure sand, as much as 7 lb. weight of
potatoes being pulled from the one stalk .Mr. Germanus esti-
mates that the acreage under cultivation has realised at the
rate of 12 tons to the acre. Beans, melons, marrows, cab-
bage, tomatoes, egg-fruit, &c., are growing in profusion, and
this notwithstanding that no rain has fallen since April.
Pig-raising is a most profitable line, and this is recognised by
Mr. Germanus. He has a very fine piggery, about 5 acres
of ridgy country being enclosed with wire netting. The pigs
are doing well, and should return a good profit. Mr. Ger-
manus is putting in about 7 acres of sweet potatoes for pig
feed. A crop of sweet spuds stood him in good stead early
this year at the time of the stoppage of the traffic on the
Cairns railway line. He found a ready sale for all he could
grow, and sold about �4O worth in a fortnight. A few cows
are kept, but this settler intends to confine himself to
agriculture and pig-raising.


AN INTERVIEW.
The following interview with Mr'. J. Edmiston, a selector of
Alton Downs, near Rockhampton, who, besides being an
experienced colonial farmer, is one whose opinion and
statements may be regarded as being absolutely reliable,
should prove useful to intending emigrants. Although Mr.
Edmiston?s experience has been chiefly in Central (Queens-
land, his remarks apply equally to other parts of the State; ?
Good Prospects.
1 ? Do you think there is a' good prospect for anyone coming
to Queensland? ? was the first question asked him.
? I think there is a splendid prospect for people
coming here,? he promptly replied. ?If they come to
go on the land and start farming, there is every likeli-
hood that men willing to work and to learn the style of
farming suited to this country will do well for them-
selves, much better than they are doing in the old
country. ?
What a Labouring Man can do.
? ? What could a labouring man make at farming here ? ? ?
?He could easily earn about �2OO a year at it. I
have made that myself. I had experience on a farm at
home, but that is not absolutely necessary.?
Farming for New Settlers.
? ? Do you think farming is the best thing for new settlers to
turn to in this country ? ? ?
? Certainly. In fact, I would not advise people to
come here to settle in the towns. They should come
prepared to begin farming at once, or to make prepara-
tion for starting a farm of their own. ? , :


? What kind of farming is best in your opinion? ?
? I would recommend a man to take up dairy
farming. Cows can be bought for about �4 to �7 each.
Then you can buy good dairy land for about �1 per acre.
Of course, this does not apply to the Darling Downs,
where the best land reaches high figures. You have long
terms, about twenty years, to pay for your land, and the
payments are not equal to a good rent in the old country.
When a man has got his land he can grow plenty of feed
for his cattle for the few months of the winter, when they
have to be fed on account of the pastures being dry.
During the rest of the year his cattle find their food in
the natural grasses of his pastures. ? ?
Amount of Capital Required.
? What amount of capital should a man bring with him to
begin farming? ?
? A man could easily make a good start here with
about �l5O. That money would be used for paying the
first instalment on his land purchase, buying a few cows,
and putting up his house. Of course, a pioneer doesn?t
spend much on his house at first, until he has made some
money. ?
A Beginning.
? How did you begin? ?
? I began with �lOO about ten years ago. I have
paid for my land some time since, and I reckon that at
the present time I am worth about �2,000 in land and
stock.?
?Suppose an intending emigrant had very little capital??
? He could get assistance from the Agricultural
Bank of the State Government, if he wished to begin
straight away on the land; or he could buy land from


the Government, and then put in some time with the
neighbouring farmers, or in work wherever he could get
it, and in this -way save a little capital to enable him to
begin on his own land. ? ?
Markets.
?? What kind of market could he expect for his butter and
other produce f ? ?
? There is a splendid market always ready for his
butter. Then all sorts of produce that can be grown in
any country can be produced by the farmer in Queens-
land, and there is always a good market for it. ? ?
Produce.
? What other produce besides butter have you grown and
marketed? ?
? I have grown oats for hay, maize for horse and
fowl feed, English and sweet potatoes, poultry, various
kind of fodder plants, ground nuts, fruits, and other
kinds of produce. On the Darling Downs and in the
West Moreton and Southern districts large quantities of
lucerne, wheat, and barley are grown.?
'?1
? What kind of return do. you generally get from your
crops? ?
? ? Sweet potatoes you may put down at about 40
tons per acre, sometimes more and sometimes less. Say
they are worth �1 10s. to �3 a ton, that gives you �6O to
�l2O an acre. Then English potatoes in this district
average about 5 tons to the acre, and at �6 a ton the yield
is �3O per acre. Then I have grown lucerne and several
kinds of millet. The Hungarian and French millets are
splendid cattle feed and chick feed. I have grown
?ground nuts, which yield about a ton to the acre, and sell
for 3d. per lb., equal to �2B per acre.?


Variety of Produce.
? Yon have grown quite a variety of produce, have you
not? ?
? Yes, I have. That is one of the great advantages
of this country. All the tropical fruits grow wonder-
fully here, and many people I know are making a .living
from even 2or 3 acres of land. A friend of mine close
to Rockhampton is making a good living from about
3 or 4 acres of pineapples.?
Hoiv He Came Out to Queensland.
? In what way did you come out to Queensland? ?
? I came out as an emigrant on board one cf the
British-India line of steamers, and all the cost of my
passage was �l.?
Never Regretted It.
? Have you ever regretted leaving the old country? ?
? Never. I have had no drawbacks whatever that
would alter my opinion about leaving my old home in
Scotland. I come from Lanarkshire, but I would not
return there to live for any amount of money.?
Why He Came.
? How did you come to emigrate to Queensland? ?
? I saw advertisements about Queensland and its
cheap land. One could not get particulars about the
country at that time. We had just to risk it, and trust
the Queensland Government in a general way, and hope
that all would turn out right. ? ?
