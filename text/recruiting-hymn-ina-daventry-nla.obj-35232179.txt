“HOLD ON!
WE’RE COMING”
GALLIPOLI
1915


Recruiting Hymn.
1.
Wake! Australians! Do not slumber,
Loud the voice of duty calls,
Hearken then and do not waver,
Answer, ere the darkness falls.
Hark! it is the voice of your God,
Speaks soft to your listening soul,
“Follow the path I, too, have trod
Through suffering to vict’ry’s goal.”
2.
Rise, Australians! Do not falter,
Show allegiance to your king,
Forward, then, and do not palter,
Lest shame to your land you bring,
Hark! ’tis the plea of your ruler
Comes to you over the sea,
Let not your courage grow cooler;
But heed ye your sov’reign’s plea.
3.
Up, Australian! Honor calls thee,
Stern the fight and fierce the foe,
Great the peril of thy country,
Forward, then, in honour go.
Hark! ’tis the cry of thy mother,
Calls loud to thy listening ear,
Then list to her, oh, my brother,
She needs thee, pray, do thou hear?
4.
Haste, Australians! Kinsmen call you,
Loud they cry from o’er the sea,
“Brothers, come where glory waits you,
Here in far Gallipoli.”
Hark! ’tis the call of our heroes,
Laid low in their eastern grave;
They led, and their great valor shows,
How you must your country save.
5.
Brave Australians! These our brethren
Gave their lives in honor’s cause,
And, hard pressed by Turk and Teuton,
Did not falter, no, nor pause.
Then hark to the voice of your God,
Your king and your country uphold,
Tread the path our heroes have trod,
With hearts that are true and bold.
