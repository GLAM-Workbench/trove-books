parcel, and shall affix to each of such posts or cairns a notice in writing
setting forth that he is an applicant for such allotment, the approxi-
mate area thereof, and his name and address, and from such post or
cairn dig a trench at least two feet long, six inches wide, and four
inches deep, in the direction of the containing sides. The applicant
shall, before lodging his application for a license, pay to the nearest
Receiver of Revenue the sum of One pound for -a certificate of regis-
tration, which the said Receiver shall thereupon hand to him, and
such sum shall not in any case be refunded. All applicants who mark
out the same allotment upon one and the same day shall be deemed to
be equal so far as regards priority of marking out.
2. After defining the boundaries as aforesaid, the applicant shall, 7.2.76.
within one week, post or deliver to the Laud Officer his application,
together with the certificate of registration, and such application shall
be in the form and shall be accompanied by the declaration prescribed

the said certificate be forwarded therewith ; but at the hearing of
such application the failure to comply with the provisions hereof

be a fatal objection where the applicant can prove the existence of some
reasonable ground of excuse, which shall be recorded by the Land
Officer upon the application.
3. The Land Officer shall notify by post to every applicant and to 7.2.76.
every person who in his opinion is interested for or against the appli-
cation the time and the place of the meeting of the Local Land Board

heard; but no person shall be deemed to have any right to receive any
such notice, and any objection to any such application may be taken by
any person, and shall be considered at the hearing although no notice


thereof shall have been given. Except when specially ordered other-
wise by the Minister, all applications for land shall be brought before
the Local Land Board nearest the locality in which the land referred
to is situated.
4. After the consideration of the report of the Local Land Board
and approval of the issue of any license, such license, in the form and
subject to the conditions prescribed in Schedule VII., shall be forwarded
to the proper officer to issue upon payment of the fee for half-year?s
occupation of the land described therein, and a fee of Five shillings

value of improvements, &c. The applicant shall be advised to pay the
said sums within one month from the date of the license. Every such
license shall bear date as of the first of the month next after that in

subject to such special conditions as shall meet the circumstances of
any particular case.
5. If any person whose application for a license shall have been
approved fail to pay the fees as hereinbefore directed, his application
shall be liable to be deemed abandoned, and the allotment applied for
shall be liable to be made available for selection.
6. Unless by the express direction of the Minister, all subsequent
payments of license fees shall be made to the Receiver in whose dis-
trict the land is situated ; but no Receiver shall receive any moneys on
account of licenses unless advised from the Occupation Branch so to do.
7. The Minister may, if he think fit, authorize the issue to any
applicant for a license under section 19 or section 49 of The Land Act
1869, whose application shall have been recommended by a Local Land
Board, of a permit, in the form of Schedule VIII. hereto, entitling such
applicant to provisionally use and occupy, for grazing purposes only,
the land specified in such permit, subject to the terms and conditions and
payment of such fees as shall be set forth therein : Provided that such
permit shall only be so issued when the license applied for under either
of the sections before mentioned is withheld, or the issue thereof is
objected to in consequence of the land being deemed likely to be auri-
ferous, or to be required for railway or other public purposes ; and on
withdrawal of such objections, or on refusal of the license under either
of the sections before mentioned, the right to use and occupy the land
under such permit shall cease and determine: Provided also that no
permit so issued shall have force beyond the thirty-first day of December
of the year during which the same shall have been issued.
8. Whenever it shall appear that any land is within the limit of
deviation of any proposed line of railway, or whenever, from any cause,
it may be deemed desirable, the Minister may order that all or any
applications for land shall be accompanied by an undertaking in the


form of Schedule IX., to be signed by the applicant in the presence of
a witness, whose address shall be given; and all licenses issued for any
such land shall be subject to the conditions specified in Schedule X.
9. Any licensee under Part 11. of The Land Act 1869 who may
desire to take advantage of the provisions of section 8 of The Land Act
1878 shall apply, on or before the 30th April 1879, in the form pre-
scribed in Schedule XI. hereto, to surrender his license and obtain a
new license in lieu thereof. The fee for a new license shall be One
pound.
10. Any licensee under Part 11., Land Act 1869, who may wish to
absent himself for a period in all not exceeding three months in any one
year of the currency of his license shall apply personally to the Land
Officer for the district in which the land is situated, and fill up and sign
a notice in the form prescribed in Schedule XII. hereto.
11. The Land Officer shall register in a book, in the form prescribed
in Schedule XIII. hereto, to be kept in his office for that purpose, each
notice of intended absence, and shall then transmit such notice to the
Secretary for Lands.
12. Whenever it may be deemed necessary to issue a re-license
under section 19, Part 11., of The Land Act 1869, the original license
may be declared void from and after a day to be named in the
Order in Council, and the re-license issued dating from the day named
in such order, and if the Governor shall think fit the fees paid subse-
quent to the date of the re-license may be credited to the licensee with
respect to the re-license.
Non-Residence Licenses. ?Section 11, ?Land Act 1878.?
13. Except as hereinafter provided, all the provisions relating to
applications and licenses under Part 11. of The Land Act 1869 shall

Conditions of Sale.
Conditions of sale by the public auction at the _ commencing at
o?clock, by (being a person authorized by the Board of Land
and Works), of the following portions of land advertised by the notification in the
Government Gazette of the day of 187 ,in
conformity with the provisions of The Land Act 1869, of which those more par-
ticularly necessary to be noticed are hereinafter mentioned, viz.:?
(1.) The land hereinafter described will be put up for sale at the prices respec-
lively stated and annexed to the descriptions thereof, and the bidder of
that sum, or the highest bidder above it, will be declared the purchaser,
provided he shall immediately pay down a deposit of fifty per cent, of
the amount of the purchase-money, and sign a description hereunto
annexed of the lot of which he shall become the purchaser, thereby
binding himself to the observance of the above and following articles and
conditions.
(2 ) The remainder of the purchase-money is to be paid to the Receiver of
Revenue at within one calendar month from this date,
or the deposit will be forfeited, and the land will be again open for sale.
(3.) Immediately after the biddings on each lot are concluded, and before
another lot is put up, the name of the purchaser will be entered in the
list of the descriptions of the lots annexed to these presents, and the
purchaser will be required to affix his signature to the description of the
lot so purchased by him. If previous to such signature any question or
dispute as to the last and best bidder shall arise between the sellers and
bidders, or amongst the bidders themselves, the lot in question shall be
put up again. Subsequent to such signature no dispute whatever can be
admitted, nor can any alteration of name or transfer from the actual
purchaser to another person be allowed. No bid made after the tall ot the
auctioneer?s hammer will be received. In cases of question or dispute the
decision of the officer conducting the sale on behalf of the Government will
be final and conclusive.
(O Deeds of grant will be completed and issued in each case as soon as prac-
ticable after payment in full of the purchase-money, and will be delivered

' to the public chart, each portion of which is described by length of lines run
with a chain upon the bearing of a compass needle, which needle is variously
affected by magnetic attraction in the neighborhood of the colony of Vic-
toria, and the land will accordingly be sold as more or less. Any future
claim for compensation as to any alleged difference in the area will not
therefore be entertained.
(6 ) If the officer acting on behalf of the Government shall find reason to believe
' that any lot will not obtain its just value, or shall otherwise think fit to
withdraw the same from the sale, he shall have full power to do so at any
time previous to its being actually sold.
C 7 I Persons having affixed their signatures to the lists of the descriptions of the
*' lots annexed to these presents, in token of their having become purchasers
for agents for purchasers) of the lots to which their signatures are respec-
tively so affixed, will be held to have previously obtained all necessary

date of sale to annul the sale of any lot or lots, and to repay to the purchaser
the amount of his purchase-money (or so much thereof as shall have been
paid by him), without interest, cost, or damages of any description, in full
satisfaction of all claims and demands whatsoever by such purchaser ; and
the publication of a notice in the Government Gazette to the effect that the
Governor has as aforesaid annulled any such sale shall be conclusive evidence
that such sale has been completely and effectually annulled.

Whereas it is expedient to rescind section 4, and sections 6 to 12 19.3.80,
inclusive, of Chapter VII., and Schedules 21, 22, 23, and 24 of the
Regulations dated the first day of April 1879 : And whereas many of the
leases heretofore issued under section 20 of The Land Act 1869 contain
the folloAviug condition, namely, ? Provided further and these presents
are upon this express condition that no assignment or transfer, whether
by operation of law or otherwise, of these presents, or other instrument
affecting the premises hereby demised, shall have any effect or validity
whatsoever, unless and until the Governor, acting by and with the
advice of the Executive Council, sanction the same, and further until
the same be registered in the office of Crown Lands, and all such
instruments as aforesaid shall have and take priority, not according to
their respective dates, but according to the priority of the registration
thereof,? or a condition to the like effect: And whereas it has heretofore
been the practice for the Minister of Lands to exercise a discretion as
to whether he would allow a mortgage or charge on any such lease to


be submitted for the sanction of the Governor in Council, in order to
give effect and validity to such mortgage or charge: And whereas such
practice has been found to work injuriously and to operate harshly upon
selectors and others: Now therefore His Excellency the Governor,
acting by and with the advice of the Executive Council, and in pur-
suance of the powers conferred on him under the provisions of the said
Act, doth hereby rescind section 4 and sections 6 to 12 inclusive of

dated the first day of April 1879, and doth make the following Regula-
tions in lieu thereof (that is to say): ?

tained in any lease or in any regulations heretofore made under the said
Act, all mortgages or charges upon any leases heretofore issued under
section 20 of such Act will be allowed by the Minister of Lands, and
submitted for the sanction of the Governor in Council, upon application
being made in the form prescribed in the First Schedule hereto.
2. Transfer of Leases. ?No transfer (except by operation of law) of
any leasehold estate heretofore or hereafter to be demised under section
20 of The Land Act 1869 shall have any effect or validity whatsoever
until such transfer shall have been sanctioned by the Governor in
Council and registered in the Crown Lands Office, Melbourne, and a
certificate of such registration, signed by the Secretary for Lands, shall
have been endorsed on the lease or certificate of title.
3. Form in which Notice to he given. ?The lessee shall apply to
transfer his lease in the form prescribed in the Second Schedule hereto
or to the like effect.
4. Fee for Certificate of Registration of Mortgage or Transfer. ?
The fee payable for a certificate of the registration of a mortgage or

line of a selection already marked on the ground the fee shall be half the fee for

6. If the plan of a selection can be rendered complete by adding to or excising
from a surveyed allotment the survey shall be limited to the survey of such
addition or excision, and the surveyor paid accordingly.
7. In cases where some trifling alteration or addition only is required to com-
plete the survey the amount payable to the Contract Surveyor shall be fixed by
the Inspecting District Surveyor subject to appeal to the Assistant Surveyor-
