ORDER OF SERVICE
HYMN
The strife is o’er, the battle done:
The victory of life is won:
The song of triumph has begun,-
Alleluia!
The powers of death have done their worst.
But Christ their legions hath dispersed;
Let shouts of holy joy outburst, —
Alleluia!
The three sad days have quickly sped;
He rises glorious from the dead;
All glory to our risen Head!
Alleluia!
He brake the age-bound chains of hell;
The bars from heaven’s high portals fell;
Let hymns of praise His triumph tell:
Alleluia!
Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee,
From death’s dread sting Thy servants free.
That we may live, and sing to Thee
Alleluia!
THE SENTENCES
PSALM 23
The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside
the waters of comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness, for his Name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.


I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
staff comfort me.
Thou shall prepare a table before me against them that trouble
me: thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall
be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be; world
without end. Amen.
LESSON
HYMN
Thou art the way, —to Thee alone
From sin and death we flee;
And he, who would the Father seek.
Must seek Him, Lord, by Thee.
Thou art the truth, —Thy word alone
True wisdom can impart;
Thou only canst inform the mind,
And purify the heart.
Thou art the life, —the rending tomb
Proclaims Thy conquering arm;
And those, who put their trust in Thee,
Nor death nor hell shall harm.
Thou art the way, the truth, the life;
Grant us that way to know,
That truth to keep, that life to win
Whose joys eternal flow. Amen.
ADDRESS
PRAYERS


Ten thousand times ten thousand.
In sparkling raiment bright.
The armies of the ransom’d saints
Throng up the steeps of light:
Tis finish’d, all is finish’d,
Their fight with death and sin:
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in.
What rush of Hallelujahs
Fills all the earth and sky;
What ringing of a thousand harps
Bespeaks the triumph nigh!
Oh day, for which creation
And all its tribes were made;
Oh joy, for all its former woes
A thousand-fold repaid!
Oh then what raptured greetings
On Canaan’s happy shore,
What knitting sever’d friendships up
Where partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimm’d with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless.
Nor widows desolate.
Bring near Thy great salvation,
Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
Fill up the roll of Thine elect,
Then take Thy power and reign
Appear, Desire of nations,
Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign:
Thou Prince and Saviour, come. Amen.
