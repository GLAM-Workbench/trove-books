Messrs. Williamson and Musgrove will have the honor of presenting
for the First Time to Sydney Playgoers the Famous Romantic Drama,
in 5 Acts, by Henry Hamilton, founded on Dumas’ Great Romance,
“ The Three Musketeers,” and entitled
The King's Musketeer
“ The King’s Musketeer” was played with enormons success an entire
season at the Garrick Theatre, London, having proved undoubtedly the
most powerful and popular version of “ The Three Musketeers ” yet
offered to the public, and it has now just completed it sixth week at the

Press and Public received the performance with acclamation, and united
in eulogising the Cast, Scenery and Costumes as forming a rare com-
bination of excellence, the consensus of opinion being that “ The King’s
Musketeer ” is the best and most stirring dramatic representation yet
presented in Australia.

Curling tongs dry the hair by removing
the natural oil, and crimping the hair
over hot iron sooner or later causes it to
crack and break. This is not a matter of
so great importance in young girls, whose
hair will grow again, but in the case of
older women, on whom the hair -is
beginning to thin out, it is apt to hasten
the fall of what remains and to cause
partial baldness over the forehead and
temples.

A new story of Ouida is going the
rounds. Once when her American
publisher, the late Mr. J. P. Lippincott,
was visiting her, he ventured, in the
course of a very friendly conversation, to
ask her how she came to know so much
about clubs, camp life, barracks, gambling-
houses, and other places which are only
visited by men. She placed her hands
upon her knees, and, looking straight at
her questioner, saucily said, “ It is none
of your business.”

thinks he can. The latter is the one

Thought He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe « On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way;
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay ray
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.*
Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reporlprial description the following day
in the*chief paper of the city.—“ New

When Henri Rochefort escaped from
New Caledonia the news of his landing at
Sydney was conveyed to Marshal
M’Mahon by D’Harcourt, who was
generally e opposed to be the real Pre-
sident of the French Republic. The
marshal, much concerned by this news,
said: —“ This is very serious ; we must
telegraph at once to the United States
' Government and see if extradition
cannot be obtained.” The faithful
vicomte whispered to his master— •'* But,
Monsieur le Marechal, Sydney is not in
the United States; it is in Australia.”
Whereupon the marshal, whose know-
ledge of geography had never been very
extensive, threw .up his arms and
exclaimed, in admiration :—“ That devil
of a Harcourt, he knows everything.”
