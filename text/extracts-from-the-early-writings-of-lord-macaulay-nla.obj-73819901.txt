LORD MACAULAY.
[From the "Athenaeum.?]
Earth will on Monday close over all that was
perishable of Thomas Babington, Baron Macaulay of
Temple Rothley. The dust is laid at the foot of
Addison?s statue in the venerable Abbey; the spirit
is abroad in the world, and Will not be laid so long
as the language in which it breathed is spoken of
men. As an historian Macaulay has few rivals; as
an essayist he has no rival. There is no rashness in
predicting for the sketches of Clive and Hastings a
safe literary immortality.
Macaulay, born in 1800, at Temple Rothley, in
Leicestershire, was the son of Zachary Macaulay, a
Presbyterian of stern principles and life.
His grandfather was a pastor in the kirk His mother
was a schoolmistress at Bristol. Her maiden name
was Mills; she was the daughter of a Quaker; and
being trained under the care of the Misses More
(Hannah More and her sisters) was an accomplished
and instructed woman for her class. Thus by distant
streams, the blood of professors in two of the most
severe and chastened sects in Europe, Covenanter
and Quaker, met in the veins of the wonderful boy.
His father?s sister being maried to Thomas Babington
a merchant, he received those names at the font.
Prom his birth it is said that he exhibited signs of
superiority and genius, and more especially of that
power of memory which startled every one by its
quickness, flexibility, and range. While he was yet a
a boy, he was in incessant request to ? tell books? to
his playmates. At that early date he would repeat


and declaim the longest ? Arabian Night,? as fluently
as Scheherazade herself. A little later he would
recite one of Scott?s novel story, characters, scenery
almost as well as though the book was in his hand.
But these were stolen and profane pleasures, not
encouraged, indeed barely tolerated, in the strict
conventual house. The household books were the
Bible, ? The Pilgrim?s Progress,? and a few Camero-
nian divines. An eager and dramatic appetite found
food for fancy in the allegories of Seripture, and even
in the dry sectarian literature of Scottish controversy.
Many a strong passage of description or vituperation
in his writings, salted as they arc with Biblical words,
shows how familiar he had been with Scripture
phraseology iii early youth. He himself used to tell
a funny story of a nursery scene. Por every one
who came to his father?s house he had a Biblical-
nick-name : Moses, Holofernes, Melchisedeck, and the
like. One visitor he called The Beast. Kind mamma,
prudent papa, frowned at their precocious child, and
set their brows against this offensive name; but
Thomas stuck to his point. Next time the Beast
made a morning call, the boy ran to the window,
which hung over the street ?to turn back
crowing with excitement and delight. ? Look here
mother,? cries the child, ? you see lam right. Look,
look at the number of the Beast!? Mrs. Macaulay
glanced at the hackney-coach; and behold, its number
was 666!
This faculty for histrionic narrative and persona-
tion grew upon him as he grew in years; and at the
proper time took its place among his literary
qualifications. From school he went to Cambridge,
where he earned reputation by his verses and hi s
oratory, and by his youthful contributions to Charles


Knight?s Quarterly Magazine. Among his rivals
and contemporaries where the Rev. J. Moultrie,
Mackworth Praed, Prof. Malden, and others now
known to fame. He graduated B.A. in 1822, M.A.
in 1826. He had already entered himself of Lincoln?s
Inn, and been called to the Bar.
His real entry into literature was through the gates
of the Edinburgh Review ; in his hand that paper on
Milton, which has so often puzzled the critics, and
of which he was himself in later life ashamed. It
was followed, during twenty years, by many other
papers; some written from books and some from life;
of which the best were unquestionably those on
Hastings and Clive, original efforts of genius work-
ing on new material, the gathering of his own eye and
ear in the country which they so splendidly de-
scribe.
On his political career we need not dwell. The
outlines of his course are in every ne vspaper and every
biographical dictionary. An article from his pen, on
the Ballot caught the eye of Lord Lansdowne, who
at once sought out the young barrister; brought him
to Parliament as Member for Caine, when the
Government made him Secretary to the Board of
Control for India; and secured his talents for the
service of the Whigs. This appointment was the
best party move in our generation.
He went to India for fortune, and came back to
England for fame. For a few years he hesitated
between letters and politics; serving as a burgess for
Edinburgh as well as writing articles for the Edin-
burgh Review. A quarrel with his supporters on
the question of endowing Maynooth broke his con-
nexion with the House of Commons and restored him
to literature. Once afterwards he became a Member


of the House, yet little more than a nominal Member
He spoke only once or twice, and then on points of
no large public moment.
For twelve years past his time had been given up
almost solely to his ?History of England.? Four
volumes have been published. Of late years, though
he is known to have worked closely upon the con-
tinuation, he has frequently turned aside for other
literary tasks, such as the memoirs on Oliver Gold-
smith and William Pitt for the new edition of the
Encyclopaedia Brifannica. As yet, it is uncertain to
what extent the materials left will be found available
for publication. If, as we hope, the narrative is
perfect down to the death of William the Third?
the book, though a mere fragment of the ? History of
England,? will, as a Life and Times of William,
possessa certain unity and completeness within itself.
The verdict of mankind on the merits of this
very considerable contribution to the ? History of
England? is not likely to be unanimous. The taste
of contemporaries is never decisive. Lord Macau-
lay?s ambition was to stand in the the same rank
with Hume. If a publisher?s balance-sheet proved
anything, his rank would be far higher than that of
Hume. The Messrs. Longmans have paid to him
the revenues of a prince. We have heard, on the
best authority, of one single cheque from publishers
to historian for twenty thousand pounds!
As a table-talker Lord Macaulay had a reputation
most peculiar. He was not witty, like Jerrold, nor
humorous, like Smith, nor poetical, like Moore, nor
dreamy, like Coleridge. He was narrative. He
was the troubadour of dining-rooms, who charmed
the company wiih a noble speech while they cracked
the nuts and passed the wine. In his conversation,


often lias it took the form of monologue, there was
no indication of arrogance on his part, or of desire to
monopolize the attention of everybody. The stream
welled forth out of the fullness of his mind and
prodigious memory. A quick and fertile intellect
got excited hy the applause of auditors and by the
vivacity of its own eloquence. When he launched
into any subject there was no hope of arresting his
voyage, nor any wish to do so. He would begin
with the remotest beginnings of the topic?Just as he
begins the History of the Reign of James the Second
with the Phoenicians?would gather strength and
substance as he went on, ?would pick up illustration
here and there from men and from hooks, leaving no
corner for objection to fasten on, no opportunity for
reply. There seemed no reason why the discourse
should ever cease; no more thanforthe Thamestorun
dry,or Time to pause. The talk had something of Mil-
ton?s organ-roll, and was only to be closed by Milton?s
organ-stop. It was not vivacious, so much as
flowing, suggestive and sonorously poetical. It was
like his Essays and his Lays?as a lady described it
to her friend?it was all print. Thus, though his
reputation for conversational opulence was great, few
of his sayings are abroad, or will survive the per-
sonal recollections of his friends.
In private life Lord Macaulay was amiable and
friendly. His kindness to men of letters, even to
those who had no claim on him, and in many in-
stances, very little claim on Literature, was above
price. His gifts of money in beneficence were on a
scale far beyond that of his fortune. It is the more
necessary to dwell on this fact, as he himself never
told of his good deeds; and common rumour ascribed
to him, most falsely, a cold and unkindly heart.


MACAULAY?S EARLY WRITINGS.
SONGS OF THE CIVIL WAR.
Here warlike cobblers railed from tops of casks
At lords and love-locks, monarchy and masques.?
There many a graceless page blaspheming reel?d,
From his dear cards and bumpers, to the field:
The famished rooks, impatient of delay,
Gnaw their cogg?d dice and curse the lingering prey;
His sad Andromache, with fruitless care,
Paints her wan lips and braids her borrowed hair;
For Church and King he quits his favourite arts,
Forsakes his Knaves, forsakes his Queen of Hearts:
For Church and King he burns to stain with gore
His doublet, stained with nought but sack before.
From a MS. Poem.
I. The Cavalier?s March to London.
To horse! to horse! brave Cavaliers!
To horse for Church and Crown!
Strike, strike your tents! snatch up your spears I
And oh for London town!
The imperial harlot, doom?d a prey
To our avenging fires,
Sends up the voice of her dismay
From all her hundred spires.


The Strand resounds with maiden?s shrieks,
The ?Change with merchants? sigiis,
And blushes stand on brazen cheeks,
And tears in iron eyes;
And, pale with fasting and with fright,
Each Puritan Committee
Hath summon?d forth to prayer and fight
The Roundheads of the City.
And soon shall London?s sentries hear
The thunder of our drum,
And London?s dames, in wilder fear,
Shall cry, Alack! They come!
Eling the fascines; ?tear up the spikes;
And forward, one and all,
Down, down with all their train-band pikes,
Down with their "mud-built wall.
Quarter? ?Eoul fall your whining noise,
Ye recreant spawn ot fraud!
No quarter! Think on Strafford, boys.
No quarter! Think on Laud.
What ho! The craven slaves retire.
On! Trample them to mud,
No quarter!? Charge quarter!? Fire.
No quarter! ?Blood!?Blood! ?Blood! ?
Where next? In sooth there lacks no witch.
Brave lads, to tell us where,
Sure London?s sons be passing rich,
Her daughters wondrous fair:
And let that dastard be the theme
Of many a board?s derision,
Who quails for sermon, cuff! or scream
Of any sweet Precisian.
Their lean divines, of solemn brow,
Sworn foes to throne and steeple,
From an unwonted pulpit now
Shall edify the people:
Till the tir?d hangman, in despair,
Shall'curse his blunted shears,
And vainly pinch, and scrape, and tear.
Around their leathern ears.


We?ll hang, about his own Guildhall,
The city?s grave Recorder,
And on the den of thieves we?ll fall,
Though Pym should speak to order.
In vain the lank-haired gang shall try
To cheat our martial law;
In vain shall Lenthall trembling cry
That strangers must withdraw.
Of bench and woolsack, tub and chair,
We?ll hold a glorious pyre,
And tons of rebel parchment there
Shall crackle in the fire.
With them shall perish, cheek by jowl,
Petition, psalm, and libel,
The Colonel?s canting muster-roll,
The Chaplain?s dog-ear?d bible.
We?ll tread a measure round the blaze
Where England?s pest expires,
And lead along the dances maze
The beauties of the friars:
Then smiles in every face shall shine,
And joy in every soul.
Bring forth, bring forth the oldest wine,
And crown the largest bowl.
And as with nod and laugh ye sip
The goblet?s rich carnation,
Whose bursting bubbles seem to tip
The wink of invitation;
Drink to those names, ?those glorious names, ?
Those names no time shall sever, ?
Drink in a draught as deep as Thames,
Our Church and King for ever
11. The Battle of Naseby, by Obadiah Bind-
THEIR-KINGS-IN-CHAINS-AND-THEIR-NOBLES-WlTH-
links-of-iron, Serjeant in Ireton?s Regiment.
Oh ! wherefore come ye forth, in triumph Irom the
North,
With your hands, and your feet, and your raiment
all red?


And wherefore doth your rout send forth a joyous
shout?
And whence he the grapes of the wine-press which
ye tread?
Oh evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit,
And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we
trod;
For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and
the strong,
Who sate in the high places and slew the saints
of God.
It was about the noon of a glorious day of June
That we saw their banners dance and their cui-
rasses shine,
And the man of blood was there, with his long
essenced hair.
And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of
the Rhine.
Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his
sword,
The General rode along us to form us for the fight.
When a murmuring sound broke out, and swell?d
into a shout,
Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant?s
right.
And hark like the roar of the billows on the shore !
The cry of battle rises along their charging line !
For God! for the Cause! for the Church! for the
Laws!
For Charles King of England, and Rupert of the
Rhine!
The furious German comes, with his clarions and his
drums,
His bravoes of Alsatia and pages of Whitehall;
They are bursting on our flanks. Grasp your pikes;
?Close your ranks ?
For Rupert never comes bpt to conquer or to fall,
They are here; ?they rush on.?We are broken;?
we are gone:?
Our left is borne before them like the stubble on
the blast.


O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the
right!
Stand hack to back, in God?s name, and fight it to
the last.
Stout Skippon hath a wound:?the centre hath given
ground:?
Hark! hark!? What means the trampling of horse-
men on our rear?
Whose banner do I see,boys? ?Tis he,thank God, ?tis
he, boys.
Bear up another minute. Brave Oliver is here.
Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a
row.
Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the
dykes
Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the Ac-
curst,
And at a shock have scattered the forest of his
pikes.
Last, fast the gallants ride, in some safe nook to hide
Their coward heads, predestined te rot on Temple-
Bar,
And he?he turns, he flies, ?shame to those cruel
eyes
That bore to look on torture and dare not look on
Ho! comrades, scour the plain: and, ere ye strip the
slain,
First give another stab to make your guest secure,
Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad-
pieces and lockets,
The token of the wanton, the plunder of the poor.
Fools, your doublets shone with gold, and your
hearts were gay and bold,
When ye kissed your lily hands to your lemans to-
day ;
And to-morrow shall the fox, from her chambers in
the rocks,
Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey.


Where he your tongues that late mocked at heaven
and hell and fate,
And the fingers that once were so busy with your
blades,
Your perfum?d satin clothes, your catches and your
oaths,
Your stage-plays and your sonnets, your diamonds
and your spades ?
Down, down, for ever down with the mitre and the
crown,
With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of
the Pope ;
There is woe in Oxford Halls : their is wail in
Durham?s Stalls :
The Jesuit smites his bosom : the Bishop rends
his cope.
And She of the seven hills shall mourn her children?s
ills,
And tremble when she thinks on the edge of Eng-
land?s sword ;
And the Kings of earth in fear, shall shudder when
they hear
What the hand of God hath wrought for the
Houses and the Word.
ROSAMOND.
0 Rosamond ! how sweet it were on some fine sum-
mer dawn
With thee to Avander, hand in hand, upon the dewy
lawn,
When flowers and heaps of new-mown grass perfume
the morning breeze,
And round the straw-built hive resounds the mur-
mer of the bees ;
To see the distant mountain-tops empurpled by the
ray,
And look along the spreading vale to the ocean far
away.
O?er russet heaths, and glancing rills, and mazy
forests green,
And curling smoke of cottages, and dark grey spires,
between.


And, ah ! how passing sweet it were, through the
long sunny day,
To gaze upon thy lovely face ?to gaze myself away ;
While thou beneath a mountain ash, upon a mossy
seat,
Shouldst sing a low wild song to me, reclining at thy
feet !
And, oh ! to see thee, in some mood of playful toil,
entwine
Round the green trellis of our bower, the rose and
eglantine
Still laying on my soul and sense a new and mystic
charrr,
At every turn of thy fairy shape and of thy snowy
arm !
And when the winds on winter nights in fitful ca-
dence blow,
And whirl against our frozen panes the eddying
flakes of snow,
How gay would be the fireside light, how sweet the
kettle?s moan,
Joined to the lustre of thy smile, the music ot thy
tone !
How fondly could I play for hours with thy long
curling tresses;
And press thy hand and clasp thy neck with fanciful
caresses,
And mingle low impassioned speech with kisses and
with sighs,
And pore into the dark-blue depths of those volup-
tuous eyes !
TO A FAIR GIRL OF FRANCE.
By thy love, fair girl of France,
And the arch and bashful glance
Which so well revealed it ;
By the flush upon thy brow ;
By the softly faltered vow,
And the kiss which sealed it ;


By those foreign accents dear,
Whose wild cadence on my ear
Still in slumber lingers ;
By thine eyes of sudden splendour ;
By the thrilling pressure tender
Of thy trembling fingers ;
By thy pouting ; by thy smiles ;
And by all the varied wiles
Which so sweetly won me ;
Laughter, blushes, sighs, caresses ;
By thy lips, and Jay thy tresses,
Sometimes think upon me !
Think upon the parting day,
And the tears I kissed away
From thy glowing cheek :
Thing of many a dearer token ;
Think of all that I have spoken,
All I may not speak 1
THE APOLOGUE OF GOMER CHEPHORAOD,
KING OF BABYLON.
About four hundred years after the deluge, king
Corner Chephoraod reigned in Babylon. He united
all the characteristics of an excellent sovereign. He
made good laws, won great battles, and whitewashed
long streets. He was, in consequence, idolized by
his people, and panegyrized by many poets and
orators. A book was then a serious undertaking.
Neither paper nor any similar material had been
invented. Authors were, therefore, under the
necessity of inscribing their compositions on massive
bricks. Some of these Babylonian records are still
preserved in European museums ; but the language
in which they are written has never been deciphered.
Gomar Chephoraod was so popular that the clay
of all the plains round the Euphrates could scarcely
furnish brick-kilns enough for his eulogists. It is
recorded, in particular, that Pharonezzar, the Assy-
rian Pindar,'published a bridge and four walls in his
praise.


One day the king was going in state from his
palace to the temple of Belus. During this proces-
sion it was lawful for any Babylonian to offer any
petition or suggestion to his sovereign. As the
chariot passed before a vintner?s shop, a large com-
pany, apparently half drunk, sallied forth into the
street, and one of them thus addressed the king :
? Gomar Chephoraod, live for ever ! It appears
to thy servants that, of all the productions of the
earth, good wine is the best, and bad wine is the
worst. Good wine makes the heart cheerful, the
eyes bright, the speech ready. Bad wine confuses
the head, disorders the stomach, makes us quarrel-
some at night, and sick the next morning. Now,
therefore, let my lord the king take order that thy
servants may drink good wine.?
And how is this to be done ?? said the good
natured-prince.
? 0 King,? said his monitor, ? this is most easy ;
let the king make a decree, and seal it with his royal
signet, and let it be proclaimed that the king will
give ten she-asses, and ten slaves, and ten changes of
raiment, every year, unto the man who shall make
ten measures of the best wine. And whosoever
wishes for the she-asses, and the slaves, and the rai-
ment, let him send the ten measures of wine to thy
servants, and we will drink thereof and judge. So
shall there be much good wine in Assyria.?
The project pleased Gomar Chephoraod. Be it
so,? said he. The people shouted ; the petitioners
prostrated themselves in gratitude. The same night
heralds were dispatched, to bear the intelligence to
the remotest districts of Assyria.
After a due interval the wines began to come in,
and the examiners assembled to adjudge the prize.
The first vessel was unsealed : its odour was such
that the judges, without tasting it, pronounced
unanimous condemnation. The next was opened :
it had villainous taste of clay. The third was sour
and vapid. They proceeded from one cask of exe-
crable liquor to another, until, at length, in absolute
nausea, they gave up the investigation.
The next morning they all assembled at the gate
of the king, with pale faces and aching heads. They


owned that they could not recommend any competi-
tor as worthy of the reward. They swore that the
wine was little better than poison, and entreated
permission to resign the office of deciding between
such detestable potions.
? In the name of Belus, how can this have hap-
pened ?? said the king.
Merolchazzar, the high-priest, muttered something
about the anger of the gods at the toleration shown
to a sect of impious heretics who ate pigeons broiled,
? whereas,? said he, ? our religion commands us to
eat them roasted. Now, therefore, O king,? con-
tinued this respectable divine, ? give command to
thy men of war, and let them smite the disobedient
people with the sword, them, and their wives, and
their children ; and let their houses, and their flocks,
and their herds, be given to thy servants the priests :
then shall the land yield its increase, and the fruits
of the earth shall be no more blasted by the ven-
gence of heaven.?
? Nay,? said the king, ? the ground lies under no
general curse from heaven ; the season has been
singularly good- The wine which thou didst thy-
self drink at the bunquet, a few nights ago, O vene-
rable Merolchazzar. was of this year?s vintage. Dost
thou not remember, thou did?st praise it ? It was
the same night that thou wast inspired by Belus,
and didst reel to and fro, and discoursed sacred
mysteries. These things are too hard for me. I
comprehend them not. The only wine which is bad
is that which is sent to my judges. Who can ex-
pound this to us ??
The king scratched his head. Upon which all
the courtiers scratched their heads.
He then ordered proclamation to be made that a
purple robe and a gold chain should be given to the
man who could solve this difficulty.
An old philosopher, who had been observed to
smile rather disdainfully when the prize had first
been instituted, came forward and spake thus
? Gomar Chephoraod, live for ever ! Marvel not
at that which has happened. It was no miracle, but
a natural event. How could it be otherwise ? It is
true that much good wine has been made this year.


but who would send it in for thy reward ? Thou
knowest Aseobaruch, who hath the great vineyards
in the north, and Cohahiroth, who sendeth wine
every year from the south over the Persian Gulf.
Their wines are so delicious that ten measures
thereof are sold for an hundred talents of silver.
Thinkest thou that they will exchange them for thy
slaves and thine asses ? What would thy prize
profit any who have vineyards in rich soils??
? Who, then,? said one of the judges, ? are the
wretches who sent us this poison.?
? Blame them not,? said the sage, ? seeing that
you have been the authors of the evil. They are
men whose lands are poor, and have never yielded
them any returns equal to the prizes which the king
proposed. Wherefore, knowing that the lords of
the fruitful vineyards would not enter into competi-
tion with them, they planted vines, some on rocks,
and some in light sandy soils, and some in deep clay.
Hence their wines are bad. Know, therefore, as-
suredly, that your prizes have increased the quan-
tity of bad but not of good wine.?
There was a long silence. At length the king
spoke. ? Give him the purple robe and the chain of
gold ; throw the Wines into the Euphrates ; and
proclaim that the Royal Society of Wines is dis-
solved,?
And here we conclude our first specimens of Un-
gaxhered Gold.
FRAGMENTS OF A ROMAN TALE.
It was an hour after noon. Ligarlus was return-
ing from the Campus Martius. He strolled through
one of the streets which led to the forum, settling
his gown, and calculating the odds on the gladiators
who where to fence at the approaching Saturnalia.
While thus occupied, he overtook Flaminius, who,
with a heavy step and a melancholy face, was saunter-
ing in the same direction. The light-hearted young
man plucked him by the sleeve.


? Good day, Flaminius. Are you to be of Catiline?s
party this evening ??
? Not I.?
?Why so ? Your little Tarentine girl will break
her heart.?
?No matter. Catiline has the best cooks and the
finest wine in Rome. There are charming women
at his parties. But the twelve-line board and the
dice-box pay for all. The Gods confound me if I did
not lose two millions of sesterces last night. My
villa at Tibur, and all the statues that my father the
praetor brought from Ephesus, must go to the Auc-
tioneer. That is a high price, you will acknowledge,
even for Phoenicopters, Chian, and Callinice.?
? High indeed, by Pollux.?
? And that is not the worst. I saw several of the
leading senators this morning. Strange things are
whispered in the higher political circles.?
? The Gods confound the political circles. I have
hated the name ot politician ever since Sylla?s proscrip-
tion, when I was within a moment of having my
throat cut b?r a politician, who took me for another
politician. While there is a cask of Falernianin
Campania, or a girl in the Suburra, I shall be too
well employed to to think on the subject.?
? You will do well,? said Flaminius gravely, ? to
bestow some little consideration on it at present.
Otherwise, I fear, you will soon renew your acquaint-
ance with politicians, in a manner auite as unpleasant
as that to which you allude.,?
? Averting Gods ! what do you mean ? ?
?� X will tell you. There are rumours of conspiracy
The order of things established by Lucius Sylla has
excited the disgust of the people, and a large party
of the nobles. Some violent convulsion is expected.?
? What is that to me ? I suppose that they will
hardly proscribe the vintners and gladiators, or pass
a law compelling every citizen to take a wife.?
? You do not understand. Catiline is supposed to
be the author of the revolutionary schemes. You
must have heard bold opinions at bistable repeatedly.?
??I never listen to any opinions upon such subjects
bold or timid.?
? Look to it. Your name has been mentioned.?


? Mine ! good Gods ! I call heaven to witness that
I never so much as "mentioned Senate, Consul, or
Comitia, in Catiline?s house.?
? Nobody suspects you of any participation in the
inmost councils of the party. But our great men
surmise that you are among those whom he has brib-
ed so high with beauty, or entangled so deeply in
distress, that they are no longer their own masters.
I shall never set foot within his threshold again. I
have been solemlny warned by men who understand
public affairs ; and I advise you to be cautious.?
The friends had now turned into the forum, which
was thronged with the gay and elegant youth of
Rome. ? I can tell you more,? continued Flaminius;
? somebody was remarking to the Consul y esterday
how loosely a certain acquaintance of ours tied his
girdle. ?Let him look to himself,? said Cicero, ?or
the state may find a tighter girdle for his neck.? ?
? Good Gods ! who is it ? You cannot surely
mean??
? There he is.?
Flaminius pointed out a man who was passing up
and down the forum at a little distance from them.
He was in the prime of manhood. His personal ad-
vantages were extremely striking, and were display-
ed with an extravagant but not ungraceful foppery.
His gown waved in loose folds ; his long dark curls
were dressed with exqnisite art, and shone and steam-
ed with odours ; his step and gesture exhibited an
elegant and commanding figure in every posture of
polite languor. But his countenance formed a
singular contrast to the general appearance of his
person. The high and imperial brow, the keen aqui-
line features, the compressed mouth, the penetrating
eye, indicated the highest degree of ability and de-
cision. He seemed absorbed in intense meditation.
With eyes fixed on the ground, and lips working in
thought, he sauntered round the area, apparently un -
conscious how many of the ?young gallants of Rome
were envying the taste of his dress, and the ease of
his fashionable swagger.
? Good Heaven ! ? said Ligarius, ? Caius Caesar
is as unlikely to be in a plot as I am.?
? Not at all.?


?He does nothing hut game, feast, intrigue, read
Greek, and write verses.?
? You know nothing of Caesar. Though he rarely
addresses the Senate, he is considered as the best
speaker there, after the Consul. His influence with
the multitude is immense. He will serve his rivals
in public life as he served me last night at Catiline?s.
We were playing at the twelve-lines .* ?Immense
stakes. He laughed all the time, chatted with
Valeria over bis shoulder, kissed her hand between
every two moves, and scarcely looked at the board,
I thought that I had him. All at once I found my
counters driven into the corner. Not a piece to move,
by Hercules. It cost me two millions of Sesterces.
All the Gods and Goddesses confound him for it! ?
?As to Valeria,? .said Ligarius, ?I forgot to ask
whether you have heard the news.?
? Not a word. What ? ?
? I was told at the baths to-day that Caesar escort-
ed the lady home. Unfortunatly old Quintus Lutatius
had come back from his villa in Campania, in a whim
of jealousy. He was not expected for three days.
There was a fine tumult. The old fool called for his
sword and slaves, cursed his wife, and swore that
he would cut Caesar?s throat,?
? And Caesar. ? ?
? He laughed, quoted Anacreon, trussed his gown
round his left arm,! closed with Quintius, flung him
down, twisted his sword out of his hand, burst through
the attendants, ran a freed-man through the shoulder,
and was in the street in an instant.?
Well done ! here he comes. Good day, Caius.?
Caesar lifted his head at the salutation. His air of
deep abstraction vanished, and he extended a hand to
each of the friends.
? How are you after yonr last night?s exploit ? ?
? As well as possible,? said Caesar laughing
?In truth we should rather ask how Quintus
Lutatius is.?
?He, I understand, is as well as can be expected
* ? Duodecim scripta,? a game of mixed chance and skill,
which seems to have been very fashionable in the higher
circles of Rome. The famous lawyer, Mucius, was re-
nowned for his skill in it.?(Cic. Orat. L- 50.)


of a man with a faithless spouse and a broken head.
His freed-man is more seriously hurt. Poor fellow !
he shall have half of whatever I win to-night. Flam-
inius, you shall have your revenge at Catiline?s.?
? You are very kind. I do not intend to be at
Catiline?s till I wish to part with my town-house.
My villa is gone already.?
? Not at Catiline?s, base spirit! You are not of his
mind, my gallant Ligarius. Dice, Chian, and the
loveliest Greek singing-girl that was ever seen.
Think of that Ligarius. By Venus, she almost made
me adore her, by telling me that I talked Greek with
the most Attic accent that she had heard in Italy.?
? I doubt she will not say the same of me,? replied
Ligarius. ?I am just as able to decipher an obelisk
as to read a line of Homer.?
? You barbarous Scythian, who had the care of
your education ? ?
?An old fool, ?a Greek pedant,?a stoie. He told
me that pain was no evil, and flogged me as if he
thought so. At last one day, in the middle of a lec-
ture, I set fire to his enormous filthy beard, singed
his face, and sent him roaring out of the house.
There ended ray studies. From that time to this-1
have had as little to do with Greece, as the wine that
your poor old friend Lutatius calls his delicious
Samian.?
?Well d< ne, Ligarius. I hate a Stoic. I wish
Marcus Cato had a beard that you might singe it for
him. The fool talked his two hours in the Senate
yesterday, without changing a muscle of his face.
He looked as savage and as motionless as the mask
in which Roscius acted Alecto. I detest every thing
connected with him.?
? Except his sister Servilia.?
? True. She is a lovely woman.?
? They say that you have told her so, Cams.?
? So 1 have.?
? And that she was not angry.?
? What woman is ? ?
? Ay,?but they say??
?No matter what they say. Common fame lies
like a Greek rhetorician. You might know so much,
Ligarius, without reading the philosophers. But


come, I will introduce you to little dark-eyed Zoe.?
? I tell you I can speak no Greek.?
? More shame for you. It is high time that you
should begin. You will never have such a charming
instructress. Ofwhat wasyour father thinking when
he sent for an old Stoic with a long beard to teach
you ? There is no language-mistress like a handsome
woman, When I was at Athens, I learnt more Greek
from a pretty 'flower- girl in the Peiraeus, than from
all the Portico and Academy. She was no Stoic,
Heaven knows. But come along to Zoe. I will be
your interpreter. Woo her in honest Latin, and I
will turn it into elegant Greek between the throws
of dice. I can make love and mind my game at once,
as Plaminius can tell you.?
? Well then, to be plain, Caesar, Plaminius has been
talking to me about plots, and suspicions, and politic-
ians. I never plagued myself about such things since
Sylla?s and Marius?s days ; and then I could never
see much difference between the parties. All that I
am sure of is, that those who meddle with such affairs
are generally stabbed or strangled. And though I
like Greek wine and handsome women, Ido not wish
to risk my neck for them. Now, tell me as a friend,
Cains ; ?is there no danger ? ?
? Danger ! ? repeated Caesar, with a short, fierce,
disdainful laugh, ?what danger do you apprehend ??
? That you should best know,? said Plaminius ;
? you are far more intimate with Catiline than I.
But I advise you to be cautious. The leading men
entertain strong suspicions.?
Caesar drew up his figure from its ordinary state
of graceful relaxation into an attitude of commanding
dignity, and replied in a voice of which the deep and
impassioned melody formed a strange contrast to the
humourous and affected tone of his ordinary conver-
sation. ? Let them suspect. They suspect because
they know what they have deserved. What have
they done for Rome ? ?What for mankind ??Ask
the citizens. Ask the provinces. Have they had
any other object than to perpetuate their own ex-
clusive power, and to keep us under the yoke of an
oligarchical tyranny, which unites in itself the worst
evils of every other system, and combines more than


Athenian turbulence with more than Persian des-
potism ? ?
?Good Gods! Caasar. It is not safe for you to speak,
or for us to listen to such things, at such a crisis.?*
? Judge for yourselves what you will hear. I will
judge for myself what I will speak. I was not twenty
years old when I defied Lucius Sylla, surrounded by
the spears of legionaries and the daggers of assassins.
Do you suppose that I stand in awe of his paltry
successors, who have inherited a power which they
never could have accquired ; who would imitate his
proscriptions, though they have never equalled his
conquests ? ?
? Pompey is almost as little to be trifled with as
Sylla. I heard a consular senator say, that, in con-
sequence of the present alarming state of affairs, he
would probably be re-called from the command as-
signed to him by the Manilian law.?
? Let him come, ?the pupil of Sylla?s butcheries, ?
the gleaner of Lucullus?s trophies,?the thief-taker of
the Senate.?
? For heavens sake, Caius ! ?if you knew what the
Consul said??
? Something about himself, no doubt. Pity that
such talents should be coupled with such cowardice
and such coxcombry. He is the finest speaker liv-
ing,?infinitely superior to what Hortensius was, in
his best days ; ?a charming companion, except when
he tells for the twentieth time all the jokes that he
made at Yerres?s trial. But he is the despicable
tool of a despicable party.?
? Your language, Caius, convinces me that the re-
ports which have been circulated are not without
foundation. I will venture to prophecy that within
a few months the republic will pass through a whole
Odyssey of strange adventures.?
? I believe so ; an Odyssey of which Pompey will
be the Polyphemus, and Cicero the Syren. I would
have the state imitate Ulysses?show no mercy to
the former ; but contrive, if it can be done, to listen
to the enchanting voice of the other, without being
seduced by it to destruction.?
? But whom can your party produce as rivals to
these two famous leaders ? ?


? Time will show. I would hope that there may
arise a man, whose genius to conquer, to conciliate,
and to govern, may unite in one cause an oppressed
and divided people ; ?may do all that Sylla should
have done, and exhibit the magnificent spectacle of
a great nation directed by a great mind.?
� And where is such a man to be found ? ?
? Perhaps where you would least expect to find
him. Perhaps he may be one whose powers have
hitherto been concealed in domestic or literary re-
tirement. Perhaps he may be one, who, while wait-
ing for some adequate excitement, for some worthy
opportunity, squanders on trifles a genius, before
which may yet be humbled the sword of Pompey
and the gcwn of Cicero. Perhaps he may now be
disputing with a sophist ? perhaps prattling with a
mistress ? perhaps ?! and, as he spoke, he turned
away, and resumed his lounge, ? strolling in the
Forum.?
*****
It was almost midnight. The party had separated.
Catiline and Cethegus were still conferring in the
supper-room, which was, as usual, the highest apart-
ment of the house. It formed a cupola, from which,
windows opened on the flat roof that surrounded it.
To this terrace Zoe had retired. With eyes dimmed
by fond and melancholly tears, she leaned over the
balustrade, to catch the last glimpse of the departing
form of Caesar, as it grew more and more indistinct
in the moonlight. Had he any thought of her ?
Any love for her ? He, the favourite of the high-
born beauties of Rome, the most splendid, the most
graceful, the most eloquent of its nobles ? It could
not be. His voice had, indeed, been touchingly soft
whenever he addressed her. There had been a fasci-
nating tenderness even in the vivacity of his look
and conversation. But such were always the man-
ners of Caesar towards women. He had wreathed a
sprig of myrtle in her hair as she was singing. She
took it from her dark ringlets, and kissed it, and wept
over it, and thought of the sweet legends of her own
dear Greece,?of youths and girls, who, pining away
in hopeless love, had been transformed into flowers
by the compassion of the Gods ; and she wished to


become a flower which Caasar might sometimes touch,
though he should touch it only to weave a crown for
some prouder and happier mistress.
She was roused from her musings by the loud step
and voice of Cethegus, who was pacing furiously up
and down the supper-room.
? May all the Gods confound me, if Caasar be not
the deepest traitor, or the most miserable idiot, that
ever intermeddled with a plot! ?
Zoe shuddered. She drew nearer to the window.
She stood concealed from observation by the curtain
of fine network which hung over the aperture, to
exclude the annoying insects of the climate.
? And you, too ! ? continued Cethegus, turning
fiercely on his accomplice ; ? you to take his part
against me !?you, who proposed the scheme your-
self!?
? My dear Caius Cethegus, you will not understand
me. I proposed the scheme, and I will join in exe-
cuting it. But policy is as necessary to our plans
as boldness. I did not wish to startle Csesar?to lose
his co-operation?perhaps to send him off with an
information against us to Cicero or Catullus. Be
was so indignant at your suggestion,that all my dis-
simulation was scarcely sufficient to prevent a total
rupture.?
? Indignant! The Gods confound him !?he prat-
ed about humanity, and generosity, and moderation.
By Hercules, 1 have not heard such a lecture since I
was with Xenechares at Rhodes.?
? Csesar is made up of inconsistencies. He has
boundless ambition, unqestioned courage, admirable
sagacity. Yet I have frequently observed in him a
womanish weakness at the sight of pain. I remem-
ber that once one of his slaves was taken ill while
carrying his litter. He alighted, put the fellow in
his place, and walked home in a fall of snow. I
wonder that you could be so ill-advised as to talk to
him of massacre, and pillage, and conflagration.
You might have foreseen that such propositions
would disgust a man of his temper.?
?I do not know. I have not your self-command
Lucius. I hate such conspirators. What is the use
of them ? We must have blood?blood, ?hacking
.and tearing work?bloody work ! ?


?Do not grind your teeth, my dear Cains ; and
lay down tlie carving knife. By Hercules, yon have
cut up all the stuffing of the couch.?
?No matter ; we shall have couches enough
soon?and down to stuff them?and purple to cover
them, ?and pretty women to 101 l on them, ?unless
this fool, and such as he, spoil our plans. I had
something else to say. The essenced fop wishes to
seduce Zoe from me.?
�Impossible ! You misconstrue the ordinary
gallantries which he is in the habit of paying to
every handsome face.?
? Curse on his ordinary gallantries, and his verses,
and his compliments, and his sprigs of myrtle ! If
Caesar should dare ?by Hercules, I will tear him to
pieces in the middle of the Forum.?
?Trust his destruction to me. We must use his
talents and influence?thrust him upon every dan-
ger?make him our instrument while we are contend-
ing?our peace-oflering to the Senate if we fail?
our first victim if we succeed.?
? Hark ! what noise was that ? ?
? Sombody in the terrace !?lend me your dagger.?
Catiline rushed to the window. Zoe was standing
in the shade. He stepped out. She darted into the
room?passed like a flash of lightening by the start-
led Cethegus?flew down the stairs?through the
court ?through the vestibule ?through the street.
Steps, voices, lights, came fast and confusedly behind
her ?_but with the speed of love and terror she gain-
ed upon her pursuers. She fled through the wilder-
ness of unknown and dusky streets, till she found her-
self, breathless and exhausted, in the midst of a
crowd of gallants, who, with chaplets on their heads,
?were reeling from the portico of a stately mansion.
The foremost of the throng was a youth whose
slender figure and beautiful countenance seemed
hardly consistent with his sex. But the feminine
delicacy of his features rendered more frightful the
mingled sensuality and ferocity of their expression.
The libertine audacity of his stare, the grotesque fop-
pery of his apparel, seemed to indicate, at least, a par-
tial in sanity. Flinging one arm round Zoe, and tear-
ing away her veil with the other, he disclosed to the


gaze of his thronging companions the regular features
and large dark eyes which characterise Atheian
beauty.
? Clodius has all the luck to night,? cried Ligarius.
? Not so, by Hercules,? said Marcus Coelius ; ?the
girl is fairly our common prize ; we will fling dice
for her. The Venus* throw, as it ought to do, shall
decide.?
? Let me go?let me go, for Heaven?s sake,,? cried
Zoe, strugling with Clodius.
? What a charming Greek accent she has. Come
into the house, my little Atheian nightingale.?
?Oh ! what will become of me ? If you have
mothers?if you have sisters ?
? Clodius has a sister,? muttered Ligarius, ? or he
is much belied.?
? By Heaven, she is weeping,? said Clodius.
? And if she where vestal virgin,? cried Clodius
fiercely ; ?It should not deter me. This way;?no
struggling?no screaming.?
? Struggling screaming ! ? exclaimed a gay and
commanding voice ; ? You are making very ungentle
love, Clodius.?
The whole party started. Cassar had mingled
with them unperceived,
The sound of his voice thrilled through the very
heart of Zoe. With a convulsive effort she burst
from the grasp of her insolent admirer, flung herself
at the feet of Caesar, and clasped his knees. The
moon shone full on her agitated and imploring face;
her lips moved, but she uttered no sound. He gazed
at her for an instant?raised her ?clasped her to his
bosom. Fear nothing, my sweet Zoe.? Then with
folded arms, and a smile of placid defiance, he placed
himself between her and Clodius.
Clodius staggered forward, flushed with wine and
rage, and uttering alternately a curse and a hiccup.
?By Pollux this passes a jest. Caesar, how dare
you insult me thus ??
? A jest ! lam as serious as a Jew on the Sab-
bath. Insult you For such a pair of eyes I would
* Venus was the Roman term for the highest throw on
the dice.


insult the whole consular bench, or I should he as
insensible as King Psammis?s mummy.?
? Good Gods, Caesar I? said Marcus Coelius, inter-
posing ; ? you cannot think it worth while to get
into a brawl for a little Greek girl !?
?Why not? the Greek girls have used me as
well as those of Rome. Besides, the whole reputa-
tion of my gallantry is at stake. Give up such a
lovely woman to that drunken boy ! My character
would be gone for ever. No more perfumed tab-
lets, full of vows and raptures ! No more toying
with fingers at the Circus, No more evening walks
along the Tiber. No more hiding in chests, or
lumping from windows. I, the favoured suitor of
half the white stoles in Rome, could never again as-
pire above a freed-woman. You a man of gallantry,
and think of such a thing ! For shame, ray dear
Coelius ! Do not let Clodia hear of it.?
While Caesar spoke he had been engaged keeping
Clodius at arm?s length. The rage of the frantic liber-
tine increased as the struggle continued. ? Stand
back as you value your life,? he cried ; ? I will pass.?
?Not this way, sweet Clodius. I have too much
regard for you to suffer you to make love at such dis-
advantage. You smell too much of Falernian at
present. Would you stifle your mistress ? By Her-
cules, you are fit to kiss nobody now, except old Piso,
when he is tumbling home in the morning from the
vintners.?*
Clodius plunged his hand into his bosom, and drew
a little dagger, the faithful companion of many des-
perate adventures.
? Oh Gods ! he will be murdered ; ? cried Zoe.
The whole throng of revellers was in agitation:
the street fluctuated with torches and lifted hands.
It was but a moment. Csesar watched with a steady
eye the descending hand of Clodius, arrested the blow,
seized his antagonist by the throat, and flung him
against one of the pillars of the portico with such
violence, that he rolled, stunned and senseless, on the
ground.
?He is killed,? cried several voices.
* Cic. in Pis.


? Fair self-defence, by Hercules ! ? said Marcus
Coelus. ? Bear witness, you all saw him draw his
dagger.? -
? He is not dead?he breaths, ? said Ligarius.
? Carry him into the house ; he is dreadfully bruised.?'
The rest of the party retired with Clodius, Coelius
turned to Cassar.
*? By all the Gods, Caius ! you have won your lady
fairly. A splendid victory ! You deserve a triumph.?
? What a madman Clodius has become I?
?Intolerable. But come and sup with me on the
Nones. Have you no objections to meet the Consul ??
? Cajsar ! None at ail. We need not talk politics.
Our old dispute about Plato and Epicurus will furnish
us with plenty of conversation. So reckon upon me,
my dear Marcus, and farewell.?
Csesar and Zoe turned 'away. As soon as they
were out of hearing, she began in great agitation :??
? Csesar, you are in danger. I know all. I over-
heard Catiline and Cethegus. You are engaged in a
project which must lead to certain destruction.?
? My beautiful Zoe, I live only for glory and plea-
sure. For these I have never hesitated to hazard an
existence which they alone render valuable to me.
In the present case, I can assure you that our scheme
presents tbe fairest hopes ot success. ?
?So much the worse. You do not know?you do
not understand me. I speak not of open peril, but
of secret treachery. Catiline hates you ; ?Cethegus
hates you j ?your destruction is resolved. If you
survive the contest, you perish in the first hour of
victory. They detest you for your moderation ;
they are eagar for blood and plunder. I have risked
my life to bring you this warning ; but that is of
little moment. Farewell!?Be happy !?
Caosar stopped her. ?Do you fly from my thanks,
dear Zoe ??
? I wish not for your thanks, but for your safety;
?I desire not to defraud Valeria or Servilia of one
caress, extorted from gratitude or pity. Be my feel-
ings what they may, I have learnt in a fearful
school to endure and to suppress them. I have
been taught to abase a proud spirit to the claps and
hisses of the vulgar ; to smile on suitors vho united


the insults of a dispicable pride to the endearments
of a loathsome fondness ; ?to affect sprightliness
with an aching head, and eyes from which tears
were ready to gush ; ?to feign love, with curses on
my lips, and madness in my brain. Who feels for
me any esteem ?any tenderness ? Who will shed a
tear over the nameless grave which will shelter from
cruelty and scorn the broken heart of the poor
Athenian girl ? but you, who alone have addressed
her in her degradation in a voice of kindness and re-
spect, farewell. Sometimes think of me, ?not with
sorrow ; ?no : I could bear your ingratitude, but not
distress. Yet, if it will not pain you too much, in
distant days, when your lofty hopes and destinies
are accomplished,?on the evening of some mighty
victory,?in the chariot of somemagniflcent triumph,
?think on one that loved you with that exceeding
love which only the miserable can feel. Think that,
wherever her exhausted frame may have sunk be-
neath the sensibilities of a tortured spirit,?in what-
ever hovel or whatever vault she may have closed
her eyes,?whatever strange scenes of horror and
polution may have surrounded her dying bed, your
shape was the last that swam before her sight?
your voice the last sound that was ringing in her
ears. Yet turn your face to me, Ca3sar. Let me
carry away one last look of those features, and then
? He turned round. He looked at her. He
hid his face on her bosom, and burst into tears.
With sobs long and loud, and convulsive as those of
a terrified child, he poured forth on her bosom the
tribute of impetuous and uncontrollable emotion. He
raised his head ; but he in vain struggled to restore
composure to the brow which had confronted the
frown of Sylla, and the lips which had rivalled the
eloquence of Cicero. He several times attempted to
speak, but in vain ; and his voice still faltered with
tenderness, when, after a pause of several minutes,
he thus addressed her .
? My own dear Zoe, your love has been bestowed
on one who, if he cannot merit, can at least appre-
ciate and adore you. Beings of similar loveliness,
and similar devotedness of affection, mingled, in all
my boyish dreams of greatness, with visicns of


curule chairs and ivory cars, marshalled legions
and laurelled fasces. Such I have endeavoured to
find in the world; and, in their stead, I have met
with selfishness, with vanity, with frivolity, with
falsehood. The life which you have preserved is
a boon less valuable than the affection ?
?Oh ! Csesar,? interrupted the blushing Zoe,
? think only on your own security at present, If
you feel as you speak,?but you are only mock-
ing me, ?or perhaps your compassion "
? By Heaven ! ?by every oath that is binding ?
? Alas ! alas ! Caesar, were not all the same
oaths sworn yesterday to Valeria ? But I will
trust you, at least so far as to partake your pre-
sent dangers. Flight may be necessary : ?form
your plans. Be they what they may, there is one
who, in exile, in poverty, in peril, asks only to wan-
der, to beg, to die with you.?
?My Zoe, I do not anticipate any such necessity.
To renounce the conspiracy without renouncing the
principles on which it was originally undertaken ;
?to elude the vengeance of the Senate without losing
the confidence of the people, is, indeed, an arduous
but not an impossible task. I owe it to myself
and to my country to make the attempt, There
is still ample time for consideration. At present 1
am too happy in love to think of ambition or danger,?
They had reached the door of a stately palace,
Caesar struck it. It was instantly opened by a slave.
Zoe found herself in a magnificent hall, surrounded
by pillars of green marble, between which were rang-
ed the statues of the long line of Julian nobles.
? Call Endymion,? said Caesar.
The confidential freed-man made his appearance,
not without a slight smile, which his patron?s good
nature emboldened him to hazard, at perceiving the
beautiful Athenian.
? Arm my slaves. Endymion ; there are reasons for
precaution. Let them relieve each other on guard
during the night. Zoe, my love, my preserver, why
are your cheeks so pale ? Let me kiss some bloom
into them. How you tremble ! Endymion. a flask
of Samain and some fruit. Bring them to my apart-
ments. This way my sweet Zoe.?

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT LAW-
SUIT BETWEEN THE PARISHES OF
ST. DENNIS
AND ST. GEORGE IN THE WATER.
The parish of St. Dennis is one of the most
pleasant parts of the country in which it is situated.
It is fertile, well wooded, well watered and ot an ex-
cellent air. For many generations the manor had
been holden in tail-male by a worshipful family, who
have always taken precedence of their neighbours at
the races and the sessions.
In ancient times the affairs of this parish were
administered by a Court-Baron, in which the free-
holders were judges* and the rates were levied by
select vestries of the inhabitant householders. But
at length these good customs fell into disuse. The
Lords of the Manor, indeed, still held courts for
form?s sake, but they or their stewards had the whole
management of affairs. They demanded services,
duties, and customs, to which they had no just title.
Nay, they would often bring actions against their
neighbours for their own private advantage, and then
send in the bill to the parish. No objection was
made, during many years, to these proceedings, so
that the rates became heavier and heavier: nor was
any person exempted from these demands, except
the footmen and gamekeepers of the squire and rector
of the parish. They indeed were never checked
in any excess. They would come to an honest
labourer?s cottage, eat his pancakes, tuck his fowls
into their pockets, and cane the poor man himself.
If he went up to the great house to complain, it was
hard to get speech of Sir Lewis; and, indeed, his
only chance of being righted was to coax the squire?s
pretty housekeeper, who could do what she pleased
with her master. If he ventured to intrude upon
the Lord of the Manor without this precaution, he
gained nothing for his pains. Sir Lewis, indeed,
would at first receive him with a civil face; for, to
give him his due, he could be a fine gentleman when
he pleased., ? Good day, my friend;? he would say,
?what situation have you in my family?? ?Bless
your honour!? says the poor fellow, ? I am not one


of your honour?s servants; I rent a small piece of
ground, your honour.? ? Then you dog,? quoth the
squire, "?what do mean by coming here? Has a
gentleman nothing to do but to hear the complaints
of clowns? Here! Philip, James, Dick, toss this
fellow in a blanket; or duck him, and set him in the
stocks to dry.?
One of these precious Lords of the Manor enclosed
a deer-park, and in order to stock it, he seized all the
pretty pet fawns that his tenants had brought up,
without paying them a farthing, or asking their leave.
It was a sad day for the parish of St. Dennis. In -
deed, I do not believe that all his oppressive exactions
and long bills enraged the poor tenants so much as
this cruel measure.
Yet for a long time, in spite of all these inconve-
niences, St. Dennis?s was a very pleasant place. The
people could not refrain from capering if they heard
ttie sound of a fiddle. And, if they were inclined to
be riotous. Sir Lewis had only to send for Punch,
or the dancing dogs, and all was quiet again. But
this could not last for ever; they began to think
more and more of their condition; and, at last, a
club of foul-mouthed, good-for-nothing rascals was
held at the sign of the Devil, for the purpose of
abusing the squire and the parson. The doctor, to
own the truth, was old and indolent, extremely fat
and greedy. He had not preached a tolerable sermon
for a Jong time. The squire was still worse: so that,
partly by truth and partly by falsehood, the club set
the whole parish against their superiors. The boys
scrawled caricatures of the clergyman upon the
church-door, and shot at the landlord with pop-guns
as he rode a hunting. It was even whispered about
that the Lord of the Manor had no right to his estate,
and that, if he were compelled to produce the original
title-deeds, it would be found that he only held the
estate in trust for the inhabitants of the parish.
In the mean time the squire was pressed more and
more for money. The parish could pay no more.
The rector refused to lend a farthing. The Jews
were clamorous for their money; and the landlord
had no other resource then to call together the in-
habitants of the parish, and to request their assistance,


They now attacked him furiously about their griev-
ances, and insisted that he should relinquish his
oppressive powers. They insisted that his footmen
should be kept in order, and that the parson should
pay his share of the rates, that the children of the
parish should be allowed to fish in the trout-stream,
and to gather blackberries in the hedges. They at
last went so far as to demand that he should ac-
knowledge that he held his estate only in trust for
them. His distress compelled him to submit. They,
in return, agreed to set him free from his pecuniary
difficulties, and to suffer him to inhabit the manor-
house ; and only annoyed him from time to time
by singing impudent ballads under his window.
The neighbouring gentlefolks did not look on these
proceedings with much complacency. It is true that
Sir Lewis and his ancestors had plagued them with
law-suits, and affronted them at county-meetings.
Still they preferred the insolence of a gentleman to
that of the rabble, and felt some uneasiness lest the
example should infect their own tenants.
A large party of them met at the house of Lord
Caesaf Germain. Lord Caesar was the proudest man
in the county. His family was very ancient and
illustrious, though not particularly opulent. He had
invited most of his wealthy neighbours. There was
Mrs. Kitty North, the relict of poor Squire Peter,
respecting whom the coroner?s jury had found a
verdict of accidental death, but whose fate neverthe-
less excited strange whispers in the neighbourhood.
There was Squire Don, the owner of the great West
Indian property, who was not so rich as he had
formerly been, but still retained his pride, and kept
up his customary pomp; so that he had plenty of
plate but no breeches. There was Squire Von
Blunderbussen, who had succeeded to the estates of
his uncle, old Colonel Frederic Von Blunderbussen
of the hussars. The colonel was a very singular old
fellow; he used to learn a page of Chambaud?s gram-
mar, and to translate Telemaque every morning, and
he kept six French masters to teach him to parleyvoo.
Nevertheless, he was a shrewd clever man, and im-
proved his estate with so much care, sometimes by
honest and sometimes by dishonest means, that he
left a pretty property to his nephew.


Lord Crcsar poured out a glass of Tokay for Mrs.
Kitty. ? Your health, my dear madam, I never saw
you look more charming. Pray what think you of
these doings at St. Dennis?s??
?Pine doings! indeed!? interrupted Yon�lunder-
bussen, ? I wish that we had my old uncle alive, he
would have had some of them up to the halberts.
He knew how to use a cat-o?-nine-tails. If things
go on in this way, a gentleman will not be able to
horsewhip an impudent farmer, or to say a civil word
to a milk-maid.?
? Indeed, it?s very true, Sir;? said Mrs. Kitty, ?their
insolence is intolerable. Look at me for instance: ?
a poor lone woman! ?My dear Peter dead! I loved
him : ?so I did; and when he died, I was so hysterical
you cannot think. And now I cannot lean on the
arm of a decent footman, or take a walk with a tall
grenadier behindme, just to protect me from audacious
vagabonds, but they must have their nauseous sus-
picions;?odious creatures!? ?
? This must he stopped,? replied Lord Caesar. ?We
ought to contribute to support my poor brother -in-
law against these rascals. I will write to Squire
Guelf on this subject by this night?s post. His name
is always at the head of our county subscriptions.
If the people of St, Dennis?s had been angry before
they were well nigh mad when they heard of this
conversation. The whole parish ran to the manor-
house. Sir Lewis?s Swiss porter shut the door against
them; but they broke in and knocked him on the
head for his impudence. They then seized the squire,
hooted at him, poked him, ducked him, and carried
him to the watch-house. They turned the rector
into the street, burnt his wig and band, and sold the
church plate by auction. They put up a painted
Jezebel in the pulpit to preach. They scratched out
the texts which were written round the church, and
scribbled profane scraps of songs and plays in their
place. They set the organ playing to pot-house
tunes. Instead of being decently asked in church,
they were mairied over a broomstick. But of all their
whims, the use of the new patent steel-traps was the
most remarkable.
This trap was constructed on a completely new


principle. It consisted of a cleaver hung in a frame
like a window; when any poor wretch got in, down
it came with a tremendous din, and took olf his head
in a twinkling. They got the squire into one of these
machines. In order to prevent any of his partisans
from getting footing in the parish, they placed traps
at every corner. It was impossible to walk through
the highway at broad noon without tumbling into one
or the other of them. No man could go about his
business in security. Yet so great was the hatred
which the inhabitants entertained for the old family,
that a few decent honest people, who begged them
to take down the steel-traps, and to put up humane
man-traps in their room, were very roughly handled
for their good nature.
In the mean time the neighbouring gentry under-
took a suit against the parish on behalf of Sir Lewis?s
heir, and applied to Squire Guelf lor his assistance.
Every body knows that Squire Guelf is more closely
tied up than any gentleman in shire. He could,
therefore, lend them no help ; but he referred them
to the Yestry of the Parish of St. George in the
Water. These good people had long been a grudge
against their neighbours on the other side of the
stream, and some mutual trespasses had lately oc-
curred which increased their hostility.
There was an honest Irishman, a great favourite
among them, who used to entertain them with raree-
shows, and to exhibit a magic lantern to the children
on winter evenings. He had got quite mad upon
this subject. Sometimes he would call out in the
middle of the street?? Take care of that corner,
neighbours: for the love of Heaven, keep clear of
that post, there is a patent steel-trap concealed there-
abouts.? Sometimes he would be disturbed by
frightful dreams; then he would get up at dead of
night, open his window, and cry ? fire,? till the parish
was roused, and the engines sent for. The pulpit of
the Parish of St. George seemed likely to fall; I
believe that the only reason was that the parson had
grown too fat and heavy; but nothing would persuade
this honest man but that it was a scheme of the people
at St. Dennis?s, and that they had sawed through
the pillars in order to break the rector?s neck. Once


he went about with a knife in his pocket, and told
all the persons whom he met, that it had been sharp-
ened by the knife-grinder of the next parish to cut
their throats. These extravagancies had a great
effect on the people, and the more so because they
were espoused by Squire Guelf s steward, who was
the most influential person in the parish. He was
a very fair-spoken man, very attentive to the main
chance, and the idol of the old women, because he
never played at skittles or danced with the girls;
and, indeed, never took any recreation but that of
drinking on Saturday nights with his friend Harry,
the Scotch pedlar. His supporters called him Sweet
William; his enemies the Bottomless Pit.
The people of St. Dennis?s however, had their
advocates. There was Frank, the richest farmer in
the parish, whose great grandfather had been knocked
on the head many years before, in a squabble between
the parish and a former landlord. There was Dick,
the merry-andrew, rather light-fingered and riotous,
but a clever droll fellow. Above all, there was
Charley, the publican, a jolly, fat, honest lad, a great
favourite with the women, who, if he had not been
rather too fond of ale and chuck-farthing, would have
been the best fellow in the neighbourhood.
? My Boys,? said Charley, ? this is exceedingly well
for Madam North;?not that I would speak uncivilly
of her; she put up my picture in her best room, bless
her for it! But, I say, this is very well for her. and
for Lord Caesar, and Squire Don, and Colonel Yon;
?but what affair is it of yours or mine? It is not
to be wondered at, that gentleman should wish to
keep poor people out of their own. But it is strange
indeed, that they should expect the poor themselves
to combine against their own interests. If the folks
at St. Dennis?s should attack us we have the law and
our cudgels to protect us. But why, in the name of
wonder, are we to attack them? When old Sir
Charles, who was Lord of the Manor formerly, and
the parson, who was presented by him to the living,
tried to bully the Vestry, did we not knock their
heads together, and go to meeting to hear Jeremiah
Ringletub preach? And did the Squire Don, or the
great Sir Lewis, that lived at that time, or the Ger-


mains, say a word against us for it? Mind your
own business, my lads: law is not to be had for
nothing; and we, you maybe sure, shall have to pay
the whole bill.?
Nevertheless the people of St. George?s were re-
solved on law. They cried out most lustily, ? Squire
Guelf for ever! Sweet William forever! No steel
traps!? ?Squire Guelf took all the rascally footmen
who had worn old Sir Lewis?s livery into his service.
They were fed in his kitchen on the very best of every
thing, though they had no settlement. Many people,
and the paupers in particular, grumbled at these
proceedings. The steward, however, devised a way
to keep them quiet.
There had lived in this parish for many years an
old gentleman, named Sir Habeas Corpus. He was
said by some to be of Saxon, by some of Norman ex-
traction. Some maintain that he was not born till
after the time of Sir Charles, to whom we have before
alluded. Others are of opinion that he was a legiti-
mate son of Old Lady Magna Charta, although he
was long concealed and kept out of his birthright.
Certain it is that he was a very benevolent person.
Whenever any poor fellow was taken up on grounds
which he thought insufficient, he used to attend on
his behalf and bail him ; and thus he had become so
popular that to take direct measures against him
was out of the question.
The steward, accordingly, brought a dozen phy-
sicians to examine Sir Habeas. After consulation,
they reported that he was in a very bad way, and
ought not, on any account, to be allowed to stir out
for several months. Fortified with this authority,
the parish officers put him to bed, closed his win-
dows, and barred his doors. They payed him every
attention, and from time to time issued bulletins of
his health. The steward never spoke of him with-
out declaring that he was the best gentleman in the
world; but excellent care was taken that he should
never stir out of doors.
When this obstacle was removed, the ?Squire and
the steward kept the parish in excellent order ; flog-
ged this man, sent that man to the stocks, and push-
ed forward the law-suit with a noble disregard of


expense. They where, however, wanting either in
skill or fortune. And every thing went against
them after their antagonists had begun to employ
Solicitor Nap.
Who does not know the name of Solicitor Nap ?
At what ale-house is not his behaviour discussed?
In what print-shop is not his picture seen? Yet
how little truth has been said about him ! Some
people hold that he used to give laudanum by pints
to his sick clerks for his amusement. Others, whose
number is very much increased since he was killed
by the gaol distemper, conceive that he was the very
model of honour and good-nature. I shall try to tell
the truth about him.
He was assuredly an excellent solicitor. In his
way he never was surpassed. As soon as the parish
began to employ him, their cause took a turn. In a
very little time they were successful; and Nap be-
came rich. He now set up for a gentleman; took
possession of the old manor-house; got into the
commission of the peace, and affected to be on a par
with the best in the county. He governed the
vestries as absolutely as the old family had done.
Yet, to give him his due, he managed things with far
more discretion than either Sir Lewis or the rioters
who had pulled the Lords of the Manor down. He
kept his servants in tolerable order. He removed
the steel-traps from the highways and the corners of
the streets. He still left a few indeed in the more
exposed parts of his premises ; and set up a board
announcing that traps and spring guns were set in
his grounds. He brought the poor parson back to
the parish; and, though he did not enable him to
keep a fine horse and coach as formerly, he settled
him in a snug little cottage, and allowed him a
pleasant padnag. He whitewashed the church again;
and put the stocks, which had been wanted of late,
into good repair.
With the neighbouring gentry, he was no favourite
He was crafty and litigious. He cared nothing for
right, if he could raise a point of law against them.
He pounded their cattle, broke their hedges, and
seduced their tenants from them. He almost ruined
Lord Caesar with actions, in every one of which he


was successful. Yon Blunderbussen went to law
with him for an alleged trespass; but was cast, and
almost ruined by the costs of suit. He next took a
fancy to the seat of Squire Don, who was, to say the
truth, little better than an idiot. He asked the poor
dupe to dinner, and then threatened to have him
tossed in a blanket unless he would make over his
estates to him. The poor Squire signed and sealed
a deed by which the property was assigned to Joe,
a brother of Nap?s, in trust for and to the use of Nap
himself. The tenants, however, stood out. They
maintained that the estate was entailed, and refused
to pay rents to the new landlord ; and in this refusal
they where stoutly supported by the people in St.
George?s.
About the same time Nap took it into his head
to match with quality, and nothing would serve
him but one of the Miss Germains. Lord Caesar
swore like a trooper ; but there was no help for it.
Nap had twice put executions in his principal resi-
dence : and had refused te discharge the latter of the
two, till he had extorted a bond from his Lordship
which compelled him to comply.
SONGS OF THE HUGUENOTS.
I. MONCONTOtJE.
Oh ! weep for Moncontour. Oh ! weep for the hour
When the children of darkness and evil had power ;
When the horsemen of Valois triumphantly trod
On the bosoms that bled for their rights and their God.
Oh ! weep for Moncontour. Oh! weep for the slain
Who for faith and for freedom lay slaughtered :n vain.
Oh ! weep for the living, who linger to bear
The renegades shame, or the exile?s despair.
One look, one last look, to the cots and the towers,
To the rows of our vines, and the beds of our
flowers,


To the church where the bones of our fathers de-
cayed,
Where we fondly had dreamed that our own should
be laid.
Alas ! we must leave thee, dear desolate home,
To the spearmen of Uri, the shavelings of Rome,
To the serpent of Florence, the vulture of Spain ,
To the pride of Anjou, and the guile of Lorraine.
Farewell to thy fountains, farewell to thy shades,
To the song of thy youths, and the dance of thy
maids,
To the breath of thy gardens, the hum of thy bees,
And the long waving line of the blue Pyrenees.
Farewell, and for ever. The priest and the slave
May rule in the halls of the free and the brave ;
Our hearths we abandon ; ?our land we resign ;
But, Father, we kneel to no altar but thine.
11. IvRT.
Now glory to the Lord of Hosts, from whom all
glories are !
And glory to our Sovereign Liege, King Henry of
Navarre !
Now let there be the merry sound of music and of
dance,
Through thy corn- fields green, and sunny vines, Oh
pleasant land of France !
And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city
of the waters,
Again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning
daughters.
As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our
joy,
For cold, and stiff, and still, are they who wrought
thy walls annoy.
Hurrah ! Hurrah ! a single field has turned the
chance of war,
Hurrah ! Hurrah ! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre.


Oh! hew our hearts were beating, when at the dawn
c f day,
We saw the army of the League drawn out in long
array;
With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,
And Appenzel?s stout infantry, and Egmont?s Flemish
spears.
There rode the brood of false Lorraine,the curses of
our land;
And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in
his hand:
And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine?s
empurpled flood,
And good Coligni?s hoary hair all dabbled in his
blood;
And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate
of war,
To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of
Navarre.
The King is come to marshal us in all his armour
drest.
And he hath bound a snow-white plume upon his
gallant crest.
He looked upon his people and a tear was in his
eye
He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern
and high.
Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing
to wing,
Down all our line a deafening shout, ? God save our
Lord the King.?
? And if my standard bearer fall, as fall full well he
may,
? For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray,
Press where ye see my white plume shine, amidst
the ranks of war
? And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Na-
varre.?
Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled
din,
Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring
culverin.
The fiery Duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre?s
plain,


With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Al-
mayne.
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of
France,
Charge for the golden lilies, ?upon them with the
lance.
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears
in rest
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the
snow-white crest;
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a
guiding star,
Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of
Navarre.
Now, God be praised, the day is ours. Mayenne
hath turned his rein.
D?Aumale hath cried for quarter. The Flemish
count is slain.
Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a
Biscay gale ;
The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags,
and cloven mail.
And then we thought on vengence, and, all along
our van,
? Remember Saint Bartholomew,? was passed from
man to man.
But out spake gentle Henry, ?No Frenchman is my
foe :
? Down, down, with every foreigner, but let your
brethren go.?
Oh ! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or
in war,
As our Sovereign Lord, King Henry, the soldier of
Navarre !
Ho ! maidens of Vienna ; Ho ! matrons of Lucerne;
Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who
never shall return.
Ho ! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,
That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor
spearmen?s souls.
Ho ! gallant nobles of the League, look that your
arms be bright;
Ho ! burgers of Saint Genevieve, keep watch and
ward to-night.


Tor our God hath crushed the tyrant, our God hath
raised the slave,
And mocked the council of the wise, and the valour
of the brave.
Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories
are ;
And glory to our Sovereign Lord, King Henry of
Navarre.
