PREFACE.
The “ Alphabet of Animals ” <2 puzzle, which we advise
our young readers to try and find out before they read the
letterpress —they must endeavour to make the sense out by the
pictures. “ Childhood's Playtime' ’ will introduce them to the
children of other lands, who (they will find) love play as
much as English children do. “Our Boys and Girls ” will
show them the young people whom we all love; and our little
readers must try to be good enough to deserve a place among
them. “A , Apple Pie ” is a very old alphabet: grandpapas
father to say it, and it would be quite a pity if children
of the present day could not do the same.

CHILDHOOD’S PLAYTIME..


Childhoods Playtime
SWEET little Indian children.
With soft and grave dark eyes,
Listen to English Marian,
With pleasure and surprise.
She tells the tale Mamma has told
Of England—far away—
Where on the daisy-sprinkled grass
The happy children play;
And how when icy winter comes.
And winds blow fierce and cold.
The glittering snow wraps all the fields
And trees within its fold.
How all the busy, prattling streams
Are turned to ice, “like glass,”
O’er which, on shoes of sharpened steel,
The merry skaters pass.
Her playmates say, “It must be sad !
We like the sunshine best;
W r e do not wish to sail away
To that cold far-off West.
“We are content with that we have.”
Then English Harry smiled;
“You’re right,” he said; “each land should be
The dearest to its child.”




CONTINENTAL CHILDREN.
Here are pretty little children
From the lands beyond the sea,
And they all look very happy.
As, indeed, they ought to be.
Some have their dear homes in Norway,
Where in winter falls the snow;
Some in Sweden, where by great lakes
Mighty pine and larch woods grow.
Some in fair Italian valleys
See the orange-trees in flower.
And delight to watch the fireflies
Dancing round the myrtle bower.
German boys and girls, rejoicing.
Play—their daily duties done, —
For by work both good and earnest.
Time for sport and rest is won.
Russian children—pretty darlings—
Warmly wrapt up from the cold;
Little Swiss girl from the mountains.
Where she left her sheep in fold.
And our graceful little neighbour.
Dear Jeannette, her fan displays:
Little French girls love to mimic
Grown-up ladies’ pretty ways.








THE CHILDREN OF GREAT BRITAIN
AND IRELAND.
The Irish boy sits by the stream.
And thinks perhaps he’ll catch a bream;
We may expect some minnows small
Soon victims to his skill will fall.
But even if no fish should bite.
The boy will find a great delight
In sitting by the bubbling rill.
In the warm summer noontide still.
Listening to the wild bird’s song.
The leafy elm-tree boughs among.
His sister Norah soon will bring
(As she has promised) to the spring
A can of milk so fresh and sweet —
There cannot be a greater treat;
And they will have a banquet there.
Beside the stream so swift and fair:
Even now he hears her coming,
A sweet Irish ballad humming.
The English boys prefer to float
Upon the stream a tiny boat;
They make believe it goes to fight
Upon the seas for Britain’s right;
Or bears across the stormy main
Rich merchandise, red gold to gain.
While Milly sits to watch it sail.
And makes a pretty little tale.
In her young fancy, of the lands,
Whth diamond mines and golden sands,
To which her merchant brothers trade.
Of storms and shipwrecks not afraid.
Norman, who’s older, plays at ball, —
He does not care for boats at all;

The Children of Great Britain and Ireland.
He likes a game of greater skill—
Than play that pleases Hal and Will;
But all are happy; summer bright
Is to the little ones delight.
The waving trees, the trickling rill,
The grass so green, the air so still.
The birds’ sweet song, the busy bee
Booming along the flowery lea;
The sounds of Nature’s time of joy
Make happy every girl and boy.
Feather in cap and whip in hand
We see the Highland laddie stand,
'While Jamie holds the pony’s rein.
That soon will scamper o’er the plain.
Proud to carry his young master.
Glad to gallop fast and faster.
These boys really love each other
As if each had been a brother;
Brought up amongst the grand old hills
Amidst pine-woods, by mountain rills;
They love each other, and their home
Too dearly to desire to roam ;
But in these days of railway trains.
Nobody long at home remains;
And they have left the hills together—
The bonny hills of Highland heather—
For English pastures rich and green,
Where not a hill is to be seen ;
But English boys and girls are kind,
And soon the little Scotch lads find
They may be happy if they will,
In lands that scarcely boast a hill.








CANADIAN AND AMERICAN CHILDREN
Where great Niagara’s waters fall.
The little English child.
Speaks to the gentle Indian girl
In accents soft and mild.
“And take,” she said, “dear ‘Laughing "Water,”’
—That was bhe red girl’s name—
“ This Book, which tells the wondrous story
Of how the Saviour came.
“Jesus, the Son of God most holy.
Who loves both you and me,
And wishes that all little children
God’s own dear ones may be.”
“Oh, I am glad,” said ‘Laughing
“For in it I shall see
How to be like the English children
"Who come across the sea.”
America’s young son stands near them,
He hears her words with joy;
He, too, has giv’n the Holy Volume
To his free Negro boy.
The Mexican in gaudy raiment.
Listens and learns the truth;
Thus the glad tidings of Salvation
Are spread by tender youth.








AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN.
On the green plains of Australia
These little children play.
They have forgotten long ago
The poor home far away;
Where no fresh breezes cooled their brows,
Where wild flowers there were none;
And where, upon the narrow streets.
The pale sun scarcely shone;
Where sometimes they with hunger pined,
And sometimes shook with cold;
And where, their garments were in rags.
They were so very old.
Now there is bread and meat for all.
And blue sky overhead;
And on their father’s meadow-land
The milk-white lambs are fed.
Jane rides old Dobbin from the field,
As happy as a queen ;
And Nellie binds up lovely flowers
With strings of creepers green.
Their life is like a summer day,
As childhood’s life should be;
But when the playtime’s past and gone.
Good workers they will be.




OUR BOYS AND GIRLS.


OUR BOYS AND GIRLS
HO does not love our girls and boys?
Who does not like to hear their noise;
To see them dance, and jump, and play,
As merry as the birds in May ?
All hearts acknowledge their sweet spell;
All people love the children well;
And here we give you, one by one,
Their pictures, for our Toy Book done.
The first is John, —how grave he looks!
He is a boy who loves his books;
And studies hard to puzzle out
What grown-up people think about.
Rose is a merry little pet,
She s never known to pout or fret;
She s always happy, pleased, and gay,
Whether at lessons or at play.
Lily’s a very quiet child,
Like little lambkin, meek and mild;
She never tears her frock like Rose,
And every day her lesson knows.








OUR BOYS AND GIRLS.
Allan’s a bonnie Highland boy,
Who finds in outdoor sports his joy;
His Shetland pony loves to ride,
Or climbs the steep grey mountain-side,
When cold November brings the frost,
And the dead leaves are swiftly tost
Along the pathway, by the breeze
Which bends the swaying, creaking trees.
Mary prepares for a good run,
And hopes with Anne to have great fun,
Chasing the leaves along the grass —
Or the swift shadows as they pass.
And Annie—merry little sprite—
Comes running out in great delight,
To play in the fresh frosty air
With the dear sister waiting there.
While Edith in the warm house stays,
And from the window turns her gaze
Upon the fields, no longer green,
Where coming winter’s trace is seen.
Norman a picture book enjoys ;
H e is the cleverest of our boys;
Reading he loves, and study too,
He’s always learning something new.








OUR BOYS AND GIRLS.
His teachers praise him ev’ry day,
And yet he loves a game of play;
The time for work and play he knows,
And wins by toil his sweet repose.
A little cottage maid is Jane,
Her home is down a mossy lane ;
Wild flowers she loves, and often seeks
In hedgerows where the primrose peeps;
There “lords and ladies,” full of pride,
In silken robes of soft green hide;
But cannot cheat her piercing eyes,
She’s sure to make of them a prize.
With ears of barley Bessie’s seen,
She loves the golden grain to glean;
But all she gathers up in play,
To poor old folks she gives away.
With her and Jane, Amelia plays
In the green fields on summer days,
And carries—after playtime hours—
Back to Mamma a wealth of flow’rs.
When golden harvests crown the lands,
See, by the stile young Edward stands,
Wishing he might a sickle wield,
And help the men to reap the field;














OUR BOYS AND GIRLS.
For well he knows amongst the corn
The pretty little skylark’s born;
And that sometimes its nest is found
Amidst the stubble on the ground.
Quietly in a shady bower
Dear Fanny spends an idle hour,
Thinking over fav’rite stories
Of the fairy kingdoms glories;
Now with the White Cat purring talks;
Now with the Seven-League Boots she walks
Now sweet Red Riding-Hood goes by;
And now she hears poor 80-Peep sigh;
But by-and-bye her Nurses call
Will scatter these gay fancies all:
Well, never mind ! it pleased her well,
Just for a time with them to dwell.
Her Sister Milly reads meantime
The childrens well loved nurs’ry rhyme,—
How the naughty little Sparrow
Killed poor Robin with his arrow.
Willie is a gardeners son,
He thinks that digging is great fun,
And, spade in hand he hastes away,
For work to him is only play.








OUR BOYS AND GIRLS.
Our Kath Vine is so very neat,
To look at her is quite a treat;
For hair so tidy, frock so clean,
Upon a child is seldom seen.
Dear little Ada pets her cat,
And gives it many a loving pat,
And as she strokes its velvet fur,
Pussy returns a grateful purr.
Baby Emily awaking
From the nap she’s just been taking,
Laughs at the Nurse in merry mood,
Quite ready for her nice warm food.
The graceful little Isabel
Becomes her flow’ry garland well,
A little beauty! quite aware
How bright her eyes, how soft her hair.
Blanche loves her doll with all her heart,
And cannot bear from it to part;
However old the toy may grow,
No change her love for it can know.
She practises a mother s duty,
Whether her child be fright or beauty;
Dresses it, talks to it, and pets it,
And gravely hopes “ that nothing frets it.








OUR BOYS AND GIRLS.
Her doll is always nicely dressed,
As well as played with and caressed,
And kind Blanche learns, for Dolly’s sake
All sorts of little clothes to make.
Augusta stands beneath the trees
Thinking how best Mamma to please
The wish reflected in her eyes,
Fresh beauty to her face supplies.
Frederick is a baby boy,
Who dearly loves a pretty toy ;
The little lambkin by his side,
Is just at present all his pride.
A girl so merry and so kind
As Alice is, we seldom find;
She helps Mamma; with Baby plays,
And old Nurse gives her constant praise.
Dear Baby sleeps; pray make no noise,
My merry little girls and boys,
Lest you the little pet awake—
You’ll hush, I’m sure, for Baby’s sake.
You love his pretty little ways,
When with you merrily he plays,
And in your turn should do your best
To guard the tender infant’s rest.




A, APPLE PIE.


A was an Apple Pie, juicy and
sweet.
For very good children, a very
great treat.
D is young Bertie, who bit at
the pie,
And took care to do it when no
one was by.
Q stands for Charlie, who cut
for the others,
And handed it round to his sisters
and brothers.
Danced so gaily before the
great Pie,
\nd showed her delight by the
glance of her eye.








p* is eating her Pie, with the plate
on her knees.
Such a good little girl, and so easy
to please.
p Fought for this largest and
sweetest of Pies,
With another rude boy nearly
double his size.
Q Got at the Pie, and then bore
it away.
To be laid on the shelf and be
eaten next day.
Hid the great Pie under
grandmama’s table.
And thought that to find it she
would not be able.








I Jumped twenty times with a
face full of joy.
So eager to -taste it was this little
boy.
J/ Kept it, and thought that she
looked very grand.
As she sat by its side with a rod
in her hand.
Longed for the Pie, and she
wanted it soon.
For her plate was quite ready,
and so was her spoon.
M Mourned ; for Mamma had
just sent him to bed.
For tasks left undone, and for
lessons unsaid.














M Nodded her head wnen she
stood on the chair,
And shook all the curls of her
pretty brown hair.
Q Opened the Pie, just to see
what was in it.
And lifted the crust up in less
than a minute.
p Peeped at the Pie, which she
thought very nice.
So she asked her Papa for a very
large slice.
Q Quaked; for he thought that
it looked rather small,
And he feared there might not
be enough for them all.








D Ran for a knife, as he wanted
to try
How much he could eat of this
large Apple Pie.
Q Stood by the table and picked
at the crust;
You’ll not be so sly or so greedy,
I trust.
T Took up with pleasure so
splendid a gift,
But found it too hot and too heavy
to lift.
W Viewed the big Pie and ad-
mired its figure.
For Grandmama’s spectacles
made it look bigger.








w Wished for some more, but
was ready to cry
When, she heard that the ser~
vants had finished the Pie.
expected his dear little sister
would grieve,
So he brought her some pudding,
her mind to relieve.
Y Yielded the point, and was
cheerful about it,
Saying, “If the Pie’s gone, we
must all do without it.”
7 Zealously tried little Winnie
to cheer,
Like a good elder sister, so kind
and sincere.
