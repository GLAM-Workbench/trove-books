ADVERTISEMENT,
MY motives for intruding the following remarks on the notice of
the Public, arise solely from the circumstance of many of my
friends having frequently urged me to commit to writing the re-
sult of my own observations, during my experience as an agricul-
turalist and grazier in NEW SOUTH WALES, for the period of eight
years. Having complied with their request so far, it occurred to
me that I might render the information I am enabled to commu-
nicate more generally available, and perhaps more extensively
useful, by printing several copies at once, so as to enable any per-
son to obtain them at a trifling expense.
I have only farther to say, that whatever the proceeds of this
Publication may amount to, after paying expenses, will be handed
over for the benefit of the Gaelic School Society, whose operations,
I understand, are likely to be impeded from want of funds, and in
the success of whose valuable labours I feel a warm interest.

ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION.
SINCE publishing the First Edition of this Tract, the Author has
received letters from the Colony, giving the most flattering ac-
counts of the settlement at Port Phillip. At that period there
were upwards of 800,000 sheep there; and the town of Melbourne
was increasing so rapidly, that it had already assumed the ap-
pearance of an old established colony. Town allotments were
selling very high, and one on which a small house was built, was
about being purchased for a club-house for £ 3000. Labour was
scarce, and the government were inclined to do away with the
assignment of convicts altogether, but several ships, with emi-
grants from this country, were soon expected, which would afford
some relief. Ewes of the best description were selling at 25s* to
30 s. each , and merchandize was lower than at Sydney.
As some persons may be led to suppose that this publication is
intended as a guide to Emigrants proceeding to South Australia,
as well as to those going to New South Wales, the Author has
only to remark, that he could not possibly think of offering any
advice or information relative to the former Colony, as he never
was there; and that it is only applicable to the latter Colony, in-
cluding Port Phillip.

THE
AUSTRALIAN EMIGRANT'S GUIDE.
EMIGRANTS proceeding to New South Wales , with a capital not exceed-
ing £3ooo*or £4OOO, should not invest part in merchandise, with a
view of augmenting it, as they will, in all probability, be disappointed;
for I have seen goods sold in Sydney, under such circumstances, consi-
derably below prime cost. I would not even recommend the purchase
of a large quantity of wearing apparel, beyond what will serve for a
couple of years, as every thing suitable for the climate can be purchased
in Sydney at a trifling advance on the prices here. A person with the
larger capital should take out a few pure Saxon tups and ewes, or those
of Lord Western's breed, which are much valued in the colony; also,
an experienced shepherd, to act at first as watchman, and as the flocks
increase as overseer, with three or four common shepherds, and a plough -
man, as there might be some difficulty in procuring such servants on
arrival. By taking out married men under forty years of age, the Go-
vernment bounty can be secured.
The Emigrant should take out his money in good negotiable bills, which
can be easily disposed of, sometimes at par or at a small premium, but
more frequently at two or three per cent discount. The bills being
disposed of, and the proceeds lodged in one of the banks, he should then
proceed to the settlement of his family; and for this purpose, I would
recommend one of the villages distant from Sydney, or a small farm,
where they will be more comfortable, and live at less expense than in
town. This being done, he should purchase a couple of saddle horses,
procure a guide well acquainted with the country, and a few introduc-
tions to the best breeders of sheep and cattle, that he may proceed to
the interior for the purpose of selecting a location, and examining the
flocks and herds going along. In fixing upon a spot for location, he
should attend particularly to its character, and take care that it be well
watered, near a river, if possible, suitable for sheep and cattle, and at a
considerable distance from any other persons, to prevent disputes and
competition, in case of sale or leasing. If within the limits of the Co-
lony, lie must apply to the Surveyor-General for liberty to purchase


one or more sections,* describing the boundaries as minutely as possible,
for the purpose of its being advertised. If measured in time, the land
will be put up by public auction, and disposed of in about a month ;
but, if beyond the limits, a licence only will be required, which can be
obtained by application to the Colonial secretary or treasurer, and by
paying £lO per annum. In either case, when the location is fixed upon,
a couple of good fencers should be engaged, and dispatched immediately
to take possession, erect huts, put up a stockyard, and make hurdles
for the reception of the stock. This being arranged, and a team of oxen
and dray purchased for the purpose of drawing in the stuff for the
fencers, he should then proceed to the purchase of the cattle and horses.
The cows should be about four years old, and in calf, or have calves
with them* Bulls same age. A number of oxen, different ages, should
also be purchased to kill for rations, and to break in for work, during the
first three years, at the end of which the increase of the cows purchased
will be old enough for that purpose. The mares ought not to be above
six years old, and to have foals with them. The cattle and horses being
purchased, and a stockman engaged,t they should then be driven to the
station, if the stockyard is finished, as they must be yarded every night
for a month, and herded all day until reconciled to the run. The stock
having arrived at the station, the best and clearest spot of ground
should be selected for cultivation, that the plough may be set a-going,
and about thirty acres broke up, cross-ploughed, and made ready for
the seed, which ought to be in the ground in all May, or sooner, if pos-
sible, although a pretty good crop may be expected from July sowing,
if the season is moist. This can easily be done, an acre per day being
the usual task for a team; the seed is generally ploughed in, and the
quantity is a bushel per acre, the produce from which, in the district
where I resided, was from 20 to 30 bushels (wheat).
These arrangements being completed, the next step is to proceed to
the purchase of the sheep ; and in this great caution must be observed,
first, that they are and have been free from disease; second, that they
are even in the well bred, and not above three or four years
old; but as a little information relative to the management of this kind
of stock may be useful for the guidance of the purchaser, I give the fol-
lowing sketch of the system pursued by myself and others, in the dis-
trict where I resided.
* A Section is 640 acres, and entitles the purchaser to eight convict servants,
and every 160 acres additional will entitle him to one convict servant. Carpen-
ters, blacksmiths, &c., count three each, and a tailor two.
f The stockman is generally provided with a horse, and is in constant attendance
upon the cattle.
J This will save a great deal of trouble when sorting the wool.


In the southern parts of the Colony, the ewes are divided into flocks
of 400 to 500, —wethers and weaned lambs into that of about 1000,
with a shepherd to each flock, whose duty is to go out with them
every morning at sunrise , and return at sunset , travelling during that
time about eight miles, or four miles out and home. There are gener-
ally three flocks at each station, at which there is a watchman, whose
duty is to count the sheep into the folds, watch them during the
night, shift the folds in the morning, and take care of the hut, or any
milch cows* that may be at the station during the day. This may ap-
pear a laborious duty, but the reverse is the case, as he has a good com-
fortable watch box, which contains his bed, and in which he can sleep as
soundly as if in the huts, if provided with a good watch-dog, and keep
a fire during the night.
The tups are put to the ewes on or about the Ist of April (one to
forty), and taken away in six weeks or two months, that the ewes may
finish lambing by the end of October, and that the lambs may be strong
enough to undergo the fatigue of sheep-wasliing, which will commence
about the middle of November. The lambs are ear -marked and cut,
when about three weeks or a month old. Sheep-wasliing and shearing
begin, as already mentioned, about the middle of November, and end on
ordinary establishments by the middle of the following month; but as
the process is somewhat different to what it is in this country, the fol-
lowing directions are given, viz.:—Select a situation on the banks of a
river, close to where the water is about four feet deep, place two large
tubs, holding about 150 gallons each, a short distance from each other,
suspend close to these tubs a boiler, holding about sixty gallons, which
must be kept constantly full of hot water (not boiling), with a little
soap to soften it; half fill the tubs with cold water, and mix a little hot
with it, to take the chill off. A flock of sheep, of 400 or 500, being
folded close by, the shepherd catches tliem and throws them into the
tubs, which will hold two each, and at each tub there are two men sta-
tioned for the purpose of rubbing them and throwing them into the
river, in which there are eight or ten men in couples receiving them,
rubbing them, and passing them from each other against the stream,
until they come out as white as snow. They are then confined near
the bed of the river until the flock is finished, which, when properly
done, will take from eight o'clock in the morning until three or four in
the afternoon. They are then carefully driven away, fed on a clean and
dry run, without being allowed to get water until shorn,t which is done
* Milch cows are kept at the stations to give milk when tea and sugar is not
served out to the men.
t If allowed to water they would get dirty, the ponds being muddy ; but turning
them out while the dew is on the ground, will answer as well.


in about a week, or sooner, if the weather is favourable for getting the
yolk up; when shorn, the fleeces are breeched, skirted , and folded up
from both ends, shorn side out, tied with a piece of twine, and stacked
in the wool-slied until all the flocks are shorn,* it is then packed in
bales of 250 to 280 lbs. and sent to market when the harvest is housed,
which is generally early in February; and about the same time the lambs
are weaned.
From what has been now observed as to the management of sheep, I
would recommend their being purchased immediately after shearing,
unless the seller consent to let them remain at his station (at the ex-
pense and risk of the purchaser), until the foregoing operations are over,
as it would be impossible to drive ewes heavy in lamb or with young
lambs any distance, or to enable the purchaser to erect upon his own lo-
cation such accommodations as would be required for such purposes in
time, especially as the sheep ought to be shorn early, for fear of the
grass-seed shedding, which is found to be very injurious to the wool.
In driving the sheep to the station, ten miles a day will be a sufficient
journey; and great care ought to be taken that they are not folded in
any of the bush folds that may be found by the road side, for fear of
getting infected, scab and catarrh being very prevalent throughout the
Colony.
Having now gone over the most important part of the Emigrant's
first operations, I subjoin a Schedule of the distribution of capital in the
purchase of land, agricultural implements, cattle, horses, and sheep, and
annex returns of the different establishments, showing what is likely to
be the result at the end of eight years, differing from my own experi-
ence only in the amount of capital employed, in the substitution of free
for convict labour, and in the price of stock at the time of sale.
* The flocks are numbered with paint or tar, to distinguish them in case of mixing.

From the number of servants employed on the farm, a much greater
quantity of land could be brought into cultivation, and the produce
made available, if within a moderate distance of a market. The dairy
produce, also, could be considerably augmented by keeping a proper
dairy, the cattle, according to the foregoing Return, being merely
milked to keep them quiet. In addition, a considerable number of pigs
could be reared on the farm, and fattened upon skim milk, &c., the pro-
ceeds of which would be more than sufficient to cover any expense that
may have been omitted in these calculations.

RETURN OF SHEEP


From the foregoing returns, the Sheep establishment appears to be
the most productive; and perhaps it would be as well for an emigrant
to have no other, if provisions and labour, with carriage of produce to
market, could be readily obtained in the distant parts of the colony;
but when it is borne in mind that a supply of flour and other necessa-
ries must be taken from Sydney, a distance of 200 miles and upwards,
—that meat is difficult to be got at times without sending a consider-
able distance for it, —that labour is exceedingly scarce, and not to be
procured for money in some parts of the Colony, besides the want of
any public carriers,—the necessity will then appear of raising every
thing on the establishment for its own consumption, rather than trust
to such precarious and expensive means. By doing so, a sufficient
number of people will be kept employed, which will be always a gua-
rantee against any scarcity of labour, and secure a ready conveyance for
the wool to market.
As these returns have been made out on a scale proportioned to the
larger capital, they may be considered as a discouragement to the emi-
grant of smaller means. This is by no means intended, but the reverse,
the latter having many advantages over the other. For instance, a
person with a flock of ewes and a few cattle can locate himself within
a more moderate distance of a shipping port or market than the other ;
besides, the casualties will not be so great in proportion, his stock be-
ing fewer in number, and of course more easily taken care of.
Having hitherto confined my remarks to the course and probable
success of the capitalist, I would not be unmindful of the more humble
class, the mechanic and labourer ; and with regard to them, I have only
to say, that there is no country on the face of the earth where labour is
better remunerated, and where the poor and the industrious can se-
cure to themselves and families a competence more easily than in Aus-
tralia ; and for their encouragement will mention one instance of the
many that came under my own observation, as to what can be at-
tained by industry and integrity in that colony.
About fifteen years ago, a young man emigrated from the High-
lands of Scotland to New South Wales. On his arrival he was em-
ployed as a common shepherd (when wages were much lower than


they are now). From his good conduct, he was subsequently pro-
moted to the different situations of under overseer , and principal su-
perintendent on a large establishment in the neighbouring county to
where I resided. He received his salary in sheep, or invested it in such,
and about the latter end of 1836, or beginning of 1837, sold his stock
for <£9ooo and upwards.
I have made no remarks as to the description of the country or the
part of the colony that I would recommend. Indeed, I have none
to add to those already made by the several writers who have treated
that part of the subject, but would recommend Dr Lang and Major
Mitchell's works as the best that I have as yet read; and although I
know little of Port Phillip but from report, I have no hesitation in
saying that I would give that place a decided preference, because the
land is more fertile, and the climate more agreeable in that neighbour-
hood than at Sydney, besides the probability of being able to secure a
location or homestead without going so far into the interior, there being
but a small quantity of land sold as yet at that place.
In conclusion, I would request the emigrant to bear in mind, that no
such results as have been exhibited can possibly be expected without
the greatest care and attention, especially to the sheep ; * and in addi-
tion to what has been already said as to their management, I would
urge the necessity of erecting a shed as early as possible for the purpose
of sheltering the ewes occasionally when lambing. This can be easily
done, there being little or no work going on during the months of June,
July, and August, except on large agricultural establishments. Great
care should also be observed in folding the sheep during the winter
months, and wet weather, on high ground sheltered from the cold wes-
terly winds. By attending to this, protecting them from the native
dogs , and guarding against catarrh , &c., a better result in point of
increase may be expected. The worst lambing I ever had was
per cent, and the casualties for the eight years never exceeded 2 per cent.
* It is not absolutely necessary that the emigrant should have any previous
knowledge as to the management of sheep, the great requisite being care and at-
tention, with strict order and regularity among the shepherds. The other acquire-
ments can be easily attained after a few months' residence in the colony.


In order that the foregoing statements may not appear exaggerated,
I add a note of the average weight of my own fleeces, and prices for
the last eight years, along with the prices obtained for the same de-
scription of stock.
*
Average weight of fleeces for eight years 3 lbs. 2 oz., and price Is. Bd.
per lb. in Sydney; milch cows, ages, £6 each; working and fat oxen £8 each;
bulls £lO each; mixed breed, one to two year old, £3 each; and horses,
£35 each.
Ewes, four year old, to lamb in September, 50s. each.
... three year old, ... ... 525. 6d. each.
... two year old, ... ... 555. each.
... one year old, maiden, 455. each.
... Saxon, different ages, 100s. each.
Tups, ... . . 100s. each.
... cross-bred, 50s. each.
Wethers, two year old, 20s. each.
one year old, 18s. each.
The above prices were obtained in September 1836, and stock of
every kind continued to advance in price until July following, when a
considerable depression took place, in consequence of a fall in the Eng -
lish wool market; but the prices from that period down to July last
varied from 20s. to 30s. for ewes, and the other stock as already stated.
The Author having been frequently applied to for information re-
specting the Government Regulations for sending out Emigrants to Aus-
tralia, begs to subjoin the Government Regulations on the subject.


NATURE AND CONDITIONS OF ASSISTANCE BY GOVERNMENT
TO EMIGRANTS TO NEW SOUTH WALES.
*
Nature of the Assistance.
1. With the view of diminishing the scarcity of labour which is ex-
perienced in New South Wales, the revenue arising from the sale of
public lands in that colony has been appropriated to the encouragement
of Emigration; and, by the aid of this resource, ships are occasionally
sent by Government from different parts of the United Kingdom, in
which a free passage is offered to useful labouring people and mechanics
of good character.
Limitations.
2. The fund through which this is done is not one raised in England,
nor a fund collected for the relief of distress, but it is a colonial reve-
nue, devoted to the purpose of supplying the colony with active and
industrious labourers; and the officers entrusted with its management
are obliged to govern their proceedings strictly by that object.
3. -As it is only particular kinds of people to whom a conveyance
can be granted, and as the number who can be taken even of those who
are eligible is far smaller than the number that would be glad to go,
no one must on any account reckon on a passage, until personally seen
and accepted by a Government officer.
4. Upon being so seen and accepted, a certificate to that effect will
be granted, signed with the name of the selecting officer, after which no
one need apprehend disappointment.


5. But if, notwithstanding this warning, persons are so imprudent
as to part with their employment, or dispose of their property, on the
mere chance of obtaining a passage, it will not be admitted to consti-
tute any claim whatever on the Government; for there would other-
wise be no limit to the number or the kind of the people who might
force themselves on the Colonial Revenues for a conveyance.
6. Each ship must be filled from some particular district, and this
precludes the acceptance of candidates, however eligible in other re-
spects, who are not residing in a part of the country from which it is
proposed to select a whole party sufficient to fill a ship. Under this
rule, detached applicants of all kinds must unavoidably be refused.
Mode of Selecting People for a Passage.
7. When it is proposed to fill a ship from a particular district, means
will be taken to make the intention generally known; and if there
shall appear reason to expect that the required number of people can
be selected, an officer (usually a surgeon of the Royal Navy, who has
been in the colony), will visit the most convenient places for the differ-
ent candidates to assemble at for the purpose, and will decide upon
their applications by personal inspection.
8. After this officer s name and address are announced, all applica-
tions should be addressed to him.
9. He has the whole responsibility for the nature of the selections
made, and his decision will in all cases be considered final.
10. It will always much facilitate the transaction of the business at
such meetings as above mentioned, that the parties should be accompa-
nied by their wives and children for inspection at the same time, and
that they should have with them, ready, the best written testimo-
nials they can produce from clergymen, and from late employers, of
their character and capacity; and if they have been brought together
by any neighbouring gentleman who takes an interest in them, or by
any parochial or other officer, that lists of their names, with the num-
ber and ages of their children, should be made out beforehand.
11. No one, however, should make any preparation whatever for
the voyage without such a certificate as is referred to in paragraphs


4 and 5; and the Government will not be answerable for any injury
people may do themselves by neglecting this warning.
Description of People who are eligible.
12. The people selected must belong to the class of mechanics and
handicraftsmen, or of agricultural labourers. All the heads of families
7 o
must be capable of labour, and emigrate with the intention of working
for wages after their arrival.
13. Persons, therefore, who are proceeding to the colony to buy
land, or invest a small capital in trade, are not eligible for a free pas-
sage.
14. Persons who have bound themselves to some private master in
the colony before they leave this country, are not eligible for a passage
at the public expense.
15. The classes most in demand may be described as follows:
Shepherds and Farm Servants; the trades employed in building, such
as Carpenters, Joiners, Plasterers, Bricklayers, and Stonemasons ;
Quarrymen and Brickmakers; Country Blacksmiths, who can shoe
horses; and a moderate number of Tailors and Shoemakers.
16. Single men and single women cannot be taken, with the excep-
tions that will be found stated at paragraphs 21 and 22.
17. In point of age and description of family, the candidates that
will be most acceptable are married couples; not exceeding thirty years
of age, who have no children.
18. Married people up to any age less than fifty, provided they be
still hale and capable of work, will, if they have growing up sons and
daughters, and none less than seven years of age , be deemed preferable
to any couples which have children younger than seven years.
19. No family can be accepted which includes more than two child-
ren under seven years. The representations made on the subject from
the colony, and the evils experienced in former ships, renders this re-
gulation indispensable.
20. And it will only be on very strong grounds that any family, in-
cluding a child under three years of age, can be accepted at all. For
this youngest class of children is very liable to sickness and mortality


on board, and is burdensome after arrival, rendering their parents less
acceptable to Colonial Employers; and it is for the benefit of the peo-
ple themselves, to decline to take many under such circumstances.
21. Single women, not with their parents, can only be taken if they
are relatives or friends of some of the married people on board, and are
intended to remain as part of the same family in the colony, until other-
wise provided for.
*<4-
22. Single men can only be taken in such limited number as may
not exceed the number of single women admitted under the foregoing
paragraph.
23. Good character is indispensable, and written testimonials of it
will be required, in order to be delivered, with the people, in the colony.
Proceedings after Selection.
24. All the people who are accepted, men, women, and children,
ought either to have satisfactory marks of a former vaccination, or else
to get the operation performed for them before they embark. Due at-
tention to this point, as essential to the safety of the passengers, is most
earnestly requested of all who may be accepted for a passage in a Go-
vernment vessel, and of all gentlemen who may interest themselves in
their behalf. And if any intended emigrant on whom, or his children,
the selecting surgeon has found the marks deficient, and has recom-
mended that he should get the operation performed, arrive at the place
of embarkation without it, he must distinctly understand that it will
be in the discretion of the surgeon, if he see good reason, to refuse to
receive him on board.
25. The emigrants must find their own way to the place named for
embarkation; but after reaching it, they will be put on board under
the care, and at the expense, of Government.
26. Provisions, bedding and blankets, and cooking utensils, will be
found for them. They should bring their own knives, and forks, and
spoons. Sheets are not provided by the vessels, and emigrants should
bring their own.
27. They must also bring their own clothing, and cannot be allowed


to proceed unless they provide themselves with a sufficient supply for
their health during the voyage. The lowest quantity that can be ad-
mitted would consist of two complete suits of exterior clothing, includ-
ing two pairs of shoes, and of six changes of shirts and stockings; but,
as a general rule, it may be stated, that the more abundant the stock of
clothing, the better for health and comfort during the passage. It
should be observed, that in the voyage to New South "Wales, at whatever
season of the year it may be, the emigrants have to pass through both
very hot and very cold weather, and they should be prepared for each.
28. Neither furniture nor bulky tools or implements can be received
on board. Bedding also, with the exception of the article of sheets, is
prohibited. The luggage should be confined within half a ton mea-
surement (half a ton being twenty cubic feet) for every married couple
with one or two children, divided as far as possible into two or three
boxes of not more than two and a-half or three feet long, by about
twenty inches wide, and eighteen inches high. For every additional
two children, one more box of moderate size would be allowed. But
people cannot be permitted to crowd the ship with boxes only half
filled, and must pack their effects close.
Passage and Arrival.
29. During the voyage the emigrants will be under the care of a
surgeon, who will have the general charge and superintendence of them
until they reach their destination.
30. They will be victualled on a liberal scale, framed on the model
of that which is in use in other sorts of Government transports.
31. Every security is taken for the convenience of the emigrants on
first landing; and, in order to let them know at once what opportunities
they have of pleasing themselves, information will be provided for them
of the demand for labour in different directions. They will be entirely
free after arrival to engage themselves to any one they please, and at
the best wages they can obtain, and will in no respect be bound to
Government, nor be liable to be called upon for repayment of the cost
of their passage.


32. Letters on the subject of the present notice should be address
to T. Frederick Elliot, Esq., 2, Middle Scotland Yard; and, if by G
neral Post, should be placed under cover to the Under Secretary
State, Colonial Office, London.
T. FREDERICK ELLIOT,
Agent-General for Emigration.
