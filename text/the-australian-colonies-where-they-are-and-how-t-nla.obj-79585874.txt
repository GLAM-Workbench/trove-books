FARMERS? AND GARDENERS? GUIDE
TO THE
ANALYSES OP SOILS AND MANURES, AND TO THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION
OF AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY.
JOHN MASTINBALE.
OPINIONS OP THE PRESS.
?The work now before us is intended to teach agriculturists aud gardeners
the best and simplest methods of chemical analysis as applicable to agriculture.
Por this purpose the author introduces just as much of the principles of che-
mistry as is required to enable the analyst to understand what he is about, and
to interpret the result he obtains. It is a great mistake, although a very com-
mon one among gardeners and farmers, to suppose that it is necessary to become
a profound chemist in order to be able to apply its most simple principles to
practice. People say they have not time to become chemists, therefore they will
not learn how to make use of a few rules deduced for them by others. It would
be just as wise to say, ? We won?t learn how to tell the time by a watch, because
we don?t know how it is made.? The importance of a little chemical knowledge
to all those whose business is is to cultivate plants has so often been insisted
upon in our columns, that it would be superfluous to add anything more on that
point in the present place. * * * The present work is not confined solely
to chemical analysis; it treats also of the physical properties of soils, and of
their geological classification. * * *
?In our opinion both gardeners and farmers cannot do better than to make
themselves well acquainted with the * Guide ? thus offered them.?? Gardener*'
Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette (edited by Professor Lindley).
?Agriculture was, until recent years, only an art. It has now become a
science; and every cultivator who would wish to carry on his business success,
fully must be acquainted with the theory as well as the practice of his trade.
There is, among the younger farmers, a growing disposition for improvement;
and the work before us is admirably adapted to assist those who entertain that
desire.? ?Durham Chronicle.
? We. hail with peculiar satisfaction the above treatise ; a book that we think
ought to be in the hands of every tiller of the soil. It is unquestionably a work
of great practical utility; and the author has brought to the execution of his
task all the science, skill, and experience essential for enabling the agriculturist
to ascertain for himself the composition of any soil or manure.? ?Darlington and
Stockton Times.
?The book contains a vast quantity of information, given in a plain and ex-
plicit manner, and will be advantageously consulted by every one connected with
agriculture, who has a wish to procure the greatest return at the least possible
expense, and with least injury to the land,? ?Berwick Warder.
?To the young agriculturist, and particularly to those who are destined to
appeal to our common mother for support in a far distant land, where the re-
finements of science are doubly valuable, this little work will supply the means
of forming a sound and practical acquaintance with the most approved methods
of obtaining her utmost favours; while to those already' partially informed upon
the subject, it offers an easy source of renewing or extending the intimacy.??.
Sunderland Herald.
?To the agriculturist in this country, as well as to him who seeks for a new
home in a foreign land, there is no kind of knowledge more valuable than that
which will enable him to ascertain the constituents of the soil by analysis. By
a careful perusal of this work, a person of moderate ability may, in an ordinary
case, with the assistance of the few and simple rules given, be enabled to ascer-
tain for himself, with tolerable accuracy, the composition of any soil or manure.?
?Mark Lane Express.
Testimonial from Dr. Richardson, Doctor in Philosophy, and Lecturer on
Chemistry in the School of Medicine, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
? I have read Mr. Martindale?s Fanner and Gardener?s Guide to Agricultural
Chemistry with groat pleasure. It is an excellent compendium, and embraces
all our present information in this branch of applied chemistry', arranged in a
very methodical manner, and well adapted for parties just commencing the
study of this science. (Signed) THOMAS RICHARDSON.

THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES.
PART I.
Most persons are aware that Australia is the place
where such large quantities of gold have been found, and
also that Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and
Hobart Town are in Australia; but very few of the
thousands of emigrants who are leaving England every
year are aware that these places are distinct towns in
separate colonies, and each several hundred miles apart.
Sydney being the principal town in New South Wales,
Melbourne the principal town in Victoria (late Port
Phillip), Adelaide the capital of South Australia, Perth
the capital of Western Australia, and Hobart Town that
of Van Diemen?s Laud ; the latter, although a separate
island, being commonly designated a part of Australia.
The following are the distances between the several
places:?
? ditto to King George?s Sound 865 ?
? Adelaide to ditto 360 ?
There are steamers and sailing vessels running con-
stantly between these places; the run from Sydney to


Melbourne by a steamer being accomplished in about
three days.
To understand correctly the following description, the-
reader should buy or borrow a map of the world. Maps-
are now sold so cheap, that few persons are too poor to
buy one. Let it be a Mercator's Map of the World , if
possible. Having this open, look at the right-hand lower
corner, and there will be seen a very large island ?the
largest in the world ?this is Australia , or, as it was called
in former days, New Holland, because people from
Holland first landed upon it. Just above this are the-
East India islands, and running through the middle of it,
from east to west, is a dotted line to mark that there
begins the Tropic of Capricorn.
Again refer to the map and trace the ? way to Aus-
tralia.? After passing out of the channel between
England and Prance, the Bay of Biscay is crossed, and
at a distance may be seen the coast of Portugal and a
part of Spain, and Gibraltar at the entrance to the Medi-
terranean ; after which the ship will be oft the sandy
coast of Africa. A sight may be obtained of the Canary
Islands, and afterwards possibly St. Jago, one of the Cape
de Yerd Islands, may be seen. * The weather now grows
warmer, and continues to do so until after passing the line..
The Island of Ascension will soon after be passed, and then
the Island of St. Helena, after which the weather begins
to grow cooler, and as the Cape of Good Hope is ap-
proached thick coats are desirable to be worn. On
passing, or, as it is commonly termed, ? rounding the
Cape,? storms and heavy seas may be expected. Leaving
the Cape of Good Hope, land is not likely to be seen
until the island of Australia is sighted; sometimes the
voyage is made from England to Australia without once
ever seeing land.
This immense island, or continent, measures about
three thousand miles along the dotted line named previ-
ously as the Tropic of Capricorn, and from the upper or
north part to the lower or south, about two thousand
miles; its entire size by land measure is about three
millions of square miles, or nearly two thousand millions


of acres of land, being very nearly as large as the whole
of Europe, and ten times as large as Canada.
All this, however, cannot he sown with corn or em-
ployed for sheep pasture. In all countries there is a
great deal of what is called ?waste land;? there are also
sandy plains, like those near Salisbury and in many parts
of Scotland; there are swampy grounds, like those in
Norfolk, and in the south and west of Ireland ; besides
which there are rocky mountains, as are seen in many
parts of England and Scotland. Still, if it is allowed that
only one-half of Australia is good land, that will yet be
twelve times as large as the whole of England, Scotland,
and Ireland : quite sufficient to give employment for all
the unemployed and half-employed populations of this
country for many hundreds of years to come.
It may here be observed that the general description
we shall give of this immense island applies principally
to the coast and about four or five hundred miles inland ;
for although the country was discovered so long ago as
the year 1604, and has been settled on by Englishmen
during the last seventy years, the interior is little, if at
all, known, and a journey across the island has never yet
been accomplished. As far as we know of Australia at
present, its mountains, forests, rivers, and lakes ai'e
smaller than might have been expected. Generally
speaking, it has what is called an undulating surface,
with some mountains running through it in various
places. The rivers are sometimes of great length, but
seldom wide or deep for any distance, and but few are
navigable for many miles, with one striking exception,
viz., the river Murray, in South Australia, which has re-
cently been navigated by steam-boats a distance of 1900
miles. The forests are not so large as in America; still
there is no want of timber, and that of the most useful
kinds, some of the trees growing to an immense size.
The seasons are there the reverse of those in England,
our winter time being their summer, whilst our warm
months are their coldest. Winter, however, in Aus-
tralia is a very different season to ours, not lasting more
than three months, and then hardly cold enough to re-


quire fires ; the frost is scarcely felt, and snow is hardly
ever seen, except on the tops of the hills. Their summer
weather lasts for nearly eight months, and it is warmer
than the same season in this country. Two crops of
grain are frequently obtained from the same land in one
year, and many farms are annually cropped for twenty
years without manuring.
The only eatable fruits common to the country are
some few berries; but the soil and climate are so favour-
able, that settlers have been able to grow every fruit and
vegetable known in Europe and Asia.
Of animals natural to the country there are not many,
the principal being the kangaroo and the opossum, an
animal resembling a rabbit, feeding on grass and leaves, and
living in the hollows of decayed gum, box, or stringy bark
trees. Bandicoots and kangaroo rats are also numerous,
and very good eating. The wild dog is also numerous and
troublesome in most parts. The horse, the sheep, the
goat, the pig, and horned cattle have been introduced
from England, and thrive exceedingly, well; and the wool,
tallow, and hides of Australia form a very valuable portion
of the trail e of the country.
Birds are more numerous, though water-fowl are not
plentiful. Turkeys, wild ducks, geese, teal, parrots, and
bronzed-winged pigeons are all plentiful, and good eating.
The parrots, paroquets, and cockatoos are perhaps
more beautiful than in any othei: part of the world.
Eagles, hawks, falcons, crows, magpies, and,swallows are
everywhere to be met with, as well as a bird not unlike
the ostrich, called the emu.
The rivers yield perch, eels, and cod-fish ; the latter are
taken in the Murray, weighing sometimes 70 lbs. Many
excellent fish are to be obtained along the coasts. Whales
frequently come into the bays to calve, and the seal is
found in the coves to the southward.
There are not many snakes, and but few of those veno-
mous. Mosquitoes and white ants are, however, numerous
and troublesome.
Australia is rich in minerals. Gold is abundant in the
entire mountain range which extends from the south-


eastern portion of South Australia, through the colony of
Victoria to the east coast of New South Wales, near
Moreton Bay. Copper ore is found in large quantities in
South Australia, and coal mines are worked in New
South Wales and in Yan Diemen?s Land.
The principal rivers are the Swan on the west, the
Murray, the Hindmarsh, the Gllenelg, and the Murrum-
bidgee on the south, the Hawkesbury, the Nepean, the
Shoalhaven, the Dish, the Clarence, the Macquarie, the
Hunter, and the Hastings on the east, and the Prince
Itegent on the north-west.
The largest mountains are those in the vicinity of
Sydney, called the Blue Mountains. These extend for a
great distance along the coast, and are upwards of 3500
feet high in some parts. Pew of the other ranges of hills
are more than 2000 feet in height, most of them are less.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
We will now proceed to describe the position, extent,
and natural and industrial features of that part of this
great island which was first colonized by Englishmen,
and which may be found on the east coast, or right-
hand side of the map, under the name of New South
Wales.
This tract of country, although it does not look very
large on the map, contains upwards of three hundred
millions of acres, of which about six millions of acres
only are inoccupation. New South Wales is larger than
the kingdom of Portugal, and more than three times
the size of the kingdom of Hanover, in Germany. The
northern boundary on the coast is Cape Yorke, but
settlers have not as yet gone further than Port Curtis,
about 750 miles from Sydney, the seat of government.
The southern coast boundary is Cape Howe, the coast
line being 2250 miles from Cape Yorke to Cape Howe.
The colony is divided into counties, of which twenty-
two are officially described, and also sixteen squatting
districts, the whole being divided again into thirty-one
?electoral districts, for returning members to the legis-
lative assemblies. The divisions of counties are scarcely


known to the settlers, who speak only of the districts
of the Hawkesbury, of Hunter?s Elver, of Bathurst, of
Argyle, of Port Macquarie, of Port Curtis, etc.
The face of the country is pleasantly varied by moun-
tains, valleys, extensive plains, and rivers. There is a
mountain range, about fifty miles from the sea-shore,
which extends from Bass?s Straits, to Yorke?s Peninsula.
This mountain ? belt ? is known in different parts of the
colony as?the 4 ? Blue Mountains,? in the vicinity of
Sydney; the ?Liverpool Eange? in the northern, and
the ? Australian Alps ? in the southern districts. ? Be-
tween them and the coast is a beautifully fertile tract of
country.
The principal towns are Sydney (the capital), Parra-
matta, Newcastle, Eichmond, Liverpool, Windsor,
Cambletown, Maitland, and Bathurst.
The seat of government, Sydney, is on the Parramatta
Eivcr, and about seven miles inland from Port Jackson,
a most extensive and safe harbour for ships of any size.
This port is narrow at the entrance, but afterwards
widens to three miles, and is navigable for the largest
vessels, for seven miles beyond Sydney; so that large
ships with cargoes sail close to the wharves and jetties
of the town, and discharge their goods with the greatest
ease and quickness.
Although previous to the year 1788 there had not
been a single European in the country, and after this
time, for many years, only convicts and soldiers, the
progress of the towns and the increase of the free
population have been remarkable. Sydney extends, at the
present day, two miles along the bank of the river, and
contains above 60,000 inhabitants. The colony is governed
by a Grovernor, appointed by the Queen, assisted
by a council and a Legislative Assembly, the latter
elected by the inhabitants. Sydney has a mayor, and
aldermen and councilmen, like the large towns in
England; and amongst the public and other buildings
are churches, a town hall, markets, theatres, distilleries,
hotels, etc. There are also plenty of omnibuses, coaches,
and cabs, as in London; and there are twenty-one


steamers employed in the intercolonial trade, besides-
six plying as passage-boats in the harbour. Indeed,
Sydney is now very like an English town, and what used
formerly to be thought a great disadvantage to it, the
convict establishment of transported prisoners, is now
at an end, as none are again to be sent there.
"When this colony was first settled in 1788, there
were only 1000 persons sent. Thirty-three years later,
there were 29,783 inhabitants, a great part of whom
were convicts. In 1836 there were 77,096 persons in
the colony; last year the population was 231,088, of
whom 131,368 were males, and 99,720 females. In 1853
there were 420 schools in the colony, educating 13,575
boys, and 12,085 girls.
The first brick house was built in 1791, three years
after the settlement of the colony ; last year there were
11,570 houses in Sydney, of* which 8973 are of stone or
brick, the remainder wooden. So numerous are the
streets, and so great the value of the ground, within the
town of Sydney at the present time, that as much as
�20,000 has been paid for an acre of building land.
Many thousands of pounds have been expended in build-
ing flour and saw mills and other manufactories. Among
the business premises may be enumerated 72 steam,
mills, 28 water, 23 wind, and 20 horse mills; 66 tanneries,
12 breweries, 11 soap manufactories, producing 41,678-
cwt. of soap; 14 tobacco manufactories, producing 3524
cwt.; 7 woollen factories,' producing 146,000 yards of
cloth and tweeds; 3 sugar refineries, producing 81,200
cwt. of sugar; 10 iron and brass foundries; 39 boiling-
down establishments, at which 96,895 sheep were
slaughtered in 1853, and 29,959 horned cattle, producing
64,485 cwt. of tallow.
In 1810, the live stock of New South Wales consisted;
of 1100 horses, 11,200 horned cattle, 9000 pigs, and
34,500 sheep. Last year, there were 139,765 horses,
1,552,285 head of horned cattle, 71,395 pigs, and
7,929,708 sheep.
The rearing of stock is the most profitable occupation,
in the colony ; and the wool, tallow, hides, and live stock


form the greater part of the shipments. The exports for
1858, exclusive of gold, consisted of wool, in value
�1,005,546; tallow, �27,097; hides, �28,219; hoops,
horns, and bones, �4839; sheep, �15,732; horses,
�11,696; horned cattle, �BBBI.
The climate of this part of the continent is exceedingly
healthy and mild; the temperature of the warm months
of November, December, January, and February being
very little more than that of many parts of England in
July and August. There are seldom more than twenty
or thirty stormy days during the year ; and so clear and
fine is the atmosphere, that twenty cloudy days scarcely
occur during twelve months.
The winter season is pleasant and bracing, and not
often so cold as in our spring months, and seldom so low as
at the freezing point; except, perhaps, on the tops of the
higher mountains, or in the more northern towns.
The rainy months are March, April, and August, but
there are not often more than fifty or sixty wet days in
the year. This colony, however, being of great extent,
and many hundreds of miles in length from its northern
to its southern boundary, it follows, as a matter of course,
that the climate will differ according as the emigrant
locates in the southerly or northerly counties. In the
Moreton Bay district, which is far to the north, and
nearer the line, the winter will be much milder than at
Sydney; whilst, on the other hand, there are settlements
to the south, and therefore further from the line, which
are colder than the Sydney district. At Bathurst, on the
hills, the seasons approach more nearly to this country.
Having such a mild climate, and, in most places, a soil
of excellent quality, the colonists have been able to grow
wheat, barley, oats, rye, Indian corn, millet, tobacco, and
potatoes in large quantities, and of first-rate quality. In
1853, by the official returns, the following number of
acres were under cultivation : ?Wheat, 74,537 acres, pro-
ducing 138,454 bushels; Indian corn, 24,234 acres, yield-
ing 684,253 bushels ; barley, 3937 acres, 69,128 bushels ;
oats, 2398 acres, 36,886 bushels; rye, 97 acres, 1869
bushels; millet, 44 acres, 536 bushels; potatoes, 5050


acres, yielding 20,808 tons; tobacco, 32 acres, giving
342 cwt.; grasses, 27,723 acres, producing 34,595 tons
of hay.
During the last few years the introduction of the vine
has proved another source of prorit to the settlers, who-
have now no less than 1000 acres under this cultivation,
yielding annually 92,744 gallons of wine of good quality,
and 1581 gallons of brandy.
In the same way the settlers have succeeded in rearing
not onlv every vegetable and fruit known in an English
market, hut also the delicious productions of the tropics,
which appear to thrive in New South Wales and other
parts of Australia quite as well as in the warmer coun-
tries of India. In proof of which we extract the account
given by Mr. Mossman ot his luncheon at the Sydney
club-house ?We had turtle from Moreton Bay?al-
though not so rich in flavour as West Indian, yet it makes
good soup ; sole and schnapper from Botany Bay ; wild
turkey from the plains; ducks and pigeons from
Hunter?s Eiver, rolling in fat. The vegetables are sweet
and juicy, and the salad crisp, having been cut before
sunrise ; and those smiling black-coated potatoes from
Yan Diemen?s Land, the finest in the world. Here are
pine-apples and bananas from Moreton Bay and Bris-
bane Water, where, in the former locality, they grow like
cabbages, in the open air; oranges from the extensive
groves near Parramatta, where their blossoms flavour the
honey; melons, grapes, peaches, nectarines, plums, lo-
quats, and other fruits, from the neighbourhood of the
town; gooseberries, currants, raspberries, strawberries,
apples, and pears, from Yan Diemen?s Land. And here
we can wash them down with a glass of native-grown
wine: first, an excellent species ot sauterne from Camden,
which is the chief character of the Australian vintage;
next, a tolerable claret, from Begentville; a miudling
sort of Madeira, from Yarroville; and a brisk glass ot
Burnett?s champagne, from Hunter?s Eiver.?


VICTORIA.
The settlement adjoining New* South Wales, and which
until lately formed a part of that colony, has been hitherto
known by the name of Port Phillip, or Australia Pelix,
and has only taken the name of Victoria since 1850. It
is now quite separate from the Government of Sydney,
.and has a Governor and civil establishment of its own.
This colony is situated on the most southern end of the
Australian continent, exactly opposite the small island
of Van Diemen?s Land, from which it is only separated
by about 200 miles of sea, called Bass?s Straits. The
district extends from Cape Howe, the southern end of
New South Wales, inland, across the Australian Alps,
to the -nearest point of the river Murray, down that
river to the eastern boundary of South Australia, and
along that boundary in a southerly direction to the sea-
coast. The entire district is divided into twenty-three
counties, and contains about fifty-one millions of square
acres.
The first notice which appears to have been taken of
the country in this part of Australia was in 1827, by some
few settlers of the New South Wales territory, who were
well pleased with the fertile appearance of the land; and
so highly did they report upon its suitability for sheep
pasturage that, in the following year, the Governor
formed a small military fort there, with a view of encou-
raging farmers to locate upon the land. This first
attempt, however, was a failure, from some cause, and
nothing more was known of Port Phillip for eight years,
when the graziers of Van Diemen?s Land sent over large
flocks of sheep and great numbers of cattle, and bargained
for considerable tracts of the pasture-ground from the
natives. So well suited was the district for sheep-walks,
that the little settlement rapidly increased, and very soon
attracted the attention of the Governor of New South
Wales, who, in 183G, appointed magistrates to administer
justice. In the following year the town of Melbourne
was laid out by Crown officers, deputed to survey and
sell the land.


This province has a sea-coast of six hundred miles in
extent, containing many fine bays and inlets. The prin-
cipal harbour for shipping is Port Phillip, capable of con-
taining in safety, at all seasons, the largest fleet. It has
a narrow and, at times, difficult entrance, but widens and
runs inwards for thirty miles. At the north-east ex-
tremity of it is the anchorage ground, called Hobson?s
Bay, whence there is the Yarra Yarra Biver, communicat-
ing with Melbourne. On the western side of the large
inlet is situated Korio Bay, the harbour to the town of
G-eelong. Portland Bay is a fine harbour on the western
extremity of the sea-coast, near the boundary of South
Australia; it is the resort of whaling ships, who find pro-
fitable employment near its shores. A settlement has
already been formed there, and it may be expected at no
very distant time to be a place of some importance.
There is another harbour to the eastward of Port
Phillip, called Port Western, having some small islands
within it. The country in the neighbourhood of this is
fertile, and rather more thickly wooded with useful
timber. Potatoes are grown here to a considerable
extent, for exportation to Melbourne.
The principal river is the Glenelg, which runs nearly
south for 300 miles, rising in the Grampian Mountains,
and emptying its waters into the ocean. It is navigable
for large vessels, but its entrance is blocked up by a bar
of sand. The Yarra Yarra is only navigable as far as
Melbourne for ships of 200 tons. The Wiinmera is an
inland river, rising amongst the Grampians, and, after
running for 150 miles, discharges itself into Lake Hind-
marsh. The Hume is a noble river, taking its rise
amongst the Australian Alps, and forming the northern
boundary of the province. The other rivers are the
Murray, 300 miles in length; the Goulburn, the Loddon,
the Margalong, the Barwon, the Campaspe, the Surry,
the Fitzroy, the Moyn, and several others.
The Grampians are a range of mountains, rising
in some parts as high as 3000 feet. Mount Macedon
stands by itself, and is said to be 3500 feet high. There


is also the range called the Pyrenees, and other smaller
mounts, as also an extinct volcano.
The soil of this province is remarkably fertile, being
a rich sandy loam, and produces the most abundant crops
of rich, luxuriant grass, well adapted for feeding all kinds
of live stock. The face of the country, for some few
miles inland from the sea, is one vast plain of grass land;
further in, it is varied by a succession of gently rising
hills and sloping valleys, pleasantly watered by small
streams, and lightly covered by trees, some of ?which are
of lofty growth.
Being further to the south, it is somewhat cooler than
in New South Wales or South Australia, and warmer
than in Van Diemen?s Land, being similar to that of
Montpellier in winter, and to that of Naples in summer,
the thermometer rarely passing 98 degrees, or receding
below freezing point during the day. There is, however,
an exception to this, during the prevalence of the ?hot
winds,? which usually occur at the end of January or
early in Pebruary, at which time the thermometer has
been known to rise to 117� in the shade. These ? hot
winds ? rarely last longer than two or three days.
The capital, or seat of government, is Melbourne,
built on the banks of the river Yarra Yarra, a river
running inland from Hobson?s Bay, from which port
the city is distant about eight miles. There is now a
railway connecting Melbourne with the port, at a place
called Sandridge.
The other towns arc Geelong, Portland, Belfast, and
Port Albert. . , , .
A few years since, the toivn of Melbourne consisted of
a collection of wooden houses and mud huts; now the
city numbers between seven and eight thousand substan-
tial and w'ell-built houses and stores of stone and brick,
and numerous public edifices. The city is rapidly in-
creasing in size ; hotels and restaurants are being built,
at a prodigious expense, in every part of the tow n and
its suburbs. Stores and shops of a superior description
are springing up on all sides. Concerts take place almost
every night, where music of a very creditable order can


be heard, and the theatre, circus, and dancing rooms are
nightly crowded. There are several cricket clubs, who
weekly hold their matches, and steeple-chases in the
suburbs each month.
A little more than twelve months since, North Mel-
bourne was merely the site of a few scattered tents;
it now contains a population of several thousands, with
comfortable houses, shops, hotels, and schools, to meet
the wants of its inhabitants. Townships have sprung up
in localities where, a short time ago, there was not a
single dwelling of any description.
The Church establishment is not overlooked; there is
a Bishop and an Archdeacon, and a numerous clergy.
There are 49 places of worship in the colony, of which
13 are Church of England, 7 Presbyterians, 17 Wesley-
ans, 3 Independents, 2 Baptists, 6 Eomau Catholics,
and 1 Jews? synagogue.
Education, so necessary in a young colony, has not
been forgotten here. The Government affords grants in
aid of all schools, in proportion to the daily attendance
of scholars. In 1853, there were 115 schools, with
7841 pupils.
The rapidity with which this colony has risen to im-
portance may be gathered by looking at the population,
and the amount of its trade with other places.
In 1836, the population of this province was 224
souls ; in 1854, it amounted to 235,000. In 1853, its
imports of British goods amounted to �7,056,334, and
its shipments of produce, chiefly gold, wool, and tallow,
�14,000,000. Here, where fourteen years since the
sheep of the colony numbered but 500,000, the quantity
of wool now shipped in one year to Great Britain is
upwards of 20,047,453 lbs.; more than equal to the con-
sumption of German and Spanish wool, which not many
years since supplied our manufacturers with all they
required. It is worthy of remark, that a bale of wool
costs less in freight and other shipping expenses from
Melbourne to Loudon, than from Germany to this
country.
The weight of an ordinary sheep in this colony is


about 60 lbs.; it is reckoned, that from each animal the
farmer obtains about 2| or 3 lbs. of wool, and 26 lbs. of
good tallow.
The tallow trade is becoming of considerable value
there are now ten establishments for boiling down, in
which about 150,000 animals are annually slaughtered.
At Melbourne,- there are also candle and soap works, and
meat is now salted, and preserved fresh to some extent,,
for the supply of shipping.
So rich is the soil near the volcanic remains, that
wheat grows as high as seven feet, and as much as sixty
and seventy bushels are obtained from an acre. Oats
yield ninety bushels per acre, and Indian com one hun-
dred.
The latest returns state the quantity of land under
cultivation to be?of wheat, 16,823 acres; maize, 1; barley,
411; oats, 2947; potatoes, 1978 ; grasses, 14,101 ; green
fodder, 401 ; and the vine, 107 acres, yielding 4500
gallons of wine, and 500 gallons of brandy.
In 1838, two years after the first flock was landed
from Launceston, the sheep numbered 200,000. Last
year the live stock of the colony amounted to 34,021
horses, 531,380 horned cattle, 8996 pigs, and 6,551,501
sheep.
There were also in the colony 13 breweries, 20 coach
manufactories, 9 tanneries, 4 engineering establishments,
2 foundries, 2 ship-builders, 12 steam and 10 water corn-
mills, 5 saw-mills ; of quarries, there are 14 limestone, 1
freestone, 1 sandstone, and 6 granite stone.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
We will now proceed to the colony which joins the-
western boundary of the last-described settlement. The
reader having the map of Australia or New Holland
before him, will at once see that South Australia is situ-
ated next to, and on the left side of, Victoria or Port
Phillip.
The district is marked out by three lines, forming,
with the sea boundary, a figure very nearly square in
shape. The contents of this colony, though but a small


fragment of Australia, is in reality nearly 200,000,000
of acres, or more than twice the size of the?United King-
dom. It is three times the size of Prussia, eight times
the extent of Portugal, and quite twenty times the size
of the kingdom of Hanover. Although the first emi-
grants arrived here only in 1836, the population amounts
to 81,702 persons, not tiny of whom are convicts.
This colony possesses many excellent advantages,
amongst which may be instanced an extent of 900 miles
of sea-coast, containing large gulfs and bays, which form
good harbours for shipping, easy of access, and well pro-
tected from bad weather. Gulf Spencer lays to the west-
ward. Gulf St. Yincent will be found on the east or
Victoria side of the colony. The latter gulf is very large
and protected from the sea by an island at its entrance*
called Kangaroo Island. It contains several good bays
or harbours, for vessels to anchor in. One of these, on
the eastern or right-hand side, is called Port Adelaide
and is the harbour for all ships bound to the capital of
this colony, which is about six miles inland from it
having a good level road all the way, on which a railway
has been commenced. J
The climate, soil, and features of South Australia do
not differ very much from those of the neighbouring
settlements. The greater portion of this colony is much
nearer the tropics, and therefore warmer at times than
Victoria; but it is further from the tropics than a great
part of the New South Wales territory, and the city of
Adelaide, its capital, is farther south than Sydney the
capital of the latter.
During the warm season, in December and January,
the glass will be sometimes as high as 105 degrees, but
this is not felt more than 85 degrees would be in England,
owing to the greater purity of the atmosphere there, and
the continual cool sea-breezes. The average of the ther-
mometer in summer is 73 degrees, and in winter 55
degrees. So clear is the sky and so pure the air, that
persons who have been suffering in England from coughs
and general disease of the lungs very soon recover in
couth Australia.


There is no endemic disease in this colony. Dysentery
is prevalent, but yields readilv to treatment. It is caused
by improper diet and clothing; and diseases of the eyes
are frequent in summer, irritated by the impalpable dust
of the streets and roads, or occasioned by exposure in the
night air after being subjected to the glare ot a cloudless
"The quantity of rain which falls at Adelaide during a
year is twenty inches, which is one inch less than the
yearly quantity in London. , n
The mountains of South Australia are not so loity nor
of such extent, as those in other parts of the continent.
The principal are known as the Mount Lofty Kange,
and Flinders? Range; the highest points of which are not
above 3000 feet, but generally lower. .
There are many small streams, but only one river ot
any size; this is the Murray, some of the sources of
which, or of its tributaries, are to be found within 100
miles of Moreton Bay, on the eastern shore of New South
Wales stringing their way to the westward through the
northern boundaries of that colony and of Victoria, and
finally discharges its drainage of a territory nearly equal
in extent to Europe into the Lake Alexandria, thence
into the sea at Encounter Bay. This noble river is now-
navigated by steam-boats from the Goolwa, in South
Australia, to Albany, in New South Wales, a distance ot
1900 miles. ,
The face of the country, though generally open and
slightly hilly, like much of the park scenery in this
country, is in many places thickly covered by brushwood
and heavy timber, much of the latter being of a very
useful kind. As in the other Australian colonies, all the
European and most of the Indian fruits and vegetables
have been successfully cultivated here.
The soil of South Australia is not inferior to any on
that vast continent, and the great abundance of limestone
promises well for the capabilities of the colony for pro-
ducing grain. Of late years, wheat, oats, and barley, ot
superior quality, have been grown, and some samples of
them forwarded to England were pronounced by persons


well qualified to form an opinion to be equal, and in some
cases superior, to the English prize grain. South Aus-
tralian wheat has been sold in Mark-lane at 53 5. per
quarter.
The chief source of the present prosperity of South
Australia is to be found in its numerous and valuable
mines of copper and lead. Grold and silver mines are
also established, but these ores are as yet found in uncer-
tain quantities. Iron ore is also most abundant. Since
the discovery of this mineral wealth, above thirty-five
mines have been brought into working by twenty-six
companies, most of which have been formed in the colo ny
by colonial capital. So abundant is the copper ore in
some places, that it is removed from the surface of the
land without having recourse to shafts or pits ; the best
ore yields from thirty to forty per cent, of pure metal.
The profits arising from these undertakings appear mar-
vellous. One company, the ?Burra Burra,? has paid
dividends to the amount of one thousand per cent, per
annum, or one hundred pounds yearly for every ten
pounds of capital.
'Next in importance to its mines is the wool trade.
Where, a little more than sixteen years since, not a white
man or animal, save the kangaroo or wild dog, was seen,
there are now 1,500,000 sheep, 100,000 horned cattle,
and 8000 horses.
The cultivation of grain has steadily progressed during
the last ten years ; the extent of wheat in cultivation in
this colony has, in this time, risen from eight thousand
acres to fifty-two thousand. The total of cultivated land
has increased, since 1841, from 6722 acres to 84,500
acres, in 1854. Of these, 32,000 acres are in the Adelaide
district, where also are 252 acres of vineyard.
There are no less than 11,980 square miles of land
occupied for pastoral purposes on leases, but open to
purchasers at an upset price of �1 per acre.
Adelaide, the capital, is built upon the north and south
banks of the river Torrens. North Adelaide contains
300 acres, and South Adelaide 700 acres. The river is
crossed by a large stone bridge, on passing which, into


South Adelaide, the road is fenced in on both sides, and
runs through the park lands, also fenced, which surround
the town; the road, up a gentle hill, then turns to the
right along North Terrace, in front of the Government
House, This terrace boasts of many neat villas, with
handsome gardens and neat verandahs, also some sub-
stantial and ornamental stone and brick buildings, as the
Australian Company?s offices, the Bank of South Aus-
tralia, and, farther on, Trinity Church ; on the same side
as the Government House is the Legislative Council
House. A turn to the left, past the Post Office, takes
the visitor up King William Street, lined on one side
with comfortable houses and shops, and on the other
with the stock yards and other buildings belonging to
the Auction Mart, at the corner of the street. Hindley
Street is the principal place of business, and here is to be
found all the bustle of a flourishing town, the way being
filled with heavy drays loaded with produce, drawn by
four, six, or eight bullocks, and accompanied by the
drivers, shouting and cracking their long whips; also
with waggons and carts, drawn by strong English-
looking horses, and mingled with gigs, carriages, and
horsemen, all seemingly eager in business or pleasure.
Hindley Street is lined on both sides with good stone,
brick, or wooden houses; many of the stores or mer-
chants? warehouses are massive stone or brick buildings,
The principal public edifices are the churches of Trinity
and St. John?s, and three or four commodious chapels
belonging to different sects, the Government House and
offices, the Court House, the Bank of South Australia,
and the Australasian and Union Banks. Adelaide has
also a mechanics? institute, with public library attached;
a savings? bank, and various benefit, building, and in-
surance companies. There are in the colony no less than
thirty-two steam, wind, and water flour-mills at work,
and nineteen in course of erection, besides maltings,
tanneries, and copper smelting works. At Port Adelaide
there is a Custom-house, also large wharves and ware-
houses, where ships lie close to the shore, as in our docks.
Perfect religious toleration has been all along a


fundamental principle in this colony. There are 22
churches of the English establishment, presided over by a
bishop ; there are nine of the Church of Scotland, seven of
the Church of Eome, 40 edifices devoted to worship be-
longing to the Wesleyans, and 51 of other dissenters, 12
of the Lutheran church, a meeting-house of the Society
of Eriends, and a Jews? synagogue. Adelaide boasts of
a College ; and there are also 81 public day schools and
45 Sunday schools, at which nearly 6000 children attend.'
These are in addition to numerous private schools in the
city, and in many parts of the settled districts.
Fifteen years since, the value of exports from
this colony was �15,000; in 1853 they amounted to
�2,241,813. -
Previous to 1845 the sales of Crown lands rarely
-exceeded �5OOO a year; in 1853 the land sold realized
�373,881 12�. 3d.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The colony now to be described is the tract of country
marked on the map, to the west, or left side of South
Australia, as Western Australia, and known in former
years as the Swan Elver settlement.
This part of the Australian continent contains one
million of square miles, which is fully eight times as large
as the United Kingdom, five times the size of Spain, and
three times the extent of the Canadas. To the south or
lower part of this settlement is the Pacific Ocean, to the
north-west of it lays the Indian Ocean. Its length
from north to south is 1280 miles ; its breadth from east
to west is 800 miles.
There are no very lofty ranges of mountains here, the
highest being not more than 1500 feet above the level of
the sea. The Darling, the Victoria, Moresby?s, Ilerschel,
and Oairdner?s ranges are the principal hills, but there
are other elevated ridges of less magnitude. The four
latter ranges of hills we name are to the northward of
the settled districts, between Shark?s Bay and the county
of Melbourne. Most of them are well wooded with
heavy timber, and watered by numerous streams.


The only bays or gulfs in this colony are Shark?s Bay,
far to the northward; Geographe Bay, Champion Bay,
Blinders? Bay, Bur Bay, Doubtful Island Bay, and King
George?s Sound on the sonth coast.
The rivers are all very small, and scarcely deserve to
be considered as more than mere streams. The princi-
pal of them is Swan River, running for about 150 miles,
but navigable for boats only fifty miles. The Canning, the-
Gascoigne, the Greenough, the Hutt, the Irvin, the Mur-
ray, the Harvey, the Preston, the Colleir, the Yasse, and
the Brunswick, are all very small rivers.
The colony, as far as it has been settled, has been
divided into twenty-six counties. Although all these
divisions have been made, and their proper boun-
daries marked on the maps, the reader must not imagine
that these counties all contain towns, villages, and inha-
bitants. This is not yet the case; though we do not
doubt that before very long a large increase to the
settled districts will be made, now that the capabilities
and resources of the colony are becoming more developed,
by the introduction of convict labour, and a large com-
missariat expenditure upon that service.
The soil of this country, as in other parts of Australia,
varies much, perhaps more so than in other settlements.
Near the sea-coast it is far from being fertile, consisting
mostly of a light sandy loam, laying over a limestone
bottom. There are, however, some fine tracts of fine grass
lands and arable soils ranging along the courses of some
of the rivers, and stretching from the bases of the loftier
mountain ranges. A large extent of good land has been
explored to the northward of the county of Melbourne,
stretching along the course of the Greenough River, not
far from the Victoria range, and consisting of both arable-
and pasture land.
Amongst the timber peculiar to this part of Australia
are the jarrat and sandal wood, of which there is abun-
dance, enough to supply all the navies of the world with
ship timber. One forest alone isi computed to contain
timber sufficient to build 18,000 line-of-battle ships. This
timber lasts for many years, and possesses the peculiar


property of resisting dry rot, [sea-worm, and the white
ant.
The animals, birds, fish, reptiles, and insects of this
colony do not differ from those of the other settlements,
and which have already been described.
Fremantle is the principal sea-port town of Western
Australia, situate on a point of land at the entrance of
Swan River; it contains numerous wharves, stores, and
good houses, built mostly of white stone.
Perth is the capital or seat of government of the
colony, distant from the port about eleven miles, on the
banks of the river Swan. Passage-boats ply regularly
between the port and capital, performing the voyage in
about two hours.
The town of Perth consists principally of the High
Street, and is about two miles in length. The private
houses and stores stand for the most part separately from
each other, having various-sized gardens in front. A new
and handsome church has been built; and the clay and
wooden houses of the early settlers are now very gene-
rally superseded by substantial buildings of brick and
stone, among the most conspicuous of which are the
Governor?s house, court-house, barracks, and commis-
sariat stores.
The town contains several excellent hotels, private
lodging and boarding houses; also a public library,
mechanics? institute, boarding, day, and Sunday schools.
There are 29 mills, eight limekilns and quarries, a soap
manufactory, one ditto for pig lead, and a few others.
Two newspapers are published in the town.
King George?s Sound is a large bay on the south coast
of this colony, to the eastward of Cape Lewin. It has a
capacious harbour, which is much frequented by shipping,
and is a coal depot for steamers. The country around is
exceedingly fertile and well watered.
Albany is the town of this district, and is built in a gorge
between two hills extending along the base. The town
contains about 200 houses, mostly built of brick or stone.
The inhabitants are chiefly employed in rearing stock and
cultivating vegetables, for the supply of the shipping.


The next principal towns are Guildford, situate on
the banks of the Swan, about twelve miles from Perth;
York, situate at the base of a hill named Mount Bake-
well; and Australind, in the vicinity of Leschenault Inlet,
about ninety-five miles south of Premantle. The imme-
diate vicinity of Leschenault is remarkable for the beauty
of its scenery, the fertility of its soil, and the superior
quality of its timber.
This part of Australia is not deficient in mineral
riches ; copper ore is abundant, and a mine is worked on
the banks of the Murchison Elver, only twenty-five miles
from the beach, at Champion Bay. Vast quantities
of the richest iron ore are to be found in various
parts of the colony. Lead is also profitably worked at
the Geraldine mines. Coal has been discovered, in
seams of seven feet in thickness, of first-rate quality,
and requiring neither sinking nor draining.
Guano abounds on the islands about Shark?s Bay, and
a pearl bank has been discovered, and taken possession
of by the local authorities.
Prom various causes, the progress of this colony has
not been at all equal to that of any other of the Aus-
tralian settlements. Twenty years ago, the European
population numbered 1500; in 1853, the whole number of
inhabitants was but 9331, of whom 1151 were convicts.
The stock at the same period consisted of 3986 horses,
20,265 horned cattle, 4151 pigs, and 157,968 sheep.
There are in the colony eight churches of the English
?establishment, one Eoraan Catholic, and three chapels of
various dissenters.
The official returns state that 1,332,302 acres have
been granted or sold, and yet it appears that only
10,299 acres are under cultivation.
tan diemen?s land.
The colony next to be described, and which will com-
plete the Australian settlements, is that of the island of
Van Diemen?s Land, or, as it has sometimes been called,
Tasmania.
This the reader will find, by looking to the map of the


Southern Hemisphere, to the southward of, that is below,
the Sydney and Victoria colonies. It is an island quite
distinct from the main continent of Australia, and
only divided from it by the narrow sheet of water called
Bass?s Straits. Its name was given to it in honour of
the Dutch governor of Batavia, Van Diemen, who had
sent the discoverer of it, Abel Jansen Tasman, to explore
the eastern and southern portions of the continent of
Hew Holland, then very little known. It comprises
several islands within its limits, and the average length
is 165 miles, and the average breadth 155 miles; the
area is estimated at 23,800 square miles, or 15,232,000
square acres, about equal to the size of Ireland or the
Netherlands, and half as large again as either Switzer-
land or the kingdom of Hanover.
This island has an extensive line of coast, broken into
at various points by deep bays and inlets, affording
not only accommodation for any amount of foreign trade,
but facilitating the transport of produce from one part
of the colony to another.
About forty miles to the west, and the same distance
from the north coast, a table-land, of about 1| million
acres in extent, rises about 3000 feet above the level of
the sea. On this elevated land are numerous lakes,
which form the heads of the principal streams flowing
to the south, the west, and the north; and from it a
spur or mountain range, running in a direction a little to
the east of south, and separating the valley of the
Derwent from that of the Grordon and Huon Divers,
has hitherto proved an almost impassable barrier to the
progress of the population towards the west coast,
A mountainous range, of less decided character, and
broken through at one point by the valley of the South
Esk, separates the more central districts from those on
the east coast. The principal part of the population of
the island is thus, at present, confined to a narrow strip
of land between these two ranges of hills.
The larger portion of the land to the west of the Tamar,
and between the lofty plateau before alluded to and the
sea, is covered with a forest of heavy timber; but the land


is of the best quality, and the timber, in consequence of
the demand which exists in Victoria for building and
other purposes, is most valuable, and repays by its sale
not only the cost of clearing the land, but also the pur-
chase-money of the and itself.
There is a similar district, though not perhaps so ex-
tensive, on the west shore of D?Entrecasteaux?s Channel,
at the south side of the island. The timber, which is of
a better quality than that on the north coast, is, owing
to the facility afforded by the sheltered inlets of the
channel, brought to market more readily, and therefore
more cheaply and profitably.
There are some extensive inland lakes, one or two of
which are on the higher range of mountains. Of those,
the chief is the Great or Clarence Lake, many miles in
extent, and at a height of nearly 4000 feet; from it flows
the river Shannon. Lake St. Clair is fully 3200 feet
above the sea, feeding the Derwent River. There are
also Lakes Arthur, Crescent, Echo, Tiberias, Barker,
Peddar, and Jordan.
The principal river is the Derwent, rising from Lake
St. Clair, distant from Hobart Town about eighty miles,
in a north-westerly direction, and reaching the town,
after a very irregular course through a fertile country.
It empties itself into Storm Bay, and is navigable for
large merchant vessels for some distance beyond Hobart
Town, and for country ships of less tonnage, up as high
as New Norfolk. The Tamar is the next in importance
to the river just named: it is situated on the north side
of the island, and has a navigation for ships of 600 tons,
for a distance of forty miles. On its banks is situated
the town of Launceston, the chief city of the north dis-
trict of the island; it is four or five miles wide in some
parts, but generally not more than one mile. The other
large rivers are the Huon, the Macquarie, the Arthur,
and the Gordon, besides many small streams on the
north, and some few on the south coast.
The island, in general, is covered with an open forest,
without much underwood, and consisting of the different
gum trees, wattles, stringy bark, she-oak, and other trees


bearing colonial names, all of which are evergreens;
the timber being in some situations close and heavy, and
in others the scenery resembling that of a park. The
natural pasture of both hills and plains affords support
to sheep, which are the chief source of profit to the
settlers, and also to cattle and horses. Turnip husbandry
is becoming general. The wheat of Van Diemen s Land
is considered of the finest quality ; and the potatoes are
excellent, forming an important article of the most pro-
fitable exportation to the neighbouring colonies. Sixty
bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats, and ten tons of
potatoes are frequently taken from a single acre of
land.
The soil and climate are highly favourable to English
fruits and vegetables, to the culture and improvement of
which much attention is paid.
There are large dairy establishments, and considerable
attention is given to the manufacture of and
cheese. Various kinds of excellent fish are obtained,
and also oysters. The timber of Van Diemens Land is
valuable for ship and house building, furniture, etc.;
and some kinds, which split readily, are extensively em-
ployed in making post and rail fences for the enclosure
of land, and also for making shingles, with which the
houses are covered, instead of slates. Hie colonial
gums are also useful; and the bark of the wattle-tree
is largely exported for tanning, and also used in the
colony, in the manufacture of leather. There are some
beautiful flowering shrubs, splendid ferns, and a great
variety of rich and valuable grasses. The insects and
reptiles are in nowise different from those found in the
neighbouring colonies.
There are no formidable wild animals ; and the abo-
riginal natives are almost extinct, the few who remain
living willingly in one place, protected and supported by
the Government.
This island being more to the southward, and therefore
further from the equator, as well as from its being a
small island, with the sea-breezes blowing continually
?over it, is more temperate than any of the settlements


previously described. The medium of tbe thermometer
is here about 70 degrees ; and although occasionally the
heat is much greater, yet such weather seldom lasts
longer than for a day or two, and is usually followed by
rain. Even in the middle of the warm season the nights
and mornings are pleasantly cool, and the use of blankets
at night is never discontinued. The spring here is Sep-
tember to November, when the glass is seldom above 00
degrees, with fine, bright, clear weather; the next three
months are the summer, when but little rain falls. The
winter is during June, July, and August; but it is never
so cold, even in the more elevated table-land, as to put
a stop to the operations of the farmer. The average
quantity of rain which falls in this country is about
twenty-one inches, being nearly the same as the fall in
London.
Hobart Town, the seat of government, is also the see
of an English bishop. The town is situate in Sullivan?s
Cove, an estuary of the river Derwent, forty miles within
the southern boundary of the island, and is built on a
number of hills, on the edge of a good harbour, where
ships of any size may discharge their cargoes during all
seasons. The population of the town was last year esti-
mated at 23,000 souls. The streets are wide, most of
them being well macadamized, and the footpaths paved
with flags or composition. There are some well-built
and ornamented public edifices of stone and brick,
amongst which are a block of buildings facing the New
Wharf, consisting of the Legislative Hall, Custom-
house, Post-office, etc. Near these is the Government
House. There are likewise public gaols, hospitals,
churches, etc.
Launceston is situated on the river Tamar, about forty
miles inland from the northern sea-coast, and although
it cannot be compared in size or style to the capital,
yet numbers among its population numerous clergymen,
merchants, professional gentlemen, shopkeepers, and
mechanics, and many Government officers and others.
There are also numerous townships and, villages, in
most of which are established a police magistrate, one or


more clergymen and medical practitioners, shopkeepers
and others. r
The colony was first settled in 1804, with 78 Euro-
peans and 400 convicts ; in 1853, the census showed the
population to be 68,609, of w'hom 43,127 were males
and 25,482 females.
In 1824, there vs ere but four buildings for public wor-
ship, of which two were of the Church of England.
There are now 53 places of worship of the English
Church, three Eomish, and 54 of other denominations.
Ihe number of schools is now?of Government esta-

are under cultivation; the remainder being principally

PAET 11.
Having m the preceding pages given a brief account of
the several colonies in Australia, it is now intended to
point out ?who should emigrate,? and then to assist,
such as may require, with the necessary directions ? how
to get to Australia.?
The following chapters equally apply to the several
colonies already described, each having had a large pro-
portion of its labouring population drawn from their
ordinary pursuits by the attractions of the gold-fields ?
consequently, an increased demand exists for every de-
scription of labour. The emigrants most wanted in Aus-
tralia, and whom the several colonies will abundantly
reward for their work, are the industrious, the sober,
and the healthy of the following classes : female servants
ot every description; bakers, butchers, brickmakers,
bricklayers, blacksmiths, carters, cooks, carpenters,
curriers and tanners, farriers, gardeners, grooms,
glaziers, masons, millers, ploughmen, painters, printers,
saddle and harness makers, sawyers, shoemakers, stone-
cutters, shepherds, wheelwrights, farmers (with large or
small capital), and labourers of all kinds ; in short, every


horny-handed son of toil, who can hear heavy weights in
his brawny arms or on his broad shoulders, may confi-
dently bend his way to either of the Australian colonies.
The class of persons not wanted in these colonies are
clerks, shopmen, artists, schoolmasters, lawyers, doctors,
workmen in the finer arts, and others of no particular
occupation. These, save in occasional places and at
special times, are all mere dregs in the colonial labour-
market, and unless such are prepared to go out as mere
day labourers, and handle the spade, the pick, or the
shepherd?s staff, they had far better save the cost of their
outfit and passage, and remain where they are. Better
far be disappointed at home than in a strange land,
lf>,ooo miles away.
The same remarks are applicable to the other sex.
Governesses, milliners, dressmakers, and any females who
are not strictly of the labouring classes, are not wanted.
The Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria says, on this sub-
ject: ?There is hardly any limit to the number of
"female general and domestic servants which nnght be
judiciously introduced ; whereas, for the other class, the
demand is very restricted, and no young female is so
much out of her place here under ordinary circumstances,
or so much a cause of embarrassment to others, and so
liable to be overtaken by real destitution, as one who
possesses no resources but ordinary education and accom-
plishments, and who neither can nor will make up her
mind to descend to what she has been led, from previous
habit or association, to consider an inferior grade or ser-
vile occupation.? The following remarks, also on the
same subject, are from an official report from South
Australia: ?? The persons most out of employ are those
who never ought to have come. Farming and mining
are the staple employments, and these are not over done;
but of what use are portrait-painters, druggist?s assist-
ants, lawyer?s clerks, book-keepers, salesmen, store-
keepers, and persons who have no trade in their hands,
in a colony like this ? Care must be taken by philan-
thropic individuals only to send such as can labour hard
for their living. Bush-work is no child?s play ; and


masters who have to work hard for their own living have
?a strong desire that their workmen should be able to
endure hard work also.
?Women, too, who know nothing of housework and
the proper duties of a family are very unfit to be sent
here; because a man, having his own land and getting
ins living thereby, wants a wife who can manage in-doors
while he is doing the business of the farm. Needle-
women, ladies? maids, dressmakers, upper nurses, genteel
housekeepers, and all highly educated poor women, have
very little chance here to get on.?
Although, as previously stated, a large class of me-
chanics and labourers are greatly in demand in the
Australian colonies, yet but few of the classes named can
obtain what is commonly termed a free passage, under
the Government regulations.
The Emigration Commissioners are appointed to super-
intend the emigration of such persons as may be required
in the Australian colonies. The money for this purpose
is not provided hy this country , hut supplied entirely by
the several colonies wanting labour; consequently, the
-Commissioners are bound to study only the colonial in-
terests, and have, therefore, not to consider how distress
in this country may be best relieved, but how the largest
number of emigrants most suited for the wants of each
colony may be procured and sent out.
In deciding what classes are most suited to the wants
of the colonies, the Commissioners are guided by the
official reports received from time to time from the re-
spective colonies.
The persons at present eligible under the Commis-
sioners?regulations must be married agricultural labourers,
shepherds, herdsmen, and female domestic and farm serv-
ants ; also, married country mechanics, such as black-
smiths, bricklayers, carpenters, masons, sawyers, wheel-
wrights, and, for South Australia and New South Wales,
miners. They must be in good health, sober, of general
good character, and going out to work for wages at the
occupations described in their applications.
No family can , however , he accepted having more than.

TO NEW SOUTH WALES AND TAN DIEMEN?S LAND,
Male and female emigrants of or above 14 years of
age no longer receive free passages, but are required to
pay, either in this country or in the colony, a portion of
the cost of passage. No payment is required for wives,
or for children under 14 years of age. The payments
are at present fixed as follows:
Married agricultural labourers, shepherds, herdsmen, and
miners, not exceeding 45 years of age, �1 each in this
country, and �l2 in the colony.
Over 45 years and under 50 years of age, �5 in this
country, and �8 in the colony.
Above 50 years of age, �ll in this country, and �2 in
the colony.
Unmarried males of the foregoing classes, not exceeding
40 years of age, �1 in this country, and �l2 in the
colony.
Unmarried females, farm and domestic servants, not ex-
ceeding 35 years of age, �1 in this country, and �l2
in the colony.
Country blacksmiths, bricklayers, carpenters, masons,
sawyers, wheelwrights, and gardeners, under 45 years
of age, �5 each in this country, and �lO in the colony.
Above 45 years and not exceeding 50 years of age, �8
each in this country, and �7 in the colony.
Above 50 years of age, �l5 each in this country.


Every male, and unmarried female, emigrant to New
South Wales andYan Diemen?sLand, of or above fourteen
years of age, is required to sign an engagement to serve
two years to an employer in the colony, who will pay the
Colonial Government the balance due, and deduct it, by
quarterly payments, out of the emigrant?s wages. The
emigrants are at perfect liberty to engage with whom
they please, and at the end of the first year to cancel the
engagement, upon giving three months? notice and re-
paying the balance of passage-money remaining due.
When candidates have been accepted by the Commis-
sioners for either colony, they receive a printed ?Approval
Circular,? pointing out how the required contribution is
to be paid. As soon after the deposit-money is paid as
the arrangements of the Commissioners will admit, an
?Embarkation Order? is issued, naming a particular ship,
and the time and place of embarkation.
The Commissioners engage none but first-class ships,
which are despatched from Southampton, Plymouth, and
Birkenhead, at which ports there are Government depots,
fitted expressly for the reception of the emigrants, who
are assembled there previous to embarkation, and are
lodged and fed free of charge, from the day named in the
embarkation order, and prepared in every respect for the
commencement of the voyage, berthed, messed, etc.; so
that upon going on board there is not the slightest con-
fusion to interfere with the regulations. The emigrants
must find their way, with their luggage, to the depot
named at their own cost.
Besides passages, the Commissioners provide the fol-
lowing provisions weeldy to each emigrant over fourteen
years of age :
Biscuit, 31 lbs.
Flour, 2 lbs. 10 cz.
Preserved meat, li lb.
Beef, 6 oz.
Pork, 1 lb. 2 oz.
Oatmeal, 1 lb. 5 oz.
Baisins, 8 oz.
Suet, 6 oz.
Peas, I of a pint.
Bice, 8 oz.
Preserved potatoes, 8 oz.
Tea, 1 oz.
Coffee, oz.
Sugar, 12 oz.


Treacle, 8 oz.
Butter, 4 oz.
Mixed pickles, 1 gill.
Mustard, oz.
Salt, 2 oz.
Pepper, -3- oz.
Water, 21 quarts.
Children between 10 and 14 years of age receive two-
tliirds, and children between 2 and 10 years of age one-
half of the above rations.
Children between four months and two years old are
allowed 3 pints of water and a quarter of a pint of milk
daily; also 3 oz. of preserved soup and one egg every
alternate day; and 12 oz. of biscuit, 4 oz. of oatmeal,
8 oz. of flour, 4 oz. of rice, and 10 oz. of sugar weekly.
To infants under four months the surgeon can issue such
nutriment as lie may think proper, and also a pint of
porter daily to women who are nursing.
Where practicable, these ships are fitted with an oven
and small bakery, and bread is baked twice a week. Por
each baking two days? allowance of flour?that is, 12 oz.
per adult?is to be withheld from each emigrant, and made
into bread for them by a baker specially appointed for
that purpose, and on the other days he is charged with
baking anything that the emigrants may have prepared
for themselves.
The ships are also amply sup]died with medical com-
forts, such as arrow-root, sago, preserved meats, stout,
wine, preserved milk, etc., to be issued at the discretion
of the surgeon.
The Commissioners also provide bedding, mess utensils,
mattresses, bolsters, blankets and counterpanes, canvas
clothes? bags, knives and forks, spoons, and some other
necessary articles, which, if the emigrants conduct them-
selves properly during the voyage, are given to them on
arrival at the colony.
The emigrants must find their own clothing, which
will be inspected at the depot by an officer of the Com-
missioners ; and they will not be allowed to embai?k unless
they have a sufficient stock for the voyage, not less for
.each person than?


FOR MALES,
Six shirts.
Six pairs of stockings.
Two warm flannel or
Guernsey shirts.
Two pairs of new shoes.
Two complete suits of
strong exterior clothing.
But for each child, nine shirts
FOR FEMALES,
Six shifts.
Two warm and strong
flannel petticoats.
Six pairs of stockings.
Two pairs of strong shoes.
Two strong gowns, one of
which must be warm.
or shifts, four warm flannel
waistcoats, and one warm cloak or outside coat, six pairs of
stockings, two pairs of strong shoes, and two complete
suits of exterior clothing, are required. There must also-
he at least three sheets for each berth, and four towels and
2 lbs. of marine soap for each person. This can be obtained
near each depot. The necessary brushes and combs and
clothes brushes, for cleanliness, must be provided by the
emigrants. Emigrants must not have less than the above
outfit; but the larger the stock of clothing, the better
for health and comfort during the voyage, which usually
lasts about four months ; and as the emigrants have always
to pass through very hot and very cold weather, they
should be prepared for both. Two or three coloured
serge shirts for men, and an extra supply of flannel for
women and children, are strongly recommended.
The emigrants should take out with them the neces-
sary tools of their trades, that are not bulky ; but the
whole quantity of baggage for each adult must not mea-
sure more than twenty cubic or solid feet, or exceed half a
ton in weight. It must be closely packed in one or more
strong boxes or cases; but no box must exceed in size
fifteen cubic feet.* Each box should be marked with
the owner?s name and the name of the ship. No box is
allowed to be taken in the berth. A canvas bag is pro-
vided for each emigrant, in which to put a month?s
supply of clean things, and another bag for the dirty
clothes, changes being got out of the boxes occasionally.
Large packages and extra baggage, if it can be taken at
all, must be paid for. Mattresses and feather beds cannot
be taken.
* The cubic feet of several measurements are given at page 53.


The Commissioners appoint a surgeon-superintendent to-
eacb of their ships, who is charged with the medical care
of the emigrants ; on him also devolves the maintenance
of discipline on board, and consequently the enforcement
of regulations for securing cleanliness, regularity, and
good conduct. It is also his duty to watch over the con-
duct of the matron, and also of the master and officers of
the ship in all that relates to the emigrants; to see that
the proper allowance of food and water is duly issued to-
them, and especially to prevent communication with the
single females.
The single women and all the girls are placed under
the care of a matron, whose duty it is to inspect the
children daily, to see that they are neat and clean, also
to see that their stock of clothing is washed at proper
times, and kept in good order. A girls? school is also
established, at iwhich all girls who are not too young to-
derive benefit from it, are expected to attend daily, and
any adult females who may be willing to do so. The
matron, in addition to elementary books, is supplied with,
a quantity of materials for work, with a view to keep the
single women employed. The emigrants are always
visited while in depot, previous to embarkation, by the
? Lady Assistant,? of the ? British Ladies? Female
Emigrant Society,? of Bed Lion Square, London, of
which there are branch committees at the several ports.
These ladies, in addition to the materials supplied at the
cost of the Commissioners, also furnish needlework of
various kinds, Dorcas bags, knitting cotton, patchwork
quilts, store bags, pincushions, sun bonnets, books, slates,
and other school materials, as well as toys. There are
also many arrangements made by the ? Lady Assistant,?
while the females are in the several depots, which tend
materially to their comfort during the voyage. The
matron is charged also with the duty of seeing that the
single women are in their proper sleeping apartments as-
soon as it is dark.
In fitting up the Government ships, the preservation
of good order, as well as the comfort of the people, is
held in view. The married couples and their young
children occupy separate berths in the middle of the


vessel, families being kept together; the single women
above fourteen years of age are placed in a separate com-
partment at the after part of the ship, where they sleep
and mess by themselves ; while the single men occupy
another compartment at the other end of the ship,
beyond the space occupied by the married couples.
The emigrants are formed, while in the depot, into
messes of six, eight, or ten persons ?children between
two and ten years counting as half, and children between
ten and fourteen as two-tliirds of an adult. Every mess
appoints a head man, who is termed ? captain of the
mess,? whose duty is to take charge of the utensils
served out for each mess, consisting of a two-gallon kit,
one large tin dish, two tin baking dishes, one bread
tub, two tin hook-pots, one water cask, one mustard pot,
one pepper and salt cellar, one butter dish, three sets of
tin tallies, one potato net, one pudding bag, and two
mess toAvels, and to receive the provisions from the
officer who serves them out. The captain of the mess
is also responsible for the order and regularity of his
mess, and it is his duty to report to the surgeon any
misconduct or neglect requiring correction.
A certain number of constables are also appointed for
the enforcement of the regulations, and of cleanliness and
good order; and also to attend daily at the serving out
of the provisions, to see that each mess receives its proper
allowance, and that justice is done. Eor these services, if
performed to the satisfaction of the surgeon, the con-
stables receive a gratuity on arrival in the colony.
With a view to the strict observance of order and
regularity on board the emigrant ships despatched under
the superintendence of the Emigration Commissioners,
the following regulations are enforced by authority;?
1. The emigrants are to be divided into messes.
2. Every mess is to have a head man, to be responsible
for the order and regularity of it, and whose duty it will
be to report to the surgeon any misconduct or neglect
requiring correction.
3. The surgeon-superintendent will appoint from
amongst the emigrants a sufficient number of constables
O O


for the enforcement of the regulations, and of cleanliness
and good order.
4. The constables will attend daily at the serving out
of the provisions, to see that each mess receives its proper
allowance, and that justice is done; and a scale of the
victualling will be fixed in some conspicuous part of the
ship for the information of all concerned.
5. The surgeon-superintendent is to appoint one
man, if he think proper, to be his assistant in the hos-
pital, or generally in attendance on the sick.
6. One or more women, as may be necessary, will be
taken in rotation to attend any sick in the female hos-
pital.
7. If there be no religious instructor on board, or school-
master appointed by the Commissioners, the surgeon-
superintendent will select a person to act as teacher to
the children.
8. One man may be taken in rotation, if necessaiy, to
act as the cook?s assistant.
9. The teacher and the constables are to be exempt
from the duty of cleansing decks amongst the messes, or
from taking their turn in the party of general cleaners
and sweepers. The man acting as cook?s assistant for
the day, if there be one, and the hospital man, will also
be exempt from those duties.
10. At the end of the voyage, the following gratuities
will be paid :
�
To the teacher, a gratuity not exceeding . 5
Constables, ditto, each . . 2
The hospital assistant and cook?s assistant,
each .3
In case these persons shall have performed their duties to
the satisfaction of the surgeon and the colonial authorities.
11. On every Thursday there shall be a muster of the
emigrants, in clean linen and apparel.
12, Weather permitting, all the children are to be
sent on deck immediately after breakfast, to be inspected
as to their cleanliness by the surgeon, religious instructor,
or the teacher.


13. School-hours are to be fixed by the -religious in-
structor or schoolmaster, subject to the approval of the
surgeon; or, if there be no religious instructor, by the
surgeon himself.
Divine service is to be performed at least once on
every Sunday. ..
15. The married men, in rotation, will keep a watcii
in their part of the ?tween-decks during the night. There
should be two or three in each watch, and the night
should be divided into three watches ; the first, from
eight, p.ra., to midnight; the second, from midnight to
four o?clock; and the morning watch, from four to seven,
a.m. The business of the watch will be to prevent irre-
gularities ; to assist any persons taken ill; to attend to
the hatchways, deck ventilators, and scuttles, seeing that
they are open or shut, according to the weather, and the
surgeon?s directions ; and to make any representation
that may be necessary to the surgeon. _
16. The heavy luggage is to be put in the hold. The
emigrants will have access to their boxes at intervals ot
three or four weeks, as the surgeon-superintendent may
direct.
17. All questions that may arise on the preceding
regulations are to be decided conclusively by the authority
of the surgeon, who is entirely responsible for the care
and good management of the emigrants, and wdiose autho-
rity is to be respected in all cases accordingly.
18. The surgeon is enjoined to refuse the extra com-
forts when in course of issue, and to deny any other in-
dulgence he may think proper, to any persons who
wilfully neglect or obstruct the established rules; and in
case of gross misconduct or insubordination, he will
report it to the Governor on arrival, with the name of the
offender, in order that any penalties which may have
been incurred under the Passengers Act may be duly
enforced.
The preceding regulations, in connection with those
prescribed by the order in council (at page 54) will,
the Commissioners believe, if properly attended to, be
found sufficient to ensure good order, cleanliness, and


comfort during the voyage; but if they be neglected,
the health, comfort, and future prospects of the emigrants
must be injured. Unless cleanliness and ventilation be
attended to, the emigrants cannot be preserved in health ;
unless regularity and harmony be maintained, their com-
fort cannot be ensured. And the Commissioners desire
to impress upon the emigrants that on the report which
the surgeon may make of the state of their health, and of
their conduct on board, must depend very much their
success in finding employment in the colony.
On the arrival of a Government emigrant ship in the
colony the single women are at once removed to a depot,
preparatory to being hired for service; the families and
single men remain on board the vessel, to be hired under
the following regulations adopted in New South Wales,
those for the other colonies being very similar.
The emigrants are open for engagement on board,
between the hours of ten, a.m., and four, p.m., on and
after a day of which due notice is given, until the conclu-
sion of the fourteen lay days allowed by the charter-
party. Those who remain disengaged at the termination
of the lay days are forwarded to one of the outports, or
required to leave the ship on their own account.
Persons coming on board to engage servants are ex-
pected to address themselves to the surgeon-superin-
tendent, It is his duty to point out such emigrants as
are of the class sought for, and generally to assist em-
ployers in making the necessary agreements. It is also
his duty to see that no unreasonable engagement is made
by an employer, and no reasonable offer refused by an
emigrant.
If an unreasonable offer be made by an employer, the
surgeon-superintendent should, in the first place, address
him separately; and afterwards, if necessary, warn and
advise the emigrant.
All agreements are written out and registered; on the
first days, by an officer of the Emigration department,
sent on board for that purpose; and afterwards, under
the direction of the surgeon.
All emigrants are expected to take service; but those


who, for sufficient cause, decline to do so, are allowed to
leave the ship as soon as the hiring commences. They
must, in every case, take their boxes with them, and re-
port their name and place of destination to the surgeon
or officer who superintends the hiring. No emigrant,
after leaving the ship, is allowed to return, without
express permission from the master.
PAET 111.
We shall now address those persons who, although
of the ? working classes,? do not come within the pre-
ceding regulations, and cannot therefore obtain a free
passage. Such persons must trust to their own resources*
and the assistance of friends to raise sufficient funds
to pay the cost of passage.
It may not be out of place here to mention that the
Poor-Law Commissioners are enabled, under two Acts
of Parliament, viz. 4 and 5 Will. IV., cap. 76, and
11 and 12 Viet. cap. 110, to sanction the application
of parochial funds towards the emigration of poor
persons; guardians of parishes also have considerable
power to afford assistance for this purpose, under the
Acts 12 and 13 Viet., cap. 103, sec. 20, and 13 and 14
Viet., cap. 101, sec. 4.
Many poor persons, who cannot raise sufficient funds
themselves, knowing this, might request the clergyman
or other influential persons' in the neighbourhood to
bring their case under the notice of the guardians of their
parish, and thus obtain their object.
The Family Colonization Loan Society, founded by
Mrs. Chisholm, is another means by which many persons
can obtain assistance. This Society assists intending
emigrants with a portion of their passage-money upon
loan, the remaining portion being supplied by the parties
themselves, or their friends. On arrival in the colony,
or as soon after as they can, the emigrants are re-
quired to pay over, to the agent of the Society, the


money advanced. Intending emigrants may pay their
portions of the passage-money by instalments, being
received as deposits ace by the savings? banks, at the
offices of this Society, in Bucklersbury, London.
It is not very generally known in this country that
parties resident in the several Australian colonies can,
under regulations adopted in each colony, obtain, at a
small cost, a passage out for any of their relatives or friends
who they may wish to join them from this country. Under
what are called the Remittance Regulations, any person
in the colony can deposit certain sums at the Colonial
Treasury, together with] the name of the party they
wish sent out. They are then provided with a printed
document of instructions, to be sent to this country, to-
the persons named, and the Government also transmits
the names of parties nominated to the Emigration Com-
missioners in London, who then make arrangements for
the free passage of such parties iu their ships.
Having provided the means, the next consideration is
the ? choice of a ship,?? and, above all, the character of the
captain and officers, for they have it in their power to
make the voyage most comfortable, if they are kind and
humane, as the most of them really are; but should they
not be so, woe to the passenger that has to sail in com-
pany with them.
It is extremely difficult to judge on this point, for the
appearance of things when the ship is in dock, seeking
passengers, is often very different to what will be expe-
rienced when the ship is out at sea, We have known
the very kindest of captains, whose appearance on shore
was really against them, and others who appeared and
promised well, quite the reverse when at sea. As so
much depends on a good captain and officers, no person
with a family should make any agreement for a ship,
until he has investigated this point as far as he can.
In the choice of a ship, as a general rule, the larger she
is the better. A large ship will, of course, have a greater
number of passengers than a small one, but still they
arc comparatively less crowded. Besides this they are


higher between decks, and generally much better venti-
lated and manned.
It is of great importance that the emigrant should see
that there is sufficient cooking accommodation ; perhaps,
of all the inconveniences of a' steerage and intermediate
passage, those which attend the cooking of his meals
are the most annoying. Look carefully, therefore, at the
accommodation for this purpose; and, all things else
being equal, select the ship which presents those best
adapted to this want.
It is essential also to see whether there are sufficient
and proper water-closets. This is of great importance,
as the emigrant will find before he reaches the land of
his adoption.
The next consideration is the dietary ?this, of course,
varies with different owners; but care should be taken
to have a copy of the scale of provisions appended to
the contract ticket, which the broker is compelled to
furnish.
Finally, no passage arrangement should be made with
any hut a first-rate house. It is better to pay a few
shillings more (or pounds, for that matter), to be sure of
good accommodations and wholesome provisions, than to
save the shillings or the pounds, at the expense of one?s
comfort and health. To pass ninety or one hundred
days in the ill-ventilated ?tween-decks of a small,
crowded ship, with scanty and unwholesome food, may
do great injury to the health, and instead ot landing in
Australia in vigorous bodily condition, the emigrant
may find himself weakened and unnerved, unable to go
to work with the desired energy, and perhaps become a
prey to diseases which are always more or less conse-
quent upon a change of climate, of habits, and of diet.
Persons of any class who may be proceeding to the
colonies, either from London, Liverpool, or other ports of
the United Kingdom, can obtain information as to the
respectability of the various ship agents, by applyiug to
the Government Emigration officer, at the port they
may be at. The following are the names of the several
officers, and the ports to which they are appointed.


London?Captain Lean, E.N.,70, Lower Thames-street.
Liverpool?Captain Schomberg, E.N., Stanley-build-
ings, Bath-street.
Southampton?E. A. Smith, Esq., R.N., Dockyard.
Plymouth?Lieutenant Carew, E.N.
Belfast?Commander Eowlatt, E.N.
Cork?Commander De Courcy, E.N.
Dublin?Captain Kerr, E.N.
Gralway?Lieutenant Saunders, E.N,
Glasgow?Captain Patey, E.N.
Limerick?Commander Ellis, E.N.
Londonderry?Commander Keele, E.N.
Sligo ?Captain Willis, E.N,
Tralee?Lieutenant Hay, E.N.
Waterford?Commander Burton, E.N.
These officers act under the immediate directions of the
Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners ; they pro-
cure and give, gratuitously, information as to the sailing of
ships, and means of accommodation for emigrants ; and
whenever applied to for that purpose, they see that all
agreements between shipowners, agents, or masters, and
intending emigrants are duly performed. They also see
that the provisions of the Passengers? Act are strictly
complied with, viz., that passenger vessels are sea-worthy,
that they have on board a sufficient supply of provisions*
water, medicines, etc., and that they sail with proper
punctuality.
They attend personally at their offices on every week-
day, and afford, gratuitously, all the assistance in their
power to protect intending emigrants against fraud and
imposition, and to obtain redress where oppression or
injury has been practised on them.
Passages to Australia in private ships are of three
kinds, cabin, intermediate, and steerage.
Cabin passage is of a superior kind, and usually
ranges from �4O to �7O each person.
Intermediate or second-cabin passage varies according to
the views of the different owners, some being much more
liberal than others. The accommodation consists of cabins
built between decks, varying according to the size of the


ship, the height, and the number of persons to occupy each.
These cabins are usually about eight feet by six feet, and
fitted up to accommodate four persons. The cost of this
description of passage is usually about �25 each person;
in some cases, where a better supply of provisions is
given, it is �3O each. Sometimes cooking and mess
utensils are provided by the owner, which makes the
difference between another apparently cheaper. The
provisions are generally fixed according to a printed scale, a
copy of which should be furnished to each passenger. The
provisions are usually similar to those of the Government
dietary, with a larger proportion of some articles, and a
more 'frequent supply of preserved meats.
Steerage is the cheapest class of passage that can be
obtained; this is generally in the fore-part of the ship,
sometimes fitted with enclosed berths, but most fre-
quently consists of open sleeping-places, arranged along
the sides of the vessel, one over the other ?each intended
for two persons. The cost of this passage vanes from
�lB to �2l. Children between one and fourteen years
of age in each class are charged half-price. No charge
being made for infants.
The provisions for this class of passage differ but little
from the scale of the intermediate passenger, except that
there is generally but one meal of preserved meat in the
week, and some of the other provisions are rather less in
quantity. The allowance ,of water is the same to all
classes, viz., three quarts daily to each person above
fourteen years of age.
Should the emigrant have sufficient funds to allow
him to purchase a few extra stores, they may consist of
a ham, some well-dried bacon, cheese, pickles, lemon-
juice, soda powders, and a few jars of preserved fruits,
to make into puddings, with the flour allowed by the
ship. An excellent change from the ship biscuit is, to
have some new-made loaves cut into slices, not too thin,
and bake them in an oven, making them into a kind of
rusk. These keep a length of time, and make an agreeable
change.
The class of persons for whom these observations are


principally intended are not likely to have any con-
siderable amount to spend in their outfit, they are
therefore advised to collect every old article of clothing
they may have by them, for use on the voyage. Let all
such things be well washed, even woollen ones, before
going on board ; for remember that cleanliness is next to
godliness. Any old boots and shoes also will do for ship-
board, as the salt water destroys the leather, whether old
or new, light or strong.
As, during the voyage to Australia, the emigrant has
to pass through very cold as well as very hot weather,
it is requisite to be prepared with clothing to meet these
changes of climate. The quantity required for the
voyage must in a great measure be regulated by the
depth of the emigrant?s pocket, bearing in mind that a
change for about fourteen weeks should be provided;
therefore, when every article of apparel in use, good and
old, is put together, the emigrant should make it up, if
possible, by new things equal to the following outfit.
For the husband. ?Two jackets, waistcoats, and trousers
of cloth or fustian, three pairs of canvas trousers, one
blanket, or water-proof over-coat, one felt hat, two
Scotch caps, one Brazil straw hat, twelve blue cotton
shirts, two blue serge shirts, four pairs of worsted
stockings, six pairs of cotton hose, six handkerchiefs,
two pairs of braces, eight towels, two pairs of boots, and
one pair of shoes; if new, these should be strong, but not
heavy.
For the wife. ?A warm cloak, with a cape, one shawl,
two bonnets, one straw and one cotton, with sun lap-
pets ; one stuff dress, two print dresses, twelve chemises,
two flannel petticoats, one stuff* petticoat, and two of
twilled cotton, one pair of stays, four pairs of worsted
stockings, and six pairs of cotton, six pocket handkerchiefs,
four kerchiefs for the neck, four caps, six nightcaps,
six nightgowns, one pair of boots, two pairs of shoes,
and eight towels.
In the purchase of any of these things the emi-
grant should avoid those shops which advertise ? cheap
outfit for emigrants,? such articles being usually flimsy
v 2


slops, the shirts, jackets, and trousers being just thrown
or stuck together, instead of being sewn, and literally fall
off the body after any hard work. Far better to buy a
small quantity of good, strong, check shirts; and, better
still, if possible, to buy the stuff and get them made up
on the voyage. Good cord or moleskin trousers, at 10s.
or 12s. a pair, will outlast three times as many cheap
pairs ; and two pairs of well-made light boots or shoes
will also be worth the extra few shillings they cost. The
same applies to blue serge shirts ; these should be made
of good stuff, and of large size, as they shrink very much
after washing. In short, whatever article is bought
should be selected not only for use on the voyage, but
also adapted for hard country life in the colony.
A married couple will also require a flock mattress and
bolster, a pair of blankets, a counterpane, six pairs of
sheets,?two canvas bags (one for clean and one for dirty
clothes), four pounds of marine soap, a looking-glass,
comb and brush, two pots of blacking and shoe brush, a
tin teapot, tin hook-pot (to hold a quart or three pints),
a tin coffee-pot, two tin baking dishes, a wooden keg (to
hold about three gallons of water), and a tin washing basin.
Each person must also be provided with a knife and fork,
a deep tin plate, a pint tin drinking mug, a table-spoon
and a tea-spoon. If the emigrant has a family, a tin
slop-pail, with a closely fitted cover, a cheap mop, with a
short handle, and a broom, will be found useful. Among
other things, every man, and boy also, should have a good
strong knife fastened round his neck by a stout cord. A
hammer and a few nails, a dozen hooks, and some stout
cord to lash packages firmly, should not be forgot.
Female emigrants should provide a bag with thread,
tape, buttons, pins, needles, and bits of cloth and linen,
to repair their clothes with.
Intermediate and steerage passengers are each allowed
about twenty cubic feet of luggage free of charge, one
small box, in addition to their clothes? bags, being usually
allowed in their cabin; this box should not be more
than one foot two inches long, one foot six inches broad,
and fourteen inches deep. This should contain a portion


of the extra provisions, books, etc. ; and the bag, a
month?s supply of linen, etc. The remainder of the
things required on the voyage should be packed in boxes
not larger than one person can carry (to save porterage
in the colony), and marked with the owner?s name and
the name of the ship, and also with the words ? Wanted
on the voyage.? Select the clothing which is not to be
used on board the ship, dry it thoroughly, pack it into
trunks or boxes, scattering among it small bits of cam-
phor ; taking care to mark such packages, in addition to
the owner?s name, with the words ? Not wanted on the
voyage,? as the latter are stowed away in the hold of the
ship, while such as are wanted are placed so that access
can be had to them from time to time.
The following dimensions will show those not accus-
tomed to cubic measurement the size their boxes should
be, to keep within the allotted space.
A package measuring two feet long, one foot six inches
wide, and one foot deep, will be equal to three cubic
feet.
A package two feet long, two feet wide, and one foot
deep, will equal four cubic feet.
A package two feet three inches long, one foot eight
inches wide, and one foot four inches deep, will equal fve
cubic feet.
A package two feet long, two feet wide, and one foot
six inches deep, will equal six cubic feet.
A package being a perfect square of two feet each way,
equals eight cubic feet.
A package two feet six inches long, two feet wide, and
two feet deep, is equal to ten cubic feet.
A package three feet long, two feet six inches wide, and
two feet deep; or four feet long, two feet six inches wide,
and one foot six inches deep, are each equal to fifteen
cubic feet.
A package four feet long, two feet six inches wide, and
two feet deep ; or five feet long, two feet wide, and two
feet deep, are each equal to twenty cubic feet.
A package four feet long, three feet nine inches wide,
and two feet eight inches deep, is equal to forty cubic feet,
or one ton , of measurement.


Under the provisions of the Passengers? Act, the follow-
ing regulations have been issued, by an order m council,

the passengers, except on duty.
23. No passenger to go to the ship?s cookhouse without
special permission from the master, nor to remain in the

We will now address a few observations respecting the
voyage and arrival in the colony.
Some people are frightened by the thoughts of the
length of the voyage, and at first suffer a good deal from
fear ; should the wind blow hard, and the sea run high,
they are sure to overrate the danger, especially at night,
when the crew are busy Reducing sail; the trampling of


the sailors over their heads, the loud voice of the captain,
and mates giving orders, and the rolling of the ship from
side to side, very naturally create alarm. This is also
increased by hearing other passengers express their fears.
Fear begets fear, and the between decks very often
present a scene of great confusion, without any just
cause for it. Passengers should always bear in mind
this simple rule, ?never be alarmed until the captain is.?
For the first week there is usually sea-sickness to con-
tend with ; this makes people feel very wretched for the
time, but it is soon over. Time and patience are the best
cure for it, and as a rule, it is best borne by lying in
your berth. This once over, it is astonishing how quickly
time flies. First, the novelty of the life?for there are
few who do not take pleasure in looking on the wide
ocean ; then the approach of a strange ship, the appear-
ance of distant land, the fish which rise to the surface
from the deep, the birds from far-off regions, all tend to
pass the time away.
Ample time and resource will he found during the
voyage to attain some knowledge of the country to
which the emigrant is sailing, and to store up informa-
tion to be applied in his future career ; never forgetting
to commune with himself?to seek by prayer that
calmness and peacefulness of spirit which enables the
mind to see farther and more clearly, and to reason more
wisely, while his heart beats with gratitude to that
? Gfod who bringeth thee unto a good land; a land of
wheat and barley, of vines and fig-trees, and pomegranates;
a land of oil, olives, and honey, where thou shalt eat
bread without scarceness ; thou shalt not lack anything
in it.? We strongly recommend every emigrant to
obtain a copy of a little manual issued under the
authority of the Emigration Commissioners, entitled
?Prayers for the Use of Emigrants at Sea??published
by Groorabridge and Sons, Paternoster-row, London;
price sixpence.
Men and boys should learn how to knot and splice, and
to secure a rope in a variety of ways, and, if allowed, go
aloft and learn to assist in reefing the sails; and all


should exercise their arms every day, by hanging on to
ropes or a spar slung across the deck. There are many
other things that may be done on the voyage that would
tend to pass away the time, but one important point to
be observed, for the happiness and comfort of all, is
to bear with the faults and tempers of your fellow-
passengers.
Newly arrived emigrants in Australia are liable to be
attacked with dysentery, but it is easy to guard against
it by taking the following precautions : ?? spare diet,
very gentle exercise, using no stimulants, and occasionally
taking some laxative medicine.?
Immediately on the arrival of a ship with emigrants, a
number of citizens and settlers, or their agents, go on
board to hire the people. Sometimes nearly all the
�migrants have been engaged within forty-eight hours
after arrival. The persons who generally remain longer
disengaged are agricultural labourers whose families con-
sist partly of very young children, who, instead of being
of any use to the settler, only occupy the time of the
mother, and consume rations. Such families should never
refuse the first fair offer. The farm labourer is supplied
by his employer with lodging and rations, which con-
sist of 10 lbs. flour, 10 lbs. meat, i lb. tea, lb. sugar,
and 2 oz. tobacco, for each grown person. From the
nature of the climate but little clothing is required,
hence the wages are almost clear gain. He may thus
soon find himself in a condition either to purchase some
stock, or rent a small patch of land from his master.
From this state he rises gradually to the rank of a
small farmer; and, by superior industry and sagacity,
may reckon upon ultimately taking his place among the
lords of the soil.
The emigrants who are most readily engaged are
single females, to act as house servants. There is
often a scramble for them. The great scarcity of female
servants in the Australian colonies is owing chiefly to
the readiness with which they get married. A large
proportion of the girls that emigrate to Australia are
comfortably married within a twelvemonth of their ar-


rival. To these we say, be careful on arrival, for yon will
find many enemies to assail you. You will find plenty
of admirers and suitors, but do nothing rashly; find a re-
spectable mate, and ascertain his character. Many, under
a garb of temporary sobriety, assume a style of life they
never have or intend to have. You are a class of emi-
grants always required; be good, and you will be happy,
and never regret leaving your native country ; but if you
fall, you go to ruin in a moment, unpitied and friendless.
Single men have only to land in any of the Australian
colonies to find employment at once as shepherds, la-
bourers, or servants. New hands must not expect the
wages of older colonists; but stay at one place for two
years, and it will be your own fault if the foundation
of a future competence is not secured?and remember
of all things to avoid the grog bottle as you would a black
snake.
For mechanics' there is an immediate demand; and
the newly arrived emigrant will do well to accept the
first reasonable offer of employment, if only for a short
term, so as to enable him to obtain information
respecting the localities where his particular branch of
labour may be most required, as well as to obtain a tem-
porary home for his family. Let not the intending emigrant,
however, harbour undue notions of the success and enjoy-
ment which await him on arrival in Australia. Much dis-
appointment will be the necessary consequence of extra-
vagant ideas thus unwarrantably entertained. The high
rates of wages of late circulated as being current in
Australia cannot last; but as soon as a reduction of
wages takes place a great stimulus will be given to all
kinds of production. Even with a decrease upon the
{>resent rates of wages in the colonies, the position of the
abourer and mechanic would still be vastly in advance
of that of the classes to which they belong here. For
surely the labourer or artisan who is able to live com-
fortably, and save even �1 per week, occupies a position
vastly superior to that he holds in this country. Bear in
mind you go to a land where you can never want flour,
meat, tea, sugar, and excellent wages ; where, by patience,


perseverance, and good conduct, you may gather sufficient,
in a few years, to enter into business for yourselves; and
for those who go out in the confident expectation of
realizing a speedy and splendid fortune, they will find
themselves grievously disappointed.
On the other hand, if you go out with the fixed pur-
pose, 'by dint of patience and perseverance, of working
out for yourself and family the enjoyment of independ-
ence, and the substantial comforts of life, you may
rest assured that these are to be attained in Australia,
at a far less expense than at home, and under cir-
cumstances which in this country would altogether
preclude the hope of ever reaching so desirable an
attainment. In the outset of your career, however,
you must bear in mind that to secure success the most
rigid economy is absolutely necessary, not only in the
matter of living and clothing, but in all the little matters
of daily operations. If you are proof against the dis-
appointments and chagrin which necessarily attach to the
discomforts of a first settlement ?if your courage, cheer-
fulness, and perseverance be strong enough to stem
effectively the current of despondent feelings, which sets
in with formidable force among the details and drawbacks
of early labours, you may count with safety on
in the end, a footing of respectability, and an amount ot
substantial enjoyment which never could be attained in
this country.
