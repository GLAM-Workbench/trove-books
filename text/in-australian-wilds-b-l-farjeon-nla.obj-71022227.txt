IN AUSTRALIAN WILDS.
We were in the bush, Lilly Trot
and I. Lilly Trot was my squire.
Business of a particular nature had
rendered it necessary that I should
travel some distance into the in-
terior of Victoria, that greatest of
all the Australasian colonies. Tra-
velling by oneself was not a very
safe undertaking in those days.
Travelling in couples was not much
safer; for the bushrangers were
about, and when they meant mis-
chief, a man or two more or less in
a party they intended to attack was
not of much consequence to them.
I knew that well enough. The
reason that I chose Lilly Trot for
a companion was not because I
thought he would be an additional
protection from, danger, but because
I did not like the idea of travelling
by myself through the dreary and
monotonous solitudes of Victorian
forests.
There is no disguising the fact
that Lilly Trot was a convict. He
did not disguise it himself, nor did
he seem to have any particular de-
licacy with respect to its being
known. He had his ticket-of-leave,
and he was not backward in the
showing of it. Perhaps his state of
feeling arose from the circumstance
that he was not alone in his mis-
fortune, There were, and are, many
hundreds of men in the Australian
colonies whose journey to the An-
tipodes did not cost them as much
as a ride to Chelsea would cost you
or me, and who walk about with as
independent an air as you or I
would assume (were we not given
to modesty in our demeanour) in
walking along the Strand.
We were on horseback, and we
VOL. VII.
carried blankets before us on our
saddles, lest we should get bushed.
We were prepared for rough times.
I carried my revolver, and Lilly
Trot had a villanous-looking black
life-preserver up his sleeve, ready
at a moment?s notice for any emer-
gency. He professed a contempt
for guns and pistbls, and held his
black gutta-percha with its
heavy leaden knob, to be more than
a match for the best revolver ever
made. He had the reputation of
nursing carefully in his body two or
three bullets, which did not seem
to cause him the slightest inconve-
nience, which may account for his
contempt for anything that carried
a bullet.
We were trotting along a melan-
choly-looking track, thinly lined on
- each side with miserable half-
starved trees. The lynx eyes of
Lilly Trot were busy in all direc-
tions, and every now and again he
pointed to some gully or hill-side-
ling as a place where a digger might
find gold, if he searched for it. It
may be supposed that these last
five words are unnecessary, on the
assumption that gold could not be
found unless it were searched for.
But it was a very common thing, in
the early days of the gold-diggings,
for gold to appear on the surface
of the soil; perhaps on a track
where golden stones had been worn
smooth by many feet and many
wheels, until the dirt upon them had
been worn off, and their golden
treasures revealed to the next
passers-by; or perhaps on a hill-
crown after a storm, when the loose
earth had been washed away by a
heavy rain, leaving the bright little


nuggets glistening in the sunshine
that smiled when the rain-pour
ceased.
Said Lilly Trot, ?Some day there
will be a rush there? ?meaning a
rush of gold-diggers to the spot in-
dicated, and perhaps the discovery
of a new gold-field?or, ? Some day
I shall come here with my pick, and
look for gold??or, ? If gold is ever
found hereabouts, I should like that
piece of ground where the hill is
like a saddle?that?s where the
heaviest bits will be found.? Some
gold-diggers have a kind of second
sight with respect to where the
heaviest gold will be found.
The remarks of Lilly Trot served
in a small measure to beguile the
tedium of the journey. It was a
sad-hearted track over which we
were trotting, and it grew more des-
pondent-looking and more gloomy
every hundred yards. The occa-
sional barking of a dog, the ap-
pearance of a stray hut, and the
coming suddenly upon a party of
sunburnt men sawing timber, had
been the only breaks during the
whole of the day to the monoto-
nous solitude of the dismal woods.
And now it was afternoon, and the
unceasing cawing of thousands of
ugly black crows jarred distressingly
upon my ears. For three wearisome
hours we rode along without meet-
ing the shadow of a human being.
For three dull hours we rode
through the almost trackless forest,
and for all the signs of human life
we saw, we might have been the
last representatives of the human
race existing on the earth. For
three long and almost interminable
hours we rode past the same trees,
over the same black stumps and
dead branches, and under the same
white staring sky. For three long
hours we saw, as far as the eye could
reach, the same grand arch of tim-
ber, in the solitude of which ima-
gination built many an airy man-
sion, and the same leaden-looking
hills and ranges that loomed upon
us when we started in the early-
morning. It was a dull melancholy
scene. We might have been riding
through the Forest of the Dead,
everything about us was so still and
quiet; we might have been riding
through the Forest of Despair,
everything about us was so sad and
gloomy; we might have been rid-
ing in the regions of Dreamland,
everything about us was so strange
and unreal.
I had fallen into a kind of listless
dejection, when suddenly I found
myself listening delightedly to a
gush of the sweetest melody that
ever flowed from mortal lips. It
was simply Lilly Trot whistling, and
whistling divinely?if such a term
may rightly be applied to what is
usually considered a vulgar accom-
plishment. As I looked at Lilly
Trot, and heard him breathe beau-
tiful melody from a pair of the
coarsest lips that ever disgraced a
human mouth, my amazement grew
very strong. He was whistling the
principal airs from La Sonnambula,
and I never heard them more artisti-
cally rendered. The softest-toned
flute could not have produced
sweeter music; and, as I listened,
the skill of the whistler raised about
me the village where Elvino and
Amina lived and loved, the mill,
the stream, and the thousand plea-
surable traditional associations
with which all such simple love-
stories are surrounded. The plea-
sant effect remained long after he
had ceased whistling; but when
the rusty cawing of the crows forced
itself again upon my attention, I
noticed that the sun was sinking
behind the distant ranges.
? We shall have to bush it, Trot,?
I said,.
? Yes, mate,? he said unconcern-
edly, but looking about him sharp-
ly, notwithstanding his apparent
unconcern, for a suitable spot to
camp in.


There is but little twilight in
Victoria, and the shadows were
deepening around us when ? Spell
0 !? sang out Lilly Trot suddenly,
and at the magic cry we rolled off
our horses, and began to gather
dry leaves and dead wood for a
fire to boil the tea. This was
soon accomplished ; the water
being fetched from a water-hole,
which my unexperienced eyes
would never have discovered; but
Lilly Trot pointed it out. While
the tea was boiling, we hobbled
our horses, and took the saddles
and the blankets from their backs.
Then we rolled to the fire a tree
that had been blown down, and
soon it was in a blaze. All this
was done quietly and expeditious-
ly, and in a few minutes we were
sitting by the fire, drinking tea
and eating sandwiches with an ap-
petite which only bushmen pos-
sess. Then we filled our short
cutty-pipes and lighted them, and
our happiness was complete. Not
a word passed between us during
the smoking of our first pipe, but
when we had refilled and relighted,
1 said to myself, Now is the time
for a story, and there is the man
who can tell it.? And then I said
aloud,
? Lilly, yours must have been a
queer sort of life.?
He smoked on in silence, and
merely replied by a smile. I saw
it in the flicker of light that blazed
up as I spoke. His manner was
encouraging, and I knew he would
speak presently. As he did.
? Why, yes,? he then said, ? it has
been a queer life mine. I know
you want to draw me out, matey,
and I don?t see much objection.
What sort of a story would you
like ? I can tell you lots of them ;
about all sorts of people from
pickpockets to murderers. I sup-
pose you don?t much care which.
Just hold on a bit, and I?ll give
you one.?
He paused, as if considering
what theme to choose; and, hav-
ing made up his mind, proceeded :
? It?s about a match-box, so we?ll
call it
? THE STORY OF A MATCH-BOX.
? In the first few months of gold-
digging ?when men scarcely knew
if they stood on their heels or their
heads, and when the whole country
was so mad that it ought to have
been put in a strait-jacket?there
were all sorts of strange things oc-
curring, and all sorts of bad things
too. Not a few men started for
the gold-diggings who were never
heard of, and never will be. They
were scarcely missed. Many of
them had no friends and no fa-
mily ; their very names were often
fictitious; and if anything suspi-
cious was whispered about in con-
nection with them, it soon died
away, and no efforts were made
to discover if they were dead or
alive. Everybody was too busy,
and nobody cared. Two mates
would go on a prospecting tour;
months would elapse, and one of
them would be working in one of
the gullies of Bendigo or Ballarat;
of the other, nothing was ever
heard. And nobody asked any
questions. What business was it
of anybody?s if a man ran away
from his wife, and shaved himself
or let his hair grow, so that neither
she nor his friends could know him
again? A good many men were
glad to run away and commence
a new life, and take a new name,
and perhaps a new wife. I had
a mate once who was married five
times; it didn?t matter to him.
When he left his wives, they got
married again themselves. On one
gold-diggings he lived in the next
tent to an old wife of his, who
had married a few weeks after he
left her; and, do you know, they
got quite friendly again. My


mate and his old wife?s husband
used to go out on the drink to-
gether regularly. A very nice kind
of family arrangement I thought it,
when he told me the story. We
used to laugh over it rarely. He
was a sinner; and I wasn?t a saint,
mind you. Not a bit of it, mate.
? You see, it was so easy for
a man to lose himself. Take a
clerk out of a city office, spruce-
ly dressed, and with a nicely-cut
moustache; send him on to the
gold-fields, and let him grow his
beard, and dress himself in mole-
skin trousers and Scotch-twill shirt;
let him work for a few weeks at the
bottom of a twenty-foot hole, or
stand at the windlass all the day
with his sleeves tucked up to his
shoulders, with a black cutty in
his mouth, and an old billycock-
hat on his head, and with the sun
blazing down upon him, and brown-
ing every bit of flesh that it could
get at; why, in six months his own
wife wouldn?t know him ! That
sort of thing might occur, and did
occur often. Perhaps the case was
different, though. Perhaps he was
knocked on the head, or tumbled
into a hole, or was lost in the
bush. It isn?t at all an uncom-
mon thing for diggers to find hu-
man bones at the bottom of de-
serted holes; holes that haven?t
been touched for a twelvemonth,
perhaps. Sometimes a short-han-
dled shovel will be found, with
blood and hair sticking to it.
They might have belonged to a
man, or they might have belonged
to a goat. It didn?t matter which.
In the Old Country they would kick
up a regular row at such a dis-
covery. All the doctors would be
quarrelling whether it was a man?s
hair or a goat?s, and whether it
was a man?s blood or a bullock?s.
All the newspapers would be full
of it; they wouldn?t let it rest, you
may take your oath of it. But here
we don?t kick up such a row at
such a trifle. We are not so
squeamish as a parcel of old wo-
men.
? I remember,? continued Lilly
Trot, nursing his knees and look-
ing as much like a hedgehog as pos-
sible ??I remember the first time I
heard of the gold-diggings. Wewere
camping near the Porcupine ?San-
dy Jim, German Alf, and me. The
country was ragged enough at that
time, I can tell you. No tobacco
or tea to be bought for love or
money. We had neither love nor
money, so we were forced to help
ourselves from the nearest sheep-
station. We tied up the overseer
and an old woman, slaughtered a
sheep, made up a little assortment
of flour, tea, and sugar, pocketed
all the tobacco we could lay hands
on, took out of the paddock three
of the best horses ?not forgetting
the saddles and bridles ?and then
made tracks as fast as we could
with our booty. German Alf want-
ed to ill-use the old woman, who
must have been nearer sixty years
of age than fifty; and I had to
threaten to shoot him before he
would desist. Sandy Jim, too, swore
he would rip him open, if he wasn?t
quiet; and the pair of us got him
off without any mischief being done.
He was a tarnation thief, was Ger-
man Alf; as black-hearted a thief
as ever breathed. But the devil?s
got tight hold of him now; that?s
one consolation.
? I?ll tell you something. That
old woman called to me just as
I was going out of the room. She
was tied up, and couldn?t move, so
I had to go back to her to know
what she wanted. ?You?re a bad
wicked man,? she said, ? but you?re
not as bad as your mate? ?jerk-
ing her head as if she would have
liked to jerk it at German Alf.
? You have a little good left in you.
Have you got a mother ?? Do you
know, mate, that that question
struck me all of a heap ? Some


thing got into my throat which pre-
vented me from answering her, and
I went out of the hut dazed like.
? When we were well away from
the station we got off our horses,
and sat down to our mutton and
damper.* We were at the end of
our meal, when a horseman rushed
through the bush and almost sent
us flying. We were up in a mo-
ment, and in a twinkling the
flying horseman was on the ground
roaring for mercy. We only did
this in self-defence, you know ; and
in self-defence we thought it neces-
sary to search him, for fear he should
have any loaded weapons about
him. Sure enough we did find a
neat little revolver, a bowie knife,
and a small chamois-leather bag
full of yellow metal, which looked
like brass.
? Halloa, mate!? exclaimed Sandy
Jim; ? what the devil do you carry
brass about you for ??
? Brass !? screamed out the sim-
pleton ; ? it?s as much brass as you
are. It?s gold; that?s what it is !
It?s gold !?
? Simpleton or not ?and he must
have been mad, or something very
near it, to have let out the secret
to such a rough-looking lot as we
were ?he would have been a dead
man in a very short time, if it had
not been for me; for German Alf
had thrown himself on the fool at
the first mention of gold, and was
pressing the life out of him. He
was a devil was German Alf. You
were never safe with him. He would
come behind you and throttle you
without a word of warning, and
smoke his pipe afterwards as cool
as you like. I had to hug him
pretty tightly before I could get
him off; and when he did let go,
he was almost as black in the face
as the man he was trying to choke.
* A kind of roughly-made bread which
bushmen make. Very heavy it is, you may
be sure. But a bushman?s digestive powers
will rival those of an ostrich.
I am not over-particular myself, but
the flying horseman had never done
me any harm, and, besides, I wanted
to get out of him where he had
found the gold. We had heard of
gold being found, and did not know
whether to believe it or not; but
now it seemed as if we were upon
the track of it. Upon our promis-
ing the flying horseman that we
would not hurt him, he told us that
he had found the gold at Bendigo;
that there were a hundred people
there digging up as much as they
could carry; and that we could get
a ton of it if we liked.
? You may guess how excited we
were. We determined to start off
at once; and we made our new
mate go with us. He refused to
do so at first; but when we threat-
ened to murder him, and, indeed,
had a rope round his neck, he
changed his mind, and led the
way. We went a little off the track
to borrow tools from a station ; and
we succeeded in getting two shov-
els and a double-headed pick.
? We got to Bendigo all right, and
set to work at once. We couldn?t
get any ground in Golden Gully,
where the diggers were making
twenty ounces a day; so we crossed
a hill into the next valley, where
we began to work at once. Three
feet down we came to the gold.
We called the gully Dead-Dog
Gully, because we found two or
three dead dogs there. We worked
there for a fortnight; then we shift-
ed our tent to Murdering Flat, where
the gold was not found in such large
pieces as in Dead-Dog Gully; but
there was more of it. Then we
went to Jackass Gully, where we
came upon a nugget which weigh-
ed seventy ounces. Altogether, we
did very well. Wherever we went
we found gold; and as there were
not too many diggers on the gold-
field for the first few weeks, there
wasn?t much squabbling about the
ground. There was more than


room enough for all of us who
were there. We washed a hun-
dred and twenty ounces out of
one bucket of dirt; and we might
have made big fortunes if we had
liked. But we took to drinking
and knocking our money about,
and laying foolish wagers. We got
the gold so easily, and thought so
little of money, that when we went
to a grog-shop to drink, we would
give the man a big pinch of gold
for two or three glasses of whisky.
If we wanted new shirts or boots,
we would go into a store and fit
them on. We were very particular
about our watertight boots?we
liked them to fit well and to look
smart ?and never asked the price.
When we had bought the things
that we did want, and plenty of
things that we didn?t want, we used
to throw a wooden match-box filled
with gold on to the counter, and
say to the storekeeper, ? Take it of
that, mate.? And the storekeeper
did take it of that. We never knew
how much there was in the match-
box ; and we never knew, and never
cared to know, what the storekeeper
took. He would pretend to be very
particular about it; would open the
box carefully, and put a few pinches
of gold into the scale, and put a
little back, and take a little more,
and look at the scales just as they
balanced, and then look at us as
much as to say, ? See what an
honest fellow I am !? or as much
as to say, ? How wrong it is of you
to be so careless with your gold !
But if you can?t take care of your
gold yourself, I must take care of
it for you.? I have heard diggers
lots of times, when the boxes were
handed back to them, say to the
storekeeper, ? Here, take another
pinch, mate,? as if it was snuff.
And the storekeeper would take
another pinch ?not a small one ?
and then ask them if they would
have a drop of grog. That was a
thing they never refused. And after
that, perhaps, they would buy some-
thing else they didn?t want, and
throw the match-box to the store-
keeper, that he might help himself
again. The storekeepers on the
gold-diggings made a fine thing
out of the folly of reckless gold-
diggers.
? Every night we used to assemble
at a shanty called the Go-a-head
Restaurant; and there we used to
drink ourselves blind, very often
winding up with a fight in which
knives would be used, and some
ugly wounds given. Lucky diggers
would play cribbage, or brag, or
a game called eucre, for pinches,
or ounces, or nuggets of gold; and
hundreds of pounds would some-
times be lost and won in an hour.
There was one gambling digger we
called Double-or-Quits, because
when he lost the game he would
cry, ? Double or quits!? and, los-
ing that, would cry, ? Double or
quits!? again ; and then ? Double or
quits!? and ?Double or quits!? again,
until it was all ?quits? with him,
and he had nothing left to ?double?
with. He was one of the luckiest
of all the diggers round about:
wherever he struck his pick, gold
seemed to spring up and beg of
him to take it. He worked like a
nigger all day; and when he had
made fifty or sixty ounces, he would
go and get rid of it at ? double or
quits.? He had a drop of drink in
him once ?it wasn?t the only time
he had it, mate ?and he kissed a
barmaid. When she boxed his
ears for it?which wasn?t what they
always did, mate ?he caught her
round the neck, and cried ?Double
or quits!? and kissed her again. He
came to a queer end, did Double-or-
Quits. He had a quarrel with a
digger; and they agreed to fight it
out. They staked money on the
fight?l forget how much ?and
Double-or-Quits licked his man,
and won. ? I?ll fight you again to-
morrow,? said the man who was


licked. ? All right,? said Double-
or-Quits; ?we?ll fight to-morrow for
the same amount?double orquits.?
They fought the next day. Double-
or-Quits came with a rush. ? Dou-
ble !? he cried as he delivered a
stinging blow. ? Quits !? cried the
other man; and he hit Double-or-
Quits a tremendous blow in the
face, and knocked him senseless.
Double-or-Quits never recovered
from that blow. He took to his
bed, and died a week afterwards.
He was crazed all the time he was
ill, and didn?t know any one about
him. But all the week he was
playing cards with shadows, and
crying out, ?Come along?cut a-
gain. Double or quits !? A minute
before he died he jumped out of
bed, and looked before him in a
fright, thinking, perhaps, that Old
Nick was by his side, and had
come to fetch him. ? Double or
quits !? he screamed, and then, as if
he had lost the game and couldn?t
pay, he threw up his arms and
dropped down dead.
? One night, when we were at
the Go-a-head Restaurant, a digger
related a story about an aboriginal
who had told him that great lumps
of gold were lying on the surface a
hundred miles away. When the
digger asked in what direction the
wonderful land lay, the aboriginal
pointed in the direction of the
Murray River,and had said, ?White
man find plenty yellow stone there.?
The diggers? tongues were very busy
over the story, and nothing else was
talked of all the night. As we walk-
ed home to our tent, Sandy Jim
and German Alf, who were tremen-
dously excited, did all they could
to persuade me to start on a pro-
specting tour to the new diggings.
But I had led a hard life of it in the
bush for a good many years; and
I had made up my mind to go down
to Melbourne for a spree. I pro-
posed that the three of \is should
make tracks for Melbourne, spend
a fortnight there, and have our
spree, and then start for the in-
terior. No; they would not listen
to it. They were mad to get to
the new country, although they did
not know where it was. German
Alf was determined not to stop in
Bendigo another day. Sandy Jim
sided with him. They were deter-
mined ; so was I; and that night
we parted.
? The next morning I was off to
Melbourne, with my gold in a belt
fastened round my waist, and my
life-preserver slung handily on my
wrist. German Alf and Sandy Jim
started for the country where the
gold was lying in big lumps on the
surface ; they started in the dead of
night, for fear that they should be
followed. I was not sorry to part
from German Alf; he was too
treacherous for me. But I did re-
gret parting from old Sandy Jim.
We had shared many dangers and
many hardships together; and he
had always stood by me like a
man. We were once pretty nearly
starved, too, in the bush; another
hour would have cooked us, I be-
lieve. That sort of thing binds
fellows to each other, you know.
Sandy Jim and I didn?t whimper
when we parted. I gave him a
match-box ?a metal one ?that I
had had for a dozen years; and he
gave me a knife?a first-rate Dover;
and we bade each other good-night,
as if we were to meet the next
morning. I never saw him again
alive.
? I wonder if there ever will be
another such a city as Melbourne
was in the first year or two after
the discovery of the gold. I don?t
think there will be. There never
was such a city before; and there
never will be again. All the world
was there : Spaniards and Parley-
voos, Greeks and Malays, Russians
and Indians. John Chinaman was
not there; but he came afterwards.
Such drinking and squandering of


money were never seen before, and
will never be seen again. We were
all mad. I had heaps of money in
the shape of nuggets; so I put up
at the biggest hotel in Melbourne,
and drank champagne at 30 s. a
bottle ?Number Two we called it
?for breakfast, dinner, and tea,
and was as mad as the rest of them.
I was drinking phiz at the Cri-
terion bar, when a mate that I had
known on the diggings came in
and clapped me on the shoulder.
? Hullo, Trot!? he said. ? Hullo,
mate !? I said. And I called for
another bottle of Number Two, and
knocked the neck off, and poured
the champagne into two pewter
pots. When we had drank it, we
exchanged news, which only con-
sisted in the intelligence that we
had both come to Melbourne on a
spree, and that we were jolly glad
to see each other. Little as that
was to say, it took a long time to
say it; and there?s no telling how
long we might have stood there
talking, nor how many bottles of
Number Two we might have crack-
ed, if a voice, that sounded three
parts like a man?s and one part
like a woman?s, hadn?t screamed
out, ? Now, then, Tom ! How much
longer are you going to be ??
?Tom dropped the pewter-pot,
and said, ? Hanged if I wasn?t for-
getting ; that?s my wife.?
? Didn?t know you were married,
mate,? I said.
? More I was,? he said, scratch-
ing his head, ? till an hour ago.
Come out and see her.?
? I went with him to the door of
the hotel; and there in a coach
was his wife, dressed in pink silk ?'
a great red-faced Irishwoman, ten
years older than Tom, A younger
woman, but almost as big, was sit-
ting next to her.
? Only met her yesterday, Trot,?
he whispered. ?Met her yester-
day, married her to-day?that?s the
proper kind of thing to do.?
? Plenty of her,? I whispered
back.
? Isn?t there?? he answered exult-
ingly. ? Can?t get such a woman as
that every day.?
??Very sudden marriage, mate,?
I said.
?Not at all,? he said; ?it?s the
proper kind of thing to do ; it?s the
fashion. Barney the Butcher was
married yesterday; and Fighting
Phil the day before.?
?Were they, though?? I said.
I knew both of them well. ? And
it?s the proper thing to do?eh,
mate ??
?No good coming to Melbourne
without doing it,? he answered.
?Who is that bouncing girl in
the coach, mate ?? I asked.
? That?s Rattling Bet,? he said.
?Jump in and stick up to her.
Show her your nuggets, and she?ll
have you.?
? As it really appeared to be the
proper kind of thing to do, I jump-
ed in by the side of Rattling Bet;
and before the day was over we
arranged to get married.
? She was a stunner was Rattling
Bet. She wouldn?t get married in
anything but white satin; and she
stipulated that, on the day we were
married, we should drive through
Melbourne in a carriage and six,
and treat all the diggers either of
us knew. She got blind drunk on
the wedding-day; but, as I got
blind drunk as well, I hadn?t much
to grumble at.
? Of course I didn?t know it at
the time, but I do believe that that
girl had been married twenty times.
The only thing I did know about
her was, that she was a stunning
big girl, with eyes as black as cher-
ries, and with hair down to her
waist. If she had been born in a
tip-top family, she would have been
thought a regular beauty. She pre-
tended to be in love with ray whist-
ling ; and I believed her, like a
fool. She would say, ? Whistle,


Trot;? and I would sit before her
whistling like a great donkey; and
I daresay she was laughing at me
all the time that I thought she was
admiring me. It wasn?t my whist-
ling she was in love with ; it was
my nuggets. She had made up
her mind to have them ; and have
them she did. That?s what I like in
Rattling Bet. There was nothing
namby-pamby about her. We had
been married just three days I
wouldn?t have known that it wasn?t
three weeks, if it hadn?t been for
dates; for I was drinking day and
night, and wasn?t sober a minute
of the time?when I was brought
to my senses by being told that
Rattling Bet had rattled off with
another lucky digger. She had
rattled off with my nuggets as well.
But I had a few ounces of gold in
deposit in a Melbourne bank; and
I drew it, and spent it in tracking
her. Without success, though; for
she had sloped off to the Sydney
side; and I had my own particular
reasons for not showing myself there
just then. I soon gave up the hunt,
and went back to Jackass Gully;
but I found, when I got there, that
the best of the gold had been dug
out. I went from one gully to
another, and from one diggings to
another; but, although I could al-
ways get gold, I couldn?t get it in
such quantities as when I was mates
with German Alf and Sandy Jim.
I had never heard anything of
them. I used to wonder if they
ever reached the diggings where
the gold was lying in lumps on
the surface. I inquired for them
wherever I went; but nobody could
tell me anything about them; and
it wasn?t until fifteen months after-
wards that I came plump upon
German Alf at a New Rush about
thirty miles from Bendigo.
? Hallo, Alf!? I exclaimed, glad
enough to see an old mate. ? How
are you getting along, mate'??
? Mein Got! Leely !? he cried,
making as though he could have
jumped out of his skin with the
delight ?at seeing me, although I
knew at once from his face that
he was far from pleased at my
coming across him.
? But we did the first thing that
old mates always do when they
meet; we went and had a drink.
When I asked him about Sandy
Jim, he told me, in a way that I
thought was a little bit flurried,
that they had not been able to
agree, and that they had parted.
I was not surprised to hear that,
but I was surprised to hear that
Sandy Jim had gone home to the
old country. For Sandy Jim had
told me, half-a-dozen times, that if
he had the choice and had a thou-
sand a year, he would not go back
to the old country, but would pre-
fer to live and die in Australia. If
he had the choice, I say; because
he didn?t have the choice. He
might have found it too hot for
him in the old country, for he was
sent out for life, the same as I was.
But he had his ticket-of-leave, and
I have mine, and that?s enough for
. me. That is why I was so sur-
prised to hear that Sandy Jim had
gone home. German Alf told me
he was doing well, that he had a
good piece of ground on the New
Rush, and that he intended soon
to give up gold-digging. We didn?t
get along very well together in our
talk, and German Alf felt awkward,
I think, and he pulled out his pipe
for the purpose of having a smoke.
? It is wonderful what a great
deal sometimes comes out of a
very little. If German Alf hadn?t
pulled out his pipe, I shouldn?t
have pulled out my pipe; and if
I hadn?t pulled out my pipe, I
shouldn?t have been able to tell
you this story. For if you want
to smoke a pipe you must light it;
and to light it, if you haven?t a fire,
a match is necessary, and matches
are kept in a match-box; and the


match-box that German Alf pulled
out of his pocket, when we were
going to light our pipes, was the
very match-box I had given to
Sandy Jim fifteen months ago.
? The sight of that match - box
gave me a shock. I?m not a ner-
vous man, and I don?t take shocks
easily, but the sight of that little
metal match-box did give me a
most awful turn. For, says I to
myself, if Sandy Jim is the man I
take him to be, and the man I
know him to be, he wouldn?t have
parted with that box willingly. I
knew it by my own feelings. I
wouldn?t have parted with the knife
he gave me for a hundred pounds.
And then, says I to myself again,
if Sandy Jim didn?t part with that
match-box willingly, he parted with
it unwillingly; and if he parted with
it unwillingly, what then ? All this
ran through my mind while I was
lighting my pipe, and I determin-
ed, come what would, to find out
if my old mate Sandy Jim really
had gone home or not; and if he
hadn?t gone home, to find out what
had become of him. When I asked
German Alf how they had got on
when they went out prospecting
for the big nuggets, he told me a
rum sort of a story about their tra-
velling a hundred miles through the
bush, and that then they had quar-
relled about which was the proper
track to follow, and had parted.
When I asked him how he knew
that Sandy Jim had gone home,
he said he had it from a mate who
came up from Melbourne, and who
said that he saw Sandy Jim on
board ship an hour before it sail-
ed. ? That is all I know about it,
Leely,? said German Alf. I nod-
ded my head, and said I supposed
that Jim had gone home, and that
I was sorry I had not seen him
before he left. I never said a
word about the match-box. ? Can
you give me a shake-down to-
night, Alf?? I asked. No, he said,
he couldn?t. He was so sorry, al-
most ready to cry; but his tent
was only eight feet by ten, and
two of his mates slept in it besides
himself. O ho! thought I; you?ve
got something in that tent you don?t
want me to see. With that I wished
him good-bye. But I didn?t lose
sight of him. Not I. I tracked
him to his tent that evening. It
wasn?t an eight by ten?the lying
thief! it was double that size. But
what do you think was chained to
the side of that tent ? Why, Sandy
Jim?s dog! ?my old mate?s dog
Lion, that he wouldn?t have parted
with for his life. And directly I cast
eyes on that dog, I said to myself,
? Lilly Trot, there has been foul play
with your old mate, and you must
find out what has become of him!??
And here Lilly Trot, having
worked up his story dramatically,
dropped the curtain of silence up-
on the act, and paused for a while.
The night by this time was some-
what advanced, and a distant roll-
ing of thunder betokened the pos-
sible approach of a storm. I could
only see my companion?s face when
it was lighted up by the glare from
the blazing tree, and then it looked
strangely weird-like. The shadows
that were created by the flickering
fire seemed to be imbued with life,
and to mock the element that
shaped them. Lilly Trot dug his
heel into the blazing trunk, and a
shower of sparks flew upwards, and
a thousand fantastic shades tore at
the bosom of the earth; then, as
the bright sparks died in the
gloomy night and fell to earth, the
dark shadows ran up the trees and
leapt from branch to branch, from
trunk to trunk, until they were lost
in the black depths of the surround-
ing forest. I could imagine them
creeping on us, when the fire was
extinguished, like stealthy devils?
gliding towards us from tree to
tree, until they came upon us while
we were sleeping, and struck us


dead. The scene was drear enough
for the creation of those or other
fancies as strange. I was glad when
Lilly Trot resumed his story.
? The sight of that dog,? he con-
tinued, ? did give me a turn. I felt
as'if a flash of lightning had l ighted
up my brain. I had fifty pictures
in my mind in a moment, but the
ugliest one of them all was the
picture of dear old Sandy Jim ly-
ing dead upon the ground, and
German Alf grinning over him.
Lion was the finest and most
faithful beast I ever knew; and I
had often heard Sandy Jim say
that he would rather be a poor
beggar all his life with Lion for
a companion, than a rich cove
without him. He was a brave
dog. It was a difficult matter
getting out of his clutches, if his
blood was up, once you were in
them. He would hold on like
grim death ; and in former times
had been the terror of every dog
in his neighbourhood. He was
cut and bitten all over from the
battles he had fought. How the
dickens German Alf managed to
keep him, and how he had got
hold of him at all, was more than
I was ever able to discover. The
best part of all this came into my
head while I was having my tea in
a grog-shanty near German Alt?s
tent. For after I caught sight of
Lion, I crept quietly away; it was
not dark enough yet for me to do
anything, and I did not want Ger-
man Alf to see me skulking about
his tent. I made inquiries about
German Alf, and I found out that
he was generally disliked, that he
did not associate with any of the
gold - diggers, and that he was
spoken of by nearly everybody as
a miserly, rich, surly German thief.
One thing I made up my mind to,
and that was to have Sandy Jim?s
dog that very night.
? So, when it got dark, I watched
German Alf out of his tent ?where
he was living all by himself, and
not with two mates, as he had told
me ?and when he was well out of
sight, I crept near to the dog?s chain.
Not near enough for him to get
hold of me ; I knew the nature of
the dog too well for that. Lion?s
chain rattled as I approached;
and I knew by that and a low
kind of a growl that he used to
give a growl that would last
for five minutes together, with-
out his seeming to wait to catch
breath ?that Lion knew there was
some person near his tub, who,
perhaps, didn?t have any business
there. There was an old tune
that Sandy Jim used to whistle ?a
tune that I never heard from any-
body but himself; he called it ? The
Ploughman?s Delight.? So, while
the dog was growling, I commenced
to whistle this tune, in exact imita-
tion of my old mate. As I whistled,
Lion?s growling grew fainter and
fainter, until it stopped altogether ;
and then I knew that the dog was
puzzled and was considering; for
he and I had always been good
friends, and he had heard me whistle
? The Ploughman?s Delight? a good
many times. I whistled the tune
right through, and then I called,
? Lion ! Lion !? In a moment the
dog came towards me as far as the
chain would allow him ; and then
I took courage to creep closer to
him. ? Lion ! Lion !? I called, and
I put out my hand. He knew me
directly. He licked my hand, and
I crept right up to him and played
with him. He jumped about me
with so much delight, that I thought
he would break his chain. And
sure enough he did break it, snap-
ping it clean away from the side
of the tent. I could not have
wished for anything better, as now
German Alf, when he found that
Lion was gone, would not be so
certain that I had made off with
him; and I did not want to arouse
Alf?s suspicions.


? I made off at once into the
bush, the rattle of the chain along
the ground telling me that the dog
was close on my heels; and, when
we had got to what I considered a
safe distance, I knelt down and
wrenched the collar from Lion?s
throat and threw it away. ? Now,
Lion,? I said, placing his two fore-
paws against my shoulders, and
looking into his eyes ?it was dark,
but I could see his eyes blazing?
? now, Lion, I want to find out
what has become of Sandy Jim,
your governor, my old boy. I don?t
believe he has been rightly dealt
with ; and if anything foul has hap-
pened to him, I?ll find it out, so
help me God ! and you shall help
me to do it.? Upon my word, the
faithful old rip knew what I was
saying as well as I did myself; and
I do believe that he swore an oath
as strong as mine that he would
help me to discover what had be-
come of his governor. In a week
from that time I was in Jackass
Gully, on the very spot where I had
last seen German Alf and Sandy
Jim together. The old tent was
there, very ragged and dirty, but
the man who lived in it did not
know anything about my mate. I
was pretty hard up at that time,
and I fossicked about Jackass Gully
in some of the old spots, which were
not rich enough for us when we
first went there. I went down the
hole we sank where we had got so
much gold, and, as luck would have
it, I did find a little bit of the gol-
den gutter which we had neglected
to take away; and out of that bit
of earth ?not four bucketsful alto-
gether?l washed ten ounces of
gold. That was enough for me just
then, and, blessing my stars, I started
off the next morning in the direc-
tion that German Alf and Sandy
Jim had taken when they went to
look for the surface gold a hundred
miles away. On the afternoon of
the first day I was standing at the
opening of two tracks, one to the
right, one to the left, puzzled which
one to take. I had made up my
mind to take the one which was
the most trodden, and had walked
along it a dozen yards, when I felt
Lion pulling at the chain which I
had put round his neck. I didn?t
take much notice of him at first,
but when his tugging got inconve-
nient, and when I heard him whin-
ing as if he were in trouble, I turned
to see what was the matter. I had
no sooner done so than Lion jerked
the chain clean out of my hand,
and ran to the other track, where
he stood looking at me and wag-
ging his old tail. Now that made
me consider what could be the
reason of Lion?s anxiety, and why
he didn?t seem inclined to follow
me.
?And strike me dead!?exclaimed
Lilly Trot, so excitedly that he made
my blood jump through my veins,
?if it didn?t come upon me like
sudden daylight, that the dog knew
the road my two mates had taken ;
knew that I wanted to take the
same track, and wanted to lead me
to where I might find some clue.
There?s more in dogs than we know
of, mate. They can?t speak our
language, but they have got almost
as much sense as we have. They
are better than us, too, for they
never forget.?
? And they are worse than us,
Lilly,? I said, speaking for the first
time, ? for they never forgive.?
?That is true enough; though
how Lion ever came near German
Alf without snapping at him, is a
mystery. When that dog stood upon
the track I had left, and looked
back at me, I made up my mind
that he could take me to every
spot where Sandy Jim and German
Alf had passed in their prospecting
tour; and I made up my mind, too,
to let him lead me where he liked.
So, walking up to him, I stooped
and patted the faithful beast?s head,


and holding the chain loosely, fol-
lowed at his heels. He was wiser
than a human creature; he never
hesitated a moment. Sometimes we
came upon three or four tracks,
leading different ways; but Lion
always took one of them without
hesitation. On the second day we
came to a large tent, with a few
bottles of ginger-beer upon a bench
outside. There Lion made a dead
stand. I didn?t lug at his chain;
but going in to the tent, asked the
owner if he had anything stronger
than ginger-beer.
? After looking at me for a mo-
ment to see if I was a detective?
for it was a sly grog-shanty, and the
detectives were down upon those
shops for selling spirits without a
license?he seemed satisfied that I
wasn?t an informer, and he served
me a glass of gin, and took one him-
self at my invitation. When I paid
for the drink, he came to the door
and saw Lion.
?I have seen that dog before,
mate,? he said.
? Long ago ?? I asked in an easy
tone, although my heart was beat-
ing very fast.
? A matter of more than a year
ago, I daresay,? he answered.
? There were two men with him
then, mate,? I ventured to say, in
a careless manner, and pretending
to do something to the dog?s collar.
? Yes,? he said; ?but you wasn?t
one of ?em.?
? No, I wasn?t,? I said. ? Good-
day, mate.? And I walked away;
only for a dozen yards, though; for
turning round to where the man
was standing looking after us, I
said, ? Did you see them when they
came back, mate ??
? I saw one of ?em,? he said.
? My back felt as if a bucket of
ice-water had been poured down it,
as I asked, ? Which one ??
? He laughed, and looked at me
queerly, as if he thought I had a
tile loose.
? How should I know which
one ?? he answered.
? The dog was with him,? I re-
marked.
? Yes,? he said, looking at Lion,
?the dog was with him?all bloody;
looked as though he had been badly
beaten.?
? That was enough for me. I
bade him good-day again, and walk-
ed away. When we were out of
sight of the tent, I threw myself
upon the ground, and Lion stretch-
ed himself before me, watching me
with his bloodshot eyes.
?Two of them went this way,
Lion,? I said, ? and only one of
them came back, ?which one, good
dog, eh? which one? Sandy Jim
or German Alf??
? Lion wagged his tail in the dust,
as much as to say, ?I could tell
you, if I could speak; but you ought
to know without my telling.?
? I do know,? I said, just as if
Lion had spoken the words. ?If
it had been Sandy Jim that brought
you back, you wouldn?t have been
all bloody. Your old governor never
gave you a blow; he had no need
to. You knew every note in his
voice, didn?t you, Lion ? and you
were too glad to obey when he
spoke. It was German Alf who
brought you back, and who beat
you into submission. Then where
did you leave your old governor
and my dear old mate, tell me that,
Lion??
?The dog rose ?never tell me
that dogs can?t understand what
you say?and said in a sorrowful
bark, ? Come along; I will show
you where we left him.?
? I solemnly swear that I had
nothing to do with it. I was like
one in a dream, waiting quietly to
wake up to find out something
which wasn?t clear in my mind.
That dog picked out the places
where we camped for the night;
picked out the grog-shanties on the
road, and made me stop and drink;


picked out the creeks where I got
water to boil for dinner and tea,
and led me on through thick and
thin, until we came to a wooden
hut, a dozen miles away from any
tent on the road. It was noon
when we came to this hut. The
dog had behaved himself very
strangely all that morning. He
wouldn?t let me have a moment?s
rest. He was whining and jump-
ing about the whole of the time,
and running before me as if I wasn?t
quick enough for him. We had
been out for five days, and had
walked, I daresay, a matter of a
hundred and forty miles. Within
the last mile or two I had noticed
a few shallow holes sunk a long
while since, and I thought it like
that they had been sunk by Sandy
Jim and German Alf. But with the
exception of my notion that there
had been foul play, and my faith
in Lion, and my belief that he was
leading me to a place where I
should make a discovery, I had no
clue to guide me. When we came
to the wooden hut, Lion behaved
as if he had really gone mad. He
barked and whined to such a de-
gree, that he set two other dogs at
the back of the hut barking and
whining in chorus. The noise
brought a man to the door, who
asked what the hot place I wanted
hanging about his tent for, and
whether I saw anything that did
not belong to me that I had taken
a fancy to.
?Do you take me for a thief,
mate ?? I asked in a pretty quarrel-
some manner, for my blood was up.
?Yes, I do,? he said, ? and that?s
flat. I suppose your mates are pretty
close behind you ??
? What mates ?? I asked.
? What mates !?? he shouted in a
furious passion. ?D?ye take me for a
greenhorn, you skulking thief? D?ye
think I don?t know that dog there ?
The last time I saw him the two
skunks that were with him stole my
tea, stole my sugar, and stole my
axe, curse them ! They wouldn?t
have stolen much more, I can tell
you, if I had caught them. I would
have shot them as lief as I would
a dingo.?
? I was civil in a minute. ?That
was more than a year ago, mate,?
I said.
?Yes, it was more than a year
ago, mate,? he repeated, in such a
sneering manner that it was as much
as I could do to keep my hands
down. ? And you pretend not to
know anything about it, do you ?
Look here now. lam going in to
fetch my gun ; and if you are not
off when I come back, I will put a
few slugs into your thieving car-
cass !? With that he ran into the
hut to fetch his gun.
? I knew he meant what he said ;
and as I didn?t want to quarrel just
then, I walked away. I was so con-
fused in my mind, what with pas-
sion, and doubt, and fear, that I
did not for a long time discover
that we were off the track; but
when I did notice it, it did not
trouble me; for Lion was scudding
along in front of me, with his chain
trailing loose on the ground, and
looking back every minute to see if
I was following him.
? We must have gone about six
miles from the hut, and were in the
midst of the thick bush, when Lion
suddenly stopped still, about fifty
yards ahead of me. He appeared
to be very agitated, and when I
reached his side he was scratching
at the earth furiously, and tossing
it wildly about. When I saw that,
I was prepared for everything.
? I went away from the spot where
Lion was tearing at the earth, and
the dumb beast looked at me wist-
fully, as if he thought I was going
to give up the search at the last
moment. But I didn?t intend to
do that. I was going farther into
the bush to see if I could discover
something?l did not know what;


perhaps a button off Sandy Jim?s
clothes; perhaps a cap, a handker-
chief, anything. And I did. Sod-
dened down into the earth with the
rain, buried beneath fallen twigs
and branches, with its handle worm-
eaten and rotten, and its steel black
and rusty, I found ?an axe. The
very axe, perhaps, that German Alf
had stolen from the hut. I took it
up very carefully; for I knew that
some of the rust upon it might be
the rust of poor Jim?s blood. I
went back to the dog: he was stand-
ing in the middle of a hole he had
scratched out, and he was whining
in a most awfully distressing man-
ner over some charred bones. As
the dog raised his head to the skies,
I saw the tears running down his
face, and his whines sounded like
a lamentation for the dead and an
appeal for justice. I thought how
strangely things come about; here
was a foul murder discovered all
through a little match - box not
worth twopence, I knew how the
murder had been committed as well
as if I had seen it. Here was my
poor old mate asleep. There was
German Alf standing over him with
the axe, hungering for his gold.
Down comes the axe, once, twice,
ay, again, and again, to make
sure. Good-bye, poor Jim ! you?ve
got your ticket-of-leave in real
earnest, and nobody can cancel it
now. Then German Alf had burnt
poor old Jim, and had buried what
he couldn?t get rid of. I hadn?t
had anything to eat all the day, but
I didn?t feel a bit hungry; I was
filled with something else. I talked
to Lion, and told him all about it;
and he whined and lamented as I
told the story; and when I finished,
his face grew as stern as mine was
?he had made up his mind to
avenge his master?s murder. But
there was work to do, and there
was no time for idling. I was no
time finding my way to the hut
again, and making friends with the
hut-keeper.; I was no time getting
a sack, and placing in it everything
I could find that would prove the
murder; and placing in it, too, the
few remains I could find of poor
Sandy Jim. I was as little time
as possible getting back to the
New Rush, where German Alf was
working, I walked all the way with
my swag on my back, and the sack
safely secured in the middle. It
was night when I got in, I don?t
know how it was that I didn?t think
of taking anybody with me; I was
too excited, I suppose. I walked
straight to German Alf?s tent; there
was a light inside, and I kicked at
the door. German Alf, who was
undressing himself, came and asked
with an oath who was there.
? Lilly Trot,? I cried, and I gave
another kick. He opened the door,
and I pushed my way in with the
dog at my heels.
? Got dam ! Leely !? he cried,
? What the devil bring you here ?
My dog, too!?
? I suppose there was an expres-
sion in my face that made him pull
up short. He was about to say
something else, but, instead of say-
ing it, he began to swear, I waited
until he was quiet, and then I said,
? Do you see this sack ??
? He nodded, ?Yes.?
? Do you know what there is in
it?? I asked.
? No,? he said.
? Can you guess ??
? No,? again, with the blood de-
serting his lips.
? You cursed villain !? I said,
almost choking. ? Sandy Jim?s
bones are in it. I?ve been home
for them. You murdered him, you
infernal scoundrel, and you shall
swing for it, as sure as there?s a
God in heaven !?
? I had scarcely finished when
he levelled a revolver at me. I
wrenched it from his hand. He
turned, caught up a short-handled
shovel, and was swinging it down


upon my head, when Lion sprang
upon him, and, boring him to the
ground, tore away at his throat. I
went to the door, and fired the re-
volver into the air. A hundred
diggers rushed to the tent, and I
told them the story in a few words,
and they took the dog away, all
bloody about the mouth, and tied
German Alf hand and foot.
? Of course the black - hearted
villain was hanged for it: the evi-
dence was too strong for him. I
have got the match-box to this
day,? concluded Lilly Trot, pulling
it out of his pocket and holding it
in the bright glare of the blazing
tree ; ? and I often think of poor
old Jim when I strike a fnatch. It
is strange, isn?t it, that such a little
thing as this should have been the
means of bringing to light one of
the coldest-blooded murders that
was ever committed ??
CHATEAUX EN ESPAGNE.
Where?s the harm, tell me where,
Of building castles in the air?
An airy fairy nothingness
That brings a sweet forgetfulness ?
The child sits still with pensive eye,
And starts to hear the sudden cry,
? Again I see your vacant stare ?
Building your castles in the air !?
The weary boy has closed his book,
And sits with dreamy wandering look :
Again the cry of ? Whence that stare ?
Still at your castles in the air ??
The man lies gazing at the sky;
Then sudden starts, with bitter sigh :
? My happiest moments still are there,
Within those castles in the air.?
What man or woman, girl or boy,
But?s tasted of the secret joy
That?s in the fairy chambers lain
Of their own ? chateaux en Espagne? ?
So where?s the harm, tell me where,
Of building ? castles in the aid?
This airy fairy nothingness
That brings such sweet forgetfulness ?
