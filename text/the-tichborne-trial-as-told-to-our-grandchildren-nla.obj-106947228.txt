These are the Documents —all were read
To prove that the claimant long since thought dead
Is still alive—in the box does stand,
And holds his own photograph in his own hand.
These are the Clerks each morning who bring
Huge piles of papers tied neatly with string,
The bag that each bears is so heavy a weight,
Ko wonder not one of the clerks walks straight.
This is the claimant's Ghost who each morn
Haunts the court to see how his case gets on,
Tor though the Judge has for years been dead.
And the Jury have all from the box long fled,
And the Usher his sombre robes has laid by,
And there’s nought in the court but a bluebottle fly
He hopes some day that the case will end,
And then from his purgatory he may wend.
This is the Cabman, who first brought
In his brand new cab the claimant to court,
The man like his cab has now grown old,
And the horse that drew it was long since sold.
And scores since then that cab that drew,
Have gone to the knackers for aught I know.

This is the firm of Lawyers so famed,
Baxter, Hose, Norton & Co. they’re named,
Who so well conducted the Claimant’s case,
No other firm would e’er take their place.

These are the Reporters who notes did take
Of all that was said till their hands so shake,
Whilst their fingers a pen could scarcely hold,
But they heeded not that so their papers sold.
This is the Attorney General who stands,
And speaks for weeks without raising his hands,
And he calls the claimant all sorts of names,
Until in a rage Serjeant B. exclaims,
His learned brother must draw it mild,
For the jury are not to be thus beguiled.
This is the Belendant in this strange case,
Who now has an innocent child-like face,
But ere it is ended, to manhood grown,
IBs face will be covered o’er thickly with down.
This is the famous Serjeant B.
Whose eloquent fervour’s a sight to see,
As he pleads the claimant's case so strong.
In a speech as powerful as it is long
These are the People, one and all.
Who throng to o’erflowing the spacious hall.
To enter the court in vain they try,
Not one in a hundred can ever get nigh.
These are the Witnesses all in a row,
Who every one did the Claimant know,
That he is himself not one of them doubt,
Tho’ when they last saw him he wasn’t so stout,
This is the Court so confined and small,
Where the trial took place at Westminster Hall.
This is the Claimant, once slender and tall,
Who with his huge presence now fills the hall,
Though all are puzzled, he’s grown so stout.
That he’s still the same man his friends never
doubt.
