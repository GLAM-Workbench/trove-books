PRESIDENT.
OBITUAEY.
ADDR E S S
TO THE
ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY
OF LONDON;
Delivered at the Anniversary Meeting on the 2Qth May , 1862,
the Lord Ashburton,
In the Report which has been read, you have heard of the
increasing numbers of this Society?numbers which begin even to
exceed the space which we can assign to them. But at the same
time there is another review to make?the melancholy review of
our losses. There have passed away from among us men of
European reputations, lamented not only by the friends they loved,
but by the public they have served; who have laboured in their
day not only for the generations among whom they lived, but for all
time and for all humanity. As the narrow circle of kindred
within which a man has lived, hasten with pious reverence to cele-
brate solemn obsequies over his tomb, so the wider circle within
which he has worked, find a pride and glory in recording the
worth and recounting the actions of the fellow-labourer they
deplore.
I begin our melancholy list by recording the death of our Royal
Yice-Patron, the late Prince Consort. His vigilant eye was not
confined to the science of geography alone; it extended to every
science, every pursuit which could in any way contribute to the
?welfare of his fellow men. Our grief for the irreparable loss wo
have ourselves sustained, has been still farther intensified by our


sympathy with that great Lady, our Queen and Governor, in whom
we glory, and on whom we have concentrated all that we have of
respect, admiration, and love.
The Prince alone could, from his universal and accurate know-
ledge, and his exalted position, carry out to their successful com-
pletion, a course of measures by which ho hoped 'to secure for his
adopted country an honourable supremacy in every department of
science and of art. Such I believe to have been the determinate
purpose of our Vice-Patron. He has passed away from among us,
and where shall we find his like? Where shall we find such
power, such knowledge, such earnest zeal, such deliberate wisdom,
such patient endurance of opposition ?
Where shall wo find a constancy inspired by love to us, and ele-
vated by the aspirations of a noble mind for the advancement of
mankind ? On every public and private occasion he gave to men
distinguished in art, science, or literature, that social position to
which they, were entitled. He exerted himself by every means in
his power to enlarge the sphere of education.
Ho organized and completed the Great Exhibition of 1851. It
was then, when we came into direct conflict with other nations, that
our manufacturers found that for the higher branches of their
respective arts they must have French designers, French painters,
and Italian modellers. They became conscious of their inferiority
in taste and workmanship; they found the want of such public
institutions as had facilitated in foreign countries the cultivation of
the artist and the mechanic.
Public opinion thus roused, enabled the Government to carry out
the Prince?s views, by the establishment' of schools of art and
science throughout the country.
Already in 1855, enlightened foreigners were struck by the
progress which had been made in four short years. Eight more
have now elapsed; improvement has been going on in an acce-
lerated ratio, A measure of progress is applied this year, by the
Exhibition of 1802, to test the success of the Prince?s plans and
labours; but the originator of them all is not there, to hear the uni-
versal voice of praise and gratitude. His far-seeing eye is closed,
his fostering hand is cold. Science has lost her noblest patron,
England her surest guide.
Thomas William Atkinson, the Siberian traveller, was born of
humble parents at Cawthorne, a village in the West-Eiding of
Yorkshire, on the 6th of March, 1799, and the only education he


received was at its village-school. At the ago of eight years ho
followed the plough, at ten he began to earn his own livelihood as
a bricklayer?s labourer and quarry man, and afterwards worked in a
stonemason?s yard.
In 1819 he was employed as mason in rebuilding St. Mary?s (the
old) Church at Barnsley, where he distinguished himself by carving
some unusually fine work, and showed so much talent that he was
strongly recommended to try his fortune in a larger sphere.
In accordance with this advice he went to London, and in 1827
he established himself in Upper Stamford Street, Borough, as an
architect. In 1842 he left England for Hamburg, where he was
engaged during 1845 in the reconstruction of the church of St.
Nicholas, and where he obtained some patronage from the King
of Prussia.
He next visited Egypt and Greece, and in 1846, by the advice of
Baron Humboldt, went to Russia. He there formed the project of
an artist?s journey into Siberia ; and the Emperor of Russia granted
him the rare privilege of a i blank pass throughout his Asiatic
dominions. The crowning effort of Mr. Atkinson?s life then com-
menced ; he started on his journey through southern Siberia, the
Kirghis Steppes, and parts of Central Asia.
On his return he published his Travels, entitled ? Oriental and
Western Siberia,? in 1858, and ? The Upper and Lower Amoor,? &o.
in 1860.
James Brant, c.b., was a gentleman well known to many travellers
and tourists, from his long official connection with Eastern countries.
He was appointed Vice-Consul at Trebizond, in 1830, and Consul
at Erzenim in 1836, where he remained till the close of the Russian
war, and was then transferred to Damascus. He retired from the
service in 1860, and died suddenly last year at the age of seventy.
Sir William Cubitt, c.k, &c. ?This remarkable man, who, unaided
either by powerful friends or patronage of any kind, raised himself
from a comparatively humble position to one of affluence and high
standing, was the author of several eminently useful inventions
in various branches of mechanics. He was the engineer to the
South Eastern Railway, and it was under his directions that the
heavy works between Dover and Folkestone were executed, in-
cluding the removal of masses of earth by the means of gunpowder,
on a scale beyond what had been previously attempted. There was,
indeed, scarcely any engineering work of magnitude executed during
his career to which, ip some way or other, he did not contribute;


his last works being the two remarkable landing-stages in the Mer-
sey at Liverpool, and the bridge over the Medway at Rochester.
He was an old and esteemed Member of the Institute of Civil
Engineers, and, as their President, was, in the year 1861, chosen
one of the Eoyal Commissioners of the Great Exhibition. In that
capacity he superintended the erection of the building in Hyde
Park, and, in recognition of his gratuitous services on that occasion,
received at the hands of the Queen the honour of Knighthood.
Eear-Admiral the Hon. J. F. F. He Eos died at the age of fifty-
seven. He passed many years of service on the American station,
and wrote a ? Narrative of Travels in the United States and Canada.?
Ho also published ? Observations on the Maritime Eesources of
North America, and on the State of the Dockyards and Navy.?
Vice-Admiral the Hon. Sir Eichard Saunders Dundas, k.c.b.?
This gallant officer was born in 1802, and was for a short time at
Harrow School, which place he left at the ago of thirteen, to enter
the Eoyal Naval College. He first went afloat in June, 1817, and
having obtained his rank of Lieutenant, was, in 1823, after some
years of active service, made Commander. In the spring of 1827
ho was appointed to the Warspite, 76; in which ship, the first of her
class that ever circumnavigated the globe, he returned to England
from New South Wales in the October following. After command-
ing the Belvidere, he was appointed to the Melville , and subsequently
in that ship was present at the opening scenes of the first war in
China. While there ho received the thanks of Sir Gordon Bremer
for his conduct at the capture of Ty-cock-tow in January, 1841, and
afterwards received honourable mention in the Admiral?s de-
spatches for his gallantry in the action which preceded the capture
of the fort of the Boga Tigris. From 182ff to 1830 he was Private
Secretary to his father, Viscount Melville, when First Lord of the
Admiralty; and in January, 1845, on the late Earl of Haddington
becoming First Lord, he assisted that nobleman in a similar capa-
city. He was appointed Captain Superintendent of Deptford Dock-
yard in 1851, and in December, 1852, a Lord Commissioner of the
Admiralty. In 1855 he was selected as Commander-in-Chief of the
Baltic fleet, in the place of the late Admiral Sir Charles Napier.
In 1857 he resumed his seat at the Admiralty Board, and continued
attached to that department up to the time of his death, which took
place suddenly on the 3rd June, 1861. The deceased officer received
the honour of Knighthood in 1856, after the clo�e of the Eussiap
war.


Hugh, Earl Fortescue, k.g., died at Exeter on September 14th,
1861, aged seventy-eight. The deceased was educated at Brasenose
College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1803, and M.A. in
1810. He first entered the House of Commons in 1804, and repre-
sented various places in that House until 1841, when he was sum-
moned to the House of Peers. He held the office of Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland from 1839 to 1841 ; and from 1846 to 1850, he was Lord
Steward of Her Majesty?s Household. On the resignation of his
father, some twenty years back, he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant
and Vice-Admiral of the county of Devon. The deceased peer was
Vice-President of University College, London, and a D.C.L. of
Oxford. He also figured in the paths of literature, having pub-
lished, with a memoir, a selection from the speeches and writings of
the late Lord King, father of the present Earl of Lovelace.
Captain Walter Colquhoun Grant, the author of an able and
vivid description of Vancouver Island, published in the twenty-
seventh volume of our Journal, died at Saugor, Central India, aged
thirty-nine. He was the only son of the late chief of the intelli-
gence department of the army commanded by the Duke of Welling-
ton in the Peninsula. He did good service in the Crimean war,
and again in India he assisted in the siege of Lucknow, and suc-
ceeded to the command of the regiment of irregular cavalry known
as Ist Hodson?s Horse. One of Captain Grant?s last acts was to
prepare and transmit to this Society a map and paper on Sikkim,
which, however, have not yet reached their destination.
The Pev. Edward Craven Hawtrey, d.d., died at Eton College on
the 27th of January of this year. Dr. Hawtrey was educated on
the foundation of Eton College, where he was elected as scholar to
King?s College, Cambridge, in 1808, and having taken his B.A.
degree in 1812, he became an Assistant-Master at Eton under the
late Dr. Keate, whom he succeeded as Head Master in 1834. He
held the headmastership till 1853, during which time the number
of pupils increased to nearly eight hundred, and was then appointed
to the provostship, rendered vacant by the death of the well known
and accomplished scholar the Pev. Francis Hodgson. A volume of
English Hexameters, published in 1847, and consisting mainly of
translations from Goethe, Schiller, Homer, &c., contained many
contributions by Dr. Hawtrey. His contributions to the ? Arun-
dines Cami ? are also well known to scholars. He printed in 1839
a volume of Italian poetry, called * De Trilogis,? and at Paris, some
able * Lectures on the Church Catechism,? delivered in Eton College


Chapel in 1845-9, and a continuation of them in 1852, besides
several sermons and lectures.
Robert William Hay died at Malta, aged seventy-four. He was
educated at All Souls, Oxford, and filled for some time the office of
Private Secretary to the late Viscount Melville when First Lord of
the Admiralty. He was Under-Secretary for the Colonial Depart-
ment in the year 1836.
Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Herbert, k.c.b., entered the navy in
1803, and was appointed to the command of the Tamar in 1822.
In 1837, having been ashore for fourteen years, he was appointed
to the Calliope , and proceeded to the Brazils. Subsequently he was
ordered to assume the command of the naval force in Eio de la
Plata. In 1840 he joined Admiral C. B. H. Boss at Valparaiso,
whence in the following June he sailed for China. Arriving in the
Canton Eiver on the 10th of October, he assumed, and until the
arrival of Admiral Elliot on the 20th of November, retained, the
command of the blockading force. On the 7th of January, 1841, he
conducted the attack on the enemy?s forts at Chucnpee, where
eleven powerful junks were destroyed ; and on the 23rd of February,
being at the time on board the Nemesis , he destroyed a 20-gun
battery at the back of the island Anunghoy. After several other
important services, a full account of which will be found in our
Fellow Captain Hall?s valuable work, ? The Nemesis in China,? and
having received the honour of knighthood, Sir Thomas returned
home in the Blenheim in March, 1843. In January, 1847, he was
appointed Commodore on the south-east coast of America. From
February until December, 1852, he was one of the junior Lords
of the Admiralty. He represented Dartmouth in the House of
Commons from July, 1852, to April, 1857, and died, after a pro-
tracted illness, on August sth, 1861.
Charles Edward Lefroy died April 16th, 1861, aged 51. Having
obtained his M.A. degree at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1832, he was
called to the Bar at Lincoln?s Inn in the same year. In 1841 he
was Secretary to the late Speaker of the House of Commons (the
Eight Hon. Charles Shaw Lefevre, now Viscount Eversley), and
in 1856 was appointed Taxing-Master to the House of Commons.
The deceased was also a J.P. for Hampshire.
James Ormiston M'William, m.d., f.r.s., was chief medical officer
to the disastrous expedition in 1841, under Captain Trotter, r.n., in
which his name is familiar to all who are convei?sant with the
history of Niger enterprise. During the return voyage of the


afflicted party, when the survivors were mostly fever-stricken, Dr.
M? William and Dr. Stanger displayed an energy and devotion which
demanded and obtained the most grateful acknowledgments. His
experience gained on this fearful occasion has been of marked
utility to subsequent travellers, and is recorded in his well-known
? Medical History of the Niger Expedition.?
Mr. Samuel Leigh Sotheby, who will be remembered by his great
work on Block Printing, and by a smaller publication, which he
had only just completed, ? Wanderings in Search of Milton?s Auto-
graph,? was found in the early part of last June drowned in the
river Dart, his death being attributed by his physician to a spasm
of the heart.
Major-General Sir Claude Marten Wade, c.b., died at Bath on
October 21st, 1861, aged sixty-seven. He commenced his valuable
public career in 1809, by entering the military service of the East
India Company, in which he rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel
in 1839, and afterwards received the local rank of full Colonel in
India. Whilst holding his military commission he was constantly
employed in various important civil posts. In 1823 ho was ap-
pointed diplomatic agent at Ludianah, and in 1835 was placed in
charge of our relations with Eunjeet Sing and the States across the
Indus. In 1838 he was sent on a special mission to Peshawur, to
join the Sikh army with Shahzuda Timur, and was the first to force
the celebrated Khyber Pass, In 1848 ho was nominated political
agent at Malwa, in Central India, this being the last civil appoint-
ment he held.
The Eev. Dr. Joseph Wolff, whose name is so intimately asso-
ciated with Eastern travel, was the son of a Eabbi, and was bom at
Weilersbach, in the year 1795. He was converted to Christianity
through his acquaintance with the Count of Stolberg and Bishop
Seiler, and was prevailed upon to enter the Monastery of the
Redemptorists at Yal-Saint, near Tribourg. Being unable to
convince himself of the truth of Romanism as taught there, he left
Yal-Saint and came to London; and after studying the Oriental
languages under Dr. Lee of Cambridge, and theology under the
late Eev. Charles Simeon, commenced his travels for the purpose of
proclaiming the Gospel to the Jews, Mohamedans, and Pagans.
He travelled in Mesopotamia, Persia, and the Crimea; incessantly
preaching at every town and village he visited. From 1831 to
1834, Dr. Wolff proceeded to search for the Ten Tribes. A full
aepoupt of these wajicjerjpgs {*pd of bis second journey to Bokhara,


in order, if possible, to effect tlie liberation of Colonel Stoddart
and Captain Conolly, as also of his visit to the United States, will
be found in his works.
I have only recorded a few of those who have, by their labours,
contributed to geographical science and discovery. There are
others whose cheerful presence we miss, sedulous attendants of our
meetings, contributors to our funds.*
Admiralty Surveys.']-
The Coast Surveys in course of execution under the orders of
the Admiralty, both at home and abroad, have made the usual
progress during the past year. They are conducted by twenty
different surveying parties, one-half of whom are employed on the
coasts of the United Kingdom; the remainder in the colonies of
Australia, Cape of Good Hope, West Indies, Nova Scotia, New-
foundland, and Vancouver Island; and on the foreign coasts of
Syria, Cyrenaica, in Banka Strait, China, and Japan.
England. The Coast Survey of the British Isles is so nearly
complete that the account of its advance from year to year must
necessarily be made up of minor topographical details, which would
bo out of place in a general view of the progress of geography
all over the globe, were it not for their important bearing on
navigation, and their being of special interest to the numerous
class connected with the vast commercial marine of the country.
Beginning then with the south coast: the shores of the Solent,
Southampton Water, and Portsmouth Harbour have been re-examined
by Mr. Scott Taylor, r.n., in order to insert the several changes
that have been caused by the progress of the nation and the require-
ments of trade during the last sixteen years, when the former
survey was made. Questions, too, connected with deep-water
docks, and the extension of Portsmouth Harbour, have led to a
? .?9 f J, hese we have t0 also the loss of Robert Armstrong, Esq.; David
Baillie, l Esq.; David Barclay, Esq.; Rev. Fred, Bliss ;H, M. Chadwick, Esq.; Cant.
David Spiritt Cooper; Major-General Thos. Dickenson; Dr, Christopher Elliot ?
William Francis Gamul Farmer; William Henry Fitton, m.d. ; William Gaussen?
Esq.; John Robert Godley, Esq.; Sir J. R. G. Graham, Bart.; Major-General
George Judd Harding; Lord Herbert of Lee ; Mathew Edward Hoare, Esq ?
Edward B. Lawrence, Esq.; Charles Lee, Esq,; E. Magrath, Esq.; Major J A.
Moore; R. Denby Wodifield.
' t Rear-Admiral J. Washington, Hydrographer,


critical examination of tho early surveys of this region?and
apparently the depth of water on Portsmouth Bar is found to he
precisely the same.
In the Channel Islands Mr. Eichards, r.n., is continuing his
re-examination, and, by patiently struggling against the rapid tides
that prevail around that group, has succeeded in discovering many
small rocks which might have wrecked a vessel. On the coast of
Devon Captain Stokes, r.n., with his staff, has completed the survey
of the Yealm Eiver and the soundings in Bigbury Bay; and the
chart of Plymouth Sound by Commander Cox, on the scale of 6
inches to a mile, has been published. In the Scilly Isles Captain
George Williams has made much progress in the re-examination
of that intricate group. In the Bristol Channel Commander
Alldridge has continued the survey of the coast of Glamorganshire,
and sounded over 180 square miles of ground ; while Mr. Calver,
r.n., with his staff, on the east coast, has continued the survey of
the upper part of the Humber from Hull to Goole, has re-examined
the eastern gatway leading into Yarmouth Koads, and the Shingles
channel at the mouth of the Thames.
Scotland. ?-In Argyllshire Commander Bedford and his staff have
surveyed 14 miles of the open north-west coast of Mull, and 9 miles
of Loch Linnhe, with 76 miles of the shores of Loch Awe, besides
sounding over an area of 60 miles. Captain Otter and staff have
surveyed Loch Lomond, the Sound of Barra in the Hebrides, a
portion of the Isles of Harris and Benbecula, and a part of Eum ;
while Mr. Jeffery has brought to a close the survey of the coast of
Inverness-shire.
Ireland. ?On the east coast of Ireland Mr. Hoskyn has been
engaged on the upper part of Lough Strangford and on the coast of
Down, and has sounded over an area of 65 miles. On the south
coast Commander Edye has filled up the off-shore soundings that
were wanting in our charts over an area of 1200 square miles ; he
has also sounded an area of 800 miles on the north coast. A general
chart of the west coast of Ireland, on the scale of two-tenths of
an inch to a mile, with numerous small plans, has been published
by the Admiralty during the past year; as also Dingle and Yentry
harbours and Blasket Sound, and the outlying fishing-bank and
almost inaccessible islet of Eockall.
Mediterranean. ?While carefully sounding the bottom and pioneer-
ing the way for the electric submarine cable between Malta and
Alexandria, Captain Spratt, with his staff, in the Medina, has taken


advantage of the opportunity afforded to re-examine the north coast
of Africa hy Cyrenaica, and to correct its outline; also to make
plans of the roadsteads of Tripoli, Benghazi, &c. One of the first
uses to which the submarine telegraph was put was to determine the
meridian distance between Malta and Alexandria. This has been
successfully accomplished by Captains Spratt and Mansell; and
the result of these measurements gives 16� 6' 3" as the difference,
or 29� 51' 42" as the longitude of the lighthouse at Alexandria; this
determination differs only 14" from that already obtained by chrono-
metric measurements. On the coast of Syria Commander Mansell and
his staff have completed a second sheet of the coast from Markab to
Cape Bianco, and connected with it several important points in the
interior, as Ba?albek, Hermon, Jibbel, Sunm'n, and others.
The charts connected with the Mediterranean which have been
published during the past year are as follows :?Yaletta Harbour,
Malta, on the scale of 11 inches to a mile; Ehodes Island, on the
scale of eight-tenths of an inch, with enlarged plans of the ports;
Scarpanto and Casso islands, on the scale of 1 inch; the western
portion of Crete, on the scale of half an inch, with views and plans
of ports, completing the survey of this rich and beautiful island;
Euripo Strait, in Greece, on the scale of 3 inches; and a general
chart of the Delta of the Danube, on half an inch, with the Sulina
mouth of that river, showing the increased depth that has been
gained over the bar by the recent works which have been carried
out by the International Commission.
Africa. ?On the west coast of Africa the river Yolta has been
explored as far as the first rapids at about 50 miles from its mouth,
the Ogun for 40 miles from Lagos to within 4 miles of Abeokiita,
and the St. Nicholas and Brass branches for 25 miles from the sea;
and the sketch-map of each has been published at the Admiralty.
In the Cape Colony Mr. Francis Skead, k.n., is engaged on the
coast near Hout Bay. In the early part of the year he accompanied
Mr. May, n.x., in Dr. Livingstone?s new steamer to the Zambesi,
made an improved sketch of the five mouths of that river, and
more correctly determined their position, while Mr. May proceeded
with Dr. Livingstone and Bishop Mackenzie to the river Eovuma,
and explored it for 30 miles from its mouth, which was as far as the
falling water would allow them to ascend : the sketch of this river,
on the scale of 1 inch to a mile, has been published. In the Bed
Sea a plan of Dissee Island and harbour, and Commander Mansell?s
re-survey of the Strait of Jubal, with the Ashraffi Eeef and islet, have


been engraved; and it is gratifying to be enabled to add that the
intelligent Viceroy of Egypt, His Highness Said Pasha, has caused
three lights to be established to facilitate the navigation of that
narrow sea?one on Zafarana Point, already lighted ; one on the
Ashraffi Reef, at the southern entrance of the Gulf of Suez, which
will be lighted shortly; and a third on the Dsedalus Reef, which is
to be lighted towards the close of the year.
Asia. ?The chart of the Persian Gulf, to which I referred last
year, by Commander Constable and Lieutenant Stiffe, of Her
Majesty?s Indian Navy, has been published at the Admiralty in
two sheets, on the scale of a quarter of an inch to a mile, with plans
of several small ports and various views of headlands: it is accom-
panied by a memorandum on the former charts of this gulf, with a
table of positions; and the Sailing Directions are far advanced in
printing. The whole work is highly creditable to the surveying
officers of the Indian Navy ; and the chart is one of those selected
to be sent as a specimen to the International Exhibition. A plan
of Bahrein has also been completed by Lieutenant "Whisk.
In India a gap in the Malabar coast?Thullknob to Borin pagoda
?has recently been filled up by Lieut. Williams, i.n. j and thus
the whole of the west coast of the peninsula south of Bombay has
been surveyed. Lieut. Taylor, i.n., is engaged in writing the
Sailing Directions from Cape Comorin to the entrance of the Persian
Gulf; while Lieut. Ward is making progress with those on the
south coast of Arabia from Eas al Had to Bab el Mandeb, including
Sokotra and the Gulf of Aden. There still remain some portions
of this eastern region which it would be highly desirable to exa-
mine ; and it is understood that the Secretary of State for India in
Council has decided that the work shall be done; and I believe
that it may help to advance the cause of geography by giving a
brief summary of these gaps, coupled with the expression of the
wish of the Geographical Society that an early opportunity may
offer for their being filled up. They are as follows : ?l. The coast
of Malacca from the Sakshan River to Pulo Penang, about 300 miles.
2. Coast of Orissa from Santapilly Rocks to Point Palmyras, about
the same distance. 3. The coast from Chittagong to Akyab, at the
head of the Bay of Bengal. 4. The re-examination of the group of
the Andaman Isles. 5. The west coast of India from Bombay
northwards to Dami, about 100 miles. 6. Bombay Harbour on a
large scale, so as to admit of docks and other engineering works
being planned upon it. 7. The Batnah coast from Maskat to the


entrance of the Persian Gulf, 250 miles. 8. The coast of Africa
from Eas Bir to the entrance of the Eed Sea, 15 miles. 9. A series
of chronometric measurements throughout the Bay of Bengal and to
Singapore. 10. A similar series from Bombay westwards to Suez
and to the outlying islands in the Indian Ocean.
These two last can only he well done by a vessel specially de-
voted to the service, carrying a hatch of at least thirteen chrono-
meters. There is no work that could be undertaken that would
place the hydrography of those seas on a firmer basis than the
measurements last named; and I believe that Ido but give utter-
ance to the hearty desire of this Society in expressing a wish that,
before the accomplished surveyors of the Indian Navy are dispersed
abroad, Her Majesty?s Secretary of State for India, than whom no
one knows better the value of accurate geographical information,
may be pleased to set this seal to the labours of Eoss, Horsburgh,
Moresby, Elwon, Grieve, Haines, Ethersey, and other officers of
the Indian Navy, who, during the past half-century, have patiently
borne the toil and heat of the day to furnish the mariner with charts
by which he may with safety navigate those Eastern seas.
In the Banka and Gaspar Straits, and near Linga, Mr. Stanton,
E.N., in H.M.S. Saracen , has materially corrected our charts during
the past year. It may serve to show our ignorance of the geo-
graphy of these regions in the middle of the nineteenth century,
when I state that the populous town of Palambang, in Sumatra,
was found to be 14 miles in error in latitude in all our best maps
and charts, being placed that much too far to the south. A chart
of Singapore, by Mr. John Eichards, e.x., has recently been pub-
lished by the Admiralty on the scale of 12 inches to a mile ; it
shows at a glance the docks, coal-wharfs, and other accommodation
at that flourishing entrepot of the trade of the East.
China and Japan. ?One hundred and twenty miles of the upper
part of the Yang-tsze-Kiang above Han-kow have been explored as
far as Yo-chow-foo, at the entrance of the Tung-ting Lake, about 500
miles above Nan-king, during the past year. In addition to this
service, Captain Ward in the Actceon, and Lieut. Bullock in the
Dove , have been employed on the southern coast of Japan. In the
mean time some of the results of their labours of former years have
recently been published by the A.dmiralty?as Port Adams in the
Gulf of Pe-chi-li ; the Liau Eiver up to Niu-chwang, one of the trading
ports under the treaty; Chi-fu or Yen-tai harbour; Talien-whan Bay,
Wei-hai-wei and Lung-mun harbours; Hai-yun Island, containing
YOL. XXXII. ? i


Thornton Haven, Pe-chi-li Strait,'and a general chart of the Gulfs of
Pe-chi-li and Liau-tung. The Actoeon has just arrived in England,
after five years? absence in the China Seas, during which very mate-
rial additions have been made by her officers and crew to our know-
ledge of the coast, rivers, and outlying islands of China and Japan.
Australia. ?Allusion was made in the Address from the Chair of
last year to the wise liberality of the Australian colonies in sharing
with the Admiralty the expenses of an organised system of coast
surveys. Parties, under the command, respectively, of Commanders
Sidney, Cox, Hutchison, Lieut, Brooker, and Mr. J. Jeffreys of
the Royal Navy, are now established in New South Wales, Victoria,
South Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland; detailed plans of
places locally important have been received, and the steady progress
of an efficient examination of the extensive lines of seaboard of the
several provinces may now be confidently anticipated.
To keep pace with the rapid extension of colonization on the
shores of the intertropical part of the east coast, a series of charts
to connect with the detailed surveys of the late Captains Owen
Stanley and Blackwood (which extended from Torres Strait to
18i� south), are in the course of construction, compiled from the
detached and partial examinations of our naval surveyors from the
time of Cook to the present date, to be eventually connected, it is
to be hoped, by the rising generation.
Charts of the Coral Sea, embracing on a small scale all these
coast features, and giving the recent surveys of Captain Denham,
r.n,, have been published, and prove a great boon to the navigator.
The labours of this officer in the Australian seas, extending over
nine years? service, deserve more than a passing notice; but, limited
necessarily in this Address in time and space, a summary of the
more salient statistical features can alone be given. 200 sheets, as
I am informed, of charts, plans, and drawings, are completed and
in progress; 163 positions catalogued; the variation of the compass
tested afloat 2410 times, and 191 times on shore; 41 islands and
42 ocean reefs and sunken shoals surveyed; 700 miles of edge of
soundings contoured; and 23 fabulous dangers erased from the
charts.
The most favourable accounts, have been received of the security
of the passage through Torres Strait by the great north-east channel;
and the testimony appears to bo overwhelming in its favour com-
pared with those by Eaine Islet and the numerous treacherous
openings through the barrier reefs near the 12th parallel of


Admiralty Surveys. ? Vancouver Island?Newfoundland, cxvix
south latitude. The merchant-ship Castilian, drawing 20 feet, has
recently made two voyages through the north-east channel in
sixteen hours. We cannot here forbear paying a passing tribute
to the valued labours of the late Captain Francis Blackwood, e.n,,
who so successfully and clearly defined this remarkable and valu-
able channel.
A general chart of Australia in two sheets, with the adjacent
islands and seas between its northern coast and the equator, has also
been completed during the past year. The authorities and materials
for this chart have been most extensive; in addition to the well-
known names of Flinders, King, Wickham, Stokes, Stanley, Black-
wood, Yule, and Denham, the recently-published Dutch charts of
the Arafura, Banda, and Java seas have been consulted, and the
northern coast of New Guinea, the shores of New Ireland and New
Britain, as resulting from various French surveys extending over
half a century, connected by the more recent chronometric measure-
ments of Sir E. Belcher?the whole chart being thus reduced to the
common meridian of Fort Macquarie, Sydney, New South Wales.
Vancouver Island. ?Crossing the Pacific Ocean to the thriving
colony of British Columbia, we find that Captain George Eichards,
in H.M.S. Hecate, with his staff of assistants, has surveyed 700
miles, much of it open sea-coast or the exposed entrances of the
great sounds on the west side of Vancouver Island; during which
time the party thoroughly sounded over an area of 400 square
miles in Barclay and Clayoquot or Clakkot sounds, and more gene-
rally over 1400 miles off the entrance to Fuca Strait. In the course
of the past year plans have been published at the Admiralty of
Esquimalt and Victoria harbours, on the large scale of 10 inches to
the mile; of Haro Strait and Middle Channel, on the scale of one
inch; and Sailing Directions generally for the straits, harbours, and
rivers of this district.
Newfoundland. ?The re-examination of the south coast of New-
foundland, under Captain Orlebar and his assistants, has made good
progress during the past season, in the course of which 200 miles
of sea and harbour coast-line have been mapped in six large sheets,
generally on the scale of 3 inches to a mile. At the same time,
plans of Placentia Harbour, Port Basque, and St. Pierre Island, on
the same scale, have been published, as well as Pope and Tangier
harbours in Nova Scotia?the latter place becoming of importance
on account of the immediate vicinity of the gold-diggings which
have been discovered.


Bay of Fundy. ?The tedious survey of this hay of fogs and rapid
tides is at length complete, and Captain Shortland and his staff
have moved on to the south-eastern part of the coast of Nova Scotia.
In the course of the past season they have mapped 27 miles of open
coast and 154 miles of harbour and river shore-line, sounding over
an area of 260 square miles. On this eastern coast of America the
unhappy civil war, and the uncertain state of political affairs, has
led to the publication of forty-two sheets of the several charts and
plans taken from the admirable United States Coast Survey, with
the Sailing Directions that accompany them.
West Indies. ?The survey of the group of the Grenadines has been
completed by Mr. Parsons, R.N., and his assistants, and they are now
moving on to the island of Sta. Lucia and the port of Castries. In
the course of the year they have mapped 45 miles of coast-line, and
sounded over an area of 310 square miles. The chart of Grenada,
on the scale of one inch, and the plan of St. George Harbour, on the
scale of 20 inches, have been published. Also, in Texas, plans of
the entrances of Eio Grande and Brazos Eiver, with the San Luis,
Aransas, and Sabine passes.
Variation of the Compass. ?Eesulting from the investigations that
have been in progress for some time past (which have been alluded
to in former Addresses) by Mr. Frederick J. Evans, r.n., f.r.g.s.,
Superintendent of the Compass Department of the Admiralty, and
Mr. Archibald Smith, whose gratuitous labours in this cause
are beyond all praise, a Manual embracing ample practical and
theoretical rules for ascertaining and applying the deviation of the
compass in ships is on the eve of publication. This Manual has
appended to it charts of the lines of equal variation, dip, and hori-
zontal force, by the examination of which the seaman may become
familiar with the distribution of these elements, so important as a
correlative branch of science to that of navigation under the great
impending changes in naval architecture. It is a gratifying feature
that these researches should have preceded the sudden demand for
a new order of iron war-ships. In connexion with this subject,
Mr. Burdwood, R.N., of the Hydrographic Office, has computed and
published Tables of the sun?s true bearing or azimuth for the
parallels of 49� and 50� N., which will enable the mariner at once
to determine the amount of variation and local deviation combined
by a simple compass-bearing of the sun either in the morning or
the evening?thus affording a constant check to the ever-changing
deviation in an iron ship, according to whether she heels to star-


"board or port, which in many cases is an unsuspected source of
danger.
Besides the surveys above enumerated as in progress in different
parts of the world, the labours of the Hydrographic Office during
the past year have consisted in the publication, under the imme-
diate superintendence of Captain George A. Bedford, e.n., Assistant
Hydrographer, of about ninety new and corrected charts and plans,
some of which I have already mentioned. There have also been
published the usual Tide Tables for two thousand places on the
face of the globe, Light and Hydrographic Notices acquainting the
mariner at once with the slighest change or discovery of rock or
shoal that can affect the safety of navigation. Mr. Michael Walker,
too, has taken advantage of the leisure afforded by his retirement
from office, and has examined and corrected about five hundred of
the Maritime Positions, chiefly in the Eastern seas, recently pub-
lished in the 7th edition of Eaper?s ? Practice of Navigation.?
Ordnance Survey.*
The publication of ? The Trigonometrical Survey of the United
Kingdom? is now completed, and is comprised in seven quarto
volumes, viz. :
I. The Principal Triangulation, with the Figure, Dimensions, and
Mean Specific Gravity of the Earth derived therefrom, 2 vols.
11. Levelling, taken in Ireland, 1 vol.
111. Levelling, taken in England and Wales, 2 vols.
IY. Levelling, taken in Scotland, 2 vols.
Thus this great work, which was commenced in 1783, under
General Roy, r.e., is at length finished.
In last year?s estimates the sum of 1000 Z. was taken to enable the
director of the survey to extend the triangulation of England through
France to the frontiers of Belgium, so as to form a connection be-
tween the triaugulations of England and Belgium. This operation
has been completed. The stations selected to form the connexion
across the Channel were St. Peter?s Church, between Margate and
Ramsgate; Coldham, on the high ground north of Folkestone; and
Fairlight, a few miles north of Hastings. From these three stations
observations were taken to the church at Gravelines, to Mont Couple,
near Wissant, and Mont Lambert, near Boulogne.
* Colonel Sir Henry Janies, r.e., Superintendent of the Ordnance Surrey.


From these three last-named stations a station raised 74 feet above
the level of the ground at Harlettes, between Boulogne and St. Omer,
was observed, and then the churches at Cassel and Dunkirk, and then
the station at Mont Kemmel, near Ypres, in Belgium. The triangle,
Dunkirk, Cassel, and Mont Kemmel, is common to the triangulations
of France and Belgium, and is now also made part of the extended
triangulation of this country, and the lengths of its sides will there-
fore he independently determined by the geometricians of the three
countries from the measured bases in the three countries, and a
comparison of the results will be highly interesting; but the French
officers who were ordered to observe at the same stations that ours
observed at, not having been able last year to take the observations
across the Channel, the comparison cannot yet be made. They have
now, however, returned to this country to recommence their work,
and it is to be hoped they will be able to finish it this summer.
During last year the Belgian geometricians were engaged in con-
necting their triangulation with that of Prussia, and the Prussians
in connecting theirs with that of Russia; and thus we shall shortly
have a connected triangulation, extending from the west of Ireland
to the Oural Mountains, and the means of computing the length of
an arc of parallel of about 75� in length.
The electric telegraph now furnishes the means by which the
difference of longitude between distant places can be determined
with greater precision than they could formerly be by the trans-
mission of chronometers from one station to another.
The Astronomer Eoyal will therefore this year re-determine the
difference of longitude between Yalentia, in the s.w. of Ireland,
and the observatory at Greenwich, by means of the electric tele-
graph ; and as it will be necessary for the director of the survey to
connect the station selected by the Astronomer Eoyal at Yalentia
with the triangulation of the kingdom, a joint expedition is now
about to proceed to Yalentia for this double purpose, and to com-
plete the quota of work assigned to us for the measurement of this
great arc of parallel.
The engraving of the complete map of Ireland in outline, on the
scale of one inch to a mile, was finished last year, and the hill
features are now being engraved. There are 205 sheets in this
map.
The prc )gress of the Cadastral Survey in the north of England and
Scotland has been greatly retarded in consequence of the very
numerous and extensive surveys which have been made by the


Ordnance in the south of England for purposes connected with the
defences of the kingdom.
But as all these have been made on the scales adopted for the
National Survey, and the plans have been drawn as so many
sheets of a?complete survey of the counties to which the places
belong, they will form a part of the Cadastral Survey of England
and Wales, should such a measure be decided on; and as the com-
mittee of the House of Commons, of which Lord Bury was chair-
man, which was appointed last year to report upon ? the expediency
of extending the Cadastral Survey to those portions of the United
Kingdom which have been surveyed upon the scale of one inch to a
mile only,? have reported in favour of it, the cost of the surveys
made for the defences will go to diminish the cost of the Cadastral
Survey.
In the north of England, Yorkshire and Lancashire have been
published on the 6-inch scale; Westmoreland and Durham on the
25-inch scale; and the survey is in progress in Northumberland
and Cumberland. A large portion of each of these counties has
already been published, and they will be finished this year. The
last sheets of the 1-inch map of England and Wales are in the hands
of the engravers; we may, therefore, expect that this map, which
was begun in 1784, will now be soon finished. In Scotland all the
southern counties have been published either on the 25-inch or
6-inch scales; and the counties of Forfar, Perth, Stirling, and Dum-
barton are in course of publication ; and the survey is proceeding in
Perthshire, Kincardineshire, and Buteshire. The one-inch map of
Scotland is also in course of publication.
The plans of the eight northern counties of Ireland have been
revised and made perfect in every detail, like the plans of the
southern counties. This perfect revision was rendered necessary to
enable the Government valuators to mark upon the plans every pro-
perty and tenement; and this has now been done throughout the
whole of Ireland. The Ordnance plans are now invariably used for
the transfer of land under the Landed Estates Court, the cost of pre-
paring the plans for the court being charged to the carriage of the sale
of the property ; and the same arrangement will doubtless be intro-
duced here as soon as some progress is made in the Cadastral Survey.
Sir Henry James has this year published six sheets of the Mar-
ginal Lines for the sheets of a map of the whole world, on the scale
of 2 inches to a mile; the object in view being to have a map con-
structed on the largest scale required for geographical purposes, the


sheets of which can he put together to form a connected map of any
part of the world, however large or however small; and to avoid
the confusion arising when we attempt to put together maps of
different countries, as they are now constructed on different scales
and on different projections.
This is a great undertaking, and one which will require the co-
operation of a great number of people and some years to accomplish ;
but the advantages to be derived from having such a grand map of
the world are obvious; and it is right that the topographical depart-
ment of such a country as ours should undertake to make it.
In a discussion upon the relative merits of several projections for
large portions of the earth?s surface which has been published in the
last number of the ? Philosophical Magazine,? it has been demon-
strated, that, assuming the errors which all projections of a spheri-
cal surface on a plane must necessarily have, viz., distortion in form
and distortion in area, are equally objectionable, the distance of the
point of projection adopted by Sir Henry James in his geometrical
projection of two-thirds of the sphere, will, for the projection of a
hemisphere, give the least possible distortion of form and area, and
that the misrepresentation will be a minimum. If we draw a
circle and two diameters in it at right angles to each other, one may
be taken to represent the plane of projection for the concave
hemisphere above it, and the point of sight or projection is at the
distance of half the radius in the prolongation of the other beyond
its circle. It is now demonstrated that this is the best possible
projection for a hemisphere, and it should therefore be adopted by
all geographers.
Meteorology.*
In Meteorology some degree of increased interest has been caused
by various discussions and publications, besides an organised system
of forecasting weather and giving cautionary notice of expected
storms.
In treating so complicated and extensive a subject as that of our
atmosphere and its movements, it is extremely difficult to combine
mathematical exactness with the results of experience obtained by
practical ocular observation and much reflection; but to some extent
this has been effected recently, the Board of Trade having arranged
telegraphic and frequent communication between widely-separated
? Admiral Fitz�oy, Director of the Meteorological Department, Board of Trade.


stations and a central office in London ; by which a means of
feeling ?indeed one may say mentally seeing ?successive simultaneous
states of the atmosphere over the greater extent of pur islands is
established ; and an insight into its dynamical laws has been thus
obtained, to which each passing month has added elucidation and
value.
Possibly at this time, when extensions of our arrangements to
the Continent are contemplated in France, in Hanover, and in
Prussia (although here there are still persons who doubt, if they
do not entirely disbelieve their utility), it may be desirable to cir-
culate an explicit description of the basis, and the nature, of those
forecasts and occasional warnings, which have been proved during
the past year.
The first cautionary or storm-warning signals were made in
February, 1861; since which time similar warnings have been
given, as occasions needed.
In August, 1861, the first published ?forecasts? of weather were
tried; and after another half-year had elapsed for gaining experience
by varied tentative arrangements, the present system was established.
Twenty reports are now received each morning (except Sundays),
and ten each afternoon, besides five from the Continent. Double
forecasts (two days in advance) are published, with the full tables
(on which they chiefly depend), and are sent to six daily papers, to
one weekly, to Lloyds?, to the Admiralty, and to the Horse Guards,
besides the Board of Trade.
These forecasts add almost nothing to the pecuniary expense of
the system, while their usefulness practically is said to be more
and more recognised.* Warnings of storms arise out of them, and
(scarcely enough considered) the satisfaction of knowing that no
very bad weather is imminent may be very great to a person about
to cross the sea. Thus their negative evidence may be actually
little less valuable than the positive.
Prophecies or predictions they are not: the term forecast is strictly
applicable to such an opinion as is the result of a scientific combina-
tion and calculation, liable to be occasionally, though rarely, marred
by an unexpected ? downrush ? | of southerly wind, or by a rapid
* At a recent meeting of the Shareholders of the Great Western Docks at
Stonehouse, Plymouth, it was stated officially that ?the deficiency (in revenue) is
to be attributed chiefly to the absence of vessels requiring the use of the graving-
docks for the purpose of repairing the damages occasioned by storms and casu-
alties at sea.?

electrical action not yet sufficiently indicated to our extremely
limited sight and feeling. We shall know more and more by degrees.
At present it is satisfactory to know that the measures practised
daily in these proceedings do not depend solely on one individual:
they are the results of facts exactly recorded, and deductions from
their consideration, for which rules have been given. An assistant
is able to share their responsibility now, and others are advancing
in the subject of dynamical meteorology.
In order to enable the reader to judge of the basis on which
rules for forecasting probable weather are founded, some degree
of explanation may here be offered?as the method is new in
its combinations, although depending on old or well-known prin-
ciples.
Air-currents sometimes flow side by side, though in opposite direc-
tions, as ? parallel streams,? for hundreds or even thousands of miles.
Sometimes they are more or less superposed; occasionally, indeed
frequently, crossing at various angles ; sometimes combining, and by
the composition of their forces and qualities causing those varieties of
weather that ai - e experienced as the wind veers more toward or from
the equator or the nearest pole; and sometimes so antagonistic in
their angular collision as to cause those large circular eddies or
rotatory storms, called cyclones, which are really like the greater
storms in all parts of the world, although they do not quite assimilate
to local whirlwinds, dust-storms, and other commotions of atmos-
phere, which seem to be more electrical in their characteristics, if
not in their origin.
Whenever a polar current prevails at any place, or is approaching,
the air becomes heavier, and the barometer high, or rising. When
the opposite (equatorial or tropical) prevails or approaches, the
mercury is low or falls, because the air is, or is becoming, specifically
lighter, and these changes take place slowly. Whenever, from any
causes ?electrical, chemical, or simply mechanical?either current,
or any combination of currents, ceases to press onwards without
being opposed, a gradual lightening of the atmosphere, through a
greater or less area of hundreds or perhaps thousands of miles
occurs, not suddenly, but very gradually, and the barometer falls :
there is less tension.
To restore equilibrium, the nearest disposable body of air (so to
speak), or most moveable, advances first; but an impulse at the
same time may be given to other and greater masses that?though
later in arriving?may be stronger, last longer, and cause greater'


pressure, mechanically as well as by combination. Air, like water,
mingles slowly, either from above or laterally.
Taking, with Dove, north-east and south-west (true).as the ? wind-
poles,? all intermediate directions are found to be more or less
assimilated to the characteristics of those extremes, as they are
nearer one or other; while all the variations of pressure or tension,
many of those caused by temperature, and all varieties of winds, may
be clearly and directly traced to the operations of two constant prin-
cipal currents ?equatorial or tropical, and polar?our north-east
and south-west.
It has been proved that storms?indeed all the greater circulations
of atmosphere in the zone between the tropics and polar regions?
have an eastward motion bodily, while circulating around a centrical
area. Within the tropics it is otherwise, or westward, ?till they
recurve, moving first toward the nearer pole, direct, and then eastward,
with more or less direction toward the same pole.
Clear distinction should be made between those ever alternate
and often conflicting main currents ?tropical or polar, and the local
effects of their union or antagonism, namely, mixed winds?whether
westerly or easterly, with occasional eddies, or cyclones, on a larger
or on a smaller scale.
The lower current does not ordinarily extend far upward (only
some few thousand yards), and highlands, mountains, especially
ranges of mountains, alter and impede its progress, so that a variety
of eddy winds, or streams of wind, with local and apparently ano-
malous effects, are frequently caused.
Heat, electrical action, or cold; condensation of vapour into hail,
snow, rain, or fog; or its other changes, namely, evaporation, rarol-
faction, and expansion?absorbing heat, and therefore causing cold
?immediately cause currents of air, in a degree proportional to
such influence; inducing horizontal motion and dynamical force.
The polar current always advances from the polar quarter while
laterally moving eastward (like a ship making lee-way), being pressed
towards the east by the tropical flow which advances from the south-
westward, usually above and at an angle with the polar stream or
current of air, often mixing with it, but at times separately pene-
trating downward, then sweeping and warming the earth?s surface,
uncombined with the polar current even while feeling its ap-
proaching influence, and thus, as it were, forcing passages between
streams of chilling polar air that at the same time are moving in
opposite and nearly parallel directions.


At times, after a continuance of tropical air-current, or during its
general prevalence, a polar flow or separate stream of air (electric,
cold, dry, and of greater pressure or tension than the prevailing
body of air then next the earth) passes above, chilling and other-
wise influencing the lower air through which, at some places, it
penetrates completely.
These movements of air-currents are shown by clouds crossing
the heavenly bodies, by the visible characteristics of those clouds,
and by simultaneous observations of temperature, tension, force of
wind, and its true direction, at many places.
It is very interesting as well as practically useful to mark how
these inroads or mixtures of air-currents occur, and to note their
beginnings or endings at a few places considerably separated; such,
for instance, as Copenhagen and Lisbon, Galway and Heligoland,
Jersey and Aberdeen, Queenstown (or Yalentia) and Berwick or
Yarmouth, with intermediate places. But this special feature may
be better referred to after a few other considerations have been
submitted as preliminary.
Dynamical force, pressure of air in motion, is generated by dis-
turbed equilibrium, whether electrically by heat or cold, mechanic-
ally by aqueous expansion into gas, by contraction into rain, snow,
or ice, or by previously induced action of air-currents among them-
selves, with their inertia.
Hence it follows that no great disturbance of equable temperature,
tension, dryness, or moisture, can occur without a proportionate
dynamical force, tending to cause currents of air, or wind, however
resisted, deflected, or otherwise affected by similar and simultaneous
actions, more or less in opposition or in combination.
Sometimes their opposition is so equal, and equilibrium is so
complete, that a calm is the result, no sensible movement horizon-
tally along the earth?s surface being perceptible.
Frequently combination occurs, and dynamical effects are pro-
duced in proportion. These are particularly evident in the meetings
of tropical and polar winds (by the west), by their subsequent con-
tinuance in strength as mixed winds, and by the concurrence or
combination of cyclones.
Successive, or rather consecutive, gyrations, circuits, or cyclones,
often affect one another, acting as temporary mutual checks, until a
combination and joint action occurs; their union causing then
much greater effects, as may be seen even in water-currents as well
as in the atmosphere itself ,


Between the tropics and the polar regions, or in temperate zones,
the main currents are incessantly active, while more or less antago-
nistic, from the causes above mentioned ; besides which, wherever*
considerable changes of temperature, development of electricity,
heavy rain, or these in combination, cause temporary disturbance of
atmospheric equilibrium (or a much altered tension of air), those
grand agents of nature, the two great currents, speedily move by
the least resisting lines to restore equilibrium, or fill the comparative
void. One current arrives, probably, or acts, sooner than the other;
but invariably collision occurs of some kind or degree, usually occa-
sioning a circuit, a cyclonic (or ellipsonic) gyration, however little
noticed when gentle or moderate in force.
As there must be resistance to moving air (or a conflict of currents)
to cause gyration, and as there are no such causes on a large scale
near the equator, there are no storms (except local squalls) in very
low latitudes.
It is at some distance, from about 5� to 20�, from the equator that
hurricanes are occasionally felt in their violence. They originate
in or near those hot and densely-clouded spaces, sometimes spoken
of as the ? cloud-ring ,? where aggregated aqueous vapour is at times
condensed into heavy rain (partly with vivid electrical action), and
a comparative vacuum is suddenly caused, towards which air rushes
from all sides. That which arrives from a higher latitude has a
westwardly, that from a lower an eastwardly, tendency, due to the
earth?s rotation and to the change of latitude, whence a chief
cause of the cyclone?s invariable rotation in one direction, as above
explained.
The hurricane, or cyclone, is impelled to the west in low latitudes,
because the tendency of both currents there is to the westward along
the surface, although one?the tropical?is much less so, and be-
comes actually easterly near the tropic, after which its equatorial
centrifugal force is more and more evident, while the westwardly
tendency of the polar current diminishes; and, therefore, at that
latitude hurricane cyclones cease to move westward (recurve), go
then easterly, and on toward the polar quarter.
Great and important changes of weather and wind are preceded
as well as accompanied, by notable alterations in the state of the
atmosphere.
Such changes, being indicated at some places sooner than at others
around the British islands, give frequent premonitions; and there-
fore great differences of pressure (or tension) shown by barometer, of


temperature, of dryness or moisture, and direction of wind, should
be considered as signs of changes likely to occur soon.
It will be observed, on any continued comparison of weather
reports, that during the stronger winds a far greater degree of uni-
formity and regularity is shown than during the prevalence of
moderate or light breezes ; and this should be remembered in fore-
casting weather.
When neither of the greater and more extensive atmospheric
currents is sweeping across the British islands (currents of which
the causes are remote, and on a large scale), the nature or character
of our winds approaches, and is rather like that of land and sea
breezes in low latitudes, especially in summer.
Either the cooler sea-wind is drawn in over land heated by the
summer sun, or cold air from frosty heights, snow-covered land, or
Chilly valleys, moves towards the sea, which is so uniform in tempe-
rature for many weeks together, changing so slowly and but little, in
comparison with land, during the year. These light variables may
at such times be numerous, simultaneously, around the compass on
the various coasts of the British islands.
Frequently it has been asked, ? In this country, how much rise
or fall of the glasses may foretell remarkable change or a dangerous
storm ? ? To which can now be replied, ? Great changes or storms
are usually shown by falls of barometer exceeding half an inch, and
by differences of temperature exceeding about fifteen degrees.
Nearly a tenth of an inch an hour is a fall presaging a storm or
very heavy rain. The more rapidly such changes occur, the more
risk there is of dangerous atmospheric commotion,?
As all barometric instruments often, if not usually, show what
may be expected, a day or even days in advance, rather than the
weather of the present or ne.xt few hours; and as wind, or its
direction, affects them much more than rain or snow, due allowance
should always be made for days as well as for hours to come.
The general effect of storms is felt unequally in these islands, and
less inland than on our coasts. Wind is diminished or checked by
its passage over land. The mountain ranges of Wales or Scotland,
rising two to four thousand feet above the ocean level, have great
power to alter the direction and probably the velocity of wind,
independently of alterations caused by changes of temperature at
elevations.
Extensive changes, showing differences of pressure above or
below the normal or mean level, amounting to nearly an inch, or


thereabouts, are certain to be followed by a marked commotion of
the elements in the course of a few days. If the fall has been
sudden, or the rise very rapid, swift but brief will be the resulting-
elementary movement; if slow or gradual, time will elapse before
the change, and the altered state of weather will take place more
gradually, but last longer..
Notice may thus be obtained and given a few hours, or a day, or
even some days, before any important change in the weather actually
occurs.
Having such knowledge, it obviously follows that telegraphic
warning may be sent in any direction reached by the wires; and
that occasionally, on the occurrence of very ominous signs?baro-
metric and other, including always those of the heavens?such cau-
tions may be given before storms as will tend to diminish the risks
and loss of life so frequent on our exposed and tempestuous shores.
Barometers show the alterations in tension?or, so to speak, the
pulsations, on a large scale?of atmosphere ; and diagrams express to
practised observers what the ?indicator-card? of a steam-cylinder
shows to a skilful engineer.
Our own islands have very peculiar facilities for meteorological
communication by telegraph between outlying stations on the sea-
coast and a central place, all being at nearly the same level, and
nearly all comparatively uninfluenced by mountain ranges.
And now the results are, that, having daily knowledge of the
weather (including ordinary facts of a meteorological nature) at the
extreme limits and centre of our British islands, we are warned of
any great change taking place ; the greater -atmospherical changes
being measured by days rather than by hours. Only local changes,
however violent they may be occasionally (and dangerous in propor-
tion to their suddenness and violence), only those changes are unfelt
at a distance, and do not influence great breadths?such as hundreds
of miles area of atmosphere?horizontally.
Some special, and to many persons entirely new, considerations
should here be mentioned, as they are now practically valuable in
connection with forecasting weather.
When opposing currents of air meet, their masses must continue
in motion a certain time, either rotating, or ascending, or going
onward horizontally in combination.
Masses of air, either of polar or tropical origin, so to sjpeak,
returning (when driven back by stronger opposition), at first, and


for a certain time, retain the characteristics of their peculiar and
very different natures.
In our latitudes there is a continuous alternation of air-currents,
each specifically different, and denoting approach by marked
characteristics; and we have proved, by successive series of simul-
taneous statical observations over a wide range?embracing Scot-
land, Ireland, all England, and adjacent islands?that, while these
alternating or circuitously-moving currents are thus incessantly
passing, the whole body of atmosphere, filling our temperate zone,
is moving gradually towards the east , at an average rate of about
5 geographical miles an hour (from 2 to 8 miles).
During strong westerly winds this eastward motion is greatly
increased, and in easterly gales it is proportionately diminished, as
measured by its passage along a hoi?izontal surface of earth or ocean.
Knowing these circumstances, and having accurate statical
observations of these various currents at selected outlying stations,
showing pressure (or tension), temperature, and relative dryness,
with the direction and estimated horizontal force of wind at each
place simultaneously, the dynamical consequences are already measur-
able approximately on geometrical principles ; and, judging by the
past, there appears to be reasonable ground for expectation that
meteorological dynamics will be soon subjected to mathematical
analysis and accurate formulas. The facts now weighed and mea-
sured mentally?in what may be correctly called forecasting weather
?are the direction and force of air-currents or wind, reported tele-
graphically to the central station in London from many distant
stations, their respective tension and temperature, moisture or
dryness, and their changes since former recent observations.
These show whether any or either movement or change is on the
increase or decrease; whether a polar current is moving laterally
off, passing from our stations towards Europe, or approaching us
from the Atlantic; whether moving direct towards the south-west-
ward with great velocity, or with slow progress. If moving fast
in the direction of its length, it will approach England more from
the east?its speed direct being 20 to 50 or 80 miles an hour;
while its constant lateral or easterly tendency (like a ship?s leeway
in a current), being only 5 miles an hour, is then insensible to us
(though clearly deducible from other facts ascertained), and is that
muc]j in alteration of actual direction, as well as of what would
otherwise be the velocity of that polar current.


"With the opposite principal current ?the equatorial or south-
westerly, more briefly and correctly, tropical?similar but opposite
results occur. The direct motion from a south-westerly quarter is
accelerated sensibly to out; perception by part of the eastward con-
stant (about 5 miles hourly), and therefore a body of air approaches
us sooner (other things being equal) from the westward than it
does from the eastward.
To seamen accustomed to navigate in ships making leeway while
in currents setting variously over the ground, such movements,
complicated as they may appear, are familiar. There are the
ship?s headway, leeway, and drift to be considered, in combination
with the motion or current-rate of the buoyant water, and that per-
haps an upper current, differing from one beneath, while each is
passing across the bottom or bed of the sea beneath all.
But the motes circling in a beam of light across a draught of
dusty air may perhaps show what is meant by such combined and
varying motions of fluid, elastic, and mobile air, as are here men-
tioned.
One important consideration is the disposal or progress of bodies of
air united, or mixed, or contiguous to each other, after their meeting
?either directly opposed or at an angle?on the earth?s (or ocean?s)
surface. They do not vanish. They cannot go directly upwards,
against gravitation; westward they cannot (generally) go when
there is collision or meeting, because the momentum, elasticity, and
extent of the tropical ? antitrade,? * or south-wester, usually over-
powers any direct polar current, or rises ever it and more or less
affects the subordinate one below by the friction of its eastward
pressure. Downward there is no exit; eastwardly (towards the
east) the accumulating air must go, and this tendency continued
causes the varieties of wind from the westward; being more or less
mixed, more or less purely polar or tropical, as either one prevails
in combination.
After a body of air has passed and gone to some distance south-
ward or northward, it may be stopped by an advancing and more
powerful mass of atmosphere, which is moving in a direction con-
trary to or diagonally across its line of force. If their appulse be
gradual and gentle, only a check occurs, and the weaker body is
pushed back until its special qualities, respecting temperature and

moisture, are so masked by those of its opponent as to be almost
obliterated; but if these currents meet with energy at very different
temperatures and tensions, rapid changes are noticed as the wind
shifts, and circuitous eddies, storms, or cyclones occur.
Otherwise, when their meeting is, as first mentioned, gradual,
there is the return of a portion of either current (which previously
prevailed), either direct or deflected?deflected even through more
than one quadrant of a circle?by its advancing opponent, and
retaining for some considerable time its own previous charac-
teristics. Thus we have for short times cold, dry winds from the
south-west, instead of the usual warm and moist ones; or winds of
the latter kind from the north, instead of cold ones.
The circuitous tendency of air in motion, and the numerous
impediments to its horizontal progress, such as land, ranges of
mountains, hills, or even cliffs, induce many a deviation from
normal directions, extremely puzzling to the student of this
subject; but so retentive is air of its tension and temperature for a
time, that, like currents in the ocean, each may be traced by its
characteristics as long as within our insular web of stations.
When the polar current is driven back by a tropical advancing
from a southerly direction gradually, their action united becomes
south-easterly (from the south-eastward) ; and as the one or other
prevails, the wind blows more from one side of east or from the
other. Time is required to produce motion in the air?horizon-
tally?and more time is indispensable for its gradual cessation from
movement.
Statical effects are noticed at observatories, or by careful observers
anywhere, some hours or days before notable dynamical conse-
quences occur.
When a body of atmosphere is moving from or towards the pole,
its impelling force (vis a tergo) may cease; while the mass itself has
a certain impetus or momentum.
Diminishing tension then results at the place of checked energy,
and the upper current (always present) descends. At the same time
there is an alteration of tension at the farther extreme, which is
meeting and mingling with, if not resisting, checked, and deflected
by the advancing opponent.
Consequent on this an extent of air, reaching, perhaps, across
some hundred miles, becomes, as it were, isolated. Detached from
its original source and maintenance, whether polar or tropical, and
then quite surrounded by air of a different character, it is impelled


in new and varying directions, still retaining for a time more or
less of its characteristics, until altered entirely, and totally incorpo-
rated with its conqueror.
Hence we sometimes have cold tropical wind, with electrical
and other polar characteristics (for a limited time only), before the
tropical predominates; or, on the other hand, a warm polar air-
current, with tropical peculiarities.
Moreover, in addition to these causes of apparent inconsistency or
irregularity are the results of circling currents?streams of air
retaining their features, although changed, it may be even totally,
in direction along the earth?s surface; besides a variety of merely
local alterations, such as are effected by high lands, or) valleys, or
coast-lines. All these, and many other minor considerations, ought
to be familiar and present to a forecaster of weather, who would
judge comprehensively according to observed facts and ascertained
laws.
Lanarists and Astro-meteorologists support theories which, if in
accordance with facts, would affect our whole atmosphere, or a hemi-
sphere, or at least an entire zone, in a similar way, on account of the
(supposed) influencing causes acting over all the rotating earth, and
not only over Europe, or its adjacent islands.
At the Board of Trade from thirty to forty weather-telegrams are
received daily (except Sundays), and the present forecasts, or pre-
monitions of weather, are drawn up on the following arrangement.
Districts are thus assumed;?
1. Scotland.
2. Ireland, around the coasts.
3. West Central (Severn to the Solway), coastwise.
4. South-West England (from the Severn to Southampton), by
the coast.
5. South-East England (Wight to Thames)
6. East Coast (Thames to Tweed).
As newspaper space is very limited, and as some words are used
in different senses by various persons, extreme care is taken in
selecting those for such brief, general, and yet sufficiently definite
sentences as will suit the purposes satisfactorily.
Such words as are commonly found on published scales of force, or
nature of wind and weather, are generally understood, and there-
fore are used in preference to others, however apparently expressive.
In saying on any day what the probable character of the weather


will be to-morrow, or the day after, at tbe foot of a table showing
its observed nature that very morning, a limited degree of informa-
tion is offered for about two days in advance, which is as far as may
be trusted generally, on an average, though at times a longer premo-
nition might be given with sufficient accuracy to be of occasional use.
Minute or special details, such as showers at particular places, or
merely local squalls, are avoided; but the general or average cha-
racteristics, those expected to be principally prevalent (with but few
exceptions) the following day and the next after it, including the
nights (not those of the weather actually present), &re cautiously
expressed, after careful consideration. Ordinary variations of
cloudiness, or clear sky, or rain, of a local or only temporary cha-
racter, are not noticed usually.
That a broad general average or prevalence is kept in view, referring
to a day or more in advance, and to a district, rather than only to
one time or place, should be remembered by the reader.
The great practical difficulty is in separating the effect on the
mind of present states of air, weather, and clouds, from abstract
considerations of what may be expected on the morrow or next
following day.
As meteorological instruments usually foretell important changes
by at least a day, or much longer, we have to consider what wind
and weather may be expected from the morning observations, com-
pared with those of the days immediately previous, as indicative of
the morrow?s w r eather, and of the day after, at each place; to take an
average of those expectations for each district collectively, in groups;
and then to estimate the dynamical effects which may be anticipated
as the legitimate consequences of such relative tensions, tempera-
tures, and dryness, occasioning more or less inequality in the
atmospheric equilibrium, and thus causing greater or less horizontal
motions of air-currents, or ordinary winds.
Comparisons of the moist and dry thermometers are very useful, if
well observed, in telling the hygrometric condition of air; and
thence, with other facts, showing how either current prevails, or has
relative influence?a point of much importance in forecasting a
change of wind either way, as well as the probability of rainy or dry
weather. A good electrometer is not yet available at our out-
stations, however desirable such an instrument would be, in express-
ing, not only relative electrical states of air, but what, till a better
term is offered, may, perhaps, be called the polarity of our atmosphere
if not its polarisation).


Whether there is a condition, or relative position of the particles of
air, in a tropical current, differing from either in a polar current ?
analogous to the polarisation of light?and whether there is a direct
connexion between these main currents and electro-magnetic, espe-
cially those mysterious earth-currents, are questions easy to ask;
but excessively difficult to be answered, even by philosophical
physicists of the highest eminence. To such authorities, however,
the writer would appeal for some particular consideration of the
following facts :
With polar currents of air, electricity is above par, or plus; the
air is harsh, clouds in it have a hard, oily appearance, animal as well
as vegetable life is peculiarly affected in various familiar ways,
tension is above par; and all these peculiarities are constant qualities,
independent of temperature of night or day, and of the time of year.
With the opposite or tropical current, different effects are well
known to most people ; but the comparative absence of electrical
tension (or plus electricity), the soft, watery aspect of clouds in such
air, and the absence of hard edges or outlines, unless influenced in
some degree by the polar element, have not been noticed generally,
though they are properties expressive of tropical winds solely (west
to south in this hemisphere) in their (unmixed) purity.
In all frequented parts of the world, these peculiar characteristics
of the so-called easterly and westerly winds have been carefully
noticed, and found to be irrespective of locality,?land or water,
whether with an ocean to the east, or with a continent in that
direction, or the converse. It may be remarked, in passing, that
easterly winds everywhere (prevalent, not merely temporary cur-
rents), either mixed or deflected, are polar?derived more or less from
the nearest pole ; and that so-called westerly winds are tropical,
from a tropical direction, or mixed tropical and polar currents.
There is much to be remarked, in connexion with these distinctive
features, respecting atmospheric colours, clouds, auroras, and
meteors, but not admissible here.
Outline maps, with movable windmarkers, and cyclone glasses or
horns, are useful in forecasting weather ; and full consideration
should be given to the probable position, direction, extent, and
degree of progress of those centrical areas or nodes round which the
principal currents usually circulate, or turn, as they meet and alter,
combine with, or succeed one another.
Here dynamical considerations, with comprehensive comparisons


of statical facts, are most important; and to treat tliem even ap-
proximately well, with such quick despatch as is requisite, demands
aptitude and experience.
Those who are most concerned about approaching changes, who
are going to sea, or on a journey, or on a mere excursion; those who
have gardening, agricultural, or other out-door pursuits in view;
may often derive useful cautionary notices from these published
expectations of weather : although (from the nature of such subjects)
they can be but scanty, and imperfect, under present circumstances.
Objection has been taken to such forecasts, because they cannot
be always exactly correct, for all places, in one district. It is, how-
ever, considered by most persons that general, comprehensive
expressions, in aid of local observers, who can form independent
judgments from the tables and their own instruments, respecting their
immediate vicinity, though not so well for distant places, may be very
useful as well as interesting: while to an unprovided or otherwise
uninformed person, an idea of the kind of weather thought probable
cannot be otherwise than acceptable, provided that he is in no way
bound to act in accordance with any such views, against his own
judgment.
Like the storm-signals, such notices should be merely cautionary,
to denote anticipated disturbance somewhere over these islands, with-
out being in the least degree compulsory, or interfering arbitrarily
with the movements of vessels or individuals.
Certain it is, that, although our conclusions may be incorrect,
our judgment erroneous, the laws of nature and the signs afforded
to man are invariably true. Accurate interpretation is the real
deficiency.
Seamen know well the marked characteristics of the two great
divisions of wind, in all parts of the world, and do not care to
calculate the intermediate changes or combinations to two or three
points. They want to know the quarter whence a gale may be
expected?whether northerly or southerly ?in general terms.
Every seaman will admit, that however useful, and therefore
desirable, it would be to know exactly the hour of a storm?s com-
mencement?as our acquaintance with meteorology does not enable
such times to be fixed?the next best thing is to have limits assigned
for extra vigilance and due precaution, which limits are clearly
stated, in all the printed popular instructions, to be from the time of
hoisting the signal until two or three days afterwards.
But, say some, and justly?are ships to remain waiting to avoid a


gale that after all may not happen ? Are fishermen and coasters to
wait idle, and miss their opportunities ? By no means. All that the
cautionary signals imply, is ?Look out.? ?Be on your guard.?
? Notice your glasses, and the signs of the weather.? ? The atmos-
phere is much disturbed.?
Perhaps sufficient thought has not always been given to the con-
sideration of mere pecuniary loss by wear and tear, risk, accident,
delay, and demurrage, caused by a gale at sea ; balanced against the
results of waiting for a tide or two, perhaps once in two months,
when cautioned by a storm-signal.
Be this as it may with coasters, short traders, or even screw-
colliers, the question is entirely different with ordinary over-sea or
foreign-going ships; especially when starting from a southern or
from a western port. To such vessels a gale in the Channel, or
even during the first day or two after clearing the land, must
always be very prejudicial. Officers and men are mutually strange;
things are not in their places, often not secured; and the ship,
perhaps, is untried at sea. Of course, however, these remarks are
inapplicable to fine, first-class ships; and to powerful, well-managed
steamers, independent of wind and weather, which start at fixed
hours.
It is scarcely too much to say, even now, that if due attention be
paid on the coasts to cautionary signals?and, at the Central Office,
to the telegraphed reports ?no very dangerous storm need be
anticipated without more or less notice of its approach being
generally communicated around the British Islands; or to those
particular coasts which probably may be most affected by its
greatest strength.
But this hardly applies to our extreme outposts, such as Jersey,
Valencia, Nairn, and Heligoland, because their remoteness, in-
valuable as that condition is for warning other places nearer the
centre, is an obvious reason why they cannot always be forewarned
themselves.
In using the daily Weather Eeports, it ought to be kept in mind
that only one state of atmosphere in twenty-four hours is there
recorded (excepting for rainfall) ; therefore it is only by comparisons
and due reference to previous reports that probable consequences
can be fairly inferred. It is advisable, in considering the forecasts,
to look at the second as in some degree part of the first; time of
weather continuing not being a certain or reliable notice.
In conclusion, it may be impressed on the reader, that this system


is a tentative experiment. Each month, however, has hitherto added
useful facts, and increased our acquaintance with the difficult,
though not uncertain, dynamics of the subject. Nothing, however,
could have been well effected in an attempt to apply meteorology
to daily practice with confidence, had not a foundation of facts
existed in the works of scientific authorities ?whose statical re-
cords and invaluable deductions afforded a sufficiently extensive
basis on which to rely while utilising modern powers of communi-
cation by telegraph, from any stations, simultaneously.
Surveys of Spain.*
We learn from our correspondent, M. Coello, the accomplished
geographer, who is now directing the topographical survey of Spain,
that the following additions to our science have recently been made.
During the year 1861 persevering progress has been made in the
great triangulation of the country.
All the chains of the triangles of the first order have already been
studied, including those which relate to the whole circumference of
the kingdom.
The chains of the meridian of Madrid, both to the north and to
the south of that capital, have nearly all been measured, and will be
completed before the end of the present year.
The parallel of Madrid to the west has been finished as far as the
frontier of Portugal; and the measurement of the triangles of the
parallel of Ciudad Real to Badajoz has been commenced. The tri-
angles required to complete the spaces to the west of the meridian
of Madrid have been laid down as far as that of Salamanca.
The triangulation of the second order is finished for the whole
province of Madrid, as well as that for a part of the adjacent country.
We are now only waiting for the results of the last calculations for
compensation, which have just been completed, in order to fix the
length of the great base of Madridejos, and begin the long calcula-
tion of the work which has been done.
This year these different undertakings will be continued, and
signals will be fixed for the measurement of the parallel to the east of
Madrid, with the intention of making, concurrently with this work,
simultaneous and reciprocal observations to determine the geodistic
level, and settle with accuracy the elevation of Madrid above the
Mediterranean, presumed at present upon the most received existing

ment in Spain. (Translated by Dr. Hodgkin, Hon. Foreign Secretary.)


calculations to be 660 metres, which is, perhaps, within ten inches
of the truth.
The topographical labours thus undertaken in .the province of
Madrid will be continued during the year. The corresponding land
registration will at the same time be proceeded with, and the levels
will be very carefully taken.
The maps are on the scale of �f sir? f� r cities and build-
ings. The classifications, territorial valuations, and dispositions in
the public archives, will commence as soon as a portion of the pro-
vince is completed. The topography is executed with very great
accuracy.
During the past year a portion of the Tagus, and of its tributary
the Gallo, has been mapped to form a of the hydrography
of Spain.
The geological department has completed its work in the pro-
vinces of Burgos, Santander, and Madrid, and has commenced with
those of Leon, Zamora, and Avita.
In the department of Yv T oods and Forests various topographical
details have been obtained in the provinces of Santander, Burgos,
Valencia, Asturias, Oviedo, and Leon.
All these works have been executed under the direction of the
Junta-General Estadistica, which is appointed by the Government
to take charge of scientific researches regarding the Spanish
territory.
The Hydrographic Department has published various interesting
works, more especially some on the I'hilippine Islands.
The War Department has completed the itinerary of Navarre, and
published a beautiful atlas of the campaign in Africa, accompanied
with very interesting topographical documents. The itineraries of
different provinces are in progress, and some of them will be
shortly published.
The results of the statistical returns made at the close of the year
1860 are now in the press, under the direction of the Statistical
Board. This is also the case with a very complete Directory of all
our provinces. Similar returns from the colonies have likewise been
made, and will soon be published.
The same department has published Geological Memoirs regard-
ing the provinces of Avita and Leon, and likewise the Topography
of the province of Madrid, with a geological map. The whole of
these are due to Don Coriano di Prado.
The plans for railways, canals, and roads, made for the most part


by the Department of Public Works, have been prepared with zeal
and activity, and some interesting results have been obtained in
relation to topography and comparative levels of the country. A
Memoir has likewise been published respecting the Public Works
in Spain, and is accompanied with a map.
Other interesting works by private individuals have been finished,
and in some instances published, amongst which are essays on the
ancient Geography of Spain; and special mention must be made of a
memoir on the site of the city of Munda, which obtained the prize
of the Academy of History.
M. Coello has continued the publication of his Provincial Atlas,
and has recently brought out the maps of four provinces. In the
beginning of last year he published a general Map of Spain, cor-
rected from the most recent data, a copy of which he has kindly
presented to our Society.
Russia.*
Although important questions of social and political reform have
been engaging the attention of all intellects in Russia, yet the
advance of geographical science there, I am happy to say, has not
been retarded.
The Imperial Geographical Society of St. Petersburg continues to
display its wonted zeal and activity. Fresh materials are yearly
contributed by it towards the elucidation and amplification of the
geography both of Russia and of the regions by which that country
is bounded.
The expedition sent to explore Eastern Siberia has made con-
siderable progress in its labours. According to latest accounts
from Port St. Olga, Mr. Schmidt, chief geologist of the expedition,
had started to examine the coast from the estuary of the Amur to
Possiet Harbour. Mr. Glehn, his coadjutor, was employed in a
geological exploration of the island of Saghalin, while Mr. Brylkin
directed his attention to its ethnography. On the return of the
expedition to St. Petersburg in the autumn of the present year, and
on the termination of the labours connected with it, the Imperial
Geographical Society will devote its time and means to further
scientific enterprise. The Council have already under consideration
the adoption of measures for organising three new expeditions. One
will examine the causes that have led to the gradual shallowing of
* John Michell, Esq., F.R.G.S.


the Sea of Azof; the object of the second will be to explore that
portion of the Russian frontier which adjoins the Chinese territory
on the east; the character of the third will be statistico-ethn �gra-
phical, and the field of its labours will be the interior governments
of Russia,
The progressive shallowing of the Sea of Azof had attracted atten-
tion for many years. It was supposed to be caused by ballast being
thrown overboard from merchant-vessels. On this supposition it
was at one time proposed to prohibit the entrance into the Sea of
Azof of all ships, either Russian or foreign, not ballasted with water.
The Government, however, did not adopt this measure, as doubts
were entertained of the correctness of the above supposition.
In 1860 the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg arrived at the
conclusion that the shoaling of the Sea of Azof had been going on
for centuries; that it was not general, but only limited to certain
parts ; that it was not produced by a discharge of ballast, but was
attributable to different local conditions, such as the state of the
sea-bottom, proximity of the steppe, violence of winds and currents,
&c. It further expressed its opinion that a scientific expedition
to examine these circumstances would be productive of useful
results.
These conclusions met with the approval of the august President
of the Imperial Geographical Society; and the Society was authorised
to send a scientific commission to the Sea of Azof. An annual sum
of 5000 silver rubles (810/.), for two years, was assigned from the
imperial treasury to defray the expenses of the expedition, which is
now being organised.
In October last the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed
the Imperial Geographical Society that a commission would proceed
in the spring of this year to trace the boundary-line between Russia
and China on the east, and invited the Society to take advantage of
Piis opportunity for scientific exploration. The Council gratefully
accepted the proposal, and have now under consideration the ways
and means for acting on it.
According to the treaty concluded between Russia and China in
1860, the line of demarcation should extend from the sources of the
Yenisei to the Tian-Shan range of mountains, south of Lake Issyk-
kul. The starting-point to be taken is the landmark of Chabin-
Dabaga, on the frontiers of the governments of Tomsk and Yeniseisk.
This mark, erected in 1728, according to the treaty of Kiakhta,
constituted then the most distant point of contact between the two


empires. From Chabin-Dabaga the frontier runs in a south-westerly
direction as far as Lake Dsai-San, extends along the ridge of the
Djungarian Alataii, crosses the river Hi, and then follows the direc-
tion of the Tian-Shan to the confines of Kokan. This line of frontier,
which has a length of about 2000 versts (1333-1- miles), has already
been visited on many points by Russian scientific travellers. The
country still presents a vast field for future exploration. The region
extending to the west of the sources of the Yenisei has not as yet
been visited by any traveller.
A commission has been appointed, on the recommendation of Mr.
Bezobrazof, for organising an expedition into the interior of Russia,
with the special object of collecting statistico-ethn�graphical data.
The commission, presided over by Mr. Kalatchof, consists of MM.
Artemief, Bezobrazof, Yernadski, Ytorof, Kalinofski, Kostomarof,
Maksimof, Kebolsin, Xeiharat, Stackelberg, and Schepkin.
Among the cartographical labours of the Imperial Geographical
Society a map of Eastern Siberia, by M. Schwartz, deserves special
notice.* It consists of seven sheets, and embraces on a scale of
T,TB-<r,oinr the fluvial region of the Amur, the southern portions of
the Lena and Yenisei, and of the island of Sahalin. Although many
maps of Eastern Siberia have latterly appeared, that of M. Schwartz
is the most reliably correct. As its indications are very detailed,
and based on exact astronomical determinations, it will serve to
complete and rectify the hitherto existing maps.
Mr. Helmersen has compiled a new geological map of Russia.
Several years have elapsed since the appearance of a similar map by
Sir Roderick Murchison, M. Yerneuil, and Count Keiserling, while
the intervening period has been rich in geological discoveries in
Russia. In many localities the limits of formation have been more
distinctly defined; and this has induced Mr. Helmerson to construct
a new map, with the assistance of the well-known Russian geolo-
gists, Pander, Hofmann, Abich, Auerbach, Barbot, Grewingk,
Feophilatof, and Holmberg.
The ?Journal of the Imperial Geographical Society? for the past
year contains, as formerly, articles of high geographical interest.
The materials on Central Asia are, in particular, abundant. I may
especially direct attention to the sketches of Djungaria, and to a
description of the Chinese province of Nan-lu, or Little Bukhara,
by Captain Valikhanof, the son of a Kaisak sultan. This traveller
and Russian savant, as a native of Central Asia, intimately acquainted
with the languages and customs of the countries he visited, enjoyed


every facility for studying and describing these hitherto almost in-
accessible regions. In the garb of a Kokand merchant, in 1859 he
succeeded in reaching Kashgar, and now gives- an interesting
account of his journey. He minutely describes the atrocities com-
mitted by Yalikhan, Hodja of Kashgar, who in 1857 ordered the
execution of the deeply-lamented Adolphe Schlagintweit, and
throws further light on the death of that traveller.
The Sketches of Djungaria, with a detailed description, historical
and geographical, of Little Bukhara, will shortly appear in English
before the public, and will doubtless prove a valuable addition to
our knowledge of the geography of those countries.
Asia.*
The Russian traveller, N. de Khanikof, who has been engaged in
making up the deficiencies in our imperfect knowledge of the Ader-
beijan, in Persia, has made a new map of that region, which he has
had engraved at Berlin. He has distributed several copies of it,
and transmitted his observations regarding that interesting moun-
tain district to the Academy of Sciences in Paris, and also to our
Secretary, Dr. Shaw, for the use of the Royal Geographical Society.
An uncommon degree of regularity characterises the mountain-
ranges of this province of Persia, which is bounded both on the east
and on the west by lofty longitudinal ridges. To the east the Talish
Mountains separate it from the basin of the Caspian ; and to the west
the chain of Kandilar forms a barrier between it and Mesopotamia. To
the north and to the south of the Aderbeijan these two chains are
joined by longitudinal elevations; the one, commencing at Mount
Savalan (of 4752 metres), joins the Kandilan chain in Kurdistan ; the
other, coming off from the Talish Mountains, and known as the Buz-
gush chain, joins Mount Sehend (of 3505 metres). The space in-
cluded between Mount Savalan and the Talish chain of mountains
is occupied by the plain of Mughan, and the Salt Lake of Ur-
mia is situated in the region lying between the Sehend and the
Kandilan chain. The lowest point of this part of Persia, that is to
say, the level of the Lake of Urmia, is 1250 metres above the level
of the sea ; and the highest point in the province of Aderbeijan is-
the summit of Ararat, 6169 metres high. The line of perpetual
snow varies in elevation from 3600 to 3800 metres. This regular
arrangement of the surface of the district, and the character of the

climate, dependent on its high position, are very favourable for topo-
graphical work. The state of the atmosphere is generally so clear
that one is never long without being able to see some one of the
lofty summits which serve as landmarks for reference ; and it rarely
happens that mirage or dry fog interrupts the distinct vision of
objects for an entire day. Notwithstanding the precision with
which the skilful topographers from amongst the officers of the
Caucasus who acted under his orders, as well as himself, endea-
voured to execute the work of laying down the itineraries of de-
tached regions, it would be impossible to combine these independent
labours without the basis of some well-determined astronomical
or geometrical observations. These happily were not wanting, as
he had latitudes and longitudes in Persia which had been settled by
M. Lemm, and the results of the triangulation of the Caucasus under
the direction of General Chosdzko. The former gave a series of
fixed points in the neighbourhood of the Araxes ; and the latter
supplied the like data, rigorously established, between Erivan and
the basin of the Caspian. Hence the localities given in the north
and middle of Khanikof?s map have their exact bearings; and it
is only in the south that he had no other data than such as were
obtained by azimuths measured with the help of the magnetic
needle. The errors to which such observations are necessarily
liable will be corrected when the Anglo-Eussian commission for
defining the Turkish and Russian boundary shall have published
its numerous astronomic data.
That part of the map which is strictly new is the southern por-
tion, in which is situated the Lake Urmia, with its islands; the
itinerary from Marand to Khoi; and the topographical details in the
two provinces of Persian Kurdistan, Lahijan and Ushnu, in which
he had the good fortune to complete the researches of his prede-
cessors, Generals Monteith and Eawlinson.
China;
Geography is already beginning to share in the advantages
derivable from Lord Elgin?s treaty, the conditions of which so
greatly improve the position of the foreigner in China, whether
traveller or official, merchant or missionary. Until that treaty
came into operation, our countrymen could only penetrate the
interior of this vast country in the face of legal prohibitions, and

witli the liability of arrest at the hands of the native authorities.
The new treaty gives British subjects the right of travelling with
a passport through the whole land; and so readily has this per-
mission been availed of, that, in the first year after this right was
obtained, twelve out of the eighteen provinces of China have been
visited by our countrymen, together with Manchoo Tartary, the
cradle of the present dynasty.
First among these explorations comes the ascent of the Yang-
tsze-Kiang, so gallantly undertaken by Colonel Sarel, Captain
Blakiston, Dr. Barton, and Mr. Scheresheffsky, the details of which
are familiar to us all j while the high sense entertained by this
Society of the services these gentlemen have rendered to geography
has been marked, as you have seen this day, by the presentation of
the Patron?s Medal to Captain Blakiston. In tracing the great
Yang-tsze along 1800 miles of its course, those travellers crossed the
six central provinces of Keang-soo, Ngan-hwuy, Keang-se, Hoo-pih,
Hoo-nan, and Sze-chuen; and thus carried their explorations up-
wards of a thousand miles beyond any point that had previously
been openly visited by foreign travellers. The first 700 miles of
that river?s course is now made familiar to Europeans by the
opening of the port of Han-kow to foreign commerce, and there is
every prospect of the high expectations that have been formed of
the capacity of that great central mart being fully realized. Within
eight months of the opening of that port it had been visited by
nearly 200 foreign craft, consisting for the most part of small
steamers; and the foreign trade thus conducted amounted during
the first six months to two millions sterling.
Some particulars of no less than seven other journeys, undertaken
by onr countrymen in the north, centre, and south of China during
the past year, have been made public. In the north, Mr. Monison,
our Consul at the new port of Che-foo, with Captain Harcourt as his
companion, travelled overland to his post from r l een-tsin in the
month of January, and profited by the opportunity thus afforded
him to follow the Grand Canal along nearly 300 miles of its track,
to visit the tomb of the great sage Confucius, which is to be seen
at Kew-foo, in the charge of his own descendants, a family with a
pedigree of 2500 years, dating from the time of the sage himself.
Mr, Morrison also visited Tse-nan, the capital, and other places in
the hitherto unexplored province of Shan-tung, and the journey
took these travellers over 700 miles of country, for the most part
new to Europeans. Six months later, two other foreigners set out


in an opposite direction, and travelled overland from Teen-tsin to
Monk-den, the capital of Manchoo Tartary. They were struck hy
the manner in which this once Tartar country has been virtually
converted into a Chinese province by the superior energy of the
Chinese emigrants, and report that the Manchoos, even in this their
native land, have lost their ground entirely in all parts of the
country where anything is to be made by agriculture and com-
merce ; and that those who remain, by adopting Chinese manners,
customs, and language , have become, to all intents and purposes,
Chinese, and have been absorbed into the predominant race. Later
in the year, in November and December, an expedition through the
two northern provinces of China, Pe-chih-le and Shan-se, was
undertaken by Messrs. Richards and Slossin. Starting from the
same point?Teen-tsin?they appear to have ascended the high pla-
teaus to the north of Peking, and to have skirted the Mongolian
steppes until they reached Shan-se. They travelled in this province
as far as its capital Tai-yuen, and then, turning westward, re-
entered Pe-chih-le, and visited Paou-king, the capital of the latter
province, on their way back to Teen-tsin. The journey occupied
the travellers 46 days, during which time they appear to have
crossed the Great Wall four times, finding it in a state of decay
that may be feared is typical of the country of which it is the chief
monument, and they estimate the total length of their journey at
1560 English miles. The flourishing and populous condition of
most of the country through which they passed accounts for the
success of the new northern port of Teen-tsin, the foreign trade of
which, in the first year of its being opened, has reached the con-
siderable sum of two millions sterling.
Tn the centre of China, four gentlemen ?Messrs. Dickson, Thor-
burn, Beach, and Bonney ?travelled, in the month of April, from
Canton to Han-kow, a distance of 756 miles, which they performed
in 18 days ; their journey differing from those above recited as
being made entirely by water, with the exception of one day?s land
travel across the mountain-range that divides the province of
Kwang-tung from Hoo-nan. Following the course of the north
river in the first-named province, and the Seang River in the latter,
they thus traversed both those provinces from south to north, and
were the first modem explorers of the great Tung-ting Lake, by
which they reached the Yang-tsze and Han-kow. In Cheh-kiang,
Mr. Baker, having recently ascended the Tseen-tang River, and
visited the celebrated green-tea districts of Ngan-hwuy, has again


gone over ground previously travelled by Mr. Fortune, but to find
in this instance that the previous prosperous condition of those im-
portant tea districts has disappeared before the rebel scourge, and
that scenes of industry have been replaced by desolation and
destruction.
In the south of China, the Eev. Dr. Legge was the first foreigner
to ascend, in April of last year, the east river in the Kwang-tung
province to a distance of about 300 miles; and the Eev. Mr. Irwin
and companions have penetrated up the west river, in the same
province, to a somewhat higher point than that reached by the
expedition under Captain McCleverty in the spring of 1859, for a
description of which we are indebted to our associate Lieutenant
Brine. The opening of Formosa to foreign trade gives promise
also of our shortly obtaining further information from that island,
which is interesting not only from its commercial productions, but
also from the presence of aboriginal tribes in its centre and eastern
coast, of which little is as yet known.
It is satisfactory to hear from all these travellers that no serious
obstacles were placed in their way either by the Chinese authorities
or the people; and that, while inconvenienced at times by the not
unnatural curiosity of the latter, when anxious to gaze on foreigners
for the first time, they received from them, in most cases, friendly
welcome and assistance. Our treaty-right to enter the country
having thus obtained an effectual recognition, it will be seen that
China is now thrown open to the researches of the traveller, subject,
however, to the difficulties arising out of the deplorable disorders
which are at present rife in so many of its provinces. Different
parties of rebels or robbers, all acting independently of each other,
were met by Colonel Sarel?s party in Sze-chuen, by Mr. Morrison
in Shan-tung, by Mr. Baker in Cheh-keang, and by Mr. Irwin in
Kwang-tung; while Dr. Dickson?s party, on the other hand, travelled
from Canton to Han-kow?or from the south to the centre of China
?without falling in with any of these destructive hordes; and
Messrs. Eichards and Slossin traversed the provinces of Shan-se
and Pe-chih-le under similar favourable circumstances.

of fresh discoveries in this vast and important region of British

colonization, of which, in a broad sense, it may be said that we have
as yet only occupied the eastern, southern, and western coasts, and
partially their adjacent interior lands. No sooner had we bestowed
one of our Gold Medals on McDouall Stuart, for his adventurous
exploration from South Australia to the northern water-parting,
than we heard of his having again started in the endeavour to reach
the sea which bathes the northern shore of the continent. In the
mean time, however, whilst he has again returned, after reaching
the water-parting of tropical Australia, that end has been attained on
a more eastern meridian by the expedition under the command of
Kichard O?Hara Burke, assisted by the geographer William J. Wills.
Notwithstanding the belief of a great number of old colonists and
travellers, and which is still entertained, that horses and bullocks are
to bo preferred for these adventurous journeys, the ascertained fact
is, that the scheme suggested many years ago by the Geographical
Society, of employing camels as the beasts of burden, is that by
which the continent has first been traversed from south to north
by any of our countrymen.
Whilst two Australian colonies were thus eager rivals in these
discoveries, and that the flourishing younger colonists of Queens-
land, on the north-east, have been extending the range of their
feeding-grounds to zones almost intertropical, and approaching
towards the Gulf of Carpentaria, the north-western limits of
Western Australia have been vastly extended by the successful
survey, by Mr. F. T. Gregory, of that large portion of the very ex-
tensive lands which lie between the settled parts of that colony and
the Cambridge Gulf.
Let us then devote, in the first place, a few words to the con-
sideration of each of these last important discoveries.
The Victorian expedition, though perfectly successful in the
main object of discovering a track to the north, through lands
which are for the first time made known to us as being capable of
occupation at no distant day, and in reaching the mouth of one of
the tributaries of the Gulf of Carpentaria, had, alas! a tragical end.
Its bold leader, Burke, as well as his companion, the accomplished
geographer, Wills, have fallen, but not until their observations
have assured us that they reached the northern shore, at the mouth
of the Flinders Eiver. And here we may well applaud the sugges-
tion of Sir H. Barkly, that the great newly-discovered belt of good
land between Cooper Creek and the south end of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria should be called ?Burke Land so that the name of the


gallant explorer will thus be perpetuated on the east, as that of
Stuart has been properly associated, with the chief highlands on the
west. As the gallant Burke and his associates had long been
absent, and reports arose of their failure and difficulties with which
they were beset, it was highly to the credit of the coterminous
colonies of South Australia and Queensland that they both made
vigorous endeavours to aid in the rescue.
One of these efforts, as made by the direction of Sir Richard
McDonnell and the Government of South Australia, proceeded over
a considerable extent of new ground to the north-eastern part of
that colony; and allusion to it will presently be made, as well as to
other expeditions from Victoria and Queensland.
In considering the steps by which this great work of exploration
of the interior has been brought to its present advanced state, we
must not forget the feats of the laborious and able Surveyor-General
of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Mitchell, who laid down sure
bases of operation for those who were to follow him. It has also
been well said by a recent traveller to the Darling,* and who has
gone over much of the same ground, that, of all the expeditions
subsequent to those of Mitchell, that under the command of our
Medallist Sturt threw most light on the region to the north and
north-west of Menendie. ? The chivalrous Eyre,? he writes, ? had
previously penetrated to the forbidden shores of Lake Torrens, and
the indomitable Stuart has since very nearly crossed the continent ;
but both of them I think would admit, that to Captain Sturt belongs
the great honour of having opened the door to the vast central
regions of Australia.?
The Council of our Society has, indeed, judged well in assigning
a Medal to the family of the lamented Burke, the leader of the
Victorian expedition; and in offering a watch as a recompence to
the sole survivor, the stout-hearted and faithful King, whose simple
narrative of the deaths of his commanders, Burke and Wills, and of
his own preservation of life among the kind natives, has touched
the hearts of all who have read the tale.
The details of the labours of Burke and Wills in traversing and
retraversing the continent have been so recently laid before the
public, that it is unnecessary here to recapitulate them. We must
not, however, pass over the Report of the Commissioners who were
* Mr. Haverfield.


appointed by the Governor of Victoria to inquire into the circum-
stances connected with the sufferings and death of Burke and
Wills. Endeavouring to ascertain the true causes of that lament-
able result, they have thrown the chief blame on Mr. Wright, in
not having left adequate supplies of provisions and clothing at
Cooper Creek. They also impute some discredit to the Explora-
tion Committee, for not stimulating Mr. Wright to advance from
the Darling, where he had been (as they say) in a state of ? fatal
inactivity and idling.? And lastly, they reprove Mr. Brahe, for
retiring from the relief depot before he was rejoined by his com-
mander, Burke; though, from the great responsibility and the want
of sufficiently precise instructions, they excuse that gentleman for his
unfortunate decision.
Whilst they regret ? the absence of a systematic plan of operation
on the part of the leader,? they express ? their admiration of his
gallantry and daring, as well as of the fidelity of his brave coadjutor
and their more fortunate and enduring associate King; and they
conclude with recording ?their feelings of deep sympathy with the
deplorable sufferings and untimely deaths of Burke and his fellow
comrades.?
The friends of Burke must, indeed, derive great satisfaction from
referring to the Despatches of Sir Henry Barkly, who generously
vindicates the conduct of the gallant leader. In a letter to Sir R.
Murchison he thus writes : ?? It is true that he (Burke) was by
nature impetuous, but we have in reality only heard one side of tho
case; and Ido not feel quite sure that he did not leave definite
instructions?possibly even in writing?with his second in command,
and at the Cooper Creek depot, though none are forthcoming or
acknowledged to have existed.? ?At the worst,? he says, ? all that
can be said of his conduct is, that he relied on others proving as
brave and self-sacrificing as himself; that he was out of his
reckoning on this point, and lost his own life in consequence.?
Finally, Sir Henry Barkly has well told Her Majesty?s Secretary
for the Colonies, that ? a less daring leader might never have
crossed the continent, or solved the problem so often vainly
attempted.?
But whilst from the expedition under Burke one man was saved,
we have since been informed of the deaths of four white men, who
were not long ago massacred in the interior, and of whose loss we
should have been entirely ignorant, had not the Government of


South Australia, under Sir Eichard McDonnell, sent out, as before
said, an exploring party from the south-west, to cut in upon the
route of Burke.
After passing over lands, in some parts sterile and saliferous, in
others watered and productive, the searching party of McKinlay
and his assistant Hodgkinson (which was also well found in camels,
as well as with horses and provisions) met with the relics of four
white men, the skulls and skeletons of whom showed incontestable
proofs of their having been murdered. Having obtained possession
of a native who had evidently been one of the murderers, since his
body exhibited healed-up wounds, and the lodgment of a ball as
well as of buck-shot under the skin, he gave to the explorers a
recital of the massacre, and how the natives had eaten the flesh of
their enemies. As the hair of the victims was still adhering to
their skulls, and seemed to the travellers to be of the same colours
as those of Burke and his party; and further, as what was taken
for ?camel? dung was found near the spot, they jumped to the
natural conclusion that in this spot (lat. 27� 15's., long. 139� 50' E.,
and consequently not far from the return route of Burke) they had
really discovered the remains of Burke and his three companions.
On their return to the settlements of the colony, however, this
theory was entirely dispelled by the true account of the deaths of
Burke and Wills, and of the safe return of the sole survivor, King.
Who, then, were these unfortunate four explorers of the interior ?
That they were British subjects, and not natives, is certain; not
only from the skeletons and the colours of their hair, but also
by the discovery of an English almanac of 1858. We also know
that they had made a vigorous resistance, which is established, not
only by the testimony of the black man, but also by the gun-shot
wounds inflicted on him. Then, again, we have the proofs of the
savage nature of this band of the aborigines, by learning that, after
this one native left them, McKinlay?s party were shortly assailed by
a large well-armed body, who were only repelled by a hot fire from
our countrymen.
What a mystery is this, then, and how are we to explain it?
Surely we ought to be able to obtain, from the settlers on the
outskirts of the colonies of Victoria and South Australia, some
information to throw light on the journey into the interior of any
persons who may be identified with these hapless men! Again, is
it not strange that, at so short a distance as exists between the site
of this massacre and that of the deaths of Burke and Wills, the


character of the aborigines should differ so essentially ? for we are
assured by the diary of the last days of Wills, that he and his
associates were treated with great kindness by the natives. We
also know, from the testimony of the survivor King, that when these
poor creatures (among whom he lived until the relief finally reached
him) saw the bodies of Burke and Wills they wept over them,
because they saw that they might have saved our countrymen from
starvation. We thus know that there are generous and tender-
hearted aborigines in Australia, as well as those who appear to be
irreclaimable and cruel savages; and this, too, in tribes not far dis-
tant, from each other.
Leaving this problem to be solved between our friends the
ethnologists and philanthropists, we may in the mean time anticipate
that with such energies as have been displayed by the explorers
proceeding from our settled colonies in the last thirty years,
including the older researches of Mitchell, Eyre, Sturt, Leichhardt,
and others, there can be no doubt that the colonists of Queensland
will soon extend their pastures to the Gulf of Carpentaria; and
that the northernmost settlers of South Australia, following up the
track of Stuart, will ere long found establishments in the bosom of
the noble recesses of Cambridge Gulf and the northern Victoria
Eiver, where fleets can anchor securely, and where the vegetation
is luxuriant.
If the northern coast of this great continent is thus destined to be
occupied by migrations from the east and south, it has recently been
to a considerable extent successfully surveyed from the west by
Mr. Frank T. Gregory; who, in extending the boundary of Western
Australia, and in demonstrating the existence of large tracts of fine
land, reaching eastwards to beyond east long. 121�, in lat. 2W, has
led us to hope that not many years will elapse before the warm
desire of British geographers will be realised by actual occupation
?at all events by the description of the headlands and inner
portions which lie between Nickol Bay and Cambridge Gulf.
Having conveyed his party, with horses and provisions, by sea,
from Perth to Xickol Bay, Mr. Gregory first explored the interior
to the south-west, or towards the tracts lying on the north-western
exterior of the settlements of West Australia, which he had surveyed
in 1848. Following up a river, which he named the Fortescue, for
180 miles, and which flows through good lands, he reached eleva-
tions, which he termed the Hammels? Eange, and through which he
travelled by a pass 2000 feet above the sea, in lat. 22� 15', and east


long. 318� 4'. Beyond this range he fonnd extensive fertile plains
running far westwards, or towards the colony, as far as the eye
could reach. Travelling still further with a smaller party to the
south-west, he fell in with a large river flowing from the e.s.e.
This he named the Ashburton, from our noble President; and,
judging from the fine pasture-lands on its hanks, he believes that
this tract (which he connected by triangulation with Mount
Augustus and the Lynn River of his former survey) will become in
a few years a valuable district of the province.
. Having returned to the vessel, to recruit and replenish his stores
after this his first journey of 780 miles, Mr. Gregory then pushed
his survey south-east and eastwards, and passed in succession rivers
which were called the Yule, the Shelley, and the Shaw, and then to
the recipient of the two last rivers?a finer stream, to which the
name of De Grey was given, in honour of our last President, under
whose auspices the expedition was initiated. Again, much fine
land was observed, the united journeys amounting to 2040 miles.
The clear and interesting sketch of this survey which has already
been given by Mr. Gregory will be much enhanced when his
maps are constructed in the accurate manner with which he works
out all his data. In the mean time we already learn that this newly-
discovered region, consisting of a succession of terraces that rise
from the shore to lofty plateaux 2600 feet above the sea, has its
culminating point in Mount Bruce, at an altitude of 4000 feet;
whilst within the limits of the route followed not less than
2,000,000 acres are fitted for grazing purposes, and at least 200,000
acres are suitable for cultivation. The fruits and plants which are
indigenous include, among the latter, tobacco, sandal-wood, and
palms; and the author conceives that, notwithstanding its quasi
intertropical position, the district is as well adapted to the growth
of wool, as grounds in the same latitude in Queensland have proved
to be; whilst he feels confident that there are also considerable
tracts specially available for raising cotton.
The varied eruptive rocks of the country, whether of granitic or
of volcanic origin, and the different sedimentary formations, from
high plateaux of older sandstone to the youngest and more calca-
reous and sandy deposits, have been carefully observed. Again,
meteorological and magnetical data have been carefully registered ;
and we are informed that the aborigines, who are of fine stature,
some of them exceeding 6 feet in height, might be made useful in
labour, and would by no means prove unmanageable or troublesome


if properly treated; whilst a valuable pearl-fishery may also be
established in N ickol Bay.
This survey, being the last of the very important services which
have been performed by Mr. Gregory, is the more entitled to
our approbation, as it was undertaken at our recommendation to
Her Majesty?s Colonial Secretary, the Duke of Newcastle; and we
have to thank His Grace for countenancing this expedition in
conjunction with the local Colonial Government.
The complete success of this exploration, without the loss of a
man, is a decisive proof of the skilful and well-considered pre-
arrangements and conduct of the leader, and will, we trust, induce
Her Majesty?s Government to continue to place reliance on any
suggestions which may in future proceed from the Council of the
Eoyal Geographical Society.
In concluding these observations on the recent progress of disco-
very in Australia, we may well advert to the strenuous efforts made
by the colonists of Victoria and Queensland to succour Burke and his
party. Naturally anxious as we have been respecting the issue of
the searching expeditions sent from Victoria by sea, and overland
from Queensland, the news just received is highly gratifying
to all geographers and philanthropists. Sir Henry Barkly has
written to Sir E. Murchison, stating that, notwithstanding the wreck
of the Firefly tender, of which we had heard, on one of the reefs
in Torres Straits, the good management of Captain Norman, the
commander of the Victoria steamer, has been such that the Firefly
was emptied of water and tugged round into the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, in spite of much stormy weather. Arriving at the mouth of
the Albert Eiver, men and horses, with abundance of stores, were
landed from those ships, as well as from two colliers, which had
also been sent round; so that Mr. Landsborough, who had been
recommended for the search by Mr. Gregory, was at once enabled
to explore for some distance into the interior.
In the mean time Mr. Walker, who was sent with a party of
aboriginal troopers from Brisbane and Eockhampton, having gained
the mouth of the Albert, passed in his route the river Flinders,
near the sea, and there, to his delight, found the distinct tracks of
Burke?s party; thus realising the truth of the narrative of the sole
survivor, King, that Burke and Wills really reached the salt water
of the Gulf of Carpentaria. This discovery further confirms the
belief of the astronomers and geographers who inquired into the
subject, that it was the mouth of the Flinders, and not of the


Albert, -which the gallant adventurers had reached. Being supplied
with provisions for fqur months, Mr. Walker then returned to the
mouth of the Flinders, to follow up the trail of Burke; and, as he
had been gone 80 days when Captain Norman left the mouth of the
Albert, we may reasonably expect to hear soon of his arrival at
Cooper Creek and the colony of Victoria.
Whilst Walker is thus occupied, Mr. Landsborough is proceeding
southwards, on the meridian of the Albert Eiver, to Victoria; and
thus by this double exploration the whole of the region to which
Sir H. Barkly has worthily assigned the name of ? Burke Land ?
will be thoroughly made known to us.
That which to many cautious persons seemed to be a chimera a
few years ago, but which the writer of these lines has always
regarded as a most desirable result, will therefore ere long bo
accomplished, and the shores of Tropical Australia will, through its
great indentations, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cambridge Gulf,
be fairly occupied by our colonists, who, communicating with the
southern colonies, from whence they spring, by the lines opened
out by Stuart and Burke, will carry on an advantageous intercourse
with the Eastern Archipelago, and afford grand and useful bays of
refuge to all imperilled vessels. Truly we may now rejoice that
our Council has wisely, as well as generously, judged in assigning
a Medal to the family of Burke, and in not omitting to mark their
sense of the faithful conduct and truthful narrative of the brave old
soldier, King.
Whilst such has been the progress of discovery in hitherto
unknown lands, our knowledge concerning the real mineral struc-
ture of the regions already colonised has been largely increased.
The admirable Geological Maps of Victoria, prepared by Mr.
Selwyn, and the palaeontological illustrations thereof, by Professor
McCay, would do honour to the most advanced country in Europe;
and though the other colonies cannot as yet boast of similar profi-
ciency in maps and sections, every geologist knows how much his
science is indebted to the Eev. W. B. Clarke, for his long-continued
and successful endeavours in developing the true geological structure
of New South Wales.
If from Australia we extend our observations to other regions of
Australasia colonised by Britain, you perceive the rapid progress
which is made in the development of wealth, commerce, and
civilisation. Thus in Tasmania, thanks to the vigorous endeavours
of my young and able friend Mr. Charles Gould, coal-fields of value


in the north-eastern portion of that great island have been laid
open, and the valuable substance, dysodile, has been extracted.
Again, in New Zealand the Local Governments are exerting
themselves to procure the services of scientific men, who, possessing
an acquaintance with geography and topography, are well versed
in the sciences of geology and mineralogy, and can indicate upon
maps the real value of the subsoil of each district. Thus, whilst the
able geologist, Dr. Hochstetter, who was one of the men of science
who sailed round the world in the Austrian frigate Novara, has
made us well acquainted with the nature of the rocks and the
usefulness of the fossils found around Auckland, my friend Dr.
Hector (with whose merits this Society is so well acquainted,
through his admirable labours as the senior scientific officer of
Palliser?s expedition in North America) is now the geologist,
geographer, and naturalist of the thriving Scottish colony of Otago,
in the southernmost of the New Zealand islands.
So earnest, indeed, are the colonists of New Zealand to obtain a
scientific insight into the nature of their rocks, that applications
have recently been made to Sir E. Murchison to secure the services
of a competent person to conduct a geological survey of the newly-
settled district of Wellington.
AFRICA*
It is long since tidings have reached us from either of our two
medallists, Livingstone and Speke, in whose explorations our Society
takes especial interest, both from the brilliancy of their former
achievements and the importance of their present undertakings.
Just before the anniversary of 186 X we heard of Livingstone?s de-
parture from the Zambesi, in his small steamer, to examine the
Kovuma Eiver and ascertain whether any basis existed for the often-
expressed belief that that river would afford a convenient and a
neutral highway to the vast regions of the Niassa, independent of
the complications of Portuguese territorial claims. The result of
his examination reached us shortly afterwards : it was far from
satisfactory. His steamer of light draught was unable to ascend
the Eovuma for more than a few miles, before it became necessary
to return hastily, else she would have been left grounded by the
falling waters until the ensuing rainy season. Livingstone then
revisited the Zambesi and established the members of the University
* Francis Galton, Esq., Hon. Secretary, r.g.s.


mission in the healthiest quarters he could find near the banks of
the Shire.
We have heard nothing whatever of Speke since our last anni-
versary, except a fragment of news which is exceedingly satis-
factory, though it left him at a stage and a date little removed from
where he last wrote to us. It will be remembered that he had then
described himself in trouble. The desert of Ugogo was peculiarly
parched in 1861; he and the natives had difficulty in obtaining
food, and a large number of his porters had deserted and left him.
We have since learnt, through a native merchant who had inter-
changed a few passing words with him, that Speke was accompanied
by a fresh body of porters, that he had extricated himself from the
desert of Ugogo, and was travelling rapidly and in excellent force
on the way to Unianyembe.
Provisions will not fail him if he emerges this summer at Gonda-
koro on the White Nile, for by aid of the funds liberally subscribed
by many Fellows of this Society and by Mr. Consul Petherick?s
furtherance, boats laden with grain were despatched by that gentle-
man, under a proper escort, from Khartum up the White Nile, early
in this year.
The present condition of the White Nile is such as to grieve
deeply those who believe commerce to be the most effectual agent
in civilizing Africa. Fifteen years ago the natives along its shores
were mostly inoffensive and hospitable to travellers; but the stream
of trade that has yearly passed along it, uncontrolled by any moral
supervision, and mostly in the hands of reckless adventurers and
lawless crews, has driven the numerous 'tribes along its banks into
so general and deep an hostility against strangers, that the White
Nile cannot now be ascended except by an armed force of consider-
able magnitude.
The hopes we entertained last year of an increased knowledge of
the Upper White Nile, through the independent labours of M. Lejean
and Dr. Peney, have failed us, owing to the illness and return of the
former gentleman and the premature death of the latter. Dr. Peney
did some good service to geography before he died: he travelled
westwards from Gondakoro for 60 miles, and there apparently struck
the penultimate stage of Petherick?s former expedition. If this be
the case?and the identity of the names of the places and tribes
and geographical features leave hardly room for doubt?an enor-
mous rectification becomes necessary in the estimated extent and


direction of Petherick?s itinerary. Peney also travelled above Gon-
dakoro, through the cataracts, to nearly the furthest point of which
we have even a rumour, and he places his goal at about one degree
south of Gondakoro, and on absolutely the same meridian.
The determination of the altitude and snowy summit of Kili-
manjaro, by the Baron von der Decken and his geological associate
Mr. Thornton, has gladdened African geographers, who felt it was
little creditable to their science that so interesting a subject should
remain year after year open to question. It is a pleasure to find
that the wanderings of missionaries, solely in the pursuit of their
calling, should have led them here, as it has often done elsewhere,
to be the first discoverers of new lands and pioneers to more accurate
research.
An elaborate report on the dominions of Zanzibar, by Lieut.-
Colonel Rigby, has been published in the Selections from the Records
of the Bombay Government. It appears from subsequent accounts
that the condition of that island has lately fallen into a very dis-
turbed state.
On the coast of Africa opposite to Kilimanjaro, Captain Burton,
our ever active medallist and now H. M. Consul at Fernando Po,
has materially contributed to a survey of the large creeks and river-
mouths which form a characteristic feature of those shores, and in
the knowledge of which we are unduly deficient. We hear also of
his ascent of the lofty Cameroon Mountain, and shall doubtless
receive from him a detailed account of that extinct volcano, which
in its origin, latitude, and proximity to the sea, as well as by its
prominence, holds a position on the West Coast curiously corre-
sponding to that of Kilimanjaro on the East of Africa.
The French have exerted themselves with energy in reconnoitring
the tributaries of the great bay or estuary of the Gaboon, all of
which take their rise in the flanks of the neighbouring mountain
chain through which the Ogobai, familiar to us by the writings of
Du Chaillu, bursts its way, in its course from a more distant interior.
Numerous explorations have been made in Senegambia and in the
North-Western Sahara. The travels of 800 Moghdad are perhaps
the most important. He left St, Louis on the Senegal, and passed
to Mogador, on the coast of Marocco. Lambert?s journey to Timbo
is also of great interest. Duveyrier has returned to Algiers with
large stores of information gathered in the Sahara, which he is pre-
paring for publication, and which African geographers await with


keen interest. We are sorry to hear that that energetic young
traveller is suffering very severely from the effect of his many
journeys.
Heuglin?s expedition in search of information hearing on Yogel?s
fate, in Wadai, has made some advance in his necessarily circuitous
route. He landed at Massowa and spent some months in Abyssinia,
awaiting the favourable season for onward travel. His researches in
that country have been original and minute, especially with regard
to the geology and hypsometry of its northern borderland.
Our medallist Barth is engaged in the publication of a work of
paramount importance to African ethnologists, namely, an elaborate
collection of vocabularies of the tribes of Central Africa. It is
mainly from a comparison of dialects that we may hope to unravel
some portion of the mutual relations and early history of the various
races which inhabit that large portion of the earth?s surface, and we
rejoice that the present work has been undertaken by so accomplished
a philologist and geographer.
Finally, large maps of Africa are in progress of publication, the
one by Dr, Petermann, in his comprehensive ? Mittheilungen,? and
the other by Mr. Eavenstein, in England.*
Our own Labours. - ]*
The relation of the Society to the wide range of science which
it cultivates may be referred to with satisfaction. Through its
influence, or by its Associates, it may be identified with most of the
enterprises which enlarge the knowledge*of the more remote regions
or add to the details of those more intimately known. Although
the progress of geography?a science which has been the growth of
so many ages?can be but imperfectly estimated by the brief retro-
spect of the limited period to which this notice must be confined,
still the past two years have been marked by some very important
accessions to our knowledge.
It might perhaps be inferred that the industry of modem tra-
* Since the Anniversary Meeting, intelligence has been received of Dr. Living-
stone?s navigation of the west coast of the Nyassa (in an open boat) up to
lat. 11� 20'; during the whole of which distance (200 miles) its width appeared
never to exceed 60 miles, no large river was seen to flow into it, and no certain
account was obtainable of its northern termination. It lay between highlands;
its waters were of great depth, and continually and dangerously stormy. The
same mail informed us of the deaths, from fever, of Bishop Mackenzie and of
another important member of the University mission,
f Alexander George Findlay, Esq., F.R.G.S.


vellers, so well and so persistently carried on, would have left to
these later times but few regions unexplored, or features to he
noticed in primary discovery; hut the late Transactions of our
Society will lead to the inference that there lies hidden much more
than has been revealed, and that our motto ? Ob terras reclusas,?
will still apply almost as justly to the countries close around us as
to the still unknown mysteries of Africa or Australia. The last
volumes of our Transactions publish the details of primary dis-
covery and exploration more extensive and important, of countries
absolutely unknown before, than those contained in the first, when
the true course of the then mysterious Niger, or the earliest
journeys into the interior of Australia, were described.
There is one evidence of the appreciation of the Society and its
usefulness in the unbroken chain of travellers and labourers which
are and have been connected with it; those of later times being
often the friends, pupils, or associates of those who first enriched
its volumes with the results of their enterprise, and whose works
may be traced continuously from its origin to those which I shall
briefly allude to presently. The Annual Addresses of former Pre-
sidents will show how large a share has been taken in the progress
of Geography by the Eoyal Geographical Society since its foun-
dation.
Europe.? ln Europe the work of general research into the minute
details of geography is far too great for individual labour, and the
Addresses of your Presidents will show what great undertakings are
carried on by various Governments; but that there is room for per-
sonal enterprise is shown by the communications of our well-known
Associates Capt. Sherard Osborne, Capt. Spratt, and Major Stokes,
on the course of the Lower Danube, descriptions of great national
utility.
Our Corresponding Member, Professor Paul Chaix, has sent us
an account of the surveys connected with the Great Federal Map
of Switzerland, which have been in progress for half a century.
Professor Holst, of Christiania, has also given an account, translated
from the Norse for us by our Secretary, Dr. Norton Shaw, of the
important and excellent surveys in Norway, which have been
proceeding since the year 1779, a period at the dawn of geodetical
science.
�e have an interesting account of a portion of the Caucasus, the
country of the Lesghi tribes of Hilly Daghestan, by the Baron de
Bode, son of our deceased Associate. This communication, and a


more widely extended dissertation on the Caucasus generally, by
Captain D. Cameron, f.r.g.s., draws attention to an enchanting
country and a most interesting people, or rather variety of races.
As a region for tourists, the Caucasus would seem to present attrac-
tions and novelties far exceeding those met with on most beaten
tracks.
Iceland was visited by the expedition which, under Capt. Allen
Young, examined into the geographical positions for the proposed
Atlantic telegraph by the northern route; and our excellent Asso-
ciate and Medallist, Dr, Eae, has given us a graphic account of his
crossing this interesting island.
Asia has afforded a large field for the enterprise of those of our
Associates who have penetrated into its less known regions recently
laid open to us by political events.
The most important of these is the navigation and survey of
the upper portion of that great river which is the pride of China,
the Yang-tsze-Kiang. In a late volume of the Journal an account
is given by our Associate, Mr. Laurence Oliphant, the Secretary to
the Embassy, of the ascent of the river to Han-kow, 623 miles above
its mouth. To this expedition was also attached Capt. Sherard
Osborne, who, in the Arctic regions, in the Black Sea and else-
where, has done such good service to geography. Another Arctic
officer, Mr. Court, who, under Sir K. M?Clure, performed the North-
West Passage, also aided in this good work. Mr. Blackncy?s name
must also be associated in this expedition, as having given us an
excellent account of his observations. It will be fresh in the memory
of all that these officers and their coadjutors ascended this mighty
river in vessels of large draught of water to this great distance
with our eminent Fellow, Lord Elgin.
It must be a subject of gratification to the Society that the
further exploration of this mighty and important river should havd
been executed through the personal zeal of our Associates, who
have just received the highest mark of our appreciation, and who,
like the officers of the preceding expedition, have won laurels in
very different quarters of the globe. This topic is alluded to in
another portion of this Address; but it is difficult to overrate the
importance of these communications, either in a commercial sense
or in relation to our future intercourse with that industrious and
peculiar people.
In another part of China, the war led our Associate Lieut.
Brine, with an expedition under Capt. M?Cleverty, R.N., up the


Si-Kiang; and he has given ns an account of the conntiy through
which the ships passed for 7 5 miles, and of the capabilities of the
river for commercial purposes. This and the interesting cpmmu-
nications of Capt. Sprye, and our Associate Dr. M'Cosh, on the
countries on the west frontier of China, have been alluded to in a
previous Address.
It is to be regretted that political circumstances prevented the
expedition under Capt. Smyth, accompanied by Lieut. Jackson,
Dr. Stewart, &c., from proceeding into Chinese Tartary last year.
When our relations with China shall have attained a more firm
basis, this important subject may be renewed, and will assuredly
have again, as in the first case, the support and countenance of the
Society.
Lieut. Oliver, R.A., has sent us some notes on the country west
of Canton?another addition to our knowledge of this hitherto
almost hidden country, which has been directed to be published in
our Proceedings.
In an adjacent region we have had some interesting matter com-
municated by the late M. Mouhot, on Cambodia, where he had
been resident for some years; and Mr. Edw, O?Eiley has sent some
notes on a tour through the Shan States. The communications of
Mr. D. 0. King of his journeys to the south-east of Bangkok, alluded
to in a former Address, and the notes on the same country, collected
by our Associate Mr. Jas. Campbell, demonstrate how busy is the
spirit of inquiry respecting these countries, which have remained
almost entirely closed to Europeans till recent times.
Foremost in the research stands our indefatigable Corresponding
Associate and Medallist Sir Robert H. Schomburgk, busy in the
acquisition of information, and active in travelling through this
hitherto little visited country and enervating climate. He has
forwarded us several memoirs on the country of Siam, in which he
represents the British Government: one on a boat-voyage to the
town of Pecha-buri, and many particulars of a region which we only
knew from vague conjecture or crude delineation. His Report on
the trade and resources of this country are of high interest. An-
other of these communications was an account of a painful journey
he had accomplished up the great river Menam, and thence on the
backs of elephants to Moulmein, in our own possessions on the
Bay of Bengal. It is thirty years since he gained his first reputa-
tion in the Transactions of the Royal Geographical Society, by his
survey of Anegada in the West Indies, and twenty-three years


since he received its Medal for his extensive and excellent researches
in British Guiana and neighbouring countries. These are so well
remembered that they need only be adverted to here to associate
his earlier adventures with the later communications which we
have welcomed.
In Japan the Society and our Associates have taken a deep and
active interest, and have zealously endeavoured to advance our
knowledge of this important country. It will be sufficient here to
allude to the Papers sent by our Associate Mr. Eutherford Alcock,
Her Majesty?s envoy to that country. His accounts of his journeys
into the interior, and of his ascent of their sacred mountain Fusi-
yama, form an epoch in geographical progress.
Another narrative is also most interesting, that of the journeys
of Mr. Pemberton Hodgson into the interior of the untravelled and
uncivilized island of Yeso. The discussions which ensued on these
Papers, and the remarks of Mr. Laurence Oliphant, Sir Frederick
Nicholson, Mr. Wylie, and others, must be of great interest to those
who have watched the early stages of our intercourse with the
Japanese. One fact of importance, often repeated by geographers,
is manifest by the experience of Mr. Hodgson in these several
journeys. Although unarmed, and accompanied by ladies, he
travelled safely amid the demi-savage inhabitants, who had never
before seen a European, without the slightest obstruction, and
receiving perfect courtesy and hospitality. This fact, which may
be also gathered from the experience of many in all parts of the
world, teaches a lesson to those who first meet with untutored men,
that they should be treated with that consideration, the want of
which has generally been the origin of that opprobrium too fre-
quently bestowed upon what is retaliation.
Political events have placed another country prominently before
the geographical world. The great river Amur has been found to
be one of the most important rivers of Northern Asia, as by it the
vast and isolated central steppes of Mongolia can be readily ap-
proached by water-conveyance; and it is even stated that, with a
very small amount of road and canal, the traffic could easily bo
carried on from the Pacific to the Baltic. The Addresses of Sir
Eoderick Murchison will tell how much the Russian explorers and
surveyors have done to elucidate the geography of this region, and
the excellent map constructed by Mr. Arrowsmith will show its
features at a glance.
In the last published volume of our Transactions we have a
VOL. xxxil. ? m


further accession to Asiatic geography, viz., a translation of the narra-
tive and account of a Journey to the Tian-Shan, or Celestial Moun-
tains, in Eussian Tartary, by P. P. Semenoff, which was undertaken
under the auspices of the Imperial Eussian Geographical Society.
M. Semenoff was the first European who visited (in 1857) this
gigantic range?one of the four which traverse Asia in a parallel
direction, only two of which have been explored, the Himalayas
from the south, and the Altai from the north. Another translated
Memoir on the same country is also given, by M. A. Golubef, who
has travelled on the Chinese frontier.
There are two Papers on the beautiful valley of Kashmir by our
Associates, Mr. W. H. Purdon, c.E., and Capt. H. H. Austen. In
addition to a description of the physical features of this interesting
country, they give a farther account of that most remarkable and
important work, the Trigonometrical Survey of India, as carried
over it. In former Addresses and Memoirs this immense under-
taking, carried on by the East India Company, first under Colonel
Lambton, and then under the control of our respected Associates
Sir George Everest till 1843, and Sir A. S. Waugh, has been dilated
on. In these Papers the services rendered to science, and to geo-
graphy in particular, by Capt. T. G. Montgomerie, are stated. The
refined operations of a survey of this order, carried over a peaceful
and accessible country, possess none of the interest or romance
with which these great Indian observations are invested. In the
triangulation and survey of Kashmir the officers met with great
difficulties; much of the service was carried on during the great
Indian mutiny, surrounded by hostile people, and amid physical
difficulties never before encountered in such a manner. The whole
history of the vast survey of Northern India may be cited as a fine
testimonial of the progress of primary exploration.
Of the large and almost unknown island of New Guinea we have
had some account from our Associate Mr. A. Bussell Wallace, for
some time its sole European inhabitant. Mr. Wallace?s zeal in the
cause of science is well known, and his accessions to our knowledge
of the natural history of this vast island have been shown in other
places.
Mr. Spenser St. John, f.r.g.s., now in Haiti, has given us a most
valuable account of the north-west coast of Borneo, where he was
Consul-General?a further accession to our knowledge of the country
first developed by our Associate Sir James Brooke.
The itineraries of Captain Claude Clerk, f.r.g.s., in Persia, in


1857-9, will be read with interest, affording valuable materials to
the geographer. Captain Clerk describes his journeys between
Tehran and Herat in the North, and Tehran and Bushire in
Western Persia.
Proceeding to another part, we have a graphic and excellent
account of the Andaman Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, by our
Associate Dr. Mouat. This little group and its curious inhabitants
seem to have been scarcely visited, though much in the way of
commerce, till it was chosen as the place of exile for some of the
Indian mutineers.
Sir Henry Eawlinson, who, twenty-three years since, received
the Medal of the Eoyal Geographical Society as a comparative
geographer of the highest order, and who, since his first recogni-
tion by this Society, has laboured so intensely, and with such
admirable results, has advocated in our pages a most important
proposal for connecting by electric telegraph our Indian possessions
with this country. The route proposed is by way of Constantinople
and the Euphrates, and thence through Persia, &c., to Kurrachee.
The Ottoman Government has constructed the line as far as Bus-
sorah, a route advocated in the early days of this Society by our
respected Associate and Medallist General Chesney, as the readiest
way to India for an overland transit. Although the progress of
ocean steam-navigation has altered the relations which then existed,
it is gratifying to know that the views endorsed by the Society
have been so far recognised now as to form the basis for the
modem system of telegraphic connexion. The discussion which
ensued on Sir H. Eawlinson?s proposition' demonstrates that it was
one of the highest geographical and national importance.
Africa has engrossed a large share of the attention of the Eoyal
Geographical Society. From the time that the Society?s first
Medal was awarded to Eichard Lander, thirty-one years since, for
solving the great problem of the course of the Niger, to the present
moment, when we are looking for the consummation of its en-
deavours to elucidate that other ancient enigma, the true sources
of the Nile, the Society has been more or less occupied with obtain-
ing information of the physical and moral condition of this great
continent and its people.
At the first period above named, our maps of Africa exhibited
its interior as nearly one universal blank, or with only the vague
surmises of crude speculation. Now the geography of inner Africa
presents a very different aspect. The pages of our Transactions


are an index to the progress of discovery, which has been gradually
displacing the imaginary arid desert by the well-watered and fertile
country, or the supposed tenantless solitude with busy and popu-
lous tribes.
It is needless to advert to the early travels of Dr. Livingstone
across the continent. The relation of the Geographical Society to
that great traveller, and the wonderful successes due to his in-
domitable courage and untiring energy, must ever be a subject of
congratulation.
The Society has for many years most zealously advanced those
attempts to resolve the great geographical problem of the true
sources of the White Nile; and all are now looking with great
interest for tidings of the expedition under our Medallist Captain
Speke and his companion Captain Grant, in the confident hope
that the experience its leader gained when associated with Captain
Burton in the Somali country, and in the journeys to the great
African lakes, will enable him to complete successfully what
was then commenced, and definitively set at rest that question of
so many ages? standing. It is needless now to speculate as to any
connexion there may or may not be between the head-waters of the
Nile and the Victoria Nyanza, which he visited in July, 1858, as
this will all be determined, it is believed, when we hear of the
traveller?s further progress. This topic is elsewhere adverted to,
as is the expedition of Consul Petherick, who also travels under the
auspices of the Society to the aid of Captains Speke and Grant.
We look hopefully that before the next session we may welcome
these gallant men on their successful return.
A brief account has been received from Mr. Eichard Thornton, of
an expedition to the great volcano Kilimanjaro, which has been
thought to have some connexion? with the physical geography of
the Nile basin. Mr. Thornton was at first connected as geologist to
Dr. Livingstone?s expedition, but afterwards joined the Baron von
der Decken, a Hanoverian gentleman, to the mountain. This
journey is of importance; for while it fully confirms the accounts of
the missionaries given in our former Proceedings, it has the addi-
tional claim of survey and geological observation. Being an iso-
lated volcanic cone, Kilimanjaro does not form part of that great
eastern meridional axis which was so well argued upon by Sir
Eoderick Murchison in former years, and which has been reasoned
on by some as the Mountains of the Moon of ancient geographers.
The Baron and his associate did not reach this great division be-


tween the Eastern and Western waters, and therefore the Nile
question, probably, is not affected by the result of their journey.
Dr. Livingstone?s proceedings are noticed in another part of this
Address; a brief allusion to them here will therefore suffice. His
visit to the Victoria Falls of the great river Zambesi, and his farther
observations on this important river, are of great interest. Connected
also with his operations is the exploration of the river Shire and
the great Lake Shirwa. The more exact knowledge thus placed
before us, instead of the imperfect accounts given by the Portuguese
of former years, are of great importance in the future conduct of
commercial or other relations with these regions. In the progress
of this expedition an important part has been taken by Mr.
Thomas Baines, well known as the artist of the North Australian
expedition, and also in Kaffraria. Mr. Charles Livingstone, Dr.
Kirk, the botanist of the expedition, and Mr. May, our Associate,
have well seconded their leader in examining and reporting on the
country. The examination of the Eovuma River, although not
deciding whether it is the outlet of one of the chain of the East
African lakes, is of importance.
The geography of Eastern Africa has thus assumed an entirely
new aspect within a very brief period. The exact knowledge we
now possess contrasts in every way with the chaos of opinion and
imperfect observation which before these expeditions were organised
were our only guides. Although much may be required before we
can have a perfect and accurate geographical picture of Eastern or
Central Africa, yet the data thus laid down will be the foundation
of that which will be subsequently acquired. The representations
we now have demonstrate how imperatively necessary it is that
astronomical observation should be connected with the necessarily
vague estimates of a traveller over an unknown country.
On the shores of Western tropical Africa, our indefatigable
medallist, Captain Richard Burton, is active in the acquisition
of information concerning the country where he represents Her
Majesty?s Government. The accounts of his visits to various places
in the Bights of Benin and Biafra will be read with much interest,
and there is no doubt but that his varied talent and extensive know-
ledge will accumulate much valuable information on these countries.
He ascended and surveyed the Ogun or Abeokuta River, in com-
pany with Captain Bedingfield, our Associate, who is well known
to us in connexion with his examinations of the Congo, and as one
of Dr. Livingstone?s expedition.
Dr. Baikie, r.n., our Associate-, who has been long on the Niger


and Chadda rivers, endeavouring to establish a commanding posi-
tion for England in Central Africa, has written hopefully of his
prospects, should his expedition he retained. Intelligence has just
arrived that the Sunbeam has ascended the river for 600 miles.
Another communication records the proceedings of Commander
Dolben, f.r.g.s., during his ascent of the river Yolta for 120 miles
for the first time by white men.*
With the increasing importance of the commerce of the Gold Coast
and Western Africa generally, these narratives acquire additional
interest, and inspire the hope that a more intimate acquaintance
with the physical condition of these countries will lead to a beneficial
intercourse with the people who have so long been debased by the
slave-traffic.
North America. ?For many years, as is well known, the Geo-
graphical Society took a most active part in the promotion of Arctic
discovery, during the progress of which nearly the whole of the
northern limits of America was accurately surveyed; and it is this
service that developed the energies and skill of so many excellent
officers, whose geographical labours have been so frequently men-
tioned in this and many previous Addresses, and are distributed
throughout the pages of our Transactions,
During the period of these searching expeditions, one portion of
the British dominions, now famous as British Columbia, was almost
less known and visited than these icy and remote regions; and the
explorations and surveys of our medallist Captain Palliser, with his
coadjutors, Captain Blakiston, Dr, Hector, and Mr. Sullivan, which
have been treated of recently in former Addresses, have proved of
immense service. The sudden interest with which the gold dis-
covery has invested this country has given a high value to these ex-
plorations, which the Geographical Society so earnestly forwarded.
In the early days of the colonization of a country all exact in-
formation is of the utmost importance, and the reports of our Asso-
ciate, Commander Mayne, r.n., of Lieutenant Palmer, r.e., of Mr.
Justice Begbie, Mr. Downie, and others, as given in the Journal,
must render great service. Captain R. W. Torrens has also given
us an account of his ascent of the Nass River for 116 miles above
Fort Simpson, near the borders of Russian America, and of the evi-
dences of the existence of gold that were found in this novel journey.
Our lamented Associate, Captain Grant, has sent further notes on
Vancouver Island and its capabilities.
* For the interesting explorations of M. Du Chaillu, see vol. xxxi. of the
Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, page clxxx, &c. ,


On Central America we have had a paper on the republic of Nica-
ragua, by Vice-Consul G. R. Ferry, and another from our Associate
Captain Bedford 'Pirn, proposing a new transit-route across the
American Isthmus through the lake of Nicaragua.
In South America our Associate Mr. Clements Markham, while
engaged in the collection of the cinchona-plant among the moun-
tains of Peru, which were to be transferred to the Himalayas for
cultivation in our Indian possessions, has gathered much geographical
information respecting the head-waters of the Purus, or Madre de
Dios, one of the great affluents of the mighty Amazon, and also of
the geography of the province of Caravaya, in Southern Peru.
From this same region we have a very curious narrative and
illustration of a portion of the country to the south-east of Quito,
sent us by Mr. R. Spruce, accompanied by his own remarks on the
same region of the Quitonian Andes. Dr. Jameson, of the University
of Quito, has given us an account of an excursion from that city to
the Mountain Cayamhe, lying on the Equator.
Australia.? The progress of Australia forms a very important
chapter in the history of man. The rapidity with which exploration
has been followed by colonization is remarkable. Almost all dis-
covery made in this vast country may he said to have been made in
connexion with the extension of its pastoral and commercial capa-
bilities. The many explorations which the Society has encouraged
and recorded since its establishment, have added a new world to the
uses of civilised man. The first paper in its Transactions relates to
the infant days of the Western colony, and its first volumes record
the earliest discoveries of Sturt, Cunningham, and other travellers,
who pushed over the boundaries of its limited Eastern settlements.
How soon these important discoveries were utilized, is familiar
to us all; and in later days, since Eyre and Sturt, our worthy
Medallists, first attempted to traverse the continent from south to
north, the benefits which have accrued from their enterprise have
well justified the awards of the Society. In the last volume of the
Journal is an account of the ascent of the Murray and Darling Rivers,
by Mr. Randell, in a steam-boat. This fact, and the account of the
settlements on the courses of these rivers, is an example of the
importance of these primary explorations.
But the Transactions of the last two years are not of inferior
importance or interest to those adventures detailed in the earliest
volumes of the Society, at a period when the whole continent of
Australia was a field for vague conjecture. In another part of this
Address the wondrous journeys of Burke and Wills, and of McDouall


Stuart, are dilated on, and which, judging from the past, are destined
to have as great an influence on the future of Australia as those of
our early Medallists.
While thus recounting the travels in the Eastern portion of
Australia, we cannot forget the claims of that family of Gregorys
who have so advanced our knowledge of the Western part by their
admirable exploring capabilities. Their merits have been fully
explained in former Addresses, and the last journey of Mr. Frank
Gregory will stand foremost in the ranks of discovery. These topics
have been alluded to previously.
Besides those above, a long array of names may be cited as having
added to our knowledge of Australia in the pages of our Transac-
tions. Among these we have recently those of Wilson, Landor,
Chimmo, Freeling, Hack, Flood, Babbage, Warburton, Sinclair,
MacDonnell, Selwyn, Dempster, Dalrymple, &c. &c. The actual
social benefit which has been and will be derived from their
observations must be very highly estimated.
We have had recently a very excellent account of the Fiji
Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, by Mr. Bensusan, long a resident there,
and by Dr. Ph. Berthold Seemann, whose long experience as a
naturalist has added much to our knowledge of this beautiful group,
as well as of the other countries he has visited. Though there
may be a difference of opinion as to the propriety of our colonising
the Archipelago, there can be none as to the beauty and interest
which belong to the islands themselves.
The Ocean has received some share of attention from our Asso-
ciates. There are many features of marine physics which are still
very obscure, notwithstanding the great accumulation of indepen-
dent observation which has been collected. The depth, the move-
ments, the constitution of the ocean, are each the subject of
controversy, and in each branch of inquiry there is ample field for
individual enterprise.
During the expedition undertaken for ascertaining the practi-
cability of a northern route for an Atlantic telegraph-cable, the
sounding-voyage in the Bulldog , under our Medallist, Sir F. Leopold
M?Clintock, of Arctic celebrity, has given us probably more exact
data on the depth of the ocean than has been before obtained. We
have now accounts of about 260 of these experiments in the North
Atlantic, by which the depth has been stated at from one to four or
seven miles. But many, nay most of these soundings, are open to
very great doubt, and we have yet much to learn as to the depth of
the ocean. In the voyage of the Bulldog , besides the actual evi-


dence of depth given by bringing np the bottom in most cases, there
were some new facts elicited, which, while they overturn much
previous speculation, create a desire for a great extension of the
inquiry. The fact of a live star-fish and a worm brought up from
enormous depths mile), would not have been thought possible
prior to its being demonstrated. Another singular feature is that
the specimens of mud brought up in these high northern latitudes,
consisting almost exclusively of minute organisms, alive , princi-
pally foraminifera, globigerina, &c., are almost identical with those
obtained by the United States officers, Lieut. Craven, U.S.N., &c.,
from great depths within the tropics, beneath the tepid waters of
the Gulf-stream. This demonstrates that there must be a similar
water-climate at each of these distant regions. Therefore the
theory that there is neither light, heat, nor physical conditions
necessary to support animal life at these enormous depths may be
abandoned, and, while it overturns all this, it opens up a new and
vast field for observation and speculation as to the actual consti-
tution and influence which the ocean bears upon the great economy
of nature.
Mr. Hopkins, a name well known to meteorologists, has given us
a Paper on the conditions of the ocean and other topics relating to
the North Pole.
Our Associate Captain Irminger, of the Eoyal Danish Navy, has
given us a very interesting dissertation on the ocean currents in
the vicinity of Iceland, which brings forward several new features.
Another important ocean topic has been also added to by the
observations of Lieut. Heathcote, i.n., f.r.g.s., on the difficult and
complex system of currents in the Bay of Bengal. These are
directly applicable to nautical purposes, and are of much value.
In this summary of the special application of geographical enter-
prise which it has been the sphere of the Eoyal Geographical Society
to disseminate during the last two years, much is necessarily omitted
for want of space. They are special as compared with the great
extent of inquiry open to geographers. In the more extended sense
of general geography, we may notice a paper by that eminent
physical geographer, our [Corresponding Member, Captain M. E.
Maury, on the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Bole. In mathe-
matical geography Colonel Sir Henry James has described his new
projection alluded to in a fox - mor Address, and Sir John Ilerschel
has given us another communication on a similar subject. One
of our Honorary Secretaries, Mr. Spottiswoode, has brought mathe-
YOL. XXXII. ft


matical investigation to bear on the probable conditions of moun-
tain ranges, and has given us another paper on a method of obtaining
longitudes from the moon?s greatest altitude.
Much more might be said as to the influence of the Society in the
acquisition and future dissemination of geographical knowledge
through the wide-spread influence of its numerous Members, of the
cordiality existing among us, and of the many causes to which we
may attribute the present prosperity of the Society.
Having now concluded the Report which the contributions of
various distinguished- geographers have enabled me to lay before
the Society, I may be allowed, perhaps, to say a few words on my
own behalf.
This is my second year of office. Allow me, then, before I leave
the chair, to thank you for the considerate kindness with which
you have dealt with my frequent absences, my many shortcomings.
I resign my office?for I have no doubt of his election?to Sir
Roderick I. Murchison, one whom you have long known, whoso
knowledge and skill and conciliatory power you have long learned
to appreciate. If the Society has increased under me, it has been
owing to his advice, and that of the able Council with which
you surrounded me. It is to their zeal and efficiency, assisted by
our excellent Secretary, Dr. Shaw, that we are indebted for our
growing importance as a public body.
We have, in fact, become a public department, if that appellation
is to be assigned rather to the amount of service rendered than to
the cost incurred. We collect, revise, digest, and amplify all the
geographical information supplied to the various public offices, and
communicated to us. We keep it ready for their use, and for the
use of the merchant, manufacturer, and colonist. We organise and
direct missions of discovery, fitted out for public objects at the
public expense. We have no members of our body hanging on, in a
state of apathy and indifference, for the sake of salary or superan-
nuation. The Council is ever young in zeal and energy, if not in
years. Whatever is done, is done as a labour of love, with the
enthusiasm of votaries. Add to this that the subjects we treat of
are of universal interest, and universal application. They appeal to
all our sympathies, whether of the present, the future, or the past.
Such a Society, so conducted, and so supported, can never fail.
