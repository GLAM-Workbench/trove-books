GOD'S WORLD that is singular.
AND ME that makes it plural.
TWO WORLDS! And of these two worlds the latter is by far
the greater. The former consists of a jumble
of continents, oceans and islands. But the latter consists of
personality, sensation, life. It includes
a BODY, fearfully and wonderfully made;
a SOUL capable of moral splendour; and
a SPIRIT that is of the essence of Deity.
Both these worlds, without God, are like empty houses, silent and forsaken. But with Him, they are like
palaces in which royalty is in residence, every room glowing with light and movement.
And it is to bring God into both of those worlds that this little book is sent forth.
May His choicest benediction attend it! F. W. BOREHAM.

' rc (Dfiank Yo for the
c lo)orld (§o Sweet”
Long, long ago, the world was all darkness! There
was no bright, warm sun, no pale moon, and no twink-
ling stars. There was not one bit of light. But God
wanted to have a lovely world for boys and girls, mothers
and fathers, to live in. There they could be happy.
God thought how He could make this happy world.
★ ★ ★
The first thing God said was, “Let there be light!”
and there was light. God made the sun to come up

warm and bright each day. God saw the sun that it
was good. God called the light time day . When the
sun had gone right across the sky and away to the other

side, it was dark. God called the dark time night, God
knew that some people would have to go about at night,
making long journeys across land and sea. So He made
the silver moon to come up, up, and across the sky at
night. It gave a soft, pale light.

He made the twinkling stars to come out all over
the sky, God saw the moon and stars that they were
good.

At first there were no people on the earth to see the
sun, moon, and stars. There were no people to rest
and sleep in the quiet night. Later on God said, “I will
make fathers and mothers, and children to live in My
world.” He first made a father. Then He made a
mother, then He made children.

God gave them a lovely garden for a home. They
worked and played in it during the friendly day time.
The bright sun kept them warm. When quiet night
came, father and mother and children rested. They
w r ent to sleep. The pale moon and twinkling stars
watched over them all through the night time.

The first father told the children that God had made
the beautiful world and every tiling in it for them. Every
morning they thanked God for the bright sky and the
lovely earth. Every evening they thanked Him for the
quiet night, when they could rest and sleep. 4

(Jesus
and (jod’s c lo)orld
When Jesus was a boy. He loved the beautiful world
God made. When He played on the flat roof of His
home He watched the sun come up, up in the sky, touch-
ing the flowers and trees with its sunbeams, and helping
them to grow. He saw the twinkling stars come out one
by one in the sky at night.

No doubt He often went out with His little friends
to play on the hills, and to pick the wildflowers wdiich
grew amongst the grass. Perhaps, as they rested under
a shady tree, a woolly lamb went walking along the path.
We can think of Jesus saying, Look at this friendly
lamb. Its woolly coat will help to give us a warm coat
to wear when it is cold. lam glad God, my Father,
made the lambs.
★ ★ ★
Perhaps, too, some birds came flying through the
air and rested on the branches of a tree. We can think
of them singing sweet songs to one another. Their
songs would make Jesus happy, and He would say,
Listen to the birds. God taught them to sing.

Jesus often stayed at the seaside. He watched the
rippling waves come on to the shore, and run back
again. He watched the great waves come crashing in
when the wind blew hard. Jesus loved the sea.

When
Jesus grew up, He and His fishermen friends
out in their boat, and sailed over the lovely
often went
sea.
One morning He went to the beach early. His
fishermen friends were coming back in their boat.
Jesus lit a little fire and said, Bring some of the fish
you have caught in the sea, and we will have breakfast
together. How happy He and His friends were, eating
the lovely fresh fish from the sea!

One day, Jesus and His friends were out on the
mountain side. Nearby a farmer had ploughed his field,
and was sowing seeds in the soft earth. As Jesus
watched, He remembered that God His Father made
every little seed lie in its earth cradle, till the rain and
sun helped it to grow up.
★ ★ ★
Then He saw a flock of birds fly down amongst
the grass. They were finding little seeds and grubs to
eat. On the hillside Jesus saw patches of red and blue.
They were the lovely wild flowers that grew there. He
remembered that no one had planted them or watered
them. But God had sent wind, rain, and sun to help
the little seeds grow into lovely flowers. While Jesus
was watching these things, many people came around.
Jesus knew some were sad because they worried about

their food and clothes. Jesus said, Look at the birds.
God My Father has given them the food they need.
Look at the flowers. God has given them their lovely
clothes. Each one has all it needs. God My Father
made the birds and flowers, and He cares for them all.
He made you, and cares for von much more even than

He cares for the birds and flowers. Trust Him, and
He will give YOU all yon need.
★ ★ ★
When we plant seeds in the ground, God sends
His rain and sun to make them grow into food for us.
Animals share their coats that we may he warm. Big
trees give us wood with which to build strong homes to
keep us warm and safe. God gives lIS every day what
we need.

A THANK YOU PRAYER
Dear God, 1 thank You
For the blue of the shy and the sea,
For the lovely colours of the flowers,
And the care You have for me.
Dear God, I thank You
For the birds that sweetly sing,
For my animal friends,
And Your love in everything.
