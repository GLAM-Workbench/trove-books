THE IMMIGRANTS PROSPECTS
WESTERN 'AUSTRALIA.
Its Origin.
Western Australia, otherwise known as the Swan
River settlement includes all that portion of Australia
situated to the westward of 122� of East longitude.
It is 17 times larger than England and Wales, and
contains 1,000,000 square miles, or 010,000,000 acres.
It was first visited by the Dutch. In 1826 it was
first occupied hy a detachment of the 39th regiment.
Latfr on the British Government projected a scheme
to colonise it, each settler was to receive forty 7 acres
of land for every �3 he chose to invest. Children
also were allowed so many acres. Captain Stirling
received the appointment of lieutenant-governor
with a grant of two hundred thousand acres on con-
dition that he should take over with him 400 emi-
grants. In 1829, they landed at the Swan River?
hy the end of the year the number swelled to 1,300
?they were mostly small capitalists and tradesmen
totally unaccustomed to manual labour. It was a
country never yet tilled or cultivated hy the hand of
man, and the difficulties to contend with were im-
mense. A general depression prevailed, and many
left without giving it a fair trial. A. new element'
was then imported into the colony, for it became a
penal settlement. The prospects of the Colony im-
mediately began to brighten for the convicts brought
with them the skilled individual labour requisite for
the construction of roads, bridges, houses, and every 7
kind of public work necessary for the success and
prosperity of the Colony. Between 1850 and 1860
over 5,000 prisoners were landed into Western
Australia, and double that number of free persons?
the relatives and friends of the convicts. After a
while it ceased to become a settlement for convicts,
although in the first instance they seemed necessary
for the developemeut of its resources. The capital
of the Colony is Perth, with a population of 7,000.
Free ft rants ui' Laud.
Western Australia actually makes the passenger,
without any cost to himself, a land owner, engaging to
present him on some easy conditions �f improvement
and settlement with the fee simple of the piece of
land, of from 25 to 150 acres, on which he may have
chosen to have fixed his humble cottage. .Here is a
chance for the future ! It is a mistake for a poor
man to remain in England, where everything is so
stationary. He should calculate in whart dh 7 ection
emigration is likely to set in ; Western Australia is
bound to be one of these ; let him then make no
delay in proceeding thither ; the first incomers get
the best prizes ; every one who goes subsequently
will tend to make the allotments of the settlers
more and more valuable ; in this way, many
thousand acres in our colonies, once not thought
worth more than ss. per acre, have, in a few years
become as valuable as the same quantity of land
would be in Kent or Surrey; and the once poor
men who acquired these tracts of land as free allot-
ments, or bought them for a few shillings per acre,
and have made them valuable by their own labour,
and watched the continually increasing increment
to their value year aftei year by the spread of pop-
ulation, the opening up of roads and railways, and
the allocation of ne,v townships; these men might
now be considered the aristocracy of the new
country :?it is they who take the lead in all matters
relating to the land of their adoption, who make
and administer its laws, whose wise enactments
and provisions in their respective colonial legisla-
tures, provide free education as the inherent right
of every child ; and who induce those same colonial
Governments to provide free Emigration, which
adds to the prosperity of the colony and of the
mother country as well; and especially makes' a
new man of the poor emigrant, by conferring on
him the opportunity of partaking of the blessings
of freedom, plenty, pure air, wholesome and well-
paid employment, and the sure prospect of rising in
his circumstances in the new country which he has
chosen.
They are no true friends to the poor man, but
are only consulting their own selfish interests, who
say to him ? be content with your present position.?
Progress is the universal law which all must obey
or die; there is no standing still in nature. I say
? never be content with your position; always try
to improve it.? It is your right, and your duty, to
try and improve your circumstances. And you cannot
do so at home to any extent. The impediments in the
way of a man?s advancement are too many, and the
rewards of faithful labour too paltrv. In Western
Australia pre-eminently a working man can claim
and obtain the due reward of steady labour ; there
ho can materially improve his condition, and raise
himself to competency, and, above all be relieved
from the gloomy prospect of the workhouse in his
declining years, and anxiety for his children, whose
prospects are illimitable in that excellent territory.


Advantages.
In describing the advantages of any colony as a
desirable place where steady and industrious people
may greatly improve their condition, I would make
a great distinction between such pursuits as gold-
digging or diamond-seeking on the one hand, and
agricultural or pastoral pursuits on the other. The
former partakes more of a lottery; a lucky few
make fortunes, the many are unsuecessful ; a sudden
rush occurs, and thousands of men encamp in some
wild district where they are in danger of starvation
at first, because there has been no provision made
to feed such numbers coming unexpectedly; bye
and bye the place is as suddenly deserted for a rush
to some other locality; neither the colony nor the
gold digger is permanently benefitted, except the
lucky few who carry off their riches elsewhere.
Many of the unlucky gold-seekers, it is true, lose in
time the fascination of that pursuit, and turn their
industry to better account in the slow but sure pur-
suit of wealth by agriculture, or some well remuner-
ated handicraft. Now, such a colony as Western
Australia, while it does not hold out the expectation
of making a fortune offhand in an enormous nugget,
yet, I say it advisedly, docs hold out the prospect of
? all prizes and no blanks ? to every industrious
emigrant. An opportunity is given him to
improve his condition most materially. Take the
case of a poor labourer in England ; his condition
is somewhat improved to what it was some years
ago ; yet he still has to support himself and family
on 16s. or 18s. a week. Let us grant such a
man in these days of education, has sufficient know-
ledge of Geography to know a little about the
colonies, sufficient knowledge of Arithmetic to
be able to calculate the cost �f transferring
himself thither; suppose too he fairly estimates
the immediate and prospective advantages held out
to him; and, being both wise and brave, and
shrewd as well as adventurous, finally resolves to
take his wife and children, and settle in this Land
of Promise. This is acting like a sensible long-
headed man?one who has learned the Catechism
of his younger days to some purpose, and studied it
with some discrimination as well; for though bo
has learned to ? do his duty ? in the state of life
which God has placed him in, he is yet determined
by God?s help to raise himself above that state, and
improve that condition ; and the feeling of ? lowly
reverence? for his ?betters? is apt to become
merged into a noble self-reliance and self-conscious-
ness of the dignity of manhood, and the honour of
labour. So he makes up his mind to go to a land
where labour is scarcer, more desirable, held in
higher honour, and well remunerated; where no
stigma attaches to toil; where there are no restric-
tions individiously placed upon industry; where the
soft-handed and soft-headed young man who tries
to escape the primeval decree to labour is despised ;
where honour, fame, reward, and fortune is the
meed of hardworking, and steady persevering toil.
Our hero then applies to the Emigration Agent, who
will afford him every information, and assistance.
The cost of passage is �l6 at least for each adult,
we will suppose we see him, his wife and little
ones, on board the good ship Southern Cross (say).
Now this is the worst aspect of emigration, a long
sea voyage with a young family. Yet it is not half
so bad as in the anticipation. The Children want
looking after, but the father and mother have
nothing else to do on board. Captain, crew, and
fellow-passengers unite in showing every help and
kindness to the little ones : they escape entirely the
qualms of sea-sickness, which often inflicts a few
days misery on adults ; every comfort which is
available is afforded them; finally, with minds ex -
panded and intelligence awakened by the experience
of the voyage, we will suppose them safely landed at
Perth, on the Swan River, the Capital of the Colony.
Here the ship and the depot where the emigrants are
lodged on landing, are besieged by employers in
quest of hands : there is not the slightest difficulty
in obtaining employment at double the rate the
labourer obtained at home. Clothing is at present a
little dearer than in England, but food, especially
mutton and beef, very much cheaper. So if this
were the sole advantage of the change, I hold that
the emigrant would have done well by exchanging
abject dependence, contumely and oppression?for
health, liberty, an honorable position, and certainly
of future competency: social degradation and the
workhouse for the proud position the pioneers of
colonization obtain in the new country, as the land-
owners and aristocracy of the incipient state whose
settlements and investments in land, etc., will
every day become more and more valuable by the
arrival of future immigrants.
Climate.
The climate of Western Australia is one of the
most delightful in the world. The regularity of the
sea breezes in the summer counteracts the power of
the sun. It is essentially a dry climate and most
beneficial to all suffering from consumption or
bronchial affections. No disease can be said to pre-
vail and epidemics are unknown. The average mean
temperature throughout the year is 65�. In the
months of July and August there are sometimes
sharp hoar frosts, but these disappear immediately
after sunrise. Snow is unknown. Flowers and
fruits from all parts of the world can be cultivated
with success and at almost any season of the year.
Our vegetables grow to great perfection there.
Oranges, apples, peaches, pears, nectarines, apricots,
figs, almonds, bananas and pomegranates, the olive
and the mulberry grow in great abundance, as also
strawberries in the southern districts. The vine is
cultivated to perfection, the raisins produced from it
being the finest in the world.
The Chief Products
Are wheat, oats, hay and timber, locally known as
jarrah, a species of mahogany and the sandal wood
tree. The capabilities of the soil for corn growing
are best known by the fact that the first prize at the
Intercolonial Exhibition was awarded to a sample of
wheat grown on the Swan river.
To the east of the Darling Range of mountains
lies the best land for agricultural purposes. Large
tracts of fertile country for grazing purposes have
also been discovered north of the Darling Range,
and have been well stocked. The timber of the
country is magnificent?Mr. Weld thus describes it:
?? Western Australia, as far as I have seen, is
covered with one vast forest, stretching far away
into regions yet unexplored. A very large propor-
tion of this is heavy timber country. The jarrah,
sometimes erroneously called mahogany, a tree of
Eucalyptus tribe, covers immense tracts of land ; its
timber is extraordinarily durable, and as it resists
the white ant and ? Teredo navalis,? it is admirably
adapted for railway sleepers, and for piles for bridges
and harbour works. This timber, when properly
seleeted and seasoned, has stood the severest tests,
and no term has yet been discovered to its durability.
It is hoped that, with increased facilities for trans-
port, the trade in jarrah may indefinitely increase.
The sandalwood already affords an export ; the tuart


and kari, both Eucalypti of enormous size, are
valuable timber trees. In southern districts I have
ridden for miles amongst kari trees, some of which,
lying on the ground, I have ascertained by actual
measurement, to reach 150 feet to the lowest branch ;
many, I estimate, when standing, to attain nearly
double the height from the ground to the topmost
branch, thus emulating the great Californian
? Wellingtonia,? the kauri {Damnara Australis ) of
New Zealand, or the great Eucaplytus Purpurea of
Tasmania, a kindred tree, reported on by Sir W.
Denison ; the difference being that these instances
are of rare and exceptional growth, whilst in parts
of this country there are forests of these giants of
the vegetable world.
There is a steady demand for the jarrah wood for
the Indian railways, owing to its exceeding
durability, and several companies have a line of
tramway from the forest to the coast, and are
employed in felling, sawing, and preparing it for
piles or sleepers. It has become one of the most
lucrative exports of the Colony. Next in importance
comes its splendid sandal ?wood, largely imported
into China, where it is in great request tor making
ornamental cabinets and ingenious nick nacks. The
other principal exports are wool, lead, copper ore,
whale oil, guano, pearls, and pearl shells.
Wool.
But the most valuable and universal article of pro-
duction in this colony is the wool of its innumerable
flocks. No country in the world is superior in its
capability and fitness for keeping sheep, and of no
other pursuit have Australian adventurers succeeded
in such numbers in making their fortunes. Hun-
dreds of instances might be adduced of a poor
emigrant landing in the country with no other
capital than strong hands and a stout heart, having
in a few years become a wealthy squatter, leasing a
run of 10,000 or 20,000 acres of land, possessing
thousands of sheep and cattle, and living like a
patriarchal prince. These men are often to be seen
paying a visit to the old country, for they still have
an affection for the land of their birth, though they
rarely forsake the land of their adoption ; the free
untrammelled life they have so long enjoyed renders
the mode of existence here insipid and irksome.
The pursuit of sheep farming is indeed a far surer
road to wealth than the search for gold which is so
precarious and arduous. Or rather it is a far surer,
pleasanter, and often speedier mode of obtaining
the much coveted metal ; for the poor gold seeker
would be thought exceptionally fortunate if he once
found a nugget equal in value to the produce of one
season?s sheep-shearing of one of these princely
squatters. There is every facility for a poor man
becoming speedily a rich one by sheep farming if he
has only the money to buy a few sheep to start
with?provided, of course, that he is steady and
persevering.
Not only is the wool sent to England, but a new
industry in connection with sheep farming has
lately sprung up?that of preparing for our market
preserved mutton. This trade is increasing enor-
mously, to the mutual advantage of consumer and
producer.
Trade and Commerce.
Geographe Bay, on the shores of which are several
incipient towns ?besides Busselton and Bunbury?
is rapidly rising into commercial importance. The
Western Australian Timber Company (Limited) has
erected saw mills here, as well as laid down a rail-
way between their works and the great forests of ?
?Jarrah? timber on the Darling Mountains, 15
miles distant. They are able to supply merchants
with any quantity of this valuable timber, which is
coming into use in England, for positions where
extreme durability is required, being impervious by
teredo navalis, or by any insect; in fact, indistruct-
ible, except by fire.
The exports of the produce of the mines is sent
mostly to England, but lead and copper ores have
also been sent to Singapore and Batavia. When
the undoubtedly great mineral wealth of the Vic-
toria District is more developed, it appears evident
that this- portion will be the richest and most
important.
An active traffic has long been maintained between
this colony and the Mauritius; to the latter sheep,
bullocks, and potatoes are largely exported. Sandal-
wood, which is very abundant, is exported to Singa-
pore and China. The fig, olive, and vine are largely
grown in certain localities, and fruits, oil, and wine
have been exported, but not yet on a very extensive
scale. The harvest is indeed plenteous, but the lab-
ourers have been too few. It does not always pay a
merchant to send his ship to collect a cargo in various
places ; when produce of this kind, for which the
demand is unlimited, is prepared on a larger scale, by
the increasing number of settlers, then the commerce
of the colony will receive a great and permanent
impetus. Good wheat and barley thrive in the utmost
perfection; as does also maize or Indian corn, and
there is no reason why cotton, sugar, tobacco, arrow-
root, raisins, currants, oranges, lemons, banana, &c.,
should not thrive as well in the warmer latitudes of
this colony, as they do in New South Wales and
Queensland. English fruits which require a cooler
climate, as strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries,
&c., do best on the southern part of the colony, and
on the hills.
The Mineral Resources
Of Western Australia are as yet imperfectly de-
veloped. Mr. Charles Eden states that ? though
gold in payable quantities has not yet been discovered
both lead and copper form a valuable item of export.
Both these minerals exist in large quantities, particu-
larly in the northern districts. During the year
1875, 2,289 tons of lead ore were exported, and there
is no doubt of its existence throughout an area com-
prising many hundreds of square miles, in parts of
which it crops up to the surface. This is exclusive
of the extreme northern territory, where large quan-
tities of ore, yielding on an average over 30 per cent,
of pure metal, are reported to have been found on
the surface. Want of capital, and the expense of
transport seem the principal drawbacks to the de-
velopment of the mineral wealth undoubtedly
possessed by Western Australia, but in time both
these obstacles will probably be overcome.
The next principal feature of lucrative industry is
the pearl and pearl shell fishery. We give an
account from the ?Australian Handbook? :
?In 1874 fifty-four ships and one hundred and
thirty-five boats were engaged in it. The value of
shells exported in 1872 was �25,890, against �12,895
worth exported in the previous year, and the esti-
mated value of pearls and pearl-shells sent from the
Colony in 1874, representing the take of the season,
is about �72,162. The exports during 1875 were
valued at �65,000. The natives are employed as
divers, and work for a moro subsistence ; but owing
to the stringent laws existing forthe protection of the
aborigines, most of the pearling-craft ?in fact, all
who can?cmploy Malays, whom they bring, under
an agreement for a term of years, from the Coro-
mandel coast and Java. Greater security has lately


been demanded on behalf of the Malays, for their
return on expiration of service, which is likely to
stop the demand. The Dutch Government required
a deposit of 200 guilders per head, previous to hiring
to insure their protection. These men are paid at a
rate varying from one to two pounds per month, are
kept free of charge, and returned to their native
country on the expiration of their service. They are
considered less expert divers than the natives;
nevertheless, a diver will frequently bring up about
301bs. weight of shells after one dive. The value of
shells in the colony averages from �7 to �8 per cwt.
These shells, the home of the meleagrina margaritifcra ,
weigh on the average about 21bs, per pair, and mea-
sure from six to ten inches in diameter. It is to
their intrinsic commercial value rather than to the
the pearls they contain, that the north-west fisheries
owe their importance, although, occasionally pearls
of considerable value are obtained?one, supposed to
be worth upwards �15,000, having been found re-
cently. Another lucrative fishery exists in Shark?s
Bay, a large inlet, extending in a south-easterly
direction from Dirk Hartog?s Island, about the 25th
degree of south latitude to a distance of 150 miles.
The shells found in this region are those of the true
pearl oyster, the avicula margaritifcra , an oyster only
slightly larger than its European congener, and
valuable from the pearls it bears. The shells have
lately been introduced into the European market,
and have assumed considerable commercial value.
The other fisheries, which produced in 1872 value
to the extent of �2,248, are the whale and miscel-
laneous fisheries. Hitherto the whale fishery has
been conducted by vessels which come all the dis-
tance from Boston and other ports in the north of
the United States. Lately, however, the industry
has been prosecuted with success by a few vessels,
the property of local speculators, in consequence of
the large results of American enterprise in this
industry.?
Social Conditions.
With regard to the religion of the colony there is
almost every denomination existing, as in England
the Roman Catholics are numerous. The whole
colony constitutes a Church of England diocese,
governed by the see of Perth, in which city is tho
Bishop?s residence. Tho ?Australian Handbook?
has the following paragraph under the head of
Education.
? The educational system is framed under the
clauses of the Education Act of 1870, which is based
upon the principles of the Act now in force in the
mother country. By this Act schools are divided
into Elementary and Assisted. The former are
maintained wholly at the cost of the colony ; the
latter are private, but a capitation grant is given on
condition of submitting to government inspection for
secular results, and to the observance of a strict con-
science clause during the four hours of secular in-
struction insisted on by the Act. The Elementary
Schools are under the control and supervision of a
Central Board and the Local District Boards. The
Central Board, consisting of five members, laymen,
no two of whom can be of the same religious denomin-
ation, is appointed by the governor, and the Local
District Boards are elected by the general body of
electors for three years. Compulsory attendance of
children can be enforced by the Local Boards. In
the Elementary schools four hours a day are devoted
to secular instruction, and one hour, under the pro-
visions of a conscience clause, to reading the Bible,
or other religious books approved of by the Board ;
but no catechism or religious formulary of any kind
may be used; and the Bible, if read, must be read
without note or comment. The school fees vary from
2d. to Is. per week, according to the circumstances
of the parents. On December 31st, 1874, there
wore 67 Elementary Schools, and 18 Assisted Schools,
making 85 in all, with an annual aggregate attendance
of about 3,000. The attendance at the Elementary
Schools was 2,530 : 1,391 boys, and 1,139 girls. A
Government Inspector makes periodical visits to the
schools, National and Assisted, throughout the
colony; and the salaries of teachers of the schools
established and conducted under the new system are
dependent upon the report of regularity of attend-
ance, and proficiency on the part of the scholars.
The Roman Catholics have admirable educational
establishments throughout the colony. Some of
their schools, coming within the provisions of the
Educational Act of 1870, are subsidised or 1 assisted ?
by the Government. The Catholics have, also, two
independent schools in Perth, and one in Fremantle,
conducted by the Sisters of St. Joseph. Several
private Protestant seminaries for young ladies have
been established from time to time, and some of them
still exist, and are comparatively flourishing.?
The Charitable Institutions of Western Australia
consists of eight hospitals, one lunatic asylum, two
poor-houses, two native institutions, a Protestant
orphanage, and a Roman Catholic orphanage.
The natives of this colony need no particular
mention, being in their habits similar to the tribes
found elsewhere, and described in a former chapter
on this subject. Both the Protestant and Roman
Catholic Churches have made strenuous efforts to
reclaim them. The latter have an agricultural
establishment on which the natives are employed and
found useful. There is also a Protestant school under
the control of the Bishop, where it is sought tu train
the children in Christian knowledge and civilised
habits.?

During the last few years Western Australia has
made rapid progress. The large tracts of pasture
lands, the vast forests of valuable timber, the pro-
lific mines, and the successful pearl fisheries, all
combine to make it attractive to a steady, indus-
trious, and persevering man.


4 oiii|turisoii with other Colonies.
Each of our splendid colonies in Australasia and
America has its peculiar advantages and attractions,
hut on a fair review of all them, for the hardy and
industrious man who intends to pursue some
settled employment, as agriculture, sheep farming,
or cattle rearing ; as well as for the mechanic whose
work is in great demand in the colony, as the car-
penter, the wheel-wright, the bricklayer, &c., there
is not one of the colonies offers a better combination
of advantages as Western Australia. With regard
to Canada the climate is severe, and the labour
of clearing the forests formidable and discour-
aging; the other Australian colonies are rather
too hot to be pleasant, especially during the hot
winds, and suffer much occasionally from di-ought.
In Western Australia the rains are sufficient, though
the air is dry-; the long droughts which make
farming so precarious elsewhere are unknown ; the
climate is delightful and more unexceptionally salu-
brious than that of any of equal size in Australia.
At Albany, on King George?s Sound, the mean
annual temperature is 60 degrees; at York, on the
upper portion of the Swan River, in the interior, it
is 65 degrees. It is true that sometimes in the
middle of the summer the thermometer has been
known to stand as high as 105 degrees in the shade ;
but being unaccompanied by 7 the great moisture, as
in India, which renders great heat so unhealthy, this
is found very 7 tolerable; especially 7 as the land and
sea-breezes are in constant motion, and the mornings
and evenings are uniformly cool and pleasant. The
quantity of rain which falls averages about 32 inches
the same as in England, to the climate of which it
approximates more nearly than does that of either of
the other colonies.
Progress of the Colony.
The history of Western Australia up to the year
1850, contains little of interest, for it is but the
account of a settlement struggling for bare exist-
ence, as up to that period it presented the aspect of
a colony without sufficient capital to render available
its natural resources, and with a scanty population.
Up to that year the position of Western Australia
was an anomaly in the history of colonization, as
never had been a colony 7 so thoroughly impoverished,
and y 7 et lingered on; this principally arose from the
want of a market, and the high rate of the small
amount of available labour. Immigration had ceased,
and the only capital introduced was a small amount
of Imperial expenditure, and the equally small
returns for exports. Shortly after this period the
colonists petitioned the Home Government to make
Swan River a convict settlement; this request was
promptly 7 acceded to, and shiploads of these enforced
exiles were landed in the colony 7. In the nine years
between 1850 and 1859, during which period Captain
Fitzgerald (August 1848, to June, 1855), and Mr.
Kennedy (now Sir Arthur Kennedy, and Governor of
Queensland (June, 1855, to February 17th, 1862)
had been Governors, there were introduced 5,169
convicts, and in addition, 6,364 persons, many of
them families of prisoners. As the evil effects of
convictism were feared hy the other colonies, they
appealed to the Home authorities to discontinue
transportation tq West Australia. After some little
skirmishing the point was carried, and in 1868
transportation ceased altogether, to the infinite
benefit, moral at least, not alone of the colony, but
of the whole of Australia. At the time when the
transportation of convicts from England ceased,
Western Australia had absorbed ten thousand
prisoners ; and undesirable as such a class of im-
migrants as this may 7 be, it must be conceded that
since their introduction the colony has progressed
year by 7 year, exports have greatly increased, the
settlers have had a market for their stock and pro-
duce, public works have been constructed, and the
statistics of crime have shown an immunity from
transgression against peace and property 7 that could
hardly have been anticipated. This now is so for-
cibly 7 apparent that the Legislature not very long
ago voted a reduction of the hitherto large police
force, which for years has been in excess of the
colony?s requirements. In February, 1862, Mr. J.
S. Hampton, formerly Comptroller-General of Con-
victs at Tasmania, became Governor, administering
the government to November, 1868 ; being followed
on September 30th, 1869, by Mr. (now Sir) Frederick
Aloy r sius Weld, who held office to December, 1874.
During the interval between Mr. Hampton?s retire-
ment and Mr. Weld?s arrival Lieutenant-Colonel
Bruce was the Acting Governor. During Mr.
Weld?s governorship the colony made a decided ad-
vance ; telegraphic communication .vas established
between the leading centres of population, which is
now extended to South Australia, placing West
Australia in instant communication with the other
colonics and the mother country. In 1870 the colony
was divided into electoral districts, and the election
of members of the Legislature Council took place. A
line of railway 7, the Northern, has been constructed
from Geraldton to Northampton in the Champion
Bay district. The western section of another line,
the ?Eastern,? has been constructed from Fremantle
to Berth, thence to Guildford. This latter extension
was opened on March 2nd, 1881. The surveys of
the second section of this railway are completed for
a distance of 21 miles, going East from Guildford,
and the works are being pushed forward with
despatch ; the Imperial Government having sanction-
ed a loan of �lOO,OOO for the purpose. Since sanc-
tioning the first moiety of the loan for the second
section, the Secretary of State has permitted a second
moiety of �200,000 to be raised for the completion
of the line to the Eastern districts. Immigration,
too, has received encouragement, and a comparatively
large number of workmen and labourers are now
arriving in the colony. Liberal grants of town and
rural lands are made to immigrants, with the view of
inducing permanent occupation and settlement.
Geographical Features.
The south-western portion of the colony was
traversed in 1835 by Surveyor General Roe, who
reports of it: ?? Fully one-fourth, after leaving the
immediate vicinity of the Sound, may be pronounced
good, and excellent; one-third tolerable and avail-
able for some useful purposes ; and the remainder
poor, bad, and useless. The country 7 is well watered.
The great extent of good grassy lands passed over
well adapted it to be depasturage of either horses,
cattle, or sheep, while good soil of a good loamy
character, capable of bearing wheat or any other
crop, is to be met with and in sufficient quantity 7 for
all agricultural purposes in a country essentially
pastural.?
A late Governor (Sir F. A, Weld) thus describes
the principal features of the country
? The whole of the settled district, nearly the
size of France, is usually level, often undulating, but
never mountainous. The western seaboard, com-
paratively flat country, of a sandy character, com-
posed chiefly of the detritus of old coral reefs, which
has boon again deposited by the action of water:
more inland, a formatioa, which is here called


ironstone, is met with; it appears to be chiefly a
conglomerate of disintegrated granite, stained with
iron: granite, slates, quartz, pipeclay, and, in
places, trap, are all found in this country. The
Darling Range, for instance, presents these cha-
racteristics ; it runs from north to south in the
central district inland of Perth, and appears once
to have formed the coast-line. The whole country,
from north to south, excepting the spots cleared for
cultivation, may be described as one vast forest, in
the sense of being heavily timbered: sometimes,
but comparatively seldom, the traveller comes upon
an open plain, covered with shrubs and flowering
plants in infinite variety and exquisite beauty, and
often, especially in the northern and eastern dis-
tricts, low scrubby trees and bushes fill the place of
timber ; but, taking the word ? forest ? in its widest
sense?as wild, woody, and bushy country ?Western
Australia, as far as I have seen, is covered with one
vast forest, stretching far away into regions yet
unexplored. A very large proportion of this is
heavy timber country. The jarrah, sometimes
erroneously called mahogany, a tree of the
Eucalyptus tribe, covers immense tracts of land;
its timber is extraordinarily durable, and as it resists
the white ant and the * Teredo navalis,? it is admir-
ably adapted for railway sleepers, and for piles for
bridges and harbour works. This timber, when
properly selected and seasoned, has stood the severest
tests, and no term has yet been discovered to its
durability. It is believed that, with increased
facilities for transport, the trade in jarrah may be
indefinitely increased. The sandalwood already
affords an export; the tuart and kari trees, both
Eucalypti of enormous size, are valuable timber
trees.?
The country between York and King George?s
Sound was recently roughly surveyed to ascertain
its fitness for railway construction, and is thus
reported of : ??The section of the country under
review is a plateau having a mean surface-level of
about once thousand feet above the sea, though
in places the river beds and valleys below, and
above this general level are found cropping up
ranges and peaks, which, however, with the excep-
tion of the Stirling Range, are not of any con-
siderable height. From this plateau flow all the
principal storm water channels of the southern part
of the Colony, including the Swan River, the upper
portion of which is called the Avon and its branches.
The Murray River, with the Hotham, the Williams
and affluents, break through the Darling Range by
a series of gorges and canons, and empty themselves
into the sea on the western coast. The Blackwood
River, with the Arthur, the Beaufort, and the
Balgarrup, find the sea east of Cape Leeuwin, at
Flinders Bay. The Frankland, with the Gordon as
its main tributary, finds a mouth at Nornalup Inlet,
near King George?s Sound. The physical geography
on this side of the Australian Continent, in respect
to the condition of its rivers or storm water chan-
nels, shows a reverse to those of the Eastern side,
and which are found existing in most other parts
of the globe. The so-called rivers merely serve to
bear away seawards the surplus storm waters from
the by no means unfertile interior which they drain,
which is a belt extending in different parts fifty
miles in width up to a distance of two hundred
miles from the sea. The best land is high up
away from the coast, whilst in other countries the
rivers have made the lowlands fertile by what they
have?_bome from the highlands.? Mr. Forrest says
? There cannot beja* doubt but that the whole of
the country between Beverley and King George?s
Sound is capable of being more beneficially utilised
tban it is at present, and that as population
increases and cultivation is more common a larger
number of people will reside upon the land.?
Interior of the Colony.
Of the interior of the colony there is yet much to
be learned though the labours of explorers are fast
making known its features. In 1874, Colonel War-
burton, after an arduous journey, attended with
much privation and danger, successfully traversed
the colon}?- from Alice Springs, a station on the over-
land telegraph line, to Roebourne, on the sea-coast.
The country is described as being an alternation of
ridges and hollows, sandy, without grass, and
clothed with bushes and scrubby timber, with no
trace of a watercourse ; though, as the party were
sustained by water obtained from native wells, it is
believed probable that this drawback and obstacle to
its settlement may not be quite so serious as might
at first be supposed. Since then Mr. John Forrest,
at the head of a small exploring party, fitted out by
the Government, has succeeded in crossing the con-
tinent into South Australia. No good land was
discovered within a practicable distance. This is the
second time Mr. John Forrest has penetrated into
the southern colonies, having successfully traversed
the southern seaboard from Albany to Adelaide in
1870. In recognition of this achievement the legis-
lature voted him �5OO, and the Royal Geographical
Society presented him with their Gold Medal, and
he, besides, received many foreign distinctions, in-
cluding the Order of Knight of the Crown of Italy.
Mr. Forrest also received the decoration of C.M.G,
last year in consideration of his distinguished
services in the cause of the exploration of Australia.
Beyond the country lying on the lines of route of
these explorations comparatively little is known of
the territory of West Australia outside the seaboard
and the settled districts.
Land Regulations.
The land regulations of the colony are liberal, and
specially adapted to induce settlement. Waste lands
of the Crown in rural districts can be purchased in
blocks of not less than 10 acres at 10s. per acre, or
on occupation license in blocks of not less than 100
acres each, by deferred payment of Is. per acre,
spread over a term of ten years. Town and suburban
lots are sold by auction at stated upset prices. Pas-
torial lands in the Central Land District can be
rented for 14 years at �1 for every 1,000 acres, and
in the Northern, Eastern, Central, and South Eastern
districts in blocks of not less than 20,000 acres on 14
years? leases, at a rental of ss. per 1,000 acres for
the first seven years, and of 10s. per acre for the re-
mainder of the term. In the Kimberley district the
minimum rent is 10s. per 1,000 acres. Water
frontages are leased in blocks of not less than 50,000
acres, non-frontage land can be had in blocks of
20,000 acres. For private land sales and leases the
popular measure known as the ? Torrens Act ? has
been adopted by the Legislature, and has now been
several years in successful operation.
mountains.
Three distinct parallel ranges of mountains form
the most distinguishing features, the highest and
most easterly having its termination near King
George?s Sound, and being called the Blackwood
Range and the Victoria Range. The highest of
these does not exceed 2,000 feet. The Darling and
Roe Range, rising to the height of 1,500 feet to
2,000 feet above the level of the sea, lie parallel to


the western coast, at distances varying from 10 to
25 miles from it. The highest mountain in the
colony is Mount William of the Darling Range. It
is situated in the Murray district, about 60 miles
inland, and has an altitude of 3,000 feet above the
sea-level. No volcanoes, active or extinct, exist in
any part of West Australia.
Rivers.
The principal rivers in West Australia are the
Swan River, with its tributary, the Canning ; the
Avon, the Fitzroy, the Glenelg, the De Grey,
Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoigne,
Murchison, Irwin, Moore, Murray, Preston, Capel,
Blackwood, Warren, Gordon, and the Collie. Few
of these run all the year, and still fewer are navig-
able, even for boats, for any great distance, but on
most of them settlements have been formed.
Lakes,
There are no lakes of any size, but there are
numerous shallow lagoons in various localities:
among them are Lake Moore, Great Salt Lake,
Lake Brown, Lake Amsdeus, of unknown extent,
and Lake McDermott, and Monger?s, and Herds-
man?s Lakes in the Perth District.
Character of Land.
The soil consists of vast tracts of sand and scrub,
which is of little value ; of much land suitable for
sheep-grazing purposes, and for farming operations ;
and of extensive areas that will yet become available
for the growth of the sugar cane and other tropical
productions. The eastern side of the Roe and
Darling Ranges is especially suitable for the grazier
and farmer. In the north, too, there are extensive
grassy downs, capable of depasturing vast numbers
of sheep and cattle. On the Lower Greenhough
River one flat alone contains 10,000 acies of very fine
land, giving, with very slight cultivation, 30 bushels
of wheat to the acre. The presence of poisonous
plants, however, is one of the greatest drawbacks in
some parts of the country to stock raising. The
greater extent of the seaboard is separated from the
interior by low ranges of hills, running parallel to it
and covered with forests, principally of jarrah.
The fertile land exists in patches, and some of it is
of a very rich character. On the whole, the soil may
be said to possess immense productive powers under"
favourable circumstances. It is proposed to intro-
duce the Buffalo grass, in order to utilize gradually
the sandy tracts. Couch (or Doob) grass has been
largely introduced for paddocks. It thrives abun-
dantly, grows upon the poorest of soils, and in the
hottest and driest weather affords substantial pastur-
age. Inmany parts ot the bush it is now growing
without the intervention of artificial culture.
Geology.
A central North and South range of Palseozoic
rocks, with intrusive masses of granite, traverses the
Colony. This granite rises in isolated hills in some
parts, in others it spreads into plateaus ; beyond and
around the range is the tertiary sandstone, which
forms the vast arid tracts of sand which constitute a
considerable portion of the surface of West Australia.
The coast consists of coralline sand. In the S.W.,
near the coast, are some beds of mesozoic limestone.
In the North trap-rocks occur, with columns of
basalt and greenstone, and near Shark?s Bay are
evidences of volcanic action. The Rev. C. G. Nico-
lay thus generally describes the geological features
of the colony :?? Upon an undulating surface of
granitoidal rocks, passing, as is common elsewhere,
into gneiss and other forms of metamorphic rock,
have been deposited strata, for the most part horizon-
tal, of sandstones and limestones, the greatest thick-
ness of which does not probably in any place exceed
700 feet. These form flat-topped ranges, and by
process of denudation and consequent separation
from the mass, detached peaks and peaked hilis,
which are characteristic features of the country over
a large portion of its area.?
Products.
Flowers and fruits from all parts of the world
flourish luxuriantly. The vegetables of England
grow to-great perfection, and may be cultivated at
almost any season of the year. In summer oranges,
apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums,
figs, almonds, bananas, and pomegranates grow
abundantly. Strawberries, also, grow well in the
southern districts. Both climate and soil are admir-
ably adapted for the cultivation of the grape, and
the number of vineyards is increasing yearly, as is
also the amount of colonial made wine consumed in
the colony and exported. The olive, wherever cul-
tivated, grows luxuriantly ; and during the last few
years sericulture has been successfully and profitably
attempted. Bees thrive, and produce honey in
astonishing quantities. The increase of the swarms
which from time to time have escaped from the tame
Lives has peopled the uncultivated bush with numer-
ous colonies, whose treasures afford to fhe aborigines
an aid to subsistence. The agricultural canabilities
of the colony are extensive, and the breadth of land
under crop has within the last few years greatly
increased. Portions of the country, 'especially in
the east and northern districts, are admirably
adapted for wheat growing, and corn grown on the
Swan took the first prize at the Intercolonial Exhi-
bition held in Sidney, N.S.W., in 1873. But for
the ravages of ?red-rust ? large quantities of corn
would have been exported. The indigenous trees
comprise the jarrah ( eucalyptus marginata), tuart, or
white gum [eucalyptus gomphochephala), sandal-wood
[iantalum persicarivm) , karri [eucalyptus colossea ), a
species of acacia known as the raspberry-jam tree
from its peculiar scent, the red and blue gum and
kindred trees, casuarina, various kinds of banksia,
shea-oak and wattle, the bark of the latter possessing
good tanning properties. It has been estimated that
the forest trees cover approximately the following
areas: Wbite gum, 13,000 square miles; jarrah,
14,000 square miles; karri, 2,300 square miles;
tooart, 500 square miles ; York gum, 2,400 miles.
Animals.
These arc much the same as in the other cc lonics,
and comprise the kangoroo, the opossum, wombat,
bandicoot, and others marsupial animals and the
native dog or dingo, and cat. The dingo is the
terror of sheep farmers, whose flocks he ravag'es ;
some of the agricultural societies give a reward for
its destruction, strychnine is largely used on many
stations. Birds of the cockatoo species are numerous.
Emus, swans, bush turkeys, eagle-hawks, and other
large birds are met with far inland. There are
several kinds of snakes, many of them poisonous.
The waters that wash the West Australian coasts
abound in fish; whales, sharks, dugongs, and
alligators are also found. It is stated that some
forms of animal life in this colony are peculiar,
presenting curious and anomalous forms which seem
to be remnants of an ancient world.
Population.
By the census returns on the night of April 3,
1881, the population, exclusive of aborigines, num-
bered 29,7 08?17,062 males, 12,646 females. At the


previous census of 1870 the population was 24,785 ?
15,375 males, and 9,410 females. From April 3, to
December 1, 1881, the births were G81?362 males,
and 319 females ; the deaths were 297?199 males,
and 98 females. The number of marriages during
1881 was 167. The numbers cf dwellings is recorded
at 5,271, the average number of persons to each
being 5 - 64. Of these dwellings 2,129 were of brick,
1,607 of stone, 1,458 of wood, 12 of iron, and 65 of
other material. The number of the persons to the
square mile is *O2, equal to nearly three persons to
every 100 square miles of the whole colony. The
ago of the people were?Children under five years,
4,141; between five and ten, 3,725; ten and under
fifteen, 3,546 ; between 15 and 21, 3,626; between
21 and 25, 2,034 ; 25 and under 30, 1,951 ; 30 and
under 35, 1,5151 35 and under 40, 1,681; 40 and
under 45, 1,772; 45 and under 50, 1,726; 50 and
under 55, 1,437; 55 and under 60, 914; 60 and
under 65, 782 , 65 and under 70, 356 ; 70 and under
75, 241 ; 75 and under 80, 100 ; 80 and upwards,
54. As regards the con j ugal condition of the people,
there 8,251 married, i ,947 widowed, and 20,410
unmarried. The husbands numbered 4,275 ; wives,
3.976 ; widowers, 539 ; widows, 508. The birth-
places of the people are thus given :?Natives of
West Australia, 17,773; England and Wales, 6,760;
Scotland, 732 ; Ireland, 2,975 ; other British posses-
ions, 695 ; foreign states, 647. The occupations of
the people are specified as follows Professional,
(including civil servants, municipal, police and
school officers), 483 ; learned professions, 190.
A (novermnent Oiler.
The Government have offered a bonus of �2,000
and a further sum of �2 per ton for the first thousand
tons, making �5,000 in all, to any firm or company
who shall erect smelting works in or near North-
ampton, capable of smelting 1,000 tons of pig lead
within one year from tho date of establishment.
The Pearl Fishery.
The pearl fishery year by year, becomes of more
value to the colony. The value of shells exported in
1872 was �25,890, against �12,895 worth exported
in the previous year, and the estimated value of
pearls and pearl shells sent from the colony in 1874,
representing' the lake of the season, was about
�72,162. The exports for the following years were
�65,000; 1876, �74,143 ; 1877, �12,450 ; and 1878,
�24,000 ; 1870, �96,525 ; 1880, �40,710 shells ;
�12,000 pearls; 1881, �34,912 10s. shells; �15,000
pearls. These values arc, however, estimated upon
somewhat uncertain data. It is probable that the
stated value of tho pearls exported exceeded this
amount. The aboriginal natives are now almost
exclusively employed in diving, the cost of introduc-
ing the Malay divers being too great. The value of
shells in the colony averages from �5 10s. to �8 per
cwt., or even higher. These shells, the home of the
rmleagrina tnargaritifera , weigh on the average about
21bs. per pair, and measure from six to ten inches in
diameter. It is to the intrinsic commercial value of
the shells, rather than the pearls they contain, that
the north-west fisheries owe their importance ; al-
though, occasionally, pearls of considerable value are
obtained?one supposed to be worth upwards of
�1,500 was found in 1875 ; in 1878 one was found
weighing forty grains at Shark?s Bay ; and another
one weighing 234 grains, obtained at Nikol Bay,
realized �715. A lucrative pearl fishery exists in
Shark?s Bay, a large inlet, extending in the south-
easterly direction from Dirk Hartog?s Island, about
the 25th degree of south latitude, to a distance of
150 miles. In 1882 a rich bank of pearl shells some
15 milrs in length was discovered in the vicinity of
Buaglu Bay. The shells found in this region arc
those of t rue pearl oyster, the avicula margorWfcra
an oyster only slightly larger than its European
congener, and valuable from the pearls it hears.
The shells have been introduced to the European
and Indian markets, hut have assumed no consider-
able commercial value as yet. The fishing season of
1881 was a fairly successful one, hut no satisfactory
returns have been received of the quantities pro-
cured. The other fisheries, which produced in 1877
value to the extent of �23,808 10s., were the whale
and miscellaneous fisheries. In the official statistics
published for 1881 no statistics as to these miscellan-
eous fisheries appear, and they may be presumed to
have died out.
Exports.
The proximity of the colony to India, Singapore,
and Batavia, affords a ready means of supplying the
markets of those countries with horses, which gener-
ally command good prices. Horses to the value of
�11,125 were exported in 1881. Considerable quan-
tities of gum, resin, sandal wood and tortoiseshell
are also annually exported. Tho Ilawksbill turtle,
from which the latter commodity is procured, is
found on all the islands of the coast. Sandal wood
valued at �77,165 was exported in 1881. During
the last ten j-ears sandal wood is estimated to have
been shipped to the value of �600,090. Its principal
market is China, where it is used for incense pur-
poses ; and tho late rise in price has largely stimula-
ted this industry. The jarrah, a species of Eucalytus,
best known as the West Australian mahogany, has
been before alluded to. It is in great demand for
railway sleepers, for building purposes in countries
infested by tho white ant, and for all kinds of
marine constructions, and it has also been proposed
to use it for paving the streets of London and other
large cities. It has the valuable property of resist-
ing the attacks of the white ant on land, and the
teredo neralis at sea. To jarrah and karri are
assignei twelve years by English Lloyd?s for use in
ship-huilding, being the next highest classification
to teak (fourteen years.) Timber to the value of
�79,277 was exported from the colony in 1881. One
thousand square miles is tho estimated area of the
country covered with jarrah forests. Extensive
deposits of guano have been discovered at the Lacc-
pede islands, situate in 17 deg. S. lat. and 122 deg.
long. The right of removing guano from these
islands was leased to a firm by the Government, but
owing to some alleged misrepresentation of the
estimated quantity, the firm not only suspended
operations, but has claimed and obtained heavy
damages from the Government for breach of contract.
Roads.
The main roads of the Colony are upwards of
14,000 miles in length, of which about one-half is
made, the remainder being tracks in the sand. They
are under the charge of thirty-feur District Boards,
and are maintained at a cost of about �ll,OOO yearly.
In 1880 the expenditure was about �lO,OOO. Accord-
ing to a dispatch of Governor Ord?s, these roads are
very inferior. Tho Imperial sanction to a loan of
�50,000 for mending the ways was obtained in 1879,
and the money is now in course of expenditure. Up
to March 31st, 1880, there had been expended of it
�5,875 35., and there were outstanding liabilities of
�1,608 10s. The available balance was �42,516 7s.
Railways.
The public railways of the Colony are in the hands
of the Government. The Northern Railway, 34',
miles long, connects the town and mining district of


Northampton with the port of Gevaldton, Champion
Bay, and was opened for traffic in 1878. Hitherto
the traffic on this line has been unremunerative.
The total revenue for 1880 was �2,626 4s. 2d. ; the
expenditure was �3,850 12s. 6d. The cost of this
was greatly in excess of the original estimate ; this
fact and the depreciation in the value of ore, which has
reduced the traffic to a minimum, have disastrously
affected the value of this important work. The total
cost was �152,741, being an average of �4,364 per
mile. The first section of the Eastern Railway extend-
ing from the port of Fremantle to the city of Perth
and thence to Guildford, w*as opened for general traffic
on the 2nd of March, 1881. The stations are Fre-
mantle, Fremantle E. \ mile, Fremantle N. Ij mile,
Butler?s Swamp 6 miles, Perth 12 miles, Guildford
20 miles. The traffic has exceeded the most sanguine
expectations. This section affords the rare instance
of a line being well and cheaply made within the
engineer?s estimate. The total cost for the 20 miles
open was �124,469, an average of �6,223 per mile.
The contractor was Mr. John Robb of Adelaide.
The public railways of the colony are under the
management of the Hon. J. H. Thomas, M.1.0.E.,
Commissioner of Railways, under whoso direction,
with the sanetion of the Local and Imperial Govern-
ments, a survey for the second section of the Eastern
Railway, a distance of 21 miles east from Guildford,
has been completed. Tenders for the construction
of this section have been received, the successful
tenderers being the firm of Messrs. Wright and
Risely, at a sum of �53,000. They have pushed on
the works in a most energetic manner, and the lino
should be completed as far as Ghedlow?s Spring?
half way between Guildford and York ?by the close
of 1883, eighteen months from the commencement of
the works. The Government have floated a loan of
�200,000 to complete the line to York, having re-
solved to lose no time between the completion of the
second section and the commencement of the third.
Sir William Robinson?s presentations to the Home
Government were the chief cause of the ready con-
sent that was given to the new loan ; and to his
exertions and careful policy may also be attributed
the restoration of the colony?s finances to their
present sound condition. Sir Thomas Campbell?s
proposition in the Legislature Council for the exten-
sion of the Eastern Railway to Albany upon the
Land Grant System was favourably entertained by
the Home Government, but led to no practical result,
and the scheme may be said to have fallen through.
Monsieur Joubart, a promoter of the Adelaide, Perth,
and New Zealand Exhibition, made an offer to the
Goverment to construct the line in consideration
of receiving ten million acres of land. The
cost of the line M Joubert estimated at �1,000,000,
and the value of the land at 2s. 6d. per acre. A
majority of the Council, however, declined the
proposal, on the ground that the amount of land
was excessive. They, however, considered that it
was an essential condition that the line should be
worked and maintained by a contractor for a term of
years. Reconnaissance surveys along the proposed
route were made by Messrs. John Forrest and Price,
and their reports are now under consideration; the
country passed through presents no great engineering
difficulties, and both timber and ballast are plentiful.
The construction (exclusive of equipment) was
estimated at �693,220; locomotive, carriage, and
waggon expenses, �13,250 ; traffic expenses, �4,500 ;
maintenance, �11,450. The private railways are
those of the Jarrahdale Timber Company, from
Jarrahdale to the port of Rockingham 24 miles long,
and the West Australia Timber Company, from
Yokenup to Lockville, 14 miles long. All the
railways of the Colony are single lines, 3 feet 6 inches
gauge, worked hy locomotives. The rolling stock
of the Northern line comprises 2 Kitson?s locomo-
tives, 2 Fairlio engines, 2 composite carriages, and
26 waggons and vans. The rolling stock of the
Eastern line consists of 3 locomotives, 4 carriages,
and 88 waggons and vans.
Timber.
The Ballarat Timber Company was formed in 1870
for the purposes of cutting and sawing jarrah, tuart,
and other Western Australian timber and exporting
the same. To carry out this object a line of railway
was made from the shipping port of Lockville, Geo-
graphe Bay, in the Yasse district, which is 5 miles
north of Bussolton, and about 15 miles south of Bun-
bury, to the base of the Darling ranges, 1 If miles,
on which the jarrah grows. A jetty has been
erected at the port for loading the timber into
lighters, the ships lying about a mile from the shore,
in good anchorage, in about four fathoms of water,
A sixty horse power engine and large saw-mill at
the port saws the logs, brought down the line from
the ranges, into any size required. There are work-
men?s cottages erected, blacksmiths? and engineers?
shops, foundry to cast both iron and brass, a large
general store which is kept by the Company, a place
of worship, which, during the day, is used as a
school, the Government supplying a teacher, and, in
the evening, as a reading room. A slip has been
constructed to haul up and repair the Company?s
lighters and steam-tugs. In March, 1871, the saw-
mill plant and railway were completed and sawing
commenced, which has been continued since then to
the present date, during which time many thousands
of tons of timber have been exported, thereby de-
nuding the forest of all timber fit for sawing and
piles, for a radius of 2f miles from the original ter-
minus of the line. In July, 1876, the Company
decided to extend the line further into the timber
ranges, and in March, 1877, 2f miles more were
completed and opened, thus making 14 miles in all
laid with iron rails 30 and 40 lbs. per yard, the Com-
pany holding a grant from the Government of 20
miles long from the present terminus of the
line by 10 miles wide for cutting purposes,
which grant has been confirmed by the English
Government. The lino is constructed on freehold
land, so is the saw-mill and plant at Lockville, the
Company there owning 60 acres. This property is
now owned by the Western Australian Timber
Company. The Jarrahdale Timber Company have
their mills situated at Jarrahdale, a valley in the
midst of an extensive forest of timber, in the Ser-
pentine district. The Hon. J. J. Casey, a director
of the company, recently applied to the Government
for an extension of concessions in consideration of
the great value to the colony of the works already
constructed; and also pointed out that the proposal
was entitled to favourable consideration, as the
Government had neglected to carry out certain
promised improvements of the harbour at Cockburn
Sound. Mr. Casey also proposed to extend the pre-
sent railway belonging to the Company to a point
in the Albany Road, a distance of about 12 miles,
and to take payment for the cost of the extension in
land. Consideration of his proposal was deferred hy
the Legislature for the 3 r ear. A railway, 24 miles
long, connects the mills with their shipping station
at Rockingham, where a substantial jetty has been
erected, at which ships can lay alongside in six
fathoms of water. The Bunbury Timber Company,
Limited, have extensive mills at the head of the


Ferguson and Collie rivers, about 20 miles from
Bunbury. Private establishments connected with
the timber trade also do large business, and afford
constant employment for labour. The principal are
those of Mr. M. C. Davies, Port Augusta, Mr. W.
Yelverton, Quindalup, and Mr. G. Lacy, Guildford.
Electric Telegraphs.
Nearly all the towns and districts of commercial
or agricultural importance in Western Australia are
connected by telegraph wires. Albany, King
George?s Sound, is united with Perth, the capital,
whence wires run to every place of importance. In
1881 there were 27 stations and 1,584f miles of line
open. From Albany the wire is extended to South
Australia via Eucla, where it may be said to connect
with the telegraph system of the world. The
stations and distances from Albany are, Bremor 107
n iles, Esperance 275J miles, Israelite Bay
miles. Eyre, 590J miles, Eucla 750 i miles. An
extension of the line northwards from Champion
Bay to Port Wallcot, on the N.W. coast, a distance
of 500 miles, is about to be constructed, the cost of
this important public work?�so,o6o ?being included
in the loan of �260,000 recently sanctioned for rail-
ways and public works. The charge for messages
between any two stations in the colony is a uniform
rate of Is. for the first ten words, and Id. for each
additional word, with the exception of between
Perth and Freemantle, where messages are sent at
the rate of 6d. for 10 words, with Id. for every
additional word. The intercolonial rates are : South
Australia, (excluding stations on overland line) 10
words (exclusive of name and address) 25.,
and 2d., for every additional word; Victoria
10 words 35., and 3d. per additional word;
Queensland 10 words 45., and 4d. per additional
word ; New South Wales 10 words 35,, and 3d. per
additional word ; Tasmania 10 words Bs., and 9d. per
per additional word ; New Zealand, 10 words 11s.
6d., Is. Id. per additional word. On Sundays this
charge is doubled. To London or any other part of
Europe, 10s. Bd. per word. The revenue derived
from this department in 1880 was �3,076 Is. 2d.,
besides actual revenue to Western Australia from
telegrams via Eucla, amounting to �1,131 14s. 2d.
During the year 1881 there were transmitted a total
of 75,237 messages, of which 27,870 were on official
business.
Post Office.
At the end of 1881 there were 58 (including 15
roadside) receiving-houses and district post-offices
in the colony. The numbers of employes in the
Post and Telegraph Department was 156 ; the extent
of postal lines was 1,973 miles, and the miles trav-
ersed were 196, 684. There were received and des-
patched during the year 30,631 mails, and there

the transactions out of the colony were represented
by 2,129 orders, of the value of �9,609 17s. 2d. ; the
total being 2,818 orders issued and paid, of the value
of �ll,OOB 18s. lOd.
Imports and Exports.
The value of the imports into the colony during
the year ending 31st December, 1881, was
�404,831 7s. The exports during the same year
were valued at �502,769 19s. 6d." As usual, wool
was the largest item of export; the amount shipped
was to the value of �256,689 17s. 6d. Next to this
came sandalwood, the export value of which was
�77,165. The value of the pearls sent from the
colony was estimated at �12,000, and jarrah timber
�79,277 10s. Horses, sheep, fish, flour, gum, hides,
leather, oil, ore, tallow, guano, and tortoiseshell,
also figure among the articles of export.
Revenue
from all sources, including Customs, for the 1881,
was �264,313, the expenditure being �197,386 4s. lid.
The public debt was �771,000, bearing interest at
the rate of four and a half, five and six per cent, the
indebtedness per head of population being very
nearly �26 a head.
Shipping.
In 1880 the number of vessels which left the
various ports was 183, tonnage 139,998, with crews
of 8,675 men. 185 vessels, of a total of 147.048
tous, with crews amounting to 8,996 men, were
entered inwards.
Intercommunication
The government have entered into contracts by
which steam service is subsidized for mail passenger
and general traffic upon the coast from Port Cossack
in the North, to Albany, King George?s Sound, in
the South, and also to Adelaide and Melbourne.
Between Albany and Champion Bay the coastal ser-
vice is fortnightly each way. Betwceen Fremantle
and Cossack monthly. The intercolonial service
between Albany and Melbourne via Adelaide is also
monthly. On this joint service three steamers, the
Macedon, Otway , and Rob Roy are subsidized. There
is also a fortnightly service between Albany and
the Eastern Colonies by the steamers of the P. and
O. Company, communication with which is
kept up by one of the subsidized steamers,
and mail coaches mnning between Perth and
Albany 269 miles. Coaches in connection with the
mail service run between the principal towns of the
colonj and the means of communication have lately
very much improved. Passengers are conveyed at a
rate of about 4d. per mile.


91111s and manufactories.
The manufactories in the colony are few. They
consist of?one soap factory, fifty-five mills for
grinding flour, twenty-five being worked by steam
power, twenty by horses, nine by water and one
windmill, four water and thirteen steam saw-mills,
and two mills worked by horse power, also four
tanneries, one smelting works, five breweries, two
coach factories, one steam joinery establishment,
one steam furniture manufactory, a bone-crushing
mill, one ice works, and two aerated water manu-
factories. A salt factory is being worked at Rott-
nest Island by the Government. A European
superintendent conducts the works, which are
supplied with labour from the native penal estab-
lishment situated on the island. Two very
successful breweries are also at work in Perth,
two in the Plantagcnet district, one at York,
and two at Champion Bay.
Lighthouses.
Geraldton (Champion Bay) ; loading lights, two
fixed red lights, visible 8 miles, a powerful light, a

also proposed to place a lighthouse at Cape Leeuwin.
In all there were on May 1, 1881, ten important
lights on the coast, with a staff of thirteen
keepers, 6 jetty lamps, and two beacon lamps at
Albany.
?Volunteers.
The volunteer forces of the colony consist of a
troop of Artillery (Perth Artillery Volunteers) two
companies of mounted Volunteers, six companies of
Rifle Volunteers, and a Naval Volunteer force ; the
total of all ranks is 630. Each volunteer is entitled
to a free grant of land, of 50 acres, after a period of
five years service, in lieu of which, by an Act of the
Legislature, has been substituted a money payment
of �l2 10s., at the choice of the volunteer. _ The
expenditure during the year 1881 for the mainten-
ance of this force was �2,031 14s. lid. Lieut.-Col.
E. Fox-Angelo, formerly Commandant of the Tas-
manian Volunteer Forces, has been appointed Com-
mandant and Inspecting Officer of the West
Australian Volunteers.
Charitable Institutions.
There are nine hospitals, one lunatic asylum, two
poor-houses, 2 native institutions, a Protestant
orphanage, and a Roman Catholic orphanage. The
daily average of paupers during the year 1881 was
227.
Arrivals and Departures.
During the year 1881, 611 'persons arrived in the
Colony; the departures during the same period
were 690.
Progress.
During the past 10 years, notwithstanding the
low rate at which the population has increased, the
Colony has made material advances, and particularly
so in the marked and improved character of the
public and private buildings recently erected in the
several towns. In the building of dwellings material
assistance has been afforded by Building Societies
established at Perth and Fremantle.
Savings Banks, Ac.
On January Ist, 1882, the Post Office Sayings
Banks numbered thirteen, with 1,654 depositors.
The balance due to depositors at the end of 1881 was
�22,568 11s. Bd., the withdrawals during 1881
amounted to �9,156 4s. 7d. Deposits of postage
stamps on .cards are now received. There are also
twelve Friendly Societies in existence, with which
are connected about 1,000 persons.
Banks, Ac.
There are three proprietary banks in the Colony :
The Western Australian, the National Bank of
Australasia, and the Union Bank of Australia. The
first is a purely local establishment. The head
offices of all these institutions are at Perth with
branches at Fremantle, Geraldton, and other towns
in the Colony. The Western Australian has long paid
dividends of �l6 per cent, in addition to bonuses.
The other banks yield good returns. All the prin-
cipal British and Colonial Assurance Offices are
represented in the Colony. There is no local
Assurance or Insurance Office in the Colony, save
one which undertakes marine risks only. On June
30th, 1881, the assets of the three banks doing-
business in the Colony were �599,660 16s. sd.
Liabilities, �376,459 15s. 9d., the deposits not
bearing interest amounted to �138,945 2s. 6d.,
bearing interest to �181,989 18s. 6d. The average
note circulation was �21,682 13s. 9d.
�over nmental.
The administration of the Colony is under a
Governor appointed by the Crown, who is assisted
by an Executive Council, composed of certain
office-holders, namely,?the Senior Officer in
command of the forces, the Colonial Secretary,
the Surveyor-General, and the Attorney-General.
In the absence of the Governor the Comman-
dant is the Administrator. There is also
a Legislative Council, composed of seven official and
nominee members, and fourteen elected members.
The official members are the Colonial Secretary,
the Surveyor General, and the Attorney-General.
The nominee members are four in number. Of the
fourteen elected members two each are returned by
the electoral districts of Perth and Freemantle, and
one by the districts of York, Geraldton, Greenough,
Wellington, Vasse, Swan, Albany, Toodyay,
Murray and Williams, and North District. The
qualification for an elector is a householder of �lO
annual value. A member must be possessed of
landed property to the value of �l,OOO, or of an
annual income of �250.
Administration of Justice.
The judicial system comprises a Supreme Court,
presided over by a Chief Justice, and Courts of
Quarter and Petty Sessions. The courts of Quarter
Sessions are found to work far from well, and great
need exists for Assistant Judges, as well as a properly
constituted Court of Appeal. The Chairmen of
Quarter Sessions are inexperienced men, and have
the anomalous position of prosecutor and judge tc>
perform.
