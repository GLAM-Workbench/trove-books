THERE WAS A LITTLE WOMAN, a very tragic folksong

A Short Pause
Scene 2. — IN THE VILLAGE (where we shall first visit
a happy home and see how smoothly life flows on;
next we go to the vixen’s house and hear a very differ-
ent story; lastly, we go to the cottage of the Wise
Woman and see how she smooths out the villagers
difficulties). A CHANGE OF WINDOW CUR-

ENT HOUSEHOLDS.

Properties: Executed hg TREVOR RA.YNER,
The T.O.Y. is introducing to Australia a phase of the new
and rapidly-growing movement in Europe and America to get
back to the simplicity of stage art.
Instead of relying for its appeal on realism in acting and
setting, it seeks to awaken the imagination so that the audience
is taking as active a part in the programme as the Players
themselves.
