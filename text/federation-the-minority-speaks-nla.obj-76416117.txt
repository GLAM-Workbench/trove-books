FEDERATION. THE MINORITY SPEAKS.
What lias ths majority done ?
They have disposed of oar lands,
squandered the proceeds aad created
a large national debt. By a system
of competition and freetrade they
have spread a lot of us out, Banks
included. Now they want to find
fault with the size ot the country, and
attribute their waat of success to the
?want of Federation. What next will
sunny New South Wales be subjected
to. If the wealth of the country is
the ruin of the country, how great is
their wealth. It is the want of
immigration one time and the un-
favorable seasons another. It is
never the want of capacity. Just as
if God?s earth was never intended for
habitation. Some countries may take
better management than others, but
you have not proved yourselves
capable of managing any country. If
your actions go to show anything,
they go to prove that you are in-
capable of securing a living for
yourselves if subjected to the influence
of vour own conditions. You make
places for each other, I admit, but
you forget that it the Governor?ft
position was the only occupation here
lie wonld be the only inhabitant.
What would he do with all the
wealth ? He could not eat it. 1 guess
he would have to work. If he did
not he wonld be only a parasite.
Of coarse he would be a parasite if
he could not live by his wits. For
those who are masters of the situation
there is no excuse, and if our instita-
tions are necessary they should be
used for the purpose of receiving
those who exhibit, mental incapacity.
Advance theory to such people and
they will tell you it is impracticable.
That has got to be proved. Their?s is
already proved. Surely it is more
reasonable to suppose that the physi-
cal class could provide for the mental
class than that, the latter could pro-
vide for the former. There can be
no harsher way of treating people
than to give them their liberty to
secure a living under what conditions
yon choose to impose upon them.
High wages or low wages make no
difference. That won?t keep the
scab or the man out of employment.
We must have work waiting for men,
not men waiting for work?if work is
necessary. I question that. I would
like to know what has become ot the
work of the ancients, and, if it suited
them, why it would 'not suit ns ?or
what guarantee hare we that posterity
will not rob us oat. Before we go
federating w� should see to this :
MAJORITY RULE.
There is a great deal said about
majority rule, but I venture to show
you it is not majority rule. Majority
rule is when the question comes from
the people, not when it is carried by
the people, because it did not originate
from the people, bat a faction. Then
the people only follow. They do not
lead. Let the people bring forward a
question, and if they rule let them
carry it. That is majority rule, not
mockery. Nor can it be said that our
present condition is the result of the
wisdern of the majority, but a faction
of political adventurers. These are
the people who run the country. It
is they who are loudest in their cry
for one-man-one-vote and womanhood
suffrage, which, in other words, means
give them a show to run the country.
The Crown puts forward no questions,
they simply keep the question going.
It they do anything they place
obstacles in your way by requiring a
four-fifths majority to prove your
iacapaclty. The cause is rotten, and
admitted by everyone. They arrest
your progress and say that something
hotter is required of you. Not that
Federation would not be an advantage
under oar present conditions, bat if
they are foul we are only compound-
ing them. It is impossible for me to
say what Federation will do. It is
fo> posterity. I venture to shy that
it will leave things in a very confused
state for a long time. It will deprive
us of any opportunity of fighting out
this social question with which we
stood shoulder to shoulder. For those
in the know it must be a very nice
joke to see how they can slip away
like a ghost, leaving all labor mem-
bers, unions and strikes to come later
on, perhaps when they might bo in
a better position to find an occupation
for them. You wanted to bury yonr
father, out I say let the dead bury
its dead. Give them best. Two
wrongs won?t make a right. They
promise this,that and the other. What
is it your labor members have not
promised? Doyen suppose the federal
candidates are not Labour members.
They are Labour members all right ;
and, while yon oppose them the
majority will assist them. What
does it matter who holds the pesi-
tion ? The majority would rather
see them hold the position than you.
What does your action prove ? Why
many of you would be willing to sup-
port the cause you condemn, and
abandon all previous obligations.
This is clearly proved when you
swear your allegiance to the Grown,
and take your seat in the House ;
while they are only indulging your
passion to allow you to sit there at
all. They could do what they have
to do without yen. But, for the
annoyance of yon, their duties wonld
be simple, executed more quickly,
and with better effect. But this is
not a settlement of the social question.
We want men and measures far
superior to anything we have. For
them we must look to the minority.
Tlie majority is a pig, that if you
were to speak tiie truth to, h* would
tear you to pieces; or else be prepared
to admit that any condition of life was
good enough to excuse their ignorance.
They could not stand the humiliation
of their ignorance being exposed. To
succeed with the majority you must
flitter them ; you must assist them ;
you must talk of unity, not of divi-
sion. The man who Delongs to no
party is the enemy of all parties.
That?s me : no party, bat all parties.
Then you ask ?? What has that to do
with Federation ? ? It has got this
to do with it ; But for Federation, I
woald have had no occasion to write.
Yon, very naturally, say I cannot
stop it. I saj 7 , if I don't it will be
stopped upon some other occasion in
another direction. They cannot always
get away. They will find themselves
cornered seme day. And, doubtless,
if America and the colonies had nob
been discovered, the problem wonld
have been settled ere this. If this is
what Christians call progress, call me
not a Christian. You say again
? What has that to do with Federa-
tion ? ? It has this to do with it :
What have you done with the pro-
ceeds of the sale of our laud (which
yon refuse to use yourselves, or make
useful to others ?) Are yen not com-
pounding a felony ? These are the
people whom you have to consult?
the people with whom yon have made
contracts. How clever to give us one-
man-one-vote, to pass a measure of
this sort! Is it fair to them, or just,
to assist you P By a system �f free-
trade and democracy you cruel their
prospects, and shirk your obligations.
The majority fight their own shadow.
They wear an impression of lunacy,
and their actions prove it. ? Physi-
cian, heal thyself.? My troubles
about them. I make no quarrel
with them. They quarrel with me
when they advance Federation. Nor
do 1 quarrel with Wyalong or New
South Wales, but with the whole of
the colonies. If competition is the
life ot trade, then what is good for
the goose is good for the gander.
We cannot allow the cart to
draw the hotse, at any rate. Give
physia to the dogs I?ll have
none of it. Lot ns see what led np
to this. I think it was Sir Henry
Parkes who first moved in the matter
by trying to create a disturbance over
the Murray question ; failing which,
he made an elaborate address in the
House in reference to the danger we
stood in with China. He stated that
there was no potentate having the
power to do a thing would be de-
terred from doing so because it was
displeasing to others. This could be
said with equal truth of himself.
We have it from his own lips that
Sir James Martin was a great and
good man ; but although he was a
Protectionist, he was not a democrat.
You have it from me now that
although Sir Henry was a democrat,
he was not a Protectionist. Which
of these men was the most respected
?which of them was the most entitled
to credit. 0, monster Majority !
You are good judges of the weather.
If they gave you - two rotes to their
one, and did not allow you to raise
any question, they would defeat you.
riien what good is ? Democracy P ?
You raise questions, and sometimes
carry them, and what are they doing
but assisting the cause you condemn.
You would not carry them if they
were not. Yon are progressing. You
are progressing in a ghost story. You
make a pan tontine of God?s earth.
You are struck with amazement and
confusion when yon meet the truth.
You can see the end of nothing bat
your own pockets, and, like your-
selves, that is sometimes either empty
or full of wretchedness. To prove that
we are company for you we must do
something clever. We must poll
down the good that another has done.
Remedy the evil# that ethers have
made. Like a child to a mother ia
the majority.
