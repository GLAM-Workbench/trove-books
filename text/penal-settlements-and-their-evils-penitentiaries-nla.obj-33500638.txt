PREFACE.
In the following pages, the writer has endeavoured to
comprise the more important facts and principles con-
nected with penal discipline. The facts have been
derived from parliamentary documents, and other
authentic publications, and considerable care has been
taken in their selection, in order to secure accuracy and
impartiality. Upon the deductions drawn, and the
principles expounded, there will, in the nature of things,
be much difference of opinion: and the writer cannot
anticipate that the arguments he has advanced, will, on
all points, be deemed conclusive. The subjects of which
these pages treat, are far too important and extensive to
be decided without much experience and discussion.
But if we have not yet sufficient data for an ultimate
and positive decision upon some of the more difficult
points in these subjects, w r e have undoubtedly sufficient
for instructive discussion, and preliminary and im-
portant action. It is the object of these pages then, to
bring forward and discuss the experience of the past,
the state of the present, and the requirements of the
future. The subjects to which they relate, will fre-
quently be brought before the public, and it is hoped
that the information they contain, will enable the reader
to form for himself a somewhat clear and accurate
opinion of the faults of our present penal system, and of
the merits or demerits of any future legislation.

PENAL SETTLEMENTS,
&c. &c.
The principles involved in the penal regulations of
a State, may be taken as an index of the amount of
enlightenment of its people and its legislators. In a
community of barbarians, punishment, whatever par-
ticular form, it may have assumed, will be found in its
principle to be savage and vindictive. Punishment
will assume the form of vengeance, ?the dictate of
passion and destruction; punishment for its own sake,
for the sake merely of the pain or the injury inflicted,
without the object of any ulterior good. As man be-
comes enlightened, he begins to doubt the justice of
this blind retribution, he feels that vengeance is a
punishment that ought to be found only among the
most savage of the brutes, and is altogether inconsistent
with natures of a higher order. It is admitted by all
the enlightened among mankind, that upon this prin-
ciple punishment should not be inflicted. But then
comes the question ; Upon what principle should it be
inflicted? Upon the principle of love and good will
to all mankind. In the Divine government of the
world, there is a series of punishments tending without


a single exception, to the good of society, and insti-
tuted in perfect love, and the most enlightened benevo-
lence. It might be supposed that the punishment thus
inflicted was sufiicient for the accomplishment of its
object; and that the intervention of punishment by
man, would interfere with the government of God.
But it appears to have been the object of nature, in
this instance, as in many others, to give to man an ex-
ample for imitation, to give him an indication of a
system j the outline and beginnings of a whole leaving
it a problem for his thought, a task for his energy, to
complete the plan, and carry out the design of provi-
dence. Hence, to the government of God, is added the
government of man. Punishment is to be found in
both ; but it is punishment in accordance with the at-
tributes of God, and the attributes of man, made in
the image of God. In a day when, in another quarter
of the globe, and in our own country, the authority of
all government has, in some measure, been called in
& '
question, it was perhaps necessary to say thus much in
support of punishment, government?s most powerful and
obnoxious agent.
But again our inquiry is retarded by fresh obstruc-
tors, who obtrude doubts as to what ought to be
the particular ends and objects of punishment. It
had been so long admitted, as almost to have been
taken for granted, that its objects were, Ist, the pre-
vention of crime in the community at large by the
example and terror of suffering; and, 2ndly, the pre-
vention of the repetition of crime in the individual
punished, by the reformation of his character. There
may be minor objects, but these only are of sufiicient


moment to require special mention. In the present day
however, there are individuals who maintain, that re-
formation should be the only object of punishment;
an opinion, the result of that sympathetic and senti-
mental philanthropy, which, in the minds of many,
has usurped the place of a healthful benevolence, and
an enlightened justice. It is perhaps natural that men,
under the guidance of over sensitive feeling, rather than
of extended reason, should adopt the opinion that
reformation, and not example, should be the object of
punishment. Captain Maconochie, whose judgment
upon this question is entitled to much respect, and
whose opinions will hereafter be more fully examined,
is of this opinion, and has in some measure founded his
system of penal discipline upon it. As it is a funda-
mental question, in all matters relating to the treatment
of criminals, it may perhaps require a passing notice.
It will here be maintained then, that the reformation of
the criminal is not the sole, nor the primary, but only
the secondary object of punishment. The prevention of
crime in the community at large, by the terror of the
law, is its grand and primary object. This attacks
the motives to crime in their first origin, and prevents
their manifestation in action. It is the prevention of
crime, reformation is only its cure. Whenever the
motives to crime become stronger than the opposing
motives, crime is the inevitable result. And the only
manner in which crime can be prevented in a com-
munity, is by strengthening these opposing motives.
The motives to crime are some actual or supposed ad-
vantages ; the deterring motives are, if not in all minds,
at least in the minds of the criminal classes of this


country, some actual or supposed disadvantages. Make
these deterring motives the strongest, and crime is in-
fallibly prevented. Now by a system of well adjusted
penalties, the strength of these motives can be greatly, if
not indefinitely, increased. To the most worldly, to the
most selfish, to the most vicious, it may be made ap-
parent, that crime is the game only of fools and madmen.
Were it possible to render punishment duly severe,
and, above all, certain and immediate, crime would
scarcely exist: reformation would not be needed, for
prevention would be complete. Now this is the ideal
of punishment; and although this abstract perfection
can never be practically attained, yet there can be no
doubt, that thousands in this country have been, and
at this moment are, deterred from the commission of
crime, solely by the terror of punishment. A system of
penal discipline founded upon the principle of reforma-
tion alone, even if carried to an ideal perfection, could
act only upon the comparatively few who come within
our jails, and could have no operation upon the thousands
who are ready to break loose the moment restraint is
removed. And still further, reformation would not be
brought into operation, until the crime was committed
and the evil done. Punishment is essential to the
existence of society; reformation is not essential, though
highly desirable. Hence punishment, as an example and
a terror, must ever hold the first position, and reformation
only the second, among the objects of penal legislation.
Having made these remarks upon the nature and
objects of punishment in general; let us now turn to the
consideration of that particular form of punishment,
known by the name of transportation.


Towards the close of the last century, a fleet of eleven
ships set sail from the Motherhank, having on hoard
757 convicts, who, with their necessary officers, and
some free emigrants, were ultimately settled at Sydney
Cove. From time to time, ships laden with convicts,
free emigrants, and merchandize, came to the colony,
which rapidly increased in numbers and importance.
Other colonies, free and convict, have since been settled
in Australia, and Yan Diemen?s Land ; all of which
have also rapidly advanced in population and commerce.
In the year 1836, New South Wales numbered a popm
lation of 77,096; and Ydh Diemen?s Land in 1841,
contained a population of 51,400. Several towns have
risen to considerable size and importance. Sydney, the
capital of New South Wales, contained, in the year
1836, 20,000 inhabitants. The town is well built, and
has the appearance, and all the accompaniments, of an
English city ; it has its hotels, theatre, public libraries,
chapels, and churches. Hobart Town, the capital of
Yan Diemen?s Land, although inferior to Sydney, is yet
of considerable size and moment, and contained, in 1833,
6800 inhabitants.
Until the year 1804, all our transported convicts were
sent to New South Wales; in that year, Yan Diemen?s
Land was first used by the British Government as a
penal settlement, to relieve New South Wales from a
portion of the convicts transported from Great Britain.
Since the year 1840, New South Wales has received no
fresh convicts; the whole number having been sent to
Yan Diemen?s Land. Norfolk Island, a small and beau-
tiful territory, lying far to the east of Sydney, has been
used as a receptacle for prisoners convicted of crime in the
a 3


penal colonies. And under more recent regulations,
many of the convicts are sent, upon their first arrival
from Great Britain, to this island, to undergo a pre-
liminary and severe punishment.
In the year 1842, while Lord Stanley was Colonial
Secretary, the system of convict discipline which previ-
ously had been in operation, was very materially modi-
fied. In order clearly to understand the whole question,
it will be necessary to state in detail both the previous
and the present regulations. Let us first, then, consider
those which were in force until the year 1842. As soon
as a convict vessel reached tlfe colony, a report was made
to the Governor, and a day appointed for an officer to
go on board to muster the convicts; the male convicts
were subsequently removed to the convict barracks; the
females to the penitentiaries. The greater portion were
afterwards distributed amongst the settlers as assigned
servants, the remainder were mostly retained in the em-
ployment of the government, and some few w r ere sent to
Norfolk Island, for severe punishment. The assigned
male convicts may be arranged under the heads of field
labourers, domestic servants, and mechanics. The do-
mestic servants, were well fed, well clothed, received
from <�lo to �l5 a-year as wages, and were generally
as well treated as servants in this country. The con-
victs who became mechanics were even better treated
than the domestic servants. But by far the greater
number became agricultural labourers. Their con-
dition was inferior to that of the other two classes,
yet there can be little doubt that even they were better
fed than the agricultural labourers in this country;
and although not strictly entitled to receive money, yet


their masters mostly paid them wages, or gave them,
instead of money, tea, sugar, tobacco, spirits, and other
indulgences. The female convicts were assigned as
domestic servants; and their food, clothing, and in-
dulgences, appear to have been equal to those of female
servants in this country. The treatment of the con-
victs retained and employed by government was gene-
rally less indulgent than those assigned to the settlers.
Many were employed in the making of roads, the
construction of bridges, and in other public works of
a similar description. Others filled situations of com-
parative ease, such as clerks, messengers, and even
constables in the police.
If the convict committed any crime, or rather if he
were discovered to have committed any crime, he might
be brought before the local authorities, and sentenced to
work in a chain-gang, or road-party, or sent to Norfolk
Island. But even under this comparatively severe dis-
cipline, the restrictions were so imperfect, that the
convicts frequented ale-houses, pillaged the food and
clothing of their comrades, and plundered the sur-
rounding country.
A convict, as a matter of course, unless he had con-
ducted himself very ill, was entitled to a ticket of leave,
at the expiration of the first 4 years of his sentence, if
he had been transported for 7 years; at the expiration
of 6 years, if he had been transported for 14 years or
at the expiration of 8 years, if he had been transported
for life. Under this ticket of leave he was entitled to
hire himself to any master within a prescribed district.
This privilege he forfeited by ill conduct; but by con-
tinued good behaviour, he obtained a conditional pardon.


entitling him to work or reside in any portion of the
colony, and making him virtually a free man. The
holders of tickets of leave have filled many situations of
trust; they have been constables in the police, overseers
of road-parties and chain-gangs; the better educated
have been employed as superintendents of estates, as
clerks to bankers, to lawyers, and to shopkeepers; some
have become tutors in private families, others have
amassed great wealth.
\
Ar
In the year 1842, Lord Stanley in the hope of re-
moving those enormous evils which then afflicted the
penal colonies, and which he supposed to result from
errors that might be removed, and not from inherent
and irremediable defects in the system of transportation
itself, wrote a despatch to the Governor of Yan Diemen?s
Land, directing many and important alterations in the
system of penal discipline which had previously been
adopted. He has elsewhere stated the leading principles
of his scheme to be, ? Ist, that each convict shall
undergo a severe preliminary punishment, consisting, in
great part, of a life of seclusion from society at large ;
and, 2ndly, that this punishment shall be progressively
mitigated, in such a manner as to afford an invigorating
hope of further relief, and an animating motive to good
conduct, until the convict shall at length be restored to
all the privileges of his fellow-creatures.? The following
are the leading details of the plan :?There are five
stages of punishment through which the criminal has to
pass, ?Ist, All convicts transported for life, and the
worst among those transported for less than 15 years,
are sent to Norfolk Island, to be there subjected to hard
labour and severe discipline. The longest period for


which they are here sentenced to detention is four years,
and the shortest two; but by misconduct the original
sentence may be indefinitely prolonged. The second
stage of punishment, is, that of the probation gangs.
These gangs are stationed in Van Diemens Land, and
are composed of the convicts who have passed through
the period of detention at Norfolk Island, and also of
such of the convicts transported for any term less than
for life, as shall be considered fit to be in the first
instance placed in this class. No convict placed in a
probation gang will pass in it less than one, nor more
than two years, except in cases of misconduct. A con-
temporary record will be preserved of his good or bad be-
haviour ; good conduct will be rewarded in the ulterior
stages of his punishment; bad will be followed by pro-
longed detention in the probation gang. The gangs con-
sist of from 250 to 300 men ; they are employed in hard
labour, and when practicable, are quartered in situations
where they can execute, in concert, works of public
utility. When the convict has served the period for
which he wxis placed in the probation gang, and ob-
tained from the comptroller of convicts a certificate of
his general good conduct, he proceeds to the third stage of
punishment, and becomes the holder of a probation pass.
He may now, with the consent of the government, engage
in any private service, his master paying him a portion
of his wages, and depositing the remainder in the
savings? bank to the credit of the government, to be re-
turned to the convict in a future stage of his punish-
ment, unless his probation pass be forfeited by ill
conduct. After a time, he becomes entitled to the
whole of his w T ages; but wdiether entitled to the whole


or to a part, he may at any time be required to give an
account of their expenditure. The transition of the
criminal from this stage to that of a holder of a ticket
of leave, is always a matter of favour, and never a
matter of strict right. In this, the fourth stage of the
convict?s development, he possesses what Lord Stanley
has termed, a 44 probationary and revocable pardon
valid in the colony in which it is granted, but of no
avail elsewhere. The fifth and last stage is that of
pardon either conditional or absolute. Some unim-
portant alterations have since been made in these regu-
lations by Mr. Gladstone, which it is here unnecessary
to notice.
The mode of discipline just described, differs no doubt
in many points from the system it has superseded. By
the record which is kept of the conduct of each indi-
vidual prisoner, data is obtained, upon which a mitiga-
tion or increase of future punishment may be awarded,
thus presenting to the convict the stimulus of hope as
well as of fear, and tending, under judicious management,
to his ultimate reformation. The difference, however,
between the two systems is, upon the whole, more
apparent than essential; all the old instruments of
punishment are retained, and no essentially new element
introduced; the vicious system of former days is thrown
merely into a new form ; new names being given to old
regulations. In the first place, we find imprisonment in
Norfolk Island continued; but it is no longer under the
enlightened guidance of Captain Maconochie. He was
removed from the government of that island upon the
promulgation of this new scheme; his system only im-
perfectly tried, and working under every disadvantage :


but when Lord Stanley, that heaven-born minister, had
conceived a project, it was of course but proper that
every thing should make way for the grand experiment.
In the second stage, we find that old form of gregarious
punishment, penal gangs, still retained, but under the
new name of probation gangs. It must be well known
to every one, either theoretically or practically ac-
quainted with the workings of the criminal mind, that
to congregate two or three hundred criminals together,
cannot tend to the strengthening of virtue, but must
result in the corruption of the whole mass, and the
annihilation of every latent virtue. When the discipline
in these probation gangs is lax, the licentiousness in
every crime, which must result, is too obvious to require
description. When sufficiently severe, to render the
punishment efficient, the dishumanizing effect upon the
mind can scarcely be exceeded. Severe physical punish-
ment and restraint, especially when publicly inflicted,
instead of inducing reformation, produces either the
spirit of insubordination and rebellion, or that state of
mental prostration, in which the dignity and inde-
pendence of the mind is lost, and active virtue becomes
all but impossible. This plan of gregarious punishment
was part of the former mode of discipline, and its failure
was complete. The third stage in this new scheme, is
the assignment system, under slight modification, and
with, of course, a new name. The convict becomes a
servant, and holds what is called a probation pass.
The success of this part of the scheme will, of course,
depend upon the reformation which has been wTought
upon the convict in the previous stages. If, as will after-
wards be found to be the case, he has only been hardened


in iniquity, the original method of assigning him as
a servant on his first arrival in the colony is much
preferable. The fourth and fifth stages require no
observation; they are merely different forms of pardon,
and must be found in every modification of penal
discipline.
From a project so elaborately inefficient, no mate-
rial mitigation of the evils of transportation, whether
as regards the convicts themselves, or the free colonists,
could be anticipated, and none has resulted. Indeed,
owing to the undue accumulation of prisoners in Yan
Diemen?s Land, the pernicious effects have been fearfully
augmented. The evils which have existed, still exist,
and will continue to exist, as long as transportation is
maintained, are comparatively but little known in this
country : it will be well for us, therefore, now to enter
somewhat minutely into their details.
In the first place, transportation always has been,
and it will be afterwards shown, always must be, ineffi-
cient as a punishment. Before the Committee of the
House of Commons, which sat in 1831, to inquire into
the best mode of giving efficiency to secondary punish-
ments, was examined, Potter Macqueen, Esq. In the
course of his evidence, he said, ? I have had in my
employment from sixty to ninety convicts yearly. I
have considered, from the average expense, as forwarded
to me by my agent there, that these convicts have been
placed in the possession of relative comforts which, had
I to provide the same comforts for my own labourers in
Bedfordshire, would cost me <�s6. 10s. a man, per
annum; and, at the same time, labourers in my own
district have averaged for their support <�B. per
V P
?x.'WT ?


annum.? Mr. Macqueen furnishes an extract from a
letter written by a private soldier quartered in New
South Wales; it states, ?Norman Hughes (a convict
transported for stealing wheat, a most notorious cha-
racter in Bedfordshire) has taken a large farm in
Macquarie?s Harbour, and is doing well. Philip Hibbs
(a boy about eighteen, transported for picking pockets)
receives JOSO a-year wages, as tapster of the Commer-
cial Tavern. This letter (continues Mr. Macqueen)
was read among the agricultural labourers of Bedford-
shire ; the effect of it was only this, they were anxious
m
ier
m
to know what they could commit to entitle them to he
transported .? The same witness also states, ? That he
considered the condition of the convict labourer in New
South Wales as infinitely superior to that of the agri-
cultural labourer of this country, and that, from his
own experience as a magistrate, he has found that many
persons have asked, what extent of crime would ensure
their transportation.? After this evidence, few will
doubt the correctness of the Irish convict, when he
remarked to his companion, ? Many a Mac in your
town, if he only knew what the situation of a convict
was, would not be long in following my example !
Thank God for the same, I was never better off in my
life !?
Now, when it is remembered that the primary object
of all punishment should be to deter from crime by the
terror of example, it is difficult to conceive any practical
results more directly contrary to the grand object of
punishment, than those which have been detailed. The
actual absence of the infliction of suffering would be, of
little or no importance, provided the idea and apprehen-


sion of suffering were, in the minds of the people, con-
nected with the commission of crime. Indeed, it will
always be a principal object of a humane legislator to
create the greatest possible amount of apprehension and
terror in the community at large, by the infliction of the
least possible amount of pain on the criminal himself.
But in the instances just given, we see, instead of terror,
actual inducement. No doubt, by Lord Stanley?s recent
regulations, the amount of suffering is considerably in-
creased, for if, in any point, they are an improvement
upon the former discipline, it is in this respect. This
advantage has, however, been attained by the sacrifice
of the characteristic benefits accruing from transporta-
tion, as will afterwards be shown ; and after all, it is
probable that the only result of these regulations has
been, to substitute for legitimate success, a brilliant
career of crime.
There has perhaps been no principle relating to penal
legislation, more repeatedly brought before the public,
than that certainty in punishment is of more impor-
tance than severity. The criminal classes in all coun-
tries are actuated by the spirit of the gambler. When-
ever there is the prospect of success, even although the
probabilty of failure may much preponderate, whenever,
in short, there is uncertainty, there is room for hope and
speculation. The prospect of success is ever present;
the fear of failure seldom intrudes. Even should its
probability be admitted, the criminal mind is too reck-
less and impetuous for such considerations to have
much weight; they enter into the mind little more
than the probability of death enters into the calcula-
tions of the soldier. Now the uncertainty in the
y t


punishment of transportation has been and still is very
great. Under the assignment system, the condition of
the convict depended entirely upon the character of his
master; and although in the earlier stages of the present
discipline, the fate of the convict is more strictly defined,
yet in his subsequent course, there is all the uncertainty
of the former regulations. With much trial and suffer-
ing, there will still be splendid prizes held out to the
famishing thousands of this country, as irresistible
premiums upon crime. Whatever may be the strin-
gency of the regulations, in a young and rising colony,
there will always be cases of brilliant success; while in
a community like our own, humble honesty finds no re-
ward, and sees no prospect of advancement. Even the
suffering which, in the penal colony, may probably await
the criminal, is calculated to have the least possible
effect upon the community at large. It is distant, both
as regards time and place; and distance renders, if not
actually, at least apparently, all objects and results un-
certain. Whatever amount of suffering then be thrown
into the punishment of transportation, it is suffering
uselessly squandered, and inflicted without attaining any
adequate advantage.
Let us now turn our attention to the actual con-
dition of the convicts in our penal colonies. Many
of the extracts which follow, will by name refer to
the assignment system ; but although this system is
now nominally abolished, it is actually retained with
the demoralizing addition of penal gangs. There is un-
doubted evidence to show, that the evils which existed
under the former regulations, bear no comparison to the
enormities now abounding. In a petition presented to


Parliament last session, and signed by 1750 free colo-
nists in Yan Diemens Land, it is stated, ?
? That by keeping criminals in large gangs, as at
present, they cannot be benefited or improved, but on
the contrary, become deteriorated. That there is yet
a more fearful evil produced by the present system of
transportation ; that it is reported and believed, that the
unhappy men sent to Norfolk Island, have sunk into
deeper pollution and depravity, and that if such men are
added to the unbounded number of criminals already in
Yan Diemen?s Land, this island and the neighbouring
colonies, among which they must ultimately be diffused,
will exhibit a spectacle of vice and infamy, such as the
history of the world cannot parallel. That w T e are
confident that to bring under your Majesty?s notice
this frightful result of the present convict system, which
thus plunges our erring fellow-creatures deeper in sin
and misery, and dismisses them to contaminate others,
is to insure its immediate abolition.?
After this statement, which is only one amongst
many that might be quoted, there can be little danger,
that a description of the results of the former plan of
discipline, will be an exaggeration of the present state
of our penal colonies. The following is an extract from
a despatch of Sir C. Arthur, Lieutenant Governor of
Yan Diemen?s Land, dated 28th June, 1832.
? You cannot, my Lord, have an idea of the vexa-
tions which accompany the employment of convicts, or
of the vicissitudes attendant upon their assignment.
Their crimes and misconduct involve the settlers in
daily trouble, expense, and disappointment. The dis-
cipline and control of the convicts in Yan Diemen?s


Land, is carried, perhaps, to a higher degree than could
ever have been contemplated. Many of the convicts
have been greatly reformed, when in the service of con-
siderate and judicious masters; but with all this abate-
ment, there is so much peculation, so much insubordi-
nation, insolence, disobedience of lawful orders, and so
much drunkenness, that reference to magisterial au-
thority is constant, and always attended with loss of
time and expense to the settlers. There can be no
doubt, things appear better in the colony than they
really are; for in numberless instances, masters are
known to submit to peculation rather than incur the
additional expense of prosecuting their servants.?
The following is an extract from the Report of the
Select Committee of the House of Commons, upon trans-
portation, dated 3rd August, 1838. As there may be
occasion frequently to refer to this Report, it may be
well to mention, that it was founded upon the volumi-
nous evidence of 23 persons, nearly the whole of whom
had had personal, and many of them official, experience
of the system of transportation, as well as upon a vast
amount of information, acquired from official documents
furnished by the Colonial Department. The committee
contained amongst its number, Sir William Molesworth,
Sir George Grey, Mr. Ward, Mr. Hawes, Mr. Charles
Duller, Lord Howick, Lord John Russell, and Sir
Robert Peel.
The report referred to, speaking of the condition of
the female convicts, says: ? Their general conduct,
according to the testimony of every witness examined
before your committee, is, (to use the words of Sir E.
Perry) 4 as bad as anything could well be,' he could


4 hardly conceive anything worse.? At times they are
excessively ferocious, and the tendency of assignment is
to render them still more profligate ; they are all of
them, with scarcely an exception, drunken and aban-
doned characters.? * * 44 It can easily
be imagined, what a pernicious effect must be produced
upon the character of the rising generation of the
Australian colonies, in consequence of the children of
settlers being, too frequently, in their tenderest years
under the charge of such persons.?
Convicts, whether holding the position of assigned
servants, ticket-of-leave men, or working in government
gangs, frequently take to the bush, as it is called, or
under some other character or denomination, become
outlaws to society. They live by depredation and
every description of crime, and are the terror of the
country. Darwin, in the narrative of the ships, A
ture and Beagle , gives the following description of these
classes :
44 4 A squatter,? ? he says, 44 is a freed or ticket-of-
leave man, who builds a hut with bark, on unoccupied
ground, buys or steals a few animals, sells spirits with-
out a license, receives stolen goods, ?and so at last,
becomes rich and turns farmer; he is the horror of all
his honest neighbours. A 4 crawler,? is an assigned
convict, who runs away and lives how he can, by labour
and by petty theft. The 4 bush-ranger,? is an open
villain, who subsists by highway robbery and plunder;
generally he is desperate, and will sooner be killed than
taken alive. In the country, it is necessary to under-
stand these three names, for they are in common use.?

That under Lord Stanley?s new plan of convict dis-


cipline, this state of things is not remedied, will be
evident from the subjoined quotation, from a pamphlet,
written the latter end of May last, for private circu-
lation, and especially for the information of members of
the House of Commons, by a gentleman recently a free-
colonist in Yan Diemen?s Land. He says,
44 Absconders from the 'probation gangs , had been
numerous up to the time of the last accounts from Yan
Diemen?s Land. These men (called bush-rangers) in
armed bodies, for weeks, (sometimes for months,) run a
career of burglary, plunder, and, if resisted, murder,
against the defenceless free-settlers, who are scattered
C 5 '
over the island, at intervals of three or four miles; whole
districts ( especially those which contain probation ,
each of which is attempted to be guarded by seem
overseers) are thus kept in a distressing state of alarm
for a long period. Their formerly quiet and peaceful
homes are converted into garrisons of defence?the sole
defenders being the two or three male members of each
family; for where even emancipists and 4 ticket-of-
leave? men are employed, they cannot be entrusted with
a share of the defence, for fear of treachery ; ?so strong
and universal is known to be the fellow-feeling of those
who have been convicts for those who are convicts still.
The originally free-servants can, of course, be trusted;
but they are fast leaving the colony, and their places are
being supplied with 4 pass-holders.? A party of bush-
rangers, after having committed all kinds of violence
and robbery, and having eluded the pursuit of the police,
(for which the mountainous character of Yan Diemen?s
Land affords peculiar facilities,) after six weeks per-
haps, are captured and brought to condign punishment.
But scarcely have the unfortunate free-settlers recovered


from their terrors, when a fresh hand of armed ruffians
breaks forth from a probation gang ?and again their
nights are spent in painful watching, and their minds
fraught with fear and horror.?
The following Extracts will still more fully show the
results of Lord Stanley?s alterations. They are taken
from a letter,* dated 31st December, 1845, from Dar-
lington Probation Station, Maria Island, Van Diemen?s
Land, and addressed by Mr. James Boyd, Assistant
Superintendent of the Sir George Seymour , convict ship,
to Mr. J. S. Hampton, surgeon to the same vessel. It
appears that the gang at that station usually musters
about 600 men, and is divided into four classes. The
first is composed of the best conducted convicts; the
second of the tolerably good; the third of the indiffe-
rent; and the fourth constitutes the chain gang. These
men are permitted in a greater or less degree to asso-
ciate with each other, and the regulations are so lax,
that contamination, and continual plottings for the pur-
poses of crime and insurrection cannot be prevented.
The letter referred to states that
?The criminal habits of the convicts appear to remain
unbroken by their detention and treatment in the pro-
bation gang; and as corrupt association without sufficient
corrective influence is the great evil of the system, there
can be no doubt as to the mutual deterioration which
takes place amongst these unhappy men.
? Offences. ?These are in general of a grave nature.
The following are some of the principal crimes com-
mitted :
* See Parliamentary Papers of the last Session. No 402,
p. 73.


4 4 Attempt to murder ; insubordination and dis-
arming the military sentinel; sheep-stealing; house-
breaking; housebreaking and theft; robbery under
very aggravated circumstances; plotting and conspiring
to murder the officers and carry off the station boat;
sleeping together under suspicious circumstances, and
absconding, with violence.
* * * * * **********
44 And as to hard labour in chains, a very frequent
punishment, I must at once admit, that of all the means
of coercion I ever saw in use, this is certainly the least
effective in reclaiming the criminal. It is notorious
that the men undergoing this sentence become complete
devils. The degradation of wearing chains makes no
salutary impression, either upon themselves, or on the
other prisoners of the gang, who are constantly witness-
ing the disgusting spectacle of 40 or 50 men dragging
their clanking irons, and yoked to carts like brute
beasts.?
The demoralizing effect of the convicts upon the free
colonists may easily be imagined. The convicts or
emancipists abound in all the classes of society. They
are to be found as domestic servants in the highest as
well as in the lowest establishments in the colony ; they
are to be found in the government offices, the merchant?s
counting-house, and the huckster?s shop. In the country
districts, they fill every station of life, from the rich
landowner and farmer, to the lowest labourer that tills
the soil. It were useless to adduce evidence to show
the influence of this state of things upon the condition
of society, had we not to deal with a case in w T hich the
picturings of the imagination must fall far short of the


dark reality. It will be necessary, therefore, to enter
upon the evidence. Darwin, in the work already
quoted, makes this remark :
� How thoroughly odious to every feeling, to be waited
on by a man, who, the day before, perhaps, was flogged,
from your representation, for some trifling misdemeanor.
The female servants are, of course, much worse; hence,
children learn the vilest expressions, and it is fortunate,
if not equally vile ideas.?
In the Report before referred to, is contained the
following description of the state of society in Sydney,
which may be taken as a specimen of the other towns
in our penal colonies :
� Of the state of society in the towns of these colo-
nies, a general idea may be formed from a description of
Sydney, according to the accounts given of it by its
chief police magistrate, and by Mr. Justice Burton. In
1836, Sydney covered an area of about 2000 acres, and
contained about 20,000 inhabitants ; of this number,
3500 were convicts, most of them in assigned service,
and about 7000 had probably been prisoners of the
crown. These, together with their associates amongst
the free population, were persons of violent and uncon-
trollable passions, which most of them possessed no law T-
ful means of gratifying; incorrigibly bad characters,
preferring a life of idleness and debauchery, by means of
plunder, to one of honest industry. Burglaries and
robberies were frequently perpetrated by convict ser-
vants in the town and its vicinity, sometimes even in
the middle of the day. * * * * The
greater portion of tlie shopkeepers of the middling
class had been convicts, for the tradesmen connected


with the criminal population have an advantage over
free emigrants. Those of the emancipists who were
possessed of property had generally acquired it by dis-
honest means, by keeping grog-shops, gambling-houses,
by receiving stolen goods, and by other nefarious prac-
tices ; they led a life of gross licentiousness ; but their
wealth and influence were such, that one-fourth of the
jurors who served in the civil and criminal courts dur-
ing the years 1834, 1835, and 1836, belonged to their
number. More immorality prevailed in Sydney than
in any other town of the same size in the British
dominions ;there the vice of drunkenness had attained
its highest pitch ; the quantity of spirits consumed in
Sydney was enormous ; even throughout the whole of
New South Wales, the annual average, for every human
being in the colony, had reached four gallons a head.
With a free population, little exceeding 16,000, Sydney
contained 219 public-houses, and so many unlicensed
spirit-shops, that its chief police magistrate felt himself
incompetent to guess at the number. The greater por-
tion of these public-houses were kept by persons who
had been transported convicts, and who were notorious
drunkards, obscene persons, fighters, gamblers, receivers
of stolen goods, receivers and harbourers of thieves, and
of the most depraved of both sexes; and who existed
upon the depravity of the lower orders. Such, accord-
ing to the authorities we have quoted, are the towns to
which transportation has given birth ; and such are the
inmates furnished to them by the criminal tribunals of
this country.?
The country districts are, in the same Report, thus
described :
b 2


a In the country districts of New South W ales and
Van Diemen?s Land, the proportion of convict men to
women is, as 17 to 1. As the greater portion of the
agricultural labourers belong to the criminal population,
they constitute a peasantry unlike any other in the
world ; a peasantry without domestic feelings or affec-
tions, without parents or relations, without wives, chil-
dren, or homes ; one more strange and less attached to
the soil they till, than the negro slaves of the planter.
They dwell crowded together in miserable huts ; the
hours of recreation, which they can steal from the night,
are usually spent in the unlicensed spirit-shops to he
found in the vicinity of every estate. In these places,
kept by some ticket-of-leave man or emancipated con-
vict, the assigned servants of settlers generally purchase
the means of gratifying their appetites for liquor, gam-
ing, and every species of debauchery, by the proceeds of
their depredations on the flocks and herds, and other
property of their masters. The vicious habits of the
lower orders, the manner in which they are permitted
to live and associate with the convicts, the inefficiency
of the police, and the general want of principle in the
colony of New South Wales, are vividly depicted in the
charge of Judge Burton to the grand jury of Sydney.?
Captain Cheyne, in describing the state of convict
discipline in Van Diemen?s Land, says,
? Although the severity of the law produces an out-
ward resemblance of order, a constrained good conduct,
yet there abounds amongst us a fearful degree of immo-
rality, unparalleled, perhaps, in any age or country, and
not, I regret to say, confined to the convict population.?
The vast amount of depravity may be imagined, if


indeed anything further were required to complete the
picture, from the mention of the fact, that the number
of free persons in Van Diemen?s Land, fined in the year
1834, for drunkenness, was about 50,000, being one-
seventh of the entire free population of the island. From
recent accounts received from this island, it appears that
property is in a state of utter insecurity, in consequence
of the ease with which large numbers of convicts can
escape from the probation gangs , and commit depredations
on the surrounding free-settlers. In an authenticated
list of many daring robberies committed by probationers,
it is stated, that as many as 100, 200 and 300 sheep,
had been stolen in one night from the same owner ?
whole flocks had been shorn, the carcasses of the sheep
wantonly destroyed, and their wool carried away and
disposed of.
In an old community, where there is a deficiency of
employment, and the rate of remuneration is small, the
amount of crime is scarcely a fair index of the actual
moral depravity of the lower classes. Strong indeed
must be the force of virtue in the labouring orders, to
resist the numerous temptations to vice. But in a
young and rising colony the case is far different;
violation of the law implies much deeper moral
depravity. Crime, instead of being the forced action
of a mind goaded by necessity, is in such a case the
spontaneous manifestation of principles and motives
essentially vicious and corrupt. The state of society
exhibited by the evidence just advanced, would, under
any circumstances, be fearful, but that an infant com -
munity, which ought to display the virtues of youth,
simplicity and innocence, should be infected with more


complex villany and atrocious crime, than can be found
in our oldest and most corrupt communities, is frightful
beyond expression. This branch of the subject cannot
be more fitly concluded, than by the following extract
from the report already so frequently referred to.
? These opinions of the best informed witnesses, and
the facts stated by your committee (upon the most un-
questionable authorities) as to the amount and progres-
sive increase of crime, and as to the depravity of both
the town and country population, leave no doubt (even
if any doubt could have been entertained) of the in-
fluence of transportation on the state of society in the
penal colonies, and of the moral corruption of the free,
by the criminal portion of the community. Your com-
mittee fear, that if the existing system be continued,
the moral condition of the penal colonies is more likely
to be still further deteriorated than improved.?
Nothing is so radically bad as to be attended with no
advantages, and impartiality now requires the mention
of those benefits which accrue from punishment by
transportation. Many of our social evils, and hence
many of our crimes, arise from the density of our popu-
lation. The mere removal, therefore, of from four to
five thousand of our people every year to a distant
colony, cannot but be attended with much benefit. But
if the removal of honest and industrious citizens be a
benefit, how great must be the advantage resulting from
the annual banishment of four or five thousand persons.
?the scourge of society,?the dregs of our population.
Only one convict in fifty ever returns to this country.
If then we were justified in regarding this question,
merely in its relations to our own country, instead of,


in its effects upon the vital interests of humanity
throughout the world, transportation would, in this
respect, offer incontestable advantages. And then,
again, while the criminal is a burden upon the mother
country, he is not unfrequently a source of, at least,
temporary prosperity to the colony. To a young colony,
labour is invaluable, and in proportion to the supply,
will its advance be rapid. If the convict is not a good
citizen, he is, at least, a useful pioneer. By his labour,
lands may be cleared, roads and bridges made,, and cities
built. Hence it was, that in the early colonization of
Australia, convicts, instead of being regarded as a burden,
were received as a boon. Transportation has, also, been
considered, however incorrectly, as the cheapest mode of
disposing of our criminal classes. A distant island,
guarded on all sides by the sea, is in itself, without the
expenditure necessary for the erection of jails or other
establishments, a prison sufficiently well fitted by nature
for safe custody. The expense of the bodily support of
the criminals need not be great. A fertile soil and a
fine climate, will easily supply agricultural produce in
greater abundance than can be consumed. This antici-
pated economy has, however, proved illusive; for the
annual expense attending transportation considerably
exceeds �500,000. But the great, or, at least, the
most plausible advantage incident to transportation,
arises from the removal of the criminal into an entirely
fresh field of action. Many of the causes of crime in
this country, have no existence in the early stages of
society. Abject poverty, surrounded by unparalleled
wealth and prosperity, the great anomaly of our present
civilization, and the perpetual source of crime, cannot


exist in an infant community. A large proportion of
the crimes committed are the result of circumstances.
Society has neglected its duties; or the elements of
civilization are so imperfectly blended, and the incen-
tives to crime so strong, that virtuous conduct becomes
most difficult. The being who commits a crime,
under such circumstances, can scarcely be called a
criminal. Remove him into a state of nature, where
the good that is within him may find free development,
and you will hear no more of crime. This is the true
explanation of those cases in which transportation
has proved successful. And upon this principle, the
assignment system was often the means of effectual re-
formation. Did not our colonies combine with the
advantages of a society approaching a state of nature,
preponderating defects which render them, on the whole,
unsuited to punishment and reformation, this last men-
tioned advantage would possess much weight. The
benefits which have been enumerated, serve merely to
show what has been before stated, that nothing can be
so bad as not to possess some peculiar recommendations.
It being evident that transportation always has been
attended with radical and enormous evils, it now re-
mains to be shown that it is not susceptible of such
improvement, as to render it a system of efficient
punishment and reformation, and compatible with the
well-being of the free colonists.
An obvious and essential objection to the system, is
the expense of transport; and not only the expense, but
the demoralization. It is almost impossible to arrange
the prisoners on ship-board, so as to prevent con-
tamination. During the lassitude of a long sea voyage,


the more desperate criminals entertain their less ex-
perienced comrades, by the relation of their exploits.
The greater the criminal, the greater the hero ; and
those who had hitherto done few deeds of valour, leave
the ship with the determination of signalizing themselves
in future.
Another evil incident to transportation, is the removal
of punishment to so great a distance as to destroy, in a
considerable degree, its deterring influence upon the
community at home. Punishment, in order to attain
its primary object, the excitement of terror in mankind
in general, should be brought continually before the
mind of every individual. Not indeed in all its loath-
some and debasing details, by the public and continued
exposure of the criminal, but rather by a system admi-
nistered in this country; and which shall be well known,
because it is near at hand, which shall be dreaded, be-
cause it is both near and known. The penalty inflicted
by the law should be made a present existence; a vivid
reality, invariably connected with crime. Distance ren-
ders the suffering of the convict either unknown, or
unnoticed; while it lends enchantment to his prosperity.
Still further, the characteristic advantages of trans-
portation are incompatible with efficacious punishment.
The advantages are, the supply of that labour of which
the colonies so greatly stand in need ; the economy in
expense, arising from the regulations not requiring an
extensive construction of jails, or any other complicated
penal apparatus; and the comparative freedom from
restraint, which in a rude state of society can be per-
mitted, and which enables the convict, instead of being-
subjected to an irksome confinement, at once to enter
b 3
i
/


upon the duties and functions of freedom. Now these
benefits, supposing them to have an existence, are
evidently inconsistent with punishment as an instru-
ment of terror. If ever realized, they would place the
convict in an infinitely higher position than any to
which the honest labourer at home can possibly attain.
It is evident then, that if you render transportation
efficient as a punishment, its pretended advantages are
at once destroyed. If jails, and a stringent and effective
form of discipline are to be established, it is much
better that they should be established at home, and
transportation forthwith abandoned. The advantages
that would accrue, would be considerable; Ist, The re-
duction in the expense of conveying the criminal to his
destination, and of providing officers and superintendents
for his control; 2ndly, The benefit of having our penal
establishments more immediately under the eyes of the
government and of the public, so that any defects might
the more readily be detected and corrected : and, lastly,
the impression which the infliction of punishment at
home, instead of at a distance, would produce upon
those disposed to the commission of crime.
All the objections which have been urged against
transportation as a system of punishment, apply to it
equally as a means of reformation. If the discipline be
rendered efficacious as an instrument of reformation,
transportation will have lost its advantages, and refor-
mation had much better be carried on at home. The
reasons which prevent transportation from being effec-
tive as a punishment, apply to it even still more strongly
as a medium of reformation. When reformation can be
anticipated from the restorative tendencies of nature; a


return to nature, and to a simple condition of society,
seems well calculated to attain the object. But physical
and mental disease is often too inveterate to be overcome
by the powers of nature ; it requires all the skill and
tact wdiich ingenuity and experience can devise. The
care, however, and the skill which are necessary for the
restoration of bodily health, will scarcely admit of com-
parison with the nice discrimination of the different
manifestations of mind, the knowledge of its healthy
functions and diseased anatomy, the construction of
instruments sufficiently delicate, and yet adequately
potent, which are all implied and required in any regu-
lations for the restoration of mental health. It is hardly
necessary to say, that these requisites cannot be found in
an infant community. They imply an almost perfect,
social and political organization ; while the structure of
society in its early stages is necessarily exceedingly in-
complete. The instruments at its command are almost
too imperfect for punishment, and completely ineffectual
for reformation. It is the earliest and lowest form of
social and political existence, in which all the functions
of government are invariably feeble. In these early
stages of development, law and order have as yet but
incompletely emerged from a state of chaos; social and
political, and even moral obligations, are of but little
force, and public virtue and honour struggle for a pre-
carious existence. In such a state of social debility, it
would be preposterous to expect that the morally dis-
eased can be restored to mental tone and vigour.
It having been shown that transportation is, as re-
gards the convict, necessarily inefficient as a means both
of punishment and of reformation, it now remains to
examine what are its natural effects upon the free


colonists. In the first place, it is to be observed that,
transportation is actually nothing less than a particular
form of slavery; and like slavery it degrades and pol-
lutes not only the slave, hut the slave-holder. Trans-
portation accordingly, has ever rendered, and always
will render, the free colonist, hard-hearted, cruel, and
vindictive. The reverence for humanity and its rights;
the recognition of the image of God in every human
being, are scarcely compatible with the public and
continued exhibition of that noble form degraded by
crime, and still further degraded by punishment. Let
the existence and severity of punishment be fully
known ; but let not its loathsome details be continually
exposed to public view, lest all that is manly and
aspiring in our nature, by contamination, become cor-
rupted. It is indeed a great objection to transportation
that it perpetually subjects the virtues of society to this
corruption.
Transportation has also, like slavery, the effect of
destroying all dignity in labour. The convict having
himself lost all nobility of nature, cannot, like the
independent citizen, elevate his employment; but
throws into it his own debasement and dishonour.
The labour-market too, is interfered with. The trans-
ported convict is brought into competition with the free
labourer. The market price of labour is artificially
depressed, and an animosity thus arises between the
convict-population and the free.
When by transportation a large number of criminals
are accumulated in any community, there will be great
difficulty in devising a government, and law T s suited to
conditions so opposite as those of the convict and the
free populations. The amount of liberty with which a


people can be entrusted, will correspond to the amount
of their intelligence and virtue. No form of govern-
ment is abstractedly the best, but that government is
practically the best, which most nearly corresponds
with the attainments and position of its people. The
convicts require stringent and rigid institutions : the
free settlers have a right to expect and demand muni-
cipal establishments, the elective franchise, and a respon-
sible government. In a society composed of two such
opposite elements, it will be impossible to devise a govern-
i
ment and laws, which shall combine sufficient power
for the control of the one class, with sufficient freedom
and political privileges for the expansion of the other.
Public opinion is one of the strongest sanctions to
public and private virtue. To a large portion of man-
kind, who can neither think for themselves, nor act for
themselves, who are mere shams, public opinion is the
touchstone of truth and of virtue. Now it is the ten-
dency of transportation to corrupt this second moral
sense. In our penal settlements, public opinion has not
been the sanction of virtue, but the safeguard of vice ;
and judging from the very nature of the case, it ap-
pears impossible that it can ever be otherwise.
No community can be happily constituted, which
contains a preponderance of any particular class, even
if that class be exalted in character. Supposing a body
of men, chiefly composed of metaphysicians or philo-
sophers, were to form themselves into a distinct com-
munity ; Would it prosper ? Would it not be a depar-
ture from the order of nature, which produces complete-
ness and unity out of endless variety ? But if it be
inconsistent with the interests of society, that one of the
w?


highest forms of humanity be combined in undue pro-
portions ; what must be the effect of the great pre-
ponderance of a principle in itself pernicious and
deadly ? Imagine 3000, nay, even 30 criminals, an-
nually turned loose upon one of the counties of England,
instead of being sent to Van Diemen?s Land; is it pos-
sible to conceive a greater moral pestilence ? It does
appear most awful to be thus concentrating the incar-
nation of evil upon any spot of God?s earth, and to be
thus blasting with the worst of curses the infancy of
a nation. It is vain to say that our colonies being
our own, we have a right to use them as we like. We
have not a right to do what we like with our own;
property has its duties, as well as its privileges. And
it is the first duty of a government to see, that no course
be adopted which is decidedly injurious to even its
most distant subjects. It has sometimes been urged,
that the free emigrants had full notice before leaving
this country, that convicts would be sent to the colony,
and that therefore they cannot charge the government
with evils, which they themselves have voluntarily in-
curred. It is a sufficient answer to the objection to
observe, that it is not the object of these pages to
ascertain what parties can be criminated in the matter,
or to decide whether the free colonists have a right to
proclaim their injuries, and appeal to this country for
redress; their object is to examine into the whole
system, and expose its gross evils, and if possible to
point out a remedy. When it is known that the tem-
poral and eternal interests of humanity are in jeopardy,
the puerile technicality of original consent by the parties
injured and complaining, will be no sooner pleaded,


than overruled and condemned. To found a nation has
been deemed a noble enterprise; and how best to
mingle the germs of future greatness, has been thought
well worthy the attention of the philosopher and states-
man. But never had the plan been conceived, of
throwing together a band of criminals as the pilgrim
fathers to a distant land. The ultimate result of such
a scheme, it is in no wise difficult to conjecture. It
may be the morbid cankering of mental disease from
generation to generation; the gradual, but continued
increase of vice, and decrease of virtue. Or evil may
assume a more potent form; disorganization and con-
vulsion may supervene, not the struggle of men panting
for their rights, but the onslaught of ruffians thirsting
for blood and plunder. Each nation should sustain the
burden of its own criminal population, and not seek to
throw the pestilence upon others. It is desirable that
each nation should feel the full burden; that the state
may know the penalty of neglecting education; that
the church may be made fully sensible of its obligations
to the poor; and that society at large may be compelled
to perform its long neglected duties to its people.
This division of the subject, treating of the essential
and inevitable evils of transportation cannot be better
concluded, than by the following extract from the Re-
port, so often referred to, of the Committee of the House
of Commons upon Transportation.
u Your committee having in the preceding pages of
their Report, discussed the nature and effects of trans-
portation, and what alterations can be made in the
existing system, now T consider that they have sub-
mitted the most unquestionable proofs that the two


main characteristics of transportation, as a punishment,
are inefficiency in deterring from crime, and remarkable
efficiency, not in reforming, but in still further cor-
rupting those who undergo the punishment; that these
qualities of inefficiency for good, and efficiency for evil,
are inherent in the system, which therefore is not sus-
ceptible of any satisfactory improvement; and lastly,
that there belongs to the system, extrinsically from its
strange character as a punishment, the yet more curious
and monstrous evil of calling into existence, and con-
tinually extending, societies or the germs of nations
most thoroughly depraved, as respects both the cha-
racter and degree of their vicious propensities. Your
committee, therefore are of opinion, that the present
system of transportation should be abolished, and will
now proceed to offer a few observations as to the de-
scription of punishment, which, in their opinion, ought
to be substituted in the stead of transportation.?
Since the date of this Report, a plan of penal discipline
has been prominently brought before the public, which
in part at least, may be well incorporated in a reformed
system of punishment.?Captain Maconochie was three
years Governor of Norfolk Island, during which period,
he partially tried, under great disadvantages, a novel
and ingenious mode of penal discipline. He is a man
of much practical knowledge of the criminal phenomena
of human nature, and with his experience, he combines
bold speculation, warm philanthropy, and sanguine
enthusiasm. His sanguine benevolence however has
perhaps carried him somewhat astray. Like many of
the reformers of the present day, his views of human
nature are too hopeful; he relies too much upon the


innate and dormant virtues which he believes to be
still present in the worst of criminals, while he seems
scarcely conscious of the deep-rooted depravity which
it is sometimes absolutely impossible by any system of
discipline to eradicate. His plan may be adapted
either to transportation, or to a system of peniten-
tiaries. Transportation it might possibly improve, but
could never radically reform : it will therefore now be
considered, in reference merely to the system of peni-
tentiaries, which will here be proposed as a substitute
for transportation.
His plan has three marked characteristics. In the
first place, it proposes, that instead of the length of im-
prisonment being measured by months or years, it shall
be regulated by a certain amount of labour to be per-
formed. 2ndly, That this labour shall be estimated at
a given number of marks, to be placed to the debit of
the criminal, in a book kept for the purpose. That this
debit shall, from time to time, be further augmented by
any fines in the same currency, that may be imposed
for misconduct, and by charges made for all supplies of
food and clothing. The duration of his sentence will
thus be made to depend on three circumstances. First,
the gravity of the original offence, which will regulate
the amount of the original debit. Second, the amount
and value of his labour in the works allotted to him,
for which he will be paid in marks, and which will
furnish him with the means of gradually diminishing his
debits, by adding to the credit side of his account. And,
lastly, upon his conduct during confinement. If "well
conducted, he will avoid fines, and if economical in food
and such other gratifications as he may be allowed to


purchase with his marks, he will keep down the amount
of his debits. The third distinctive feature in the
system is, that after the prisoner has passed through a
term of probation in separate confinement, he is advanced
into a social state. For this purpose, he becomes a mem-
ber of a class of six or eight, which is as completely
separated from other classes of the same description, as
one individual is separated from another individual in
the prior stage. All the members of a class are to have
a common interest ; the marks earned or lost by each
prisoner, are to be placed to the credit or debit of his
party, and not to his separate account.
Of the actual results of Captain Maconochie?s go-
vernment at Norfolk Island, there is great diversity of
opinion. His enemies represent his treatment as a
failure; his friends, and perhaps those most free from
prejudice on the subject, consider that he was as success-
ful as could be expected under the unfavourable circum-
stances in which he was placed. After reading the
voluminous correspondence ordered to be printed, during
the last session of Parliament, by the House of Lords,
upon the convict-system administered in Norfolk Island,
under his superintendence, the writer of these remarks
still remains in considerable doubt upon the practical re-
sults of the new mode of discipline. It is, however, to
be borne in mind, that Captain Maconochie?s system was
never thoroughly adopted, and that he altogether denies
the fairness and completeness of the trial by which its
merits have been tested. It is difficult to arrive at the
facts of the case, so contradictory are the accounts. And
after having ascertained what was the actual state of
the convicts, it is still more difficult to determine


whether the improvements, if any, arose from the merits
of his system, or from the vitality and generous ardour
which his personal superintendence would infuse into
any arrangements. And on the other hand, it is equally
difficult to decide, whether the evils which were un-
doubtedly prevalent, ought to be referred to his system,
or to a departure from his system, or whether, indeed,
they were not such as are inherent to all penal discipline,
and beyond the powers of any remedy. The following
extracts, it is believed, will give a tolerably correct idea
of the actual state of things towards the close of Captain
Maconochie?s government in the Island. They are
taken from a despatch, dated Ist April, 1843, of Sir
George Gipps, the late Governor of New South Wales,
addressed to Lord Stanley. The whole of the despatch
is written in a temperate spirit, and displays an im-
partiality which entitles it to confidence. Sir George
says,?
? Notwithstanding that my arrival at Norfolk Island
was altogether unexpected, I found good order [every
where to prevail, and the demeanour of the prisoners to
be respectful and quiet. The first impression produced
on me was therefore a favourable one. During my stay
on the island, I visited every part of it, minutely in-
spected every establishment, (almost every house) and
separately questioned or examined every person having
any charge or authority, however small ; taking down
in writing the substance of what each individual stated
to me, whilst he was yet present, though I did not
think it right to administer to any one an oath.?
It should be stated, that the prisoners consisted of
two classes; Ist, of the convicts who had been guilty of
crime during the period of their transportation, and had


been sent to Norfolk Island for severe punishment;
and, 2ndly, of the convicts who were sent to the island
immediately upon their arrival from England. It is to
this latter class, that the following extracts refer. They
strikingly show the difficulty of arriving at a correct
opinion upon the results of the discipline adopted. Sir
George thus proceeds ;
u I now come to the most important part of my sub-
ject, but the one on which it is most difficult to speak
with any degree of certainty, and, indeed, on which,
whatever I may say can scarcely amount to more than
conjecture , ?-I mean the degree of moral improvement
which these men have received during their three years?
residence at Norfolk Island, and the way in which they
may be expected to behave when restored to society.
? That there are many good men among them, and
men who may be expected to behave well in Van
Diemen?s Land, cannot be doubted ; but whether they
will, when removed from Norfolk Island, behave better
than an equal number of men taken promiscuously from
the convict population of New South Wales, ?better,
that is to say, than if, instead of having been placed at
Norfolk Island, they had gone through the ordinary
course of convict discipline in New South Wales, ?is
the point on which I cannot pronounce any decided
opinion. Having been treated more mildly, fewer of
them have probably become hardened in iniquity; but,
on the other hand, not having acquired a knowledge of
the nature of the society with which they will have to
mix, of the duties which will be expected of them, or
even of the kind of labour they will have to perform,
they will be so much the more likely to fall into irre-
gularities of life. * * * *


u And though these men have not been exposed to
that severity (or rather to the chances of that severity)
which often brutalizes a man in New South Wales,
where a convict?s life is one of extreme chances, yet
they have become in Norfolk Island familiarized at
least with one detestable crime, before unknown to
them, and addicted (especially of late) to one very de-
moralizing vice: the vice is that of gambling, ?the
crime, the one most repugnant to human nature. * *
u Thieving from each other, also, prevails, though,
from what I heard, I should say scarcely to such a
degree as among convicts in general. On this head,
however, it was remarked to me, nearly by every person
with whom I conversed, that those who had been
thieves remained thieves, and would be thieves wher-
ever they might go; an important admission (if true)
of the little reformation which has taken place or is to
be expected in them. Common thieves and pick-pockets,
are considered, at Norfolk Island, as elsewhere, the
least reclaimable of convicts.?
It must be confessed, that these extracts give no very
favourable view of the reformation wrought upon the
convicts ; yet, the writer of these pages cannot but
think, that although Captain Maconochie s system
may contain some errors, it is, nevertheless, sound in
its leading principles. And that, being sound in its
leading principles, it will be found, when carefully and
wisely carried out, with those modifications which will
afterwards be suggested, to be sound in practice also.
The trial of his system may be almost regarded as no
trial at all. Destitute of the requisite appliances, and
of that cordial co-operation which is necessary to sue-


cess, thwarted by prejudice, and, more than all, incor-
porated and infected with that demoralizing system of
transportation which pollutes whatever it touches, it
would require a plan perfect in every part, administered
by a power and wisdom more than human to secure
success. Effectually to reform that which is radically
bad is hopeless ; and to attempt it, is a waste of valu-
able resources. Captain Maconochie and his system,
for the reputation of both, should be dissociated from
transportation, and the fearful failures to which it is
continually subject, tie states, that his plans are as
applicable to penitentiaries as to transportation ; and
there is every reason to believe, that if, with some limi-
tations, they were introduced into prison discipline, the
result would be successful. His plans should be re-
garded as at present, but comparatively immature:
time and experience will be required to develop their
resources, and correct their errors. He has already
gained somewhat by experience, and either he or the
public, will gain still more. The following extract from
the despatch of Sir George Gipps, before referred to,
will show that Captain Maconochie?s stay at Norfolk
Island was not without instruction.
?Whether Captain Maconochie?s system shall further
be tried or not, is of course a question for the decision
of Her Majesty?s Government; and without either ad-
vocating or discouraging the further trial of it, I feel it
right to say that I should regret to see the experience
wholly thrown away which Captain Maconochie has,
during the last three years, gained in the management
of prisoners. He admits, that in respect to the manner
in which his principles should be applied, experience


has taught him some useful lessons. He is fully aware
of the necessity of a sterner and more severe application
of his principles than any which he has yet attempted,
and especially in the early or punitory stages of his
system; and he fully also admits, that in the distribu-
tion of marks (the great engine of his system) he has
hitherto been too lavish.?
If transportation ought to be abolished, what form of
penal discipline should be adopted in its stead ? This
is the question which it now remains to answer.
Captain Maconochie?s system, although correct in its
leading features, is in some measure based upon what
cannot but be regarded as a serious error. As before
observed, he strenuously maintains and embodies the
principle, that the sole object of penal regulations is
reformation. This defect however, may, without much
practical difficulty, be remedied. It is a happy cir-
cumstance that the discipline which is most fitted for
punishment, is also most conducive to reformation.
The infliction of mere physical pain is as much as
possible to be avoided; it excites animosity and ill feel-
ing, and is not so efficacious and intense as punishment
more directly inflicted on the mind. As there is a
peace which the world cannot give, so there is a pain
which the world cannot inflict. A calm and continued
reflection in solitude upon a life of error, produces a
pain and an anguish more intense than the infliction
of bodily suffering and privation. Thus the severest
punishment is the first step to reformation. It has been
said, that heaven itself would be a place of punishment
to the wicked; their passions, their tastes, their whole
natures, being discordant with that abode of bliss, that
*>
S


which to the good was unspeakable joy, would to
the wicked be intense misery. However this may be,
certain it is, that solitude which to the innocent is
the source of peace, and an opportunity for pleasurable
reflection, is to the guilty, owing to an incompatibility
in their nature, intolerable suffering. In penal discipline,
it is a great art to make crime its own punishment.
When it is thus self-inflicted, it can excite no feeling of
rebellion ; like the punishment dispensed by the laws of
God, it results naturally from transgression. It is also
to be observed that when thus inflicted, the amount of
punishment will be proportioned to the amount of crime.
The greater the departure from rectitude, the greater the
difficulty of return. It must not however be supposed,
that punishment can be rendered complete, without the
actual infliction of bodily suffering. Many of the worst
criminals, although they may suffer greatly in the
separation from their old haunts and associates, will
scarcely feel the anguish of remorse. Such men can be
acted upon only through the body ; in such cases at
least, bodily privation and punishment must be inflicted.
There can, however, be no doubt, that wherever refor-
mation is possible, it can be accomplished in great
measure by the same means and instruments by which
punishment is inflicted. But although there exists this
general accordance between the objects of punishment
and reformation, still the result of denying the separate
existence of punishment, or as Captain Maconochie
choses, though falsely to call it, ? vindictive punish-
ment,? is evident throughout his entire arrangements.
It constantly betrays him into a false benevolence,
which in the end defeats itself. It induces him to
T
i


neglect severity where necessary, and to trust rather
to a benevolence, sometimes more conspicuous for its
startling and theatrical display, than for its calm dis-
crimination and judgment.
In every form of penal discipline, imprisonment must
constitute, if not the sole, at least, one of the principal
elements. But the forms of prison discipline are so
various that a somewhat minute examination will be
necessary to determine which regulations are the best.
In America experiments have been tried upon a grand
scale, experiments which leave but little doubt as to the
character of the discipline, it is most expedient for us
to adopt. The silent system has been tried, and it is
almost the universal opinion of those entitled to speak
upon the subject, that it has failed. It attempts to
enforce silence and seclusion upon men who are working
in the society of each other. An attempt in which it
has always been impossible to succeed, even when
severe and sanguinary measures are employed. At
Sing-Sing in the state of New York, there is an
establishment upon this principle. The criminals during
the day are employed beyond the limits of the prison,
in quarrying marble; 900 have at times been thus
occupied under the superintendence of 30 keepers. In
order to preserve discipline, the keepers are able to
communicate with each other, and are each armed with
muskets. The prisoners are prohibited from speaking,
and are required to pursue their labour with down-cast
eyes: and if they attempt to communicate with each
other, they are instantly flogged in the presence of their
companions. They work unchained, and in order to
prevent escape, armed sentinels are employed, it being


considered less objectionable to shoot the criminal than
to adopt the ordinary means by which safe custody is
secured.* It is not intended to assert that the silent
system is necessarily accompanied by these violent
measures; but with whatever modification it may be
enforced, more or less of the evils which have here been
mentioned, and which are to be found in an exaggerated
form at Sing-Sing, will be invariably present.
Strictly solitary imprisonment is deservedly and uni-
versally condemned. It indeed excludes contamination;
but at the same time it excludes industry and improve-
ment : and by debarring the prisoner from all associa-
tion, induces either imbecility or madness. But there
is a system w T hich whilst it separates from all that is
demoralizing, brings the prisoner into close association
with all improving agencies.
The Eastern Penitentiary of Philadelphia, has been
in successful operation since the year 1829, and is con-
structed and regulated upon the separate system. The
health of the convict is examined upon his admission
by the penitentiary physician. He then undergoes a
thorough cleansing, and is clothed in the prison dress.
He is informed of the regulations by which the prison
is governed, and the necessity of his complying with
them is enforced. He then enters his cell, and for
several days remains in total seclusion, without books,
labour, or society. He there reflects upon his crimes,
becomes subdued in mind, and tractable in disposition.
After a few days, the solitude becomes intolerable,
labour is no longer shunned, but is solicited as a favour.
* See report of the Select Committee of the House of
Commons on Transportation, p. 38.


The bible and other books are eagerly sought for,
and instruction, either intellectual, moral, or religious,
is willingly received. During the whole of his confine-
ment, he is known by the officers of the penitentiary
only by his number; and to prevent recognition among
the prisoners upon their liberation, hoods are placed,
over their eyes whenever they leave their cells. They
are all employed in some useful manual occupation,
selected according to their inclination, or previous modes
of life. In winter, they rise at daybreak, in summer,
at from half past 4 to 5 o?clock; and they go to bed
at 9 or 10 o?clock at night.
This prison has served as a model for many others,
both in America and Europe. The prison at Penton-
ville, in this country, is constructed upon similar plans,
and governed by similar regulations. In the Report of
the Pentonville establishment for the year 1844, signed
by Lords Wharncliffe, Richmond, Devon, Chichester,
Lord John Russell, Messieurs Charles Shaw Lefevre,
B. C. Brodie, Robert Ferguson, J. Jebb, William
Crawford, and Whitworth Russell, the commissioners
of the prison appointed by government, the following
account is given of the discipline there enforced.
44 When the prisoner is first placed in his cell, the
principal rules affecting his conduct and treatment are
explained to him. Strictly separated from his fellow-
prisoners, and prohibited from holding intercourse with
them, he is compelled to reflect upon his past mis-
deeds. ******* These reflections, under
such circumstances, are calculated to produce feelings
of sorrow and remorse; but his seclusion is mitigated
by being allowed daily exercise in the open air; by
c 2


daily attendance at cliapel, and in the school classes on
alternate days ; by his occupation at a trade; by the
books supplied him in his cell; and by the power of
having access at all times to a prison officer. The
cleanliness and effective ventilation of his cell, and the
nature of its simple but convenient arrangements, con -
tribute to the maintenance of the prisoner s health and
spirits. He also receives daily visits from the officers ;
has frequent intercourse in his cell with the chaplain
and schoolmaster; has the use of books well calculated
to advance his improvement, and is for the greater part
of his time occupied at a trade.?
To this system of prison discipline there are some
serious objections, which will afterwards be stated and
examined, but int he first place, it will be well to devote
a few pages to the consideration of its advantages.
It is obvious that it is well fitted for reformation.
When a criminal is in the society of his fellows, he is
prevented by a false shame or heroism from surrendering
himself to remorse; and so in order to sustain the excite-
ment of his previous course of crime, and thus to stifle
conscience in the turmoil of passion, he is in idea and
conversation, continually re-enacting his past crimes and
plotting for the future. But in the seclusion of separate
confinement, his mind is overwhelmed by a calamity,
which virtue alone can mitigate. It is severe in pro-
portion to his crime, it becomes alleviated only in pro-
portion to his reformation. It has the advantage of being
severest at the commencement, when punishment is most
deserved, and of decreasing gradually towards the time
of his liberation, when it is least required. This opera-
tion has the recommendation of being self-adjusting: but


there is another advantage, not less important, of which,
a skilful superintendent will avail himself. The mind
becomes exceedingly susceptible of all reforming in-
fluences ; like a man under a great calamity, he resolves
to forsake evil and to amend his ways. The prison in-
structor and chaplain, has all human instruments of
reformation at his command, and if well versed in
character, can accurately adapt his agencies to the pecu-
liarities of each individual case. He can subdue, or
incite; he can encourage by hope, or overwhelm by
despair. Insubordination can be checked, and obedience
rewarded. Complete reformation, in all cases, can under
no form of discipline be expected; but it may confi-
dently be affirmed, that no system is better calculated
than the separate, for securing, at least, the first stages
of improvement. It will afterwards be shown, that for
the more advanced stages, and for prolonged periods, it
is not so well adapted.
It is worthy of notice, that in this form of discipline the
power of the law is supreme, without being either in reality
or appearance vindictive. In other forms of prison dis-
cipline, the criminal is intent upon schemes by which
his punishment may be evaded; but in this he finds,
that the only means by which his suffering can be
abated is by good conduct; for idleness is no longer a
pleasure, but a punishment; and official supervision is
so complete, that transgression is almost invariably fol-
lowed by increased severity. The power of the law is
thus, as has been already observed, felt to be supreme,
but it is not vindictive. The administration is calm
and dignified, truly suited to the majesty of law. The
arrangements are most benign, having for their especial
object, the improvement and real welfare of the sufferer.


They excite no feeling of rebellion, for they subdue
almbst more by kindness than by severity. They do
not degrade, they elevate; nor do they require the
criminal to act as a man, while he is treated as a brute.
They recognise his humanity, and only wish to render
it more conspicuous. They respect his rights, and wish
to teach him, really to know them and respect them
himself, and to respect the rights of others also. While
separate confinement is thus nobly calculated to attain,
at least, the first stages of reformation, it is not less
suited to accomplish the other principal object of punish-
ment. It can be rendered even more severe than any
corporal pain. Its severity can also be adjusted to the
requisites of each individual case. For prisoners before
trial it can be rendered an innocuous and lenient means
of safe custody; for the convicted criminal, the severest
punishment to himself, and a terror and warning to
society. In confirmation of the accuracy of these
opinions, and in proof of the success that has attended
the system, it may be well to make several quotations
from reports and other publications upon the subject.
In the Report for 1833, of the Eastern Penitentiary of
Philadelphia, it is stated by the Inspectors, that,
? Our official visits furnish us with abundant testi-
mony of the disposition to reform in nearly all who are
confined. We mark generally, that at first, the prisoner
indulges in morose or vindictive feelings, and is guilty of
turbulent and malicious conduct. But after a few weeks,
he adopts a more subdued tone, becomes reasonable, and
his countenance indicates a more reasonable state of
mind; is disposed to talk of his past life as one of
misery and folly; begins to think that the barrier be-
tween him and a good reputation is not impassable, and


that there are those in the community whose prejudices
against the condemned are not so strong as to induce
the withholding a friendly countenance to his attempts
at restoration. In many, the retrospect of life becomes
a horrible and loathsome subject of reflection ?the sense
of shame and feelings of remorse drive them to some
source of consolation; and the ordinary means of stifling
an actively reproving conscience being denied by reason
of their solitariness, the comforts of the bible and the
peace of religion are early sought for.?
M. M. de Beamont and de Tocqueville, in their work
upon the penitentiaries of America, record their exami-
nations of the prisoners at this penitentiary, from which
the following are extracts. These extracts clearly show
that the system is compatible with severity.
u No. 41. Do you find it difficult to endure solitude ?
Ah ! sir, it is the most dreadful punishment that can
be imagined.
44 No. 46. Solitude seems to him a punishment ex
tremely hard.
a No 61. Says that nobody can imagine the horrid
punishment of continued solitude.
? No. 62. A well educated man, 32 years old; was
a physician; solitary confinement seems to have made a
profound impression upon this young man. 4 Solitary
confinement/ said he, 4 is very painful; but I ? neverthe-
less consider it is a measure eminently useful to society.?
44 No. 83. Thirty years of age; re-committed. In
Baltimore, where he was detained, the discipline was
very severe, and the daily labour very great.
44 Do you prefer being here ? 4 No ; I should prefer to
return to Baltimore, because there is no solitude there.??
The following quotation is from the ninth report of


the same penitentiary. It contains important evidence
upon the health of the prisoners, a point upon which
many fears may well be entertained.
44 The experience of another year enables us to state,
that no instance of insanity has, occurred in this institu-
tion which has been produced by solitary or separate
confinement, operating injuriously upon the mind. Cases
of dementia , the effects of vicious conduct, occur every
year, but they usually yield to medical remedies. The
fears which some entertained as to the influence of long
confinement, in injuring the health of the body as well
as the mind of the prisoner, have proved groundless.
One who has been confined for seven years, was recently
discharged in good health, reformed in temper and con-
duct and is now doing well. When he was convicted,
he declared that he preferred death to confinement for
seven years in the cells. When discharged, he expressed
grateful feelings for the kindness manifested for him ;
declaring that he received benefits which would never be
forgotten, and which he hoped never to lose.
1,4 There are some prisoners now in the institution, who
have been in confinement for eight years?some six,
and some five years; and all of them in good health.
Among the healthiest prisoners are those who have been
the longest time in prison. Many of our discharged
prisoners are doing well, and some exhibit satisfactory
evidence of reformation of heart and life.?
The beneficial effects of labour upon the prisoners, and
the willingness with which it is performed, may be seen
from the following extracts from the work of M. M. de
Beamont and de Tocqueville, before mentioned. Re-
ferring to the Eastern Penitentiary of Philadelphia, it is
stated, that.


? Nowhere else is the necessity of labour more urgent.
At the same time, it would be inaccurate to say, that in
the Philadelphia Penitentiary, labour is imposed ; we
may say, with more justice, that the favour of labour is
granted. When we visited this penitentiary, we succes-
sively conversed with all its inmates. There was not a
single one among them who did not speak of labour with
a kind of gratitude, and wdio did not express the idea, that
without the relief of constant occupation, life would be
insupportable. What would become of the prisoner
during the long hours of solitude without this relief,
O O
given up to himself, a prey to remorse and to the terrors
of his imagination? Labour gives to the solitary cell
an interest; it fatigues the body, and relieves the mind.
It is very remarkable that these men, the greater part
of whom have been led to crime by indolence and idle-
ness, should be constrained to find in labour their only
comfort. By detesting idleness, they accustom them-
selves to hate the primary cause of their misfortune ;
and labour, by comforting them, makes them love the
only means which, when again free, will enable them
honestly to gain their livelihood.?
The following examinations quoted from the same
work, and referring to the Eastern Penitentiary of
Philadelphia, will indicate the mental and religious con-
dition of at least some of the prisoners :
?N0.41. (A young man) confesses his guilt; sheds
tears during our whole conversation.
? Of what do you think most ??Of religion ; religious
ideas are my greatest consolation.
? Do you now and then see a minister? ?Yes, every
Sunday.
c 3


?Do you like to converse with him ??lt is a great
happiness to be allowed to talk with him.
? No. 56. Says he loves solitude; he wishes to lose
%
sight of his former acquaintances, and form no new
ones : shows his bihle, and assures us that he draws his
greatest consolation from this book.
? No. 61. Asked how he passes his time; ?he says
there are but two ways?labour and reading his bible;
the bible is his greatest consolation. He seems to be
strongly actuated by religious ideas: his conversation is
animated. He cannot speak long without being ,
and shedding tears. We have made the same remark of
all whom we have seen.
? No. 20. He says, that at first solitude was insuffer-
able, but custom gradually reconciles one to it: labour
becomes entertaining, and the bible a pleasure. The
turn of ideas in this prisoner is peculiarly grave and
religious. It is a remark we have had occasion to make
upon almost all whom ice have visited.?
Although every person must be delighted to see
amongst the prisoners proofs of advancement in religion,
yet it is too evident that there is in these extracts an in-
dication of a morbid excitability and melancholy feeling,
incompatible with a healthy mind. Unless great care
be taken, there is always much danger of the prisoners
in these establishments becoming a prey to religious
melancholy. With due attention, however, absolute in-
sanity may be prevented; but whether the mind can be
maintained in full vigour is a question upon which there
is considerable doubt, and which will subsequently claim
our attentiveconsideration.
Captain Marryat, in his Diary in America , gives the


evidence of several of the prisoners he examined in the
Philadelphia Penitentiary. Upon the whole, the evidence
cannot be considered so favourable as that before quoted.
The following extract from the deposition of ? a very in-
telligent, but not educated man,? imprisoned for stealing,
contains an interesting comparison of the merits of the
silent and separate systems :
? He had been a few months in the penitentiary, but
had been confined for ten years in Sing Sing prison for
picking pockets. I asked him his opinion as to the
difference of treatment in the two establishments. He
replied, in Sing Sing the punishment is corporal ?here
it is more mental. In Sing Sing there was little chance
of a person?s reformation, as the treatment was harsh
and brutal, and the feelings of the prisoners were those
of indignation and resentment. Their whole time was
occupied in trying how they could deceive their keepers,
and communicate with each other by every variety of
stratagem. Here a man was left to his own reflections,
and at the same time he was treated like a Here
he was his own tormentor; at Sing Sing he was tor-
mented by others. * * * Again, at Sing Sing they
all worked in company and knew each other; when
they met again after they were discharged, they enticed
one another to do wrong again. He was convinced that
no man left Sing Sing a better man than he went in.
Here he felt very often that he could become better?
perhaps he might. At all events his mind was calm,
and he had no feelings of resentment for his treatment.
He had now leisure and quiet for self-examination, if
he chose to avail himself of it. * * * * * * *
The flogging was very severe at Sing Sing. He once
ventured to express his opinion that such was the case,


and (to prove the contrary, he supposed) they awarded
him eighty-seven lashes for the information.?
The encouraging success which has attended the in-
troduction of the separate system into England, at the
Pentonville Model Prison may he seen from the conclud-
ing remarks in the Report for the year 1844 of the
commissioners before mentioned. The report thus
concludes:?
u In our last report, we adverted to the numerous
practical difficulties which had occurred, during the
first year of bringing into operation, on a large scale, a
system of discipline which was before untried in this
country. These difficulties, and the inexperience of the
prison officers, had subjected the discipline to a severe
test. We were however satisfied with the general re-
sults ; the health of the prisoners had been maintained ;
there were unequivocal proofs of their moral and re-
ligious improvement, and of the cheerful spirit of in-
dustry that prevailed amongst them; and there was
evidence that the penal character of the discipline, had
not been sacrificed to the means adopted for instruction
and reformation. The experience gained during the last
year has fully confirmed the opinion we before ex-
pressed, and has multiplied the facts upon which that
opinion was founded. There has not occurred during
the whole of the year 1844, and up to the present date,
a single case of mental alienation, nor any circum-
o ' ?/
stance which would lead us to doubt the practicability
of maintaining the discipline of separate confinement, as
established in this prison. We stated in our last re-
port, that the adoption of the system of separate con-
finement of prisoners was likely to effect a most salutary
change in the treatment of criminals, and that it was


calculated to deter, correct, and reclaim the offender.
The further experience we have gained has strengthened
and confirmed this opinion.?
The separate system has been to some extent adopted by
most of the European nations, and commissioners have
from time to time been appointed by England, France,
and other countries, for the purpose of inquiring into its
practical workings, and they have reported most favour-
ably of its results, not only as a means of reformation, but
also as an efficient instrument of punishment. This mode
of discipline is no experiment ; it has been extensively
tried, with great success ; and it may therefore be safely
adopted as the basis of the reformed penal discipline to
be substituted for transportation. It must however be
taken only as the groundwork and introductory portion,
the subsequent stages will require considerable modifi-
cation and some additional elements. There can, indeed,
be no improvement in that complete seclusion upon his
first entrance into the prison which subdues all riot and
passion in the criminal, induces the spirit of resignation
and tractability, and makes him crave for labour and
instruction as the greatest blessing, instead of regarding
them as an irksome task and punishment. But within
a few days of his admission into the prison, the criminal
should be brought under the operation of the mark-
system, as proposed by Captain Maconochie, the opera-
tion and advantages of which, will afterwards be more
fully explained. With this addition, seclusion upon
the separate system, is, undoubtedly, the best calculated
for the first stages of punishment. The prisoner, during
this period of his confinement, should be instructed and
employed in some useful trade, his bodily health should


be under the constant care of the prison surgeon, his
mental activity secured by the instruction of an efficient
schoolmaster, and ministers of religion, by scripture
reading, by frequent visits to his cell, and by public
service in the prison chapel, should provide for his
moral and religious reformation.
It has before been stated, that one of the most pro-
minent features in Captain Maconochie?s plans, is the
introduction of marks. Great advantages result from
their adoption. With punishment, they combine reward.
If man must be governed by self-interest, the hope of
reward is a higher, or at least, a less injurious motive,
than the fear of punishment. Punishment excites ill
feelings, both in the person who inflicts the punishment,
and in him upon whom it is inflicted. Reward, like
charity, excites in both, the higher and more kindly
feelings. The rewards and punishments of the mark
system have also this further advantage, that they re-
semble the rewards and punishments of actual life. In
actual life, there is not an action, however minute,
which is not either immediately or remotely the cause
of either good or ill. In ordinary penal discipline, it is
scarcely possible, that those minor acts which chiefly
constitute the life of man, can be either rewarded or
punished. But in the mark system, where a single
mark may not have the value of a farthing, rewards and
punishments can be much more accurately apportioned.
The sentence of a criminal will not be for a certain fixed
period, but for a certain amount of labour to be per-
formed. This amount will be estimated at a certain
number of marks to be placed to the debit of the
criminal; and when the number of the marks which by


his industry and good conduct he has earned, shall
amount to the total of his original and accumulated
debits, he will be entitled to his liberty. Every mark,
therefore, that he earns by his industry or good conduct,
hastens his liberation; and by every mark which he
forfeits, it is retarded. The motives to industry and
good conduct are thus, like the every-day duties and
motives of life, not great in their amount, but con-
stant and unceasing in their operation. As has been
already mentioned, all food and clothing, and every
other indulgence supplied to the criminal, must be paid
for by himself out of the marks he has earned by his
industry and merits. Frugality, forethought, and cal-
culation, will thus be brought into action; and the
sacrifice of present interests and gratifications to the
future upon which the powder to resist crime and temp-
tation principally depends, will continually be required.
From these considerations, there can, it is conceived, be
little doubt, that a system of marks, with their necessary
accompaniment of labour, instead of time, sentences,
should be introduced into every reformed plan of prison
discipline. The leading principle seems well established,
and the details of arrangement can easily be modified
and adapted, as circumstances and experience may dic-
tate. In order to provide against the caprice and
favouritism of the prison officers in the distribution and
forfeiture of marks, positive rules should be laid down
for the regulation, as much as practicable, of every case;
that uncertainty and unfairness may be prevented. It
has been frequently objected, that the strong and skilful
labourer, will have an unfair advantage over his less
able, though, perhaps, more virtuous companion. This,


to a certain extent, is inevitable ; it will always exist in
the world, and in some, though perhaps, under proper
arrangement, in a less degree, it must always be found
in the prison; but by proper regulations this evil may
be much diminished. A minimum period of punish-
ment might in each case be easily fixed, in less than
which time the prisoner, whatever were his conduct,
should not be liberated. Captain Maconochie has also
proposed, and in Norfolk Island he adopted, the plan of
classing the prisoners under separated divisions, accord-
ing to their skill and strength, applying to each division
a separate scale of rewards and punishments, according
to its capabilities.
The introduction of marks would infuse into the
separate system an energy and vitality that might, in
some degree, abate the deadening monotony of seclusion.
But still, it could never bring it wholly into accordance
with man s nature, which is created for society, and not
for solitude. It is not by monastic seclusion, and the
removal of temptation, that active virtue, and the power
to resist and overcome the allurements which abound in
the world, can be acquired. Solitary confinement is a
good preparatory discipline, but when prolonged, it is
calculated to enervate, rather than invigorate. Upon
his liberation, the criminal who had hitherto been se-
cluded from every allurement to vice, and surrounded by
every incentive to virtue, is suddenly beset by tempta-
tions, the most powerful and seductive, and quickly be-
comes the victim of his former vices. This is no theory
elaborated by reason, it is, unfortunately, supported by
fact. When the Model Prison of Pentonville was esta-
blished, the public were told that the reformation, the


system there adopted would accomplish, would be com-
plete and lasting, and fit the prisoners for entering upon
their duties as useful citizens. From the criminals
sentenced for transportation, the most promising have
been selected to undergo an initiary punishment in this
prison. After about eighteen months subjection to its
discipline, they are shipped for their ultimate destination
in Yan Diemen?s Land, where the amount of liberty
granted to them depends upon their behaviour during
the term of their previous imprisonment. The debili-
tating effect of separate confinement, both upon the
mind and body, even when administered in a model
prison, under the direct superintendence of men emi-
nently suited for the task, will be painfully seen in the
following extract from the official communication of Mr.
J. S. Hampton, the surgeon-superintendent of the Sir
George Seymour convict-ship. He is stated to be
? the responsible agent of the Pentonville Commis-
sioners,? and a warm advocate of the separate system ;
if, therefore, his evidence is found to be hostile to that
system it is surely entitled to much confidence. He
states, that
u On the mornings of the 28th and 29th October,
1844, 345 convicts were sent on board the ship Sir
George Seymour , direct from Pentonville prison, where
they had been shut up in separate confinement for
periods varying, from fifteen to twenty-two months.
? I experienced some difficulty at first in berthing and
arranging these men, who, apparently from not having
been associated together for some time, were slow in
comprehending orders , and equally slow in obeying ,
although evidently tractable and willing; in fact, they


had lost their gregarious , and did 7iot again
acquire them until after some weeks.
? The sudden change , from great seclusion to the hustle
and noise of a crowded ship produced a number of cases
of convulsions , attended, in some instances, with nausea
and vomiting, in others, simulating , and, in ,
being of a most anomalous character. The recumbent
position, fresh air, mild stimulants, &c., were found
beneficial in all these cases, and after three days, the
convulsions disappeared.?
The reader may, perhaps, have been somewhat pre-
pared for this frightful result, after finding in a previous
page, that a prisoner in the Eastern Penitentiary of
Philadelphia, examined by M. M. de Beamont and de
Tocqueville, shed tears during the whole conversation.
And that those gentlemen state, that another prisoner,
? cannot speak long without being agitated and shed-
ding tearsand that, ? we have made the same remark
of all whom we have seen!' But Mr. Hampton appears
to be too blind a defender of the separate system to per-
ceive the tendency of his own unconscious evidence, and
among other paragraphs which he has written ex-
pressly in its support, the following may be quoted for
its blind advocacy.
?As an opinion prevails very generally that the
separate system in force at Pentonville prison weakens
the mind, and often causes insanity, I feel bound to state
in the most emphatic terms, that it did not produce the
slightest mental imbecility in any of the 345 men under
my charge, and that, in my opinion, their minds were
in a much more healthy state than is usual amongst
ordinary convicts, or even any similar number of men


of the same station in life. The mental effect I
observed has been already noticed, for want of a better
term, as the loss of gregarious habits 1?
That prison discipline, which ought to fit man for
society, for which he was created, and to which he
must return, should thus deprive the criminal for some
weeks of his ? gregarious habits,? is to Mr. Hampton,
evidently, an object of little moment. Convulsions and
hysteria, which clearly were ther esult of a morbid state
of mind , excited by ? the sudden change from great
seclusion to the bustle and noise of a crowded ship,?
appear to be so unimportant as to require no remark.
From a parliamentary document on convict discipline
in Van Diemen?s Land, ordered to be printed by the
House of Commons during the last session, it appears
that the prisoners from Pentonville, have not been
sufficiently fortified against temptation to maintain a
virtuous character. The following is an extract from
one of the letters which this parliamentary document
contains.

These are not solitary instances, many more might
be quoted. Without a little explanation, it may be
difficult to reconcile these statements with the evidence
before quoted, of the favourable effects of separate con-
finement. It is to be borne in mind, that the prisoners
who have been sent to Van Diemen?s Land, have been
thrown into a society, perhaps the most corrupt and
lawless on the face of the earth. The enormous evils
of transportation are there accumulated and concentrated
in an extraordinary degree. To all respectable settlers,
the state of things has become intolerable, and many are
leaving their property and adopted homes, unable to
endure it longer. Convicts have so greatly accumulated
in the island, that it has become difficult to obtain em-
ployment, and plunder is resorted to as a means of sub-
sistence. In great measure, then, the relapse of the
Pentonville prisoners into their former vices, can be
easily accounted for; they must indeed, be something
more than human, to withstand this moral pestilence.
But after making every allowance for these con-
taminating influences, the evidence just quoted, must
be admitted to be a corroboration of the opinion,
that the separate system while it may subdue the
passions, at the same time, deadens the active vir-
tues ; that it weakens the mind instead of fortifying
it, that it renders it passive, and more than ever the
creature of circumstances; in short, that it fits it for
solitude, and not for society. The man who falls into
convulsions from u the bustle and noise of a crowded
ship,? is not a man of that moral fortitude who
will stand immovable amid the trials and temptations


of life. And if men be thus enervated by eighteen
months? imprisonment, what will be the effect of years ?
The separate system is indeed, in many respects, a great
improvement upon that barbarous and ill-regulated prison
discipline which is founded upon no principle, and has
no enlightened object. But the discipline which is evi-
dently the most perfect, is that which not only checks
the passions, but, at the same time, calls forth the
social virtues, and strengthens moral resolution and
courage. Penal discipline must be adapted to man in a
social state, and to the particular forms and failings of
actual society. If in the world there are difficulties to
be overcome, there should, likewise, be difficulties to be
surmounted in the prison?if in the world there are
temptations to be resisted, trials and misfortunes pa-
tiently to be endured?if forethought and calculation, and
the sacrifice of the present to the future, be necessary to
success?if combination and co-operation be constantly
required, if sympathy with the afflicted and efforts for
the removal of their distress be a virtue, and a protec-
tion against the callousness of vice?if, in fine, crime be
the result of selfishness, and virtue can have no surer
support than the feelings of sympathy and benevolence,
then let all these social elements be combined in prison
discipline, or else, although you may have constructed
men according to your own standard of fancied excel-
lence, you will not have formed characters suited to
societv and to the world.
The evil of prolonged and unbroken separate confine-
ment is evident, but the remedy, it is difficult to devise,
ft may be laid down, perhaps, as an established prin-
ciple, that punishment, like education and the forms of


government, should be progressive. All institutions
should be capable of adapting themselves to the pro-
gress of man, and should grant that amount of liberty
which in each stage may safely be enjoyed. Prisons
should be so arranged as to enable the criminal, as he
advances towards reformation, gradually to throw off his
state of isolation, and socially to combine with his fellow-
prisoners. In penal discipline, no point is better
established, than that the association of abandoned
criminals invariably makes them worse. Combination
can therefore only be attempted, when reformation,
although not yet completed, has, at least, been decidedly
commenced. In a certain stage of reformation, when a
sincere desire for improvement has been implanted,
criminals are likely to strengthen each other in good
purposes, and mutually to administer to reformation.
By throwing them into the society of their fellows, the
social sympathies and virtues are stimulated, and that
unfeeling selfishness counteracted, which is the chief
source of crime. No doubt, such an intercourse must
always be accompanied with danger, and individual
failure; but the question is, whether on the whole it
will not prove beneficial. If the criminal were not to
be subjected to fearful temptations upon his liberation,
the question would assume an entirely different aspect.
Since then to keep him always out of temptation, is
impossible, the problem is, how he may best be prepared
for temptation. And the only practical solution is, the
same as in the case of education; having fortified the
mind by previous discipline, and the inculcation of sound
principles, let evil and temptation be gradually and
guardedly admitted. The correct principle, therefore,


is, that punishment shall he gradually mitigated; that in
its first stages it shall he severe; and that gradually one
restraint after another shall he thrown aside, until the
prison doors shall at length be opened, and the prisoner
set free.
The precise manner in which this progressive liberty
shall he conferred is a question of great difficulty, and can
be finally settled only by experience ; in the meantime,
however, free discussion and some general suggestions
may he of service. Captain Maconochie?s plan of meet-
ing the difficulty has all the advantages of association
and co-operation, but it is beset with many dangers.
It will be recollected, that he proposes that six or eight
criminals should be formed into a co-operative class, the
marks gained or lost by each individual being placed to
the credit or debit of the whole. The exact mode in
which this plan is intended to be carried out, is not very
evident, as Captain Maconochie upon this, as well as on
other points, expresses somewhat different opinions at
different times. In a report, dated January, 1843,
upon the state of the prisoners in Norfolk Island, where,
even according to his own account, this portion of his
plan had not fully succeeded, he states, that he prefers
that each set of criminals before being combined in co-
operative classes, should undergo three or four months
close imprisonment together. Th at they should, in fact, be
associated in prison before they are combined into co-
operative classes. And from the despatch of Sir George
Gipps, before quoted, it further appears, that Captain
Maconochie accounted for the failure of this portion of
his plan in Norfolk Island, from the prisoners not having
previously suffered together, and thus become acquainted


with each other in adversity. It however subsequently
appears to be Captain Maconochie?s intention, that the
prisoners should pass through a term of probation in se-
parate confinement, before they are advanced to the social
state of co-operative classes. It is, also, stated, that the
prisoners ought ,to combine voluntarily, that they should
choose their own companions from a knowledge of their
individual dispositions and character. Now, there does
appear to be a little incompatibility and confusion in these
different statements. In one place, it is said, that asso-
ciated imprisonment is preferred in another, that separate
confinement is to constitute the preliminary portion of
the discipline. It is considered important, that the pri-
soners should be able, voluntarily, to select for them-
selves their companions ; but it is not easy to see, how
it is possible for them to possess the requisite know-
ledge for selecting their associates, before they have been
thrown into the society of their associates. Are the
prisoners then to be thrown together, and remain for a
certain period indiscriminately associated, in order that,
out of the mass, each may select his own companions ?
It must, also, be confessed, that he appears to be
carrying a favourite theory rather far, ?a defect, how-
ever, not unfrequently to be found in the works and
despatches of Captain Maconochie, ?when he accounts
for the failure of his co-operative classes, from the pri-
soners not having previously suffered together, and thus
become acquainted with each other in adversity.
But, throwing aside these minor objections, let us ex-
amine the primary idea of combining the prisoners into co-
operative classes. Much advantage has been derived, and
it is probable, much more will yet be derived from the


principle of co-operation. For the poor, it appears to be
peculiarly well adapted. By mutual contribution, capital
can be raised, and co-operative institutions established.
When all are working for a common prize, which
will be equally divided, the energies of all will be
exerted for the common good. Selfishness and anta-
gonism, will be merged in benevolence and mutual
assistance. Each member of the association, will at the
same time, by the same act, be promoting both his own
interest and the interest of his companions. The sti-
mulus to industry and beneficence, which such a combi-
nation will create, would be diffused through all the
members. The temptations to idleness and other fatal
evils, might appear to be great, but the incentive to in-
dustry and virtue, would be greater. Idleness would
become a disgrace, and even a dishonesty, and those
vices, at least, which are destructive to the common
interest, would by a strongly combined public opinion
be put down. It is evident, that if anything approach-
ing to these alleged industrial and moral advantages,
could be reasonably expected to result from the applica-
tion of the co-operative principle to our criminal popu-
lation, there could be no doubt, that it ought speedily
to be added to our instruments of reformation. There
is, however, an objection to all these co-operative asso-
ciations, which peculiarly applies where the individuals
to be combined are criminals. They assume man to be
more perfect than he really is. And the practical
answer to these glowing theories w T ould probably be :
your theory is abstractedly good, but with the imper-
fect instruments at your command, it is impracticable.
That it is, or, at least, that it always will be, in an


ordinarily intelligent and virtuous community, imprac-
ticable, is exceedingly doubtful. But the objection, if
under any circumstances fatal, is certainly fatal to the
co-operation of criminals?the worst possible instru-
ments for carrying the plan into execution. You may
combine good,?there is a unity in it, but evil in its
very nature is discord. Criminals might, indeed, desire
to combine for the attainment of a common benefit;
but in what spirit would they bear a common loss ?
Thus the theory and reasoning upon this subject
stands : of experience, there is almost none upon which
reliance can be placed, so contradictory is the evidence
upon the point. Captain Maconochie, indeed, in a re-
cent work,* states several cases in which the plan has
been employed with great success. The first instance
he gives is the following :
? Sir George Gipps, in 1839, tried it with his road
parties, near Sydney, with complete
In the despatch of Sir George Gipps to Lord Stanley,
before referred to, dated Government House, Sydney,
Ist April, 1843, are found the following paragraphs:?
u In respect to the principle of mutual responsibility,
which is, in fact, the foundation of the social system, I
?*
will only say, that I have found it answer very well, as
far as the distribution of rewards or earnings is con-
cerned, but not in the infliction of fines or punishments ;
there is something in punishing one man or woman (for
my experience has been gained in part at the female
factory at Parramatta) for the fault of another, at which
the sense of common justice revolts.
* Crime and Punishment. The Mark System, &c., by
Captain Maconochie, p. 53.


44 Captain Maconochie is of opinion, that the prin-
ciple of mutual responsibility was less objected to by
the 4 old? than the 4 new hands;? but all the officers of
the old establishment, whom I questioned, concurred in
saying, that though they would work 4 like tigers? for
marks, if marks could procure their freedom, they did
not, more than the 4 new hands,? like that part of
Captain Maconochie?s system which would punish one
man for the faults committed by another.?
Captain Maconochie asserts, that Sir George Gipps
has tried the plan 44 with complete success,? Sir George
himself says, that he has not met with success. And
here the matter must rest, for to adduce further evidence
would be useless, as no person could, for a moment, rely
upon it.
The practicability and advantage of this plan of co-
operative classes, must remain for the present, proble-
matical ; but that it is desirable to cultivate the social
feelings of the criminal, is not problematical. If one
means be abandoned, another must be adopted. If it
be found impracticable, for the prisoners to associate in
these co-operative classes, let them associate without
them. Not, indeed, in an indiscriminate manner ; but
under a careful and minute classification, those only
associating together, whose mutual influence is likely
to be good. For this purpose, the prisoners should be
divided into distinct classes. But even during this stage
of punishment, solitude should not be entirely excluded,
it must be duly blended with society; solitude for
reflection, society for action. The proportions and
manner in which each could be combined with the
other, are indefinite, and might easily be varied to suit


each individual case, or, at least, each separate classi-
fication. It seems desirable, that the criminals should
always be actively occupied while in each others so-
ciety. Captain Maconochie, it would appear, does not
see the desirableness of this arrangement. But it seems
evident, that if there be any danger of contamination,
during idleness, it will be the greatest. The prisoners
might easily be employed upon some work, requiring, or,
at least, permitting co-operation. It is highly desirable,
that every prison intended for prolonged terms of punish-
ment, should have a sufficiently large tract of ground at-
tached to it, to allow of the employment of the prisoners
in gardening, spade-husbandry, or other out-door occu-
pations. Each division into which the prisoners are classi-
fied, should, in succession, be thus employed in the open
air for a few hours in the day, mingling with each other,
at choice, during their labour. At Pentonville and other
prisons upon the separate arrangement, there are compart-
ments for the solitary exercise of the prisoners. Their
exercise, to and fro in these compartments, is apparently
taken more from duty and necessity than from pleasure.
To the visitor, it is painful to see these poor attempts at
recreation in prison and in solitude; to see even the
pleasure of recreation thus rendered joyless and desolate.
When the criminals have advanced to the stage in which
they are allowed to associate with each other, let them,
above all, be permitted to take exercise in society. Aot
to stand idling together, but to join in some recreation
or game, where there may be an invigorating contest
and rivalry, exciting the mind and body to healthy
action. The mind is never more free, healthful and
spontaneous, then when engaged in an invigorating
i

game. It cannot feel that it is imprisoned then ; it ex-
pands and throbs with the freedom of youth. By these
arrangements, or others of a like description, the evils
incident to prolonged and unbroken separate confine-
ment would be avoided, without the necessity of re-
sorting to the co-operative classes, the advantages and
safety of which are at least open to much doubt.
In making these suggestions, there is no intention to
dogmatize. No mode of prison discipline that has yet
been adopted, can be said, to have succeeded it there-
fore, seems desirable, that some new plan should be pro-
posed and discussed. In the very nature of things, no
plan which may be brought forward, can be expected
to be complete in every part, or obtain the approval of
all; and it is not anticipated, that the alterations here
proposed, will be final and decisive. If the preceding
remarks should be the means of sweeping away any past
errors, or of facilitating future progress, all that can be
expected will have been accomplished.
A few further points still remain for discussion. The
treatment of juvenile offenders, is a question which has
claimed much attention, but little has yet been accom-
plished. It is w r ell known, that a youth sent to our
ordinary jails, is not reformed; but hardened and cor-
rupted : he is re-committed, time after time, till he
reaches that stage of criminality which entitles him to
be transported. The public are, at length, becoming
alive to this egregious and expensive folly. A large
majority of our juvenile offenders, are the victims
of neglect. It is imperative, that society should fulfil
its duty to its people; and, above all, to its chil-
dren, for then the people will take care of themselves.

These poor misguided youths, who have fallen into
crime, deserve perhaps some punishment, hut they
still more require instruction. The prisons for them,
should be very different from the prisons for adults.
The discipline should be less stern ; kindness should
more abound than severity, for the prison and the
school of industry, should, in fact, be combined.
Parkhurst Prison, in the Isle of Wight, for juvenile
offenders, is established upon these principles. The
prisoners are instructed in their moral and religious
duties, a school is annexed to the establishment, and a
portion of the day is devoted to some industrial occupa-
tion. There are classes of tailors, shoemakers, car-
penters, painters and blacksmiths, besides other useful
trades; the profits of which, help to defray the ex-
penses of the establishment. During the year 1844, the
number of prisoners varied from about 400 to above
500, and the average cost of each, was �25. 6.9. \\d..
This certainly is a large amount; at Norwood school
of industry, in Surrey, the average annual expense
of each child, is only �ll. 145., and the arrangements
appear to be excellent and sufficient. The expense
is large, no doubt, but the object to be accomplished
is important. If the young criminal, upon his first
transgression, be submitted to an efficient discipline,
there is great hope of his becoming effectually reformed.
The difficulty of correcting the adult criminal, is always
great, and often insuperable; but the docility of youth,
with the criminal habits, as yet, but partially engrafted
in the character, renders improvement comparatively
easy. The duty and necessity of reforming the juvenile
offender, is only less urgent and important, than the


duty and necessity of general education. But if this
question of morals and religion, is to be brought to a
monied standard, it can, incontestably be shown that,
however great be the expense of establishments fitted
for the reformation of juvenile offenders, it is much less
than the cost of repeated crime, followed by repeated
conviction. To reform, is much cheaper than to pro-
secute. And if the object of punishment, be the pre-
vention of crime, it cannot be more effectually accom-
plished than by the formation of such establishments.
The periods for which criminals are now sentenced
to punishment, require a total revision. Their length
should be determined bv the time, which, in a given
case, will, probably, be required to accomplish reforma-
tion. It is manifest folly to liberate a man, who will,
upon the first opportunity, abuse his liberty. Treat
him as a man morally and mentally diseased, and sub-
ject him to restraint and care, till health be restored.
It is probable, that under an enlightened form of penal
discipline, the long terms of punishment might, with
safety, be considerably diminished; and it is certain,
that the short ones must be much lengthened. When a
criminal is reformed, he has a right to his liberty, at
least, if he have paid to society the debt of punishment
which example demands. This is, comparatively, soon
paid, you may concentrate much punishment in a little
space, but reformation is a work of time and difficulty.
Hence it is, that the present short periods of punish-
ment should be abolished. They may be sufficient for
the purposes of pain, and, therefore, of example, but
they can never be sufficient for reformation.
A well arranged system of marks, is well adapted for


the regulation of the terms of punishment. The num-
ber which the criminal should be required to earn, be-
fore he becomes entitled to his liberty, should be ori-
ginally determined, by the length of time which his
crime indicates as being necessary for reformation.
But it is evident, that the same crime may be com-
mitted by persons of very different degrees of depravity,
and, therefore, requiring punishments of very different
duration. The mark-system will, in some measure,
correct this discrepancy. The number of marks earned
by the criminal, will depend upon industry and good
conduct, the number forfeited, upon bad conduct. The
duration of imprisonment, therefore, will depend upon
the enormity of the original crime, combined with the
criminality of individual character. The plan, if judi-
ciously worked, would secure more surely, than per-
haps, any other scheme, the reformation of the criminal
before his liberation.
It has been proposed by Captain Maconochie, that a
criminal upon his release, shall be entitled to a certain
number of marks, to be regulated by his previous con-
duct. The advantages of such a plan are very great.
It is well known, that criminals are frequently, upon
their liberation, in a state of complete destitution ;
having lost their character, they are unable to obtain
employment, and are, by absolute want, compelled to
return to crime. The small amount of money, to
which their marks will be convertible, would pro-
tect them from this fate, by supporting them until em-
ployment could be obtained. Much of late has been
said, in favour of asylums for liberated criminals, and as
a temporary expedient, it is, perhaps well, that they


should be established : but as a temporary expedient
only. If penal discipline were reformed, and every
criminal instructed in some useful occupation, a small
sum of money upon his liberation, would be the
utmost he could require. It is probable, that he would
be better instructed, better regulated, and better capable
of obtaining a livelihood, than many of the people who
had never been imprisoned. Indeed, if our penal dis-
cipline be reformed, before an efficient education be esta-
blished, an asylum for the innocent and ignorant will be
more needed than for the liberated criminal.
In order to carry out the plan of penitentiaries, here
advocated as a substitute for transportation, many fresh
prisons must be erected and extensive additions made to
those already in existence. The first cost of this would,
no doubt, be very considerable, but it is necessary.
Transportation must sooner or later be abolished, it is
only a question of time : and if abolished, prisons must
be built at home for the reception of our criminals.
The expense must be incurred at some time; and if the
re m edy be long delayed, the nation may at length be
taught, that there are considerations higher and of
greater moment than those of expense. But after the
first outlay, it is likely that the cost of our penal esta-
blishments would be even less than under the present
system. The discipline being rendered more efficient,
it is probable, that its average duration might be some-
what diminished. A reformed system of punishment
would, also, diminish the amount of crime, and thus
lessen the number of criminals to be punished. In
America, some of the penitentiaries are actually a source
of profit: and, although in this country, were it desir-


able, a revenue can scarcely be anticipated from such
a source, yet there can be no doubt, that by good
management their expense might be almost indefinitely
diminished.
To state the comparative advantages of transportation
and penitentiaries, would be to re-state all which it has
been the object of these pages to prove. Suffice it to
say, that transportation, while it signally fails in obtain-
ing every object of punishment, blights with all the
curses of iniquity, our young and rising colonies. It
does not deter from crime at home, and it propagates
it abroad. Next to the sin of slavery, no greater
national disgrace exists than that of thus, with a
lavish hand, sowing in a virgin soil the seeds of end-
less depravity. Whatever plan of penal discipline be
adopted, at least, this national iniquity must be
abandoned. Penitentiaries on the other hand, are no
blot upon the national character; when established to
accomplish benevolent designs, they evince a noble
struggle with iniquity. They attain the object of all
punishment, the protection of society, and the reclaim-
ing of the offender: and they attain this noble object
in a noble manner, compatible with the duties which
man owes to man, and with his responsibility to his
God.
It is well known, that it is the intention of Government
to deal with this question; but there is some reason to fear,
that it will be dealt with but imperfectly. It is not in-
tended to enter here into an examination of the measures
which will shortly be proposed. They will soon become
the subject of public discussion in Parliament, and in
the country, and it would be premature to enter into a


minute consideration of plans, the details and ultimate
objects of which are probably as yet but imperfectly
known. But without any minute examination, the pre-
ceding pages will be sufficient to indicate the character
of the measures required to meet and remove the evils
which now exist, and which are every year fast in-
creasing. Our penal regulations, have hitherto been
attended with repeated and continued failure; abroad,
our colonies have been corrupted, at home, our criminals
remain unreformed. So enormous an evil, requires to
be met by radical and extensive measures. No rash or
precipitate legislation will here be urged; but whilst
the plans adopted, should be the result of minute in-
vestigation and mature deliberation, they must boldly
meet the evil and remove it. The immediate abolition
of transportation may probably be impracticable; but,
although its total and immediate abolition be impracti-
cable, the country has a right to expect provision to be
made for its speedy and ultimate termination. To deal
with so radical an evil by a mere change in details,
however important in themselves, would be imbecile
trifling, and mischievous procrastination. It is useless
to attempt, permanently to improve a system radically
bad; it must be totally abolished.
\Jur penal discipline, in all its relations, requires to
be thoroughly examined, and remodeled into a complete
and perfect wdiole. There remains a great work for
our present government to accomplish. Searchingly to
enter into the subject of crime and its prevention, will
lead to the consideration of every social question. Crime
is, in great measure, the result of a diseased social sys-
tem ; and whatever increases the disease increases crime.

Will Government construct an elaborate and expensive
machinery for the punishment of crime and the reforma-
tion of the criminal, and neglect to check those social
evils of which crime is but the natural and necessary
manifestation. Is the criminal to be educated, and the
honest man to remain ignorant ? Are jails to be con-
structed for the reformation of those whom the unremoved
evils of our social system have demoralized ? We have
had many great reforms, but a social reform will be the
greatest, and it will, undoubtedly, be the most difficult
to be accomplished. Upon this great reform, it is to be
hoped, we are now entering. The days of foreign con-
quest are ended, no constitutional change is at present
impending, sound principles in commerce are already
established, and social progress appears to be now the
great mission of the Government. The questions of edu -
cation, penal discipline, the hours of labour, and the
general condition of the poor, must now occupy that
attention which they merit: and it is to be hoped, that
Government will know how to become the parent, with-
out being the tyrant of its people.
