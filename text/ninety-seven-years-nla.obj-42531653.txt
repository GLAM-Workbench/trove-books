As the past is prologue to the present
so the future is determined by this happy heritage.


On March 81st, 1889, the barque Royal Saxon
dropped anchor in Sydney Cove. Her commander,
Captain Towns, congratulated himself on a smooth,
unadventurous voyage, 131 days out from “Home,”
and mused over the prospects of as happy a trip
back. Two of his passengers, however, a young
married couple, were less complacent about their
prospects as they gazed on the fledgling colony that
was to be the scene of their new life together.
Nor was there anything reassuring about the in-
timate personal examination conducted by Her
Majesty’s Officer of Customs after they had landed.
“Name?” he inquired of the young man. “Joseph
Farmer.” “Calling?” “Farmer and agriculturist.”
“Age?” “Twenty-five years.” “Health?” “Very
good.” “Religion?” “Protestant.” “Character?”
“Very good, attested by Richard B. Downes of
Birmingham.” And the young wife told how her
name was Caroline Farmer, that she was a native
of Shropshire, aged twenty-four years, protestant,
of good health and character, and (under the
heading of Remarks) “able to read and write!”
It was over a year later that your own great-
grandmother might have read in the columns of
her “Sydney Morning Herald” the following modest
intimation:
“ ‘Victoria House,’ opposite Victoria Theatre,
Pitt Street. Joseph Farmer begs to acquaint the
public that he has engaged the above premises,
which he will open on Monday, 21st instant, with a
well selected and fashionable stock of drapery
goods. From the principle on which his business
will be conducted, Joseph Farmer entertains no
doubt of obtaining a small portion of public
patronage, to ensure which, every attention possible
to his customers will be shown.”
September 10th, 1840.
Ninety Seven Years
On a frontage of about the same length as the
present large reflection I ess window in Pitt Street,
Joseph Farmer opened the little shop that you see
pictured so elegantly on the bill-head opposite. He
proved more than right about the “public patron-
age,” for within three years he was able to advertise:
“Notice of Removal: The undersigned being
about to remove his present residence to those more
commodious premises recently erected next to
Charles Appleton & Co.’s (where he hopes to con-
duct his business on the ready money system) takes
the present opportunity of requesting those parties
indebted to him to pay their accounts without delay.
“Joseph Farmer, ‘Victoria House’
“Pitt Street, Sydney, January 28th, 1843.”
These “commodious premises” were, in effect,
just next door to his first business and were the
actual centre from which radiated the extensions
that were to follow during the century.
Let us glance for a moment at a “docket” of those
days and see what a certain Mr. McDonald bought
at “Victoria House” on 18lh October, 1845.

It was typical of the period, that in 1845,
leading Sydney Drapers promoted race meetings
at Homebush, the whole of the profits from which
were handed to Sydney charities. In that year
Joseph Farmer, at one race meeting, rode his own
horses, “Bother ’Em” and “Escape”, to win the
Double, the Ladies’ Purse and the Beaten Stakes.
Joseph and Caroline Farmer carried on their
business until 1849, when they had prospered so
well, they brought their nephew William (later
Sir William) Farmer from England to look after
their interests in the store, which they leased tem-
porarily to Messrs. Price, Favenc and Gwyn. Gold
had just been discovered in New South Wales; the
Roaring Days were on their way.
Business boomed and in 1854 Mr. William
Farmer took control with Messrs. Williams and


Giles as partners. In this year “Victoria House” intro-
duced what was then a novelty to Sydney—the first
plate-glass windows.
The store had a frontage on Pitt Street as wide as
about three of the present windows and was employing
seventeen persons, when, on the Ist May, 1856, there
joined the staff one, Mr. John Pope, who early began
to display those gifts which were soon to bring him
into the partnership.
In 1859 Mr. Pope was sent “Home” as London repre-
sentative, and a year later, a display of £BO,OOO worth of
merchandise, chiefly of his buying, was a gala feature
of the opening of a new Farmer’s building, with no less
than ninety-eight feet on Pitt Street.
A block in George Street had lately been acquired and
for the first time crinolines were swaying through the
one store from Pitt to George Streets.
Here is a sidelight on the period: In 1866, prompted
and encouraged by Farmer, Williams and Giles, citizens
formed “The Saturday Half Holiday Association” and
a number of prominent Sydney women subscribed to the
following:
“The Saturday Half Holiday Association.” In com-
pliance with a resolution adopted at a Public Meeting
held at the “Prince of Wales Theatre ” November 26th,
1866. His Honour Sir Alfred Stephen, Knt. C. 8., in the
Chair, the following ladies hereby agree to abstain from
shopping after 1 o’clock p.m. on Saturday and use their
influence to promote the Saturday half-holiday, through
the co-operation of ladies generally. They, moreover,
hereby agree to make such arrangements in their house-
holds as will enable their domestics to complete their
purchases before one o’clock on Saturdays.
It is interesting to note by the way, that, although
actually many years later, Farmer’s was the first business
in Australia to close at 1 p.m. on Saturdays.
From 1860 extensions to the store followed rapidly.
The famous Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, Esq., laid the founda-
tion stone in 1873 of what was to be opened in 1874 as
the new “Victoria House.” A beautifully designed build-
ing it was, which many still living can remember;
composed of red brick with an imposing frontage to Pitt
Street. The windows were back from the footpath proper
and set beneath a colonnade of arches supported by
polished granite pillars. A white marble bust of Queen
Victoria, then in the 37th year of her reign, appeared
over the principal entrance and is still to be seen in an
alcove of the present-day roof-garden.
n


In 1874 Sir William Farmer retired to England to live, revisit-
ing this country in 1894 and finally in 1907. A little later
Joseph Farmer also returned “home,” never to return to the scene
of his early successes.
Farmer’s famous Pitt-Market Streets corner was acquired in
1881 and a six-storey building erected, which, with the addition
of a new front completed in 1913, stands there to-day.
For 57 years many names had been joined with that of Farmer
as partners, but, on sth February. 1897, all partnerships came to
an end with the flotation of a limited liability company under
the name of Farmer & Company, Limited. The first directors
were Sir William Farmer (chairman), Mr. John Pope (managing
director). Mr. E. S. Perry and Mr. S. Taylor. Shortly after
flotation Messrs. J. Vallentine, Parke W. Pope and John Charles
were appointed to the Board.
In 1910 the present six-storey building in Pitt Street was


erected in place of the old colonnaded “Victoria House.” Further
acquisitions of land followed in 1913, 1916 and 1920 until to-day
the Company owns a freehold of the entire block the store stands
on a total area of one and a quarter acres.
Five days before Christmas, 1918, a disastrous fire gutted the
buildings which occupied what is now' Farmer’s Market-George
streets corner. The Company already owned the land and subse-
quently planned a new building to occupy the valuable site. This
building, which also houses the famous Blaxland Galleries, was
opened to the public in 1928.
The “Blaxland Galleries” commemorate in their name one
of the greatest pioneering families that ever contributed to the
growth of the colony. They are situated on the eight and ninth
floors of the George-street building. Now, this land was once the
site of the homestead of the brothers Blaxland: Gregory, leader
of the expedition (Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson) which


discovered the first practical pass over the Blue Mountains; and John, who played
the same part in pioneering the cattle industry in this country as Macarlhur did
the sheep. While excavating on the site of Farmer's George-slrcel building, an
old oven was unearthed. The type of brick it was made of. suggests it belonged
to the Hlaxlands’ first home which stood here as early as 1807.
This Australian “antiquity" was left intact, and to-day lies beneath the footpath
near the main George Street entrance. \ ou’ve passed over it many a time.
Step by step, Farmer’s history has been Sydney's history. Kvery step forward
planned and achieved by the store, has indicated the progress made by the city,
until we find 10-day, in 1987. Farmer's is one of the most modern and progressive
stores in a modern and progressive city. Young, both of them. And ambitious.
In recent years the name of Farmer & Company. Limited, has been associated
as pioneer with many activities and trading improvements.
Broadcasting: In 1928 farmer’s obtained the first commercial broadcasting
license to he issued in the Commonwealth. Many ol those who listen 10-day to
the .National Station 2FC. will recall that F.C. once represented the two initials
of Farmer & Company. They will also remember with pleasure the high standard
of radio entertainment maintained by the original 2FC. when broadcasting had
scarcely emerged from swaddling clothes and Farmer’s "Hello Man’" was the
first of the Airs personalities.
Escalators were another important step forward in store improvement. This
means of speedy transport from floor to door was first introduced by farmer’s in
the new George Street building in 1927,
Not even the novelty of Befi.kctiom.ess Windows lias been neglected. Farmer’s
has kept in step with the most advanced stores abroad with three of these optical
miracles that have not even yet ceased to intrigue Sydney.
FARMER'S PRESENT CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS, MR. H. NORMAN POPE


In 19156, Farmer’s
offered Sydney shoppers
the greatest boon of all,
“Wealher-made-to-order.”
The Carrier Aiu-conditiomxg
System, installed last year,
makes the store an oasis
of ease and comfort during
the Summer months, a
pleasant resort from cold
and dreariness in the
winter. At present the
only store in Australia
to he thus
equipped, Farmer’s
is, in just another
instance, pointing the
way to a service that must
become universal —for it ensures
complete physical comfort in all weathers.
Every day, visitors from other stales and overseas arc impressed
by the comparatively recent innovation of modern, individual salons
within the store. One after another in the last years, these beauti-
fully conceived sellings have given new character to the building.
The Model Room, perfect background for perfect fashions, the
striking. Neon-illumined showrooms, the quiet retreat of the Coral
Salon, where beautifying is an art, the indirectly-lit ground floor
in Pitt Street, and latest —the colourful Peasant Milk Bar
in Market Street, spring to mind as examples of this wholly
modern trend in store presentation.
Farmer’s strides ahead with Sydney. Side-by-side they suffered
their adolescent growing-pains. They grew-up together. And now.
Farmer's, approaching its centenary, looks back over almost a
century of service, dedicating its future to progress and the
maintenance of faith with the people of Sydney.
