EDWARD WILLIAM COLE.




Biographical
Edward William Cole, educationalist
and humanitarian philosopher, was
born on 4th January, 1832, in the
Kentish village of Woodchurch, and is
now eighty-four years of age. At
the age of 18 his active disposition
asserted itself. He migrated to South
Africa, and went in for sheep farming
700 miles inland from Capetown. He
was doing sentry duty for the Govern-
ment during the Kaffir war, and
learned how to rough it. Within a
couple of years he tired of the country,
and, after having removed to Port
Elizabeth, he made up his mind to
book a passage for Australia. He
arrived here on 12th November, 1852,
in the Sebim, a small 114 ton sailing
ship.-


He went to the Forest Creek gold
diggings. He was lucky, and bought
town lots at Castlemaine. He became
a carpenter, and built several shops and
dwellings. Ultimately he made to-
wards the Murray, where he built a
boat, and evolved into an itinerant
photographer. His views of scenery
were reproduced in the illustrated
newspapers of Melbourne. He subse-
quently turned botanist, and collected
150 varieties of Australian plants and
seeds, which he handed over to the late
Baron Von Mueller.
Returning to Melbourne, his
thoughts turned to books, and he spent
all his spare time at the Public Lib-
rary, reading up Oriental and univer-
sal literature. He proved an apt stu-
dent, and within two years had
acquired vast stores of knowledge con-
cerning the religions of the world. He
published several books, his object

being - chiefly to discover the truth
and communicate it to others. One
of his principal works is entitled
“ Religious Sects and Secret Scrip-
tures,” which was followed by several
others on cognate subjects. His
close application to study, combined
with laborious physical work, com-
menced to tell upon his health, and it
was at this juncture he resolved to
become a secondhand bookseller. He
rented a little shop in Paddy’s (the
Eastern) Market. He had £3O or £4O
saved in the bank, and this he judi-
ciously expended in the purchase of
stock. He had had no previous expe-
rience as a bookseller, but his know-
ledge and love of books stood him in
good stead. He started on the up-
grade in that prosperity which has con-
tinued ever since. Pie established his
first book arcade in Bourke-street, be-
tween the market and Russell-street,

4-2 years ago, and the train of thought
which suggested the rainbow as a
trade sign was actuated by his delving
into Orientalism. The bow was set in
the heavens by God after the Deluge
as a promise to mankind; and, as that
promise contained every known colour,
it was adopted as the most conspicuous
and attractive sign which could be de-
vised. Thirty-two years ago last
November he built the front portion
of the ‘existing three-story premises,
which have since been extended right
through to Collins Street, and have,
with the proprietor, become world-
famous as a great Australian institu-
tion.
As a humanitarian he evinced a deep
interest in the home life and the chil-
dren of the nation. He published a
“ Funny Picture Book,” of which
400,000 copies have been sold; another
popular production was the “ Fun

Doctor,” reaching' 160,000 copies;
whilst 200,000 books full of “ pleasant
learning,” for the little ones and
childish recreation were distributed.
These and other publications have
caused the name of Cole and his Rain-
bow to be lisped in almost every cot
and nursery in Australasia.
One of his most cherished ideals is
the Federation of the World. In this
he evinces his philosophy. He enun-
ciates the great principle of fraternity,
and exemplifies the teaching which
bids us do unto others as we would
they should do unto ns. He maintains
there is practically no other way of
establishing a Standard of Right. He
issued 500,000 moral and humanitarian
medals, and about 25 years ago offered
prizes for essays on the subject, which
he published at a pecuniary loss to
himself of nearly £lOOO.

BIOGRAPHICAL.


The White Australia policy he holds
impracticable, and therefore impos-
sible of realisation. He maintains that
colour is only a question of climate.
The black, brown and white peoples of
the earth are merely the result of tor-
rid, temperate, or frigid zones. He has
printed thousands of admirable maps,
and has written pamphlets to show
that owing to her geographical posi-
tion it is but a matter of time ere Aus-
tralia will be compelled to bend to the
inevitable.
It is fully 45 years ago since he dis-
coursed on the great possibilities of
aerial navigation, and it is something
like 33 years since he offered prizes
for the construction of an airship. He
also held ideas concerning the reli-
gions of mankind and the analogy of
varying religious thought, which were
scouted as unorthodox when first pro-
mulgated, but which are now seriously

entertained and endorsed by leading-
divines in both hemispheres.
Quite recently he published a book,
which is now in its sixth edition, con-
stituting a terrible indictment of the
deadly drink traffic, which he has dis-
tributed broadcast to help to extin-
guish the great curse of humanity.
In E. W, Cole we have an ad-
mirable example of what can be accom-
plished by a human being when he
chooses to make and avail himself of
life’s opportunities, and to utilise the
powers with which he has been gifted.

Thinking.
A great idea, which produces noble
resolutions, although it may be given
in simple or ungrammatical language,
is of more value than a dozen volumes
of exquisite obscurities.
<♦> <s> <s>
The masses are becoming more or
less intelligent thinkers. Therefore
crime is diminishing, and slavery is
almost abolished.
<B> <?> <S>
The printing press, as the multiplier
and recorder of thought, is a blessed
boon to modern times.


The highest and most powerful
quality in existence is thought.
<s> <♦> <s>
No man has ever become great with-
out much thinking.
<s><s><s>
There is too much frivolity and
waste of energy, and too little of the
thought, converse, and action with re-
gard to the higher duties of life.
<s> <s> <s>
In matters of thought every man is
an independent sovereign in his own
right- „ ,
<£.<s> <s>
A person may be deaf: that is a cala-
mity ; he may be blind or dumb: they
are greater calamities still; but should
he lose his reason, that is the worst
calamity of all. Therefore the faculty
of thinking is the most precious of all.

THINKING.


An overwhelming' power of thought
is destined to entirely transform the
surface of the material world,
<«> <s> <♦>
Thinking- in the future, and the con-
tinual interchange of thought, will gra-
dually bring about the unity, peace,
and happiness of all mankind, and for
these reasons it is our duty to think.
<s><s><»
We often hear of a valuable inven-
tion or discovery, which is so simple
that we wonder we did not think of it,
and thousands of others also wonder
didn’t think of it

Through want of thought the bulk
of people have little knowledge of the
great human family to which they be-
long; little knowledge of the history

of the world; and little knowledge of,
and little thought of, the destiny to
which they themselves tend.
<s> <s> <s>
We do not know what thought is;
we know little of the laws that govern
it; but we know that it is the greatest
and most powerful thing or quality be-
longing to man ; we know that it places
man at the very head of the creation,
and endows him with the government
of the world, and we feel that in its
greatest and highest manifestation it
must be—it is—the omnipotent power
that governs the universe.

Federation.
Federation means mutual agreement
for the common good, when we shall
enjoy one general government, com-
posed of the; ablest men of the world.
<s> <s> <s>
Men would stare with astonishment
if suddenly they could be shown where
the race would be in the path of pro-
gress one hundred years hence.
❖ <s> <s>
The world should be formed into
one supreme Federal Government,
with its different countries as so many
Federal Sovereign States.


I am firmly convinced that the most
iimportant matters that can engage the
attention of mankind are education,
federation, and the immortality of the
soul.

The world is my country; I believe
humanity’s goal is universal brother-
hood.

rary or artificial '.differences, that

one.

a literature will grow up, proselytising
lecturers will be sent out, the idea will
grow, expand, and intensify amongst
the thinkers of every nation, and then
it will soon be brought within the
range of practical politics, and become
far and away the grandest fact that
ever yet occurred in the government
of the world.
<s> <s> <s>
Disputes may come, wars may come,
but the end is world federation, and
once accomplished, the majority of
men will mentally and physically fight
like the Americans for the eternal per-
manence of the union.

It is not because some cannot see
how a thing can be done that therefore
it cannot be done. No human being

By the evolution of thousands of
little actions of human progress, the
federation of the whole world is gradu-
ally but surely approaching'.

The progress of the world during
the next hundred years from now will
be enormous, astounding, and greater
than that of all the previous centuries

Maxims of truth and universal bro-

age of a federated world.
So great is the growing power of
books, as the effective vehicle convey-
ing the thoughts of man to man every-
where, that they will be the principal
agency which will bring about the
federation of the whole world.

FEDERATION.


FEDER A TION
It is held by many that the ambi-
tions and selfishness of nations, the
enmities of races, the claims of dyn-
asties, and so forth',; will prevent the
Federation of the World, but mankind
is growing: wiser and better, and the
next hundred years will show enor-
mous changes.


Boofys
Books make the difference between
earth’s learned and its fools.
<s><s><s>
The reading- inclination in man is a
peculiar and fascinating one.
<s><s><s>
Of all a man’s worldly goods, books
have the most intrinsic worth.
<s><s>
It is by the multiplication and diffu-
sion of books that men can best com-
municate their ideas to each other the
wide world over.


BOOKS
From books we learn every useful
thing’ to satisfy the body and the mind.
<s>■s><s>
lis books that bring the whole
world into view, and give the reader
vast delights the bookless never knew
<s> <s> <s>
Reading has a soothing effect on the
troubled mind.
<s> <* 4
It is books which reveal the power
of human thought.
Books show that the highest gauge
in the Creator’s mortal plan is God’s
masterpiece on earth, his noblest crea-
ture, man.


BOOKS
Books-make known to men every
phase of life.
<*> <s> <§>
Books I love, and, if the expression
may be allowed, idolise, for their un-
paralleled value as the agency helping-
man to higher destinies in this life
and the next.
<S> <B> <s>
Take books out of the world, and
the life of the most intelligent would
scarcely be worth living.
❖ <s> <s>•
Books are the treasuries of know-
ledge.
Books teach, by unity of thought,
the brotherhood of man.


BOOKS
Books till the memory with wealth.
<s> '<»> <s>
Books please, comfort, and instruct;
without them we should be ignorant
and miserable. We cannot conceive of
a high state of civilisation without
books.
<s>■'<s><s>
Books show narcotics, toxicants,
Of each and every kind,
Insidious destroyers all
Of body and of mind.
<♦> <s> <*>
The simple picture book is a factor
in the education of children.
<s>*<s> <♦>
Books display the power of thought
and all that speech conveys.


BOOK S .
Books should be found in every
home,
To form and feed the mind;
They are the best of luxuries
To happify mankind.
For all the books in all the world
Are man’s most precious treasure:
They make him wise, and briny to
His best, his choicest pleasure.
Books, like strong- drink, will drown
man’s cares,
But do not waste his wealth ;
Books leave him better, drink the
worse,
In character and health.
Books make his time pass happily,
Relieve his weary hours;
Amuse, compose, instruct his mind;;
Enlarge his mental powers


BOOKS
Books thus will cause the flag of
peace
Through earth to be unfurled—
Produce “ the parliament of man,”
And federate the world.
Books give us knowledge while on
earth
I hat makes us wiser here,
Which knowledge serves as capital
I o start with “ Over There.”
Books therefore are, of all we own,
The choicest things on earth ;
Books have, of all our worldly goods,
I he most intrinsic worth.
Books are the greatest blessing
bought, :
The grandest thing we sell;
Books bring more joy, books do
. more good,
Than mortal tongue can tell.


Hobbies
Whatever a man likes and eagerly
throws his thought and his whole
energy into, or “ follows with zeal or
delight;” that, is his hobby.
<*> <s> <s>
A person may ride a good hobby to
death, arid to'the neglect of other and
necessary things; or'may even waste
his energies in pursuing a foolish
hobby 'But even misapplied
energy is better for the world than a
listless apathy.
<s><s><s>
All the great, -good, and advanced
pioneers of the earth, have, almost to a
man, been hobbyists; or, in other


words, have, thrown their best energies
into their work until it became a great
part of their being, much engrossing
their thoughts by day, and ofttimes in-
fluencing their dreams by night. It
was their intense enthusiasm and ap-
plication to their object, or hobby,
which carried them along and pro-
duced results which made them stand
foremost before all their fellows,, and
astonished the world by the results of
their labours.
<s><s><s>
Persons follow their hobbies as la-
bours of love, and instead of working
with pain and weariness, they work
with ease and pleasure.
❖ <s><s>
Millions of people in the world are
at wrong occupations, and are made
unhappy through being compelled by

HOBBIES.


HOBBIES
various causes to follow hated tasks in-
stead of loved hobbies.
<s> <s> <s>
It is wisest and best for everybody,
as far as possible, to follow their own
inclination as an occupation, instead of
following - an occupation for which they
have neither taste, talent, nor adapta-
bility.


Order, Method and Habits.
One of the greatest and most bene-
ficial qualities in the world is method.
<s><s><s>
Methodical arrangement of place and
time brings pleasure, ease, profit, and
satisfaction in many ways.
<£> <S> <s>
One of the most important parts of
method is to do one thing at a time, and
give your whole attention to it.
<s><s> <s>
What a splendid time-saving, tem-
per-saving, money-saving thing is


method. A methodical man is worth
two careless, thoughtless, unmethodi-
cal ones.
❖ <*> <s>
Order is an essential part of method
or system. Order is opposed to dis-
order and confusion, and is absolutely
necessary to the well-being of every-
body and everything.
<s> <S> <s>
There can be no method without
habit.
<S> <S> <B>
Good habits are a great blessing, and
bad habits are a great curse.
<s> <s> <♦>
The forming of good habits and the
shunning of bad habits is absolutely a
part of human duty.
32
ORDER, METHOD, AND HABITS.


Always let your reason, or, in other
words, your better sense, govern you,
for even a habit, good in itself, may be
abused.
<s><&<s>
Do not waste time by foolish and
unnecessary exactness in detail —be
systematic, but sensible at the same
time, and yet in all cases be careful not
to ofifend the moral law.
<S> <6> <S>
A thing written down refreshes the
memory, and thereby becomes easier
to do.
<S> <S>
Setting things down every day to be
done and seen to is a good discipline,
and soon becomes a pleasant and pro-
fitable habit, produced by method.
<s> <*> <s>
A thing well thought out is half
done.
33
ORDER, METHOD, AND HABITS.


Economy
If a toan habitually live up to or
beyond his income, when enforced
idleness or sickness comes upon him,
he cannot find food for himself, and
therefore must live upon the industry
of others.
<£> <s> <♦>
A man has no right to waste his last
farthing in indulgences, and then, when
the evil day comes, loaf upon those
who have been more self-denying and
economical.
❖ <» <s>
Those who live beyond their means,
arid contract debts which they never
pay, are loafers upon society.


While the wasteful person is in dif-
ficulties and unhappy, the economical
person has fewer troubles and more
happiness.
<s> <«> <S>
An economical husband and an eco-
nomical wife are teachers and examples
to their children.
<s> <s>
The men who succeed best in the
world are those who economise their
resources.
<s><»><s>
The employee who is economical in
his own affairs gets into a habit of
economy, and it becomes second na-
ture to him to economise his master’s
goods, besides having more or less
wealth of his own, honestly earned and
saved.
35
ECONOMY.


Economy and wastefulness are
habits that will influence us in all
things, whether we are engaged about
our own substance or that of another.
<s><s><§>
To waste another’s goods is the same
as to rob him.
e ❖ <s>
A person who takes no care of the
materials committed to his hands by
his employer will never duly husband
his own property.
<s> <s> <•>
The main principle in economising
labours and duties is to think of what
one is doing, and do it in the most
advantageous and economcal way.
<s><s><?>
Economy and parsimony are not
synonymous words.
36
ECONOMY.


ECONOMY.
False economy is economy run mad
By niggardly or blind economy one
loses live, ten, or a hundred times as
much as one makes.
❖ <*> <*>
The essence of civilisation is
economy. Nor can mankind progress
without it.


Oneness of Man
Men of all races, colours and creeds
—men everywhere, physically, men-
tally, morally, religiously, and in every
act of life, are one.
<e> <J> <£>
The coming unity and federation of
the race is inevitable. Nations will
agree because it will pay best, because
it will be morally right, and because it
will be most pleasant and happifying
to all.
<s><s><s>
One great stumbling-block to fairly
considering the claims of all mankind
to a universal brotherhood is that of
colour, and this prejudice among many
white people is very strong. But why


should a portion of mankind be pun-
ished by ostracism because they and
their forefathers had their lot cast in
a hot country and got their skins sun-
tanned —the colour of a man’s skin does
not affect his body or his immortal
sonl.
<s> <S> <S>
When the coloured man is educated
he acts just like any other civilised
man.

Many and various potent agencies
are hastening the greatest and most
glorious event in the history of man-
kind —the Federation of the World.

The possibility and desirability of
the Federation of the World will soon
become among all natiops a confirmed

effort, and then a realised fact.
<J> <s>
The spread of education and litera-
ture far and wide is the principal
agency that will bring - about the Fede-
ration of the World.
<♦> <s> <*>
Men will g - radually come to see that
a federated world, with its five hundred
nationalities, can be governed as well
or better than the one hundred nation-
alities of the British Empire, which
are now under one Supreme Govern-
ment.
<s> <s> <s>
If all men throughout the world
were well accmainted with each other
there would be little or no war, for then
only the most wicked would have to be
kept in order.
40
ONENESS OF MAN.


Were every human being' taught to
read in one language, wars would
rapidly cease, for all would then see
that mankind is one brotherhood, one
in every attribute and act of life, and
war would then appeal to the vast ma-
jority as a hateful, senseless, sinful
waste.
<s><s><s>
St. Paul preached the oneness of
man, the glorious truth that all na-
tions upon the face of the earth are of
one blood, and, in spite of the general
human ignorance of humanity itself —
in spite of bitter national hatreds and
prejudices, a few in all countries and
ages have taught the same, and this
idea is now happily fast spreading
throughput the world.
<s> <s> <s>
All the great religions and great men
of the world have taught the unity of
men.
41
ONENESS OF MAN.


Much injustice and suffering results
from the ignorance of man about man.
<s> <s> <s>
You cannot draw a line between
man and man, on account of the grade
of his skin or the grade of his civilisa-
tion.
<S> <s>
A peculiar substance called “ pig-
ment ” exists in the skin of every hu-
man being, in all countries, and ex-
ternal light and heat are the principal
agents which develop or bring it out.
Wherever white people settle in the
tropics, in the course of time they be-
come coloured. This can be seen by
a reference to complexions all over the
world. The influence of the climate of
Australia on the complexion is no ex-
ception to the rule.
ONENESS OF MAN.


The fact is dawning - upon mankind
that the natural differences between
nations, mentally, morally and physi-
cally, are very little greater than those
between brothers of the same family.
43
ONENESS OF MAN.


Religion and Humanity
The world is my country, and to do
good is my religion.

The great central truth of all the reli-
gions of mankind is Goodness, and

When men suffer and die for the
sacred principles of truth, they suffer
or die for the benefit of the world. In
after times multitudes recognise the

The religion of the future will not

Writing - is educative, for it assists
progress, and makes unity abound.

The newspaper is the most effective
transmitter of thought, and is destined
to be the world’s greatest educator.

The newspaper is an up-to-date

The educating power of the news-
paper is in its eagerly sought daily
lesson, which, while it educates, raises
the general tone of intelligence.


An absolute necessity of the future
will be condensed libraries for the
ready instruction, elevation and grati-
fication of universal humanity. The
cream of human thought, collected into
a convenient form, and brought within
the reach of everyone, will do much to
spread the principles of right and truth

rightly, and consequently alike; and so
bring about the federation of the
human race.

Fun and Laughter.
It is said that in this world there are
ten parts of sorrow to one part of joy.
Now, I hold that this is not a fair pro-
portion—that there is not enough joy
for the sorrow—that there ought to be
at least as much joy as sorrow to make
things healthy and pleasant. I firmly
believe that, beyond the grave, we shall
have more joy, more fun, more laugh-
ter than sorrow. But that is no rea-
son why we should not have a larger
proportion of joy, fun and laughter
bere, and try our best to produce it.
<s> <♦> <s>
Laughter is an external expression of
joy. It is the most salutary expres-
sion of all the bodily movements, for it


agitates both the body and the soul
at the same time, promotes digestion,
circulation, and perspiration, and en-
livens the powers in every organ.
<s> "$> <s>
Laugh yourself heartily, and you
will feel better. Make your friend
laugh, and you will make him happier.
Make your enemy laugh, and he will
hate you less. Make a stranger laugh,
and you will give him more confidence.
Make the sorrowful laugh, and you
will lessen their grief. Make the
desponding laugh, and you will raise
their hopes. Make the old laugh, and
you will make them feel younger.
Make the child laugh, and you will
make it better tempered, more healthy,
more happy and more loving.

Honesty .
Honesty pays best, and brings most
happiness.
<*> <s> <S>
Honesty, with a little self-interest in
it, is better than dishonesty—when we
•do good to gain heaven, there is self-
interest in it. If man can do himself
good by doing good to others, why
should he not?
<s><s><»
It is nobler to be honest from prin-
ciple than from self-interest, but be
honest, anyhow.
Honesty is good for all mankind.
Honesty hurts nobody, but does every-
body good.


HONESTY.
The honest are the noblest nobles;
they are respected and loved by every-
body ; their work on earth is a glorious
one.

By precept and practice the honest
do away with prejudice, hatred, and
war, make friends of all men, bring
about peace, unity, and the Federation
of the World, and finally satisfaction„
and happiness beyond the grave.

Punctuality.
Punctuality should stand as the hist
rule of conduct; it is essential to the
proper beginning' of all action.
<s> <S> <s>
In all cases unpunctuality is a
serious fault, in others a breach of
faith, and sometimes downright dis-
honesty.
<s> <B> <s>
The habit of being prompt, once
formed, extends to everything—meet-
ing friends, paying debts, keeping pro-
mises, and, indeed, to every relation
and act, however trivial.
<♦> <s> <s>
The person who is punctual in all
his doings commands the respect and
confidence of all who know him.


The great men of the earth, and the
successful men of the earth, have al-
most invariably been punctual men.
<s> <s> <s>
Punctual people may be divided into
three principal classes: firstly, those
who are punctual by nature; secondly,
those who are punctual because they
feel it their duty to be so; thirdly,
those who have been brought up to
habits of punctuality. To all these
punctuality becomes a confirmed habit
and easy of practice.
<s> <s> <s>
xY great deal that man is compelled
to do in pursuit of duty is not what he
would like to do from choice, but abne-
gation of self at the shrine of duty
seems to be largely man’s lot upon
earth, and no doubt it makes a better
man of him.

Behind in the morning, behind all

tual man.

Frequently where two or three, or a
greater number, are employed, an un-

standstill, so that he not only loses his
own time, but theirs also.

Untruthfulness
What is called a “ white lie ” is told
by many who would not tell what they
term a black or wicked He. The April
fool absurdity is a representative spe-
cimen of a white lie.
<s> <♦> <♦>
“ Half lies ” generally have some
truth and more or less of falsehood in
them. 1 hey are a very dangerous
form of lie, which it is very difficult to
disprove *in our uncharitable world.
Sometimes they may be of little con-
sequence, but frequently a person’s
character and prospects are cruellv
ruined by this form of lie.


UNTRUTHFULNESS.
We all tell lies more or less, either
by word or act, but let us hope and
pray that the time is fast arriving
when all of us —all mankind —can and
will live without this demoralising and
deplorable sin of lying.

Songs, Music and Poetry.
Songs blend the beauty of the voice
with the wisdom of the intellect and
the feelings of the heart.

Stmg-s portray the sentiments and
passions of men. They are almost the
soul literature of the strongest of all
human passions, viz., Love.

side of life in a pleasing and forceful
manner.

As a means of spreading a sentiment
