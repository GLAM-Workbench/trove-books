PREFACE.
A simple and obvious fact hitherto unrecognised, leads to a clear
explanation of all the phenomena of the Universe, and to a demon-
stration of the Universe having been constructed, and being maintained
in order, by an all powerful being, as manifest as is a city of having
been constructed and maintained in order by human beings.
This simple fact is that the five stages in which we see the five zones
of systems of the Universe are five different degrees of heat of the
same process through which the Universe is ever passing, ever
cooling down from the highest degree of heat, that of nebulous
stars, through successive lower degrees of heat, irresolvable resol-
vable nebulae Milky Way, to the lowest degree of heat, the stage
of solar systems w r hich, by the restoration in definite amounts at
successive definite intervals of time of the heat thus radiated, again
becomes the highest degree of heat to similarly cool down to the
lowest j the higher degree of heat ever becoming the lower, and the
lowest followed by ever becoming the highest; these degrees of heat
or stages, ever circulating thus from the centre to the borders of the
Universe, thence directly through the centre again to the borders in
endless precedence and succession.
And as the sub-stages pass similarly from the centre to the borders
of each system, every system is constructed like the Universe, and
therefore like each other, differing only in size; similar planets
constituting the zones of systems; similar systems constituting the
corresponding zones of the Universe ; and similar universes constituting
the corresponding zones of a vast system of Universes.
For the visible Universe is also one of many similar Universes, as
all its members are ever passing through the different stages of the
same process, and composed of the same matter as one half of that
matter is permanently suns for the illumination of the other half
which temporarily becomes similar suns to assist in its illumination
as will be fully explained in the following pages, which are an expla-
nation not of an imaginary, but as every reader will be convinced of
the actual constitution of the Universe as all its phenomena follow
necessarily therefrom.

THE UNIVERSE.
THE Visible Unitbbsk consists of five zones of systems in the five
stages or degrees of heat of the same process ?of the central zone,
consisting of Sirius, of the smaller systems on his borders of the zone ;
of still smaller solar systems on their borders, and of binary
systems on its borders; and of the four exterior zones of systems of
the Milky Way, and resolvable nebulae with binary systems in these stages
on their borders of irresolvable nebulae, and binary nebulae on their
borders, and of the zone now-nebulous stars, which being evidently
the highest degree of heat is the first stage irresolvable nebulae a
lower degree of heat, the second stage; as the nebulous tails of comets
directed from the sun, and the nebulous bodies of the zodiacal zone on
the borders of must be in lower degrees of heat than the sun, resol-
vable nebulae partially free from nebulosity in a lower degree of heat,
the third stage; Milky Way, which is the resolvable stage, wholly free
from nebulosity in a lower degree of heat, the fourth stage ; and solar
systems or the opaque stage, in a still lover degree of heat, the fifth
and last stage ; and evidently the zones in the successive lower degrees
of heat have been in similar succession in the highest degree of heat.
Hence the visible Universe, all its members being in the different
stages of the same process is one system, and all its zones of systems
having been in the highest, must become the lowest degree of heat.
And as the solar system, now in the lowest has been in the highest
degree of heat, the first stage, its zones of planets must have been
similar to the sun, which like the sun of every other system must,
have been the centre ?the first substage of the nebulous star and
the four zones of planets, similar substages, and therefore, the matter
of the sun is identical with that of the planets, the sun by his greatest
size being in the highest degree of heat, and all the systems in the
Universe as they become similar nebulous stars are composed of the
same matter as that of the solar system, and are similarly constituted
as they are similar in each stage, differing only in size, the stages being
the appearances which the same matter simdarly constituted assumes in
their degrees of heat, and therefore the matter and heat of the smaller
systems are apportioned in amounts exactly corresponding to those in
which the matter and heat of the larger are apportioned.
When the zones of systems in the successive lower degrees of heat
were in the highest, they must have been preceded and followed
by the other stages, in their present order ; the proceeding stage ever
becoming the succeeding, and therefore, the last as it immediately
precedes, ever becoming the first stage, and consequently, no system
can be in a stage out of the zone in which that stage is.
When the systems in the last stage were nebulous stars, the zone
now Milky Way was solar systems, resolvable nebulae, Milky Way
irresolvable resolvable nebulae, and the zone now-nebulous stars
irresolvable nebula. When the zone now Milky Way was nebulous
. stars, the zone now-resolvable nebulae, was solar systems irresolvable
nebulae Milky Way, the zone now-nebulous stars resolvable nebulae,
and the sone now, solar systems irresolvable nebulas, which, therefore,


must have passed directly from the zcne new-nebulous stars to that
now-eolar systepas, and therefore solar systems, the last stage must be
at the centre, and the first stage nebulous stars on the borders of the
Universe. . , ,
When resolvable nebulae were nebulous stars irresolvable nebulae
were solar systems ; nebulous stars, on the borders Milky Way solar
systems at the centre resolvable nebulae the Milky Way irresolvable
nebulae. When irresolvable nebulae were nebulous stars, the nebulous
stars on the borders were solar systems the central, zone Milky May,
the zone now Milky Way resolvable nebulae resolvable irresolvable
nebulae, and the border zone being nebulous stars, the order of the
stages is that in which we see them.
Thus the stage of nebulous stars in which was the solar system has
since passed from the centre through the zones of systems to its
present position on the borders of the Universe, preceded by the last
and other stages in their present order, which therefore passed directly
from the borders to and through the centre to their present positions,
so that the stages circulate from the centre through the intermediate,
and border zones directly to and through the central zone in endless
precedence and succession, the first stage ever following the last,
which is ever becoming the first, a process ever beginning where it ends
and ever repeating.
These stages must have passed from the borders to the centre as
the stage of nebulous stars now on the borders is passing to the
centre, the systems at the centre now solar systems, the last stage
again becoming nebulous stars the first stage.
As the last zone of planets of Sirius is in the last sub-stage of the
last stage, illuminated by the succeeding zone, in the corresponding
last sub-stage of the first stage, and the sun of the solar system in the
first sub-stage of the first stage, illuminating the inner planets in the
corresponding first sub-stage of the last so Sirius must have been like
the solar system in the first sub-stage of the first stage, illuminating
his inner planets, in the corresponding first sub-stage of the last stage,
and the solar system must become like Sirius illuminating Neptune in
the fourth sub-stage of the last stage, Neptune being the fourth zone
of planets. .
Hence the opaque stage, when on the borders of the Universe com-
menced in the inner planets of Sirius at the centre, as it has since
commenced in the inner planets of the solar system, and as the pre-
sent protozoic period of Jupiter and Saturn the first of the exterior zones
of planets is coincident, as will be found with all the periods of the
inner planets, so the protozoic period of the first zone of exterior
planets of Sirius was coincident with all the periods of his inner planets.
And as the post-glacial period of Jupiter and Saturn, equal to, as will
be found, is coincident with the protozoic of Uranus, and the post-
glacial of Uranus equal to, is coincident with the protozoic of Nep-
tune, so the postglacial period of the last zone of planets of the systems
on the borders of the Universe equal to, was coincident with the
protozoic of the first zone of exterior planets of Sirius at the centre,
as the post-glacial of this first exterior zone of planets equal to, was
coincident with the protozoic of the second zone ; and thus to the last
zone of planets of Sirius, of which the post-glacial equal to, will be


Coincident with the protozoic of the first exterior zone of planets of the
systems in the Milky Way. And thus from zone to zone of planets, and
from zone to zone of systems, the stages terminating coincidently in
each zone of systems, as in each zone of planets; and therefore the
systems and planets, in corresponding positions on the inner and outer
borders of their zones, are coincident in their last periods the smaller
commencing when they will terminate the stage at the same time with
the larger. And as the last sub-stages of the first and last stages are
now coincident in Sirius, they must terminate coincidently as the first
sub-stages of the first and last stages at his centre, were coincident
and terminated coincidently ; and as the Sun and inner planets in the
same first sub-stases of the first and last stages must terminate coinci-
dently for the illumination of Jupiter and Saturn, coincidently habit-
able. And as all the planets of a zone, and all the systems of a zone
thus terminate its stages, at the same time the smaller systems on the
borders of Sirius down to the zone of small solar systems have com-
menced ; and the yet smaller binary systems will commence when they
will terminate the stage, and become nebulous stars at the same time,
and therefore the opaque stage of the last zone of planets of Sirius must
be coincident with, and equal to, the opaque stage ot the four zones of
planets of the solar system. _
And this is very clearly indicated in the corresponding advance ot
the opaque stage in the planets of Sirius, and in the zones of planets of
the solar system ?Jupiter and Saturn, the second zone of planets, being
near the close of their protozoic periods, which the planets of Sirius
have, as will be found terminated, and commenced the succeeding
northern tropical period since the second century.^
Thus, the five periods of the larger planets of Sirius ?the protozoic,
the northern tropical, the pre-glacial, glacial, and post-glacial periods
common to all planets in the last stage, will be coincident with the five
similar periods of the inner planets, with the five similar periods of
Jupiter and Saturn, with those of Uranus, and with those of Neptune;
the length of each of these five periods in each planet being equal, and
corresponding to its mass.
Hence Sirius, and the smaller systems on his borders, composing
the central zone of the Universe, will become nebulous stars on ter-
minating their pre-'ent opaque stage, and the nebulous stars on the
borders will become irresolvable nebulae, ard the zones in the other
stages become the succeeding stages ?the five zones ot systems being in
coincident corresponding advance in the five stages which terminate in
them at the same time, and therefore the period of each stage in each
zone is equal. And of this the equivalent antecedent is. that the
leading systems in each zone consist of a like number of zones of
planets, and the leading planets in each zone, equal in matter; and
therefore the leading planets of the leading systems on the borders
of the Universe are equal to the leading planets of Sirius at the centre.
Thus the sub-stages of the first stage have followed, illuminating the
corresponding sub-stages of the last stage from the centre to the
borders of Sirius, the sub-stages of the last ever becoming the corres-
ponding sub-stages of the first, precisely as in the Universe, the first
stage ever follows the last, which is ever becoming the first. And as
these sub-stages must pass similarly through the solar and every


system, all systems must be constructed liVe the Universe; and tkerd-
f�re, like each other, as moreover they are all composed of the same
matter passing through the same process, similar in each stage, differ-
ing only in size, and their matter and heat being in corresponding
proportions, their centres and zones of planets must correspond in
size and position to those of the centre, and zones of systems of the
Universe.
As the central zone of the Universe consists of Sirius, of the smaller
systems on his borders, diminishing from half his size and corresponding
to the binary systems on the borders of the other zones, of the zone of
solar systems and of the binary systems on its border diminishing in
size from a Centauri, normally half the size of the solar system, to that
of the Swan, so the centre of every system consists of its Sun, the
counterpart of Sirius of the nebulous bodies of the zodiacal zone, the
counterparts of the smaller systems on the borders of Sirius, of the
zone of inner planets, and of the asteriods on the borders, the counter-
parts of the zone of solar system and of the binary systems on its
borders ; the asteroids similarly diminishing in size from Mars, the
counterpart of a centauri, and normally half the size of the earth, the
counterpart of the solar system, Venus and Mercury, being the counter-
parts of the corresponding systems on the inner borders of the zone,
and the exterior zones of planets and the asteroids on their borders
are equally exact counterparts of the corresponding zones of systems,
and of the binary systems on their borders. And as the sun and inner
planets of every system cool down from a nebulous star coincidently
to the first substages of the first and last stages, the latter to be illumi-
nated by the former, the exterior zones of planets in the intermediate
degrees of heat must cool down/it the same time to the first sub-stages
of the intermediate stages, as they then cool down in succession to
the sub-stages of the last stage, the zones of planets of every system
thus cooling down coincidently to the first sub-stages of the stages as
they circulate in the Universe, and then in succession from the
centre to the borders of systems, as the stages from the centre to the
borders of the Udiverse, and therefore every system is constructed like
the Universe, and each other differing only in number of zones, and
as the first sub-stages of the first and last stages in the Sun and inner
planets are by their relative sizes coincident, that the latter may be
illuminated by the former, so the sub-stages of the first and last stages
in the other zones must be coincident, that the latter be illuminated
by the former.
Sirius, the leading system of the central zone, and therefore the
leading systems of the four exterior zones, as the stages pass through
them in equal periods, consist each of one inner and four exterior zones
of planets, with asteroidal zones on their borders, corresponding in
number, size and position to those of the zone of solar and four
exterior zones of systems of the Universe, and the binary systems on
their borders, and the small solar system of an inner, and of
three exterior zones of planets with asteroidal zones on their borders,
and the yet smaller binary systems of a sun-asteroidal zone, and one
planet corresponding to Sirius, the smaller systems on his borders and
to the zone of solar systems.
As the sun'and inner planets of the larger systems are coincident in


the first sub-stages of the first and last stages by the Sun being in the
exact degree larger than the inner planets, thus subdivided the two
stars of binary systems of a Oentauri for instance, being equal in
matter and not subdivided, must cool down, and become Sun and
planet differently.
As the normal size of Mars is, as will be fonnd, half that of the
earth, and therefore Mars commences when the earth is half through
the opaque stage, so the normal size of a Oentauri is half that of the
solar system, and a Oentauri commences when the solar system is
half through the opaque stage. Hence, by the time the solar system
is half through the opaque stage, the two stars of a Oentauri, each
equal to 7� earths, will have cooled down coincidently to the com-
mencement of the northern tropical period, thus becoming two planets,
when the central planet, by the restoration of the radiated heat is
reinstated a Sun, the two planets thus becoming Sun and planet,
which they remain till the solar and other systems of the zone, become
nebulous stars, when they also become nebulous stars.
And as the adjustment of planets in sizes, so as to cool down
coincidently to the first sub-stages of the stages, is conclusive evidence
of matter and heat being unalterable in their properties, and as on
the successive application of fuel to a furnace, the flame suddenly
blazes up and gradually subsides, so on the successive application
of heat in its primal state to reinstate the central planet a Sun, the
flame suddenly expands and gradually subsides, the phenomena of
variable stars on the borders of Sirius, which are binary systems,
smaller than the solar system, commencing the stage which the solar
and larger systems had commenced. Consequently, on the corres-
ponding advance of the opaque stage in the solar system, a Oentauri
and the binary systems on the borders will become variable stars, and
exhibit similar phenomena.
Thus the five zones in the present stages become coincidently the
succeeding stages, and therefore the stages pass in equal periods of
time through the central and each exterior zone of systems, and the
leading systems in the five zones consist each of an inner and four
exterior zones of planets, and the leading planets in each zone eqnal
in matter and the smaller systems and planets on the inner and outer
borders of their zones are virtually equal in size and coincident
in period, and commence when they will terminate the stage at the
same time with the larger.
Minute as must be in every system the counterparts of the members
of the Universe, yet these minute counterparts subserve necessary
purposes, as evidenced in the small solar system by the zones of
asteroids, the counterparts of the smaller systems and of the still
smaller binary systems.
The solar system consists of the sun of the small nebulous bodies of
the zodiacal zone on his borders of the zone of inner planets and of the
asteroids on its borders; of Jupiter and Satnrn one zone j and of
Uranus and Neptune each a zone. .
Thus the small nebulous bodies of the zodiacal zone are by size and
position on the borders of the sun the highest degree of heat in the
next lower degree of heat, the inner planets and the smaller asteroids
by their sizes and positions, in the lowest degree of heat and the larger


exterior planets by their sizes and positions in the intermediate degrees
of heat. And as all these bodies are in lower degrees of the heat of
the sun corresponding to their size, they must all have been
simultaniously in the highest degree of heat and similar to the sun.
Hence the nebulous star which the solar system was consisted of the
sun of the zone of inner and of three exterior zen-ts of planets, all of
which being similar to the sun have cooled down coincidently to their
present degrees of heat, the sun at the centre the largest and still in the
highest degree of heat, the inner planets the smallest in the lowest
degree of heat, and the three exterior zones in the preceding degrees of
heat of the inner.
And as the nebulous bodies of the zodiacal zone are situated on the
sun?s equator and deflect as evidenced by the corona his light they must
also deflect his heat, and therefore their purpose must be to modify by
deflecting the light and heat of the sun, for when the inner planets
become like the sun the asteroids on their borders must become
nebulous, a similar zodiacal zone to modify by deflecting their light
and heat 5 and therefore the nebulous bodies of the zodiacal zone are
asteroids differing only in stage from the asteroids on the border of the
inner planets, as these having been like the sun, differ only in stage
from the layers of the sun ; and as the exterior planets become similar
suns similar asteroids must be on the borders of their zones to be-
come similar zodiacal zones when their planets become incandescent
layers.
And as the purpose of the zodiacal zones is to modify the light and
heat of the sub-stages, the number of asteroids constituting, each zone
must correspond to their size of orbit, the asteroids on the borders of
the inner planets more numerous than those of the zodiacal zone, and
those on the borders of Jupiter and Saturn still more numerous, and
therefore binary systems also correspond in number to size of orbit.
When then the inner planets at the end of their postglacial period
and the asteroids on the borders become like the sun and zodiacal zone
Jupiter and Saturn, one zone, will commence their northern tropical
period when Jupiter and Saturn and the asteroids of their zone become
like the sun and zodiacal zone, Uranus will commence his northern
tropical period and when Uranus and his asteroids become a sun
and zodiacal zone, Neptune will commence his northern tropical period
and the position of Neptune the last planet of the system and therefore
not requiring his light and heat to be modified, indicates that there are
no asteroids on his borders as on his becoming like the sun the system
again becomes a nebulous star.
And as the sun illuminates the inner planets, so the four inner
planets become little suns together for the illumination of Jupiter and
Saturn, which become suns coincidently for the illumination of
Uranus as he becomes a sun for the illumination of Neptnne, all the
planets of a zone thus terminating its stage at the same time, and all
the zones thus in succession supplementing the sun in their illumina-
tion. And as Jupiter and Saturn are in the next higher degree of
heat than that of the inner planets Uranus in a higher than that of
Jupiter and Saturn and Neptune in a higher than that of Uranus,
Neptune is in the next lower degree of heat than that of the Sun and
therefore must have been nebulous similar to the small nebulous


asteroids of the zodiacal zone, and consequently tlie successive lowdr
degrees of heat than that of the Sun, in which are the four zones
of planets result from their sizes and positions.
And as the inner planets at the end of the first sub-stage of the last
stage become the second sub-stage of the first stage for the illumination
of Jupiter and Saturn in the second sub-stage of the last, and Jupiter
and Saturn the third sub-stage of the first for the illumination of
Uranus in the third sub-stage of the last, and Uranus the fourth
sub-stage of the first for the illumination of Neptune, in the correspond-
ing fourth sub stage of the last, the highest degree of heat follows
illuminating from the centre to the borders of the solar system as from
the centre to the borders of Sirius the zone of planets in the lowest
degree of heat which is ever becoming the highest as in the Universe,
the zone of systems in the highest, ever follows the zone of systems in
the lowest degree of heat, which is ever becoming the highest.
These five degrees of heat correspond to those of the five stages of
the Universe, and the positions of the zones of planets in them
correspond to those of the zones of systems in the five stages ; the sun,
the first sub-stage to that of nebulous stars, the zone of inner planets
to that of the zone of solar systems, Jupiter and Saturn to that of the
Milky Way, Uranus to that of resolvable and Neptune to that of
irresolvable nebulae; and therefore the position of nebulous stars with
respect to the last stage must correspond to that of the sun, with
respect to the inner planets in the last stage the nebulous stars on the
borders of the Universe following solar systems at the centre which
are again becoming nebulous stars.
As the preceding sub-stage of the inner planets was that in which
Jupiter and Saturn new are their rotation must have been at least
equal to that of Jupiter and Saturn and therefore their present, much
slower rotation results from their cooling down to their present sub-
stage, and thus diminution of rotation corresponds to diminution of
heat so that in higher degrees of heat, the rotation must be more
rapid and the oblateness proportionally greater.
Hence in the highest degree of heat that of the sun planets by their
oblateness expanding with their rapid rotation become incandescent
layers, similar to those of which Sir J. Herschel discovered the sun to
consist.
Thus the incandescent layers of which the sun consists and of which
Sir J. Herschel discovered ? three at least ? are similar to those of the
planets when the system is a nebulous star and as the layers of the
planets, revolve around the sun, the layers of the sun resolve around the
kernel.
The interstices of the layers separated by at least ? Ten Thousand
Miles ? must be the spots of the sun as all the phenomena presented by
the spots necessarily follow from the interstices in the revolution of
the layers.
And as the layers of the sun are perpendicular to the ecliptic, the
layers of the planets in their revolution must be perpendicular to the
ecliptic, and necessarily blend with the matter of their satellites, which
must also become incandescent so that as the zones of planets of every
system supplement its sun in their illumination, satellites having
furnished their primaries with light at night during the opaque stage


blend with them in the succeeding stage, and supplement them in
furnishing the next zone of planets with light and heat by day and
thus the sun planets, satellites &c. &c., of the solar system are
identical in matter.
Hence their oblateness, as it is the remnant is a visible proof of
planets having been incandescent layers from which as they cooled
down their rotation, and consequently their oblateness diminishing, they
necessarily became globular.
And as all the planets of a zone terminate its stage at the same time,
those on the inner and outer borders must be coincident in period,
Yenus in the period of the Earth, Mercury in that of Mars and
Jupiter in that of Saturn ; and as planets equal in matter and heat and
similarly environed must cool down in equal periods of time, so planets
containing double and half the matter and heat cool down in double
and half the time.
Hence an amount of matter may be sub divided and adjusted in
position so as to cool down to a requisite degree of heat at a definite
period of the time required by the same amount of matter in one body
of which the inner planets of every system furnish an instance, as they,
equal in matter to each larger exterior planet, by being thus subdivided
and adjusted in positions, cool down to and terminate the habitable
state in one fourth of the time required by each larger exterior planet, the
protozoic of Jupiter and Saturn, equal to each of their other four periods,
being coincident with the five similar periods of the inner planets. And
as planets in cooling down must be more or less affected by position
with respect to their source of light and heat, the smaller less affected
than the larger so two planets equal in matter and heat may be
adjusted in sizes corresponding to their positions with respect to their
source of light and heat so as to be coincident in period.
According to the principle of division into two equal parts, and of
sub-division into corresponding equal parts which will be found to
obtain throughout the Universe, the normal sizes of the Earth, and
Yenus and of Mars and Mercury are the mean of their sizes correspond-
ing to the mean of their orbits which they in the normal size would
occupy, and which would be the centre of the zone as the orbits of
Uranus and of Neptune occupy the centres or their zones.
But as they cannot occupy one orbit, so Yenus and Mercury on the
inner borders of the zone so much nearer the sun are as much less
than the normal size as the Earth and Mars on the outer so much
more distant are greater than the normal size. The normal size of the
Earth then is equal to two normal sized Mars or to Mars and Mercury
and her periods, double those of Mars and Mercury coincident, and
the normal size of Yenus equal to two normal sized Mercury?s, or to
Mercury and Mars, and her periods, double their periods, so
that planets and systems in corresponding positions on the
inner, and outer borders of their zones, are virtually equal in size, and
coincident in period, and the mean of their sizes their normal size,
and the smaller half the size of the larger.
Similarly Saturn is double the size of the Earth and Mars, and
Jupiter double the size of Venus and Mercury, and as their sizes thus
correspond to those of the Earth, and Yenus so the mean of their sizes,
is their normal size, corresponding to the mean of their orbits, and


equal to three normal sized Earths, or to the four inner planets and
quadruple their periods.
And as when Jupiter and Saturn cool down to the suh-stage of the
inner planets. Uranus cools down to that of Jupiter and Saturn, and
Neptune to that of Uranus, the periods of Uranus and Neptuue in
their respective sub-stages are equal, and each equal to that of Jupiter
and Saturn coincident in period, and therefore the four exterior planets
are equal in matter ; and Uranus and Neptune, their orbits occupying
the centres of their zones and corresponding to the mean of the orbits of
Jupiter and Saturn, are each the normal size of Jupiter and Saturn,
each equal to the four inner planets, and quadruple their periods.
Hence the four exterior planets are each equal to the four inner,
the matter assigned for the planets of the solar as for those of every
system being as will be found subdivided into five equal portions of
which the first is again subdivided into two larger equal portions,
and into two smaller equal portions, half the size of the larger, the
inner planets, which again are adjusted in sizes corresponding to their
positions with respect to the sun, so as to be coincident in period and
terminate their habitable state during the time the same amount of
matter in Jupiter or in Saturn coincident in period Is cooling down
to the habitable state. Hence the interior sizes of Uranus and of
Neptune as the greater sizes of Jupiter and Saturn, result from their
respective sub-stages; and the inferior size of Saturn, which must be in
size to Jupiter as ihe Earth to Yenus, results from the rings.
The adjustment of planets in sizes, corresponding to their positions
on the inner and outer borders of zones, though sufficing to effect
the coincidence of the smaller planets, as evidenced by Mars and
Mercury, requires to be supplemented by the ring process to effect the
coincidence of the larger planets, as evidenced by Saturn, in which the
ring process is now in operation, detaching and spreading out to cool
so much of his matter that, when cooled and re-united, Saturn, by his
matter thus reduced to the proper temperature, may be coincident with
Jupiter, and reinstated in size as the Earth to Venus, and therefore
the matter of the rings when cooled, must re-unite with Saturn.
With respect to the rings, Sir J. Herschel remarks :?? However
homely be the illustration, we can conceive nothing more apt in every
way to give a general conception of the maintenance of equilibrium,
under a constant tendency to subversion, than the mode in which a
practiced hand will maintain a long pola in a perpendicular position,
resting on the finger by a constant and almost imperceptible variation
of the point of support.? ? The observed oscillation of the centres of
the rings about that of the planet, is in itself the evidence of a per-
petual contest between conservative and destructive forces.? ? The
slightest difference of velocity between the body and the rings must
infallibly precipitate the latter on the former, never more to be
separated.?
That this very slight difference of velocity must ensue as Saturn
cools is clearly proved by the rotation of planets diminishing with
their heat, and therefore the disappearance of the rings by their
precipitation on the planet may be expected sooner or later, as their
precipitation is as inevitable as the diminution of heat.
The ring process thus employed in effecting the coincidence of the


planets of azone is similarly applied in effecting the coincidence of the
planets of adjoining zones in the sub-stages of the first and last
stages. That of the habitable state of Uranus, in which are indications
of its commencement with Jupiter and Saturn becoming incandescent
layers for his illumination, and the coincidence of the habitable state
of Neptune with Uranus becoming an incandescent layer.
And as the satellites with which we see the planets of the solar
system provided must have blended with their primaries, so they
must have been detached in a stage preceding the present in their
usual number and amounts of matter, that their primaries may be the
proper size to cool down coincidently to the first sub-stages of the
stages, and then in succession to the sub-stages of the last stage,
coincidently with the succeeding zone becoming the corresponding
sub-stage of the first for its illumination as, evidently these coincidences
could not otherwise result.
The satellites of the exterior planets then are detached in the
irresolvable stage, as evidenced by Neptune with 'all his satellites
issuing out of that stage, the preceeding stage of the cooling
down stages which will be found to be resolvable nebulas,
Milky Way and solar systems, this last being also the stage in which
all heat is restored; and when the earth and Yenus were in the
preceding sub-stage, that of Saturn and Jupiter, and therefore, with
similar inclinations of axes, as all planets in that stage resume, as will
be shown, Saturn?s inclination the earth was reduced to the proper
size with respect to Yenus by the same ring process, detaching in the
exact amount the matter of the Moon, as evidenced by the absence of
an atmosphere and of water in the Moon, as the rings of Saturn can
have no atmosphere or watery vapour?by the coincidence of her
rotation and revolution, which can result only from her matter having
been thus detached and agglomerated; and by the plane of the
Moon?s orbit coinciding, not with that of the earth?s equator, from
which her matter was detached, but with that of Saturn?s, to whose
inclination of axis that of the earth?s was similar when her matter was
detached, and therefore the Moon?s orbit is still in the plane in which
her matter was detached, and the Moon has not shared in the
subsequent changes of the earth?s axis.
And, though the termination of the process in the earth, the
agglomeration of the detached matter into the Moon, is the reverse
of its termination, in Saturn the reunion of the rings, the result is
the same in both planets, the earth?s coincidence with Yenus, and
Saturn?s with Jupiter.
Moreover, the Moon?s surface covered with fissures and extinct
volcanoes, with smooth glassy plains, formerly seas of molten matter,
but now cooled similar to ? sea bottoms ? is a facsimile of the surface of
every planet in the Universe before sufficiently cooled to be occupied
by its waters, and bear testimony to the matter of the Moon having been
when detached agglomerated before cooled as much as the outer rings
of Saturn.
The smooth glazed plains testify also to the absence of water which
would occupy those plains when cooled, as thtf waters of the Earth
have occupied the precisely similar but much larger plains of molten
matter, now the beds of her seas and oceans, which otherwise must


have covered her entire surface, so that the state of the Moon is
precisely the state of the Earth and of every planet, before its waters
can occupy its molten basins; and the Moon?s surface has remained in
its present state during the time the similar surface of the Earth by
the action of the elements has been reduced to its present state, and
therefore if similar elements existed in the Moon her surface would
have been reduced to a similar state.
Thus, as all planets are composed of the same matter, and of a
corresponding amount of the same heat similarly environed, and to all
in the last and preceding sub-stages pertain, as will be shown, similar
series of inclinations of axis, and of states resulting therefrom, the con-
sequents of these similar antecedents in every planet must be similar,
the beds for their waters being similarly prepared, the positions of
their seas, and, therefore, of their continents, must be similar, differ-
ing only in extent, their Africas and Americas similarly terminating
towards the south. And of this, Mars, the only planet whose surface
can be discerned, is proof, as the positions of his seas more or less
correspond to those of the seas of the Earth.
As the surface of the moon is still in the glazed state to which her
matter cooled from its molten state, there never can have been water
or atmosphere, plant, or animal in the Moon, and therefore her purpose
is solely by her glazed surface to furnish the Earth with light at night
as that of the Sun is solely to furnish her and the other planets Vith
light and heat by day.
As the satellites of the exterior planets are detached in the irre-
solvable stage, as evidenced by Neptune with his satellites, the retro-
grade motions of the satellites of Uranus clearly indicate that satellites
in his sub-stage, and therefore in that of Neptune stand to their
primaries in the relations in which their matter stood before being
detached, sharing when detached, as when united in every change of
axis, as the retrograde motion results from the present position of
Uranus? axis being the reverse of its position when the satelites were
detatched in the preceding sub-stage; and from the satellites sharing
in this total change of position of axis, as may be understood by the
motion of the hand round the pen becoming reversed as the position
of the pen is reversed, satellites in these two sub-stages sharing in every
change of axis of primaries.
And as the inclination of Jupiter?s axis nearly coincides with the
planes of the orbits of his satellites, which were detached from bis
equator, and therefore cannot have shared in this change of his axis,
the satellites of Uranus share?and those of Jupiter do not share?in the
changes of positions of their axes. And as Jupiter and Saturn are one
zone-and in sizes corresponding to those of Venus and the Earth,
and, like them, coincident in period, and their inclinations of axis,
virtually identical, the extremes of cold, Saturn?s inclination similar to
that of Mars in his glacial period, their states are identical. And as
the orbits of their satellites are inclined to the ecliptic, as that of the
Moon, so that when Jupiter and Saturn acquire inclinations similar
to that of the Earth, their satellites will be to them in positions cor-
responding to that of jthe moon to the Earth, the orbits of the satellites
of Saturn must be also fixed like those of Jupiter, and thus in the
sub-stage of Jupiter and Saturn the orbits are fixed in the positions


in which the satellites will revolve as moons in the succeeding opaque
stage, and not share in the subsequent changes of inclination of
axis of their primaries. And this is still further confirmed by the
Moon not sharing in the Earth?s changes of inclination of axis, as her
matter was detached in the sub-stage of Jupiter and Saturn, in which
the orbits of satellites are fixed, and therefore all such relations between
the Earth and moon ceased on her matter being detached.
As the exterior planets, equal in matter, pass through the sub-stages,
in equal periods of time, the periods of Jupiter and Saturn by coinci-
dence equal to that of either Uranus or Neptune, so they pass similarly
through them, as evidenced by tbe ring process, commencing in
Uranus, to effect the coincidence of his habitable state, with the incan-
descent sub-stage of Jupiter and of Saturn, near the termination of the
same ring process, effecting his coincidence with Jupiter, and there-
fore the coincidence of their habitable states with the incandescent
sub-stage of the inner planets; and as the orbit* of the Moon and of
the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn correspond in inclination to the
ecliptic, and the satellites of Uranus, on his acquiring the inclination of
axis of Saturn, resume their direct motions, and a corresponding inclina-
tion of orbit to the ecliptic ; the satellite of the Earth and those of
these three planets ; and therefore those of Neptune are detached in
inclinations of axes of their primaries similar to that of Saturn ; and
as Jupiter, differing only in the absence of rings, in passing into his
present sub-stage resumed the inclination of Saturn ; and his satellites,
resuming their direct motion, had their orbits fixed, as they have
not shared in his change from that to his present inclination and as
Saturn resumed his inclination, and his sate lites thereby resuming their
direct motions had their orbits fixed all planets in the sub-stage
of Saturn resume his inclination of axis, being that in which their
satellites were detached, and the sub-stage that in which satellites
acquire their direct motions and their orbits are fixed and in the same
sub-stage the matter of the moon is detatched from the earth with
a similar inclination of axis and her orbit fixed.
As the state of the matter out of which the solar system has been
constructed is dearly shown to have been a vast rotating nebulous mass
similar to an irresovlable nebula by the motions of planets, asteroids
and satellites, being in the same direction, by their orbits nearly circular
and nearly in the same plane; and by their rotations and that of the
Sun being similar, the former in the direction of their orbital motions
round the Sun and therefore the latter in the direction of his orbital
motion ai?ound Sirius, the dividing and sub-dividing of this nebulous
mass into planets of the requisite number and sizes and the placing
of them in the requisite positions corresponding to their sizes and the
superadding to their normal sizes of the matter requisite for satellites
can differ in no way from the detaching from the smaller but precisely
similar rotating nebulous mass which every planet becomes of the
amount of matter necessary to reduce it to the proper size, and from
the dividing of this detached matter into satellites of the requisite
number and amounts, and from the placing of them in their usual
positions. Thus the stage of irresolvable nebulse, in which the matter,
heat, and elements of planets are equally diffused, is the primal state of
the matter out of which the solar every system, the Universe as all are


composed of the same matter have been constructed, and this great
primal act, since which the solar system may have been millions of
itmes a nebulous star, is repeated in every circulation of the stages in
detaching and restoring to order the confused matter of planets and of
their satellites.
Hence the satellites of the exterior planets have atmospheres and
elements like planets and similarly rotate and revolve, and therefore
their surfaces on cooling down to the state of the moon, so that their
? sea-bottoms ? may be occupied by their waters, are similarly reduced
to the state of the Earth, and the rapidity with which this is effected,
in planets is clearly indicated by the velocity with which the elements
are seen to rush over the surface of Jupiter, not yet sufficiently
cooled to be occupied by his waters.
And as the layers of the Sun keep separate in the first stage, the
nebulous asteroids of the zodiacal and other zones keep separate
in the second stage, the inner planets and asteroids keep separate in
the last stage and the exterior planets and asteroids keep separate in
the intermediate stages, planets, and asteroids, like systems themselves
keep separate in all the stages, and ? continue this day, as they were
created perfect in number, measure, and weight,? and therefore, the only
confusion that can possibly take place in the Universe is that of satellites,
which must in the first stage necessarily blend with their primaries.
Asevery planetin the sub-stageof Saturn resumes his inclination ofaxis
being that in which its satellites were detached, andlihe sub-stages that in
which they resume their directmotions, andtheirorbitsarefixedso in the
succeeding sub-stage, every planet is assigned a similar series of four
inclinations of axis, to which correspond the series of four inclinations
to and from the Sun which the Earth?s inclination of axis in her revo-
lution resumes every year, and to which are due the four seasons,
which are therefore yearly I?spetitions of those four great seasons ?the
Northern tropical, pre-glacial, glacial, and post glacial periods, which
comprise long equal periods of time corresponding to mass.
As summer results from the inclination of the earth?s axis becoming
in her revolution inclined to the utmost towards the Sun, and winter
from becoming inclined to the utmost in the opposite direction from
the sun, and autumn and spring �*.from the mean of these inclinations
the northern tropical period, w. the great summer resulted from an
actual change of axis to the utmost in the same direction towards the
Sun and the glacial winter from an actual change of inclination in the
opposite direction similar to that of Mars, and the pre-glacial and the
post-glacial periods from the mean of those inclinations corresponding
therefore to autumn and spring.
Hence Jupiter and Saturn, when the inner planets become incan-
descent layers, will commence their great summer, their northern tro-
pical period with cloudy atmospheres, like those of the p'anets of
Sirius, and with inclination of axes, the mean of their present, as that
inclination only can present their northern regions to the utmost
towards the inner planets, their source of light and heat j and as Saturn
and Jupiter, in their glacial periods, -will resume their present inclina-
tions corresponding to that of Mars, the mean of these and of the
northern tropical inclination will be that of their pre-glacial and
post-glacial inclination, the earth?s present inclination.


Thus to the planets of every system in the last and preceding sub-
stages is assigned a similar series of five inclinations of axis, from
which result a corresponding series of states in the first of which the
protozoic period are Jupiter and Saturn; in the second ?the northern
tropical period ?is the last zone of planets of Sirius in their cloudy
atmospheres?no planets are known to be in the third ?the pre-glacial
period in the fourth, the glacial are Mars and Mercury; and in the
fifth, the post-glacial, the Earth and Yenus.
Thus at the present time, the only habitable planets in the solar
system are the Earth and Venus, and therefore in the system on
the inner borders of the zone corresponding to the solar system
on the outer, there are only the corresponding Earth and Venus
habitable, so that as the last zone of planets of Sirius is in the northern
tropical period, only some planets of the smaller systems on his
borders down to the zone of small solar systems can be in a habitable
state as the systems smaller than the solar system ; the binary
systems now exhibiting the phenomena of variable stars are only
passing into the stage of Sirius, so that the only habitable planets in
the Universe at the present time are a few planets of the smaller
systems on the borders of Sirius, and four planets in the zone of solar
systems.
The spreading out of the matter of Saturn in rings to cool the
adjustment of planets in sizes corresponding to their positions &c.,
demonstrate that matter and heat are employed in the structure of
the Universe as on the Earth by human beings, and therefore their
properties are unalterable.
And as matter and heat are in similar proportions in the smaller as
in the larger systems, and can never vary in their respective amounts,
and as all systems similarly cool down from a nebulous star so the
heat thus radiated, must be similarly restored, and as its restoration
takes place at vast intervals of time, and in definite amounts corre-
sponding to the matter in each planet and zone of planets, the heat
radiated from every system can recede only to a certain distance, where
it is stored, and thence withdrawn as required. For that heat cannot
be made to apply itself in requisite amounts any more than matter
can be made to detach itself in requisite amounts is clearly manifested
in the solar system. Sir J. Herschel states that in the Earth?s
orbit alone 75,000 such earths placed side by side would be equally
well warmed and lighted, and Mr. Lockyer says : ?If the Sun?s light
and heat were divided into two thousand and twenty-seven million
parts, we only receive one of them.?
Heat then cannot be made to apply itself in amounts requisite to
warm and light each planet; still less to restore itself in definite amounts
at vast intervals of time, and as all this superabundant heat must be
restored, it evidently must be stored on the confines of the system till
required, and its restoration in every instance must be a special act.
And as matter and heat are unalterable in their properties, the
application of fuel on Earth must be attended with results and
phenomena, in some degree corresponding to those which follow from
the application of heat in the universe. If all the fuel requisite to
reduce a mass of iron to fusion be applied at once, the heat generated
by spreading in all directions must fail in its purpose, whereas, applied


m smaller amounts at definite intervals of time, it succeeds. Similarly
if the heat requisite to reduce the central planet of a binary system to
the state of a sun or the zones of planets of the larger systems to
incandescent layers be applied at once, it must fail in effecting its
purpose by spreading in all directions and necessarily to the next
planet, or zone of planets.
Hence, m reducing a planet or zone of planets to fusion, the necessary
heat must be applied in smaller amounts at successive intervals of time.
And as on the application of fuel at definite intervals of time the flame
suddenly blazes up and gradually subsides, so on the application of heat
to the central planet of a binary system in smaller amounts at definite
intervals of time the flame suddenly expands and gradually subsides?
P h . enomena the binary system?variable stars on the borders
ot Sinus are now exhibiting and which the binary systems on the
borders of the zone of solar systems will exhibit when the opake stage
has advanced accordingly in the solar system. And as the phenomena
are similar, the heat is similar stored in its primal state in the one
and in the fuel of the other.
As then the light of the Sun and that of a kerosene lamp arc
indentical, and the glass chimney intensifies the light of the lamp the
Layers encircling must similarly intensify the light and heat of the sun.
The layers of the Sun, the first sub-stage, as they must be similar to the
layers of the planets, in the other sub-stages of the nebulous star are
planets, differing only in stage from the other planets as the nebulous
asteroids on its borders differ only in stage from the asteroids on the
borders of the other sub-stages. And as the layers of the planets
revolve around the first sub-stage, those of the exterior planets
rotating along in their orbits, like vast wheels upwards of eight
hundred thousand miles in diameter, they must be more or less
perpendicular to the ecliptic as the layers of the sun revolve around
the kernel perpendicular to the ecliptic and as the first sub-stage is
now near its close the diametors of its layers and of those of the
other sub-stages must be much greater in a nebulous star.
And as the layers of the first sub-stage, the Sun, are separated by
?Ten Thousand Miles/? and the layers of the other sub-stages by
millions, a nebulous star is disc-shaped, and therefore the first sub-
stage the Sun is similarly shaped, somewhat flat to the north and south
of the equator, from which the heat chiefly issues, as evidenced by the
asteroidal zones on the equators of the sub-stages. The heat then
radiated from a system in cooling down, from a nebulous star must be
re--tored through the kernel to the north and south of the equator,
whence it is expelled. The Sun then resembles a machine for
winnowing corn, the revolution of the layers expelling the heat, as the
revolution of fans expels the air, and as the air enters at the sides of
the machine so the heat enters the kernel to the north and south of
the equator.
The heat then radiated from'the equators of the Sun and of the other
sub-stages must pass to the confines of the system, and be thence
transmitted through the upper regions in amounts corresponding to
the different sized zones of planets to the kernel, the heat thus circulat-
ing as the atmosphere of the Earth circulates from the poles to the


equator, where ascending, it returns through the upper regions again
to the poles.
That the heat requisite to warm and light the inner planets thus
circulates is clearly proved by the fact ascertained by the Astronomers
Royal of England and Scotland ? that the Earth receives in some years
more heat from without than in others ? as evidently the only
appreciable heat, the earth can receive from without is through the
Sun?s equator and the only heat the Sun can receive from without is
through the kernel, and by the phenomena occasionally presented by
the Sun, and the corresponding phenomena presented by the star
which being an outlying binary system of Sirius in the direction of
Cygnus suddenly blazed up in November last to the third magnitude
and gradually disappeared, ? Eere (remarks the spectator) we find
the same elements which exist in our Sun but ordinarily in such a
condition that they partially absorb his lustre, have in the new star
been excited to so intense a degree of heat that their light is very
much stronger than that of the globe they envelope?the hydrogen
surrounding the star being not as usual, cooler than the glowing
body of the star, but hotter, and very much hotter.?
? This fact is rendered still more significant by the circumstance that
in the case of our own Sun, those same elements occasionally glow
with a heat more intense than that of the Sun?s own surface though
fortunately perhaps for us the increase of heat is only local and very
limited indeed in range.?
?We now see that suns which have unmistakably blazed out with
many times their usual degree of lustre have had the constituents of
their exterior atmosphere superheated in the same way as the
corresponding elements in the Sun?s atmosphere are occasionally
(though but locally) superheated.?
Now the only locality in which these elements of the Sun can be
thus heated to a greater degree than his surface is manifestly that of
the kernel, in which the heat enters, and which is situated in the centre
of the comparatively cooler regions, to the north and south of the
Equator which must be in the highest degree of heat, as from it the
heat must issue in the same degree of intensity at least with which it
enters the kernel as evidenced by the vast number of flakes of which
the equator consists, the invisibility thereby of the interstices &c., &c.,
and to the north and south, the small number of flakes the visibility
of the interstices the cloud of inflammable vapour floating in the Sun?s
atmosphere and flashing into flame on coming in contact with the
heat entering the kernel or issuing from the Equator as will be presently
shown.
And there being no such kernel in the star of a binary system,
which is one planet, being reduced to the state of a sun, the smaller
amounts in which the necessary heat is applied spreading over its
surface expand and gradually subside, as in fusing they blend with
its matter. And as the central planet of a binary system ?of a
Centauri equal to 7J earths is thus reduced to the state of a sun, the
planets of the zones of the solar and larger systems must be similarly
reduced to layers by applying through their kernels and equators to
each planet the necessary heat in smaller amounts corresponding to
mass.


That the interstices of the layers visible to the north and south of
the Equator are the spots, is clearly proved by all their phenomena
?which are such as necessarily follow from the interstices in the revolu-
tion of the layers round the kernel of the Sun, ? their sudden opening
closing periodically,? ? the regular occurrence of the same phenomena
in the same latitudes and in the same manner, ? &c. &c.
That the red flames are portions of inflammable vapour, ascending
from the interstices on the borders of the Equator, and by its more
intense heat maintained in continual flame, is clearly indicated by the
more distant portions of this inflammable vapour ascending and collect-
ing into large masses or clouds, which floating in the Sun?s atmosphere
flash into detached flame on coming in contact with the intense heat
issuing from the equator, or entering the kernel.
With respect to this cloud and the five bright columns on which it
seems usually suspended, Mr. Proctor remarks ??I know no better way
of describing the appearance of this object than by comparing it to what
may be seen at night in the neighbourhood of Sheffield, and elsewhere
in the midland regions, when enormous chimneys pour fourth masses
of smoke in the air, the issuing smoke being intensely illuminated by
the gloving fires beneath, while there hangs a vast mass of smoke over
the whole district illuminated (but far less intensely) by the fiery
columns which seem to stand above the furnaces.
How apt is shis illustration as the cloud is the inflamable vapour
ascending from the intersticies and, ?the five bright vertical columns?
portions of the vapour more intensely illuminated by the glare issuing
from the glowing mass beneath, through the interstices of the layers
thus indicated to be five at least, the equivalents of the five equal
portions?the four exterior planets and the zone of inner planets into
which the matter assigned for planets was sub-divided.
Irruptions and outbursts to which the flashing into flame of this
vast cloud was supposed to be due must be wholly impossible in the
homogenous incandescent layers of the sun separated by at least
? Ten Thousand Miles. ?
As portions of these circular layers must project above, the Sun?s
surface and cause great inequalities, elevations, depressions, and
different inclinations of surface the crests of the projections and eleva-
tions must be the faeulse and the depressions and different inclinations
of surface cause the mottled appearance. The period of rotation
assigned to the Sun being deduced from the sp >ts which are the
interstices of the layers is therefore the period of revolution of the
layers around the kernel, the periods of the outer layers longer than
those of the inner, as the periods of revolution of the exterior planets are
longer than those of the inner; for the rotation of the kernel in the
highest degree of heat is most rapid.
With respect to Mr. Masmyth's discovery, Sir J. Herschel remarks.
? The bright surface of the Sun consists of separate insulated individual
objects or things, all nearly or exactly of one certain definite size and
shape, which is more like that of a willow leaf, as he describes them,
than anything else. These leaves, or scales, are not arranged in any
order (as those on a butterfly?s wing are) but lie crossing one another
in all directions, like what are called spills in the game of spillikins,
except at the borders of a spot where they point for the most part


inwards towards the middle of the spot, presenting much the sort
of appearance the small leaves of some water plants or sea weeds do on
the edge of a deep hole of clear water.? ? The exceedingly definite
shape of these objects ?their exact similarity one to another, and the
way in which they lie across and athwart each other (except where
they form a sort of bridge across a spot, in which case they seem to
affect a common direction namely that of the bridge itself) all these
characters seem quite repugnant to the notion of their being of a
vaporous, a cloudy, or a fluid nature. Nothing remains but to consider
them as separate and independent sheets, flakes, or scales, having some
sort of solidity and the immediate source of the solar light and heat.?
As the heat issues chiefly from the equators of the Sun and of the
sub-stages, and the rotation of the incandescent layers of planets most
rapid, the flakes are portions of those layers detached from their
peripheries by their very rapid rotation on their axes; and their greater
number on the equator results from its greater heat, as all the characters
thus shown to pertain to follow necessarily from them, having been
thus detached the similarity in size and oval shape, their positions on
the Equator?crossing each other in all directions and to its north and
south, their common direction projecting from the peripheries of the
layers towards the middle of the interstices forming bridge like
appearances from layer to layer.
Somewhat as from the wheels of a carriage in rapid motion the
mud is precipitated in nearly equal shapes and sizes, and in a
common direction, and if the motion of the carriage be in a circle, the
direction in which the mud is precipitated at one extremity of its
diameter is the reverse of its direction at the other. Similarly the
direction of the flakes on one side of the sun is the reverse of their
direction at the opposite, so that in the flakes thus detached from the
peripheries of the layers of the Sun by their rapid rotation, we see, the
state of the peripheries of the layers of the planets and the mode is
indicated in which the similar flakes were detached and have acquired
their retrograde and direct motions which we see in Comets and Meteors,
and therefore those flakes have become Comets and the matter of
Comets has become Meteors.
The vast number of flakes of which the bright surface of the Sun?s
Equator consists, and by which the interstices become invisible on the
Equator, and the inflammable vapour ascending on its borders and
maintained in continual flames, as they result from, bear testimony to the
heat issuing chiefly from the equator as the small number of flakes to
its north and south ?the visibility of the interstices and the cloud of
inflammable vapour floating in the Sun?s atmosphere as they result
from bear testimony to the small amount of heat to its north and south.
The existence, too, of this cloud, is conclusive evidence of the red flames
being situated only on the borders of the equator as the visibility of the
red flames seen in total solar eclipses encircling the entire body of the
Sun, is conclusive evidence of the Sun being flat to the north and south
of the Equator for if the Sun had north and south poles, like planets, the
red flames could not be thus seen.
That comets are portions of the incandescent layers of the planets
detached in flakes by their rapid rotation, is clearly proved by all the
characters which distinguish them from the other members of the


system, necessarily following therefrom. Their orbits more or less
perpendicular to the ecliptic?? cutting across the ecliptic at every
possible angle? prove that they have appertained to the layers of the
planets which, like the similar layers of the Sun, were more or less
perpendicular to the ecliptic, and their retrograde and direct motions
are additional evidence as the matter of a comet detached on one side of
those vast layers, and in one portion of their orbit must have a motion
the reverse of that detached at the opposite side of the layer and
in the opposite side of the orbit.
And that Meteors are the remnants of comets at perihelia follows
as necessarily as that comets are the remnants of the incandescent
layers of the planets?? The intimate corellations between comets,
shooting stars, and meteorites are now placed beyond doubt. Hundreds
of analyses by the most eminent chemists prove that meteorites contain
no simple body unknown to our globe. There have been recognised
with certainly twenty-two elements. It is a very curious fact that the
three bodies which predominate in nearly every meteorite iron silicon
and oxygen are those which predominate on the Earth.?
Hence, in the incandescent state of comets at perihelia, their matter
passes into a state of vapour which, as Sir J. Herschel says ? is always
driven back from the sun, so as to make it clear that the tail is
neither more or less than the accumulation of this luminous vapour,?
which condenses into meteors, which follow abreast on the outside of
the comet?s orbit to the extent in which at perihelia their matter was
? driven back from the Sun,? and as this extent or breadth of meteors
must necessarily diminish gradually to disappearance as they and
the comet recede from the sun, there thus arise the various breadths of
meteors traversed by the earth in different years. Hence meteors, like
comets, must be both retrograde and direct in their motions, and
comets at every perihelion acquire a new tail of similar matter.
And as the matter of comets thus diminishes at every perihelion,
those comets which are found to be ? bunches of thin levitating
vapour? must have become so by frequent perihelia, so that the comets
which pertained to the incandescent layers of the inner planets must
by frequent perihelia have passed into the meteors, which abound in
the inter-planatory spaces.
Meteors, then, have appertained to comets, and comets to the incan-
descent layers of the planets; and as the meteors of comets pertaining
to every planet in the system may, through the eccentricity of their
orbits, come in contact with the Earth, a specimen may thus be ob-
tained of the matter of every planet in the system, and as the matter
of meteors, so the matter of every planet in the system is similar to
that of the Earth as is the matter of the layers of the Sun ?? as light
which to us is the sole evidence of the distant worlds, of the visible
Universe, tells us also that each of them is built of molecules of the
same kind as those which we find in the Earth.?
Thus, the oblateness of planets, the asteroidal zones, comets, and
meteors, are as conclusive evidence of -the solar system having been a
nebulous star as are the remains of tropical animals in northern
regions evidence of the climate of those regions having been tropical,
the great northern summer of the Earth.
With respect to the zodiacal light, Mr. Proctor says : ? the remark*


able phenomena presented by the zodiacal light: its strangely fluctuating
figure, its varying position, and the singular increase and diminution,
noticed us its distinctions are not accounted for by any of those
theories.? ? A multitude of bodies travelling in every degree of
elipticity and magnitude, but with a marked aggregation in the neigh-
bourhood of the Sun, and with a yet more marked aggregation in the
neighbourhood of the medeal plane of the solar system would exhibit
precisely such an appearance as the zodiacal light.? How accurate a
description do we now find this to be of the circulation of the nebulous
asteroids of the zodiacal zone, whereby the modification of the light
and heat of the sun is effected, and therefore, occasional and periodi-
cal increase, and diminution of the sun?s light and heat may result
from a less or greater number of interviewing asteroids. Professor
Chalis thus describes the corona. ? The corona seems to consist for
the most part of large pointed masses of light stretched to very unequal
lengths from the different parts of the sun?s circumference. The
absence of all regularity, symmetry, and constancy in this light seems
wholly irreconcileable with its being due to reflection from the Sun?s
atmosphere.? Mr. Baxendell says : ? Recent observations and dis-
coveries very clearly indicate that the corona is not an appendage of
the Sun, but an irregular nebulous ring of small bodies circulating
about the Sun, nearly in the plane of the eliptic, and at a mean dis-
tance of 0,169 or about fifteen millions miles, and that the reflection of
the Sun?s light from the matter of this ring, may be the cause of the
appearance of the corona in total solar eclipses.? On this, ? the
Student? remarks. ?It is remarkable this is the very distance which
Le Vender considers the most probable as that of the intra-mercurial
ring of small bodies of which he has shown the existence by
means of perturbations produced on the planet Mercury.? ? These
investigations cannot but be considered as in some degree confirm-
tory of each other.?
As every zone of systems in the Universe is represented with the
utmost precision, in each system there can be no zone of bodies
between the Sun and inner planets, other than the counterparts of
the smaller systems on the borders of Sirius, the nebulous asteroids
of the zodiacal zone which as its purpose is to deflect the light and
heat of the sun must be the cause oi the zodiacal and coronal lights,
and therefore, the coronal is the zodiacal light seen more distinctly in
total solar eclipses.
As the layers of the Sun and of the planets in the sub-stages of a
nebulous star transmit the light and heat, and the asteroids compound
of the same matter on becoming nebulous on tbe borders of the sub-
stages deflect the light and heat, the latter must result from the
nebulous stage.
As matter and heat are in corresponding proportions, in every sys-
tem, and can never vary in their respective amounts and systems are
similarly constructed out of the same matter, passing through the same
process, similar in each stage, and differing only in size; and as all the
heat pertaining to a system is restored in the stage of a nebulous star,
which becomes an irresolvable nebula, the primal state of matter
and heat, by all its heat being blended with its matter as an irresolv-
able becomes a resolvable, nebula by its inner planets first


ftnd then its larger exterior planets, parting with their heat
and becoming free from nebulosity, a nebulous star, in which
all its heat is being blended with its matter, as evidenced
by the nebulous appendage, and an irresolvable nebula, in which
all its heat is blended with its matter, cannot radiate heat,
and therefore, the sub-stages must cease radiation on the system
becoming a nebulousstar 5 and thus resolvable nebulee Milky Way,
and solar systems are the cooling down stages. And since an irresolv-
able nebula cannot radiate heat, it cannot any more than a dense cloud
transmit heat, and therefore, Venus and Mercury, by their smaller
sizes and proximity to the zodiacal zone, may be as effectually screened
from the intense light and heat of the sun, as the Earth and Mars by
distance.
As the Earth and Venus are double the size, and their periods there-
fore, double those of Mars and Mercury, these commenced their proto-
zoic periods with the Earth and Venus; commencing the latter half of
their pre-glacial periods and their present glacial periods with the Earth
and Venus; commencing their present post-glacial periods, and there-
fore their post-glacial periods will be coincident with the latter half of
the post-glacial periods of the Earth and Venus. Jupiter and Saturn,
each equal to the four inner planets and quadruple their periods,
commenced their protozoic periods with the Earth and Venus com-
mencing theirs, and will terminate their protozoic with the inner
planets, terminating their post-glacial the last of the five periods, and
commence their northern tropical periods, in cloudy atmospheres, with
the inner planets becoming the second sub-stage of the nebulous star, as
the last zone of planets of Sirius has since the second century commenced
their northern tropical periods in similar cloudy atmospheres coinci-
dently with the succeeding zone becoming the corresponding last
sub-stage of the nebulous star.
And as all the periods of a planet are equal in length, which cor-
responds to its mass, and the four exterior planets equal in matter as
the protozoic period of Jupiter and Saturn is coincident with all the
periods of the Earth and Venus, so the protozoic period of Uranus
equal to, is coincident with the post-glacial of Jupiter and Saturn, and
the protozoic of Neptune, equal to, is coincident with the post-glacial
of Uranus, and therefore, the sub-stages of the last stage, and conse-
quently the coresponding sub-stages of the first stage in the three
exterior zones are quadruple the periods of the first sub-stage of the
last stage in the first zone, and equal to the periods of the second
sub-stage of the first stage in the first zone, which illuminates the
northern tropical pre-glacial glacial and post-glacial periods of Jupiter
and Saturn.
. ? 8 ,^ e rs *i Bu b-stage of the last stage in the first zone, is one
fourth of the periods of the sub-stages of the last in the three exterior
zones by the inner planets being thus adjusted in sizes and positions,
the correspondence in length of the second sub-stage of the first stage
in the first zone, to that of the sub-stages of the first and last stages in the
exterior zones can result only from a special application of the requisite
heat as heat, cannot be made to apply itself in definite amounts at
definite periods of time.
As Sirius, like the sun illuminating the inner planets, was in the first


sub-stage of the first stage illuminating his inner planets in the corres*
ponding first sub-stage of the last stage, and has become by his zones of
planets successively becoming the corresponding sub-stages of the first
and last stages, the last sub-stage of the first illuminating his last zone
of planets, in the corresponding last sub-stage of the last stage he must
have been in the time o Horner in which he was so remai table
for brightness near the close of the fourth sub-stage of the first stage ;
and the zone of planets he illuminated near the close of
the corresponding fourth sub-stage of the last stage and his last
zone of planets as near the close of the protozoic period
which was coincident with the post-glacial of the succeeding zone,
since in the second century of our era he was?as evidenced by his
remarkable redness in the transition state ?from the fourth to his
present fifth and last sub-stage of the first illuminating his last zone
of planets in the corresponding last sub-stage of the last stage.
And as the protozoic period of Jupiter and Saturn and the
post-glacial of the inner planets terminate together, and Jupiter and
Saturn commence their northern tropical period coincidently with the
inner planets becoming the second sub-stage of the nebulous star, so
the protozoie period of the last zone of planets of Sirius and the post-
glacial of the succeeding zone terminated together, and the last zone
commenced the northern tropical period coincidently with the succeed-
ing zone becoming the fifth sub-stage of the nebulous star; and thus
Sirius commenced since the second century the last sub-stage of the
first stage coincidently with his last zone of planets, still in the cloudy
atmospheres of the preceding protozoic period commencing their
northern tropical period.
Hence Jupiter and Saturn will commence their northern tropical
periods v ith their present cloudy atmospheres coincedently with the
inner planets becoming the second sub-stage of the first for their
illumination, and thus the advance of the opaqe stage in the planets of
Sirius corresponds to its advance in the zones of planets of the solar
system.
As the sub-stages of the first and last stages have thus passed from the
centre to the borders of Sirius, and have commenced to pass similarly
through the solar system, they must pass similarly through every
system, and therefore every system must be constructed similarly and
like the universe through which the stages pass similarly?every system
being in the minutest details the counterpart of the Universe and
therefore of each other, differing only in size.
As the Universe consists of Sirius, of the smaller systems, on his
borders of the zone of small solar systems, and of the smaller brinary
system, on its borders constituting the centre, and of the four exterior
zones of systems with binary systems, on their borders, so every
system consists of its sun, the counterpart of Sirius of the as-
teroids on its borders, the counterparts of the smaller systems on his
borders?of the zone of inner planets, and of the asteroids on its
borders, counterparts of the zone of solar systems, and of the binary
systems on its borders, constituting its centre, and the larger systems of
four exteriorzones of planets and asteroids on their borders, counter-
parts of the four exterior zones of systems and binary systems on their
borders, and the small solar system of three exterior zones of planets


and the yet smaller binary system of Sun and one planet, counterparts
of Sirius and of the zone of solar systems. And as the zone of solar
systems is coincident in the opaque stage with the last zone of planets
of Sirius, and becomes nebulous stars together with Sirius, so their
counterparts, the inner planets of every system, are in their opaque stage
coincident with the last period of the Sun becoming together with the
Sun the second sub-stage of the nebulous star. As the stages pass
from the centre to the borders of the Universe?the first stage ever
following the last, which is ever becoming the first?so the sub-stages
pass from the centre to the borders of systems the sub-stages of the
first following and illuminating the sub-stages of the last, which become
the corresponding sub-stages of the first.
As the mean of the sizes of Mars and Mercury is their normal
size, which is half the normal size of the Earth and Venus, the mean
of their sizes, so the mean of the sizes of a Centauri the counterpart of
Mars and of the system on the inner borders of the zone, the counter-
part of Mercury is their normal size, half of the normal size of the
solar system, the counterpart of the Earth and of the system on the
inner borders the counterpart of Venus which is the mean of their
sizes ; and therefore the four systems composing the zone, like the four
inner planets, are coincident in their last periods, and terminate the
stage of the zone at the same time. And as the last zone of planets of
Sirius and the zone of solar systems are coincident in-the opaque stage,
and the protozoic period of the first of his four exterior zones of planets
is coincident with all the periods of his inner, as the protozoic of
Jupiter and Saturn is coincident with all the periods of the inner, the
periods of Sirius, and therefore of each leading system in the four
exterior zones, are quadruple the periods of the zone of solar systems.
Thus the zone of inner planets equal to three Earths, is one fourth
of the periods of each of the four exterior planets, and the zone of solar
systems equal to three solar system is one fourth of (he periods of each
leading system in the four exterior zones and of Sirius, and therefore
the inner planets are one-fourth the periods of the Sun, and coincident
in the opaque stage with his last period as the zone of solar systems is
coincident in the opaque stage with the last period of Sirius, his last
zone of planets.
As the Earth and Venus are each normally equal to Mars and
Mercury, or to two normal-sized Mars or Mercuries, and Jupiter and
Saturn each normally equal to the inner planets, or to three normal-
sized Earths, so Uranus is equal to the normal size of Jupiter or Sa-
turn, and Neptune to Uranus j for as the three exterior zones are in the
immediate preceding sub-stages of the inner planets, when Jupiter
and Saturn cool down to the sub-stage of the inner, Uranus will have
cooled down to the substage of Jupiter, and Saturn and Neptune to
that of Uranus, and thus the periods of these three zones in each sub-
stage is equal the poriod of Uranus, equal to that of Jupiter, and
Saturn coincident in period, and the period of Neptune equal to that
of Uranus j and therefore those four exterior planets are normally equal
in matter, and each equal to that of the inner planets.
And as the five stages of the process terminate coincidently in the
five zones of systems of the Universe, the smaller systems like, the
smaller planets on the inner and outer borders of their zones, half the


size, and therefore their stages half the length of those of the larger,
commencing when they will terminate the stage at the same time with
the larger, the period of each stage in each exterior zone of systems is
equal as the periods of each sub-stage in each exterior zone is equal;
and as the leading exterior planets are equal in matter, the leading
systems in the exterior zones of the Universe consist like Sirius, of four
zones of exterior planets, of which each leading planet is equal to each
leading planet in the four exterior zones of Sirius, and therefore equal
to all the planets in the zone of solar systems.
It follows that the leading exterior planets of Sirius and of the
leading exterior systems are each equal to its inner planets, to the
planets of the zone of solar systems, and to each exterior layer of its
sun, for as the leading planets of the leading systems of the exterior
zones have their equivalent in the leading planets of Sirius, of which
every sun is the counterpart, the planets of Sirius and of every system
have their equivalents in their suns as every system is the counterpart
of the Universe.
Thus the amount? of matter in each leading exterior planet of each
leading system is adjusted in its inner planets, so that their periods
are one-fourth of its periods; and in the planets of the zone of solar
systems, so as to be equal in period, the former passing through the
habitable state in one-fourth of the time, and the latter in the same
time required by the same amount of matter in one body; and
evidently on these properties of matter and heat, so much employed,
the Universe is mainly constructed.
And as the leading exterior planets of the four exterior zones of
systems and the planets of the zone of solar systems have thus their
equivalents in the leading exterior planets, and in the inner planets of
Sirius, the corresponding five equal subdivisions of the planets of the
solar system, the four exterior and the zone of inner planets, their
counterparts have their equivalents in the Sun, the counterpart of
Sirius, and therefore the layers of the Sun, of which Sir J. Herschel
discovered ? three at least, ? but which are clearly shown by ? the five
bright columns on which the cloud floating in the Sun?s atmosphere
seems suspended,? to be five at least, corresponding to the five equal
subdivisions of the planets, are their equivalents. And as the zone of
inner, and the leading exterior planets of Sirius are each equal in
matter to that of all the planets of the zone of solar systems, so the
five layers of the sun are each equal in matter to that of the zone of
inner, and to that of each extenor planet.
Thus the five equal subdivisions of the planets of the solar system
have their layers in the Sun, equal in matter, and similar to those, they
will become, when the system is a nebulous star ; and each of the five
subdivisions being equal to three earths, the Sun is equal in matter to
fifteen earths, half the matter of the system, so that the Sun of every
system, the first sub-stage, contains half the matter of the nebulous
star the system becomes, and therefore the matter of every system has
been divided into two equal portions, its Sun and planets.
We see in the preceding stage of the Milky Way, the small binary
systems on the borders of the zone of solar systems, from the smallest
in the Swan up to a Centauri, the largest, half the size of, and
therefore next in size to the solar system, to consist each of two small


fctaM, 6qual m matter, and this principle of division into two equal
amounts is maintained in every system, as in the solar system up to,
and in Sirius, and the Universe, the layers constituting the Sun of
eveiy system, equal in matter to that of their corresponding planets
and similar to the layers, the planets will become as the Sun, the one
halt of the nebulous star is similar to the other half the planets
become. r
On this principle of division into two equal portions, the first of the
equal subdivisions of the planets of every system, except binary
systems, is again subdivided into two larger equal portions and into
two smaller, half the size of the larger, the inner planets which are
again adjusted in sizes, corresponding to position with respect to the
bun so as to be virtually equal in size and coincident, in period this
first ot the equal subdivisions by this re-subdivision, terminating when
the next subdivision containing the same amount of matter in one
body cools down to the opaque stage.
The matter of the zone of solar systems is similarly divided into two
larger equal portions, the solar on the outer, and the corresponding
system on the inner borders of the zone, and into two smaller equal
portions, half the size of the larger, a Oentauri on the outer, and the
corresponding system on the inner borders, and a Oentauri being pro-
portionally as much?larger than half the size of the solar system?as
Mars is larger than half the size of the Earth, the systems on the
mner borders correspond in sizes to those of Yenus and Mercury.
Thus, the zone of solar systems stands in relations to Sirius' and
the exterior zones of systems, precisely corresponding to those in
which the zone of inner planets stands to the Sun, and the
exterior zones of planets.
As the Sun of every system is its centre, and the counterpart of
Sinus and its zones of planets, thus so exactly the counterparts of the
zones of systems, Sirius is the centre of the Universe, and contains half
its matter, and the five zones of systems, the other half and the Sun
of Sinus being equal to his five zones of planets, contains the equiva-
lents of the suns and his five zones of planets, the equivalents of the
planets of the five zones of systems of the Universe, and therefore, the
matter of the Universe has been also divided into two equal portions,
Sinus and the five zones of systems thus subdivided into corresponding
equal portions. &
As the first zone of solar systems has, as we have seen, the equiva-
lents ot its planets in the corresponding first zone of inner planets of
Sinus, their corresponding layers in his Sun, are the equivalents of the
four suns of the zone. And as the leading exterior planets of the
leading systems of the four exterior zones have their equivalents in
the corresponding four exterior zones of planets of Sirius, so the
smaller planets have also their equivalents in the same zones, and the
suns of those four zones of systems have their equivalents in the
corresponding layers of the planets constituting the Sun of Sirius-
The capability of the exterior zones of Sirius, as well as his inner
zone, of containing the equivalents of the planets of the corresponding
zones of systems, is clearly shown in the three exterior zones of the
solar system being capable of containing a much larger number of
planets. Evidently, the three exterior zones of the solar system might,


like the zone of inner, contain each four planets?the zone of Jupiter
and Saturn, two more planets half their size, corresponding to Mars
and Mercury, and the zones of Uranus and Neptune be each similar?
the three zones thus containing twelve planets, equal in matter to
nine such planets as the four exterior. And as the last zone of Sirius
is seen to consist of five planets, different in size, which being still in
the cloudy atmospheres of the proceeding protozoic period, are much
larger than their normal size, in the succeeding periods we are led
to the conclusion that, as the three exterior zones might each consist
of five planets, by a planet the mean of the sizes occupying the mean
of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, the five planets of Sirius are thus
adjusted in his last and three proceeding ?-'ones. For as Uranus and
Neptune, each the normal size of Jupiter and Saturn, occupy the
centres of their zones, a normal-sized planet might occupy the mean
of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, seeing that these planets are
adjusted in sizes, corresponding to the distances of their orbits, from
that mean orbit, the three exterior zones thus containing fifteen planets
equal in matter to that of twelve such planets as the four exterior,
the additional planets having their corresponding layers also in the Sun.
Thus the matter of the Universe and of every system is divided into
two equal portions, which are subdivided into corresponding equal
portions, and as half the matter of each system is permanently a Sun
for the illumination of the other half, which becomes temporarily
suns to assist in its illumination ; half the matter of the Universe is
permanently Suns for the illumination of the other which
temporarily becomes similar Suns, to supplement in its illumination,
and, therefore, all the matter of the Universe is similar.
As the planets of the solar system are equal to fifteen Earths, the
planets of the zone are equal to forty-five Earths, and therefore, each
leading exterior planet of Sirius, and of the leading exterior systems
is equal to forty-five Earths, and the corresponding layers in their
Suns, each equal, therefore, to three of our Suns ; and as the four inner
are equal to each larger exterior planet, the two larger corresponding
to the Earth and Yenus, are each equal to fifteen Earths, or to the
planets of the solar system ; and the two smaller corresponding to
Mars and Mercury, each equal to seven and one-half Earths, or to the
planet of a Centauri, and the layers of the larger equal each to the
Sun, and those of the smaller, equal each to the Sun of a Centauri.
Hence the coincidence of the first sub-stage of the last stage in the
inner planets with the last period of the sun, and with the first
protozoic period of Jupiter and Saturn results from the Sun containing
five times the amount, and from Jupiter and Saturn each containing an
equal amount of matter?thus subdivided in the inner planets; and the
coincidence of the succeeding second substage of the first stage in the
inner planets, with the other four periods of Jupiter and Saturn, the
second sub-stage of the first being t!?us four times the length of the
first sub-stage of fie last in the inner planets, and equal to the sub-stage
of each exterior zone, can ) esult only from union with the Sun and
from the application of the requisite heat, which cannot be made to
apply itself in definite amounts. Thus, the opaque stage of the inner
planets is coincident with the last period of the Sun, as the smaller
systems and planets in their respective zones are coincident in their


last periods with those of the larger ; and the same opaque stage of the
inner planets is coincident with the protozoic period of Jupiter and
Saturn, as the postglacial of each succeeding zone equal to is coincident
with the >ic of the preceeling and the second sub-stage of the
first in the inner planets quadruple the length of the first sub-stage of
the last is made equal to the other sub-stages of the first in the
exterior zones by special application of the requisite heat.
In binary systems the corresponding planet being equal to the Sun
is coincident with all his periods, and not subdivided, there being no
exterior planets.
How exactly must all the vast bodies, constituting the systems
of the Universe, be adjusted in sizes and positions, that events,
separated by vast intervals of time and space events on the borders
and at the centre of the Universe, may be coincident at the exact
period of time.
The visible Universe, all its members being in the different stages
of the same process, is one system, and carnot he the only system of
its kind in infinite space, of which, vast as it is, it can only occupy a
small portion; and as the rotations of satellites and planets are in the
same direction as their orbital motions, the orbital motion of the
Sun must be in the same direction as his rotation, which is in the
same direction as that of the satellites and planets; and therefore as
planets with their satellites gyrating around them revolve in their re-
spective zones around the Sun, the Sun with the* zones of planets
gyrating around him, must revolve in the same direction around Sirius,
and Sirius, rotating, and therefore revolving in the san e direction as the
Sun, and the zones of systems of which the zones of planets are the
counterparts?the visible Universe gyrating around him, revolves
around his centre of gravity comprised in a vast system of similar
Universes in the same process and separated by distances proportional
to their vastness, the visible Universe occupying a position similar to
that of a system in the Universe.
The revolutions of the zones of systems thus around Sirius must be
attended with phenomena corresponding to those which follow from
the revolutions of their counterparts, the zones of planets around the
Sun. As the visible Universe is disc-shaped like the solar system, the
binary systems on the borders of the zone of solar systems must be
more numerous than those on the borders of Sirius as the asteroids,
their counterparts on the borders of the zone of inner planets are as
evidenced by their purpose ?that of deflecting the light an'l heat more
numerous than the nebulous asteroids on the borders of the Sun, so
the binary systems on the borders of the Milky Way, now bri?liant
little stars must be more numerous than those on the borders of the
zone of solar systems, and the binary systems on the borders of
resolvable, and binary nebulae onthe borders of irresolvable nebulae still
more numerous corresponding to their greater orbit.
And as in the solar system there may be a greater accumulation of
planets asteriods, &c., on one side of the Sun than on another, so there
may he a greater accumulation of syslems, binary systems, planets,
asteroids, &c., one side of the Universe than on another.
That the crowded and irregular appearance of the Milky Way result
from this accumulation on one side of the Universe of systems, binary


systems,planets, satellites, asleriods, &c., all incandescent like ?glitter-
ing dust ? is clearly proved by the fact that there can be no small
brilliant stars, ? glittering dust? out of the zone of the Milky Way,
nor can there be beyond the zone of resolvable nebulae any stars other
than the remote nebulous stars ; and by the following remarks of Sir J,
Herschel which are an accurate description of what must result from
the accumulation in the Milky Way of systems, planets,
asteroids, &c., incandescent. ? Beyond the limits of unaided vision
telescopes extend the range of visibility and magnitudes from the
eighth to the sixteenth are familiar to those who are in the practice of
using powerful instruments, nor does these seem the least reason to
assign a limit to this progression : every increase in the power and
dimensions of instruments, which successive improvements in optical
science have attained, having brought into view multitudes innumer-
rable of objects invisible before, so that for anything experience has
hitherto taught us the number of the stars may be really infinite in
the only sense in which we can assign a meaning to the word.? Sir
J. 11. also says : ?In those regions in which the Milky Way is clearly
resolved into stars well separated, and seen projected on a black ground,
and where by consequence it is certain, we look out beyond them into
space, the smallest visible stars appear as such not by reason of exces-
sive distance, but of a real inferiority of size and brightness.?
Hence binary systems on the borders of the Milky Way diminish in
size like the binary systems on the borders of the zone of solar systems
and like the asteroids on the borders of the inner planets, and therefore
all binary systems and their counterparts ?the asteroids on the borders
of their respective zones?similarlv diminish in size. As, then, the
crowded appaarance of the Milky Way results from the accumulation
of those innumerable incandescent bodies on one side of the Universe,
the vacuities result from their coincidence in position.
The causes of these phenomena in the Milky Way must produce
similar phenomena in the other zones, the northern cluster of nebulae
and the southern clusters, the Magellanic clouds. A cluster in the
zone of Milky Way and one in that of resolvable nebulae intervening
in the view of a large cluster in the zone of irresolvable nebulae, would
cause the apparent intermixture in the nubeculae of nebulae and stars,
and this is confirmed by no systems in the zone of Milky Way and
resolvable nebulae intervening in the view of the northern cluster.
For as the visible Universe is one of many similar Universes in the
same process separated by vast distances, there cannot possibly be seen,
any system which does not pertain to the visible Universe, nor can
there be a system in a stage out of the zone, in which that stage is;
for of the five stages occupying the five zones of the Universe,
and terminating coincidently in each zone, four being successive
lower degrees of heat than that of the first stage, the stage in the
higher ever becoming the immediate lower, and the lowest imme-
diately followed by ever becoming the highest degree of heat these
successive lower degrees of heat ?the stages can never any more than
the zones of systems vary in their relative positions.
That every Universe in this vast system of Universes is similar to the
visible Universe, similarly constituted out of the same matter, passing
through the same process, and similarly revolving around its centre of


gravity comprised in it, is clearly indicated by every member of the
visible Universe being constructed out of the same matter similar to it,
and therefore to each other, passing through the different stages of
the same process, and similarly revolving around Sirius ; its centre of
gravity, as evidenced by the rotation of the sun being in the same
direction as that of the planets, and therefore the rotation and revo-
lution of every sun and planet, and of the Universe, must be similar,
as all have been similarly constructed out of the same rotating
nebulous mass. 6
Hence the systems composing every Universe are similar to it, to
each other, and to the systems composing the visible Universe to
which every member is similar, and therefore their systems and
planets are in corresponding sizes and positions, and their matter and
heat in corresponding amounts; and in the last stage the planets pass
through the similar series of inclinations of axes, and of states
resulting therefrom.
And as every planet in the molten state passes through a similar
series of inclinations of axis, the seas of molten matter on every planet
must be similar in position, differing only in extent, and therefore
the positions of the seas and oceans of which the molten seas become
the beds, must be similar on every planet; and consequently the con-
tinents must be similar in position, and differ only in extent.
The consequents of these similar antecedents on every planet must
be similar to their consequents on the earth, similar seas and conti-
nents, similar animals and plants, and the position of the human
animal similar to his position on earth, the state of everything a
repetition of the past.
As the process is ever repeating itself in the Universe, which is ever
the same, differing only in the positions of the stages, so the stages are
ever repeating themselves in every planet, which is ever the same,
differing only in stage.
The state of every planet in every stage is an accurate repetition of
its past state in the same stage, and its state in every future
recurrence of the same stage is a repetition, as are the inclinations of
axis pertaining to each stage, the series of inclinations of axis, and of
states resulting therefrom in the last stage the molten state, the
positions of the seas and continents, &c. &c., repetitions of the past.
As the layers of the planets of every system are accurate repetitions
of the layers of its Sun, and of every other Sun so the plants and
animals of every one planet, and their history, are accurate repetitions
of those of every other and of their history.
The proverb of Solomon is as true of every planet as of the earth,
? There is nothing new under the Sun; the thing that has been is that
which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done,?
And, therefore, to him who is without beginning or end of life, the end
of everything is known from the beginning its state manifest in every
phase of its existence.
We have seen that satellites necessarily blend with the incandescent
layers of their primaries at every recurrence of the first stage, that the
satellites of the exterior planets are detached in their usual number and
amounts of matter in the succeeding irresolvable stage; that the matter
of the moon is detached in the protozoic period of the Barth, the


beginning of her present opaque stage by the same ring process now in
operation in Saturn in his protozoic period; and that this blending of
satellites with primaries is the only confusion or disorder that can
possibly take place in the Universe.
We have seen that matter and heat are unalterable in their properties,
that they are employed in the Universe as on Earth by human beings
as evidenced by the matter of Saturn spread out in rings to cool ?by
the adjustment of planets in sizes corresponding to their positions with
respect to the Sun, by the application of the ring process to effect the
coincidence of the habitable states of the planets of a zone, and the
coincidence of the planets of adjoining zones in the sub-stages of the
first and last stages ; and therefore as the application of heat in the
requisite amounts at definite intervals of time to reduce a zone of
planets to fusion must in every instance be a special act, so the detach-
ing from primaries of their satellites in their usual number and amounts
of matter, and the placing of them in their usual positions must in every
instance be a special aet, as the assigning to every planet in the last
and preceding sub-stages of a similar series of five inclinations of axes
commencing with that of Saturn and ending with that of the Earth is
in every instance a special act.
This restoration to order of the confused matter of the Earth and
Moon at the beginning of the present opaque stage is the more remark-
able as it is distinctly referred to in the Mosaic account of creition.
Professor Blackie has shown that ? the proper meaning of the word
creation in the Mosaic account is the restoration to, or creation of
order out of confusion, that such only is the proper meaning of the
Hebrew word translated creation?that the whole Hebrew context
shows clearly such to be Moses? meaning, and that no word in the
Hebrew language signifies to create out of nothing, ? and certainly such
a word would be wholly inapplicable in the construction of the
Universe, in which, as we have seen ends are in every instance attained
to by means. It is, morever, admitted that the Hebrew word rendered
the ? beginning? signifies, as used in the Bible, without the article time
in general therefore the literal rendering is ? in time God restored the
heavens and the earth to order.??the heavens implying the exterior
planets first restored to order.
Since then the only disorder that can possibly take place in the
Universe is the blending of the matter of satellits with that of their
primaries in every recurrence of the first stage, and the confused
matter of the exterior planets is restored to order in the second stage,
and that of the Earth and Moon in the beginning of the last?the
present stage ?to this restoration to order only can reference be made in
the Mosaic account, and not to the first construction of the Earth out
of matter in its primal state which cannot be in disorder ; and as
reference to the first construction of the Earth would imply the first
construction not only of the exterior planets ? of the solar system?of
the Universe, but of the system of Universes as all having been
constructed out of some homogenous rotating nebulous mass, have
been assigned their respective amounts of it- and the sobr, and every
system may since have passed millions of times, through all the stages
of the process, and therefore the matter of the Earth and Moon
millions of times confused and restored to order.


. J, his kn owledge just obtained of the construction of the Universe,
m the acquisition,?understanding even in the entertaining of which
our previous knowledge discoveries, inventions, telescope, spectroscope
&c., have so largely contributed?clearly proves that this same know-
ledge possessed by Moses so many thousands of years ago, before
astvonomy had a name, before these inventions could have been made,
and this preparatory knowledge attained, could only have been
acquired by inspiration. This knowledge enables us also to perceive the
remarkable exactions with which references in the Bible are made to the
E w aT is uture the Barth, of which the few following are instances.
nf )7f seen t]aafc the pre-glacial and present post-glacial periods
. r �sult from similar inclinations of axis, and are therefore
similar, corresponding to autumn and spring-that the glacial period,
with an inclination of axis similar to that of Mars intervened between
those two similar periods of the Earth, as winter between autumn and
spring and that the pre-glacial state of the Earth was destroyed
nf ti, h A�E Wa ( vf r8 n f |, tlie i g period?jmd that the present state
ot the Earth will be destroyed by the intense heat of the succeeding
period, as the inner planets next become incandescent layers, the second
sub-stage of the nebulous star.
To these periods the following passages distinctly refer: ? The
Jtartli shall not again be destroyed by water, but by fire.? ? The
world that then was being overflowed with water perished, but the
Heavens and the Earth, which are now, are reserved unto fire.? As
fire can subsist only in matter, similar to that of the earth, as evidenced
l haaTo , ns ?n comprise only the exterior planets, as
their matter is identical with that of the earth.
Here are clearly indicated four of the Earth?s pei iods, before they had
a nan e the pre-glacial,glacial, post- glacial, and the succeeding incandes
cent periods ; that the pre-glacial and post-glacial states of the Earth
are similar; and as the former was destroyed by the water of the glacial
period, he latter will be destroyed by the fire of the incandescent layer
the Earth will next become. It is also stated ? The Heavens shall pass
away with a great noise, the elements shall smelt with fervent heat,
the Earth also and the works therein, shall be burned up.?
How accurate a description of the next state of the Earth, do we now
find tbe:e statements hitherto so incomprehensible to be of the inner
plarels becoming incandescent layers, the second sub-stage of the
nebulous star the system will become. How conclusive a proof of
he truth and inspiration of the Bible! How true do we now find
the statement of the same learned Professor Blackie, that ?Science
and the Bible at the fountain head are one.?
The correctness of the references in the Bible to these periods of the
Earth warrants the correctness of its chronology of those periods,
with ie.-pect to which a misapprehension, the consequent of that with
respect to the word creation has arisen, for as creation was thought
to mean the first construction of the world, so that construction'was
1 louglit to have taken place at the commencement of the present
period, which being six thousand years, was supposed to comprise the
lime from the beginning to the end of the world. But as the creation
o order out of confusion can only refer to the restoration to order of
the confuted matter of the Earth and Moon at the beginning of the


present period, so the 6000 years are only the length of the present
post-glacial period of the Earth, and therefore of each of the other
four periods, the five periods equal in length being 30,000 years.
We may then acquire an approximate estimate of the length of the
periods of planets of zones, of planets, of systems, and of zones of
systems. The protozoic period of Jupiter and Saturn, being coincident
with all the periods of the inner planets, the five periods of Jupiter
and Saturn, and therefore the five similar periods of Uranus and
those of Neptune are each 150,000 years, the periods of the three
zones equal to 450,000 years, less the coincidence of the post-glacial
period of Jupiter and Saturn with the protozoic of Uranus, and the
post-glacial of Uranus with the protozoic of Neptune or
about 60,000 years. Hence the opaque stage will require about
400,000 years to pass from the centre to the borders of the solar
system. It follows that the periods of the planets of the zones of Sirius
and of the leading systems of the exterior zones, are each about 400,000
years, that the periods of each zone of systems are 1,600,000 years,
and therefore the periods of the five zones of systems, 8,000,000 of years.
Hence, since Sirius and the solar system were nebulous stars, that
stage has been 8,000,000 years passing from the centre to its present
position on the borders of the Universe.
It cannot then be 24,000 years since the Earth was in her protozoic the
present period of Saturn, and since the matter of the Earth and Moon
was restored to order; nor can the past of the present state of the Earth
comprise much more than 18,000 years ?the pre-glacial- glacial, and
post-glacial periods. And as Mars and Mercury are half the size, so
their periods are half those of the Earth and Venus, or 3000 years
each ; and as there are clear indications of Mars being near
the close of his glacial period, it cannot be 1000 years till Mars,
acquiring the Earth?s inclination of axis commence his post-glacial
period which is coincident with the latter half of the present post-glacial
period of the Earth, and therefore the future of the post-glacial periods
of the inner planets cannot be 4000 ; certainly not 6000 years.
As then it cannot be 24,000 years since the Earth was in her
protozoic, the present period of Saturn, nor 6000 years till she became
an incandescent layer similar to those of the Sun, evolution is clearly a
delusion, as the hypothesis on which it rests?a past and future of
the present state of the Earth for millions of years,cannot have existed??
and cannot exist.
Hence the successive races of animals more and more complex in
structure which have appeared on the Earth, and which were supposed
to be due to evolution, have been successive creations suited to the
improved states of the Earth as they arose Irom the many convulsions
andcatoclysmsto whichinher earlier periods the Earth washable; and all
these creationshave taken place in aperiodof about twelve-thousand years,
comprised between the commencement of the protozoic and that of the
pre-glacial period, when man, the most complex in structure, was created.
These successive creations are quite in accordance with the many
special acts required in conducting every planet through the process,
with the series of five inclinations of axis common to all planets, in the
last stage of which each must be a special act, with the application of
heat in definite amounts at successive definite periods of time, &c. &c.
