VOL. XVIII. —NO. CVI, NEW SERIES


COLONIAL CUSTOM-HOUSES.
A EEPLY PROM VICTORIA.
IN the May number of this Maga-
zine an article appeared, en-
titled ‘ Colonial and Indian Custom-
Houses, and Manchester,’ from the
pen of Mr. Archibald Michie, Agent-
General of the colony of Victoria.
The aim of this article appears to
have been to excuse, if not to justify,
the imposition of protective duties
in Australia and India. With the
latter branch of the subject, the
present writer has no special ac-
quaintance, and with it, therefore,
he does not propose to deal; a re-
sidence of more than twenty-five
years in Victoria enables him, how-
ever, to speak with some confidence
on the Australian part of the case.
Although it might be inferred
from the title Mr. Michie has chosen
that the relative effects of free trade
and protection, in the several
colonies of the Australian group,
would be fully considered, the reader
at once discovers that, with one
slight exception, the custom-house
system treated of is that of Victoria.
This is represented by Mr. Michie
to have arisen naturally and neces-
sarily out of the exceptional circum-
stances in which the colony was
placed by the discovery of gold,
which he thus sketches :
Neither the natural increase of popula-
tion, nor the regularly arriving numbers of
immigrants from all parts of the world,
could find employment in a country posses-
sing such a limited number of pursuits.
Nor even as the area of these pursuits
became more extended, could they meet
the difficulty. Not everyone could turn
digger, bullock-driver, or farm labourer at
a moment’s notice; and the infinite variety
of strength and capacity, bodily and
mental, in the rising generation, demanded
some corresponding variety of industry or
occupation. Hence the origin of the
question, ‘What are we to do with our
boys ? ’ and hence, as a practical answer
to the question, arose an uncontrollable
desire to establish local manufactures.
‘Work, or the workhouse,’ went forth a
cry, ‘ must he provided for the unem-
ployed ! ’
One would naturally infer from
this passage that, unless a man were
content to become a digger, bullock-
driver, or farm labourer, he would
necessarily have starved. How de-
lusive this inference would be can be
easily shown. In 1865, the Govern-
ment of Victoria, of which, by the
way, Mr. Michie was a member,
published a ‘ Statistical Summary
of the Progress of the Colony of
Victoria for the Year 1865/ for the
information of visitors to the Dublin
International Exhibition. This was
a year before the first protective
tariff. This summary tells us :
The rates of wages in Victoria, although
lower than they were during the period
immediately succeeding the gold discove-
ries, are still high as compared with those
ruling in older countries. Farm labourers,
with board and lodging, now receive from
12s. to 18s. weekly, and good ploughmen
from 15s. to 1 1. The working day of
artizans and day-labourers in Victoria is
only eight hours, for which masons, brick-
layers, and blacksmiths receive from Bs. to
10s. in Melbourne; carpenters from 7s. to
9 s. In country districts, however, these
wages rule higher, and in some places are
quoted at 12s. all round. . . . The cost of
living in Victoria has been much reduced
of late years, and the retail prices of the
necessaries of life will be found in many
cases to be below the rates obtaining in
Great Britain and Ireland.
Here we have evidence, ■which Mr.
Michie will scarcely dispute, that
artizan labour was, at the period he
refers to, paid at about twice the
rate it could command in England,
while the cost of living was on the
whole lower than in Great Britain.
How, if there had been such a
dearth of employment as Mr.
Michie represents, artizan labour
could have been thus remunerated

any explanation conceivable. Hor
waa this remunerative employment
confined to the trades named. In
the list of exports of the year 1863
there are 72 articles manufactured
in the colony, the exports of which
amounted in value to a quarter of a
million sterling. Here are a few
examples :
These figures may seem small
from an English point of view:
they are not so when it is remem-
bered that the colony was virtually
only eleven years old. Small or
great, however, they completely
disprove Mr. Michie’s representa-
tion that digging, bullock-driving,
and labour on farms, were the
only employments available until
protection was established. They
furnish, too, a pretty clear indi-
cation that a large part of the
home consumption of manufactures
was produced in the colony, and
that the result, which Mr. Michie
insists could only be accomplished
by protective duties, was actually in
course of achievement under free
trade. 1
The cry about ‘ work or the work-
house,’ which Mr. Michie refers to,
was never uttered by any hard-work-
ing, sober, thrifty persons, and was
never justifiable. At no time in
the history of the colony has there
been a tithe of the distress which
has been often experienced in
protected countries. In the Uni-
ted States, in the year 1855,
200,000 pauper’s were relieved
at the public expense in the
state of Hew York alone. For
the twenty years then ending the
increase of population was 61 per
cent., and the increase of pauperism
706 per cent. In the city of Hew
York, sempstresses were making
pantaloons at six cents a pair, and
could earn in twenty hours just
about a shilling; and clothing was
protected at the Custom-House, to
the extent of 30 per cent. In 1865
women in Melbourne were paid for
the same class of work from 2 is. to
245. per week, without any protec-
tion whatever. It is quite true
that from time to time immigrants
arrived, more or less unsuited to
the circumstances of a new country ;
but a large proportion of these
would have been a burden on any
community, and either from indo-
lence, intemperance, or unthrifti-
ness, could scarcely have thriven
anywhere. It is quite a delusion
to suppose, as Mr. Michie suggests,
that for anyone who could not dig
or drive bullocks, there was nothing
but the workhouse or protective
duties.
The ‘ Soup Kitchens ’ more than
once opened by ‘ Government ’
had no existence except in Mr.
Michie’s imagination. In 1862
some well-meaning, but not over-
wise, people opened a soup kit-
chen in one of the suburbs of
Melbourne, where there no doubt
were persons in distressed circum-
stances. But it was soon found
that such a mode of relief was
unacceptable even to the people to
be relieved. The writer has heard
of a decent carpenter out of work,
who was visited by a fussy pro-
moter of the movement, and urged
to send for soup ; but who replied
1 In a lecture on Free Trade, delivered in Melbourne in 1865, the present writer said :
‘ln the United States, where a protectionist tariff has been for a long time in force,
there are thirty persons in every thousand engaged in manufactures and mechanical trades;
and in Victoria there are seventy-seven persons in every thousand so engaged. We find,
therefore, that there are two and a half times as many persons, in every thousand,
engaged in manufactures and mechanical trades in Victoria as in the United States.’
And this was under the free-trade regime!

that he was not a pauper, and
would not degrade his children by
sending them to fetch it. Some
less scrupulous sent and obtained
as much as they could get; while
in more than one case it was found
that people, comparatively well-to-
do, were actually getting a larger
quantity daily for the purpose of
feeding their pigs. The experi-
ment lasted but a month or two, was
a complete failure, because nothing
of the kind was required, and has
never been repeated. At the pre-
sent time there is a free tea given
once a week in the same suburb,
and about 600 people regularly pre-
sent themselves to partake of it.
Such a gathering of bond fide dis-
tressed people was scarcely possible
in the free-trade period of which
Mr. Michie writes, and is only one
of the many proofs now being fur-
nished that, under a protective tariff
and with an ultra-Radical Govern-
ment, there are more people with-
out employment and wanting a meal
than ever before. In reviewing
on January x, 1863, this very year
(1862), the Age newspaper re-
marked :
Peace and plenty have nestled in this
far distant corner. . . . Despite all that
can be said to the disadvantage of this
and the sister colonies, what other country
is there on the world’s surface that has so
much reason to be thankful for the past, or
can look to the future with as much
hope?
Again in the summary for Eng-
land, July 25, 1864, of the same
journal, there is this passage :
Although we are constantly hearing that
the colony is in a very depressed condition,
and that everybody is being ruined, yet,
strange to say, new enterprises continue to
be launched into existence, and new indus-
tries spring up around us.
English readers may not know that
the Age is an unimpeachable au-
thority on this point. Although
started as an advocate of com-
mercial freedom, it no sooner be-
came apparent that protection
would be popular, than the Age
adopted it. Ever since, this journal
has been the most bitter and un-
scrupulous assailant of the free-
trade party. When a journal such
as this writes, in the terms quoted,
of the condition of the people
during the ‘ work or the work-
house ’ period of Mr. Michie, its
testimony ought to be conclusive
evidence that, on this point at least,
Mr. Michie has drawn upon his
imagination for his facts.
In the year iB6O the same Mr.
Archibald Michie, author of the
article now under consideration,
delivered a lecture in Melbourne
entitled, ‘Victoria Suffering a Re-
covery.’ In it he thus rationally
discoursed of protection and free-
trade :
Protection, by a plainer and more de-
scriptive name, is compelling A to buy
something of B at a higher price than that
for which C can and will sell the same
article. B calls it protection. A calls it
robbery. B calls it protection, because, he
says, if you expose him to the competition
of C, he (B) can’t live by his business. A
calls it robbery because' you force from his
pocket, for the benefit of B, the difference
between the price at which he (A) can buy
of C, and the price at Which he (A) must
buy of B. . . . Protection, as it appears
to me, is merely another name for obtaining
money under false pretences by Act of
Parliament.
It is not surprising that a man
who once held these views, and who
now comes forward as the apologist
of protection, should misrepresent
and traduce his former allies. The
free-ti’aders, he now says, ‘ were
one and all [interested exclusively
for themselves ’ in resisting the
protective system. On his own
particular interest Mr. Michie should
be an excellent authority. Perhaps
he will take occasion to tell the
world what ‘ exclusive ’ interest of
his was to be promoted by the
triumph of the free-trade cause.
This imputation of selfish motives to
free-traders is very old, and is quite
unworthy of Mr. Michie. He knows
that a large number of the promi-
nent free-traders of this colony had


no more ‘exclusive’ interest to
serve than he had himself; that,
with him, they believed in free
trade just as they believed in the
multiplication table ; and that they
believed, also with him, that by
putting down a system of ‘ obtaining
money under false pretences by Act
of Parliament,’ they were serving
no other interest than that of the
public at large. The free-trade
party numbered among its adherents
four of the most distinguished mem-
bers of the bar the colony has had :
the late Mr. Justice Fellows, Mr.
Ireland, Q.C., Mr. Justice Stephen,
and Mr. J. Dennistoun Wood.
These names alone are a sufficient
answer to the aspersions Mr.Michie
now casts on the motives of Vic-
torian free-traders.
It is news for everyone in this
colony to learn that the protective
duties, first imposed in 1866, were
intended to raise revenue to pay for
railways. ‘ Ho custom-house,’ says
Mr. Michie, ‘ no railways ! ’ Let
us see how this agrees with the
facts. The duties were imposed in
1866. Nine years before, that is in
1857, money was borrowed in Eng-
land to make the railways to Ballarat
and Echuca, In 1862 the former
was completed and opened, and the
latter was also opened as far as
Sandhurst. It is clear, therefore,
that the duties were not imposed to
raise revenue for making railways.
Then, as to paying interest on the
money borrowed for that purpose.
For the year ending December
31, 1865, the net revenue from
these lines was 329,191 1, or 4 024
per cent, upon the debenture capital
expended on them. If the differ-
ence between this return and the
interest actually payable was a
burden too great for the ordinary
revenue to bear, some intimation of
the fact would have been given by
the treasurer of the day. No such
intimation, however, was given, and
for the simple reason that it would
not have been true. But we are
not left to inference to discover
whether or no the alleged design of
the protective duties is the true
one. Mr. (now Sir George) Verdon
was the treasurer who submitted
the budget including these duties,
in 1865. After explaining that the
total additional revenue from the
proposed duties was estimated at
236,900 1. ; that 154,200?. of that
sum was required to make up the
deficiency which would be created
by the proposed remission of other
customs duties ; that the remaining
82,700 1, would barely make up the
deficiency caused by certain items
of revenue being appropriated to
other purposes than theretofore,
Sir George went on to explain that
the Government had four objects
in view in proposing the change.
These he declared to be—the words
within inverted commas are Sir
George’s own:
I. To secure ‘greater equality in the
distribution of taxation.’
2. To avoid, as far as possible, * any
interference with the intercolonial
trade at present commanded by
Victoria.’
3. To apply ‘ the well-known maxim of
Adam Smith, to take as little out of
the pockets of the people as possible.’
4. To select for taxation ‘ those articles
which competed with our own pro-
ductions, rather than those which
did not.’
Seeing, then, that the money for
making the railways was provided
nine years before protective duties
existed; that they were opened four
years before those duties were im-
posed ; that they paid a very hand-
some percentage, even at that period,
on their cost; that no Treasurer
had ever complained to Parliament
that the difference between the in-
terest on the debentures, and the net
revenue of the lines, was a burden
which the Treasury could not bear ;
and finally, that Mr. Michie’s own
colleague, when proposing the pro-
tective tariff, clearly explained
that it was for quite other than
railway purposes, it is difficult to


understand how a gentleman in
the position of Agent-General of
the Colony, and having had such
peculiar facilities for being well
informed, could venture on such
reckless assertions. ‘To call re-
venue raised for such an object,’
says Mr. Michie, ‘ a protective move-
ment within the usual acceptation of
the phrase, is surely a misconception
and an abuse of language.’ But if
it was not raised for such an object
as has been clearly shown, then,
surely, to Mr. Michie’s represen-
tation, even stronger terms than
‘ misconception ’ and ‘ abuse of
language ’ might with propriety be
applied.
One of the minor features of this
railway fiction must be noticed.
Mr. Michie represents the cost of
carriage from Melbourne to Castle-
maine as being, after the railway
was opened, ‘ six and twenty shil-
lings a ton of goods, which had
theretofore cost for the same service a
hundred o.nd forty pounds. ’ Again
Mr. Michie must be called to refute
himself. In the lecture before re-
ferred to, delivered, it must be re-
membered, in iB6O, and before the
railway just mentioned was com-
pleted, he said: ‘ A beautifully
metalled road enables you to go
in eight or nine hours to Castle-
maine, a journey which, in the
year 1852, you could hardly
achieve in less than three days! ’
Mr. Michie now ignores the ‘ beau-
tifully metalled road ’ altogether ;
compares the toilsome journey of
1852 with that by rail; and leaves
his readers to conclude that during
the free-trade period nothing was
done to improve the highways and
lessen the cost of carriage. As a
matter of fact, the ‘ beautifully
metalled road ’ preceded the duties
by nearly a decade. The carriage
of goods to Castlemaine ‘thereto-
fore,’ that is for some years before
the railway was completed, was as
shown below. For the figures the
writer is indebted to the well-
known carrying Arm of Messrs. W.
McCulloch & Co., of Melbourne :
Summer rate "Winter rate
per ton per ton
1855 . . £l2 , . £24
1859 . 8 . .16
1861 . . 6 . .12
Thus, long before the railway was
completed the cost of carriage was
reduced to a very moderate sum,
for a country in which horse feed
was dear and wages high —a sum
very different indeed from ‘ a hun-
dred and forty pounds.’
But Mr. Michie further under-
takes to show that the protec-
tive system in Victoria has been
a success. ‘ That these duties,’
he says, ‘also gave an impulse to
manufactures in the colony cannot
be doubted.’ Bor evidence of this
he goes to Mr. Hayter’s Victorian
Year Boole for 1876-7, and cites
some figures, of which only the fol-
lowing are material:

WORKS, ETC.
Total Number of
Establishments
Number of hands
employed
11,330
19,468
31,478

2,302
Is anyone expected to believe
that the 982 manufactories in 1867
were all brought into existence by
the tariff passed only in the pre-
vious year ? If not, how does Mr.
Michie reconcile the fact that so
many existed, under free trade, with
his previous representation that
digging, bullock-driving, and kin-
dred occupations were the only ones
available during the pre-protection
period ? And if we ask for proof
that the increase shown in Mr.
Hayter’s tables is due to protection,
where is it to be found ? It is a
fact that a large number of indus-
tries were acclimatised prior to
1866. It is reasonable to suppose
that, without State meddling, the
same causes which led to their in

It will be observed that in only
two trades ont of this list has Yic-
toria outstripped her neighbour,
and, mirabile diclu, those two are
troduction would, as the colony
became settled and the population
grew, lead to their increase. What
would have happened in Victoria
may be inferred from what has hap-
pened in New South Wales. In
the following table some of the
principal trades are selected which
protection was designed to encourage
in Victoria, and a comparison is
made between the number of fac-
tories belonging to these trades in
Victoria and in New South Wales
during 1876:
It will be observed that in only
two trades out of this list has Vic-
toria outstripped her neighbour,
and, mirabile dictu, those two are
protected in New South Wales as
well as in Victoria! In regard to
all the others there is perfect free
trade in New South Wales. It is
necessary to add that the population
of Victoria was, in 1876, 840,300,
and that of New South Wales in
the same year 629,776. If it was,
as Mr. Michie alleges, the protec-
tive system which gave an impulse
to manufactures in Victoria, to what
are we to attribute the greater de-
velopment of similar manufactures
exposed to unlimited competition in
New South Wales P
To show how customs duties have
affected the demand for British
manufactures in Victoria, Mr. Michie
gives a table, from Mr. Hayter’s
Year Boole , of the value of imports
and exports, both in gross and per
head of the population, of the
several colonies of the Australian
group. On this table Mr. Michie
remarks:
It will thus be seen that the value per head
of the consumption of imports in Victoria
in the year 1876 was iBi.iBs. ijd.as against
22 1. 13s. 1 \d. per head in the colony of
New South ... As the habits
and modes of life of the people of the two
colonies are much the same, Victoria would
appear to be supplying herself with her own
manufactures to the extent of 3 1. 15s. a
head, spent in the colony, instead of its
being sent to England.
To both the facts and inferences
of this passage exception must be
taken. Mr. Michie has compared
the imports of Victoria in 1876
with those of New South Wales
in 1875. By this means he has
managed to compare the lowest
year of Victoria for the last five
years with the highest of New
South Wales for the same period.
Again, he has rested his case on
one year, instead of on an average ;
a proceeding which is always more
or less deceptive, and is therefore
eschewed by statists. If we take
the five years from 1872 to 1876,
both inclusive, we have this result:

By this wider and more trust-
worthy induction, Mr. Michie’s
4 three pounds fifteen shillings ’ is
at once reduced to iZ. 3s. 3<Z.
So much for the facts: now for
the inferences. Are the imports
alone a reliable means of measur-
ing the domestic manufactures of
O ,
a country ? Must not the imports
in a very large degree depend upon
the exports ? And can a country
which produces a large quantity of


exportable articles conduct a pro-
fitable business unless it imports
largely also ? The average exports
per head for the five years ending
with 1876 were as follows:
Victoria New South Wales
£lB 5 6 . . £2l 7 3
Instead of coming to Mr. Mi-
chie’s conclusion, that the smaller
imports of Victoria indicate larger
domestic manufactures, would it
not be somewhat more rational to
conclude that, as New South Wales
has more to export, she naturally
receives larger imports in return ?
For, it must be borne in mind, there
is no question here of payment in
coin. Both the colonies are ex-
porters of coin and bullion; and
the imports and exports of the
precious metals are included in the
■per capita calculation upon which
Mr. Michie proceeds. Again, may
not the consumption of commodi-
ties be greater in a country where
their importation is free, than in one
where their importation is clogged
with heavy duties ? It would appear
from the statistics to which the
writer has access, that in Great
Britain the poorer classes manage
to consume about three times as
much corn as they did before the
repeal of the Corn Laws. Why
should not the people of New
South Wales consume more manu-
factured goods than those of Vic-
toria ; at least, of such goods as are
free of duty in the former, and
subject to 20 per cent, duties in the
latter ? The duties levied in V ic-
toria, on articles which are free in
New South Wales, amount to up-
wards of 500,000!. - per annum.
The sum is probably increased by
the profits of each person through
whose hands the goods pass to
750,0001!. by the time it is paid by
the consumer. Here we have a
burden on the people of nearly one
pound per head. Would it be very
astonishing if, in a neighbouring
country, where the people are alto-
gether free from such a burden,
they expend the sum thus saved on
manufactured goods ? All experi-
ence goes to show that cheapening
a commodity or a service increases
its use; and what has happened in
regard to bread and postage in
Great Britain might not unreason-
ably be expected to happen in regard
to boots, woollens, and agricultural
implements in New South Wales.
The larger imports of New South
Wales, therefore, may not afford
the slightest support to Mr. Michie’s
theory that protection has given an
impulse to manufactures in Vic-
toria ; but may only be an indication
that, other things being equal, the
people of one country, where an
article is cheap, will consume more
of it than the people of another
country where it is dear. But let
us apply Mr. Michie’s argument to
some of the other colonies —to Tas-
mania, for example. The average
imports of that colony for the three
years cited by Mr. Michie were
ill. Bs. per head; that is, 81. 1 is. 2d.
per head less than Victoria. Are
we to conclude, with Mr. Michie,
that Tasmania ‘ would appear to be
supplying herself with her own
manufactures to the extent of’
81. 11 s. 2d. ‘a head spent in the
colony, instead of being sent to
England r ’ Yet, if Mr. Michie’s
conclusion in regard to Victoria be
sound, Tasmania must be supplying
herself with seven times as great a
proportion of her consumption of
manufactured goods as Victoria,
and this with a tariff but slightly
protective, and adopted only for
revenue purposes. This case of
Tasmania, in fact, points to the con-
clusion already suggested, that the
imports are influenced chiefly by the
exports. Tasmania has but 91!. 6s. sc?,
per head to export, and she gets
back 11Z. Bs. Victoria sends out
18Z, s s. 6d., and receives in return
19Z. 19s. 2d. per head. New South
Wales parts with 21Z. 7 s. 3d. per
head of exports, and imports in re


turn 21 1. 2s. s d. There seems here
a natural proportion between the
outgoings and the incomings of
each colony —a proportion which
we may safely conclude would be
pretty well preserved even if the
exports of Victoria were doubled.
In the latter case, not even Mr.
Michie would be satisfied if the im-
ports did not increase in a somewhat
similar ratio; unless, indeed, he is
a believer in the old bugbear called
Balance of Trade, and thinks that
the surest indication of a country’s
prosperity is that its exports exceed
its imports.
Mr. Michie thinks fit to taunt Sir
Henry Parkes, of Hew South Wales,
with having advocated protection in
iB6O. That was eighteen years ago,
and the very year of Mr. Michie’s
lecture before referred to. Time,
which should make all men wiser,
has enabled Sir Henry to grasp the
truth, which Mr. Michie then in-
sisted on; while Mr. Michie turns
his back upon the light, and reverts
to the economic system of the dark
ages —to the system which he him-
self so forcibly and skilfully exposed,
and belief in which Mr. Grant Duff
recently described as having become,
in England, ‘ the creed only of in-
capables.’ Truly, when one recalls
the clear view and vigorous descrip-
tion of the truths of free trade
which Mr. Michie exhibited in i 86 0;
when one considers that it is quite
impossible for any man to divest
himself of knowledge once obtained,
one is enabled to appreciate to the
full Mr. Michie’s declaration: ‘lt
is certain that free trade has no
more dangerous or formidable ene-
mies than are to be found much too
plentifully among Free Traders ! ’
