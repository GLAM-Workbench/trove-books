DEDICATION.
From earliest youth in writing verse
I found a fascination;
In leisure hours it still remains
A favorite recreation.
Now from these efforts I have made
At random a collection.
And in this booklet will he found
Of rhymes a small collection.
Dear Readers of the “Budget,” pray
Accept this dedication;
I shall not deem, that labour lost
Which veins your approbation.
Sydney,
March, 1917.

1917
i The first of all numbers, and Unity’s sign,
9 Lucky three, three times numbered makes for-
tunate nine.
i Once more start the count of the figures we’n
given,
7 And welcome the symbol most sacred of seven.
Then let Hope be our anchor whatever betide,
Let us never forget we have Right on our side;
And before the year closes pray God zve may see
A Victorious Peace, which will set the zvorld Free.


Where’er we go, a little badge
In white and red and blue.
Is seen bedecking young and old,
What is its meaning true!
It means that Britain is intent
On victory o’er a foe,
Who mercy, honor, liberty,
And justice does not know.
It means that far across the sea
The message comes to all:
The Motherland her children needs,
Nor vainly does she call.
How can we help to win the war!
The question echoes wide;
Australia’s fate is in the scales,
We dare not stand aside.
Our womanhood has heard the call,
She answers it aright ;
With aching heart, but smiling lips
She sends her men to fight.
Service of love, not slavery,
True loyalty demands ;
We must not shrink from sacrifice
Of treasure; heart, or hands.
For victory is at last in sight;
And loyal to the core,
Let all Australia unite
And help to Win the War.


Nellie Melva
I am modest as a rule,
I own a judgment cool,
1 lay no claim to any shining grace:
But once upon a time,
Which I celebrate in rhyme,
I talked with Madame Melba face to face.
Although she’s Queen of Song
From London to Hong Kong,
She’s simple, gracious, generous, sincere;
Though she reigns in Paris, Cork,
Rome, Brussels, and New York,
Still she holds of all, her native land most dear.
She’s Australian to the core,
And as I’ve said before,
I’ve talked with her, and so I can aver
That loyal to her land
Will Melba ever stand:
What wonder that Australia’s proud of her!


A Recipe
for Patience
First take of human sympathy
As much as you can spare;
A generous dose of humor add,
It has a power rare.
With milk of kindness mix it,
Add a dash of commonsense,
And of “put-yourself-in-others’ place,”
If you are slightly dense.
Last, this is most important,
So don’t forget the rule.
When the potion well is blended
Set it aside to cool,


EARLY VERSES.




My First Sight of Sydney
For ninety weary days and nights,
No other ship in view,
We sailed mid storm and shine to seek
A country strange and new.
Blue sky above, blue sea below,
Still seen on either hand:
Blue sea below, blue sky above,
We longed in vain for land.
At last one night a beacon bright
Shone like a friendly star,
And dawn displayed a welcome sight
To wanderers from afar.
Like giant gates in welcome ope’d,
The proud Heads seem to stand,
And rear their stately forms to guard
The entrance of the land.
Here smiling lies a grassy slope,
And there a silvery strand,
While nestling mid their woody shade
The white cots glistening stand.
Over the sunny water’s edge
The dark green gum tree bends,
While many an inlet, creek, and bay
Its varied beauty lends.
The bay with life is all astir,
Was never sight more fair;
The white-winged yachts have caught the breeze,
Soft fragrance fills the air.
And through it all the city’s hum,
Like friendly voices clear,
With welcome seems awake to greet
The weary travellers’ ear.


Faithful unto Death.
Silence pervades the solemn night,
Ihe moonbeams throw a quivering light,
The birds are hushed, a gentle breeze
Scarce stirs the branches of the trees,
Which, in the moon’s uncertain rays,
Look dim and ghost-like, to the gaze
Of one lone sentinel, who keeps
His watch, while every soldier sleeps.
Alas! that in this beauteous land
h oe should meet foe, with sword and brand
And worst of all, that deadly blows
Should ever be exchanged ’twixt those
Who, brethren once, now meet in war
Those whom they loved full well before:
Forgetting in their civil strife
Their former peaceful, happy life,
When side by side they tilled the soil,
Or laboured hard in honest toil.
Now camped beneath the summer sky,
The Auvergne soldiers sleeping lie,
Their sentry keeps his vigil lone,
Right firmly pacing up and down;
His ear attent to every sound,
His eye still glancing all around;
His thoughts meantime full often roam
Where sits his fair young wife at home.
His memory can well retrace
Each feature of her loving face,
And well he knows her prayers ascend
That Heaven her soldier may defend.


But, hush! what is that form he sees,
Whose shadow falls athwart the trees ?
Is that a step? What need he fear?
The enemy lies far from here.
When suddenly before his eyes
He sees, as if by magic, rise
A hundred spears, which, flashing bright,
Appear at once before his sight i
And while for fear his blood runs chill
A voice says, “For your life, be still;
Nothing can save you if you dare
Utter a sound, and so, beware!”
Oh! life is sweet, and death is drear,
And wife and home indeed are dear:
His comrades’ sleep is so profound
That even if the alarm he sound
They will not wake, —or else too late
To save themselves from certain fate,
While by his silence he may save
Himself from an untimely grave.
No thoughts like these his mind possess,
No longer fears his heart oppress,
“Auvergne, the foe !” rings clearly through
The startled air. The soldier true,
Even in death, cries “Vive la France!”
As in the moonlight gleams each lance,
Buried next moment in the heart
Of the brave sentry, Jacques Lamarte.
But e’er he draws his latest breath,
And loses sight and sound in death,
His ears catch faintly the glad sound
Of movement in the camp around:
The hurried tramp of armed men,
The noise of guns and culverin;
For they have heard his warning cry,
He feels in truth ’tis blest to die;
In happiness he loses pain.
He knows his death is not in vain.


The Neolian Harp
“A maiden’s soft touch can awaken
The lute’s sweetest tones at her will,
But no mortal fingers have shaken
My strings with an answering thrill.
“Breathe, oh, soft wind from the mountain,
Blow, spicy breeze from the sea:
And rising, like silvery fountain,
Sweet music shall waken from me.”
Gently the west wind came sweeping,
Balm-laden, over the seas;
Came where the mute harp lay sleeping,
Waiting the touch of the breeze.
Sudden the dumb soul found answer,
Thrilled every string, soft and clear,
Quivering, each tone broke the stillness,
And Echo lay silent to hear.
The music in fuller vibrations
Died softly, then fuller arose,
Swelling like murmuring waters, ,
As stronger the deep current flows.


Fuller, and sweeter, and richer,
Rose like a glad voice again:
The breath of the warm summer breezes
Bore it far over the plain.
Bore it through shades of the forest,
Bore it o ’er miles of the sea:
Trees waved in welcome before it,
Birds hushed their songs on the lea.
The toiler forgot he was weary,
The sick man remembered no pain;
And souls once so hopeless and dreary
Were soothed by the cheering refrain.
Fond dreamers awoke from their dreaming,
The prizes they sighed for to win,
And hot tears unheeded came streaming
From hearts that were hardened in sin.
And such is the wondrous awaking
Of many a heart, silent long,
Till Love ? s touch, each fine fibre shaking,
It floods all the earth with its song.


Nutumn Winds.
The Spirits of Air hold their revel to-night;
They ride on the wings of the blast ;
The wild winds of autumn rejoice in their might,
The glory of summer is past.
The zephyr of spring oft has wooed me in vain
With its balmy but treacherous breath;
Its langorous fragrance is freighted with pain,
With longing, and sorrow, and death.
The ice-blast of winter, it freezes my soul;
It knoweth no tenderer mood;
Frost laden it comes from the desolate Pole—
I shudder at kisses so rude.


Oh! wild wind of autumn, all weakness defy!
Thou life laden, health-bringing friend,
Come, fling all the fleecy clouds far o’er the sky,
That the white moon her weird light may lend.
Let thy presence bring peace, and with fervor inspire
Cool my forehead and lift up my hair;
Stir my blood till my pulses are leaping with fire,
Give me courage to do and to dare.
The old forest giants are bending their boughs,
The dead leaves are whirling along;
And ocean’s deep caverns their echoes arouse,
To join in the thunders of song.
Now the cool air caresses my cheek and my brow,
And sighs through the whispering trees;
I listen, as oft I have listened ere now,
To a voice on the murmuring breeze.
CM memories thronging it bears to my brain,
Vague yearning is thrilling my breast,
And in Nature’s calm strength I am seeking again
Fresh courage and comfort and rest.
Oh! wind, on thy pinions I gladly would roam,
And following my fancy so fleet.
Far'swifter than sea bird I’d flit o’er the foam,
And light at my dearest one’s feet.
I’d bring him an odor of brine from the seas,
A breath of fresh air from the skies,
The fragrance of flowers, cool shade from the trees,
And with kisses I’d close his dear eyes!


Love and Ambition.
Alas! too late. I see it now:
Mine all the blame ;
I would not love, but only sighed
To win a name.
“Love or Ambition?” Once the choice
Before me lay:
I wavered long, but in the end
Pride won the day.
Long hours of struggle and despair
At last are crowned,
And on my aching temples bare
A wreath is bound.


The rapid years have passed away,
My youth has fled;
The barren honours come too late—
Now he is dead.
I hear once more the pleading tones,
They thrill me yet,
My aching heart .can neyer still
This wild regret.
I see once more that longing face
So wrung with pain;
The haunting visions of the past
Come once again.
I stretch my eager hands across
The empty space,
My wistful eyes the darkness scan
To see his face.
His soft voice murmurs tenderly,
“My love, at last!”
And round my trembling form a hand
Is warmly claspt.
’Tis but a dream! I start and wake,
The vision gone;
Too late! Henceforth for evermore
I am alone.


Firelight Fancies.
Two children in the firelight
Gaze in the embers’ glow,
And through the gathering twilight
Their merry voices flow.
Their eager childish faces
Shine in the flickering light,
As each a picture traces
Among the cinders bright.
“0, there’s a house!” says Lucy,
And claps her little hands;
“1 see the doors and windows:
How beautiful it stands!”
An old man with a bundle
Gertrude points out with glee,
‘‘Look at his beard! it’s longer
Than Grandpapa’s,” says she.
?I see a queer old woman,
Look at her bright red cloak.
Her face and big poke bonnet
Half hidden by the smoke.”
“Oh, see that huge black mountain,
It looks so far away,
And caverns, too, all lighted,
That’s where the goblins play.”
Unnoticed by the children,
A gentle footstep steals,
The flame leaps up, and brightly
Their mother’s face reveals.


“0, here’s Mamma! Do tell ns
What yon can find in here;
We’ve seen such splendid pictures ;
What see you, mother dear?”
The mother’s soft caresses
Answer their eager tone,
She smooths their golden tresses,
Round each an arm is thrown.
But, musing, she keeps silence,
Watching the happy pair,
She sees the dazzling embers,
But reads no pictures there.
She thinks how oft in childhood,
With insight swift and keen,
They come, those brighter visions
By older eyes unseen.
The world is all a wonder.
In spring-time’s happy morn,
The rose-light has not vanished
That crowns the early dawn.
Faith is their guardian angel,
And things are what they seem,
Hope lends her brightest colours
To gild their .childish dream.
Alas! the golden vision
Fades as we older grow •
We see no fairy pictures
In sun or firelight’s glow.
But let the years bring courage.
Our childish faith renew:
Hold fast the hope that somewhere
Our dreams may yet come true.


Tempest Tossed.
See, a storm is arising, for shelter towards home
The little ships swiftly are cleaving the foam,
The sea-mew’s sad wailing is borne on the breeze,
The winds in mad frolic are lashing the seas.
I would I were out on the waters to-night,
I’d dare e’en the boisterous billows’ wild might,
The elements there in loud warfare engage,
The tumult within they perchance might assuage.
No lights in the harbour: the heavy mists whirl,
And I list from afar to the waves’ angry swirl;
My passion-tossed bosom methinks would find rest
If borne by the wind over Ocean’s dark breast.
Out, out in the darkness! yet whither to go ?
Alone I must recklessly drift in my woe:
But whence comes this anguish ? I scarcely can tell;
’Tis surely the work of some horrible spell.
Nay! betrayed and deserted, full well I know now,
To another is whispered my false lover’s vow;
And youth’s foolish dreams are for ever o ’erpast;
Though he may love twice, —my first love is my last!


SIX SONGS.




With the Ti de
Merrily, cheerily, lazily they glide,
The green willows bend above the deep river’s side;
Hearts like the sunshine, and eyes with joy that flash,
They’re singing to the music of their oars’ soft plash :
“Merrily, cheerily, floating with the tide
Adown life’s stream we’ll travel, love, for ever,
side by side.”
Wearily, drearily, faded seems the gleam,
The oars have grown so heavy as he pulls against the
stream;
Her pretty lips are pouting and a frown is on his
brow,
No merry laugh or happy song awakes the echoes
now.
Wearily, drearily, up against the stream,
Vanished is the glamour of their happy, golden
dream.
Safe on shore, home at last! but as they turn to part,
Eyes meet eyes reproachfully, and heart looks into
heart;
Bach repents and both forgive, and sweetly sounds
again
The music of their voices as they sing the old refrain:
“Merrily, cheerily, adown life’s silver tide,
Still side by side, for ever, love, we peacefully will
glide. ”


The Sailor Boy
The waters are dashing
Right over the pier,
The sound of their splashing
Falls cold on my ear;
The shadows are falling,
I stand here alone,
In sadness recalling
The days that are gone.
The wild waters snatched him,
My beautiful boy!
That morn how I watched him,
In pride and in joy;
Ah! little I thought
That such anguish could be
As that which was wrought
By the cold, smiling sea!
His mother’s delight
And the pride of the town,
O’er the waters so bright
He went sailing a-down:
But my watching is vain,
For across the white foam
He will ne’er come again
To my desolate home.


Waiting.
The stars kiss the crest of the mountain,
The shadows sleep soft on the hill,
And faint falls the plash of the fountain
As night comes up, shrouded and still.
The odorous zephyr is shaking
The reeds on the dark river bed:
The nightingale’s soft notes are waking
The slumbering echoes o’erhead.
Across where the lake seems to glisten,
Par off, like a silvery tear,
I gaze, and I sigh as I listen;
Oh! would that my lover were here!
A passionate yearning is filling
My heart with a rapturous fear:
All my pulses response to the thrilling
Which whispers, “My lover is near!”
Come, love, come, my soul’s only master,
Let this heart be for ever thy throne,
Let the moments that bring him fly faster,
I am watching and waiting alone!


At Rest
Sleep, loved one, sleep.
Life’s rude and stormy billows are o’erpast,
Now in thy longed-for haven, anchor cast,
Thy fragile bark can rest in peace at last:
Sleep, softly sleep.
Our loved one sleeps.
Tread softly where the bright-eyed daisies peer
Where rippling waters murmur soft and clear,
Her gracious spirit seems to linger here:
She softly sleeps.
Sleep, sweetly sleep.
No scornful pity can her peace molest,
No cruel words disturb her tranquil breast,
No selfish tears shall mar her quiet rest;
Hush, let her sleep.


Asbent Friends.
I wonder if they think of me,
The loving hearts at home?
Though now a lonely wanderer,
Afar Fm doomed to roam.
When they gather in the twilight,
And each familiar face
Shines in the ruddy firelight,
Do they keep one vacant place?
Those voices soft and tender
I never can forget,
Like a. strain of dying harmony
Their echo lingers yet.
I watch the sea-gulls circling
Above the white waves’ crest,
Had I their wings, how gladly
I’d homeward fly to rest.


For Ever and For Ever.
We walked together, side by side,
The sea was still at eventide,
It seemed to sing, while flowed the tide,
“For ever and for ever.”
Our hearts beat high, we banished care,
Our ardent vows we plighted there,
Eternal constancy did swear
For ever and for ever.
I walked beside the sea alone,
The dashing waters seemed to moan,
But still I heard the well-known tone,
“For ever and for ever.”
I listened to the wild wind’s sigh,
I watched the foaming wave rush high,
Now he is gone, bereft am I
For ever and for ever.
I heard a step—whose could it be?
I raised my eyes,—behold Twas he!
“Dear love, I am come home to thee
For ever and for ever!”
’Tis he himself, the loved, the true,
Our happy vows we pledged anew,
While murmured still the waters blue
“For ever and for ever.”


RHYMES for CHILDREN




The Belgian
Goose
Goose
Girl
I’m just a little Belgian girl;
And nearly all day long
I wander through the country-side,
The grass and flowers among.
I only have two geese to mind,
But once we had a score;
But that was in the happy days
Before this dreadful war.
And when I ask where father is,
My mother only cries,
Although I beg her not to weep,
And dry her tired eyes.
My brothers, too, have gone away,
They used to be so kind;
I wish they’d taken me with them,
And not left mo behind.
But mother says we’re safer here,
Close to the friendly Dutch;
For further south are dreadful things-
She dares not tell me much.
But when I say my prayers at night,
I always pray for peace,
And ask that God will grant that soon
This dreadful war will cease.


The Discontented
Sq uirrel
A squirrel once lived in a high beech tree,
As merry and pert as a squirrel could be;
The sweetest nuts were his daily fare,
Tie knew not the meaning of want or care.
One day in his rambles he climbed so high
There was naught overhead but the bright blue sky
Below lay an ocean of waving green,
But beyond—such a prospect was never seen!
Away in the distance the blue hills rose,
Their tall heads crowned with the winter’s snows
And the sunshine glittered like purest gold
On the sides of the mountain, steep and bold.
The little squirrel’s wondering gaze
Was caught by the sunlight’s dazzling rays:
His forest home looked bare and cold;
He longed to set out for the hills of’gold.
But soon darkness fell, and it hid from sight
The wonderful hills in their golden light,
And he clambered down from his perch so high,
With a longing heart and a weary sigh.
And when in the morning the sun rose bright.
He thought again of the wondrous sight;
‘ ‘ I hate this dreary old wood, ’ ’ said he,
“ ’Tis time I left it, the world to see.”


He started off on Ms eager quest,
And lie boldly resolved lie would never rest
Till the golden hills were safely won;
The journey, he thought, would be quickly done.
The road was smooth, and Ms heart was light,
Though the mountains at first were out of sight:
The sun was bright and balmy the air:
“Hurrah!” he said, “I shall soon be there.”
Hour after hour he journeyed on.
Beneath the rays of a scorching sun:
He had left the cool wood for the open plain,
Though hungry, he looked for a nut in vain.
His little feet grew weary and sore,
The road seemed lengthening more and more;
But he travelled bravely onward still.
On the way to the glorious golden hill.
The sun was sinking, the evening breeze
Game rustling through the distant trees,
Soon the darkness fell, not even a ray
From the trembling stars—he had lost his way! •
His brave little spirit at last doth email,
His weary feet are beginning to fail,
And despairing lie murmurs, 4 4 Oh, why did I roam!
How I wish I were back in my own dear home! ’ ’
Still he wandered on, though he knew not where;
He shivered with cold in the midnight air,
Till exhausted he sank on the ground to rest,
And mournfully thought of his own warm nest.
He peacefully slept till the break of day,
But when the glad sun drove the darkness away,
With a cry of delight and forgotten pain,
He found himself hack in the old wood again!


The Silly
Mouse
There once was a pussy-cat slender and fair,
Her footfall was gentle, and silky her hair ;
But strange, from the glance of her tender green eye,
Every mouse at express speed did instantly fly.
’Tis really unkind,” said poor puss with a sigh,
“All the mice seem to shun me, I cannot tell why;
to be friendly, and ne’er dream of harm,
I’m sure there’s no cause for the slightest alarm. ::
One pert little mouse heard these words from his
hole.
And excitedly back to his brothers he stole,
And pointed out plainly how much they might gain,
If one so distinguished her friendship would deign.


But old Mrs. Mouse very sternly replied,
“On speeches like that can no trust be relied;
Foolish boy, take a warning, or learn to your cost
Who trusts a cat’s friendship is sure to be lost.”
The vain little mouse did not list to a word,
“My mother is old, and her fears are absurd;
But pussy means well; if a visit she’d pay,
I am sure that they all would invite her to stay. ’ ’
One night he came softly and peeped through the
door
And after five minutes, or perhaps it was more,
He politely remarked what an honor ’twould be,
If his beautiful friend would but step in to tea.
He flung the door open, but pussy was wise,
“Who betrays his own kinsfolk,” she softly replies,
“Would as soon betray me, and I’m sure it is best,
To settle him first, then look out for the rest. ’ ’
The poor little mouse only uttered one squeak,
He’d no time a word of entreaty to speak;
1 hope that the others escaped, I can’t tell,
But I’m sure you’ll agree he deserved his fate well.


Mrs Lion at the Zoo
Mrs. Lion one fine day
Took her children out to play;
They were good as good could be,
Quite a pleasure were to see.
Little Jack in tunic neat.
With his sisters twin so sweet,
Walked sedately up and down
Through the streets of Sydney town.
“As you’ve been so good to-day,”
Mother Lion then did say,
“You shall have a lovely view;
I will take you to the Zoo.”
In they went. What a surprise
Met the children’s wondering eyes!
Uncles, Cousins, Pa’s and Ma’s
Smiled a welcome through the bars.
Then the keeper came along,
Kindly said, “Sure, ma’am, you’re wrong
Not to enter when you see
Board and lodging given free.”
Then the door he opened wide,
And they gaily stepped inside,
Pleased to find such quarters fine,
Gladly they sat down to dine.
Mrs. Lion now you’ll see
Happy with her children three;
And you’ll know this tale is true
When you meet them at the Zoo.
