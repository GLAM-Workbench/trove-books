"As a very important source of
strength and security, cherish public
credit. One method of preserving it
is to use it as sparingly as possible . . .
avoiding likewise the accumulation of
debt, not only by shunning occasions of
expense, but by vigorous exertions in
time of peace to discharge the debts
which unavoidable wars may have oc-
casioned, not ungenerously throwing
upon posterity the burthen which we
ourselves ought to bear.”
—From Washington’s Farewell Address,


I
ACCORDING to the signs of
jLJI. the times, America seems
to be turning upward toward
prosperity. There are two kinds
of “prosperity.” One is ex-
pressed in such things as bound-
ing stock markets, crowded
night clubs, and spectacular


sudden riches for the few. The
other —and the only sound kind
—is an ever-widening distribu-
tion of useful goods and services.
If we keep our heads we may
expect to see in the future a
greater measure of this sound
kind of prosperity than we have
ever dreamed of in the past.
As business picks up, we fre-
quently hear this question:
“Can industry, even if pro-
duction returns to normal, ab-
sorb all the unemployed?”
In my opinion, there is so
much useful work in this coun-
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


try crying to be done that we
should be able to use every em-
ployable person for a long time
to come. The expression, “nor-
mal production,” is misleading.
Production has never been as
high as it should be. We have
never had over-production, only
under-distribution. Our pro-
duction facilities are away ahead
of the people’s buying facilities.
What we need is a money en-
gineer who will see to it that the
money system is made capable
of bearing the load of the widest
popular consumption.
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


Not long ago a young man
who had heard my name men-
tioned in connection with a
possible political office asked,
“What is your reaction to that?”
“My reaction is good,” I re-
plied.
“You mean that you might
consider it?” he asked.
“I mean that I’m not inter-
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


ested,” I said. “I can be much
more useful tending strictly to
my own business.”
I’m not worrying about the
new law which increases in-
heritance taxes.
I hope to be around for quite
a while in this most interesting
world. If anybody must worry
about it, it should be the gov-
ernment that expects to collect
this huge tax and the people
who will see most of their in-
dependent institutions wrecked
by it.
I am interested to know just
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


how such a program can be
carried out —if and when!
They can’t take a productive
plant apart —that would only
reduce it to old iron. The
pieces wouldn’t be worth much.
They can’t take over the plant
and operate it —they don’t know
enough. Government operation
has made a reputation for fail-
ure wherever tried. Of course,
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


it is an easy way to do business
—you just take your pay rolls
and losses out of the taxes. A
government - made automobile
would be a pretty costly thing.
The price would be higher, the
value less, the wages lower, the
whole social value of the busi-
ness greatly depreciated. It
sounds nice when young the-
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


orists discuss it, but running a
factory is another thing.
But why worry about some-
thing that is so fundamentally
wrong? Just making a law
doesn’t upset the natural course
of things. The last word is with
the actual nature of things. A
King Canute may speak, but the
sea rolls on just the same.
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


Our business, of course, is
able and willing to pay reason-
able taxes. We have paid over
half a billion dollars in taxes
during our business career.
Most of our income is imme-
diately translated into outgo.
We are used to that. But in-
experienced politicians don’t
seem to understand that busi-
ness is not a method of hoarding
but a method of distribution —
“sharing,” if you like.
Worry is one of the most
wasteful things in the world.
Men say they are worried about
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


communism, or government in-
terference, or their competitors.
If they stopped worrying they
could attend to their own busi-
ness more efficiently, and that
is the surest defense against the
very things they fear. I mean
just that —a man who worries
is not using his job to its best
advantage. A man’s job is his
best mental health insurance.
A man wrapped up in his work
is protected from worry. It is
when he is lured away from it
into the stock market or into
the political whirlpool that he
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


loses his balance. Let each man
stand to his post —that is the best
self-government and the best
national guarantee.
Whether America is doomed
to another cycle of boom and
collapse does not depend on the
government, which can neither
help nor hinder much. It de-
pends upon the intelligence,
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


decency, and self-control of
American businessmen.
There is a certain principle
of business health and growth
essentially American in origin.
By this principle, when profits
appear the businessman thinks
first of giving them to the cus-
tomer, in lower prices or higher
quality; to the workers (who
are also customers), in higher
wages; and to his plant, in im-
proved technique and processes.
Then it is time enough for him
to think of a temperate return
for himself. I have always felt
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


that our first duty was to do the
right thing, and that this would
lead us to money sufficient to
carry the right thing. That is
the way I have found that things
work out.
Following such a course, a
more even tempo for business
is possible. Try to cram too
many business tomorrows into
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


today and you simply lay the
foundation for some doleful to-
morrows.
If businessmen will go sanely
and resolutely ahead with
wealth - production first, fol-
lowed by wealth - sharing
through high wages and low
prices, I think they can stop
worrying about the fantastic
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


doctrines of the time and find
that they are serving society
through these jobs.
Visitors often ask me what
the car of the future will be. I
don’t know. If I did I would
be making it now.
There are, of course, all sorts
of interesting possibilities, and
we are experimenting with most
of them, as are others. Each
new possibility brings with it a
number of engineering prob-
lems which remain to be solved.
One thing is certain: There is
great development ahead for the
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


automobile. It really has not
started yet. People wanted them
so quickly and in such large
numbers that we are only now
getting down to the job of de-
velopment.
I have never forgotten the
first machine I ever saw travel-
ing along a road under its own
power. I was about twelve
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


years old at the time —it must
have been in 1875 —and I was
driving along a country road
near Detroit in my father’s
wagon. It was the kind of steam
engine I had seen before, hauled
around by horses from one farm
to another to drive the threshing
machine or a sawmill. But this
had no horses. It went by it-
self I
The sight fascinated me. In
a jiffy I hopped off the wagon,
ran over to the wonder-machine
and began questioning the
driver. He stopped the ma-
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


chine and showed me proudly
how a chain, running from the
engine back to the rear wheels,
gave them motion.
That machine was heavy, ex-
pensive, cumbersome, jolting,
and made a fearful racket. Yet
how wonderful it seemed sixty
years ago. Just so, many of the
things which seem so wonderful
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


and convenient to us today will
seem absurdly primitive to the
eyes of the year 1995. Anyone
who thinks we have “arrived”
at anything, save the framework
of American life which en-
courages initiative, has much to
learn.
While many businesses have
stagnated in the last few years,
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


science has continued to march
ahead. Consequently there is a
vast job of modernization to be
done in America. For example,
most of the articles we use are
far too heavy. The sheer weight
of things has increased costs
and hindered advancement —
like those old castles abroad
which simply cannot be modern-
ized. With the materials now
available we can replace these
with lighter and superior arti-
cles. Now materials enable us
to discard the theory that only
weight means strength.
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


For another example, there is
the opportunity to decentralize
American industry, with pos-
sible lower costs and certainly
happier working conditions and
greater security. With such a
period of progress ahead, surely
it is foolish to complain that
there is not enough work to
do.
Our best prescription for
prosperity, as I see it, is con-
stantly turning increasing effi-
ciency into lower prices and
higher wages. Business is purely
a service and not a bonanza.
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


The bonanza idea does not work
out in industry any more than
it did in banking. But, even
when this is being done, there
are still some forces working to
throw production and consump-
tion out of balance occasionally.
The machine of distribution
has a “bug” in it somewhere. I
am no economist, but it seems
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


to me the “bug” is in our system
of money and finance. Most
people confuse money with
wealth. Wealth consists of use-
ful goods and services, and
money is merely the paper sym-
bol which is supposed to facili-
tate their constant exchange and
distribution.
When a method is found to
make money do its job properly,
that method will be adopted, and
whether that method is called
socialistic or capitalistic won’t
make any difference.
We frequently hear the ex-
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


pression: “He’s lucky. He’s
fixed for life.” Well, he isn’t.
Any person or business that
thinks, “Now everything is set-
tled,” is in for a jolt. Change
is the law of life.
Life is a going concern. It is
going somewhere. It never
stagnates.
That is one reason I like to
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


watch and talk with the young-
sters at the schools in Greenfield
Village. [This is the village,
re-created in the Early Ameri-
can style by Mr. Ford, where
hundreds of Dearborn children
go to school.]
What I greatly hope for these
children, and for children every-
where, is a new attitude toward
life—free from the gullibility
which thinks we can get some-
thing for nothing; free from the
greed which thinks any perma-
nent good can come of over-
reaching others; and, above all,
THINGS I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT


expectant of change, so that
when life gives them a jolt they
will be fully prepared to push
on eagerly along new lines.
