PREFACE
As an outcome of a public meeting held in Hobart
on Tuesday, August sth, 1919, a Citizens’ Committee was
appointed to consider the High Cost of Living and suggest
remedies. At the request of the public meeting the City
Council appointed three Aldermen to the Committee, the
personnel of which was as follows :
Mr. D. B. COPLAND, M.A., Lecturer in History and Economics,
University of Tasmania, Chairman.
Mr. C. W. WEBBER, Advertising Manager of “ The World,” Secretary.
Alderman W. E. BOTTRILL, M.A., LL.D., Barrister, Hobart.
Alderman J. A. CUTHBERTSON, Boot Importer, Hobart.
Mr. E. DWYER GRAY, Editor of “ The World.”
Alderman C. H. LAMPRILL, President of the Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. A. NEEDHAM, President of the Trades Hall Council.
For the information of all who are interested in so import-
ant a problem, the result of the investigations of the Committee
are set forth in this pamphlet. Chapter I. contains a State-
ment of the Measurement and Movements in Prices in recent
years, Chapter 11. the Interim Report of the Committee on the
Relation of Currency and War Finance to General Price
Movements, Chapter 111. the Final Report of the Com-
mittee, and Chapter IV. the Minority Report by Dr. Bottrill.
In thus submitting the report to the public 1 wish to point
out that the Committee was actuated by the single purpose of
bringing under public review the more important topics con-
nected with the general problem of the Cost of Living. If
such be the result of publication then the Committee’s main
task will have been achieved ; for the suggestions contained in
the report may offer some guidance to public men charged with
the responsibility of legislating in the public interest. These
suggestions are all the more valuable in that they command the
support of men representative of different sections of the com-
munity.

Report of Citizens’ Committee
ON THE
COST OF LIVING
CHAPTER I.
MEASUREMENT AND MOVEMENTS
OF PRICES.
Fluctuations of prices in Australia
have been measured by the Bureau of
Census and Statistics for wholesale
prices in Melbourne since 1861, and
for retail prices in the capital towns
since 1901. From 1913 to 1914 an
investigation into movements in retail
prices in 100 towns was made, and sub-
sequent to 1914 the number of towns
has been increased to 150. Further
definite information on the expendi-
ture of families with varying incomes
is to be found from the results of in-
vestigations made by the Bureau of
Census and Statistics by means of
Householders’ Budget Inquiries in
1911 and 1913. For the purpose of as-
certaining the changes in prices in re-
cent years, more especially since July
1914, it will suffice to consider:
(a) Changes in Wholesale Prices
based upon the Common-
wealth Wholesale Index Num-
ber.
(b) Changes in Retail Prices
based upon the Common-
wealth Retail Index Number.
This may be supplemented by a sum-
mary of the results of the Household-
ers’ Budget Inquiries referred to above
Before dealing with these problems
In detail it is necessary to point out
some of the difficulties of measuring
accurately changes in general prices
and of defining and estimating “the
cost of living.” Changes in general
prices are measured by compounding
changes in individual prices into a gen-
eral index number. Owing to the dif-
ficulty of measuring changes in all in-
dividual prices, commodities represen-
tative of various well-defined groups
are usually chosen for the purpose of
the investigation. This method, when
thoroughly representative commodities
are chosen, gives a tolerably accurate
result for wholesale prices where stan-
dard grades and qualities are obtain-
able. But in the case of retail prices,
as will appear when the retail index
number is under examination, the
method has serious limitations; for, in
the first place, standardised grades are
not obtainable, and consequently stan-
dard retail quotations for the same ar-
ticle are not present over a series of
years; secondly, retail goods fluctuate
rapidly in quality, and are subject to
the influence of changing fashion and
public taste; thirdly, retail prices bear
a markedly local character, and are
not easily comparable from place to
place and time to time. These con-
siderations necessitate great caution
in the use of retail or “cost of living”
index numbers.
The supreme value of an index num-
ber is that it renders easy the mea-
surement of changes in general or in-
dividual prices. The mere tabulation
of actual prices does not afford a con-
venient measure of price changes. For
this purpose the method of index num-
bers has been adopted, and it affords
a comparison of prices which is
thoroughly reliable in that it is an ac-
curate measure of the actual prices
from time to time and place to place.

But it cannot be too frequently stress-
ed that index numbers provide rela-
tive, not actual prices, and that their
use is essentially restricted to pur-
poses of comparison. A further fact
to be borne in mind is that in compil-
ing an index number each commodity
is “weighted” according to its import-
ance by means of some well-defined
standard. For instance, in Australia
“the weight” or “mass unit” employ-
ed is derived from the aggregate ex-
penditure on each commodity. This
provision gives a “weighted” index
number in which changes in individual
commodities are registered according
to their importance.
A.—WHOLESALE PRICES,
The following facts in regard to the
Commonwealth wholesale index num-
ber are of importance:
(1) The prices upon which the in-
dex number is based are Mel-
bourne wholesale prices.
(2) Prior to 1911 the aggregate ex-
penditure on SO commodities in
1911 was taken as base, but
for later years the aggregate
expenditure of 92 commodities
is taken. That is to say, the
total expenditure on the respec-
tive commodities in 1911 was
estimated and equated to 1000.
All other numbers refer to the
relative cost of the same quan-
tities of the commodities at the
prices ruling in the respective
years.
(8) The commodities chosen are
representative of eight groups
of general commodities, which
in turn are representative of
the commodities placed upon
the Melbourne market.
(4) Though local differences are
not provided for, the general
movment in the index number
for Melbourne may be taken as
indicating the general trend in
Hobart.
to) The index number is a toler-
ably accurate measure of gen-
eral wholesale price move-
ments.
The following tables give—(a)
changes in wholesale prices in Mel-
bourne from 1861 to 1918, and (b)
changes in wholesale prices in Mel-
bourne from July, 1914, to March, 1919.

port, No. 9, by the Commonwealth
Statistician.)

OBSERVATIONS ON TABLES I AND
11.
(1) From 1895 to 1913 the index
number rose from 760 to 1088, that is,
the rise in general wholesale prices
was about 43 per cent,
(2) During the war, from July, 1914.
to March, 1919, general prices rose 68
per cent.
(3) The total rise from 1895 to
March, 1919, was from 760 to 1919;
that is, 152 per cent.
(4) During the war, chemicals show-
ed the greatest rise, being followed in
order by building materials; metals
and coal; textiles, leather, etc.; all of
which rose higher than the average l .
The other groups all rose, but the rise
was loss than the average rise. The
observance of this fact is important,
because of the necessity of considering
relative rises in' individual commodi-
ties and their causes, as well as the
causes of rises in the general level of
prices.
It is interesting to observe that the
“Economist” wholesale index number
for England shows a rise from 116.6 in
July, 1914, to 259.4 in March, 1919;
that is, a rise of about 122 per cent.
B.—RETAIL PRICES.—THE COST
OF LIVING.
The following facts regarding the
Commonwealth retail index number
are of importance:
(1) The prices upon which the
index number is based are the
prices of retail goods ruling in
the six capital towns.
(2) Forty-six commodities, together
with house rent, are measured.
The commodities are divided
into four groups as follows:
(a) Groceries 18, (b) dairy pro-
duce 7, (c) Meat 21, and (d)
house rent.
(3) The commodities chosen are
not completely representative
of retail prices, still loss of “the
cost of living,” for clothing and
all kinds of wearing apparel,
footwear, fuel and light, and
numerous other items of ex-
penditure are not represented.
(4) Changes in the quality of the
goods or services are not mea-
sured, and consequently infor-
mation as to “the standard of
living” is incomplete.
(5) In compiling the index number
the weighted aggregate expend-
diture for the whole of the capi-
tal towns in 1911 is taken as
base.
The following tables give (a) move-
ments in “the cost of living” index
number in Hobart from 1901 to 1918,
(b) changes in “the purchasing power
of money” from 1901 to 1918, and (c)
changes in “purchasing power of
money” and cost of living index num-
bers in Hobart from July, 1914, to May,
1919. (See Labor and Industrial
Branch Report, No. 9.)

OBSERVATIONS ON TABLES Ml,
IV, AND V.
(1) Between 1901 and 1918 the cost
of living index number for Hobart rose
from 869 to 1356, that is, a rise of 56
per cent. In the same period food
and groceries rose 62 per cent., and
house rent 43 per cent.
(2) The purchasing power of money
fell by amounts corresponding to the
percentages in (1). Thus what would
oost £1 in 1901 cost 31/2 in 1918. In
other words, compared with 1901, the
pound (£) in 1918 was worth only
12/10.
(3) Food and groceries in Hobart in-
creased by 38.6 per cent, from July.
1914. to May. 1919. Including house
rent, general purchasing power fell
between second quarter, 1914, and first
quarter, 1919. by 30 per cent. There-
fore, compared with second quarter,
1914, the pound (£) in first quarter,
1919, was worth only 15/4.
(4) Comparing Hobart with the
other capital towns, it is found that in
1901 the index number for the cost of
living was third lowest, but in 1918 it
was second highest, being exceeded
only by Sydney.

(5) It must be pointed out, however,
as mentioned above, that the index
number is not representative of all
groups of commodities. For instance,
clothing was not included. Yet in a
report issued in December, 1918, the
Inter-State Commission, after hearing-
evidence on the clothing trade, gave
its opinion that prices had increased
70 per cent, from 1914. Similarly
with boots, up to 1917 the war increase
had been 27.6 per cent. Doubtless
this has increased greatly since then.
(6) In view of these facts, it is al-
most certain that the total cost of liv-
ing has increased by more than 30 per
cent, since July, 1914.
(7) The increase in Australian re-
tail prices is much less than the in-
crease in retail prices in the United
Kingdom, the latter being 120 per cent,
from July, 1914, to March, 1919.
C.—HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS.
The following table shows the pro-
portion of income spent on the dif-
ferent items of exepnditure for in-
comes of varying amounts. This table
gives the general results of an inquiry
into expenditure by the Bureau of Cen-
sus and Statistics, and is based upon
the complete returns of 392 families
for November, 1913.

Table VI is interesting in that it
shows the amounts expended upon the
several items included in the index
number. Thus for the general aver-
age the amount spent on housing and
food was only 53.52, and this repre-
sents in the main the total commodi-
ties included in the index number.
Further, it may be observed that the
smaller the income and the larger the
family the greater is the proportion
spent on essentials, so that in a period
of rapidly rising prices such as has
been experienced during the war, it
may be concluded that small incomes
are swallowed up with the purchase
of necessaries. Another interesting
observation is that the lowest expen-
diture per week in 1913 was £2/11/9.
But the cost of living index number in
1913 for Hobart was 1053, while in the
first quarter 1919 it was 1432; that is
a rise of 36 per cent. Thus the amount
necessary to purchase in 1919 what
would cost £2/11/9 in 1913 is £3/10/5.
The following table gives a compari-
son of various statistics for Hobart.
Table VII sums up the relative posi-
tions of wages and prices. During
the war to December, 1918, the cost of
living rose 26 per cent., but wages
rose only 16 per cent., so that real
wages fell by seven per cent. Retail
prices show a much greater rise than
general cost of living, including house
rent. Thus the total rise in food and
groceries between July, 1914, and June,
1919, was in Hobart 38.3 per cent. Un-
fortunately, statistics of wages are not
obtainable later than December, 1918,
so that it is impossible to measure the
relative position of the worker in rela-
tion to the increases of 38.3 per cent,
in retail prices since July, 1914.
The results obtained from this state-
ment are summarised in Chapter 111,
Pinal Report of the Committee, Section
I.
CHAPTER II.
Interim Report on “The Relation of
Currency and Finance to General
Price Movements.”
His Worship the Mayor,
Town Hall, Hobart.
The Citizens’ Committee appointed
to consider the high cost of living, and
to suggest remedies, has the honor to
submit to you, as chairman of the pub-
lic meeting, at which the Committee
was appointed, an interim report on
“The relation of Currency and Finance
to General Price Movements.” In
doing so it is pointed out that the Com-
mittee considered it necessary at the
outset to seek an explanation of the
recent rapid upward trend of prices,
and among the factors which seem to
have been exercising the most potent


influence the currency and the method
of war finance appeared to be very im-
portant. The report does not claim
to deal exhaustively with the problems
which recent price movements give
rise to, but only to point out what the
committee considers to be vitally im-
portant factors tending to cause a rise
in general prices during the war. The
report may be divided into three parts:
(1) General conclusions regarding
the effect of currency and war
finance on prices.
(2) Measures proposed to restrict
the infleunce of the currency in
causing prices to rise.
(3) Detailed statement regarding
the effect of currency and war
finance on prices.
Parts (1) and (2) are contained in
the Committee’s Final Report, Chap-
ter 111, Sections It and 111 respectively.
lII—DETAILED STATEMENT RE-
GARDING THE EFFECT OF CUR-
RENCY AND WAR FINANCE ON
PRICES.
I,—CURRENCY AND “THE EQUA-
TION OF EXCHANGE.”
Under modern methods of exchange
the value or purchasing power of a.
commodity is measured by reference
to some one commodity chosen as the
measure of value, and known as
money. Value is thus expressed as a
price, and by this means the relative
values of different commodities can
be readily gauged. Money which acts
thus as a common denominator of
values expressed in pi ices has also be-
come' the medium of exchange.
Through the medium of money goods
are exchanged against each other, and
the total value of the exchanges in
a market in any given time will be
equal to the amount of goods bought
and sold, multiplied by their several
prices. This must also be equivalent
to the total amount of money in the
market, multiplied by its rate of turn-
over or velocity of circulation. At
ordinary times the total amount of
money (conveniently expressed as cur-
rency) consists of (a) the amount of
gold in circulation, multiplied by its
rate of turnover, together with (b)
the amount of credit money (bank
notes, bills of exchange, cheques), mul-
tiplied by its velocity of circulation.
(Report of Cost of Living Commission
in New Zealand, 1912, HIS, p. XXXV).
By means of this total quantity of cur-
rency there is exchanged a certain'
quantity of goods. Consequently the
total currency (the amount of legal
tender money, multiplied by its velo-
city of circulation, plus the amount of
credit, multiplied by its velocity of
circulation) is equal to the total
amount of the goods multiplied by
their respective prices. The general
level of prices, or the average prices,
must therfore be equal to the total cur-
rency, divided by the total quantities
of goods exchanged. This is a simple
statement of what Professor Irving
Fisher, of Yale University, calls “the
equation of exchange.’’ It may be
stated more clearly by reference to
the mathematical language adopted by
Professor Fisher, as follows:
Suppose that M represents the
amount of actual money.
V represents the velocity of circula-
tion of M.
N represents the amount of credit
money.
Y represents the velocity of circu-
lation of N.
T represents the quantity of goods
or the volume of trade.
and P represents the general level
of prices.
Then, MV - : - NY is equal to PT.
MV -(- NY.
Therefore, P is equal to
T
Thus the general factors affecting
the price level at any time are (i) the
amount of money in circulation, (ii)
the velocity of its circulation, (iii) the
amount of credit in circulation, (iv)
the velocity of its circulation, and (v)
the volume of trade. A change in
any one of these factors will, other
things being equal, produce a corre-
sponding change in the general price
level. Referring again to the mathe-
matical symbols, we can lay down the
general principle that increases in
M, V, N, or Y will, other things remain-
ing the same, increase P, while in-
creases in T will tend to decrease P.
Briefly put, the general level of prices
is the quotient when the total currency
is divided by the total trade, and
changes in general prices will always
be associated with changes in total
currency or total trade.

2.—INFLUENCE OF GOLD.
Now, in normal times the amount
of credit is always dependent up-
on the amount of money proper,
1.e., gold; for gold, being the only
unlimited legal tender, forms the
financial reserve upon which banks
build up their superstructure of
credit, and the amount of this reserve
ultimately sets the limit to the degree
to which banks can create credit.
Thus the supplies of gold determine
the rate of credit expansion, and con-
sequently the amount of currency in
existence. It is in this way that the
gold supplies of the world influence
the general level of prices, and it may
be said that increases in gold supplies,
other things being equal, increase
prices, while the converse is true. The
supplies of gold are thus intimately
related to movements in prices, and
as long as gold is used as the money
material it must influence the general
level of prices. Before the war it
formed the foundation of our whole
monetary system, and obviously
changes in the quantity produced ne-
cessarily affected the total currency,
and through this prices.
Statistical evidence to support this
thesis is not wanting. Throughout
history prices have steadily risen,
though there have been periods of fall-
ing prices. Writing in 1911, Professor
Fisher concluded that prices had in-
creased tenfold in a thousand years,
and from four to six times since 1200-
1500. (Purchasing Power of Money,
p. 234.) He also shows that increases
were most pronounced in those periods
such as the sixteenth century, when
new supplies of the precious metals
were being mined and transported to
Europe. But during the last century
price movements have been measured
more accurately, and the amount of
gold produced annually is known with
more certainty. Since 1789 the main
movements in prices and the stock of
gold have bee n as follows:
In this table the effect of the gold
discoveries in the middle of the cen-
tury, and again in the early nineties,
may be observed. It is interesting to
note that during the period 1873-96,
when prices in gold-using countries
were falling, prices in silver-using
countries actually rose. For instance,
the rise in prices in India in this period
was 31 per cent., in Japan 28 per cent.,
and in China 9 per cent. (Fisher, p.
243.) These rises, of course, were
due to the plethora of silver which fol-
lowed on the increased production of
that metal and its demonetisation in
many leading countries. The relation
between supplies of gold and the move-
ments in prices between 1865 and
1910 are shown in more detail in the
following table;

From this table it is seen that fluc-
tuations in the production of gold have
a close connection with general prices,
but that changes in the former precede
changes in the latter. Thus the gold
output was increasing from 1885, but
prices did not rise until 1895. This
is explained by the fact that the in-
creasing output per annum is small
relative to the total quantities in exist-
ence. Hence generally, changes in
the output of gold are not accompanied
by corresponding changes in general
price movements for a period.
The effect of the gold supply on
prices may then be stated as follows:
Prior to the war, gold was the basis of
the monetary systems of the great
countries of the world, increases in
gold supplies causing increases in total
currency, which, other things being
equal, caused prices to rise. When-
ever the annual production of gold was
more than was required to meet the
losses caused by wear and tear of the
existing coinage, the amount required
for industrial purposes, and the addi-
tional amount required owing to the
steady expansion in the volume of
trade, then there was a general ten-
dency for prices to rise. Thus in
1913 the gold production of the world
reached the prodigious figure of nearly
£92,700,000, and this may be said to
have been more than was required for
the purposes mentioned above —hence
the surplus, which was annually in-
creasing prices. It was generally
(though not universally) thought be-
fore the war that the output of gold
was approaching a maximum, and that
it would soon decrease, causing a re-
duction ultimately in the level of
prices. This is now supported by the
general difficulties which are being ex-
perienced in connection with gold pro-
duction and the probability of decreas-
ing output. It may therefore be con-
cluded that if the nations adopt the
gold standard again there will be a
general fall in prices at no distant
date. It is difficult to measure accu-
rately the influence of gold in Austra-
lia, but the amount of gold coin and
bullion held by the banks increased
from £19,780,528 in 1901 to £31,252,066
in 1913, i.e., an increase of 58 per cent.
But the amount of gold in circulation
is not known, though it is not an un-
reasonable deduction that it increased
in the same period by the same per-
centage as the gold reserves of banks.
3. CREDIT. But, as mentioned
above, there are other factors affecting
the price level. Chief among these
is the amount of credit, through which
by far the greatest number of mone-
tary transactions are conducted. Banks
have the power of creating credit, and,
though before the war this credit was
limited by the reserve of notes, and
ultimately of gold, this gold was in-
creasing so quickly that it was possi-
ble for banks to indulge in a great ex-
pansion of credit. Even before the
war there was thus a rapid increase in
the deposits of banks in Australia, as
the following table shows;
The striking feature about this table
is the constancy of the figures in
column 111, showing that the ratio of
reserves to total deposits is more or
less fixed by bank practice. It is
equally important to note the expan-
sion of credit in the same period by
over £58,000,000, i.e., by 64 per cent.
Such a rapid expansion of currency
would have, of necessity, some con-
siderable influence on . prices.

4. CIRCULATION. Of the two
other factors on the currency side of
“the equation of exchange,” viz., the
velocity of circulation of money proper
and the velocity of the circulation of
credit, we cannot speak with any cer-
tainty as to the actual changes. But
the general influences to which these
factors arc subject are (i) the tendency
to increased thrift or extravagance,
(ii) the method of wage payment,
(iii) the system of shop credit, (iv)
closer settlement and urbanisation, (v)
facilities of transport and communi-
cation, and (vi) familiarity with mone-
tary transactions. All of these factors
were operating before the war to in-
crease the velocity of circulation. Thus
there w r as probably less thrift, wages
were paid more frequently, shop credit
was allowed to a greater extent, coun-
try lands were more closely settled,
and cities and towns had grown more
populous, the facilities for communi-
cation and transportation had undoubt-
edly increased, while people generally
had become more familiar with ex-
change operations. Hence there was
a general increase in the velocity of
circulation, so that the total currency
increased by considerably more than
64 per cent., the amount of increase
in credit money.
5. PRODUCTION. On the whole,
it may be said, therefore, that the cur-
rency side of the equation increased
greatly between 1901 and 1913. At
the same time the volume of trade in-
creased, bat to a less extent. Thus
the total value of production in 1901
is estimated at £114,585,000, while in
1914 it was £209,485,000. In the same
period wholesale prices rose about 18
per cent. Eliminating the amount due
to increased prices, we obtain an esti-
mated increase in production of 55 per
cent. (It may be noted that even in
the year 1913, which was a year of ex-
traordinary productivity, amounting in
all to over £218,000,000, and bringing
about a fall in wholesale prices, so
that the price level of 1913 over 1901
was only 12 per cent, higher, the in-
crease in production over 1901 was
only 68 per cent.) Thus it is seen
that, while the total currency increas-
ed at least 64 per cent., and allowing
for increased velocity considerably
more, total production increased about
55 per cent., and at most 68 per cent,
from 1901 to 1913.
6. THE EQUATION OF EX-
CHANGE IN THE UNITED STATES.
—lt is impossible to measure accurate-
ly the influence of the several factors in
the “equation of exchange,” though it
is a work which should be undertaken
in Australia as soon as possible. For
America we have some interesting
figures available from the investiga-
tons of Professor Irving Fisher, who
is now generally recognised as a world
authority on currency questions. His
figures are as follows:

7. GENERAL CONCLUSION AS
TO CURRENCY INFLUENCE BE-
FORE THE WAR—Between 1896 and
1913 the money in circulation doubled,
the credit money trebled, the velocity
of circulation of money increased 11
per cent., and of credit 47 per cent.,
while the volume of trade increased
138 per cent. Thus the increase in
the volume of trade was outstripped
by Lhe increase in the other factors,
and consequently prices rose 74 per
cent.
What was true of America may veil
be true of Australia, and it may now
be concluded that prior to the war the
increased gold supplies, both diiecay
and indirectly, through credit money,
had tended to increase general prices
and “the erst of living,” and, in fact,
was the rutin cause of the rise in the
‘cost of living.” The exact influence
of this factor in the past is very i:n
portant, for soon nations will be
considering a return to the gold stan-
dard, in which case there may be a
period cf falling prices. From the
Committee's point of view it is of vital
importance, when the remedial mea-
sures to be proposed for reducing ihe
cost of living are under discussion. It
must be pointed out, however, that the
velocity cf circulation and the amount
ot credit money have a very import-
ant influence on prices. The velocity
of circulation of credit may increase
so rapidly as to cause rising prices,
and from Table XI we may observe
that there was an actual increase of
47 per cent, between 1896 and 1913.
Similarly an expansion of credit might
inflate the price level, but on the whole,
where the gold standard is in opera-
tion the supply of gold forms the basis
of the expansion of credit, and sets
the limit to such expansion.
8. EFFECT OF THE WAR ON
THE GOLD STANDARD.—WhiIe the
gold supplies exerted such influence
prior to 1914, the war conditions have
materially altered the whole position.
Belligerents have either legally, or in
practice, suspended gold payments,
supplanting them by the use of money
notes, which are practically inconver-
tible. These money notes form the
basis of the bank reserves, just as for-
merly gold did. Now, since increases
in the issue of money notes occasion
little difficulty, the reserves of notes at
banks have been increased very great-
ly, thus facilitating the expansion of
credit, which has been very rapid in
all countries since 1914. At the same
time, the loan policy of war finance
adopted by all Governments has en-
couraged the growth of credit by the
policy practised by banks of making
advances to investors in the war loans.
9. PAPER MONEY AND CREDIT.
—Undoubtedly the enormous issue of
Commonwealth notes has operated to
increase prices. At the end of 1913
under £10,000,000 notes were issued,
but by March, 1919, this had increased
to £56,445,829. It is true that the gold
reserve was kept within the statutory
limit, being actually 41.27 per cent, in
March of this year. But the bulk of
these notes were held by banks, and
used as a legal tender reserve upon
which to base an expansion of credit.
The following table shows how this
credit expansion has proceeded.


Bank deposits thus increased by 60
per cent, (the wholesale price index
number rising 77 per cent.), while at
the same time the percentage of re-
serve to total deposits op the whole
increased, though It fluctuated con-
siderably, due, no doubt, to the flota-
tion of huge war loans. It is there-
fore a reasonable conclusion that in-
creases in the issue of Commonwealth
notes have caused a rise in general
prices. The experience of other coun-
tries has been the same. Professor
Shield Nicholson found a remarkable
similarity between the price level and
the amount of currency notes issued
in England (Nicholson, War Finance,
114), while Professor Irving Fisher
finds similar correspondence between
money supplies and prices in America.
It is further found that “since the war
there has been a close correspondence
(between money supplies and prices),
changes in the price level following
changes in the money by two or three
months.” (Fisher, quoted by Nichol-
son, 81.) This is a striking proof of
the contention that issues of money
notes greatly influenced the price level.
But it should be pointed out that,
owing to the increased prices of Aus-
tralian imports and exports consequent
upon general inflation abroad, there
might have been an increase in prices,
necessitating an increase in currency.
But, since foreign trade is but a frac-
tion of home trade, this Influence does
not destroy, but only slightly modifies
the general contention that the infla-
tion of currency was an important fac-
tor in causing rising prices.
10. WAR FINANCE. But the
methods of war finance have been
equally important in causing general
Inflation. There is a general con-
sensus of opinion among economic au-
thorities that the loan method has been
far too frequently employed by Gov-
ernments seeking to obtain supply to
carry on the war. Loans raise prices,
increase the cost of the war, raise the
cost of living, and tend to perpetuate
the inequalities in the distribution of
w T ealth. Professor Pigou thinks that
the loan policy “gives to income and
property a far higher degree of con-
sideration relative to life than is ac-
corded them in times of peace.” (Eco-
nomic Journal, March, 1917, p. 16, “The
Economics of the War Loan”) Profes-
sor Nicholson considers that “the root
cause of the Inflation of the currency
has no doubt been the great expansion
of the Government credit . . . The
growth of bank deposits does not mean
increased savings, but increased credit
advances. ... If the inflation of
the currency continues, the rise of
prices will also continue” (War Fi-
nance, 107). Other authorities may
be quoted, but the general conclusion
can be stated that large issues of
paper money and public borrowing for
war purposes on a large scale have in-
creased the amount of currency at a
greater rate than production, and con-
sequently prices have risen. Ref-
erence to Table XI shows that in
U.S.A. from June, 1914, to December,
1918, money in circulation increased
by 18 per cent., credit by 45 per cent.,
velocity of circulation of money by 76
per cent., and of credit by 100 per cent.,
while production increased only 53 per
cent., thus causing prices to rise by
91 per cent. There is no doubt that
similar factors have been in progress
in Australia. In the first place, it has
been estimated that before the war the
gold coin in circulation had a value of
about £6,000,000, while notes were held
by the public to a value of £5,000,000,
making a total of £11,000,000. At pre-
sent the value of Australian notes held
by the public is about £20,000,000, mak-
ing an increase of S 2 per cent. We
have already seen that credit expanded
by 60 per cent., and no doubt there has
been a quicken! ng in the velocity of
circulation. According to the Fed-
eral Budget of 1918 the war debt of
Australia was estimated to be
£287,000,000 by June, 1919, and out of
revenue since the war began only
£46,000,000 had beer paid, i.e., a pro-
portion of 16 per cent. It must be
remembered that a great proportion of
war expenditure should be met out of
national income, not being chargeable
to capital expenditure. For instance,
it is frequently forgotten that all those
engaged directly in war services were
formerly clothed and fed out of the
nation’s income, and there is no rea-
son why this course should not be ad-
hered to in time of war. These pay-
ments are thus a claim upon taxation,
but during the past four years they
have been met out of loans, and no


doubt such a practice has created an
artificial prosperity, encouraging a
more rapid velocity of circulation than
would otherwise have taken place.
11. PRODUCTION DURING WAR.
—Now, while all the factors on the
currency side have been increasing, it
is found that the movements in pro-
duction have not corresponded with
these increases. Prom 1914 to 1917
(the last year for which statistics are
available) production increased from
£218,000,000 to £270,000,000, and in the
same period wholesale prices rose 38
per cent. Allowing for this increase
in prices, the production valued at the
prices ruling in 1913 was worth only
£196,000,000. It is probable that produc-
tion has now reached the 1913 level,
but with very much increased currency
a rise in prices was an inevitable re-
sult. Such a rise, however, was not
due, generally speaking, to a decreas-
ed production, but rather to the infla-
tion of the currency.
CHAPTER III.
FINAL REPORT.
His Worship the Mayor, Town Hall,
Hobart. —
The Citizens’ Committee appointed
to consider the high cost of living, and
suggest remedies, has the honor to
submit to you, as chairman of the pub-
lic meeting at which the committee
was appointed, its final report. The
committee has already 'published a
statement, setting forth the main
movements of prices and wages in
Australia in recent years, and has
issued an interim report on the rela-
tions of currency and finance to gen-
eral price movements. The main con-
clusions and recommendations of
these are embodied in this, its final,
report.
The committee consisted of Messrs.
D. B. Copland, E. Dwyer Gray, C. W.
Webber, and A. Needham, as repre-
senting the public meeting at which
the committee was appointed, and Al-
dermen C. H. Lamprill. W. E. Bottrill,
and J. A. Cuthbertson, representing
the City Council.
Mr. Webber was appointed at the
first meeting of the committee in place
of Mr. S. Champ, who was unable to
attend owing to other business. Mr.
Needham resigned from the committee
on departing from the State, and Mr.
Cuthbertson, owing to pressure of
business, -was able to attend only two
meetings of the committee. Mr. Need-
ham acted as secretary of the com-
mittee, and on his resignation Mr.
Webber was appointed in his place.
Major L. F. Giblin was added to the
committee on the nomination of Mr.
Needham, but owing to pressure of
other work was obliged to resign.
This report may bo divided into
three sections:
1. Measurement and Movements
of Prices.
2. Causes of Increase of Prices.
3. Remedial Measures.
The committee wishes to point out
that it has not had the powers of a
Royal Commission or other body
which could effectively investigate pro-
fits or attempt to decide what rises in
prices are due to general causes be-
yond the control of the State, and
what rises are due to particular or
local causes, including combinations
or other influences inimical to the pub-
lic interest. The committee regrets
that the Government did not appoint
a Royal Commission, as suggested by
the committee at its first meeting, or
give the committee any powers of a
Royal Commission. Though the com-
mittee was able to call to its assist-
ance a number of witnesses
from the business community,
it was possible to deal with the prob-
lem in a genera! way only. It is of
the opinion, however, that the Govern-
ment should take steps to investigate
more thoroughly the causes of the in-
creased cost of living, in order to as-
certain whether local profiteering has
been practiced.
GENERAL FACTS.
I. MEASUREMENT AND MOVEMENT
OF PRICES
The committee came to the follow-
ing conclusions regarding the measure-
ment and movement of prices in re-
cent years:—
1. Certain precautions must be ob-
served in calculating movements in


prices and wages by means of index
numbers.
2. Wholesale prices in Australia
rose from 1595 to 1913 by 43 per cent.,
and from July, 1914, to March, 1919, by
68 per cent.
3. Wholesale prices in the United
Kingdom from July, 1914, to March,
1919, increased by about 122 per cent.
4. The cost of living index number
in Australia rose from 1901 to 1918 by
56 per cent., and from July, 1914, to
May, 1919, retail prices rose by at
least 38.6 per cent, and, including
house rent, the cost of living, accord-
ing to index number, rose by 30 per
cent.
5. The purchasing power of money
in Australia fell between 1901 and
1918. In the latter year the pound
(£), in comparison with its value in
1901, was worth only 12/10. From
July, 1914, to March, 1919, the pound
(£) diminished in its comparative
value by about 4/7.
6. Retail prices in the United King-
dom increased by about 120 per cent,
from July, 1914, to March, 1919.
7. In 1913, according to the House-
hold Budgets, the average expenditure
in Australia of families with four or
less than four members in the lowest
group (income under £3 per week) was
£2/11/9, but by March, 1919, the cost
of living had increased by at least 30
per cent., so that to maintain the same
standard of living it would have been
necessary to spend £3/10/5. But the
average adult wage for males in Tas-
mania in December, 1918, was only
£3/1/2. Thus the standard of living
must be falling.
8. Real wages have fallen in Ho-
bart, according to the official valua-
tion, about 7 per cent, at least since
July, 1914, but, owing to the exclusion
in the cost of living index number of
certain commodities, the prices of
which have risen very greatly, it is
highly probable that the cost of living
has risen more than is indicated by
official figures. Consequently real
wages have probably fallen more than
7 per cent.
From these general facts it is clear-
ly established that:- —
1. There has been a very great
increase in the cost of living since
the outbreak of war.
2. The rise in wages has not been
in the same ratio as the increase in
prices.
3. Consequently all classes-of the
community, particularly the wage
earners, whose incomes have not ad-
vanced proportionately with the
high prices, have suffered hardship
in meeting the increased cost of the
necessaries of life.
4. In view of the fact that prices
have increased considerably more
than wages, it is prohable that the
profits of industry have been increas-
ed by the rising prices.
11. CAUSES OF THE INCREASE OF
PRICES
The committee has ’’nvestigated in
some detail the relation of currency
and war finance to general price move-
ments, and its conclusions, as set out
in the interim report on this subject
are as follow:
1. If M represents the quantity of
money
V represents the velocity of cir-
culation of M,
N represents the quantity of
credit,
Y represents the velocity of cir-
culation of N,
T represents the quantity of
goods or the volume of trade,
and
P represents the general level of
prices,
then the factors affecting the gen-
eral level of prices may be
shown by the following equa-
tion: —
MV -I- NY
P is equal to
T
In other words, the total currency
for any year is equal to the total
amount of goods exchanged, multiplied
by their respective prices. If. then,
the currency increases, or the volume
of trade decreases, there will ho a ten-
dency tor prices to rise.
2. During the war the currency has
increased in a greater ratio than the
volume of trade has increased.
3. Before the war gold was the
basis of the currency, and the supply
of gold had a large determining influ-
ence on general prices.


4. The war has, in practice, tempor-
arily abolished the gold standard, and
nations have increased their issues of
paper money enormously, thus permit-
ting an expansion of credit, while at
the same time the loan policy adopted
by Governments has tended to inflate
prices. These have been vitally im-
portant factors, causing a rise in gen-
eral prices, and they have been opera-
tive in Australia.
5. Annual gold supplies in the
world before the war appeared to be
approaching a maximum. Should
Governments return to the gold stan-
dard a fall in the general level of
prices may be expected.
6. The influence of the currency
can be considered in relation to gen-
eral prices only, and explain merely
the broad general movements in prices.
There is no uniform rise in prices; for
commodities are subject in varying
degrees to contract, custom, and law,
while conditions affecting demand and
supply vary with different commodities
at different times in different places.
This study of currency is a necessary
preliminary study of price movements
for “every price of an individual ar-
ticle presupposes a price level.” After
having fully determined the general
factors responsible for the “general
price level,” we must proceed to con-
sider factors influencing individual prices.
7. This explanation of general price
movements does not attempt to deal
with the important economic and
social effects resulting from the opera-
tion of such influences as an inflated
note issue or the methods of war
finance adopted by Governments. The
merits and demerits of rising prices
and the relative positions of profits
and wages give rise to problems which
must be considered after general price
movements have been explained. In
particular, rising prices have import-
ant effects upon the several classes of
the community not to be wholly ex-
plained by an analysis of these rising
prices, and certainly not to be justified
by such an analysis.
The committee also suggests the fol-
lowing factors as tending to increase
the cost of living:
I—THE INCREASED COST OF PRO-
DUCTION OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS.
Evidence was tendered to the com-
mittee to the effect that the cost of
production in rural industries has con-
siderably increased in recent years.
Though this does not wholly deter-
mine the price o£ farm products (as
pointed out in section IV below), it is
certain that any such increase in the
cost of production of farm products
tends to raise the cost of living.
lI—THE OWNERSHIP OF LAND.
The committee has examined the
statistics showing the sizes of the hold-
ings of land in Tasmania, and it is of
the opinion that the general distribu-
tion of land is not consistent with the
maximum production that might be ob-
tained in rural pursuits. It was
stated by witnesses that a compara-
tively small holding upon which mixed
farming is practised provides the most
efficient method of production in those
areas which are suitable for such cul-
tivation. At present much of this
land is held in areas too large to per-
mit of intensive cultivation. This
tends to diminish the output of rural
produce, and thus to increase the cost
of living.
lII RURAL DEPOPULATION.
It is thought that the present move-
ment of population to urban centres is
not in the best interests of the com-
munity. The general causes of this
movement appear to have been the in-
creased demand for labor In the cities,
the higher rate of real wages offered,
the difficulty married country workers
meet in finding suitable housing ac-
commodation, the failure to stimulate,
through education, a widespread in-
terest on the part of the community in
rural life, and the difficulty of obtain-
ing land in suitable areas and locali-
ties. The results of the movement
have been: (a) to create a scarcity of
skilled agricultural labor, (b) to re-
tard the development of rural produc-
tion, and (c) to increase prices through
the increased velocity of circulation of
money.
IV— EXPORT OF TASMANIAN
PRODUCTS.
The market for Tasmanian products
abroad has tended to raise the price of
that part of the supply consumed at
home. In this way the prices of the
commodities in the Tasmanian mar-
kets are determined by the prices rul-
ing in the export market. The prices
of many of the staple products of Tas


mania in the world’s markets have in-
creased greatly during the war, and
this has been one of the chief factors
tending to increase the prices of the
same commodities in the local mar-
kets.
V—THE FISCAL SYSTEM.
The tariff in Australia has tended
to increase the prices of Imports by
the amount of the duties paid, and
since these imports are in many cases
but a small portion of the amount of
the commodities consumed in the
Commonwealth, the prices of the whole
supply have been raised considerably.
In this way the tariff has increased the
cost of living. It has further stressed
the importance of manufactures, while
the primary industries have not re-
ceived the same attention and encour-
agement. Whether the disadvantages
thus arising are adequately offset by
the grow-th of the manufacturing in-
dustries and the maintenance of a re-
latively high standard of living has not
been thoroughly examined by the com-
mittee, but it may be said that, in so
far as import duties are necessary to
maintain this standard of living, the
whole community pays for it in en-
hanced prices of secondary commodi-
ties. In these circumstances the pri-
mary industries are forced to assist in
the maintenance of the protected in-
dustries.
VI—MONOPOLIES, TRUSTS, AND
LOCAL COMBINATIONS.
The committee was unable to inves-
tigate these problems, and therefore
cannot make any pronouncement upon
this topic. It would point out, how-
ever, that the investigations of the
Inter-State Commission into the prices
of commodities on the mainland shows
that in some important industries
monopolies exist, and excessive profits
have been made. The committee con-
siders that the extension of these in-
vestigations to Hobart would have the
effect of providing information on the
general question of “profiteering.”
VII—DISTRIBUTION OF COMMODI-
TIES.
The increased cost of living is in
part due to the high increases in the
cost of distribution, owing to (a) in-
creased railway and shipping rates,
(b) the excessive numbers of those en-
gaged in distributing work, and (c)
the duplication of existing distribut-
ing agencies.
VIII—NATIONAL WASTE.
National waste involved in extrava-
gant living, public extravagance, the
rapid changes of fashion, the large
number of non-productive works, and
the limitation of output has been a
contributing factor.
The committee was unable, ow-
ing to lack of time and funds,
and its limited powers, to ex-
amine thoroughly the above topics
and to measure accurately the
increases in the cost of living due to
them. It suggests them as factors
increasing the cost of living, and
urges that the fullest public considera-
tion be given to them.
111. REMEDIAL MEASURES
In proposing measures designed to
reduce the cost of living the commit-
tee has attempted to keep three im-
portant objects in view:
(a) The possibility of checking
the increase in prices without hard-
ship to business interests or restrict-
ing production.
(b) The desirability of relieving
those sections of the community
which have suffered hardship
through the rapid rise of prices
causing a fall in the real wages they
receive.
(c) The necessity for suggesting
such general changes in financial
and economic policy as may conduce
to increased general prosperity with-
out increasing the cost of living.
The committee stresses the import-
ance of these facts, and calls attention
to the general decreases in real wages,
which have accompanied the war, in-
volving a very heavy burden upon the
wage-earning section of the commu-
nity. The continuance of this situa-
tion is plainly undesirable, and is
fraught with disaster unless relieved.
The committee urges the earnest con-
sideration of the Government to the
problem, and suggests that the follow-
ing remedial measures should be ex-
amined, with a view to attaining the
objects mentioned above.


1— CURRENCY AND FINANCE.
1. Measures proposed to restrict
the influence of the currency in caus-
ing prices to rise:
(a) The committee is of the opinion
that the earnest consideration of the
Commonwealth Government should be
given to the question of resuming the
practice of redeeming the Common-
wealth notes in gold at the Common-
wealth Treasury. it is thought that
such a measure would have the effect
of causing a contraction of credit, and
consequently bringing about a fall in
general prices. But while the obli-
gations to pay Commonwealth notes
on demand is thus recommended, the
committee considers that, should there
be an early resumption of the internal
circulation of gold coin, such a de-
velopment might undoubtedly severely
tax the Commonwealth gold reserves,
and occasion serious financial conse-
quences. At first, it is thought, the
provision for the redemption of the
notes could be confined to purposes of
export under license.
(b) Secondly, the committee recom-
mends an early abandonment on the
part of the Commonwealth Govern-
ent of the policy of heavy borrowing.
Such a policy has undoubtedly played
a very important part in causing prices
to rise, and in the opinion of the com-
mittee should be supplanted by a
policy of heavier taxation. It is point-
ed out, however, that there are sev-
eral forms of capital expenditure con-
nected with repatriation which may
justify a loan, though the greatest care
should be exercised that such a loan
is not used to defray such current ex-
penditure as is a legitimate claim up-
on revenue. Capital expenditure used
for the purposes of settling soldiers in
rural and urban pursuits, apart from
providing for those who, by their ex-
ample in enlisting, have merited
special consideration, will ultimately
tend to increase the nation’s income.
For this reason a loan for repatriation
may be justifiable, and the committee
wishes in no way to lessen public in-
terest in the present loan. We quote,
however, the report of the committee
of the British Government on Cur-
rency and Foreign Exchanges after the
War, 1918, as follows: “If a sound
monetary position is to be re-estabiish-
ed, and the gold standard to be effec-
tively maintained, it is in our judg-
ment essential that Government bor-
rowings should cease at the earliest
possible moment after the war.”
(c) A third remedial measure, aud
one closely connected with the one
just mentioned, is the discouragement
of the “borrow and buy'’ policy in the
matter of Australian war stock or
war loan bends. A committee of the
American Economic Association on
War Finance remarks: "The mau
who borrows to buy liberty bonds,
and carries the bonds indefinitely by
means off bank loans renders very
little service to the nation.” Though
the position is not exactly similar in
Australia, there can be little doubt
that the practice adopted by banks
(no doubt with a view to assisting the
Government) of making advances at
low rates of interest to war loan in-
vestors has caused inflation. The
committee considers that this prac-
tice should be abandoned as soon as
possible.
(d) With a view to restricting the
present tendency to undue credit ex-
pansion tile banks shou.d adopt a
more conservative policy by raising,
if necessary, their rates of interest,
aud by discriminating between pro-
jects which are likely to promote the
national welfare aud those which do
not. Extravagance, pubic and pri-
vate, might be thus discouraged, and
much nou-productive work checked,
lu times of national crises some at-
tempt should lie made to prevent the
expenditure of capital upon industries
which do not add to the nation’s
wealth, aud banks having a social
duty to perform night require some-
thing other than mere financial sound-
ness as a criterion for advancing
money.
(e) A fifth recommendation con-
cerns tile question of gold production.
The committee considers that no
bonus should be given by tile Govern-
ment for the product'on of gold, and
that the price of £3/17/101 per oz,, be
adhered to.
(f) The committee is of the opinion
that tile closer study of currency and
general economic problems is an
urgent necessity in Tasmania aud
Australia generally. Some attempts
should be made to measure “the equa-
tion of exchange” for Australia in or-
der to learn (die precise influence of
currency on prices. Moreover it is


thought that consideration should be
given to proposals urged by financial
authorities elsewhere “to stabilise
the sovereign.
(g) Finally, for the purpose of ex-
amining such recommendations and
considering what other steps should be
taken to restore the currency to its
pre-war position, the committee urges
the appointment by the Common-
wealth Government of an impartial
and expert committee on finance.
2—WAGES.
(a) The committee is of the opinion
that immediate steps should be taken
to ascertain a basic family wage on
the basis of present prices, and that
this basic wage be fixed as the mini-
mum -wage.
(b) This minimum wage might then
vary monthly or quarterly, with varia-
tions in the cost of living. Simple
machinery through cither the State
Statistician’s Department or the In-
dustrial Department could be devised
for the purpose of registering this
automatic change of wages with
prices.
(c) The varying awards for differ-
ences in skill could then be determined
accordingly by the wages boards.
(d) It is not intended that this
regulation of wages should be rigid,
for with industrial progress the out-
put per head in industry should in-
crease and wages rates should rise
with this industrial progress irrespec-
tive of changes in the cost of living.
For the purpose of reviewing file
minimum wage, the committee con-
siders that the present wages board
system should be maintained. It also
gives its opinion that the wages board
system tends to promote better rela-
tions between employer and em-
ploye, and might with advantage be
extended on the lines of the Whitley
scheme.
(e) For the purpose of establishing
uniform wages conditions throughout
the Commonwealth, the committee
considers that the State Government
should co-operate in any attempt to
fix a basic wage for Commonwealth
industries as a whole.
(f) Owing to the present high cost
of living, the committee cons’ders
that the exemption limit from State
Income tax should be considerably
raised on income from personal exer-
tion
The committee is of the opinion
that the adoption of these measures
would not merely be just to that sec-
tion of the community which is suf-
fering undue hardship from the pre-
sent rise in prices, but it would also
allay a very considerable part of the
present industrial unrest.
3.—PRICES AND THE CONTROL OF
INDUSTRY.
For the purposes of protecting con-
sumers against possible unduly high
charges by traders and of providing
information on the marketing and
distributing of commodities, the com-
mittee suggests the appointment of a
Board of Trade with the fo.lowing
functions:—
(a) Investigation of supplies and
prices of commodities.
(b) As a result of such investigation
the right to fix prices.
In the opinion of the committee any
successful attempt to fix prices under
these conditions, must as far as pos-
sible deal thoroughly with an industry
in all its several branches and should
give every consideration to the special
difficulties and vital importance of
primary production.
(c) Adjudication in the matter of
rents.
(d) Provision of information on
markets.
(e) Investigation into complaints
made by consumers against unjust
charges, or combinations inimical to
the public interest.
(f) Consideration of what other
measures are advisable in the public
interest to bring about a fall in the
cost of living.
Such a Board of Trade, fully em-
powered by the Government to carry
out the above functions, would Ibe of
value, not merely for its efforts in
prohibiting unduly high charges
but for the information on
general trade conditions it would
provide for the business com-
munity and the public gene-
rally. Additional value rises from
the fact that such a body would be
easily adaptable to changing condi-
tions and circumstances. The com-
mittee is of the opinion that this is
necessary m any scheme for the con-
trol of industry: for, otherwise, busi-
ness would be fettered and initiative
stifled with serious consequences to
the community.


4.—RURAL PRODUCTION.
Recognising the vital connection be-
tween the production of primary pro-
ducts and the cost of living, the com-
mittee considers tfliat any factor cal-
culated to increase rural production
will tend to decrease the cost of liv-
ing, while at the same time increas-
ing general prosperity. It therefore
urges that rural producers should he
encouraged, ami .that steps should he
taken to ensure that all lauds are be-
ing devoted to their best purposes in
production. With a view to achieving
these objects it suggests that consid-
eration be given to the following mat-
ters :
(a) A SOIL SURVEY.
The Department of Agriculture, or
other constituted authority, might take
a survey of the laud in Tasmania with
reference to the six following matters-
— (1) Climatic conditions; (2) condi-
tions of surface; (3) geological origin;
(4) physical and chemical characters;
(o) flora, native and introduced; and
s(6) recognised eoonomS'c adaptation.
In such a way the land could be classi-
fied according to the nature of pro-
duction for which it is best fitted,
and this would render more easy the
task of devising a land policy best
suited to the capacity of the State.
(b) CLOSER SETTLEMENT.
As the relatively small mixed farm
is the most productive unit in agricul-
tural land, the rapid extension of
closer settlement would increase pro-
duction.
(c) FROZEN MEAT TRADE.
The policy of mixed farming where
agricultural and pastoral pursuits are
combined would doubtless encourage
the frozen meat industry in Tasmania.
Tlhe development of this industry
would be further stimulated by the
provision for cool storage and freez-
ing works. In these matters
the State might assist by ad-
vancing capital on easy terms, while
the Department of Agriculture could
also offer Information and guidance
to farmers in developing the trade.
fd) STATE ADVANCES TO FAR-
MERS.
The provision of money on the
cheapest possible terms to settlers is
a matter of urgent necessity, and the
State might extend its present activi-
ties in this matter considerably.
(e) LAND TAXATION.
Such a land policy is required as
■would destroy undesirable land ag-
gregation, and this might he obtained
by such taxation as would secure to
the State a portion of the value creat-
ed by tlie State, whilst guaran-
teeing the laud owner the full fruits
of his own industry. In his Budget
statement of 1917 the State Treasurer
showed that the returns, from land
taxation during the previous five years
had increased very slightly relative bo
the increased value of the land, due
to “enhancement of laud values,’’
apart from the increase credited to im-
provements. (Financial Statement.
1917-18 p. 14.) Presumably the in-
creased value due “to enhancement of
land values’’ is mainly created by the
community, and is therefore subject
to taxation by the community.
Apart from this consideration,
however, an increased gradu-
ated tax on unimproved values would
have the effect of breaking up targe
holdings, enforcing cultivation, and
Increasing production. For the pur-
poses of this tax the land should be
classified into pastoral and agricultur-
al districts, with higher rates for large
holdings in the latter than in the for-
mer. Further, the greatest care should
be exercised in imposing the tax, so
that there shall bo no discouragement
to production, while at the same time
the valuation should be made by a
thoroughly competent authority. It
might also be pointed out that there
are other forms of unearned income
which arc subject to taxation.
(f) CO-OPERATION.
The organisation of co-operative so-
clties among producers is an urgent
necessity, and should he encouraged.
The Department of Agriculture might
assist materially in promoting the
cause of rural co-operation while the
State could make liberal advances to
co-operative societies on the plan
adopted in Victoria
(g) TRANSPORT.
Railway charges on rural produce
should be the lowest consistent with
the public economy. Since the regular


marketing of primary produce is a
matter of great importance, to the
community a thorough investigation
into shipping services should be un-
dertaken immediately, with a view to
securing regular services.
(h) EDUCATION.
While no effort should he spared to
improve the education of the people,
as it is the most powerful
agent in the endeavor to improve
their conditions of life, it is
specially necessary at present to de-
velop through general education a
wider interest in rural life. To this
end the teaching of agriculture might
he made a part of the curriculum of
all schools, while higher education in
agricultural science and rural econo-
mics might be developed through
High Schools, the University, and the
State farm. An Agricultural College
or State farm Is of vital Importance
to the community, and Mis develop-
ment should he considered. In this
connection we quote Professor Watt,
of the Chair of Agriculture in the
University of Sydney, as follows: —
‘'That the time is opportune for a
bold and comprehensive policy of ag-
ricultural education and research, and
that a conference should be convened
ot representatives of the Agricultural
and Education Departments, the Pub-
lie Service Board, and the University,
to frame such a policy, which should
include.—Better facilities for the
teaching of agriculture in the prim-
ary and secondary schools in country
districts; t)he raising of the standard
of teaching in existing institutions by
increasing their equipment and staff;
greater encouragement to agricultural
teachers and research workers by the
payment of salaries more in keeping
with the importance of their work to
tble State; \and attracting in other
ways the best, young brains of the
country to the study of agriculture
and cognate problems.”
(i) UTILISATION OF THE LAND.
In the interests of settlement, and
the profitable use of the land, some
provision for the compulsory use of
the land when privately owned might
he advisable. Consideration should he
given to a proposal for a Compulsory
Utilisation of Land Act, providing
that all persons who own land shall,
atter a stated time, show that the
land: 'is being properly utilised for
bona fide settlement.
(j) GENERAL SOCIAL CONDITIONS.
Through education, higher real
wages, a rural housing scheme, ade-
quate provision for married workmen,
and improved transportation by road
and rail, and development of small
holdings, the general social conditions
in the country might be improved in
such a way as to check rural depopu -
lation. increase the productivity of
the land, raise the physical and ethi-
cal standard of the nation, and thus
rend to reduce the cost of living.
For the purpose of giving effect to
many of these measures a conference
representative of the farming com-
munity, the State, and the University
might he convened. Should the Gov-
ernment decide to deal with the sug-
gestions, such a conference would
prove invaluable in proposing a policy
satisfactory to the community.
S—URBAN PROPOSALS.
Tlie peculiar conditions of urban life
make necessary further recommenda-
tions. With a view to relieving the
distress in unban areas., and develop-
ing an efficient and self-reliant people,
the following measures might he con-
sidered :
(a) TAXATION OF UNIMPROVED
VALUES.
The taxation of unimproved values
in town properties would have all the
advantages of the taxation of unearn -
ed increment in rural areas. It is
thought that town rates should be
levied not on improvements, but sole-
ly on unimproved values. This would
encourage building and improvements,
and discourage the withholding of
urban land from its full use. Such _ a
scheme is successfully in
New South Wales, and in many towns
in New Zealand and cities in America.
(b) HOUSING SCHEME.
While the above proposal would
tend to liberate land for building pur-
poses, it would be necessary for muni-
cipalities to devise a housing scheme
adequate to the needs of their towns.


In order to encourage suburban set-
tlement transport facilities by tram
and railway should be increased.
(c) TOWN PLANNING.
Measures calculated to improve the
lay-out of cities and develop garden
suburbs are equally necessary and
should be considered by the munici-
palities'.
(d) MUNICIPAL TRADING.
Municipalities might with advan-
tage consider the desirability of open-
ing markets for such commodities aa
fruit and vegetables, fish, dairy pro-
duce, etc., and at (he same time de-
velop municipal supplies of commodi-
ties, such as bread and milk. It is
thought that such proposals would re-
duce distributive charges consider-
ably.
(e) MUNICIPAL POWERS,
for the purpose of gaining efficiency
in these measures it might be neces-
sary to extend by Act of Parliament
the powers o£ municipalities.
6—THE TARIFF.
Before any adjustment is made to
Uie tariff the most careful attention
should be given to the reports of the
Juter-State Commission on the Tariff,
and, if necessary, thorough investiga-
tion into the whole question should be
made by an impartial body. Undoubt-
edly the tariff tends to raise the prices
of commodities by approximately the
amount of the duty imposed on the
articles. Unless this is counteracted
by advantages in the way of the
founding of industries, the community
suffers a loss.
Consideration should bo given to the
proposal to constitute an independent
commission, e.g., the Inter-State Com-
mission, charged with the duty of ex-
amining every request for higher
duties, and suggesting- such proposals
as would lead to the development of
those industries in which the Com
moivwealth enjoys great natural ad-
vantages. Such a Commission migbi
also, within the limits prescribed to
it by Parliament, take measures to
cheek dumping, or to prevent other
temporary dislocation of the import
trade, and control the export of the
necessaries of life in such a way as
to enteure a sufficient home supply.
THANKS.
The Committee wishes to thank
Tour Worship and the City Coun-
cil for the use of the Council
Chambers for their meetings.
Thanks are also due to the wit-
nesses who came forward so readily,
to the State Statistician for informa-
tion supplied, and to the press for
publishing reports. In presenting this,
its final report, the Committee wishes
to be relieved of further investigation.
It requests that this report be for-
warded to the Government of Tas
mania, the Federal Government, the
City Council, and the press.

CHAPTER IV.
MONORITY RETORT.
Whilst I am in agreement with
much of the majority report of this
Committee, 1 differ from that report
in certain important particulars, as
shown by the following minority re-
port, which I have drafted somewhat
independently of the recommendations
made in the majority- report and With -
out necessarily referring to them.
The main causes of recent excessive
high prices are apparently the follow-
ing:—
I. THU GREAT WAR ITSELF.
1. By withdrawing millions of
workers from their ordinary la-
bor of production.
2. By diverting untold millions of
pounds from productive work
to (lie making of instruments of
destruction.
3. By disorganising oversea trans-
port.
4. By exhausting the accumulated
stares of ordinary commodities
and thus giving occasion for
unconscionable profiteering.
IT. UNWISE AND MISTAKEN
LEGISLATION.
1. By excessive borrowing.


2. By not paying a proper propor-
tion of war expenses out of re-
venue.
By an excessive issue of paper
money, -by the establishment of
a practically incontrovertible
paper money currency, by the
withdrawal of gold coin from
circulation, and by giving to -the
Commonwealth Bank a virtual
monopoly in certain banking
business.
4. By discouraging the develop-
ment of primary products aa
contrasted with the assistance
given to the artificial develop-
ment of manufactures,
o. By the excessive duties levied
on Imports and on shipping
(notably in the case of Hobart
in the item of light duesp
0. By excessive Government in-
terference in the oonditon-s of
labor, and particularly in Tas-
mania, where the conditionls of
industry are fixed not according
to local requirements, but ac-
cording to tlie arbitrary pro- -
uouncemenlts of judges in Mel-
bourne.
7. By price fixing and similar ar-
t.flcial measures, which prevent
the free play of economic
forces.
111. The strained and un,happy rela-
tions existing between employers and
employed, whereby strikes are multi-
plied, the output of labor is diminish-
ed, enterprise is handicapped, and the
cost of production disastrously in-
creased.
There are many minor causes of ox
cessive high prices, such as the fol-
lowing:—
IV. The increased amount of money
handled by all classes during the war.
leading to a fictitious sense of wealth
and consequent extravagance.
V. The diminished competition
among middlemen, consequent upon
the withdrawal ot multitudes of men
for war work.
The main remedies for excessive
high prices should be sought appar-
ently in the followng directions: —
I. By encouraging to the utmost an
increase in production, especially ol
primary products, by increasing the
output of labor; and by restoring 88
quickly as possible the normal condi-
tions of the manufacturing and com-
mercial world.
11, BY WISER LEGISLATION.
1. Curtailing borrowings to the
utmost practical extent.
By strenuous efforts to balance
the Commonwealth income and
expenditure.
3. By appointing a 'Royal Commis-
sion to report upon the cur-
rency, the Commonwealth ißank
system, and Commonwealth tin-
anice generally. It seems to he
extremely desirable that Com-
monwealth Bank notes should
he payable in gold in each State
capital.
4. By encouraging as much as pos-
sible the increase of primary
products and removing every
restriction caused by arbitrary
legislation and unfair taxation.
For instance, is it fair that Tas-
manian orchardists should have
to pay a third more for their
shoveis in order to enrich Mel-
bourne manufacturers? The
proposal to restrict the export
of primary products is danger-
ous in the extreme,
o. By reducing the t|arif£ to its
lowest terms merely for the
production of revenue, and not
for the purpose of assisting
the manufacturer at the expense
of the primary producer. The
proposal to hand ever the con-
trol of the tariff to a commis-
sion independent of Parliament
seems absolutely impractical
and futile. The listing of the
tariff is one of the most impor-
tant of all the functions of
Government. How could a
Free Trade Tariff Commission
carry on when a Protectionist
Government was in power, or
vice versa?
(!. By interfering as little as Pos
sbie with business men in the
conduct of their business. The
arbitrary fixation of wages has
had most disastrous effects! up-
on enterprise, by exciting un-
rest and discontent and by dim*
inishing employment. The fixa-
ation of rents would have a
similar disastrous effect. Thu


proposal to fix a basic family
wage which should vary from
year to year or from month to
month, with the rise and tall of
the supposed cost of living,
seems to be academic in the ex-,
treme and absolutely unwork-
able in practice. The proposal
to flx a uniform basic wage for
the Commonwealth as a whole
seems chimerical. What would
be a fair wage in the genial cli-
mate of Tasmania would be an
unfair wage at Broken Hill, in
New South Wales, or at Oooks-
town, in Queensland, or at Dar-
win, in the Northern Territory,
Each State should be indepen-
dent In fixing its own industrial
conditions. To fix the selling
prices of merchantable commo-
dities would be a most) disas-
trous interference with' Trade.
For governments or municipali-
ties to enter into competition
with private enterprise would
be most unjust, as it ufmld he
using the taxes paid by the
traders in order to diminish or
destroy the trader's own busi-
ness.
The policy of arbitrarily forcing
large estates into ((he market with
the supposed object of encouraging
closer settlement is open to the sev-
erest criticism. To impose an exag-
gerated graduated tax lor that object
seems to be dishonest and immoral,
ns it is using a tax which is osten-
sibly Imposed for the purpose of re-
venue, but which is really imposed
for an absolutely different purpose.
The policy of Imposing special taxes
on special incomes which are misnam-
ed “unearned Incomes." is one-sided
and unjust.
The policy of compelling a land
owner to put ids land to a particular
use is fraught with great nr'sehief
and danger. The proposal to rate
what is called the unimproved values
of town properties and by this rate
to do away with the rates on improve-
ments seems unreasonable.
HI. BY PROMOTING GOODWILL
AND CO-OPERATION BETWEEN
EMPOYERS AND EMPLOYED. As
regards strikes, force is no remedy. To
punish the strike leaders by fines or
imprisonments or deprivation of the
franchise merely presents them with
a cheap form of martyrdom. The
right to work and the right to cease
working are innate rights which will
survive any attempts by governments
to suppress them. The only remedy
Cor strikes is to promote cordial rela-
tions between capital and labor. This
could Be best done by an extension cf
the tenure of employment. The sys-
tem at present in almost universal
vogue, of day labor or week labor, is
fatal to permanent good feeling be-
tween master and workman. The
temptation to “down tools" at an
hour’s notice is too provocative, of
bad feeling. The introduction of agree-
ments between master and workmen
for one year, two years, and three
years would be the surest safeguard
possible against the recurrence of
strikes. It would give permanence
and continuity of employment to the
workman and enable the employer to
make his calculations with a degree
of certainty impossible under the exist-
ing system. it would thereby give
a great .stimulus to business enter-
prise,
IV. BY ADVOCATING UNIVER-
SAL ECONOMY, THRIFT AND IN-
DUSTRY. The Government should
set an example by avoiding all extra-
ordinary expenditure. The teaching
of economy, thrift and industry should
lie made an essential part of .school
education.
The income tax. both Common-
wealth and State, should be made as
light as possible for incomes below
£250. But to exempt them altogether
as has been suggested in some quar-
ters, would lie to do this at the ex-
pense of all incomes above £250, which
would be unfair.
