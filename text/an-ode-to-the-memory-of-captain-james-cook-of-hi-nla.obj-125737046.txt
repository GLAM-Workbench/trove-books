And are there yet, in this late flckly age
(Unkindly to the tow’ring growths of virtue)
Such bold, exalted fpirits? Men whofe deeds,

And glows the flame of Liberty fo ftrong
In this lone fpeck of earth ! this fpot obfcure,

Such were theworking thoughts which fwell d the breaft
Of o-enerous Boswel; when with nobler aim

By trivial fancy trod, he turn’d his courfe
From


From polilh’d Gallia’s foft delicious vales,
From the grey reliques of imperial Rome,

From her long galleries of laurel’d ftone,
Her chifel’d heroes, and her marble gods,
Whofe dumb majeftic pomp yet awes the world,
To animated forms of patriot zeal,
Warm in the living majefty of virtue,

Incefi'ant foaming round their lhaggy iides;
Hail to thy winding bays, thy flielt ring ports
B And

Their hofpitable arms to every fail:

Scarce feen, amongft the craggy hanging cliffs
Seem like an eagle’s neft aerial built:
Thy fwelling mountains, brown with folemn fhade
j *
Of various trees, that wave their giant arms
O’er the rough fons of freedom; lofty pines,
And hardy fir, and ilex ever green,
And fpreading chefnut, with each humbler plant,
\
And fiirub of fragrant leaf, that clothes their fides

With living verdure; whence the cluft’ring bee
Extracts her golden dews: the finning box,
And fweet-leav’d myrtle, aromatic thyme,
The


The prickly juniper, and the green leaf
Which feeds the fpinning worm; while glowing bright
Beneath the various foliage, wildly fpreads
The arbutus, and rears his fear let fruit
Luxuriant, mantling o’er the craggy fteeps;
And thy own native laurel crowns the feene.
Hail to thy favage forefts, awful, deep :
Thy tangled thickets, and thy crowded woods,
The haunt of herds untam’d; which fullen bound
From rock to rock with fierce unfbeial air
And wilder gaze, as confcious of the power
That loves to reign amid the lonely feenes
Of unbroke nature: precipices huge,
And tumbling torrents; tracklefs defarts, plains
Fenc’d in with guardian rocks, whofe quarries teem
With fhining fteel, that to the cultur’d fields

Prints her majeftic ftep: for thefe fhe fcorns
The preen enamel’d vales, the velvet lap
Of fmooth favannahs, where the pillow’d head
Of luxury repofes; balmy gales,
And bowers that breathe of blifs: for thefe, when firft
This ifle emerging like a beauteous gem
From the dark bofom of the Tyrrhene main
Rear’d its fair front, die mark’d it for her own,

A broken remnant, from the generous flock

Of ancient Greece, from Sparta’s fad remains,
True to their high defcent, preferv’d unquench’d

The facred fire thro’ many a barbarous age:
A
Whom, nor the iron rod of cruel Carthage,
/•
Nor the dread fceptre of imperial Rome, ,
Nor bloody Goth, nor gridy Saracen,
Nor


Nor the long galling yoke of proud Liguria,
Could crufh into fubje&ion. Still unquell’d
- «
They rofe fuperior, burfting from their chains
•/
And claim’d man’s deareft birthright, Liberty:
And long, thro’ many a hard unequal ftrife
Maintain’d the glorious conflict , long withftood
With ftngle arm, the whole collected force
/
Of haughty Genoa, and ambitious Gaul:
And fhall withftand it, truft the faithful Mufe.
It is not in the force of mortal arm,
4
Scarcely in fate, to bind the ftruggling foul
That gall’d by wanton power, indignant fwells
Againft oppreftion ; breathing great revenge,
Carelefs of life, determin’d to be free.
/
And fav’ring heaven approves: for fee the Man,
Born to exalt his own, and give mankind
A glimpfe of higher natures: juft, as great;
The foul of counfel, and the nerve of war;
Of


Of high unfhaken fpirit, temper’d fweet
With foft urbanity, and polifh’d grace,
And attic wit, and gay unftudied fmiles:
Whom heaven in fome propitious hour endow’d
With every purer virtue: gave him all
-
That lifts the hero, or adorns the man.
Gave him the eye fublime; the fearching glance
Keen, fcanning deep, that fmites the guilty foul
As with a beam from heaven; on his brow
Serene, and fpacious front, fet the broad feal
Of dignity and rule; then fmil’d benign
On this fair pattern of a God below,
High wrought, and breath’d into his fwelling breaft
The large ambitious wilh to fave his country.
■>%
*
Oh beauteous title to immortal fame!
The man devoted to the public, flands
In the bright records of fuperior worth
A ilep below the Ikies: if he fucceed,
The


The firff fair lot which earth affords, is his;
And if he falls, he falls above a throne.
When fuch their leader can the brave defpair ?
\ N
Freedom the caufe and Paoli the chief.
Succefs to your fair hopes! a Britifh mufe,
Tho’ weak and powerlefs, lifts her fervent voice,
And breathes a prayer for your fuccefs. Oh could
It
She fcatter bleffmgs as the morn fheds dews,
To drop upon your heads ! but patient hope
Muff wait the appointed hour ; fecure of this.
That never with the indolent and weak
* /-
Will freedom deign to dwell; flie muff be feiz’d
By that bold arm that wreftles for the bleffing:
’Tis heaven’s beft gift and muff be bought with blood.
When the. ftorm thickens, when the combat burns,
And pain and death in every horrid fhape
That can appall the feeble, prowl around,
Then virtue triumphs; then her tow’ring form
Dilates


Dilates with kindling majefty ; her mien
Breathes a diviner fpirit, and enlarg’d
Each fpreading feature, with an ampler port
And bolder tone, exulting, rides the florm,
And joys amidft the tempeft: then fhe reaps
Her golden harveft ; fruits of nobler growth
And higher relifh than meridian funs
Can ever ripen ; fair, heroic deeds,
And godlike adion. ’Tis not meats, and drinks,
And balmy airs, and vernal funs, and fhowers
That feed and ripen minds; ’tis toil and danger;
• \ 1
And wreftling with the ftubborn gripe of fate ;
And war, and fharp diftrefs, and paths obfcure
And dubious. The bold fwimmer joys not fo
To feel the proud waves under him, and beat
With ftrong repelling arm the billowy furge ;
The generous courfer does not fo exult
To tofs his floating mane againfl; the wind.
And


And neigh amidft the thunder of the war,
. ; . \
As virtue to oppofe her fwelling bread:
Like a firm fhield againft the darts of fate.
4
And when her fons in that rough fchool have learn’d
To fmile at danger, then the hand that rais’d
Shall hufh the ftorm, and lead the fhining train
«
Of peaceful years in bright procefhon on.
Then fhall the fhepherd’s pipe, the mufe’s lyre,
On Cyrnus’ fhores be heard : her grateful fons
With loud acclaim and hymns of cordial praife
Shall hail their high deliverers; every name
To virtue dear be from oblivion {hatch’d,
l *
And plac’d among the flars: but chiefly thine,
Thine, Paoli, with fweeteft found fhall dwell
On their applauding lips; thy facred name,
Endear’d to long pofterity, fome mufe,
More worthy of the theme, fhall confecrate
To after ages, and applauding worlds
Shall blefs the godlike man who fav’d his country.
C So


So vainly wilh’d, fo fondly hop d the Mufe :
Too fondly hop’d : The iron fates prevail,
And Cyrnus is no more. Her generous lons,
Lefs vanquiih’d than o’erwhelm’d, by numbers crufh’d,
Admir’d, unaided fell. So drives the moon
In dubious battle with the gathering clouds,
\
And ftrikes a fplendour thro’ them : till at length
*
Storms roll’d on dorms involve the face of heaven
f
And quench her ftruggling fires. Forgive the zeal
That, too prefumptuous, whifper’d better things
And read the book of deftiny amifs.
Not with the purple colouring of fuccefs
Is virtue belt adorn’d: th’ attempt is praile. 1
\
•\ , \
There yet remains a freedom, nobler far
Than kings or fenates can deftroy or give;
Beyond the proud oppreflbr’s cruel grafp
Seated fecure ; uninjur’d ; undeftroy’d ;
Worthy of Gods: The freedom of the mind.

HEALTH to my friend, and long unbroken years,
By ftorms unruffled and unftain’d by tears :

Wing’d by new joys may each white minute fly;
Spring on her cheek, and funfliine in her eye;
O’er that dear breaft, where love and pity fprings,

May peace eternal fpread her downy wings:
C 2 Sweet


Sweet beaming hope her path illumine ftill,
And fair ideas all her fancy fill.
From glittering fcenes which ftrike the dazzled fight
With mimic grandeur and illunve light, •
i
From idle hurry, and tumultuous noifc,
From hollow friendships, and from fickly joys,.
Will Delia, at the mufe’s call retire
To the pure pleafures rural fcenes infpire ?
Will file from crowds and bufy cities fly,
Where wreaths of curling fmoke involve the iky,
To tafte the grateful ftiade of fpreading trees,
And drink the fpirit of the mountain breeze ?
.
When winter's hand the rough'ning year deforms,
And hollow winds foretel approaching ftorms,
* ' *
Then Pleafure, like a bird of paflage, flies
\
To brighter climes, and more indulgent Ikies;
y
Cities and courts allure her fprightly train,
From


From the bleak mountain and the naked plain;
And gold and gems with artificial blaze,
Supply the fickly fun’s declining rays :
But foon returning on the weftern gale
She feeks the bofom of the grafly vale;
There, wrapt in carelefs eafe, attunes the lyre
To the wild warblings of the woodland quire ;
The daified turf her humble throne fupplies,
And early primrofes around her rife.
We’ll follow where the fmiling goddefs leads.
Thro’ tangled forefts or enamel’d meads;
O’er pathlefs hills her airy form we’ll chafe,
In filent glades her fairy footfteps trace:
Small pains there needs her footfteps to purfue,
She cannot fly from friendfliip, and from you.
Now the glad earth her frozen zone unbinds,
t
And o’er her bofom breathe the weftern winds:
‘ '
Already now the fnow-drop dares appear,
The


The firft pale bloflbm of th’ unripen’d year; *
As Flora’s breath, by fome transforming power,
Had chang’d an icicle into a flower:
Its name, and hue, the fcentlefs plant retains,
And winter lingers in its icy veins.
\
To thefe fucceed the violet’s dufky blue,
And each inferior flower of fainter hue;

Till riper months the perfedl year difclofe,
And Flora cries exulting, See my Rofe!

The Mufe invites, my Delia hafte away,
♦~’ ■ |
And let us fweetly wafte the carelefs day.
Here gentle fummits lift their airy brow ; -
Down the green flope here winds the labouring plow;
Here bath’d by frequent fhow’rs cool vales are feen,
»
Cloath’d with frefli verdure, and eternal green ;
Here fmooth canals, acrofs th’ extended plain,
Stretch their long arms, to join the diftant main:
The


The ions of toil with many a weary ftroke
Scoop the hard bofom of the folid rock ;
/
Reflftlefs thro’ the ftiff oppoflng clay
With fteady patience work their gradual way ;
i
Compel the genius of th’ unwilling flood
9
Thro’ the brown horrors of the aged wood ;
Crofs the lone wafte the fllver urn they pour,
And chear the barren heath or fullen moor :
The traveller with pleafing wonder fees
The white fail gleaming thro’ the dufky trees ;
i
And views the alter’d landscape with furprife,
And doubts the magic fcenes which round him rife
Now, like a flock of fwans, above his head
Their woven wings the flying veflels fpread ;
Now meeting ftreams in. artful mazes glide,
' . I
While each unmingled, pours *a feparate tide ;
*
Now through the hidden veins of earth they flow.
And viflt fulphurous mines and caves below ;


The ductile ftreams obey the guiding hand,
And focial plenty circles round thedand.

But nobler praife awaits our green retreats;
The Mules here have fixt their facred feats.
Mark where its fimple front yon manfion rears,
The nurfery of men for future years:
Here callow chiefs and embryo flatefmen lie,
And undedg’d poets Ihort excurdons try :
While Merfey’s gentle current, which too long
By fame negleded, and unknown to fong,
Between his rufliy banks, (no poet’s theme)
Had crept inglorious, like a vulgar ftream,
Refleds th’ .afcending feats with confcious pride,
And dares to emulate a cladic tide.,
. Soft mudc breathes along each op’ning Ihade,
And fooths the dalhing of his rough cafcade.
With myllic lines his fands are figur’d o’er,
And


And circles trac’d upon the letter’d fliore.
Beneath his willows rove th’ inquiring youth,
And court the fair majeftic form of truth.
Here nature opens all her fecret Iprings,
And heav’n-born fcience plumes her eagle wings:
Too long had bigot rage, with malice fwell’d,
Crufli’d her ftrong pinions, and her flight witheld;
Too long to check her ardent progrefs ftrove:
So writhes the ferpent round the bird of Jove;
Hangs on her flight, reftrains her tow’ring wing,
Twifts its dark folds, and points its venom’d fling.
Yet ftill (if aught aright the Mufe divine)
Her rifing pride fliall mock the vain defign ;
On founding pinions yet aloft fliall foar,
And thro’ the azure deep untravel’d paths explore.
Where fcience fmiles, the Mufes join the train;
r
And gentleft arts and pureft manners reign.
Ye generous youth who love this ftudious lhade,

How rich a field is to your hopes difplay’d!
Knowledge to you unlocks the claflic page ;
And virtue blofibms for a better age.
Oh golden days! ok bright unvalued hours!
What blifs (did ye but know that blifs) were yours ?
With richeft ftores your glowing bofoms fraught,
Perception quick, and luxury of thought;
The high defigns that heave the labouring foul,
Panting for fame, impatient of controul;
And fond enthufiaftic thought, that feeds
On pidur’d tales of vaft heroic deeds ;

And quick affedions, kindling into flame
At virtue’s, or their country s honour d name £

And fpirits light to every joy in tune;
And friendfliip ardent as a fummer’s noon;
And generous fcorn of vice’s venal tribe;
And proud difdain of intereft s fordid bribe;
And confcious honour’s quick inftindive fenfe;

On India’s painted fhore, by Ganges’ ft ream.
He fpreads his plumage to the funny gleam :

With emulative flrife the notes prolong,
And pour out all their little fouls in fong.
When winter bites upon the naked plain,

And mourn’d a falfe ungrateful youth;
While dying echoes caught the found,
And fpread the foft complaints around
Of broken vows and alter’d truth;

An aged ftiepherd heard her moan,
And thus in pity’s kindeft tone

For founds, tho’ fweet, can ne’er relieve
A breaking heart by love betray’d.

Why


Why (houldft thou wafte fuch precious fhowers,
That fall like dew on wither’d flowers,
*
But dying pallion ne’er reftor’d ?
In beauty’s empire is no mean,
And woman, either flave or queen,.
Is quickly fcorn’d when not ador’d.
Thofe liquid pearls from either eye.
Which might an eaftern empire buy.
Unvalued here and fruitlefs fall \

No art the feafon can renew
When love was young, and Damon true,
\

No tears a wandering heart recall.
Ceafe, ceafe to grieve, thy tears are vain.
Should thofe fair orbs in drops of rain
Vic with a weeping fouthern fky :
For


For hearts o’ercome with love and grief
All nature yields but one relief;
Die, haplefs Araminta, die.

WHEN firfl: upon your tender cheek

With mild and chearing beam,

I watch’d the dawn of every grace,
And gaz’d upon that angel face,
While yet ’twas fafe to gaze ;
And fondly bleft each riling charm,

Nor thought lur.h innocence could harm
The peace of future days.
But now defpotic o’er the plains
The awful noon of beauty reigns,
And kneeling crowds adore;
Thefe charms arife too fiercely bright,
Danger and death attend the fight,
And I mull hope no more.
Thus


Thus to the riling God of day

Their early vows the Perfians pay,
And blefs the fpreading fire;
Whofe glowing chariot mounting foon
Pours on their heads the burning noon;

With trembling knees o’er unknown hills I go,
Stiff with blue ice and heap’d with drifted fnow:

Pale funs there ftrike their feeble rays in vain,
Which faintly glance againft the marble plain;
Red Ifler there; which madly lafh’d the fhore,
His idle urn feal’d up, forgets to roar;

Stern winter in eternal tr umph reigns,
Shuts up the bounteous year and ftarves the plains.
My failing eyes the weary wade explore,
The favage mountains and the dreary fhore,
And vainly look for fcenes of old delight;

Unfeals the eyelids of the morn,
And pours increafing day.
O what a night was that, which wrapt
The heathen world in gloom!
O what a fun which broke this day,
Triumphant from the tomb!
This day be grateful homage paid,
And loud hofannas fung :
o /
Let gladnefs dwell in every heart,
And praife on every tongue.
The


Ten thoufand differing lips ffiall join
To hail this welcome morn;
Which fcatters bleiftngs from its wings,

To nations yet unborn.
i
Jesus, the friend of human kind,
With ftrong companion mov’d,
Defcended like a pitying God,
To fave the fouls he lov’d.
The powers of darknels leagued in vain
To bind his foul in death ;
He fhook their kingdom when he fell.
With his expiring breath.
Not long the toils of hell could keep
The hope of Judah’s line ;
Corruption never could take hold
On aught fo much divine.
And


And now his conquering chariot-wheels
Afcend the lofty Ikies;
While broke, beneath his powerful crofs,
Death’s iron fceptre lies.

And ftill his bleeding heart is touch’d

An ADDRESS to the DEITY.
Deus eft quodcunque vides , quocunque moveris.
LUCAN.
GO D of my life! and author of my days!
%
Permit my feeble voice to lifp thy praife;
And trembling, take upon a mortal tongue
That hallow’d name to harps of Seraphs fung.
Yet here the brighteft Seraphs could no more
Than hide their faces, tremble, and adore.
Worms, angels, men, in every different fphere
Are equal all, for all are nothing here. :
R 2
All


All nature faints beneath the mighty name,
Which nature’s works, thro’ all their parts proclaim,
r K
I feel that name my inmoft thoughts controul,
And breathe an awful ftilnefs thro’ my foul;
As by a charm, the waves of grief fubfide ;
Impetuous paflion flops her headlong tide;
At thy felt prefence all emotions ceafe,
And my hufh’d fpirit finds a fudden peace.
Till every worldly thought within me dies,
- *
* ..
And earth’s gay pageants vanifh from my eyes ;
Till all my fenfe is loft in infinite,
And one vaft objed fills my aching fight.
«•
But foon, alas! this holy calm is broke;
My foul fubmits to wear her wonted yoke;
With fhackled pinions flrives to foar in vain,
And mingles with the drofs of earth again.
But he, our gracious Mafler, kind, as juft,
Knowing


Knowing our frame, remembers man is duft:
His fpirit, ever brooding o’er our mind,
Sees the firft wifli to better hopes inclin’d ;
Marks the young dawn of every virtuous aim,
And fans the fmoaking flax into a flame:
His ears are open to the fofteft cry,
His grace defcends to meet the lifted eye ;
He reads the language of a fllent tear,
And flghs are incenfe from a heart flncere.
t
Such are the vows, the facrifice I give;
Accept the vow, and bid the fuppliant live
From each terreftrial bondage fet me free;
Hufli every wifli that, centers not in thee;
Bid my fond hopes, my vain difquiets ceafe,.
, \
And point my path to everlafting peace.
If the foft hand of winning pleafure
By living waters, and thro’ flow’ry meads,
When


When all is fmiling, tranquil, and ferene,
And vernal beauty paints the flattering fcene,
Oh ! teach me to elude each latent (hare,

And whifper to my Aiding heart—Beware:
With caution let me hear the Syren s voice,
And doubtful, with a trembling heart, rejoice.
I
If friendlefs, in a vale of tears I ftray,
Where briars wound, and thorns perplex my way,

Still let my fleady foul thy goodnefs fee,
And with ftrong confidence lay hold on thee ;
With equal eye my various lot receive,
Refign’d to die, or refolute to live ;
Prepar’d to kifs the fceptre, or the rod,

While God is feen in all, and all in God.

With thee in bufy crowded cities talk,
In every creature own thy forming power,
In each event thy providence adore.

And feel myfelf omnipotent in thee.
Then when the laft, the doling hour draws nigh,

On fancy’s wild and roving wing I fail.
From the green borders of the peopled earth,
And the pale moon, her duteous fair attendant;
From folitary Mars; from the vaft orb
Of Jupiter, whofe huge gigantic bulk

Dances in ether like the lighted: leaf >
To the dim verge, the fuburbs of the fyftem,
Where chearlefs Saturn ’midfl: her watry moons

Of elder beam ; which alk no leave to fhine
Of our terreftrial ftar, nor borrow light
From the proud regent of our fcanty day ;
Sons of the morning, firft born of creation,
And only lels than him who marks their track,
And guides their fiery wheels. Here mu ft I flop,
Or is there aught beyond ? What hand unfeen
Impels me onward thro’ the glowing orbs
Of habitable nature ; far remote,
To the dread confines of eternal night,
To folitudes of vaft unpeopled fpace,
The defarts of creation, wide and wild;
Where embryo fyftems and unkindled funs
Sleep in the womb of chaos; fancy droops,
And


And thought aftonifh’d flops her bold career. ;
But oh thou mighty mind ! whofe powerful word
Said, thus let all things be, and thus they were,
Where fhail I feck thy prefence ? how unblam’d
Invoke thy dread perfection ?
Have the broad eye-lids of the morn beheld thee ?
Or does the beamy fhoulder of Orion
Support thy throne? O look with pity down
On erring guilty man; not in thy names
Of terrour clad ; not with thofe thunders arm’d
That confcious Sinai felt, when fear appall’d
The fcatter’d tribes; thou haft a gentler voice,
That whifpers comfort to the fwelling heart,
Abafh’d, yet longing to behold her Maker.

But now my foul unus’d to ftretch her powers
In flight fo daring, drops her weary wing,

And feeks again the known accuftom’d fpot,


Dreft up with fun, and lhade, and lawns, and ftreams,
A man lion fair and fpacious for its gueli.
And full replete with wonders. Let me here

Content and grateful, wait th’ appointed time
And ripen for the Ikies: the hour will come
When all thefe fplendours burfting on my light

Unlock the glories of the world unknown.

1| 7 ARK WORTH CASTLE in Northumberland ftands
v V very boldly on a neck of land near the fea-ffiore, almoft
furrounded by the river Coqjjet, (called by our old Latin Hifto-
rians, Coqueda) which runs with a clear rapid ftream, but when
fwoln with rains becomes violent and dangerous.
About a mile from the Caftle, in a deep romantic valley, are
the remains of a Hermitage ;of which the Chapel is ftill intire.
This is hollowed with great elegance in a cliff near the river; as are
alfo two adjoining apartments, which probably ferved for an Ante-
chapel and Vefhy, or were appropriated to fome other facred ufes:
for the former of thefe, which runs parallel with the Chapel,
is thought to have had an Altar in it, at which Mafs was occa-
lionaliy celebrated, as well as in the Chapel itfelf.
Each of thefe apartments is extremely fmall; for that which was
the principal Chapel does not in length exceed eighteen feet j nor is
more than feven feet and a half in breadth and height: it is how-
ever very beautifully defigned and executed in the folid rock j and
has all the decorations of a compleat Gothic Church or Cathedral
in miniature.
But what principally diftinguiffies the Chapel, is, a fmall Tomb
or Monument, on the fouth-fide the altar: on the top of which,
lies a Female Figure extended in the manner that effigies are ufually
exhibited praying on ancient tombs. This figure, which is very
delicately defigned, fome have ignorantly called an image of the
Virgin Mary; though it has not the lead refemblance to the manner
in which (he is reprefented in the Romiffi Churches; who is ufually
eredt, as the objedl of adoration, and never in a proftrate or recum-
bent pofture. Indeed the real image of the Bleffed Virgin probably
flood in a fmall nich, ftill vifible behind the altar: whereas the
figure of a Bull’s Head, which is rudely carved at this Lady’s feet,
the ufual place for the Creft in old monuments, plainly proves her
to have been a very different perfonage. *
About
advertisement.


About the tomb are feveral other Figures, which as well as the
principal one above-mentioned, are cut in the natural rock, in the
fame manner as the little Chapel itfelf, with all its Ornaments, and
the two adjoining Apartments. What flight traditions are fcattered
through the country concerning the origin and foundation of this
Heimitage, Tomb, &c. are delivered to the Reader in the follow-
ing rhimes.
It is univerfally agreed, that the Founder was one of the Ber-
tram family, which had once confiderable pofleflions in Nor-
thumberland, and were anciently Lords of Bothal Caftle, fituate
about ten miles from Warkworth. He has been thought to be the
fame Bertram, that endowed Brinkburn Priory, and built
Brenkshaugh Chapel: which both Hand in the fame winding
valley, higher up the river.

But Brinkburn Priory was founded in the reign of K. Henry L*
whereas the form of the Gothic Windows in this Chapel, efpecially
of thole near the altar, is found rather to refemble the flyle of
architecture that prevailed about the reign of K. Edward 111. And
indeed that the fculpture in this Chapel cannot be much older, ap-
pears from the Crefl: which is placed at the Lady’s feet on the tomb;
for Camden f informs us, that armorial Crefts did not become here-
ditary till about the reign of K. Edward 11.
. Thefe appearances flill extant, flrongly confirm the account
given in the following poem, and plainly prove that the Hermit
of Warkworth was not the fame perfon that founded Brink-
burn Priory in the twelfth century, but rather one of the Ber-
tram family, who lived at a later period.

When, lo! he heard a female voice
Tament in fore difmay.
B With


With hofpitable hade he rofe,
And wak’d his deeping fire ;
And {hatching up a lighted brand.
Forth hied the reverend fire.
All fad beneath a neighbouring tree
A beauteous maid he found,
Who beat her bread:, and with her tears
/ ■ u
Bedew’d the mody ground,
»
O weep not, lady, weep not fo ,
Nor let vain fears alarm ;
My little cell diall dielter thee,
And keep thee fafe from harm.
It is not for myfelf I weep,
Nor for myfelf I fear ;
But for my dear and only friend,
Who lately left me here :

And while fome dickering bower he fought
Within this lonely wood,

Ah I fore I fear his wandering feet

Have dipt in yonder dood.


O! truft in heaven, the Hermit faid,
And to my cell repair;
Doubt not but I fliall find thy friend,
And eafe thee of thy care.
Then climbing up his rocky ftairs,
He fcales the cliff fo high;
And calls aloud, and waves his light
To guide the ftranger’s eye.
/
Among the thickets long he winds
With careful fteps and flow:
At length a voice return d his call,
Quick anfwering from below:
1
O tell me, father, tell me true.
If you have chanc’d to fee
A gentle maid, I lately left
Beneath fome neighbouring tree:
» '
But either I have loft the place,
Or fhe hath gone aftray:
And much 1 fear this fatal ftream
Hath fnatch’d her hence away.

Praife heaven, my fon, the Hermit faid;
The lady’s fafe and well :
And foon he join’d the wandering youth,
And brought him to his cell.
V *

Then well was feen, thefe gentle friends
They lov’d each other dear:
The youth he prefs’d her to his heart;
The maid let fall a tear.
Ah! feldom had their hoft, I ween,
Beheld fo fweet a pair:
The youth was tall with manly bloom.
She flender, foft, and fair.
The youth was clad in foreft green,
With bugle-horn fo bright:
She in a filken robe and fcarf
Snatch’d up in hafty flight.
Sit down, my children, fays the Sage;
Sweet reft: your limbs require:
Then heaps frefh fewel on the hearth,
And mends his little fire.
Partake,


Partake, he faid, my fimple ftore,
Dried fruits, and milk, and curds;
And fpreading all upon the board,
' Invites with kindly words.
Thanks, father, for thy bounteous fare;
The youthful couple fay;
Then freely ate, and made good chear,
And talk’d their cares away.
Now fay, my children, (for perchance
My councel may avail)
What ftrange adventure brought you here
Within this lonely dale ?
Firft tell me, father, faid the youth,
(Nor blame mine eager tongue)
What town is near ? What lands are thefe ?
J
And to what lord belong ?
Alas! my fon, the Hermit faid.
Why do I live to fay,
The rightful lord of thefe domains
Is banifh’d far away ?
C
Ten


Ten winters now have fhed their fnows
On this my lowly hall,
Since valiant Hotspur (fo the North
Our youthful lord did call)
Againft Fourth Henry Bolin gbroke
Led up his northern powers,
And ftoutly fighting loft his life
Near proud Salopian’s towers.
One fon he left, a lovely boy.
His country’s hope and heir;
And, oh! to fave him from his foes
It was his grandfire’s care.
/
In Scotland fafe he plac’d the child
Beyond the reach of ftrife,
Nor long before the brave old Earl
At Bramham loft his life.
i
And now the Percy name, fo long
Our northern pride and boaft,
Lies hid, alas! beneath a cloud;
Their honors reft and loft.
No


No chieftain of that noble houfe
Now leads our youth to arms;
The bordering Scots difpoil our fields,
And ravage all our farms.
'
Their halls and caftles, once fo fair,
Now moulder in decay;
Proud ftrangers now ufurp their lands.
And bear their wealth away.
Nor far from hence, where yon full, fiream
Runs winding down the lea,
Fair Warkworth lifts her lofty towers,
And overlooks the fea.
Thofe towers, alas! now lie forlorn.
With noifome weeds o’erfpred,
Where feafted lords and courtly dames,
And where the poor were fed.
Meantime far off, mid Scottifli hills
The Percy lives unknown:
On ftranger’s bounty he depends,
And may not claim his own.
O might


O might I with thefe aged eyes
But live to fee him here,
Then Ihould my foul depart in blifs!
He faid, and dropt a tear.
And is the Percy ftill fo lov’d
Of all his friends and thee ?
Then, father, blefs me, faid the youth,
For I thy guefl am He.
Silent he gaz’d, then turn’d ahde
To wipe the tears he fhed;
And lifting up his hands and eyes,
Pour’d bleflings on his head:
i
Welcome, our dear and much-lov’d lord,
Thy country’s hope and care:
But who may this young lady be,
That is fo wonderous fair ?
Now, father, Men to my tale,
And thou (halt know the truth:
And let thy fage advice diredl
My unexperienc’d youth.


In Scotland I’ve been nobly bred
Beneath the Regent’s hand, *
In feats of arms, and every lore
To fit me for command.
With fond impatience long I burn’d
My native land to fee:
At length I won my guardian friend,
To yield that boon to me.
Then up and down in hunter’s garb
I wandered as in chace,
Till in the noble Neville’s houfe *f*
I gain’d a hunter’s place.
Sometime with him I liv’d unknown,
Till I’d the hap fo rare,
To pleafe this young and gentle dame,
That baron’s daughter fair.

refidence was at Raby cafile, in the biflioprick of Durham,


Now, Percy, faid the blufhing maid,
The truth I muft reveal;
Souls great and generous, like to thine,
Their noble deeds conceal.
It happened on a fummer’s day,
Led by the fragrant breeze
I wandered forth to take the aii
Among the green-wood trees.
Sudden a band of rugged Scots,
That near in ambufb lay,
Mofs-troopers from the border-fide,
There feiz’d me for their prey.
My fbrieks had all been {pent in vain,
But heaven, that faw my griel,
Brought this brave youth within my call.
Who flew to my relief.
With nothing but his hunting fpeai.
And dagger in his hand,
He fprung like lightning on my foes, ,
And caus’d them foon to ftand.


He fought, till more afliftance came ;
The Scots were overthrown;
Thus freed me, captive, from their bands
To make me more his own.
0 happy day ! the youth replied:
Bleft were the wounds I bare !
From that fond hour fhe deign’d to fmile,
And liften to my prayer.
And when die knew my name and birth.
She vowed to be my bride;
But oh! we fear’d, (alas, the while!)
Her princely mother’s pride:
Sifter of haughty Boling broke *
Our houfe’s ancient foe,
To me I thought a banifti’d wight
Could ne’er fuch favour fhow.
Defpairing then to gain confent;
At length to fly with me
1 won this lovely timorous maid \
To Scotland bound are we.
Th is
* Joan, countefs of Weftmoreland, mother of the young lady, was
daughter of John of Gaunt, and half-fifter of king Henry IV,


This evening, as the night drew on,
Fearing we were purfu’d,
We turn’d adown the right-hand path,
And gain’d this lonely wood:
Then lighting from our weary fteeds
To fhun the pelting fliower,
We met thy kind conducing hand,
And reach’d this friendly bower.
Now reft ye both, the Hermit faid;
Awhile your cares foregoe:
Nor, Lady, fcorn my humble bed;

the remains of a fmall building, in which the Hermit dwelt. This confifted

whereas the little Chapel, cut in the folid rock, is ftill very intire and perfeft.

THE HERMIT’s TALE.
Young lord, thy grandhre had a friend
In days of youthful fame;
Yon diftant hills were his domains,
Sir Bertram was his name.
Where’er the noble Percy fought
His friend was at his hde;
And many a fkirrnilh with the Scots
Their early valour try'd.
Y oung


Young Bertram lov’d a beauteous maid s
As fair as fair might be;
The dew-drop on the lily’s cheek
Was not fo fair as fhe.
Fair Widdrington the maiden’s name,
Yon towers her dwelling place; *
Her fire an old Northumbrian chief
Devoted to thy race.
Many a lord, and many a knight
To this fair damfel came;
But Bertram was her only choice;
For him fhe felt a flame.
Lord Percy pleaded for his friend.
Her father foon confents;
None but the beauteous maid herfelf
His wiflies now prevents.
But flie with ftudied fond delays
Defers the blifsful hour;
And loves to try his conftancy,
And prove her maiden power.
That
* Widdrington is about five miles fouth of Warkwortb*


That heart, fhe faid, is lightly priz’d,

Which is too lightly won * V :

Then forth fhe drew a glittering helme
Well-plated many a fold,
The cafque was wrought of tempered, fleel,
The creft of burnifh’d gold.
Sir knight, thy lady fends thee this.
And yields to be thy bride,

Where fharpeft blows are try’d.
Young Bertram took the fhining helme
And thrice he kifs’d the fame:
Truft me, I’ll prove this precious cafque
With deeds of nobleft fame.

To fcour the marches, late oppreft,

And nifties forth to meet his foes;
So did the Douglas rife.
Attendant on their chief’s command
A thoufand warriors wait:
And now the fatal hour drew on
Of cruel keen debate,
A chofen troop of Scottifh youths

Lord Percy mark’d their gallant mien,
And thus his friend addrefs’d.
Now,


Now, Bertram, prove thy Lady’s helme,
Attack yon forward band;
Dead or alive I’ll refcue thee,
Or perifli by their hand.
Young Bertram bow’d, with glad afient,
And fpur’d his eager fteed,
And calling on his Lady’s name,
Rufil’d forth with whirlwind fpeed.
As when a grove of fapling oaks
The livid lightning rends;
So fiercely ’mid the oppofing ranks
Sir Bertram’s fword defcends.
This way and that he drives the fteel,
And keenly pierces thro’ 5
And many a tall and comely knight
With furious force he flew.

Then rufhing in, with ftretch’d out fhield
He o’er the warrior hung;
As fome fierce eagle fpreads her wing
To guard her callow young.

What force could Hand his furious flrokes.
Or meet his martial fire ?

Now gathering round on every part
The battle rag’d • amain ;
And many a lady wept her lord

And all with crlmfon flow’d.

And, after wonderous valour fliown.
They flowly quit the field.

And weltering in his gore

ON E early morn, while dewy drops
Hung trembling on the tree,
Sir Bertram from his Tick-bed rofe,
His bride he would go fee.
r
A brother he had in prime of youth,
Of courage firm and keen,
And he would tend him on the way
Becaufe his wounds were green.
. %
All day o er mols and moor they rode,
By many a lonely tower;
And ’twas the dew-fall of the night
Ere they drew near her bower.
I Moil


Moll drear and dark the caftle feem’d,
That wont to fhine fo bright;
And long and loud hr Bertram call’d

Ere he beheld a light.

With voice fo Thrill and clear :

And oft he deeply hgh’d;
When now the draw-bridge was let down,
And gates fet open wide.

Six days, young knight, are pail and gone,

And fure if no fad harm had hap’d
Long fince thou wouldil her fee.
For when ihe heard thy grievous chance
She tore her hair, and cried,
Alas! I’ve Hain the comelieil knight.
All thro’ my folly and pride!

And his dear health regain,

Now, brother, we’ll our ways divide,
O’er Scottifti hills to range;

And all our drefs we’ll change.
Some Scottifti carle hath feized my love,
And borne her to his den;
And ne’er will I tread Englifh ground
Till ftie is reftored agen.
The brothers ftrait their paths divide,
O’er Scottifti hills to range ;
And hide themfelves in queint difguife,
And oft their drefs they change.

Moft like a Palmer poor,
To halls and caftles wanders round,
And begs from door to door.

Sometimes a Minftrel’s garb he wears,
With pipes fo Tweet and Thrill;
And wends to every tower and town;
O’er every dale and hill.
One day as he fate under a thorn

An aged Pilgrim pafs’d him by,
Who mark’d his face of care.
All Minftrels yet that ever I faw,
Are full of game and glee:
But thou art fad and woe-begone!

As late I chanc’d to crave an alms
About this evening hour,
A thought I heard a Lady’s voice
Lamenting in the tower,
!
And when I afk’d, what harm had hap’d,
What Lady Bek there lay ?
They rudely drove me from the gate,
And bade me wend away.

Thefe tidings caught. Br Bertram’s ear,

And foon he hafted o’er the hills,
And foon he reach’d the vale.

Or may I crave a lodging here.

And here thou ftialt my fupper lhare,

And pipes both loud and clear:
All night he watches round the walls,
In hopes his love to hear.

And o’er the mote was newly laid

Wrapt in a tartan plaid;
A Hilled by a fturdy youth
In highland garb y-clad.
t
Amaz’d, confounded at the light,.
He lay unfeen and Hill;
And foon he faw them crofs the llream,
And mount the neighbouring hill.
\
Unheard, unknown of all within.
The youthful couple fly.
But what can fcape the lover’s ken ?
Or fbun his piercing eye ?
With lilent Hep he follows clofe
Behind the flying pair,
And faw her hang upon his arm
With fond familiar air.
Thanks, gentle youth, Ihe often faid;
My thanks thou well hall won :
For me what wiles hall thou contriv’d ?
For me what dangers run ?
\
L
And


And ever {hall my grateful heart
Thy fervices repay :- —
Sir Bertram could no further hear,
But cried, Vile traitor, flay!
Vile traitor! yield that Lady up!
And quick his fword he drew.
The ftranger turn’d in hidden rage,
And at Sir Bertram flew,
»
With mortal hate their vigorous arms
Gave many a vengeful blow:
But Bertram’s ftronger hand prevail’d,
And laid the ftranger low.
Die, traitor, die ! A deadly thruft
Attends each furious word.
V
Ah! then fair Ifabel knew his voice,
And rulh’d beneath his fword.
O flop, fhe cried, O flop thy arm!
Thou doft thy brother ftay !
And here the Hermit paus’d, and wept:
• His tongue no more could fay.
At


At length he cried, Ye lovely pair,
How fhall I tell the reft ?
Ere I could flop my piercing fword,
It fell, and flab’d her bread:.
s
Wert thou thyfelf that haplefs youth?
Ah! cruel fate! they faid.
The Hermit wept, and fo did they ;
They flgh’d; he hung his head.
0 blind and jealous rage, he cried,
What evils from thee flow ?
The Hermit paus’d; they fllent mourn’d;
He wept, and they were woe.
Ah! when I heard my brother’s name.
And faw my lady bleed,
1 rav’d, I wept, I curfl my arm,
That wrought the fatal deed.
In vain I clafp’d her to my breaft,
And clos’d the ghaftly wound;
In vain I prefs’d his bleeding corpfe,
And rais’d it from the ground.
My


My brother, alas! fpake never more,
His precious life was flown.
She kindly ftrove to footh my pain,*
Regardlefs of her own.
♦
Bertram, flie faid, be comforted,
And live to think on me:
May we in heaven that union prove,
Which here was not to be!
Bertram, flic faid, I ftill was true;
Thou only had ft my heart:
May we hereafter meet in blifs!
We now, alas! mu ft part.
For thee, I left my father’s hall,
And flew to thy relief,
When, lo! near Chiviot’s fatal hills
I met a Scottifh chief,
Lord Malcolm’s fon, whofe proffered love,
I had refus’d with fcorn ;
He flew my guards and feiz’d on me
Upon that fatal morn :
And


And in thefe dreary hated walls
He kept me clofe confin’d;
And fondly fued, and warmly prefs’d
To win me to his mind.
Each rifing morn increas’d my pain,
Each night increas’d my fear;
When wandering in this northern garb
Thy brother found me here.
He quickly form’d this brave defign
To fet me captive free ;
And on the moor his horfes wait
Ty’d to a neighbouring tree.
Then hafte, my love, efcape away,
And for thyfelf provide;
And fometime fondly think on her,
Who fhould have been thy bride.
Thus pouring comfort on my foul
Even with her latelk breath,
She gave one parting fond embrace,
And clos’d her eyes in death.
M
In


In wild amaze, in fpeechlefs woe
Devoid of fenfe I lay:
Then hidden all in frantic mood
I meant my felt to Hay;
And rifmg up in furious hafte
I feiz’d the bloody brand *':
A fturdy arm here interpos’d,
And wrench’d it from my hand.
A crowd, that from the caftle came,
Had mifs’d their lovely ward;
And feizing me to prifon bare,
And deep in dungeon barr’d.
s
( *
It chanc’d that on that very morn
Their chief was prifoner ta’en:
Lord Percy had us foon exchang’d,
O '
And ftrove to foothe my pain.
And foon thofe honoured dear remains,
To England were convey’d;
And there within their filent tombs,
With holy rites were laid.
For
* i* c* Sword.


For me, I loath’d my wretched life,
And oft to end it fought;
Till time, and thought, and holy men
Had better counfels taught.
They rais’d my heart to that pure fource,
Whence heavenly comfort flows:
They taught me to defpife the world,
And calmly bear its woes.
No more the flave of human pride,
Vain hope, and fordid care;
I meekly vowed to fpend my life
In penitence and prayer.

The bold Sir Bertram now no more,
Impetuous, haughty, wild;
But poor and humble Benedict,
Now lowly, patient, mild :
/
My lands I gave to feed the poor,
And facred altars raife;
And here a lonely Anchorete
I came to end my days.
This


This fweet fequeftered vale I chofe,
Thefe rocks, and hanging grove;
For oft befide this murmuring ftream
My love was wont to rove.
My noble Friend approv’d my choice;
This bleft retreat he gave:
And here I carv’d her beauteous form,
And fcoop’d this holy cave.
Full fifty winters, all forlorn,
My life I’ve lingered here;
»
And daily o’er this fculptured flint
I drop the penfive tear.
And thou, dear brother of my heart,
So faithful and fo true,
*
The fad remembrance of thy fate
Still makes my bofom rue!
Yet not unpitied pafs’d my lire,
Forfaken, or forgot,
The Percy and his noble Son
Would grace my lowly cot.
Oft


Oft the great Earl from toils of ftate,
And cumbrous pomp of power,
Would gladly feek my little cell
To fpend the tranquil hour.
But length of life is length of woe,
«
I liv’d to mourn his fall:
I liv’d to mourn his godlike Son, #
Their friends and followers all.
But thou the honours of thy race,
Lov’d youth, flialt now reftore;
And raife again the Percy name
More glorious than before.
He ceas’d, and on the lovely pair

His choiceft bleflings laid;
While they with thanks and pitying tears
His mournful tale repaid.

And now what prefent courfe to take
They afk the good old fire;
And guided by his fage advice

IT will perhaps gratify the curious Reader to be informed, that
from a word or two formerly legible over one of the Chapel
Doors, it is believed that the Text there inferibed was that Latin

My Tears have been my meat day and night.
It is alfo certain, that the memory of the firft Hermit was
held in fuch regard and veneration by the Percy Family;
that .they afterwards maintained a Chantry Prieft, to refide in the
Hermitage, and celebrate Mafs in the Chapel: whofe allowance,
uncommonly liberal and munificent, was continued down to the
Diflblution of the Monafteries; and then the whole Salary, together
with the Hermitage and all its dependencies, reverted back to the
Family, having never been endowed in mortmain. On this ac-
count we have no Record, which fixes the date of the Founda-
tion, or gives any particular account of the firft Hermit; but the
following Inftrument will fhow the liberal Exhibition afforded to
his Succeflbrs. It is the Patent granted to the laft Hermit in 1532,
and is copied from an ancient MS. book of Grants, &c. of the VI th
Earl of Northumberland, in Henry the VUlths time f.

produced before the Court of Augmentation in Michaelmas-Term,
20 Oft. A. 29. Hen. viii. when the fame was allowed by the
Chancellor and Counfel of the faid Court, and all the profits con-
firmed to the incumbent Sir George Lancafter; Excepting that
in compenfation for the annual Stipend of Twenty Marks, he was
to receive a Stipend of Ten Marks, and to have a free Chapel called
The Rood Chapel, dnd the Hofpital of St. Leonard, within the
Barony of Wigdom in the County of Cumberland.

After the perufal of the above Patent it will perhaps be need-
lefs to caution the Reader againft a Miftake, fome have fallen into;
of confounding this Hermitage near Warkworth, with a Chantry
founded within the town itfelf, by Nicholas de Farnham bifhop
of Durham, in the reign of Henry 111. who appropriated the Church
of BranKefton for the maintenance there of two Benedidtine
Monks from Durham |(. That fmall monaftic foundation is
indeed called a Cell by bifhop Tanner -j-: but he muft be very
ignorant
* Sic MS, %S° the MS. The above Sir Richard Rych was Chancellor of
the Augmentations at the Suppreffion of the Monafteries.

ignorant indeed, who fuppofes that by the word Cell Is neceffarily
to be underftood a Hermitage j whereas it was commonly applied to
any fmall conventual eftablifhment which was dependant on another.
As for the Chapel belonging to this endowment of bilhop Farn-
ham, it is mentioned as in ruins in feveral old Surveys of Queen
Elizabeth’s time j and its feite, not far from Warkworth Church, is
ftill remembered. But that there was never more than one Priefl;
, . * , ■ **
maintained, at one and the fame time, within the Hermitage,
is plainly proved (if any further proof is wanting) by the fol-
lowing Extract from a Survey of Warkworth, made in the Year
1567, (j viz.

“ Ther Is in the Parke (fc. of Warkworth) alfo one Howfe

“ Chapel : In the fame ther haith bene one Preast keaped,
“ which did fuch godlye Services as that tyme was ufed and cele-
“ brated. The Mantion Howfe [fc. the fmall building adjoining

ODE PINDARIQUE,
A L’OCCASION DE LA NOBLE ET GLORIEUSE
INSURRECTION DES ESPAGNOLS
CONTRE LES FRANÇIS.
Trop long-temps Teffroi de la terre,
As-tu, Mars, en de viles mains,
Permis Tabus de ton tonnerre,
Extemiinateur des humains:
D’un Monstre digne du supplice,
Ah! cesse d’etre le complice;
Viens mettre un terme & ses fureurs:
Si la bravoure et le courage,
Des mortels m6ritent Thommage,
C’est lorsqulls en sont les vengeurs.


L&che assassin, dont la jactance,
Nagu&re, assourdissoit les airs,
Si nous jugeons par ton silence,
Enfin tu connois des Severs.
L’amour sacre de la patrie,
Aux tiers enfans de Tlberie,
A done fait entendre sa voix;
Ministres saints des Eumenides,
Enfin de tes .frames perfides,
Us s’arment pour venger les Rois.
D6ja plus juste, la Victoire,
Fuyant tes inf Ames drapeaux,
Sur ton Chef depouille de gloire,
Invoque le fer des bourreaux;
Et la voix de la Renommee,
Par toi si long-temps comprimee,
Plus v6ridique desormais,
Lasse de d6corer tes crimes,
Dans tes projets illegi times,
N’annonce plus que tes forfaits.


Qu’est done devenu ton courage ?
Tu fuis; vil oppresseur des Rois!
Le Guadalquivir et le Tage
Arretent tes affreux exploits.
Pour vous, Peuples de Germanic,
Quelle nouvelle ignominie!
Vojez! d’Austerlitz le Heros,
D6solateur de vos campagnes,
Aux braves guerriers des Espagnes,
Est reduit a tourner le dos.
D'une noble et sainte harmonic,
Connoissez les fruits ;
Jamais nation bien unie
/
Subit-elle un joug odieux ?
Germains, chez vous, si la concorde,
Calmant vos levains de discorde,
Vous eht guides dans les combats,
Vous eussiez vu vos champs arides
Engloutir les spectres livides
De ses mis6rables soldats.
B


Par vos malheurs rendus plus sages,
H&tez de les mettre & profit;
La foudre de nouveaux orages
Sourdement au loin retentit.
Ju,
Pour laver I’affront des Ibhres,
De ses 16gions sanguinaires,

Tyran, que nul respect ne touche,
II n’est crime qui Teffarouche,

Forment leurs bataillons horribles.
Pour venger ses projets rompus.

De son orgueil, laches esclaves,
Par le desespoir rendus braves,
Ces impitoyables guerriers
Se flattent sur vos territoires,
Par de plus faciles victoires,

De voir reverdir leurs launers.


Vous, peuples dc, Tautre Hesperie,
Jadis si feconde eu heros,
D’une somniffere incurie,
* j- '
N’osez-vous rompre le repos?
Enfans d’une race intrepide,
N’6tes-vous qu’un troupeau timidc,
Enerve par le go At des arts?
Ardens a repousser I’insulte,
Montrez que des Muses le culte
Rend plus propre a celui de Mars.
Quel peuple eut jamais tant d’injures,
A venger sur ses oppresseurs?
Quel sol a vu plus de souillures?
De plus infames ravisseurs ?
De profanations des temples;
De crimes qui n'ont point d’exeraples;
D’embrasemens, d’assassinats ;
L’Age, la foiblesse et I’enfance,
Objets de Faffreuse licence,
De demons v6tus en soldats ?

Qu'il soit Chrome qui puisse absoudre
Front comme le tien odieux.
Des Hois la Majeste sacr6e.
Par les peuples n’est r6veree,
Qu’autant qu’ils sont leurs bienfaiteurs:
Mais sache qu’il n est diadtmie,
Qui garde d'un juste anath£me,
La t£te des usurpateurs.


O France! 6 coupable mar&tre!

Que ta main, vingt ans idol&tre,
A sacrifie tes enfans!

Et toujours prete 4 leur complaire,
Du sang et des pleurs de la terre,
Baignant a grands dots leurs autels,
Veux-tu, par tes propres blessures,
Jusque chez les races futures,
Etre encor I’effroi des mortels ?
Ainsi, pour des monstres perfides,
Au m6pris des plus saintes lois,
Tu plongeas tes mains parricides,
Dans le sang du meilleur des Rois!
Et ta rage, que rien n’appaise,
Apr&s avoir d’un Louis Seize,
Transmis le sceptre a des ,
Pour combler ta triste manie,
Lui reservoit Fignominie
De passer a NapolSon!


Du moins cette fois ton delire,
D’avance, revile aux humains,
Quel sort les attend sous Tempire
Commis a ses feroces mains :
Malgre lour decevante amorce,
Les succhs de ton Brigand Corse
N'appellent sur toi que raalheurs;
La legitime; Monarchic,
Triomphante de I’anarchie,
Seule a droit d'essuyer tes plcurs.
Rappelez-vous ces jours de gloire,
Oh, sous de plus justes drapeaux,
Franpois, une humaine victoire
O - X i 5
Honoroit vos nobles travaux:
La jointe au courage,
Du soldat alors le partage,
Terap6roit sa ferocite;
Au fort des combats intrepide,
II eht fremi d’etre homicide,
Hors d’urgente necessite.


1/honneur, alors d'un ton
Plaidoit la cause du vaincu ;
Le vainqueur ne voyoit qu*un fr&re,
Quand Fennemi s J 6toit rendu:
Telle, du pouvoir legitime,
Fut Tin variable maxime,
Chkre encore au coeur des Bourbons ;
Et loin que leur bont6 tarisse, .
Elle attend le moment propice
Pour vous pardonner leurs affronts.
