TEA TIME
There was a little girl called Judy. One
evening she sat down to her tea. She was
hungry, but there was nothing on the table.
Soon Judy?s mother arrived home with lots
of parcels from the shops. Then, in a few
minutes, tea was ready and Judy was enjoying
all the good things her mother had brought

WASHING DAY
Monday is a very busy day for us Mothers.
The children?s clothes must be washed and
hung out to dry, and as we have a nice big tub
of soapy water, we usually bath the Dolls too,
but we don?t hang them up to dry on the line.
They must be dried with a clean towel.


SHOPPING
Now this shopping is quite a problem for
us housekeepers. The prices of things are so
dreadfully high. I don?t know how I?m going
to make ends meet this month.


STORY TIME
Before I put the children off to bed each
night, we have Story Time, and that?s the time
they like the best. Seated all around they listen
carefully and never interrupt while I read them
the lovely stories of Fairies and Elves, and
Bunnies and things. I must say they behave
very well while I?m reading.


GATHERING FRUIT
When the fruit gets ripe and juicy, Betty
loves to pick it from the trees. ?Oh, I wish I
could reach those big ones at the top,? she
cried. Just then a friendly breeze came along
and rocked the tree and made those big ones
fall into her skirt. So Betty?s wish was success-
ful that time.

PEEP BO
A small boy called Tommy used to like
peeping around the edges of doors and comers.
He was very shy. One day Tommy went to
the circus and saw a man get in the lion?s cage.
He thought it was wonderful to see such
bravery. So he decided to be brave too. He
wasn?t shy any more or frightened of anything.

TEARS
One day a little girl went out
walking on her own. There were
lots of interesting things to see
and play with along the way.
When she was tired she decided
to go back home. But, looking
around, she didn't know which
way to go. She was lost. Sitting
down on the ground she began
to cry. But luckily, some friends
came by in their car and saw her.
They took her with them and
*
she was home in no time. She
was very careful not to go far
away by herself again

AT THE SEASIDE
Don?t we have lovely fun at the beach, build-
ing big castles and forts in the sand. It doesn?t
matter if you fall and get covered in sand,
?cause you can always run down to the water
and let the big waves wash you clean again.


WASHING THE DISHES
Joan is very good at housework. She makes
lots and lots of frothy bubbles when washing
dishes and is most careful not to drop the
crockery. When the tea towel gets wet she hangs
it neatly on the line to dry, just like Mummy does.


BED TIME
With all the toys packed away tidily, Dolly
and I get ready to say our prayers and jump
into bed. Then Mummy will tuck us in the
blankets, kiss us goodnight and switch out the
light. Soon - we?ll be in Dreamland.

THE DOLLS? OUTING
I like to take my Dolls for an outing every
day the air is so good for them. And besides,
it?s very fashionable to go out walking in the
Park every afternoon. Especially if you have
a new pram with a Dolly in it.

THE BATH
There?s not much room in the tub for Teddy
Bear when Peter begins to splash around. What
fun it is when the soft bubbles froth up around
you. Little Rags, the doggy, would like to get
in too when Peter is having such fun

BED TIME
Doris is a very good mother and rocks her
Dolls to sleep every night. She makes all their
clothes too, and even their bed clothes. Don?t
you think the patchwork quilt is pretty? The
Dolls find it lovely and warm, too, on those
winter nights.

DRESSING
Now this is where I always strike trouble.
Somehow the wrong foot gets into the wrong
leg of the trousers and I get them on back to
front. Then I have to take them off and start
all over again and make sure that I get them
on properly.
