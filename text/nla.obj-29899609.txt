GOULBURN.
On Southern Tablelands a city fair
Is set ’mid gentle hills and quiet streams,
Which thread their silv’ry way towards the sea,
Past fields of orchard, pasture and of farm.
A rocky eminence, memorial-crowned,
Keeps faithful watch o’er stream and street and cot,
And ’minds the thoughtful citizen of those
Who faced death gladly for their country’s weal.
Goulburn arise! what though the captious few
Revile thy winter cold and forceful winds!
It was in such a climate that the best
Of Britons climbed to vigour and success,
What though the dour and narroiv-visioned soul
Finds nought to praise and little to content!
Progress depends not upon such as these.
The wider outlook and the generous heart,
The decent wish to see the city thrive,
The honest effort for the common good,
These things abound among thy native-born;
And the same love, which urged thy noble sons
To sail o’er seas and face a foreign foe,
Is lying latent, waiting for the call —
Not from the trumpet now, leading to war;
But from thy peaceful streets and quiet fields,
Thy sjjacious parks and churches beautiful —
The clarion call to service, unalloyed
With selfish interest or petty clique.
Goulburn arise! and let thy children feel
Pride of thy beauty surging in their hearts,
Love of their city urging them to deeds,
Till thou at last fulfil thy destiny!
Brig. Gen. Sir W. R. McNicoll,
“E.P.P.” 29/4/1931




When it was suggested to the Goulburn City Council
that the time was opportune to launch a '‘History of
Goulburn” the Aldermen unanimously approved of the pro-
posal, but in compiling a book of this character many points
had to be considered, most of all, who would be capable of
doing justice to it? Apart from its historical value the
humour and pathos associated with the old pioneering days
must of necessity be faithfully portrayed. The choice of
the Council fell upon Mr. Eansome T. Wyatt, who after
three years of intensive research has very satisfactorily
completed his task.
This capable and versatile writer has faithfully written
the history of Goulburn as well as having woven into its
pages all the sentiment and lore that will make the work a
happy reproduction of the joys and sorrows of our brave
and sturdy pioneers who made it possible for Goulburn to
live up to its early title "Queen City of the South.”
Within its hundreds of pages you will find facts you
little dreamed of, historical facts far stranger than fiction;
incidents recorded which paint for you a vivid picture of
those momentous early days when Australia struggled for
its manhood. Much of what is typically Australian not
only here but throughout the length and breadth of our
sunny land is to be found scattered throughout these remark-
able pages and to those who, like myself, are proud of our
noble city, I sincerely and honestly recommend this splendid
monument of patient research and infallible fact.
As a member of a family associated with this City and
District for over a century I earnestly commend this work
as a true record of the self-sacrificing and capable work of
the great men and women of the past of whom we are justly
proud, and I trust that this book will be a fitting tribute
to their sacred memories.

CHAPTER I.
GOULBURN OF TO-DAY.
HE citizens of Gouiburn would expect this chapter to
be the concluding one of a work upon the history of
the city. The visitor or stranger will probably find
it more useful here. Another title might well be “What
to see in Gouiburn” and to that extent its contents will
involve some repetition for the fuller history of many of
the features mentioned here will be told in subsequent
chapters.
Without indulging in heroics, descending to journalese,
or using such hackneyed phrases as “The Queen City of the
South” or the “Inland Capital of N.S.W.,” it is possible
to shew that Gouiburn itself is deserving of much more and
longer attention than it receives from the thousands of
tourists who pass through each year.
Neither is another phrase, frequently used in tourist
pamphlets, “The front door to the Federal Capital,” an
adequate description. Gouiburn is neither the front door
nor the back door to the Federal Capital. It will probably
tend to be overshadowed by its new neighbour (new by the
standards of Gouiburn’s respectable antiquity) but there
is no rivalry between Gouiburn and Canberra. On the
contrary their interests are so different that there is not
even the intercourse that might be expected.
Gouiburn is an inland city of N.S.W., situated on the
Southern Highlands of the Great Dividing Range, 136 miles
by road and one more by rail from Sydney. Its height
above sea-level, 2074 feet, ensures it a temperate and equable
climate. Its enemies and detractors are apt to suggest that
it is a trifle breezy at times, but there is the highest medical
testimony to the fact that even its westerly winds are
healthy.
It is not a beautiful city in the sense in which Canberra
is beautiful, but it is picturesque and interesting for the
main part. The utilitarian character of the buildings on
the outskirts and approaches to the city detract from its
appearance and give little indication of the better things
to be found within its boundaries.
The population of the municipality is 15,260, that of the
immediate district is 18,000.


Sometimes it is asked: Why is Goulburn where it is?
What does it do? First of all it is a great distributing
centre. It is on the main southern line from Sydney to
Melbourne, and is the junction for the Canberra, Cooma,
Bombala, Crookwell and Taralga lines. It is the centre of
a fertile district famous for its cattle, sheep, potatoes and
fruit. It has important secondary industries, producing
textiles, boots, flour, soap, cordials and condiments. Goul-
burn is the largest store stock market in the Commonwealth.
Important wool sales are also held here.
Government enterprises include extensive railway works
(not so important perhaps as they might be in these days of
excessive centralisation), the Reformatory, and the Mental
Hospital, whilst Goulburn is the centre of a large Land
Board District.
It enjoys all the amenities of a modern city, electricity,
gas, water, sewerage, good schools, primary, technical and
secondary. There are excellent hospitals and ambulance
services, two cathedrals and churches of the larger denomina-
tions, an aerodrome, a broadcasting station and libraries.
Goulburn offers many facilities to the sportsman. Golf,
tennis, bowls, cricket, hockey, football, trotting, racing, grey-
hounds, boating, fishing and swimming, all have their clubs
and organisations.
Within easy reach by good roads are the Grand Canyon
and Caves at Bungonia, the Wombeyan Caves, the Aber-
crombie Caves, Lake George, Lake Bathurst, Collector,
Bundanoon, Tallong, Burrinjuck, and Canberra. Tallowa
wild life sanctuary is 35 miles from Goulburn.
The city itself is not devoid of interest. It has fine
public buildings, and modern shops, whilst for the anti-
quarian there are odd nooks of early colonial architecture.
The Towrang stockade with its adjacent convict-built cul-
verts and bridge is one such. Nine banks have their branches
here.
The War Memorial on the top of Rocky Hill, overlooking
the city, is familiar to all train travellers, in addition to
being flood lit at night, it now carries an air-beacon.
In the meantime the Municipal Council has itself made
history in publishing this book. Whatever the merits or
demerits of this work may be, the decision to compile and


publish the history of the eity is wholly commendable and
unusually enterprising.
For a city of such respectable antiquity Goulburn has
strangely enough lost most of its old colonial architecture.
Many of its old buildings stand as, e.g. in Grafton Street,
(the old township) and in Auburn Street (the main street
of the new) but have lost their identity under successive
alterations and remodelling with their attendant evils of
stucco, rough-cast, paint and cantilever awnings.
Goulburn has suffered from two waves of injudicious
restoration. The first was in its period of commercial ex-
pansion, the ’7o’s and the ’Bo’s of last century, perhaps the
most inartistic period of the whole Victorian era. The second
was in the hurried erection of new fronts in Auburn Street
in recent years which followed upon the ukase to remove the
old verandahs and verandah posts.
Whatever its hotels have gained in convenience they
have lost in individuality by the camouflaging of their old
brickwork in standardised brewery pattern tiles. In the
city area only two genuine “old Colonial’ 7 buildings remain
—“Riversdale” at North Goulburn, the home of the Twynam
family and the “St. Clair” cottage in Sloane Street, now' a
guest house.
Both these are illustrated in W. H. Wilson’s “Old
Colonial Architecture”*
Of its modern buildings neither of its Cathedrals, none
of its Churches, nor the Court House, stand upon command-
ing sites. Too often the cars of visitors dash through
without suspecting their existence.
Of the buildings erected in recent years the A.M.P.
building and that of the Commonwealth Bank are the most
satisfying. Both utilise local stone, properly worked, with-
out building shams. An older building but of artistic
design is the Bank of Australasia. The Commercial Banking
Company of Sydney is a solid utilitarian structure. The
Bank of New South Wales is a reconstruction, the front
of cement painted, the back a mid-Victorian mansion. The
stores are mainly modern fronts on old buildings with an

undue proportion of cemented and painted walls. A notable
exception is J. W. Craig ’s furniture shop which shows good
brick work, as does the Liedertafel Hall adjoining. So too
does the “Fireside Inn” in Market Street. The two largest
stores, despite the enormous sums represented in their plate
glass windows, have no architectural merit whatsoever.
The oldest building in Goulburn is a stone barn behind
‘ ‘ Riversdale. ’ ’ This is described by the late Chas. MacAlister
as the ‘ ‘ first stone building ever erected in Goulburn. 9 9 He
gives the history as “Matt Healey’s stables” which would
fix its date as 1833 or possibly earlier.* It is mentioned
elsewhere in this history.
The most interesting group of buildings in Goulburn
is the old Lansdowne homestead with its great convict built
barns of stone with solid cedar stalls and feed boxes. On
* MacAlister “Old Pioneering Days,” page 13.


this property too stands the building known as the Jewish
Synagogue. It is said to have been built originally by
N. C. Phillips as a summer-house and afterwards by Em-
manuel as a Synagogue. It has been a picturesque ruin for
many years now.
The stone barn at “Rossiville” shows good work too.
Auburn Street, the main street of the city, was first
seriously formed in 1843, although it was in use long before
that. Tenders were called for paving part of it in 1850.
It has recently been concreted for the greater part of its
length. It contains the chief business premises of the city.
At its extreme south end stands the Gill Memorial (Salvation
Army) Boys’ Home. Between that and the Clinton Street
intersection on the East side is the little mission Church of
the Good Shepherd (Anglican) and on the west side the
South Goulburn Public School and the Drill Hall.
In the block from Verner Street to Montague Street,
on the east side stand the Town Hall, the Post Office and
the Mechanics’ Institute. Between Montague Street and
Market Streets, to the east of Auburn Street lie the Belmore
Gardens. Throughout its length the banks and the principal
stores will be found.
The premises of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance
Society Ltd. at the corner of Auburn Street and Clifford
Streets with its octagonal clock tower were built in 1933 by
Concrete Constructions Ltd., of Sydney, from designs by
Hennessy and Hennessy and Coy.*
In the block between Clifford and Goldsmith Streets is
the Empire Theatre. In the next block on the west is the
Broadway Theatre, on the east is the Ritz Theatre. A little
further is the Bowling Club, whilst at the extreme northern
end, beyond the Sydney road turn-off, is St. Nicholas’ Church
(Anglican), its hall and rectory.
Market Street, on the North side of Belmore Park, was
anciently of more importance than it is now. Its most
interesting feature is the stone archway built by Bull and
Woodward, in 1843. The building which now houses the
Railway Institute was formerly an early store, Butler’s. The
Goulburn Club was the old-time “Medical Hall,” the story
of which is told in the chapter on “Professions.” The
* “E.P.P. ” 2/6/1933.

Soldiers’ Club formerly the Protestant Hall, is next door.
The “Commercial” Hotel, now the “Goulburn,” although
nearly a century old, shows nothing of its ancient features.
Verner Street, running east and west, has the Railway
Station at its southern end. The timber yards of Messrs.
Burns Bros. Ltd., stand on the site of Captain HovelPs
residence and gardens. On the opposite side is the
“Southern Cross” (R.C.) Club. Crossing Auburn Street,
the Roman Catholic Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul stands
on the corner of Bourke Street, with Presbytery, Bishop’s
House, St. Patrick’s School, St. Brigid’s School and Our Lady
of Mercy Convent and school adjoining. Diagonally opposite
is the Goulburn Technical School. Three blocks further
on is Victoria Park, the Sportsground and the Baths.
Montague Street, running east and west and crossing
Auburn Street, is now given over to offices. The lawyers
have made this street their own. The Argyle Inn, long de-
licensed, still stands here. Elmslea Chambers, the rococo
building with the extraordinary colour-scheme, was built by
P. f Leahy. The very modern looking building on the opposite
side is a recent reconstruction of a building once owned by
the Rev. Robert Cartwright. The lower section of Montague


Street has the Court House and the C.W.A. Rooms on one
side and the Belmore Cardens on the other.
Sloane Street contains the railway station and railway
workshops and is somewhat unattractive in consequence. The
Lands Office opposite is housed in the old Court House dating
from 1848. Further on, past the gardens, are the Police
Barracks. Conolly’s Mill incorporates the old municipal
baths, the old Presbyterian manse and the former Presby-
terian school room. No. 318 is the “St. Clair” cottage.
Bourke Street, running north and south, parallel to
Auburn Street, has at its south end the Roman Catholic
Boys’ Orphanage, the Roman Catholic group of buildings,
Cathedral, convent and schools, between the Clinton Street
and the Verner Street intersections, the Technical College,
the Baptist Church, St. Saviour’s (Anglican) Cathedral Hall,
Rectory and Diocesan Offices, the Bourke Street Public
School, the Methodist Church and St. John of God (R.C.)
Hospital. Church Street, which runs out of Bourke Street
on its western side, has in No. 10 the original denominational
school, built in 1839. Clifford Street, running east and
west, has near its Sloane Street end the Salvation Army
Citadel on the one side and the Ambulance Station on the
other. In the next block is the Presbyterian Church whilst
further west, near the Faithful Street intersection, is a quaint
building with columns and balcony over the footpath. This
was formerly the Argyle Brewery.
Goldsmith Street, also running east and west, contains
the Methodist Church, Sunday School and Parsonage, the
District Hospital and the High School. Cowper Street is
a continuation of the Yass Road. On the Yass Road, just
outside the city, lies the new showground. In Cowper
Street west is the Cowper Street Methodist Church and
Sunday School.
To notice some of these features in detail :
The War Memorial.
Is familiar to all travellers on the southern line, and
is now more frequently visited by the passing motorist.
It is a square tower 65 feet high, on a base 50 feet square
and is built on Rocky Hill, an eminence overlooking the
city on the east. The late W. J. Bartlett gave the site
and 80 acres of land. The memorial was built by public


subscription in 1923 at a cost of £4OOO. The tower has
look-out galleries on all four sides and is crowned with
a heavy overhanging cornice. The base of the tower forms
a war museum. On the memorial tablets are inscribed the
2500 names of men who enlisted from the city and district.
H. C. Manfred was the architect and H. I. Ibbotson the con-
tractor. The tower is flood-lit at night and, in addition,
carries an airways beacon. A memorial road runs from
Eastgrove to its foot. The view from the summit is well
worth the trip. The two captured guns at the War Memorial
were brought to Goulburn in 1920. One is a German howit-
zer captured by the 45th Battalion at Villers Bretonneux,
and was used against the retreating Germans by the 110 th
Battery. The other is a 150 mm., captured by the Ist A.L.H.
in a skirmish near Mafrak in Palestine in September 1917.*
The Town Hall.
The Town Hall in Auburn Street is a pleasing structure
in the Queen Anne style. It was built by Wilkie in 1887.
The architect was E. C. Manfred. His son, H. C. Manfred,
was the architect for the recent additions. It contains a
collection of portraits of the civic fathers and the King’s
College Honour Board. The tablet in the Town Hall shewing
the names of all the Mayors of Goulburn since its incorpora-
tion was the gift of Alderman Goodhew in 1932. f
The Post Office.
In Auburn Street was built in 1880/1881 from designs
by the Colonial Architect. It has a frontage of 162 feet
to that street. The clock tower is 92 feet high. The archi-
tect called it “The Italian style with Doric details.”
The Court House.
In Montague Street was built in 1887 from designs
by the Colonial Architect. It is well worth a visit, if only for
the beautiful grounds in which it is situated. The old
building to the south west is the former Court House and
now accommodates the Lands Office. The Police Station,
fronting Sloane Street, adjoins. In the south east corner
of the grounds stands the new C.W.A. Rest Room and offices.
The carving on the Court House gate pillars was done by
David Balden of Sydney, in 19004

Soldiers’ Club.
This block of buildings in Market Street was formerly
the Protestant Hall and was built by the Protestant Hall
Company Ltd., all about 1884. The site was purchased and
the company formed in 1880. # It was purchased by public
subscription organised by the Yen. Archdeacon Ward in 1920
and converted to its present uses. The architect for the
reconstruction was Sir Charles Rosenthal. It is vested in
trustees. The Returned Soldiers’ Club occupies one wing.
The rest of the building is let as offices.
St. Saviour’s Cathedral.
St. Saviour’s Cathedral is the second church that has
stood upon the site. The first was a brick building with a
square tower, erected in 1848. An oil painting of this
building hangs in the vestry. In 1863 the Diocese of Goul-
burn was founded but Bishop Thomas did not find it possible
to begin the building of a cathedral until 1874. The build-
ing itself cost £25,000. This does not include the cost of
special gifts for furnishings and windows. It could not be
built now for twice that sum. The foundation stone of the
Cathedral was laid on the 15th January, 1874. The Cathedral
was dedicated and licensed on the 29th April, 1884. Out
of debt in 1916, the Cathedral was consecrated on September
24th that year. The Cathedral is a cruciform building con-
sisting of chancel, nave and transepts, all with aisles. Its
dimensions are: Internal length, east to west 150 feet; width
of nave and aisles 54 feet; length of transepts, north to south,
96 feet; width of transepts 54 feet. The style of the build-
ing is that of the English “Decorated” period. The material
of the building is local (Bundanoon) sandstone, with pillars
of Pyrmont freestone. The architect was E. T. Blacket.
Upon his death the building was completed under the super-
vision of his sons, A. and C. Blacket. The names of the
contractors have been preserved; they were R. and J. Turner,
Duncan, Nelson, Le Breton, Stone and Brigdale, H. Langley,
A. A. Marshall and Coy., F. C. W. Richard. The capitals
and bosses were carved by Tinkler (Sydney) and the medal-
lions and reredos by W. P. Macintosh (Forest Lodge).
The High Altar is of English oak to a rich design by
Jones and Willis of Exeter, a memorial to Bishop Barlow,
third Bishop of Goulburn. The old altar of renaissance

design is now in the Bishop Thomas Memorial Chapel. The
reredos, a gift of Mrs. Thomas, is also a memorial to him. It
is a copy in Oamarn freestone of da Vinci’s “Last Supper.”
The communion vessels, which are of silver, were the gift
of Mrs. O’Brien of Donro. The vessels used in the Soldiers’
Memorial Chapel are of gold, the gift of Fred Campbell.
Another chalice in more frequent use was the gift of P. J.
Meyer in memory of his mother. Another set of vessels
preserved in the Cathedral belongs to the Mission Church of
the Good Shepherd, South Goulburn. It was purchased out
of the balance of the Archdeacon Bartlett Memorial Fund.
The processional cross is of silver, a memorial to Bishop
Barlow subscribed for by his ordinands. The verger’s mace,
in silver and enamel, was bought by public subscription as
a memorial to Wm. Toombs, for many years verger of the
Cathedral. The altar ornaments are of brass. The cross
was the gift of Bishop Barlow. The candle-sticks were the
gift of Archdeacon Ward, another memorial to Bishop
Barlow. The font stands under the north-western arch of
the nave and is of Caen stone. The architect and sculptor
were respectively Chatwin and John Roddis, both of Bir-
mingham. It is square with canted angles; in each angle
is a niche containing an image of one of the Evangelists.
The four sides consist of sculptured panels representing the
baptism of our Lord, our Lord blessing the children, the
baptism of the centurion and the baptism of the eunuch.
The font canopy, in Queensland maple, by F. W. Tod
of Sydney, was given by the Seaborn family. The throne
is of oak from a design by the Cathedral architect, E. T.
Blacket. The pastoral staff was subscribed for and pre-
sented to the late Bishop Barlow on his return from England
in 1912 by the clerical and lay members of Synod. It is of
silver and good Gothic design. Bishop Thomas suggested
the design for the pulpit which was executed by the same
sculptor as the font, John Roddis of Birmingham. Like the
font it is of Caen stone, supported by five marble pillars. The
central figure is that of the Christ, the niche to the right
contains a figure of Elijah. On the left are Moses, St. Paul
and St. Peter.
The dean’s stall on the south side of the chancel was
the gift of Dean Pownall. The priest’s stall on the north
side is a memorial to the late Matron Uhr. The litany desk


1


is a memorial to the late Canon D’Arcy Irvine. The brass
eagle lectern was the gift of Frederick Tooth. It was
executed by Jones and Willis of London and Birmingham.
The organ is by Foster and Son of York, England. It con-
tains 43 stops and 2252 pipes. The wind is supplied by a
“Discus” blower worked by an electric motor in the tower
porch. On the walls of the chancel, nave and transepts are
medallions carved in Oamaru stone by the late W. P. Mac-
intosh. Much of the earlier stained glass in the Cathedral
must now be considered inferior. The east window and the
clerestory windows are, however, good. Of the windows
in the nave those on the north contain representations of the
parables of our Lord; those on the south depict the miracles.
The clerestory windows in the nave and transepts are
reserved for saints of the English Church, those in the chan-
cel for New Testament saints. Those in the north transept
are Old Testament subjects; those in the south New Testa-
ment. The mural tablets in the Cathedral with few
exceptions such as the diocesan memorial to Bishop Thomas
are inferior in design and workmanship. There is a large
number of them.
The Bishop Thomas Memorial Chapel is the little chapel
comprised in part of the north choir aisle. It was formed
in. 1903 as a memorial to the first bishop of the diocese. The
Soldiers’ Chapel of St. Michael and St. George in the north
transept is the diocesan soldiers’ memorial chapel. This
was erected in 1922 at a cost of £5523, from designs by
Burcham Clamp and Mackellar. The materials and work-
manship of the chapel are entirely Australian. The screens,
panels and reredos are of Bundanoon stone, the altar table
and rails and sanctuary floor of Australian marble, the
furniture of Queensland maple, the chapel floor of tallow
wood. The whole of the work was executed by the firm
of James Turner, Goulburn, the chief craftsman being P. H.
Nourse. The silver altar cross and candlesticks were de-
signed after the pattern of the “Cross of Sacrifice” placed
in the soldiers’ cemeteries in Flanders and France. St.
Christopher’s Children’s Chapel is in the south transept. The
altar and credence are a memorial to Mrs. Seaborn, wife of
a pioneer priest of the diocese, and her son, Leslie W. S.
Seaborn.
There are three graves adjoining the Cathedral. On


the north-east are the graves of Bishop Thomas and Dean
Pownall; on the south-east Bishop Chalmers is buried.*
The Cathedral Bell is hung on the stump of the tower.
It was cast in 1858 for old St. Saviour’s Church, by George
Mears and Coy., at their Whitechapel foundry. It weighs
11 cwt. There is no reference to its purchase in the parochial
minute books.!
For fifty years the Cathedral has remained unfinished.
Two generations have enjoyed its use and its beauty, yet it
still lacks a floor, vestries, tower and spire, whilst its sur-
roundings leave much to be desired. Several times in that
fifty years appeals have been launched for its completion.
On occasions plans and specifications have been prepared and
tenders called for. The time is approaching when this can
be faced as there is now some £10,500 in hand towards the
cost, estimated at £30,000.
Adjoining the Cathedral is the Church Hall, a fine stone
building built in 1874, E. T. Blacket was the architect and
K. B. Turner the builder.! The building played an important
part in the Rossi suits. To the north stands the Cathedral
rectory, built in 1916, from designs by E. C. Manfred. To
the south-west are the diocesan offices, an administrative
block, built in 1923 from designs by Burcham Clamp and
MacKellar. Here is the diocesan library, well worth a
visit.
SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral.
The Cathedral stands at the intersection of Verner and
Bourke Streets. Formerly a small brick church stood upon
the site. In 1872 the building of the present Cathedral was
begun, but the main portion was not undertaken until 1885-
1886. The Cathedral was erected outside the old church,
which was used as a sanctuary to the unfinished Cathedral.
When the Cathedral was complete, the old church was de-
molished and its materials removed through the doors of the
enclosing shell. The Cathedral is cruciform and comprises
nave, chancel, transepts, tower and sacristy. Its proportions
are impressive, but its detail not so good. The material is
local blue-green stone with dressing of Marulan sandstone.

The interior measures 141 feet by 33 feet the aisles 75
feet by .14 feet, the transepts 33 feet by 30 feet, the tower
24 feet square rises to a height of 100 feet. There is a
lantern at the crossing. The organ was built by Hill and
Sons, London, and was the gift of Mrs. Dalglish who also
gave a large window to the memory of her husband.
The Cathedral was designed by Chas. Spadacini of Goul-
burn, and A. Stombuco, the diocesan architect; the con-
tractors were W. J. Furber and Turner Bros. The Cathedral
was opened and blessed by Cardinal Moran on 29/6/1890.*
To the east of the Cathedral in Verner Street is the
Presbytery and the Bishop’s House. Opposite is St. Patrick’s
Hall and the primary school and the new technical school
and diocesan library.
Adjoining the Cathedral on the Bourke Street frontage
is St. Brigid’s primary school and part of the conventual
buildings. Our Lady of Mercy College and school occupies
the balance of the Bourke and Clinton Street frontages.
SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral is pictured, before it
was built, with the tower surmounted by a very plain cap
or spirelet. This was never built and its omission was
probably an improvement on the original design.!
SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral was restored in 1928 at
a cost of £16,500. The sanctuary was floored in marble
and a new high altar and side altars added. The high altar
was originally the gift of Mrs. A. A. Dalglish and was to
the memory of her father A. G. de Lauret, who died 25th
December, 1881. It was reconstructed in 1928 by the same
donor. The altar of the Sacred Heart is to the memory
of Bishop Gallagher, that of the B.V. Mary to the memory
of Bishop Lanigan. Towards the cost -of the altar rails
Frank Kelly gave £520. The children of St. Brigid’s pri-
mary school gave the Bishop’s throne. The organ was the
gift of the de Lauret family.;):
St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church.
The church stands in Clifford Street, a brick structure
in a free Gothic style. It was built in 1924-5, the architects
were, Power, Munning and Adams of Sydney, and the

builder, H. C. Gould of Goulburn. The pulpit is in memory
of Katherine Budden; the font in memory of J. T. Lemon.
The Communion Table and chairs are in memory of Mrs.
Andrew Mclntosh. The Honour Roll, removed from the
old church, was given in memory of James Thorburn. A
ministers’ roll was given by the Carmichael family in
memory of their parents. The Masonic memorial to the Rev.
Win. Ross stands in the grounds.* There are two tablets
to the memory of the Rev. A. Crowther Smith, one in the
church and one in the hall. The Sunday School Hall, built
in 1929, stands at the rear. The manse, purchased in 1937,
•stands further up the street on the site of Caroline Chisholm’s
Immigration Barracks.
The Methodist Church.
Stands at the corner of Bourke and Goldsmith Streets
and is a large brick Gothic building with a tower and spire.
It was built in 1870. The new parsonage, built in 1939,
adjoins, on the Goldsmith Street frontage, and the lecture
hall and Sunday School group of buildings are next door.
The lecture hall embodies the original chapel built in 1848.
Other Churches.
The Baptist Church, next door to the Technical School
in Bourke Street, was originally Trinity Presbyterian
Church. It was built in 1887. The Salvation Army Citadel
is in Clifford Street. It was originally built by the Y.M.C.A.
St. Nicholas’, North Goulburn, (Anglican) was designed
by E. T. Blacket and built in 1870-80. Christ Church, West
Goulburn (Anglican) was designed by Canon Soares and
built in 1884. The Cowper Street Methodist Church was
built in 1924.
Belmore Park.
Right in the centre of the city is Belmore Park, a de-
lightful oasis in the commercial bricks and mortar. It was
the original market place. The story of its gradual conver-
sion to a garden is told in the chapter on Local Government.
In the centre is the.oak planted by Lady Belmore in 1869,
referred to in greater detail, in the chapter on the Railway.
It carries a commemorative tablet. Immediately opposite
the oak is the stone or column which Mayor Davies put up

in 1868 to commemorate the resumption of municipal govern-
ment and for which the council shabbily left him to pay. A
large ornamental fountain was built by public subscription
in 1898 to the memory of Dr. L. T. Hollis. It was made
by Grant and Locke, modellers, and is a duplicate of the
Diamond Jubilee in St. Leonard’s Park, Sydney. It was
opened by James Ashton, M.P., on 22/1/1899.
Just outside the park fence in Auburn Street is the
drinking fountain given to the citizens by the Temperance
Societies in 1886. It is flanked by two stone piers erected
by the council to commemorate the coronation of Edward
YII. The bandstand, not an impressive structure, was
built in 1898, the cost being met, £75 from the Government
and £ls from the surplus of the Citizens’ Diamond Jubilee
celebrations fund. It was opened by James Ashton, M.P.,
on 15/7/1899. A large column commemorates John Knowl-
man, mayor, and was erected in 1910.*

The South African War Memorial, an indifferent piece
of sculpture, was executed in Italy and is of Carrara marble
on a freestone base. It cost £2OO and was erected by public
subscription in 1904. The Meridian Stone was erected in
1915. It gives the latitude of Goulburn as 34° 45 mins.
25° 54 mins. S. and the longitude as 9 hours, 58 mins. 53-27
secs. E. E. Ashley was mayor and W. H. Bond engineer
when it was erected and the astronomical data was supplied
by Thus. H. Rose. A begonia house and other improvements
are planned. The children's playground on the Sloane
Street frontage was refurnished with swings, see-saws, etc.,
in 1941.*
There was a sundial in Belmore Park, formerly at Cap-
tain Hovell’s residence in Verner Street. This disappeared
in recent years. Another sundial which has disappeared
is one erected by Woodward at the Commercial Hotel in
1867. It was a brass dial by Flavelle Brothers of Sydney
and stood on a stone pedestal, f
An English Maple Tree was planted in Belmore Park
on the 6/5/1935, as a memorial of the Silver Jubilee of King
George V.
Victoria Park.
To the west of the city lies a magnificent lung in the
shape of Victoria Park or the Recreation Ground. It pro-
vides a sportsground, cycle track, swimming baths, tennis
courts, hockey ground and cricket pitch, together with a well
laid out park. Features of the park are the rose garden
and the lilac garden. The pavilion was built in 1912 at a
cost of £5OO, the government contributing £250, the turf
wicket was laid down in 1914, and the cycle track in 19224
Greyhound racing is conducted here.
Other Parks.
There are a number of smaller parks, lungs or play-
grounds at various points of the 1 city, none of which will
interest the visitor, but which serve a useful purpose. Of
these Manfred Park, South Goulburn, given by E. C. Man-
fred as a children's park, should prove a valuable asset.
Tully Park and Reynold’s Park serve the northern end of
the City.

In 1940 Alderman A. Goodhew gave to the city 4 acres
of land in Victoria Street where for 40 years he had con-
ducted a seedling nursery. Included in the gift were
thousands of seedlings, shrubs and trees. The land he asked
should be used for a children’s playground and part possibly
for a bowling green. The trees he intended for street plant-
ing and the Sooley afforestation scheme.*
Old Residences..
One of the oldest houses in Goulburn is “Ellesmere” in
Clifford Street, once the home of Dr. Hanford, later of Dr.
Hayley, then of Dr. McKillop, and now of Dr. Gillespie,
* 25/10/1940,


A very old house stands at the corner of Clifford and
Bourke Streets. Built by James Marsden, the Rev. D. P. M.
Hulbert had his school here.
“Ardgowan” in Cowper Street like “St. Clair” was
built by Sinclair. “St. Clair” and “Ardgowan” were the
homes respectively of Bull and Woodward, pioneer store-
keepers of the forties.
The finest private residence in Goulburn was old
“Bishopthorpe” built by Bishop Thomas in 1870. Mrs.
Rossi laid the foundation stone on the 1/1/1870. It was a
large two-storied house consisting of a central block and two
wings, built of blue stone and roofed with shingles and
successively the home of Bishops Thomas, Chalmers and
Barlow. For a while during Bishop Barlow’s episcopate
the Bishopthorpe High School was housed here. Leased
to Fredk. Campbell, the house with the exception of the stone
walls was totally destroyed by fire in 1912. It was sub-
sequently purchased by the Community of the Ascension
and restored by it in 1922 as the House of the Ascension.
Louis R. Williams (Melbourne) was the architect for the
restoration. In particular the old stables were converted
into a beautiful chapel. #
The Church Corporation Office advertised in 1832 its
intention to build a parsonage house at Goulburn. £5OO
was voted for this purpose in 1831. The sum is outstanding
unclaimed in the abstract of revenue and expenditure for
1833, but disappears in 1834. Presumably the parsonage
was begun then although it was not finished in 1838. It
still stands upon the glebe and is now leased to Baxter’s
boot factory. It is the oldest inhabited house in Goulburn. t
“Bishopthorpe,” Cowper Street, the residence of the
Anglican Bishop, is a two-storey building of no architectural
merit. It was built in 1882 for D. J. McLeod, agent of the
A.M.P. Society in Goulburn. The architect was E. C.
Manfred and W. Duncan contractor. The house was pur-
chased as a residence for the Anglican bishop in 1914 by the
diocesan trust out of the fire insurance moneys of Old Bishop-
thorpe.:j:

In 1871 Canon Leigh bought a piece of land to the north-
east of Gonlbnrn behind where is now the railway quarry.
He erected the walls of a stone cottage but never completed
putting on the roof. He also planted an orchard. He
intended making the place his home when he retired. Various
stories are told as to why it was never finished, e.g, its situa-
tion, a defect in the title and/or the lack of a right-of-way
of approach to it. The ruins are commonly known as
“Leigh’s Folly.”
The Reformatory.
The Reformatory can hardly be enumerated amongst
Gonlbnrn’s tourist attractions yet at the same time it is a
matter of interest to visitors. It stands, a huge ugly pile,
to the extreme north of the city. Its story may be read in
the chapter “Public Institutions.”
The Kenmore Hospital.
Unlike the Gaol, the Hospital is a thing of beauty or at
least the gardens and grounds in which it is situated are.
It stands outside the municipality, in Kenmore village. Again
its story is told in full in the chapter “Public Institutions.”
The willows on the Wollondilly at Kenmore have an
interesting origin. Wm. Balcombe, a merchant of St. Helena,
brought with him a cutting from the willow which shaded
Napoleon’s grave at St. Helena. The original tree which
Balcombe planted is said to have flourished at Kenmore until
the beginning of this century.*
EASTGROVE.
There are the remains of an old stone powder-magazine
at East grove, on the hillside above the golf links. This is
the oldest building in Eastgrove and probably dates from
the late forties. It stands at the foot of Rocky Hill, in a
lane just above the brickyards. It is said to have been
built by the co-operative effort of Goulburn storekeepers
who found the storage of gunpowder in town too risky.
According to another account, before that, it is said to have
been a lock-up. This is extremely doubtful.
MUNICIPAL AMENITIES.
In addition to the electrical undertaking, water and
sewerage, which are the subjects of separate sections in this
* “E.P.P.,” 4/2/1915.


history, municipal amenities include baths, saleyards, parks
and sportsgrounds. The municipal revenue from all sources
for 1937 was £IIO,OOO. The annual building costs in the
municipality amount to £120,000.
From time to time the Town Clerk supplies to enquirers
particulars of Goulburn, its situation and potentialities, its
climate and rainfall, and statistics of its progress. The
following are extracts from his memorandum of 1938: —
City area, 8320 acres; population (including environs), 17,500;
Unimproved capital value, £726,530; Improved capital value,
£3,611,765; Assessed annual value, £264,122; Mileage of streets,
86 miles, 661 miles improved, 71 formed, 12 natural surface;
Footpaths, 38 miles paved, 26 miles kerbed and guttered, 14
miles gravelled, 11 miles formed.
The town common, a large area of land lying behind
Rocky Hill, appears to have been of much greater importance
and use years ago than it is to-day. Much time and cor-
respondence of the municipal council in the seventies and
eighties was expended upon this topic, its use, pasturage and
agistment. Part of the common was alienated (Charles’
orchard is on this part), part is still a recreational reserve,
part is a reserve for public purposes and part is occupied by
the rifle range.
The aggregate revenue for the municipality in the year
ended the 31/12/1938 was £100,952/2/11. Adding the ex-
penditure from loans the total was £326,269/0/10. The
total assets were £501,294/0/9. The total of loans outstand-
ing was £326,184/18/3, of which £263,530/0/9 was owing
to the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd.,
instead of to the N.S.W. Government as heretofore.
Goulburn street names were, for the most part, chosen
unimaginatively, and only a few bear upon the city’s history.
The following commemorate early settlers and important
citizens whose biographies may be read in chapter twenty-
seven: Bradley St., Wm. Bradley; Clifford St., James Clif-
ford; Craig St., Robt. Craig; Cole St., probably recalls Jack
Cole, pioneer publican; Faithfull St., Wm. Pitt Faithfull;
Farquhar St., is probably named after Mrs. Farquhar, licen-
see of the “Rose and Crown” and other old-time hotels;
similarly Fenwick St. keeps green the memory of Robt.

CHAPTER 11.
EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY.
THE actual site of Goulburn was discovered in 1820. It
might, however, have been discovered much earlier
than that, for it was seen on the tentative explorations
of the Southern Highlands in 1798, when an ex-convict, John
or James Wilson, made two journeys south and on the
second occasion reached Mount Towrang. # W. A. Mac-
donald, at one time of Goulburn, tells the story thus:
“Wilson, an ex-convict, and two others penetrated the unknown
country southward to the neighbourhood of Mittagong, and then
westward as far as the junction of the Wingecarribee and
Wollondilly Rivers. Owing to the reported discovery of salt
by the party on their first journey, Governor Hunter decided
to send Henry Hacking, a quartermaster of the “Sirius” to
investigate its importance. The party consisted of Hacking,
Wilson, the lad (Barracks) and a man named Collins.”
Barrack or Barracks was a lad, the personal servant
of Governor Hunter. Unlike the boys of his station he
could read and write, so Governor Hunter gave him instruc-
tions ‘Go enter in a paper the observations which their
journey might suggest. ” Barracks carried out his charge
faithfully and day by day wrote up his diary. Governor
Hunter gave this journal to Sir Joseph Banks. It is now
in the Mitchell library “written in a clear hand on double
sheets of foolscap, roughly fastened together with a piece
of red thread.’ ’ Macdonald continues:
“Having reached the reported salt deposits, Hacking decided
to return to Sydney, but Wilson, having plenty of provisions,
decided to continue the journey and in this decision he was
supported by the other two men. This party reached as far
south as within six miles of the present city of Goulburn, and
discovered the Upper Wollondilly at Towrang. The party
ascended a high mountain, now known as Mount Towrang, and
from its summit had a view of a fine open country extending
for a great distance. This was the famous Goulburn Downs
and the neighbourhood of Lake Bathurst, and it was not seen
again by white men until it was discovered twenty years later
by Deputy Surveyor-General Meehan and Hamilton Hume.”
The whole story of the journey can be read in Barracks’
journal. James Jervis gives the reason for these discoveries
not being followed up. He points out that the government
desired no interference with the Cowpasture country. Access

to this area was forbidden by Governor King and such
prohibition remained in force until 1821. Even then the
first settlers on the Southern Highlands had to obtain permits
to cross the Nepean and pass through the Cowpastures.
The hill which answers the description in Barracks’
journal is Mount Towrang.
“Mount Towrang is 2849 feet above sea-level and south of the
main southern road, about 6 miles E. and N. from Goulburn.
The Wollondilly is just under 2 miles straight line north of Mt.
Towrang, while Governor’s Hill is 4 miles west of it. From
the latter scrubby hills extend S. and intercept the view from
Towrang to Goulburn Plains.”
The S.W. view is thus described by Barracks:
“To the S. it runs to an open country at a great distance.”
The southern end of Goulburn Plains, on the eastern
margin of Lake Bathurst, may be clearly seen at a distance
of 20 miles away in a straight line.
“In going from Sydney Mt. Towrang is the first hill met with
this side of the Wollondilly from which any portion of the Goul-
burn Plains can be seen. The plains near Lake Bathurst are
also visible from Mt. Cookbundoon (2973 feet) but before this
mount is reached the Wollondilly must be crossed, and the Jour-
nal clearly shows that the river was discovered from the mount
the party ascended.”*
In 1814 Hamilton Hume began his exploration of the
country south of the Cowpastures. His own account is:
“In the year 1814, accompanied by my brothers, I discovered
. that tract of country now called Argyle. I was also there in
the years 1815 and 1816, and in the year 1817 I accompanied
Throsby to that part of the country. In the year 1818 I again
accompanied Throsby and the late Mr. Meehan. Mr. Meehan
discovered the beautiful lake, now called Lake Bathurst, and
Goulburn Downs.”!
That quotation really settles the controversy as to who
discovered Goulburn. Hume, Meehan and Oxley all share
in the discovery but Hume himself gives credit to Meehan.
Curiously enough all who have written of the discovery of
Goulburn have with extraordinary dogmatism plumped
for their favourite explorer, e.g.:
“The Goulburn district was actually discovered in April 1817,
by Hamilton Hume, who cut his way inland from Jervis Bay,
across the Mittagong Range, and traced the Wollondilly River
to its source.”!
Which is not quite accurate. What really happened
was that Surveyor James Meehan, with Hamilton Hume and
* Cambage. R.A.H.S. A r ol. VI. pp. 30/31
t “Monitor/’ 26/11/1826.
t F. H. Bladen.


four other white men, discovered Lake Bathurst on March
3rd, 1818.
“Meehan then proceeded in a generally north-western direction,
and discovered a chain of ponds (Mulwaree Ponds) and
passed through a country now known as Inveralochy, Spring-
field and Tirranna, and from a small eminence hereabouts he
had a view of what to-day is known as Gundary Plains
although so close to the present site of Goulburn, the party did
not actually reach that place, their nearest approach being in
the neighbourhood of Brisbane Grove, a little to the south of
Thorn’s Bridge.”
All these expeditions were getting nearer to the actual
site of the present Goulburn.
“Although Hume did not actually set his foot on the site of
the present city, he came within a few miles of the centre of
that city to the southward; while Meehan, two years later,, with
Governor Macquarie, crossed the site of Eastgrove, a suburb
of that city.”*
To Governor Macquarie himself must be given some
credit for the discovery of Goulburn. In 1820 Macquarie
decided to inspect the "New Country” and the "great lake”
discovered by Joseph Wild.
The Governor and his party travelled from Liverpool.
Oxley, with Commissioner Bigge, Secretary Scott and others,
was at Bathurst. The two parties arranged to meet (the
confusion of names is unfortunate) at Lake Bathurst (which,
of course, has nothing to do with Bathurst and is nowhere
near it). On October 22nd, the Governor’s party crossed
the Cookbundoon Range, reaching the left bank of the Wol-
londilly. They crossed to the right bank and thence
travelled along that bank to the Kenmore reach. They
camped that night
“just about the junction of the Gundary Creek with the Mul-
waree Ponds, some little distance beyond Lansdowne Bridge,
and on the western side of the Windellama Road travelling from
Goulburn.”!
Oxley, however, two days later, on the 25/10/1820, was
the first white man to pass over the site of the present city
of Goulburn and to that extent may be said to have "dis-
covered” it. The name of "Goulburn Plains” is said to
have been bestowed upon the enormous area of flat country
by Governor Macquarie out of compliment to Henry Goul-
burn, then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, but
there is evidence that Meehan chose it. The county name of
Argyle was selected by Governor Macquarie in remembrance
* Macdonald. R.A.H.S. Vol. XVIII. pp. 159/162.
t Ibid. p. 164.


of his own native county in Scotland. R. H. Cambage has
shown that what Governor Macquarie did was to ratify or
confirm the name of Goulburn and not bestow it, despite
Oxley’s testimony on 25/10/1820:
Murraweree Plains now named by His Excellency Goulburn
Plains.”
The name appears to have been chosen by Meehan.
“The words ‘named by His Excellency’ were interpolated by
Oxley with a slightly darker pencil, so that it looks as if the
Governor had ratified Meehan’s name.”
Macquarie’s own diary would seem to confirm this:
/‘From the junction of the two rivers we resumed our journey
in a south-easterly direction till we reached the north-east
boundary of Goulburn Plains, so named by Mr. Meehan, the
first discoverer, but which, in fact, is a continuation of the great
Mulwarry Plains ”*
The tree, marked by Governor Macquarie, on his for-
ward journey, is now in the Vaucluse House Museum. It is
catalogued as “Governor Macquarie’s Tree from the Cook-
bundoon Ranges, Goulburn District. Presented to the
Australian Museum by C. Cropper, April 1881.” All the
writing that can be deciphered reads ”Macquarie, Governor
04 1820 (“the 04 comes before the 1820 in the markings. ”)
South Hill, now known as Marian Hill, was one of the camp-
ing places of the Hume expeditions of 1821-2.
Goulburn’s early alternative name “Strathallen” was
derived from Andrew Allen’s grant of that name, adjoining
Kenmore. James Kinghorne’s grant was also called
* ‘ Strathallen. ’ ’
Lieut. Joshua John Moore travelled from Sydney to
Greenwich Park in 1821 armed with the following authority:
“To the Constables ! on Duty in the Cowpastures and to all
others concerned:
Mr. Joshua John Moore of Sydney has hereby permission and
authority to pass through the Cowpastures and the county of
Argyle to the country lying to the southward and westward of
the Cookbundoon Range with the undermentioned servants,
stockmen, and cattle, (viz.)
John Osborne, John Tiffin, Government servants to Mr. Moore.
John McHugh, on Ticket-of-Leave.
Richard Tatham, James Clarke, Government servants to Mr.
Moore’s stock-keepers.
One bull, 23 cows, 14 heifers, 20 bullocks, 18 heifer calves, 11
male calves, total 87. Four working bullocks, 3 horses, to
return.

Captain Currie’s "map of the country southward of
Lake George” is in Barron Field’s "Geographical Memoirs
of N.S.W. by various hands” of 1825. It does not show
Goulburn although the Limestone Plains are marked. It
contains Currie’s "Journal of an excursion to the southward
of Lake George” of 1823. Capt. Mark John Currie left
Bong Bong on the 22/5/1823 with Brigade-Major Ovens and
Joseph Wild. On the 23rd they crossed the Cookbundoon
River twice, on the 24th they crossed the Wollondilly and
camped at "Mulwarry” on Goulburn Plains. The next day
they were "at noon in the middle of the Goulburn Plains.”
On the 26th they reached Lake George. By the 31st they
reached "South Fish River” on the edge of Limestone Plains.
They passed up the Murrumbidgee to the edge of the Monaro
returning on the 10th June to Lake George. On the 11th
they passed through "a rotten forest country to the Mul-
warry Creek.” On the 12th they encamped again at Goul-
burn Plains returning to Bong Bong on the 14th. f
P. Cunningham, Surgeon, R.N., writing in 1827, describes
Goulburn Plains as one of "the most noted agricultural or
pastoral spots” in the county of Argyle and "the great
extent of indifferent country around it.” He speaks of the

cattle and sheep when fattened in Argyle County being
driven slowly down, and either disposed of at Sydney, to the
Government, or to butchers, or kept upon some farm in the
vicinity of Sydney and sold off as demand occurs. Goul-
burn is not marked upon his map and he mentions no settle-
ment after Lake Bathurst except “Jackawa.”§
Goulburn Plains were named in 1820. By 1828 it was
realised that the name Goulburn was becoming over-used
and the Colonial Secretary (Alex. McLeay) wrote to the
Surveyor-General (Major Mitchell) on 23/6/1828:
“It is also proposed to call the Town lately named “Goulburn”
on Goulburn Plains by the name of ‘Lorn’ ”
Major Mitchell informed the Colonial Secretary that His
Excellency himself had chosen the name Goulburn and as
Surveyor-General he urged its retention. After some argu-
ment Mitchell won his point. Sir Thomas Mitchell’s efforts
to retain native names were frequently hampered by earlier
choices of this nature. # Dr. Lang wrote some lines in
sympathy:
“I hate you, Goulburn Downs and Goulburn Plains
And Goulburn River, the Goulburn Range
And Mount Goulburn and Goulburn Plains. One’s brains
Are turned with Goulburns! Pitiful this mange
For immortality! Had I the reins
Of Government for a fortnight, I would change
These common place appelatives, and give
The country names that should deserve to live.”t
In the Goulburn Town Hall is a reproduction of H. W.
Pickersgill’s portrait of Henry Goulburn, given by William
Dickson through the Chamber of Commerce to the city. The
original in the Sydney Art Gallery was exhibited at the
Royal Academy of 1832.
Captain Sturt in his ‘ ‘ Two Expeditions into the Interior
of Southern Australia during the years 1828, 1829, 1830 and
1831, etc.,” makes some references to Goulburn and the
district. He describes the district thus:
“To the westward of the Blue Mountains, the country differs
in many respects from that lying between those ranges and the
coast; and, although its aspect varies in different places, three

principal features appear more immediately to characterise it.
These are, first, plains of considerable extent wholly destitute of
timber; secondly, open undulating woodlands; and thirdly, barren
unprofitable tracts. The first almost invariably occur in the
immediate neighbourhood of some river, as the Plains of
Bathurst, which are divided by the Macquarie; Goulburn Plains,
through which the Wallandilly flows; and Yass Plains, which
are watered by a river of the same name. The open forests,
through which the horseman may gallop in perfect safety, seem
to prevail over the whole secondary ranges of granite, and are
generally considered as excellent grazing tracts. Such is the
country in Argyleshire on either side of the Lachlan, where that
river crosses the great southern road near Mr. Hume’s station;
such also are many parts of Goulburn, and the whole extent of
country lying between Underaliga and the Morumbidgee River.”
Sturt’s actual camp at Goulburn in 1828 is described
in some detail:
“The party arrived at Glendarewel, the farm attached to Brown-
low Hill, on the sth. I resumed my journey alone on the Bth.
M’Leay had still some few arrangements to make, so that I
dispensed with his immediate attendance. He overtook me,
however, sooner than I expected, on the banks of the Wallan-
dilly. I had encamped under the bluff end of Cookbundoon,
and, having been disappointed in getting bearings when crossing
the Razor Back, I hoped that I should be enabled to connect a
triangle from the summit of Cookbundoon, or to secure bearings
of some prominent hill to the south. I found the brush, how-
ever, so thick on the top of the mountain, that I could obtain
no satisfactory view, and M’Leay, who accompanied me, agreed
with me in considering that we were but ill repaid for the hot
scramble we had had. Crossing the western extremity of Goul-
burn Plains on the 15th, we encamped on a chain of ponds
behind Doctor Gibson’s residence at Tyranna, and as I had some
arrangements to make with that gentleman, I determined to give
both the men and animals a day’s rest. I availed myself of
Doctor Gibson’s magazines to replace such of my provisions as
I had expended, as I found that I could do so without putting
him to any inconvenience; and I added two of his men to the
party, intending to send them back, in case of necessity, or when
we should have arrived at that point from which it might appear
expedient to forward an account of my progress and ultimate
views, for the Governor’s information.”*

mary of the exploration of the Goulburn district in 1923.1

CHAPTER 111.
EARLY SETTLEMENT.
RADITIONALLY some settlement took place in the
Gonlburn district before it was explored, whilst it
was yet included in the area “beyond the limits of
location. ” Such is not impossible, but difficult to prove or
disprove. It has been said that Mrs. Ann Byrne, mother
of the Byrne family of Spring Valley, was born on the site
of “Riversdale” in the year 1818. Her father, Matt Healey,
kept a public house there in the thirties and her husband
came through the district with Hamilton Hume in the
twenties. She is said subsequently to have declined the
free gift of the city block from the Commercial Bank to the
Town Hall back to Sloane Street.* All of which is very
doubtful, more especially as another account states that she
was born at Parramatta on the 24/2/1819 and that she came
to Gonlburn with her father Matt Healey in 1829. She
died at Spring Valley on the 2/5/1908. f
Mrs. Bessie Morphy of Beechworth, Victoria, relict of
John Stephen Morphy, died at Brighton, Victoria, at the age
of 88, on the 6/9/1908. She was the eldest child of James
Richard Styles of Reevesdale, Bungonia, and claimed to be
“the first white child brought to Gonlburn/ ’ then known
as the “New Country.”:];
Claims to be the first white child born in the Gonlburn
district have been made on behalf of Thomas Taylor born at
Tarlo Bridge on the 1/7/1828, and James Ryan born at
Ryansvale on the 28/3/1835. James, John and Michael
Ryan settled there on a primary grant, Michael was the only
one who married and James was his son. Mary his
daughter was one of the first Australian nuns to be pro-
fessed. Upon the Ryansvale property stands the old (Roman
Catholic) church of St. Michael, built of convict made bricks.
Hardby is a cemetery where all the Ryan family are buried. §
It has been said that there were two houses built in
Gonlburn as early as 1823. One near the old St. Saviour’s
Cemetery and one between that and Mary’s Mount. The

statement has appeared in the local press on several accasions
but should be accepted with caution pending confirmation.
On the other hand it is quite possible. W. Kearns of Lower
Minto held a “ticket of occupation” for 2000 acres variously
known as “Mnlbang” or “Mulbary. ” It is described as
“12 miles east of Breadalbane Plains.” That would be
about the site of the Reformatory. The “ticket of occupa-
tion” expired in 1826. *
At the time of the Goulburn Centenary in 1920 the
Under-Secretary for Lands provided Frank Walker (Fellow
and Past President of the R.A.H.S.) with a memorandum
of the “Establishment of the Town of Goulburn.” This
is a well documented treatise of 12 foolscap pages, compiled
by the late H. Selkirk on the 26/2/1919, illustrated with
maps and plans. The original report is in the Mitchell
Library. This document is the obvious basis of much that
has been published on the early history of Goulburn, whether
acknowledged or not. The research was well done. The
following is a precis, the numbering that of the original
memorandum.
(1) Recommendation that Mr. Walker be furnished with this
memorandum and schedule of original grants.
(2) Original plan of Goulburn had its origin in scheme for
settlement of discharged soldiers from N.S.W. Royal
Veteran Companies.
(3) In 1828 Mr. R. Dixon, assistant surveyor, designed a few
allotments for a “Township of Goulburn Plains,” situated
within a bend of the Wollondilly River immediately above
its confluence with Mulwaree Ponds. Surveyor General
submitted this to Governor, who approved it as “part of the
town” 20/5/1829.
(4) 23/6/1829, Colonial Secretary proposed to call town “Lorn.”
Surveyor-General objected. Objection upheld by Executive
Council.
(5) 18/9/1829, Surveyor General sought Governor’s approval
of allotments at Goulburn Plains “for the immediate pur-
pose of locating several discharged men of the Royal Staff
Corps.” Assistant Surveyor Elliot sent out to mark out
lines.
(6) Elliot effected more extensive subdivision than Dixon.
Governor Darling approved, 1/10/1829, as “Plan of Town-
ship of Goulburn Plains.”
(7) Sir Richard Bourke, June 1832, on the spot took exception
to township site. Selected a new site to S.W. Mr.
Govett, assistant surveyor, prepared locality plan. Streets
and allotments finally marked on ground by Mr. Hoddle

in 1833. Approved by Governor and Executive Council
21/1/1833. Notified as “Town of Goulburn” in Govern-
ment Gazette 27/3/1833.
(8) Both townships now incorporated in City of Goulburn.
“Goulburn Plains” North Goulburn.
(9) Touching construction of first road to Goulburn Plains.
6/3/1818. Surveyor James Meehan’s Field Book records
the discovery by him and Hamilton Hume of Goulburn
Downs. No doubt on this occasion track marked which
ultimately developed into road; cf. reference Sydney Gazette
4/1/1822 to the “Old Government Eoad” and a new route
suggested by a young man named Riley, a resident of
Goulburn Plains.
(10) 18/9/1829, Surveyor General reported: “the great line of
communication leading from Bong Bong to Breadalbane
Plains was practicable already for carriages.” Marked
as far as Barber’s Creek. Beyond that no authority for
route. Major Lockyer, Surveyor of Roads, constructing
portion authorised.
December 1829, Surveyor Elliot instructed to measure both
old and new lines of road to enable Surveyor General to
report to Government.
(11) June 1832. Governor Bourke in Goulburn, promised com-
pletion of road. (Govt. Gazette 27/6/1832).
(12) Nevertheless in 1836 the “New Great Southern Road” con-
structed in piecemeal fashion still incomplete. Sir Thomas
Mitchell reports 14 miles half finished. Progress retarded by
representations of settlers.
Then follows a "list of 47 of the principal old Crown
Grants in the vicinity of the Town of Goulburn ” of which
the following are of chief interest:
“Norwood” was promised to Wm. Lithgow on 2/11/1825 and
granted 20/7/1830. “Rossiville” was granted to F. N. Rossi on
28/1/1826. “Brisbane Grove” promised to John Walker on
12/11/1825 and granted 12/7/1839. “Tirranna” promised to
Dr. Andrew Gibson 26/7/1827 and granted on 9/4/1835.
“Murrhwary” promised to Wm. Bradley 3/5/1825 and granted
8/3/1831. “Lansdowne” promised to Jonas Bradley 3/5/1825
granted 8/3/1831. “Gundary” promised to Thos. Bradley
3/5/1825 and granted 8/3/1831. “Springfield” promised to Wm.
Pitt Faithfull 12/10/1827 and granted 18/2/1837. “Kelburn”
promised to Janet Templeton 11/8/1831 granted 18/10/1839.
“Strathern” promised to H. Howey 21/10/1826 granted 7/7/1835.
“Maxton” promised to Jas. Kinghorne 26/3/1833 granted
16/3/1840. “South Lockleyer” promised to Edmund Lockyer,
Junr. 31/11/1826 granted 6/7/1835. 1200 acres promised to
Rev. Robert Cartwright 22/11/1822, granted to Jas. Chisholm
29/10/1824.
The next sheet of Selkirk’s memorandum is itself a
precis of correspondence in connection with the establish-
ment of the Town of Goulburn. To summarise it still further

The next section of Selkirk’s memorandum is of excep-
tional interest and importance. It gives “the earliest holders
of allotments in the Township of Goulburn Plains.” The
following is an extract.
Occupation of these allotments was permitted by the
Crown on payment of an annual Quit Rent. Finally the
holders were allowed to obtain a Crown Grant on redemption
of the Quit Rent by payment of a lump sum.
The next section of Selkirk’s report consists of a list
of 21 maps and plans of Goulburn in the Lands Office from
1829 to 1847. The quaintest title is in plans numbered G,
948. B. and G. 948. C.:
“Survey of Country between Old and New Townships by
Assistant Surveyor J. Larmer sth October, 1845. ,,
and
“Copy of above by Brindley October 1847.”
The “Veteran Allotments” were surveyed by Assistant
Surveyor Hoddle on 19/6/1833. A precis of correspondence
from 4/1/1822 to 4/10/1830 on the subject of “the New line
of Road to Goulburn” follows. Selkirk quoted some para-
graphs from Surveyor General Mitchell’s “Australia” which
will be referred to later and concluded by quoting Mitchell’s
letter to Govett of 18/6/1832 conveying his instructions for
the survey of a township of Goulburn.
As a matter of fact this was not his first visit. In
September 1828 Wm. Romaine Govett visited “Goulburn
Downs” and notes on his plan the following settlement:
“Wollondilly, Governor’s Hill, John Thorne, James Thorne, Dr.
Gibson. Mulwaree Plains, Bangalore Creek, W. P. Faithfull,
T. M. Fenton, Captain Murray. Bushranger’s Hill, Mac-
pharhan’s Station, Lake Bathurst, Well’s Station, Kenney’s
Station.”
Goulburn had been established about four years when
Surveyor W. R. Govett saw it. His journal makes copious
references to Argyle, Lake George, Lake Bathurst, the
Breadalbane and Goulburn Plains, the aborigines, the forests


and their trees. Some considerable extracts were published
by J. M. Forde in Sydney "Truth.”
James Kinghorne was a Surveyor, who came out with
Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane in 1824. He took up ‘ k Card-
ross” Gonlbnrn, in 1825. Joseph Peters mentioned elsewhere
in this history, was his overseer. In July 1839, he wrote
of "Cardross Grange’ ’ containing 1000 acres with 100 acres
under cultivation and "Maxton” on the opposite side of the
Wollondilly containing 200 acres under cultivation. There
was a post windmill on Cardross. This was in existence in
1834.*
Farquhar Mackenzie’s "Journal” kept intermittently
from 1836 to 1850 is in the Mitchell Library. He was the
son of Captain Kenneth Mackenzie of Kerrisdale, Ross-shire.
With Peter Snodgrass, Dr. Dixon, Murdoch, Kent Hughes
and others he was a pioneer settler in Victoria. In later
years he was Chief Inspector of Stock at Melbourne. He
died in 1874. In December 1836, he undertook his "First
Trip up the Country.” Proceeding to Goulburn via Yass,
Gundaroo and Lake George, he called in at "Mr. Murchi-
son’s” and discovered Murchison was an intimate friend of
his brother Lieut. A. Mackenzie of the 96th Regt. On the
19/12/1836 on his way back to Sydney
“I first went to the farm of a Dr. Gibson at Tirranna to look
at some sheep having to go a great way in search of them
I was detained till sunset and it was quite dark when I got to
Goulburn —and on coming to the Inn I was told that I could not
get quarters. I persisted in gaining admittance, and by mere
chance got a bed after all.”
On the 29th December he notes
“This day Dr. Gibson’s sheep were sold —maiden ewes at 40/-
and old ewes at 32/-.”
In 1837 he took up a run on the "Manero.”
On the 1/10/1837 he
“Went into Goulburn in the evening, got to Mr. Bradley’s about
8 p.m., found Mrs. M. apparently quite recovered —Bradley
from home — Capt. and Mrs. Hovel the father and mother of
Mrs. B. were there.”
After settling in Victoria he returned to Goulburn to
visit the Murchison’s again in 1841.
The diary continues:
“In the year 1841 I went up to Taradale by land. I had a
solitary but pleasant journey, generally sleeping out and getting
* C. Meehan. “E.P.P., ,; 5/7/1933, and Waugh, p. 45.


my meals when I could—in this manner I travelled about 400
miles at a cost of £l. In May I returned here again with Mr.
Murchison and family with whom I have lived ever since.”
Baw Baw, Cardross, Lansdowne, Maxton, Norwood,
Strathallen, Springfield, Tirranna, and a score of other
stations were settled before either the old or new townships
of Goulburn were laid out and built.
The average value of land in New South Wales, accord-
ing to the instructions to the Commissioners of Valuation
and Survey, on 28/3/1831, was 3/- per acre. Goulburn
Plains was included in this valuation.*
In June, 1832, the Governor, Sir Richard Bourke, visited
Goulburn and, on the 18th June, was given an address from
the inhabitants. Its main theme was the necessity for com-
pleting the road from Sydney. They stressed the neglect
of the Government and the remoteness of the markets. The
Governor promised the road should be made, but in 1836 it
was still unfinished. The first road to the south ran through
Bungonia, which at this time was more important than Goul-
burn. The growth of settlement south of Lake George, on
the Yass Plains, and thence to the Victorian border made it
necessary for the road to take its present course. That
first road to Goulburn crossed the Cookbundoon Range after
leaving Jamieson’s station (Greenwich Park). This was in
use from 1819 to 1825. The second avoided the range passing
through Campbell’s run ((Wingello) and Major Lockyer’s
(Lockyersleigh). This was in use until 1833. t
Some idea of the length of the journeys gaily under-
taken in these early days may be gathered from the “John
Hawdon Letters. ’ ’ Hawdon wrote:
“I am going to set out on a journey 600 or 700 miles next Mon-
day, which I had no thought of taking until yesterday. lam
going with Mr. Hassall, the clergyman of this district, and we
purpose going to Bathurst, crossing the Blue Mountains to the
south and returning by Argyle.”
The journey from Bathurst across the Abercrombie and
back to Liverpool through Goulburn was enlivened by Has-
sall’s desire to sell his cattle to Hawdon at £4 per head and
Hawdon’s desire to give £3. History does not relate whether
the parson or the layman won. The journey is also mentioned
by David Waugh in a letter to his sister on the 25/9/1837.
* Hist. Rec. Sr. 1. Vol. XVI., p. 166.
t Frank Walker. “E.P.P.,” 29/2/1916.


Wages current in Goulburn in 1837 are noted by David
Waugh in a letter to his sister Eliza on the 25/9/1837:
“£2O to £3o—everything found them; Mechanics £5O to £6O,
everything found. Captain Rossi gives a carpenter £6O, and
finds everything, that came from Dundee a few months ago.”*
Charles MacAlister wrote of the straits Goulburn settlers
were reduced to during the 1839 drought. He said:
“Valparaiso Flour, I remember, was in considerable demand,
because of its cheapness. This was a compound of bad flour,
ground rice and cornmeal, sent over from South America, as
ship’s ballast Bread was then 4/- the double loaf in Goul-
burn. .. .and 2/6 per loaf in Sydney.”!
Lieut. Gorham, employing convict labour from the Tow-
rang Stockade, made the road over Governor’s Hill in the
early forties and also was responsible for some work on the
streets of Goulburn. He built the first bridge at the back
of old St. Andrew’s church and also the bridge at the south
west boundary of the town. He repaired the roads for Sir
George Gipps’ visit to Goulburn in 18424
W. A. G. Grander in his reminiscences adds:
“Originally the road from Sydney to Goulburn came in at the
south end by way of Bungonia and Gundary. Passing Brad-
ley’s mill it continued around to Clinton Street and thence on to
Yass. In 1853 the new line came into town by way of Towrang
and along Grafton and Sloane Streets.§
Confirmation of the route of the Main Southern Road
is to be found in two large surveys by John W. Deering in
the Lands Office. One is called “Plan of the Main Southern
Road from Goulburn to Marulan 1868,” and shews the Fitz-
roy Bridge and the entrance to Goulburn as along Grafton
and Sloane Streets. The Riggsdale Inn is marked on the
plan. 11
The other plan, a survey of the road from Goulburn to
Gunning is even more elaborate. It shews Grafton Street,
Sloane Street, Clinton Street and Cowper Street metalled as
the “Main Southern Road.” The “Collegdor” Toll gate
is shewn on the eastern boundary of the Bois Chere Estate,
about miles from Goulburn. The “Oliver Goldsmith ”

(J. Futton), “Travellers’ Rest” (John Horton), and the
“Yass and Collector” (P. Cahill), inns are marked.*
Dr. George Bennett, F.L.S., F.R.C.S., wrote of his
“Wanderings in N.S.W., Batavia, Pedir Coast, Singapore
and China” in 1834. His journeys were accomplished from
1832 to 1834. Of his visit to Gonlbnrn he wrote:
“We passed through the township, which at present contains
only a few bark and wooden habitations. The situation for the
township not being originally well chosen, it is the intention of
government to remove it to a more suitable part of the plains.”!
He speaks of the “prettily situated dwelling house and
fare estate of J. Bradley, Esq., called “Lansdowne Park,”
of the “Gonlbnrn Plains” called “Mnlwerry by the abo-
rigines,” of
“Occasional patches of land under cultivation with grain, in-
numerable herds of cattle grazing, and flocks of sheep, attended
by their shepherds, gave animation to the verdant plains, not
yet browned by the parching summer heats.”
He writes of visits to the homesteads of Howey, Rossi
and Moore and of his
“kind reception at “Cardross,” the farm of Mr. Kinghorne.”
Later he visited “Northwood” (Norwood) the “neat
farm of Mr. Francis M’Arthur” and afterwards “Dr. Gib-
son’s farm at Tirranna” near the “Soldiers’ Flat.”
“This latter place consists of several small farms, of about a
hundred acres each, which were granted by government to the
discharged veterans. There were small bark huts erected upon
the grants, and several ripe fields of grain and vegetable gardens
about them.”!
David Waugh served an apprenticeship to a writer to
the Signet in Edinburgh. He migrated to Sydney in 1834
intending to practise law there. “Following the advice of
the first persons in Sydney, embarked upon a country life.”
On 14/8/1834 he wrote to his mother:
“I go for good and all to Mummel, Goulburn Plains, Argyle-
shire In consequence of my utter unacquaintance with
Colonial farming, for experience in other farming is a drawback
rather than an advantage, I could hardly expect anything for
the first year, I am to get £4O, and board and washing.”
The farm was about 6000 acres carrying 4000 sheep and
1500 cattle. Thirty acres were under wheat. He mentions
Mummel House, Capt. Currie’s, Kinghorne’s, Rossi’s,
* R. 862/1603. Lr. 69/3, 15/3/1869.
f pp. 145/6. t p. 323.


Howie’s, and J. J. Moore’s properties. Goulbnrn, he says,
has “a weekly post from Sydney and carriers about a dozen
in number.”
Bradley’s station, he noted, as about a mile from the
township and that he ran about 8/10,000 sheep. In 1836
David Waugh took up Gatton Park, a property adjoining
Mummel. He had about six convict servants and one free
shepherd. He had to make his own candles and rope. He
sold 20 to 30 lbs. of butter in Goulbnrn each week at 1/6
to 1/8 per pound. Of Goulbnrn itself he says:
“There was only one house eighteen months ago, and now
(21/7/1837) I am sure there are 300 inhabitants, and brick
houses rising like mushrooms.”*
By 1833 the settlement had grown sufficiently to be
recognised officially as a township. Plans of such township
were approved and applications from individual purchasers
for town lots were invited. Copies of the plan were made
available at the office of the Surveyor General in Sydney
and with Lachlan Macalister, J.P., of Goulbnrn Plains.
A visitor in 1833 wrote of Goulbnrn.
“A township has been established, a court of justice erected,
and the very spot which but two years before might have been
admired for its solitary natural beauties was soon disgraced by
the gibbet. On a clear rising ground at the back of the present
township of Goulburn a gallows and gibbet were erected in the
year 1832/■ ’
The article went on to shew how in a few years the
natives had been driven back, the kangaroos killed, and all
the best land of the country taken possession of by the white
men.f*
The Veteran allotments surveyed by Hoddle in 1833 can
claim to be amongst the State’s earliest experiments in
soldier settlement. They were situated on the Mulwaree, just
past Thorn’s waterhole, and consisted of a number of small
farms. This was then the most thickly populated part of
the district. Tobacco was grown here in considerable
quantities. Chas. MasAlister tells us something of this little
community. He was there in 1843/4 when a number of the
old soldiers were living in small huts. He mentions some
of their names—Martin Kellick, J. McGeorge, R. Stevenson
* Waugh, pp. 21/3; p. 29; pp. 45/6/7.
t ‘‘Saturday Magazine,” 1836. Quoted “E.P.P.,” 18/7/1899.


and others. The floods of 1843 swept away their little crops
and their portable property. The McGeorge family were
still here in the eighties. He described the half-dozen slab
built bark-roofed humpies which formed the nucleus of the
Old Township of Goulburn in 1833 and “sheltered its two
score citizens. Two years later, Andrew Gibson, of Tir-
ranna, giving evidence before the Select Committee on Police
in 1835, said that the free persons in Goulburn were becom-
ing more numerous, but was not impressed with their quality.
“Almost all the people who obtain their freedom in the district
locate themselves in it as squatters. Although these persons
are without any visible means of support, except a few who
pretend to be dealers in slops and other stores, yet their services
can never be obtained for hire by the neighbouring landowners
or settlers. I have no doubt that more than one half of them
gain a livlihood by bartering spirits for stolen goods and cattle.”!
Chas, MacAlister narrates that tobacco was grown in the
Goulburn district in the thirties and in 1836 1| tons were
grown in the County of Argyle. Chatsbury, Richlands,
Gurrundah and Bungonia grew large quantities of cereals.
Thirty bushels to the acre were grown on the Manion’s
Middle Arm property and 50 bushels of wheat were raised
from one acre at the Gap. On the 31/10/1836 Surveyor
General Mitchell writes:
“I had marked out in 1830 the new road before me which I
had considered the most important in New South Wales, as
leading to the more temperate south. ... This important public
work.... had nevertheless been retarded nearly two years on the
representations of some of the settlers, so that the part most
essential to be opened continues in a half-finished state..
That same year he records:
“Nov. Ist, 1836. I continued my ride through the new Town-
ship in which although but a few years had elapsed since I had
sketched its streets on paper, a number of houses had already
been built.”
He describes:
“My half-formed road which was still inaccessible at this point
for want of a bridge over Towrang Creek.
He continues:
“At 14 miles from Goulburn I came upon that part of my new
line of the great road where the works had not been impeded
by those for whose benefit the road was intended and here I
found the iron-gangs had done some good work. I had now the
satisfaction of travelling along a road whose every turn I had

studied previous to marking it out after a most careful survey
of the whole country.”*
In 1835 Goulburn was valued at £2 per acre. In 1836
the advertisement appears again:
“List of Townships open for sale, and Minimum Prices per
acre. Goulburn ... £2 0 o.”t
The public pound had then been established and the
regulations, rates and fines advertised. James Marsden
was probably the first pound-keeper, about 100 years ago.
The pound was near the western end of what is now Bradley
Street. The following were the Goulburn impounding
charges:
“Rates to be charged for the Trespass of Cattle, and the Sus-
tenance thereof while Impounded, in the several Districts
undermentioned respectively:

In that same “Post Office Directory : ” for 1836 is a long
report “on the Epidemic Catarrh, or Influenza, prevailing
among the sheep of the Colony, by Gordon Bennet, Esquire,
Surgeon.” It extends over 40 pages and relates the mortality
of sheep upon the Goulburn Downs. Captain Rossi (F.N.)
lost 2200. There is a letter, extending over 6 pages, dated
“Goulburn Plains, 25th September, 1835,” from Andrew
Gibson, Esq., J.P., to the Colonial Secretary, upon the same
subject.
In 1836 there was a very wet winter and the roads were
so bad that almost all communication between Goulburn and
Sydney was suspended. There were in all about 150 drays
bogged up to their axles on the Great Southern Road,
“and the men have run up huts at the road-side and there
they remain quite contented till the dry weather comes.”*
Mrs. Steer wrote in 1875 that she came to the Inveralochy
Estate in November 1836, at that time the residence of Walter
Douglas. She stated that Governor Bourke came to Goul-
burn in February or March 1835, and stayed at Dr. Gibson’s
at Tirranna. Her first husband, Duncan Mackellar, bought
and took possession of an allotment in 1835. He was then
camped for two months under a large tree opposite where
the Argyle Inn stands. His house finished, Mrs. Steer joined
him in February 1836. The only buildings she remembered
were the hospital and Dr. Hanley’s store on the site of the
present Commercial Bank.J She remembered the arrival
of McKillop and Leviston, the explorers, from Melbourne,
and their enquiries for Captain Darley at the police barracks
and Captain Rossi. She was many weeks in Goulburn
before she saw another white woman, blacks were her only
visitors.
She remembered the arrival of Sir Thomas Mitchell
“after having surveyed the road from Melbourne to Goul-
burn by way of Bathurst.” Her husband, Mackellar, built
the first (?) slab gaol. “We obtained the first (?) publican’s
license in Goulburn—for the Salutation Inn—in July 1837. ”f

She died at the age of 81 on 11/3/1884, and is buried in
the old Presbyterian cemetery. Her death certificate shews
“50 years ’ residence in the Colony.”!
In an obituary notice of the Hon. James Chisholm,
M.L.C. (19/7/1888), there is a description of Goulburn as
he first saw it:
“He was fond of describing the appearance of the Goulburn
Plains when he first travelled through them. Mr. William
Bradley had already settled in the district, and at that time
occupied the greater portion of the plains as a sheep station.
A solitary shepherd’s hut was the only habitation, where now
stands the flourishing city of Goulburn with its stately cathe-
drals and broad streets.”!
He first occupied Kippilaw in 1837.
Prior to the building of the Fitzroy Bridge all Sydney
traffic passed over an old stone and wood bridge near Kee-
ley’s brickyards, which bridge was built in 1837. Keeley’s
first brickyards were to the south of the present bridge. His
second establishment was in Bishop Street. He died in
1888.*
Some considerable light is shed upon the earliest days
of Goulburn by a work entitled “A Narrative of a Visit to
the Australian Colonies” by James Backhouse, London 1843.
It is the journal of a James Backhouse, who accompanied
by his friend George Washington Walker, visited Australia
from 1832 to 1838. Backhouse and Walker were Quakers
and the journey was undertaken from religious motives.
For the greater part their journeys were made on foot. In
towns they held religious meetings. The country settlers
they visited in their own homes. They ministered too in
the gaols. Here is an extract from their diary:
“10th. mo. 1836”
7th
“We passed a few small huts, forming the village of Towrang,
before reaching Goulburn or Strahallen, at the junction of the
Mulwaree Ponds and Wollondilly River. The old town cf
Goulburn consisted of a courthouse of slabs, covered with bark,
a lock-up house, a few huts occupied by the mounted police and
constables, a cottage of roughly cut timber, and a small inn,
affording tolerable accommodation for such a place, as well as
a better house or two at a short distance.”

All this, of course, is a description of the old township,
occupying* the site of what is now known as North Goulburn,
more particularly in the neighbourhood of the present Graf-
ton Street. However, he described too the beginnings of
the New Township, or the present Goulburn, still on the Bth
October, 1836.
“Bth. A neighbouring settler, and the Police Magistrate called
upon us. From the latter we obtained leave to hold a meeting
in the Court-House; he also accompanied us to the new township,
about a mile distant, where a few scattered buildings of brick,
and others of wood, had been erected Like other places of
this kind, in remote situations, it was pretty fully occupied, by
stock-men and others of the lower order; victims of immorality,
the scourge of this class... ,”t

Of Goulbnrn three years later Chas. MacAlister wrote:
“By the end of 1839 the Goulburn settlement. .. .had grown
into a township of some respectability, for we had a resident
doctor, viz., Dr. Emly... .the new mansions... .of Wm. Bradley
and Francis McArthur were nearly completed... .”*
The freight from Sydney to Goulburn in 1839 was £l4
per ton.
“Its effect may thus be illustrated that, when salt is selling at
Sydney at £4 per ton, its price at Goulburn is £2o.”t
That same year Goulburn was described by Judge Bur-
ton as:
“.... the Station of a Stipendiary Police Magistrate. There
is a Hospital at Goulburn, and an ironed gang employed on the
public roads, in the neighbourhood, at Towrang, containing at
the close of the year 1838, seventy men in irons, and twenty-one
out of irons, under charge of a detachment from one of the
Regiments doing duty in the Colony.”!
There are in the Mitchell Library some few sheets of
the N.S.W. Census for the year 1841 and fortunately the
records are complete for “Goulburn, in the County of

# There were some peculiar features about Governor Gipps’
visit to Goulburn in 1842, A contemporary account stated:
“His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by Lady Gipps,
Captain Parker, and two domestics, reached Goulburn on the
afternoon of Saturday, the 22nd instant. The party having
taken up their quarters the previous night at Arthursleigh, the
estate of H. H. Macarthur, M.C., a good many of the principal
inhabitants of Goulburn rode out on horseback, and met his
Excellency in the direction of Towrang Stockade. The day was,


unfortunately, both cold and stormy, and the Governor, coming
direct from the atmosphere of Sydney, appeared to feel the keen
blast of this elevated situation. The party did not stop in
Goulburn, but proceeded to Rossiville, the residence of Captain
Rossi. The Governor was so unwell on Sunday that his medical
adviser thought proper to recommend his remaining within doors
the whole of that day. His Excellency was, however, in town
at 11 o’clock on the following day. He, accompanied by Lady
Gipps, drove to Mr. Moses’s hotel; and shortly after the Governoi
visited and inspected the new goal; this duty having occupied
him fully three-quarters of an hour, he returned again to the
hotel, where he was met by a number of magistrates and other
gentlemen of the town and district, and an address, which held
been previously prepared and rather numerously and respectably
signed, was presented to the Governor by a deputation, consisting
of the three clergymen resident in Goulburn, and three magis-
trates, to which His Excellency replied in his usual eloquent
manner. This being ended, the Governor held a levee, and very
graciously received all those who were presented to him. Lady
Gipps too, received some ladies of the town and neighbourhood.
The Governor had ordered the previous day a lunch for 8 persons,
and which Mr. Moses no doubt prepared as sumptuously as his
larder and cellars would admit of; and on this day, however, the
lunch was not only partaken of by the members of the deputa-
tion but by nearly the whole of those who had been presen oca
to the Governor and Lady Gipps, comprising about forty ladies
and gentlemen. The gentlemen of the district feel that this
is an expense which the Governor ought not to have incurred;
they did not anticipate anything of the kind; and it was after-
wards proposed to invite His Excellency to a public dinner on
the following day, but as the Governor’s health is not of the
best, and as he intends visit the district of Braidwood, he was
compelled to decline the invitation.”*
The Goulburn correspondent of the “Sydney Morning
Herald ’’ reported in 1843 that “in spite of bad times the
township is increasing in size. Six houses were in course
of erection.”!
W. Baker’s map of the County of Argyle (1843/6) has
three inset plans—Goulburn, Bungonia and Marulan. The
Goulburn plan shows a square township, bounded by Brad-
ley Street on the north, a street unnamed (now Faithfull
Street) on the west, Clinton Street on the south and Sloane
Street on the east. Between Sloane Street and the Mul-
waree is a large reserve for public recreation (now the
railway). The glebe is named but not delineated, whilst on
the opposite side of the Braidwood road to the glebe were
allotments for a church and parsonage. The Eoman Catho-
lic sites were at the corner of Clinton and Faithfull Streets.
A reserve for police purposes was shown where Our Lady

of Morey Convent now is. Belmore Park is shown as a
market, whilst the hospital block was at the corner of Clifford
and Sloane Streets.* .
David MacKenzie, in his “Emigrants ’ Guide” wrote:
“The third and last great road is that which leads from Sydney
to Port Phillip. On all this road, measuring upwards of six
hundred miles, there is little else to be seen but gum trees and
public-houses
In those towns, namely, Liverpool, Campbelltown, Berrima, Goul-
burn and Yass in which post-offices are established there
is a choice of accommodation;
The population of Gonlburn in 1845 was 1200. t
The old township had by this time (1840/46) lost its
grip. The head-quarters of the police had been removed,
and as Matt Healey had also left to start an hotel in Sydney,
the glory of the first settlement had departed, and now the
new town a mile distant, across the plain was springing up
in a position more convenient to the trend of traffic, then
making south. “ There was no such thing as kerbed foot-
paths Gonlburn was simply a little bark-roofed
frontier town, a tablelander’s outpost.
Caroline Chisholm, “the Immigrants ’ Friend” and “the
most remarkable woman associated with Australia during
the first half of the last century” made more than one visit
to Gonlburn between 1839 and 1846. The story of how,
despite apathy and hostility, she took charge of the newly
arrived immigrants until situations were found for them,
must be read in the many appreciations of her work which
have been written such as Eneas Mackenzie’s (1852),
Margaret Swann’s (1914), the “Dictionary of National
Biography,” “Fred Johns’ “Australian Biographical Dic-
tionary” and Eleanor Dark’s article in “The Peaceful
Army” (1938). The latter has two references to activities
of Mrs. Chisholm in Gonlburn.
“. .. .but when one imagines her setting out for Maitland, Yass,
Gundagai, Goulburn and Bathurst, one is amazed at her sheer
physical endurance One finds it almost incredible that she
performed such journeys, not once or twice, but many times.”
Judge Therry in his “Reminiscences” says:
“I remember as though it were yesterday morning meeting
her on the Goulbourn road, as early as 5 o’clock in the morn-
ing Mrs. Chisholm herself, wrapped in a loose cloak, was

seated on the top of a dray, laden with casks and bales of goods,
provisions for a settler at Goulburn. Beside her and around
her were seated twelve or fourteen young girls. Alongside the
dray walked about thirty others. They travelled on the “ride
and walk” plan, the walking girls taking their seats on the dray
in turn after a walk of four or five miles These girls Mrs.
Chisholm was taking to distribute in the interior, where she had
previously procured employment for them in farms whose good
repute she had carefully ascertained.”*
Mrs. Chisholm was in the habit of collecting what she
later called “Voluntary Information from the People of New
South Wales/ ’ One such statement came from Goulburn.
“Ellen W., of London, in statement No. 5, 11th March, 1846,
says: T arrived in 1833; lam married to George W. I wish
to have out my sister Now mind you tell her that her
Sister, Mary Ann, is married well and lives in the Goulburn
district. My brother is doing well. Neither of us have ever
wanted for anything in this country We pay 8/- a week
rent, but it is well we get on. Oh, what a difference there is
between this country and home for poor folks. I know I would
not go back again—l know what England is. Old England is
a fine place for the rich, but the Lord help the poor.”t
Under the heading of “Labour for the Interior” ap-
peared the following:—
“A party of persons out of employment will start for Goulburn
in search of it on Monday next, under the superintendance of
Mrs. Chisholm, who has been supplied with carriage for the
party by the Government, but has to depend upon the public
for rations, to which fact we wish to call the attention of settlers,
who by assisting in this way, will materially benefit the colony,
and be the means of removing the surplus population from
Sydney, where they are perfectly useless, to districts where
their services are really required. ”t
On the 24/10/1844 Caroline Chisholm wrote to the
“Sydney Morning Herald” offering to remove 150 families
from Sydney into the interior (Goulburn and Yass). The
Government paid for their conveyance, the general public
provided rations and Mrs. Chisholm undertook to remain in
the interior until they were all settled and to peruse and
register their agreements.
On the 25/10/1844 she acknowledged by advertisement
receipt of donations of provisions for the journey. The
success of this particular expedition is recorded on the
7/11/1844. All but three families found billets in Goul-

burn. “Mrs. Chisholm is everything” said the “Herald.”
A few days later all the party had found employment, t
The Emigrants Friends’ Society was formed 26/9/1832.
“For the purpose of assisting Free Emigrants, in the humbler
walks of life, with such advice, on their arrival at the colony,
as may facilitate their speedy and comfortable settlement
throughout the Territory.” James Chisholm was the
Treasurer. Caroline Chisholm’s “Home for Female Im-
migration Barracks, Treasurer. Mrs Capt. Chisholm” was
operating in Sydney 18424
Judge Therry says:
“She (i.e. Caroline Chisholm) was the provider of employment
for them, the redressor of their wrongs, the promoter of decent
and comfortable accommodation in their conveyance to the Colony,
and the general agent, by active service, to supply their wants,
and by wholesome counsel to admonish and forewarn them of
the perilous path they had to tread.”§
A writer in the “Sunday Times” indicated the origin
of the Goulburn Immigration Barracks.
“At Campbell Town, Maitland, Liverpool, Cross-Roads, Goul-
burn, Bathurst, Yass, Gundagai, Port Macquarie and many other
places, branch houses were started.... where women waiting
employment or changing places might stop and where they were
sure of being in a respectable home.”*
Caroline Chisholm in her evidence before a committee
of the House of Lords in 1847 described the help she obtained
from her “country committees:”
“Mr. William Bradley, a native of the Colony, authorised me
to draw upon him for money, provisions, horses or anything I
might require.”
This must have been before the establishment of the Im-
migration Barracks at Goulburn, for she goes on:
“The people met my efforts so readily that I had no necessity
to draw upon him for a sixpence. At public inns the females
were sheltered and I was provisioned without charge....”!
The first Immigration Barracks stood in Clifford Street,
and one account states that they were in use in 1841.
Another barracks building was contemplated in 1848. A
barn or stable of this building still stands behind the Pres-
byterian manse in Clifford Street. John Horton wrote that
“at the back” (of the wine gardens in Auburn Street)

“facing Verner Street, was a house known as the “Immigra-
tion Barracks.” No other reference to such a building has
been found. The “old barracks, the immigration depot”
was still standing in 1881. J
Despite careful search the only reference to the use of
the Immigration Barracks is in the reminiscences of H. W.
Goodchild who died in Goulburn at the age of 82 in 1929.
He was brought to Goulburn by his parents at the age of
one year and stated that:
“The family spent the night following their arrival at “The
Barracks” Clifford Street, where arrangements were made to
provide new settlers with temporary shelter.”?
This must have been in 1848.
“Native” (C. Meehan), wrote in 1936:
“Layland's Academy was established in Clifford Street in the
early ’4o's, being converted into the immigration barracks in
1849, when the building was inspected by Sir Charles Fitzroy.”
This is difficult to understand, because although Bayard
was offering the school for sale in 1848 it was bought by
Mrs. John Martyr.
Among the grievances complained of at Goulburn dur-
ing Dr. Nicholson’s representation of it in Parliament (1848/
1856) were the nuisance caused by two soap and candle
factories, the ruinous condition of the gaol, the lack of a
recreation ground and of a Town Common, the inadequate
water supply and the contamination of it by Sloane Street
residents washing in the pools, and by the damage from
the slaughter-house. #
In 1844 Wm. Hunt, Chief Constable, was appointed
“Inspector of Distilleries” for Goulburn.f Unfortunately
the record is silent as to what distilleries there were in
Goulburn. The Goulburn Plains were described in 1848
as “35,000 acres without a single tree.” Goulburn then
contained 1171 inhabitants.; “686 males and 485 females.”
There were 228 houses “of which 124 are built of stone and
brick.” The police district contained 5134 inhabitants in
601 houses, t Governor Fitzroy visited Goulburn in 1849,

staying at Rossiville. He inspected the gaol, the hospital
and the immigration depot. §
Some extraordinary features in connection with Governor
Fitzroy’s visit in 1849 were mentioned by the Goulburn
“Herald.” The Governor was conveyed to “Rossiville”
“by a bye-road, made for the especial purpose through “Nichol-
son’s paddock,” where two panels of the fence were uprooted
under the supervision of an antiquated engineer in order to allow
the cortege to pass along unnoticed and unrecognised by the
people of Goulburn. ...” etc.
who apparently were assembled elsewhere to welcome the
Governor.
The paper then proceeds to denounce
“the ruse de guerre, so peculiar to the Corsicans, as mentioned
by Seneca.”
This was on the Saturday 27/1/1849. On the Sunday
he attended divine worship at old St. Saviour’s and on
the Monday
“without the slightest intimation being given to the s towns-
people” arrived at the Court House for his public welcome.
Great indignation was expressed when Capt. Rossi (F.N. the
elder), a naturalised alien read the address of loyalty. Capt.
Rossi forgot to present any of the “gentry and substantial
traders” to the Governor who looked thoroughly mystified at this
“Corsican etiquette.” The Governor visited the new Court
House, the new Gaol, the new Hospital, the Emigration Depot
and the Mounted Police Barracks and Bradley’s Mill.*
A week later when is was announced that the Governor
might stay at “Rossiville” again the Goulburn “Herald”
suggested that:
“Unless His Excellency is a gentleman possessing the most
insatiable appetite for foreign society, unless he prefers the
vain babbling of a conceited old man, whose days of mental
acuteness have passed away, if indeed such days ever existed,”
etc.
he would stay somewhere else.f
In 1838 the dog nuisance was so bad that the Governor
issued a proclamation extending the Dog Act to Goulburn.
Ten years later the police under Lieut. Patterson, instituted
a “Dog war” and rounded up all the strays and drove them
into the Market Square. There they were shot in a narrow
passage between the gaol and the watch house. One police-
man (Jones) was caught by the nose by one of the mongrels,

and another was bitten “in a vulnerable spot.” Twenty
dogs were destroyed. The public was asked to subscribe
for a ‘ ‘ Solid silver plate ” to be given to the constable return-
ing the largest number of tails, j;
From 1843 to 1850 Goulburn shared in the activities
of the Anti-Transportation League. In 1850 the following
advertisement appeared in the local press:
“Petition to W. P. Faithfull as Warden of the District.
A request to call a public meeting for immediate revocation of
the order of Council authorising the introduction of Convicts
into the Colony of N.S.W,
R. Cartwright
Senior Chaplain.”
(A number of names of citizens follows).
The reply appeared the same day:
“I call a meeting in compliance of the people of the Town and
District at the Royal Hotel 12/9/1850.
W. P. Faithfull. Springfield.§
To the Rev. R. Cartwright and others signing, etc.
The meeting was held and, after a long discussion, a
petition was signed and sent to the Legislative Council.
Amongst those taking part in the anti-transportation agita-
tion in Goulburn and Argyle were Dean Sowerby and Rev.
Robert Cartwright (C.E.), Fr. Brennan and Dean Walsh
(R.C.), the Rev. W. Ross (Pres.), Major Lockyer, Dr. Gib-
son, W. P. Faithfull, C. H. Walsh, John O’Sullivan, A. G.
de Lauret, R. Craig and John Hillas.
James Backler, a German artist visited Goulburn in 1846
and painted portraits of various Goulburn identities and
families. He also painted a landscape of Goulburn with
an imaginary train steaming into the township. # It is not
known where this canvas is.
The old stone terrace of houses in Auburn Street, North,
was built by Lord, the builder of second gaol, in the forties.
In 1847 Lieut. Woore, R.N., then resident at Pomeroy,
volunteered to survey a line of railway from Sydney to Goul-
burn. He spent two years on the task. In 1866 he proposed
a scheme for the supply of water from the Warragamba
River to Sydney and other towns. This was reported upon

by Royal Commission in 1869 but was not recommended.
It provided for the construction of a large dam of unusual
design and an aqueduct to Sydney. The present dam was not
built until 1939 and is not from his design nor location, but
the pipe-line constructed in 1938/40 follows a route some-
what similar to that surveyed when Woore’s plan was under
consideration.
In 1870 he built the flour mill at Pomeroy. He was
then in his seventieth year. He also prepared plans for a
railway to Bathurst. §
The farmers’ agitation of 1848/9 for a revision of the
land laws was taken up with enthusiasm in Goulburn. A
public meeting was held at the Royal Hotel in May, 1849.
The Rev. Wm. Ross presided. Speakers included Dean
Walsh, C. H. Walsh, David Ross, John McAlister and others.
David Ross of “Glen Lea” and Donald McDonald of Middle
Arm were the prime movers in this agitation against the
“Pre-emptive Rights Act of 1847” and other anomalous
legislation and their efforts were crowned with success. #
The pioneering coaching firm on the Great Southern
Road was that of Doyle and Levy, Doyle a Sydney Irishman
and Levy a Berrima Jew. MacAlister tells of a trip in one
of their coaches from Goulburn to Campbelltown in 1838.
He spent 16 days going to and from Sydney, f Jones and
Lupton succeeded them. Their coaches and those of Ireland
and Coy. and Mrs. Richards were on the Great Southern Road
before Cobb and Coy. appeared on the scene.
“It was on New Year’s Day of 1846 that, amidst a scene of
great excitement and cheers, Mr. Jones’ coach arrived in the
evening at the conclusion of a day’s sport at the old township
of Goulburn.... and in opposition to the other two coaches.
Some time previous about the year 1845, Mr. Jones went up to
his station about 300 miles from his home at Bargo and brought
down some 30 to 40 colts to start his line of coaches. Mr. Jones
died before his term expired and Mrs. Jones and the two sons
carried on under great difficulties, running the coaches right
through to Melbourne.”!
The booking office of these first coaches were at Bull
and Woodward’s store, Market Street; Benjamin and Moses’
“Argyle” store; and the Commercial Hotel. Jones’ ad-

vertisement ‘ ‘ Sydney to Goulburn in 29 hours, ’ ’ an hitherto
unheard of luxury, appeared on 19/12/1845.
One of Jones’ advertisements of 1845 reads:
“Mr. Jones begs to inform his friends and the General Public
that owing to the frightful condition of the Liverpool road he
will after the 21st convey passengers to Goulburn by steamer
from Kellick’s wharf to Parramatta. The coach will meet the
steamer, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Coach leaves

In the fifties Mrs. Jones and her sons, still trading as
Jones and Lupton were promised a subsidy of £lO,OOO by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments for the Sydney/Mel-
bourn mail contract. The Victorian quota was not forth-
coming for some years. In the late fifties J. J. Roberts
and W. Crane took over several of Jones and Lupton’s lines.
MacAlister mentions also the Pooleys, Malones, Morans,
Elliotts and Barrys’ struggles on the Southern Roads, and
Ireland’s on the Western, against the competition of Cobb
and Company. Pooley and Malone, e.g., took passengeis
from Goulburn to Cooma for 10/- return.
MacAlister himself, with John Slocombe, undertook a
mail contract in 1868.
When the railway came and Cobb and Company’s
drivers were out of work many of them became guaids on
the railway.
Pettingall, Daley, Perry and Curran were amongst such.*
James William Lewis Thomson said he remembered the
coaching days before the time of Cobb and Coy.:
“I remember it was largely carried on by J. J. Roberts and
Crane They conducted the mails from, as far as I can
recollect, Campbelltown through the Southern districts. Among
the drivers were James Waterworth and Michael Curran. Ine
latter drove Governor Young. John Daley was a driver between
Goulburn and Yass. In those days the tram had reached out
only as far as Picton.”t ?
The “old government watchbox next Mr. Arcen s
bakery” was still in existence in 1881 and was gleefully
recognised by an old resident of 1841 returning after a long
absence.

Moran had the Carriers’ Arms and later the Coach and
Horses, and ran a line of coaches from Goulburn to Cooma,
Queanbeyan, Braidwood, etc., before the advent of Cobb and
Coy. “Joey” Jones of the Royal Hotel had the nm to
Sydney, and Crane and Roberts an opposition run to Camp-
belltown. Cobb and Coy. took them over. Their first
manager, Colin Robinson, met his death as a result of a
coach accident in Sloane Street. James Moran at the age
of 13 was given the horseback mail run to Gundaroo. He
had encounters with Gilbert and Hall, the bushrangers.
The Moran family still has the mail contract between
Goulburn and Taralga. #
James Marsden was keeper of the pound for many years.
He resigned in 1847 when Wm. M’Lean was appointed.
However a month later W. M. Stevenson was signing as
pound-keeper. James Marsden was appointed or reap-
pointed in the room of Wm. McLean Stevenson on the
9/11/1847. There would seem to be some confusion in
these Gazette notices.
William Hilton Hovell was appointed Commissioner of
Crown Lands in Goulburn in 1847. f
Land values had risen by 1847 for the government
offered 14 half acre blocks in Goulburn at £8 per acre 4
The “Educational Return” (extracted from the Census
of 2/3/1846) was published in 1847. It shewed in Goul-
burn :

A visitor in 1851, Lieut. John Henderson of the Ceylon
Rifle Regiment, did not think much of Goulburn. He de-
scribed
“....a few fields... .cleared of timber.... used as paddocks
for horses and cattle, being apparently scarcely worth cultivat-
ing. .. .with the surrounding country I was much disappointed
.... all was interminable and barren bush.”
His description of Goulburn itself is more scathing still
"a small township.... a paltry village, consisting of perhaps
a hundred small cottages, planted in the midst of a gravelly
plain, one of a series of ‘downs’ not far from the River ‘Wallon-
dilly,’ which at this time was merely a chain of water-holes in
the apparent bed of a river.”*
There is an illustration of a slab built, bark-roofed
“Shepherd’s hut near Goulburn” in Samuel Sidney’s “Three
Colonies of Australia” published in 1852.f
In 1853 R. Montgomery Martin describes Goulburn:
“GOULBOURN or MULWARREE, the county town of Argyle,
distance of 120 miles from Sydney, is situated in a fine tract of
country, fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of eight
miles, called Goulbourn Plains, and is in the centre of an exten-
sive pastoral and agricultural district. Dr. Lang deems it,
beyond comparison, the finest town in the interior of New South
Wales, and says that the buildings generally are of a much more
substantial character, as well as of a much finer appearance,
than those of most inland colonial towns. It is a busy and
thriving place, and annually increasing in prosperity; the pro-
posed communication by a railway with Sydney, if carried into
effect, will add to the importance of the place. There is an
extensive flour-mill, with a fourteen horse power steam-engine;
a brewery also carrying a steam-engine; and the inns are stated
to be ‘quite splendid for the interior of a colony.’ The amount
of business done in these establishments is indicated by the fact
that Mr. Bradley, their proprietor, pays £7OO a year for carriage
between Goulbourn and Sydney. The members of the Church
of England, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic persuasions have
each a neat temple devoted to their respective forms of worship.”}
In 1859 a petition for a road from Shoalhaven to Goul-
burn was presented to Parliament^

Sinclair’s Mill, Mr. Lord’s cottage, The Caledonian Inn,
the Old Presbyterian Church, the Royal Hotel (the
middle block only of the existing building), Bradley’s
Mill and Bradley’s Brewery, the Argyle Stores, the Wesleyan
Chapel (a dignified building in the Old Colonial style), the

It shews to the north-west of the old Church of England
Cemetery a large square for public purposes divided by
streets and containing the Mounted Police quarters. “Gover-

the range to the S.E. of the city.
The other plan appears to be a few years later although
still in the ‘ fifties. It shews settlement in Grafton, Mul-
waree and Cole Streets, and a little in Bourke Street and
Auburn Streets to the south. The pictures are most
interesting. They include the first Roman Catholic Church,
the “Medical Hall,” the “Salutation Store,” the “Saluta-
tion Inn,” the “Argyle Inn,” and other buildings adjoining,
the first hospital in Sloane Street, Mandelson’s Hotel, the
old Court House, now the Lands Office, Bull and Woodward’s
store, old St. Saviour’s Church, two rows of “Mr. Sinclair’s
cottages,” Mr. J. Sinclair’s cottage (possibly “St. Clair”),
the “Harp Inn,” and “Thorn’s Mill and Factory.” There
was a police reserve where Our Lady of Mercy College now-
stands.
The S.P.C.K. publication “Australia —a Popular Account
etc.,” published apparently in the late ‘fifties, described
Goulburn as
“a flourishing town, the centre of an important pastoral dis-
trict, which will shortly be brought into communication with the
capital by the extension of the railway in that direction.”*
Wm. Affleck writing of the year 1855 gives the carriage
between Sydney and Goulburn as £2O/10/- per ton. Wheat
was 22/- per bushel in Goulburn, oat hay was £2O per ton
as were potatoes.!
Rents of the bark-roofed humpies in Auburn Street in
the ‘forties and ‘fifties ranged from 2/- to 5/- a week, bread
was 2|d the 21b. loaf, dairy butter was 6d a lb. Shopping

hours were from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Hotels kept open from 6
a.m. to mid-night. Their tariff was 1/- for first-class meals
and the same sum for beds.*
An interesting light on conditions and prices in the
earliest days of settlement in Goulburn is shed by Dr.
Andrew Gibson’s daybook or diary preserved at Tirranna.
It began as a record of assigned servants, their pay and
allowances, and their punishments. In all sorts of odd
corners and margins Dr. Gibson recorded his stock transac-
tions. The book is much mutilated, 27 pages having been
cut out. It is thought that these may have been removed
because they referred to persons who having obtained their
discharge settled in the district. The following would seem
to be free servants or emancipists.
In 1834 Malcolm Livingstone and his wife received £35
per annum with “meat, wheat, tea and sugar.” Their
account is debited with “one bottle of rum 7/-” weekly and
“£lb. of tobacco 1/3” twice in three months.
James Waterhouse was paid 2/6 per rod for fencing
“when idle for want of bullocks to be employed on the farm
at 5/6 per day.” Brown, a “native” carrier was paid in
rum, porter, tea, soap and tobacco.
Surgeon Harnett in 1835 bought his hay from Dr. Gibson.
So did William Simons later landlord of the “Chequers”
but he paid for the hay in Cape wine and three “filly foals.”
In 1833 and 1834 Dr. Gibson records the natural increase
of his horses, cows and sheep. In 1834 he bought his rams
from Major Lockyer of “Lockyersleigh” and “Palmer.”
This must have been George Thomas Palmer of “Palmer-
ville” now known as Ginninderra, Canberra. In 1834 Dr.
Gibson enumerates 869 ewes, 23 rams, 265 wethers and 371
lambs. In 1835 he lists 20 bales of wool. In 1835 he had
1514 sheep. In 1837 on Bangalore he had 80 cattle and
1609 sheep. Thomas Upton (again apparently free) was em-
ployed as a bullock driver on Bangalore at £2O per annum,
meat and wheat, other rations to be paid for according as
Sydney prices vary.
Some savage sentences were inflicted upon the assigned
servants. One Whittaker who came in October 1833 re-
ceived in 1835 “50 lashes for quitting sheep as shepherd”
* S.R. “E.P.P.,” 17/4/1933.


sentenced again “for being out of his hut at night and
insolence” he absconded twice in 1836. He then served
two years in the Liverpool iron gang returning to Tirranna
in 1838. Joseph Smith, sentenced to 7 years, arrived in
1833 received 50 lashes in 1835 for “losing 109 sheep.”
All issues to assigned servants are entered, flannel
drawers, drill trousers, boots, shirts, blankets, “duck frocks”
and of course the inevitable rum. Michael Whalan, a tailor,
sentenced for life, received 50 lashes in 1835 for “refusing
work and rations.” Then he absconded and disappears
from the register. Cleary sentenced to 14 years, received
50 lashes in 1834 for “making away with a keg of rum at
harvest.” Charles Smith, another 14 years sentence, re-
ceived the same penalty for “neglecting the letters.” James
Shaw, who arrived by the “Hercules” in 1832, had his
revenge by drowning Dr. Gibson’s dog, “Norwood,” other
crimes were : “Gross insolence to avoid punishment for which
he absconded.... saying he would give men in the bush
opportunity to shake my store when my swag came up,
going to Mr. Murchison’s with a forged pass bearing my
supposed signature, drawn out by Lucas, insubordination
on the morning 28th Oct.”
Here are some prices from the accounts of 1839:
“Pr. black stockings 2/3 pr., white stockings 1/-, 2
shirts 8/-, 2 prs. boots 14/-, 6 yds. print 4/-, 7J yds. calico
9/1.” Rum had dropped to 6/- per bottle as against 7/-
in previous years.
Eleven bales of wool from Bangalore contained from
242 lbs. of wool to 312 lbs., totalling 2771 lbs. “Greasy
wool from dead sheep” in 1844 comprised 5 bales totalling
2047 lbs., 1 bale of 243 lbs. and 1 bale of 238 lbs. The pro-
ceeds are not shewn. Oaten hay fetched £lO per ton. Six
columns of a closely written account in 1836 concern a con-
tract by Wm. Gibson, Thomas Rock, Rock senior, and Mate
“sawing,” Again the prices are interesting. Rum was
still 7/-, sugar 8d a lb., tea 5/- a lb., 2 lbs. plums 1/6, 12 lbs.
of beef 4/-, soap 8d a lb., tobacco 4/- a lb.
A considerable number of titles in Goulburn are under
the “Old System.” Some of these are most interesting.
Space will not permit of reference to more than one, but,
in passing it may be noted that much of the information in
this history comes from these old documents. A typical


title is that of the “St. Clair’ ’ cottage. James Sinclair,
architect and builder, bought allotment 8 of Section 20 for
£24 in 1843. Four years later he mortgaged the property
to Hy. Gardiner. In the deed he was described as “hath
erected and is now erecting numerous cottages.” In 1849
Hy Gardiner reconveyed it to Jas. Sinclair, including this
time “a substantial dwelling house in which he resides.” On
the 24/12/1851 Jas. Sinclair’s Estate was sequestrated upon
the petition of (? a relative) John Sinclair Murray. Next
there appears on the 30/3/1852 “Conditions of Sale of pro-
perties in Sinclair’s (insolvent) Estate.” On the 31/7/1852
Joseph Bull of Bull and Woodward bought the property
from the Official Assignee for £660, “together with messuage
or tenement erected upon the said land.” Joseph Bull lived
there until the 10/7/1871 when he died. He left the property
to his wife Elizabeth appointing Wm. Davies and Wm. Con-
nolly as Trustees. In July 1871 there was a “disclaimer” by
Davies and Conolly whereupon Elizabeth Bull appointed T.
Bull and M. Perry Trustees. On the 28/7/1876 they con-
veyed the property to Edward J. Ball for £1230. E. J. Ball
died as did E. J. Ball junior, whereupon Bridget Bruton,
wife of J. J. Bruton, bought the property for £6OO on the
9/11/1900. Ruby Egar, her daughter, sold to H. O. Purse-
house on the 14/11/1922, by which family it is still held.*

CHAPTER IV.
THE PENAL PERIOD.
OULBURN in its earliest days, was a garrison town
with a detachment of the regiment on duty in the
colony stationed at Towrang. The main Southern
Road was constructed by an ironed gang which, with its
guards, was for 13 years at least, quartered at Towrang. The
registers of the old St. Saviour’s and Presbyterian Cemeteries
contain many references to the 80th, 31st, and 51st Regiments,
the “Mounted Police” and “Soldiers.” The site of the Tow-
rang stockade can still be traced. It lies between the main
road and the river, near the turn-off to Towrang. One
large stone cell partly excavated out of the rock and partly
built up with solid masonry still stands on the river frontage
of the stockade. This is said to have been the powder
magazine.
A road from the stockade to the Towrang crossing can
still be traced running parallel to the present road. On the
river flat is a small cemetery with three headstones. There
may be more graves. The inscription on one reads:


“Sacred
to the
Memory
of
John Moxey, Private
Soldier 80th Regt.
Who departed this life
November the 16th
1838 aged 38 years
22 years service.
Remember me as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepair for death to follow me.
This stone was errected
by his comrades as a
token of respect towards
A good and deserving soldier.”
It is to be regretted that vandals have defaced the stone
with their initials. MacAlister records that 55 or 56 years
after burial
“The body of one of the deceased soldiers (he had been a cadet
of a ‘noble' house at Home) was exhumed and sent to England
for permanent interment. Through some property of the
ground, the body was found to have become partly mummified,
and the features were intact."* .
One is to the memory of Elizabeth Weiticker, died June
9th 1841 aged 33 years, the other to Mary Brown, died 25th
June 1841 “aged four years and one month.”
The main road runs along a new deviation at this point.
The old road, almost parallel, is carried on three convict
built culverts. The largest over the river itself is a beauti-
ful piece of masonry in excellent preservation, although
portions of the parapet have been removed. The keystone
bears the date 1839. Frank Walker, Past President and
Fellow of the Australian Historical Society, is convinced
that this bridge is the work of David Lennox. He points
out that Lennox built a bridge over Black Bob’s Creek on
the Southern Road and it is more than likely he was respon-
sible for the one at Towrang. “One field officer, 2 rank
and file” of the 4th Regiment were stationed at “Goulburn
Plains” in 1834.f James Backhouse on his visit to Goulburn
in 1836 records his impressions of the Stockade. His refer-
ence to the officer-in-charge reading the Anglican service
refers to the period when Towrang was in the parish of
Sutton Forest and the Rev. John Vincent could only manage
quarterly visits.
* pp. 64/5. t Aust. Almanac 1834.


MacAlister tells us more of the stockade. He writes:
“From 1833 to 1846.... The Towrang Stockade... .was the
chief Penal establishment in the Southern District. During
that period there were hardly ever less than two hundred and
fifty prisoners at Towrang. ... The first Head Officer.... was
Lieutenant Darley, who was succeeded in 1836 by Lieutenant
Waddy.... The Towrang convicts were, by regulation, classified
into two parties: the “light sentence” (or seven years’ men)
being engaged on the lighter tasks. .. .while the iron-gangs (com-
prising the fourteen years’ men and the lifers) were hard at it,
packing and rolling (i.e. building) different sections of the main
Southern road between Marulan and Goulburn.... The prisoners
wore a yellow and black uniform. The convicts at Towrang
slept on the bare boards with a blanket apiece; ten men being
locked up in each box or cell.”*
He goes on to tell some ghastly stories of the triangles
and mentions two of the floggers by name
“Billy O’Rourke (the Towrang flogger) and Black Francis (a
negro), the Goulburn castigator from 1838/41.”
Black Francis was murdered near “ Run-of-water ’ ’ by
some ticket of leave men he had reported.
Backhouse says:
“10th Mo. 1836.
“7th.
“We visited an ironed-gang at Marulan. The prisoners have
lately been supplied with Bibles and tracts, by order of the
Bishop of Australia. The Episcopal service is read to them on
Feast days, by the officer-in-charge.
Prisoners who are not of good character, are assigned into
service, in places remote from Sydney, in order that they may
be separated more completely from their old associates. The
Marulan gang consists of such as have committed offences after
such assignment.”!
Judge Burton, writing a few years later, but covering
almost the same years says:
“There is... .an iron gang employed on the public roads in the
neighbourhood, at Towrang, containing at the close of the year
1838 seventy men. in irons, and twenty-one out of irons under
charge of a detachment from one of the regiments doing duty
in the colony. .. . Rev. Mr. Sowerby. .. .on the afternoon of the
second and fourth Sundays of every month officiates at Tow-
rang.” t
MacAlister gives some shocking examples of “ justice ”
at the Goulburn triangles, e.g., 25 or 50 lashes for having a
smoke, or speaking to a passing traveller. Chas. Preston
for neglect of duty in watching the stockade working
bullocks, 50 lashes. Absconding from iron-gang, 100 lashes,
* MacAlister, pp. 62/3.
t Backhouse, pp. 438/9.
t Burton, p. 231.


“50 on the 10th inst., the remainder after expiration of two
days. ” Capt. Rossi (senr.) and Stewart, the P.M. gave a
man 25 lashes once for feigning illness. He was ill and
died.*
The Regiments serving in New South Wales from 1833
to 1846 were:
50th (West Kent), 1833/41; 21st (Royal North British Fusi-
liers), 1833/39; 28th (North Gloucestershire), 1835/42; 80th
(Staffordshire Volunteers), 1837/44; 51st (2nd Yorkshire West
Riding Light Infantry), 1838/46; 96th, 1841/48; 99th (Lanark-
shire), 1842/56; 48th (Rutlandshire), 1844/47; 11th (North
Devonshire), 1845/57; 65th (2nd Yorkshire North Riding),
1846/49;
of which the 28th mainly garrisoned the Stockade.
The following are the particulars of the officers mentioned
by MacAlister :
Darley, Capt. J. 17th Regiment of Foot. Stationed in 1836 at
Goulburn in charge of 2nd Division of Mounted Police. Waddy,
Ensign Richard, 50th Regiment of Foot. Stationed at Berrima
in 1835/6, in 1837/9 with Mounted Police, Goulburn. In 1841
he was at Sydney. Christie, Lieut. S.F., Mounted Police, was
attached to the 80th Regiment of Foot. In 1839 he was at
Bathurst. He is listed in 1840, 1841 and 1842 simply as
Mounted Police, without mention of district. In 1843/4 he was
at Goulburn.
Excluding the officers seconded to the Mounted Police
and whose duties embraced some connection with the Stock-
ade the complete list of officers in charge of the Towrang
Stockade would seem to be as follows:
1839 Lieut. R. Sherberras, 80th Regiment. 1841 Capt. W.
Houghton Tyssen of the 80th, Assistant Engineer and Superin-
tendent of Ironed Gangs. 1842 Lieut. W. Cookson, 80th, Assistant
Engineer and Superintendent of Ironed Gangs. 1843 Lieut.
Owen Gorman, 80th, Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of
Ironed Gangs.!
The actual date of the relinquishment of the Towrang
Stockade is difficult to ascertain, but it does not appear in
the Almanacs of 1844. Presumably its demolition began
soon after 1843. Probably the greater part of the material
has been used on the roads and culverts in the vicinity.
In quite recent years part of the coping of the bridge has
been destroyed by vandals or used by road contractors.
That date for the relinquishment of the Stockade is suggested
by a document in the Lands Office, Goulburn. It is a
“Copy of the descriptive remarks concerning the thirteen por-
tions of land at “Tourang” inserted by Mr. Larmer on his
* MacAlister, pp. 62/3, 70.
f Yeggs’ Almanac, etc.


descriptions thereof dated 6th October, 1843, accompanying plan
of same date,”
and the plan is attached. His valuations were £4 per acre.
The site of the Towrang Stockade was then described as :
“2 acres 3 roods 10 perches. This allotment includes a small
cottage, 8 old huts, 4 boxes and a shed and is well situate for an
Inn, the buildings worth £6O and allot. £4 per ac.”
Another 2 acres adjoining:
“includes eight old huts, water is abundant, the land is rocky
and barren, the huts are worth £l6 and the allot. £3 per ac.,”
whilst
another 2 acres 2 roods:
“includes a small military garden once occupied by the mili-
tary.”*
The first Goulburn Court house and the first and second
lock-up were naturally at the old Township. The first lock-up
was built in 1830. MacAlister has left a description of it:
“At the time of our arrival the existing landmarks had nothing
of urban beauty or grandeur about them. They were simply
a small shingled gaol or lock-up of four cells (built in 1830):
a little rough-hewn courthouse, where the chief magistrates of
the time, viz., Dr. Gibson (of Tirranna), Lachlan MacAlister
(of Straithaird), and later old Captain Rossi; Mr. Stewart (of
Stewards, now GrunselFs gardens), and Mr. Allman, sat in
stern judgment... .nearby were the bark-roofed quarters of the
officers and the humpies of the Mounted Police.” t
This was still in use in 1836, although by that time the
New Township was growing. Of the type of justice meted
out here the case of White and Mooney will serve as an
example. White and Mooney were convicted in Goulburn
of the murder of Roach of Clifford’s Creek in 1830. They
were hanged and their bones were still bleaching on the
gibbet in 1833, when Governor Bourke, on his visit to Goul-
burn ordered their removal.^
In 1876 when some excavations were being made at the
top of Bradley Street the remains of these men, still in the
gibbet-irons, were uncovered by James Cuzner and W. Webb.
A fence between H. C. Manfred’s house and Dr. Aileen
Mitchell’s has one panel with its posts 12 feet apart instead
of the usual 9 ft. and this extra width is said to have been
due to their desire to avoid disturbing the bodies. Another
account says that the bones were re-interred in old St.
Saviour’s Cemetery.§

Rosevear Smith, “Artist,” offered photographs of the
chains, “one of the Gibbet chains with skeleton enclosed”
at 2/6 d each. R. Smitts, photographer, also advertised
photos of the “Men hanged in chains, (the greatest curiosity
of the age).” They were also on sale at the office of the
“Penny Post.”f
The first brick gaol in the New Township was built by
Sinclair in 1845. The triangles were in the courtyard.
MacAlister tells of how “farm constables” were appointed
to the stations round about Goulburn employing a number
of convicts and of how a travelling magistrate, attended by
a policeman and a flogger, visited the stations.
“once a month, and on the complaint of the master or overseer,
the men were generally awarded so many lashes—never less than
twenty-five from the cat-o’-nine-tails, according to the magis-
trate’s idea of the enormity of the offence.”
Not that all the large landowners acquiesced in the sys-
tem. MacAlister records:
“That in our time at Strathaird no bloody holocaust was offered
up to the brutal law, as my father sternly objected to flogging
men on any account.”!
Colin McLaurin, overseer to Sir Chas. Cowper at Chats-
bury in the early thirties is said to have refused to flog
convicts or assigned servants, to have written to the Gover-
nor on the subject and to have received a sympathetic reply
The letter was lost in a fire many years ago. In May 1840,
an Order in Council was passed by the Imperial Government
which ended the despatch of convicts to N.S.W. whilst still
permitting them to be sent to Van Diemen’s Land, and
Norfolk Island. By 1841 the population of N.S.W. was
130,000 of whom 105,000 were free and 25,000 bond. In
Groulburn the figures were 605 free and 105 bond.§
From time to time suggestions have been made for the
resumption and preservation as historical monuments of the
remnants of the Stockade, the military cemetery and the
bridge at Towrang. Nothing has been done and soon it
will be too late.

CHAPTER V.
DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS.
HIS chapter will endeavour to cover important or
unusual events in the development and progress of
Goulburn from the fifties of last century to the present
day. It will overlap with the chapters devoted to municipal
government, commercial and cultural development, the
churches, schools and public institutions. In a measure it
will provide the outline into which the succeeding chapters
may be fitted in their turn. It will include the impressions
made by Goulburn upon visitors and writers over ninety
years.
Dr. Lang described Goulburn in 1847 as
“beyond all comparison the finest in the Southern interior of
New South Wales, and the buildings generally are of much more
substantial character, as well of a much finer appearance, than
of most inland colonial towns.”*
He went on to say:
“It is a busy bustling place for its size. ... There is an exten-
sive steam flour mill, with an engine of 14 horse-power, and a
brewery on a large scale, also carrying a steam engine, in the
immediate neighbourhood of Goulburn—both the property of T.
Bradley, Esq., a native of the colony and lately member of the
Legislative Council for the County of Argyle.”t
The Fitzroy Bridge in the Old Township was opened in
1854 by Mr. Beazley, second clerk in the Colonial Treasurer's
Department. It cost £3OOO and was then regarded as one
of the biggest undertakings of its kind. The Oddfellows
“with their usual true public spirit" had a gathering there
and “gave a degree of eclat to the affair which it would
not otherwise have had." Woodward of the Commercial
Hotel “had a temporary licensed booth" and “gave a first-
class lunch." The German band played popular airs.
Writing of the late forties of last century J. T. Walker,
saddler of Verner Street, recalled the first Guy Fawkes made
in Goulburn. He said:
“O’Sullivan, the banker, came out and took poor old Guy
Fawkes out of the chair and broke it over our heads.”!
W. A. G. Brander, then in his 92nd year, published in
1935 his recollections of Goulburn in 1853:
“Goulburn... .was... .a straggle town. The early settlers
acquired the principal corner blocks.... at the corner of Clinton
* 11 Phillipslasnd/ ’ p. 240.
t “Phillipsland/' p. 241.
t Gbn. “Herald,” 20/12/1854.


and Auburn Streets was the Bank of Australia and on the
opposite corner the Chequers 1nn.... ,,
He mentioned Mandelson’s Hotel, the Commercial Bank
on the corner of Sloane Street, and John O’Sullivan’s and
Captain Hovell’s residences and
“....in Auburn Street the Union Bank....rows of wooden
cottages and rotting fences.”
He spoke of Moss Marks’ “Argyle Stores” and on the
opposite corner in Verner Street “The Horse and Jockey
Inn” and adjoining it the “Herald Office.” On the corner
now occupied by the Commercial Bank was “a tailor named
Sibley. ’ ’
The earlier cottages in Goulburn (i.e., in the fifties)
were built
“Right up in the alignment, without verandahs or shutters.
You stepped off the street into your best room.”
in 1853
“Lighting was provided by evil-smelling oil lamps and by
candles mostly tallow. Matches were scarcely ever seen. Flint
and tinder box supplied the means of lighting up.”
W. A. G. Brander in those same reminiscences of 1853
furnished a fashion note:
“Women wore their hair under caps, with many frills. The
young women stuffed their hair into knots. Men wore their
hair long, reaching to the shoulder. Coats had two breast
pieces, each of a different colour. Trousers were very tight
at the knees and very broad over the boot. Hats were of
cabbage-tree straw, tilted over the right ear, and were kept
in place by a strap under the nose.*
Prices in 1854 were described as follows:
“Stores are cheap, flour about £6/10/- to £7 a bag. Tea and
sugar very reasonable and as for slops they can be bought as
cheap in Goulburn.”
The increasing importance of Goulburn and its rising
values are shewn in a sale of Town allotments on March
24th, 1854. The lands were sold under “An Act for regulat-
ing the sale of Waste Land belonging to the Crown in the
Australian Colonies.” They were all J acre blocks, in Cow-
per, Addison and Mundy Streets. The upset price was £8
an acre. Nevertheless John Byrnes gave £45 for one allot-
ment. Emmanuel gave £52 for a corner site. The remainder
fetched from £32 to £45. f
The “Australian Picture Pleasure Book” was compiled
by Walter G. Mason and published in 1857. In it there

are pictures of the first “Fitz Roy Bridge near Goulburn,’ ’
“Razor Back, a portion of the road to Goulburn/ ’ “Opening
of the New Fitzroy Bridge, Goulburn, 1854/’ “Encampment
of Drays at Bargo River on the Goulburn Road,” “Sheep
Washing at a Station near Goulburn, ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Sheep Shearing
at a Station near Goulburn.” The picture of the opening
of the first Fitzroy Bridge is most interesting. It was a
high trestle bridge with an open balustrading. Four flags
are flying from the bridge. In the foreground are five
tents and ten isolated groups of people, including two
military officers and one civilian on horseback in the immed-
iate foreground. The original crossing of the Sydney Road
over the Mulwaree is shown. It was of logs laid upon dwarf
stone walls immediately to the south of the present bridge.
There is an excellent picture of the Abercrombie Cave
and a “View of the Mummell Estate near Goulburn.”*
Controversy has raged as to who first introduced the
rabbit to Australia. There is no doubt as to who first
brought its twin curse, corrugated iron, to Goulburn. R. E.
Conolly of the “Argyle Steam Mills,” was reported to have
had “his new house roofed with corrugated iron at less cost
(not much) than shingles.” This was the first experiment
with this material in Goulburn. f
In 1856 what was erroneously described as the “First
Census” was taken. A notice was affixed to the door of the
police court advising the public that from the Ist Mlarch
all house-holders must give full information as required by
the Act of Council 19th Viet. No. 5. The “Herald” stated
that there was great local indignation that such acts were
not published in the local journals “as not one in a thousand
persons ever visited the police station.” The indignation
would appear to have been confined to the “Herald” Office.t
A paragraph in 1856 headed “Approach to Goulburn”
stated that “Mr. Hawkins and his band of workers” merited
great praise for the “new road round Big HilF on the
Sydney road. John Liggins was the contractor for “cer-
tain works near Big Hill” on the Southern Road in 1860.§

A meteorological station or observatory was founded
at Goulburn by the Rev. Wm. Scott the astronomer in
September 1857. This was at the old hospital and the
Superintendent of the hospital was placed in charge. Scott
was the first Director of the Sydney Observatory and Govern-
ment Astronomer of N.S.W. from 1856 to 1862. After
that he was warden of St. Paul’s College in the University
of Sydney and rector of Gunning, Queanbeyan and Bungen-
dore.f
An advertisement in 1860 gave particulars of transport
between Sydney and Goulburn:
“The Fox Express
Will start from Webster’s ‘Salutation Inn’ from Goulburn every
Monday to Sydney. Passengers and light freight. On their
passage being arranged for by Mr. Webster, no extra charge
to fetch from on board ship and bring up to Goulburn, relations
and friends of Goulburn residents who may be arriving in the
Colony and thus avoid expensive trip to Sydney. Fares 35/-
each passenger. Luggage over 81bs. and under 251bs. 3d.
each.”!
The “Magaethon” traction engine reached Goulburn
after a six months’ journey from Sydney in January 1861.
The bad state of the roads owing to heavy and continuous
rains, are said to have caused the delay. B. H. Palmer was
the owner. To this account W. A. G. Brander adds that
“the town celebrated. Blackshaw provided a barrel of beer
and success to “better luck next time” was drunk in bumpers.”§
Sir John Young “and suite” visited Goulburn in 1865,
“the first time the Governor has visited the Southern dis-
tricts. ”j|
The Department of Public Works called for tenders for
a bridge on the Braidwood road in 1869. **
Goulburn’s progress was retarded for many years by
the fact that the land immediately surrounding the city
proper was held by four landowners, one of whom, Wm.
Bradley “refused to dispose of an inch.” It was not until
after his death that the first subdivision took place, that of
West Goulburn.* When the first time ball was erected in
Goulburn is not known. It was renewed in 1864. A new

time ball was fixed to the Telegraph office in 1872. The
cost was defrayed by subscription and the work completed
by Capt. Hoy ell and Mr. Dalgarno.f The “Wandering Re-
porter” of the “Sydney Morning Herald” visited Goulburn
in 1865. He observed that it had wide streets but that
there was a doubt as to when the footway ceases and the
roadway begins. “The drainage arrangements,” he said,
“were primitive.” He described Goulburn as a “flourishing
and well-built town” and said it “gives an idea of civiliza-
tion uncommon in this far distant region. Wm. Lees wrote
some reminiscences in 1934. He too remembered Auburn
Street in 1865 when there were no footpaths and bullock
waggons bogged at the side of the macadam strip. There
was no sanitation. A butcher, O’Donnell, had a slaughter-
yard in Auburn Street at the corner of Goldsmith Street.
Later an attempt was made at kerbing. It took the form
of wooden pegs and tarred planks.§
A visitor to Goulburn in 1871 wrote:
“It has been built upon the old primaeval Botany Bay principle
and has its gaol and courthouse in the centre of the city. At
one time these were considered to be an immense acquisition
to an inland town, giving it that status and importance which
would be wanting without. But as the town grows older and
rises into real importance they become ashamed of what once
was their pride and agitate as strongly for the removal of the
quondam ornament as years back they did for its establishment
among them/’
Apparently Belmore Park was still an open square, for
the writer went on to say:
“In that year, 1871, something was done in Goulburn in that
way for the improvement of the square given over to the Muni-
cipal Council, who fenced it in with a nice painted fence and
levelled it off so as to give promise of a very pleasant recreation
ground at some future day.”
That English visitor commented on the social side too:
“I saw the bullock drivers and sawyers there. These men
interested me, besides there were every shape and type of bush
character, from the shepherd with all his worldly goods comprised
of a quart and pintpot and sugar bag and blanket, to that
aristocrat, the bush squatter. There were men with awful high
hats. These have the predominance to men with ridiculous low
hats, men in boots, men in riding pants, men in tweed, men in
moleskin, men with coats on whom from their appearance of
discomfort coats had not been worn for at least 12 months, and

men accustomed to go with bare throats, with heavy black silk
handkerchiefs around their necks looking as pleasant as if the
silk had been twisted.”*
Lord and Lady Belmore, prior to sailing for Europe in
1871, visted Goulburn as the guests of Bishop and Mrs.
Thomas. They were met by Captain Rossi and the Volun-
teers “in uniform.”f Under the heading “Scarcity of
Horse-Hair’ ’ the “Penny Post” records that various people,
P. Munoz and R. Craig, e.g. have suffered loss in that their
horses’ manes and tails had been brutally hacked off by
“Some evilly-disposed” person.s
The English Magazine “The Sunday at Home.” published
in 1872 a long article “A Sunday in Goulburn in 1868.”
Naturally the writer was mainly concerned with religious
matters and he paints an interesting picture of inter-
denominational co-operation. He speaks of “Lady preachers”
in certain churches. Unfortunately the article was marred
by extraordinary inaccuracies, such as the statement that
the Baroness Burdett Coutts had given £15,000 for the en-
dowment of the Anglican Bishopric and £lO,OOO for the
clergy, facts which were contradicted at the time. The
article has been republished or quoted frequently. §
The bridge at Marsden’s Crossing was in course of erec-
tion in 1874. A codfish, 121bs. in weight was caught in the
Wollondilly, just below Grunsell’s garden in 1874. ||
References to tolls are very few. On 10/2/1875 John
Moore summoned Albert S. Davis for charging him 2d. on
a Sunday at the 4 mile toll on the Tirranna Road, on the
ground that “he was on his way to chappie.” Advertise-
ments appeared in 1875, signed by H. B. Watts, Secretary
Roads Association, Bradley Street, Goulburn, inviting sig-
natures to a petition for the abolition of tolls.**
A leading article in the “Goulburn Herald” in 1876
suggested that Goulburn should become the Simla of N.S.W.:
“During the intercolonial exhibitions the ruddy and English-
like complexions of the Goulburn folk and particularly of the
children are much remarked upon; and scarcely any better
recommendation of our climate can be imagined.”

The goat nuisance was so bad that year that the P.M.
called a meeting of the magistrates to ascertain if the mini-
mum fine of 10/- could be increased to £1. #
A page of illustrations of Goulburn’s business premises
appeared in the “Illustrated Sydney News’ ’ in 1877. The
premises pictured were the A.J.S. Bank, Davis Alexander
and Coy., and A. M. Hunt and Coy. (all still standing in
1940), and the premises of the Commercial Bank, S. B. Burge,
Wm. Southall, Wm. Stewart and Sons, Finlay and Coy.,
and T. W. Jacob, which have disappeared or have been
altered out of all recognition. West Goulburn was then
known as “Newtown.”
Larrikinism is the subject of many letters, paragraphs
and leaders in the newspapers of 1876. It was complained
that in old St. Saviour’s and later in the temporary church
gentlemen’s coat-tails were pinned to the seats in church and
ladies’ ribbons were either pinned or cut.f
Goulburn has not many claims to ghosts. One, in 1878,
is said to have appeared “in the range above Stewart’s
garden, where there is an unfinished house” (? Leigh’s
Folly). It used to appear early in the evening and flit
about until three o’clock in the morning. Grunsell claimed
to have disposed of it with a shot gun. Another mysterious
appearance which was seen in the late afternoon and on one
occasion was photographed was that of a ghostly apparition
which manifested itself in the Bishop’s Throne in St.
Saviour’s Cathedral.s
The first pile of the bridge over the Mulwaree at Lans-
downe was driven on the 16/4/1878. §
The petty larceny known nowadays as “snow-dropping”
is not new. Under the heading of “Stripping clothes lines”
the “Penny Post” in 1878 stated that Goulburn was “in-
fested” with one or more individuals who “went prowling
about the town at night seeking who (or what) they might
devour.” Three such cases were reported in one issue.
A meeting was held on 26/8/1878 “to induce the Muni-
cipal Council to cut away the Verner Street Hill.” Some

extraordinary suggestions were made including one that
33 feet should be cut out of the middle of the street, leaving
two 33 feet strips on either side to approach the existing
premises. 11
The bridge over the Wollondilly at Rossi’s crossing was
opened for traffic on 15/9/1878 by Mr. Wood, assistant
engineer for roads. A large amount of public money was
expended in Goulburn at this time, chiefly through the
endeavours of its member, W. M. Teece, M.L.A., e.g. the
appropriation act for 1879 provided for the following items
of expenditure: Hospital fever ward £IOOO, “dead-house”
£6OO, annual grant £3O; £75 for the Mechanics’ Institute; £2OO
for the recreation ground; £IOO for Belmore Square; £13,000
for public buildings; £6500 for a telegraph line from Crook-
well to Goulburn; £SOOO for a bridge at the old Township;
Wombeyan Caves £300; Municipal subsidy £ISOO, and water
supply £30,000. #
That year the immigration agent for the Colony asked
the Bench of Magistrates what immigrants could be absorbed
by Goulburn. The magistrates reported against any such
being sent to Goulburn on account of the “want of a re-
ceiving house or temporary depot.... for immigrants who
come to Goulburn often without a shilling in their
pockets, t
Tree planting in the streets at that time was financed
by contributions from the citizens. Dr. Lanigan, e.g. gave
10/6 for 33 trees to be planted in Verner Street. Wm.
Davies was sent a case of 25/30 English skylarks by the
Zoological Society. As he was laid up at the time, having
had three fingers amputated by a planing machine, Aider-
man Caldwell liberated the birds at three different points
of the city. A few months later 20 English starlings, im-
ported by the Acclimatization Society, were sent to the Mayor
and were released by him at his house in Clifford Street. The
report concluded “and are now to be seen about the trees
in the garden.” The mayor was Alderman Davies.^

this picture and the artist making* it in the Goulburn papers.
The picture, which would seem to be more faithful to facts
than some which appeared about that time, shows Auburn
Street entirely unformed south of the bridge.
A tramway to Crookwell was mooted in 1880. When
members for Argyle and Goulburn reported that the Govern-
ment was contemplating building an iron bridge at the old
Township, the Goulburn “Herald” remarked:
“It is to be hoped the structure will be made sufficiently wide
to carry steam motors, as already a tramway to Crookwell is
beginning to be spoken of.”
The Government invited tenders for a “dead-house” in
1880. Later this was described as a “ morgue. ” #
George Milner Stephen, a faith healer, visited Goulburn
in 1881. The local press was sceptical yet recorded the
names and addresses of a number of cures. A warm con-
troversy between him and the Rev. G. M. D’Arey Irvine
took place without definite result. The press gave credit
to the healer “for firm faith and honest intention.”)
Bonney and Coy. Sydney, published a large map of Goul-
burn in 1883. It is surrounded by advertisements. The
advertisers’ premises are specially marked upon the map.
The Oriental Building is shewn opposite the Royal Hotel.
The Post Office and Court House sites are vacant. The old
gaol was still standing. The hospital was still in Sloane
Street. Rogers store was a two-storey building, where
R. D. Gray and Sons are now, but without the present facade.
Davies’ Australian stores were illustrated.
Goulburn experienced a land boom in the early eighties,
so much so that a leading article in the Goulburn “Herald”
said:
“If one sees two or three citizens gathered together in earnest
conversation it will be easy to divine the leading topic of dis-
cussion: Allotments,” “frontages” and “£3 per foot,” are frag-
ments of the talk which strike the ear.”
Its own advertising columns confirm this. Six auc-
tioneers were advertising subdivisional sales. Even the
Lansdowne Estate was cut up into villa sites. A week
later Finlay and Coy. were offering 33 allotments in Coro-
mandel Street, etc., 24 in North Goulburn and 2 in Verner

Street. Sands and Belcher were offering 70 allotments near
the saleyards, 3 in Grafton Street and 5 in Mundy and Paith-
fnll Streets. J. J. Roberts had the Hillside Estate cut np
into 90 allotments. Five hundred allotments were offered
at Eastgrove, a special train being run for Sydney buyers.
East Goulburn, or Eastgrove, has had many names. 0.
Meehan quotes “Skinner's Alley’ ’ and “the Brick fields.”*
At the Town Hall, the Diocesan Museum and elsewhere
in the city there are large “bird’s-eye” views of Goulburn
dated 1882. The Goulburn of to-day is recognisable but
with great differences. In Auburn Street, Rogers’ store
had not been built. The site of the Technical School was
a paddock, and all Verner Street beyond the Technical
School was a paddock and all Clinton Street beyond the
Bourke Street intersection. SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral
and the presbytery had not been built and Auburn Street
from the Bradley Street intersection consisted of a few
humpies only. The secondary industries, however, were more
then than they are now. In Clinton Street the mill chim-
neys of Cox and Worrall, Joseph Hayes, and Wm. Conolly
were landmarks; as was Gillespie’s on the corner of Auburn
and Goldsmith Streets. Many of the two-storied residences
can be recognised, such as “Euthella,” Cooyal,” E. C. Man-
fred’s, “Hillside,” etc. A. M. Hunt’s baking powder and
jam factory, and other business premises can be recognised,
despite their recent modernisation. The “Australian Arms”
in Clinton Street had paddocks on both sides, whilst the
railway boasted the station and two small sheds only. The
Presbyterian church, manse and school in Sloane Street, had
a vacant paddock to the south and a few small residences
to the north. The premises in Auburn Street then occupied
by W. T. Woods’ piano and boot shop, a delicious combina-
tion, can still be recognised. The three-storied gaol,
surrounded by a 20ft. fence still stood behind the post office
and the present Lands office, then the court house, stood in
detached dignity behind. Only a few stray cottages appear
in Bourke Street beyond the Goldsmith Street intersection.
Kennedy’s Argyle Brewery was almost the only building
in Faithfull Street. Deccan Street had two houses. The
plan was published by Gibbs, Shallard and Coy., chromo-

lithographers, Sydney, as a supplement to the “Illustrated
Sydney News” of 30/9/1882. These bird’s-eye views were
astonishingly accurate. They were drawn by a Mr. Richard-
son who spent some considerable time in Goulburn making
the necessary preliminary sketches.!
The Goulburn District Directory for 1882/3 has two
title pages, one “published by Wm. Bishop of Goulburn/ ’
the other by “Lee and Ross, 53 Market Street, Sydney.’ ’
The 1882 publication was its “First Year of Publication.”
There were then 3 flour mills, 2 boot factories, 1 brewery,
2 jam factories, 2 fell-mongers, and 1 foundry. Hotels
had been reduced to 27. There were 5 banks: the Bank
of New South Wales, the Commercial of Sydney, the Aus-
tralian Joint Stock, the English, Scottish and Australian,
and the Oriental.
An agitation for a tramway to Taralga occupied a good
deal of space in the newspapers of 1882. Several advertise-
ments appeared relating to the formation of a company to
construct a tramway from Goulburn to Gundary.* A. C. Bar-
rett, an alderman, was the moving spirit behind a proposal
for a steam tramway between Goulburn and Kenmore. He
was responsible too for much of the earlier planting of
trees in the streets.
The Fitzroy Bridge was re-erected in 1883/4 at a cost
of £8326/5/-. §
Eastgrove, which occasionally before this was spelt
“East Grove,” was advertised freely, in this year, by D. J.
McLeod, an estate agent, as “The New Suburb.”
A dispute between the Municipal Council and the Gas
Coy., about the lighting of the post office clock resulted in
the company cutting off the gas. Some of the Goulburn
papers at this time were full of jokes at the expense of the
clock, which must have been erratic.
Under the heading of weather, the “Herald” reported
“the Town clock stopped, of course with the first heavy
burst of wind.” The Wollondilly Bridge was completed
in 1883. G. H. Royce and Coy., of London and Sydney were

sketchily illustrated in John Sands’ “New Atlas of Aus-
tralia” issued in 1886. The population is given as 5880.
The New South Wales section says of Goulburn:
"Its prosperity is largely due to the fertility of the country
which surrounds it, but much of its importance arises from its
position as a depot on the Great Southern Railway line.”
That wheat was then more important than wool is re-
called in the following paragraph :
“Wheat growing is carried on very extensively. Among its
remaining vegetable products are maize, barley, oats and
potatoes. A considerable area is devoted to sheep-farming and
grazing. Fruit trees including the peach and the vine, grow
rapidly.”
The town is described briefly:
“It is well laid out, has broad streets and possesses a number
of very fine buildings. Manufacturing industries of various kinds
add to the prosperity of the town.”
The picture accompanying this letterpress would appear
to be much older than 1884 or 1886. It was apparently
taken from the tower of old St. Saviour’s, although the
artist depicts the ivy as growing inside the tower. The
artist was D. Turner.
Sir Henry Parkes lectured in the Mechanics’ Institute
on “Life Glimpses of Great Men and Noble Women,” on
19/6/1885. Proceeds were for the building fund. Sir
Henry spoke of his contacts with Daniel O’Connell, Thomas
Carlyle, John Bright, Alfred Tennyson, W. E. Gladstone,
Florence Nightingale, the Crown Prince of Germany, and
others. G. A. Sala gave two lectures in Goulburn on the
13th and 14th July, 1885. His subjects were: “Russia, what
she is like and what she means,” and “Shows and Pageants
and Eminent Persons I have met and known.”*
A tragedy which shocked Goulburn occurred in 1887
when Henry Steele, the District Court bailiff, aged 27, was
drowned whilst crossing the Wollondilly. His wife and
children were on their way out from England to join him
here. The buggy sank in a hole and the driver was
drowned. The horse struggled free and returned, leading
to the discovery of the accident. The body was not found
for some days.f

Another “Bird's-eye view of Goulburn” was published
by the “Illustrated Sydney News” that year. There are
copies at the Town Hall and elsewhere in the City.
Lord Carrington visited Goulburn in 1887. He was
given an address from the Municipal Council, another from
the Freemasons, another by the A. P. and H. Society at
the Show, which he opened. He laid the foundation stone
of the “South Goulburn Presbyterian Church Hall.” The
Governor visited the gaol, the hospital and the Mechanics ’
Institute.*
Henry George visited Goulburn on 20/3/1890, was given
a banquet and delivered an address. He received an
illuminated address from the local branch of the Single Tax
League. Wirth’s Circus visited Goulburn for the first time
in 1889.f
Complaints of the goat nuisance and of damage to
gardens and of their consumption of shrubs and plants in
the cemetery were common in 1889. The police tackled
the problem in 1891, rounding up and destroying 24 in North
Goulburn alone, ij:
An article on Goulburn, extending over 5J pages, with
the pictures, appeared in the “Illustrated Sydney News” for
1890. Referring to the amenities offered by the city it
said:
“Socially, this pleasant city is a delightful spot to visit; there
appears to be a constant round of parties, and the local mag-
nates of either sex seem always ready to greet the wanderer,
whilst the fair daughters of the county of Argyle are charming
in manner, handsome and fresh in appearance, and intelligent in
conversation —a distinguished lady Bachelor of Science being
one of their number.”
A further five pages with 10 illustrations appeared a
fortnight later.
Electricity was still a mystery in the nineties. An
advertisement which appeared several times read:
“Wanted — a skilled person to repair electric bells. Liberal
payment for effective treatment.”^
The phonograph was first exhibited in Goulburn in
1890. The audience was asked to speak into the instrument.
A record was made which was played immediately. Canon

D’Arcy Irvine improved the occasion. When his voice was
reproduced it enquired of the audience “What think you
now, gentlemen, of Balaam’s Ass?” #
In 1891 G. T. Steadman compiled and W. S. Foxall
published the “Goulburn Weather Almanack and Business
Guide,” and in 1892 a very similar “Southern District
Weather Almanac, Business Guide and Local Electoral
Directory.”
In 1891 there were 2050 houses in the municipality and
the numbers of electors on the roll 2360. The capital value
of the rateable property was £972,221. The municipal in-
come was £8434. Those local calendars of 40 years ago
contained many things not now counted of importance by
the general public as, e.g.: “Jan. 1. The Mayor and Auditors
enter on duties,” and “Jan. 1/31. The City Auditors examine
accounts.”
The Governor, the Earl of Jersey, was tendered a ban-
quet when he visited Goulburn in 1891. Gallery seats for
spectators were sold at 2/6 each. The “Penny Post” im-
proved the occasion as usual:
“We wonder what he’ll think of us who choose to give him treat
And then at half-a-crown a nob sell cards to see him eat.”t
Typewriters made their appearance in Goulburn in the
early nineties. The Goulburn “Herald” wondered what to
call the operators and suggested “type-writists.” It “sup-
posed the resultant verb must be to type-write.” H. M.
Stanley, the explorer, lectured in Goulburn on December
11th, 18914
The wave of financial failures begins to occupy increas-
ing space in the Goulburn newspapers from 1891 to 1894.
At first only speculative ventures and Building Societies
went under. The Australian Banking Company was noticed
next. The Bank had a branch in Goulburn. The Relief
Society had £127 there and the Municipal Council a deposit
of £2500.
The Municipality was banking with the E.S. and A. Bank
and the Australian Banking Company for there are many
references in the minutes to the reconstruction of both. The
Mayor and treasurer were authorised to make temporary

arrangements with “one of the banks’ ’ for the payment of
wages and current expenses. The Mayor was authorised
to attend any meeting of the depositors of the Australian
Banking Coy. and to take such action as might seem desir-
able in the interests of the Council. The bank was wound
up finally in 1914 when the municipality wrote off its de-
posits as bad debts. # In 1893 the press recorded a long
succession of Building Societies and Banks suspending pay-
ment. The “Penny Post” rather heartlessly wrote:
“Our bank’s gone bung to-day,
Our bank’s gone bung to-day,
Our notes we flash,
We can’t get cash,
Our bank’s gone bung to-day.’’
Knowlman Bros, with a faith in the future advertised
that they would accept “A.J.S. Bank notes” in any quan-
tity. f
Ferguson’s “patent safety boat and barge” plied for
hire on the Mulwarree from Lansdowne Bridge to the head

One unexpected result of the 1893 depression was that
the revenue of the C.P.S. Office (mainly fines for drunken-
ness) declined by over £IOOO for the year.§
There was a big falling off in advertisements in all the
Goulburn papers from 1891 to 1895. Advertisements appeared
-offering to buy “at full prices” Bank Deposit receipts of
the Commercial of Sydney, A.J.S., and E.S. and A.C. Banks.
Amongst local bankruptcies and liquidations were J and J.
Hayes Ltd., flourmillers; R. T. Ball and Coy., and Wm. Gale.
The first lady cyclist ever seen in Goulburn appeared
in Auburn Street on the 28/7/1894. She attracted con-
siderable attention although wearing ordinary dress.
The first penny-in-the-slot weighing machine was instal-
led in Goulburn at the post office in 1894. Michael Davitt,
M.P., the Irish patriot, visited Goulburn in 1895. He was

syndicate purchased and placed on the Wollondilly a steam
launch capable of carrying 40/50 passengers. The first

Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897 was observed
with a gigantic children’s picnic. There were nearly 3000
children in the procession. The procession included three
local bands and was led by the Mayor (Aid. Richardson) on
horseback. The Royal Hotel, Oddfellows’ Hall, the White
Horse Hotel, and the Emu Inn were illuminated. The pic-
nic funds showed a surplus which a public meeting allocated
towards a.bandstand in Belmore Park.*
The first steps in the matter of urging Goulburn’s claims
to be considered as the Federal Capital were taken in 1897
when a “Convention Invitation Committee” was formed.
A public meeting was held on 13/2/1899 to petition the
government to provide a tramway in Goulburn. A week
later “the largest public meeting ever held in the city” was
held (20/2/1899) to advance the claims of Goulburn as the
Federal City. Considerable attention was given to these
claims of Goulburn to be considered as the site of the
Federal Capital. The evidence for and against the proposal
can be read in the “Report of the Commissioner on Sites
for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth” (1900)
who said:
“The site selected for the Federal Capital lies just outside, and
to the south of, the City of Goulburn.”
The site was inspected on the 27/10/1899 and the
26/2/1900, and the public enquiry was held on the 7th and
Bth May, 1900. The Commission reported in favour of Yass
rather than Goulburn. Goulburn was unduly optimistic about
its prospects of adoption as the Federal City. The Mel-
bourne “Argus” satirically supported the Goulburn claims.
The “N.S.W. Railways Scenic Album” which bears no
date of publication but which obviously was issued in the
late nineties has a view of Goulburn which is labelled “Part
of Proposed Capital Site, shewing Bird’s Eye View of Goul-
burn, looking north-east from Slocombe’s Hill.” Another
view shows the Mulwaree, looking south-east, from South
Hill. A meeting was held to take steps to urge the claims

of the Lockyersleigh Estate as the site for the Federal Capi-
tal. (Lockyersleigh, near Barber’s Creek and Carrick
Bridge). A. Oliver, the commissioner, inspected the site.
The Towrang Federal Site Association was functioning
in 1900. This site also was inspected by A. Oliver. §
An X-ray apparatus with an “eight inch spark” was
purchased for Gonlbnrn by public subscription for £36. E.
C. Bryden was the chief mover in the matter and A. J.
Sach at the Technical School took charge of it. L. Hopkins
(“Hop” of the “Bulletin”) gave two lectures in Gonlbnrn
in 1900, for the Presbyterian Church. Clement Wragge
lectured twice on astronomical and meteorological subjects,
also for the Presbyterian Church. “No true scientist,” he
said, “can be an atheist.” Governor Lord Beauchamp
visited Goulburn in 1900 mainly for Anglican functions. He
was given an address from the municipality and the
M.U.1.0.0.F. Australian Federation was celebrated by a
banquet at which the principal speakers were the Governor,
Lord Beauchamp, Sir Wm. Lyne, G. H. Reid, and Edmund
Barton.*'
A shocking and unexplained murder took place in Goul-
burn on 8/5/1901. The victim was an old German second-
hand tool dealer, called Schnoor, who had a little shop in
Clifford Street. One morning he did not show up. Upon
the police breaking in, he was found dead, having been
murdered with a pick. Nothing ever was discovered to
explain the crime, f
When old age pensions 0 were first granted, local boards
were appointed who heard all applications for pensions in
an open enquiry. There were about 100 applications in
Goulburn of which 60 were heard by the ‘ ‘ Goulburn Old Age
Pensions Board” on 28/6/1901. The names and circum-
stances of the applicants were all published in the news-
papers. Later the number grew to 3004
In 1901 two commercial travellers, Knowsley and Kirby,
made the trip from Goulburn to Braidwood by motor car,
52 miles, in 2 hours 52 minutes. In 1901 the Goulburn
Federal Capital League forwarded to Sir Wm. Lyne photo-

suggestion that the Federal Parliament should be housed
there as soon as possible.**
Gonlburn nearly had its tramway. In June 1902
“An officer of the Tramway Department arrived in Gonlburn
to make enquiries concerning the proposal to provide an electric
tram for the city.”
Nothing came of this proposal. Later a private com-
pany proposed to build a tramway and actually surveyed
the route.
“However the idea must have been abandoned for the company
never placed its proposals before the alderman.”*
The peace at the conclusion of the South African war
was celebrated on the 3/6/1902 with a procession and
demonstration in Belmore Park. The demonstration “lacked
the wild outburst of feeling manifested on the relief of
Maf eking. ”f
The Hon. E. W. O’Sullivan, Minister for Works and
the Hon. J. Perry, Minister for Public Instruction visited
Gonlburn on the 8/3/1902. O’Sullivan opened the new
Lansdowne Bridge and Perry the Technical College. There
was a military carnival on the show ground in the afternoon
and a public dinner at night. Petitions were presented
asking for additional technical classes, a railway line to
Kingsdale and a tramway from Gonlburn to Kenmore. A
deputation upon the Half-holiday question was also re-
ceived.;!:
The Gonlburn to Crookwell Railway was opened by the
Hon. J. Perry. It was a gala ’day in Crookwell but little
interest was shewn in it by the people of Gonlburn. §
The first move in the matter of a deviation of the main
southern road to avoid the grade of Governor’s Hill was
made in 1903. Thirty years were to elapse before any action
was taken.
Dr. Birmingham claimed to have been the first Gonlburn
resident to own a motor car. It was a “Star.” This was
about 1905. In 1906 when the provisions of the Factory
Acts were extended to Gonlburn there were 650 people in
Gonlburn employed in factories. ||

The Governor, Sir Harry Rawson, Lady Rawson and
Miss Rawson visited Goulburn in 1903. The Governor laid
the foundation stone of the South African War Memorial,
attended Anglican and Masonic functions and visited the
schools and other institutions. Five months later he was
back for various Masonic functions. Bishop Barlow’s car-
riage was requisitioned for the Governor’s transport, four
horses being harnessed to it. Sir Harry Rawson visited
Goulburn for the third time on the 24/10/1906, primarily
to open the Anglican “All Nations Fair.” To the civic
welcome “Citizens (Gentlemen only)” were invited.
The Governor, as Grand Master, was present at the
Masonic Ball. At the showground he was given the golden
lyre of the Liedertafel and the golden harp of the Musical
and Operatic Society. He returned again the following
year when he laid the foundation stone of St. John’s Church,
Kenmore, and also attended the hospital ball. #
Paul Twyford returned to Goulburn in 1906 after an
absence of 37 years and wrote his impressions. He was in
Goulburn for the opening of the railway in 1869. His
considered opinion was that the city had not improved. He
objected to the wooden kerbing in the streets and the
higgledy-piggledy shops, the lack of trees and the general
ugliness, t
The Governor-General, Lord Northcote, visited Goulburn
on 10th and 11th May, 1907. His programme included
visits to the schools, hospital, public buildings, the races, an
opera, public and masonic receptions, and a public luncheon
and trips to Kippilaw and Springfield. $
Two and a half columns were devoted in the local press
in 1908 to a balloon ascent and a parachute descent in Goul-
burn by O’Donnell and Beebe’s company. This was er-
roneously described as the first balloon ascent in Goulburn.
There were balloon ascents here in the forties and the sixties.
When Bishop Barlow brought a motor car back with
him from England in 1908 the papers devoted considerable
space to the enterprise. He was the first Australian Bishop
to use a car.
As late as 1908 the Department of Labour and Industry

reported that in Goulburn it was “the usual practice for the
young girls in shops every Saturday to put in a 12 to 13
hours’ shift and no extra pay.” Inspector Armitage drew
attention to a Goulburn brickyard in which two girls worked
in the clay-pits, digging and trucking. **
An Industrial Exhibition and Eisteddfod, featuring es-
pecially Goulburn manufactures was held in the Arcade
building from the 19/5/1909 to the 29/9/1909. It was
opened by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Andrew Fisher.
The exhibition was “the outcome of efforts by the Journal
of Manufactures.”*
The Governor, Lord Chelmsford, visited Goulburn on
the 29th and 30th September, 1909. There was a mayoral re-
ception in the Court House. The Governor laid, masonically,
the foundation stone of the spire of St. Saviour’s Cathedral,
a project which, unfortunately, was dropped soon afterwards.
He presided at the diocesan festival.!
In the days when the night soil system was in vogue
it was the custom of the sanitary men, a few days before
Christmas, to leave upon their rounds a pathetic little verse,
describing their labours when all was wrapt in slumber and
soliciting a Christmas Box which they thoughtfully suggested
should be left upon the scene of their labours. People
responded generously. Unfortunately one year enterprising
persons made a round of the city prior to the visit of the
sanitary squad who failed to find their recognition in its
usual place.j:
In 1911 C. Percy Holloway exhibited a harem skirt in
his shop window. He failed to find a living model but,
although it was exhibited on a dummy the crowd was so
great that three policemen were employed in protecting the
windows. §
An Industrial Fair and Exhibition was held in 1911 by
the Anglican authorities for the Spire fund of the Cathedral.
Takings amounted to £I2BO, expenses £6OO, profit £6BO.
Again, unfortunately, the building of the spire was not
advanced.il

e The Governor, Lord Chelmsford, visited Goulburn on the
28/2/1912, chiefly to open the Victoria Park carnival. A
shocking tragedy occurred in 1913 when on the sth Novem-
ber, a young girl, Mona West, daughter of G. W. West,
disappeared in Sydney. She was never found.
The Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, visited Goulburn
on the 24th and 25th April, 1914. He received an address,

buildings and institutions. #
The Governor-General, Sir Ronald Cranford Munro
Ferguson, visited Goulburn on the 13/4/1916, mainly for
the purpose of inspecting the A.I.F. Camp.f
The Wheat Board stored very large quantities of bagged
wheat in Goulburn during 1917/18. It came from the mice-
ridden areas and it was thought that by bringing it to
Goulburn it could be reconditioned and preserved as a State
asset; 100,000 sleepers were used, 10 trucks of ashes per day
and 70 men were employed. Later when the wheat was
cleaned here 250 men were employed. In 1918 a plague of
“mill lice’" ensued, some being found in Auburn Street and
others as far out as seven miles from Goulburn. $
The War Loan Tank, accompanied by the Lord Mayor
of Sydney and other speakers visited Goulburn in 1918.
The “Greater Goulburn Movement” was launched this
year and made a valiant attempt at advertising the city.
It had a brief effect in stimulating investment in local pro-
perty and the erection of new homes. Its larger aims of
attracting factories and secondary industries were not
realised. The Greater Goulburn Movement of 1918 pro-
duced a Boost picture which included a panoramic view
of the city, views of the railway yards, station, saleyards,
cathedrals, churches, a hill-climbing motor test on Rocky
Hill, the Kenmore Hospital and Wombeyan Caves. §
Governor Sir Walter Davidson and Lady Davidson
visited Goulburn on 5/6/1919. The Governor laid the
foundation stone of the new operating theatre at the hos-
pital, and witnessed a screening of the “Boost” Goulburn

25 minutes.**
The centenary of the discovery of Goulburn was cele-
brated in October, 1920. Sir Walter Davidson, Governor
of N.S.W., was present. An historical procession included
many descendants of the original settlers, Miss Faithfull,
Mrs. Ernest Johnson, Miss Poidevin, Miss Alison Kelso, Miss
Throsby and others. Fifteen old identities whose combined
ages totalled 1265 years were presented to the Governor. The
celebrations included illuminations and a pageant.
Thorn’s Bridge was rebuilt by the Department of Public
Works in 1920 at a cost of £5075. J. J. McPhillips was the
contractor.*
The “Sydney Daily Mail” published in 1922 a hectic
article on gambling in Goulburn, describing “Hazard schools
operating day and night.” A meeting of citizens was held
in the Town Hall on the 11/1/1922 to protest against this
“Wanton insult.”!
Goulburn made photographic history in 1922 when at
the Court House a cinematograph 14mm. film was exhibited
in the witness box, and judge, jury and witnesses viewed on
a screen an animated picture taken at the time of the ac-
cident. The “British Journal of Photography” stated that
this established Goulburn’s priority in the use of motion
pictures in the witness box.
The Governor, Sir Walter Davidson, and Dame Margaret
Davidson again visited Goulburn on the 25/3/1922. The
Governor opened the Presbyterian Ladies’ College and the
Soldiers’ Club 4
The Superintendent of Aerodromes reported in 1921
that he had selected two sites for an aerodrome but that the
owners would not lease. The machines of the Sydney-Ade-
laide aerial service would, therefore not call at Goulburn. §

Shire and £625 by the Government. The American Fleet
visited Australia in 1925. The Sydney Committee asked
Goulburn to entertain 50 officers and men; 5000 people as-
sembled, with bands to greet them. A civic reception was
arranged, a dinner and a dance. Only two guests, both
officers, turned up. There was great local indignation.^
The Anglicans conducted a missionary exhibition in the
Arcadia Skating Rink in 1925. This was one of the largest
undertakings ever staged in Goulburn. Attendances dur-
ing the three days numbered over 8000. Sir Dudley de
Chair visited Goulburn again on 15/12/1925, this time to
open the War Memorial on Rocky Hill. The Governor-

a mayoral luncheon and a citizens’ dinner.||
The construction of the Gonlbnrn Aerodrome was under-
taken by the Gonlbnrn Aero Club when aviation was more
of a sport than a means of transport. Eventually the Comp-
troller of Civil Aviation, Department of Defence, took it
over, installing a guiding beacon and lighting for night
landing. Jean Batten was given a reception at the aero-
drome npon her flight to Gonlbnrn on the 15/6/1934.

and the Municipal Council took place in 1935. The Depart-
ment wanted “rear-in” parking; the Council “nose-in.”
At long last the Police Department gave way provided the
garden plots in Auburn Street were removed. This was
done. Gonlbnrn’s own method of angle-parking remained
and all was peace.J

CHAPTER VI.
BUSHRANGERS.
HERE were two distinct eras of bushranging in
N.S.W. The first bushrangers in the early days of
settlement were convicts who had absconded from
justice or from assigned service. Gangs of these bushrangers
infested the Southern Highlands. With the abolition of
transportation and the extension of settlement, the convict
type of bushranger disappeared. In the late fifties and in
the sixties of last century another type of bushranger arose,
attracted by the gold despatched to Sydney upon the lonely
bush roads of these Southern districts. Goulburn had
experience of both these types. In 1830 the “ Bushranging
Act” was passed by the old Legislative Council and in 1831
a party of soldiers and police was sent out from Goulburn
to co-operate with a similar party from Bathurst in rounding
up a gang of bushrangers operating round Rockley. Captain
L. McAlister was in charge, with Sergeant Doyle and
Privates Mclndoe, Mugglestone, Graham and another soldier
of the 28th. The Goulburn party came up with one section
of the gang at Shooter’s Hill near Oberon, when Captain Mc-
Alister was wounded and one bushranger was killed. Another
time that same Goulburn party rounded up a gang at the
Jenolan Caves. On this occasion two convict-bushrangers
were shot, one mortally wounded, others were returned to
the iron-gang and eight were executed in Bathurst.*
The appointment of a Police Magistrate in 1833, to hold
courts at various stations throughout the Southern districts
was a direct outcome of the depredations of the convict type
of bushranger in the Lake Bathurst and Limestone Plains
(Canberra) districts. That the P.M’s. office in Goulburn was
no sinecure in the days of the early bushrangers is evident
from an advertisment of 11 guns and pistols and a large quan-
tity of other stolen goods lying unclaimed at the Goulburn
Police Office in 1840. The advertisement is signed by John
MTntosh, Chief Constable.!
Goulburn’s most famous bushranger was Whitton. His
depredations were committed in and around Goulburn al-
though his headquarters were on the Weddin Mountain. He

was executed in Goulburn on the 19/3/1840. There are full
and harrowing* accounts of the execution in all the Sydney
newspapers. The stunt newspapers of to-day have yet to
learn the very elements of sensationalism as compared with
their forbears of one hundred years ago. It is regretted
that space will not permit of the reproduction of more than
one of them. #
Whitt on was brought back to Goulburn to be hanged.
The escort from Sydney consisted of the gaoler (Keck), a
sergeant and six constables of the mounted police and two
constables in the cart with him. MacAlister who saw the
procession pass through Liverpool names yet another of the
party, Green the hangman, who, he states, “was a bad-
looking old fellow, all pock-marked and knock-kneed, f
Further ghastly details of the execution were published in
week later.J It remained for a third paper to go into
grimmer details still. It said :
“Whitton arrived at Goulburn on Saturday the 14th under the
charge of the jailor and executioner from Sydney, seven mounted
police, a corporal and three privates of the 28th Foot from a
neighbouring stockade. He was lodged in the jail with proper
precaution and it was expected that he would have been executed
on Monday, but it was delayed till Thursday, the 19th. He was
conveyed hither in a cart, heavily ironed, and a man on each
side of him. Another cart accompanied him, containing the
gallows, ready for erection, also the felon’s coffin. The gallows
was erected at the back of the jail. It consisted of four strong
posts of considerable height, within which was a platform about
three feet from the broad bar, the access to which was by a
ladder outside. The platform was composed of two leaves,
hinged at the opposite extremities, the centre of which was sup-
ported by an iron bar or rod, connected with a trundle pole
outside, which elevated or depressed the central prop; an iron
small rod, connected with a general one through two eyes, con-
fining the handle, and upon its being pulled out, and the handle or
lever being lowered the two leaves fall down, leaving an open
space in the middle. Whitton’s conduct since his arrival at Goul-
burn is said to have been very humble and penitent. The Rev. Mr.
Sowerby has been indefatigable in his attendance, and expresses
himself satisfied with his demeanour and, at his request, ad-
ministered the Sacrament to him the night before his execution.
Whitton has employed himself since his arrival at Goulburn in
writing out a long statement understood to be for the Governor,
containing important confessions and suggestions, and above all
attributing his wicked course of life to the fatal absence of all
religious instruction where he served at different places, no chap-

lain having ever been authorised to visit the men, and they never
knowing the difference of a Sunday from a week-day. At 9
o’clock he came out of the jail strongly pinioned attended by the
Rev. Mr. Sowerby, in his canonicals, the Rev. Mr. Cartwright, the
jailor from Sydney and the executioner; the prisoner was neatly
dressed in white, with a crape about his neck, his hair well
combed, and he looked very composed. Mr. Stewart, the Police
Magistrate, was in attendance, also Mr. Shadforth for the Sheriff,
and round the scaffold were 13 mounted police fully armed with
their officer, besides a considerable body of local police with
muskets.
Mr. Sowerby and the prisoner knelt down at the foot of the
gallows, and went through several prayers, in which the latter
joined with great devotion;they then both ascended by the ladder
to the platform when there was another prayer; and the prisoner
took leave of Mr. Sowerby shaking him by the hand; the jailor
and executioner went up and the prisoner after swallowing a
little coffee which was handed up to him in a tin dish, addressed
a few words to the spectators a number of whom were working
men, stating his sense of his conduct which had brought on his
sentence and his wish that they might all be as happy as he now
hoped soon to be; warning them, whatever their masters might
say to them to abstain from using firearms, for, he added “it
was that which brought me here.” He again knelt down and
prayed by himself. The rope was then put about his neck and
the cap was drawn over his face. He shook hands with the
jailor and executioner who descended and on the latter drawing
the pole he was launched into eternity. The fall was very
considerable and he appeared to die soon. After hanging about
an hour he was lowered down and put in the coffin and then
into the grave which was previously dug on the spot. His
aspect was little changed, his neck showed the mark of the vio-
lent ligature. He was twenty-six years of age, and had been
about ten years in the Colony.
There was a numerous attendance of the neighbouring in-
habitants of all grades to witness the carrying into effect of the
just but awful sentence; and it is to be hoped that this example
will be attended with beneficial results amongst the abandoned
and misguided men who are now so openly setting all morality
and law at defiance and continually endangering the lives and
property of the settlers.
When Whitton was first confined in jail at Sydney he wrote
a letter, dipping his pen in his own blood from a prick in his
finger, which was conveyed to his accomplices up the country
urging a rescue and pointing out the place, to be at the hanging
rock between Berrima and Goulburn. It is believed that had
the escort been infantry in place of mounted police this might
have been effected but the escort was too strong and active for
any assailments; though a large number of persons were actually
assembled at that spot. On his first confinement also, he vowed
his regret that he had not shot Mr. Fry and only wished to
avenge himself on him, having never forgiven him for shooting
“Scotchie” the leader of the gang. To show, however, the
change of his feelings under the instructions of the Rev. Mr.
Sowerby he sent for Mr. Fry, who saw him twice and said he


wished to die in charity with all men, and he had sent for him
(Mr. Fry) for that purpose.”**
Now a curious thing happens. The rest of that story
is to be found, of all places in the world, in the report of the
Australian Diocesan Committee of the S.P.G. and S.P.C.K.
The “Monitor” tells of the presence of the Rev Robert
Cartwright at the execution but gives no reason. It was
not his duty or his parish. It appears from the report of
Bishop Broughton to his Diocesan Committee that old Robert
Cartwright, then in his seventieth year, made the long and
difficult journey to the Lachlan to warn the associates of
Whitton, and at Whitton’s request, of the dangers of follow-
ing bushranging as a profession.*
Another account of “Scotchy, Witton, Russel and Rey-
nolds” (sic) says that “Witton” and Reynolds were lodged
in adjoining cells in the Goulburn gaol, where “they con-
certed to commit suicide by hanging at a given signal.”
Reynolds is said to have done so but Whitton was prevented
by the turnkey. This writer also gives another version of
the Rev. Robert Cartwright’s visit to the Bland.f The full
story of the murder of John Kennedy Hume, brother of the
explorer, by Whitton, Scotchy and Reynolds at Gunning in
1840, and their subsequent exploits at Narrawa is told by
Chas. MacAlister.J
William Westwood (Jackey Jackey) was another local
bushranger. He was transported in 1837 at the age of 16.
Three years later, in 1840, he took to the bush in this dis-
trict. At first he robbed mail coaches on the Bungendore
road. Growing more daring he operated on the main
Southern road and even visited Sydney. In 1841 he was
captured and sentenced to penal servitude for life. Attempt-
ing to escape from Cockatoo Island he was sent to Port
Arthur. He escaped from there and was recaptured in
Hobart. He was then sent to Norfolk Island. There in
July 1846, he headed a riot, killed four policemen, and was
hanged on the 13/10/1846 at the age of 26.§
An hour after the mail had left Bungonia on January
10th, 1843, two men came out of the bush and ordered the

driver some distance away while they took the bags and
robbed the only passenger of his few pounds. Then they
made the driver proceed to Marulan. Mr. Addison of
Marulan notified Goulburn of the robbery and Capt. Christie
of the Mounted Police went in pursuit of the bandits. The
“Sydney Morning Herald” reported that there was no clue
“to date, but the contents of the mail bags were of no use
to anyone save the owners.
In 1845 the “Sydney Morning Herald” complained of
a “gang of lawless scoundrels” infesting the country “with-
in 30 miles of a station of Mounted Police.” A hold up at
“the Muddy Water-holes, about five miles from the Inn kept
by the Frenchman at the old Collector (Lake George)” and
other similar local outrages were listed.!
The depredations of the second type of bushranger have
been well summarised by Dr. Frederick Watson. His ac-
count is too long for quotation in full but here are its
Goulburn items :
“In the year 1863, on the 20th of May, Gardiner, John Gilbert,
John O’Meally and James Lowry stuck up and robbed the Cooma
to Goulburn mail at Sandhills. On the 9th of June, three
troopers fought three bushrangers about twenty miles from
Goulburn; the bushrangers escaped uninjured, but senior con-
stable Hughes was wounded. On the 4th of July, Gilbert and
O’Meally robbed the Sydney mail, when one mile and a half
from Goulburn.... On the Bth of November, Hall, Gilbert and
Dunleavy stuck up and robbed Rossiville near Goulburn and,
three days later, robbed the Goulburn to Yass mail.... In the
year 1865, on the 27th of January, Hall and his gang bailed up
about fifty people on the Collector road; they then robbed the
store at Collector, and Dunn shot constable Nelson dead in the
street from behind a post. On the 6th of February the same
trio stuck up the Braidwood mail, when twelve miles from Goul-
burn ”
Dr. Watson gives a long list of outrages in 1866. In
1867
“ On the 22nd of February the Clarkes robbed the Goul-
burn mail and all the passengers except the Eevd. John Dunmore
Lang, whose money they declined to touch... .
He mentions 13 bushrangers who were shot, 10 who
were hung, 10 police and 10 civilians who were shot in these
years. The Frank Gardiner he mentions was the most
picturesque bushranger of all. He was born near Goulburn

in 1830. In 1850 he received a sentence of 5 years for horse-
stealing. At the expiration of that sentence he made his
way back to Goulburn where he received a sentence of 7
years on the roads, again for horse-stealing. He was re-
leased after serving half the sentence. He next appeared
on the Lambing Flat Goldfield as a bushranger. His greatest
coup was the robbery of the Eugowra gold escort on June
15th, 1862.
S. H. Belcher supplied further details of Gardiner’s
exploits in this district:
“After the Eugowra gold robbery Gardiner made his way to
the Hills at Reid’s Flat and was captured in William Fogg’s
house by two policemen. In the scuffle one policeman was shot
in the wrist and Gardiner was wounded. One officer was left
in charge of Gardiner whilst the other rode 12 miles to Bigga
to report to Grainger who was in charge of a party of police.
On their return to Fogg’s, Gardiner was gone and the police
horse shot up a gully and the policeman tied up, I believe. He
said the rest of the gang had released Gardiner, shot his horse
and tied him up. The truth was “they gave him £SO to let
Gardiner go,” this was found out through part of the £SO being
a 50/- cheque.”
“This was told to me by Supt. Grainger himself when he was
at Goulburn. The gang used to frequent the Fish River (Lach-
lan) and stuck up Narrawa Station (Gibson’s then). The store-
keeper named Fry locked himself and a boy in the store among
the flour sacks. One of the gang called on Fry to come out
and as the man showed out Fry shot him through the forehead.
He is buried in a gully near the “Narrawa bridge, known now
as “Scotty’s” gully. (The name of the bushranger.)”*
Gardiner stole £21,000 and 250 horses. In 1864 he
was arrested in Queensland, brought to Sydney and tried.
In all he was then sentenced to 32 years, but on 2/7/1874
he was liberated and deported, f
Goulburn would seem to have been saddled with the
responsibility for the bushrangers by those in authority, e.g.:
“In his inaugural address to the Church Society on July 28th,
1864, Bishop Thomas said:
“The ministrations of the Gospel are urgently needed in many
districts.... The Georgiana county, or the Abercrombie district,
sixty miles north of Goulburn, is nearest to us, and stands first
in its claims upon our sympathy, because it is regarded as the
place whence bushranging emanated.”
The following year His Excellency the Governor, Sir
John Young, presided at the first annual meeting of the
* Lr. 28/11/1940.
t “Story of Aust.” Vol. 3., pp., 254/8,


Goulburn Church Society, and had something to say on the
subject;
“With regard to the state of the district (the Goulburn dio-
cese) he was afraid that all must admit that there was much
to deplore. It had been denied —but only faintly denied—that
there existed amongst a large number of people a sympathy
with the perpetrators of the outrages which were bringing a
disgrace on the country. .. The force of circumstances and the
nature of the country had thinly scattered the population over
the territory. Many were strangers to the ministrations of the
clergyman and the offices of the school master.... The bush-
rangers were bringing disgrace and misfortune on the very
classes most prone to admire them. .. . the evil could only be
permanently met by introducing a sound religious education
amongst the young....”
In 1865 Canon Leigh had an encounter with bushrangers. He
was going to Shelley’s Flats to perform a wedding and was
stopped by bushrangers waiting for the mail on the Sydney side
of Governor’s Hill. They did not rob him, but on the contrary
submitted to an exhortation from him dissuading them from
their career of crime. The men admitted that their lives were
a burden to them and that they would be willing to abandon
their evil pursuits if only they could be allowed to leave New
South Wales in safety. This was not Canon Leigh’s only
encounter with bushrangers. He would often tell of other ad-
ventures, including one when he saved a substantial wedding fee
by concealing several pound notes in his socks.*
The Rev. James Hassall, after he left Bungonia in 1853,
was chaplain of Berrima gaol. He tells of two young
fellows convicted on circumstantial evidence of a mail rob-
bery near Goulburn:
“I took some trouble to prove the innocence of the supposed
culprits. Everything seemed clear against them. They had
passed the place where the robbery occurred a few hours before.
A passenger by the coach swore to the voice of one man;
another passenger to a patch on the other man’s shirt.... I
obtained proof that they were thirty miles away at the time the
coach was “stuck-up” and that some Crookwell bushrangers,
knowing that these young fellows were in the neighbourhood,
and that suspicion would be likely to fall on them, came down
to the place, robbed the mail, and returned unsuspected. My
clients confessed that they had stolen a horse and a watch, and
that they did not bear good characters, so I left them in their
cells, fearing that they would soon be back again if I turned
them out.”t
Several of these bushranging exploits are mentioned
in the duty book of the Goulburn police, as e.g.:
“In 1863 “The Mail from Goulburn to Sydney was stuck up
and the passengers robbed by two armed Bushrangers, Ist about
26 years of age, sft. and dark hair and whiskers.... (clothing

and horse described), 2nd 23 years of age, about the same height
as the first, fair hair and whiskers.... (clothing and horse
described the latter the property of Wm. Davies Storekeeper of
this Town.) ”||
Ben Hall, Gilbert and Dunn stuck up “Rossiville” on
8/11/1864. They had threatened for some time to attack
it and to flog Captain (F.R.L.) Rossi. However the night
they arrived both Captain Rossi and his wife were away.
It was shearing time and the bushrangers waited until every-
thing was quiet and the night well advanced before
beginning operations. Leaving their horses in the shadow
of the hawthorn hedge, they bailed up those on the premises
and locked up the two menservants. Otherwise they did
not molest the domestics. They ransacked the place,
sampling the liquors and smoking the cigars. Gilbert had
some little idea of music and whilst he banged the piano
Dunn and Hall danced jigs and hornpipes.*
Towards midnight they loaded up a pack-horse with
their booty, clothes, jewelry and eatables. They also ap-
propriated Mrs. Rossi’s riding mare “Jenny Lind.” On
other occasions bushrangers purloined and ruined other fine
horses of Capt. F. R. L. Rossi’s.f
On one occasion Hall and Gilbert appropriated Captain
Rossi’s racehorse “Snip” and rode the horse from the Wed-
din Mountain to Young and back again in a day, a journey
of over 90 miles. Capt. Rossi offered £lOO reward but it
was a long time before the horse was restored to its owner.
“Snip” was bought in by the pound-keeper at Hay, and lent
to a mounted trooper who recognised the brand and returned
the horse to its owner. J
A long article in 1865 headed “Our Colonial Banditti”
tells of the Solicitor-General’s concern because
“of the highwaymen who infest the Southern and Western
districts.”
Depredations by Hall, Gilbert and Dunn included robb-
ing H. Chisholm and others on the highway near Goulburn
on the 24/10/1864; the Goulburn mail six miles from Goul-
burn, on the 19/12/1864, near the Towrang toll-bar. §

§ “111. Syd. News,’ 7 15/4/1865, 16/1/1865.


The daring of this gang is revealed by the following
story which quite possibly refers to this last robbery:
“A letter from Sydney to Albury recently passed through the
Post Office bearing the following endorsal (sic) : “Messrs. Hall,
Gilbert and Co., let this pass; nothing of value inside.” If
this does not cause our rulers to blush, what will?”*
On the 16/1/1865:
“Great excitement prevailed in the town of Goulburn in con-
sequence of information having been received by the police that
bushrangers intended to attack the town and rifle the banks;
but, as might be expected, the bushrangers did not put in an
appearance. Indeed the fact of the police getting information
of this kind was proof that it was unfounded.”
Hall, Gilbert and Coy. robbed Christie’s store near
Wheeo, stole some racehorses in Crookwell, and made an
attempt on the Yass-Goulburn mail (when they were driven
off by the police) and robbed Bean’s Inn near Gunning.
These encounters do not appear in Dr. Watson’s summary.!
A fuller account of the battle between the police and
Ben Hall’s gang at Breadalbane on the 23/2/1865 reads:
“A party of police from the Goulburn station in company with
W. Huthwaite, J.P., who had been following Ben Hall’s gang
from place to place known as their haunts finally at about nine
o’clock on Thursday evening (23rd February) reached Lodge’s
Inn near the second Breadalbane Plains the landlord being at the
time in Goulburn charged with being an accomplice of the bush-
rangers.... Trooper Wiles was shot through the leg and hand,
almost at the commencement and was placed on a vehicle and
brought to Goulburn.”
Christian McKinnon and Ellen Monks brought up before
the Goulburn magistrates charged with assisting Hall, Gilbert
and Dunn to burn Morriss’ store at Binda were committed
for trial. Margaret Monks, charged with the same offence,
was discharged. Lodge, the publican at Breadalbane was
committed for receiving goods stolen by the gang 4
Laurence (Larry) Cummins, whose arrest is described
in chapter 12, was convicted in 1865 of bushranging and
sentenced to 15 years’ hard labour on the roads. Whilst
being forwarded to Sydney he attempted to escape. §
The Goulburn Sessions of 1865 were mainly concerned
with bushrangers. Wm. Corcoran was convicted of robbing
and wounding, and sentenced to death. Tracy, Middleton
and Wilson were convicted of bushranging and under the
Felons’ Apprehension Act, Hall, Gilbert and Dunn were

summoned to surrender to justice at Goulburn on or before
29/4/1865. Not having done so they were formally out-
lawed.*
There are several references in the Police Duty Book to
robberies not noticed elsewhere. Here is one:
“The man who robbed the Cooma mail on Monday (last) is
thus described: about sft sins. high, middle-aged, stout, dressed
in dirty shepherd’s plaid trousers, patched on knees, much worn
at bottoms, strong boots. Black sac coat much worn buttoned
up round neck. Old cabbage tree hat over dirty handkerchief
round face and blackened. Armed with single-barrelled gun,
difficult to recognise from the manner disguised.”t
The Yass mail to Goulburn was stuck up on 27/7/1866
by three mounted armed robbers who took the mails and
robbed the passengers. From Mr. Lynch the bushrangers
took £5. One passenger saved £l3 by throwing it into the
coach where the robbers missed it. Six mail bags were
cut open, an operation taking an hour. The robbers sent
for a bottle of brandy from their camp and were “most
courteous and chatty to the passengers. ” The coach was
then allowed to proceed. Reaching the Goulburn side of
“Red House’ ’ it met a party of troopers and black trackers.
The troopers included Kelly who had recently shot Connell.{
On the 3/8/1866 the same party robbed “Garroori-
gang.” Details of this robbery are not available. §
The Southern Mail was stuck up and robbed by Clarke’s
gang near Goulburn on 1/8/1866. ||
The Gundaroo to Goulburn mail was stuck up on 16th
November, 1866. Two armed men cut open the mail bags,
extracted what they required and let John Moran, the driver,
son of Thos. Moran, publican, bring in the balance of the
mail**
The Yass mail was robbed again on the 7/12/1866.
The Sydney mail from Goulburn was robbed on the
23/2/1867 by three armed men on horseback “about a mile
at the Goulburn side of the Towrang Toll-bar.” W. P.
Faithfull was one of the passengers. As was the Rev. Dr.
Lang. The Yass mail was robbed on the same day at Mut-

billy, twenty miles from Goulburn by bushrangers supposed
to be the Clarke gang. All letters were taken and one
passenger robbed of £lO. On the 27/2/1867 the Yass mail
was robbed again 19 miles from Goulburn. The Rev. J. M.
Ware of Boorowa and the Rev. C. J. Byng of Tumut were
passengers.*
At the Goulburn assizes in 1867, Gough, Cunningham,
Baldwin and Brown, bushrangers, were convicted and each
sentenced to 15 years’ penal servitude.!
At 10 p.m. on 26th May 1869, Cobb and Co’s, coach from
Yass was stuck up at Run-of-Water, about two miles from
Goulburn. The horses were walking, the reins being held
by W. J. Webb, a passenger, when two men rode up and
said “bail up,” Trooper Chalker, an inside passenger,
stepped out and fired, the man fell, Chalker fired two more
shots at the other ruffian who had fired a pistol loaded with
duck shot, the contents of which lodged in the face of Long-
held the dentist, who fell as if dead. Jenkins the driver,
drove quickly to Goulburn where it was found Longheld
was severely injured and one eye entirely destroyed.
Troopers Fenton, Buckley, Waters and Chalker were des-
patched in pursuit. Sydney detectives, Powell and Lyons,
went on foot but no traces of the robbers were discovered.!
The late Charles Rogers told of two encounters with
bushrangers. Once he and his mates were stuck up by Gil-
bert. Gilbert happening to observe the bullock driver
walking round to the other side of the waggon for his gun,
cleared in a standing jump the pair of pole bullocks and
intercepted the driver. On another occasion on the Braid-
wood road Chas Rogers had a close shave with Dunn, who
chased him for six miles.

The four brothers left for Sydney in a four-in-hand and
were attacked by Ben Hall and his gang. Some of their
horses were killed.
The Government recognised this happening by an issue
of medals :
“They are of gold and about the size of a crown. On the one
side is the profile of the Queen surrounded by the words “Colony
of New South Wales;” on the other are the words “Granted for
gallant and faithful services,” surrounding the Australian Arms
and a scroll within which are engraved, “William Percy Faith-
full, George Ernest Faithfull, Henry Montague Faithfull and
Reginald Faithfull.”*
A fire at Springfield in 1913 destroyed the brake in
which the Faithfull brothers were driving when they en-
countered the bushrangers. This had been carefully
preserved until then.f
Sir Alfred Stephen in 1873 said:
“He did not forget that from the Goulburn bench the idea
emanated which caused the suppression of bushranging. ... He
referred to the law for criminating harbourers of these out-
laws.”!
Hawthorne, who was hanged at Goulburn Gaol in 1874
for a number of murders, made a horrible attempt to murder
James Slocombe on the Wheeo Road. First he bound Slo-
combe to a tree. Then he tried to cut his throat. Slocombe,
making a superhuman effort, managed to free himself and
escape. John Chalker, who died in Goulburn Hospital at
the age of 75 on the 10/7/1915, was the constable who
arrested Hawthorne and later saw him hanged. MacAlister
however, says it was Sergeant Cotter, of Tuena, at the head
of a party of civilians who arrested Hawthorne on Kanga-
loola Creek near Peelwood.§
The mail from Goulburn to Queanbeyan was stuck up
3 miles from Collector on 22/4/1874.||
Peter Plunkett, the bushranger who stuck up the Quean-
beyan coach in 1875 was arrested by Senior Sergeant Fenton
and Mounted Constable Pritzler on 26/3/1875. Foolishly
he had stitched the wrong halves of various £5 and £lO
notes together and attempted to pass them at Horton’s “Bois
Chere” hotel.**

CHAPTER VII.
ABORIGINES.
HE aborigines are now quite extinct in this district.
It is doubtful if they were very numerous at any
time. They probably came in the summer months
and migrated to the warmer regions of the coast and the
Lachlan valley for the winter. Charles MacAlister records
that in his youth the aborigines on the Tablelands were
fairly numerous. He mentions three local tribes, the Mul-
warrie, Tarlo and Burra Burra tribes. Of these the Burras
were the most warlike, their country including the Aber-
crombie district, Taralga and Carrabungla. He speaks of
their fights with the Lachlan blacks. He also refers to
the Wollondilly tribe as having its burying place upon the
hill above Lansdowne House.
When Governor Macquarie and his party camped at
the junction of the Gundary Creek with the Mulwaree Ponds
in October 1820, two encounters with aborigines were noted.
Some had joined the party here, others had set out with the
party. They provided five eels caught in the Mulwaree.
They slept by the camp fire, through a violent rain storm
and with the thermometer at 39 degrees. They recovered
all but two of the Governor’s horses which had taken fright
and stampeded.
Hamilton Hume has a casual reference to the blacks
at South Hill foraging for food between the two hills, North
and South. This was in 1821 or 1822. Traces of the
aborigines can still be found. Stone axe heads still turn
up and there are quarries where these were obtained with
broken heads in different stages of manufacture scattered
about. Stone knives for skinning animals and mortars for
preparing food have also been found.
One of the earliest references to aborigines here was in
1826 when a case of cannibalism in Argyle was reported.
A shepherd employed at Greenwich Park was killed and
alleged to have been eaten by the blacks.
The next year the “Monitor” complained that:
“The black who killed and did eat J. Taylor at Lake Bathurst
has been loosed out of gaol and has returned to the Lake for
similar acts and human feasts. 1 ”*
* “Monitor,” 23/3/1827.


The news of the murder of Roach, the overseer at
Clifford’s Creek, in 1830, by White and Mooney, was brought
to Goulburn by native runners.* According to MacAlister
the “bora” ceremony was performed upon a small red hill
near the site of the present Kenmore hospital.f James Back-
house, the Quaker missionary, who visited Goulburn in 1836,
paints an unpleasant picture of Goulburn’s relations with
blacks. He describes the inhabitants of Goulburn as:
“of the lower order: victims of immorality, the scourge of this
class, in sequestered parts of the Colony, frequented by
aborigines.”
On the 10/10/1836 he recounts a meeting with blacks:
“near a place, where Mountain Limestone crops out, by the
side of a chain of ponds....”
which rather suggests Rocky Hill. He proceeds:
“we fell in with a tribe of blacks, resting by a fire, under the
shelter of some bushes; two of whom frequently do turns of
work, in hewing wood, drawing water, etc., for the settler at
whose home we lodged. One of the women was eating raw
sow-thistles, as salad, with avidity.”t
MacAlister, writing of Goulburn in 1839, notes that
the aborigines outnumbered the white spectators at the first
Goulburn races by “ten to one or more.”§
Surveyor Govett wrote at length on the subject of the
aborigines in the thirties of last century. He said:
“It was in the County of Argyle that I first beheld the natives
in their natural simplicity.”
Considerable portions of his observations were re-
published by J. M. Forde in Sydney “ Truth. ”||
Govett speaks of a visit he paid in the forest at Tarlo
to a tribe of aborigines at night. He writes of two fine
chiefs he saw.
Dr George Bennett in 1834 noticed that:
“Several of the blacks at Goulburn Plains... .had pits on their
faces, resembling those produced by small-pox, and which, they
informed me, were caused by the disease in question. The name
that this disease is known by among the aborigines is “Thunna,
thunna,” or “Tunna, tunna” ”
He goes on to describe the symptoms, stating that the
adults suffered more severely than the children, but that
there were no deaths among the children.

While staying at Lansdowne Dr. Bennett records:
“The aborigines were now collecting about the farms in
expectation of a feast at the ensuing Christmas festival. I
went up to one who was busily engaged making an opposum-
skin cloak: he sewed the skins together with the fibres of the
bark of the ‘stringy bark’ tree for thread, by first perforating
holes in it with a sharp piece of bone, and then passing the
thread through the holes as he proceeded.”*
Bennett tells of how Christmas was regarded as a festi-
val by the blacks near the habitation of whites because of
the gifts of provisions and spirits made then. He describes
several tribes camped on the Goulburn Plains. Some were
in "native costume/' with "an extra dab of red ochre" and
the "bolombine" round the head. Others wore "the yellow
crest of the white cockatoo, pending from their beards."
The women were "glowing in grease and red ochre," their
ringlets "decorated with opossum tails" and "the incisor
teeth of the kangaroo;" some had the "Cambun," the
"Bolombine" of the Tumut country. Both men and women
had raised cicatrices over the breast, arms and back. They
were much amused at a bugle which they called "Cobbong"
(large) whistle. He then describes how the blacks became
inebriated. He gives a few words of the Goulburn
aboriginals’ vocabulary: One "Metong," two "Bulla," three
"Bulla metong," plenty "Nerang and Gorang."
David Waugh, writing to his mother in Edinburgh on
the 30/10/1834, said:
“I have engaged the blacks of whom I know a great many, and
who are working about Mummel, when they are hungry, to get
me some opposum cloaks, I’ll send you one apiece if I can—
I’ll get them for a little powder and shot.”!
Sir Thomas Mitchell, writing in 1836, gives a vocabulary
of the Wollondilly tribe comparing it with six other
aboriginal languages. The differences were very marked.
Father was "Curra ya." Mother was "Gammuang," and
child "Coota." Dog was "Merrigang" or " Wurrigal. "t
The Rev. Benj. Hurst in 1842 reported to the Methodist
District meeting in Sydney upon his ministrations to the
aboriginals of the Goulburn district. He said:
“The past year has been one of great anxiety to the Mission-
aries on this Station, in consequence of the apparent fruitlessness

of their labours. ... So inveterate are the prejudices of one tribe
against the other. .. .so powerful their superstitions, and so fre-
quent their quarrels, that until the Gospel shall be brought to bear
upon their hearts there can be but little hope that any attempts
to induce them to associate peaceably for any length of time
will be successful. But, perhaps, the most formidable obstacle
in the way of their conversion is their connection with the worst
class of Europeans.”*
Two Argyle aborigines, Jimmy Hamilton and Burra
Burra Jimmy, assisted in the tracking of “Jacky Jacky”
(Westwood) and other escaped convicts in Tasmania in
1844. f
A tribute to the peaceful nature of the settlement of the
Goulburn district has been published frequently but the
reference is never given. It runs:
“The settlement made at Goulburn Plains was remarkable for
being one of the few at which there was no feud between the
black and white races. The first settlers were circumspect and
kindly to the natives who responded amicably. One stockman
indeed obtained by force a native woman. The tribe remon-
strated, and told the man they would kill him rather than allow
him to keep their countrywoman and they kept their word. An
inquest was instituted, but when the facts became known no
steps were taken by the authorities to avenge the stockman’s
death. No other victim fell on either side subsequently.!
The influenza epidemic of 1846/7 accelerated the dis-
appearance of the aborigines. They proved peculiarly
susceptible to the disease. Dr. Waugh is said to have taken
the measurements of Yarraginny, chief of the Wollondilly
tribe in 1848 and to have expressed the opinion that such a
perfectly formed man would scarcely be found in the British
army.§
After the epidemic, the Bench of Magistrates estimated
the number of aborigines in Goulburn in 1848, as 25. There
were then 150 in the district of Fish River and Lake George
on the authority of the Rev. Robert Cartwright.||
The aborigines used to camp on the hill near the Lans-
downe homestead in the forties and fifties of last century.
As late as the sixties some of their graves could be seen.
Wm. Bradley used to issue rations and blankets to them,
especially at Christmas time.**

John Lansdowne stated that when he first came to Goul-
hurn he saw a corroborec upon what is now the site of All
Saints’ Church, East grove. §
Illustrating the tendency of the civilized aboriginal to
go "bush” Judge Therry, writing in 1863, says:
“I met a group of some seventy natives on the Goulburn road.
Amongst them was a young half-cast comely woman, with an
infant, called a ‘pic-a-ninny,’ in a small bag on her back, the
strings of the bag tied round her neck, and the copper-coloured
face of the little urchin peeping out at the mouth of the bag.
Her husband—so she called him—a coal-black brute covered
with hair, held a large stick, called a ‘waddy’ in his hand, with
which he gave her now and then a blow to hurry her on. I
stopped to speak to the party, especially to this young female.
She told me, in fluent English, that she had been for two years
a housemaid in the service of Mr. Throsby, of Throsby Park, but
that the black monster, who accompanied her, had enticed her
away. On asking if she wished to return to her former res-
pectable service, she burst into tears and said she did not care.
They were tears of a powerful struggle for a moment between
the civilized home she had left and the wandering life she was
leading; but her monster-guardian came up and with a sharp
crack of his waddy on her head, interrupted our parley, and
made her move on.”*
A peculiar story was told by J. T. Walker at a public
lecture in Goulburn on 1/5/1898. He said:
“That a woman was discovered living with the blacks in Gipps-
land. She was requested to leave a message on the bark of
a tree and did so, stating that she was the wife of a brewer
then living in Goulburn. This brewer had sent home for his
wife, and as he never heard of the vessel, he concluded that she
had been lost and married again. The news caused intense
excitement. A stockrider endeavoured to rescue the woman and
got her on his horse. He was, however, driven away by a
shower of spears, and had to let the woman go. On looking
back he saw the blacks murdering her.”t
Walker added that the story had not previously ap-
peared in print.
" J.A.8.,” writing in the "Penny Post” and recalling
the late sixties and early seventies said:
“In those days the Yass tribe of Aborigines under old King
Andy used to encamp for a time on the Stringy Bark Range to
the west of the town. An unlucky crack on the head by a
falling boomerang is still well impressed on the writer’s mind
as a juvenile experience.”!

Mrs. Wilson, widow of W. J. Wilson, who at one time
ran a line of coaches between Goulbnrn and Yass, died in
Goulbiirn on 30/9/1907. She had lived in Goulbnrn 60
years and could remember a corroboree of 3000 aborigines
being held on the site of the Goulbnrn railway station.*
Henry Kendall wrote a poem in which he spoke of the
demoralisation of the Goulbnrn blacks. One verse ran:
“Where the savage, back from foray,
By the marshy lone Macquarie
Or meandering Mulwarree,
Held his snake and 'possum swarry
Now we see him sick and sorry
Follow Brewer Bartlett's lorry.
And the noble chief King Billy
Laps the beer until he's silly,
Starts a howling willy nilly,
Clubs his loving lubra Lillie,
Then he does six months on skilly
In the gaol by Wollondilly.”t

CHAPTER VIII.
THE GOLD RUSH AND SUBSEQUENT MINING.
OLD was discovered in the Goulburn District in 1851
and at first the town shared in the boom. People
from Braidwood and other centres flocked into town
and the stores did a wonderful trade. ‘ ‘ Gold-digger ’ ’ makes
its appearance in records in 1851, especially in the Anglican
and Presbyterian registers. Soon however, the discovery
of gold had exactly the opposite effect. Everybody went
to the diggings. The towns were deserted. Goulburn
shared that fate for awhile. A newspaper account says:
“Yesterday (3/6/1851) Goulburn presented a most exciting
appearance by the departure of about seventy of our townsmen,
principally mechanics, who left for the gold regions; there were
six teams well laden, with plenty of horse-power attached to
each; they all go well provided for a stay at the diggings, not
only with provisions, but each company has a cradle and imple-
ments, picks, crowbars, shovels and everything requisite for the
enterprise; they all seemed full of spirit, and the sanguine ex-
pectation of realising a speedy fortune was seen in every face.
The wives and children of some of those who left, as well as
acquaintances, conveyed those who were departing some distance
out of the town. The excitement was greatly enhanced by our
townsman McKenzie, with his pibroch, who blew as if he would
send his heart’s blood into the bag. Altogether such a scene
and such an occasion never presented itself in this district before.
This is the third batch that has left, and a fourth goes on Friday.
The town will in a few days be completely deserted.”*
James Waugh, writing to his mother on the 21/5/1851,
of the Bathurst gold rush, also has something to say about
its effect on prices:
“The excitement this day is intense. Great news from Bathurst,
Gold very plentiful—Flour up to £4O a ton. Tell David if he
can buy wheat at 10/- a bushel to do so to as great an extent
as he likes, it will be £1 soon.”
And he offered to share in the speculation up to 100
bushels, f
Writing to his father on the 24/5/1851 Dr. Robert
Waugh said of the discovery of gold:
“I am afraid it will be the greatest curse the country ever saw.
It seems completely to have turned people’s heads, and had the
effect of raising the price of all necessaries. Wheat is now
freely purchased here at 10/- a bushel and some are holding on
till it rises to 15/-. Other things in proportion.”!

W. A. G. Brander wrote of the depression in Goulburn
which was the result of the gold rush:
“Carpenters and masons were glad to accept £1 per week....
Beef would be bought at one penny per pound but bread was
considered cheap at one shilling and sixpence the two pound
loaf.”*
Another account says:
“The once busy bustling town of Goulburn is now reduced to
a hitherto unknown state of quietness. Shops are lacking cus-
tomers, some are closed, men are scarce, husbands have left
wives, servants quitted their employment. In short, nearly all
that could have packed up and are off for the diggings around
Braidwood.”t
Chas. MaeAlister wrote in 1906 of gold mining in the ’sos.
“The first Goulburn prospecting company consisted of Cohen
(the publican), Simons senr., Woodward, Andy Newman, D.
Kennedy, C. Fitzpatrick, T. O’Brien (Harp Hotel), Wm. Evans,
senr., Wm. Gillard, Clarke and S. Marks ((manager for Ben-
jamin and Moses) and one or two names I cannot recall.”
He himself led a party through the Tarlo and Cookbun-
doon districts. Another led by Wm. Clarke (jeweller) tried
the Bungonia ranges.
It was proposed to sink a hole or two at Garrooringang
and to try the watershed of the Mulwaree from Thorn’s
Bridge northwards. This was not done then. A year or
two afterwards Chas. Thomas obtained a few grains of gold
when sinking a well at Garooringang. MaeAlister affirmed
that there was gold to be got on the Garroorigang Flats. $
Jimmie Beattie, an old Goulburn identity, joined the
Tuena gold rush in 1851 and struck gold. The claim brought
in £I2OO for each man in his party. Several Goulburn men
were amongst those who rushed the Araluen diggings, as
e.g., Wm. Davies, Wm. Connolly, Owen Burner, Jimmy Mars-
den and J. Kingsell.§
Writing in 1852, Samuel Sidney said:
“The opening of goldfields in the Goulburn District, another
fine pastoral and agricultural country, seventy miles from Syd-
ney and on the Shoalhaven River, followed the Turon, and every
day brought some new obscure spot into temporary attention;
but nine-tenths of the reports are mere repetitions of the same
coloured story. ”||
Subscriptions were solicited for the promotion of the
welfare of the Goulburn district, more particularly for the
encouragement of the discovery of gold in 1852. The lists

were displayed amongst other places at O’Sullivan’s
Bank. ” ##
A paragraph in the Goulburn “Herald” describes a dis-
covery of quicksilver at Wollorogang (J. W. Chisholm) and
paints a roseate picture of a future “Colonial enterprise.
Gold was found 16 miles from Goulburn on the road to Gun-
daroo in 1854 and was at first expected to rival the Victorian
diggings. The discovery was made at Rose Lagoon by two
diggers from Braidwood.f A public meeting was called by
S. Davis of the Australian Stores to encourage development.
This was held at the Commercial Hotel when a large reward
was offered for successful gold finds. A week later an
advertisement appeared offering £IOOO reward for the dis-
covery of a paying goldfield in the County of Argyle or such
part of Georgiana as is within the police district of Goul-
burn. A paragraph headed “Gold at Last” describes a
nugget found at Tuena and exhibited at Ross’ Argyle Inn.
The public was angry in that the site and the name of the
finder were kept secret.^
J. W. L. Thomson in some reminiscences said he re-
membered :
“the day when Junction Point ‘broke out,’ i.e., when they
found gold there. It was near Tuena, and there was a big
rush. Goulburn was sudden death in the sixties. The recent
depression was nothing to the one we had in those days
the people went out looking for gold Mr. Tom Daniel, Mr.
Harry Blackshaw, Mr. Paul Pinn, and Mr. H. Herriott were
some of those I remember who made their way out there. Few
of them met with success, and most of them returned to Goul-
burn.’^
The “Sydney Gold Escort” operated in Goulburn for
several years. Its “Deed of Settlement” is dated 20/1/1850.
It provided for the establishment of a Joint Stock Company,
“for the purpose of conveying Gold, Silver and Precious stones
money bullion, Specie and Bank and other notes and Bills from
place to place within the Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria
and South Australia and for other purposes....”
The initial capital was £50,000 in 5000 shares of £lO
each. Later in the document “Quartz and ore” are men-
tioned as amongst the valuables to be conveyed and
escorted. The first directors were G. A. Lloyd, J. G. Cohen,

porary office was “Exchange Buildings, Sydney” or “Lyon’s
Buildings, 2nd Floor.” The Sydney Gold Escort Com-
pany’s Bill was reported upon by a select committee of the
Legislative Council on 19/7/1853. In the Minutes of Evi-
dence the President, G. A. Lloyd, said that the company had
been operating since “the end of January” and had already
brought £200,000 of gold dust to the city.
“The Merchants of Sydney employ us to take up notes
and to bring down gold.” There were then eighty-one
shareholders “among whom are some of the wealthiest men
in the country. S. Emanuel of Goulburn was amongst
those shareholders. The Goulburn “Herald” reported that
the Sydney Gold Escort, which left Sydney on the 13/1/1853
“is expected any day.” The uniform consisted of blue jacket
and trousers trimmed with silver lace. Boots of enamelled
leather and a blue military cap. Guard consisted of Captain
Amos, Lieutenant Smith and 12 gentlemen (cadets) with
Superintendent Maister. General disapproval was expressed
of the two horse vehicle brought by the Sydney Gold Escort
to convey the gold. It could not manage more than 10 cwt.,
only a third of the amount waiting transmission.
A coach and four horses was suggested. “The uni-
forms are gratuitous and the pay 14/- a day.”f In 1854 the
Union Bank was its Goulburn Agent and Captain J. T. Tre-
keld was “in command of Escort Guard of seven armed
Cadets, from and to Goulburn and Gundagai.”J Later the
company had its own offices in Montague Street. There are
a few disjointed references to the operations of this company
in the Goulburn newspapers. A leading article in 1854 con-
tained strong criticism of Long, resident agent at the “Ovens
Gold Fields,” Snake Valley, Victoria.
It appealed to the Attorney-General to condemn the
company for transforming itself into “a Bank of Issue.”
The editor declared his intention of protecting the interests
of local people. What the actual difficulty was is not now
apparent. Gold carried to Sydney by the Sydney Gold
Escort Company by January 1854, amounted to 89,915 ozs.

Mail Guard, Goulburn” and James Hevey as the “Gold
Escort” in the early sixties. Wm. Carter Lynch was “Clerk

Application was made in 1872 by Wm. H. Deloitte to
register the “City of Sydney Quartz Mining Coy. Ltd.”
The place of mining was Tuena, the nominal capital
£21,000 in £1 shares. The amount paid up was £13,500.
Three and a half columns of an advertisement, contain the
names of the shareholders who included: “Robert Fletcher,
Kippilaw; W. H. Thackall, Kippilaw; Harry Sexby, Gunn-
ing; Horton junr. 'Traveller’s Rest’, Goulburn; Henry

The Argyle Iron Mine was a flotation of 1849. The
mine was at Shelley’s Flats.ft
S. Emanuel discovered opals in the Abercrombie
ranges in 1872. ||
The “Australian Copper Mining Company Ltd.” was
operating in 1873. Its directors were Wm. Davies, F. S.

was its manager in 1871 and Francis Smith Fielder its
accountant.**
The “Green Gully Copper Mining Company,” (Thos.
Wilkie, chairman, J. Richardson, treasurer), went into
liquidation in 1874. Its remaining assets were dissipated
in “Supper and Refreshments” at the “Emu Inn” to the
indignation of certain shareholders not present. At the
same time the “Peelwood Copper Mining Company,” was
making a profit of £BOO per month in 1874. The “Goul-
burn Copper Mine” (J. T. Gannon, chairman), was seeking
to sell its mine in 1875, The “Old Prospectors’ Mine,” was

In August 1875 the monthly escort left Braidwood for
Goulburn having in charge 2470 ozs.. 7 dwts. 2 grns. of
which Braidwood contributed 1811 ozs. 12 dwts. 1 grn.;
Araluen 359 ozs. 10 dwts. 22 grns. The report goes on to
say:
“This is one of the best escorts we have had for many a day,
and no doubt the washing up of some of the sluicing claims upon
the Shoalhaven has had a good deal to do with it.”*
In 1878 the whole frontage to the creek at Tirranna was
pegged out, forty claims and sixty miners in all. “The rate
at which gold is got affords wages.” Hopes were enter-
tained that greater finds would be made. An advertisement
addressed to “Capitalists, Companies, Speculators and
others” offered additional lands on the “Tirranna Gold
Fields which were described as yielding “everywhere a
penny-weight to the dish.f
Goulburn was a happy hunting ground for the Wild
Cat promoter in the eighties. The following are some of
the flotations and syndicates noticed. The Berrima Coal
Mining and Railway Company Ltd. was largely a Goulburn
concern; Wm. Davies was its chairman. Its £12,000 share
capital was mostly subscribed here. The Currawang Copper
Mine was also owned by a Goulburn syndicate. J. W.
Wombey was its chairman. Its second balance sheet shewed
cash returns from copper of £1689/19/6 and a surplus of
£2072/7/10. Coal from the “Goulburn Mine” at Paddy’s
River was exhibited at the A. P. & H. Society’s first Show
in 1881. The monthly gold escort to Sydney was still in
being in 18884
The Mummel Copper mine was being worked in the
eighties. Samples of blue and green carbonates shewed a
return of 35.88% pure copper and the black oxide yielded
28.56%.§ The “Carrington Gold and Silver Mine,” was
situated \\ miles from Goulburn on the road to Marulan.

A. de Lisle Hammond.. It “resumed” work in 1891. The
mine was on the Shoalhaven River/
The Cullulla Lead Mine was worked by a Goulburn
syndicate. S. Meyer was the managing director. The
mine was 32 miles from Goulburn and 8 miles from Windel-
lama. §
In 1892/3 “Goulburn was seriously attacked by the
inventive fever.” It was sought to eliminate the waste in
washing for gold on alluvial diggings. Each of the local
inventors had his machine tested in the public view. As
to their success or otherwise, there are no records. Twelve
years later it was said “It is not known that any single one
of these machines is now in practical use. ’ ’ In the Araluen
and Shoalhaven valleys the treatment of once-washed ground
by these machines showed profitable results. Their real
drawback was their expense, coupled with the lack of gold-
bearing ground with copious water.**
Two years later much space in the local papers was
devoted to the claims of John Jerger’s gold saving invention
and R. T. Ball and Coy’s. “Eclipse” patent gold separator.
Both were Goulburn inventions and both rushed into print

with advertisements, either of testimonials to their value
or hostile reports of their rival.**
As late as 1907 the “Penny Post” referred to 50 or 60
active mining claims in and around Goulburn. Gillett and
party, McMahon, Taunton, Turner and Hanley (the Merrilla
syndicate) were in active work at Merrilla. The “Mare’s
Nest” was described as a “nice show” whilst Nosworthy,
Donnelly, Crouch and “many other minor claims” in the
vicinity were “kept fairly busy in looking for and getting
out lode stuff for the smelters. ’ ’ A large Melbourne syndi-
cate was working the “Sugar Loaf.” Nosworthy’s “Aus-
tral Syndicate” had “a fine chance of a big show.” Iron,
copper and gold mines were working at Breadalbane and
Currawang.* Mining applications were lodged in respect
to the Goulburn racecourse in 1906. It was thought that
there was gold there. Possibly there is but not in payable
quantities.!
Applications were lodged in 1926 for authority to enter
and search for oil in 4000 acres adjoining Goulburn, includ-
ing the Showground site.!
There is some possibility of a revival of mining in this
district. The Australian Iron and Steel Coy. Ltd., is re-
opening iron ore quarries at Crookwell, Jerrawa, Breadal-
bane and Tirranna. Sidings are in course of erection at
Crookwell, Breadalbane and Jerrawa.§

CHAPTER IX.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.*
HERE was a measure of local government at quite
an early stage in the history of New South Wales.
The first act which provided for this upon an elective
basis was the Parish Roads Act of 1840. Under its pro-
visions one-third of the proprietary lands through which, or
within three miles of which, a parish road passed, could
requisition the magistrates in petty sessions for authority
to elect trustees. These trustees were empowered to levy
a rate not exceeding 6d. per acre, to buy, sell or exchange
lands, to appoint surveyors, to establish toll-bars and tolls,
and to let the same on lease for a period not exceeding one
year. Further they were empowered to borrow money for
the purposes of road-making and repairing.!
There were several of these trusts in this district. The
“Bangalore Road Trust” (R. A. Yeeley, Geo. Sykes, and
Jno. Armstrong), the “Currawong and Collector Road
Trustees” and the “When Road Trust” (Pejar. A. S. Pod-
more “a trustee”) were three such.!
Letters patent were issued bearing date the 12/8/1843
incorporating the inhabitants of certain places “to be and
form Districts” under “the Act of the Imperial Parliament,
5 and 6 Victoria” and establishing within such districts a
“Council for the Local Government thereof.” The follow-
ing were named in the Goulburn charter: “Warden: Wm.
Pitt Faithfull; Councillors: J. F. McArthur, John Morphy,
G. C. Curlewis, Francis Murphy, J. R. Styles, W. H. Hoveil,
Ronald Campbell, Wm. Shelley and John Gore.§ The Dis-
trict Council met on the 3/9/1844. It had previously ap-
pointed a clerk at £35 per annum. He was also to act as
surveyor and assessor at £l5O. The Government having
foregone any demand upon the district for its moiety of
Public or Police expenditure it was decided that no rate be
struck and to
“inform those gentlemen who consider themselves employed by

this Council, in any capacity, that no funds are now or likely
to be, at the disposal of the Council to remunerate them...”*
Francis Lewis Robert Rossi, James Kinghorne and John
William Chisholm were appointed councillors on the
18/6/1847.f
This Council is said to have met at the Court House and
the Salutation Inn. It seems to have acted largely in an
advisory capacity. The “Sydney Morning Herald’ ’ re-
ported the need of a bridge at the bad crossing near Thomas’
fence in 1843. It added that the attention of Lieutenant
Gorman would be drawn to it when “he has finished the
one under The crossing would seem to have
been the site of the bridge in Auburn Street South. If so
it did not receive attention until seven years after that.§
C. Meehan writes that there were formerly remains of
an old stone convict built barracks or stores behind the
Chequers Inn, capable of holding 500 tons of goods. He
thinks this may have been in use when the ironed gangs
were forming Goulburn streets.
The “Sydney Morning Herald” noted in 1850 complaints
from inhabitants that, in spite of Goulburn coming within
the “Police Act,” nuisances were on the increase. The
Recreation Ground was still “the receptacle of all filth and
rubbish.” Attention was drawn to a nuisance near the
Hospital and although the boundary under the Police Act
covered the chain of ponds, the slaughter house opposite
the Hospital “still disembogues itself into the principal
pond!” “The Chief Constable is too busy with robberies
to look after the purity of the water holes.”
It went on to say that the inhabitants were sending a
petition to the Legislative Council on the subject of the
“evils arising from proximity of shambles to our town.”||
A further charter was issued on the 16/1/1848. The Bench
of Magistrates apparently continued to function to some
extent as a local governing body. On one occasion it was
authorised to expend £250 on the maintenance of a public
road A* The disgraceful state of the Goulburn streets was
the subject of newspaper comment in 1848.

Public works were sometimes financed by subscription,
as e.g., in 1850 when the public was invited to meet at the
“Salutation Inn” to discuss the erection of a bridge at the
south end of Auburn Street. Further discussion took place
a fortnight later. Finally at an adjourned meeting it was
proposed by Carson, seconded by Simons that a public sub-
scription be launched, the list of subscribers to be kept at
various stores and at O’Sullivan’s bank. A week later the
the plans were exhibited at the “Chequers” Inn. The
Government promised £75, the townsfolk to raise a similar
amount. #
Goulburn began agitating for a municipal council in
1856 on the grounds that “prompt steps must be taken” for
the “curbing” and guttering of the streets. The need was
stressed for sewerage (60 years before it was obtained) and
for a reservoir for clear fresh and cheap water” (30 years
before it was constructed). “Goulburn must agitate for a
Municipal Institution. ”f
Goulburn was first incorporated as a municipality in
1859, one year after the passing of the Municipalities Act of
1858. This was on 4/6/1859. The election of the first
municipal council took place on 21/7/1859. The council
met for the first time in the Court House on 23/7/1859, and
consisted of:
J. J. Woodward, retired publican; J. McGovern, soap manu-
facturer; C. H. Walsh, solicitor; H. Greig, Auctioneer, P. Dig-
nam, storekeeper and auctioneer; W. Davies, storekeeper; D.
Kennedy, plasterer; D. H. Thorn, grazier; H. Chatfield.
C. H. Walsh was elected mayor. N. C. Phillips and G.
Richards were the first auditors; William Dignam was the
first town clerk. The council chambers or town hall were
in Argyle Chambers, Montague Street, premises owned by
Benjamin, a storekeeper, and rented by the council at £1
per week. The council then met at 3 o’clock in the after-
noon. The only other member of the permanent staff was
the works overseer.
The area of the municipality as proclaimed was 8230
acres and its revenue was £1316. The next year, 1860, the

rateable value was £43,000, the revenue £1936, the expendi-
ture £B4O and the number of electors 634. The rate struck
was 6d. in the £. One of the first actions of the municipal
council after its election was to make application
“to the Government to dissolve the District Council of Goul-
burn so far as its jurisdiction affects the Municipality of
Goulburn.”
This was done in the following October.* The first
clerk to the council received £l/10/- per week. A sub-
committee of the council sat daily for some time preparing
the assessments or “taxation papers.” A “treasurer and
town clerk” at £250 per annum was appointed at the end
of 1859.
A town surveyor, William Canson, was appointed in 1860
at a remuneration of 5% on the amount expended in his
office. What is now Belmore Park was then a market place,
vested originally in the Market Commissioners. The coun-
cil asked the Government to dissolve the commission and
transfer “the sole control of the market to the council.”
Three toll bars were erected in this year, one on the Yass
Road, one on the Braidwood Road and one on the Sydney
Road. The drainage, kerbing and guttering of Auburn
Street was estimated to cost £4,000 in 1860. The total esti-
mates amounted to £4,968. At this time it was still undecided
as to whether Auburn Street or Sloane Street was to be
regarded as the main southern road. Later Sloane Street
was so recognised. Five meetings of the council lapsed for
want of a quorum in 1860. In the estimates for 1861 the
town clerk’s salary appears as £IOO and the town surveyor’s
as £l5O. In 1863 the council paid £SO, rent of a room at the
Mechanics’ Institute as a council chamber.!
The newspaper report of the election of a mayor in
1863 is unconsciously funny. Alderman Clark proposed
Alderman Davies as being
“equal in ability to the late Mayor and superior to all the
remaining council members.”
Alderman Fitzpatrick opposed, not the nomination, but
the “eulogy.”!

The work of the council continued to grow and a col-
lector of rates was appointed at a commission of 5% on the
sum collected. The meeting of 16/5/1861 adjourned for
H. Foster’s funeral. Foster was governor of the gaol.
From May to July 1862, no less than ten meetings of the
council lapsed for want of a quorum, and eight from August
to September. The council met on the 19/3/1863 but did
not meet again until 10/2/1868. A paragraph which has
appeared more than once in local newspapers runs:
“Some few years after (i.e., after 1859) owing to some at
present unknown cause, this council ceased to function till late
in the ‘6os.*
That cause is not unknown. It arose out of a law suit,
Munoz v. Davies, in respect to certain overdue rates which
“determined the proclamation of the boundaries of the muni-
cipality to be defective, and municipal government remained in
abeyance until the passing of the Municipalities Act of 1867.” t
The matter is not referred to at all in the council’s
minutes. The case of Munoz v. Davies is described in the
press as a friendly suit instituted at the private expense of
Mayor Davies for the purpose of testing the legality of the
existence of the local municipal council. It was listed before
three judges in the Supreme Court on 31/11/1863. The
actual issue was "to test the legality of a distraint made
under the Municipal Act of 1858.” Isaacs appeared for the
plaintiff, Munoz, and Butler for the defendant, Davies.
Judgment was reserved after counsel for the corporation had
admitted the illegality of imposing and levying costs.l
C. Meehan notes that
“During the years the council was dissolved the leading towns-
men paid for some repair work out of their own pockets, em-
ploying Mr. C. Fitzpatrick as superintendent and overseer with
power to engage labour, etc.”§
Some confusion exists over the proclamation of Goul-
burn as a city. Up till the time of the Diamond Jubilee of
Queen Victoria the title of city was guarded jealously. A
borough did not become a city because of its population,
wealth, statistics or importance. It was a carefully guarded
title conferred only by Royal Letters Patent and then be-
cause it was a see-town of an Anglican Bishop. Goulburn
has the distinction of being the last city in the Empire to

be raised to that rank by virtue of Royal Letters Patent
creating the Bishopric of Goulburn.*
The proclamation of Goulburn as a city on the 20th
March, 1885 under the Crown Lands Act was redundant and
unnecessary.
When the council resumed operations in 1868 it met at
the court house. The council was still trying to obtain
possession of the market place. It appointed a town clerk
at £l2O per annum. It applied for prison labour to break
the metal for the roads. It presented an address to the
Queen “touching the attempt to assassinate the Duke of
Edinburgh.” Improvements to the Market Square, includ-
ing the erection of a weigh bridge, and toll bars and houses,
to cost in all £1640, were authorised in 1868. That year too
a memorial was “got up” for the removal of the gaol and
court house. Subsequently this was amended to refer to
the gaol only.
Finance in 1868 was arranged by the mayor, treasurer
and Alderman Collins discounting “a bill for £BO to meet
current expenses.”
The Goulburn “Herald” in 1868 published an article
“Destruction of Sloane Street by the Government.” It
described how large numbers of telegraph posts had reduced
the pathway to 8 feet instead of 12. Huge logs had been
placed across two-thirds of the carriageway. “Permanent
deep openings dignified by the name of drains” had been
excavated.
“The unified efforts of two departments have constructed a
small artificial lagoon opposite Captain Hovell’s residence and
Mr. Stewart’s coach factory. This keeps the water from the
excavation cutting off the passengers from the railway and will
be most useful for any neighbours rearing ducks.”t
Municipal slaughter yards were proposed in 1868. The
first loan (£5000) was authorised in this year. Joseph White
applied for appointment as city chimney sweep but the ap-
lication was not entertained. Tenders were called for the
construction of Auburn Street from Clinton Street to Clif-
ford Street. Hines and Wilkins’ tender for the erection
of a bridge at the south end of Auburn Street for £2Ol/10/5
* Letters Patent, 14/3/1863; Gazette, 24/3/1864,

was accepted, and H. Mclllhatton’s of £2120/12/- for the
construction of Auburn Street. As early as 17/12/1868 the
council resolved ‘'that the Town Surveyor be now authorised
to employ day labour to carry out, etc., etc.” It would
be interesting to know what lay behind the following ques-
tion and answer:
“By Alderman Clarke: By what authority the Mayor had
written to the Duke of Edinburgh inviting His Royal Highness
to visit Goulburn?”
By the Mayor: No invitation was sent.”
Fines of £25 were inflicted gaily for resignations from
the council and proceedings taken for their recovery. The
mayor (Horn) in 1869 refused to prosecute his predecessor
(Davies) but stated "it was competent for any person to
take action irrespective of the council.”*' The ex-mayor
(Davies) would appear to have been suffering a temporary
eclipse for a later ruling about a foundation stone bearing
his name in the inscription read:
. "That as the Council were in no way identified with the stone,
it follows as a matter of course, they were not bound either to
cherish or guard it.”
Which is all the more remarkable in that only three
months previous an advertisement appeared stating that the
aldermen had subscribed for it "to mark the commencement
of Municipal Works.” It was to be set in Auburn Street.
It was so erected. Various reasons have been advanced for
its demolition and neglect. One version is that "a bullock
team ran against it and levelled it. That was the last of
the monument.”!
Thirty years afterwards an interesting correspondence
was conducted in the "Penny Post” about the Mayor Davies’
memorial stone which at that time way lying in pieces in
the Court House reserve. The originating letter stated that
the stone was first erected where the horse trough now
stands in Montague Street. H. B. Watts wrote that he was
one of the city auditors when the memorial was unveiled
and that there was a luncheon at Mandelson’s hotel. E. R.
Laws also took up the cudgels for the restoration of the
monument. The immediate result was the removal of the
fragments to the Town Hall for preservation.^

On the opening of the railway by Lord and Lady
Belmore the Market Square was renamed Belmore Square.
Lamp posts are first mentioned in the minutes on the
15/7/1869 when tenders were opened for lamp posts (no
number recorded) and glazing and painting 14 lamps. The
first move towards the provision of a town hall was made
in 1869. Nearly 20 years were to elapse before anything
was done. That year (1869) the government offered “to
assign temporarily certain persons now incarcerated in Goul-
burn Gaol to the municipal council for the performance of
certain works in the city.” That year too the council was
requesting ratepayers to remove “verandah and other posts”
from the footpaths. It was nearly 70 years before they were
removed. A circular with the names of the mayor and of
the municipality of Balmain recommending the adoption of
earth closets was read. A clue to this is found in the con-
stantly recurring references to the “emptying of cess-pits,”
the contracts for which ranged from 9d. to 1/3 a foot.
The police district at this time did not include the “old
township.” An interesting return is that of
“Amount paid to the Goulburn Municipality as Endowment by
the Government on amount of rates collected:
Public saleyards were mooted in 1870, also a market
“on the eastern side of Belmore Square,” and a haymarket
upon the Clinton Street allotment. The council paid 8%
on its loans this year.


On the 5/5/1870 the mayor suspended the town clerk
and demanded his keys. The town clerk in his turn asked
for his suspension in writing. Whilst the mayor was writing
it, he walked out of the office with the keys “leaving the
councirs property unprotected.” Lane brought an action
for wrongful dismissal. On 3/6/1871 £IOO was voted to
the mayor and treasurer for “defending the forthcoming
case.” In the end Lane obtained a verdict against the
mayor and aldermen for £lB/6/3. The corporation had to
pay the plaintiff’s costs. Two pages of the minute book
are taken up with a post-mortem of the case. Toll gates
were the subject of some correspondence in 1870/1. The
council desired to erect toll gates at Towrang and on the
Collector road. A. Evans offered to pay the council £6OO
per annum for the privilege of placing toll gates on the
Braidwood and Wheeo roads. “Rates to be levied same as
government rates.” This year another move was made
towards a town hall which it was then intended to build in
Belmore Square. A motion that
“Taking the present state of the indebtedness of the Muni-
cipality into consideration they cannot afford, and ought not to
give, more than thirty shillings to any person who shall act as
auditor. ...”
was lost. As late as 1872 the council received an offer of
£5 per annum for grazing two horses in Belmore Square.
Despite petitions of protest (including one “from 51 ladies”)
it was still contemplating the erection of a market and
weighbridge here. In 1873 seven meetings were held to
elect a mayor. It was two months before the deadlock was
overcome.
Victoria Park, previously a “reserved square” was set
apart for purposes of public recreation in 1873. Some
members of the council attended the public funeral of W. C.
Wentworth and applied for a “free passage by railway
train. ’’ Application was made to the government this year
for a site for a town hall. A piece of land adjoining the
Mechanics’ Institute was so dedicated.
An advertisement appeared in the “Penny Post” in
1873 addressed:
“To the Coloured Gentleman of Marsden’s Alley”
inviting him to nominate for an aldermanic vacancy in the
centre ward. It was stated that he was ‘ ‘ the best man in


the ‘ole Township” and was signed: “Mrs. Shape, Mrs.
Gunn, Mrs. Pocock, Mrs. Priggs, Mrs. Chuckem” and 60
others. The reference is not clear. # Another half column
advertisement announced that at the “Royal City Theatre”
there would be “feats of legerdemain” such as “balancing a
donkey on the top of a chair.” This was evidently an
allusion to the mayoral election, especially the last line
“Exeunt omnes thoroughly disgusted.” It purported to be
signed by George Richards, f Other ribald verses and com-
ments appeared for some weeks.
The Colonial Astronomer was “allowed to erect a fence
in Belmore Square to observe the transit of Venus” in 1874.
The next year the gaol was furnishing prison labour to the
council. The council promoted a “Cattle Sale Yards Bill”
in Parliament. It accepted Jobson’s tender for building
the yards on 22/7/1875. No figure is mentioned in the
minutes but a “very large and influential” meeting, the
audience of which was described as “a very respectable
one,” carried on 28/7/1875 a resolution deprecating “the
proposed erection of cattle yards and the expenditure by the
civic council of one thousand pounds thereon. * ’ A petition
signed by 121 persons was presented to the council at its
next meeting. This the council rejected.§
W. Davies was elected mayor but on 9/3/1876 the Full
Court granted a rule nisi for an order under the 99th section
of the Municipalities Act of 1867, to oust him from his
office on the ground that one of his nominators was in
arrears with his rates at the time of his nomination.
The action was initiated by Alderman Ball who, incidentally,
had to meet his own costs. His action, judging from the
correspondence in the local press, was not popular. Later
in the year Davies was re-elected. ||
There would seem to be a good deal of childish pique
manifesting itself about this time. Several meetings of the
council lapsed because Aldermen Byrne and O’Brien quar-
relled as to where they should sit at the council table. This
finished up with a free fight in the council chamber. A
police court prosecution followed for assault. In this

Harold O’Brien was the plaintiff and John Byrne the de-
fendant. Byrne was fined 20/- and costs of court. Pro-
fessional costs were disallowed. #
Negotiations were begun in 1876 for an exchange of
sites, the fire station allotment to be used for a new town
hall, the telegraph offices in Montague Street for the fire
station. An architect was commissioned to design a new
town hall to cost £SOO. The council moved to rooms at the
Joint Stock Bank this year. The first mov§ or enquiry in
the matter of lighting the city with gas was made this year.
The council was paying 8% on its loan from the Joint
Stock Bank.f
The fencing and laying out of Victoria Park “the Re-
creation ground west of the City” or the “West Goulburn
Recreation Ground” as it was variously called, occupied
the attention of the council in 1877. Application was made
to the government for “the erection of a dead-house with
court-room. ” The exchange of sites between the telegraph
office and fire station to provide a site for a town hall was
completed this year. On the 11/6/1878 a motion of censure
was moved on the mayor. The mayor refused to put it to
the council and “the council then dissolved.” The dispute
went on for some time.
The Auburn Street bridge near the mill in 1878 was a
wooden super-structure upon brick and stone piers and
totally inadequate. It was decided to rebuild it with brick
arches on stone piers. The council offered £5 for the best
plan 4 Few people who pass along Auburn Street at this
point realise that it is carried here on a large bridge. Its
extent can be seen from the yard of the power house.
Goulburn streets were first lit by gas on the 1/11/1879.
Wm. Davies, previously Mayor of Goulburn, and then chair-
man of the Gas Company, lit the first lamp in Belmore
Square.
In 1880 the council estimated its receipts at £4795 and
its expenditure at £22,920. A loan was planned for the
balance. Alderman Martin moved, Alderman Osborne
seconded a motion “that upon going into the new Municipal

Council Chambers a suitable chain of office be purchased for
the Mayor. ” The motion was carried, but the chain was
not bought. The “new” premises were in Market Street.
The council presented an address to Lord and Lady
Loftus on 24/9/1880. The council “cordially approved”
of the N.S.W. and Victorian postal regulations prohibiting
the despatch of mail from Sydney and Melbourne on Sun-
days and declined to unite with any committee working for
the despatch of mail trains on Sundays.
In 1881 the municipal council sought “immediate au-
thority” to erect a temporary small-pox hospital at a cost
of £SOO and elected a committee to carry out the work.
There is no record of this having been done. From then
until 1883 there are references to the possibility of the small-
pox epidemic reaching Goulburn and the steps which ought
to be taken to prepare for it.
The council made arrangements for an address, a ban-
quet, “suitable carriages” and a procession on the occasion
of the visit of “certain ministers to open Public Buildings.”
Later the decision to expend £3O on these functions was
“expunged” from the minutes. The Minister was the Post-

The foundation stone of the Auburn Street bridge was laid
by the mayor, Z. Hawkins, on 28/2/1882. * In 1882 the
council was concerning itself with traffic problems although
a motion to hang out signboards “walk round corners” was
defeated. That same year it decided not to present an
address to Sir Henry Parkes. Licenses issued by the coun-
cil in 1883 included 7 vehicles, 4 carters, 14 hawkers, 3 water-
carts, and one shooting gallery. An address was presented
to Lord Loftus in 1883.
The council lost the case Moran v. Council and paid
£34/9/6 verdict and costs. The case concerned a claim for
extras in the construction of the Combermere Street bridge.
The first judgment was for £l7/7/2. An appeal was au-
thorised.
Many issues of the Goulburn newspapers in 1882 were
devoted to protests against the extraordinary practice of
dumping the night soil on the North Goulburn recreational

reserve. Some of the protests were really humourous, es-
pecially one which suggested a municipal picnic on the
ground “when all nature is wrapped in odiferous repose.”*
Unemployment and relief problems appear in the municipal
records and correspondence for the first time in 1884. That
year the Gas Coy. offered its undertaking to the Council
but the offer was not accepted.
The council cabled to H. M. Queen Victoria upon “the
death of General Chas. Gordon” which “sad loss they con-
sidered is attributable to the vacillation of Her Majesty’s
advisers.” The cable was directed “to be forwarded on
Monday unless contradicted.” Cab stands were approved
“on each side of Auburn Street opposite Belmore Square and
Clinton Street near Hayes’ Mill, Bradley Street near the
Exchange Hotel, railway station between the north and
south gates.” The city solicitors had to tell the council
it had no power to stop traction engines using the streets.
A reception to the “Goulburn portion of the Contingent”
(Sudan) was authorised. The town hall project was mooted
again in 1885. The working overseer reported that C.
Walker’s traction engine had done great damage to 17 six-
teen inch pipes and 1 sixteen inch junction at the inter-
section of Bradley and Bourke Streets. The council decided
to abolish cess pits and substitute a dry earth closet system in
1882. The working overseer’s report on street lighting
stated:
“the lamps are in such a disgraceful state of dirt, whether lit
or not at night a person could scarcely te11. ,,
In 1886 the council was contemplating purchasing the
Protestant Hall for £4500 for use as a town hall. The
Inspector of Nuisances reported:
“the tank of the old night cart is in a very unsafe condition,
the iron of the tank having become so thin as to render it liable
to burst at any time.”
The mayor and aldermen were invited to the unveiling
of the temperance fountain in Belmore Square.
The council presented an address to the governor, Lord
Carrington, on 25/3/1887. The fiend who poisons dogs
made his appearance in 1887 when the council offered £lO
for information leading to his arrest. When a meeting of

the municipal council in 1887 lapsed for want of a quorum
the “Southern Argus” suggested unkindly that “the de-
faulting aldermen became bogged in the numerous swamps
and quagmires” in the city streets. #
E. C. Manfred was asked to supply sketches of a new
town hall. Debentures for £IO,OOO were signed and issued,
to finance the project. After some delay and correspond-
ence Manfred’s design No. 9 was accepted. Some opposition
was encountered. Petitions against any town hall at all
were presented. The petitions were rejected. Further
petitions were received and refused. Finally Wm. Wilkie’s
tender for £3425/3/5 was accepted. A public meeting was
convened to arrange for the celebrations for the Queen’s
Jubilee. One Oeech gave “an engrossed copy of address
to the Queen, free of charge.” The council protested to the
Colonial Secretary in 1888 at the number of public holidays
gazetted. A curious resolution of the municipal council
was:
“That application of F. W. Bailey and others for permission
to sell fireworks after dark be granted from date (10/5/1888)
until the 25th inst. inclusive.”
The following reference is made to the town hall in the
minutes:
“The Town Hall was opened on Tuesday, January Bth, 1889.
H. S. Gannon was Mayor. J. J. Richardson, Mayor.
Entered by request as reference on the 3rd July 1897. H.
Cotterell, Town Clerk.”
Which seems somewhat belated, as the foundation stone
of the Town Hall was laid by the mayor (Tait) in the
presence of the Governor on the 19/12/1887 and it was
opened by the mayor (H. S. Gannon) at a gathering of 200
citizens on the 8/1/1889. f
After the improvements of Victoria Park were com-
pleted it was found that the gates did not permit of the
“ingress and egress of perambulators.” The matter was
adjusted at a cost of £lO.
Sometimes the pages of the municipal minutes glow with
epic English. The nuisance inspector’s description of the col-
lapse of a night cart and of his and the working overseer’s

efforts with the fire hose in the eerie dawn to restore the
“status quo ante” is a masterpiece of restrained emotion,
even to his casual reference to the spoiling of two suits of
clothes.
Reporting the result of a municipal election in 1888 the
“Penny Post” said:
“The cocky little speeches by the aldermen who on Tuesday last
were declared duly elected were more amusing than edifying. ,, t
There was a breeze in 1889 over £9/9/- being spent on
the Mayoral chair while those for the Aldermen cost only
£l/10/- each. Once again the “Penny Post” burst into
verse:
“ we must treasure it long as a worthy prize
On account of its cost, on account of its size,
Its bound by two hundred bob to our hearts ”1
In the eighties the Municipal Council was still receiving
a subsidy from the Government. It was round about £I6OO
per annum. For some reason or other the Town Clerk
neglected to render the necessary returns and for three years
it went uncollected. Later two years ’ subsidy was re-
covered^
Arising out of this and other neglect in 1889 the council
called in Geo. Christie, public accountant, to report upon the
counciPs system of book-keeping and administration
generally. He found £7627/18/10 arrears of rates unpaid,
extending over 11| years. Some criticism of the cost of the
investigation was made in that he brought six clerks with
him. Christie brought forward figures to shew that the
cost of the investigation and audit would be less by £425
if he employed six people than if he employed two! His
final report was a lengthy document, the chief recommenda-
tion of which was the provision of adequate clerical
assistance for the Town Clerk.
There were several repercussions. After some shilly-
shallying, J. B. Salmon, the town clerk, who was then over
60, lost his position, and Forsyth was appointed in his place.
The “Penny Post” called it a “muddled meeting.”*

Another outcome of Christie’s audit was a series of pub-
lic meetings to protest against the Council's attempting to
recover 11 and 12 years’ arrears of rates. Some compromises
were arranged.!
The next year an attempt was made to obtain from the
Government a grant of £2500 to construct an artificial lake
and other works in Victoria Park. The indebtedness of
the Council at 3/2/1890 was £10,617/1/2 plus "a rough esti-
mate of expenditure on the water works, £60,000.”
A Mayoral allowance was refused when first proposed
in 1890, but was granted a fortnight later. That year East-
grove, dissatisfied with its treatment by the municipal coun-
cil held a meeting on the 26/11/1890, for the purpose of
forming a municipality of its own.!
A set of verses in the “Penny Post” in 1891 included
a tilt at the council:
“The Aldermen will talk and talk
(No Mayor can Mac. or Howard balk)
And citizens through mud will walk
In 1891.”
A little later it published an illustration (accompanied
by the usual topical verse) of two men, with a rope, hoisting
a third out of the quagmire of the Goulburn streets. §
Much time and heat was wasted in 1891 over a proposal
that the municipality should purchase the gas works for
£20,000. Nothing came of the idea.||
Further public meetings protesting against the Goulburn
Water Supply Charges Bill, and the proposal to purchase
the gas works were held in 1892.*
The municipal council decided in 1892 to appoint a
“Transit Inspector,” to inspect cabs, horses, harness and
cabbies. A public outcry resulted and the council rescinded
its decision. In the meantime 84 persons applied for the
job.**

The “Penny Post’’ was unusually facetious about the
municipal elections of 1892. It likened them to a race meet-
ing when “four events will be decided, the North Plate, the
Centre Cup, the East Stakes and the Gas Gallop/ ’ (At that
time the municipality was divided into three wards and the
purchase of the gas works was a “burning” question.)
Zachariah Hawkins was described as “Old Zac,” by Meth-
uselah out of a Pyramids mare,” “Chaffey Patt” was
Patrick McShane, by “Old Spring Valley from Argyle,”
whilst the third horse “Bucra” (Buck) was catalogued as
“aged, by Contractor from Loquacity,” “With a strain of
a well known Sheep Drench blood in him.” Albert Lans-
downe was described as “Codlin Moth, by Seedsman from
Platitude,” John Knowlman appeared as “Bags, by Calico
out of Corner.” J. W. Magraw was unkindly indicated as
“Brickbat, by Water Bottle out of Local Option,” Isaac
Bushell was still more unkindly described as “IkyMo, by
Eastgrove Bog out of Heaps of Mud.” Elections must have
been interesting 50 years ago 4
T. S. Bussell was appointed “Bailiff for the Council”
and “authorised to make levies and distress under warrant”
for all arrears of rates.§ Motions in 1892 for the erection
of a cabman’s shelter and bandstand in Belmore Park were
defeated. The financial stringency of the depression is
evident in the number of distraints for rates and in the
reduction by the municipal council of all salaries under £IOO
per annum by 5% and of all above £IOO per annum by 10%.
A new municipal by-law prohibiting drivers of vehicles
cracking their whips in any public place was enacted in
1894. A further measure of retrenchment and reduction
of salaries was necessary in 1895.
Unemployment and relief work are referred to fre-
quently in the 1895 minutes. Improvements to Belmore
Park were amongst the relief measures. An annual allow-
ance to the mayor was approved at a public meeting of
ratepayers on 7/8/1895.*
The municipal council came in for some pungent
criticism, not only in the local press but in the metropolitan
t “E.P.P.,” 4/4/1892.

newspapers also, when it carried a resolution in 1895 against
the proposed land tax. Letters appeared describing the
Council as “base and contemptible.” “Tories to the back-
ground” and “ostentatiously holding and expressing
opinions” contrary to that of the electorate. The council
expended £471 in relief work from 1/10/1895 to 30/4/1896,
towards which the government contributed £IOO.
In 1896 the council was interesting itself in the founda-
tion of chilling and refrigerating works. In 1897 it raised
the question of municipal abbatoirs.
The Goulburn “Herald” had a heavy humour in the
nineties. It reported a municipal council meeting:
“Ye Council sitteth long and short work is made of ye Govern-
ment demand for cash—Ye council refuseth to shell out and in
effect telleth ye government to goe to Halifax/M
Apparently the water works instalment was in arrears.
The council applied for a government grant of £3OO to
assist in celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.
The request was refused. The celebrations took the form
of a “Gigantic picnic” to the combined schools of the city,
to which the council contributed £lO.
Considerable opposition to the proposed abbatoirs was
met with in 1897. On one occasion the town hall was invaded
and Alderman’s Ayling’s copy of the plans of the Melbourne
abbatoirs was destroyed. By five votes to two the council
decided not to consider Alderman’s Ayling’s complaint
which suggests that someone knew where the plans had gone.
That the aldermen took their duties seriously is revealed
by an advertisement calling upon all “cabmen and others”
to “muster in front of the Town Hall for inspection by
the aldermen.”*
The question cropped up again in 1898 of “the disposal
of the memorial formerly erected to commemorate the re-
incorporation of the Borough of Goulburn in 1868, engraved
with the name of Wm. Davies, Mayor” and this time it was
referred to the works committee for report. The next meet-
ing decided to re-erect the stone and also fixed the site of
the Hollis Memorial Fountain. The fountain was handed
over in February 1899.

The council joined in a petition to the government for
municipalities to be permitted to “open and conduct offices
for insurance of the property of ratepayers.” The council
bluffed for month after month over the payment of £2/10/-
exchange on a cheque for £I9BB paid to the treasury for
interest etc., on the water works loan. When the Treasury
wrote that unless the amount was forthcoming immediately
action would be taken to recover it, the council as usual
directed that the letter should “lie on the table.” The
Market Square was re-dedicated as “botanic gardens” in
1899.
There was a case of plague in Goulburn in 1900 and the
mayor was complimented by the council on his action in
chartering a special train to convey the patient to Sydney,
the railway charged 5/- a mile, £33/10/-, which the Depart-
ment of Health refunded. The bubonic plague scare in 1900
had one good result. The city was cleaned thoroughly, all
rubbish burnt and rats destroyed. Considerable space was
devoted to these doings in the press. Even the furnace at
the waterworks was requistioned.j:
R. J. McLean, the present Town Clerk was appointed
“junior clerk and rate collector” in 1900. The council
contributed £lO towards the “inauguration picnic” to the
children which was Goulburn’s way of commemorating the
founding of the Commonwealth. A government grant was
refused. Council congratulated Lord Hopetoun on his ap-
pointment as Governor-General.
The municipal council protested to the Colonial Secre-
tary in 1900 “against the action of the military authorities
in vetoing the programme of shooting competitions sent by
the Goulburn committee.” A special meeting of the council
was held to threaten Chas. Rogers with an “injunction in
the Court of Equity” should he interfere with two trees
growing in Montague Street. Nevertheless he removed the
trees and the council decided to prosecute him. The council
accepted £lO “without prejudice” for the damage done by
him to the trees in Montague Street. The new Lansdowne
Bridge was erected by the Public Works Department. Chas.
Rogers, after his fight with the municipal council over the

trees and before the same were removed, hung two notices
on them, both somewhat insulting to the municipal council,
one read: ‘ ‘ This notorious tree has been purchased by
Charles Rogers from the Goulburn Council for the sum of
£5 not for £IOO as previously valued by an incompetent valu-
ator. What bunkum!” The mayor ordered the removal
of the offending notices. The “Werriwa Times” published
a column of humorous comment on the incident entitled
“The Cuckoo Club,” by “Lyre.”*
The mayor, John Knowlman, organised a garden fete
in Belmore Park to supplement the £l3O which was all the
municipal council could afford for its improvement and main-
tenance. The proceeds amounted to £2B/14/-. f
In the margin of the municipal council’s minute book
for the years 1901 and 1906 there are pasted copies of the
council’s addresses to Lord Carrington in March 1887, the
Earl of Jersey in January 1891, to Earl Beauchamp in Sep-
tember 1900, and Sir Harry Rawson on 28/4/1903.
The council protested in 1901 against the labour bureau
bringing Sydney unemployed to work on the main southern
road when there were so many unemployed in Goulburn.
The protest was successful, 50% of the local unemployed
were given work.
The next year the council was chivalrous when it
granted the free use of the town hall, two afternoons a
quarter, to the Women’s Suffrage League. The Anti-War
League forwarded a petition to the council for signature but
‘ ‘ the same was returned to the sender. ’ ’ On the other hand
it decided “it had no intention of presenting an address on
the occasion of the coronation of King Edward VII.” When
the coronation was postponed on account of the illness of the
King, the council adjourned to attend an intercessory service
at St. Saviour’s Cathedral.
A. N. Turner, cab-driver, obtained a verdict of £3OO and
costs ((somewhere about £IOOO in all) against the council
in 1903. The case arose out of an accident on the saleyards

bridge. Much criticism of the council's handling of this
matter was forthcoming.*
As an experiment, Auburn Street was oiled with crude
petroleum, presumably this was to overcome the dust nui-
sance, but the press report does not say so.f
Anent the Municipal seal in 1903 the “ Penny Post"
said:
“The Council wants a seal, they say
Of true official size, sir,
Of nobby cut and neat design
To please discerning eyes, sir.
But what is the design to be—
-0 tell us, Arthur Barrett:
Would you suggest, for East Ward's pride,
A 'possum or a parrot?
“The Council has a name achieved—
We cannot put it shorter—
For piling up the overdraft
And selling muddy water.
Then let us have upon our seal
If truth we wish to credit,
The picture of a muddy pool,
The figures of our debit."!
The municipal council was placed in a quandary when
the first application for a license for a motor car to carry
passengers was made. The by-laws provided that any
vehicle plying for hire must be licensed. On the other hand
they provided that such vehicles should be drawn by “one
or more horses." The by-law was amended on 24/10/1904,
prohibiting any motor proceeding within the municipality at
a pace faster than eight miles an hour.§
The “Goulburn Tree Planting Association" was formed
at a public meeting held in the town hall on 7/8/1905, the
mayor presiding. The object was to co-operate with the
council in the planting of trees in the streets. Alderman
Roberts succinctly summarised a debate of the council on
10/1/1907 as “mag- mag- mag."||
The Gloulburn “Penny Post" had a habit of bursting
into verse, especially on municipal topics. Upon the re-
election of Alderman Beegling as mayor in 1907 it wrote:
* “E.P.P.,” 4/4/1903; Gbn. “Herald,” 5/10/1903.

“Our rates will soon be all reduced
Our pockets then will swell,
Electric light will shine at night,
Free drinks supplied as well.
The rec. will be a lovely spot
With shrubs and shady trees.
The band will play there every night
While people take their ease
Now that Beegling is the mayor.
The first move towards the abolition of the ward system
was made in 1907. A little later the council petitioned the
government for the abolition of the wards and for the in-
clusion of Kenmore within the municipal boundaries and
against the revocation of the town common.
In 1908 when the Carruthers Local Government Act was
passed, levying the rating on the unimproved capital value,
that U.C.V. was £450,299, the I.C.V. £1,298,782, and the
A.R.Y. £78,394. In 1908 the council asked the government
to inspect the Springfield, Wollorogang, Lockyersleigh and
Fullerton estates with a view to their resumption for closer
settlement. The council petitioned the government for the
licensing and registration of all motor cars, the number
plates of which, it desired, should carry 12 inch numerals
The council gave permission for a public meeting to be held
in the town hall to protest against the counciFs own sanitary
charges, but would not allow the mayor to preside. There
were 270 signatures to the requisition calling the meeting
and 150 present at it. Considerable indignation and some
hilarity prevailed as when one speaker advocated the forma-
tion of a “night pan party.” The choicest of the humour
was evidently censored. #
The “Union of Eastgrove and the Bungonia Road” was
celebrated with a public function and a tree-planting cere-
mony on the 8/8/1908. Previously Eastgrove had no outlet
to the south.f
H. C. Cox resigned as town clerk in 1909, and R. J.
McLean was appointed. The “National” bridges within
the municipality were defined this year as Fitzroy, Kenmore,
Marsden’s, Lansdowne, Rossiville and Thorn. The council

initiated the movement for the Knowlman memorial in Bel-
more Park, which was built at a cost of £227/10/-. A
motion to urge Parliament to make a grant towards a central
crematorium for N.S.W. was lost on the casting vote of the
mayor.
The council was surcharged £l/13/- by the “Examiner
of Accounts for sending a wreath to Alderman Knowlman's
funeral.
Plans for a cabman's shelter were approved in 1910;
(Ibbotson's tender for £47/10/- was accepted). In 1911 it
was the custom to sweep Auburn Street late on Saturday
night. The cleaners asked permission to do this on Sunday
morning in lieu; the council gave permission but was much
criticised in consequence.
The council contributed £5 towards the cost of fighting
the “Engine Drivers' and Firemen's" claims in 1912. Plans
for an up-to-date theatre at the town hall were prepared in
1912. The council refused on the casting vote of the mayor
(J. Turner) to accord the Hon. Andrew Fisher, Prime Minis-
ter, a civic reception. Apparently the decision was made
on political grounds. The Goulburn Political Labour League
described the action as “ discourteous. "J
The council contributed £2/2/- towards combating the
Caretakers and Cleaners Award in 1913. The council made
a grant of £3O to Graham Wilson for his booklet “Goulburn
and the Southern Highlands" and received 1000 copies for
distribution. The council sought power under Section 109
(ii) of the L.G. Act to “advertise the area for the purpose
of settlement or touring," and this was granted. Another
move in the matter of a new or an enlarged town hall was
made in 1915. The municipal council's minute book in 1915
records dozens of letters from various municipalities and
shires calling upon the government to intern German, Aus-
trian and Turkish subjects, to strike such off the roll of
Justices of the Peace, and suggesting the non-employment of
enemy-born. The council expressed approval of the objects
of the “Manly Anti-German League" in 1915. The council
co-operated with the Berrigan shire in “deploring the action
♦ 25/4/1911, 22/8/1912, 26/9/1912, 24/4/1913, 6/5/1913,


of the government in offering and certain Members of Par-
liament in accepting expenses whilst speaking in connection
with the recruiting campaign.”
The council pledged itself to support and work for the
Government Referendum proposals. It co-operated in a
petition advocating decimal coinage and the metric system
of weights and measures.
The Railways Institute wrote asking permission to hold
a boxing exhibition. The municipal council disapproved
of “boxing exhibitions for the purpose of raising funds for
any purpose whatsoever.” A lot of time was taken up in
1918/9 with the proposals of “The Memorial Hall Commit-
tee” which proposed the erection of a hall in Belmore Square
at the lower end of Montague Street. The project was
vetoed.
The first proposal to erect a new town hall in 1920 at
a cost of £12,000 was referred to a poll of ratepayers and
carried by a majority of 30 only.
Another dispute between the municipal council and a
ratepayer over the removal of a tree took place in 1922.
F. G. Cox of Hurst Street was prosecuted for poisoning the
tree. When the council’s sub-committee went round to
inspect Cox became abusive and something of a free fight
occurred in which the town clerk (McLean) knocked him
down.*
The City streets came in for some criticism in 1921.
Two stanzas from the “Penny Post” read:
“Oh driver, I see a gleaming light,
Oh say what may it be?”
“Its the lantern carried by some poor wight
A-crossing the Clinton Street sea.”
“Oh driver I hear a terrible yell,
Oh say, what may it be?”
“Its the curses hurled in this muddy hell
And he steered for hot toast and tea.”t
The council bought a new tar-sprayer in 1923. No
one knew how to use it. The “Penny Post” recorded:
* “E.P.P.,” 17/1/1922, 24/1/1922, 11/2/1922,
f “E.P.P.,” 18/6/1921.


“At 11.20 a.m. a stream of boiling tar issued from the hose
but the spray was nothing to write about. Two seconds later
the main body of the tar rose through the top of the tank, burst
into flames and cascaded gracefully over the vehicle. The old
horse woke up, looked round and yelled for assistance while 150
gallons of perfectly good tar went off in smoke or ran gaily
down the gutter.” t
From 1920 onwards various attempts were made to en-
large the town hall. The procrastination was referred to
in an illustrated article in the "Commonwealth Home” in
1926. §
The council interested itself in the matter of university
extension to country districts in 1923/4. Proposals were
first brought forward in 1924 for the drainage of the lagoon,
an area of 7| acres, bounded by Citizen, Auburn, Brownhill
and Bishop Streets. The new saleyards were authorised
at a cost of £10,500. All these projects were advanced a
stage and permission obtained to sell the old sale yards, the
proceeds to be applied in reduction of the debt on the new.
The Valuer-General was appointed valuer to the municipility
this year.
A somewhat stormy meeting was held on 28/1/1926
when, on the subject of the town hall extensions, one
alderman accused the mayor of "bribery and corruption”
and a fellow-alderman of "nepotism.” Considerable criti-
cism was forthcoming from ratepayers upon the 1925
proposal to spend £16,000 on town hall extensions. The
matter was referred to a poll of ratepayers and defeated.
In 1925 the council constructed some garden plots in
the middle of Auburn Street. They caused considerable
discussion, some ratepayers asking for their extension, others
for their removal. They were finally removed in 1939. A
blasting accident occurred at the North Goulburn gravel
pit on 10/10/1925. Ganger Charles Wilson w r as injured
seriously.
The cabmen’s shelter and the bird-cage were removed
from Belmore Park in 1926. The municipal council won
second prize in the "Daily Telegraph” Road Sign Competi-
tion. The prize money, £ls, was devoted to the erection

of 1927. The estimated cost was £27,555. A poll of rate-
payers was held on 19/11/1927 when the proposal was
defeated by 405 votes to 91. The battle over the removal
of the verandah posts and balconies in Auburn Street began
in 1927. It was some years before they all disappeared.
Nine hundred and forty-six ratepayers petitioned for a
poll on the subject of a proposed loan of £24,000 to recondi-
tion the streets. The proposal was defeated by 560 votes
to 166. The council considered a scheme in 1928 for the sub-
division of the square blocks and the formation of a new
street between and parallel to Auburn and Bourke Streets.
The discussions were protracted, heated and disorderly. For
various reasons, including the costs of resumption, the matter
was not considered practicable. Nevertheless the tendency
is for the backs of Auburn Street to deteriorate and some-
thing approaching slum conditions to arise. The total cost
of the scheme would have been £55,000.
The first of the government loans to provide work for
the unemployed was granted in 1929, £3OOO for 12 years,
the first two years to be free of interest. Work for the
unemployed occupied the counciFs attention all through the
year 1930. Further substantial grants were received from
the government. There were 487 married unemployed on
the counciFs roll at Christmas. The total indebtedness of
the municipality at 11/6/1931 was £333,199/16/6. The
annual repayments of principal and interest at that time
were £22,434. The council requested the Commonwealth
Government to declare the Communist party an illegal or-
ganisation. The council subsidised, to the extent of £IOO, a
milk depot for the children of the unemployed in 1933. The
government granted a similar amount. A council meeting
on the 12/1/1933 was most disorderly. Alderman Steele
punched Alderman Turnbull several times and at a later
stage the mayor had to adjourn the proceedings.*
The oval in Victoria Park was constructed under the
unemployment relief schemes in 1933/4. A tourist com-
mittee was planned in 1933. A booklet advertising the
city and district was issued in conjunction with the Chamber
of Commerce. The Department of Labour and Industry
forwarded in 1933, 500 garments for the unemployed. These

were distributed by the health officer in conjunction with the
city’s charitable organisations.
The Mayor, Alderman T. P. Manion, protested vigorously
against the strictures on Goulburn and its hotels, which ap-
peared in 1934, in R. H. Milford’s “Australia’s Backyards.”f
The Local Government Conference was held in Goulburn
in 1934, and was addressed by the Minister for Local Govern-
ment, E. S. Spooner, j: H. C. Manfred was asked to prepare
plans for the Town Hall extension in 1935. The plans were
approved.
The council co-operated with the State Tree-planting
Committee in planting trees on the Hume Highway in Com-
memoration of the Silver Jubilee of King George V. A
tree was also planted in Belmore Park. Final notices for
the removal of the remaining balconies in Auburn Street
were given this year.
The council initiated an annual Home Gardens’ Com-
petition in 1936. It undertook the drainage of the “Lagoon”
at an estimated cost of £5870. A large number of works
to relieve unemployment was undertaken under the grant-
cum-loan (Spooner) scheme.
The concreting of Auburn Street was first proposed in
1936. That year too the council co-operated in the Diphtheria
Immunisation Scheme. The council submitted three schemes
for the re-surfacing of Auburn Street to the ratepayers by
referendum. The ratepayers on this occasion turned down
the concreting proposals in favour of bitumen.
The oval in Victoria Park was completed in 1936 under
the unemployment scheme at a cost of £11,453. The High
School oval cost £4614. £1557 was expended on Manfred
Park.
In 1937 £60,000 odd was expended under the grant-cum-
loan scheme, £37,570 on the water works, £7300 on the Clin-
ton Street drain and Tully Park improvements, and £15,465
on paving, kerbing, guttering and road works.

1937 in memory of his wife.

A further poll of ratepayers on the subject of the con-
creting of Auburn Street was demanded in 1937 by 779
citizens. The poll resulted in approval for the concreting
of Auburn Street 48ft. wide with side strips of bitumen 12ft.
wide, and a loan of £11,500 for the purpose.
The Auburn Street re-construction was undertaken by
the Main Roads Board in 1938/9 at a cost of £17,000 of which
the municipal council's share was £13,000. In 1939 the
council prepared an elaborate programme of works to absorb
the unemployed. As first drafted, these included £IO,OOO
for new baths, and £15,000 for a scenic drive and motor
racing circuit, and other works totalling £11,672. The
collapse of the “Spooner” scheme for financing works by
grants-cum-loans resulted in its abandonment.*
On the 7/12/1939, the city council, subject to obtaining
a Government indemnity against losses, decided to under-
take a housing scheme. Under this scheme 50 “cheap
rental” cottages were contemplated at an estimated cost of
£32,500. This decision was the outcome of discussions with
the St. Saviour’s Cathedral branch of the Young Anglicans
and the Housing Board. No action was taken, f
A short-lived scheme for the extension of the town hall
was mooted in 1941. It provided for showrooms for the
electricity undertaking and other offices. One scheme con-
templated shop windows on the facade. The architect was
D. Gillespie of Sydney. A public meeting of citizens on
the 1/5/1941 protested against that particular feature.
Finally the Federal Treasurer vetoed the expenditure, t
The names of the Mayors of Goulburn are inscribed on

The Water Supply.
Goulburn’s first water supply was obtained from Black-
shaw’s pumps, two wells on the Eastgrove flats. The water
was taken into town by licensed watermen and sold at 9d.
a cask. The wells were sunk by Zachariah Hawkins. A
public meeting was held in 1856 at Woodward’s Commercial
Hotel to consider the erection of a pump on the banks of
the Mulwaree “for free use and for fire purposes.” Nothing
was done. The railway cut off access to Blackshaw’s pumps
and the municipality enquired from the government:
“What provision had been made.... for supplying the Borough
with water, only one very inconvenient crossing (over the rail-
way) having been left.”
A dam and reservoir in Auburn Street (the Drill Hall
site) was proposed.*
From 1869 to 1875 various schemes for a water supply
were considered. These included Thorn’s water hole, a
“tube well’ on the Clinton Street allotment (the power
house site), another “contiguous to Bradley’s 100 acres on
the Bungonia Road” and a well, place unspecified, with a
force pump and a 20,000 gallon tank. A water works
company was proposed by J. N. Hampshire in 1870. Per-
mission was obtained to use the railway tank in the event
of a fire. Another project was for reservoirs behind the
present High School. Nothing came of all these schemes,
yet, without any water, the Public Works Dept, devised and
the Municipal Council accepted, in 1884, a sewerage scheme to
cost £32,843/6/-. Thirty-four years were to elapse before
this was undertaken.
* Gbn. ‘ l Herald/ ’ 4/10/1856 and Jonathan Williams, “E.P.P.,
24/3/1938.


The nucleus of the present water supply was completed
in 1886, at a cost of £67,000, subsequently written down
by the Government to £55,000. The work including the
reticulation, was undertaken by the Harbours and Rivers’
Board. The council took over the works in 1887, and
appointed Edward Woodhart engineer. He held office for
27 years. The last stone of the water works chimney was
laid by Mrs. J. F. Bastable on the 31/12/1885. The con-
tractors were H. G. Evans and Son of Wagga, the machinery
contractors were Appleby Bros, of London, and the erection
of the plant was carried out by Ball and Stubbs of Goul-
burn. # The Harbours and Rivers’ Board continued in
charge of all constructional work with increasing inepti-
tude. So much so that the council threatened to ventilate
the matter in parliament. In 1889 the council supplemented
the plant with two Californian pumps worked by horse
power. During the construction of the filter beds in 1889
A. Moriarty, supervisor for the Board summoned E. G.
Woodhart, the council’s engineer for assault. The “Penny
Post” burst into verse:
“For two pins they would blow up the country and tear out
the hearts and the livers
Of every son of a gun that draws cheques from the Harbours
and Rivers.”!
There was another dispute about the key to the Water-
works office. Again the “Penny Post” improved the
occasion:
“St. Peter is said to take charge of the keys
For Pluto and also Astarte.
But down at the water supply, if you please,
St. Peter becomes Moriarty.”!
In 1890 a temperance lecturer “descanted” in the
Y.M.C.A. hall upon the virtues of pure water “fresh from
the crystal spring” and “sparkling like diamonds” and
“all that sort of thing you know.” The effect of the
lecture was spoilt by a large water bottle on the table
containing “pure water” as supplied to the citizens of
Goulburn, “as yellow as a Chinaman’s face.”||
Ratepayers evaded payment of water rates and charges
through a defect in the Municipal by-laws. The matter

was rectified by the promotion of a special Act “The Goul-
burn Water Supply Charges Bill. ” A public meeting on
the 21/11/1890 protested against the cost of the water
supply, the debt incurred, the levying of rates to pay for
it and the quality of the water. The prosecutions dragged
on until 1894 and were most unpopular. The council won
most of the cases, f
Supplementary pumps were installed in 1897. At the
formal opening the Mayor turned the steam full on with
a jerk. The “Penny Post” reported:
“Cylinder and piston stood,
Nobody was dead:
And the thankful party drew the corks,
And set to work like Greeks and Turks,
To drink the health of the waterworks,
And then to bed.”t
During the water shortage in 1899 the council pumped
water from “the weir adjoining Rossiville.” The Comte
de Rossi indulged in his usual litigation. From 1893 to
1905 a dispute raged between the Municipality and the
Government over the cost of the water supply. The
original estimate was £25,000. The actual cost was £71,034.
Two Ministers for Works (Lyne and O’Sullivan) were in-
terviewed and eventually the cost was written down to
£55,000. When the 99 year loan is all repaid it will have
cost the council £178,992. § Complaints having been
registered about the colour of the water in 1907 the coun-
cil obtained an analysis which stated the same was due to
“hematite” and was harmless. The local wits had a
lovely time in the press, suggesting it might be used as an
insecticide or dentifrice.|| Goulburn continued to agitate
for a better water supply and a sewerage system. In 1915
a new dam, reservoir and other works were undertaken at
a cost of £17,203. The sewerage scheme was undertaken
in 1915 at an estimated cost of £66,000; £19,500 above the
original estimate. It actually cost £90,989/19/10. The
council (and public opinion) was divided for years over
the respective merits of the Shoalhaven, Sooley Creek and
Pejar schemes for the augmentation of the water supply.
By referendum on the 25/6/1927 the citizens voted for the

Shoalhaven scheme. After still more shilly-shallying the
Department of Public Works advised that the Sooley Creek
Scheme was the only one it could recommend and this was
undertaken. The water supply now has a storage capacity
of 550 million gallons. There are 2900 connections with
the sewerage system. The balance of the water debt was
gazetted on the 31/12/1933 at £156,421/8/-, and the sewer-
age debt at £159,208/1/10. The Sooley Creek catchment
area was planted in 1937 the afforestation being part of the
unemployment relief works. Thirty-two thousand pine
trees were planted.
In 1938 when the debt on the water and sewerage
undertakings amounted to £313,647 all owing to the Govern-
ment, the council was given authority to borrow £252,000
from the National Mutual Life Association which sum the
Government accepted in full settlement.
Further extensions to the sewerage works were under-
taken in 1940 at an estimated cost of £12,800, financed by
£B3OO from the unemployed loan-grant and a loan of £SOOO
from the council's electricity trading fund.* A water short-
age in 1940 revealed some startling differences of opinion as
to the original construction of the Sooley Dam. The coun-
cil was of the opinion that its height could be increased by
5 feet at a cost of £SOOO. The Department of Public Works
advised that it had not been so constructed and that the cost
of increasing its storage would be £25,000. f
Municipal Baths.
A bathing pool was first mooted in 1881 “at the north
end of Albert Street’ ’ No action was taken. Another
proposal for baths to cost £IO,OOO was brought forward in
18874 Tenders were called for public baths and a skating
rink in 1891 but none was accepted. A reduced scheme
was undertaken in 1893. E. C. Manfred was the architect,
and Wilkie Bros, the contractors. The site of these baths
was where Conolly’s mill now stands. The contract price
was £1497/12/6 and the cost £2OOO. The “new public
baths” were opened on the 18/11/1892 and were much
criticised on the score of their inadequate size. ||

The Council leased the baths to Shurmer and Day for
£75 per annum, “the Council are not bound to supply soap”
was one of the conditions of the lease. The average rental
was £53/4/- per annum, and the average loss £165/4/6 per
annum. In 1906 the baths were sold for £IOOO4 In 1907
new baths were built in Victoria Park, by day labour. E.
C. Manfred was the architect. They have since been im-
proved and extended and a caretaker’s residence built.
Various schemes for their further improvement or removal
to another site have been discussed.
The Electricity Undertaking:
In 1883 the Goulburn Gas Company at its annual meet-
ing considered the possibility of competition from electric
light. Its chairman, A. M. Betts, was consoling. He quoted
Professor Sirman to the effect that “no system will be prac-
ticable for using the electric light at a distance of over one
quarter of a mile from any station.” He told the meeting
that Goulburn would not be lit with electric light under an
expenditure of £15,000, an impossible figure then but a re-
markably close prophecy of the actual cost thirty-one years
later. § In 1889 the same chairman, after cautioning the City
Council against rushing into an electric light scheme, sug-
gested that if electric lighting were decided upon the engine
at the waterworks might be utilised
“to drive the machinery for the supply of water during the
day and for the supply of light by night.”*
The press also refused to take these hankerings after
electric light seriously:
“They say the Council will do right,
If they obtain th’ electric light,
The gas men need not take fright—
They’ll never do it.”t
In 1888/9, 1896 and 1898 the council accepted tenders
for the electric lighting of the city. Each time public meet-
ings, said to have been packed by the Gas Company, opposed
the proposals, and nothing was done.||
In 1911 the municipal council commissioned J. G.
Donoghue to report upon two proposals, an electric lighting
system and a garbage destructor. He estimated that there
would be 270 consumers. The scheme provided for 149

street lamps. The cost of the electric lighting scheme was
estimated at £12,818. The garbage plant was designed to
deal with 30 loads a week. The proposal for a destructor
was dropped. The council decided to borrow £13,000 and
proceed with the work. It was referred to the ratepayers
and a poll authorised this. Nevertheless the Colonial
Treasurer refused to guarantee the loan.§ The work pro-
ceeded, however, and at the end of May, 1914, Goulburn
streets were lit by electric light instead of gas. J. G.
Donoghue, the consulting engineer, issued his final certificate
on the 5/12/1914. The total initial cost of the undertaking,
apart from extras, was £11,847/0/6. That year H. K. Coutts
was appointed City Electrical Engineer. Another £7500 was
borrowed for extensions in 1916.
The council sat from 7.30 p.m. to midnight one night
and from 7.30 p.m. to 9.45 p.m. another night in 1923 en-
quiring into the matter of a brawl at the power house and
the suspension of a fireman.
The Australian General Electric Coy. Ltd. brought a
serious charge against the electrical engineer in connection
with a contract in 1926. The council asked for a Local
Government Board enquiry which was refused. In defence
it published the whole of its correspondence and expressed
it absolute confidence in the integrity of its electrical eng-
neer. It would appear that the trouble arose out of a
misunderstanding.
The total capital expenditure on the electricity under-
taking from its inception to 1933 was £112,046. The
electricity undertaking was brought into the Burrenjuck
grid scheme in 1938. The cash value of the Power House
plant in 1935, after depreciation had been written off at
£4OOO per annum for years, stood at £40,000. Allowing for
depreciation at the same rate until such time as the bulk
supply was fully available, the Department of Public Works
agreed to pay the Municipal Council the sum of £16,500 for
the plant, as and where it stood. There is now no debt on
the Municipal Electricity undertaking. The Government
paid £16,000 in 1940 for the plant. The power house re-
mained the property of the municipality. Prior to linking
up with the grid system (and during the curtailment of
§ “E.P.P.,” 19/9/1911, 9/12/1911.


supplies from Burrenjuck) the municipal electricity under-
taking had 5130 consumers and was generating 5,277,863
units per annum. *
In 1939/40 the Goulburn sub-station in the Port Kembla-
Burrenjuck bulk electricity network was built at a cost of
approximately £90,000. The completion of this line was
designed to enable an interchange of power between the two
systems, on the 132,000 volts cable to Goulburn and on the
66,000 volts line through Canberra to Burrenjuck. The
Goulburn sub-station is designed to step down or reduce
the voltage from 132,000 to 66,000 volts for the Canberra
line and 11,000 for the supply to Goulburn and Gunning.
The council decided upon the 9/11/1939 to adopt a trading
scheme for electrical appliances.!
The Mulwaree Shire:
When Local Government was first proposed for rural
areas in 1894 the residents of the County of Argyle voted
against it.j: It was not until 1906 that this measure of local
government was obtained. The Mulwaree Shire was pro-
claimed on the 15/5/1906. The Mulwaree Shire and the
Municipality of Goulburn together provide the local govern-
ment for the County of Argyle. The shire has its head-
quarters in Goulburn. At first it rented offices in the Town
Hall. Now it is in the Commercial Banking Coy’s. Chambers.
The first temporary council consisted of John Knowlman,
J J. Roberts, Jas. Armstrong, Geo. Reynolds and J. J. Walsh.
This was succeeded at the first election by a council consist-
ing of J. J. Roberts, C. R. Styles, P. F. O’Brien, J. Coles,
L. C. Whiting and J. J. Walsh. The first Shire Clerk was
A. W. Bullen and Meldrom was the first engineer. Workmen
received 7/- a day and councillors sd. an hour. In 1906
A. W. Barton was appointed Shire Clerk. The Mulwaree
Shire has never borrowed. All its plant and all its con-
tracts have been paid for out of revenue. §
Progress and Ratepayers’ Associations:
There have been innumerable progress and kindred
associations in Goulburn. There was a “ Progress Commit-
tee” in the early fifties. || Another early organisation was

the “ Roads Association.” With H. W. Watts as a secretary
it was agitating for the abolition of tolls in 1875. f
Another Progress Association was formed in 1880. E. J.
Ball (mayor) was its chairman. Another was formed,
“The City Advancement League/ ’ on the 15/4/1898. E. C.
Bryden was chairman, A. E. Sendall and John Walsh its
secretaries. Later it was called the ‘ ‘ Goulburn and District
Progress Association.” A “Citizen’s Executive Committee”
in 1912 induced the Municipal Council to call a public meet-
ing to protest against the alienation of Federal Government
House, Sydney. The “Goulburn Ratepayers Associa-
tion” was active in 1930/1 and the “Property Owners and
Ratepayers’ Association” in 1933. A branch of the “Rating
on Unimproved Values League” was formed on the
10/1/1908. The president was Charles Rogers.:):
The improvements to Victoria Park in 1911/1912 were
financed largely by the Victoria Park Recreation Ground
Improvement Committee. One of its chief efforts was a
large carnival, which was opened by the Governor, Lord
Chelmsford, on the 28/2/1912. § The carnival experienced
bad weather and in addition was marred by an accident in
the motor cycle events in which C. P. Holloway lost his leg.
An “Eastgrove Improvement Committee” was at work in
1889.11 Progress associations at North, South, East and West
Goulburn have worked actively for many years, concerned
chiefly of course, with the needs of their own suburbs.

CHAPTER X.
PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION AND POLITICS.
N 1842 New South Wales achieved, in the “Act for the
the Government of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s
Land,” a measure of constitutional reform embracing
the elective principle. The first elections were held the
next year, on 18/7/1843, when Wm. Bradley was elected as
the member for Argyle County. It was a restricted fran-
chise, viz., owners of freehold worth £2OO and householders
paying £2O p.a. In Goulburn the Bench of Magistrates re-
ported on the franchise, “3 lease-holders paying £3O p.a.,
5 over £2O but under £3O, not entitled to the franchise. Two
held their lands at annual lease, 6 for a term of 2 years’ ’ #
The old Legislative Council consisted of 36 members, of
whom the Governor nominated 12; the remaining 24 were
elected. The County of Argyle returned one member; its
polling places were Goulburn and Bungonia.f
Other candidates at the 1843 elections who announced
their intention of standing were Shelley and Major Lockyer.
Shelley withdrew and Major Lockyer faded out. The
‘ ‘ Sydney Morning Herald ’’ said:
“but hearing nothing more of it we presume he has also given
up.”
Later in the list of candidates it shewed:
“County of Argyle—one member, One candidate: Wm. Bradley.”!
On the 14/6/1843 W. P. Faithfull the Returning Officer
read the writ calling upon the Constitutency of Argyle to
elect a member of the new Legislative Council. Dr. Murphy
proposed William Bradley, “Never did religion ask in vain,
or was indigence turned from his door with disappointed
hope.” Captain Gore seconded the nomination. At this
point Bradley spoke to the electors. There being no other
candidate W. P. Faithfull declared Wm. Bradley elected. A
lunch at the Salutation Inn followed
“which was tastefully decorated with flowers: between the
centre windows the emblems of the Colony were exhibited, over
which a Crown was placed, on either side hung flags, with the
device ‘Bradley and the People of Argyle,’ and in front of all,
a flag, containing the emblems of the three kingdoms.”

There was a long toast list Dr. Yarnold proposing “Mrs.
Bradley and the Ladies of Argyle.” Later the electors
dined. Brodie gave a bullock which was roasted in the
market place, Duncan McKellar gave the bread and Bradley
himself two hogsheads of ale. The press report concludes:
“at this time the scene was complete, and we do not remember
to have seen anything (everything considered) so interesting in
the Colony.”
A large number of aborigines was present. Another
dinner was held at the Salutation Inn
“At which there was no want of wines, or anything calculated
to make the company as comfortable as they could wish.”
Yet a third dinner party (30 strong) was held at Brad-
ley’s house. F. Macarthur of Norwood, presided,
“The election of that gentleman to preside at the table gave
universal satisfaction.”*
Dr. Nicholson, afterwards Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart.,
was the member for the County of Argyle in 1848 and 1851.
The Goulburn “Herald” prior to the election favoured Dr.
Nicholson on account of his “business habits and experience
in council matters.” It admitted that he was “non-resident
in the district” unlike the other probable starters, W. P.
Faithfull, Captain Rossi and J. F. Mac Arthur. Dr. Nichol-
son’s election address of 1851 emphasised his opposition to
transportation, f
The following were the Goulburn and Argyle members
of the Legislative Council of New South Wales prior to the
date of responsible government in 1856:

Association. The Colony at that time was in difficult fi-
nancial straits and it was hoped that an influx of cheap
labour would redress the balance 4
A leading article in the “Monitor” expressed “the
deepest satisfaction’ ’ with the proceedings of the Goulburn
District Committee of the Australian Immigration Associa-
tion :
“We cannot forget that as Goulburn is the first district which
has made a public demonstration in favour of the Association,
so also was it amongst the earliest which, some months back,
petitioned for Representative Government.”*
Columbus Fitzpatrick nominated for the Argyle election
of 1856 but received no votes at all. The result was: J.
Plunkett 182, J. W. Chisholm 162, Columbus Fitzpatrick O.f
The election for the “Southern Boroughs” in 1859 was
lively. Sir T. A. Murray was opposed by Hardy of Yass.
To commemorate Murray’s return a bullock was roasted
in Belmore Square. Another hotly contested Argyle elec-
tion was in 1864 between Phil Dignam and Sydney Emanuel.
Several hotels were kept open till midnight at the successful
candidate’s expense. Dignam obtained 575 votes, Emanuel
515. Wm. Teece was first elected member for the city in
1872 and held office for fourteen years. He was largely
responsible for the erection of many of the public buildings
in Goulburn. His opponent at that first election was the
previous member, M. Alexander. Although the latter had
the support of Sir Henry Parkes, Teece won.
Cecil Teece who succeeded him, was not so popular a
member as William, nor did he accomplish so much for the
city. The “Penny Post” published a series of verses con-
cluding :
“But ask us something easy do—to answer we 41 not cease,
And something ask in reason too: but ask us not where’s Teece.”||
Elections in the eighties were strenuous contests. There
were six candidates in Goulburn in 1880 for two seats. The
papers were flooded with anonymous advertisements. Some
were addressed to Roman Catholics telling them how to vote,
some criticised them accusing them of “flooding the country
with Jesuit and Marist brothers.” Some were addressed
to “Free Selectors,” “Free-Speech Men,” “Free Education

Men,” “Squatters” were warned of the “Promise-Every-
thing” candidates. The worst of all was addressed to
“Orangemen” asking them to vote for “no Papist whatever
his views may be.”§
Frank Warden, of Clifford Street, Goulburn, advertised:
“A Fearless, Sarcastic Pamphlet, exhibiting the capers and
antics of Ms. P. in the 19th Century and the Bright, Senseless
actions of the Red Tape Officials of New South Wales.”*
Election advertisements were unrestrained fifty years
ago. One in 1885 :
“Only for Shame Sake!
THE CLIQUE
If all failed them, would, out of nothing else but damnable spite,
have nominated a Chinaman or a black-fellow in opposition, etc.”
The Opposition candidate (evidently a carpet-bagger)
was described as “A 'Pick-up' in the shape of a Flying
Cad.” The electors were advised that “He is better fitted
for the position of a Clown in a low pantomime than for a
seat in Parliament.”! O. E. Dibbs and John Dillon, M.P.,
visited Goulburn in 1889. Sir Geo. Grey, New Zealand
politician, fulfilled several engagements here in 18914
Goulburn was well informed on the Federation issue in
1897. Amongst those addressing meetings in Goulburn were
Edmund Barton, W. J. Lyne, W. P. Cullen, Sir Arthur Ren-
wick, Daniel O’Connor, J. C. Watson, W. J. Ferguson, John
Haynes, E. D. Miller, J. Ashton, G. H. Reid, W. M. Hughes,
W. P. Crick, E. W. O’Sullivan and others (19 in all). Even
the parsons preached “Federation sermons.”
Voting on the Convention Bill of 1898 was:
Goulburn: Yes 434; No 733.
Argyle: Yes 354; No 786.ft
The “Penny Post” had no great idea of the probity
of politicians. Over and over again the proprietors, Daniel
Bros., notified “Parliamentary Candidates” that no political
advertisement would be inserted “unless paid for in ad-
vance. ”||
On 4/9/1901 a petition from 600 residents in Goulburn
was presented to the Legislative Council. “It is expedient
that the electoral franchise should be extended to women

G. H. Reid, conducting his anti-socialistic crusade, gave
an address in Goulburn on 28/4/1906. He delighted the

to him in Goulburn on 30/4/1906. The Irish Envoys, Devlin
and Donovan, gave addresses in Goulburn on the Home Rule
issue on 6/8/1906. #
Federation came in 1900 and in May 1901, the first
Commonwealth Parliament met. At first Goulburn was in
the Werriwa electorate. Since 1934 it has formed part of
Eden-Monaro. The following have been its members:

who have represented Constituencies of which
Goulburn has been a part.
Gonlburn so far has not produced a senator, nor has
there been “any connection between Gonlburn and any mem-
ber of the senate since the inception of this Chamber.’
There have been innumerable political organisations in
Goulburn. In the eighties and nineties Land Nationalisa-
tion, Freetrade, Liberal, Protectionist and Local Option
Leagues were all active. One such organisation missed fire.
A meeting was called to form a “Liberal Political Associa-
tion” in 1883. Those present moved the deletion of the
word “political” from the title and the substitution of “Free
thought.” The amendment was carried and the society

formed. § The Goulburn branch of the Single-Tax League
of N.S.W. was functioning in the eighties and nineties and
waited upon Sir George Grey when he visited Goulburn on
23/5/1891.* A branch of the Labour Electoral League was
functioning in Goulburn in 1891. The first Amalgamated
Labour Demonstration was held in Goulburn on the
9/11/1891 and was a tremendous success. As usual the
“Penny Post” hailed the occasion in verse:
“All honour to the toilers
Who daily prove their worth
Without their thew and sinew
Grim want would rule the earth.”
The Demonstration was held under the auspices of the
“Trade and Labour Societies.”!
Federation was a burning question in 1898. One week
the “Goulburn Federal League” was formed to support the
Federal Commonwealth Bill. A week later the “Anti-
Convention Bill League” was formed to combat it. The
following year P. McShane was president of the “Federal
League,” and W. J. Bartlett of the “Anti-Bill” League.^
A Women’s Franchise League was in being in 1901. In
1902 it called itself the “Women’s Political Association of
Goulburn and District.” That year too the “People’s Re-
form League” was formed. } It was concerned with questions
of Government economy and the reduction of members. The
New States Movement and the New Settlers’ League had
branches here in 1924.ft A branch of the Australian Pro-
testant Defence Association was founded in Goulburn by
Dr. Dill Macky in 1902.|| The first union in Goulburn would
appear to have been a branch of the “Boot and Shoemakers’
Protection Union,” formed in 1875 by the employees of Gil-
lespie’s and Teece’s factories. A meeting was held at the
“Emu” Inn on 17/2/1886 to take steps to form “A Working
Men’s Union.”**
The Amalgamated Railway and Tramway Association,
the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Amalgamated
Shearers’ Union, the Millers’ Engine Drivers’ and Mill Em-
ployees’ Association, the Amalgamated Bootmakers’ Union
all had branches in Goulburn in the early nineties. Another

A branch of the Amalgamated Bootmakers ’ Union of
N.S.W. was formed in Goulburn on the 22/3/1890. The
Shearers’ Union had an office in Verner Street in 1890. The
Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Tailors is mentioned
as meeting at the Oddfellows’ Hall in 1891. The Amalgamated
Coachbuilders, Railway Car, Waggon Makers and Wheel-
wrights’ Society was another union at work that year, as
was the Amalgamated Navvies and General Labourers’
Union. A branch of the Socialist League was formed then.*
The “Saturday Half-Holiday Association” was formed
chiefly by shop assistants, in 1873. Apparently it did not
meet with much success for in 1885 the Goulburn stores were
still kept open six full days a week when the first meeting
of the “Friday Half-Holiday Association” was held. It
was not until 1899 that a weekly half-holiday was proclaimed
and then it was on a Wednesday. Just previously some
stores and businesses had been observing Friday. A petition
to the Premier was presented in 1900 requesting the con-
tinuance of the Friday half-holiday. The Premier promised
a proclamation in favour. However a day or two later
another meeting demanded Saturday. A public meeting
finally chose Saturday. Lively correspondence ensued also
some prosecutions. Chas. Rogers defended Saturday. On
the subject of early closing, one J. Goold wrote to the
“Penny Post” in opposition:
“.... the public have a right to walk into any shop any hour
of the day or night and demand to be served. To shew lam
not going to be coerced by such legislation I have reduced the
wages of all my employees and given orders to reduce the
butcher’s and baker’s bills by one-third. I intend to wear
fewer clothes so that the output of all my trades-people will
suffer.’ ’
A stormy meeting on 13/8/1900 sought to upset the
decision to observe the Saturday half-holiday. Sixty stores
advertised their intention to open on Saturdays and close
on Friday afternoons. Much confusion resulted for several
months, some closing Friday, some Saturday, a few eccen-
trics, on Wednesday, whilst some, by way of testing the law,
* Gbn. “Herald,” 5/4/1890; “E.P.P.,” 1890/1891; “Werriwa
Times,” 7/10/1901.


observed no half-holiday at all. In December all were made
to close on Wednesday. A ballot held on the 27/2/1901
resulted in the restoration of the Saturday half-holiday.
The Court decided to test the qualifications of the
signatories. Dozens of witnesses were called and examined
and a large number of the memorialists ’ signatures were
eliminated, some upon what seemed to be flimsy grounds.
After this pruning only 51 names remained out of 189 eligible
to vote. The case was dismissed and automatically, until
reversed by a subsequent referendum, Wednesday again be-
came the half-holiday.
The second Half-Holiday Association was formed by the
shop assistants in 1909. This was more of a social and
recreational order. The “Eight-Hour Association” func-
tioned for many years. The principle won, it devoted its
main energies to a sports meeting on the Eight-Hour Holiday.
It is now the Six-Hour Day Movement.*
The first Liquor License Amendment Association’s meet-
ing was held on 30/5/1878. Its programme was modest, the
closing of public houses on Sundays and the establishment
of a licensing board. One of the earliest local option polls
was held by the Municipal Council in 1888. Voting was
close and the number of voters small, e.g., Centre Ward: 27
No, 24 Yes, 1 Informal. North Ward: 48 No, 46 Yes, 2
Informal. South Ward: 17 No, 12 Yes, 7 Informal. Another
in 1900 aroused less interest still, only 15 ratepayers voted
and the cost of votes worked out at 2/6 each.f
A branch of the N.S.W. Alliance was established in 1903.
Bishop Barlow was president the first year, W. H. Wheatley
the second.;}:
A crowd of 1500 citizens met in the rain outside the
Town Hall on the 19/3/1931 to demand the abolition of State
Parliaments and the establishment of Provincial Councils.
That year too a public meeting was held on the 17/6/1931
to protest against the “State Transport (Co-ordination)
Bill.” The meeting was packed by Railway employees and
the protest was lost by three votes. §

CHAPTER XL
THE RAILWAY.
OULBURN was one of the first centres in New South
Wales to agitate for a railway. On the 3/4/1846
meetings were held at Lyon’s rooms in Sydney and
at the Royal Hotel in Gonlburn to report on the traffic
between Sydney and Gonlburn. The Gonlburn meeting
was attended by all the leading landowners. The Sydney
meeting was presided over by James Macarthnr and was
addressed at considerable length by Dr. (afterwards Sir
Charles) Nicholson who advocated strongly the building of
the line. A further meeting was called for the 6/5/1846,
again at Lyon’s rooms to expedite the project. The cost
was estimated at £6OOO per mile. In 1847 a meeting was
held in Mandelson’s Hotel, Gonlburn, to enlist local support
for the Sydney scheme. Still another meeting was held
in the old police office, Gonlburn, in December, 1848. Captain
F. N. Rossi presided and the meeting was addressed by Sir
T. A. Murray, Dr. Nicholson, the Hon. James Chisholm, Dr.
Waugh and others.* Prior to that, writing in 1847, Dr.
John Dunmore Lang had said :
“There is an effort making in the colony at present for the
construction of a railway between Sydney and Goulburn, which
I consider the most promising line in the country. The advan-
tages of such a mode of communication for this district will be
incalculably great. It will open up an immense extent of grain-
growing country in these elevated regions of the first quality
for cultivation. It will afford the rapidly increasing population
of the southern country generally a cheap and expeditious mode
of transport both for agricultural and for pastoral produce to
the Colonial Capital.”
He went on to speak of the “low public houses by the
wayside,” the resorts of “bullock drivers and nests of de-
predation and dissipations” and advocated the railway as
tending to “greatly promote the moral welfare and advance-
ment of the colony.”
He concluded:
“As a specimen of the extent of traffic along the present road,
Mr. Bradley alone pays upwards of £7OO a year for carriage
to and from Sydney.”!
One of the reasons put forward in justification of a
railway was that £120,000 was being sent out of the colony
* MacAlister. p, 302. t Phillipsland. pp, 241/2.


to purchase grain which could be grown
the “Sydney and Goulburn Railway Company” was formed.
Nothing came of all these stirrings and Goulburn had to
wait another fifteen years for its railway. When this rail-
way to Goulburn was proposed, one Thos. West wrote de-
precating the expending of £4,000,000 upon “an untried plan
of railways.” He suggested instead “3 lines of roads for
traction engines” at a cost of £60,000. Each was to haul
a train of six waggons.
He furnished an elaborate calculation shewing “a
weekly profit of £173 less loading expenses. ” #
A long account appeared in the “Goulburn Herald”
of the turning of the first sod of the railway between Sydney
and Goulburn at the Sydney terminus on the 10/7/1850.
Nine thousand persons were present. All shops were closed.
The procession included “cabs, gigs and carriages” and “all
lodges.”! Samuel Sidney's “Emigrants' Journal and Travel-
lers’ Magazine” of 1850 records a project of:
“forming a railway or tramway from Sydney through Parra-
matta and Wellington to Goulburn, a great squatting district,
distant from Sydney about seventy miles (sic). The Colonial
Government will support a guarantee of five per cent for twenty-
five years on the capital expended in executing any part of this
line.”**
The “Sydney and Goulburn Railway Company” trans-
ferred its interests to the Government on the 3/9/1854. §
Considerable delays ensued before the Government under-
took the work and still more after the work was begun,
the reason for which is not apparent now. A press para-
graph read:
“In consequence of Messrs. Kane and Bloomfield not complying
with the Government specification for the extension of the
Southern railway to Goulburn, W. Faviell’s tender has been
accepted. The works will be commenced immediately.”
The foundation stone of the Goulburn railway station
was laid by the mayor (Wm. Davies) on the 12/5/1868. A
“resident railway engineer” appears in the directory for
1867 G. F. Mann. There was an illustration of the Goul-
burn railway station, “now in course of erection” in the
“Illustrated Sydney News” in 1868. The main building
as erected then has altered very little.

F. F. Vogel, formerly of the personal staff of the N.S.W.
Railway Commissioner contributed to “the Staff” in 1926
a series of articles on the inauguration of railways in this
State. His account of the survey and original plans for the
main southern line were reproduced in the “Penny Post.”*
The railway was opened on the 27/5/1869 by the
Governor, the Earl of Belmore, who was accompanied by the
Countess and several ministers of the State Government.
At the public banquet that night, tendered to the Governor,
Sir Charles Cowper stated that it was from the citizens of
Goulburn themselves that the promoters received their
greatest encouragement.! On the 26/3/1869 the first railway
train which had steamed into Goulburn, arrived, bringing up
the Warwick (Sydney) cricketers to play in a match against
Goulburn.t The “demonstration” or “Official opening” of
the extension to Goulburn of the Great Southern Railway
is the subject of several references and one special minute
in the municipal records. Twice the municipal council re-
fused to contribute towards the cost, but the mayor was
deputed to obtain a tree for the Countess of Belmore to plant
and “a suitable barrow and spade for the occasion.” An
illuminated address was given to the Governor “On Alight-
ing from the Railway Carriage.” The address to the Gover-
nor and the Governor's reply both expressed the hope “that
the cool and salubrious climate of this neighbourhood will be
the means of inducing many of the residents of Sydney to a
temporary sojourn amongst us.” The wheelbarrow and
the spade were given to the Countess as a memento. Purchas
gave the tree.§
The dimensions of the original Goulburn railway bridges
were as follows:
Wollondilly River, 122 miles from Sydney 616 feet
Wollondilly River, 127 miles from Sydney 614 feet
Boxer’s Creek, 133 miles from Sydney 206 feet
Mulwaree Creek, Goulburn, 858 feet
When John Whitton, engineer-in-chief of the N.S.W.
Railways, died in 1898 it was recalled that he had offered
great opposition to a proposed break of gauge at Bathurst
and Goulburn. The original idea was for the construction
of light narrow-gauge railways or horse-tramways from

these points.|| In 1872 two lamps were placed at the entrance
to the railway station “at the suggestion of Mr. Norman,
station master. ’ ’ Previously to that vehicles used to collide
there in the dark.*' The first railway viaduct at North Goul-
burn, being duly admired by 2 horses and 6 cows, was
pictured in the “Illustrated Sydney News” in 1874.
Criticism of railway matters was soon forthcoming. A
leading article in the “Penny Post” in 1873, stated if a
charitable institution required a special excursion they were
told that all carriages were required in Sydney and were
offered cattle trucks. “Everything is Sydney! their Alpha
and Omega is Sydney. ’ ’ For some years Goulburn remained
the terminus of the southern line and profited accordingly.
There were 60/70 carriers in Goulburn engaged in the dis-
tribution of goods to the Riverina and Victoria. When the
extension of the southern railway from Goulburn to Albury
was mooted, the “Penny Post” observed:
“It is generally noised abroad that when the extension of the
line of railway is open, the effects upon Goulburn will be most
disastrous.”!
Its description of the Commissioner’s (Rae) inspection
of the route was unconsciously funny. He
“arrived in this city from the Metropolis by train. The party
started on the tour of inspection in a buggy and we believe they
intend returning to Goulburn the same way.”
A public meeting was held in Goulburn on 3/5/1875
to protest against “the bill to legalise the sale of fermented
and spirituous liquors at the refreshment rooms on the rail-
ways.” There was a carriers’ strike at the Goulburn ter-
minus in 1875 affecting 60 teamsters and between 75 and 100
teams. When settled (on the carriers’ terms) the press
of business was so great that extra porters had to be tele-
graphed for from Sydney.^
Gas was used for the lighting of railway carriages on
the southern line for the first time on 15/5/1879. The gas
was made from tallow and forced into cylinders at 100 lb.
to the square inch.§ That year the “Penny Post” wrote:
“Strange that Goulburnites, living in a city containing nearly
6000 inhabitants, should be unable to get a crust of bread at
the Railway Station.”

It took a long time for it to dawn upon the railway
management that Moss Vale and Gonlburn were colder than
Sydney. Foot warmers in the carriages were supplied for
the first time in 1880. || The railway workshops were begun
in 1881. # Platform tickets were not available down to the
eighties. Nobody but actual passengers were allowed on
the platform. Gonlburn led the way in the matter of reform
in that the custom grew up of booking to North Gonlburn
(2d.) and utilising the ticket to obtain admission to the plat-
form. The first refreshment room at the Gonlburn station,
a temporary building, was opened in 1883. f
Outcries against the increasing centralisation of railway
works and the removal of numbers of railway employees
from Gonlburn to Sydney began as far back as 1888. The
Gonlburn Permanent Way Workshops manufactured in 1895
the first railway tricycles made in N.S.W. The credit was
due to Shellshear, the divisional engineer, Leek, the inspector
of buildings and bridges, and Parker, works foreman.^
An important meeting was held in Gonlburn on the
20/3/1888 to urge upon the Government some measure of
decentralisation. It was pointed out that the differential
railway rates debarred Gonlburn from becoming a manu-
facturing town. Freight from Gonlburn to Hay was £6 per
ton as against £3/6/8 from Sydney, 134 miles more. A De-
centralisation League was formed. The Minister for Works
met the league on 28/3/1888 but did not promise very
much. His official reply was published a fortnight later.
The question of “differential” rates worried Gonlburn for
many years. In the eighties Chas. MacAlister, Sol. Meyer,
A. M. Betts, Chas. Rogers and W. Bartlett headed a deputa-
tion to John Sutherland, then Minister for Railways, pro-
testing against this very thing.
In 1907 Chas. MacAlister wrote:
“the centralising policy of the railway system and management
has unduly penalised the country interests to buttress the com-
mercial strength of Sydney. ... it would seem to have been ‘an
article of faith’... .that ‘Sydney is New South Wales’....”
The injury done to the secondary industries in Gonlburn
by those differential railway rates is referred to constantly

in the local press. One striking instance affecting local
secondary industries was quoted in 1880. Sydney brewers
could send a ton of beer to Wagga for £4/2/8. Goulburn
brewers were charged (for 130 miles less) £4/14/2, 11/6 per
ton in favour of Sydney. The differential railway rates
continued to exercise the minds of Goulburn business people.
In 1890 a number of such undertook to test the legality of
the discrimination. Action was taken in the Goulburn
police court on 25/7/1890. B. R. Wise appeared for the
railways, A. M. Betts and H. S. Gannon for the complain-
ants. The case turned on the carriage of goods from Sydney
to Hay, £24 per truck and from Goulburn to Hay £24 per
truck and (on another class of goods) Sydney to Hay
£29/12/-, • Goulburn to Hay £SB/1/-. The case was dis-
missed. In 1891 the principle of decentralisation was
vindicated to some extent in that in each “inland station’ ’
became a “Sydney station as far as the operation of the dif-
ferential railway system is concerned.” Flour millers’
rebates were introduced in 1887 by the railway department
as a concession to country millers. In 1932 they were with-
drawn, at the instance of Sydney millers, resulting in the
closing of a number of country mills. A new by-law was
introduced in 1937 restoring in part the privileges enjoyed
previously by country millers. In 1939 metropolitan
interests were again demanding its withdrawal. The
country millers in 1905 were up against another difficulty.
The railway charged them 2/6 a ton extra freight on wheat
for “break of journey,” a charge not made on the city
millers. A deputation to expostulate was told calmly “This
is a question of city millers versus country millers.” The
Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the charge was fatal
to the export trade and would almost kill country milling.
The commissioners refused to budge.
Eventually, after much agitation the “break of journey”
charge was reduced from 2/6 to 1/9 a ton. However by
this time the damage was done and most of the country mills
had ceased operations. 1 * An important public meeting was
held in Goulburn on 18/9/1895 to secure from the railway
commissioners the extension of the southern tourist district

to Goulburn. The request was refused but, four years
later, after years of agitation, the overhead bridge at the
railway station, to Eastgrove, was opened. Work began
on the survey for the Goulburn-Crookwell railway in 1900.
The first sod was turned on 24/5/1900 at Crookwell by the
Hon. E. W. O’Sullivan. The surveyors were instructed to
omit surveys 4 ‘for the present of lands others than those
given free by owners.”
Money was subscribed locally to compensate the owners.
A league was appointed to further these objects. The
Crookwell railway league did not find it all plain sailing.
It reported later that nine landowners required payment for
their lands, that the amount to be raised was all too great
and that some of the largest landowners had withdrawn
their offers to give land free. Crookwell was disappointed
at this failure to secure the line from Goulburn. An alter-
native route from Yarra was suggested along which the
owners were willing to comply. Three days later the can-
vassers reported that the amounts demanded by landowners
had been reduced considerably. In the same issue appeared
an advertisement for ironbark and hardwood for the first
20 miles of the railway. The Government, whilst not
abandoning the Crookwell railway project, was still insisting
on free grants of land from landowners benefitting. A
month later it was decided that the railway should be con-
structed by day labour A
Another set of differential railway rates in 1904 caused
some heart-burnings on the southern line. For the same
distance on the northern and southern lines the difference
for third class goods was 27/4 in favour of Newcastle.!
In 1904 the City Council joined in the protest against
the discontinuance of cheap week-end return tickets from
Sydney to Goulburn. Later it joined with Bathurst in a
deputation to the commissioners.^
Some reminiscences of Guard James Pauli of Goulburn,
were published on the occasion of his completing 40 years’
service in the railways. As guard for 31 years he had
travelled 1,434,113 miles. When James Pauli joined the
service, the N.S.W. Railways comprised the following lines:
* Gbn. “Herald,” 16/1/1900, 25/1/1900, 25/5/1900; “E.P.P.,”

Newcastle to Singleton, Sydney to Penrith, and Sydney to
Picton. He came to Goulburn in 1879. There were no
Westinghouse brakes in those days and the guards had to
stand at the brake wheels and steady the trains as best they
could. Nor were there any 8-hour shifts.
Another old railway identity was Driver Thorburn, who
also was 40 years in the service. He drove the first train
to Kelso, and remembered "the early days of hand gear and
wood brake.”*
The most popular train from Sydney to Gonlburn is
that leaving Central Station about 5 p.m. It was several
years, however, before the commissioners would agree to
extend this train beyond Moss Yale. A little later they
refused again to extend the tourist district to Goulburn.
The agitation for an overhead bridge at South Goulburn
instead of a level crossing at Baxter’s factory was supported
by the council in 1912.
The Municipal Council laid a long list of requests before
the commissioner in 1913, some of which, such as the running
of a day train and the roofing in of the island platform, were
later granted. Later it protested strongly against the works
undertaken at the station and secured some improvements,
but not the subway asked for.f
It was 1916 before the railway station was lit by elec-
tricity. After many years of agitation the South Goulburn
trucking yards were promised in 1920. The inconvenence
of trucking yards at North Goulburn and saleyards first at
West and later at South Goulburn continued for years. It
was in 1923 that the new saleyards were opened and the
new trucking yards again promised. The Goulburn/Taralga
line was opened on the 23/2/19264
The following Goulburn railway statistics for 1935 are
typical:
Employees, 876. Wages, £BOOO per fortnight. Passenger
traffic, 73,421 tickets representing £30,691; 57,003 tons re-
presenting £59,976.

Superintendent, gave the number of railway employees resi-
dent in Goulburn as 840 and their annual wage as £225,000.§
Some trouble ensued in the Railway service in Goulburn in
1893 when the commissioners dispensed with the services
of certain men for what now seems inadequate reasons. A
long agitation and newspaper correspondence followed. To
add to the confusion the railway guards affirmed their
loyalty to the commissioners.*
The North Goulburn Railway viaduct did duty from
1869 to 1914 when a new bridge was built to accommodate
the double track. The original bridge was demolished in
1937. f
Goulburn took the 1917 railway strike philosophically.
There was much distress and inconvenience. The local
strike committee arranged a certain amount of picketing but
there was no rioting.
On the 23/2/1928 the gangs at the Railway quarry,
North Goulburn, fired a blast in order to obtain material for
ballasting flood washaways. It blew 20,000 tons of earth
and rock on to the railway line, completely blocking com-
munication with Sydney and depositing one set of rails in
the Wollondilly. All telephone and telegraphic communica-
tions were interrupted together with the railway signal ser-
vice.:];
In 1929 the City Council, the Chamber of Commerce and
others petitioned the Government for a new railway station.
The request was refused. In lieu the Government offered
to hang some pictures in the ladies’ waiting room. The
Railway works in Goulburn were reduced again in 1930
when many of the staff were removed to Cardiff. Only
running repairs are now made at the Round House in lien
of the big overhauls formerly undertaken.
Although the Railway differential rates have mostly
disappeared there are still anomalies which are detrimental*
to country manufacturing. If a Goulburn manufacturer
consigns soap to Cooma (120 miles) he pays £4/3/1 in freight
as against a Sydney manufacturer who only pays £3/17/-
(for 270 miles). Leather belting is charged £5/8/2 whilst
leather only pays £l/7/4. There are similar anomalies in
the freight on wheat and flour.||

PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
Court House.
ANGING in the present court house is the plan and
specification of a much earlier building. They carry
the date 14/1/1834 and are signed by Wm. Buchanan,
Clerk of Works. These are the actual plans of the first
court house in the old township, which was a wooden or slab
structure built in 1836. Of these plans the Goulburn
“Herald” wrote in 1884:
“The plans of 1834 are on view....the building stood in a
paddock on the Towrang side of the Mulwaree, between Willow
Garden and the brickyards. After years of disuse and a refuge
at night for horses and cows, it was pulled down about 15 years
ago ”*
The appointment of the first police magistrate at Goul-
burn is referred to in a despatch from Governor Bourke to
the Rt. Hon. E. G. Stanley of the 3/12/1833:
“These appointments consist of that of Major Breton of the
4th Regiment to the Police Magistracy of Goulburn Plains,
Argyle, with a salary of £2OO per annum, and an allowance of
2/6 per day for forage, as he has two and may have three dis-
tant stations to attend.... the appointment of a police magis-
trate in Argyle, of which County Goulburn Plains is the central
and principal station, has become necessary from the increased
population of that part of the Colony and the number of Convict
servants spread over a great extent of country, from the diffi-
culty of finding a sufficient number of Persons qualified to hold
a commission of the Peace and disposed to act gratuitously, and
from the disinclination of those who have been appointed to
attend the Sessions, as often as circumstances require as to hold
them in places distant from their residences I take the
present opportunity of acknowledging the authorisation of the
appointment of Police Magistrates of which I have just availed
myself in the creation of a new Police Magistracy at Goulburn
Plains. ,,
Major Breton, however, never took up the task. Instead
Francis Allman, a retired officer, was appointed, on the
4/3/1834, at £3OO per annum, Major Breton being required
at headquarters.! Allman could not have held the appoint-
ment for long for three years later Governor Bourke was
writing to Stanley again (29/9/1836) :
“ 1 take this opportunity of observing that I find I shall
shortly be obliged to name a Stipendiary for Goulburne Plains

and probably for other places, where the increasing number of
Convicts and the disinclination of the Colonists to give up much
of their time to the discharge of Magisterial duty renders such
appointments indispensable.”!
George Stewart was appointed P.M. on the 1/7/1836
and held the office until the 31/12/1843. On the 18/1/1841
he was appointed Commissioner of the Court of Requests
and held that position until 1847.
The contractors for Goulburn’s first court house and
second gaol “having failed to secure the necessary Bond and
cannot now be found in Sydney,” fresh tenders were called
for in 1836.*
Goulburn was suggested as a place where Circuit Courts
should be held in a despatch, 4/9/1839, of Sir Geo. Gipps to
the Marquess of Normanby.f No action followed. T. P.
Besnard was clerk to the Bench in 1834, John Edwards on
the 10/2/1835 and Chas. E. Newcombe on the 13/10/1835.
On the 18/1/1841 Newcombe became also Registrar of the
Court of Requests. Sheriff’s officers and bailiffs were John
Brown 1839, Wm. Monypenny 1841, David Duncomb 1848,
and Wm. Hunt 1/1/1847. The chairman of the Bench in
the forties was Francis Murphy who then owned and lived
at Jacqua. At some time during the early forties the Argyle
Inn in Montague Street is said to have been used as the
magistrates’ court.
The Quarter Sessions book is a complete record of all
cases tried at the Quarter Sessions from 1848 to 1853. § The
record ceases then and from 1876 to 1883 the book is used
by the C.P.S. to record the despatch of returns and official
correspondence. The book begins on the 23/2/1848 when
Samuel Raymond was chairman and F. N. Rossi, F. R. L.
Rossi, J. F. Macarthur, Dr. Montgomerie and W. H. Hovell
magistrates. Andrew Morton was sworn in as a coroner,
three hawkers’ licenses were issued and nine prisoners were
tried. Seven were found guilty of larceny, assault or rob-
bery and received sentences ranging from one month’s hard
labour to four years’ hard labour on the roads. One was
sentenced “to be worked in irons for two years.” For
“burglary in a church” a prisoner on the 23/11/1852 re-
ceived 5 years’ hard labour on the roads. A woman received

six months for “stealing in a dwelling” “two days in
each week to be kept in solitary confinement.”
An annual meeting of Justices of the Peace for “taking
into consideration applications for Auctioneers’ licenses”
was held each year.*
George Stewart, J.P., Police Magistrate of Goulburn,
was appointed:
“for the purpose of acting in the preparation of Jury Lists. .. .
for the Circuit Court to be holden at the Town of Goulburn.”
The proclamation of the “Southern Circuit District”
was made on the 14/6/1847. Goulburn was then appointed
a Circuit Town and days fixed for the hearing of causes,
7/7/1847. By another proclamation of the 13/12/1847
Criminal and Civil Issues were directed to be tried at Circuit
Courts at Goulburn on the third of February and the first of
September each year.f The first circuit court held in Goul-
burn was on Saturday, 4th September, 1847. One account
states that the court was held in the Royal Hotel; another
that it was held at “Hillside.” It was preceded by all the
usual formalities associated with an English assize, including
divine service and a special sermon. A public dinner was
given to the Chief Justice, Sir A. Stephen, on the 6th, also
at the Royal Hotel. The bar on circuit was invited to com-
memorate the first circuit court in the district. The notice of
the dinner was signed by “Moss Marks, chairman and
secretary.” Tickets were obtainable at the Argyle and the
Australian Stores. “Not transferable.” The justice was
met by an immense crowd on horseback and in carriages
and escorted to his lodging at Mandelson’s “Goulburn
Hotel.” The court sat in a room “perfect in miniature”
but incapable of accommodating the public. The Attorney-
General and Messrs. Holroyd and Dowling were present, and
solicitors Kit son, Allman, Byles, Grant and Murray, t
Sir Alfred Stephen, at a dinner tendered to him by the
Goulburn magistrates in 1873 recalled his first visit to Goul-
burn. “He had four horses to his carriage and came in
some state.” He regretted to find that “one handsome
hotel (Mandelson’s) had been shut up.”§

Tenders for a court house in Goulburn were advertised
by the Colonial Architect on the 12/2/1847. Its building
occupied three years, £BBS was voted towards its cost in
1847, £7lB/5/- in 1848, and “Further expense of building”
£426/14/4 in 1849. The 1847 expenses included also an
amount of £350 for a watch house. #
E. B. Kitson, Clerk of the Peace, was himself fined £3
plus 8/- costs in default one month’s imprisonment in Goul-
burn gaol for an assault on John Simpson, schoolmaster and
lay-preacher, assistant to the Rev. Robert Cartwright at
Collector. He appears in the directory for 1853. f
In 1855 Edward Rogers held the appointment for “Cum-
berland, Goulburn and Bathurst.” In 1859/60 the Goulburn
Court met daily for ordinary business and “on the first
Monday of each alternate month, beginning with February,
for cases of debt.” The Registrar of the District Court in
the sixties was Temple F. S. Nathan. From 1872 F. R. L.
Rossi held this position. His tenure of this was as stormy
as his relations with the church and the military. In 1902
he brought an action against the Government to recover
£IO,OOO for services as District Registrar at Goulburn. Judg-
ment was given for the defendant.^
The following magistrates are listed as residing within
the police district of Goulburn in 1856:

C. S. Alexander was appointed C.P.S. in 1862 and P.M.
in 1883. The C.P.S. was charged with various duties. In
1862 he was concerning himself with the observance of the
Chinese Immigrants’ Regulations and Restrictions Act of
1861. He recommended the dismissal of Constable Tosney
for furnishing a false return of dogs destroyed. He was
responsible for the distribution of blankets to aborigines.
He arranged gold and specie escorts, and he took charge
of such gold pending the arrival of the escorts, despite the

John James Allman was Police Magistrate from 1862
to 1883. A boy of 14 was sent to gaol in 1879 for stealing
a bag worth 7/-. In sentencing him to seven days’ hard
labour the P.M. remarked that he would see that the prin-
cipal part of the time should be spent in solitary confine-
ment.!
In 1881 the Government promised to put £25,000 on the
estimates for 1882 to provide a new court house for Goul-
burn.
The law was guilty of no delay in the case of Edward
Roche, alias Cunningham, alias Shannahan. He was arrested
in Goulburn on the 12/9/1885, committed for trial on
the 14/9/1885, tried on the 15/9/1885 and sentenced to 14
years. The Crown Prosecutor stated that it would have
been possible to frame the charges as to have him liable to
a term of 1438 years.J

The present court house was opened by the Chief Jus-
tice, Sir Frederick Barley, on the 14/10/1887. The architect
was Barnet, colonial architect, and the contractor, David
Jones of Bathurst. The contract price was £24,593.§
At the opening of the present court house a banquet
was tendered to the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Barley.
A. M. Betts at that banquet said that before the old court
house was built:
“The court was situated on a flat across the creek; it having
been washed away by a flood, the authorities hired a room in
the house... .on the hill behind the Cathedral and in that room
the first Circuit Court was held.”*
The Petty Sessions business was conducted in the new
court house on the 12/3/1888. According to another ac-
count a fortnight later. The Hon. G. Long Innes declined to
proceed with the business of the court until the windows
were covered with blinds. In 1923 C. J. Holford handed
over for permanent custody by the municipal council the
red ensign flown from the Court House tower when it was
opened. J
Some savage sentences were inflicted in more recent
times. One Maria Brown was convicted and sentenced to
two months’ imprisonment for stealing a bottle of pepper-
mint, valued 9d. This was in 1900. The magistrate was
L. H. Fitzgerald.**
An elderly man, Herbert Rose was arrested in Goulburn
and charged on the 5/12/1927 with false pretences. He
admitted having obtained £IBOO for £SO shares in the “Rose
Self Acting Gravity Wheel” Company. The device was a
Perpetual Motion swindle. Several Goulburn people were
victimised. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment
upon each of six separate charges.||
The “Railway Dockets” case in 1934 was a cause
celebre. Wm. Hy. Lamb, Cyril James Dyball and Frank
Augustus Twyford were charged with systematically forg-
ing railway pay dockets. These were then discounted by
H. W. McGuire, W. A. Furner and A. N. Richardson. Large
sums of money were involved. McGuire’s claim was

losses at £9OOO. In all the transactions totalled £60,000.
After a hearing in Goulburn the accused were committed for
trial. The trial was held at Darlinghurst, before Judge
Thomson, Lamb and Dyball were found guilty of conspiracy
to defraud, and Twyford was found not guilty on all
charges.*
Goulburn Reformatory.
The first gaol in Goulburn was of rubble-stone construc-
tion built in 1827 or 1828. It was so badly built that within
a few years a second one, of slab or log, was built. The
date is uncertain but by 1835 this was in bad condition too.
Tenders were invited for a gaol at Goulburn in 1839. That
gaol was built in the early forties and stood on the site of
the present court house. The building of this gaol was much
delayed. At first a flood in the Jehoshaphat Valley damaged
the bricks and later there was a scarcity of labour. At the
same time the town lock-up stood in Auburn Street, on the
site of the present post office with the gaol immediately
behind and the stocks in front. X The lock-up in 1841 had
a total population of 51, 50 men and 1 woman. There were
3 free men and 1 free woman and 47 bond. Presumably
that one free man would be James Downes, the lock-up
keeper, and the free woman his wife.§
Wm. Smart was lock-up keeper in 1845. Another early
lock-up keeper, Wm. Leaviss, died in the Goulburn Hospital
on the 16/5/1848. Yet another lock-up keeper was Robert
Eaves. 1|
The proclamation of the “New Gaol” as a “public Gaol,
Prison and House of Correction for the said ‘Southern Cir-
cuit District’ ” appeared in 1847.** The gaol was surrounded
by a wall 20 feet high. On the wall were two watch towers
from which the sentries had a full view of the yards.
“The entrance to the gaol is by means of a pair of huge wooden
gates with a knocker and grating.”

Inside on the right was a guard-room, 3ft. x 12ft., fur-
nished with:
“all kinds of firearms, swords, handcuffs and other articles
that offenders against Society are often causing the use of.”
Opposite this was the office with a speaking trumpet
and bell communicating with the gaoler’s room above. Pass-
ing through a pair of iron gates the prison proper was
reached. The gaoler’s quarters occupied the front part,
separated from the gaol by about 30 feet. On the left was
the cook-house where there were three boilers of 40 gallons
each, one of 50 and “a handy stove by Slee of Sydney and
a brick oven.” Next came No. 1 post, with a warder on
duty having charge of the prisoners in the workshops. Five
prisoners were employed on the wood heap at this point.
The workshops were of wood with iron roofs “Over one of
the shops a patent gallows is kept.” There was a shoe-
maker’s shop, a carpenter’s shop, a bookbinder’s and
printer’s shop, a blacksmith and tinsmith’s shop, a tool house
and a paint shop. There was a school-room and library 20
feet x 14 feet with 8 prisoners in attendance.
Passing through another pair of wooden gates the store-
room was reached. “A huge lamp lights this place.” There
was a bathroom, 14 feet by 8 feet, with two plunge baths
and two showers with a barber’s shop attached. Water
came from a tank. Each prisoner had one bath a week
and one shave. In a washing yard, 308 feet xlO feet, all
the washing for the gaol and hospital was done. The water
came from an underground tank and a well. All the water
for drinking purposes had to be brought in from outside
the gaol. In the labour yard the prisoners were employed
stone breaking. The mess shed was 40 feet xl 5 feet. “A
high screen hides the closet accommodation from the view
of the new Post Office. ’ ’ Through another fence and double
gates was a garden growing fruit and vegetables.
The quarters (of wood) for the female prisoners opened
on to this garden. There was also a female hospital ward,
with a lavatory with four basins, a hot and cold water bath
with a cement floor. A sentry box accommodated Miss
Hopwood who “appears to have great command over her
charges.” In the yard was “a frame used for photograph-
ing prisoners.”
The main building was three stories in height, 150 feet x
40 feet. The female prisoners had to curtesy to the matron,


Mrs. Herbert, and the gaoler as they passed. The average
number of women prisoners was 15. They were mainly occu-
pied in washing and sewing. The average number of
prisoners was 100. #
In 1851 the Visiting Justice was J. F. Macarthur, the
gaoler Henry Foster, the matron Mrs. M. Foster, the surgeon
Robert Waugh and the clerk Wm. Riley, f
John Franklin was “a jailer” in 1854, and James
Mason "a jailor” in 1857. John Benton was “lock-up
keeper” that same year. Patrick Meagher, W. G-. Grovernor
and Donald Mackenzie were “turnkeys” at the gaol in the
sixties and Luke Cashman “Chief Warder.Thomas Hos-
ford was gaoler in 1868. Matthew Walker in 1871. There
were 214 men and 53 women in the gaol at this time, of whom
90 men and 25 women were unable to read or write. § A
boy of 13 was confined in the Goulburn gaol in 1874. Chas.
Major Fallick, an old soldier, was clerk and schoolmaster
for many years. He died in 1876 at the age of 70. ||
Goulburn would appear at this time to have had mixed
feelings about its gaol. A long article in the Goulburn
“Herald” of the 16/9/1876, is quite patriotic about the
institution, its size and its achievements, but dubious as to
whether it was a suitable adornment for the very centre
of the city.
In some reminiscences Jonathan Wilson recalled:
“The gaol which was situated slightly off Auburn Street, behind
the present post office or town hall and.... the time when a man
named Cunningham, serving a life sentence, attempted to kill
a warder with a door hinge, and was hanged for the crime.
Cunningham.... did not appear to be unduly alarmed at the
prospect and made an impudent retort to the judge as sentence
was delivered**
The late E. C. Manfred reported the public execution of
Cunningham for the “Sydney Morning Herald.” Cunning-
ham and the hangman were dressed in white and Dean
Sowerby was there in his surplice.

The following constituted the local authorities:

foreman: Timson, plus 10 ordinary warders and female
warders.*
The Auburn Street gaol remained in use until 1884. It
usually contained 110 prisoners, 100 men and 10 women.
Just before the present reformatory was built a military
camp was held upon the site. A working party of prisoners
in charge of an armed guard was sent out to prepare the
site. The prisoners returned to the gaol in the late after-
noon with the warder in the handcart. The official ex-
planation was “sunstroke. The present reformatory was
built in 1883. The contractor was Frederick Lemm and
the architect James Burnett of the Colonial Architect’s De-
partment. The contract was for £57,000 but extras brought
the cost up to £61,000. Since 1884 considerable moneys
have been spent on alterations and improvements. On the
4/8/1883 the contractor entertained 150 to lunch in the com-
pleted building and in the afternoon the Mayor, the Premier
Band and 200 visitors were present.
So many people wanted to see the new gaol that the
contractor charged a fee and gave the proceeds to the
hospital. The gaol was proclaimed on the 1/7/1884. Ac-
commodation was provided for women prisoners, a two-
storey building with 16 cells on each floor. Twenty female
prisoners, mostly girl vagrants, were amongst the first in-
mates :
“A crowd met them at the station. The prisoners made running
comments on all and sundry and departed singing to their new
quarters/”

There were many executions in Goulburn from 1830 to
1854. Since 1854 there have been 18. The first execution
in the Goulburn Gaol after its proclamation as a prison was
that of James Talbot on the 30/5/1854. The first woman
executed there was Mary Ann Brownlow on the 11/10/1855.
The last execution in Goulburn was that of John Slay on
the 15/12/1900.* Talbot tried to escape from gaol and was
recaptured by Jacobs, a German-Jew storekeeper. At the
enquiry C. H. Walsh, the lawyer, tried to take a rise out
of Jacobs by asking him how he felt when he saw Talbot
coming towards him. “Veil,” said Jacobs, “Mr. Balsh, I
will answer that question if you tell the court how you veil
ven the robbers took the breeches off you on Breadalbane
Plains.”! Women and children were permitted to witness
public executions.^
MacAlister describes the public execution of Talbot for
a murder committed at Binalong. Prisoner and hangman
were dressed in white and Dean Sowerby attended in sur-
plice. §
Hawthorne was hanged at Goulburn Gaol in 1874 for
a series of murders. A Mrs. Monks, who murdered her
husband whilst in a state of intoxication, and burned his
body, was executed here.
Other Goulburn crimes were those of John Healey, for
robbery under arms, sentenced at Darlinghurst on the
9/2/1863 to fifteen years’ hard labour on the roads, the first
year in irons. William Munday, alias Collins was sentenced
to death and executed at Goulburn on the 8/4/1868, for five
brutal murders at Conroy’s Gap near Yass. The evidence
went to shew that he was insane, nevertheless he was found
guilty and executed.||
In addition to the foregoing executions there were Pat-
rick Walsh for murder, on the 4/9/1857; Frederick Clarke
for murder, on the 8/5/1860; Win. Johnstone for rape, on
the 3/12/1861; Mahammet Casson for murder, on the
25/5/1863; Henry Sues, a chinaman, for the murder of a
compatriot, executed on the 10/12/1866 ;** John Glover for
murder, on the 18/5/1874. On the subject of executions at

the old gaol the late John Horton, who was born in 1848,
wrote:
“The first man I saw hanged (at the old gaol) was Talbot for
the murder of a man near Yass. After killing him, Talbot
took his kidneys out, fried them in a pan and ate them. The
man he killed was Barry. I saw Mrs. Brownlow hung, also
Mrs. Monk, both for killing their husbands. Then there was
‘ Scabby Harry’ Munday, Glover and Hawthorn, all hanged
inside the gaol.”*
The executions of Hawthorne and Glover on the
19/5/1874 are described in the usual detail in the press.
However the “Penny Post” did say:
“. ... the erection of the screen which extended along the wall
of the gaol facing Auburn Street and which excluded the scene
from the view of passers-by in that thoroughfare, was due to the
excellent foresight of our worthy Police Magistrate, J. J. All-
man, Esq.”
The “Penny Post” thought such scenes “are liable to
have a demoralising effect upon the observers, more espec-
ially on the minds of young people.”!
The execution of a Chinaman, Ing Chee, for murder on
the 28/5/1878 is described in revolting detail. Forty people
were present. There were many others outside the gaol
who sought admission but were refused. In Auburn Street
others assembled in the hopes of “getting a glimpse of the
scene. ’ ’ The authorities foiled them by enclosing the upper
part of the scaffold with tarpaulins. They had the excite-
ment of seeing the cross beam to which the rope was
attached. Ing Chee was buried in the Presbyterian
cemetery.
In 1878 imprisonment in irons was still in force. John
Glass, sentenced to death, had his sentence commuted to
life, “the first three years to be served in irons.
The last execution in the old gaol was that of Charles
Cunningham on the 29/11/1882. The first execution in the
new gaol was that of John Sleigh, alias Wood, alias Quinlan,
for murder, on the 5/1/1900. The Goulburn “Herald”
devoted a column to the execution and revealed that the
gaol authorities provided the press representatives with a
table and writing materials. As usual the report concluded
“the unhappy man was launched into eternity.”§

The execution of Mary Ann Brownlow was such a
ghastly miscarriage of justice and was accompanied by such
callous brutality as to merit longer treatment. The follow-
ing are some contemporary accounts and notes.
“On Thursday, (11th October 1855) the last sentence of the law
was carried into effect on Mary Ann Brownlow, who, it will be
remembered, was convicted at the sitting of the Circuit Court,
on the 11th September, of the murder of her husband. Every
exertion had been made to avert, if possible, the carrying out
of the extreme penalty, but without success. On the arrival
of the mail from Sydney, on Wednesday evening, the Post Office
was besieged by persons anxiously enquiring if a reprieve had
arrived. When it was found that such was not the case,
several parties obtained an interview with the Under-Sheriff, to
procure, if possible, a postponement of the execution from nine
until four o’clock, with a faint hope that some unforeseen occur-
rence might have prevented a reprieve being sent until the next
day. The Under-Sheriff with the greatest possible courtesy,
acceded to the urgent request. The following morning at nine
o’clock multitudes assembled on an adjacent hill to witness the
execution, but it soon transpired that a delay had taken place,
though by many it could not be accounted for until the arrival
of the Sydney mail before three o’clock p.m. Mr. Roberts, the
contractor, having sent instructions the preceding evening to
hasten its arrival. No reprieve, however arrived, and the
people, many females being among the number, again assembled,
several obtaining admission within the walls of the gaol. The
unfortunate woman accompanied by the Rev. W. Sowerby, who
has been her constant and zealous attendant since her imprison-
ment, and the usual attendants walked with a firm step from
her cell to the scaffold. On ascending the steps, owing to the
length of her dress, she tripped, when she turned and explained
the cause. Her firmness and resignation were a surprise to
the bystanders, about thirty in number. She shook hands with
the gaoler, Mr. Foster, and the Rev. W. Sowerby, without a
struggle, acknowledging the greatness of her crime, as well as
the justness of her sentence. During the afternoon nearly the
whole of the stores were closed, and the town presented quite
a solemn and funereal appearance.”*
Another account states that Mary Ann Brownlow was
only 18 when she married George Moore Brownlow, a
waster.f The marriage was a failure. He swindled her
out of a little property. When she was 22, in the course
of a quarrel she took up a carving knife and stabbed him.
Quite unexpectedly he died. She was tried by Sir Alfred
Stephen on the 11/9/1855, who advised the jury that it was
the most foul and brutal murder he had ever tried. Goul-
burn worked hard for a reprieve but without effect. The
day of her execution the stores closed and the town was

t St. Saviour’s Burial register says 23 on 18/5/1855.


hung with crepe. Her third child was born in gaol and,
worst horror of all, she was allowed to feed her baby on the
scaffold. * She was hanged at 4 p.m. on the 11/10/1835 and
is buried in the old St. Saviour’s cemetery. The Goulburn
“Herald” printed two and a half columns of harrowing
detail of the execution, whilst Dean Sowerby preached a
funeral sermon from Hebrews XI-4. “He being dead yet
speaketh. ”f
A public meeting at the Commercial Hotel was held to
subscribe a purse of money for Payne and Waterworth for
speeding up the Berrima-Goulburn coach on behalf of the
citizens hoping to receive a reprieve for Mrs. Brownlow.J
The execution of Mary Ann Brownlow was recalled by
Sir Henry Parkes in the Assembly, in a memorable speech,
33 years afterwards on the 23/12/1888. There were howls
of indignation from all sides of the house when he described
how “just before passing to the hangman she gave her baby
its last meal at her breast.” The “Evening News” stated
that “old Goulburn residents recalling the execution say
they never heard of the incident alluded to by Sir Henry. ”§
Writing of the execution of “Scabby Harry,” W. A. G.
Brander recalled that he was “an extra tall blackfellow”
and that when he was hung
“standing head and shoulders over the wall, the grim picture
could be viewed by all who passed along the street.” (Auburn
Street).
He mentioned also
“the screams of a woman who was paying the extreme
penalty.” 1|
Two prisoners were flogged for assaulting warders in
1893. The flogger was brought from Sydney. Questions
were asked in parliament as to the propriety of the punish-
ment.
Further cases of assaulting warders occurred soon after-
wards, one of the original offenders repeating his crime. One
prisoner received 15 lashes and “six months’ coercion.”
Two others were sentenced to 48 days’ imprisonment “in the
dark cells and to separate treatment.” The prisoners
demonstrated when Cox was flogged and kept up a “yelling
and boo-hooing until 9 p.m.**

A long sentence prisoner in the gaol perpetrated a
strange freak in 1893. He was employed in the tailor’s
shop making warders’ uniforms. One afternoon he rode
up to the main gates, dressed as a warder, with a long
moustache, carefully waxed at the ends, formed out of one
of the gaol brushes. The governor tore oft the moustache
and the warders unseated him. Whether he really ex-
pected to get away or whether he intended it as a joke did
not appear to be clear at the time. #
The "Yass Tribune” and the "Goulburn Evening
Penny Post” described as a "curious spectacle,” in 1908,
ten prisoners for the Reformatory disembarked at the North
Goulburn station from the Sydney train "all chained in
couples or singly by the legs, clanking as they walked, and
in addition chained by the hands.”!
In March, 1910, Peter Bowling, one of the coal strike
leaders, was sent to the Goulburn Reformatory. With in-
credible folly he was despatched wearing leg-irons, a pro-
ceeding which not only shocked the general public but
turned the Wade Government out of office and put Labour
in power for the first time. Marmion H. Dart, now editor of
the "Goulburn Evening Post,” was the junior reporter who
released this "scoop.”
Messrs. Burns and Lewis, strike leaders, were imprisoned
in Goulburn gaol in 1910. They were incarcerated under
the "Amended Industrial Disputes Act,” commonly known
as the "Coercion Act.” Unexpectedly released they were
entertained at a public banquet. A few weeks later Peter
Bowling was welcomed.:]:
The Gaol authorities were guilty of a piece of vandalism
in 1924. The original Napier printing press upon which
Sir Henry Parkes printed the "Empire” had been used for
many years in the gaol. The Government decided to replace
it with a modern plant and the old press was taken to the
Goulburn Foundry and dumped as scrap. §
Upon the retirement of Judge Scholes from the District
Court Bench in 1928, a suggestion was made by him that

provision should be made for the incarceration of first of-
fenders in an institution which did not bear the title of gaol
and in consequence of this suggestion the title of “Goulburn
Gaol” was altered to “Goulburn Reformatory” on the
31/7/1928. Some trouble and disaffection at the Reforma-
tory caused a stir in July, 1939. There were no serious
results.

Lieut. McAlister commanding the 2nd Division of the
Mounted Police was stationed at Goulburn Plains by a
General Order of His Excellency the Governor on the
16/10/1830. f Few records exist for the first slab-built police
station and lock-up at North Goulburn. There were bar-
racks and accommodation for the Mounted Police in the
vicinity of “Riversdale” from about 1827. They are
mentioned repeatedly from 1836 onwards. The mounted
and foot police were distinct organisations and in their
earlier days controlled by different authorities.
A careful examination of the Police paddock to the
north of the present Reformatory and between it and
“Riversdale,” upon the spot marked on old maps as
“Mounted Police,” reveals several traces of former build-
ings. The line of two such can be seen, one of which has
the foundation of an old fireplace. There is also something
which looks like a filled-in well. An old horseyard can be
seen, at some later date converted into a cow-bail. The
gate-posts of this yard are obviously of a great age. Mounted

Police stationed at “Goulburn Plains’ ’ in 1834 comprised
“one subaltern, 1 serjeant, 13 rank and file.”*
On the 18/5/1835 the Legislative Council appointed a
Select Committee to report upon the establishment and
strength of the police in all its branches, etc., its cost and
additional buildings, etc. required. Lachlan McAlister, J.P.,
gave evidence on the 2/6/1835. He stated that there was
a stone lock-up house, 26 x 10 feet which “became a heap
of rubbish, in consequence of its bad construction, although
not built before 1827 or 1828.” This was replaced by a
small log building in which 20/30 prisoners were confined.
He added that 19 policemen were insufficient, 30 mounted
policemen were required. His pay as lieutenant in the
Mounted Police was 11/6 a day, 2/6 a day forage allowance
and quarters or £SO when unprovided with quarters.
Captain Rossi (F. N. the elder) on the 10/6/1835 said
“there is no gaol at Goulburn; a very insecure W.B. build-
ing or hut is used as a lock-up house from which it would
be an easy matter to escape.” Andrew Gibson on the
11/6/1835 confirmed this evidence and added “the police at
present consist of nine ordinary constables, a lock-up house
keeper and a scourger” and that the lock-up “contains no
separate place for the custody of females.” He asked for
a stipendiary magistrate and a chief constable. Captain
Williams, commandant of the Mounted Police on the
25/6/1835, stated the strength of the Goulburn force as
21 mounted and 4 unmounted constables.!
The Mounted Police are shewn in the census return of
1841 as follows:

The second watch house and the stocks were then
erected in Auburn Street upon a site now occupied by the
Post Office, in front of the old gaol. Watch house, stocks
and gaol were in use in 1841. Another old Government
watch-box is said to have stood near a baker’s shop in the
south end of Auburn Street, not far from the old Chequers
Inn,
Samuel Horne was appointed Chief Constable in 1836,
a month later James Jordan was appointed. Thomas Bond
appears in 1837. T. Bird was gazetted in 1838. John
MTntosh was appointed in 1840. He was killed at the
Towrang Stockade by being thrown out of his gig. His
funeral on the 8/7/1841 was followed “by a most respectable
company of mourners.” Wm. Hunt was Chief Constable
in 1843. He enlisted in the 29th Regt. on the 22/1/1820 and
was discharged in Sydney on the 24/10/1830. He was Chief
Constable at Parramatta before coming to Goulburn.*
John Reid, “Publican of the Breadalbane Inn’ was
fined £5 and 3/6 costs on the 23/7/1839 in that he did
“Sell and Deliver to one William Jones one Gill of Brandy,
the said William Jones being in a State of intoxication and an
assigned Servant to James Manning Esquire, of Cumbramura.”
The summons was served by Jno. MTntosh, Chief Con-
stable and the fine was inflicted by Geo. Stewart and Andrew
Gibson. §
A party of Lieut. Waddy’s police under Corporal Smith
arrested four bushrangers, including Wm. Cain, on the
19/12/1839. f
The Marulan correspondent of the “Monitor” reported
the apprehension of three runaways from the Towrang
ironed gang 4
A public meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on the
4/5/1850 to express indignation and dissatisfaction with the
police and the protection they afforded the public. The
Goulburn “Herald” published long columns complaining
that the police, instead of protecting life and property, were
acting as “summons-servers” for the “Crown Land Com-
mission.” This took them off their regular street work

as did “loitering round hotels,” “impounding goats” and
“lagging drunkards to watch-houses.” Dr. Nicholson took
the chair at the meeting and a series of resolutions were
carried addressed to Governor Fitzroy and the Legislative
Council. J. Bull, R. Craig, Emanuel, Mandelson, J
Collins, J. Martyr and Kitson took part. The subsequent
petition declared that 11 police were insufficient and that
2/3 per diem would not attract the right sort. #
Through Goulburn passed all the traffic for the south
and the Lambing Flat Goldfields in particular. In 1861
there marched through Auburn Street ankle deep in mud,
the infantry, artillery and mounted police, nearly 200 in all,
called out to deal with the Lambing Flat riots. George
William Goodchild, a teamster, took his team to Lambing
Flat the day after the riots. He described how
“at various points along the route were Chinamen’s Pig-tails.” t
Ten of the rioters were brought back to Goulburn for
trial but were acquitted, so that the change of venue did
not avail much.
The Duty Book of the Goulburn Mounted Police is
preserved at Police Headquarters, Goulburn. The “special
occurrences” column is largely concerned with the straying
and escape of the Poliqe horses from the Police paddock.
“Church Parade” was a regular duty of the Superintendent,
Sergeants and Constables. The “Rules and Regulations
for the Government and Guidance of the Mounted Patrols
of New South Wales” (1853) is a modest pamphlet of 36
pages only. Rule 29 runs:
“The men at outstations, when in quarters, will invariably
parade on Sundays in full dress, (with swords) and when
practicable attend Divine Service.”
There are many references to bushrangers and armed
robberies. The following are typical entries:
“18/2/1863, when armed and masked robbers stuck up Thomas
I. Lodge of Bredalben Plains, Publican,” and “Mr. Hilton’s
Public House, Bredalben Plains.”
On the 8/6/1863:
“Senior Constable Wm. Hughes No. 307, received a pistol
wound in the left arm below the elbow from a party of three
bushrangers, four miles north of Pejar.”
* Gbn. “Herald,” 27/4/1850.
t “E.P.P.,” 17/6/1929.


There were a few breaches of discipline to record:
Senior Constable No. 307 was on “prisoner escort duty” for
two days in August 1862. The next two days he is shown
as “sick,” but in the “special occurrences” column it is
noted that he “returned off prisoner escort drunk at mid-
night on the 28th instant having lost his revolver and
sword.” Constable No. 308 on the 29th “found the arms
lost by 307.”
There is a note on the 3/1/1863 to the effect that:
“The mail from Goulburn to Sydney was robbed at the top
of Governor’s Hill, a mile and a half from town by two armed
men.... ”
And on the 4/1/1863 that Senior Sergeant Stephenson
had made one arrest in this connection.
The foot police at Goulburn in 1862/3 consisted of a
senior sergeant, senior constable and five constables. The
senior constable was the lock-up keeper. As for the mounted
police, church parades were compulsory. With the excep-
tion of the senior sergeant and senior constable, all the foot
police were on town patrol duty. Abraham Kershaw was
senior sergeant in 1862, R. Fenton in 1863. In the Duty
Book of the foot police is an account of the mail robbery
on the 3/7/1863. At that time the Mounted Patrol con-
sisted of a Superintendent, a Senior Inspector, a Senior Ser-
geant, a Sergeant, a Senior Constable, six Constables and
fourteen horses.
Armed robberies by a man “on foot, armed with a gun,”
who said “your life or your money” and who had “Crape
on his face” took place on various roads near Goulburn on
the 27/7/1863, 28/7/1863 and 31/7/1863. A somewhat
strange occurrence was reported on 7/8/1863. Senior Con-
stable Murphy and Constable Molloy arrested John Cummins
at Bolong. Cummins was charged with “robbery with
firearms. ’ ’
“And when about 8 miles from Cummins’ place a shot was
fired from ambush which killed Cummins instantaneous, this
occurred on Thursday the 6th inst., at between 10 and 11 o’clock
within h mile of Patrick Buries of Thalaba.”
An inquest was held on the 10/8/1863, when the verdict
was “murder by some person or persons unknown.”
On the 29/8/1863, Sergeant Stephenson shot Frederick
Lowry the bushranger and arrested Larry Cummins.


£164/19/6 was found in Lowry’s pockets, £152 of which was
stolen from the Mudgee mail and £3O from Captain Murphy
at the Goulburn mail robbery. Lowry had escaped from
the Bathurst gaol on the 24/8/1863.
In 1865 the Patrol was divided, a Superintendent, Senior
Sergeant, Senior Constable and eight Constables remaining
at the “Goulburn Police Station,” i.e., in the Old Township,
and three constables being allotted to the “Town Station-
Mounted Police.” That division ceased on the 27/1/1866.
The Duty Book shews considerable time and mileage ex-
pended on the Gold Escorts from Braidwood to Goulburn.
A typical roster of duty is that in the week ending the
12/1/1867: on the Sunday, the Superintendent, Senior Ser-
geant, Senior Constable and two constables were on Church
Parade, one Constable was on “bush duty,” in the Aber-
crombie, one “special duty” at Braidwood, one was “Post
Orderly” another “stable guard,” and yet another “collect-
ing the Electoral Roll.” The foot police had some queer
duties too, e.g., “Constable Robert Walker No. 373 com-
menced to take the return of Private Schools. The same
constable also “brought 9 dog’s tails to the Senior Sergeant
this evening to be destroyed which was done accordingly.”
There are, of course, numerous references to “prisoner
escort,” “gold escort,” and fires. Another queer duty was
when Senior Sergeant Fenton and Constable Walker seized
and removed 3066 lbs. of powder from Davies and Alex-
anders’ Store. Davies and Alexander were summoned, the
powder forfeited and a fine of 25/- per lb. imposed. The
Bench ordered 2 cwt. to be given back. The powder was
removed in several loads to the Old Township, and sub-
sequently sold by P. Dignam at the Salutation Inn. Another
duty which is not quite clear now is recorded thus:
“M. Constable Michael Morgan No. 1495, James Sutherland No.
1540, and Begland Lineham No. 1555 arrived from Sydney.
Commenced that day to do special duty at the Bank by order
of the Superintendent.”
Probably this was a gold escort.
There are several references to the “summonses”
against Gilbert, Hall and Dunn. A little sly-grog selling
went on in the country districts.


Captain Zouch, superintendent of the South Eastern
District, issued the following instructions:
“The six pairs of lock leg-irons now at the Goulburn Lock-up
are to be regarded as station property and invariably returned
to it after use. They are to be used by the Police in escorting
and securing prisoners in their custody when not in rivet irons
and whose safety would be risked in handcuffs or on the chain
only.”
On the 2/5/1866 “The Honorable the Colonial Secretary,
Mr. Parkes, accompanied by Mr. Edward Flood and the Rev.
Wm. Ridley, visited the Goulburn Lock-up and inspected
the same.”
The pro-Cathedral of St. Saviour was broken into on
the 8/8/1866 and its communion vessels stolen.*
A curious transaction was the production of a bag of
bones in court. The prisoner was Henry Grass and the
bones were supposed to be those of Alexander Ketter. The
prisoner was discharged because Senior Sergeant Richards
was too drunk to give evidence. The bag of bones was
then buried “underneath the window on the south side of
the Goulburn lock-up about 3 feet below the surface and
close to the wall.”
A prisoner named Stewart was being taken under es-
cort from Goulburn to Deniliquin to give evidence at Denili-
quin when he slipped away from his guard while the coach
was changing horses. He made his escape between Wagga
and Deniliquin. f
A visitor to Goulburn in 1871 wrote:
“The police force of Goulburn is different from that I have
seen in any town. They have a light, easy, jaunty way of
going about, altogether different from that of your phlegmatic
Sydney Policeman. The Goulburn police consult ease and com-
fort. You may look and wait until the crack of doom and
then you will not see one single sample of the stiff-starched,
buttoned-up constable who looks like a soldier who has exchanged
his red coat for a blue one.”
It would be interesting to know whether this English
visitor's criticism had any foundation. He goes on to say:
“The Goulburn police are more like half-pay naval officers of
the olden time, or of a Greenwich hospital man on a cruise, than
a N.S.W. policeman. Only by his buttons did I know him.
But for these I would never have taken him for what he is.
And he never interferes in what does not concern him.”
* “111. Syd. News,” 16/8/1866.
f “111. Syd. News,” 31/10/1868.


“ Jay-walking” did not trouble the police in those days.
This English visitor added:
“The Goulburn people do not walk. That mode of progression
is considered vulgar. Only the artisan, the mechanic and the
labourer walk. To go only twenty yards a horse has to be
saddled or a buggy brought out.”*
The “new” police barracks were built in 1874 “opposite
the Goulburn Hospital. ’ ’ R. Turner was the contractor for
the excavation and foundation; Thos. Wilkie for their erec-
tion at a cost of £2239/15/-. In later years these buildings
were the headquarters of the railway Loco. Department.!
The administration of justice left something to be de-
sired even sixty years ago. John Jones was charged with
being of unsound mind. Defendant was too ill to be brought
into court. Constable McLoughlan deposed to finding him
apparently dying in a wheel-barrow. Sent to gaol for 14
days.!
In the matter of £l5 stolen from the landlady of a Goul-
burn Hotel, Police Inspector Fenton cross-examining witness
enquired of the landlady of the hotel: “Where is your bed-
room?” Reply: “Oh Mr. Fenton, surely you know where
my bedroom is!” “Yes,” replied the Inspector, “but the
Bench wish to know too.”§
There were some ghastly punishments inflicted at the
Goulburn Lock-up in comparatively recent times. On the
13/6/1884 one Joseph M’Gare, alias Johnson, Jones, and
Williams, was flogged in the yard of the court house.
Warder Trigg, of the Goulburn Gaol, wielded the “cat” and
the local press remarked “appeared to have considerable
acquaintance with his work” Half a column is devoted
to the most ghastly description of the punishment, the con-
vulsive twitching of the victim’s body, his moaning, his
bleeding and the lacerations inflicted.
“Crowds had collected round the Court house during the pro-
ceedings and the number of each stroke as indicated by Con-
stable Emmerton was re-echoed throughout the adjacent
reserve.”!!
In the criminal photographs at the Goulburn Police
station are two of Thomas Heffernan, who escaped from the
Gaol on the 30/8/1877. One is with a full beard and there
is a note that he was clean-shaven when he escaped.

Goulburn police were sent to Sydney during the strike
of 1890.*
Police accommodation in Goulburn has always been
somewhat inconveniently divided. In the earliest days the
mounted police were in the old township and the foot police
in the new. Later the police barracks were in Sloane Street,
opposite the old hospital site and the present superinten-
dent’s buildings. When the old hospital site was resumed
in 1907 the “new police buildings” were authorised “not
to exceed £20,000. ”f The police station adjoining the Lands
Department was built for other purposes in 1888. From
time to time there have been suggestions to accomodate all
police activities upon the one site but so far nothing has
come of these proposals.
The Fire Brigade.*
The early history of fire fighting in Goulburn is obscure.
The first fire brigade was a semi-private venture of Wood-
ward the landlord of the Commercial and a partner in the
firm of Bull and Woodward. This was in 1854. A manual
fire engine was either made or assembled in Sydney that
year to the order of Woodward. This “engine” used by
this brigade is said to have been in use much later at North
Goulburn when Goulburn had two fire stations. §
The “arrival of the First Fire Engine in Goulburn” did
not go unnoticed in the local press. Woodward was credited
with giving £2OO for it. It “required 14 men to work it,
but could manage with less.” It was given “a successful
test on the banks of the Mulwaree Ponds.”
The report concluded “much praise is due to Woodward
for not waiting for the Sydney Insurance Company to send
up an engine.”
An advertisement addressed to those anxious to “secure
their own risks” read:
“Notice.
All interested in preservation of property from Fire are asked
to attend a preliminary meeting to establish a Fire Brigade.
Meeting at Salutation Inn 19/9/1854.” ||
Apparently that effort to establish a brigade was not
immediately successful for in 1855 further attempts were
made to form a volunteer fire brigade. By 1860 this brigade

had fallen on bad times for on the 20th February that year
its secretary wrote to the Municipal Council asking it to
take over the engine and the “ funds ” under its control and
also requesting the Council “to make regulations for the
storage of gunpowder in a public magazine.’ ’
Both requests were refused. With delightful sarcasm
the municipal council substituted the word “liabilities” for
“funds” in its rejection.
Pressure continued to be made on the Council to under-
take the responsibility for fire prevention but the Council
remained uninterested. In 1870 a second-hand engine was
offered to the Council for £2OO. A little later the Depart-
ment of Lands enquired if the Municipal Council “were will-
ing to act as trustees for the lands dedicated for fire engine
purposes.”
The next year, with commendable zeal, but in deplor-
able English, Alderman White moved:
“That the Council resolve itself into a Committee of the whole
for the purpose of considering and reporting on the advisability
or otherwise of the best means to be adopted with respect to the
Fire Engines (now useless) on account of not being kept in
proper order.”
The motion, after considerable discussion, was with-
drawn.
Two months later the Council enquired:
“Of Messrs. R. Craig, R. H. Blatchford, and J. Martin for
further information relative to the Fire Engines before the
Council decided whether they would take charge of them or
not. ”
These engines, of course, were somewhat primitive
manual pumps mounted upon a cart. From the correspond-
ence and press reports of the time both were in bad order,
one much worse than the other.
That there were some other stirrings on the subject is
evident from a letter addressed by the Board of Manage-
ment of the “Insurance Companies Fire Brigade, Sydney”
to the Municipal Council on the 23/7/1871:
“That on the establishment of an efficient Fire Brigade in Goul-
burn the Board would be willing to contribute an equal amount
annually with the Town Council towards the maintenance of
such Brigade.”
Nothing was done however. In 1872 a motion that a
Fire Engine be bought for £226 was defeated. Another that
the Fire Engines “now in Goulburn” be “put in proper
repair as at present they are useless” was also lost.


A similar motion arising out of “MacAlister’s fire” was
also defeated.
The Fire Brigade was altogether defunct in 1874. The
disastrous fire at the Bank of New South Wales that year
was handled, and handled most inefficiently, by unorganised
volunteers. Water was very scarce. The first supply came
from a cask in Dr. Hayley’s yard. Two private “engines”
attended, Davies Alexander and Coy’s, and Emanuel’s. The
fire started in the roof, giving time for the removal of docu-
ments, books and cash and some household effects to the
Commercial Bank. Some equipment, including two “valu-
able ladders” of the old brigade was used and disappeared.
After the fire, Joseph Collins advertised that he had a
sum of money belonging to the Old Brigade and was pre-
pared to distribute it amongst the watermen who attended
the fire.
In 1876 Wm. Davies, then mayor, formed a Volunteer
Fire Brigade. A public meeting was held in the Council
chamber on the 14/6/1876 to form a brigade “in connection
wuth the Council but not solely controlled by the same.”
The Insurance Companies were prepared to contribute to-
wards the cost of an engine (£270) provided the Council
guaranteed it would be properly cared for and a Brigade
formed to work it. A further meeting was held on the
16/6/1876 which decided to repair the old engine and draw
up rules for a Brigade.^
The “Herald” spread itself in a leader on the subject
of fire brigades in general and the part and responsibility
of the Insurance Companies in their maintenance. It ad-
vised its readers to insure their property, to study Fire
Insurance policies and thus be convinced of the wisdom of
a Brigade and of supporting it consistently.!
The brigade obtained a new engine in 1876 which was
bought from Charles Bown’s Sydney brigade. The railway
brought it up freight-free. On its arrival in Goulburn it
was unloaded from the truck, horses harnessed to it and a
procession formed. The procession consisted of the volun-
teers’ band, the member for Goulburn, the superintendent
of the brigade, the members of the Municipal Council, the

Sydney and Goulburn firemen, the city watermen with their
carts, the honorary firemen and the general public.
The procession halted opposite the Mechanics’ Institute
where the Mayoress “appropriately named” the engine
“The Southern Queen. ” It was not a steam engine. Which
prompted the “Herald” to remark that the water supply
was inadequate for a steam engine anyhow. The Brigade
was exhorted to be “loyal to the voluntary work and strict
in regard of rules. ”*
The new brigade was soon in trouble. In 1877 it
approached the Municipal Council for help. A motion that
no payments be made to or on behalf of the Fire Brigade
was defeated. Instead the “Fire Brigade Accounts” were
paid together with “the debt upon the new fire engine.”
A week later the Council appointed Wm. Davies superin-
tendent of the Fire Brigade. Some opposition was en-
countered. Alderman 0 ’Brien went to the length of calling
a public meeting to protest against “the Citizens’ rates
being used in support of the Volunteer Fire Brigade.”!
By 1880 the position was obscure again. In answer to
enquiries the Mayor stated (a) that the fire brigade account
was overdrawn £l7/15/2, (b) that he did not know what
property belonged to the brigade and (c) whether it was in
“a condition for efficient work.” Yet at this time the
brigade was known as the “Municipal Fire Brigade.”
An application was made to the Government for a grant
of £SOO for a new station, which at that time it was con-
templated building on the old site in Auburn Street.
There are further contradictory references to Fire
Brigade matters in the Municipal Council’s minutes for 1881.
At one time the Council appears to be responsible for
the Brigade. At others it appears to repudiate respon-
sibility altogether. It erected a fire bell at the corner of
Bradley and Grafton Streets.
The Municipal Council seems to have tired of its
interest in Fire Brigade matters for on the 25/4/1882 it
arranged for a public meeting to be held to put the Brigade
on a better footing.
The meeting consisted of “Subscribers to the Fire
Brigade, Insurance Agents, Volunteers and the Public.”
* Gbn. “ Herald, ” 21/10/1876, 25/10/1876.

Wm. Davies was elected trustee representing the Insurance
Companies and J. T. Gannon and Solomon Meyer trustees
representing the subscribers. At a further meeting held
a week later, Jas. Brownhill, the acting secretary, reported
that there was £97/17/6 in hand and a further £l2 promised.
The brigade was then re-organised as follows:
One superintendent, two captains, four engineers, six-
teen firemen, a hose-reel company of four, a hook and ladder
company of six, an honorary secretary and treasurer and a
committee of management. James Main was elected super-
intendent, whilst E. Gillespie and R. Fletcher we ( re ap-
pointed Captains of Numbers 1 and 2 engines respectively.
The secretary was E. R. Laws and the treasurer James
Brownhill. The first firemen were H. Matthews, Wills,
Cassidy, Balter, Casson, Sammon, Falls, Davidson, Lever,
G. Moss, Nye, Lockhard, McGovern, Kain, D. Smith, W.
Young, G. Taylor, M. Fowler, W. Thompson, A. Mitchell,
J. McDonald, R. Davis and C. Martin.
All this re-organisation arose out of a shocking display
of ineptitude at a fire in Auburn Street, the previous Jan-
uary. One newspaper remarked:
“Some time after the engines arrived, and after seeing the
efforts to subdue a fire we are convinced that they are utterly
inadequate, and that the sooner they are burnt themselves, the
better for the city/’*
The City Solicitor was instructed to prepare a lease of
the Fire Engines to the new Fire Brigade Trustees. Never-
theless the Council that year placed £l6O on its estimates
for a shed to house the fire engines and a new bell.
At this time there were two engines belonging to the
Brigade. No. 1 engine was a Shand Mason with spring
lever fastenings and a pole to accommodate two horses. The
No. 2 engine (kept at North Goulburn) was an older
machine with clip fastenings on levers and was drawn
by one horse. They were manual engines drawing their
water from a canvas tank which was filled and refilled by
the water carts.
Later when the town water supply was available manual
pumping gave way to the use of hydrants and two hose
reels and scaling ladders were added to the equipment.
These were hooked on to the first cab available, the cabman
being suitably rewarded later, f
* “E.P.P.,” 25/1/1882. t Reminiscences, R. W. Ward.


The Council continued to shilly-shally over Fire Brigade
matters. In 1882 it called for designs for a Fire Station.
Instead of building the station it put up a shed. Next, al-
though on the estimates, it refused to supply a new fire-bell.
Having built the shed it leased it to the Fire Brigade at £1
per annum. Finally it installed the new bell.
From 1885 the main finances of the Fire Brigade were
administered by a Fire Brigade Board to which the Muni-
cipal Council, the Government and the combined Insurance
Companies contributed a subsidy in equal proportions. #
The members of the fire brigade were required to muster
at the fire station on the 22/4/1884 for the funeral of Elijah
Hines. “Full uniform compulsory, including white
gloves.”f
The Municipal Council continued to interest itself in
Fire Brigade matters for some considerable time. It ob-
jected to the cost of a steam fire engine, hydrants and ladder
as “excessive.” It offered to sell the old engines to the
Board for £3OO. It accepted an “Estimate of Fire Brigade
expenditure for the year ending 31/12/1886 of £539/6/6,”
and struck a special ‘Fire Brigade and lighting rate’ of 3d.
in the £l.
The brigade’s own minutes contain several complaints
of watermen not hastening to a fire when the bell was rung.
Teams competed in demonstrations at Sydney, Sandhurst,
Orange, Geelong, Albury, Ballarat, Newcastle, Benalla, etc.
A quaint rule was that no man be allowed a mark for at-
tendance “unless he appear in some portion of his uniform.”
Discipline was strict. A fireman was censured for using
language calculated to annoy a brother fireman. Members
were struck off the roll for not attending practices. The
Rev. J. Auchinlech Ross was elected a member, the sugges-
tion being made that this would “tend to check the use of
improper language at practices. ’ ’
The engines pumped from canvas tanks and there are
many references in the minutes to their leaky condition.
The North Goulburn engine was housed in Gale’s shed at
the corner of Sloane and Bradley Streets. From February
1886, E. R. Laws became superintendent and R. Ward took
his place as secretary. Chas. Rogers gave the brigade “a

handsom silver speaking trnmpit” after the fire in the
Arcade stables. D. H. Judd became secretary in 1887,
when R. Ward was promoted to lieutenant. One R. Henty
met his death whilst working at Lansdowne Brothers’ fire
on the 13/10/1887. He was not a member of the brigade.
Two call boys were appointed “to go round and rouse
the firemen if necessary.” The boys were paid 5/- for each
fire and provided with a “red jumper and cap.” They
were not altogether a success for a little later a rule was
adopted fining them 6d. every time they were caught inter-
fering with the engine or the reel. A “large slate or black-
board” was displayed at the station giving the locality of
a fire.
A curious entry is
“Some discussion then arose about the Supt. action in en-
devouring to have the competiting team of 1888 potographed.
Hot and uncomplimentry words were used and ultimatly the
meeting was adjourned in great disorder.’ ’
E. Bye was appointed secretary in 1890. The brigade
met in the old Auburn Street station on the 4/3/1891 and
in the new Montague Street station on the 25/3/1891. The
next year the brigade organised a Fire Brigades’ demonstra-
tion in Goulburn. In Sydney it won six out of seven
events.
R. W. Ward (Captain from 1888 to 1905) succeeded
E. R. Laws as superintendent.
The writing of minutes of meetings imposed somewhat
of a strain on the firemen, who were better hands with the
hose and reel. They solved the difficulty by adopting
phonetic spelling. “Fuccher,” “Yunite,” “Bussness,”
“amalgomate,” “desturbed,” “athlictic,” “werupon,”
“propity,” are some of their efforts.
A quaint happening was that of the fire at Cox’s Flour
Mills in 1888. The Captain and 12 members of the Brigade
were attending a Fire Brigade demonstration in Sydney con-
fident that there would be “no fires during their absence.”
Unfortunately Cox’s Flour Mills caught fire. Ex-captain
Taylor and other ex-members of the brigade did their best
in the emergency with buckets of water. Apparently the
engine and hose were absent too. The damage amounted
to £IOOO. Censure was passed on the Captain and members


as displaying “a great lack of organisation.” The culprits
returned later with prizes and trophies.*
The Board of Fire Commissioners in Sydney has in its
possession some account books and a few papers of the Goul-
burn Fire Brigade Board which indicate that the Board was
in existence from 1885 to 1909. C. Gardner was secretary.
Its relations with the brigade do not appear to have been
either many or cordial. The brigade itself appears to have
managed both its properties and its finances. There is no
mention in the brigade’s minutes of the building of the Fire
Station in 1890/1 so presumably that matter was handled
by the Board.
The co-operation of the Fire Brigade and the Volunteers
in Band matters is described in another chapter. Every
New Year’s eve the old Volunteer Brigade held a torchlight
procession from its headquarters to the Hospital to which
it gave a big basket of fruit, f
Prior to the provision of a water supply the licensed
water vendors in Goulburn were required to keep their
water carts full at night and on the alarm being given to
proceed with all expedition to the scene of the fire and pro-
vide the water for the manual engines. £
The following is an extract from the Fire Brigade rules
relating to the carting of water to a fire:
“The Committee shall pay from the subscribers’ funds the
watermen and others who supply water at a fire at 10/- for the
first cask by day and 20/- by night, and for all other casks
required, and for every other additional cask, 1/- by day and
2/- by night.”
The names of some of these carters have been preserved,
e.g. at a fire in 1882 when Bushman’s tailor’s shop in Auburn
Street was burnt out
“Waterman Hodges was first on the spot with a load of water,
and was speedily joined by Mr. Tromp, Lockhard, Brown, Cock-
burn, Johnson, and others, who as fast as their horses could
travel, went to and fro. Three carts of Mr. Mills the butcher,
were constantly employed in bringing water to both engines. ”§
The Fire Station has been located at various points in
the city. An early station was in Verner Street opposite
the Presbytery. Another station was on the site of the
present Town Hall. Next a site was granted in the Court
House Reserve. This was resumed and with the £SOO com-
pensation the present site in Montague Street was bought.

The present Fire Station was built in 1890. It was designed
by E. C. Manfred. # At this time the branch station at
North Goulburn, at the corner of Grafton and Bradley Sts.,
was still in use and the call boy system in vogue.
In 1908 relations between members of the Brigade and
the Board were strained. The Board decided to disband
the Brigade, to withdraw the Brigade members’ privilege of
nominating officers and to vest all appointments in itself, t
In 1910 the Board of Fire Commissioners of New South
Wales assumed control. It took over the following equip-
ment from the local Board:
2 Manual engines (35 and 69 years respectively) 1 fair, the
other bad.
3 reels.
1 ladder truck.
8 scaling ladders in fair condition.
200 ft. of 2|in. rubber lined hose, fair.
2950 ft. of 2iin. unlined hose in good condition.
350 ft. new hose, couplings dirty and requiring new washers;
branches; nozzles and standpipes of old pattern; suction
pipe, fair to bad.
The manual engine is shown as 69 years old, thus dating
from 1851. There was no Brigade in Goulburn then and
Woodward’s engine was not built until 1854.
Some time after 1910 the practice of appointing full-
time officers-in-charge from Sydney was adopted. With the
extension of this system the number of volunteer firemen has
been steadily reduced.
In 1912 Goulburn was provided with a horse-drawn tur-
bine engine. Later this was replaced by a four-cylinder
motor fire engine of the “Garford” type driving a “Gwynn”
pump. In 1928 a “Dennis” engine was supplied, capable
of pumping 500/700 gallons per minute. At the same time
such modern fire-fighting equipment as the portable exten-
sion ladder, roof and scaling ladders, gas masks, etc., were
added. In 1934 a trailer pump was acquired.
Alarms were erected at strategic points in the city, a
switch-board installed in the station and extension bells
connected to the homes of the firemen. The fire alarm
was first located in Auburn Street, where the wine gardens
are now. It was of course, a bell.
The story goes that in the old days the fire alarm was
rung on one occasion by an opossum which had crawled
into the bell and wound its tail round the tongue.
* Gbn. “Herald/ ’ 3/11/1891. t “E.P.P.,” 17/2/1908.


The bell at the Fire Station was at one time the loudest
fire alarm in Australia. It was cast by Vickers, Sons &
Coy., of Sheffield, and was erected in 1885. It weighs 758
lbs. # In recent years it has been superseded by a siren
although it is still used occasionally.
The North Goulburn Fire Station was relinquished on
the 31/5/1917. It still had a manual engine. The pre-
mises were sold for £3O/10/-.
The biggest fires in Goulburn have been at an auction
mart on the site where the Commonwealth Bank now stands,
the old Bank of New South Wales, Hayes’ Mill, Gillespie’s
Boot factory, J. W. Craig’s premises, Lansdowne’s timber
yards, old Bishopthorpe, Bennett & Wood Ltd., Aylward’s
billiard saloon, St. Saviour’s Church Hall, the Regent Shop-
ping block and Baxter’s tannery.
The Municipal Council asked for a public enquiry into
the Church Hall fire on the 10/12/1925 but the same was
refused.
A long and interesting account of the first 40 years’ of
Fire Brigade activities in Goulburn appeared in the Goul-
burn “Herald,” of the 14/8/1891.§
Post Office.
The first Post Office in Goulburn was established in
1832, probably at the Police Office in the Old Township,
but this is uncertain.! In 1834 it was at the Court House
of that day. The Deputy Postmaster at Goulburn in 1834
was T. P. Besnard. The mail arrived from Bong Bong,
Campbelltown and Sydney every Thursday at 9 p.m. and
left for the same places every Saturday at 9 a.m.
Two years later it arrived:
“From Berrima, Bungonia, Campbelltown, Liverpool and Syd-
ney, every Sunday and Thursday at 3 o’clock p.m. From Yass,
every Friday at 6 p.m.
Mail was despatched:
“For Berrima, Campbelltown, Liverpool, Sydney and Bungonia,
every Wednesday at 7 o’clock a.m. For Yass every Monday at
6 o’clock a.m.”{

John Richards of the Argyle Inn, Bong Bong, adver-
tised in 1836:
“The undersigned having in conjunction with Mr. Ireland
contracted for the conveyance of His Majesty’s mails, the public
are informed that from Ist January he will leave Talbot’s Inn,
Brickfield Hill, George Street, Sydney, at 5 p.m. for:
Bong-Bong, Wednesdays and Saturdays
Goulburn, Mondays and Saturdays
and leaves Goulburn Tuesdays and Thursdays 7 am.
Passengers pay for luggage over lOlbs.”*
Mail was despatched from Sydney for Goulburn every
Tuesday and* Friday at 5 o’clock and was received from
Goulburn every Tuesday and Friday at 8 o’clock a.m. The
“Rates of postage, in pence, to the several Post Offices in
New South Wales” in 1836 were:
To Berrima 7d, Wollongong lOd, Appin and Campbelltown 9d,
Liverpool and Bathurst 12d, Hassan’s Walls lid, Penrith lOd,
Windsor, Parramatta and Sydney lOd.t
Referring to the years 1837/8 and writing of his own
schooldays, J. K. Chisholm said:
“It took three days to reach Goulburn by ordinary conveyance,
and the postage of a letter from there to Sydney was tenpence.”
He went on to say:
“Postage stamps were first used in the Colony in 1838, or two
years earlier than England; they were not adhesive stamps, like
those at present in use, but a cover or envelope for enclosing
the letter, upon which was embossed the Royal Arms. These
were obtained at the General Post Office at so much a dozen.” t
Arthur W. Jose gives the time by stage-coach from Syd-
ney to Goulburn as two days and the postage rates as 4/-
per oz.§ By 1839 the service had been increased and
arrived every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday at midnight.
A mail twice a week to Lake George and Yass had been
added, and one, once a week, to and from Melbourne.
In 1840 the Post Office was established in a room belong-
ing to Bull and Woodward, at or adjoining the Commercial
Hotel in Market Street.
By 1841 there was a daily mail, to and from Sydney,
Sundays excepted. Joseph Bull was postmaster in 1842.||
The tender of Joseph Henry Jones of Bargo, for “the con-
veyance of Post Office Mails, between Campbelltown, Picton,
Berrima, Marulan and Goulburn, four times a week, by four
horse coach, for £560” was notified as accepted on the

6/2/1847.* He was complimented upon his “superior turn-
out. ’ ’ The roads were in a fearful condition. An accident
to “Teddy” a popular driver was reported.!
The need of a public clock was voiced as early as 1843
and again in 1848, when it was said “to be felt by all” and
especially “by the working classes.
The Goulburn correspondent of the “Sydney Morning
Herald“ complained of the irregularity of the mails. One
had just arrived bringing three days’ communications and
there were “No mails again on Saturday.” He went on
“This queer arrangement is not understood.” However
against that he noted great improvement in the mail
coaches, viz., “Four-wheeled carriages with extra horses.”
Moreover the fare between Sydney and Goulburn had been
reduced to £3.§ In 1851 the mails left Holman’s White
Horse Tavern for Berrima and Goulburn on Tuesdays, Wed-
nesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 5 p.m.||
An official paragraph appeared in the press advising
that:
“Prepayment of Letters by Stamps. Stamps must be placed
on right hand side of the letter.”**
That same year Goulburn began to agitate for letter
carriers. The “Herald” described
“1000 persons a day, running about three times a day asking
for letters.... a damning policy for the Government’s to save a
few pounds.”
Four years later a letter carrier was appointed. He
was a man named Rushforth who kept a little shop in
Sloane Street. John Horton wrote:
“I remember him going his rounds in his red coat.”
Rushforth, at one time the only letter carrier at the
Goulburn Post Office died at the age of 82 in 1893.ft

The “Telegraph Station Master” appears in official
lists for the first time in 1862. J. Mackee held the appoint-
ment.* C. A. Middleton held the office for many years. The
“Electric Telegraph” was a separate department and was
not housed at the Post Office until the early eighties. Nor
was it part of the normal activities of the Post Office until
then. First it was housed in Mandelson’s Hotel, then in
a small building in the Court House square.
The “Sydney Morning Herald” in 1865, spoke of the
“new” post office in course of erection “by Mr. Bull.”f
The Post Office arranged to move to premises in Auburn
Street, “opposite Mr. McGarvey’s Harp Inn,” to be built
by Duncan, in 1872. Duncan began the building in May
and promised to complete it by August. $ This building
still stands, adjoining the Hibernian Hotel. It has been
much modernised, not to its improvement, but its older
features can still be traced.
C. A. Middleton wrote :
“The Telegraph office in those days (1878) was in a little
cottage facing Belmore Square and right in front of the Western
wing of the present Court House. It boasted a time ball and
a flagstaff but the former, which was at one time daily watched
by the people of Goulburn, had fallen into disuse.”s
From this it would appear that the Telegraph office
never occupied the site set apart for it in Montague Street
(the present Fire Station) but moved direct from Belmore
Square to the present Post Office.
As a matter of fact considerable surprise was- expressed
when the present building was erected as a “Post and Tele-
graph office.” The Money Order office was established in
1863 and the Savings Bank in 1871.||
In 1877 the Municipal Council asked the Postmaster-
General to have the time-ball at the Telegraph Office worked
properly. Later it suggested a gun be substituted.**
The Secretary of the General Post Office wrote to the
Municipal Council on the 15/2/1877:
“That the Post-master General had decided to erect the new
Post and Telegraph offices on the reserve for public buildings
at the corner of Sloane and Montague Streets.”

A protest was evidently made for a little later the
Mayor informed the Council that he had not called a public
meeting to protest because the Government now intended
building in Auburn Street. The new building (the present
Post Office) was begun in .1880 and finished in 1881. The
contractor was F. Horn. The contract was for £13,000 but
extras brought the expenditure up to £16,000.*
It was opened on the 3/10/1881, an important day.
Visitors included the Hon. P. B. Suttor, Postmaster-General;
Sir John Robertson, Minister for Public Instruction; Sir
J. G. Long Innes, Minister for Justice. The visitors
were given an illuminated address and a banquet in Mandel-
son’s Hotel at night, f Tornaghi of Sydney, had charge of
the erection of the P. O. clock. The clock was wound up
and regulated under the supervision of the Colonial Archi-
tect. The Post Office officials affixed a notice to the large
gates which formerly stood in the archway, now part of the
main building. It warned people against tying horses to
them
“But why?” said the “Penny Post,” “don’t they erect horse-
posts and so consult the convenience of the majority of their
customers?”
Advice was received on the 27/1/1883 that, as a result
of an enquiry by the Colonial Architect, posts would be
supplied.:]: These posts remained until 1939 when they were
removed by the Municipal authorities.
A serious monetary discrepancy in 1888 resulted in the
suspension of the postmaster (Dennis) and two other
officers. A meeting of his friends was held at the Royal
Hotel to raise money to help him defray the costs of defend-
ing the resulting prosecution. §
The humour directed at the town clock and its vagaries
was a perennial source of amusement in the nineties; e.g.,
“What’s up, that all the people hang their head?
Is Kirkham or Narellan lame or dead?
Or Albert Edward, Prince confined to bed?
Is Parkes’ latest troubled with an ache?
Down in the diaphragm, and keeps awake
Through half the night and won’t his medicine take?”

In 1890 R. E. Conolly began an agitation for a telephone
system. The Municipal Council resolved:
“That an affirmative reply be sent to Mr. R. E. Conolly’s
request for the Council to join the proposed Telephone Ex-
change . ”
He obtained 15 guarantors for a telephone exchange.
The cost was £5 for membership, £5 for an instrument and
“a share in the expense of making the connections.” Work
was begun on a telephone exchange in 1891. Twenty citi-
zens by this time had given in their names as subscribers.*
Wm. Conolly Ltd. still proudly boast of their telephone
number “Goulburn 1.” The most extraordinary delays
however occurred in the matter of extending trunk-line
facilities to Goulburn. After much agitation the Postmaster-
General telegraphed on the 10/1/1905 consenting to the
linking of Goulburn with Sydney by telephone. Three
years later, 1908, the Municipal Council was still petitioning
the Postmaster-General for the connection of Goulburn with
the Sydney-Melbourne telephone. The request was refused.
Later a trunk line to Sydney was promised when funds per-
mitted. In 1910 the Municipal Council was still agitating
for a trunk line service between Goulburn and Sydney.
The line was still “under construction” in 1911. t
In 1916 the Goulburn Chamber of Commerce was suc-
cessful in obtaining a late fee box at the Goulburn Post
Office, the first on the Southern Line.ij:
The Municipal Council protested in 1916 against “the
disorganisation and inefficiency of the Postal Department
in Sydney and more especially the unreasonable delay....
as regards delivery in and despatch from Sydney of Goul-
burn letters. ”§
The Post Office was restored and enlarged in 1926.
A new post office in Union Street, North Goulburn, was
established in 1940. The Postmaster was R. L. Stalker, a
returned soldier, and formerly a bus proprietor.**

Lands Office.
The earliest reference to the Lands Office in Goulbnrn
is in 1853 when Captain Hovell was appointed Commissioner
of Crown Lands. His letter-book is extant from 1853.
From 1855 the book is continued by Edward Maitland and
from 1857 by George O’Malley Clark. There being no room
available Captain Hovell asks permission to use his own
house in Verner Street, as an office. The Colonial store-
keeper sent him his office equipment which was not on a
generous scale. It included: 1 India rubber, lib. candles,
2 black ink powders, 1 red ditto, 1 strap, 1 tape, 1 ink-
stand. Soon Hovell was complaining of the nuisance of
people coming at all hours and asked for the help of a
clerk to cope with it*
The Lands Office was in FoxalFs Buildings in Auburn
Street in the eighties. It moved into the old Court House
in 1888. The alterations cost £4OO. Another account says
£lOOO. Up to this time the Goulbnrn office had only dealt
with lands in the immediate district of Goulbnrn and was a
“one-man-office.” When the old Court House was made
available the main office from Cooma with its large staff
was transferred to Goulbnrn. t

Edward Twynam was District Surveyor for many years.
In the early nineties he was appointed Surveyor-General and
the Trigonometrical Survey of the State was effected under
his supervision. He lived at “Riversdale,” North Goulburn.
A proposal to move the Lands Office into part of the
present Court House in 1934 was defeated by public opinion.
In 1939 a proposal was brought forward to move it into
the Police Buildings next door. No action was taken.
The police buildings adjoining the Lands Office were
designed in 1888 to accommodate the Roads Department,
the Coroner’s office, the Colonial Architect’s Department and
the Inspector of Stock. The estimated cost was £5OOO.
Previously the Colonial Architect had his office in the old
Telegraph building in the Court House reserve, which build-
ing was sold by auction on the 12/11/1889. *
Main Roads Department.
The Southern Divisional Office of the Main Roads Board
was established in Queanbeyan in August 1928, and moved
to Goulburn in May 1932, T. A. Donaldson then being the
Divisional Engineer. The branch occupies the first floor
of the Commonwealth Bank. Donaldson was succeeded
by V. J. G. Harding in April 1937, C. A. Hawkins in January
1938, and J. James in September 1939. Its responsibility
is to supervise the construction, improvement and mainten-
ance of bridges and roads where such works are carried out
by funds partly or wholly provided by the Department.
The Southern Division operates in the Municipalities of
Goulburn, Boorowa, Cootamundra, Murrumburrah, Quean-
beyan, Yass, and Young, and the Shires of Burrangong,
Crookwell, Demondrille, Goodradigbee, Gundagai, Gunning,
Jindalee, Mulwaree, Tallaganda, Wingecarribee and Yarrow-
lumla. The principal works carried out by the branch
within 5 miles of Goulburn have been the reconstruction in
concrete pavement of Auburn Street, the spotting and levell-
ing of existing pavements in Lagoon, Clinton, and Cowper
Streets, with hot pre-mixed bitumen surface and the devia-
tion of Governor’s Hill, completed with bitumen drag
surface course, and the surfacing of Main and Trunk roads
in the district.!

Pastures Protection Board.
The earliest evidence of interest in the well-being of the
grazing industry in Goulburn was the appointment of an
“Inspector for examining sheep.' ’ In 1857 this office was
held by Fred Maxton Charteris.* There was a " Board of
Sheep Directors" who met at the "Stock and Pastures
Office" in Auburn Street. It operated first under the
‘'Diseases of Sheep Act 1866" and later under the Amended
Act of 1878. f R. Henderson was its chairman in the eighties
The office was inundated with hare scalps in 1891; J. J.
Roberts, the secretary, had to contend with 1400 on one
occasion whilst the total for a week was 6000. t
There was a Board of Directors (sometimes called
the Rabbit Board) operating under the Pastures Protection
Act of 1902. Its minutes are extant. Its first meeting was
held at the offices of the "Pastures and Stock Board" on
the 27/8/1902. J. T. Naughten was its chairman and J. J.
Roberts its acting-secretary "without salary." It took
over the offices and assets of the "late Pastures and Stock
Protection Board" when J. J. Roberts was given a salary
of £l2O per annum. The Board paid bonuses of 20/- each
for native dogs, 10/- for pups, 20/- for foxes, 2d. for hares
and 2d for Kangaroo rats. The Stock Inspector’s salary
was fixed at £3OO. The Minister for Lands overrode these
decisions. He fixed the Inspector’s salary at £350 and the
Secretary’s at £74.
It levied an assessment of 2d per head on large stock
and one farthing for sheep.
The question of the duties and functions of the "Stock
Boards" being taken over by the Shire Council first arose
in 1907. However the Boards still survive and now operate
under the provisions of the Pastures Protection Act No. 35
of 1934 as Amended by Act No. 35 of 1935. These Acts
repeal the former Pastures Protection Act of 1912 and the
Public Watering Places Act of 1900. §
The Goulburn Stock Stealing Prevention Association
was formed in 1911. Its first action was to offer £25 for
information leading to the conviction of persons stealing
stock from members of the Association. II

The General Hospital.*
In 1834 a Convict Hospital was established in Goulburn,
of which Patrick Harnett, assistant-surgeon of the Medical
Establishment was put in charge at a salary of 10/- per day
with 2/6 forage allowance.
In the official document recording the appointment the
reason given was:
“Medical assistance being greatly needed in the district county
of Argyle, a temporary hospital has been established at Goul-
burn, and Mr. Harnett placed there.”!
An early mention of this hospital is on the 8/10/1836
when James Backhouse writing about some wooden build-
ings erected in the “New Township” says:
“One of the latter is an hospital, affording accommodation for
about thirty patients.”!
Judge Burton, writing in 1839 twice mentioned the
Goulburn Hospital, but only in relation to his main theme
‘ ‘ Religion and Education. ’ ’ He said:
“There is a Hospital at Goulburn, where Mr. Sowerby reads
prayers, and gives a short exposition of the lessons during the
service, on Wednesday mornings. The Reverend Mr. Hamilton
and the Roman Catholic priest occasionally visit these establish-
ments.” §
The establishment of the Goulburn Convict Hospital is
mentioned by Dr. George Bennett, writing in 1834. He
speaks of the malingering of the assigned servants who had
to be sent upwards of 200 miles to the Liverpool Hospital
and says first:
“The establishment of an hospital at Goulburn Plains would
obviate most of this just cause of complaint by the settler.”
Then he adds a footnote:
“Since.the above was written, this inconvenience has been ob-
viated by government establishing an hospital at Goulburn
Plains. ”J|
The early history of this first hospital is given in a des-
patch, Gipps to Russell of the 1/10/1841:
“There are, in the colony, convict hospitals defrayed by each
patient not a convict, at 1/9 per day.... As the time seems to me
to be arrived, when the Home Government may reasonably be
expected to be relieved from the expence of maintaining some of
these establishments, I have given notice of my intention speedily
to discontinue the Hospitals at Windsor, Bathurst and Goul-
burn. ”**

On the 11/6/1842 the transfer of the Convict Hospital
to the local authorities was approved. “County” hospitals,
on the English models were to be instituted. In a despatch
(Gipps to Stanley) of the 2/8/1842 the Governor said:
“At Goulburn, a committee of Management has been established,
and I hope funds sufficient for the maintenance of the hospital
will be obtained. Stores and furniture at Goulburn have been
valued at £22/17/7, also surgical instruments and utensils at
£9l/14/11.”
The new hospital committee did well out of the transfer
for the writing down of the stores included their alternative
removal to Sydney, e.g.:
“Memo of value of bedsteads, bedding and stoves remaining at
the convict hospital at Goulburn:
“Estimated value at Invoice prices . . £lB6 1 11
Proposed reductions:
From use, 20 per cent £37 4 4
Expense of removal to Sydney,
7 dray loads at £lB 126 0 0 163 4 4
£22.17 7
Richard Rogers, Storekeeper.”!
The Rev. Wm. Hamilton (Presbyterian) in his diary for
June 1842, states that he and his Episcopalian colleague
were responsible for the joint management of the hospital
which had previously been maintained by the Government.
They were also co-operating in the matter of religious minis-
trations within the hospital, t The Second Annual Report
of the Goulburn Hospital occupied two columns in the
press. There had been 38 patients in the year, 11 of
whom were “prisoners of the Crown.” There was a de-
ficiency on the year’s working towards which
“the large sum received from drunkards’ fines, being no less
than £73/18/1 has gone far to relieve your Committee. .”$

The Committee decided to entrust the Hospital to Dr.
Waugh, allowing him 2/6 per day per patient to cover all
costs. That first hospital had its troubles. The first page
of the first issue of the ‘ ‘ Goulburn Herald ’ ’ devotes a column
to the dilapidated state of the Goulburn Hospital. On the
next page a leading article mentions an appeal with a local
objective of £SOO in order to secure a Legislative Council
grant of a like amount. There was then in hand, according
to the published list of subscribers, £323/18/6.* A ball was
held at the Harp Hotel in aid of the hospital, in 1848.
In reporting the Annual Meeting of the hospital in 1849,
when Fr. Walsh, the Rev. Wm. Ross and the Rev. W. Sower-
by and J. F. M’Arthur disagreed on the subject of tenders,
the press said:
“We have done our best to give a correct outline of the pro-
ceedings, but from the noise and want of order which prevailed
we found ourselves as much puzzled in following the speakers
as if we had been reporting the speeches made by the different
artizans employed in the erection of the Tower of Babel.”t
The Hospital was rebuilt in 1848/9. It was completed
on the 1/9/18494 This second hospital stood on the site
now occupied by the Police Barracks in Sloane Street. It
was a dignified building in the Old Colonial style. Its
position was
beside the first hospital. The two buildings remained side by
side for years. ,J §
In the later forties Henry Hollis was placed in charge
as superintendent.
The hospital records are far from complete. The first
19 annual reports are missing. The 20th (1/1/1861 to
1/1/1862) has some quaint features. The president was
James McGovern, the treasurer the Rev. Wm. Sowerby, the
secretary the Rev. Wm. Ross. The committee included Fr.
McAlroy and the trustees Captain Hovell. Patients for the
year totalled 108. The average daily cost of each patient
was 4/oid. There is a table of diseases from which the
patients suffered, a classification according to religion, to
country of origin and “civil condition” (27 free by servitude
and 81 free immigrants) ; “unclaimed poundages £239/2/-,”
and “Police fines £44/11/-” helped the income. Patients

were charged 2/6 a day. Applications for admission had
to be made to the "House Apothecary.''
The "Ward Regulations" were very quaint. Conval-
escent patients had to assist in the cleaning of the wards.
No patient was "on any account, to make tea in the ward,
or to lie on bed with boots or shoes on." The rules had
to be read over every Wednesday to the patients by the
visiting Committee. The medical officers were Dr. Waugh
and Dr. Hanford. In 1876 the committee installed a bath-
room. £37/10/6 was spent on "Spirits, beer etc." The
Colonial Treasurer contributed £2BB/17/6.
At the Annual Meeting on the 24/1/1876 only one sub-
scriber attended. The meeting lapsed. An adjourned
meeting also lapsed. #
John Jessop was Superintendent of the Hospital from
1875 to 1880. In reporting this appointment the "Penny
Post" said: “Mr. Jessop has no children, which we believe,
was one feature which led to his appointment."!
A dispute about the proceeds of a concert for the hos-
pital promoted by G. F. Mitchell (organist of St. Saviour's
Cathedral) although it brought in little revenue for the
hospital, enriched the newspapers, for the protagonists each
advertised at length their versions of the matter in the
press.t The "Goulburn Fever Ward a/c.," Frank Deacon
honorary treasurer, was at the Bank of N.S.W. in 1880.§
From 1883 to 1885 an extraordinary dispute raged in
connection with the hospital. The walls were hung with
texts of the "Prepare to meet thy God" variety. After
some clamour they were removed. Then they re-appeared
again and legal action was threatened between members of
the pro-text parties and the anti-text parties.
When on one occasion the offending texts were removed
considerable criticism of the committee's action ensued. The
committee replied by inviting the press to be present at its
meetings. The Goulburn "Herald" declined the invitation
in a leading article. Apparently the texts were brought
back for E. C. Manfred called by advertisement on the Rev.
G. M. D’Arcy Irvine for an apology for:
“imputing dishonorable conduct and want of courtesy on my
part in my position as secretary to the hospital.”
* Gbn. “Herald,” 2/2/1876, 9/2/1876; t “E.P.P.,” 11/5/1875.
t Gbn. “Herald/ ’ 31/1/1880. § Sig. Book, 3. 17/2/1880.


The next advertisement read:
“The Rev. G. M. DArcy Irvine denies having imputed dis-
honorable conduct to Mr. E. C. Manfred. What he did say
respecting the Roll of Scriptural Texts forwarded by Mr. E. C.
Manfred to the Inspector of Public Charities he is ready to
Explain to the Committee of the Goulburn Hospital....”
This extraordinary situation continued until 1885, when
the hospital was decorated with texts, not only on the walls
but on the counterpanes. Bishop Lanigan objected to their
Protestant bias and asked permission to be allowed to select
texts also. Bishop Thomas made some remonstrance. The
Committee postponed the whole question for three months.
As the matter then disappeared from the newspapers pre-
sumably the texts were removed. # As late as 1885 the
weekly report of the hospital read:
“admitted 2, discharged 2, death 1, patients remaining in
institution 6.”
A “new fever ward” was added to the Sloane Street
Hospital in 1880. J. Kirkpatrick, presumably of Sydney,
“obtained the premium for the competitive plan. ”f Mr.
and Mrs. Stanhope Adams were appointed Superintendent
and Matron respectively in this year. Permission was sought
in 1883 to sell the old hospital site at the corner of Sloane
and Clifford Streets and to apply the proceeds in the pur-
chase of other lands and the erection of a new hospital.
Various technical difficulties and vexatious delays ensued
and it was not until the annual meeting of 27/1/1885 that
the Committee reported that a private bill had vested the
old hospital site in the Trustees, had given authority for its
sale and that a new site had been granted.
It was decided to offer £SO for a competitive design for
a new hospital to cost £6OOO. At the annual meeting in
1886 the committee reported it had rejected the competitive
designs for the new hospital and commissioned E. C. Man-
fred to draw up plans. Tenders were invited for the new
hospital on the 26/5/1887. That of C. Goode and Sons for
£6946/11/- was At the end of 1888 the new
building was approaching completion, £3763 had been paid
on account and there was due to the contractors £3450 and
to the architect £IBO. The Superintendent resigned and a

Matron (Miss Munro) was appointed “Superintendent and
Matron. ’ ’
A battle royal ensued in 1888 over a paltry difference
of opinion between the secretary, A. W. Bullen, and the
president, S. Meyer. It reached such dimensions that the
subscribers were asked to vote for the retention or dismissal
of Bullen. The meeting which was stormy, resulted in the
dismissal of the secretary, when T. F. Meyer dropped 14
proxies from Sydney subscribers into the hat. The decision
would appear to have been unjust. H. S. Gannon succeeded
S. Meyer as president and T. S. Russell was appointed
secretary.*
Another storm in the hospital teacup that year was
when the wardsman wrote in the visitors’ book after a
constable-patient’s name “Slops, Copper, who stole the tur-
nips?” The wardsman was reprimanded and the con-
stable’s dignity was satisfied. A bazaar in aid of the new
building in 1889 brought in £1620/1/8. Part of the old
hospital site was sold for £1283. The committee sought to
dispose of the rest by means of an Art Union but the
Attorney-General disallowed it. Why it is difficult to say
because that was a recognised and popular method of dis-
posing of land in Goulburn at that time. The new hospital
was opened on the 11/10/1889 by the Mayor, H. S. Gannon.
There was some heart-burning in that the committee forgot
to invite the aldermen, f In 1890 James Chisholm left £SOO
to the hospital for luxuries for the patients. The interest
is still used for the provision of Christmas cheer.
This year the office of Matron was abolished and a
superintendent-secretary-dispenser appointed. The staff
was reduced to four. The Government gave £2OOO for an
isolation block. The services of the Superintendent (Dwyer)
were dispensed with in 1891 after the death of a patient
(Dawson). The patient was first neglected and then given
the wrong medicine. $ The staff at the end of 1891 consisted
of a Head Nurse and two probationers. “Hospital Sunday”
was instituted by the City Band in 1893. This fixture con-
tinued until 1930 when it was relinquished.

In 1904 a tablet commemorating benefactors to the Hos-
pital, of £IOO or over was erected.
The "Penny Post” commented on the Hospital Ball of
1893 in a poem of eleven verses, with topical and personal
allusions. Some were more humourous than tactful, e.g.:
“The Druids were grave and decorous,
But some wretched creature there said
That Druids could not look impressive,
But always seemed ready for bed.”*
As late as 1900 the figures for the Goulburn Hospital
were only small, e.g., April 1900: 17 patients admitted, 25
discharged, 20 remaining in hospital and four died.f
Some considerable dissatisfaction was expressed in 1906
with the food supplied at the hospital, more particularly to
the nurses on night duty. E. Milne championed the dis-
satisfied, making pertinent comparisons with the treatment
the Kenmore staff received. The "Penny Post” published
some verses:
“The nights are so long and the food is so plain
That bread and butter and tea
Soon grow very stale when compared with a tale
Being told about Kenmore, said she.”t
A new laundry was built in 1905. The first R.M.O.
was appointed in 1909 (Dr. Culpin). The first salaried
secretary (J. D. Stevenson) was appointed this year. A
new pathology building and morgue were built in 1915 and
other improvements made. Electric light was installed in
1917 and a new operating theatre in 1919. The influenza
epidemic that year accounted for 117 patients alone, whilst
pneumonic influenza patients totalled 68 of whom 35 died.
A bell at the General Hospital bears the date 1854. It is
said to be a relic of the coaching days and was given to the
hospital by F. W. Scholz then licensee of the Royal Hotel.
It was formerly at the Commercial Hotel.
The Municipal Council in 1916, bought sundry equip-
ment in connection with an outbreak of meningitis (originat-
ing at the Military camp) and upon the scare abating sold
the same to the Hospital at half cost.§
The pneumonic inflenza epidemic in 1919 involved the
municipal council in much work. St. Saviour’s Church Hall
was requisitioned as an emergency hospital (it was not

actually used) and a temporary laundry, etc. built. The
committee banned the Goulburn race meetings, but later
permitted them to be held provided masks were worn.* 5
An Industrial Scheme of contributions was launched
in 1921. Ten years later this was enlarged into the Com-
munity Scheme and is now the biggest local factor in Hos-
pital finance. Some extensions costing £I6OO were made
in 1925/6. In 1927/8 the first block of the Nurses’ Home
was built at a cost of £9500. Admissions reached the 1000
mark in 1927 and the 2000 ten years later. The first block
of private wards costing £6OOO was built in 1933, the second
in 1937. Bequests in 1936 included W. J. Bartlett £2000,,
and Mr. and Mrs. S. Dale £6OOO.
The Hospitals Commission completed the private wards
block in 1938. In the sitting room it provided a fireplace
but forgot to build a chimney, f
A Children’s ward was completed in 1938, and the
second block of the Nurses’ Home, costing £11,500 in 1939.
The daily average of patients is now over 100, the annual
running costs amount to £15,000 whilst the hospital and
plant are valued at £75,000. The staff numbers 50. It
is estimated that 42,000 patients have been treated here.
The Apex Club bought the anaesthesia plant in 1938/9.
In 1939 the Ladies’ Auxiliary added a kiosk to its
activities- The kiosk was built free of cost, builder, plumber,
electricians and others giving their services voluntarily.;):
A maternity block to cost £IO,OOO was mooted (not for
the first time) in 1940 but no progress recorded. That
year the Hospitals Commission offered to increase its subsidy
by £4OO per annum in order to secure the appointment of
a pathologist. The work on the new laundry block, filtra-
tion plant, etc., estimated to cost from £11,815 to £13,080
was postponed by the Works Department and the Hospitals
Commission because of the position of the Government’s
finances. §

Kenmore Mental Hospital.
The Kenmore Estate originally was the homestead of
William Lithgow, first Surveyor-General of N.S.W. and the
owner in the fifties of large pastoral properties in the dis-
trict. “At the sale of the Kenmore Estate on the
29/10/1879, Mr. District Surveyor Twynam, on behalf of
the Government, purchased lot 32 consisting of 116 acres and
lot 33 of 108 acres 3 roods and 39 perches, the former at
£4/10/- and the latter at £3 per acre.”t The decision to
use the site for a mental hospital would seem to have been
taken on the 1/10/1889. The land was then valued at
£IO,OOO and the building at £IOOO. The Hospital buildings
were designed by the Government Architect in accordance
with requirements indicated by the Inspector-General of
the Insane.
The main expenditure on buildings and additions has
been: 1894/5, £17,245; 1895/6, £24,704; 1896/7, £44,986;
1897, £23,804; 1898/9, £18,200; 1899/1900, £28,315; 1900/1,
£14,932; 1909/10, £8,819; 1910/11, £14,421. The Valuer-
General’s present valuation of the Hospital property is
Unimproved Capital value £5,680, Improved Capital value
£204,208. It was gazetted as a Hospital for the Insane in
18944 The first part of the hospital buildings was in

use in 1895 by 100 patients in all with Dr. Chisholm Ross
as Medical Superintendent. All the patients were men. The
contract for the new wards was much overdue in 1896.
The first buildings were erected by a local contractor.
The second contract, including the recreation hall, went to
Parry and Farley of Sydney for £3608, without tenders
being called. The announcement in the Assembly that cow-
byres and piggeries were to cost £2OOO was criticised ad-
versely. Stubbings and Edwards were the contractors for
the farm.
Kingston and Coy. erected the female wards and other
buildings in 1899 at a cost of £31,628. Wall and Son had
the 1900 contracts.* Dr. Chisholm Ross was medical super-
intendent from 1895 to 1900, the formative years of the
Kenmore Asylum. Not a little of the present beauty of the
grounds and gardens is due to his foresight and planning.
There are 1135 acres of land attached to the hospital
which are laid out for pasture, cultivation, vegetable and
flower gardens, dairy, piggery, fowl-yards and slaughter
yards. There are workshops for carpenters, painters, boot
repairing, saddlery, mattress-making, etc., in addition of
course, to the kitchen, laundry and sewing room.
So far as possible the hospital is self-supporting.
Seventy per cent, of the men and sixty per cent, of the
women work in the wards, grounds or workshops. A large
dam provides irrigation. Water is also pumped from the
river. The hospital exchanges meat for bread with the
Reformatory. The staff numbers 200 and the patients 1100.
A curious piece of departmental bungling is revealed by the
transactions in connection with Kenmore and Rossiville Es-
tates. Rossiville was purchased by the Government in 1890
for £15,158 for the purposes of an asylum, it having for-
gotten that it had owned Kenmore since 1879. Wm. Teece,
M.L.A., was asked to protest in Parliament against the pro-
posal to establish a lunatic asylum at Rossiville on the
grounds of possible contamination of the city water supply.!
In 1890 the decision to build at Kenmore was rescinded
by Parliament. In 1891 competitive designs for a hospital
at Rossiville were invited, t

In 1892 the Municipal Council was still protesting
against the proposal to build the hospital at Rossiville and
urging Kenmore on the Government. In the meantime the
decision to build at Kenmore was re-affirmed. Some awk-
ward questions were asked in Parliament in 1895. The
next year the Government called for a report on the suit-
ability of the Rossiville Estate for an experimental farm,
but the expert opinion was unfavourable. In 1897 the
minister in charge admitted he did not know what the estate
cost, why it was unoccupied or how it was to be used.f
A sectional Committee of the Parliamentary Standing
Committee for Public Works took evidence in Goulburn on
the 14/7/1892 upon “the opposing sites for the proposed
Goulburn Lunatic Asylum.’ 9
The Government still held the Rossiville property in
1900 and was slaughtering cattle there for the Kenmore Hos-
pital to the possible danger of the Municipal water supply.
In 1908 the Department of Agriculture inspected it with a
view to establishing an experimental farm there. Nothing
came of the proposal and later the estate was sold.J
Dr. Chisholm Ross was followed as medical superinten-
dent, by Dr. Goodson, Dr. Reid, Dr. C. A. Hogg and Dr.
Moffitt. The last named retired in 1937 and was succeeded
by Dr. S. J. Minogue. Matrons have been Miss Pope, Mrs.
Watson, the Misses Ford, Tait, Colvin and M. Miller. Mana-
gers have been Messrs. Richardson, Rankin, Fleming,
Henderson and McCrory.§
Richard Galbraith Sindell, a “leave patient” of the
Sydney Cottage Hospital, Callan Park, visited Kenmore Hos-
pital in 1922. He shot Nurse Elizabeth Naughten dead,
and wounded Nurse Mabel Follent. He fired three shots
at Nurse Cartwright, one at Nurse Barnes blowing her cap
off, and three at the manager (Rankin). Rankin shot
Sindell in the head whereupon he surrendered. Later he
was arrested by Sergeant Avery and Constable Lee. ||
In 1940 new workshops, including carpentry and plumb-
ing sections were undertaken at a cost of £3OOO.

Ambulances.
The Goulburn Ambulance Service dates from 1931 only.
The Ambulance station in Clifford Street was built in 1933
at a cost of £2688/4/8. The Annual report for the year
ending 30/6/1939 shewed a total income of £7578/17/2 and
a total expenditure of £6676/15/6. Accidents numbering 7990
were attended, transports totalled 4072 and the mileage
121,731. The staff consists of a Superintendent, 12 staff
officers, 2 collectors, 1 office assistant and 20 honorary
officers.*
The N.S.W. Railways Ambulance Corps was established
in 1885 with the object of training employees of the railways
department to render first aid in the matter of injury or
sudden illness. In 1885 classes were established in Sydney
and Newcastle. The Goulburn class was founded in 1887,
one of the first country centres to be identified with the
movement. It has furnished a class ever since. In 1900
an ambulance shield competition was launched to be com-
peted for by the best squad from various parts of the State.
Goulburn has won that shield twice. In 1905 A. B. Triggs
gave a silver cup to be competed for by ambulance men in
the Southern District. In 1905 it was won by A. Clark of
Goulburn. In 1923 this was altered to a competition by
squads of five men each.
In 1903 when the Goulburn Squad was “well down the
list” the “Penny Post” commisserated with the team in
verse:
“O Manny Rogers, where’s the shield,
You brought to us a year ago?
What time you met the serried squad
And laid the whole caboodle low?
The Goulburn District Ambulance Squad, competing in
Sydney on the 2/12/1939, won the Henderson Shield for the
third year in succession. Goulburn is the only country
centre which has taken the trophy from the metropolitan
area. It won the State Shield too.f
Libraries.
The first library was in premises near the Royal Hotel,
lent by Peter McCann, a tailor. £ This was in the forties.

As long ago as 1876 there was an agitation for a free public
library but nothing came of it then or in later years. Present
day libraries include the Mechanics’ Institute, and two dio-
cesan libraries (Anglican and Roman Catholic) and the
Railway Institute.
Meetings were held in Goulburn on the 22/8/1849 and
on the 17/2/1849 to form a public library. What was the
outcome is not now clear. The Mechanics’ Institute was in-
augurated at a meeting held at the Commercial Hotel on
the 27/9/1853. On the 11/10/1853 the first committee was
formed. The Rev. Wm. Ross was president, Chas. Dibden,
vice-president, D. Patterson, secretary and Mr. Marsden
treasurer. The committee numbered twelve. Its first
activities were mainly lectures, for which it purchased chem-
ical apparatus and an ''Electrifying machine.” The library
was formed in 1854. Evans Taylor was librarian. The
library was housed at the Commercial Hotel until 1855 when
it was removed to premises in Montague Street, owned by
McKean, a committeeman. The lectures and annual meet-
ings were held in the Court House. In 1854 a site was
granted for a library at the corner of Market Square, but
was later changed to the present site then described as "in
the section in which the gaol is situated.” The foundation
stone of the present building was laid on the 1/1/1858 by
the Rev. W. Ross. "The Oddfellows, the Mounted Patrol,
the Police, the Fire Brigade, the Band of Hope and all
Ministers of Religion” took part in the proceedings. The
Government promised £IOOO. Mr. Carson was the architect
for the original institute. In 1859 a bazaar brought in
£548. The Institute with the exception of the hall was
opened on the 2/1/1860. The Hall was opened in 1862.
In 1860 the rates on the institute property amounted to
£4/7/6 and the Municipal Council refunded this as a dona-
tion.
In 1863 the Institute conducted classes in Latin and
drawing, and arranged for the formation of debating and
discussion classes. The response was disappointing. In
1866 the Committee held an exhibition of "Works of Art
and Industry.” There was the phenomenal attendance of
3098.*
* Mech. Inst. Mins., 1853/1863,


In 1869 the hall was enlarged and licensed as a public
theatre. It was opened by Sir Alfred Stephen. The cost
of the additions was £839. All through the seventies the
annual reports record a lack of interest in and support for
the lectures arranged by the committee. In 1876 the In-
stitute was in low water generally. An accountant was
called in and an overhaul of all activities undertaken. All
the bondsmen who had signed a cash credit at the Bank
were “either dead or insolvent or have left the district.’ ’
By the end of the financial year things were much better.
In 1877 a skating-rink was added to the Institute’s
activities.* In 1881 the Institute was extended and a new
facade added. The cost was £llsO and the architect E. C.
Manfred, f
A storm ensued when the committee decided to open
the Reading Room for a few hours on Sunday afternoons.
The Rev. A. M. Tait (Presbyterian), the Rev. E. N. Morris
(Grammar School) and the Rev. G. M. D’Arcy Irvine op-
posed it bitterly. The Rev. D. M. Hulbert (Anglican) always
an original freelance, supported it. A branch of the Lord’s
Day Observance League was founded. In the service
register of St. Nicholas’ Church, North Goulburn, is an entry
by Canon D ’Arcy Irvine :
“There was an overwhelming congregation to hear my address
against the opening of Reading Rooms etc., on the Lord’s Day.”
Eventually in 1881 the project was defeated by 39 votes
to 374
The Mechanics’ Institute Committee declined to let its
hall to J. E. Redmond, M.P., for a lecture on the Irish
National Land League. The organisers erected a tent at
the rear of the Salutation Inn. Redmond’s advertisements
concluded “Vivat Regina. ”§
From 1885 to 1900 the Technical classes were held here
and in 1886 a class room was built for their accommodation.
In 1928 the building was remodelled at a cost of £7750.
The public hall was abandoned and its space thrown into
the main building. H. C. Manfred was the architect. The
principal activity of the Institute as at present constituted is

its library of 30,000 volumes. There is a large reading
room and smaller rooms for games and meetings.
The Council subsidised the Mechanics’ Institute to the
extent of £250 in 1935 and received the congratulations of
the Commonwealth Librarian.*
The diocesan library (Anglican) is now at the Church
House and is available to clergy, students and others. In
1892 Mrs. Thomas, widow of the first Bishop of Goulburn,
gave his library to the diocese. At first it was housed in
the Cathedral. Then Bishop Chalmers’ books were added.
In 1902 the library was removed to the old Diocesan
Registry, in 1924 to the new Church House. Books from
nine other libraries or collections have since been added,
whilst in recent years considerable moneys have been spent
upon it. The library now consists of some 7000 works,
chiefly of Biblical, patristic, historical, ecclesiastical and
theological nature. There are a number of interesting and
comparatively rare works of the Elizabethan and Caroline
divines, unique in Australian libraries. Attached to the
library is the nucleus of a diocesan museum, bearing on the
history of the diocese and already containing many interest-
ing exhibits. Preserved also in the Church House are the
early records of most of the parishes in the diocese, including
the Goulburn registers from 1838.1
The diocesan library (Roman Catholic) was founded by
Bishop Barry in 1938. It is contained in the new building,
which also houses the technical school, at the rear of St.
Patrick’s primary school in Verner Street.

CHAPTER XIII.
NEWSPAPERS.
HE first mention of newspapers in connection with
Goulburn occurs in the Waugh correspondence:
“It will be seen from the letters, that the writer received, at
the distance of 130 miles, three Sydney newspapers per week;
and as the communication with the country is now so much
facilitated, both in respect of time and frequency, and the roads
in the interior of the colony are undergoing such daily improve-
ment by the government, the periodical literature of Britain, as
well as that of the colonial capital, where literary, scientific, and
agricultural societies already exist, will quickly circulate through
the remotest quarters of that extensive territory.”*
The actual letter mentioned was dated “December 1836.
In it David Waugh says:
.. .my talk is of bullocks; I am out of the intellectual world,
and except the three weekly newspapers, Colonist, and Herald,
and Times, none of them very bright, I have not, I may say,
read another book than those I brought out with me....”t
C. Meehan quoted another letter of David Waugh’s:
“I go down to Kinghorne’s, ten miles away, Cardross and
Strathallen where a post office was established in 1835, to read
the news or the papers that used to come by the early sailing
ships, such as the North Britain, the Midlothian, the Wallace,
etc.
He went on to say:
“That it was in August 1842 that the first number of the
“(Sydney Morning) Herald” was sent to Goulburn, and in
appreciation of the spirited proprietors of that time, the in-
habitants of Goulburn congratulated them on the work of their
unremitting exertions in contributing to what was called a
luxury.”!
Dr. Waugh acted as agent for the “Sydney Morning
Herald” and accounts for subscriptions thereto on his own
account forms “R. Waugh, Surgeon, Goulburn” and others
on “The Medical Hall, Goulburn” account forms are extant.
It was not until 1848 that Goulburn produced its own
newspapers. In that year three were founded. Un-
fortunately the files of many of its earliest papers have
disappeared altogether. Those of the “Herald” exist in
part in the Mitchell Library and in Goulburn. Those of
the “Penny Post” are almost complete in Goulburn and in
Sydney. Only a few copies exist of other papers and some
have disappeared entirely.

An early journalist with some connection with Goul-
burn, was E. H. Jenkins, one of the editors of the “Sydney
Gazette.’ ’ He died at “ Wollondilly ” the residence of
Peter Stuckey at North Goulburn on the 8/2/1837.*
The “Goulburn Herald” was founded in 1848 by W.
Jones, who, in the thirties, had the “Commercial Journal”
in Sydney. In 1841 he owned and produced the “Free
Press,” also in Sydney.!
Another early Goulburn paper was the “Chronicle.”
No copies have survived. There is extant a prohibition
pamphlet “The Maine Liquor Law,” an extract from the
“Edinburgh Review” of July 1854, reprinted by Vernon
and Mellin, Printers, at the “Chronicle” office Goulburn.
A Mr. Brent is said to have drawn up the prospectus
of the “Herald” in 1847. From 1848 to 1860 the “Goulburn
Herald” was produced on a hand press. From 1860 it
was “printed by steam,” the second provincial paper to be
so produced. The “Herald” took over the “Chronicle” in
1864. The first leader of the amalgamated papers dealt
with the tribulations of country journalism. Both papers
had “ceased to return a profit.” It proceeded to be very
sarcastic at the sanguine expectations in the prospectus of
a projected rival. The Riley family owned and produced
the “Herald” from 1857. For the greater part of its
existence it was a tri-weekly evening paper. In its closing
years it was a morning daily.!
It was amalgamated with the “Evening Post” in
1927. Its own files were destroyed by fire.
The “Banner,” the first paper of this name in Goulburn,
was a Presbyterian publication. It was advertised in 1848
as:
“A truly Protestant Religious paper in the cause of Truth and
in the name of God.”
Its cost was 3d. per month. It purported to protest
“against error or false doctrines.” The publisher was the
Rev. Wm. Ross at the Manse. §
Another paper started in 1848 was “The Goulburn
Mail” of which no copies have been found. The “Goul-
burn Times” was founded in the year 1852, the Editor a

Mr. Poulson. As no copies appear to exist it is impossible
to give many details.
The first issue was on the 27/8/1852. A Mr. Isaac was
the proprietor. Poulson, the editor, was previously a re-
porter on the “Goulburn Herald.” R. Wilson, formerly the
Editor of the “Louisana Planters’ Banner” was in Goulburn
at that time and as he was related to Isaac, may have been
employed upon the “ Times. ”*
Established in 1867 “The Southern Observer” was pub-
lished by the Diocese of Goulburn (Anglican). No copies
have survived, which is a pity, for they would be interesting.
It was shockingly mismanaged and involved the Church in
considerable financial loss. But financial mismanagement
was not its only sin. In the “Goulburn Herald” of the
14th October, 1868, there is a statement headed “Newspaper
Plagiarism.” The writer affirmed that the “Goulburn
Herald’s” report at the Synod meeting had been copied word
for word by the “Southern Observer” without any acknow-
ledgment. He said further, “our reports have previously
been made use of by the ‘ Observer, ’ but we believe that they
have on these occasions generally been acknowledged,
though in a less conspicuous way than is usual and in such
a manner as to lead persons at a distance to the conclusion
that they were copied from the ‘Sydney Morning Herald,’
rather than from the ‘ ‘ Goulburn Herald ”. . . . As we have
never been asked and as even the form of acknowledgment
has now been abandoned, we shall be obliged to the con-
ductors of the “Southern Observer” if in future they will
depend upon their own resources and not avail themselves
of our columns in any way whatever. ’ ’
On the 21st October the writer returned to the attack,
affirming that the editors of the “Southern Observer” had
avowed in their leading columns their intentions to continue
literary larcencies at pleasure. Replying to a statement in
the “Observer” that the “Herald” had not been as cour-
teous at it might have been, he said, “In reality we have
said nothing about the ‘Observer’ either in praise or cen-
sure ; have not even seen it above a dozen times; and whoever
asserts that we have ever applied the word ‘rag’ to it or
any other newspaper whatever is guilty of direct falsehood.
In fact our discourtesy has consisted of the very treatment
* C. Meehan, “E.P.P.,” 18/12/1895.


we desire extended to ourselves —we have let the ‘Observer’
alone.” He added that the "Observer” almost from its first
issue had abused the "Herald,” and its conductors, and that
in some instances the abuse had extended over several col-
umns in the one publication, that it had even gone "so far
as to publish comments on the personal appearance of our
publisher.” "Its very last issue contains a letter in which,
so far as we can understand it at all, personal violence to-
wards one of our staff is approvingly hinted at ”
Finally, to add to the aroma of the whole proceedings
in respect to this journalistic venture, the report of the de-
bate in the Synod minutes and the report in the "Goulburn
Herald” do not agree in several respects. It would seem
that the former was unduly condensed or judicially edited.*
Curiously enough, out of this extraordinary journalistic
venture were born Goulburn’s next two newspapers. The
first was short-lived. It was started by J. L. Harris, who
in 1870 bought from the Anglican authorities the plant of
the "Southern Observer” and founded a paper which he
called the "Early Bird.” J. W. L. Thomson in some
reminiscences written in 1935, said:
“A libel action was brought against him and he had to pay
something like £IOOO damages.”
The article which occasioned the libel action is said to
have been written by J. Henniker Heaton. No copies of
the paper appear to have survived. J. L. Harris sold out
to G. A. Gray. Upon the ruins of the "Southern Observer”
and the "Early Bird” Gray established the "Goulburn
Evening Penny Post.” G. A. Gray, who was born in 1843,
was apprenticed to Isaac Pitman in 1858. He came to
Australia soon afterwards. His first engagement was with
the "Goulburn Herald.” He is said to have established
the "Goulburn Evening Penny Post” in 1871, almost im-
mediately afterwards disposing of it to Thomas Daniel, with
whom however, for a short time he was in partnership. The
partnership of Daniel and Gray was the subject of some
local verse:
“Well printed as any,
Our paper today,
And sold for one penny
By Daniel and Gray.”!
* Hist. Dio. Gbn. pp. 129/130.
t “E.P.P.,” 1/7/1927, 18/12/1935.


Later still Gray bought the “Yass Tribune.” He died
in Goulburn in 1891. Under a succession of able editors,
T, J. Hebblewhite, Tennyson Smith, H. P. S. Finn, and M. H.
Dart, the “Post” has grown from a small 4 page tri-weekly
to the substantial daily of to-day. George Martyr, who is
referred to in several capacities elsewhere in this history,
was at one time reporter on the Goulburn “Herald.” He
was appointed Editor of the “E.P.P. ” in 1879. #
Thomas Daniel was succeeded in the ownership by
Walter T. and Alfred, his sons. Alfred Daniel died in 1920,
and Walter continued as owner until 1927, when a pro-
prietary company was formed and he bcame chairman of
directors. It is still owned by Daniel Brothers and Com-
pany Pty. Ltd. The “Goulburn Evening Penny Post”
carried as a sub-heading for many years: “(Established
1870—Printed by Steam.) ”f It changed its name to the
“Goulburn Evening Post” in 1940.
“The Southern Argus” was established in 1874 and was
conducted by John Walsh in a building now forming part
of Knowlman’s store. The proprietors in the eighties were
James Locke and Wm. Oram. In 1885 it became the
“Southern Daily Argus” with an alternative title “The
Daily Evening Argus.”
The first paper in Goulburn called the “Free Press’
circulated all about 1878. No copies appear to have been
preserved.
Another “Goulburn Chronicle” appeared in 1883,
launched by McLean and Vernon. It was shortly after-
wards (1884) incorporated in the “Goulburn Herald.” There
are a few copies in the Mitchell Library. The “Gunning
Leader” was absorbed about the same time.J The “Goul-
burn Evening Star” appeared about 1889 and came to an
end in 1894. It was established in the Protectionist interest
then a very live political issue.
William Gale was the managing director of the “Goul-
burn Evening Star,” and W. G. Armstrong, A. M. Betts,
William Gale, Thomas Marsden and William H. Oram the
proprietors. § It was ably conducted. James Locke was

the editor. Its office was in Auburn Street. When the
venture was closed down Locke bought the plant and re-
moved to other premises in Auburn Street (opposite Knowl-
man’s) where he produced “Young Folks,” “The Month,”
and “The Spectator.” Later still his establishment was
moved twice to other premises in Auburn Street, in the last
of which the business is still conducted. In the first of
these he produced the “Werriwa Times.” No copies of
the “Goulburn Spectator” appear to have survived.
“The Young Folks” was a 16 pp. paper illustrated, the
second number of which appeared on the 3/8/1897. It was
published by James Locke at the “Star” office. This par-
ticular issue had nothing in it of any great interest to young
people. There were some historical notes of Goulburn, an
article on Mary’s Mount (the Passionist monastery) another
on the Kenmore Hospital and one on the Railway. A sub-
sidiary title was “The Illustrated Souvenir.” “The
Month” was a publication advertised 31/8/1897 as “To be
continued.” It was planned by James Locke at the “Star”
Office. No copies have been traced. # “The Werriwa
Times and Goulburn District News” was another pro-
tectionist paper, published by Locke and Barrett in 1901.
A file from 2/8/01 to 31/12/01 is in the Mitchell Library.
It endeavoured to float itself as a Limited Company. Geo.
Broadhead of Inverary Park, Bungonia; Patrick Heff email,
Gurrundah, and A. B. Chisholm, “Carrawarra,” comprised
the provisional directorate.! Chas. MacAlister contributed
some “Recollections of an Argyle Pioneer.” Poetry was
called in to aid its political reasoning:
“He had French sardines for supper,
Got tight on British beer,
And he dreamt on a German bedstead
That a Wambaroo bit his ear.”+
A second Anglican venture was the “Monthly Paper”:
“Its earlier issues are not numbered. It began in February
1893. The registry files are incomplete but it would appear
to have continued until June 1903. At first it was described
as of the ‘Church of England in the City of Goulburn/ later
‘of the parishes of S. Saviour and Christ Church Goulburn/
and in its later years ‘for contributing parishes in the diocese
of Goulburn/ It was mostly an 8 pp. Bvo. magazine. It was
a poor thing though, on the whole.”
* C. J. Locke. 22/5/1939.
t “Werriwa Times,” 19/8/1901.
t “Werriwa Times,” 20/9/1901.


A third Anglican venture is the “Southern Church-
man ’ ’ :
“This first saw the light on the 1/3/1903, and was founded by
Bishop Barlow. The Rev J. W. (afterwards Archdeacon)
Ward had much to do with its launching. It has had its ‘ups
and downs’ but in the thirty-two years of its publication has
consistently maintained a high standard for a journal with a
limited appeal. For many years the late Archdeacon Bartlett
edited it and though one might not always agree with his judg-
ments, his comments were always fresh and original.”*
The Goulburn “Echo” was established in 1909 by Hard-
castle and Burns. Its one and only issue (4000 copies) con-
tained a scathing attack on the Goulburn Liedertafel and
its members. The subsequent controversy filled columns
of the “Penny Post’s” advertising pages.t
The “Cathedral Chimes,” the organ of the Roman
Catholic Church in Goulburn, is a well printed illustrated
monthly. It has a large circulation. A number of adver-
tising sheets have appeared from time to time, enjoyed a
brief popularity or served a temporary need and have then
disappeared. Amongst such have been the “Goulburn
Banner,” the second paper of that name, published for some
years by A. B. Beer. It was succeeded in 1938 by the “Free
Press’ the second paper of that name in Goulburn. This
is published by H. J. and W. A. Beer.
There have been some delightful high-lights in Goul-
burn journalism. Here are a few picked more or less at
random.
Two delightful advertisements, 1848:

Another in 1850 revealed a touching faith:

I Gbn. “ Herald/ ; 16/9/1848, 2/12/1848,


“If the person who bought a copy of ‘King’s Own’ at the ‘Goul-
burn Herald’ office IS AN HONEST MAN he will call and
refund overplus change.”
A frank advertisement was:
“Wanted
A Person qualified to teach a family in the Country,
short distance from Goulburn. NO DRUNKARD
need apply.
Apply Mr. Collins
Victoria Stores,
GOULBURN.”
An unusual advertisement was:
“Wife Wanted
Applicants to be on Parade Ground on Saturday 28th,
when advertiser will select.”*
“Journalese” is no new invention. Nearly seventy
years ago the “Penny Post” made sure that the victim of an
accident was dead. It reported:
“The vital spark has fled, his
neck being broken and his
brains completely knocked out.”
When Governor Hercules Robinson visited Goulburn on
the 26/11/1872 he was given an address to which he read
a reply. The “Penny Post” stated: “The Governor, who
appeared calm and fully sensible of the important duty de-
volving upon him, read. .. . ” etc.
Describing the death of an old resident it said:
“He was took with a liver attack, which resulted in an attack
of dropsy. He had to be tapped on Monday week when twenty
quarts of water were taken from him.”t
Reporting a case of sunstroke, the “Goulburn Herald”
informed its readers:
“that it was supposed he received a coup de soleil.”t
The “Southern Argus” was frequently guilty of journa-
lese. It described the lock-up as “durance vile.” A
prisoner with a black eye was referred to as “the possessor
of a discoloured optic of remarkable dimensions.” The
usual Monday morning drunks were “disciples of Bacchus.”
Its cables were “telegraphic intelligence.” The condition
of drunkenness was ascribed to “partaking of too many
revivifiers.” The policeman making the arrest was “an
able-bodied minion of the law.” “The proverbial drop too

much” and “the blue-coated fraternity” are other ways in
which the “Argus” conveyed the arrest of the drunk by the
police.
Changing customs are indicated by this advertisement :
“Immigrants for Hire
Immigrants will arrive in Goulburn probably on Friday
or Saturday next and will be for hire,
George F. Wise.”
and
“Wanted, large and healthy leeches.”
A peculiar advertisement was that of F. Herbert Gall
of the Retreat Lime Works threatening prosecution of tres-
passers who gave his men spirits to induce them to leave
their work.
There are many references to valentines. One such is:
“It is estimated that no fewer than five thousand valentines
have passed through the Goulburn Post Office this week.*’
A good story of resourceful woman appeared in the
“Goulburn Herald:”
“On Monday last at a sale in Goldsmith Street, two women bought
a large iron bedstead; and after some bartering with the local
barrow-man as to his fee for carrying it to their house, which
fee the purchasers considered too high, the spirited ladies set
to work and wheeled the bedstead on its own rollers.... to the
south part of Bourke Street, no inconsiderable distance.”*
The local press was frequently more truthful than tact-
ful. At the opening of St. Saviour’s Cathedral it apologised
for the inadequacy of its report of the sermon of the Primate
(Barry).
“The sermon having been read in a very rapid manner from
manuscript, we are unable to give more than the above brief
and imperfect outline.”!
Nor did it worry about the risk of libel. Reporting
the departure of a citizen the ‘ ‘ Goulburn Herald ’ ’ said:
“the late manager of the skating rink at the Oddfellows’ Hall
has departed from Goulburn under circumstances the reverse
of creditable.... leaving behind a large number of enquiring
and sorrowing friends.”
A quaint advertisement was:
“Wanted respectable and practical Housekeeper,
40-45 years, whose birthday must fall in August,
without encumbrances, also a Protestant. View
Matrimonial.

The Poets’ Corner ran to lugubrious verse, as e.g.:
“Your brow is cold, the spirit gone
Your eye has lost its light,
Your truthful tongue is silent now
That taught me what was right.”*
Which was inscribed by “a daughter to her dead
mother.” All the Goulburn newspapers had these “Poets’
Corners” in the eighties. The verses were for the main
part platitudinous and sentimental. One would appear to
have anticipated Vers Libre:
“It was Christmas Eve, and
Old Dick was sitting by the fireside in his cottage
‘The cruel sea’! he murmured;
‘lt has robbed me of my dear grandson.’ ”1
That in the “Goulburn Herald” accommodated a poem
on ‘ ‘ Whilst watching our Dear Father dying. ’ ’ One stanza
will suffice:
“He was rising, and not setting
It was not night but day;
Not in darkness, but in sunshine,
Like a star he went away. ”
In the nineties it was funnier than ever as e.g.:
“Sweet thoughts our bosoms swell and thrill,
At Even;
Bell-birds the air with music fill,
At Even.”
Other sentiments in the same poem included:
“Past actions come and go at will”
“Our fears and foes seem to decrease”
“Another daily web is spun.”t
A quaint advertisement was that of “Sermon Paper,”
designed “expressly for those who write their sermons.”
This was stocked by the Goulburn Book Mart, though one
may doubt as to whether the demand was such as to justify
a displayed advertisement.
The Rev. Daniel P. M. Hulbert had a sardonic wit. He
advertised for information which would lead to the convic-
tion of persons who had ringbarked 80 trees on his property,
and added as a footnote:
“Orders for Posts, Rails, Palings, Shingles, etc., can now be

Tenders were invited for “300/500 Native Cats.” “An
endless and original assortment of Valentines” was adver-
tised, and three years later a displayed advertisement
announced them as obtainable at the “Herald” Book Mart.
Madam Chalk, Clairvoyant, announced that she would
see “patients” at the Commercial Hotel. Fryer and Coy’s.
Circus was described as “Chaste, moral and unique.”
Another choice example of journalese was:
“RAIN
On last Friday evening we had a very heavy downpour
of this much needed element.”
Which was matched by a Bungendore correspondent in
1920 who reported and the newspaper printed that the
weather was “in statu quo.” The newspapers were
singularly frank half a century ago, e.g.: on one occasion
the “Southern Argus” reported a funeral conducted by the
Rev. G. M. D'Arcy Irvine, rector of North Goulburn. It
described his funeral oration as “painfully long and un-
interesting” and “finally concluded with a grand flourish
of 4fs’ and the benediction.” The “Goulburn Herald”
had a questionable taste at times. Describing a pig weigh-
ing 585 lbs. it compared it to the superintendent of the Fire
Brigade as “about his length but a trifle fatter.” The
“Penny Post” in 1890 wrote of “flat-headed ratepayers,
not even able to put together half a sentence grammatic-
ally .... if the bile is unusually plentiful they publish
their views in the press.... the editor kindly correcting
their grammar and reducing their spelling to the modern
ideal.”
The “Penny Post” was tinged with republicanism in
the nineties. It published some verses on “Albert Edward’s
bald patch.... Hanoverian fat.... gout... rheumat-
ism .... teeth dropping out.... and the many big stockings
well filled (by Victoria) with coin on the shelves.
It reported an inquest in 1891 as follows:
“They found him in the river,
(Its enough to make one shiver)
And he was dead as any Britisher could be!
So they made of him a dry *un
And took him to O’Brien,
Who straightway held an inquest the cause of death to see.

Not all the Poets’ Corner effusions were bathos and
sentiment. A long ode “Australia Federata” 1/1/1901, by
T. J. Hebblewhite was at least as good as many which ob-
tained wider publicity:
“.... We can but lift dim eyes and bless
The years, the men, the spirit of the past,
The harvest of whose tears is reaped in joy at last.”
The Loch Ness monster had nothing on the bird-beast-
reptile described as appearing locally. It had “a body as
big as a goose, a head as big as a diver’s body, or, more
correctly, a retriever’s head. It dives like a porpoise, is
black and seems to have hair upon its body and a long neck
like a crane.” The apparition was vouched for by a well-
known settler.
Later correspondence suggested it was a “bunyip” or
a “loon” and added that it made a sound “like the bellow-
ing of half a dozen bulls.” The “Penny Post” was guilty
of a choice piece of journalese in describing the arrange-
ments for the entertainment of certain senators in 1902:
“it was decided that Mr. Ashley should cater
to the gustatory necessities of the party.”
A peculiar displayed advertisement appeared in 1903:
“WITHOUT PREJUDICE
The POLICE ought to STEP IN and Prevent Mrs. BRUTON’S
COWS from disturbing the whole neighbourhood. For the last
. few weeks Dr. McKillop and others have had to withstand the
nuisance without complaining; but it is high time the Authorities
took some action to conserve the rights of the citizens. —A
GREAT SUFFERER.”
The “Penny Post” hailed the “Baby Bonus” in 1914
with a poem of which the following was the first verse:
“Now I’ve grown old I do not care
To walk in Auburn Street,
For on its pavements, I declare,
Great dangers one will meet.
For since the Fisher Bonus came
(The thing that Cook would damn)
I’m sure that every Goulburn dame
Has bought her child a pram.”*

Bishop Radford in the 1920 Synod advocated an Aus-
tralian hymn book. The "Penny Post” offered one
specimen verse :
“When’er I take my walks abroad.
The Wallaby I see,
And the pretty little possum
Esconsed in leafy tree.
The busy locust chirps away,
With its infernal din,
And makes the sinner realise
The weary weight of sin.”t
During the influenza scare in 1919 Bishop Radford
advised the congregation in St. Saviour’s Cathedral to sit
"two in a pew.” The "Penny Post” improved on this:
“I sat with you:
My love it grew:
I blest the ‘flue,
Two in a pew.”
“I always knew
We loved, we two:
Life’s round well do,
Two in a pew.”l
One of Bishop Chalmers’ Synod charges received undue
prominence in consequence of a Sydney compositor’s error.
The Bishop had been talking about (1) unfermented wine
and (2) the benefactions of the late Hon. Jas. Chisholm. A
Sydney weekly reproduced his remarks as affirming "that
he had this unfermented wine analysed and it was found to
contain more alchohol than the family of the late Hon. James
Chisholm.” The late A. B. Chisholm was fond of telling
this story. §
The "Penny Post” told a good story against itself in
one of its souvenir numbers. Its rival, the ‘ ‘ Southern Morn-

death of a man blown to pieces by a premature discharge

his country correspondent why he had failed to send the
news through.
“Its a bit early yet,” replied the correspondent, “I'm
waiting on the inquest to find out what the deceased died
from.”*
The “Ritualistic Reporter” appeared in the “Evening

where. It is a 24 pp. monthly journal, handset and printed

CHAPTER XIV.
THE COMTE DE ROSSI AND THE GOULBURN
CATHEDRAL DISPUTE.*
OR ten years Goulburn was “news” in the world
press; the occasion has come to be known as the
“Goulburn Cathedral Dispute.” The story is too
long to be told in full even here in a separate chapter. It
may be read in part in the author’s “History of the Diocese
of Goulburn,” or the longer “Comte de Rossi and the
Goulburn Cathedral Dispute” in the R.A.H.S. Journal for
1938. Even then much remains unwritten except for con-
temporary newspaper reports. For some years there is
little else in the files of the “Goulburn Herald,” “Evening
Penny Post,” and the “Southern Argus,” but reports of
police court, equity court and supreme court litigation,
arising out of Rossi’s actions and claims.
F. N. Rossi, the elder, was a trustee of old St. Saviour’s
Church and glebe. F. R. L. Rossi, the younger, from 1864
played a very useful and generous part in the development
of the diocese for some years. This can be seen in the
reports of the Goulburn Church Society and in the Synod
addresses of Bishop Thomas. In the Rossi correspondence
in the Mitchell Library there is a letter from Bishop Thomas,
acknowledging receipt of £957/9/9 collected by Rossi for
the Bishopric Endowment. He was Registrar of the dio-
cese from 1865 to 1884. At first his duties were discharged
punctiliously. In later years, during the Cathedral and
other disputes and litigation, his duties were much neglected,
which neglect was, on more than one occasion, the subject
of comment in Synod.
When in 1892 the ten years’ dispute, controversies and
litigation, here conveniently lumped together as “The Goul-
burn Cathedral Dispute,” were approaching their end, the
“Sydney Morning Herald” wrote:
“It was said that there was only one person in the world that
fully understood the Schleswig-Holstein question. But it is
doubtful whether any man living ever understood the question
of the Goulburn Cathedral.”
* Except where otherwise stated all the facts in this chapter are
from “Hist. Dio. Gbn/’ pp. 86/98, and “K.A.H.S. Journal/'
Vol. XXIV, pt. II, pp. 113/132.


Bishop Chalmers, in his impartial summary in 1895,
gives a useful analysis:
“It was a threefold difficulty, and like a “threefold cord” it was
not too quickly broken. There was first of a 11.... a dispute
as to the trusteeship. This was settled by the judgment of
the Equity Court (28/7/1893) and my subsequent appointment
to the sole trusteeship. ... (8/11/1893) . There was a further
dispute as to the parochial character of the Cathedral Church.
This was settled by the Cathedral Ordinance.... (6/4/1894),
which obtained legal validation by an Act of Parliament
(20/11/1894) . Then there remained a claim by the Incumbent
of St. Saviour’s Parish.... This claim by the Act of Parliament
was referred to arbitration.”
Even now it is hard to understand and, looking back
on it, to apportion the blame. Still more difficult is it to
see why it could not have been resolved earlier, or why it
was allowed to reach the dimensions it did. It certainly
is not for want of material that this difficulty of comprehen-
sion arises. There are books of newspaper correspondence
extant extending over three years; there are pamphlets
issued by the contestants; there are the Synod reports and
the law reports, and columns upon columns in the news-
paper files, so much so that a contemporary account says:
“By the very redundancy of explanation, and by the unceasing
din that has surrounded the dispute, the mind of man has been
thrown into that condition of obfuscation and bewilderment that
the very mention of the Goulburn Cathedral has been followed
by a state of mental collapse.”
The good Bishop, in his studiously impartial summary,
makes no reference to the almost incredible and bizarre
incidents of the dispute, a garbled version of which forms
part of the plot of an Australian novel.* Another instance
of truth being stranger, much stranger, than fiction. To
quote a press comment:
“There is a floating vision of a votive tablet, the click of
hammers and the fall of plaster, the hushed sound of stealthy
feet. We see as in a camera a church, a school, a cathedral,
performing a series of processes of involution, and evolution,
and revolution, while there is a sound as of revelry by night
within barricaded doors, and a black flag is floating from a
minaret, and the solemn voice of ecclesiastical command comes
rolling back from cathedral aisles in echoes hoarse and hollow,
of defiance.”
Previous to that, in 1889 Isaac Shepherd wrote:
“In my opinion the whole and sole cause of this unhappy
division has arisen from due care not having been exercised
before a stone of the new building was laid in seeing that a
proper title to the land for cathedral purposes was in exist-
ence . ”
* Helen Simpson’s “Boomerang.”


The late Archdeacon Spencer observed :
“Want of foresight, lack of business capacity and (it must be
said!) a desire and readiness to do by exercise of arbitary
power what should have been done in a strictly legal manner.
The Bishop’s Letters Patent it is to be feared had a bad in-
fluence here.”
This is fair comment, for Archdeacon Spencer was of
the “Cathedral Party,’ ’ although he later protested “a
plague on both your houses.”
But, as tempers rose, all sorts of extraordinary things
happened as, e.g., when Rossi took possession of the fur-
niture vessels, books and vestments of the Church Hall, in
order to force Archdeacon Puddicombe to use the Cathedral
when the Bishop prohibited him to do so; as when the Bishop
deprived Puddicombe of his archdeaconry and, having re-
frained for five years from licensing him, accused him
of attending Synod without a license (March 4, 1891) or
as when Rossi, ordered by the Supreme Court to give up the
keys of the Cathedral gave them to Puddicombe instead of
to the Bishop (January 17, 1891).
The Dispute as to the Trusteeship.
The dispute as to the trusteeship of the Cathedral pro-
perties has naturally been overshadowed by the more hectic
dispute as to the nature of the Cathedral and the startling
incidents of side issues with Rossi. But all these things
were connected. The misunderstandings about the trustee-
ship would never have reached the courts but for the fear
of the Parochial Party that its glebe was to be alienated.
Under the old Church Acts a complicated system of local
trusteeship had grown up. When the 1881 and 1889
Church of England Property Trust Acts were passed, they
were imperfectly understood, and their bearings on the
trustees appointed under the former order misunderstood,
with the result that for the Cathedral site and the St.
Saviour’s glebe two sets of trustees were contending that
they were the proper successors of the original grantees.
The position was complicated by government resumptions
and the payment of the compensation moneys to Captain
Rossi as the surviving trustee of the old order. These
things were the subject of major actions on their own ac-
count and determining factors in others. It was not until
1893 that the Gordian knot was cut by the Supreme Court,
which brushed aside both sets of claimants and appointed
the Bishop sole trustee.


The Dispute as to the Parochial Character of the Cathedral
Church.
Mr. Justice A. H. Simpson wrote:
“It would seem easy to foresee, except that things easy to
foresee are just the things that no one does foresee, that the
erection of a cathedral on land granted by the Crown for the
erection of a parish church would give rise to dispute as to the
character of the building, whether it was a cathedral pure and
simple, or a parish church as well as a cathedral. Unfortunately
the dispute became embittered by partisan and personal feelings
on either side, until a difference, which a piece of red tape ap-
plied at the right time might have prevented, became magnified
into a chasm, which threatened to split the diocese into two
hostile camps.”
The Cathedral was built upon a site granted by the
Crown for a parish church. As a parish church it was sub-
ject to the provisions of the Church Acts 7, William IV, No.
3 and 8, William IV, No. 5. The Cathedral obviously re-
quired a different constitution, which constitution in so far
as it contravened or superseded an Act of Parliament, would
inevitably also require not only synodical sanction, but con-
firmation or validation by the State Legislature. There
were three courses open:
(a) The provision of a new constitution as a cathedral
church and the complete severance of any identity with
the old parish church which preceded it. This solution
was possibly not the Bishop’s and the Synod’s first in-
tention, but was the attitude both were led to adopt
in the heat and bitterness of the controversy.
(b) The identification of the new Cathedral with the former
parish church, i.e., its recognition as a parish church
to be used as a cathedral. This solution again was not
perhaps the first intention of the St. Saviour’s Parochial
Defence Committee, but again in the development of the
controversy its intentions hardened into this. The
attempt to identify the old St. Saviour’s with the new
school-hall used as a church during the building of the
Cathedral, by Bishop Thomas on the advice of the
Chancellor, added to the controversy and the bitterness
of the controversy whilst the issue, during the dispute,
by the Bishop of all sorts of documents under seal, pur-
porting to license this or that, or to withdraw this or
that, to authorize and to inhibit, to appoint and to de-
prive, all tended to cloud the issue and to exasperate
the contestants. »

(c) The recognition of St. Saviour’s as a cathedral to be
used as a parish church and the provision of a con-
stitution for the cathedral as such with adequate
recognition of parochial rights. This was the solution
eventually proposed by Bishop Chalmers, ratified by
the Cathedral Ordinance of 1894 and validated by the
Goulburn Cathedral Validation Act of 1894. It was
admittedly a compromise, but like many another com-
promise, it worked, has worked and is working.
Upon the second reading of the bill on October 18 1894
the Hon. R. H. D. White said:
The passing of this bill will settle one of the most vexatious
and painful disputes which ever occurred in the history of the
Church of England in this colony. The dispute, I have no
hesitation in saying, helped to kill one bishop and cast a slur
on the Church in the eyes of every denomination in the colony,
through the able and kindly interposition of the present Bishop
of Goulburn a bill has been framed which meets with the general
approval of not only the whole of the church people, but the
bynod of the diocese. The incumbent of the Cathedral, one of
the strongest opponents of previous measures, is quite satisfied
with the bill.”
The Claims of Archdeacon Puddicombe.
Archdeacon Puddicombe would seem to have had some
real claim (although the Court did not recognize it) for,
in 1894, part of Bishop Chalmer’s compromise provided for
the submission of his claims to arbitration. He was awarded
£lOO. The claim dated back to 1884. In 1887, independ-
ently of all other actions and litigation, Archdeacon Puddi-
combe, at the instance of the St. Saviour’s Parochial Defence
Committee, brought one against the Cathedral Trustees
(Puddicombe v Rossi and others, 1887) to set aside in part
an agreement he had entered into with the trustees of St.
Saviour’s Glebe, and advancing a claim to the interest on
certain resumption compensation moneys. He lost his case
and had to pay the costs of the defendants (with the ex-
ception of Rossi). That same year application was made
to the Legislative Council to pass a bill giving Puddi-
combe £3OO from the glebe revenues, but Captain Rossi, who
had another suit pending at the time, petitioned against the
bill and was successful in his opposition.
in 1891 Puddicombe contemplated another Equity suit
against the Bishop to:


1. Have the Cathedral declared “primarily the parish church;”
2. Restore his rights as incumbent therein;
3. Secure a license from the Bishop;
4. Restrain the Bishop from interfering with his rights in the
“Parochial and Cathedral Church;”
5. Have enquiry made into his loss and damage.
This was avoided by the reference of Puddicombe’s
claims to arbitration in the Gonlbnrn Cathedral Validation
Act of 1894. Previous to that, in 1892 he was worrying
the Vicar-General, Dean Pownall, with all sorts of threatened
actions. Having been appointed Canon Residentiary of the
Cathedral by Bishop Thomas, he resigned as such during
the interregnum and claimed the Cathedral afresh as his
parish church. Again both sides consulted eminent counsel
and all was in train for yet another battle when Bishop
Chalmers was enthroned.
It is difficult now to apportion the blame for all these
differences. Reading the voluminous correspondence and
instruction papers, it would seem that both sides in this
series of disputes were frequently in the wrong. The Bishop
and “The Cathedral Party” undoubtedly acted in a high-
handed manner with the parochial properties and endow-
ments, Archdeacon Puddicombe appears to have assisted at
some of Rossi’s actions, whilst the Bishop’s actions in
confiscating, holding and endorsing with new conditions
Puddicombe’s license were arbitrary in the extreme. Both
parties appear to have shifted their ground from time to
time, to have entered into agreements, undertakings and
understandings, and subsequently evacuated them.
The Rossi Tablet and the Siege of the Cathedral.
The strangest of all these happenings, however, was
Rossi’s two seizures of the Cathedral in 1887 and 1891. In
the old St. Saviour’s Church was a tablet erected by Rossi
to the memory of his parents. This was removed to the
Church Hall during the building of the Cathedral. When
the Cathedral was completed Rossi sought permission to
re-erect it there. The Bishop refused permission, declaring
the Church Hall was St. Saviour’s Parish Church, whereupon
Rossi took possession of the Cathedral and re-erected the
tablet by force. Subsequently the Bishop removed it.
History repeated itself, Rossi re-erected the tablet for the
second time and this time refused to give up possession of
the Cathedral, remaining there to protect it. Previously


he had interrupted the Cathedral services by brawling, for
which he was prosecuted in the police court.
Livingston Hopkins (“Hop”) of the “Bulletin” illus-
trated these doings in an inimitable page in the “Bulletin”,
reproduced here.
The press was mostly hostile to the Bishop and the
“Cathedral Party.” The “Penny Post” in particular was
unrestrained in its criticism. On one occasion when Rossi
had locked out Bishop Thomas and Dr. Ellis, it published
what it called “An Irreverent Ditty”:
“There was a lordly bishop
And he had a little dishup
With his senior Trustee,
Who on Saint Thomas’ Day
Kept Saint Thomas away
And laughed at Ellis’ key.”*
It appeared Rossi had barred the door and the pre-
centor’s key would not operate. Dr. Ellis was the precentor.
Eventually Rossi was dispossessed by force, and photo-
graphs are still extant of him lying in the gutter as proof
of the “assault.” An account by David McNicoll adds
the details which captured the popular imagination, such
as feeding Rossi with soup in a tube through the keyhole
and the squeezing of bread under the main door of the
Cathedral, t
The mason who removed the tablet for the Bishop in
1887 was William David Orchard. He gave evidence in
one of the Rossi suits. He was still living in Ooulburn in
1940.
In the course of the second reading debate on the Valida-
tion Bill, the Hon. W. H. Piggott said:
“....for some years past there have been serious disturbances
going on in the Cathedral Church of Goulburn. We have
heard of doors being barred, of people sleeping in the church
and cooking their food there. We have heard of very serious
trouble with the officials of the Church, with the Bishop, with
the Dean, and with others.... ”
“All these happenings too resulted in unedifying litigation, until
opportunity was taken in Parliament to amend the Validation
Act by securing the continuance of the application to St. Sav-
iour’s Cathedral of the clause in the Act 8, William IV, No. 5
providing for “any person....to have, maintain and keep, with
the permission of the bishop for the time being, such monument
to and for the sole use of himself and his heirs for ever.”
* “E.P.P.,” 6/1/1887. t Melbourne “Argus,” 11/4/1931.


In the litigation Rossi was accused of entering the
Cathedral with his servants and others on January 13, 1891,
and of refusing to leave the Cathedral at the conclusion of
divine service, of remaining continuously in possession of it,
of keeping the gas burning continuously, of introducing food
and drink and a night-stool into the building, of consuming
food and drink and using the night-stool, of smoking and
throwing matches and cigar-ends on the floor, of excluding
the organist and choir, of interfering with and obstructing
divine service, of assaulting persons lawfully endeavouring
to enter the Cathedral, and of using filthy and obscene
language in the sacred building, all of which caused large
crowds to congregate, constituting a danger to the peace.*
Rossi, in his defence, denied the language and the night-
stool, and made much of the unnecessary violence with which
Joseph Smithers Hayes and others, acting for the Bishop,
removed him from the Cathedral when he first took posses-
sion of it in 1887. It is not always clear either in the
statement of claim, or in the defence, whether the invasion
of the Cathedral of 1887 or 1891 is being referred to. The
circumstances of both were very similar even to the question
of the night commode. There were two equity suits, Church
of England Property Trust v Rossi. In the first the Trust
sought a declaration that Rossi was not a trustee and had
no right to deal with any of the Cathedral lands, St. Sav-
iour’s glebe or cemetery, etc. The case was dismissed.
In the second Rossi was called upon to account for and
pay into court certain moneys. Lastly, in 1893, an appeal
to the Full Court was begun, but this was struck out when
the appellants (the Trust) announced that a final settlement
had been arrived at. On November 8, 1893, the Court
appointed the Bishop of Goulburn a Body Corporate, and
his successors trustee of all the church lands the subject of
this action, which decree was registered in the office of the
Registrar-General for Deeds on January 1, 1894.
On May 30, 1900, the Comte de Rossi attempted to
re-open all these questions by an application to vary a
* The Bishop wrote to the Chancellor, January 12, 1887: “ Rossi
has descrated, profaned and polluted the building—by taking a night
commode into one of the vestries or porches—and causing great
annoyance by such filthy conduct, and when that article was removed
he did not hesitate (I heard yesterday) to pollute the floor of the
Cathedral. ”


certificate by the Master in Equity. The application failed
and was dismissed with costs.
Other Actions.
Another suit in equity was that of the Church of Eng-
land Property Trust v Rossi in the matter of the West
Goulburn glebe resumption. Rossi obtained possession of
certain compensation moneys and retained them from 1883
to 1893. Eventually he paid the sum of £1229/5/9 into
Court. It cost the Trust £429/17/1 to get it.
In 1898-9 a further Supreme Court action, Bishop of
Goulburn v Rossi, was necessary in order to secure from
Rossi a final settlement of various matters connected with
the St. Saviour's and the West Goulburn glebes. The
correspondence which preceded and even accompanied this
suit was most eccentric.
Yet another action was brought by Captain and Mrs.
Rossi (the second wife) this time against Bishop Chalmers
in 1896. On January 5, 1896, Bishop Chalmers refused to
administer the Holy Communion to Captain Rossi and his
wife, on the grounds that the Captain's first wife was still
living. Rossi served the Bishop with a Supreme Court
writ on February 27, 1896, claiming £1000 damages. Later
he joined the Rev. T. E. Owens-Mell. In the meantime the
Bishop stood firm on the Instructions to the Clergy of the
Province of New South Wales concerning the Re-Marriage
of Divorced Persons. Rossi consulted the Bishop of Sydney
(Dr. Saumarez Smith) who wrote:
“I regret to say that the circumstances into which you have
placed yourself by your (recent) marriage, which cannot be
considered ecclesiastically a proper one, make it the duty of the
clergymen of the Church of England who are cognizant of the
circumstances to refuse to administer the Holy Communion to
one whom they cannot regard as married according to the law
of Christ.”
It is said that the English Church Union cabled to
Bishop Chalmers offering to guarantee his costs. It seems
quite likely, although there is now no evidence in the Dio-
cesan Registry for it.
Even this action had its lighter side. Rossi and his
wife intimated to Bishop Chalmers, who had never met them,
that they would present themselves for communion. Bishop
Chalmers instructed William Toombs, the verger, to stand


at the altar rail and indicate the Rossis to him when they
arrived. Toombs did so, and the Bishop passed them by,
and Rossi protested. Toombs had acted his part with con-
siderable reluctance, as he was very fond of Rossi. He
wanted to let oft steam and looked around for an opportun-
ity. He found it in a well-known journalist on the staff
of the “Goulburn Herald, ” who was improving the shining
hour by scribbling furiously in his notebook. Toombs took
him by the collar and the back of his trousers and ran him
out of church, bestowing a final kick as they reached the
porch. On March 16 a notice of discontinuance of the
action was received.
The Cathedral Schism.
Perhaps one of the strangest happenings during these
troublous years was what is known as the “Cathedral
schism. ” On Sunday, August 28, 1884, the Rev. A. T.
Puddicombe began “parochial services’’ in the church hall
(the former pro-cathedral) inviting “those who do not at-
tend the Cathedral to attend services in St. Saviour’s new
school-room.” This schism continued until January 11,
1891. Another factor in the dispute was the character of
the Cathedral services, and it is clear that not a little of the
Cathedral dispute found its origin in the objection of cer-
tain parishioners to the substitution of “Cathedral” for
“parochial” services. The columns of the “Penny Post”
and the “Coulburn Herald” in 1884 were full of references
to “the operatic anthem,” “ornate canticles,” “elaborate
responses,” and the “puerilities” of “turning to the east”
and “surpliced choirs.”
The Last Stage.
On the appointment of Bishop Barlow, Rossi and his
second wife made strenuous attempts to re-open all the old
trouble. From 1902 until his death he bombarded the
Bishop with claims of one sort and another in connection
with the Cathedral, West Goulburn, and the Bishop’s use
of Old Bishopthorpe. He began an action to recover
Bishopthorpe for his own use, claiming that the original
gift to the first Bishop of Goulburn and his successor was
invalid in that the Bishop was not a corporation sole. Some-
what foolishly, Bishop Barlow offered Rossi £2OO to alter


the conditions of the deed of conveyance. This Rossi re-
fused. Upon his death Florence Jane, Comtesse de Rossi,
opened up on her own account. She claimed, that the
Church had persecuted Rossi, that the gift of Bishopthorpe
to the Church gave Bishop Thomas a life interest only in
it, that the Bishop of Goulburn was not a corporation sole,
that no church moneys had been expended on the building
of Bishopthorpe, that the conditions in the deed of gift
had not been complied with, etc., etc. One of her chief
grounds was that the original conveyance from F. R. L.
Rossi contained a clause that Bishopthorpe should not be
sold, leased or sub-let during the lifetime of the donor or
after his death without the consent of his widow. The
occasion was the use of Bishopthorpe for the purpose of a
girls’ school. Bishop Barlow, who leased the house to the
school, was protected by the written permission of Jane
Hannah Rossi, the Comte’s first wife and, of course, the
wife actually named in the original deed. The Comtesse
brought an action for ejectment in the Supreme Court in
1910, but did not proceed with it, and judgment was signed
against her. The costs, as usual, fell on the diocese and
amounted to £3lB.
It is hard to arrive now at the total expenditure on
costs in all these actions. Not all the accounts appear to
have been published. The main Rossi suits alone absorbed
over £2089. The costs of the glebe equity suit (met by the
St. Saviour’s Parochial Defence Committee) amounted to
£llOO. What the Church lost in actual money cannot be
much short of £SOOO. Rossi claimed to have expended over
£2OOO. What it lost in prestige, time is healing or has
healed. Nearly two generations have passed; these things
are remembered, but no longer in bitterness, remembered
only as a discreditable chapter in our history. Yet that
discredit had its silver lining. One wonders whether nowa-
days five hundred people could be assembled in one day to
protest against any church order and, if they did, if two
hundred others could be assembled a day or two later to
voice the other side. Even the titanic quarrels of those
days were evidence of a passionate, if misdirected, loyalty.
Bibliography and Sources.
In 1892, when the “Goulburn Cathedral War” was
ended, the “Sydney Morning Herald” remarked that the


difficulty of understanding the question was not because of
“any lack of materials for study, or from any secrecy in
which any of the contestants shrouded any portion of any
of the proceedings.” A vast amount of literature was
published. Every available newspaper was given over to
correspondence, and for ten years a battle of pamphlets and
newspaper correspondence raged, at times intimately bear-
ing upon actions before the courts, and at times only re-
motely related thereto.
The most important of these publications are listed in
the author’s longer articles on this subject, together with
the solicitors and counsel engaged upon the major actions.
It should not be forgotten, though, that these major actions
referred to here are only a fraction of the litigation in-
dulged in. There were police court prosecutions, libel ac-
tions and cross suits for all sorts of purposes.
The “Evening Post” seemed almost disappointed when
signs of a reconciliation between the warring Anglican fac-
tions became manifest. It published a lament of five
verses, e.g.:
“Gone are the good old days,
When one staunch veteran militant
Defied ecclesiastical cant,
And through the keyhole parley kept
With friend and foe, while most men slept,
Holding the key, the citadel
As if against the hosts of hell —
Gone are the good old days.”*

CHAPTER XV.
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.
OULBURN’S history as a garrison post, pastoral
settlement, industrial city and distributing centre
could be told from its occupations and industries.
The various church registers in Goulburn contain references
to “the 4th Regiment quartered at Goulburn/ ’ “the 50th
Regiment/ ’ “the Stockade,” “the 31st Regiment,” “the
51st Regiment,” and to such occupations as “Watchman,”
“Yeoman,” “Lock-up keeper,” “Soldier,” “Trooper in
Mounted Police,” “Charcoal burner,” “Weaver,” “Mal-
ster,” “Sawyer,” “Black-lead pencil manufacturer,” “Gold
Commissioner,” etc., etc.
Charles MacAlister gives as one of the reasons for the
increasing respectability of Goulburn in 1839:
“The starting of a crockery shop by a Mr. Brownlow, whose
ware, though the cups were as big as a small pumpkin and the
dishes deep enough to have a bath in, added a more civilized
element to the tin kitchen gods of the householders.”
These primitive conditions were due to the cost of carry-
ing which in the thirties and forties amounted to £5 per ton
between Goulburn and Sydney. In the “roaring fifties” it
soared to £75/100 per ton.
MacAlister went on to say:
“Goulburn owed much in the formative years to the commer-
cial genius of the Hebrew race. In fact, the term “as solid as
a Goulburn Jew” almost threatened at one time to pass into a
proverb.”*
Correcting MacAlister’s list those early Jews included:
Benjamin and Moses, pioneer storekeepers, at first in the old
Township and later of the Argyle stores, Sam Davis, store-
keeper, Solomon Moses innkeeper 1836, Joe Collins cheap jack,
“Old Jacob” storekeeper, Silkman a barber, Solomon Cohen store-
keeper, S. (Samuel) Emanuel and Son (Solomon), David
Davis storekeeper, “Jack the Jew” ginger beer maker, Moss
Marks of the New Argyle store (who ended his life by “gashing
his stomach with a razor.”!
When the Governor Sir Chas. Fitzroy visited Goulburn
in 1850 the public reception was held on the Saturday after-
noon. Alderman Emanuel on behalf of the Hebrew com-
munity asked that the Jews might be excused as Saturday
was their Sabbath. The Governor graciously excused them.J

As late as 1871 the “Wandering Reporter” of the “Sydney
Morning Herald” wrote:
“the ten tribes have not been lost, only mislaid into Goulburn.”t
Goulburn’s Primary industries have been important
from its earliest days. Its well-grassed plains and open
forest country permanently watered by the Wollondilly
River, the Mulwaree Ponds, and the Kingsdale, Gundary and
Run-of-water creeks, its good climate and assured rainfall,
caused it to be dotted with huge cattle runs. At the time
Cunningham saw the country most of the plains and open
forest country had been alienated. Cattle comprised the
main industry. Small areas were cultivated. Sheep were
introduced in the late twenties and shepherded in small flocks
on the open plains where they thrived well. As the numbers
increased diseases caused heavy mortality and this mortality
increased when the sheep were confined to paddocks. Ex-
cept for small areas the Goulburn district was not considered
healthy sheep country until the nineties. Here is a descrip-
tion of a sheep-farm in the Goulburn district in 1835:
“The way sheep are managed here is this: A man has from 300
to 1000, according to the forest or open ground of the run; he
takes them out in the morning, feeds them all day, and brings
them back at night to the fold, which is moveable, and shifted
every night to give them dry bedding. A man watches all
night; they are counted night and morning. Notwithstanding
all this care the native dogs sometimes break in and kill several
of them in a night.”f
David Waugh writing to his sister Eliza on the
10/2/1835 speaks of Bradley living in “a fine house” and
running about 8/10,000 sheep. In the early days the losses
were often greater than the natural increase.
During 1838, 1839 and 1840 there was a severe drought
favouring sheep rather than cattle. There were good sea-
sons in the forties. Wheat growing in the County of
Cumberland had failed, largely through rust, and with
closer settlement it was begun in Goulburn. Large quan-
tities of cereals were grown and the Goulburn district was
described as “the granary of the State.” Farming boomed
and in the drought years Goulburn flour brought £IOO a
ton. Poppies were cultivated extensively in Goulburn in
the early forties for the opium seeds, as was tobacco, more
especially on the Veteran Flats at Tirranna. In the fifties

farm products brought high prices again, due this time to
the gold discoveries. Sheep shearing at “W. J. W. Chis-
holm’s station near Goulburn” was illustrated and described
in 1854. A wool waggon with six bullocks, two men and
a dog at Razor Back on the Goulburn road appeared a little
later. A picture of drays encamping by moonlight near
the ford on the Bargo River on the Goulburn road was
another subject depicted.*
Inveralochy Estate, during the ownership of Craig,
between 1848/50 employed the first mechanical reaper and
thresher in the County of Argyle. It was a crude affair,
drawn by eight bullocks, taking a side-pull like a canal
barge. Its appearance was that of a small paddle steamer.
In 1849 another local farmer used the machine, harvesting
30 bushels to the acre. A threshing machine driven by a
portable steam engine was imported by Captain Rossi in
1858. f
In the early sixties there were more people on the land
within 20 miles of Goulburn than there are to-day. In the
seventies and eighties the average size of holdings was
smaller than ever before or since. The depression of the
nineties and the Bank smashes caused a stampede from the
small areas. The extension of the railway to the South
and the West and the opening up of better wheatlands as-
sisted. Once more the Goulburn district became one of
large sheep stations. In the 1902 drought it did not suffer
to the same extent as the rest of the State and with the high
prices for wool in the following years its dependence upon
sheep was confirmed. At the beginning of the present
century the rabbit pest brought about the failure of many
landholders working on a narrow margin, and the necessity
for large capital expenditure on wire-netting and har-
bour destruction brought about a subdivision of some of the
largest holdings. More recently attention has been paid
to pasture improvement but only so far in a small way.
Several efforts have been made to revive wheat-growing here.
In 1928 Ben Diehm and Reg Brown harvested between 27 and
30 bushels of wheat per acre from 800 acres at Komungla.j:
As for the future almost every crop that can be grown in

temperate climates can be grown successfully round Goul-
burn and even sub-tropical plants such as tobacco, sweet
potatoes, peanuts and rice have been grown. Wheat, oats,
maize and potatoes have all flourished. The history of
land settlement around Goulburn is tragic. In the earliest
days the areas were all too large. Then when closer settle-
ment came they were all too small. Now the holdings are
too large again. The small settlers who started in this
district were a wonderfully good type.
With certain exceptions the story of Goulburn’s
secondary industries is a sad one. The list of such as have
disappeared is an appalling one. It includes breweries,
boiling-down works, tanneries, boot factories, flour mills,
meat preserving works, soap factories, clothing manufact-
urers, condiments, cake and biscuit factories, foundries,
engineering works and the building of railway rolling stock.
Many factors have contributed to this debacle. For some
of these industries the need passed. Others were not
economic. The disappearance of others was attributed to
the “differential” or “preferential” railway rates. In a
pamphlet published in Goulburn some years ago there was
an arresting paragraph dealing with country secondary
industries. It said:
“The time is approaching when the only country inhabitants
will be civil servants and primary producers most country
districts are losing population.”*
The number of persons employed in factories on the
Southern Tablelands in 1922/3 was 1269. The number rose
steadily to 1608 in 1926/7, declined rapidly to 816 in 1933/4
and has since risen gradually to 1242 in 1937/8. The actual
number of persons engaged in secondary industries in Goul-
burn itself in 1917/18 was 677, in 1927/8, 752, and in 1937/8,
635. During the same years 1922 to 1928 the number of
factory operatives for the whole State rose by 75,617, of
which the County of Cumberland contributed no less than
65,627.f The period of Goulburn’s greatest industrial and
commercial expansion was in the late seventies and the
eighties. There are constant references in the metropolitan
press of that period to business ventures in Goulburn. $ The
Goulburn of the eighties looked forward to a future which
then seemed possible but which now has receded from the

practical. When Dr. Gallagher retired from the presidency
of St. Patrick’s College in 1887 he spoke in optimistic vein
of the future of the city. He looked forward to:
“rich fields of waving grain girdling the confines of the city...
when will be heard anear the hum of hundreds of busy factories
shaping the arts of commerce; when tramcars after a new plan
will carry visitors to majestic warehouses and beautiful villas.”*
In the following list of businesses and occupations no
attempt has been made to compile complete and exhaustive
records. Names and firms have been selected either because
they were pioneers or because of the influence they have
had on the history and progress of the city.
Robert Hatch was probably Goulburn’s first auctioneer.
He is described as “a baker and auctioneer” in 1839. Dig-
nam sold 646 two to three year old sheep at 6/- a head in
1846 and 1152 at 5/-. He once distrained on a corpse and
obstructed its burial till his account was paid. Fulljames
was an auctioneer in the fifties. A. G. Finlay started as
an auctioneer in 1859. On the 29/10/1882 Finlay & Coy.
with Richardson and Wrench sold 14,000 acres at Gundarv
* «.*
divided into 237 farms. The idea was to grow wheat “the
manufacturers of flour (in Goulburn) having frequently to
purchase Foreign grain.” In 1884 they were disposing of
£15,000 worth of freehold land, mainly town allotments, in
a series of lotteries on the Art Union principle at a pound
a ticket. S. (Solomon) Emanuel and Coy. were estab-
lished in 1876. They secured a verdict against A. G. Finlay
and J. J. Hayes for £IO,OOO and £4OO interest over the
Gundary sale. Other well known auctioneers were Andrews
and Chisholm, Wm. Sands and Coy., Sands and Belcher,
Zouch and McAlister, S. B. Henderson and J. J. Roberts.
The record sale of sheep in Goulburn was during the 1914/18
war when 65,000 were yarded and sold. In 1939 W. H.
Wheatley sold 40,000 sheep, of which 35,560 were railed,
utilising 305 trucks and yielding railway receipts of
£2006/10/4.f
Of bakers, Robert Hatch was here in 1839. Clarke
had a bakehouse in Sloane Street in the fifties. Kingsell
was advertising “Hot Cross buns” in 1854. George Olliver,
Jos. White, and Jas. Green were here in the fifties also.

In the sixties, seventies and eighties, Mrs. Kestle, T. Byrne
and A. H. Line were operating. The bakehouse in Bradley
Street occupied by the exors. of W. R. Costley incorporates
the first Primitive Methodist Church. There was a bread
war in 1890 which the millers squashed. When in 1891 the
bakers advertised that in consequence of the depression they
would not be giving Christmas cakes to their customers the
“Penny Post” replied in verse concluding rudely ”No one
asked them for their cake.” #
The first Australian Baking Powder was manufactured
by Dr. Robert Waugh at the Medical Hall in Market Street.
Years afterwards, in 1871, A. M. Hunt erected, according
to a contemporary account, "Expensive mills for the pur-
pose of grinding and amalgamating the various ingredients,”
(of Baking Powder).
William Thomas Jackson was probably Goulburn’s first
barber. He died on the 17/6/1843. Silkman, a Jew, was
another barber in the early forties. He it was who
“trimmed the long beards of the bushmen in artistic style. He
seldom troubled our hair, however, as that was worn as long as
it would grow, adding much to the ‘Texan Jack’ appearance of
the bush dandies of that time.”
Silkman was afterwards a draper. Much later "Pro-
fessor” Young advertised:
“Gentlemen’s perukes made to order. Hair guards and mourn-
ing rings made to order.”!
"Penny-farthing” bicycles were advertised and illus-
trated by Wm. Davies and Coy. in the eighties. F. A.
Drury had a bicycle shop in Montague Street in 1895. J.
Bickley advertised as "The City Bill Poster” in 1882, as
a side line "Chair caning in all its branches.” When he
died Mrs. Bickley carried on the business. $
Jonathan Dawson, of Goulburn is described as a
"Blacklead pencil manufacturer.” He was 23 years of age
when he died on the 23/2/1850. §
The first smithy stood a few hundred yards away from
Matt. Healy’s public house in the old Township and was a
going concern, in 1833. Other well-known blacksmiths were

Dawson, Stewart, (both in Sloane Street), Joshua King
(landlord of the “Farriers ’ Arms’’), Noonan, Thompson,
Miller and H. B. Monkley. Noonan was near the Hibernian
Hotel and Miller on the Bank of Australasia corner. #
Samuel Green “Lodging House Keeper,” of Auburn
Street, probably conducted the first boarding house, f The
“Goulburn Book and Stationery Mart” was a side-line of
the Goulburn Herald” and was established in 1848.
The first boiling down works in Goulburn were those of
MacKellar and White, established at Eastgrove in 1844.
They are said to have boiled down 1000 sheep and 50/60
bullocks per day.
Bootmaking has been one of Goulburn’s important
secondary industries for nearly 90 years. Denis Gillespie
started in 1844. He was succeeded by Charles in 1851.
The factory at the corner of Goldsmith and Auburn Streets
was built in 1878 when the number of employees was 120.
On the 17/2/1885 it gave 500 pairs of blucher boots to the
N.S.W. Sudan contingent. In 1907 the business was sold
to F. Walpole and Son but continued under the old name.
The factory was burnt down on the 22/5/1915. A new
company was formed, Gillespie and Coy. Ltd., which built
a new factory on the corner of Auburn and Bradley Streets,
a new tannery and began a model village “Buffalo City.”
The company got into difficulties in 1926, ceased operations,
was wound up and Goulburn lost another secondary in-
dustry. The Municipal Council wrote off £llOB/6/1 for
light and power. $
Wm. Teece and Coy. began in 1850 with a small shop
in Clinton Street, a tannery on the Glebe and a factory in
Auburn Street. He was bought out by Hy. Baxter about
1885 who founded the business which is still Baxter and Coy.,
Ltd. and still Goulburn’s most important manufacturing in-
dustry. Wood and Coy. (1857) were boot and shoe manu-
facturers, tanners and curriers. Modestly enough in their
retail branch the “Ladies’ Department” had “a separate
entrance.” David Clifford had the “Red Boot Warehouse.”
This was a business founded by Wm. Teece. When Baxter

acquired the manufacturing end, Clifford took over the re-
tail. Thomas Stoney was described as a “Cordwaner” in
the fifties. There was a short-lived strike at Baxter’s
factory in 1892. #
Wm. Keeley built the first brickworks near the Fitzroy
bridge in 1837. The “Melbourne Place Brickworks” were
established by Thomas Stubbings in 1863 on the site of the
first courthouse. F. Lemm was the contractor for the gaol
in 1880. He established the “Fitzroy” brickworks near the
railway bridge at North Goulburn. In 1884 his manager
J. W. McGraw, bought the works. The bricks for the Re-
formatory, the Court House and the Hospital were made
here.
One of Goulburn’s first builders was James Sinclair who
is variously described as an architect, builder and contractor.
He emigrated from Scotland in the late thirties of last cen-
tury. He built the “St. Clair” cottage in Sloane Street
and also the first gaol. After his wife’s death about 1851
he left for the Ovens diggings and was waylaid and mur-
dered either on the way there or back. The family vault
is in the old Presbyterian cemetery. F. Horn was a builder
from 1859 to 1882. He built the Convent, St. Patrick’s
College, Old Bishopthorpe, Hurstville and the Post Office.
He was only 53 when he died on the 9/2/1882. Chas. Goode
started also in 1859. He built the Bourke Street Infants’
School, the District Hospital and Burner’s store (now the
corner block of Rogers). Another Goulburn contractor was
Thomas Wilkie, senr. He came to Australia in 1855 and
worked on the Hornsby Lighthouse. The grand staircase
at the Sydney University is his work. He arrived in Goul-
burn in 1862 and joined Horn and Murray. He erected the
police buildings and the Rev. W. Ross’ residence. One
of his sons built the Town Hall. The “Mr. Lord” who
built the third gaol in 1845 and other old buildings was
Thomas Lord of Surrey Hills, t
Goulburn’s first butcher was in all probability James
Kershaw, who is described as such in 1838. John O’Don-
nell, for many years and later Benjamin O’Donnell, con-
ducted a butcher’s shop in a building described in 1879 as

“40 years old.” The Goulburn “Herald” deplored “the
passing of this well-known landmark.” Chas. MacAlister
was a butcher for awhile. Other early butchers were
Simons and Slocombe. Later Geo. Adams (Tattersalls) had
a butcher’s shop here. Much later the Beeglings were well
known. Criticising the price of meat the “Penny Post”
said:
“ ’l’ve one regret/ said Pierpont then
‘Although I’m such a gold urn,
I’d have died a wealthier man if I
‘Had only sold meat in Goulburn.’ ”*
Eobt. Geelan speculated in turkeys in 1879. On one
occasion he bought 400 from neighbouring settlers and drove
them to the railway station where they were trucked in
horse-boxes and sent to Sydney. A second draft was bought
in the Braidwood District, conveyed in crates by drays to
within six miles of Goulburn, was then unpacked and driven
along the roads to the railway station. They were said to
arrive in better condition this way.f
There have been a number of Butter factories which
have disappeared. The Thornford Proprietary Butter
Factory was a Goulburn venture, launched in 1890. Four
members of Parliament were at its opening. The factory
was situated about 100 yards from St. Michael’s Church,
Kirkdale. The Spring Valley Butter Factory Co., Ltd. was
another. It was liquidated in 19044
The Argyle Co-operative Dairy Coy. Ltd., was formed
in 1901 and built extensive premises on the Glebe. It went
into liquidation in 1930. The premises are now occupied
by the Taralga Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd. One of
the earliest cafes or refreshment rooms was that of Thomas
Collins, next door to the Commercial Bank. He opened in
1880. Michael Doyle opened a “Cedar yard” in 1849.§ In
the early days every doctor was his own dispenser and
chemists’ shops hardly existed. When and where they did
they were controlled or financed by the doctors. Joseph
Nehemiah Webster was described as a “druggist” in 1858,
but whether he was in business on his own account is not

clear.§ One of the earliest chemist’s shops was that of A. A.
Kerr, who advertised that he was:
“the direct successor to the business of the late Dr. Waugh
and Dr. Perry.”
He called his premises “Apothecaries’ Hall.” He
claimed that his was “the oldest drug business in the
Southern Districts.” That claim would appear to be con-
tested by D.S. or W. Miles. W. Miles advertised in 1871
“late of the Medical Hall” and that he was manufacturing
“Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder.” The obituary notice of
D. S. Miles states that he was for many years assistant to Dr.
Waugh and that he started in business in the premises after-
wards occupied by Kerr. Perry and Bull, chemists and
druggists, of Belmore Square, advertised in 1871 that in
future they would be known as “wholesale druggists.” If
they were retailers before then they did not advertise.
Henry Hollis, one time superintendent of the Goulburn Hos-
pital, advertised in 1880 that he had “Purchased the above
“old-established business from Drs. Gentle and Morton.”
The ‘ ‘ above ’ ’ business was the ‘ ‘ Goulburn Dispensary. ’ ’ His
premises were in Auburn Street, just about where his grand-
son (P. R. D. Hollis) is to-day. Three generations have
been chemists in Goulburn. John Fergusson was the first
Goulburn candidate to obtain his M.P.S. He was for some
years assistant to Kerr, then to Dr. Johnson of Penrith, then
to Drs. Gentle and Morton of Goulburn. “He took charge
of the Gunning branch of these gentlemen.” He bought
the stock and removed to Bulli as a partner to Dr. Gould.
He returned to Goulburn in 1882 and set up in business as
a “chemist, analyst and assayer.” 0. Bergmark was in
business as a chemist before he was an optician. “Terebene
smelling salts for clergymen” was a quaint advertisement
in 1888.*
L. Weissberger was manufacturing cigars in L. Mandel-
son’s “City Clothing Hall,” Auburn Street, in 1876. He
advertised “20,000 cigars, 8 months old, on hand.” His
dying intestate gave rise to the legend of the “Weissberger
millions. ” As a matter of fact he left £SOOO exactly, which
is still held by the N.S.W. Treasury for the Public Trustee.
Somehow the rumour grew that Weissberger left “millions,”

Thousands of claimants have arisen from every corner of the
world, more particularly of course, Czecho-Slovakia, for the
Goulburn cigar-manufacturer was a Bohemian. In the ab-
sence of proper records in Czecho-Slovakia it seems unlikely
that proof of relationship will ever be established A
Years ago coach and waggon building was as important
as the motor industry is now. Goulburn coaches and wag-
gons found their way all over New South Wales and Vic-
toria. Lake and Stewart, and Stewart’s waggon factory
were established by Wm. Stewart about 1848. In 1888 his
team drays were listed at £l6/18, tip drays at £lO/16,
and waggons at £45/75. The works were in Clinton Street.
Southall’s Coach factory flourished in the sixties. At first
it stood on the site of the present Bank of Australasia.
Later it was where is now the Coastal Farmers’ establish-
ment. In 1899 Wm. Southall constructed a plant at Tow-
rang for the "carbonisation and distillation of forest timber
for the purpose of producing pyroligneous and acetic acids,
naptha, wood spirit and tar.” It was his intention to
produce 80 tons of crudes per week. Chas. Cole was a
coachbuilder who came out to Australia in the early fifties
and settled in Goulburn. He died here, on the 30/5/1907,
at the age of 85. Christopher Walker settled in Goulburn
in 1867. He claimed to be the leading waggon maker in
the district. J. E. Toohey started business as a coach-
builder in 1881. He built new premises in 1885 at which
he employed 20 hands. That year Wright Bros, and Slatyer
started. There was a lockout in the coachbuilding trade
in Goulburn in 1880. f
The first mention of a confectioner was when James
Williams died on the 30/9/1843. Thos. Jacobs was licensed
as a confectioner in 1849. Jas. Donoghue was a contractor.
He laid 22 miles of Goulburn’s water mains. John Webb
was a cooper at Bradley’s Brewery up to 1846. Rosendhal
and Soley were coopers in 18954 There have been two co-
operative stores in Goulburn. Both failed.
Tommy Jacobs and "Jack the Jew” were cordial
makers in the forties. Jas. Nowlan had a cordial factory

in Montague Street in 1864 and in Clifford Street in 1876.
The firm of C. Sheekey was established about 1868.*
Mrs. John Chapman was a dressmaker and Sarah Hop-
kins a milliner and dressmaker in the fifties. There were
fellmongers in Goulburn from an early date. Chatfield had
a woolwashing establishment at Ifield which eventually be-
came Wm. Gale’s. Wm. Gale is mentioned as a fellmonger
in 1846. He was succeeded by his son Thomas, whose place
of business was in Grafton Street. There are several refer-
ences to his polluting the river in the Municipal minutes in
the eighties. His premises are illustrated in a bird’s eye
view of Goulburn published in 1897. Thorn, another fell-
monger, was also pilloried for polluting the river. Edward
Herbert Dunn and Jas. Fitzpatrick were fellmongers in 1852
and 1854 respectively. The Towrang fellmongery was in
being from an early date. From about 1895 to 1904 W. H.
Wheatley had it and said that he paid in wages £3/4000 per
annum. He claimed that he closed it rather than “submit
to the unions and arbitration court.” His contention was
disputed in subsequent correspondence.!
There is only one flour mill in Goulburn to-day. Years
ago there were many and every township and hamlet in the
district had its mill too. Many causes have contributed to
their demise, not the least the fact that this is no longer a
wheat growing district. A Wm. Mitchell is said to have
had a flour mill of sorts in Goulburn about 1830, but con-
firmation of this is lacking. A milkman of that name is
listed in 1828 as living at Molonglo River, Goulburn Plains.
Mrs. Jane Steer, who came to Goulburn in 1836, says
her first husband, Duncan Mackellar, erected the first mill
in Goulburn and
“received a great amount of support from people all around
who brought their wheat to be ground, although it was only
worked by horse power. This mill continued its operations with
great success for about two years and a half, until Bradley’s
mill was ready for work, when our smaller one was placed on
the market and sold.”!
William Bradley’s mill was a large three-storied build-
ing adjoining the brewery and with the latter built in 1836.

George Ballard was the miller in 1845. Wm. Sandercock
in the fifties, later N. C. Phillips managed it, together with
all other interests in Goulburn of the Bradleys. On the
death of Bradley, Emanuel purchased it. S. Emanuel and
Coy. called their enterprise the “City Steam Flour Mills.' 9
In 1867 Emanuels sold out to J. and J. Hayes. The ad-
vertisement of both parties to the deal appear, that of J.
and J. Hayes stating that they “will remove from their
present mills and work the City mills." Hayes had pre-
viously built and worked the large mill at the south end of
Auburn Street from 1869. W. S. Kimpton and Sons had
this mill in the nineties. In 1895 their establishment was
referred to as a “gigantic pile." The Argyle Mills were
at the corner of Clinton and Sloane Streets and were estab-
lished in 1849 by James Sinclair. The site is now occupied
by BladwelFs wool store. They were described in the local
press in 1849 as :
“In full operation turning our golden grain into flour. The
proprietor, Mr. Sinclair, is to be highly commended for his
enterprise. In a few years' time we hope that the locomotive
train will drag quantities of flour to Sydney."*
It was a three-storied building.

nal,” 22/4/1899.


Byrnes and Oakes had the Argyle Steam Mill in Goul-
burn in 1853. A receipted account to F. T. Moore of Baw
Baw shows 200 lbs of flour:
2 18 0
Bag 2 0
£3 0 0*
Cox and WorralFs mill was another three-storey build-
ing still standing in Clinton Street. Douglas of Invera-
lochy had it next. An attempt was made to float it as a
limited company in 1887. The name of the company was
the “Excelsior Roller Flour Mills, Ltd.” The capital was
to have been £50,000 of which £15,000 was to be issued. It
was intended to acquire Cox’s mill for £SOOO. Ashley,
Stephens and Coy., took over the Excelsior Mill in 1911.f
In 1852 the price of flour in Goulburn rose from £2l
to £29 whilst wheat was selling at 10/- a bushel. The two
flour mills refused to grind wheat for the storekeepers. A
meeting was held under the chairmanship of Moss Marks to
break the combine. A steam mill was found to be imposs-
ible. Marks offered the machinery and tenders were called
for the erection of a tower windmill capable of driving three
grinding stones. There is no record of its erection. Flour
milled at Bradley’s mill in 1854 realised “first £35 per ton,
second £34, third £33, Bran 3/- per bushel.” Byrnes and
Oakes’ quotes were the same.t The only flour mill in Goul-
burn to-day is that of Wm. Conolly, Ltd. This business
was founded by the late Wm. Conolly who arrived in Goul-
burn from England in 1853. A graduate of Trinity College,
Dublin, he had no intention of undertaking flour milling
when he arrived here. At the instance of Mr. Oakes of
Bathurst he bought the Argyle Mills in Clinton Street. The
present proprietary company was formed in 1903. In 1908
Conolly moved his establishment to the site of the old muni-
cipal baths in Sloane Street. The present mills occupy the
site of the old baths and part of the old Presbyterian Church
properties and are one of the largest and most modernly
equipped units on the southern line. Silos for bulk handling
of wheat have been built and the latest machinery for the

manufacture of flour installed. The mill is driven by electric-
ity from the municipal power station. Four generations of
the Conolly family have been engaged in the business.* Sal-
mon Brothers of Auburn Street were the first to advertise
as a motor garage. This was in 1911. They prepared
pupils for the “police certificate.”!
A quaint trade was conducted by a man named Bell
and by his son after him. In the fifties he had a shop in
Auburn Street in the block between Clifford and Goldsmith
Streets. He was a maker of cabbage-tree hats. Inter-
viewed by the “Penny Post,” at 84, Henry Bannister of
Bateman’s Bay, recalled that his step-father, Thomas Bell,
was a well-known maker of cabbage-tree hats. One of these
hats which Bannister and his sister helped to plait, sold
many years afterwards, for seven guineas, at a Goulburn
bazaar. D. Davis at the old Commercial Stores advertised
“Cabbage-tree-hats” in 18494
There were several jam manufacturers in Goulburn in
the seventies and eighties. A. M. Hunt and Coy. were em-
ploying eight hands on jam-making alone. The capacity
of their plant was three tons per week. Other trades
sprang up around this, as e.g., the manufacture of tins and
labels (which were supplied by the “Herald, ”)§
Goulburn has had a number of foundries and engineer-
ing works, some of them large establishments; only one
foundry and one engineering shop survive to-day. One of
the earliest foundries was that established by Burn and Son
in 1866. In 1881 they sold out to R. T. Ball and Coy. In
1883 the firm became Macfadyen, Ball and Bryant; in 1884
Ball, Incer and Coy. In 1885, Ball and Incer dissolved
partnership. Incer joined Crossley to buy out another
foundry—H. D. Manning’s. They advertised peevishly “No
connection with Ball, Incer and Coy.” Ball, Incer and
Coy’s, works were on the Yass Road; Manning and Incer
and Crossley’s were in Clinton Street. Ball, Incer and Coy.
became Ball and Coy. again in 1885, with works first in
Cowper Street and then in Clinton Street. That year the
Goulburn Foundry and Engineering Coy., Ltd. was floated

with a capital of £lO,OOO. The first directors were Wm.
Davies, A. M. Betts, Francis Tait and Thomas Marsden. The
plant and foundry of Ball and Coy. in Cowper Street were
acquired and R. T. Ball was appointed manager. Whether
the Company ever functioned or not is uncertain for on the
10/3/1888, R. T. Ball and Coy. approached the Minister for
Works offering to build railway trucks in Goulburn. _ The
Minister set out on the 17/3/1888 to inspect the facilities at
Bathurst and Goulburn for building rolling stock. Assured
of such orders R. T. Ball and Coy. established large works
on St. Saviour’s Glebe in 1890. They built trucks and vans,
executed two large orders for rolling stock for the railways,
(some of which is still in use) and employed about 150/200
hands. In 1894 the mortgagees, A. G. Finlay, Wm. Gale
and A. M. Betts stepped in, obtained a verdict for £6394/4/6,
demolished and sold the buildings and destroyed the in-
dustry. Later the London Bank obtained a verdict against
Gale for £3842/4/4. Bishop Chalmers reporting the matter
to Synod asked “Cui Bono?” The Church lost £B5O in rent,
a valuable industry terminated, all because one guarantor
had acted on his own responsibility. After the liquidation
or bankruptcy the firm started again in the Clinton Street
premises as the Goulburn Engineering and Foundry Works
and manufactured boilers, weighbridges, railway castings,
etc. They were bought out by the Pioneer Pneumatic Cell
Tyre Coy. (E. Hibbert) who moved the works to Auburn
Street. That firm went out of existence about 1929 when
B. R. Nosworthy formerly manager for Ball’s opened on his
own account near 15 Clinton Street. This is now the only
foundry in Goulburn. Other early foundries not mentioned
in the foregoing were Matt Gibbons’ at the S.E. corner of
Addison and Faithfull Streets, W. Wardle in Cowper Street,
who also described himself as an “engineer and boiler-
maker,” John Byrne, an iron and brass-founder, Ayling
Brothers, later Hodkinson and Ayling, then Simpson and
Jones, and finally George Simpson. The only engineering
works surviving in Goulburn are those of E. Denny, estab-
lished about 1917 in Auburn Street, moving later to the
corner of Auburn and Clinton Streets and then about 1923
to lower Clinton Street.*

The prospectus of the i i Goulburn Fruit Preserving
and Export Company” appeared in 1891. The flotation
was mishandled and the venture apparently fizzled out. The
Goulburn Fruitgrowers' Union” was in being at this time.
The Penny Post” observed unkindly that “it holds plenty
of meetings and indulges in plenty of talk, but it is a rarity
for it to do anything practical.” The first shipment of
Goulburn fruit to England was in 1892 when 1000 cases of
Goulburn apples were sent together with a few cases of
plums. # Evans Taylor was a “Gunsmith and Engineer” for
many years. He arrived in the Colony in 1849 and came
to Goulburn shortly afterwards.!
The first jeweller was probably William Johnston, who
is described as a watchmaker and who died in Goulburn on
the 10/10/1845. Another was John Thompson who died
at the age of 69 on the 18/2/1855. H. S. Clarke was in
business as a jeweller from 1855 to 1877, when he removed
from Goulburn. W. H. Smith was a watchmaker in 18494
The earliest reference to laundries is when Rachael
Langford is described as a “Laundres” in 1854. A con-
temporary was Ellen Evans. §
The keeping of livery stables is another industry or
occupation which has disappeared. Amongst others, Thomas
Moran, Pooley and Moran, and Thomas Joseph Moran,
coach proprietors and mail contractors, had livery stables
in Clifford Street, employing 40 working horses. John
Kelly, the undertaker, supplied horses and carriages for
many years. ||
T. Cunningham plied for hire with an Irish jaunting
car in the eighties. Later he bought a large omnibus with
the word “Waverley” painted on its sides from the Woll-
ahra Bus Company and ran it between the station and the
city. One of the earliest cabbies in Goulburn was David
O’Connell, whose advertisement appeared in 1878. The
cabstand was in Auburn Street and the cabmen’s shelter
in Belmore Park adjoining. The paved portion of the open
space opposite the railway station where the cabs used to

stand can still be seen. The last horse cabs in Goulburn
were those of Paddy Confoy, O’Neill and Archibald Burde-
kin Wilson. Wilson drove the last hansom cab. He died
on the 14/2/1940 at the age of 72.*
A Goulbnrn invention was a potato-digging machine, in-
vented and patented by W. Nosworthy. This was illus-
trated in the “ Penny Post.”f
The Goulbnrn Meat Preserving Company held its first
general meeting on the 19/1/1870. Its directors were W.
Chisholm, W. Connolly, S. Emanuel, W. Riley, and T. Kirke
with R. Zouch as secretary. Another account gives A. S.
Gibson as chairman and H. Baldock as manager. Its works
were in Bradley’s Mill. The slaughter yards were half a
mile away. Five hundred sheep were “converted daily
into exportable food.” On the 12/1/1871 the company
gave a luncheon to 120 guests, including Maurice Alexander,
M.L.A., President of the Legislative Assembly and Mayor
Horn, the Hon. John Hay, Bishop Thomas and others. “All
enjoyed the feast of goods made at the G.M.P. works.”
In 1872 the company applied to the Municipal Council
for a reduction or remission of rates because it had not been
operating for six months. Chas. MacAlister tells how in
1872 he sold the Company 150 Bega bred cattle at £6 per
head. He adds “We (Geo. Adams was his partner) were
lucky in getting a deposit of £2OO on those cattle, going ‘to
the wall’ like several others, for the residue of our money.
The company’s failure was probably due to the fall in the
London market, together with bad tinning here. The Meat
Preserving Company’s failing was a bit of a ‘staggerer’ as
we thought it was, relatively, as permanently based as the
Blue Mountains. ” A. G. Finlay was one of the original pro-
moters.;): Another kindred venture was the Goulburn
Slaughtering and Meat Freezing Works. A meeting was
held on the 9/5/1881 to establish such in Goulburn. Two
thousand shares were taken up. T. Marsden was chairman
and S. Harbourne Belcher secretary. The prospectus was
published on the 7/6/1881; 4980 shares were then issued.
The project did not come to fruition. Another “Goulburn

Chilling and Refrigerating Works ” were planned in 1896
but again nothing came of the project.* Wilson and Flood
established the “Mulwaree Freezing Works’ ’ on the Glebe
in 1917. The works were on an extensive scale capable of
treating 30,000 pairs of rabbits weekly. The firm en-
countered financial difficulties and the business came to an
end. Years afterwards the buildings were demolished and
R. D. Gray and Sons’ wool store now stands upon the
site.
Many of the roofs in Goulburn still have the old hand-
made “sixpenny” nails, so called because they were re-
tailed at six for a penny. In some reminiscences published
at the time of the Goulburn centenary Jimmy McCormick
the “nailer” was referred to. “He used to make nails,
plenty of them, and had a ready market.” From the con-
text it would appear that this was in the fifties.!
The first nursery garden was that of Henry Pedley, who
came out to Australia in 1849. After unsuccessful gold-
digging, he settled in Goulburn. He had 13 acres on the
banks of the Wollondilly. Thomas Grunsell arrived in the
Colony in 1854 and in Goulburn in 1860. He started
gardening in “the old Mulwaree Garden,” then the pro-
perty of George Stewart.^
James Stewart was in business as an “Oilmaker” in
1892. Previous to that Morton Mowbray was an “Oil and
Colorman.”§ Alexander Fraser is described as a “painter
and glazier” of Goulburn in 1838, and must surely have been
the first of his calling here.||
The first pawn shop in Goulburn was that of Dignam,
whose enterprise was greeted in the press as follows:
“Oh my Prophetic Soul: mine Uncle.” Mr. Dignam will soon
hang out his ‘Three Golden Balls , and hopes to acknowledge all
Goulburn as ‘his nephews and nieces’ if they so desire.”**
Insley advertised “Daguerreotypes” claiming that he
had been very fortunate in “Catching features” and “ex-
pressions in sitters.” Fourteen days later he advertised
that he had “to take extra rooms at the Argyle Inn.”

Henry Dorner was a photographer for many years in Au-
burn Street. He was born in Bohemia in 1849 and began
business in Goulburn in 1883. R. Caspers started in 1878.
On his death the business was continued by his widow.
Other well-known photographers were Gregory and Cleave.*
Daniel Kennedy was Goulburn’s first plasterer. He
was born in Dublin in 1827 and came to Goulburn in 1842.
He was a member of the first municipal council. He was
at the Eureka Stockade but took no part in the riots. He
was wrecked in the “Ceres” when the passengers spent six
weeks on an island before being rescued. (The subject of
Mayne Reid’s book “Lost Lenore.”) He died in Goulburn
on the 29/11/1907. “ Clifftoria, ” 128 Clifford Street, was
built by Daniel Kennedy. Its striking colonnade and the
courtyard were made by Kennedy of his own cement, the
secret of which died with him. Its chief ingredient was
live oyster shell. The subterranean water-way which runs
behind the Goulburn Club in Market Street was also built
by him, using this same cement. Daniel Kennedy brought
the first iron bedsteads to Goulburn on his return from Sac-
ramento, U.S.A., an innovation which set the town laughing.
Up to then all bedsteads had been made of cedar, f
James Miller was one of the first plumbers. He was
succeeded by W. A. Kingsell who had previously been ap-
prenticed to Miller. He began business on his own account
in 1871. He advertised “tinware, wholesale and retail.
Plumber and galvanized iron worker, Auburn Street.” i
There were printers in Goulburn before newspapers.
Wm. Henry Douglass was described as a “compositor” in
1843, and Joseph Appleby as a “printer” in 1846.§ The
Goulburn “Herald” advertised “steam printing” for years.
Between the word “steam” and “printing” appeared a
block of a primitive looking locomotive.
The advertisements of produce merchants do not appear
in the local press until the seventies. James Clifford was
a produce merchant in Verner Street. He came to Aus-
tralia in 1855 and to Goulburn in 1872. He was an aider-
man for 12 years and mayor in 1881. His son James had

a similar business in Auburn Street. The firm of Thos.
Williams Ltd., was founded by Thomas Williams about 1878.
P. McShane started as a produce merchant about 1880. On
one occasion he submitted some verses to the "Penny Post,”
which it rejected, as follows:
“Now write us, Pat, some rhymes on spuds—
Sound, healthy, mealy, Gullen goods—
Fit to boil or roast or fry,
And feed a hungry family,
And we will give the screed insertion,
Without a whisper of aspersion.”
The following Goulburn prices at the turn of the cen-
tury will be found of interest:
“Flour £7 to £7/10/-; wheat 2/2 to 2/3; oats 2/3 to 2/6; maize
3/6; hay £2/10/- to £3, new £l/10/- to £l/15/-; barley 2/9 to
3/-; potatoes £3/10/-; chaff £3/10 to £3/15/-; bacon 3|d to 4d
per lb., hams 4d to 6d; butter 7d, factory 9d; eggs 6d per doz.;
fowls 1/6 to 3/9; cheese 4d. to 4M; honey 2id to 3d; bread 2d
to 2id per 21b. loaf; beef 4d to 6d per lb; mutton 3d to 4d.”*
Saddlers were, like coachbuilders and shoeing smiths,
much more important than they are now. One of the
earliest in Goulburn was John Collins, but nothing is known
of him now except the name. R. T. McAlister was a saddler
here for 51 years. He died in 1905 when the business was
continued by his son Thomas.
There have been several sawmillers and joinery works.
One of the earliest and most important was Thomas Wilkie’s
"Victoria Sawmills, Joinery and Moulding Works,” started
in Goulburn about 1853. Wilkie began as a contractor,
then developed the joinery and moulding side in 1887.f
Under the heading of "Another City Improvement” the
Goulburn "Herald” recorded that "for the first time in the
history of Goulburn a veritable street shoe-black made his
appearance in our principal street. He is a grown man,
and is provided with the usual box and brushes. Whether
he is destined to be successful is hard to predict.” The
"Herald” continued to report upon his progress, as a fort-
night later, that the spot "on which for a few days the
paraphernalia of the enterprising gentleman, whose occupa-
tion was the blacking of mud-bespattered boots, was
vacant.” Goulburn did not patronise him and he had to
seek a police pass to Sydney. $

There are many references in the Municipal Council ’s
minutes of 1869 to “ Simon’s slaughter-house. ’’ The Garoo-
rigang” slaughter yards are mentioned in police-court pro-
ceedings in 1877. *
Goulburn has always had a soap factory. McGovern’s
was the first. It was started in 1846 by Jas. McGovern, after-
wards the second mayor of Goulburn. Another account
says it was founded in 1834. McGovern died in 1886 and
the widow carried on the business. The Goulburn Soap
Company was started in 1886 by Hunt, Mills and Evenis.
This was in Grafton Street. The Southland Manufacturing
Coy. succeeded to the McGovern interests and in turn sold
out to the Pioneer Manufacturing Coy. Ltd., which still
functions, f
Theophilus Kirke, who is mentioned in several other
capacities and connections in this history such as school-
master, Town Clerk, etc., was in business as a stationer. In
1876 he bought the Yass business of Davies, Alexander and
Coy. and sold out his Goulburn establishment to W. S. Fox-
all. W. S. Foxall’s stationer’s shop occupied the ground
floor of a three-storey building still standing in Auburn
Street, originally erected by him for the Colonial Mutual
Life Assurance Society. That institution’s indifferent sculp-
ture still crowns the building. $
Stone was quarried in Goulburn at a very early date.
Sir Thomas Mitchell wrote in 1836:
“Near the Wollondilly, and a few miles from Towrang, a
quarry of crystalline variegated marble, has been recently
wrought to a considerable extent, and chimney-pieces, tables, etc.
now ornament most good houses at Sydney.”§
A company was formed in Goulburn in 1849 for the
purpose of stone-quarrying. Which was its quarry is now
hard to say but probably either the Municipal or the Rail-
way quarry at North Goulburn. Another quarry from
which a considerable amount of stone was taken is that at
the corner of Cowper and Yerner Streets. Its first owner
was Burke. In one of these quarries the petrified foot of
an aborigine was found.||

The business of J. Turner and Sons, monumental masons,
Verner Street was established by Robert Turner in 1860 and
considerably extended in 1879. Turners did much work
on St. Saviour’s Cathedral from 1871 to 1884 and built the
Soldiers’ Chapel in 1920. They have quarries at Marulan
and Bundanoon. Wm. Duncan started monumental works
in 1868. Upon his death the widow carried on the business.
Walter J. Furber had a stonemason’s yard in Verner Street.
Furber was born in England in 1850 and came to Australia
in 1857. He settled in Goulburn and carried out all the
stonework of the Court House and the Roman Catholic
Cathedral.
In Market Street where the Soldiers’ Club is now were
monumental works owned by a man named Cranston. Al-
though well outside the municipal boundaries the Chatsbury
Slate Quarries at Middle Arm may be considered a Goulburn
venture. They were first worked in the sixties. Re-opened
in 1912, a syndicate of 32 subscribed £10 each and did a
little prospecting. In 1913 a company was floated, nominal
capital £25,000, of which the public was asked for £5000.
Only 3000 shares were taken up. Allan Turner was the
secretary. An attempt to turn the Tarlo River was a failure.
Enoch Ashley, a director, undertook the management. In
1915 F. G. White of Exeter invested £5000, the stream was
diverted and some clearing done. In 1917 the quarry was
closed. In 1919 F. G. White and A. F. Carr invested
£10,000 and secured G. Williams as manager. For a while
the quarry paid until the machinery collapsed. No funds
being available for replacement, the company went into
liquidation. Carr and White then floated the N.S.W. Slate
Company, which began operations about 1923, with H.
Thomas as manager. From then until 1928 considerable
development took place. This company went into liquida-
tion during the depression when White and Colin Rodgers
carried on until 1934. Work ceased then. Chatsbury
slates may be seen on the roof of Dr. Williams’ house in
Bourke Street, the Goulburn High School and the original
nurses’ home at the Goulburn District Hospital. Slates
were also sent to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Can-
berra. *

The Australian Stores were established in 1837 by Isaac
Levey of Sydney and Samuel Davis of Goulburn, both Jews.
In 1841 the original premises were extended. The business
was carried on in the name of S. Davis. A partner, Phil
Dignam, represented the city in Parliament. There are a
number of trading tokens of 1837 extant. In 1856 Davis
retired and the business was entrusted to W. Davies, as
manager for Levey on his sole account. In 1860 a new
firm, Davies, Alexander and Coy., was formed, the partners
being W. Davies, Jacob Alexander and Isaac Levey. Isaac
Levey died and his share went to Montague Levey, his son.
Maurice Alexander, who at one time represented Goulburn
in Parliament, though not a partner, managed the Sydney
end of the business. In 1875 Levey sold out to the other
partners and in 1877 Alexander sold out to Davies who there-
upon became sole proprietor.
Wm. Davies was several times Mayor of Goulburn and
also represented the City in Parliament. In 1880 he built
new premises immediately opposite the Post Office. The
store was 66 feet wide and 200 feet long. At the time of
their erection these premises constituted the most important
shop in the city. In 1886 W. Lane who had another business
in Market Street, trading as Lane and Coy., acquired the
business. Lane and Coy. on the 21/8/1890 disposed of the
business to Harwood and Coy. The first premises (1837/
1841) much altered, still stand and are occupied by J. E.
Hunt and Sons and Bennett and Wood. The extent of the
second premises (1880) can be guaged from the walls which
now enclose a yard and the illustrations in various "bird's
eye views of Goulburn” published in the eighties and nine-
ties. When the Australian Stores ceased to operate the
premises were converted into an arcade of 16 shops with a
central corridor. In the corridor was "an orchestral organ”
and "a number of gas globes and brackets.” J. Bond,
draper, opened in the "Old Australian Store.”•
S. Emanuel had the "Beehive Store” in the forties. His
advertisement appears in one of the earliest issues of the
Goulburn "Herald.”! Thirty years later Eiley Brothers had
it. The memory of Bull and Woodward, an early firm of

storekeepers is kept alive by the old stone archway in
Market Street, built about 1843. Their initials “B & W”
appear in the keystone. That archway now affords an
entrance to the Goulburn Club, whose conveyance of the
property contains a stipulation that the Club shall keep it
in good repair.
A Bill-head of Bull and Woodward’s reads:
“Commercial Stores,
Goulburn.
Bot. of Bull and Woodward
Dealers in Drapery,
Grocery, Ironmongery, Spirits &c.
N.B. The Produce of the Neighbourhood bought or taken
in exchange for goods.”
Another Market Street business was E. Butler’s drapery
store. The building still stands, though much altered. It
is now the Railway Institute.
Cohen and Solomon, “Waterloo Store, (opposite the
Jail), Auburn Street,” dealt in Colonial Produce, Drapery,
Wines, Spirits, Tea, Sugar, Shot, Grindery and Saddlery.
Joseph Collins (“Collin’s Noted Cheap Store”) was
described as “opposite the Lock-up.” He dealt in every-
thing and was a buyer of gold, wool, tallow and sheep-skins.*'
Chas. MacAlister writing of the year 1833 (a mistake for
1837) said:
“Close by Mat. Healey’s Hotel, Messrs. Moses and Benjamin—
Goulburn’s earliest firm of storekeepers, had just started a
flourishing store where you could get a pound of tea for 6/-
and a pound of tobacco for 8/-, black sugar (few settlers ever
saw white in these days) from 9d to 1/- per pound.”!
Benjamin and Moses were the pioneer storekeepers in
Goulburn, first in the old township and later in the old Ar-
gyle Stores, now the site of the Imperial Hotel. A Bill-head
of 1862 enumerates their stock-in-trade:
“Grindery of every description, Pistols and Fowling pieces,
Gunpowder and Shot, Haberdashery, Drapery, Hosiery and Sad-
dlery, Sole and Kipp Leather, Wines, Spirits, Tea, Sugar, To-
bacco,Groceries, General assortment of Clothing, Crockery, Iron-
mongery, Wilkinson’s Sheep Shears, Wool Packs, Bags and
Bagging, Paints, Oil and Turpentine with an extensive assort-
ment of every description of Goods on the most reasonable
terms. ”t

In 1841 they established boiling down works (boiling
down sheep and cattle for tallow.) The works were jnst
below Governor’s Hill; 100 to 200 bullocks and 1500 sheep
were handled weekly. The resulting tallow realised £2O/25
per ton. In 1850 it realised “the highest prices in Sydney.”
The Boiling Down works, dwelling and outhouses, described
as “1 mile from P.O. and 5 minutes from North Goulburn
trucking yards” were advertised for sale in 1886.* A firm
which underwent many changes was O. Furner and Sons,
afterwards becoming Furner Bros, and Coy., Furner Bros,
and Jones, and Jones and Coy. Owen Furner began busi-
ness in 1862 and continued until 1885 when he handed it
over to his sons. Jones and Coy., began business in 18/8
on the site of the “Salutation Inn” now Rogers. They
amalgamated with Furners and built the “Premier” Stores.
Owen Furner continued a produce and timber business in
Bradley Street. Part of Burner’s buildings were incor-
porated in Rogers’ store. The corner with the tower was
designed by E. C. Manfred.f Knowlman and Son, on the
corner of Auburn and Market Streets have an interesting
history. The original corner building was convict built,
but for what purpose is not now clear. Musgrave s sadd-
ler’s shop was the first business venture upon this site. This
was in the fifties. In one of the numerous rebuildings of
the portion of the present store formerly occupied by
Fraser’s Buildings the long buried tan-pits were uncovered
together with loads of scrap leather. Musgraves tanned
their own leather and their saddles and harness were to be
found all over the Southern districts. The site was next
occupied by Stilling and Lane who advertised as “The Cor-
ner Shop.” Stilling and Lane advertised in 1876 that they
had purchased the business of Butler and Coy. Butler and
Coy. advertised that they had not done so. After some
weeks of displayed contradictory advertisements Butler ad-
vertised :
“Mr. Edwin Butler accepted Messrs. W. Perry & Coy. as
his agents until they put him into the asylum; but he never
allowed them to sell his business to Messrs. Stilling & Lane for
reasons already published in evidence.”!

In 1877 W. Lane bought out his partner. Lane and
Company’s advertisement for many years was a very
straight and exceptionally tall hat. John Knowlman estab-
lished his business here in 1888 as a branch of Knowlman
Brothers of London. He bought the corner site seven years
later from Lane for £3250. It was described at the time
as “the most valuable property which has changed hands
in Goulburn for some time.” The first rebuilding carried
the old store back to the lane which divides it from the
Railway Institute. A year or two later the Albion Hotel
lost its license and it was incorporated. Fraser’s buildings
next came on the market and now, much altered, house the
hardware and crockery departments. They formerly housed
in turn the Union, Australasia and City Banks. Finally
the complete rebuilding in recent years has eliminated all
traces of the old buildings which previously occupied the
site.*
Chas. Rogers and Sons Pty. Ltd. were established in 1859,
their founder Chas. Rogers, previously a furniture manu-
facturer in Manchester, England. He landed in Melbourne
during the gold fever in 1856. In 1858 he started in busi-
ness as a furniture maker in Goulburn, but was killed in a
coaching accident in 1864. He was succeeded by his son
Charles, aged 20, who in 1871 established the present busi-
ness. He built the “Great Arcade” in 1878, a building still
standing and now occupied by R. D. Gray and Sons Ltd.
This building was originally surmounted by a tall tower 112
feet high. It was lit by electric light at a cost of £750.
The tower was condemned by the Municipal Council and
demolished in 1911.f About 1871 Rogers established a line
of coaches between Goulburn and Yass, also a horse bazaar
and livery stables. When in 1875 the railway moved south
he established branch stores at Gunning, Binalong and Har-
den. In 1889 he started a large “Steam Joinery and
Cabinet Works” beneath the Arcadia Rink. In 1901 he
bought the present site of the business and in 1902 the
present buildings were begun. Further instalments were
built in 1903 and 1908. He was his own architect and
clerk of works with the result that what these buildings lose
in grace and style they make up in strength and durability.

At the rear of the skating rink in Sloane Street lies an old
tombstone without any inscription. This is a relic of
one of Charles Rogers’ elaborate jokes. In the de-
pression of 1893 it looked for a while as if Rogers might
not be able to carry on. Some of his rivals sought to take
a rather sharp advantage of him by purchasing his stock
from his creditors. In the meantime Rogers secured the
necessary accommodation and to his competitors’ chagrin
carried on. Rogers’ revenge was neat. He put up a tomb-
stone in his window to the financial memory of his competi-
tors, mentioning them by name. This second Charles died
at Colombo in 1909. The business passed to three of his
sons, George, Russell and Norman. In 1930 the business
was converted into a Proprietary Company with a represent-
ative of the fourth generation, Bruce Rogers, on the
directorate. #
H. Wilson’s “Goulburn Store” was a two-storey build-
ing. An invoice of 1855 gives the following prices:
“6 lbs. sugar 3/-, tea 1/-, coffee 1/9 5/9
2 dozen eggs 5/
2 currants 3/-, 3 yds. calico 1/6 4/6
2 pair stockings 2/6, habit shirt 5/9 8/3
Pair boots 8/-, soap Bd. 8/8 ”t
One of the earliest tailors in Goulburn was Munoz. He
was a Spaniard. He died on the 9/8/1880 after forty
years’ residence in Goulburn.He lived where Meyer and
Manfred now have their offices in Montague Street. “Crick”
Butler, a noted horseman and rifle shot, had a tailor’s shop
near Bladwell’s present establishment. “Crick” Butler’s
business (Butler and Martyn) was purchased in the eighties
by Fatzens Bros, who employed 30 hands. § J. Bell was a
“Tailor and Draper” in Goulburn 1854. His bill-head dis-
played the Royal Arms.||
David Beattie had a small tannery in Clinton Street in
the late forties. This was taken over by Teece. Thomas
Johnson was mentioned as a tanner in 1849. Beer had a
tannery in Grafton Street. The nuisance arising therefrom
was complained of in 1878. Hadfield and Powell were in

business as tanners and -curriers at Eastgrove. Joseph
Hadfield had a romantic career. He fought in the Burmese
war and the Indian mutiny. He came to Australia about
1852 and joined the mounted police. He later opened a
store at Binda which was stuck up by Ben Hall’s gang.
He gave evidence at their trial. Later he was employed
by Wm. Davies at the Australian Stores. He died on the
31/3/1906.*
James Summergreen was a “tin-plate maker” in 1850.
E. G. Woodhall had quite an extensive tin factory “between
the two ranges at the east of this city.” Eight hands were
employed who lodged with the proprieor. “Mr. W. had
gone a step in the right direction by establishing a night
school specially for his little staff.” The factory turned
out jam and baking powder tins, mainly for A. M. Hunt
and Coy.f
J. Clerke, Auburn Street, was an umbrella maker in
18914 „ J
There was an element of ghoulishness in the undertakers’
advertisements of the eighties. One advertised “cheap”
funerals, the other “the cheapest.” Funeral notices in-
vited friends to “attend his funeral” and “meet his re-
mains. § Colombus Fitzpatrick was an undertaker in the
fifties on the site now occupied by W. H. Wheatley’s office.
He had an unusual and engaging way of advertising, e.g.:
“Coffin furniture
Mr. C. Fitzpatrick has brought from Sydney ‘an assortment
of cheap coffin-wood !’ and assures all those ‘who may have the
misfortune to require his services’ that he will meet the ‘De-
pression of the times.’ ‘His hearse is ready at an hour’s notice
to go near and far. ”||
The original Robert Craig came to Goulburn in 1837
and began business as a cabinet maker and undertaker,
agent for the Government Savings Bank, the Sydney “Mail”
and the “Sydney Morning Herald.” He advertised: “Res-
pectable references here and in Sydney at the 'Herald’
Office. ” ## The business passed to his son Robert Craig, junr.

Upon his death the widow took charge. Later the business
passed to the late Robert Sidney Craig, son of James Craig,
the explorer. It is now conducted by his executors.
G. Richards was an undertaker in Bourke Street. He
died in 1876 when his widow advertised that she “will carry
on the business.” Walter Daniel succeeded to the Richards ’
interests. His premises were opposite the Bourke St. Public
School (now occupied by Godfrey), the sign “undertaker” is
still visible. P. Murphy was advertising in 1895. He was
bought out by Kelly and Son. Murphy was drowned in
1911. He was then a cabman but was driving Kelly’s
hearse out to Gundary one stormy night. The hearse over-
turned in the swollen creek. Murphy was drowned but
Kelly was discovered dazed and exhausted near Lansdowne
Bridge. One horse was drowned and one escaped.!
Dennis Carroll was a water-carrier in the fifties. In
1876 Denis O’Brien and John Flynn were in partnership
as water-carriers, trading as Denis O’Brien, Flynn and Coy.
They advertised that water had been reduced from 1/- to
9d. per cask and that “widows and orphans can have credit
as usual.” F. Johnson followed with an advertisement
reducing his charges to 9d. Another water-carrier was
Martin Horan “better known as Martin Tosney” who died
at the age of 71 in 1897. He came to Goulburn “When it
was a small village.” For the last 14 years of his life he
was crippled through a fall from his cart.!
The first Wheelwright was A. Stewart (father of Alick
and Fred Stewart) who started business in 1848 and made
the first dray in Goulburn. Previously all such vehicles
for this district had been made by Graham of Liverpool.
E. A. Hodgson was in business as a whip-maker “next
O’Leary’s” in Auburn Street in 1889.§
We are apt to think of Wool Sales as a very recent
development in the commercial life of Goulburn. Never-
theless wool was sold here in 1845 at l/s|d per lb. The
old Australian Stores were buying wool at an early date.*

representing overseas interests have competed freely for of-
ferings and the Wool Buyers’ Association extended official
recognition to Goulburn as a selling centre. Total clear-
ances of the two companies operating in Goulburn, Ray
Bladwell and Coy. Ltd., and R. D. Gray and Sons, Ltd., in
1938, amounted to 15,000 bales. Bladwell’s paid up capital
in 1939 was £8787/10/-, and its total assets were
£22,261/15/8.1 R. D. Gray and Sons Pty. Ltd., at first dis-
played the wool for buyers’ inspection in Gillespie’s Boot
factory. Later they built a large store and showroom on
the Glebe. After two years they found this inadequate
and purchased the "Arcade” building in Auburn Street.
In 1936 Ray Bladwell and Coy. Ltd. built their stores at the
corner of Clinton and Sloane Streets. At the outbreak of
the war in 1939 all wool was taken over by the Common-
wealth Government and auction sales were discontinued.
Goulburn was recognised as an appraising centre at which
Government valuers appraised all wool sent to the stores.
For the season over 15,000 bales were so appraised. The
Goulburn Repacking and Reclassing Company arranged for
the reclassing and pooling of small clips, t
The manufacture of cloth in Goulburn was first mooted
in 1849. The local press was most enthusiastic. It had
"no fear that the Goulburn Cloth Works will ever be idle.”
It pictured the wool grown within a few miles "of where
it will be woven.” Hovell, Thorn, Collins, Marks, Mandel-
son, Sinclair, Marsden, Simons, Webster and Dignam were
interested. Nothing came of these hopes for eighty years.
The prospectus of the Goulburn Woollen Manufacturing Co.
Ltd., was advertised in 1878. A factory was contemplated
for the manufacture of woollen cloths, tweeds, blankets and
flannels. The capital was to be £30,000. The interim
secretary was Phillip G. Myers. The attendance at the
meeting to launch the project was poor and the matter was
held over for a more suitable opportunity, which never
arose.* The "Goulburn Woollen Mills Ltd.” were estab-
lished in 1922. The venture was badly managed and by
1929 the losses totalled £128,985. Amalgamated Textiles
Ltd. took over the mills in June, 1929, purchasing them from

the liquidators. They now employ 95/100 hands, with an
additional 30/40 when a night shift is worked. The pay-
roll totals £250 per week. The mill turns out tropical cloths
which can be used for men’s suitings or ladies’ costumes.
They also make tie materials, haircloth and tie linings. The
mill is at Bradfordville, Kenmore, where numbers of cot-
tages have been built for and by the employees.!
F. W. Sandell, manufacturer of children’s clothing, etc.,
started a factory in Goulburn in 1918, paying out over £3OOO
per annum in wages. The factory closed in February, 1930,
when 40 employees were dismissed. At peak periods it em-
ployed 100 hands. Three months later the factory was
re-opened by a new company, F. W. Sandell Ltd. In
October that year it shut down in Goulburn and removed
to Sydney. The reasons given were that railway and postal
rates gave an advantage to the manufacturer in the metro-
politan area which “ unfortunately outweigh any which exist
away from it.” So Goulburn lost another industry 4
In 1940, the second year of the war, at the invitation
of the Commonwealth Government, Goulburn Munitions Coy.
Ltd., was mooted, with a nominal capital of £IOO,OOO. After
months of delay the Commonwealth Government announced
its decision to place a munitions factory here, the same to be
built, equipped and conducted by the Government^

CHAPTER XVI.
THE INNS OF OLD GOULBURN.
HERE are thirteen hotels in Goulburn to-day. Once
there were seventy-four.* One hundred, seventy-five
or even fifty years ago they played a much more
important part in the life of the community than they do
to-day. The Circuit Court, the Police Magistrate’s Court,
the Hospital Ball, the performances of local and visiting
dramatic and concert parties were all held in hotels, as were,
on occasion, municipal and parliamentary elections and all
sorts of public meetings. The first hotel in Goulburn was
naturally built in the “Old Township” now North Goulburn.
It was Matt. Healy’s, licensed on the 28/6/1832, of whom
Chas. MaeAlister wrote, speaking of 1833, if not earlier:
'/Within a stone’s throw of the Court House Mat Healey, the
pioneer publican of Goulburn, ran his licensed shanty and dis-
pensed the Colonial 'Jamaica’ and 'barley-bree. ’ ”t
A little later Ben Gould was the licensee. His name
is still to be read on the stone barn behind "Riversdale,”
which barn is probably the oldest building standing in Goul-
burn to-day. One account states that Ben Gould called
his inn "the Victoria.”! The second inn was also in the Old
Township. It was John or Jack Cole’s "Mounted Police-
man Inn,” licensed on the 25/6/1833. John Cole’s
"Policeman’s Arms” appears again in 1834. In 1833 also
Wm. Ealy Simpson’s "Brickmaker’s Arms” was licensed.
Three years later the following advertisement appears:
"Travellers Home Inn, Goulburn Plains, (formerly known as
the Policeman’s Arms”). 'Solomon Moses begs to inform his
friends and the inhabitants of Goulburn, Yass and its vicinity
and travellers in general that he has opened the above Inn,
which has been fitted up in a superior manner for the comfort
and convenience of families, and travellers honouring him with
their patronage. It will be his study to give satisfaction to
all calling at the 'Travellers Home.’ Comfortable beds, good
stabling and a choice selection of best wines, etc.”
Goulburn Plains, 1/7/1836.§
I* 1 the year 1838 the only two licensed houses had lost
their license for some trivial offence. Brodie who had built
and furnished both of them, offered himself to take over
the license of the "Salutation” Inn but the Magistrate would

not agree. Travellers complained bitterly that the only
two respectable houses in Goulburn had been shut and that
people were annoyed. The matter is said to have been put
before Governor Gipps who had it rectified.*
Alexander Harris, “An emigrant mechanic,” writing
in 1847, paints an unpleasant picture of conditions in the
Goulburn “grog houses” of that time. He speaks of free
men “earning their money like horses and spending it like
asses,” of their knocking up a £l7 “check” in 1| days on
rum, of the police “assisting at the spree,” irrespective of
whether the house was licensed or not.f
The 15/4/1845 was appointed as the day for the renewal
of licenses for the sale of liquors. There were two new
applicants and both were refused, “Mr. O’Brien who had
spent a large sum of money on a two-storey building for an
inn was one of these.” This was probably “The Harp of
Erin” now known as the “Alcestan.” The first inn was
a bark-roofed humpy, its landlord O’Brien. The hospital
ball was held here in 1848, and the “Tradesmen’s Ball” in
1849. The advertisement of this read:
“Respectable persons will be admitted by applying to the
stewards. ’ 1
The hotel was rebuilt in the nineties and the name short-
ened to the “Harp.” In 1864 for a while it was known as
the “London Tavern” when Thomas Skinner succeeded Mrs.
O’Brien. Alex. Nixon had it in the eighties. T. O’Leary
followed him. Later it was bought by W. J. Bartlett who
added to it considerably. In 1925 A. W. Oldfield bought
it and spent some £IO,OOO in remodelling it. All its ancient
features have vanished, although some of the original walls
The “Australian Arms,” a delicensed hotel, still
stands at the corner of Clifford and Cowper Streets. Owen
Boyle had it in 1853. Thomas Fallon was landlord in 1877.
It is now Murray’s service station.§ The “Australian Hotel,”
opened by John Mcßae in 1856, adjoining the old “Aus-
tralian Stores” has long since disappeared.|| The “Albion,”
otherwise known as the “Bobbie Burns” was kept by Far-

Wm. Clarke. It now forms part of Knowlman’s store. The
Argyle, ” a delicensed hotel standing in Montague Street,
is a very old building. McKellar was the first licensee.
Daniel Duggan, the landlord in 1848, advertised “specially
catering for country settlers.’ ’ He was fined £2 and 2/6
costs for not keeping a lamp burning from sunset to sunrise.
He blamed the heavy frosts for congealing the oil. The
bench did not accept the excuse but told him “to keep his
lamps trimmed.” Farquahar Ross succeeded Mrs. McKel-
lar in 1854. Sandy McDonnell was landlord in the fifties
and sixties. Chas. MacAlister wrote of Sandy:
“It was child’s play for him to lift 28 gallons of spirits off the
dray and carry it 20 yards or more to the hotel bar, or the cellar
at the old Argyle Inn.”*
The “Sir John Barleycorn” has disappeared. Andrew
Newman, in 1848, advertised stabling for large teams, good
larder and clean beds. Nevertheless he was refused a license
at the first time of asking.f The “Beehive” still stands;
it is now the “Club House Hotel.” It was once kept by
S. Emanuel, then by George McConnell, (father and son).
A polling booth for a municipal election was arranged here
in 1869. When it was the “Beehive” its sign ran:
“In this house we’re all alive,
Good liquor makes us funny.
If you are dry, come and try
The virtue of our honey.”
It was reopened, in 1876, by Chas. Thomas as “Thomas’
Family Hotel.” W. Nash had it in 1887. Other well-
known landlords were S. Pearson, A. A. and Henry Payten,
D. S. Hughes and W. G. Armstrong, all of these in the
eighties. In 1895 J. W. McCabe obtained a license for
“McCabe’s Family Hotel.” This appears to be the same
hotel. Yet another name was the “Palace. The “Bois
Chere” Hotel was on the Yass Road; John Horton was the
licensee in 1876.§ The “Bridge” Hotel was in Auburn
Street on the site now occupied by the Rural Bank. The
hotel was so called from the bridge which used to carry
Auburn Street at this point. The hotel was built by Moses
Beard its first licensee. A ball was held the night it was

opened. Munoz, a tailor, a Spaniard and a great dancer,
was the M.C. The hotel was kept by Joseph Bond in the
eighties and by Topham for many years.* The “Belmore
Arms” the “Criterion,” and the “Club” are three names of
an inn which stood in Auburn Street where is now White’s
boot shop. It was kept at various times by Chas. MacAlister,
Pearson, Mrs. Pearson, Christian Last, W. Woods and Jack
Byrne. Pearson had it in 1876. He advertised:
“One £lO note and one £5 note”
to be disposed of
“by thirty-two subscribers of ten shillings each a
Free Supper will be provided for all subscribers.”
In 1879 when it was offered for sale it was
“selling 3 to 5 hogsheads of ale per month
Beds and meals were 1/- each.f
The “Chequers” was a famous hostelry. It stood on the
site of the present “Club House.” It was built by Wm.
Simons in 1845/6. Simons himself was landlord until 1854
and Mrs. Simons kept it after his death. Other accounts
say that N. Fisher was the landlord in 1848 and that one
Strickland was landlord before him. Plans for street im-
provements were exhibited here in 18504 The “Carriers
Arms” was in Grafton Street; Thomas Moran was the land-
lord in 1854. The “Coach and Horses,” another delicensed
hotel, also stands in Grafton Street. Moran had this in the
forties. He still had it in 1869 when a polling booth for a
municipal election was arranged here. Wm. Rogan had it
in the seventies and eighties. He was also in business as a
blacksmith. His advertisements appear side by side in the
newspapers, just as the smithy adjoined the inn.§ The
“Commercial” Hotel, now known as the “Goulburn” was
built and opened by James Woodward, of Bull and Wood-
ward on the 1/1/1849. The Post Office was housed here for
a while, also the Mechanics’ Institute library from 1853 to
1855. Later the room used by the Post Office became Cobb
and Coy’s, office. In 1850 the landlord staged a valiant
attempt at illuminations for Governor Gipps’ visit. It con-
sisted of two transparencies, one a full length of Queen

spoilt by the window-sashes shewing through. The pro-
prietors stated that they would improve with experience.
The hotel’s first advertisement boasted of "paddocks and
stockyards.” Illustrated advertisements appeared in the
Sydney press in 1854. # The "Rock of Cashel” was an
hotel in Sloane Street, built by J. Maloney about 1858. It
lost its license on or before the 12/10/1876 when it was
offered for sale and passed in at £SBO. Last, late of the
"Criterion” converted it into a boarding-house. The pre-
mises are now occupied by the Estate of R. S. Craig, under-
takers.! There was another hotel called the "Criterion” in
the "Old Township.” It was advertised to let as a "private
or public house” in 18604 The "Cottage of Content” stood
in Sloane Street (No. 308) in the forties, a short distance
from the Goldsmith Street intersection. It was kept by
Samuel Eirth.§ In the Presbyterian registers there is an
entry that Samuel Eirth read the burial service over Gath-
rine McAllum, the minister "not at home, being at Braid-
wood, preaching.” This was in 1852. The "Cooma Inn”
stood at the corner of Mundy Street and the Braidwood
Road, or rather still stands, although long delicensed. It
was built by MeClosky, the first licensee, who sold out to
Joseph Kelly in 1860.|| It was also called the "Mill House
Hotel. ’ ’ The oldest inn in the Goulburn district still stands,
although probably delicensed for a century. It was kept
by Joseph Peters at "Divorow Forest.” The house is on
portion 103 of the parish of Nattery, originally granted to
Joseph Peters. It is mentioned in 1833. It is now ap-
proached by a winding bush track, 3 miles long, turning off
from the Goulburn-Bungonia Road about 9£ miles from Goul-
burn. The first Sydney Road can still be traced in front
of the house and winding up the hill to the north till it
joins Sir Thomas Mitchell’s Great Southern Road about the
Garrick turn-off. The house, a one-storey building, is prac-
tically unchanged from the day it was built, with the ex-
ception of its iron roof, super-imposed upon the shingles.

The walls are of brick, plastered, and all doors and other
wood-work are of cedar. The house was obviously intended
to carry a second storey for the landing for the stairs in the
back hall was built. That second storey, however, was
never built, but the house was roofed in (probably in 1833)
when the ground floor was complete.* The tradition is that
this was done when it was seen that Surveyor-General Mit-
chell’s "new line of the great road” would leave it high
and dry. Joseph Peters was one of those settlers whom
Sir Thomas Mitchell complained "retarded two years
this important work,” a work "impeded by those for whose
benefit the road was intended.”! The house is now on the
Rix Brothers’ property, "Marian Vale,” Nattery. The late
Chas. MacAlister describing his first journey to Goulburn
in 1833 says:
“We camped one night at Joe Peters’ house, which old hands
will remember was the first hostelry between Berrima and Goul-
burn Plains. This Joe Peters was in 1828 over the Iron-gang
at Penrith, and was one of the first ticket-of-leave men to obtain
a grant of land in the County of Argyle. In later years (1839)
he had a public house at Marulan.”t

There is a reference to the old and new lines of road
and to Peters’ Inn in the Waugh correspondence. David
Waugh writing on the 10/2/1835 says:
“There is an old road and a new one. ... by mistake I took the
old line, and did not find I was wrong till I came to Peters’
public-house, at five in the afternoon. The other line runs
nearly parallel to it at about five miles distance.”!
Joseph Peters’ “Woolpack” was licensed on the
17/6/1834. “The Edinburgh Castle,” now delicensed, was
a well-known house on the Taralga road. The present
“Empire” Hotel in Auburn Street has known several names.
At first it was called the “Bazaar.” Chas. MacAlister had
it in 1859 and 1860. He leased it from Wm. Evans. “The
premises,” he says “had, in fact, been just newly erected,
on the understanding that we should open it as an hotel—
so both pub and publican were, so to speak, ‘new chums’ to
the business. ’ ’ His cook was a Frenchman named Rebardy
and his mail-boy Daniel Crotty. In 1863 all three were at
the Lambing Flat diggings. Rebardy was arrested, tried,
convicted and hanged for the murder of Crotty. :f The hotel
has been much rebuilt at various times. It was renamed
the “Oddfellows” and kept by Coyle. James Mann was
licensee in 1863, P. Kennedy in 1886 and Bernard Cullen in
1887. The “Emu” Inn in Auburn Street was kept by J. J.
Richardson. He arrived in Ooulburn in 1857. The hotel
has disappeared. The “Exchange Hotel,” much rebuilt
and altered, still stands at the corner of Grafton and Brad-
ley Streets. Duncan Campbell advertised in 1880 that he
had “converted his late grocery establishment into a first
class hotel.”§ The “Farriers’ Arms” formerly stood on the
old Braidwood Road opposite where Gray’s wool store now
is. It was kept by Joshua King. It was demolished in
1900 when “250 loads of bricks and stone were given to the
municipal council for road ballasting.”|| The “Federal
City” was in Auburn Street where Johnstone and Davie’s
printing office is now. Mandelson had it for a while. Hans
Carlsen was licensee in 1901.* J. Bran advertised a “ball
and supper” at the “Frankfield Inn” in 1869. The “Farm-
ers’ Arms,” “Farmers’ Rest,” or “Farmers’ Hotel,” was

on the Wheeo Road. It advertised a “Free Ball and Supper”
when Alfred Gray took it over in 1877. John Leamey
followed in 1879, also with a free supper. The “Golden
Fleece” at Inveralochy, four miles from Lake Bathurst on
the Goulburn Road, was advertised “to let” in 1849 and
1856. It has long since disappeared. Charles Payne ad-
vertised in 1852 that he would reopen the “Gold-Diggers’
Arms” so soon as he obtained a license. This hotel was
at the corner of Auburn Street and Verner Street. Another
“Gold-Diggers’ Arms” was on the King’s College site, West
Goulburn. The “Grand Hotel” in Auburn Street was once
the “Cricketers’ Arms,” Wm. Webb had it in 1876. Wm.
Fowler then took it over, relinquishing it to Arthur Gray
in 1880. f In recent years it has been much altered and re-
built, changing its name first to the “Central,” then to the
“Grand Central,” and latterly to the “Grand.” “Gar-
roorigang” on the Braidwood Road was once an hotel kept
by Chas. Thomas. The “Hotel Gordon” at North Goulburn
has a long history which is now somewhat obscure. Before
ever there was an hotel here, a wine shop occupied the site.
Then followed an inn known as the “Prince of Wales.” The
signboard of this first hotel, a large Fleur de Lys, is pre-
served in the present building. Margaret Finlay was the
licensee in 18894 In 1895 the landlord advertised as follows:
“Fraoch Eilean! The Chieftain’s Home at North Goulburn.
D. C. McDonald, late of the gasworks, has taken over the above
hotel and refitted it. He keeps the best beers and spirits and
looks after his customers. Go down and see him.”§
Wm. Webb was the landlord in 1901 A The hotel was
delicensed for some twenty years. Upon complete rebuild-
ing it regained its license, the only new one granted in
Goulburn since the turn of the century. It was the occasion
of some controversy, the temperance advocates bringing
their best guns to bear. Attempts to obtain a license for
the Mulwarree Temperance Hotel (Mandelson’s) failed.
The “Harrow” Inn is listed in 1833. Where is stood
is not now certain.

was first licensed on the 6/7/1850 when the landlord was
Duggan, late of the “Argyle.” A little later on it appears
to have lost its license for it was Dr. Hayley’s surgery for
some years. It was reopened as an hotel by Angus Mclnness
in 1880. In 1897 the landlord of the “Hibernian” turned
to good account a scare about the Goulburn water. He
advertised:
“The Water Curse Beware of Water.
Don’t impregnate your system with Microbes and Bacilli, etc.
But why drink Water?
When you can so readily procure.... etc etc. at the Hiber-
nian Hotel.”*
The “Imperial” Hotel at the corner of Auburn and
Verner Streets was formerly called the “Red Prince.” Its
first licensee was Pat Lawler, who called it “The Land we
live in Hotel.” John O’Brien, landlord in the seventies,
advertised for years “Open for Night Trains.”
“One striking feature of the Imperial is its magnificent cellar-
age, excavated at immense expense. These underground apart-
ments are cool, light and dry and admirably adapted for City
luncheon rooms, the want of which has been long felt by business
men in Goulburn.”
However, the hotel continued and still continues and
the cellars fulfil the admirable function for which they were
designed.! “Kenmore” Hotel, now delicensed, was more
often known, and still is known as “Confoy’s” after its
licensee. Races were held here and in later times the Golf
Club had its links here for a while. The “Junction” hotel
on the Crookwell and Laggan Roads was extensively ad-
vertised by Wm. G. Galewood in 1886. The “Kingsdale”
hotel is said to have been opened by Robert Kennedy about
1880. John Fardey was advertising it in 1886. It was
offered for sale in 1889. The “Lord McDonald” inn stood
at the corner of Auburn and Verner Streets. It was ad-
vertised “to let” in 1852. Applications to S. Moses at the
Royal Hotel. C. Payne had it in 1853 and called it the
“Gold-Diggers Arms.”! One of the most interesting hotels
in Goulburn was “Mandelson’s Goulburn Hotel,” now the
“Mulwaree Temperance Hotel.” Speaking of Goulburn
over 100 years ago, Chas. MacAlister said:

“While a good mile away from the original settlement one Jack
Cole, a good type of the old enduring type of sawyers, was
building another public-house on the present site of Mandel-
son’s Hotel.”*
John Cole appears in the Post Office Directory in 1833
at “ Junction Cottage, Goulburn,” but not as an inn-keeper.
One account says “Junction Cottage” was an inn. Cole’s
“Goulburn Hotel” was built very soon afterwards for it
was offered for sale by the Australian Auction Company on
the 4/5/1840. Later in the year Nathan Mandelson, “late
of the ‘Hit or Miss’ Bungonia,” advertised that he had taken
over the “Goulburn Inn, Goulburn” from “Mr. Cole.”f
In 1842 during the visit of Sir George Gipps to Goulburn,
Mandelson had a bullock roasted there for the aborigines
in honour of the Governor’s visit. In the year 1845 the
original hotel was pulled down and the premises rebuilt.
Although altered and added to, much of this building re-
mains. In 1849 the proprietor advertised:
“Goulburn Hotel. To Constables and others. £1 is offered
by the owner, N. Mandelson, for the arrest of one lad, John
Devlin, assistant ostler, sft. 3in., and a remarkable lump on
right side of nose.”
For the visit of Governor Gipps in 1850 the hotel was
illuminated. It had a “V.R. ” and a Crown on the balcony,
between variegated lamps. J. Roberts “late of the Royal
Hotel” leased the hotel in 1854. Mandelson’s executors
were advertising the hotel “to let for 3 or 5 years,” or for
“absolute sale” in 1869. In 1879 the hotel was lit by gas,
the first business premises to be so lit in Goulburn. It took
14 days after the pipes were connected before the gas could
be used. Water had leaked into the mains and had to be
pumped out by the fire brigade. This little episode cost
the new gas company the work of nine men for some days.
In 1883 J. J. Bruton applied for a transfer of the license to
him and was refused. The Goulburn “Evening Penny Post”
said:
“It is circulated broadcast through the city on the best authority
that ‘John the Flunkey’ at the Royal has taken Mandelson’s
Hotel. It is worth taking and John is just the man to make
the place as popular as ever.”t

A month later John got his license. He advertised “a
chef in charge of the cuisine.’ ’ In 1869 it promised “hot
and cold baths and showers at the shortest notice.” It
ceased to be an hotel for a while in the seventies when G.
Medcalf occupied it as a school. He sold it to Dr. Parry
of Yass for £1425. Edward Forty had it in 1888. It was
delicensed again on the 6/12/1915. In 1897 the proprietor,
J. Swift advertised it as the “Snoslednam” Hotel.* There
was an hotel called the “Mulwarrie Inn” in Grafton Street.
It was advertised to let in 1870.f The “Pelican” at Tir-
ranna, kept by Mrs. Day for many years, was a favourite
resort for honeymooners. In 1889 Moran Bros, were ad-
vertising “a cheap way to spend Sunday afternoon is to
take a drive in Moran Bros.’ large Drag to the Pelican Inn
for 2/6 return fare.”J
The “Market House Tavern” was opened by Henry
Wilson in 1856. It was reopened in 1860. It was sold
in 1878 when A. Prior was the licensee. Matthew McAlister
succeeded Prior. In 1882 Fanny Worchurst changed the
name to “The Post Office Hotel.” The premises still stand
and are now the Radnor Cafe.§ The “Dan O’Connell” Inn,
Auburn Street, was built by Sam Dunn in the forties. The
premises were bought by Chas. Rogers who opened his fur-
niture shop there. This hotel was also known as the
“Plough.”|| The premises of R. D. Gray and Sons Pty. Ltd.,
now occupy the site. W. Hollis obtained a license for the
“Prince Albert” in the Old Township on the 17/4/1849.**
The “Railway Inn” stood at the corner of Cole and Grafton
Streets. It was built by D. McDurragh about 1858, Edward
Naughton succeeded him and held it until the house was
closed. The “Red Lion” has disappeared entirely. It
stood across the railway line past the present service station,
near the cemetery. It was kept by Ben Gould. The
“Retreat Time” on the Mummel Road was kept by one
Frost. The “Rose and Crown” in Clifford Street is said
to have been built by Wm. Asche Adams in the fifties. John
Richardson had it in 1864 when he removed to the “Emu.”

A. E. Osborne was the landlord in the eighties. It was kept
by Mrs. Farqnhar for some years prior to its delicensing.
It was delicensed about 1912. It is (1941) in process of
demolition. No references to the Riggsdale Hotel have
been found in local newspapers. It was obviously a port
of call for the teamsters using the Great South Road. The
“Run of Water” Inn was built by Futton, father of the late
Mrs. J. E. Hunt of Joppa. He named it the “Oliver Gold-
smith’’ in memory of his native village. It is said that Sir
John Young, noticing the name paid a call and found the
proprietor was an old college mate. Some verses, by the
son, John J. Futton, written in 1865, are extant and describe
the three inns, the “Oliver Goldsmith,” the “Traveller’s
Rest” and the “Bois Chere” on the banks of the “Run of
Water.”* It is mentioned in the Police Duty Book on the
25/8/1866. A “Ball and Supper” were advertised as tak-
ing place there in 1869.f The “Royal” in Auburn Street
is the oldest licensed house in Goulburn. Abraham Moses
bought the site from the Crown on the 5/5/1836, two allot-
ments, for one of which he paid £9 and for the other
£l2/8/6. He sold them on the 19/12/1840, to Solomon
Moses, inn-keeper, who proceeded straight away to build
an hotel. This first building cost £9OO and, though consid-
erably altered in the interior and added to on the frontage,
much of it still stands. It was opened on the 1/7/1841.
The house then contained “17 commodious and well-aired
sleeping apartments.” The stables, 132 feet in length, ac-
commodated 20 horses. The Governor and Lady Gipps
stayed here in 1842 and were much impressed with the work-
manship of the building and its furniture. MacAlister says
the hotel was not built until 1843. This is obviously in-
correct. That year, however, Solomon Moses was adver-
tising a‘ ‘ Superior Billiard Table. ’ ’ He also advertised
for a billiard-marker who could produce from his last em-
ployer a certificate of sobriety. In 1849 Moses was ad-
vertising it to let. It is said to have been sold in 1853
but probably it was only leased. Joseph Jones, another Jew,
from the “Harp” at Queanbeyan, took it over and conducted
it for many years. The first Circuit Court in Goulburn is
said to have been held here in 1847, and the Chief Justice,

Sir Alfred Stephen was entertained here. In 1850 Governor
Sir Chas. Fitzroy stayed here. That year too the anti-
transportation meetings were held in this hotel. On the
12/1/1859 Moses sold out to John Joseph Roberts, then an
inn-keeper, for £4500. Somewhere about this time Frank
Gardiner, the notorious bushranger, is said to have been the
barman. Roberts must have done more building for two
years later he sold out to John Warn, grazier, for £BOOO.
The lease, stock and goodwill were sold for £I7OO in 1887.
J. J. Bruton, known as “John the Flunkey,” was a well-
known identity here in the eighties. He returned years
afterwards as landlord for in 1905 he sold out for £4OOO
to J. G. McLaughlin. He died on the 2/3/1911, and his
obituary notice stated that he was 25 years landlord of the
“Royal.” The Goulburn “Herald” headed the following
story “Omnibus in rebus Augustic.” The Royal Hotel
omnibus (with a passenger, one Emery, on board for the
railway station), was standing outside the hotel, its driver
occupied in the hotel, when the horses bolted. They col-
lided with the iron posts outside Furner’s store and buckled
them. Emery bumped his head against the glass window
and smashed it. He called out to the driver threatening to re-
port him for furious driving. The ’bus passed the station and
T’h'd jS'Oya.C HabeZ
at last the horses fell against another post. Total damage
to other peopled property was £2O which was borne by the
landlord of the Royal. Much to his indignation Emery was
asked to pay for the damage done to the ’bus by his head.*

The hotel property after eighty years is still in the Warn
Estate. All the licensees since Roberts have been lessees
only.* The "Royal Oak” in the Sooley Valley still stands
although long since delicensed. It was established in the
fifties. The licensee in the eighties, Robert Fenwick, had
a sense of humour. The Goulburn "Herald,” writing of
the city water supply, mentioned the Sooley Creek as flow-
ing at the rate of 274 miles per hour, meaning of course 2f
miles per hour. In the next issue Fenwick came out with a
displayed advertisement:
“Royal Oak Inn. Niagara Eclipsed.
“The greased lightening rapids, lately known as the Sooley
Creek, flow past this commodious hotel, at a velocity of 274 miles
per hour (see Goulburn Herald of 17th inst.) These are the
swiftest rapids in the world.
“R. Fenwick, while thanking the public for their liberal
patronage during the past thirty years, hopes by the above un-
paralelled curiosity to obtain a yet more liberal support, as
arrangements are being made to ensure the comfort of crowds
of tourists in this marvellous locality.
Sooley Valley, 19th April, 1880. Robert Fenwick.”!
Margaret Fenwick had the house in 1895. The name
of the "Salutation” Inn crops up all through Goulburn’s
history. It stood at the corner of Auburn and Montague
Streets where Rogers ’ store now is. It was open in 1839
for William Nixon, "waiter at the Salutation Inn” had a
daughter baptised by the Rev. Wm. Sowerby. Thos. Brodie
built the "Salutation” and in the forties he and McKellar
were the licensees, t In 1848 the landlord, G. Wheatley,
was fined for Sunday trading. He blamed one of the lodgers
for pinching and selling the rum, but the Bench did not
accept the excuse. § Dr. John Dunmore Lang stayed at the
Salutation Inn in 1843, 1845 and 1846 and left his impres-
sions on record:
“The inns in the town are quite splendid for the interior of a
colony. I took up my quarters during my stay, which proved
to be longer than I anticipated, at the Salutation Inn, an ex-
tensive and superior establishment of the kind, the property of
Mr. Thomas Brodie, a respectable Scotsman who arrived in the
colony as one of a company of Scotch mechanics whom I carried
out in the year 1831 to erect certain buildings for an academical
institution or college in Sydney. After fulfilling his engage-
ment, Mr. Brodie settled in Goulburn, where he amassed con-
siderable property in the way of his business, and where he

built the large and well-conducted house of accommodation for
travellers which he has latterly found it expedient to retain in
his own hands.”
Dr. Lang then goes on to say:
“I had no bill to pay here, having experienced a cordial wel-
come from Mr. Brodie, who insisted that, as far as I was
concerned, I should go 'Scot Free* for ‘Auld Langsyne.’ ”*
Public meetings were mostly held at the “Salutation’ ’
as e.g., in 1850, when such were held “to discuss the erection
of a bridge at the South end of Auburn Street.” Lewis
Jones “took over” from F. Webster on the 5/12/1853. In
1871 when the “Salutation” was in charge of Mrs. Mary
Craig, an advertisement assured patrons that the “stables
are still in charge of the well-known groom ‘Tricker.’
Charles MacAlister himself “took over” from James Simons
in 1879. In 1887 the old “Salutation” was demolished and
the license transferred to Mandelson’s buildings in Auburn
Street.! This second “Salutation” Inn was renovated in
1894. Lieutenant Henderson, in 1851, was not so well im-
pressed by Goulburn’s hotels. He wrote that he
"spent the night at the house of the Colonial surgeon here,
to whom I had an introduction, and whom I found extremely
hospitable. My horse I put up at the inn, or public-house,
where I found, as in most others of the kind, they know well
how to charge, the sum of ten shillings being the modest demand
for the stall, and rack full of withered straw which my poor
nag enjoyed during the night.”!
Dame Mary Gilmore wrote of the “Salutation Inn” in
its middle period:
"The floor seemed to be of split slabs —or something quite as
uneven — and was covered with a cotton drugget. There was
a table with an album, and a wool mat, and a piano that struck
shudders down the spine when touched. The menu, so far as
I recollect it, consisted chiefly of corned beef that was always
steamed, and cabbage that never ceased to run oil at every pore.
But clean! —the windows in their old fashioned setting were like
crystal, and you could have eaten off the floor.”s
The “Shamrock” still stands in Clinton Street, though
no longer an hotel. It is just below Cooper’s store. It
was kept by Fitzpatrick for years. Alex Nixon had it in
1889. In 1892 the Municipal Council’s bailiff went round
to distrain for overdue rates. The landlord had wind of
it beforehand and removed his furniture so that there was
nothing upon which distraint could be levied. Another

name for this hotel was the “Werriwa.” James White,
of the “Australian Arms” had it in 1901.* The “Star” in
Reynolds Street was an hotel for many years. J. Jones,
“Proprietor” was advertising the “Star Hotel Reynolds
Street... .to sell or to let by Private Contract” in 1869.
A polling booth for a Parliamentary election was arranged
here in 1877. In later years before it was delicensed it was
kept by Holmes.f Clifford’s Hotel, “opposite the Railway
Station,” advertised in 1875 by J. Clifford for sale as re-
gards its lease, license, fixtures and goodwill would appear
to be another name for the “Terminus” or “Southern Rail-
way” hotel. He sold out to Henry Gordon. The Union
Bank had its office here before Dodd opened it as an hotel.
Other landlords were Jas. Stevenson (1880) and Matt. Mac-
Alister (1888)4 The present “TattersalPs” hotel in Auburn
Street has much the same history as the “Beehive” or
“Club” hotel. It too was formerly “Thomas’ Family
Hotel.” Charles Thomas kept it after he left “Garoori-
gang.” He crossed the street later to the “Beehive.” Al-
though much altered in front the greater part of the present
building was erected as a residence in the early forties for
Wm. Bradley. Afterwards it became the business premises
of the Union Bank. (Another account says the Commer-
cial Bank, but this seems doubtful). It was used as a
private school by Matthew Kennett before Thomas bought
it as an hotel.§ There was an hotel, the “Towrang Inn” at
Towrang from an early date. Towrang in those days was
almost a suburb of Goulburn. The licensee in the early
fifties was Wm. Hy. Wood.|| There were three inns called
the “Travellers’ Rest” in Goulburn. One was in Sloane
Street and was kept by Samuel Eirth, previously of the
“Cottage of Content.” Eirth had it in 1848. On the
29/5/1858 Hy. Wilson bought it. John Horton, inn-keeper
of the “Run-of-Water” Inn, bought it on the 18/11/1859.
Later still it was owned by Samuel Emanuel.** Another
“Travellers’ Rest” was near Rossiville.

Alfred Gray was granted a license for this on the
13/12/1881. A license had been refused on a previous
occasion owing to a lack of “proper accommodation pad-
docks.” A third “Travellers ’ Rest” was at Yarra. The
buildings still stand though long delicensed. Hy. Wilson
had it in 1858. The “Union Club” hotel did not run very
long. It still stands at the corner of Sloane and Bradley
Streets. It was opened in 1883 and housed the Royal
Artillery Band when it came to play at the first show on the
then new showground in Faithfull Street.* John Horton’s
reminiscences date it much earlier. The “Victoria” inn
formerly stood on the corner of Verner and Auburn Streets.
A news paragraph in 1848 said:
“Mr. Gould (Ben.) has removed from old premises in the old
township and expects to open at the corner of Auburn and
Verner Streets opposite the Argyle Stores on the 1/8/1848. ”t
This would seem to be the corner now occupied by P.
Welch, butcher. The “White Horse” was at the corner
of Auburn and Clifford Streets. Tommy Jacob was the
first licensee in March 1885. Previously a saddlery busi-
ness and the “Somerset” boarding establishment was on
this site. After the “White Horse” was delicensed the
City Bank was here. The Colonial Mutual Building is now
on the site. The life-size wooden horse which was the
sign of the “White Horse” for many years was erected by
T. W. Jacob in 1875 to advertise his saddlery business. It
cost £l2 and at that time was “the only horse approximating
anything like the size in the Australian Colonies.
The “Woolpack” was in Grafton Street opposite the
“Coach and Horses.” George Topham was the landlord
in the forties. Apparently it lost its license in 1877 for an
advertisement appeared:
“Mr. Schofield is putting a new front to the old Woolpack,
which is to be used as a draper’s shop.”§
The “Yass and Collector” inn stood at the fork of the
roads of those names. John Lawler when he took it over
in 1864 described it then as a “well-known roadside house.”[|
Phillip Cahill was the previous licensee. John Tuchin had
it in 1880.

The “Builders 7 Arms’ ’ in Grafton Street still stands,
though long delicensed. The stables at the rear appear
to be older still. It was kept in the eighties by Chas.
Goode, father of the Railway officer whose prosecution in
recent times caused a considerable stir. The “Caledonian”
was kept by Alex Long in the forties. He was fined in
1848 for not keeping a lamp burning from sunset to sunrise.
It stood where Hollis and Coy’s chemist shop now is. It
was opened in 1847 and closed about 1855. In 1850 James
Summergreen took over the “Caledonian” from Alex. Long.
He advertised that he was still carrying on his trade as a
tin-plate maker and that he hoped to be equally successful
in his new duties as “Boniface in the above Hotel.”* The
“Carlton” in Sloane Street in 1867 was a one-storied humpy
with a bark roof. The landlord was Sam Pooley. In
1886 Arthur Denifray was advertising it freely. It has
been much rebuilt.
The special court appointed in 1911 to give effect to the
local option vote of that year met on the 3/5/1911. There
were then 31 hotels in Goulburn. The Court inspected
them, meeting daily until the 9/5/1911. The Cooma, Al-
bion, Federal City and the White Horse hotels were all
scheduled to lose their licenses.! In subsequent years the
number was reduced to thirteen.
Breweries.
Bradley’s Goulburn Brewery was established and built
by Wm. Bradley as a brewery, malt house and flour mill
in 1836.J The machinery was driven by a low pressure con-
densing engine of 28 h.p. manufactured by Maudsley, Son and
Field.§ Andrew Turnbull, who died in 1853, managed the
mill from 1838 to 1853. In 1845 the brewery was managed
by N. C. Phillips; the brewer was Blackshaw, father of
Major H. Blackshaw. On the death of Bradley the pro-
perty was purchased by Walford, Spark and Emanuel, who
continued the milling only. On the 13/10/1871 the “Goul-
burn Brewery, Mulwaree Ponds, Neville and Milne (late
Blackshaw)” announced to the inn-keepers of Goulburn

that they had reopened the brewery formerly conducted by
Blackshaw. In 1874 the property was sold to Bartlett and
Oddy, brewers. Oddy retired in 1878 and Bartlett con-
tinued. With the exception of a few years in the late
eighties Bartlett continued brewing until 1920 when he sold
out to Tooth and Coy. who discontinued brewing in Groul-
burn. Jane Waugh, writing to Ann Waugh, of her sons’
prospects in Goulburn in 1834 said:
“There is a Brewery building at the Mills, so if they will not
do one thing, they will make them do another.”*
Matt. Healy (1833) and John Richards (1838) are said
to have brewed beer at “Riversdale” and Blackshaw is said
to have been a brewer in Goulburn before he joined Brad-
ley. John Walton is said to have managed the brewery for
Mrs. Richards in 1839.
The Argyle Brewery was established by Edward Ken-
nedy about 1882. Kennedy was a native of Sacramento,
ho rrv- s k/)Tl ll \f T^ccctory
U.S.A. All about 1885 H. G. Chard became the owner and
continued the business. The brewery was in Faithfull
Street. Thorn’s brewery was built by George and Dan
Thorn in 1843. It stood on the banks of the Mulwaree near
the Towers, f The Wollondale Brewery stood near the weir.
It was established in 1880 and was owned by Farrell and
Gulson. It advertised it had “completed the erection of
a new brewery, ’’ in 1884. Farrell was the well-known poet.

The brewery turned out 4000 gallons of ale and porter a
week, l/2d per gallon wholesale, 2/- per gallon retail, bottled
ale at 6/- per dozen, porter 7/- per dozen. The brewery
was killed by the excise duties, the preferential railway rates
and the closing of the Peelwood, Captain’s Flat and Mount
Costigan mines. As late as 1898 the retail price of beer in
Goulburn was 3d a pint.*
The Federal Capital Commissioner, A. Oliver, and party
inspected Goulburn on the 26/2/1900. On the tour of in-
spection a halt was made at Bartlett’s brewery “where the
company was refreshed with drafts of beer and stout. The
Commissioner eulogised the brew.”f
Wine Shops.
Samuel Eirth had a "Wine and Beer” license for which
he obtained a renewal in 1849. Andy Newman had a wine
shop in the forties, it was licensed for colonial wine and
beer 4 Philip Dignam was in business in Market Street as
a wine and spirit merchant from the sixties. L. de V. Hunt
and Coy. date back to 1865 when Arthur M. Hunt obtained
a colonial wine license and began operations in the Old
Township. When the business of the city moved south-
wards the Hunts followed. § The picturesque wine gardens
which formerly stood at the corner of Auburn and Verner
Streets were established in 1903 by the McWilliams firm.||
In 1939 Wm. Blakeway built new premises next door. The
prolific grape vines which were such a feature of this corner
were destroyed in 1941.

CHAPTER XVIi.
PROFESSIONS.
EOM the earliest days the learned professions were
represented in Goulbnrn. In particular an astonish-
ingly large number of doctors settled here over 100
years ago. The first doctor in Goulburn was Dr. Andrew
Gibson who took up Tirranna in 1828. He does not appear
to have practised. There was however one occasion upon
which his services were required and that was in 1832 when
Governor Bourke’s horse fell and rolled on the Governor,
within three miles of Lieut. Putter’s home at Inverary. The
first doctor in the town itself was “Mr. Patrick Harnett,
assistant surgeon of the Medical Establishment. ’ ’ He was
here in 1836 with a salary of 10/- per day and a forage
allowance of 2/6. He was followed two years later by
Dr. Richardson.* David Waugh, writing to his sister in
1837, said:
“The people who have the appointment under the Government
of the Coronership are Mr. Stewart the Police Magistrate, an
old (? illegible) Clerk and Dr. Richardson, the Hospital Dr.
here, who came out in 1826 without a shilling and-he calls him-
self worth £SOOO now.”
Continuing about Dr. Richardson, David Waugh wrote:
“He is a Perth man but will not practice on any account....
The people are very ill off indeed for medical advice, they’re
obliged to go to the assistant at the Hospital.”!
In 1839 Dr. Emly appears on the scene, although it is
doubtful if he practised much. He had large squatting
interests in the Monaro and Gippsland. Robert Shaw Mont-
gomerie was assistant-surgeon at the Towrang Stockade in
1840. In 1850 he was at Berrima.j:
Two doctors arrived in 1840, Dr. Alfred Johnson Schom-
berg and Maurice O’Keefe Reedy, M.D. The next year the
name of Dr. Robert Marsden Cartwright appears. § In 1843
he and Dr. Yarnold are said to have opened an eye infirmary
in Verner Street. Dr. Cartwright is reputed to have per-
formed an operation in Goulburn, the first in the Colony,
for the cure of squinting, in 1841. His partner, Dr. Yar-
nold, was a noted surgeon. He is listed as residing in

Goulburn in 1843. He appears to have been an enterprising
citizen for he arranged a balloon ascent in Goulburn that
year. He died at the age of 39 on the 21/5/1850. He is
then described as “of Crookwell.” #
“A Macdonald, Surgeon etc.,” advertised that he could
be consulted at the Salutation Inn in 1849. f
Dr. John Gerard was “Medical Referee” in Goulburn
for the Australasian Colonial and General Life Assurance
and Annuity Company in 1848. He was practising as a
surgeon here in 1849. Dr. Waugh was announced as
“qualified to appear at Coroner’s inquests” by the N.S.W.
Medical Board in 1839. His first appearance in Goulburn
records is in 1848. He had his surgery in Market Street
in premises known as the “Medical Hall,” and now housing
the Goulburn Club. It was here that he invented and
manufactured the baking powder which still bears his name.
In 1869 he was appointed “Government Vaccinator.”^;
Considerable light on early conditions in Goulburn and
district is shed by the Waugh correspondence from 1834 to
1859. David Waugh’s letters are quoted elsewhere in this
history. Some were published in part in his “Three years’
practical experience of a settler in New South Wales.” The
rest are in MSS. in the Mitchell Library. There are letters
in the printed book which are not in the MSS. and there
are some in the MSS. not in the book. There is a letter
from John Waugh to his son Dr. Robert Waugh of the
21/10/1840 and one from Robert to his father of the
24/5/1851.
The “Medical Hall’ crops up all through Goulburn’s
history. An illustration of its appearance in the fifties,
shows it as standing on a corner block adjoining the “Sal-
utation Store.” This is difficult to understand because
the “Medical Hall’ which still stands certainly dates from
the forties but is not on a corner block. Nor has the “Sal-
utation Store” been identified. The inn of that name was
in Auburn Street, but the “Medical Hall’ is in Market
Street. Perhaps the building illustrated was never erected.
The “Medical Hall’ was “vacated by Dr. Davidson” in 1880
and was then occupied by the Savings Bank.§

Dr. Waugh had a penchant for goats. He would say
to a young mother “Do not give your child cow’s milk; get
a goat; they never get tuberculosis, look at the Highlanders,
the finest men in the world, reared on goats’ milk.” #
Dr. A. W. Hanford was practising from the forties until
1868.
Dr. Wm. Foxlow Hayley (born 1812, F.R.C.S., 1833),
began practice in Queanbeyan in 1836. He came to Goulburn
in 1868, purchasing the practice of Dr. Hanford. The next
year he advertised “Vaccination Daily.” Two years later
he moved from Clifford Street to Auburn Street where his
dispensary was in the building which, prior to and after
his occupation, was and is the “Hibernian” Hotel. In the
advertisement of his removal he described himself as “Sur-
geon and accoucheur, f His obituary notice contains some
extraordinary details, as e.g., that his life was insured for
£lOOO and that one of his patients, Mrs. Murray, wife of
T. A. Murray (afterwards Sir Terence ) had given him
£lOOO in appreciation of his skill, etc., and that the Loyal
Strangers’ Lodge had given him a substantial testimonial
over and above his fees.f Dr. Johnson was practising in
Lansdowne Terrace in the seventies. Dr. Perry advertised
in 1871 that he had discontinued “the Medical Club” and
could now be consulted at his own home. When Dr. Perry
began practising is not clear. He “resigned” in 1872 and
was succeeded by Dr. Davidson. Dr. S. M. Morton (the
elder) began practising at Payten’s Commercial Hotel in
1870. He left Goulburn for Grafton in 1876.
A presentation from the Oddfellows is described at con-
siderable length in the Goulburn papers. § There was no
false modesty or professional reticence about the doctors’
announcements or in the material they contributed to the
press fifty years ago. An account of an operation on a
woman prisoner at the gaol by Drs. Morton and Hayley
describes “the extent of the tumour” and “its nine years’
growth” and “its weight when removed.”|| Another runs:

“Two or three days since a lady who had been suffering from
a cancer in her cheek for a number of years called upon Dr.
Morton, who carefully removed it; and the person left his sur-
gery apparently much relieved. We refrain from giving the
name, as it would be against the lady’s wish to publish it.”*
Dr. Peter Hume Gentle (born 1839, M.D., Edinburgh
1862, M.R.C.S., England 1864), practised first in New Zea-
land for 12 months, then at Braidwood for 10 years, coming
to Goulburn in 1875. One of his advertisements read:
“Vaccination, Morowollen
Dr. Gentle will vaccinate children at Mr. Chapman’s Inn, Moro-
wollen, on Friday next, the 14th instant, from one to three
p.m.”t
Dr. Carroll announced his arrival thus:
“Mr. Walter J. Carroll, Physician and Surgeon, practises his
profession at Mr. Kerr’s Auburn Street, and at St. Clair Cot-
tage, Sloane Street, Goulburn.”
Dr. Harding succeeded Dr. Carroll in 18824
All these doctors had their own dispensaries, the fore-
runners of the modern chemists ’ shops. Some further
particulars of these establishments, “ businesses ” as they
were frankly called, will be found under the heading of
“Chemists” in the chapter on trade and commerce. Dr.
McKillop began practice in “Rogers’ buildings near the
railway station” (adjoining the present skating rink) on
the 22/5/1882. Later he was joined by his son (Drs. R. and
A. McKillop). The next year Dr. Gilman came. His
surgery too was at Kerr’s chemist shop.§
The last of the old-time medicoes was Dr. McMaster.
When he began practice in Goulburn, in partnership with
Dr. S. M. Morton, no professional propriety was outraged
at his publishing as an advertisement one and a half columns
of personal testimonials to his ability. Dr. G. L. Lawson
and Dr. Hollis were in partnership at the “Goulburn Dis-
pensary” in Auburn Street in 1895. Dr. Hollis later
represented Goulburn in parliament. Dr. Lawson was the
medical officer to the Imperial Bushman’s contingent in the
Boer War. 11 It is quite impossible to enumerate here all the
doctors who have practised in Goulburn since 1890, but the

foregoing are included is such detail as is available as the
pioneers of the medical profession in this city.
There were solicitors in Goulburn from the forties. Pro-
bably the first was John Ogle, who is mentioned as an
“Attorney-at-law’ ’ in Goulburn in 1849. * He was followed
by Daniel Henry Deniehy, who practised as an attorney in
the fifties. He resided in Sloane Street, opposite where the
police superintendent’s office is now.f C. H. Walsh was here
in the fifties too. He was the first mayor of Goulburn.
John Thomas Gannon was in practice in Goulburn from 1859
to 1885, at first in partnership with Scarvell and finally with
his son. He was twice mayor and also represented Argyle
in Parliament. His son, Henry Shuttleworth Gannon, was
also a solicitor and also mayor. He joined his father in
1880. He practised in Queensland for a while and returned
to Goulburn in 1883. A good story of C. H. Walsh is told
by MacAlister. Staying one night at a country hotel he
was shewn into a room having two beds, and selected one.
Meanwhile another traveller came along, and was shown
into the same room. He retired before Walsh and took his
bed. This was too much for Walsh who put on his spurs,
got into bed and began to apply the spurs to the snoring
stranger. The sleeper woke with a start and exclaiming
“I’m not in the habit of sleeping with a man who doesn’t
cut his toe-nails,” made for the other bed.J
Samuel Frey Blackmore was practising as a solicitor
in the fifties. Augustine Matthew Betts, solicitor, was coro-
ner, alderman and mayor and for very many years one of
Goulburn’s most prominent citizens. His old home “Eu-
thella” forms the central block of the Presbyterian Ladies’
College. N. Emanuel was practising in 1872. John David-
son began practising in 1876. He took E. W. Johnson into
partnership but some difficulties arose in consequence of
Davidson’s Davidson was sentenced to three
and a half years’ imprisonment. E. W. Johnson began
practice on his own account in 1895. Later he went into
partnership with A. E. Sendall. Sendall and McCarthy
were here in 1896. Sons of both original partners are now
members of the firm of Johnson and Sendall.

James Sinclair is described as an “architect” in 1843,
but the next year as a “builder.”* Whether he was pro-
fessionally qualified or not is uncertain. He designed several
buildings in Goulburn from 1846 to 1851 and as a builder
erected them from his own plans. The “St. Clair” Cottage
and “Ardgowan” are amongst his outstanding achievements.
A further note on his work will be found under the heading
of “builders” in the chapter on “Commerce and Industry.”
Edmund Thomas Blacket (Sydney) was government
architect. He designed the Sydney University, St. And-
rew’s Cathedral, Sydney, and other important buildings.
In Goulburn he designed St. Saviour’s Cathedral, St. Sav-
viour’s Church Hall, St. Nicholas’, North Goulburn, and
other lesser buildings. His son, Cyril Blacket, completed
St. Saviour’s Cathedral from his father’s plans. W. A. G.
Brander wrote that his father was an architect in the fifties
and designed the first “Sky-scraper” in Goulburn. Pre-
sumably this was the first three-storied building in Auburn
Street but it cannot be identified now.f
Thomas Rowe (Sydney) was responsible for some work
in Goulburn as, e.g., the old hall of the Mechanics’ Institute.
His son, Percival C. K. Rowe, practised in Goulburn in the
eighties. T. W. Parrott was here for a number of years.
The three-storied building in Auburn Street, built by W. S.
Foxall, is an example of his somewhat limited ideas. When
the late W. S. Foxall’s premises were built in Auburn Street
in 1883, the “Penny Post” devoted two columns to a eulogy
of them and the same were opened with a public function.
The architect, Parrott, described his achievement as “Doric
in style,” but the Rev. G. M. D’Arcy Irvine, who was at the
banquet, doubted “whether it was Gothic, the cyclopean,
the Moorish, Grecian,.... Doric, lonic, Corin-
thian or Latin order ” In matters of taste he was in
advance of his time 4
Henry Oswald Bell did some work in Goulburn. The
former Oddfellows’ Hall, now part of the Empire Theatre,
was his. J. W. Hill and A. J. Wehlow were advertising in
1888. They did nothing outstanding. McKinnon and

Weitzel of Sydney and Gonlbnrn were practising in Goul-
burn in the nineties. They prepared plans for a large
“Theatre Royal” to be built in Montague Street, alongside
the London Bank. A public company was formed to finance
it but nothing came of the proposals. Two Italians, Chas.
Spadacini and Andrea Stombuco, were responsible for the
designs of most of the older Roman Catholic buildings in
Goulburn. Stombuco was diocesan architect and designed
SS. Peter and PauPs Cathedral. His proportions were
better than his details.
The card of E. C. Manfred, senior partner of Manfred
and Son, appears in 1880.* His happiest effort was the
Goulburn Town Hall, a very satisfactory building in the
Queen Anne style. Half a century afterwards it was ex-
tended considerably from designs by his son, H. C. Manfred.
H. C. Manfred designed the Anglican Children’s Home.
Rogers’ “Great Arcade,” the premises now occupied by R.
D. Gray and Sons, were opened in 1879. The general scheme
was designed by the late Chas. Rogers. H. 0. Bell was the
architect. Even the “Herald” was constrained to remark
that “its appearance is not a pleasing one.”t
That was sixty years ago and except for the removal
of its tower, new windows and a coat of paint, it remains
to-day much the same. W. F. Preshaw was practising as
an architect in Montague Street in 18924 It is not known
what buildings in Goulburn he erected.
For many years Goulburn was dependent upon visiting
dentists, many of them quacks. One of the earliest resident
dentists was Longfield, (mentioned elsewhere in this history),
who had his surgery in Sloane St., near the old hospital. In
1874 large displayed (illustrated) advertisements appeared
of J. Lugg.§ An advertising visiting dentist in 1882 de-
scribed himself as “Professor Russell, Dental Surgeon and
Gold Medallist for Haircutting.”H Displayed advertisements
and puff paragraphs appeared for several issues in the
“Goulburn Herald” in 1879 of a “Professor Dunlop” and
his ability to cure “ingrowing toe nails.” As he was in
Goulburn for some little while and did not vary his ad-
vertisements, it almost suggests an epidemic. He also

“extracted teeth without causing pain.”* Miss C. Hirsch
was practising in Goulburn as a “surgical and mechanical
dentist” in 1889.f The first dentist in Goulburn of the
modern professional standard was E. C. Bryden, who came
to Goulburn in 1885 and practised here for 22 years. At
the time of his death he was president of the Odontological
Society. He was a good citizen, an active worker for the
Presbyterian Church, the Liedertafel, an alderman, president
of the hospital for many years, taking a prominent part in
the work of the Highland Society, the Technical College and
the Tirranna Race Club. He died in Goulburn, in his 51st
year, on the 18/6/1907. Several well-known dentists of
later years, as e.g., Whitlow and Finn, trained under him.J
The first licensed surveyor in Goulburn was Arthur
Zouch, brother of Captain Henry Zouch. He died on the
11/2/1880.§ George Martyr (born Greenwich, England,
1819) came to this district as superintendent of the Mac-
arthur’s estate, Richlands, Taralga, in 1847. About 1860
he began practice in Goulburn as a surveyor and land agent.
He was secretary to the Volunteer Corps for many years and
an alderman of the city. The saleyards were planned by
him. He died on the 4/9/1881. || George Gibson Donaldson
also practised in the eighties.
The earliest mention of a veterinary surgeon in Goulburn
is probably that of the death of John Barber “horse
doctor” on the 1/3/1841. Another early veterinary was
known as “Skippy.” A. W. Taylor, who had a shop in
Auburn Street, near Knowlman’s Corner, was also known
as “the horse doctor” in the fifties. H. Hudson, veterinary
surgeon, advertised that his “diploma” was dated May,
1861.**
A. A. Kerr, the chemist, advertised that he might be
“consulted gratuitously on all Diseases of Animals.” Alter-
natively he was prepared to make up the prescriptions of
“Vets, holding certificates, or of ‘quacks ’ or of farriers.”ff

The nursing profession was first represented by the
midwife. A Mrs. Teece is mentioned in 1843. One of the
earliest midwives was Mrs. Peters who in 1848 “thanked
her numerous patrons for their liberal support.” She ad-
vertised as a “ ladies nurse ’ ’ but' was prepared to turn an
honest penny in other directions for her card went on to
say that she “begs to notify them that she is prepared to
clean and turn ladies’ bonnets for 1/6. ” # Maria Kendall
described herself as a “sic nurse” in 1852. Maria Tindale
and Ellen Pitty were nurses in 1855 and 1856 respectively.!
Mrs. Munoz, whose husband is referred to in two other
chapters, advertised as a midwife from 1873. She died at
the age of 98 in 1919. She arrived on the third immigrant
ship to reach New South Wales, t The forerunner of the
modern nursing home was “the Dora Nursing and Con-
valescent Home,” at Garfield, conducted by Mrs. Guille, at
one time matron of the Goulburn Hospital. She advertised
that she was “the holder of the Military Red Cross medal
for the Cootamundra Railway accident.” Her home was
opened on the 21/7/1888. § Subsequently she moved to
Bourke Street.

CHAPTER XVIII.
PUBLIC UTILITIES.
HE following notes on banks, building societies, in-
surance offices and other public utilities will be found
to bear on the history of the city as well as having
interest of their own.
The recognised mode of launching any new financial
venture such as an insurance, investment or building society
in the sixties and seventies was by a public lecture. Some
of these were very good as, e.g., Dean Sowerby’s lecture of
the 28/7/1863 on life assurance which was reprinted 74
years afterwards by the A.M.P. Society. It was originally
printed by the "Herald Steam Press Goulburn.” Others
were unconsciously funny. One such was a lecture on
"Mutual Life Assurance” given by A. Boggis in 1871. It
was advertised by a harrowing poem on the plight of widows
and orphans with special reference to a recent fatal accident.
The "Sons of Temperance” were specially exhorted to at-
tend and to invest the sums saved from "nobblers.” The
Goulburn agent of the Australian Mutual Provident Society
in 1850 was Hugh P. Poison. It was not until 1860 that the
A.M.P. Society appointed its first canvasser for new business.
Before that date the Society relied for business on the ad-
vocacy of its directors, the dissemination of literature and
the efforts of local agents. There was no agent in Goulburn
but there was a medical referee (Dr. Waugh) in 1856. In
1863 Isaac Fox, who lived at Run-of-Water, was appointed
the Society’s Goulburn agent. Fox was also the agent of
the "Imperial Fire Insurance Coy.”* In 1870 Dr. Hayley
was the medical referee. In 1879 D. J. McLeod was
appointed southern district agent. In 1881 the Society
erected premises in Montague Street from designs by E. C.
Manfred. The opening was the occasion of a big public
function. About 1890 the local officer was called "District
Secretary” instead of "Agency Clerk.” The name was
altered to "District Manager” in 1917. The present pre-
mises in Auburn Street stand on the site where once Geo.
Adams, the founder of TattersalPs Sweeps, had his butcher’s
shop and conducted his first modest "consultations.” These

premises were designed by Wright and Apperly and were
opened by Sir Alfred Meeks on the 9/3/1928. The sculp-
ture on the facade was the work of W. P. Macintosh, who
40 years earlier was responsible for much of the carving
in St. Saviour’s Cathedral. In 1873 there were 238 policies
on the Goulburn books and the sum assured was £104,975.
In 1938 there were 5035 policies and the sum assured was
£2,422,276. The annual premiums in 1873 in Goulburn were
£3669, in 1938, £68,961. The following agents, agency clerks
and district managers have been stationed in Goulburn:
1850, Hugh P. Poison; 1863, Isaac Fox; 1879, D. J. McLeod;
1883, C. J. Nutter; 1885, J. F. Urquhart; 1886, J. McCredie;
1887, G. B. L. Lowe; 1889, W. A. Macdonald; 1912, W. H.
Leak; 1936, A. W. Cains.*
The late C. J. McShane wrote a fascinating little article
in 1918 on the genesis of Starr-Bowkett societies. He said:
“In the City of Goulburn and surrounding districts there are
hundreds of people, in possession of their own cottages and
farms who otherwise would be paying rent, and who have to
thank for this their membership in the Argyle-Starr Bowkett
Society .”t
The first Building Society in Goulburn was the “Argyle
Provident Benefit and Investment Society” which was
operating in the sixties of last century. Theophilus Kirke,
who is mentioned elsewhere in this history in several con-
nections, was its secretary. The office of the society was
at “Mr. Newbury’s.”t The “Goulburn Permanent Mutual
Building and Investment Society” was functioning in the
seventies. J. T. Gannon was its chairman and John Jessop
the secretary. It amalgamated with the “Southern Build-
ing Society” of which A. W. Bullen was manager in 1884.§
The “Southern Permanent Mutual Building Land and
Investment Society” had its offices in Clinton Street. Phillip
G. Myers was its secretary. R. C. Joplin, E. Twynam and
Wm. Gale were the trustees in 1884. The “Southern Build-
ing, Mortgage and Investment Coy. Ltd.” was formed in
1887 to take over the business of the “Southern Permanent
Mutual Building Land and Investment Society.” Isaac
Shepherd was its chairman. The paid up capital was £5300
equal to 10/- per share. Dividends from 8 per cent, to 10

per cent, were paid and the profits for eight years totalled
£3054. In 1893 the company got into difficulties. It was
then decided to call up the uncalled capital. ||
The first Starr-Bowkett Society in Goulburn was formed
at a Public Meeting convened for that purpose in 1911. It
was called the Goulburn District Starr-Bowkett Society No.
I and Charles Gardner was appointed secretary. Captain
McShane started the Argyle Ballot and Sale Society in
opposition to the above and his son, Aubrey McShane is now
the liquidator of the Argyle Sections No. 1, 2 and 3. Alan
Christie, secretary of the Goulburn District Society in 1920,
formed a sister society known as the Werriwa and Goulburn
District Starr-Bowkett Society, both being under the same
directorship. In 1927 Albert Schuch was appointed
secretary of both the Goulburn and District and the Wer-
riwa Societies, and has since completed the liquidation of
the former which disbursed £3IOO profit amongst its mem-
bers. The latter society is still carrying on and in a very
sound position.
The Argyle Societies Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are in the process of
liquidation and the No. 4 is functioning under the secretary-
ship of L. C. Manfred. Altogether it is estimated that the
Starr-Bowkett Societies in Goulburn have advanced to mem-
bers a sum exceeding £350,000. Another type of society
started in 1937 in Goulburn under the name of the Goulburn
Homes and Building Society Ltd., is one of the many spon-
sored by the State Government. P. O. Ford is its secretary.*
Contrary to general tradition and some written history, the
first bank in Goulburn was a branch of the Commercial
Banking Company of Sydney, which had, by 1837, estab-
lished four country branches at Maitland, Windsor, Goul-
burn and Melbourne. John O'Sullivan, its manager, bought
two allotments in Goulburn on 11th and 12th of August,
1836. One was lot 15 of section 6 in Clifford Street the other
lot 12 of the same section, at the corner of Bourke and
Clifford Streets. Apparently O'Sullivan was preparing for
what was to be his thirty years' residence in Goulburn. In
1843 the Commercial Bank Office instructed its Goulburn
agency to charge 5 per cent, on orders on private individuals

under £5. A fortnight later the Goulburn correspondent
of the “Sydney Morning Herald” reported that there were
rumours of an attack on “Mr. O’Sullivan’s Bank.” He
added however “But it is widely known he has defensive
weapons on hand. ”§
All country branches of the Commercial Bank were
closed on the 31/3/1844. That of Melbourne had been
closed a little earlier. Country branches of this bank do
not appear again until the years 1859/60 when branches were
opened at a number of country centres with the exception
of Goulburn which was earlier, 1853. The following is an
account of the closing of the Goulburn branch of the Com-
mercial Banking Company in 1844:
“The ensuing year, 1841, appears to have been a turning point
in the career of the old Commercial Banking Company. Very
gradually, but in a steady, though small, stream, business began
to fall off. Then the depression of 1842/4 ensued, and in the
middle of that disastrous period, in 1843, as the volume of trade
was now much diminished and at least two of the country branches
were being worked at a loss, the board gave instructions that all
of them should be closed from the 31st March, 1844; a decision
which greatly aroused the ire of the good folk of Goulburn,
who forcibly impressed upon the directors their objection to a
reversion to the system of ‘carrying on business per medium
of dirty, unreadable slips of paper as a circulating medium
when the Commercial Bank’s branch for seven years, without
losses by robbery, had directly, or indirectly, through local bills
being sent down on (sic) expenses limited to the salary of the
agent.’ But the board strongly imbued with the wisdom of a
stay-at-home policy, remained obdurate.”*
The name of John O’Sullivan appears from 1834/36 as
a clerk or teller in the Bank of Australia at Sydney. In
1837 he appears as the agent of the Commercial Banking
Coy of Sydney at Goulburn. f From the fact that after the
Commercial Bank was closed in 1844 “Mr. O’Sullivan’s
Bank” continued to be mentioned in advertisements sug-
gests that he continued to transact banking business on his
own account. £ This seems to be the more reasonable sup-
position in that when in 1853 the Commercial Banking Coy.
re-opened John O’Sullivan was again appointed its manager.
The bank’s own records show the Goulburn branch as open-
ing on the 22/3/1853. However, the notice stating that the
branch was opened appears three days before that. It read:

“Commercial Bank
Goulburn Agency opened—resumed under charge of Mr. John
O’Sullivan. By order of the Directors:
Sydney 15/3/1853. John Taylor, Manager. ”$
A reference to the fact that O’Sullivan had previously
conducted a banking business in his own premises in Sloane
Street was made by a writer in 1897 who said:
“It was afterwards converted into the Commercial Bank with
Mr. O’Sullivan as manager.”||
Additional evidence of this is found in the fact that
when on the 17/10/1851, Frederick Thomas Moore of Baw
Baw bought 4 tons of flour from Wm. Bradley he gave
Bradley a

An order book of F. T. Moore’s on John O’Sullivan was
used by him during the years that the Commercial Bank was
closed. It is worded exactly like a cheque book and the
butts contain such entries as:
“No. 3. No. 27.

No. 85 is made out to '‘bearer.” There are 81 butts
in all from the 7/6/1851 to the 13/12/1852.*
A brass plate inscribed "Commercial Bank, Mr. John
O’Sullivan, Manager,” was lying around in the present pre-
mises until recent years. It seems to have disappeared.
I he bank was also conducted in the building, now a fruit
shop, opposite the station. The branch is said to have been
conducted for a while in the house built for W. Bradley and
which after much alteration and rebuilding is now Tatter-
sail’s Hotel, f This seems to be a little doubtful. The bank
built its own premises in 1859, a large two-storey building,
with verandahs and balconies, on the corner of Auburn and
Verner Streets. The manager’s residence was over the
banking chamber. The building was entirely remodelled
and the front portion rebuilt in 1919, and the upper floor
converted into business offices. The granite pillars to the
main entrance came from J. Turner and Sons’ Marulan

quarry. At the time of the re-opening of the branch in
1853 the railway terminus was at Mittagong and all cash,
etc., had to be transported by coach at considerable risk
from bushrangers. The managers of the branch have been:
1853, John O’Sullivan; 1867, H. H, Paige; 1868, R. C. Joplin
(there is a memorial to him in St. Saviour’s Cathedral);
1894, J. G. Beazley; 1896, W. A. Gardiner ; 1919, E. H. C.
Wood; 1920, D. D. Tait; 1922, Y. W. Ryrie; 1933, A. L. Fell;
1934, J. E. F. Lloyd. Amongst the first clients of the bank
were Wm. Pitt Faithfull, Andrew Gibson, Wm. Chisholm,
Chas. Cowper, A. G. de Lauret, Chas Gillespie, Duncan
Ranken, Francis R. L. Rossi (who in 1883 used his account
to transfer into his own name the West Goulburn Glebe
compensation moneys, one of the matters in the famous
Goulburn Cathedral dispute), and Henry Zouch, who was
in charge of the police at the Lambing Flat riots.
Another client of those earlier days was “Peter” de-
scribed as a “Chinaman or a Tartar.Overtures were
made in 1849
“by a Sydney bank to a highly respectable and influential in-
habitant to open a Banking business with a promise of unlimited
support. The rumour of Mr. Sheriff Young’s intention to start
in Goulburn as a Banker is contradicted....”!
It seems that the next bank in Goulburn was something
in the nature of a private bank for in 1850 Levy Mandelson
and S. Emanuel advertised that at No. 8 Mandelson’s Build-
ings their “new Banking Establishment was complete
and will be opened on the 7/10/1850. All business will
be treated in a liberal manner.” Careful search has revealed
nothing more of this institution or its functions. In the
thirties S. Emanuel and N. Mandelson both appear variously
described as dealers and slop sellers in Lower George Street,
Sydney. In 1839 Nathan Mandelson is listed as the land-
lord of the “Hit or Miss” inn at Bungonia.
Samuel Emanuel, snr. and Nathan Mandelson were both
in Goulburn in the forties and fifties and were both gold-
buyers. Mandelson was a very large buyer of gold from
the Braidwood, Turon and other diggings, and journeyed
to them for that purpose. Emanuel used to buy gold at
his Auburn Street store. In view of the extent of Mandel-
son’s purchases, sometimes thousands of pounds worth at

a time, it seems as if he were acting for some syndicate which
perhaps included Emanuel.^
The Goulburn “Herald” announced in 1853 that
“The Union Bank, recently formed is actually opening a branch
in Goulburn. This increases the local opinion of the rising
importance of Goulburn as a future city.”
The Bank itself advertised that it was open for business
in “temporary quarters” in Auburn Street, “G. Ferguson,
acting manager.” At one time it was in the house built
for W. Bradley, now TattersalFs Hotel. Later it was in
Dodd’s buildings, now the Great Southern Hotel, then in
Fraser’s buildings, now part of Knowlman’s store. In 1862
the branch was closed. It never reopened here.§
The Bank of New South Wales opened in Goulburn in
1863 upon the site of the “Horse and Jockey Inn.” It is
possible that the shed at the back of the present bank is
part of that hotel. W. Roberts was the first manager.
This bank was burnt down on the 31/10/1874. The bank
was in no hurry to rebuild but leased premises “at Mr.
Nash’s Hotel next door.” The Municipal Council protested
about the unsafe condition of the ruins as did the local press.
Its second premises (part of which still stands) were built
in 1877, at a cost of £5/6000. Mansfield Brothers of Sydney
were the architects and F. Horn the builder. The “New,”
i.e., the second bank, was opened on the 8/2/1878. The
premises were reconstructed and largely rebuilt in 1932.
The contractors were Lipscombe and Price of Bowral, the
architects John Reid and Son of Sydney.* The Australian
Joint Stock Bank began operations in 1853 with “Cohen
and Solomon, Waterloo Stores, opposite the jail in Auburn
Street” as local agents. A branch of the bank was opened
in Goulburn at the lower end of Market Street in 1859. f In
1880 it moved to its second premises, formerly Butler’s store
and now the Railway Institute. When as the Australian
Bank of Commerce it was absorbed by the Bank of New
South Wales, the Market Street branch was closed. Sub-
sequently the Bank of New South Wales opened an agency

in the Colonial Mutual Buildings, Clifford Street, in 1939,
later this was transferred to Auburn Street North.
A very large number of the Bank’s earlier constituents
were “marksmen,” i.e., illiterate. The Bank got over the
difficulty by entering a description in the signature book,
e.g., “31 years, 5 feet 10 inches high, Sandy beard and
moustache.”
The following have been the managers of the Bank of
New South Wales, the Australian Joint Stock Bank, the
Australian Bank of Commerce and the City Bank of Sydney,
in Goulburn:

The Australian Banking Company had a branch in Goul-
burn. The bank failed in 1892 and was finally wound up
in 1914. On the 15/7/1892, thirty-nine of its Goulburn de-
positors elected a committee to act in concert with the Syd-
ney Vigilance Committee.!
The Bank of Australasia opened in Goulburn on the
15/4/1890, its first manager was C. W. Bell. At first it was
housed in Fraser’s Buildings (now the hardware department
of Knowlman’s store). The City Bank also occupied part
of this building. The Bank of Australasia’s present build-
ings were erected in 1905 and opened on the 10/7/1906. The
architects were Warded and Denning. King and Arm-
strong were the builders. C. M. Shaw, in later years the
author of “Bernard’s Brethren,” and the founder of the
Goulburn Golf Club, was its best known manager (from 1896
to 1914)4

The Oriental Bank Corporation had a branch in Goul-
bnrn. It was opened “opposite the Royal Hotel” with
W. H. Freeman as manager. It suspended payment and
closed its branches on the 3/5/1884. A few people in Goul-
burn knew the evening before and made hurried efforts to
unload its bank notes on the unsuspecting. One genius
shammed sickness, went round to the doctor, got a bottle
of medicine and paid him a £5 note, receiving £4/12/6
change. Another rushed into an hotel and asked for change
of a fiver. The barmaid was in the know and gave him five
£1 notes of the Oriental Bank.§
The London Chartered Bank of Australia opened in
Goulburn in the 20/3/1888. ||
The first manager of the branch was Frederick Jordon
Curtis who was afterwards secretary of that institution in
London. Its second premises at the corner of Auburn and
Montague Streets, now occupied by the English, Scottish and
Australian Bank Ltd., are distinguished by the solidity and
finish of its interior fittings. Its original signature book
has been the source of much of the information in this
history, especially the section dealing with early mining
syndicates.
The English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank
was first established in Goulburn in 1881, in temporary pre-
mises in Montague Street adjoining the A.M.P. Society. The
building, which still stands, was erected in 14 days by L.
le Breton. It is not a credit to its builders or the city.
The first manager was Jas. Henderson, the teller Stutchbury.
Its present premises were built by the London Bank and
were opened by the Mayor on the 12/11/1889. Oakden,
Addison and Kemp of Melbourne, were the architects, and
George Dalton of Goulburn the contractor. The total cost,
exclusive of the site, was £B5OO. #
The Savings Banks in Goulburn have one hundred years
of history behind them. Although there is only one now,
the Commonwealth, the earlier two played an important
part in the life of the community. The following were ap-
pointed trustees of the Savings Bank for Goulburn and
district in 1838:
§ “Sthn. Argus,” 6/5/1884. et seq. || “E.P.P.,” 20/3/1888.
* Gbn. “Herald,” 30/8/1881, et seq. 4/12/1888.


“G. Stewart, Goulburn; A. Chisholm, Tirranna; F. N.
Eossi, Eossiville; W. Eichardson, Goulburn; W. Bradley,
Lansdowne.”
The bank was open at the police office on Tuesdays
only from 12 to 1 p.m. This was a branch of the Savings
Bank of N.S.W., for in 1840 it was advertised:
“Branch Savings Banks have been established at Parramatta,
Windsor, Bathurst, Maitland, Goulburn, Illawarra and Camp-
belltown; which are conducted on the same principles as the
Sydney Branch and Depositors in the former, receive the same
interest as Depositors in the latter.”
The establishment of the Goulburn branch of the Sav-
ings Bank of New South Wales has been given as 1840, but
this is obviously a mistake. The Government Savings Bank
was established here in 1852. f
The Savings Bank was “reopened’ ’ on the 1/1/1852
with E. B. Kitson, E. Waugh, J. Gerard, Eev. Wm. Eoss and
Wm. Chatfield as trustees and E. Craig as accountant. The
first depositor was Mary Hartneady, house servant, at the
Parsonage, Goulburn, who made her mark. It advertised
“specially for gold diggers in and around Goulburn and for
the happiness of the working classes.’ ’ On the front page
of the 1852 ledger is the note in pencil:
“Notice
Original Duplicate
Stolen from the House
of Rev. W. Sowerby.”
The Eev. Wm. Eoss, Dr. Waugh, C. E. Newcombe, F.
Oakes, the Eev. W. Sowerby, C. H. Walsh, E. Craig, W.
Conolly, Eev. C. M. Betts and the Eev. Eichard Walsh all
appear from 1853 to 1857 as agents. Soon after this the
bank was removed to the Court House. In 1871 it moved
from the Court House to the Mechanics’ Institute, opening
on Mondays and Thursdays from 4to 5 pm. In 1891 it was
in Market Street, still opening for the same hours.*
This bank was commonly known as the “Barrack
Street” Bank. A branch of the Government Savings Bank
was opened on the 1/10/1907 in Auburn Street, with E. C.
Stevenson as manager. About 1912 the Commonwealth Sav-
ings Bank had an agency at the Post Office. In 1923 the

“Barrack Street” and the “Government” Savings Bank
amalgamated and some years later a splendid new building
was erected in Montague Street. In 1931 after the Lang
crisis the Commonwealth Savings Bank absorbed the N.S.W.
Savings Banks and the Montague Street premises were dis-
carded, the Savings Bank business being conducted at the
Commonwealth Bank in Auburn Street.
The Goulburn Penny Bank was functioning in the
sixties. Dean Sowerby was the first trustee, and was joined
later by F. R. L. Rossi and then J. Longfield.
The City Bank opened next door to the Bank of Aus-
tralasia, opposite the Royal Hotel in 1891. H. H. Scarr
was its temporary manager. It amalgamated with the
Australian Bank of Commerce in 1918. The managers of
the A.J.S., the A.B.C. and the City Bank are given under
the heading of the Bank of New South Wales. The National
Bank opened here in 1929. E. B. Carter was the first
manager. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a sub-
stantial sand-stone building, stands on the site of a skittle
alley conducted by a man named Watson. #
The Commonwealth Bank was opened on the 11/8/1925
by E. C. Norrie as manager with a staff of three, in premises
leased from the Farquhar Estate and now occupied by
Steele’s grocery business in Auburn Street. In 1930 the
site on which the Bank now stands was purchased from John
Knowlman and the building at present occupied erected
thereon, from designs by the Commonwealth Architect’s De-
partment. In 1932 the Government Savings Bank of N.S.W.
was taken over by the Commonwealth Bank. The staff
now consists of the manager and 15 officers. Negotiations
for the purchase of the adjoining premises, occupied by C.
Waugh Pty. Ltd., were completed in 1940. Building opera-
tions to enlarge the premises to give a total frontage of
approximately 54 feet have, however, been postponed until
after the war.f
The Rural Bank of N.S.W. stands in Auburn Street on
the site of the old Bridge Hotel. The plan, drawn by the
Bank’s architect makes provision for the future extension
of the banking chamber. The branch was opened for
business in 1937 under the managership of C. Mcßeath.

The Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd., opened in
Goulburn on the 7/11/1928. The managers have been:
C. C. George, 7/3/1928 to 25/10/1928; W. F. Noonan,
25/10/1928 to 25/3/1931; K. F. Dowden, 25/3/1931 to
6/12/1934; D. B. Fargher, 6/12/1934 to 11/8/1938, and E. A.
Barnes from 11/8/19384
A public meeting was held on the 29/4/1878 to “con-
sider the advisability of having a company established
within the bounds of the municipality for the supply of gas
for the residents. ’ ’ Prospects were stated at ‘ ‘ 128 customers
burning 872 lights averaging three hours per night. ” A
previous attempt had fallen through; 1200 shares were ap-
plied for at the meeting. Another 1550 were subscribed for
within two days. The prospectus gave the capital at £3OOO
in £1 shares. Gas was to be made from coal (Berrima)
and was to be retailed at 15/- per thousand cubic feet. John
Jessop was the provisional secretary. The first meeting of
the company was held on the 13/5/1878. Only part of the
town was to be lit and that part did not include Bourke
Street or its places of worship. The plant arrived from
England on the “Madeira' ’ at the end of that year.
On the 1/11/1879 Goulburn was lit by gas for the first
time. Wm. Davies, the mayor, lit the first street lamp,
whereupon the Concordia Band struck up “Nancy Lee."
Of the business premises
“Amongst the most brilliantly lighted were the premises of
Messrs. Wood and Co., C. Rogers, G. Gregory and Wm. Butler,
the number of jets alight and the chaste and elegant chandeliers
in the shop of the latter gentleman being perhaps the best
display in the city.”
In 1880 the company reported that gas was laid on to
the railway station, the corporation lamps, two of the
churches, the hospital and the principal buildings in the
city, 100 customers in all. E. C. Manfred was appointed
secretary in 1881. The Gas Company has continued to
exercise its useful function for 60 years. Its profits were,
of course, limited by legislation. In its early days there
were several moves to purchase its franchise for the citizens.
The question has not been raised in recent years. In Feb-
ruary, 1941, the Gas Supply Coy. Ltd. of Melbourne, offered
to take over the City of Goulburn Gas Coy. Ltd. The terms
provided for the issue to the shareholders of the Goulburn
X Memo. C.8.A., 4/11/1941.


Company of one fully paid ordinary share of £1 in the Mel-
bourne Coy. for every share in the Goulburn Company.
Alternatively the Gas Supply Coy. offered to pay £1 in cash
for every Goulburn share. $
Moving pictures made their first appearance in Sydney
about 38 years ago. In 1911 W. J. Nicholson came to
Goulburn and announced that he would show pictures
nightly. This he did in the old Oddfellows’ Hall. Nichol-
son died in 1919 and the old Empire Theatre, as it was re-
named, was carried on by his widow for about eight or nine
years. At this time pictures were being shown at the
Empire (former Oddfellows) the Lyric (the Mechanics’ In-
stitute) the Broadway (formerly Marcus Clark’s) and at the
Majestic (a short lived venture on the corner of Verner and
Sloane Streets, now a garage). The Majestic was a stadium
for a while too (Goulburn Amusements Syndicate). The
“Empire” amalgamated with the “Broadway” and a com-
pany was formed “Goulburn Theatres, Ltd.,” which erected
on the Empire site a new theatre seating 2400 people. The
old theatre became the foyer to the new. In 1936 Hoyts
Ltd. built the “Ritz” which for the present is the last word
in Goulburn picture theatres. It was opened on October
27th, 1936.
Goulburn’s Broadcasting Station, 2GN, was first mooted
in 1930. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd., manu-
factured and installed the equipment. The station began
operations on the 17/12/1931. It was “opened” formally
by Brig.-Gen. McNicoll on the 25/1/1932. At first the
station was on the air for six hours a day only. 2GN. is
now owned by the Goulburn Broadcasting Company Pty.
Ltd., a subsidiary company of Amalgamated Wireless (Aus-
tralasia) Ltd. The studios are at 209 Auburn Street and
River Road. The transmitter is at River Road at the corner
of what was formerly the Old Bishopthorpe Estate. The
operating power is 200 watts and the wave length 216
metres. The daily transmission hours are now from 7 a.m.
until 10.30 p.m.*
The Goulburn and District Tourist Bureau sponsored
by the Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Council
had only a short career. J. A. Mahoney was its secretary.!

CHAPTER XIX.
CULTURAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL ORGANISATIONS.
T is impossible now to compile a complete list of all the
cultural societies and social organisations which have
existed in Goulburn over the last 100 years. Some,
still existing, are of respectable antiquity. Others flourished
for a while and then faded out. For many their only
record is in the advertising columns of the newspapers. In
point of time the drama first engaged the attention of Goul-
burn’s citizens.
The first amateur dramatic society was formed in 1844.
Its theatres were a room at the “Commercial Hotel” and
the ball room at the “Harp.” Scenery was painted by
Jack Holland, and Sam Davis gave the curtains. Robert
and Lachlan McGowan and John McKenna played the female
parts. W. Simmons, Postmaster and his son were in the
company. The repertoire included “The Vampire or the
Bride of the Isles,” “The Spectre Bridegroom,” Eugene
Aram,” “The Mistletoe Bough,” etc.*
John Horton wrote of those early performances:
“It was there (i.e., the Harp Hotel) that my uncle, Locky
McGowan, first started in the theatrical profession, by holding
amateur performances, with the assistance of others, in the
‘Harp’ Hotel. At the time it was the largest room in Goul-
burn.”!
Lachlan McGowan wrote his reminiscences of these days
in 1898. He said he appeared as an amateur in 1847. He
and Robert McGowan jumped an old store on the site of
Rogers’ and gave a free entertainment. The owner of the
premises was most incensed. They then moved to Wm.
Hollis’ blacksmith’s shop (then Ben Gould’s). One of their
party was J. T. Walker, afterwards a saddler but then only
an apprentice. He told the story of Walker’s employer
falling through the roof and in the subsequent scuffle Mac-
beth having to complete his performance with a bleeding
nose. Lachlan McGowan himself broke his apprenticeship
and ran away to become a professional. He and his wife
returned as professional entertainers “eleven years after-
wards” (1874). Later Jack Holland, James J. Kennedy
* “E.P.P.,” 3/9/1898.
t “E.P.P.,” 3/10/1922,


and Sydney McGowan left the amateur stage for the pro-
fessional.*
The Goulburn Herald” in 1848 published some recom-
mendations for future amateur theatricals, employing local
talent, suggesting that these should be in aid of the Goul-
burn Hospital and that they would serve "to break the
monotony of country life.” The suggestion bore early
fruit. On the 19/6/1849 the "Goulburn Amateur Theatre”
presented "The Mistletoe Bough,” the first act of "Hamlet”
and the "Spectre Bridegroom.” Prices were 1/6 and 1/-,
the performance was at the "Harp” and the proceeds were
for the Hospital, f
J. D. Rockfeller was corner man in a Christy Minstrel
show at the Mechanics ' Institute in the early sixties when
he was called home, "his father having struck oil.”}
Messrs. Boulanger and Coulon, members of the Irish
prima donna Catherine Hayes ' company, visited Goulburn
and gave a concert in 1854. Boulanger was a pianist and
Coulon a baritone. Ale-Ben-Sou-Alle, a novelty musician,
gave a concert in the Goulburn Hotel the following year.
A "Mr. W. Radcliffe, the Australian Paganini” performed
here in 1873. His repertoire included:
“Solos on the violin: ‘Home, Sweet Home’ with variations;
Imitations of the Hurdy Gurdy, Bag-pipes, Hens cackling, Calves
bellowing, Children crying, the Drunken Cobbler, The Parson in
the Pulpit, and lastly smashing his fiddle—an act UNPRE-
CEDENTED ”$
Ghiloni and Company's waxworks visited Goulburn in
1878 and exhibited at the Mechanics' Institute.
“In the middle of the hall was a very handsome group re-
presenting the judgment of Solomon in reference to the disputed
babe. ”J[
Reporting a concert organised by G. F. Mitchell, organist
of St. Saviour’s Cathedral, in aid of the hospital, the
‘‘Herald” said:
“The front seats and the gallery were well filled, though the
shilling seats were nearly empty—a fact not to be regretted as
it is sometimes from those that the noise and interruptions that
sometimes mar the pleasure of Goulburn concerts chiefly pro-
ceed.”**

It required courage to perform in public in Goulburn
60 years ago. Larrikinism, referred to elsewhere in this
history, disturbed even professional concerts, e.g.:
“Miss Lydia Howarde gives an entertainment in the Mechanics’
Institute. Arrangements will be made to prevent a repetition
of the disorder resulting from a crowded house which took
place during the performance of the Georgia Minstrels.”*
Mm. Patti sang in Goulburn on the 24/3/1880. f The
hall was only half filled. The financial encouragement ac-
corded celebrity concerts in Goulburn was as poor fifty years
ago as it is to-day. Only the citizens of those days hit upon
a novel plan to overcome the difficulty. Twice at least
they organised a “ low-brow“ entertainment to defray the
losses suffered by a 1 1 high-brow. ’ ’ On the 31/12/1886 the
“Walsh de Bruze Opera Company’ ’ rendered “Carmen” at
the Academy of Music. Owing to the meagre support the
company made a heavy loss, whereupon “Our Boys Dra-
matic Society”.. .“very thoughtfully offered their services
in connection with the drama ‘Neck or Nothing.’ ” This
was advertised later as a “Complimentary Benefit.”
In the same newspaper appears the notice of another
“Grand Benefit” to be tendered to the “Vivian Dramatic
Company” by the “Goulburn Amateur Minstrels.”||
Henry Ketton, a famous pianist, visited Goulburn some
50/60 years ago and gave recitals. Chas. Santley, the
famous baritone, was heard here on the 19/9/1890, J. L.
Toole, the comedian visited Goulburn on the 6/1/1891. By
this time however, Toole was becoming an old man and
Goulburn was somewhat disappointed. Max O’Rell gave
one of his inimitable lectures in Goulburn on the 17/10/1892.
Phillip Newbury and Madame Spada were conducting their
“Pops” at the Oddfellows’ Hall in 18984
Amy Castles sang here on the 28/7/1902. Auguste Van
Biene produced “The Broken Melody” in Goulburn on the
19th and 20th of June, 1905. The “Besses o’ th’ Barn”
Band visited Goulburn on the 22/7/1907.§ At other times
Madame Melba, Clara Butt, John Lemmone, Peter Dawson,
Rosina Buckman, Toti del Monte, Marie Narelle, Evelyn
Scotney, Harold Williams, Alfred O’Shea and other artists

have appeared in Goulburn, many of these visits being spon-
sored by the Goulburn Liedertafel. The State Orchestra
performed in Goulburn on the 2/5/1922. The hall was only
half-filled. The Sistine choir came two days later and was
well supported.
Allan Wilkie and his Shakesperian company visited
Goulburn on the 10/5/1923. The attendance, which was
disappointing, was the subject of a leader in the “Penny
Post,” on the deterioration of Public Taste.”*
The “Amateur Dramatic Club” advertised in 1874 that
it “will shortly appear before the public.” In 1878 the
“Goulburn Dramatic Company” gave a complimentary bene-
fit to_ S. D. McGowan who “had assisted it for some years
past in its performances for charitable purposes.”t “The
Goulburn Dramatic Club” was formed in July, 1884. The
secretary wrote to the newspapers the next year stating
that the club was still in existence but that its difficulties
were due “to the adverse criticism of the press.”
The next issue of the “Southern Argus” carried a sar-
castic leader; the “Goulburn Dramatic Club is not dead: it
sleepeth only.’ That the club had some foundation for its
complaints of the press is evident for, commenting on a
performance in the Mechanics’ Institute, the “Argus” de-
scribed “the intervals as the most pleasing feature of the
performance. ’ ’f
“Our Boys’ Amateur Dramatic Society” was in being
in the eighties, as was the “Mercantile Dramatic Club.” The
“Black Diamonds” was a dramatic society operating in the
nineties. The “Adelphi Dramatic Company” was reorganised
in 1900. Another “Goulburn Dramatic Company” was
producing plays in 1904. Ernest Finn was its comedian.
The “Irving Dramatic Society” was functioning in 1906.
Miss Milford Terriss was the instructress. §
A glee society called “The Harmonic Club” was formed
in 1873. A. W. Fleming was the secretary. Another, or
perhaps a revival, was formed on the 6/8/1878. Its ad-
vertisements vary. Sometimes it is called the “Harmonic,”
sometimes the “Philharmonic.” On the 31/8/1878 the first

meeting of its performing members was advertised. Another
“ Philharmonic ” Society was established in 1885. There
were other short-lived societies of this name in later years.
One such was established in 1906, and another in 1918.*
Several meetings were advertised in 1879 for the pur-
pose of forming a musical society. The Goulburn “Herald”
said succinctly:
“It seems useless, after the several unsuccessful attempts....
to make any further efforts in this direction.”
However, a fortnight later the society was formed with
G. F. Mitchell as conductor. The society met at the house
of Mrs. Ross.f The “Amateur Christy Minstrels” were
functioning in 1874. They disintegrated in a whirl of re-
crimination in 1875. The Committee’s report was character-
ised as “base and rotten to the core” and the “Penny Post”
closed down on the The “Goulburn
Amateur Minstrels,” apparently a revival of the earlier so-
ciety, were functioning in the eighties.
The “Romany Musical and Dramatic Club” was formed
in 1889. C. O’Keefe was its musical director and Fred
Buckle its stage manager. Its first performance was given
on the 15/3/1889. The “Goulburn Musical Union” was
operating in 1890. The secretary was W. G. Rendall.
There were eight performers. The conductor was J. Slat-
yer. The “Goulburn Glee Club” with Percy M. Ibbs as
conductor, was giving concerts in the nineties. The “Goul-
burn Railway Musical and Literary Society” was estab-
lished in 1896. It was revived on the 27/3/1899 after a
lapse of two and a quarter years. §
All concerts, entertainments and visiting artists and
companies, local performances and meetings were accom-
modated in the eighties and nineties in the “Academy of
Music.” This functioned at the Oddfellows’ Hall. The
Lyric Club was formed in 1903. Bishop Barlow was presi-
dent and Fr. O’Sullivan one of the vice-presidents. Proceeds
from its operas were divided between the City Mission and
the St. Vincent de Paul Society. E. J. Robinson organist of

The “Goulburn Liedertafel” was formed on the
6/5/1891. Its founders were F. E. Whalley and G. H.
Doubleday. Its first president was A. G. Finlay. It gave
its first concert on the 21/7/1891 under the baton of F. W.
Harmer. Succeeding conductors have been P. F. Hollis
1896, W. W. Thorman 1906, W. H. Caspers 1911, F. Howard
Ussher 1915, W. Hellenish 1919, Evan Owen 1920, W. R.
McNicoll 1923, A. L. Bruce 1934, A. Mielen 1934, N. Wilson
1938.
During the 1914/18 War, in mistaken patriotism, the
name of the society was changed to the “ Leader Choral
Society” but in recent years the former name has been
revived. Between 70 and 80 members of the Sydney Lieder-
tafel were entertained by the Goulburn Society in 1902 and
the combined societies gave a public performance.
For its 100 th concert the Liedertafel published a sou-
venir programme with historical notes and several pages
of illustrations.* W. A. Mac Donald told the story of the
society from 1891 to 1912. F. W. Harmer its first con-
ductor, paid a tribute to W. F. Jones, W. S. Foxall, P. F.
Hollis and W. Thorman. W. Carey Taylor wrote some
fascinating reminiscences of early performances and per-
formers. He records:
“We were bearded ‘like the Pard/ or at least bore the badge
of manhood on our upper lips in those days...Our voices were
as the ‘bulls of Bashan’ for volume, and we ate, drank, and were
merry in glorious disregard of any stomachic aftermath.”
The Liedertafel built its hall in 1929 at a cost of £3300.
Manfred and Son were the architects and J. J. Piggott the
builder. The hall was damaged by fire in 1933 when many
interesting records and photos were destroyed. There is
a brass plate in the hall to the memory of L. de V. Hunt, 39
years a member.!
The Goulburn Choral Society had an independent ex-
istence for some 24 years. Its first committee meeting was
held at the “ White Horse” on the 8/4/1892. It co-operated
with and later merged itself in the Liedertafel during the
1914/18 war. Another “Choral and Operatic Society”
functioned for a while. In 1925 the “Goulburn Choral
Society” was formed. E. J. Fulton was its first conductor.

He was succeeded by Evan Owen. The Goulburn Symphony
Orchestra functioned for a while with Norman Wilson as
conductor.**
The “Goulburn Musical and Operatic Society” was
formed in 1906 and functioned for 10 years, producing a
number of operas. P. F. Hollis was its first conductor, Mr.
(afterwards the Reverend) Leicester Johnson the last.*
“The Goulburn Gladuns” was the name of an organisa-
tion which staged a number of revues and other perform-
ances for patriotic purposes during the Great War. Its
first appearance was in 1916. f
An abortive attempt to launch an Eisteddfod was made
in 1905. The Goulburn and District’s First Annual Eistedd-
fod was held in 1928. J. S. Sheehan was the organiser.
Miss Faithfull gave a gold cup for the band contest and the
“Evening Post” a silver cup for the choirs. There was a
deficit of £2OO on the undertaking.^
Another “Glee Club” was formed in 1933 with Evan
Owen as conductor. It had only a short career. The State
Orchestra, under Dr. E. L. Bainton, gave a concert here on
the 24/7/1935. Dr. Bainton was accorded a civic reception.
The guarantors were called upon to make good a deficit of
£42. § There have been many literary and debating societies.
The following appear to have been the most important.
The “Goulburn Literary Society” was defunct in 1874.
When it was founded is not now clear. A letter in the
“Evening Post” deploring its demise carried a footnote by
the editor that the society trained in public speaking the
member for Goulburn (apparently Edward Butler) and a
“member of the United States Congress.” It was wound
up the following year. The press report stated it had
“gone up a tree.” A “Goulburn Literary Association,” a
“non-sectarian society,” was established in 1874. W.
Teece, M.L.A., was its chairman. A second “Goulburn
Literary and Debating Society” was formed on the
24/6/1892. Yet another “The Goulburn Literary Club”
was in being in 1900. A. E. Sendall was its president.]! The

“Church of England Working Men’s Literary Association”
was a very live body in the seventies and eighties. The
Rev. G. M. D’Arey Irvine was keenly interested in it. Arch-
deacon Puddicombe was its president. It was formed about
1873. On the 8/11/1875 it organised an excursion to Syd-
ney, 200 travelling by special train. Proceeds were for the
building of St. Saviour’s Hall.
Its proceedings were given an extraordinary amount of
space in all local papers. Its average attendance was 26.
The “Catholic Literary Society” was in being in the seven-
ties and eighties. It was revived in 1891, when A. C. Arkins
was its president. The “Wesleyan Mutual Improvement
Society” and the “St. Andrew’s Mutual Improvement So-
ciety” were both functioning at the same time. A “Parlia-
mentary Debating Society” also flourished in the eighties.
The “Kendall Debating Club” met in its own rooms in
Market Street in the nineties. An “Art Society” was
operating in 1904, A. J. Sach was its president. An
“Articled Clerks’ Association” was formed in 1898. The
monthly meetings took the form of debates, mock trials,
lectures, readings and essays. #
Another Literary Society, the “Goulburn Young Men’s
Literary and Debating Society” was formed in 1931.f A
branch of the National Association of Apex Clubs was
formed in May, 1937. Apex has worked successfully, foster-
ing a spirit of civic pride and affording opportunity for
disinterested service. Its first president was Keith Elphin-
stone.
A company of the Boys’ Brigade was formed by the
Women’s Christian Temperance Union in 1898. The brigade
room was in the Australian Arcade. $ There was also a
company of the Church Lads’ Brigade at St. Nicholas,’
North Goulburn, for many years.
A chess club was formed in 1887. C. S. Alexander,
P.M., was president. It was reorganised in 1896. The
press referred to its “prosperity.”§
The Country Women’s Association is one of the younger
organisations of the city, but none the less vigorous for that.

The inaugural meeting was held on the 21/9/1923 when
Mrs. C. E. Prell was elected president. In 1926 a rest room
was founded and in July, 1927, a baby health centre. The
association has been housed in Cody’s buildings and in the
Soldiers’ Club. It has its own premises now in Montague
Street, built in 1937 at a cost of £1546. The architect was
H. C. Manfred and the contractor J. Hampshire. “Service
to Country Women by Country Women” is the slogan of
the association, a motto which is fulfilled in its work for the
hospital, the baby health centre, its seaside homes and its
travellers’ aid. It gave a bed to the Women’s Ward at the
Hospital in 1940. #
The “Girls’ Realm Guild of Service” was a branch of
the English society of that name. It functioned for a while
from 1907. It was founded by a Miss Ackerman who
represented the Westminster Gazetted
A “Natural History and Literary Society” was func-
tioning in 1911. Inspector Nolan and C. A. Blumer, M.A.,
were interested in it. An “Owl Club” was formed in
1891 for “social recreation” and “intellectual intercourse.”
The president was W. Steele. The club rented two rooms
in the Protestant Halid
The “Rostrum Club, No. 7, Goulburn,” states its ob-
jects as follows:
“The Rostrum is for those who desire to advance themselves
in the mastery of the art of Public Speaking and who hold that
Freedom of Speech, Loyalty to Truth, Clarity of Thought and
a love of the English Tongue are vital elements of that art, and
are of the utmost value to the community at large. The
Rostrum aims at creating a loyalty that will enrich the fellow-
ship of its members; it holds to an educational ideal.”
The Goulburn branch was founded in April, 1936. Its
first president was J. B. Mullen.
The “Rotary Club of Goulburn,” whilst exercising
autonomy in its domestic affairs, is a unit of Rotary Inter-
national, from which body the local club received its charter.
Its membership is limited to one representative of a vocation
in a community. It was founded to develop a higher ethical
conception of community life. The first meeting of the
Goulburn Club was on the 10/3/1930. C. E. Prell was the
first president and W. H. Williams the first secretary.

Rotary in Goulburn took the initiative in the matter of sea-
side camps for boys. The Goulburn club has a membership
of 40.
A branch of the “Secular Society” was functioning in
Goulburn in 1886. The “Goulburn Scientific Society” was
founded in 1890 by A. J. Sach of the Goulburn Technical
School.*
There were numerous temperance societies in Goulburn
in the seventies and eighties. In addition to the Goulburn
Band of Hope and the Good Templars each denomination
had its own society and their activities were numerous.
One of the quaintest titles of these societies was that
adopted by the Primitive Methodists, viz., “The On to the
Rescue Band of Hope.” Others were the “Ark of Peace
Division of the Daughters of Temperance,” and the “Guid-
ing Star Lodge of Rechabites,” of which L. Railton was
executive officer in 1889. A sample programme of a Band
of Hope concert is that of the Primitive Methodists on the
30/5/1887 which included “Kind Words,” “The Drunkard’s
Death,” “The Drunkard’s Child,” “A Daughter’s In-
fluence,” “A Vision of the Demon Drink,” “Spare that
Glass,” etc. The Primitives had 90 members, the Wes-
leyans 500, the strength of the “Sons of Temperance” and
the “Good Templars” was not stated.
The “Hope of Goulburn” met on a Monday night;
“The Union of the East” on Tuesday; the “Go Ahead” on
Wednesday; the “Dawn of Day” on Thursday; the “Juve-
nile Temple” on Friday and the Y.M.C.A. Temperance Lodge
on Saturday. To complete the week the Temperance Club
was open on Sunday evenings. There was another 1.0. G.T.
Lodge at West Goulburn, not on that list. The “Aurora”
Band of Hope met at the North Goulburn Methodist Church.
Branches existed too of the Church of England Temperance
Society and the Roman Catholic Total Abstinence Society.!
Another Temperance Lodge was the “Union of the
East” of the 1.0. G.T. Appropriately enough this was
domiciled at East grove. It was formed in 1887. The “Blue
Ribbon Gospel Temperance Union” was meeting in 1889.

Rechabites was established in 1891. The “Women’s Chris-
tian Temperance Union” was meeting monthly that year.
The “Emblem of Peace” Juvenile Lodge No. 370 was formed
in the Coromandel Street Temple on the 12/11/1891. The
“Star of the West” Lodge of the 1.0. G.T. was meeting there
too. The “Perseverance Lodge” of the 1.0. G.T. was also
domiciled there.
In the late eighties there was a “Temperance Club”
apparently the joint concern of various temperance organisa-
tions. The cheques on the account of the “Temperance
Club and Literary Institute” were signed by J. W. Magraw
in 1888. The club was conducting public dining rooms in
1889. It failed that year involving its guarantors in some
loss, whereupon A. Didson took it over and conducted it as
a Temperance Hotel. The “Prohibition Hall,” formerly
the second barracks of the Salvation Army, was opened by
the Misses Vincent and Cummings, delegates from, and
evangelists of, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union,
on the 15/6/1894. The “Victoria Club for Girls” was
reported in 1906 as “meeting with much success.” It met
at the Oddfellows’ Hall.*
A meeting convened by the Wesleyan Mutual Improve-
ment Society in 1875, decided it was not desirable to
establish a branch of the Y.M.C.A. in Goulburn. Eleven
years later in 1886, the Rev. A. T. Puddicombe convened
another meeting and a branch was formed. Its history
is obscure. J. W. Wombey was its president and he and
J. E. P. Walker were its trustees in 1889. That year the
branch bought the site of its hall at the sale of the old
hospital site on the 15/2/1889. It gave £9/19/- a foot for
it. It was then conducting a Literary and Debating Club.
It invited competitive designs for its hall. Hy. Laker, jnr.,
a student at the Technical College won the competition.
The total cost of the building was £2138. The contractors
were Holloway for the brickwork and Lunn and Small for
all else. The Hon. E. Vickery, M.L.C., laid the foundation
stone on the 28/6/1889. The Druids and other organisa-
tions were meeting there in the nineties.!

The hall was opened on the 23/11/1889. Curiously
enough neither the State nor the National Headquarters of
the Y.M.C.A. have any knowledge of these activities or of
this property. When it was sold to the Salvation Army
there remained a debt of £245 and on the 1/1/1895 and for
some years afterwards the guarantors arranged a railway
excursion “in aid of the reduction of their liability.” The
Young Women’s Christian Association functioned for a
while in Goulburn but closed down in 1890 “in consequence
of the small interest taken in it.”*
N. C. Phillips is said to have formed one of the earliest
bands in Goulburn, himself procuring and supplying the
instruments from Sydney, f The earliest press notice of a
band in Goulburn is in 1854 when the “German Band”
played at the opening of the Fitzroy Bridge. The “Tem-
perance Band” advertised that its new instruments were
“on view at Mr. Gregory’s” in 1871. The Goulburn Volun-
teer Rifles had a band, formed between 1869 and 1871. In
1871 J. White was instructor. It was reorganised in 1874.
In that year it was resuscitated with G. Richards as band-
master at £lOO per annum. It was defunct again in 1876.
The Drum and Fife Band of the Band of Hope was
functioning in 1876. The “Concordia Band” played with
the Oddfellows’ Band and the City Band at Dr. Hayley’s
funeral in 1878. Another Drum and Fife Band was formed
in connection with St. Patrick’s College in 1879. H. White
was bandmaster. Goulburn ran to bands in the eighties:
“Four bands in various parts of the streets of the city between
seven and eight o’clock all playing at one time produced a large
volume of sound, which if not harmonious was at least novel”
The Oddfellows Band played at the reception to Gover-
nor Loftus in 1880 and received an honorarium of £3/3/-.
In 1883 it was reorganised as the “Premier” Band. The
“Premier” Band was functioning in 1883 with T. Wilkie
as leader. In 1886 it is described as attending a church
parade “and discoursed splendid music in a finished
manner. ’ ’
The “Skating Rink Band” performed on the verandah
of the White Horse hotel on New Year’s Eve, December 31,
1888. There were three skating rinks in Goulburn then.

The Patrician Brothers’ Fife and Drum Band was “re-
organised” in 1889. §
The “Young Australian” Band was advertising freely
in the eighties. W. H. Mandeville was the leader in 1884.
From 1887 to 1889 the Premier Band joined forces with the
Volunteer Fire Brigade which at that time was thinking of
starting a band of its own. It was known for some years
as ‘ ‘ The Premier and Fire Brigade Band. ’’ The ‘ ‘ Goulburn
Model Brass Band” was performing in Belmore Park in
1890. The South Goulburn Drum and Fife Band is
mentioned in 1891. “Our Boys’ Band” was in existence
in 1897 with A. B. Beer as bandmaster. This band formed
the nucleus of the second City Band. There have been
several bands called “Goulburn and District.” One such
was playing in 1898 with T. Wilkie as conductor. A Public
School Cadet Corps Band was formed in 1891, with H. White
as conductor. It numbered 40 performers.*'
The Australian Rifles Band (E. Coy) 6th Regiment was
formed or reformed in 1899 with A. B. Beer as bandmaster.
It applied to the municipal council for the use of Belmore
Park for a “continental” in 1901. The request was granted
on condition that the band gave eight concerts in the park
during the year. In 1903 it became defunct and the Muni-
cipal Council became trustee of its instruments. These
instruments crop up all through the history of subsequent
bands. St. Patrick’s Band was formed in 1904, in connec-
tion with the Christian Brothers’ School. C. G. McConnell,
organist of SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral was largely
interested in this. The bands were not always appreciated.
A writer in the local press complained of three bands “mak-
ing night hideous” and of the three bandmasters then
coming round to “solicit subscriptions for their fiendish
night’s work.”f
A “Railway Band” was proposed in 19084 The “Gor-
don Club,” an Anglican organisation in connection with the
Cathedral parish, flourished for many years. It established
a band about 1909 which flourished too for some years. The

43rd Infantry Band was formed in 1913. The municipal
council granted the use of the instruments formerly used by
the City Band. A. B. Beer was bandmaster. Its first
public performance was on the 6/3/1914* It only had a
short career. A Pipers’ Band was formed about 1921 and
for some years was most efficient and smart. The Austra-
lian Light Horse Band has had several names, e.g., the Ist
L.H., the 11th, and the 7th. The A.L.H. Regiment was
raised as a volunteer regiment by Colonel J. A. Murphy,
C.8., about the end of 1897. The first bandmaster was
Thomas Wilkie. The band’s first church parade was at St.
Saviour’s Cathedral in May, 1898.
A public meeting, convened by the mayor, and addres-
sed, amongst others, by Bishop Barlow, protested success-
fully in 1903 against “the proposed disbandment of military
bands” in Goulburn. In 1935 and 1937 further attempts
were made to call in the A.L.H. instruments. Each time
local protests were successful. In 1935 the citizens rallied
to the rescue and raised £SOO for uniforms and equipment.!
Since 1910 the band has not been attached to the Light
Horse Regiment officially but has been associated with it
in its activities. Bandmasters have included T. Wilkie,
J. Yale, W. Jones, J. Cody, F. B. Wilson and Norman Wilson.
In 1917 the band won the C Grade championship and the
Nicholson Shield. In 1918 it won the B Grade champion-
ship, the Boosey Cup and third place in the A Grade open
to all bands in Australia. For 20 years W. H. Hamilton
was its secretary. In 1937 the band was enlisted in the
3rd Infantry Battalion but was permitted to retain its former
green and gold uniform.^
When the Goulburn City Band was first formed is now
uncertain. It appears to have been about 1870. In 1873
it inserted a displayed advertisement: “The City Band is
not defunct. George Mohr, Bandmaster.” It played at
Dr. Hayley’s funeral in 1878. It was defunct in 1897.
With “Our Boys’ Band” as a nucleus it was reorganised in
1898 with A. B. Beer as bandmaster. In 1899 it merged its
identity in the Australian Rifles’ Band. In 1903 the City
Band was resuscitated, the Municipal Council entrusting it
with the instruments of the Rifles’ Band. The Council

adopted “amended rules for the conduct of the City Band”
but remained trustee of the instruments. In 1905 the mayor
complained that accounts owing by the “defunct City Band”
were coming to him.
Revived again it got into difficulties by 1909 for the
municipal council asked for the return of the instruments.
Later an extension of 12 months was granted. The present
Goulburn City and District Band was organised on the
25/5/1913 by J. Cody, previously conductor of the A.L.H.
Band. It won third prize in the C Grade competition in
Sydney in 1914. A Band Sunday was held on the
1/11/1936 when a number of local and visiting Bands joined
in a demonstration in Victoria Park.*
The first district show was held at Dan Thorn’s in 1846.
Exhibitors included Francis McArthur, Captain Turner,
Tommy Wade, Ben Stephenson, Tom and Joe Erby (horses),
George and Dan Thorn (buffaloes), Messrs. Chisholm, N. C.
Phillips, Thos. Gibson and Broadribb (sheep and cattle).
The second show was held at Garroorigang and included a
ploughing match won by the Nosworthy Bros, of Merrilla.t
This is confirmed in part by the late John Horton, who
wrote:
“The first show held in Goulburn was at Thorn’s at the old
brewery. I was there with my parents. I think the follow-
ing year the show was held at Bradley’s Mill (subsequently
Bartlett’s Brewery). A ploughing match was once held in
a paddock this side of the present racecourse between the road
and the brewery.”!
Some other reminiscences differ considerably in date
and detail. They read:
“The first show of the A & P Society in Goulburn was held
in a paddock belonging to Mr. Bradley. The day was a general
holiday, stores and mills and business places were closed.
Amongst the visitors were the Rev. J. F. Hassall and the Rev.
Fr. M. Kavanagh. Governor Denison on his way back from
Braidwood stopped at Goulburn and was elected patron of the
Society. The celebrated horse “Waverley,” the property of Mr.
J. Roberts, was exhibited, also horses belonging to Mr. Lambert
and N. C. Phillips. There was a ploughing match with 20
teams entered. It began at 11 a.m. and finished at 3 p.m.
The judges were G. Martyr (Richlands), J. R. Styles (Bun-
gonia) and D. Broadhead (Bungonia).§

§ “E.P.P.,” 27/11/1933, unsigned, where the date is given as 1837
throughout. The names mentioned shew that 1857 is meant.


The real difficulty of arriving at the facts was given by
the Goulburn “Herald,” in 1881. It said that the records
of that first show “are missing from our files.” The 1896
show was held at Kenmore; the Government is said to have
granted free railway passes to the German Band from Syd-
ney to attend. The Volunteers under Captain Rossi kept
order.*
In 1881 when the present A.P. & H. Society functioned
for the first time, the greater number of the office-bearers
of that first society were still alive and the history of its
activities published then may reasonably be assumed to be
accurate. It would seem that the first Agricultural and
Horticultural Society was formed in 1857. The president
was Wm. Bradley and the honorary secretaries C. Cowper,
jnr., and D. H. Thorn. The treasurer was Wm. Conolly.
Its first public function was on the 13/8/1857 when a plough-
ing match was held in Bradley’s paddock. The judges were
J. R. Styles, Geo. Martyr and D. Broadhead. That first
society’s first show was held on 17/3/1858 at Bradley’s
Brewery. Receipts totalled £203/1/6. f
For many years afterwards shows were held at Brad-
ley’s brewery and ploughing matches at Garroorigang,
Kenmore and Brooks’ paddocks. A grant of land in the
old township was made for a showground, but not being
availed of, reverted to the Crown. N. C. Phillips was the
principal worker in the first society. A. G. Finlay later on
was secretary. The “old” show society, i.e., “The Argyle
Agricultural Society” was still operating in 1864 and 1869.
The winding up resolution is quoted in full, but with no date,
in the new society’s minutes when it handed over its remain-
ing assets as a “donation” to be “expended in prizes for
horticulture only.” The sum amounted to £lB/8/6. A
public meeting was held in the Municipal Chambers on the

and Horticultural Society.” The mayor, E. Ball, presided.
W. P. Faithfull was elected president; 7 vice-presidents and
76 committeemen were appointed. A. MaeKellar was elected
treasurer and Isaac Shepherd and S. Harborne Belcher
secretaries. A subscription list was opened which reached

qualify for a grant of land and £SOO from the Government.
D. Broadhead gave a prize of £B/8/- for the “best plough-
man, colonial or imported/ ’ The first annual show was
held on the 6th, 7th and Bth April, 1881. W. P. Faithfull
opened the show. G. Richard’s “Concordia” Band (Goul-
burn) and the Royal Artillery Band (Sydney) were in
attendance. The pavilion was lighted with gas and the
show opened at night. Attendances were: Ist day (2/6)
1100, 2nd day (1/-) 3500, with 800 at night, 3rd day about
the same, In the horse section (“blood department”) H.
Zouch’s “Trinculo” took first honours and A. F. Gibson’s
“Lady Flora” in the mares. Chas. Rogers exhibited fur-
niture made in “his steam bedding factory.” Walter
Douglas’ prize cow, “Royal Jerusalem sth” lost her tail
“whether by accident or otherwise cannot be ascertained.”
In 1929 the society moved out to its new showground on the
Yass Road. Over £20,000 has been expended on the new
ground. In 1934 mechanical coursing was added to its
activities and has proved not only popular but a considerable
financial help to the society. C. E. Prell was president
for 14 years.*
The first Goulburn Horticultural Society was formed
and held its first show in 1873. Receipts were £32, ex-
penses £42. It appears in the directories in 1874 with L.
Alexander as secretary. It held an autumn exhibition on
the 23/3/1876, and its third annual meeting in November
that year. A horticultural club was formed in 1905. Its
intention was not to hold shows but to permit members to
exhibit fruit, flowers and vegetables at its monthly meet-
ings. Another Goulburn and District Horticultural Society
was formed about 1892. The president was E. C. Bryden.
The present society was formed about 1930.f
The Goulburn Fruitgrowers’ Union was in being in the
nineties. A. Lansdowne was president.s The “Amateur”
Poultry, Pigeon and Canary Society” was functioning in
the eighties. Another “Goulburn Poultry Pigeon and
Canary Club” held its second show on the 29/6/1906. A

Club” was formed in 1926. A “Goulburn Homing Pigeon
Society’ ’ was functioning in the eighties. Another “Goul-
hurn Homing Society” held its first flying competition on
the 1/9/1907. Fifteen birds were liberated by Plumb of
Gunning, and all arrived home in excellent time (average
32| minutes). The Goulburn branch of the Beekeepers’
Association was founded in June, 1926. The Goulburn
Philatelic Society was formed on the 23/5/1936. T. A.
Doolan was its first president. The Goulburn Radio Club
was functioning in 1926. #
The beginnings of the Railway Institute in Goulburn
are to be found in a general meeting of railway employees
held in Goulburn on the 24/1/1915, when a committee was
appointed and arrangements made to conduct two classes
in the Steam Shed Inspector’s office. However the com-
mittee took over a building at the rear of the old Police
Barracks in Sloane Street and remodelled it to provide a
library, reading room, billiard room and class rooms. The
Institute was opened on the 16/9/1916 by the Deputy Com-
missioner for Railways, E. Milne. It was soon found that
these premises were too small and mainly through the efforts
of J. D. Reid the old A.B.C. Bank premises in Market Street
were acquired and converted into an institute catering for
the social, recreational and educational requirements of the
railway employees and their families. At that time the
Institute was known as the Goulburn Branch of the “N.S.W.
Government Railway and Tramway Institute. ’ ’ The organ-
isation is now known as the “Railways Institute.” M. B.
Donnellan signed the first annual report in 1915 as president
and W. Brewer as secretary. The first set of by-laws is
signed by J. D. Reid.f
There has been a number of clubs in Goulburn but only
two survive. The oldest is the “Goulburn Club.” Its
premises, much altered, are those of the “Medical Hall,”
dating back to the forties of last century. The “Union
Club” was formed in 1882. It was housed at the Royal
Hotel. Its first president was Solomon Meyer. It was
only short-lived.:): There was a working men’s club in the
nineties. Press references to it are few. One displayed

advertisement threatened “licensed victuallers ’’ and “rene-
gade members” with prosecution if certain “false rumours”
were repeated.* Another club which had a short existence
was the “ Wollondilly. ” It leased the premises at the
corner of Bourke and Clifford Streets belonging to T. T.
Alkin. Dr. Burton Bradley was its president. The “Lady
Belmore” is a women’s club now in the Soldiers’ Club build-
ing. The “Soldiers’ Club” is mentioned in the chapter
on military formations.
The records of scouting in Goulburn are extant from
1917 only. In that year the Ist Goulburn troop was in
existence with A. A. Turnbull as scoutmaster. Defunct,
it was reorganised in June 1921, with F. H. Freeguard as
scoutmaster. For some years it was a closed troop (Angli-
can) but it is now an open troop. The 2nd Goulburn
(Roman Catholic) was formed in 1928 and continued for 10
years when it went out of existence owing to the lack of
officers. P. L. Crowfoot was its first scoutmaster. The
3rd Goulburn (St. Nicholas’, Anglican) was formed in 1930
with the Rev. C. M. Statham as scoutmaster. The 4th
Goulburn was formed in 1933 by the Rev. A. W. Bray
(Methodist). It closed down for lack of officers. No. 5
(Anglican) was registered in March 1937. The Rev. F. M.
Hill was its first scoutmaster.!
The Girl Guides Local Association was registered in
1925, the Ist Goulburn (St. Saviour’s) Guide Company in
1924, the Ist Goulburn Brownie Pack in 1925 and the Ist
Goulburn Ranger Company in 1924. The 2nd Goulburn
(Methodist) Guide Company was established in 1924, its
Brownie Pack in 1926 and its Ranger Company in 1933.
The P.L.C. Guides, (3rd and sth Companies), their Brownies
(3rd), the 4th Goulburn Guides and Brownies and the St.
Andrew’s Guides (sa) were all formed from 1924 to 1929
but have since disbanded. The Ist Goulburn Rangers was
the first Ranger Company established in New South Wales.
Another account states that the Ist Guide Company was
established in 1922, and the second in 1923. Mrs. Y. W.
Ryrie was District Commissioner for many years as was
Mrs. G. H. Hirst. Camps have been held at “Wynella,”
Towrang, and “Lynton.”J

The Police Boys’ Club was formed under Superintendent
Miller in 1937, and achieved good results.
The Goulburn Kennel Club was founded in September,
1931, to foster the improvement, breeding and welfare of
pedigree dogs. It holds shows, and arranges lectures, meet-
ings and conferences for these purposes. It endeavours to
teach children a better understanding and appreciation of
pure bred dogs. Its membership in 1940 was 110. It
registered 7 1 puppies that year. There was an aggregate
entry of 816 in its three 2 Pt. Championship Shows, a State
record. Ninety-three dogs were exhibited at the Sydney
Royal Show. Goulburn Kennel Club dogs won more major
awards than any other country district. The Club is af-
filiated with the Kennel Board of Control. W. V. Steele
and A. H. Sherwin were its foundation president and sec-
retary respectively.*
On the 28/11/1913 a public meeting was held in the
Town Hall to form a Chamber of Commerce. The first
general meeting was called for the 9/12/1913 and was ad-
journed until the 20/1/1914. The Hon. G. H. Reid was
elected as its first honorary member. It affiliated with the
Sydney Chamber of Commerce in 1914. The Chamber
suggested to the Government the use of business men in
Government business undertakings and from this evolved
the system of advisory committees. The Chamber organised
in 1915 and has maintained each year ever since the apple
and pear pyramids at the Royal Agricultural Show. In
1921 the apple exhibit won the silver cup presented by Sir
Samuel Hordern. Rivers in the district have been stocked
with trout. The Chamber in 1917 urged the Government
to proceed with the Burrenjuck Hydro-Electric scheme.
From 1917 to 1924 it agitated for a bridge at Paddy’s River.
In 1920 it formed the Goulburn-Tallong-Nowra Road League
and is still interested in this. It interested itself in the
New States movement, angle parking, wool sales in Goul-
burn, the Bungonia Reserve, the bridge at Oallen Ford, uni-
form traffic laws, local railway matters, the proposed Lake
George speedway, the bridge at Cabbage Tree Creek, the
White Way in Auburn Street, wool classing in Goulburn, etc.
* Mrs. K. F. Baird, 1940.


In 1937 it was instrumental in forming an Association
of Country Chambers of Commerce. C. W. Furner was its
first president, C. F. Adams its first secretary. At first its
meetings were held in W. H. Wheatley’s office. In more
recent years it has met at the Town Hall.*
The first Masonic Lodge in Gonlbnrn was “The Gold-
burn Chapter of Australia, No. 1762,” under the English
Constitution. It was established in 1849. The first W.M.
was the Rev. Wm. Ross who also held the Grand Lodge office
of P.P. Grand Chaplain. The Rev. Wm. Ross held the
position of W.M. on nine separate occasions. The Lodge
has had a continuous existence with the exception of one
short recess. It was reopened in 1878 when Prank Deacon
became Worshipful Master. At the union in 1888 it emerged
as “The Gonlbnrn Lodge of Australia, No. 58” U.G.L. of
N.S.W. The names of its Masters include many famous or
important in Gonlbnrn’s history, names which appear in
almost every chapter of this book, such as David Patterson,
Francis Macarthur, Dr. Robert Waugh, W. H. Maybury,
S. H. Belcher, Canon D’Arcy Irvine, John Cropper, C. A.
Middleton, E. C. Manfred, W. J. Bartlett, Bishop Barlow
and Archdeacon Bartlett. In 1884, C. A. Middleton, E. C.
Manfred and W. J. Bartlett occupied the main positions in
the lodge and 40 years later these three presided at a special
meeting of the lodge and occupied the same positions, a
record without parallel in the annals of Free Masonry. The
Masonic memorial to the Rev. Wm. Ross is noted in the
section dealing with the Presbyterian Church. E. C. Man-
fred and John Holdorf (treasurer) were signing cheques on
behalf of the “Gonlbnrn Chapter of Australia Masonic
Lodge” in 1888.
A meeting to establish a Masonic Lodge in Gonlbnrn
was held at the Harp Hotel on the 20/10/1877. This pro-
bably relates to the reopening of the “Gonlbnrn Chapter
of Australia” after the recess mentioned above.!
At the invitation of Bro. C. Hill, seven Freemasons met
at Main’s “Oddfellows’ Arms” early in April 1879, when
it was determined to form a Lodge under the jurisdiction
of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Scotland (Scottish Con-
stitution). On the 30/6/1879 by-laws were adopted and

Bro. C. Hill was elected first R. W. Master. The first
regular meeting of the lodge was held on the 22/7/1879 in
St. Andrew’s School room for the consecration of the lodge
and the installation of its officers. It was chartered on the
7/10/1879 as No. 645 under the Scottish Constitution. In
November that year the lodge transferred to what is now
the Mulwaree Private Hotel. In October 1880, it moved
to rooms in Belmore Square where it remained until March
1891, when it was established in premises in Bourke Street,
a temple which it owns in conjunction with the Goulburn
Lodge of Australia. On the 18/6/1888 the lodge tendered
its allegiance to the United Grand Lodge of N.S.W. and
became “The Duke of Edinburgh Lodge No. 76.” “The
Duke of Edinburgh R. A. Chapter” is said to have been
founded on the 17/12/1884 as No. 208, under the Scottish
Constitution. Against that William Affleck wrote that he
“joined the Royal Arch Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons in Goulburn” in 1881. The “Tuscan Lodge No.
32” chartered on the 22/12/1883 under the N.S.W. Con-
stitution, became No. 107 U.G.L. of N.S.W., at the Union.
It amalgamated with the “Duke of Edinburgh No. 76” on
the 12/1/1891. #
The “Argyle Lodge” was chartered as No. 55 on the
19/1/1888, under the Scottish Constitution. At the union
it became No. 171 U.G.L. of N.S.W. It amalgamated with
the “Duke of Edinburgh Lodge No. 76” on the 24/4/1889.
On the 16/9/1907 the “Goulburn R. A. Chapter No. 18” was
established under the S. G. Chapter of N.S.W. The “Goul-
burn Lodge of Mark Masters” was chartered as No. 28
under the N.S.W. G. M. Lodge on the 17/11/1911. A “Lodge
of Ark Mariners and Council of Knights” was formed on
the 20/6/1919 and attached to the “Duke of Edinburgh
R. A. Chapter No. 208 S. C.”
At a meeting of Master Masons held on the 11/8/1924
a motion was carried calling a meeting for the 30/8/1924
for the purpose of drafting a petition seeking permission
to form a new lodge in Goulburn. That Lodge was the
“William Ross No. 550.”f On the 4/12/1937 an “Ark
Mariners’ Lodge” was formed, No. 28 attached to the Goul-
burn Lodge of Mark Masters, N.S.W. Constitution. In

March 1940, the “Canberra Chapter Eose-Croix, 18° ” was
formed in Goulbnrn as No. 334 E. C.
On the 12/2/1890 the “Duke of Edinburgh Lodge No. 76”
joined with “Lodge Tuscan No. 32” and “Lodge Australia
No. 56” in purchasing the Bourke Street site. The first
Masonic Temple was designed by E. C. Manfred and built
by W. J. Lansdown at a cost of £9OO. It was opened on
the 20/3/1891.* It has since been largely rebuilt.
The Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes, Southern
Cross Lodge, No. 3, was established at the Emu Inn on the
11/4/1885. f In 1890 the Buffaloes complained that their
ball was not reported although they had invited the press.
The newspaper rejoined that it had sent a reporter but that
he had not returned, nor turned in a report, nor had any
tidings been heard of the missing man. “We fear the
hospitality of the Buffaloes has been too much for him.”t
The “No. 3. Southern Cross Lodge” of the R.A.O. Buf-
faloes advertised in 1889 for “a large number of Buffaloes
.... there being a further batch of unenlightened wretches
to be operated on.”
A second lodge of the R.A.0.8. under the “English Ban-
ner” was opened at the White Horse hotel on the 13/2/1890. §
On the 5/9/1881 “in compliance with a requisition
signed by a number of gentlemen” a meeting was held in
the Hibernian Hotel to form a lodge of the United Ancient
Order of Druids. Bro. Wm. Clark was appointed Arch-
druid. The lodge was named “Iceni No. 132.” Dr.
Carroll was appointed doctor. Its funds were banked in
the Oriental Bank. The first two meetings were held in
the Hibernian Hotel, after that the lodge met at the Temper-
ance Hall. A torch-light procession and quadrille party in
1882 resulted in a loss, nevertheless the lodge decided to
join the “Star of the South” lodge in another. In 1890
the lodge was meeting in the Y.M.C.A. rooms. The Druids’
Hall in Goldsmith Street is an old unpretentious structure.
Its history is obscure. It figured prominently in the Tem-
perance and Local Option campaigns of the eighties and
nineties. 11

A branch of the Ancient Order of Foresters was estab-
lished in Goulburn on the 15/10/1915. The chief ranger
was Bro. R. Woodhill, treasurer, Bro. J. Frazer, and sec-
retary, Bro. J. H. Oehlers. The branch was the “ Court
Star of Goulburn, No. 9333. ” Dr. Gillespie was its medical
officer.*
There were two branches of the Grand United Order of
Oddfellows functioning in Goulburn in the seventies. The
“Star of the South, No. 1605” (established 12/11/1873), and
the “Loyal Argyle, No. 2013.” A little later a third branch
“The Pioneer” was formed at North Goulburn but of this
no records remain. It is said to have been formed during
the building of the gaol and to have been comprised mainly
of bricklayers employed upon that contract. Bro. Phil
Thomas was a prominent member. In 1900 a ladies’ lodge
was formed, the “Rose of Goulburn.” On the 10/6/1910
the “Loyal Argyle” and the “Rose of Goulburn” amal-
gamated with the “Star of the South.” Bro. Tom Gray
was the first secretary of the “Star of the South.” Bro.
H. C. Cox (town clerk) was secretary of the “Loyal Argyle”
for many years. Nurse James was the first secretary of
the “Rose of Goulburn.”
At the time of the amalgamation of these branches Bro.
J. W. Fielding was elected the first Noble Grand, Bro. A. E.
James, secretary and Bro. J. B. Cox, treasurer. Meetings
in the early days of the original branches were held in the
Protestant Hall. Bros. R. Ward and Phil Thomas have a
record of membership extending over 63 years.f
A branch of the Manchester Unity 1.0.0. F. was estab-
lished in Goulburn on the 7/2/1848, under the title of the
“Loyal Strangers’ ” Lodge No. 16, or the “Strangers’
Friend” some eight years after its introduction into Aus-
tralia. On opening it had a roll of 16 and funds amounting
to £23/3/-. It was attached to the Sydney District until
a new district was formed in 1856. The first officers of the
branch were Henry Fisher, John Howley, John Donavan,
Henry Baker, Henry Wilson, William King, Sterling Taylor,
William Kingsell, Robert Riley and E. Hilyard, with Dr.
Gerard as medical officer. The lodge met for many years
in different buildings. On the 18/8/1856 the Goulburn
* “E.P.P.,” 19/10/1915. tW. M. Hawkins, 1940.


District was established, the first Grand Master, James Snow-
eroft. On the 5/6/1860 another branch was established
under the title of the “Loyal Victoria Lodge No. 24.” This
lodge made rapid progress and soon outdistanced the original
branch. Geo. Murray, Paul Niell and Geo. Richards were
its trustees.
Another lodge, Goulburn No. 21 is mentioned in 1891.
The M.U. observed its Jubilee in 1898. In 1911 the
“Strangers” and “Victoria” Lodges amalgamated under
the title of the “Loyal Coronation” Lodge No. 16.*
At a visit of the Grand Master in 1898, Bro. Cornford
indulged in some reminiscences which in some respects do
not altogether agree with the foregoing. He said:
“Before No. 21 was formed there was another lodge in Goul-
burn, but it only lived for about three months owing to certain
unsatisfactory circumstances.... No. 21 had passed through
some strange vicissitudes. The meetings used to be held in
a garret and the master’s table was a box and his seat a gin
case. The next trouble that overtook them was that they lost
nearly all their funds in the Oriental Bank... .”t
Charles Fuller, who died on the 16/10/1909 at the age
of 71, was for 44 years secretary of the M.U.1.0.0.F. in Goul-
burn. The Goulburn District erected a monument to his
memory in the old Methodist cemetery.^
In 1877 the Oddfellows made the first move towards
building a hall of their own. E. T. Blacket was the archi-
tect. The tender of T. Wilkie and Sons for £4205 was
accepted in 1882, and the hall was built in 1882/3 at a cost
of £4672. For years it was the main public hall in Goul-
burn and many notable meetings were held and perfor-
mances given there. The building was disposed of by the
1.0.0. F. and now, much altered, forms the foyer of the
Empire Theatre. §
The Loyal Orange Lodge “City of Goulburn” No. 61
was founded on the 28/7/1871. Its records do not shew
who was its first W.M. or its first secretary. The second
lodge “Star of Peace” No. 83 held its first meeting on the
3/10/1872. It was at work in 1876 and still in being in
1878, when the W.M. of the “City of Goulburn” was Wor.
Bro. W. Martin and its secretary Bro. W. C. Martin, and

the W.M. of the “Star of Peace” was Wor. Bro. W. S.
Foxall, and its secretary Bro. W. Hart. These two lodges
amalgamated in 1898 as L.O.L. No. 61 under Wor. Bro. J.
Bushell as W.M. and Wor. Bro. D. Mclnnes as secretary.
A ladies ’ lodge “Pride of Argyle” No. 379 was opened in
1908. Subsequently it also amalgamated with No. 61. On
the 9/3/1927 a juvenile lodge, “Hope of Goulburn,” No. 107
was formed. This was the first juvenile lodge in the
district.
District Lodge No. 30 was formed on the 24/10/1928
with Goulburn as its headquarters, Wor. Bro. the Rev. Ellis
Thomas was its first W.M. The district embraces a large
area and includes all lodges from Picton to Queanbeyan, in-
cluding Crookwell and Canberra.
The Royal Black Association was founded in Goulburn
when a R.P.B. (Royal Black Preceptory) was opened on the
26/3/1875 with a hundred members. John Lumsden was
the first Wor. Sir Kt. and W. Randall the first registrar.
A Royal Black Preceptory of the Provincial Grand
Chapter of the Royal Black Knights of the British Common-
wealth, was opened in Goulburn, as No. 371, in 1883. It
is still in being though now known as “The Crown of Gold”
No. 576. It is an order akin to the Masonic order but
differing from Masonry in that it holds a Trinitarian creed
and membership is confined to Orangemen.
The “Argyle Royal Standard” L.O.L No. 154 was
opened at Run of Water in 1878. In 1879 it was meeting
at Bangalore; in 1880 at Run of Water, and in 1884 at
Collector where it continued to meet for many years.*
The Protestant Alliance Friendly Society “Belmore
Lodge” Branch No. 10 was founded in 1872. Its first
annual meeting was on the 12/8/1873. There were then
140 members. A. E. Osborne was W.M., John Hodges,
treasurer, and F. W. Johnson, secretary. Arthur Mason
who joined in 1879, was still a member in 1939. The Loyal
Orange Benefit Society of Australia, “Bismarck Lodge” No.
3 was functioning at least from 1876 to 1882. The “Star
of Bethlehem” was a ladies' lodge. This amalgamated with
the “Bismarck” and the “Bismarck” amalgamated with the
“Belmore. ”f

A Second Branch of the Protestant Alliance Friendly
Society, No. 43 was formed on the 1/2/1876, with a member-
ship of 18. Hy. Hollis was W.M., and Joseph Henry Lee,
secretary. Its history is now obscure. “No. 17 Havelock
Lodge, Goulbnrn District ” of the Protestant Alliance
Friendly Society was dissolved by the Grand Executive of
the Society on the 21/4/1876, it “ being unable to fulfil its
requirements.” Lodges 10 and 43 were functioning as
usual.*
A branch of the Australian Natives’ Association was
formed in Goulbnrn on the 4/8/1939. The first president
was C. A. Hawkins, and the first secretary John R. Stamm.f
The Sacred Heart Branch No. 164, Goulbnrn, of the
Hibernian Australian Catholic Benefit Society, was estab-
lished on the 9/10/1882, by dispensation from the Melbourne
Directory. The first president was John Brooks and the
first secretary Jacob Knopp. The branch exercised a salu-
tary discipline, reprimanding and fining officers absent
without apology. The branch seceded from Melbourne and
joined the Sydney district on the 17/5/1886.
In 1884 the branch identified itself with the annual St.
Patrick’s Day celebrations in Goulbnrn and ever since then
has organised the sports and demonstration. Later the
A.H.C. Guild joined forces. In 1890 the executive was
criticised for advising the branch to accept the invitation
of the Orange Lodge to attend its annual social. The chap-
lain thought the branch would have done better to attend
the mission. In 1892 the branch was in financial difficulties
owing to arrears of dues and contributions. A levy of 5/-
per member was struck and those members who did not pay
up were sued in the Small Debts Court.s
J. F. O’Neill contributed some years ago a series of
interesting articles to the “Freeman*s Journal” on the early
history of the branch, extracted from its own minute books
and records. The branch celebrated its jubilee on the
17/7/1932.
A Friendly Society Association was formed in 1939.
R. Lockwood was the first secretary. §

SCHOOLS.
HERE have been schools in Goulburn from 1839. In
that year an Anglican and a Presbyterian school were
opened. A Roman Catholic school was functioning
in 1854 if not earlier and a Methodist and a Baptist school
at an equally early date. At the same time there was a
number of proprietary, private and dame schools, one at
least of which was established in 1841. A “National”
school followed in 1862. Some of these private schools were
important secondary colleges. They nearly all disappeared
until to-day there are only the Government primary, second-
ary and technical schools, the Convents and Christian
Brothers’ schools of the Roman Catholics and the Pres-
byterian Ladies’ College.
Denominational Schools: Anglican.
In March 1839, the schools were two, recently estab-
lished, conducted upon the Church of England National
School system, one for boys and one for girls. Both were
day and Sunday schools. The master (J. Whitlaw) was
an Anglican, and the mistress (Jane Buchan) a Methodist.
There was also a Presbyterian Sunday School. There were
17 boys and 18 girls in the day schools:
“of whom 7 boys and 9 girls could read the New Testament,
not above 4 boys and 2 girls could write, and not one is acquaint-
ed with arithmetic. The children generally can repeat the
Catechism, but not very correctly. Many of them are well
acquainted with Watts’ hymns. Mr. Sowerby instructs them
on Religious subjects on Friday and Sunday mornings.”*
In 1840 Bishop Broughton reported:
“The Rev. W. Sowerby.... has established a good and pro-
mising school, in which he has under his instruction about six-
teen of the sons of highly respectable families, resident in or
connected with that vicinity.”!
A disgruntled correspondent, signing himself “Alpha”
protested in 1844:
“A Petition is being hawked round Goulburn for signatures,
its objective the promotion of the denominational system, in
other words the obtainment of money from the Government to
support a school under the supervision of the Church of Eng-
land.”!
* Burton, p. 235.

t “5.M.H.,” 31/10/1844.


However his figures did not agree with the census.
This denominational school was enlarged in 1850 and a
subscription list opened. The Bishop of Sydney gave all
the bricks required and the Rev. W. Sowerby three months
of his salary for attendance at the school.*
In 1858 the Diocesan Committee of the S.P.G-. and the
S.P.C.K. was providing £SO per annum towards the salaries
of the master and mistress at the Goulburn school and £2O
for rent.f That old denominational school building still
stands, not very much altered, as No. 10 Church Street. The
late John Walsh wrote of it:
“The teacher in 1851 was Mr. Fairman. He was succeeded
by Mr. T. Kirke and I was a pupil there for twelve months.
Mr. Kirke was painstaking and tried his utmost to inculcate a
good education and right principles of conduct in the children
under his charge. There were two departments, one for girls
and boys combined, and another for infants, the latter being
under the charge of Miss May Hollis. On his retirement from
the School Mr. Kirke started in business as a stationer and book-
seller. His successor at the school was Mr. W. Stronge, who
remained in charge until the passing in 1880 of the Public
Instruction Act, which abolished State aid to denominational
schools, the school was then closed ”
C. R. Walsh, Prothonotary of the Supreme Court for
many years, was educated here. W. H. Maybury, father
of C. E. Maybury, Sheriff of N.S.W., was the schoolmaster
from 1853/18574 These recollections of John Walsh are
not quite correct. W. Stronge was succeeded by Henry
Goldsmith and this school was closed in 1876.§ The North
Goulburn Church of England Day School was founded by
Canon Leigh in the early sixties and was held in the first
church in Union Street (built in 1861 and now Sullivan’s
cordial factory). The schoolmaster’s name was Robinson.
Another was Carew. Robinson was moved to Tirranna,
where he died in the seventies. The school was still open
in 1877 but expecting to close when the public school was
completed. The St. Saviour’s Day School was functioning
in the seventies and eighties with H. Goldsmith as master,
Miss C. Stoyles in charge of the infants and Miss Mitchell
a pupil teacher. The enrolment was 52 girls and 64 boys
in 1881. Its certificate was surrendered by the Anglican
authorities in that year and the school was continued as a

public school until the completion of the South Goulburn
Public School.* The Bishopthorpe High School was estab-
lished by Bishop Barlow and opened in Old Bishopthorpe
in 1906 with Sister Katherine Nichols in charge. In 1910,
on the resignation of Sister Katherine, negotiations were
opened up with the Sisters of the Church with a view to
their taking over the school. Local prejudice was too much
and the opportunity was missed. Miss Galloway was en-
gaged to carry on. In 1911 the school was moved to
“Bindagundra,” Goulburn. An effort to float the school
as a limited company was a failure. In 1912 the school
closed with a nett loss of £771. Out of the wreck of the
Bishopthorpe School the late Archdeacon Bartlett began a
small primary school in St. Saviour’s Church Hall, in charge
of Miss C. M. Davis. This developed into a secondary
school and in 1915 was launched as a limited company, the
Church of England Girls’ Grammar School. Unfortunately
little of its capital was ever subscribed. The school had a
promising run until 1920 when it closed down through finan-
cial difficulties. It was housed first in “Gouldeena,” and
‘‘Glandulla” (the latter next door) and then in “Gould-
deena” alone. Thus of these five Anglican schools not one
remains.!
Denominational Schools: Roman Catholic.
Before the passing of the Public Instruction Act there
was a Roman Catholic denominational school. It stood in
Bourke Street on the site of the present St. Brigid’s Convent
School. In 1857 T. D. Sullivan was the teacher. M. Hur-
ley was the headmaster from 1872 to 1875. He opened a
“night school” on the 2/3/1874. Donnelly succeeded him.j:
In 1879 Jacob Knopp was the schoolmaster. The school
closed in 1880 when, under the Public Instruction Act, all
such denominational schools were closed.
The foundation stone of St. Patrick’s College was laid
by Archbishop Folding in 1873. The main portion of the
building was blessed and opened on the 1/2/1874. The
architect was A. Stombuco. The College had as its first
president the Very Rev. Fr. Dunne, V.G., who was succeeded
a year later by Fr. Gallagher, who later on followed Dr.

Lanigan as Roman Catholic Bishop of Gonlburn. In Dr.
Gallagher’s term St. Patrick’s was the first Roman Catholic
college in the State to send students for the University ex-
aminations. The school was handed over to the Christian
Brothers in 1897. Dr. James McGee, the television expert
received his education here as did Dr. E. O’Donnell, presi-
dent of Springwood. A half-page picture of the first
portion of the college, the hexagonal centre with its three
radiating wings, appeared in the “Illustrated Sydney News”
in 1874. This portion was built of rubble stone with
Wingello freestone dressings. The builders were W. Dun-
can and F. Horn. The Dr. Gallagher Memorial wing was
built in 1923. Considerable extensions were undertaken in
1939, at a cost of £15,000. These included a new service
block of two storeys which were blessed and opened by
Bishop McGuire on Sunday, February 18th, 1940. The
inaugural appeal on that day yielded £2414/12/- of which
F. G. Leahy and family gave £2OOO. #
On the 28/10/1859 a number of the faithful and other
Gonlburn residents gathered at the foot of Governor’s Hill
to welcome Archbishop Folding, Abbot Gregory and five
Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters had left Ireland in the sail-
ing ship “Saldanka” five months before. The Sisters were
accommodated at the presbytery until a convent could be
built. Due to the Rev. Dr. McAlroy’s exertions, the Sisters
took possession of their convent, free from debt, on the
18/7/1862. From the first the Sisters undertook the schools
for boys and girls. Dr. McAlroy secured three cottages
in Bourke Street and transferred there a boarding school
previously conducted by the Misses Moon in Yass. Goul-
burn was then the first inland convent in Australia. This
was the beginning of what is now Our Lady of Mercy Col-
lege. The institution grew until the present range of
buildings were completed. It was the first country convent
to enter students for the junior University examinations.
This was in 1882. In later years it was among the first
to be registered as a secondary school. The Sisters of St.
Joseph came to North Gonlburn in 1882 and were appointed
by Bishop Lanigan to take charge of the parochial school
in that part of the city. “St. Joseph’s School of Industry”

was established by Bishop Lanigan as "a middle class board-
ing school” on the 15/5/1881. Steady progress was made,
first in primary education, then in secondary. Later a
boarding establishment was added. The school buildings
were extended in 1940 at a cost of £IO,OOO and a chapel
built to the memory of Fr. Julian Tenison Woods. Geo.
Troy was the contractor.*
The Patrician Brothers conducted "St. Columba’s High
School” in the late eighties, in a stone cottage on the north
side of upper Montague Street.! In recent years two large
primary schools have been opened, St. Patrick’s for boys,
in Verner Street, and St. Brigid’s for girls, in Bourke Street,
both adjoining the Cathedral. In the building at the rear
of St. Patrick’s which also houses the diocesan library, a
technical school is conducted.
Denominational Schools: Presbyterian.
A school was opened in connection with the Presby-
terian Church and under the control of the Kirk Session on
the 15/4/1839. The teacher’s name was Fraser. It opened
with eight scholars. Three months later there were twenty.
It lapsed in April 1840. It reopened on the 16/6/1841 again
with twenty scholars. This school too lapsed in June 1842,
"not being sufficiently supported by Presbyterians.” In
1846 the Rev. W. Hamilton issued a circular to ascertain
the possibility of starting a boarding school, but was unable
to secure sufficient pupils to justify the venture. Another
Presbyterian School (master, Balmain) was examined on
the 29/6/1849 by the Rev. Wm. Ross “in accordance with
the regulations of the Board.” The curriculum was "the
Normal System of Education.” Mrs. Balmain taught fancy
needle-work. The advertisement of another Presbyterian
school appeared in 1850. It was opposite the Royal Hotel
and was conducted by A. Wilkinson and his wife. The
"first quarter’s examinations” were held in June 1850. In
1857, the teacher was W. Harris. The Rev. John Ayling
had charge of the school in 18614 The Rev. George Tulloch,
minister of St. Andrew’s, Goulburn, from 1916 to 1923,

secured in 1920 the assent of the Presbyterian Assembly to
the purchase of “Euthella,” the home of the late A. M.
Betts and 41 acres adjoining, for a Presbyterian Ladies’
College. He was successful in obtaining over £4OOO in
direct gifts as well as some thousands of pounds on loan.
The college was opened on the 12/2/1921. The official open-
ing was performed by the Governor, Sir Walter Davidson,
on the 25/3/1921. It began with an enrolment of 40, 19
of whom were boarders. Brigadier-General W. R. McNicoll
was the first principal and remained as such until 1932. The
school buildings have been extended three times: in 1924
(architects John Reid and Sons, Sydney) ; in 1925 (archi-
tects Power and Adam, Sydney) and 1938 (architects Man-
fred and Son, Goulburn). Miss Christina Bryant, M.A.,
Dip. Ed., followed General McNicoll. The enrolment in
1938 stood at 121. The curriculum includes all subjects
common to secondary schools plus a commercial course, arts
and crafts and speech-craft. A new wing, consisting of a
dining hall, extended sleeping accommodation and dressing
rooms was opened on the 31/8/1939. The boarders then
numbered 70.*
Denominational Schools: Methodist.
There was a Methodist denominational school, but its
dates are uncertain. It was closed when State aid was
withdrawn. A number of prominent citizens received their
primary education here, including the late C. W. Furner.f
Denominational Schools: Baptist.
Several schools have been held in the old Baptist chapel
in Clifford Street, one at least at an early date. Nothing
is known of them now or of their relation to the Baptist
communion, if any.
Mrs. Elizabeth Johnson is said to have conducted the
“only girls’ day school for years in the Baptist Chapel.”
She died in San Francisco in December 1876. Its dates
and history are obscure, nor is it clear whether it was
registered as a Baptist School or not. McDonald’s School
is also referred to as the Baptist school but this was probably
a private venture. X

Private Schools:"
The difficulty of reconciling the reminiscences of the
oldest inhabitants arises particularly in the matter of schools.
According to a writer in the local press, one of the earliest
schools in Goulburn was that of Mr. Gandon, in Grafton
Street, North Goulburn, and the date he gives for its estab-
lishment in 1839. f The late Chas. MacAlister, however, gives
the name as “Sandon” (again without any Christian name)
and the date when it was “opened as a boarding and day
school” as 1842. Both were wrong for the registers of old
St. Saviour’s Church give the name over and over again as
“Edward Sanden. ” One of the earliest references to him as
a schoolmaster is in 1841. Fr. Brennan complained in 1844
that the Church of England clergymen having less distance to
cover mostly conducted schools and when it suited them
taught Roman Catholic children of poor parents free, ter-
minating the arrangement arbitrarily later. The next day
Fr. Brennan wrote that he was not referring to “so respect-
able a person as Mr. Sowerby.” Finally Sanden, the pro-
prietor of “The Goulburn School” assumed that he was
meant and denied all the statements-^
There is said to have been a “Dame” school in Sloane
Street at a very early date and before that of Mrs. Ross.
No details are available. An advertisement of 1846 ran:
“Wanted three young men as boarders, £25 a year. Attention
paid to morals and deportment as well as all English subjects.
A.8., P. 0., Goulburn.”s
Those were the first private schools. The remaining
schools will be noted alphabetically, not chronologically.
Miss Anderson, with Miss Sutton, 8.A., took over the
“St. Kilda” School changing its name to “Hadleigh” in
1905. The Misses Armsby opened a private school in the
Baptist Chapel in 1881. Miss Barber had a “Ladies’ School”
at “Orbliston,” Clifford Street in the eighties and nineties.
She called it “Linburn” and then “Alma” later. She sold
out to Miss Whitton. Mrs. Benson conducted a school at
West Goulburn. She called it “Eversley.” It was in
Deccan Street. This was in the eighties and nineties. Mrs.

Campbell opened her “Rosebrae” School in Sloane Street
on the 12/9/1898. Mrs. E. S. Costello, 8.A., advertised a
“ladies’ class” for “the study of English literature” at
“Glenlara,” Victoria Street, in 1904.
C. Cotching conducted a small preparatory school in
Clifford Street in 1892. Before that he was the secretary
of the Y.M.C.A. and then pastor of a short-lived Congrega-
tional Church. James Cutter was probably the first teacher
of shorthand in Goulburn. He opened a school in Clifford
Street in 1875, for “phonography, grammar, mathematics,
architecture and mechanics.” His first advertisement was
a full column of explanation of “Mr. Isaac Pitman’s sys-
tem.” Later he opened a night school. Later still he
introduced a correspondence course. His subsequent ad-
vertisements were the most extraordinary mixture of reli-
gion and feeble humour. His qualifications would appear
to have been slight and acquired at a “chemical works” and
in “building railway structures.” Miss Davis and Miss
Studdy, 8.A., took over Miss Whitton’s “St. Werburgh’s
College” in 1897 and renamed it the “High School.” This
was the first scholastic venture in Goulburn of Miss Davis,
who was to continue teaching here for many years. There
is a memorial to Miss Davis in St. Saviour ’s Cathedral. Mrs.
Dawe (London) advertised in 1849 that she “will soon open
at No. 5 Davis Buildings, back of R. C. Chapel.” The Rev.
J. V. Dodwell, M.A., Oxon., had a school at the corner of
Clinton and Faithfull Streets in 1893. He advertised
“Grammar School and Private tuition.” W. Alex Duncan
had the “Hurstville” College for Boys in 1899. Mrs. Emric
opened a school in 1876, on the Yass Road, giving the Yen.
Archdeacon Puddicombe as a reference. In 1883, with her
daughters, the Misses Crakanthorp, she conducted a “School
for Young Ladies” in the St. Clair Cottage. Hardwick
Evans, 8.A., (Trin. Coll. Camb.) of 1 Lansdowne Terrace,
at first advertised that he prepared students for the Uni-
versity and the Civil Service. Later he called his estab-
lishment “The College” and catered for boarders and day
scholars. Later on still he “moved to Sloane Street (Mr.
Shepherd’s house.)” Mrs. Gillan had the Hurstville Col-
lege for girls in 1899. The first grammar school was at
the corner of Auburn and Clinton Streets and was conducted
by D. Patterson. His advertisements read quaintly nowa-


days. The first notified that Mr. Patterson, late head of
Sydney College, had opened a school in Goulburn. He
“notified future patrons” that “his system of discipline will
be mild.” That same mildness was to apply to the general
regulations and “becoming deportment in the school room
and play ground.” Later he decided to cut out the winter
vacation as boys can study then “rather than in the heat.. .
This extra study will greatly assist the Christmas examina-
tions.” It removed in 1852 from Goulburn “to the Old
Township in Mr. Gould’s house.” Patterson was a severe
disciplinarian. D. Sinclair writes that his father “used
to entertain me with tales of his severity, and the practice
of having the delinquents hoisted on the back of a big lad
during the flagellation.” In 1850 W. Chisholm is described
as “Rector.” In 1856 W. Chisholm advertised that he had
secured the services of the Rev. D. P. M. Hulbert, M.A., as
a master. Either before or after this arrangement or both,
Mr. Hulbert had his own school. The second grammar
school was a proprietary school, established by W. Chatfield
and a committee of local residents in 1859, in premises sub-
sequently purchased by the government and which formed
the nucleus of Bourke Street School. Mr. Hawkins, 8.A.,
was the first headmaster. In 1863 S. Harborne Belcher
was appointed headmaster and moved the school out to
Garroorigang in 1868. Ernest Lamb, K.C., Sir Harry Chau-
vel, H. H. Massie, Dr. E. Fairfax Ross, Wm. Teece, M.L.A.,
C. E. Maybury (sheriff), C. R. Walsh (prothonotary), and
Richard Teece (A.M.P. actuary) were amongst the pupils.
In 1868 the buildings and grounds of the original school in
Bourke Street were transferred to the Council of Education
as a public school for the sum of £2000:* Yet a third school
of this name was opened on the 14/7/1879 by the Rev. R.
Newton Morris in the “Scotch Church Schoolroom.” The
Rev. A. M. Tait (Presbyterian) signed the advertisement.
In 1883 H. C. Baker was the headmaster of this school.
A curious announcement stated that Wm. Harris had taken
large premises at 5 Clifford Street, 5 doors from Sloane
Street and would conduct a school for boys and girls, even-
ing classes 6to 8 p.m. “Drawing lessons given in private
houses. Arms, initials or gold plate neatly designed.”
* Memo. Dept. Educ. 1939.


The Rev. W. J. Hillyear, 8.A., contemplated, if not es-
tablished, a “Classical and Mathematical School’ ’ in 1853.
Hillyear, who was an Honours graduate of Brasenose Col-
lege, Oxford, advertised that he “has taken a house in
Goulburn to open a school in October.” In the meantime
enquiries were directed to be made of “Mr. Hillyear, Brase-
nose Hall, Cook’s River, or the Rev. W. Sowerby, Goul-
burn.” The school was described as “within ten minutes
of everywhere.” Two further advertisements appeared,
one directing boarders to bring “bed or stretcher with bed-
ding, 1 quilt, 4 sheets, 4 towels and 2 pillow cases,” the other
seeking a resident master. Miss Harrison conducted a
school at West Goulburn. This was in the old Salvation
Army citadel, then at the corner of Coromandel and Addison
Streets. Robert Hobson had a “night school” in the Clif-
ford Street school-room in 1874. The Misses Hollis managed
a school at “Hawthorn,” Goulburn. T. D. Holme had a
school in the eighties but the only appearance traced of this
name in the advertising columns of the local press is an
intimation that “there will be no vacation this quarter.”
The Rev. D. P. M. Hulbert, M.A., (Camb.) opened a
school for boarders and day boys in 1855, in a two-storey
building still standing at the corner of Clifford and Bourke
Streets. Hulbert was a scholar but did not possess the
qualifications necessary to make a successful schoolmaster.
Hulbert was assistant at the grammar school in 1856 and at
the same time was advertising “will instruct adults over 18
years of age in mercantile book-keeping.” His advertise-
ments were delightful. He advertised that he “had been
urged to receive ladies as well as gentlemen of adolescent
years to remedy the defects of earlier education. ’ ’ He goes
on to describe that he has the refusal of another house, then
later he has secured two houses in Grafton Street. Later
still he takes two shops of Marsden’s in Sloane Street. He
discards the use of the “birch as unworthy of the enlight-
ened 19th century.” Still more quaintly he adds that “he
has fires instead.” He concludes by forbidding the un-
baptised amongst his students reading either the Old or New
Testaments, whilst the uncircumcised are to read the Old.
Another of Hulbert’s advertisements read:
“Schools. Should the premises used as a Grammar School
be leased to me, an English School will be established therein.
English fees, £6 and £8 per annum.
Rev. D. P. M. Hulbert, M.A.”


Some more of the Rev. D. P. M. Halbert’s scholastic
ventures are found in advertisements of 1871. He advertised,
e.g., “Clinton College/ ’ Clifford Street. Another extra-
ordinary advertisement concerning Hulbert will be found
under Matthew Kennett. Eight years later he was ad-
vertising “Queen’s College/’ “Saint Kilda House.” Tenders
were invited for the erection of a hall there by P. C. K.
Rowe, architect. Old hands state that his farm carts bore
all his names, degrees and scholastic achievements.
Miss Hunt’s “Rosebrae” School was in Goldsmith Street
in 1905. Mr. and Mrs. Harrington advertised in 1850 that
they were making extensive additions to their school and
were prepared to receive youths as boarders. References
were permitted to the Rev. W. Sowerby. J. David Sly,
M.A., LL.D., was the principal of the Hurstville College in
the eighties. Resident masters were H. C. Baker, A. Ballin
and H. C. Wilson. In 1897 Mrs. Gillan was the principal.
D. Kennedy, late of the Wagga Grammar School was head-
master in 1888. An important private secondary school
was King’s College, which was conducted with considerable
success for over 40 years. It was established in 1888.
Edgar W. Kelso, M.A., (Melb.) formerly a resident master
at Scotch College, Melbourne, was the first proprietor and
headmaster. The school was first established in “Carra-
warra,” Cowper Street. In 1890 it had 22 boarders and
80 day boys. Later it moved to premises on the Yass Road.
Later his brother Harry Kelso had it. The school closed
in 1920 largely through financial difficulties. It was offered
to various institutions, including the Anglican Church, none
of which was prepared to accept the responsibility. Miss
Kelly ran a very successful school in Bradley Street in the
seventies and eighties.* Matthew Kennett opened a school
at “Clinton House” Grafton Street in 1871. Later he was
in Clifford Street. Kennett advertised that the Rev. D. P.
M. Hulbert “will supervise” the “above school” while he
(Kennett) does the teaching. The teaching was to be
“purely secular” in spite of the fact that a clergyman was
“supervising it.” “No religious element will be intro-
duced.”
* Reminiscences Jacob Knopp.


Miss Lansdown and Mrs. A. Russell had the “Kirkside
School’ ’ in Sloane Street in 1888. Albermarle Layard’s
“Goulburn Academy” was a day and boarding school in
Clifford Street. Advertisements in 1848 sought to dispose
of this “Boarding School... .never less than 30 pupils at 35
guineas per year each.” With engaging frankness it was
described as “kept by a bachelor who cannot manage his
own domestic affairs and function as headmaster as well.
He would, therefore, like to meet an educated gentleman
with £l5O/200, etc.” Apparently the sale took place for
a little later appears the advertisement of Mrs. John Martyr
established in these premises. Layard’s “Goulburn
Academy” figured in the Court of Requests in 1848. M.
Gautrot with his wife Mme. Gautrot sued for their remunera-
tion as teachers of French and Music. Captains Rossi and
Hovell and Messrs. Edge and Lockyer were on the Bench.
Gautrot lost the case although he was the victim of sharp
practice. # The Rev. W. Locke, 8.A., (Corpus Christi. Camb.)
had a small school for boys in Yerner Street in 1875. J.
Macdonald or McDonald, the name is spelt both ways, ad-
vertised a “Boys’ Private School” in the old Baptist Chapel
in Clifford Street. This was in 1888. A little later he
called it the “Boys’ Seminary, Clifford Street” and had
added an “Evening Class for Young Ladies.” Mrs. John
Martyr had a boarding school for young ladies. It opened
on the 21/1/1850. Mrs. Martyr was “assisted by an ac-
complished Governess and a Master for Drawing and Danc-
ing.” The school was at “Mr. Marsden’s old home, opposite
Dr. Gerard’s.” Mrs. Martyr advertised in 1855 that she had
increased her accommodation by taking the cottage in Mon-
tague Street, “lately occupied by the Sydney Gold Escort
Company” and that she would “commence her school upon
a larger scale than first intended.” In 1856 she advertised
that she had “removed to a healthier site in Grafton Street,
at the entrance from Sydney to Goulburn.” Later that
year she moved to “Glenrock,” Marulan.
Miss Macnaughten conducted a school in the Presby-
terian school-rooms in 1890. She called it “Naghten Mor.”
G. Medcalf, M.A., called his institution the “High School.”
It was the chief school in Goulburn in the seventies. Sir

housed in Mandelson’s Hotel which was renamed for this
purpose “Goulburn House.’ ’ Mrs. Miller was advertising
her “Ladies ’ College” (Lansdowne Terrace) in the eighties.
She died, whilst a passenger on the “Iberia” at Ceylon. J.
Miller in 1873, advertised a “Night School, North Goul-
burn.” The Misses Moriarty conducted a school in the
Protestant Hall from 1901. Later they called it “Queen’s
School” and held it in the Church Hall. In 1903 it was
at “Milton” Church Street. Miss Oliver’s “Raeburn
School” was at the Masonic Hall in 1895. Miss E. Parsons
opened a preparatory school in Beppo Street in 1894. Later
she conducted “Elston” school “in the school-room at the
rear of the Wesleyan Lecture Hall.” Her terms in 1897
were 1/- per week. Miss Price and the Misses Renton
conducted a boys’ preparatory school at Lansdowne Terrace.
Later this was continued by the Misses Renton, who were
advertising in 1883. G. Rendall called his establishment
“The Conservatoire of Painting and Music.” He estab-
lished it in 1886 and extended it in 1887. Mrs. W. Ross,
wife of the Presbyterian minister, kept a girls’ school for
many years. At first it was in the Presbyterian manse in
Sloane Street, then in the house which is now 238 Cowper
Street, and later in her own house “Rossneath.” The school
was actually known as “Rossneath” for many years. Miss
Rotherham announced her intention of opening a day school
for girls in 1888 and a boarding school later. M. Russell’s
“Kirkside” school was advertising in 1889. Miss L. A. M.
Sharp taught the piano, organ, harmonium, harp, French
and drawing at the St. Clair cottage, Sloane Street. R.
Shrubsole was the proprietor of a preparatory school and
day and boarding school conducted at No. 4 Sinclair’s cot-
tages, Auburn Street. The school opened on the 9/5/1850.
A little later this was advertised as Mrs. Shrubsole’s “estab-
lishment for Young Ladies. A limited number of pupils,
Strict attention to morals. Intellectual and religious in-
struction in addition to educational.” For over twenty
years Miss Sweeting conducted a ladies’ school first in Mon-
tague Street and then in Bourke Street, for boarders and
day scholars. She was a sister-in-law of Theophilus Kirke.
Mr. and Mrs. Sigmont lived in Clinton Street. Mrs. Sig-
mont advertised a school in 1849. In some reminiscences
of the late John Walsh he speaks of the harmonium in old
St. Saviour’s Church as being played by a W. Sigmont;


“Who had a number of music pupils in the city. He was a
painstaking teacher and at times gave excellent concerts, assisted
by his wife, who was also a good musician. Among his
favourites were two comic songs, “The Little Fat Man” and
the “Monkey and the Nuts.”*
A dame school is said to have been conducted by some-
one of the name of Sparling. No further particulars have
been found.f Miss A. A. Studdy, 8.A., opened a school on
her own account in 1898, at St. Kilda, Beppo Street. Pre-
viously she had been in partnership with Miss C. M. Davis.
Miss E. Maud Ussher called her school “Redleaf Private
School. ” It was functioning for 16 years, at first in Mon-
tague Street, afterwards at the Baptist Hall. It closed in
1937. A very vague advertisement read:
“Scholastic.
T. Vaughan intends opening a day school in Monks Gully to
supply a great need for the many children in the district
growing up uneducated.
Apply T. Vaughan.”
No address was supplied. Miss Whitelaw advertised
that she taught “English, French, Music and Singing’ ’ in
1883. The Misses Warren had a school in Opal Street in
1893. The Misses Whitton conducted a “Girls’ College”
in St. Andrew’s school-room in the nineties. Their ad-
vertisement described it as “ conducted by English Ladies on
the system of the English High Schools.” Later they took
“Balmoral House.” Finally they bought out Miss Barber
and renamed “Linburn” “St. Werbergh’s College.” Alfred
Wilkinson’s “Goulburn Commercial School” was in Auburn
Street, opposite the Royal Hotel. “All branches of English
education” was his slogan. Mrs. A. Wilkinson also con-
ducted a school which she called a “Ladies’ Seminary,” in
connection with her husband’s “Goulburn Commercial
School.” She declared her intention to “devote her life
to instructing any young ladies placed under her care in all
English subjects.” The premises were the same as her
husband’s. Mrs. Wright’s “Ladies’ School,” was at
“Claremont House” Montague Street, from at least 1872/6.

Forbes, “Inspector of National Schools/ ’ was stationed at
Goulburn and resident in Auburn Street. § This was in the
fifties. T. Harris was appointed Public School Inspector
under the Council of Education in 1867. An acrimonious
controversy with George Gordon the school teacher at Crook-
well, as to whether his school was a denominational, a
National or an non-vested school enlivened the columns of
the Goulburn “Herald’ ’ and “Chronicle,” and the
“Church Chronicle” in 1866. He was succeeded by W.
Maclntyre in 1868. #
Public Schools:!
The Bourke Street Public School dates from 1868 when
the central block with the tower and part of the grounds
were bought for £2OOO from the Grammar School by the
Council of Education. The school was opened by Sir Henry
(then the Hon. Henry) Parkes on the 6/8/1868. Actual
teaching began before that, on the 11/5/1868. Parkes was
then President of the Educational Department. He was
given a banquet at Pay ten’s “Commercial Hotel.” The
tickets were £l/1/- each and were obtainable from Davies,
Gannon, Riley, Fox, Emanuel and Zouch, members of the
School Board. The arrangements were much criticised in
that the price and the time (noon) prevented “citizens,
mechanics, shopmen and clerks” (parents of the children)
from attending.!
The first headmaster was Matthew Kennett and assoc-
iated with him were Miss M. Wright (girls) and Miss A.
Cotton (infants). At the end of that year 324 pupils were
enrolled. Further ground was bought in 1877 from Wm.
Penny for £2OO and additional land still from Jane Lums-
den in 1890 for £llOO. In 1883 a new Infants’ Department
was built (Goode and Le Breton, contractors, £1805), in
1888 a new Girls’ Department (Goode and Son, £1567), and
in 1897 a new Boys’ Department (J. C. O’Brien, £2130).
The following have been the headmasters: Matthew
Kennett, appointed 1868; Edwin Banks and W. F. Nolan

The Department of Education resumed, and in 1939
demolished, seven detached and semi-detached cottages in
Clifford Street, together with the old factory of W. Steele
and Coy. This added about 1| acres to the playground
site. The houses demolished included the former “Rose
and Crown” Inn. Application for a school at South Goul-
burn was made in 1879. The school was opened by the
Mayor, Alderman Davies, on the 3/10/1881, in the presence
of Sir John Robertson and Sir George Long Innes. Wm.
Duncan was the contractor. J. Lumsden was the head
teacher and the initial enrolment was 87 girls and 65 boys.
A new boys’ school was built in 1908 and this later became
the primary department. The headmasters have been: J.
Lumsden 1881; F. Thistlewaight, 1884; J. Lumsden, 1885;
Walter Campbell, 1914; Albert Askham, 1923; Stan Small,
1924; J. D. Simon, 1924, Ed. Clancy, 1930; J. Mcllwraith,
1933; J. Craig, 1936. A school was applied for in East-
grove unsuccessfully in 1883 and 1884. The present
Eastgrove School was built and established in 1887. From
1900 the Department has called it “Goulburn East Public
School.” Approval for the school was given on the
22/9/1886. It was built in 1887 (cost £492, contractor, J.
O’Brien). It was built on acres of land subsequently
enlarged to 3 acres. It was opened in September 1887, with
an initial enrolment of 87. Extensive improvements were
carried out in 1931 at a cost of £I7OO. Headmasters have
been: W. Galloway, 1887; F. Longley, 1890; Alfred Stonham,
1904; J. E. Southwell, 1906; Cecil Collier, 1929; Phillip
Maher, 1934; Langdon Trotter, 1934; Birley Thorsby, 1934.
North Goulburn residents applied in 1875 for a school and
the Council of Education approved of the erection of a
school at the corner of Union and Lagoon Streets. The
first building was of rubble stone and accommodated 100
pupils. It was completed in 1877 (cost £ll7O, contractor,
Thos. Lee). Teaching began in 1877. There have been
subsequent additions to meet the growing needs. Head-
masters have been: Wm. Schultz (dates uncertain, probably
1877); Jacob Knopp, 1884; A. G. Morgan, 1920; A. W. Logan,


1921; J. F. O’Neill, 1922; Hubert Ford, 1925; L. Perry, 1929;
Thos. Roberts, 1933; Cecil Collier, 1937/41. Goulburn was
one of the three first centres to enjoy State secondary edu-
cational facilities. Bathurst and Sydney were the other
two. A Girls’ High School was opened by the Department
of Public Instruction in “Balmoral House,” Citizen Street,
in 1883, with Mrs. Margaret A. Vyner as headmistress. Fees
£2/2/- per quarter. Unfortunately the privilege was not
appreciated in Goulburn and the school was closed in 1886.
A Public High School for Boys was opened at the same time
and address. Headmaster, Alfred H. Davis, 8.A., fees £2/2/-
per quarter. The same remarks apply; the school was
closed in 1886. In 1905 the Bourke Street “Superior Public
School” was proclaimed as a “District School” and a two
years’ secondary course was provided. This prevailed until
the High School was established in 1913. From 1913 to
1927 the High School was conducted in the Goulburn Tech-
nical School. The present building was erected in 1926
and was in use as the High School in 1927. It stands upon
7$ acres of land dedicated in 1881. The building cost
£21,478. J. Burnett was the contractor. It was regraded
from third to second class in 1928. As designed it had an
assembly room, 10 class rooms, a laboratory, a demonstration
room, a library and staff rooms. In 1933 when all post-
primary work was placed under the control of the High
School, the assembly hall was converted into three class
rooms, the library was invaded and the overflow was con-
ducted at the Technical School. Headmasters have been:
C. Blumer, 1913; L. Penman, 1924; H. Walker, 1933.
Efforts were made to establish technical education in Goul-
burn in 1885, and classes under the board of technical
education were held at Goulburn by Mrs. Miller and Mr.
Anderson. The science classes were not a success. In
January 1886, A. J. Sach was appointed science and art
master. The classes were held in the committee room at
the Mechanics Institute. On the 1/9/1886 the first technical
school building was opened. This was built by the
Mechanics’ Institute. The event was celebrated with an
industrial exhibition which lasted for a week. All the ex-
hibits and the prizes were contributed by the citizens. In
December 1886, twelve students enrolled for an architectural
class. W. Hardwick was the teacher. In 1889 this ac-
commodation was doubled in size. In 1890 the Technological


Museum was established by J. H. Maiden, the Curator of
Museums, and was opened by the Hon. J. H. Carruthers,
then Minister for Education. In 1891 a workshop was built
by the government on the Mechanics ’ Institute land. In
1896 the fifth classes of the Goulburn schools attended there
for science. The present Technical College buildings were
completed in 1901 at a cost of £6789, (contractor, Wall and
Sons). Part of the site was purchased from Dr. Burkitt
for the sum of £655. They were opened by the Hon. J.
Perry on the 14/3/1901. A. J. Sach was in charge until
1913. Splendid new workshops were built in 1938 at a
cost of £10,494. All the usual commercial, scientific, trade
and domestic subjects are taught, including engineering,
plumbing and wool classing. P. Randall succeeded Sach
as registrar.* A. J. Sach contributed to the “Penny Post”
in 1931 a long article entitled, “In 1886 and After,” describ-
ing the beginning of Technical classes in Goulburn. Of
the classes at the Mechanics ’ Institute he said:
“the managing committee quickly let me know that I was a
possible danger to the buildings through fire and the use of
phosphorus in my chemical experiments was forbidden.”!
A local school-board was functioning in the seventies.
Wm. Conolly, J.P., was its chairman. This local board
advertised that it would be glad if:
“the Ladies of Goulburn city and district visit the school at
any time to see the children when engaged with their lessons.
Any suggestions the ladies may make to the Board will be favour-
ably considered.”!
It is interesting to note that it was William Teece,
M.L.A., for Goulburn, who secured the approval of the House
for the abolition of school fees and this in the teeth of the
opposition of Sir Henry Parkes and the Government^
The K.L.S.T. Scholarship is the form chosen by Goul-
burn residents to do honour to four long service headmasters
of the local departmental schools, Knopp, Lumsden, South-
well and Taylor. The funds raised by local efforts are used
to assist in the higher education of Goulburn children.
The scholarship first functioned in 1930. The trustees
are the Minister for Education, the Director of Education

being. The allowance is approximately £2O per annum per
scholar.
The government bought “Carrawarra,” at the corner
of Bradley and Cowper Streets, in 1915, and conducted it
for some years as a hostel for girls attending the High
School. It made a considerable loss and was closed in con-
sequence* About the same time, from 1920 to 1927, the
Anglican authorities conducted a boys’ hostel at “Goul-
deena at the other end of Cowper Street. This was closed
through lack of parental support.!

CHAPTER XXL
MILITARY UNITS AND MATTERS.
HE first local military or semi-military unit was
formed on the 1/3/1865. It was a rifle club. Capt.
Zouch was its president. Goulburn was the first
inland city to form such a unit. The initial meeting was
on the 23/2/1865 when 29 joined. The first practice was
held in March. Twelve attended. Two months later a
match was held in Blackshaw’s paddock. A press con-
troversy between “Artilleryman” and “Cracksman” ensued
on the subject of the scores. At its first general meeting
there were 45 members.*
On the 4/11/1868 a meeting was held to receive the
report of a Provisional Committee, elected at a previous
meeting, to explore the possibility of a Goulburn Volunteer
Corps. The names of 100 persons willing to join were for-
warded to the O.C. Volunteer forces and the Colonial
Secretary promised to place a sum on the estimates on
account of clothing. The mayor, Maurice Alexander, M.P.,
and the committee moved with such expedition that before
the end of 1868 the company was in being with Captain
Finlay as O.C. The regiment was provided with colours,
the Mayoress canvassing the citizens for funds and the
ladies of Goulburn, mostly the wives of the officers and
N.C.O’s. making the flag.f
Although it now shews signs of its seventy years’ age,
that flag is still a beautiful thing, of white silk, with gold
tassels and cord. Emblazoned on it are the Royal Arms
surrounded by the motto: “Deo, Regina, Patria. 1869.” It
was first used at the ceremony of the planting of the oak
in Belmore Park by Lady Belmore on the 27/5/1869. The
flag was in the custody of Sergeant Monkley when not in
use. The regiment functioned for many years. It had
its ups and downs more especially when Captain Finlay
resigned and was succeeded by Captain F. R. L. Rossi. In
1871 the certificates of efficiency for 1870 were awarded.
“As each volunteer after serving five years becomes entitled
to fifty acres of land, he may look upon the certificate as equal
to a cheque for £10.”1

There was considerable traffic in these grants. Specu-
lators frequently obtained £2OO for blocks for which they
had only paid the volunteers £lO. The colours were finally
paid for, £3l/0/6, in 1872. The Goulburn volunteers and
band acquitted themselves most creditably in Sydney.
Rossi in the meantime had become so unpopular that a
public meeting in Goulburn on the 30/9/1872, presided over
by Mayor Davies, and attended by 600 citizens petitioned
the Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, to appoint a special
commission to enquire into Captain Rossi’s management of
the company.*
The case was referred to in the press as a “cause
celebre and the “Rossi nuisance” and as occupying
“nights of debate” in parliament, as becoming a “party
question” with a “significant appearance.” Eventually a
Select Committee was appointed to enquire into the whole
matter. The Select Committee reported that Rossi should
be relieved of his command. The Governor discovered that
the enquiry had not been held according to law. He ordered
a fresh Commission of volunteer officers to take evidence
afresh. The Government only narrowly escaped defeat on
a vote of censure. As it was the House refused to with-
draw its recommendation that Rossi should be dismissed.!
The Select Committee’s report was published in full
locally.^
The new Court of Enquiry consisted of Majors Shepherd,
Richards and Goodlet and sat in Goulburn. The charges
were many and various and occupied two columns in the
Goulburn “Herald” on the 3/1/1874, and five columns on
the 7/1/1874. The court sat from the 30/12/1873 to the
6/1/1874 and examined 35 witnesses. The court found:
“Because Capt. Boss! had over-rigidly applied military rule
he has caused trivial occurrences to become sources of irritation
Neither the Goulburn Corps nor anyone connected with it
is likely to be benefited by the retention of Capt. Rossi as
Commanding officer nothing should be done with the inten-
tion of inflicting punishment upon Capt. Rossi he has
worked not wisely but too well.”§
# The upshot of the whole proceedings was that Rossi
resigned dramatically as O.C. and the next day enlisted as
a private in the company he had previously commanded.

The troubles of the Volunteer Corps were not over then. In
1874 its accounts were such as “to puzzle a Philadelphia
lawyer.” “Private” Rossi was accused of applying
£l2/5/9 of the band money to pay for the colours. George
Martyr, private, dismissed by Rossi, was reinstated by Sir
Hercules Robinson in his capacity as Commander-in-chief.
An advertisement appeared calling a meeting of the Volun-
teers
“to devise means to raise sufficient funds to purchase a two-
penny Black-lead pencil to be presented to Sergeant Whiteshaw
to enable him to take the roll of the Company.”*
In 1875 the Municipal Council voted £2O for sowing
grass and other improvements to the parade ground in Bel-
more Square.
Captain Dignam was the subject first of a Court of
Enquiry and then of a court-martial in 1879. The charge
was neglect of duty more especially of the company’s ac-
counts. Private Rossi was the principal witness. He was
called upon to resign. That year the Government leased
Brooks’ paddock as a rifle range. In 1881 the old G.C.V.
Rifles were disbanded. Captain Norris was then O.C. The
band instruments were raffled, the colours given to F. R. L.
Rossi and the remaining assets, £l4O/2/4, distributed
amongst the men in proportion to the years they had served.!
A new corps the Goulburn Volunteer Infantry was
formed, Captain Blackshaw was O.C. Headed by the band
it marched out to “Rossiville” to present the colours to
Captain Rossi. Later it gave him an illuminated address.
After the death of Captain Rossi the Comtesse gave the
flag to Sergeant H. B. Monkley who in turn gave it to “G”
Company, 2nd Regiment, and it was then hung in the Drill
Hall. In 1883, forty men petitioned to be formed into
a second volunteer Infantry Corps. The Colonial Secretary
rejected the offer. In 1886 Dean Macartney of Melbourne,
preached in St. Saviour’s Cathedral to a Church Parade of
43 Volunteer Infantry (Capt. Blackshaw), 30 Cadets (Lieut.
Lumsden), and 23 of the Volunteer Fire Brigade (Supt.
Laws) 4

In course of time the Goulburn Rifles or Volunteer
Infantry were merged in the 2nd Australian Infantry Regi-
ment. The old flag of the former unit appeared upon
occasions, as for instance in 1912 when compulsory military
service was instituted and “G Coy.” 2nd Regt. became “B
Coy. ”of the 43rd. Its last appearance was on the
27/7/1912 when “G Coy. ” held its last dinner. The colours
were brought out, a procession was formed and to the
strains of “The Boys of the Old Brigade,” the company
marched round the hall with the flag at its head. Later
the O.C. of the 43rd offered the colours to St. Saviour’s
Cathedral Council and the same were accepted by the Vice-
Dean, Archdeacon Bartlett, acting for the Bishop. The
colours were solemnly laid up in the Cathedral at a Military
Parade on Sunday the 24th November, 1912.
Major Holdorf was in charge. Sergeant-Major Town-
ley carried the flag and attending it were four Sergeants
of the Old Rifle Corps, Sergeant Monkley wearing the
original scarlet uniform of 1869. Major Holdorf asked the
Vice-Dean to accept the colours. The Vice-Dean said:
This is no ordinary occasion On behalf of the Cathedral
Council, he accepted the colours in accordance with the old and
revered custom.... We accept them with very great pleasure
at your hands. ”
The colours were then unfurled and saluted, the bugles
rang out and the National Anthem sung. The press report
concluded:
“The colours will be hung in the Cathedral and it is hoped that
they will hang untouched for many years to come.”*
The wish was not fulfilled. For reasons which have
never been explained satisfactorily the colours were removed
by the Cathedral authorities in 1938. Thirty names were
enrolled in Goulburn in 1890 for a “Scottish Rifle Volunteer
Company” and all was in train for its formation. However
the authorities in Sydney would not sanction it. “G” Coy.
2nd Australian Infantry Regiment was formed about 1895.
Captain Blackshaw was O.C. It marched from Yass to
Goulburn on the 3/3/1899, its actual marching time 9 hours
40 minutes. Base records have no other information about
this unit until the 1/1/1911 when Major C. J. Holdorf was
its O.C.f

“E” Coy. of the 6th Regiment Australian Rifles was
formed in 1897, Major Blackshaw, V.D., was in command.
Captain McShane was O.C. in 1899 and in 1901. Base
Records have no information as to this unit. A public meet-
ing was held in 1898 to protest against the cancellation of
Captain Barrett’s commission as O.C. of “E” Coy. 6th Regi-
ment.*
The first move to establish a cavalry corps in Gonlburn
in 1891 was delayed somewhat by the desire of all who
enlisted to receive commissions. No one wanted to be a
trooper. A half-squadron of the Ist Australian Light Horse
was formed in 1897 in Gonlburn and the Regimental band
formed and stationed here. Warrant Officer Duncan of the
Royal Scots Greys arrived from India, his duties “including
band.” In 1899 the 4th camp of “C” South Eastern
Squadron consisting of the Gonlburn, Braidwood, Bungen-
dore and Michelago troops was inspected by the Governor
and Major-General French. Curiously enough the regi-
mental order does not mention where the camp was.
Detachments of the regiment fought in South Africa
and the King’s Colours carry the battle honour “South
Africa 1899-1902.” In 1903 the Ist A.H. was divided into
two regiments, the 3rd and 6th A.L.H. No. 1 Squadron of
the 3rd consisted of the Gonlburn, Braidwood and Araluen
troops. In 1912 the name of the regiment was altered from
the 3rd to the 11th. In 1918 the 11th L.H. became the 7th
L.H. The 7th L.H., A.I.F. was formed in 1914, and served
in Egypt, Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine as part of the 2nd
L. Brigade. Its strength was 4/500. From 1914 to
1919 over 4000 officers and men passed through its ranks.
Of all the officers who embarked in 1914 only one, Colonel
Richardson, returned and of the original N.C.O’s. only five
returned, all of them as officers. Sixteen battle honours
were awarded. Regimental camps and bivouacs were held
here in 1925, 1926, 1927, 1930, 1931, 1933 and 1934. Escorts
were provided for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester.
R.H.Q. the H.Q. Squadron, the H.Q., M.G. Troop and No. 1
M. Section M.G. troop (2 guns) were allotted to Gonlburn
in 1932. t

To return to other units, an attempt to form a half-
battery of artillery in 1890 was turned down by the Govern-
ment, as was one in 1900 to form a company of the Scottish
Rifles.
The strength of the military units in Goulburn in 1901
is shewn by the parade on the 2/2/1901 for the services on
the day of the funeral of Queen Victoria. The Ist Aust.
Horse paraded 18 strong plus its band, “G” Coy. 2nd. Regt.
45, “E” Coy. 6th Aust. Rifles 50 plus its band, and the School
Cadets 70.
Of militia units the 43rd Infantry “B” Coy. was the
first. Major C. J. Holdorf was O.C. in 1912. At the
present time the militia unit is the 3rd Battalion which has
its Headquarters here. The 117 th Howitzer Battery was
removed, with its guns from Goulburn to Sydney in 1929.
Excessive administration cost was the official reason.
Tim Superior Public School Cadet Corps was in being
in the eighties. Information is lacking as to when it was
actually formed. In 1888 J. Lumsden was commanding it
with the rank of Lieutenant. He also commanded the Goul-
burn Ex-cadet Infantry Corps that year. A senior cadet
corps was formed in 1890. The “Cadet Corps” was re-
established in 1895 under Captain Chas. Holdorf. The 12th
N.S.W. Senior Cadets were functioning in 1908, Major Lums-
den commanding. The (Anglican) Gordon Club Senior
Cadets (1909/1911) sent a cadet, now Major Kenneth Howell,
to the Coronation of George V. The compulsory system of
military training superseded the cadets on the 1/7/1911.*
The Goulburn Rifle Association, the Goulburn Volunteer
Rifle Association, the Goulburn Reserve Rifle Club and the
Goulburn Civilian Rifle Club all receive a good deal of
publicity from the eighties onwards. They were semi-
military organisations. The first rifle butts were on Black-
shaw’s paddock. The rifle range on the Town Common was
opened in 1888. Other Clubs were the Railway Ambulance
and the Towrang Rifle Club. These have a long and in-
teresting history, too long for inclusion here. The references
at the foot of this page give some indication as to the place
they occupied in the life of the city.f

The Drill Hall was built in 1899 when the original dedi-
cation of the site as a reserve for a market and water supply
was revoked.* A choice piece of departmental bungling
occurred in 1910 when the Department of Public Works
asked if the Town Hall could be used as a drill hall for the
compulsory trainees. The Council pointed out
“That there was already a drill-hall in Goulburn which will
doubtless be used for the purposes mentioned. ”t
The Goulburn contingent joining the Sudan force left
on the 17/2/1885. Enlistments totalled 23. Five members
died of disease. Nine were welcomed back on the 26th
June, 18854
The Goulburn members of the infantry unit for the
Transvaal sailed from Sydney on the 4/11/1899. The
second mounted contingent also contained Goulburn men.
Thirty-five police and other horses were sent from Goulburn.
There were Goulburn men in the Bushmen’s Contingent too.
Eighty men in all from the district enlisted of whom four
did not return. An advertisement signed by the Mayor
announced that:
“On receipt of official confirmation of the relief of Mafeking
the fire bell will be rung.”
A tremendous demonstration was staged on the
19/5/1900. The South African War Memorial in Belmore
Park was unveiled by the Mayor, W. R. Costley, on the
14/11/1904. It cost £2OO. §
Goulburn played a much bigger part in the war of
1914/1918. In 1915 a training camp was established in the
old show-ground and the greater portion of the men who
enlisted here was trained at the local camp. The O.C. was
Major Muhs. The Municipal Council assisted in the es-
tablishment of the camp. Every Saturday evening the men
in camp were entertained to tea in St. Saviour’s Hall, at
first by the women of the Cathedral congregation, later by
the city as a whole. Another group conducted a Club in
“Carrawarra” lent by the Government. It closed in 1916
after having spent £1742. E. A. Betts was its secretary.||

The Municipal Council spent £IOO on “recruiting pur-
poses’ ’in 1916. Several recruiting marches, notably the
spectacular march of “The Men from Snowy River” finished
here. Goulburn enjoyed a mild boom whilst the camp
lasted. Its streets were crowded at night whilst the mili-
tary picquets kept order. A little later on, when the
Federal Government was certain (mistakenly as it proved)
that its conscription proposals would be carried, a second
camp was started for those compulsorily called up. The
A.I.F. drilled in blue dungarees, the “Hughesiliers,” as they
were facetiously called in yellow. Yet another picquet ap-
peared upon the streets. The referendum was defeated and
most of the “Hughesiliers” went back into civil life. A
few of them enlisted.
The 6th reinforcements to the 56th Battalion gave a
flag to the Town Hall and the 7th to the 55th gave another
to St. Saviour’s Cathedral. This last flag has disappeared
in recent years. At the end of 1916 the Goulburn camp
was relinquished. It was a sorry and unnecessary muddle
on the part of the authorities. The senior officers retired
to civil life, most of the juniors enlisted in the ranks. In
its seventeen months’ existence 4500 men passed through the
camp. From 1915 onwards each departing contingent was
entertained and farewelled lavishly. Enlistments from
Goulburn city totalled 851; 134 were killed, died or reported
missing. Decorations won by Goulburn men included: 1
M.C. and D.C.M., 4 M.Cs., 1 D.C.M. and M.M., 1 M.S.M. and
M.M., 4 D.C.M’s. and 15 M.Ms. #
When the men returned they were welcomed with the
same generous hospitality as when they went away. The
Municipal Council distributed honour certificates to most of
them and made the first move towards the compilation of a
Goulburn roll of honour. Fifty of the Kenmore staff en-
listed and 10 were killed. The memorial which stands just
inside the Hospital gates was unveiled by General McNicoll
on the 23/3/1924. f It was built of Marulan granite by J.
Turner and Sons. The City war memorial was opened by
the Governor, Sir Dudley de Chair, on the 15/12/1925. The
Eastgrove citizens planted an avenue to the memory of
Eastgrove soldiers in 1919. The Mayor, the Town Clerk and

Senior Officers of the A.I.P. for the time being, were ap-
pointed the trustees of war trophies in Goulburn.
The Public Schools in Goulburn built two homes for
returned soldiers, and the Racing Club another. From 1920
first Archdeacon Bartlett and after his death Mrs. Bartlett
gave a dinner on Anzac Day each year to all returned
soldiers in Goulburn. Mrs. Mary Bartlett was awarded the
Certificate of Merit of the R.S. and S.I.L. in 1926. Arch-
deacon Ward collected £2400 in 1920 from C. E. Prell,
Colonel T. F. Rutledge, Dame Alice Chisholm and other
generous donors for the establishment of a Soldiers’ Club.
The Protestant Hall was bought and some £5/6000 spent
upon its alteration. A large overdraft was incurred which
took many years to extinguish. The Soldiers’ Club was
formed in 1921 and has functioned successfully in these
premises ever since. The local branch of the R.S. and S.I.L.
meets here also. A legacy of Mrs. Mary Bartlett’s finally
eased the financial position. When King’s College was
closed its Honour Roll was transferred to the Town Hall and
unveiled there on the 11/11/1922. Over 90 per cent, of the
boys who passed through the school in the previous twenty
years had enlisted. Since 1935 a pennant bearing the words
“Lest we forget” has been flown at the Town Hall upon
the death of a returned soldier. The caretaker’s cottage
at the War Memorial was built in 1935, £4OO of the cost
coming from the War Memorial funds and £7OO from an
advance from the Unemployment Relief Council.
W. J. Bartlett left the sum of £253/10/- to the Muni-
cipal Council
“for the improvement, beautification and upkeep (other than
lighting the same) of the War Memorial, the road and the
park appertaining to the same.”
About half the amount was spent upon tree-planting.*
The 3rd L.H. Regiment held a month’s camp at the Show-
ground in 1939. Some controversy was aroused by the
attempt of the A. P. & H. Society to charge a rental of £35
per week. £2600 was expended upon extensions and im-
provements to the Drill Hall early in 1940. f
As this book goes to press in 1941, the world war is
in its third year. It is obviously impossible to do more

than indicate Goulburn’s part to that date. Fifty men
comprised Goulburn’s first draft to go into camp with the
second A.I.F. Enlistments in the A.I.F. and R.A.A.F. were
then over 500. Others had been called upon for Home
service and large numbers were serving in the Militia. The
Returned Soldiers’ Volunteer Corps was formed on the
8/7/1940. Some 3000 helpers were enrolled in the National
Emergency Services, the Red Cross, the Voluntary Aid De-
tachment and the Women’s Auxiliary of the Lord Mayor’s
Fund. One hundred and four men arrived on the 10/7/1940
in the march from the Snowy River and formed the first
contingent to be encamped at the Showground. *
The Showground was taken over by the Military again
in 1940. From July 1940 to February 1941, it was occupied
by the 17th Training Battalion. By this time the Municipal
Council had spent £1250 and the citizens £2OOO on a Recrea-
tion hut, water supply, sewerage system and a camp kitchen.
The 17th Training Battalion marched out on the 7/2/1941.
The military authorities then announced that the ground
would not be required further. After strenuous protest by the
citizens they agreed to continue the camp and a mechanised
unit was sent here. The Anglicans and Roman Catholics
conducted canteens in the city for the troops.

CHAPTER XXII.
CHARITIES.*
T is extremely difficult to trace now all Goulburn’s
charitable enterprises of the past or even to give a
complete account of such as still exist. Goulburn sub-
scribed £6/12/6 in 1840, towards the statue of Sir Richard
Bourke in Sydney, Wm. Bradley remitting the amount/ A
charitable collection at the Baptist Church in 1842 is noted
in another chapter. One of the oldest charitable organisa-
tions in the city is the “Ladies ’ City Mission and Strangers’
Relief Society,” commonly known as the “Benevolent
Society.” This was first mooted by Alderman O’Brien in
1877. A few of its reports are in the Mitchell Library.
Mrs. Morriset was president in the nineties, Mrs. Annie
Grovenor was its inspiration for many years. The Minutes
of the Goulburn Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible
Society are extant from 1872. It formerly raised a good
deal more money and engaged in more activities than it
does now. Its presidents have included Captain F. R. L.
Rossi, and Wm. Davies, its council the clergy of all the non-
Roman Churches, C. S. Alexander, Wm. Conolly, Theophilus
Kirke, and other names mentioned over and over again in
this history/
A “grand torchlight procession” and “moonlight
parade” was held in 1878, for the benefit of the Seamen
strikers. Unfortunately the torches fell to pieces and the
proceeds did not agree with the attendance. In 1880, £4OO
was raised for the Irish Famine Relief Fund. The Muni-
cipal Council that year advertised the appeal for the Row-
land Hill International Memorial. J. W. Wombey and
Chas. Furner (both storekeepers and both sometime mayor)
launched an appeal in 1885 for the formation of a Dis-
charged Prisoners’ Aid Society in Goulburn. Later they
advertised for premises or land upon which to build for the
“Home of Hope and Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Society.”
However, only £l3O was subscribed and the larger scheme
had to be abandoned. The Society was dissolved in 1889.
* Except where stated otherwise, the facts in this chapter are derived
from the advertising columns of the Goulburn “ Herald/ 1 the
“Southern Argus/ 7 and the “E.P.P., 77 and the Municipal
Minutes from 1877 to 1941.
t “Monitor’ 7 16/3/1840. t B. & F. Bible Soc. 1872, et seq.


The sequel to all this was that 15 years later, in 1900, W. R.
Riley was made bankrupt. It appeared that he, with two
others, guaranteed the purchase of premises for the society
to the extent of £7OO. The society ceased to function, the
other trustees failed and Riley was sued for the whole
amount. A branch of the Prisoners’ Aid Society was
operating until recently. It held an annual meeting at the
time of the quarter sessions. It has been inactive for some
little while and efforts to revive it have failed. E. A. Betts
was its secretary for 16 years. Goulburn was not always
uniformly charitable. When the Soudan Contingent left:
“At St. Saviour’s Dr. Ellis occupied the pulpit and his sermon
had reference to the departure of the Australian troops for the
Soudan.... in the course of his sermon he lamented the apathy
of the people of Goulburn in contributing to the Patriotic
Fund.”
At a public meeting held on the 1/4/1887, £230 was
subscribed for the victims of the Bulli Colliery disaster;
£251/8/4 was raised for the destitute people of Bourke in
1890; £6O was given to the “N.S.W. Labour Defence Com-
mittee” during the Shearers’ strike that year and “Strike
Relief Rooms” were opened “opposite the White Horse
Hotel.” A Nurses’ Home “was in full swing” in 1891, the
sisters pledged to go “wherever required either in a paid
capacity or in the homes of the sick poor. ”
An Influenza Distress Committee did good work in 1891
when there were many deaths and much suffering as a result
of the epidemic of that year, £174/6/2 was spent resulting
in a deficit of £6O which was eventually wiped out by the
transfer of the Bourke Relief Fund balance in the Australian
Banking Company then in liquidation. There was some
friction between this committee and that of the Hospital.
The Queensland Flood Relief Fund was launched and sup-
ported in 1893. Much relief work was necessary and was
undertaken during the period of the Bank smashes. The
government issued a large number of passes to various gold
diggings and encouraged the working of old claims. Muni-
cipal and private charity supplemented these efforts. A
soup kitchen was opened in 1894.
The “Penny Post” true to its Free-trade principles
blamed the Protectionist tariff for the prevailing distress:


“For now when next he comes to town
He’ll meet a dismal group
Who’ll show this great protectionist
Protection finds them soup.”
The St. Vincent de Paul Society was established in 1895.
Charles Gillespie was its president. The Patriotic Fund
was launched during the South African War. At first it
hung fire. “The Churches were not in favour of the War
and had no sympathy with it.” # Later Goulburn was more
generous. In 1900 Goulburn contributed £3OO to the Indian
Famine Fund, “a shade less” to the Patriotic Fund, and £IOO
to the Victoria Home for Consumptives. There was an
appeal in 1902 for the widows and orphans of the Mount
Kembla, Wollongong, disaster.
A “drought relief fund” was organised in 1903. Some-
what sarcastically the “Penny Post” reported that two
meetings called to devise ways of assisting the victims of the
drought had lapsed for want of a quorum, but that a third
called to arrange for a public banquet to the Governor was
successful. A Bush Fire Relief Appeal in 1905 raised some-
where about £2OO. Ninety pounds were subscribed in ten
minutes to the “Dreadnought Fund” at a meeting in the
Town Hall on the 16/4/1909. Some controversy ensued
when the mayor, who convened the meeting, spoke against
the proposal. A few weeks later the total was £355/16/2.
A branch of the Aftercare Association (mental patients) was
formed in 1912. The N.S.W. Public Disasters’ Fund appeal
was given publicity in 1912.
Goulburn’s contributions to patriotic funds during the
war of 1914/1918 were very considerable. They included
the “Belgium National Fund,” “Allies’ Day Fund,” “War
Chest Fund,” “Red Triangle Day,” “Scottish Women’s
Hospital,” “Lord Mayor’s Patriotic Fund,” “Australian
Red Cross,” “Italian Red Cross,” “Jack’s Day,” “Homes
Day,” “Repatriation Day,” etc. In addition during the
time that the Goulburn camp was operating the citizens
conducted a Soldiers’ Club and various organisations, com-
mittees and Churches entertained and otherwise cared for
the men in camp and farewelled all departing drafts. In
1919 the men returning to Goulburn were similarly wel-
comed. Finally those war-time efforts of 1914/1918 were

co-ordinated by the “Goulburn War Service Committee/ ’
constituted under the State War Council. It encouraged
enlistments, devised means of furthering the welfare of
soldiers’ dependents, sought openings for discharged and
disabled soldiers, encouraged the settlement of returned
soldiers on the land and raised funds for all these purposes.
Mrs. L. A. Rankin, matron of the Girls’ Hostel died sud-
denly in 1920, leaving a seven year old son. Goulburn
subscribed over £4OO for his education and maintenance.
£157 was raised in 1926 for the “Cancer Research Fund.”
“The Penny Post” launched an appeal in 1927 for the in-
stallation of radio sets in the Hospital; £79/11/6 was given
to the Olympic Games Fund in 1928. The Bellbird Mining
Disaster Fund and the Australian-Japanese Relief Fund both
received support from Goulburn in 1923. Goulburn guaran-
teed £IOOO in 1929 to send its own de Haviland Moth to
North-West Australia to assist in the search for the
“Southern Cross.” Subscriptions for this purpose totalled
£lB7/9/-, expenditure £276/5/11. The guarantors were
called upon for the deficiency. An Auxiliary Relief Council
for the relief of the unemployed functioned during the fi-
nancial depression of 1933. The Roman Catholic Orphan-
ages in Goulburn date from 1881 when
“The building at the corner of Bourke and Clinton Streets,
formerly Hayes’ Mill has been purchased by the Catholic Bishop
for an orphanage for the diocese of Goulburn.”
The purchase price was £2400. The orphanage here
was blessed on the 15/5/1881. Out of that humble begin-
ning grew the large Boys’ Orphanage establishment at South
Goulburn. A meeting was held on the 30/7/1905, Bishop
Gallagher presiding, to devise ways and means of building
an orphanage at Kenmore; £2193 was subscribed on the
spot. The Boys’ Orphanage in Mundy Street was opened
and blessed by Bishop Gallagher on the 7/12/1913. E. C.
Manfred was the architect, and King and Armstrong the
contractors.
The Kenmore Orphanage was opened by Cardinal Moran
on the 18/11/1906. Then £3601 had been expended and
another £9OO was contemplated. E. C. Manfred was the
architect, and King and Armstrong the contractors. In
1915 the late F. P. and Mrs. Kelly bought the old home of
Dr. McMaster and gave it to the Roman Catholic Church for
the purposes of the hospital of St. John of God. This was


opened by Archbishop Chine of Perth, on Sunday, 2nd April,
1916, upon which day Dr. Gallagher, Bishop of Goulburn,
laid the foundation stone of a new wing. A Nursing Sister-
hood was obtained to take charge through the instrument-
ality of Archbishop Chine. In fact the hospital is actually
a branch of St. John’s Hospital in Perth. Since 1916 new
nurses’ quarters have been added and the hospital more than
doubled in size.
The Anglican Children’s Home was launched in 1929
as a parochial venture and responsibility of St. Saviour’s
Cathedral parish. The former Roman Catholic Novitiate
in Verner Street was bought, furnished and opened free of
debt at a cost of £4213. The Sisters of the Holy Cross, then
at Nyngan, were placed in charge. In 1932 they had to
relinquish the work. The Community of the Holy Name
(Melbourne), took charge in 1933. In 1935 the Cathedral
parish found the Home too big a responsibility for any
single parish and handed it over to the diocese. In 1937
the executors of the late Laura G. Bell gave the large house
and grounds, “Wandara,” in Cowper Street for the purposes
of the Home. The building was extended at a cost of £4OOO
and a larger work undertaken. H. C. Manfred was the
architect for the reconstruction. There are 17 beds in the
Home which are memorials to the late Right Reverend L. B.
Radford, fourth Bishop of Goulburn. A mural tablet
records the gift of the Home by the Bell family and another
commemorates A. Campbell Gibson’s mother in whose
memory he was a generous benefactor. The Home has
accommodation for forty children. #
Joseph Gill, shipping agent, wool-broker, and grazier
of “Winderradeen” station, Goulburn, left personal pro-
perty of £259,677. He left £SOO to the Mechanics’ Institute,
£2OOO to St. Saviour’s Cathedral, £IOOO each to the Anglican
and Methodist churches at Collector, and the balance of his
estate to the Salvation Army in Goulburn, Melbourne and
Sydney in equal shares. The Gill Memorial Home for Boys
stands on a commanding site at the extreme south
end of Auburn Street and is a striking architectural feature
of the city. It has accommodation for 80 boys. They are
educated at the South Goulburn Primary School and the
Goulburn High School.
* Hist. Dio. Gbn. p. 127.


The Goulburn branch of the Royal Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals was established in 1924. Aider-
man J. W. Middlebrook was its first president and Miss
Loreen McDougall its founder and first secretary. The
society established a dogs’ home, a lethal chamber, exhibi-
tions during “Kindness to Animals Week,” and essay
competitions at the annual Show. It has through its
honorary inspectors exercised a watchful care over stock
and has prosecuted where cruelty was evident. It has cared
for stray and unwanted animals, and found homes for many
and destroyed hundreds. It maintains an ambulance for
the use of animals. The cost of its activities is met by sub-
scriptions, proceeds of efforts and a small municipal sub-
sidy. #
Goulburn’s contributions to war funds in 1939/1941 were
considerable. It is difficult to compute them accurately in
that not all passed through the local auxiliaries. The first
war-time organisation was the Citizens’ Welfare Committee
which was formed on the 16/10/1939. It raised £291 which
was expended on comforts for the militia and the second
A.I.F. Its canteen made a profit of £3OO which was handed
to the 7th Light Horse. It also distributed £5O amongst the
first A.I.F. contingent to go overseas. This committee was
subsequently absorbed by the Lord Mayor’s Fund. (The
Goulburn Patriotic and War Fund). Contributions to this
fund lagged a little at first but soon accelerated. In the
first nine months of the war they totalled £l4OO. Then a
wonderful effort by the Goulburn auctioneers and selling
agents on the 10/7/1940 raised more than £2OOO in a single
day. In the same period the Red Cross Society raised
about £l3OO. Both organisations were responsible for
thousands of socks, shirts, pyjamas and other comforts for
the troops.
Lady Gowrie visited Goulburn on the 8/4/1941 to
launch the Red Cross Society’s “Power of the Penny” ap-
peal. By the end of the first year of the war Goulburn
had contributed in War-time charities, War Loans, Interest-
free loans and War Savings Certificates the sum of £150,000.
By the 8/5/1941 including the Patriotic, Red Cross, Spitfire,
London Victims’ and Greek Day funds, the total was
£201,692.

CHAPTER XXIII.
THE CHURCHES.
HE first Christian service in these southern districts
synchronised with the discovery of Goulburn. It was
held at Lake Bathurst on Sunday, 29th October, 1820,
by the Eev. Robert Cartwright at Governor Macquarie’s
camp. That, of course, was an isolated ministration.*
Anglican ministrations in Goulburn date from 1827, Presby-
terian from 1837, Roman Catholic from 1839, Methodist from
1846, Baptist from 1840, and Salvation Army from 1883.
There were probably isolated itinerating ministrations of all
these churches before those dates. James Backhouse, a
Quaker, described his attempt to hold a religious meeting in
the Goulburn Court House on 9/10/1836:
“The meeting in the Court House was attended by only seven-
teen persons. The population of the neighbourhood is much
scattered and many shew a much stronger inclination to resort
to a public house than to a place of worship. In the afternoon
we had a religious interview with the establishment of a young
settler, who emigrated a few years since, and has a fine property,
and a good flock of sheep; and who has read and thought more
than many, both on natural and religious subjects.”
Two days later, on the 11/10/1836, he had a more suc-
cessful service. The record states:
“We therefore returned to Goulburn, after having a meeting
with about forty persons present, in the wool room, at Rossi-
ville.”t
The first musical instrument ever used at a church ser-
vice in Goulburn was a clarinet and is still in existence. It
was brought to Australia by S. Ranger who in 1839 used it
to accompany an anthem of his own composition. After-
wards it was used in the Anglican Church at Collector and
later still in the Methodist Church. Then it was given to
the diocesan museum by A. Ranger, of Goulburn, grandson
of S. Ranger.
Dr. Lang in 1847 said:
“The Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Roman Catholics all
have places of worship of a creditable appearance for' their res-
pective communions in and around Goulburn.”!

Apparently he did not notice the Baptist chapel. He
had some caustic remarks to make about the Presbyterian
minister. In 1858 the population of the Argyle and Goul-
burn electorates was 7028, of whom 3126 belonged to the
Church of England, 2622 were Roman Catholics, 791 Pres-
byterians, 302 Wesleyans, whilst Jews numbered no less
than 92.*
The Anglican Church.f
The history of the Anglican Church in Goulburn is
usually dated from the appointment of the Rev. Thomas
Hassall to the parish of “Australia beyond Liverpool” in
1827. The earliest reference to Goulburn as part of an
ecclesiastical district is in 1827 when HassalPs charge is
described as “Cobbitty, Berrima, Bong Bong and Goul-
burn.” In the Heber Chapel registers there are recorded
13 marriages from 1827 to 1831 of residents of the Goulburn
district. There is plenty of evidence that Hassall visited
his southern-most outpost. In 1833 the Church moved
further south and the Rev. John Vincent was appointed to
Sutton Forest and Goulburn was included in his parish.
From 1833 to 1838 Vincent made regular quarterly visits to
Goulburn.
In June 1835, a subscription list was opened for the
erection of a church. The initiative was taken by Captain
F. N. Rossi in March of that year when the Governor was
staying at Rossiville. That same year the S.P.G. and the
S.P.C.K. promised £l5O for a church at Goulburn. By 1837
the amount in hand had grown to £5OO. On the 7/1/1837
Bishop Broughton paid his first visit to Goulburn and re-
ceived an address signed by 38 inhabitants beginning with
Francis Rossi the elder. On this visit the Bishop rejected
the first site chosen for a church and selected the present
Cathedral site. On the 2/12/1837 the Bishop wrote to Sir
Richard Bourke advising him of the appointment of the Rev.
W. Sowerby to Goulburn and that all conditions for a gov-
ernment stipend had been fulfilled, £3OO had been subscribed
for a church, the parsonage was ready and 200 adults were
willing to attend the church.

The Eev. William Sowerby took charge on the
16/11/1837. Bishop Broughton paid another visit in 1840.
He arrived on the 1/5/1840 and gave Confirmation on the
3/5/1840 in the “temporary place of worship,” being “the
first celebration in the district.” Sowerby’s round of duty
included Goulburn, Tirranna, the Towrang Stockade,
Lockyersleigh, Arthursleigh, Bungonia, “Bonnaby,” Rich-
lands and “Chatbury.” Old St. Saviour’s Church, a brick-
building, was built in 1839, and consecrated by Bishop
Broughton on the 7/2/1845, his third visit to Goulburn. A
fde of correspondence, 1836/1840, between Bishop Broughton
and F. N. Rossi, relating to the building of the church and
parsonage is in the diocesan museum.

The “Sydney Morning Herald” reported in 1843 the
completion of the “Church Tower” (Old St. Saviour’s)
which it said “just added, sets off the sacred building very
well.” It said that there was to be a clock for the
public benefit, “at present there is nothing by way of a
clock in town.” The clock was never erected. Some
reminiscences of Parson Sowerby, then in his 75th year,
were published in 1874. He encountered his full share of
the difficulties of Church building in the early days of the
Colony. Many a time he had to procure his own teams


and drive his own bullocks, conveying bricks, mortar and
other material for building his first church and parsonage.*
There is a portrait in oils of Dean Sowerby in the dio-
cesan museum and another in the Mechanics ’ Institute. Al-
though Dean Sowerby was appointed in 1837 the vestry
minute books are extant from 1855 only. From 1855 to
1858 the vestry was chiefly concerned with plans for the
enlargement of the old church, which plans were dropped
in 1864 when it was seen that a cathedral would be required.
In 1859 the Rev. (afterwards Canon) Richard Leigh was
appointed for the country work which embraced what is
now the Crookwell, Binda, Taralga and Lake Bathurst
parishes. In all these matters Theophilus Kirke, the school-
master took a prominent part. When first built the church
contained the old fashioned square box-pews and a three-
decker pulpit. The parish clerk announced the hymns and
led the responses; he was James Lansdowne. Later on a
harmonium and choir were introduced and housed in a
western gallery. W. Sigmont played the harmonium and
Captain F. R. L. Rossi was in the choir. Theophilus Kirke
was one of the earliest Sunday School superintendents. In
1849 there was a controversy as to whether St. Saviour’s
Church should purchase a “Seraphine or Organ” or stoves
for warming the church or both.f
In 1861 it was beginning to be realised that a Diocese
of Sydney extending to the boundaries of South Australia
and to Cape Howe was unworkable. On the 21/11/1851 a
meeting was held in Goulburn, Bishop Barker presiding, to
promote the division of the see. An appeal was launched
which was quickly successful. For the first time in the
history of the Australian Colonies “the endowment of a new
bishopric has been contributed within the Colony itself.”
The Campbell family was the largest contributor. Dr.
Mesac Thomas, secretary of the Colonial and Continental
Church Society in England, was appointed, by Letters
Patent, the last Colonial Bishop in the Empire to be so
appointed. He was consecrated in Canterbury Cathedral
on the 25/3/1863 and enthroned in the pro-Cathedral, Goul-
burn, on the 8/4/1864. The Bishop and Mrs. Thomas, ac-
companied by Bishop Barker of Sydney, arrived in Goulburn
on Friday, Bth April, 1864, in the soaking rain. At 10 a.m.

a great number of persons went to the top of “the Big Hill.”
A procession was formed which accompanied the Bishops
to Mandelson’s Hotel. The procession from the hotel to
the Mechanics’ Institute had to be abandoned because of the
state of the streets. The installation in the pro-Cathedral
began at noon. The Eev. Wm. Sowerby installed the Bishop.
A reception and recognition took place in the Mechanics’
Institute immediately afterwards. Separate addresses from
the clergy and laity to both bishops were presented. That
of the laity to Bishop Thomas was signed by 1500 people.
A lunch was held at Mandelson’s Hotel at which 60 people
were present.
It was not until 1874 that Bishop Thomas began in
earnest to build St. Saviour’s Cathedral. He personally
collected £18,500. The Cathedral was dedicated and licensed
on the 29/4/1884, nine bishops being present. Out of debt
in 1916, it was consecrated by Bishop Eadford on the
24/9/1916. The present cathedral was built round the old
church, which was then demolished. For a few years the
present church hall, built in 1874, served as the pro-cathedral.
Theophilus Kirke served on the Cathedral Building Commit-
tee from 1871 to 1876 and was partly responsible for the
selection of Blacket as architect.
When St. Saviour’s Hall was opened in 1875 as the
temporary pro-cathedral the organ from St. Phillip’s Church,
Sydney, was then purchased and installed. The “Penny
Post” reported:
“The instrument... .is said to be a very powerful one; and the
music which will issue therefrom will consequently be something
new for our citizens to listen to, as nothing of the kind has
previously been here.”
After the cathedral was opened the church hall or the
pro-cathedral continued to be used from 1884 to 1891 by a
section of the congregation as the parish church during the
Eossi dispute.
The present rectory was built in 1916 from the glebe
compensation moneys. The following have been the incum-
bents of the Cathedral parish:
Wm. Sowerby, 1838/1875; A. T. Puddicombe, 1876/1896; W.
C. Pritchard, 1896/1901; Wm. Martin, 1901/1903; A. R.
Bartlett, 1903/1913; G. A. Carver, 1914/1921; J. W. Ward,
1921/1927; A. P. Wales, 1927/1931; G. H. Hirst, 1932/1937;
K. L. McKeown, 1937/1941; A. C. King 1941/,


There have been two deans only, Wm. Sowerby, 1869/
1875; W. H. Pownall, 1892/1903. There have been five
bishops:
Mesac Thomas, 1863/1891; Wm. Chalmers, 1892/1902; Chris-
topher George Barlow, 1902/1914; Lewis Bostock Radford,
1915/1933; Ernest Henry Burgmann, 1934/.
Of these only Canon Chalmers was consecrated in St.
Saviour’s Cathedral. This was on the 1/11/1892 as second
bishop of Goulburn. The "Penny Post” improved the
occasion:
“The day is o’er, the deed is done,
To canticles of Harmer’s*
A canon’s lost, but still a gun
Is left in Bishop Chalmers.”
Organists of old St. Saviour’s Church included Mrs.
Rossi 1860, W. Sigmont 1860/4, Mrs. Welby, E. S. Deane,
J. A. Winney, and G. F. Mitchell. F. W. Harmer was ap-
pointed to the pro-cathedral in 1882, and continued as
organist of the cathedral until 1894. T. H. Massey was
here 1895/7, P. M. Ibbs 1897/1900. At this time the choir
itself had to raise funds for the remuneration of the boys
and Ibbs’ term of office saw a long series of concerts for this
purpose. T. C. Webb followed from 1900/2, R. G-. Burnside
for a few months only of 1902. E. J. Robinson was here
from 1903/9. Leicester (afterwards the Rev.) Johnson was
organist and choirmaster from 1909 to 1917, Dr. Jarman in
1917/8. In 1918 F. Howard Ussher was appointed. In
1934 Dr. S. H. Nicholson visited the diocese and the Cathe-
dral choir was affiliated with the School of English Church
Music.
The first server in the Cathedral provided an instance
of Australian democracy which must be almost unique in
Anglican history. The service which he rendered so faith-
fully and well upon a Sunday in the Cathedral was made
possible by an equally faithful service to the community
upon a week-day. His name was Wharton. He was the
municipal night-soil contractor.
Attached to the Cathedral are four daughter churches:
All Saints’, Eastgrove; the Good Shepherd, South Goulburn;
St. Barnabas’, Rosemonte and St. Andrew’s, Tirranna, the
last named dating from 1859. There are two other Angli-
can parishes in Goulburn, those of North Goulburn and West
* F. W, Harmer, organist and choirmaster.


Goulburn, the latter now attached for working purposes to
the Cathedral parish.
Anglican services in the Old Township began at a very
early date, probably in 1833, and probably also in the Court
House. Later the “Old Township’’ was part of the “Aber-
crombie District.” The Rev. Richard (afterwards Canon)
Leigh began regular ministrations in 1858 in a rented build-
ing. He built the first church in 1860/1. The present
church of St. Nicholas, North Goulburn, designed by E. T.
Blacket, and unfinished, was built in 1879/80. There are
daughter churches at Kenmore (St. John), The Forest (St.
Columba), and Towrang (St. John). The Sunday School,
the second, was built in 1898 and extended in 1940. The
rectory, also the second, was built in 1914. There have been
twelve rectors of whom the most outstanding were Canon
D’Arcy Irvine (1880/1894), and Canon Kingsmill (1898/
1908).
Christ Church, West Goulburn, for part of its time has
been a separate cure and for the rest attached to the Cathe-
dral parish. The church, designed by Canon Soares, was
built in 1884 and extended in 1912. There are daughter
churches at Kippilaw (St. James), Kirkdale (St. Michael),
and Yarra (St. Mary). The rectory, the second, is in
Coromandel Street. Canon A. D. Soares was rector from
1877 to 1897.
For many years the Diocesan Registry was in the
Mechanics’ Institute building. Later the Church Society
had rooms in Montague Street and the diocesan business was
transacted there. In 1893 Bishop Chalmers took over from
the Cathedral parish the old denominational school building
in Church Street and restored it as the Diocesan Registry.
It was restored again for that purpose in 1905, when Bishop
Barlow moved the greater part of the Diocesan Library
there. In 1923 a new Church House was built at the S.W.
corner of the Cathedral grounds, at a cost of £3OOO, from
designs by Burcham Clamp and MaeKellar. E. Gould
was the contractor.
The Registrars of the diocese have been: H. Kerrison James,
1863/1865; Francis R. L. Rossi, 1866/1884; Canon Alberto
Diaz Soares, 1884/1893; Dean Pownall, 1893/1895; S. W.
Alexander, 1895/1899; E. Dyson Austen, 1900; W. E. Har-
per, 1901; W. E. Newmarch, 1901/1902; Archdeacon George
Spencer, 1903/1908; Rev. J. W. Ward, 1908/l913; Rev. C.
E. Burgess, 1913/1914; Ransome T. Wyatt, 1914/.


In 1920 the first Australian Anglican religious order for
men, the Community of the Ascension, was founded. The
brethren are occupied in the maintenance of a religious house
where priests and laymen can find rest and refreshment,
where the testing of vocations to the priesthood and the
mission field can be undertaken. The brethren are also
occupied in the holding of missions and retreats. The Com-
munity was established by a group of returned padres in
1920 in the burnt-out ruins of Old Bishopthorpe. At first
the premises were leased. Later they were purchased,
together with acres of land. In 1922 eight rooms of the
old house were rebuilt. Later the stables were converted
into a beautiful chapel, then bit by bit as funds came in,
more and more of the old house was rebuilt for its new pur-
pose until the whole was complete. Louis R. Williams,
A.R.I.A.A. (Melb.), was the architect for the restoration.
Roman Catholic Church."
Roman Catholic ministrations began at a very early
date, possibly before 1827. Fr. Therry the pioneer Roman
Catholic priest in Australia visited Goulburn on the 2/8/1833,
stayed at Matt Healy’s inn, celebrated Mass there on the
3/8/1833 and baptised three children on the 4/8/1833. He
was back on the 10/8/1833 and the 11/8/1833 and celebrated
Mass again.
That Fr. Therry was known in Goulburn before 1833
is shewn by the fact that when in 1826 he was suspended
from his Government chaplaincy and superseded by Fr.
Power the Roman Catholics in Goulburn continued to sup-
port Fr. Therry.
“The opposition to Fr. Power was sometimes very marked.
He had told the people of Goulburn that the Christmas dues
were to be paid to him, as the recognised chaplain; they for-
warded the dues to Fr. Therry, asking him to do as he liked
with them.”
During the remodelling of the “Evening Post” building
in 1935 a letter was found in the strong room from Fr.
Therry to the Governor, dated 25/10/1830, with reference
to ministrations to the “infatuated insurgents” to be tried
“by special commissioner this week at Bathurst.”
* Fr. O’Brien’s “Therry;” Dom Birt’s “Benedictine Pioneers;”
Cardinal Moran’s “Hist, of Cath. Church;” Burton’s “Eel.
and Educ. in N.S.W.”


The ‘‘insurrection” by bushrangers and sympathisers
is described in a despatch of Governor Darling’s of the
5/10/1830. Six men were tried for murder, condemned and
executed. The Colonial Secretary advised Fr. Therry on
the 30/10/1830 that a Government horse would be supplied.
How Fr. Therry’s letter came to be preserved in Goulburn
is not clear.* Further evidence of Fr. Therry’s ministra-
tion in this district is furnished by the baptismal records of
the Ryan family of “Ryansvale,” entered in a book of
devotions preserved there. James Ryan was baptised at
“Ryansvale” by Fr. Therry on the 1/10/1835.
There were 783 Roman Catholics in the County of Ar-
gyle according to the census of 1836. Fr. Therry wrote to
John O’Sullivan, manager of the Commercial Bank, Goul-
burn, on the 10/5/1837, advising that he would be in
Goulburn the following week. On this trip he baptised
John Joseph Ryan at Ryansvale on the 26/5/1837. Goul-
burn was then being worked from Yass. The priest lived
at Yass in 1839, visiting Goulburn at intervals. His visits
included the hospital and the Towrang Stockade. That
priest, Fr. Michael Brennan, is shewn as receiving a Govern-
ment stipend of £l5O. His receipts for 1838, a broken
period, totalled £2lB/19/-, of which £l5O was for passage
and outfit.
Fr. Brennan’s name also appears in the Ryan family’s
baptismal record. He was at Ryansvale to baptise Michael
Thomas Ryan on the 10/1/1839. Dean Lovat was a mem-
ber of the Benedictine Order who came out to Australia in
1837. He was in charge of the Yass-Goulburn Mission in
1839. That year he was stuck up by bushrangers at Geary’s
Gap but was allowed to proceed. He went from Goulburn
or Yass to Sydney to preach the occasional sermon at the
dedication of the first St. Mary’s, Sydney.
Traditionally the first Mass in Goulburn was celebrated
in Matt Healy’s stables, “Riversdale,” but whether this was
before Fr. Therry’s visit of the 3/8/1833 cannot now be
ascertained. There is much confusion over the laying of
the foundation stone of the first church in Goulburn by
Bishop Bolding caused by Dorn Birt having misread the
Bishop’s letter “circa 1838.” Cardinal Moran is at fault
* “E.P.P.,” 20/9/1935.


too. The Church of St. Augustine referred to in the cor-
respondence was at Yass not Goulburn. Bishop Folding
wrote to Fr. Therry on the 6/12/1839 that the church at
Goulburn would be begun forthwith.
Fr. Therry visited Goulburn again in 1839. # From 1837
to 1867 John O’Sullivan, manager of the Commercial Bank
and personal friend, champion and later executor of Fr.
Therry, was a leading layman of the Goulburn congregation.
Bishop Folding wrote to O’Sullivan on the 16/10/1839:
“The destitute state of the Hospitals at Goulburn and Bathurst
are to me a cause of unceasing anxiety. This is not diminished
by the difficulty experienced in procuring exemplary priests to
join us in this distant and arduous Mission.”
A correspondent, calling himself “A Practical Obser-
ver,” wrote of Bishop Folding’s visit to Goulburn as follows:
“On Monday the 10th his Lordship passed into Goulburn,
visiting in his way the unhappy persons sentenced to work in
irons at the Stockade near Goulburn, with whom he remained
for upwards of an hour. Having marked out the exact site
for a church in the rapidly increasing town of Goulburn, the
Bishop proceeded on Wednesday to Bungonia, being accompanied
by the Rev. Mr. M’Grath. ... The Bishop returned to Goulburn,
where he remained on Friday and Saturday. His Lordship
did not forget to visit the prisoners in the lockup, nor the sick
in the hospital, to all of whom he spoke words of advice and
of hope. On Sunday, the 16th, he celebrated first Mass in
Goulburn, and after second Mass he delivered an impressive
and most instructive sermon, at which were observed most
respectable individuals of other persuasions. As in coming
up he did not forget the poor souls in irons at the Stockade,
Towrang, so in returning he did not forget to call on them;
he read the litanies and other pious prayers for them, after
which he exhorted them to bear their crosses with patience and
resignation, to refrain from cursing, fighting, and sinful associa-
tion. Here was to be seen the successor of the Augustines, and
the Dunstans, and the Wyckhams, with his head bare, in a
miserable shed open at the sides and ends, and exposed to a
cold high wind, giving religious consolation and instruction to
some of his fellow creatures who have few hopes at this side
of the grave. Here, too, was evidence to the contrary of that
stated by that Judge with the bad face and, I believe, much
worse heart, in his recent work on the land we live in”t
Another account of this Goulburn visit states that
Bishop Folding said Mass and administered the Sacrament
of Confirmation in a slab hut. Other accounts state that
this slab hut whs on the site of the present Cathedral. The
site of the Cathedral was bought from C. O’Brien, that of
Our Lady of Mercy’s convent and school is a former Police
paddock.

Bishop Folding related that a Protestant lad climbing
on the roof and seeing the Bishop in his mitre, cried out at
the top of his voice to his companion: “Come here! come
here! a cove here has the most comical hat yon ever saw.
Fr. Fitzpatrick, later Vicar-General of the Archdiocese
of Melbourne, and Fr. Brennan were the first resident
priests in Goulburn.
“and their charge embraced the whole of the surrounding ter-
ritory extending to the coast and the Murray River.”
In 1840 Fr. McGrath was appointed to the
“pastoral care of Goulburn, Bungonia, Braidwood and Broulee.”
The Presbytery in 1840/1 stood in Auburn Street and
here it was that Fr. McGrath lived. Mass was said here
until a small bark church was erected upon another site.
Dom Birt in his “Benedictine Pioneers of Australia”
tells how in 1839 Dean Lovat and Fr. McGrath were in
charge of the Yass-Goulburn parish which extended over
10,000 square miles. Visits to Goulburn were frequent, e.g.,
Dean Lovat was here on the 7/11/1839, from the 18/11/1839
to the 23/11/1839, on the 11/12/1839 and the 16/12/1839.
Sometimes Dean Lovat was at Yass and Fr. McGrath at
Goulburn and vice-versa. The same was true of Fr. Bren-
nan and Fr. Fitzpatrick in 1840.
Of Fr. Brennan’s and Fr. Fitzpatrick’s ministry the
“Catholic Magazine” for July 1840, said:
“Dr. Folding has appointed the Rev. Messrs. Brennan and
Fitzpatrick to the Yass country, the most remote part of the
Colony, on the Port Phillip side. They have a very large
district under their spiritual care. Mr. Brennan was led
along by the good dispositions of the people to a great distance,
between two and three hundred miles, baptising children, re-
ceiving persons into the Church and rectifying marriages. He
is an excellent bushman, and finds his way across the wilds
admirably. His companion, Mr. Fitzpatrick, is not so for-
tunate in this respect, having been lost many times, and obliged
to pass the night in the bush, without fire or blanket. He
is, however, doing wonderful good; and both he and Mr. Brennan
are much respected.”
A Goulburn correspondent described Fr. Therry’s visit
of 1841 as follows:
“An account of the ceremony of laying the first stone of our
Church here would have reached you earlier were it not that
there are some doubts as to whether the spot marked out at
present, and in which the stone is laid, will ultimately be the
site of the church. As a site for the Catholic Church, owing to
some cause, the situation of these two acres is so inconvenient,
and so objectionable altogether that two other acres have been


purchased from Mr. C. O’Brien, J.P., of Yass. These are
certainly in a more convenient situation than the government
allotments. The Very Reverend the Vicar-General of Van Die-
men’s Land assisted by the Rev. Mr. Goold of the Campbell
district, and the Rev. Mr. M’Grath, the clergyman of this
district, laid the stone on Wednesday, the 21st ultimo. The
intended church is dedicated to Almighty God, under the pat-
ronage of St. Vincent de Paul, the illustrious founder of the
order of the Sisters of Charity. Although the day was cold,
and the situation greatly exposed, a considerable number of
persons assembled to witness the interesting ceremony, the first
of the kind seen in this extensive district.”*
This work did not proceed, at first because of some
defect in the title to the site and then because the con-
gregation was still dissatisfied with the site. The stone
which Fr. Therry laid is said to have been “on Church Hill”
at the corner of Verner and Cowper Streets.
The report of the Rev. Dr. Murphy, Vicar-General of
New Holland and Van Diemen’s Land, in 1841, says that
Fr. Michael Magrath was stationed at Goulburn, and Dean
Lovat at Yass. The report on the Australian Church pre-
sented by the Most Reverend Dr. Folding to the Sacred
Congregation of Propaganda was written in Italian and
dated from the Monastery of San Callisto in Rome the
12/3/1842. He gives the same particulars. Preparations
were in hand at Goulburn, Bungonia and Yass for the build-
ing of churches.
A devout layman of those early days was Columbus
Fitzpatrick who is said to have arrived in Australia with his
mother in 1811. His mother and a man named McGuire
are said to have taught the faith to Roman Catholic children
in Sydney before the arrival of Fr. Therry. He is said to
have published some recollections of Frs. Therry and
O’Flynn. These have not been traced. One of the earliest
subscriptions to Fr. Therry for the building of a church in
Goulburn came from Jack Cole, inn-keeper and an Anglican.
Advantage of Governor Gipps’ visit in 1842 was taken by
the Roman Catholic congregation to obtain a better site.
The Governor inspected several, f
Tenders were invited in 1843 for the “erection of a
Roman Catholic chapel in Goulburn, ’ ’ which however was not
to be built upon the site originally granted by the Govern-
ment. A small brick church dedicated to SS. Peter and
Paul was built.j: From time to time in later years this

building was enlarged until it eventually gave place to the
present cathedral. In some reminiscences Bishop Gallagher
said that the Presbytery was begun in 1841 by Dean Walsh,
added to in 1861 by Dr. McAlroy and completed by Bishop
Gallagher in 1909. There is some confusion here because
at the consecration of SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral and
the golden jubilee of Bishop Lanigan, Cardinal Moran re-
called that a weatherboard presbytery of four rooms became
in 1859 the home of the first Sisters of Mercy and their
boarders.

Illustration from a map of Goulburn of the fifties.
C. Meehan wrote that all about 1860 the old premises
of the Commercial Bank, formerly the residence of John
O’Sullivan, became the temporary Roman Catholic "Dean-
ery.” This is possible because O’Sullivan vacated his own
house in 1859 when the Commercial Bank in Auburn Street,
with a manager’s residence was built. In the early part
of 1855 Fr. Therry visited Goulburn and Queanbeyan and
gave a bell to the Goulburn church. Dean Walsh, parish
priest of Goulburn, had as his assistant from 1859 to 1861,
Fr. William Lanigan, who returned in 1867 as second Bishop
of Goulburn. Dean Walsh was succeeded by the Very Rev.
Dr. Michael McAlroy. As Administrator of the Goulburn
diocese he built 11 churches, a convent costing £9OOO, and
raised £5OOO for the endowment of the See. He died in
1880.


When the question of erecting additional sees in N.S.W.
arose the Archbishop of Sydney suggested Yass in prefer-
ence to Gonlbnrn. The Holy See, however, selected Goul-
bnrn and translated the Most Rev. Dr. Geoghegan, Bishop
of Adelaide, as the first Bishop. The Rev. Dean Hanly is
said to have declined the appointment.*' Bishop Geoghegan
died in Ireland on the 9/5/1864 without taking possession
of the See of Gonlbnrn. The see was vacant until the
appointment of Bishop Lanigan. The Brief of his appoint-
ment is dated 10/12/1866. He arrived in Gonlbnrn on the
4/5/1867. All Gonlbnrn turned out and met him 2 miles
from town. The consecration of Dr. Lanigan took place
on the 2/6/1867, the first occasion upon which an Aus-
tralian Bishop had been consecrated in his own Cathedral
city. This was in the little brick church which did duty
as the pro-cathedral.
On the 12/2/1871 the foundation stone of the present
Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul was blessed by the Bishop.
This was a portion of the nave connecting with the old
church. It was completed rapidly and blessed by Arch-
bishop Polding. Considerable additions were made at this
time to the episcopal residence, and St. Patrick’s College,
was begun. The foundation stone of the transepts, sanc-
tuary, chapel, sacristy and tower was laid by Cardinal
Moran on the 15/5/1887. The Cathedral was opened and
blessed by the Cardinal on the 29/6/1890. Four years’
subscription lists were then published shewing receipts as
£10,086/19/1, payments £13,575/19/9. The deficit was then
£3189/0/8. f
The organ in SS. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral was opened
with a recital by W. T. Best on the 23/9/1890. Out of
debt in 1898, the Cathedral was consecrated on the
24/4/1898 by Dr. Dwyer, coadjutor bishop of Maitland. The
occasion was Bishop Lanigan’s Golden Jubilee. The sermon
was preached by Cardinal Moran. Chas. Spadacini was the
architect and C. J. O’Brien and Wilkie Bros, the contractors
for the Convent of Our Lady of Mercy, and St. Michael’s
Chapel described as “lately completed or in course of erec-
tion” in 1891. The Chapel was dedicated on the 27/9/1891
by the Administrator, the Very Rev. J. Gallagher, after-
wards Bishop of the diocese.

Chas. Spadacini is said to have been the architect for
the completed cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul. According
to another account, however, Andrea Stombuco was the
architect of SS. Peter and PauPs Cathedral. A native of
Florence, born 1820, he arrived in Victoria in 1861, and was
appointed diocesan architect by Bishop Lanigan in 1869.
He died in Perth, Western Australia, on the 6/2/1907.*
All this time Bishop Lanigan had continued building
and extending throughout the city and diocese. In 1867
when he arrived there were 16,000 Roman Catholics and five
priests. In 1880 he reported to the Holy See that there
were 24,000 Roman Catholics with twenty-five priests and
the professed sisters had grown from one convent with
twelve sisters to four with forty-six. Dr. Lanigan founded
the orphanage.
Bishop Lanigan made three visits to the Holy See and
on his return from the third celebrated the Silver Jubilee of
his Consecration. This was on the 9/6/1892. He was
given an address and a gold chalice. He died on the
13/5/1900. He was succeeded by Dr. Gallagher who had
been consecrated coadjutor bishop on the 7/7/1895. He
left his mark upon the diocese and city more especially in
its educational and charitable institutions. He died on the
26/11/1923. The Bishop’s House was blessed and opened
by Cardinal Moran on the 21/2/1909. E. C. Manfred was
the architect, John Cody the contractor, and the cost was
£3500.
Dr. Barry, previously Administrator of St. Patrick’s
Cathedral, Melbourne, succeeded Bishop Gallagher. Again
his work is manifest in the institutions he left behind, hospi-
tal, technical school, library, novitiates and schools. Dr. Barry
died in 1938 and was followed by Dr. McGuire, translated
from the Bishopric of North Queensland. The old church
of SS. Peter and Paul saw in 1860 the reception, and in 1862
the profession of the first Sister of Mercy ever professed
in Australia and the first Australian born to enter the order.
This was Miss Catherine Mary Ann Donovan, sister of Dr.
Donovan. She laboured in the Goulburn diocese for 53
years, f

A limited company was formed in 1883 to build a Roman
Catholic Hall in Montague Street. The capital was to have
been £7OOO. McNamara was secretary and C. Gillespie
treasurer. Shares totalling £320 were taken up at the
initial meeting. Another company was formed to erect a
“St. Patrick’s Hall’ in Auburn Street. This had a nominal
capital of £2OOO. Later it was decided to amalgamate the
two. The Hall was not built. # In 1904 the property now
known as 70 Verner Street was bought for a novitiate. This
was sold in 1929. The St. Joseph’s Novitiate moved out
to "Pineleigh” West Goulburn.
The Papal Delegate (Cardinal Cerretti) visited Goul-
burn on the 14/8/1915 and was given a civic welcome. He
blessed the Christian Brothers’ School. Archbishop Catta-
ueo, the Papal Delegate, visited Goulburn for the Golden
Jubilee of Bishop Gallagher on Sunday, 16th November,
1919. He blessed St. Brigid’s Primary School in Bourke
Street, and additions to the Boys’ Orphanage at South Goul-
burn. Archbishop Panico, the Papal Delegate, was here for
the enthronement of Bishop McGuire.
The "South Hill’ property was bought from Joseph
Collett in 1926. This was the second time it had been
purchased for Roman Catholic purposes. The first time was
in 1866 when Dr. McAlroy bought it for a college. On St.
Patrick’s College deciding upon the West Goulburn site,
South Hill was sold. In common with the rest of New
South Wales, Goulburn took considerable interest in the
"Sister Ligouri” case. Much sectarian capital was made
out of this by controversialists. Roman Catholics in Goul-
burn gave £llsO to Bishop Dwyer as a mark of their sym-
pathy.!
The foundation stone of the Sacred Heart Church and
School, North Goulburn was laid on the 14/8/1881. W.
Duncan was the contractor.. The cost was £6OO. The
church was blessed by Dr. Lanigan on the 22/2/1882. The
foundation stone of the Convent of the Sisters of St. Joseph
at North Goulburn was laid by Bishop Lanigan on the
3/9/1882. St. Joseph’s Church, North Goulburn, caught
fire on the 8/5/1922. The roof which then was of shingles,
was completely destroyed. Much other damage was done.

A new Convent Chapel and other extensions costing £12,000
in all were undertaken in 1941, as a memorial to Fr. Julian
Tenison Woods, one of the co-founders of the Order of St.
Joseph.*
The Passionist Order in 1890 purchased, through A. G.
Finlay and Coy., “Ravenswood” house and grounds and
renamed it “Mary’s Mount.” It was blessed by Cardinal
Moran on the 29/6/1890. Completed, it was blessed by
Bishop Lanigan on the 3/5/1892. E. C. Manfred was the
architect for the building and J. C. O’Brien the contractor.
The Goulburn branch of the Australian Holy Catholic
Guild was founded in December 1871. The Holy Name
Society was founded in 1928. The old chapel of St. Michael
at Ryansvale, was built by Michael Ryan in 1848.
Presbyterian Church.f
David Waugh writing to his sister Eliza on the
25/9/1837 mentions the-desire of Dr. John Dunmore Lang
to place a Presbyterian minister in Goulburn. There had
undoubtedly been itinerating ministrations before then but
these are now difficult to trace. Seventeen years after the
discovery of Goulburn the mail coach left Sydney on the
11/10/1837 carrying as a passenger a young Presbyterian
minister named William Hamilton. He reached Goulburn
on the 14/10/1837 and held his first service in the Court
House on the 15/10/1837. He settled down in residence in
November. His parish included the Abercrombie, Braid-
wood, Yass, Berrima, Limestone Plains, the South Coast and
the Monaro. On the 19/11/1837 he recorded in his diary
his initial disappointment:
“The utter indifference to religious ordinances. Thirty in the
afternoon, 4 women and 4 children in evening. On the two
previous Sabbaths a greater number attended under the
impulse of civility or novelty.”
On the 8/2/1838 he forwarded to the presbytery in
Sydney
A promise signed by 102 free adults to attend public worship
at the Presbyterian Church at Goulburn;
A declaration by 86 free adults that it was their desire that the
Minister of the Presbyterian Church should administer relig-
ious ordinance to them;

A list of 43 convict servants residing in Goulburn who were
Presbyterians;
A subscription list for a Presbyterian Church totalling £320.
A meeting was held of subscribers in the Court House
on the 9/3/1838 which proceeded to the appointment of
trustees, viz., Alex Kinghorne, James Chisholm, Dr. Richard-
son, James McFarlane, John Templeton, David Paton, David
Waugh, James Miles, Andrew Garret and John McGeorge.
On the 14/6/1838 the trustees adopted a plan for a church
building prepared by Hume of Sydney. On the 17th June,
the first Kirk Session was constituted. The Elders ordained
were Andrew Turnbull of Goulburn and David Waugh of
Gatton Park. On the 1/12/1838 two acres were granted
for church, school and minister's dwelling. This site is now
occupied by Conolly’s flour mill. On the 4/12/1838 a
tender for the erection of the church was accepted, £685.
The contractors failed to complete their engagement and in
1839 Thomas Brodie was entrusted with the work. At this
time Andrew and Mrs. Turnbull conducted a Sabbath even-
ing class for young people at the minister's residence. A
paragraph difficult to reconcile with the foregoing appeared
in the “Sydney Morning Herald," which stated in 1843 that
ground had been secured for a Scots' Church “near Mr.
Bull's new building" and that work would start immed-
iately. # The Rev. Wm. Hamilton’s difficulty in the matter
of the restriction of his Government stipend to £lOO per
annum is referred to in despatch No. 19, Lord John Russell
to Sir George Gipps of the 17/2/1840, and the letter en-
closed therein from the Rev. Dr. Macfarlan to the Rt. Hon.
H. Labouchere of the 29/8/1839. His troubles over Pres-
byterian Union are mentioned in a despatch of the Rev.
John Dunmore Lang's to the Marquess of Normanby of the
14/6/1839. f That year Judge Burton recorded that there
was no Presbyterian place of worship in Goulburn but one
was about to be built. He said:
the Reverend Mr. Hamilton, Presbyterian Minister, resides in
Goulburn, and is the only Minister besides Mr. Sowerby, within
a distance of forty-five miles.”
Judge Burton described Hamilton's responsibilities as
including:
‘‘Goulburn, Braidwood and other places in the district, and
occasionally at the Hospital and ironed gang....”!

Dr. John Dimmore Lang visited Goulburn in 1843, 1845
and 1846. He had nothing good to say about the first
Presbyterian minister in Goulbnrn, but his objections and
criticisms were inspired by the domestic politics of the Pres-
byterian Church. He said:
“The Presbyterian minister of the district, the Rev. W. Hamil-
ton, has lately acquired some notoriety among the members of
his own communion in the colony for having discovered that
the ‘well-watered plain’ of Goulburn, which is ‘even as the
garden of the Lord—like the land of Egypt, as thou comest
unto Zoar’—is exactly half-way between the Free and the Estab-
lished Churches of Scotland.”
It appears that Hamilton steered clear of the schism.
“For when it became necessary to make some declaration as
to which of these Ecclesiastical bodies he and his brethren in
the colony belonged to, this clerical middleman, submitted to
his brethren, in the year 1844, a series of Resolutions which
* Pages 233/4 and App. XII.


were adopted with approbation by a large majority, and sub-
sequently ratified and confirmed in the year 1845, offering the
right hand of fellowship to the State Church, and the left to
the Free.”!
Dr. Lang pours vitriolic scorn for another page on this
proposal. All of which, though understandable, was unfair
for Hamilton was a martyr for conscience’ sake. On the
30/5/1841 the old church was opened for service and on the
25/12/1841 the first manse was finished. When the railway
came through, this first manse and the street between it and
the church were resumed. When the disruption of the
Scottish Church occurred in 1843 the Sydney Presbytery
decided to adhere to the Established Church of Scotland.
In 1846 Hamilton resigned and at a tremendous sacrifice
and with incredible hardships transported his wife and four
small children and all their belongings by bullock dray to
Melbourne. The diary of the journey is extant and in
possession of the family. It has been reproduced in Anne
Hamilton’s memoir of James Clow.
The next minister was the Rev. Wm. Ross, M.A., who
took charge in 1847, and remained until his death in 1869.
He was a prominent Mason and a good citizen, taking a
great interest in the District Hospital and the Mechanics’
Institute. He was associated with Caroline Chisholm in her
work for girl migrants. The parish in his day still included
Braidwood, Queanbeyan, part of the Cooma district and
Yass. On his death the Masonic body erected a memorial
to him in the grounds of old St. Andrew’s where it stood
until 1923 when it was removed to the present church. On
the 29/11/1870 the mayor and aldermen accepted the in-
vitation of “the Masonic body” to the unveiling of the
monument to the Rev. Wm. Ross on the 6/12/1870. How-
ever, the Council did not attend because “the Masonic
body” did not have “the common courtesy” to submit a
programme “shewing the exact position the Council would
take in the public ceremony.”* The Civic Fathers stood
on their dignity seventy years ago. The introduction of
an organ in old St. Andrew’s was not accomplished without
some remonstrance on the part of the older members of the
congregation. Alexander Silver, who died in 1893, after
worshipping for 40 years is credited with having enquired
t Pages 242/3.

ery.”f
The Rev. S. F. MacKenzie, 8.A., was the minister from
1869 to 1875. He was followed by the Rev. A. M. Tait
who was here for 19 years. In 1885 a petition was pre-
sented to form a second charge in Goulbnrn. The petitioners
were allotted all the city to the south of Verner Street and
worshipped for a while in the Mechanics’ Institute. In
1887 a church was built in Bourke Street, the building which
is now the Baptist Church. The Governor, Lord Carring-
ton, laid the foundation stone on the 25/3/1887, and the
church was named “Trinity Church.” The Rev. David
Allan was in charge of this congregation from the
29/9/1886 to the 5/6/1889. He was followed by the Rev. Fran-
cis Slade, who resigned when the congregation got into
difficulties with its mortgage. The Rev. J. B. Fulton was
minister of Trinity Church from 1892 to 1896. In 1898
a Commission of Assembly closed Trinity and most of the
congregation returned to St. Andrew’s The Rev. A. M.
Tait resigned the charge of St. Andrew’s on the 10/5/1899.
The Rev. J. D. Buchanan, 8.A., followed from 1899 to 1900.
During his time the Sunday School which had been con-
tinued at Trinity was amalgamated with St. Andrew’s. The
Rev. A. M. Gauld (1901/1909), the Rev. A. H. Tolhurst
(1909/1911), and the Rev. W. A. Williams (1911/1916) were
the next ministers. The Rev. George Tulloch (1916/1923)
was instrumental in buying a new church site (although
that particular site was afterwards sold) and in raising
some funds for a new church.
In 1920 the church lands and buildings in Sloane Street
were sold for £3OOO. In 1922 the present church site was
bought. The Rev. J. Keith Miller was minister from 1923/
1926. On the 3/6/1924 the State Governor laid the founda-
tion stone of the present St. Andrew’s. The last service
in the old St. Andrew’s was held on the 3/5/1925 and on
the 6/5/1925 the new church was dedicated. The Rev.
Keith Miller was succeeded by the Rev. A. Crowther Smith
(1927/1933). In his time the new St. Andrew’s Hall was
built and opened free of debt on the 17/11/1929. In July
1933, he received a call to Haberfield, but died in Goulburn
on the 26/7/1933. The congregation placed a memorial

over his grave. The Rev. C. H. Douglas, 8.A., was here
from 1933/1937 and on the 18/8/1937 the Rev. Russell Scott,
M.A., was appointed. The present manse in Clifford Street
was bought in 1937 and occupied on the 11/10/1937.
The site of old St. Andrew’s is now the continuation
of Craig Street into Sloane Street. The first manse is now
on the eastern side of the railway and is occupied as a resi-
dence by the Gas Company. The second manse still stands
at the corner of Craig and Sloane Streets and is part of
Conolly’s flour mill property. The old church was a Gothic
structure with porch, vestry and spire. The first bell
cracked and Robert Fenwick gave another in 1868 which
bell is now at the new church. The pews in the old church
were of cedar, of the old box type with doors. The choir
was in a gallery. The first pulpit stood at the rear of the
church. The church was enlarged in the seventies by the
addition of a cross section and a vestry and in 1882 a pipe
organ was installed. The old school hall still stands. It
was built in 1901. The Presbyterians invited “Hop” (Liv-
ingstone Hopkins') of the “Bulletin” to give two lectures
for Church Funds in 1900. He told one good story:
“A Sectarian journal spoke of me as a tall, melancholy looking
man, who might well be mistaken for a Presbyterian Clergyman.
I demanded an apology and the editor apologised—to the whole
Presbyterian body.”*
Methodist Church.f
The first mention of Goulburn as a field for Methodist
activity is in the Sydney District Minutes of 1842 where it
figures as one of the “New Stations” recommended to the
attention of the Committee:
“Several gentlemen of property in the neighbourhood of Goul-
burn and Yass have expressed their desire to have the advantage
of a Wesleyan Missionary amongst them.... the sum of £IOO
per annum is guaranteed by those residing in Goulburn.”
Chief amongst these was Matthew Trenery, and assoc-
iated with him were John Wheatley and John Simpson who
both preached to Methodist congregations in “Mr. Bulmor’s
house.” John Wheatley frequently walked the 22 miles
from Collector to take these Matthew Trenery

gave a slab building in Clifford Street, which was repaired
and fitted up as a place of worship. The occasional sermon
at the opening was preached by the Rev. Wm. Hamilton, the
Presbyterian minister.* The little group of Methodists grew
steadily until 1846 when the Rev. S. J. Draper visited Goul-
burn with the object of selecting a site for a more suitable
building.
On this visit the Rev. S. J. Draper is said to have given
“tickets of membership to six persons and notes on trial to
fourteen,”
and to have selected a site for
“Mission premises.”!
Whether this visit was before or after that of the Rev.
W. B. Boyce is not clear, but it was probably before. The
Rev. W. B. Boyce, general superintendent of the Wesleyan
Church, visited Goulburn in 1846. He found two young
local preachers, H. Saxby and R. H. Blatchford, at work and
a congregation meeting at the temporary place of worship
in Clifford Street. Another account gives the two local
preachers as R. H. Blatchford and Henry Goldsmith, with
John Lansdowne as class leader. The Rev. W. B. Boyce
appointed the Rev. Wm. Lightbody as the first minister of
the Goulburn circuit. Lightbody began work in 1847. The
charge extended to Braidwood and Araluen. Wm. Light-
body appears in the “Minutes of the twenty-eighth Annual
Meeting of the Australian District begun in York Street
Chapel, Sydney, on Thursday, 30th July, 1846’ ’ as “assist-
ant missionary” and a “Preacher on trial.” He was
recommended to be stationed at Goulburn. The only equip-
ment at Goulburn recorded is “two acres of land in the
town. ’ ’
In 1847 Lightbody had completed his fourth year and
it was recommended he be received into full connexion. It
was reported of Goulburn:
“A new chapel is about to be erected of brick, 40 feet by 25
feet in the clear.”
The report on the Goulburn circuit stated that the class
had increased from 5 to 22, the congregation to 150, the
temporary chapel was crowded, subscriptions of £2OO had
been promised towards the new chapel. Six persons were
engaged in teaching 30 children in the Sabbath School.

lVesLtya.ro Chapel*
The Eev. W. B. Boyce, principal superintendent of Wes-
leyan Missions in Australia and Van Diemen’s land preached
in the Wesleyan Chapel on Sunday, 14th January, 1849.
“The Reverend gentleman delivered a most eloquent and edify-
ing discourse and a liberal collection towards liquidating the
chapel debt was made at its conclusion.”*
The first Preachers’ Plan, prepared by the Rev. Wm.
Lightbody, contains the names of Robert Blatchford and
Henry Goldsmith as preachers and Matthew Trenery, Robert
Blatchford, Hy. Goldsmith, Hy. Neily, Mary Blatchford,
Sarah Holgate, Robert Neily and Lucy Jacobs as members
of the church. Services were held in Goulburn, three each
Sunday, Bangalore fortnightly, “Inverality” monthly, Crook-
well and Binda monthly, Gunning twice a month, Bannaby
once a month on Wednesdays, Collector once a month on
Fridays and Richlands once a month on Thursdays. Ser-
vices were also held at Bush Oak Park, Joraway, Brushes’
Farm, Stans, and Queanbeyan. In 1848 Methodism was
reported as extending to Yass, Gundagai and Bungendore.
In 1849 James Somerville from England was appointed to
Goulburn and Wm. Lightbody to Queanbeyan. The debt
on the first chapel was £6O. An acre had been granted
for a burial ground. “The prejudices of many against
Methodism are fading.. . „ the congregation is an improving
state.” A chapel was built of brick, 40 feet by 25 feet, a
dignified building of the old Colonial style. It was opened
by the Rev. Mr. Harris of Sydney, on the 23/4/1848 and cost
£255. The Rev. B. Hurst, after whom Hurst Street is
named, was the minister at the time. The parsonage of
this time was in Auburn Street. In 1853 a two-roomed
dwelling for the chapel-keeper was built. The next year

a parsonage adjoining the chapel was built. The people con-
tributed £llOO and the Chapel Committee £3OO. Between
1854 and 1870 when the present church was built, the old
chapel was enlarged to double its former size.
A “ Tabular View of the Wesleyan Missions in Austra-
lia at the close of 1853” gives the following particulars:
“Goulburn and Araluen Goldfields: Chapels 2, other preaching
places 28, missionaries 2, Sabbath School teachers 15, local
preachers 7, full and accredited church members 109, on trial
for membership 4, Sabbath schools 3, Sabbath scholars 119,
male 52, female 67, attendance at Public Worship including
members and scholars, 900.”*
Which last mentioned figure would appear to be an
exaggeration or to indicate a tremendous disparity between
members, scholars and worshippers, for five years later the
total number of Wesleyans in Goulburn is returned as 302. f
The parsonage was still in Auburn Street. In the fifties
too a small church was built in Auburn Street South. This
was sold later.
The “Stations of Ministers or preachers on trial in the
Australian Wesleyan Methodist Connection” in 1865 included
“Goulburn District— H. H. Gaud, W. H. George.” At the
annual meeting of the Wesleyan Church Extension and Sus-
tentation Society in 1867 a report was read shewing receipts
from the whole colony £lO4l/2/9, of which the Goulburn
District contributed £IOB/1/94
The foundation stone of the present church was laid on
the 31/3/1870; the Rev. Wm. Curnow was then the minister.
At the opening services the amount collected was £3lB, mak-
ing the total amount raised to that time, £2510. The
lecture hall was built as the chapel in 1848 and extended
first in 1879. A copy of the Goulburn Circuit “Quarterly
Record and Plan of Preachers’ appointments for November,
December, 1891, and January 1892,” is in the Mitchell
Library. There were 12 centres worked (this was before
Methodist Reunion) and there were 11 local preachers help-
ing in the work. The Wesleyan Church celebrated its
jubilee from the 31/10/1897 to 9/11/1897. The historical
account published then differs in some respects from the
foregoing. The names of the two local preachers of 1846
are given as H. Saxby of Gunning and R. H. Blatchford.

The latter was drowned in the Wollondilly returning from
the country in 1874. An historical account of the Sunday
School was published at the same time. This contained
some inaccuracies too which were pointed out by the local
press.* Methodist Union took effect on the 1/1/1902 but
it was stipulated that for three years subsequent to the date
of organic union the uniting churches, circuits and stations
should continue to be worked unless they previously decided
to unite.
The Goldsmith Street Methodist Sabbath School cele-
brated its diamond jubilee from the 10/11/1907. There
were then 41 officers and teachers on the roll and 309
scholars. Wm. Davies, was superintendent for 33 years.
Another Sunday School teacher with a long record of ser-
vice was Richard Chambers. He was described as the
“Overseer” of the Goulburn “Herald.’ ’ On the 9/5/1881
the “officers and teachers of the Wesleyan Sabbath School”
gave him an address and a gold watch and chain.
He had been connected with the Sunday School from
1854. He left Goulburn for Hay where he bought the
“Hay Standard.” In 1922 a new block of Sunday School
buildings was built at the rear of the Lecture Hall at a
cost of £1450. The church, lecture hall and spire were re-
roofed in 1926 at a cost of £ISOO. The new parsonage was
built during the ministry of the Rev. Bernard Deane. It
was opened on the 29/4/1939 by Mrs. Deane. H. C. Man-
fred was the architect and Kibler and Norris the contractors.
The number of Methodist ministers since 1846 is so great
as to render it impossible to print the list here. It may be
read from 1846 to 1934 in the “Back to Goldsmith Street”
booklet, written in 1934 by the Rev. J. H. A. Sorrell.
A society class was formed at North Goulburn about
1869 by James Hodges and the meetings were held at Mrs.
Porter’s house. The work lapsed. It was begun again
in 1887 when a cottage prayer meeting at R. Kennedy’s
house was begun by Mrs. Tudor. That too lapsed ancl a
fresh start was made in 1888. A church was built, the
foundation stone of which was laid by Mrs. Wombey on the
12/10/1888. The cost was £239/15/-, the contractors
Everett and Godfrey. The church was opened on the

13/1/1889. It functioned as a church for a while, then for
many years as a Sunday School and from 1936 as a church
again. The Rev. A. J. Webb was the minister when it was
begun, with A. Smith as his assistant.*
In 1911 the Cowper Street Methodists bought from the
Salvation Army the wooden citadel then in Coromandel
Street and transferred it to the site upon which the present
brick church in Cowper Street stands. It was opened on
the 22/9/1911. In 1924 it was moved back upon this site
to serve as a Sunday School and the present brick church
was built upon the frontage, f Other daughter churches are
Merrilla (1859), Parkesbourne (1866), Thurlow, Yarra,
Kingsdale and Kenmore.
In 1856 the Rev. Wm. Colloy was appointed to the Primi-
tive Methodist charge in Goulburn, his district extending
from Bowral to Monaro, from Jerrawa to Tarlo. The founda-
tion of the first church in Bradley Street was laid by R.
Waring, solicitor, on the 6/9/1858. Later the church was
enlarged and altered. The Rev. J. Studds (later Canon
Studds of the Anglican Communion) was appointed in 1878.
The church and cottage were sold by Finlay and Coy. on the
25/9/1878, to Duncan for £4OO.
The new church was built in 1878 upon the same piece
of ground, but facing Lagoon Street. It was designed by
H. 0. Bell and cost £ISOO. The foundation stone was laid
on the 13/8/1878 by Wm. Davies; that of the new parsonage
on the 6/4/1881. The foundation stone of the new Primi-
tive Methodist Sunday School was laid on the 12/7/1895.
The Primitive Methodist Conference was held in Goulburn
in 1900. The Hon. J. Cook, M.P., took part in several dis-
cussions on Methodist Union. In 1901 the two circuits,
Goldsmith Street and Lagoon Street (Primitive) arranged
for frequent interchange of pulpits and for united meetings
to prepare the way for successful union. After Methodist
reunion the Lagoon Street chapel functioned as a separate
charge from 1902 to 1913, when it was amalgamated with
the Goldsmith Street Circuit.:):

Salvation Army.
Goulburn has no reason to be proud of its reception of
the Salvation Army in 1883. It was met with hostility and
bigotry almost amounting to persecution. The police
hounded it off the streets and larrikins interrupted its
meetings. The press was hostile to the point of intolerance.
The “Herald,” e.g. always printed “Army” and “Soldiers”
and all titles in inverted commas. It was stated that the
“Hallelujah Lassies” and the “Band” tended “to cast ridi-
cule upon religion.” It concluded complacently “that
Goulburn is not so bad as to call for the ‘ heroic’ treatment
these people seek to supply.Major Sutherland’s diary
is extant. It records “he opened fire on Goulburn No. 7,
in the Oddfellows’ Hall on Saturday, Ist September, 1883.”
The Army’s opening services on Sunday 2nd September,
1883, were reported with the same hostility and prejudice,
despite the fact that 2000 people were present at the Odd-
fellows’ Hall in the afternoon and 1500 at night. In the
meantime the police had chased the Army from the streets
to Belmore Park. The press stated “that the audience upon
the whole was very orderly and for the most part appeared
chiefly actuated by curiosity.” Major Sutherland conducted
the services.! Four years later the papers were still in-
dulging in cheap witticisms at the expense of the Army.
The “Southern Argus” suggested that there would be no
future punishment for those who had endured the Army
band in this life, that the local cats turned green with envy
when they heard it, and that the band might consider the
purchase of “a few foghorns, set to slow music and slightly
out of repair.” It too always printed “Army” in inverted
commas and took an inveterate delight in publishing para-
graphs from its exchanges reflecting on the Army or such
as recorded disturbances at its meetings. X
In 1884 a Goulburn lady summoned a Salvation Army
officer on a peculiar charge. He had offered her a copy of
the “War Cry” and she told him to clear out, whereupon he
told her that she was going to hell and knelt down and
prayed for her. The magistrate said people must not be
spoken to like that and fined the officer 5/-.§

§ Gbn. “Herald,” 31/7/1884.


A little later the “Penny Post” published some verses
entitled “By-and Bye.” One stanza began:
“The Army captains will not preach
The Army lassies will not screech
etc., etc.
By and Bye/’
On another occasion a sub-leader advised parents to keep
their daughters away from the “Saturnalias at the Bar-
racks/’* In the early eighties the Army built weatherboard
barracks at the corner of Coromandel and Addison Streets.
In 1913 it sold this building to the Methodists, who removed
it to Cowper Street. In 1887 A. B. Beer was appointed
bandmaster, although then only 18 years of age. He held
the appointment for eight years, f
By 1890 the press notices of the Salvation Army were
improving though still far from sympathetic. One of the
better references to Army activities in Goulburn was in the
1 i Illustrated Sydney News: ’’
“And now that we are talking of churches, can nothing be said
of the Salvation Army? They do not, it is true, come very
much in evidence by way of edifices in Goulburn, but they are
very much so in other ways. Their ‘barracks’ are an un-
important, dull-looking room standing back from Auburn Street,
but their trumpets may be heard braying and their drums beat-
ing every Sunday morning, afternoon and night, with occasional
sallies from their citadel during the week. A vacant spot in
Auburn Street.. .. often presents a somewhat weird scene, with
some flaring torches within a crowd gathered round a lusty-
voiced preacher. If perseverance and disregard of difficulty
will win success for a cause, success seems promised here. At
all events these “feeble folk” as some regard them, afford an
example of energy and of confidence in their cause which many
who have more show of strength would do well to emulate.”!
The press was still a little unfriendly to the Salvation
Army as late as 1891. A set of verses in the “Penny Post”
concluded :
“They will not pawn the army drum
Nor cease those fearful tunes to hum
in 1891.”$
Its second citadel was in Auburn Street in the section
north of Clifford Street. In 1892/3 it disposed of these
premises, which first became a dance hall, and later were
reopened as the “Prohibition” Hall when that was a live
issue. In 1895 the premises were given up “on account
of the depression. ’ ’ In 1892 the Salvation Army purchased

from the Y.M.C.A. the present citadel. It gave £2250 for
the property. The new citadel was opened with a big
demonstration extending over the 3rd, 4th and sth of Decem-
ber, 1892.
By this time the newspapers were becoming a little
more Christian towards the Army, besides the Army itself
was becoming news. All the same some sarcasm crept into
the press report. The “Penny Post,” e.g. said the dedica-
tion took place
“amidst all the vehemence, din and enthusiasm which this
modern crusade against the kingdom of darkness is capable of.”
Brigadier Rothwell performed the opening ceremony.
The newspaper went on to describe the enthusiasm as “ex-
travagant” and the musical portion of the service as
“a terrific onslaught on harmony by 15 brass instruments, a
big drum, two fiddles, and 50 to 60 lusty throats.”
and added unkindly
“at the risk of carrying away the roof and rafters this hurri-
cane of joy was repeated several times during the evening.”*
General William Booth visited Goulburn twice. His
first visit was somewhat of a disappointment in that his
engagements did not permit of his breaking his journey.
The precincts of the railway station were crowded when he
left the Melbourne express to give a five minutes ’ address.f
He visited Goulburn on the 21/11/1895 and was met at the
station by the mayor and aldermen, who presented an ad-
dress of welcome. His public meeting that night was a
tremendous success. Chas. Rogers lent the Arcadia Hall;
the mayor presided. Two bands and 60 officers accompanied
the General. His topic was the social work of the Salvation
Army. He spoke for If hours and the press gave three
columns to his speech.:); The subsequent history of the Army
in Goulburn is one of steady if uneventful progress. The
Divisional Headquarters are located here. The Gill benefac-
tion and the Gill Memorial Home are referred to in another
chapter. The changes in the officers stationed here are too
numerous to record in detail.
General Evangeline Booth spent a week in retirement
at Winderradeen Station in 1935 but undertook no public
engagements in Goulburn.

Jews.
The history of Jewish worship in Goulburn is not easy
to trace. Mention has been made in earlier chapters of the
number and influence of Jews in the forties and fifties of
last century. The building known as the Jewish Synagogue
was not built as such. It was built by N. C. Phillips as a
summer house in the Lansdowne garden. * On the other
hand there is little reason to doubt that when the Lans-
downe property was held by S. Emanuel it was used for
private family Hebrew worship. It was never used as a
synagogue nor did any Jewish Rabbi minister there.!
The English "Voice of Jacob” of the 6/6/1845 said:
“At Goulburn, an inland town 170 miles to the southward,
services were performed at the residence of Mr. Elias Moses,
who has recently given an acre of land for a Jewish Cemetery,
about seventeen persons attended.”!
The Jewish community in Goulburn was both numerous
and important from the forties to the seventies of last cen-
tury. For the greater part of that time it operated through
the "Goulburn Hebrew Association.” Every adherent of
the faith contributed to a common fund. This fund was
maintained by voluntary weekly subscriptions and by special
collections on such occasions as "beris,” "barmitzbah,” and
marriages. That fund provided first of all for the Ark
and the Scrolls (£20 was expended on these). It paid for
the conduct of services, mainly on such high festivals as the
Day of Atonement and the Passover. These services were
conducted by laymen in private houses. That common fund
was chargeable also with charitable relief, the support of
indigent members, hospital dues for members, etc. When
for instance Silkman, mentioned elsewhere in this history
as a barber and a draper, failed in Goulburn, the Hebrew
Association financed a fresh start in Sydney for him. The
cash book recording all these transactions from 1852 to 1878
is extant. In that year Collins took the communal equip-
ment and the funds and handed them over to the Great
Synagogue in Sydney. The Hebrew congregation in Goul-
burn by this time had dwindled to nothing. Collins the last
executive officer of the Hebrew Association is noted else-
where in this history as a cheap-jack. He was subsequently

a grocer, moneylender and an alderman of the city. The
Annual Hebrew meeting in 1854 was held at the residence
of Samuel Davis. A sum of £25 was granted for the relief
of famishing Jews in Palestine. Samuel Davis was elected
president, Joseph Collins, treasurer, and P. S. Solomon,
honorary reader.
Some Hebrew marriages were celebrated in Goulburn:
“On the Bth instant, at his residence, Argyle Store, Goulburn,
by Mr. Strelitz, reader of the Goulburn Congregation, Mr. Moss
Marks to Esther, relict of the late Mr. Isaac Davis of Boorowa.”*
By two Crown Grants each dated 10th January 1853,
one and one half acres of land at the corner of Auburn and
Addison Streets, Goulburn, (now part of the site of the
South Goulburn Public School) were granted to Samuel
Davis, Samuel Benjamin and Nathan Mandelson as Trustees
for the Jewish Community of Goulburn numbering then
about one hundred persons, in trust for erection on the lands
of a synagogue and school.
No buildings were erected upon the land in pursuance
of the trusts and in 1891 the land was resumed by the De-
partment of Education and by agreement with the then
trustees the compensation payable was settled at £BOO, and
the money lodged with the Master in Equity.
In 1935 when the fund had grown by accretions of com-
pound interest to £2618/17/11 the Court made a declaration
that the money constituted a dormant fund and directed
payment into the Treasury.
By Petition heard before Mr. Justice Roper on Friday
the 29th March 1940, the present trustees Orwell Phillips,
John Goulston and Lewis George Cohen applied for payment
out of £2618/17/11 together with interest accrued since the
date of payment into the Treasury and for a reference to the
Master in Equity to settle a scheme for the application cy
pres of the fund. The scheme advocated by the Trustees
provided for the establishing of a Hebrew School at North
Bondi where special services might be held on the High
Festivals and certain Sabbaths. Among the affidavit evid-
ence was one from Mrs. Fanny Samuel stating that she
departed from Goulburn with her people in the year 1874
and that all the Jewish families which were known to her
at the time of her departure had since left the district, also

one from Edmund Cooper Manfred, retired architect of Goul-
burn, stating that no Jewish community had existed since
the time of his arrival in Goulburn in 1882. Another af-
fidavit showed that the community which in 1856 comprised
46 males and 75 females had decreased in 1933 to four males
only.
His Honour made an order for payment by the Colonial
Treasurer to the Master in Equity and for payment by the
Master in Equity to the Petitioners of the sum of £2618/17/11
and directed the Master in Equity to settle a scheme for
the application of the funds cy pres the original trust.*
The Baptist Church.f
In the following account of Baptist activities in Goul-
burn references from 1840 to 1893 relate to the “Particular”
Baptists, those from 1893 to 1941 to “General” Baptists.
There is no reference in either local press accounts or the
minutes of the Baptist Church in Goulburn to the Baptist
reunion of 1891. Possibly this is due to the fact that
Baptist ministrations here were suspended in the late
eighties and early nineties, but the list of foundation mem-
bers of the present church in the 1893 minutes contains a
number of names of former adherents or members of the
old Particular Baptist Church. When Baptist ministrations
actually began in Goulburn is obscure. It was at an early
date and most probably in 1840. The congregation is not
mentioned in the census of 1841, but was probably included
in or may have comprised the “Other Protestant Dissenters”
who totalled 14. Judge Burton, writing in 1838, makes no
mention of Baptists, ministrations, buildings or Sunday
School. The first Robert Craig, who came to Goulburn in
1837, began services soon afterwards. In July 1843, it was
announced that a piece of ground had been secured “near
Mr. Bull’s new buildings” for the purpose “of erecting a
Baptist Chapel, which will be proceeded with immediately.”!
That year the first chapel was built in Clifford Street. R. H.
Tuttlebee’s cottage stands upon the site. Robert Craig
helped to build it and, after it was built, conducted services
* S. B. Glass, 25/6/1940. * “5.M.H.,” 27/7/1843.
t Except where stated otherwise the facts in this section are derived
from the Bapt. Ch. Mins. Gbn., 1893/1940; searches by Mit-
chell Librarian and Dr. W. T. Whitley, Bapt. Union, Ldn.,
and all directories 1843/1857.


in it for many years. The Goulbnrn correspondent of the
“Sydney Morning Herald’' recorded in 1843 that a small
Baptist chapel had been “lately erected.”* That first chapel
was described as an “old square building.” At the time
it was pulled down the press report stated “it was erected
60 years ago and in it the late Mr. Robert Craig used to
conduct Divine Service and teach a Sunday School, the first
in Goulbnrn. ”f There is a discrepancy here both in date
and fact.
The Baptist churches in Australia in 1857 numbered
five, three in Sydney, one in Brisbane and “Goulbnrn: Robert
Craig.” Curiously enough there are no Baptist adherents
enumerated in 1858, but again they must have been included
in the totals of other denominations. These early begin-
nings of Baptist worship in Goulbnrn seem to have attracted
very little attention. G. R. Nichols made a compilation of
references to the Baptist Church from the Sydney “Gazette,”
“Sydney Morning Herald,” etc., which collection he gave
to the Mitchell Library, and Wm. Higlett used this in his
“Early Australian Baptist History” printed in 1926. He
does not mention Goulbnrn. The Parramatta Baptists
issued a little history in 1933. That does not mention
Goulbnrn either. The life of the Rev. John Bunyan McCure,
who established the Particular Baptist Church in Sydney
and visited and worked other centres and States, also con-
tains no reference to Goulbnrn. Nor does the historical
account in the Australian Baptist Magazine of 1858/9.
The Rev. John Walters, a Particular Baptist, appears
to have been in charge of the Baptist Church here at least
in 1842 and 1843 and possibly before and after those years.
He arrived from England by the “Westminster” on the
27/6/1838. Press references to his movements and work
are rare. He is mentioned as working in Goulbnrn in 1842,
as having been present at the opening of the Baptist Church
in 1843 and at a levee at Government House in 1844. He
returned to England shortly afterwards. There is only one
New South Wales Directory which covers these years and
it shews Walters as resident in Goulbnrn in 1843.
Further light is shed upon Walters’ ministry by the
following extract from a long article on Goulbnrn in the
“Sydney Morning Herald” in 1842:
* 29/11/1843. t Gbn. “Herald,” 15/5/1883, 2/5/1898.


“It may not be unacceptable for general information, to give
a list of those in business, as well as those who labour in word
and doctrine, etc., and first we have the Rev. Mr. Sowerby,
Church of England; Rev. Mr. Hamilton, Presbyterian; Rev.
Mr. Walters, Baptist; Rev. Mr. M’Grath, Roman Catholic; all
of whom are assiduous in their respective charges.
There is a public subscription making for the unfortunate
individual who had his house swept away by the late flood, and
to aid in the course of Christian sympathy there was a collection
made by the Rev. Mr. Walters’ congregation last Sunday, and
the proceeds applied in furnishing clothes, etc.” 4 "
The Rev. John Walters is believed to have been sub-
sequently Pastor of Earls Colne in England in 1851. That
church unfortunately has preserved no records so it is not
possible to say whence be came. He left there in 1859,
living in retirement at Southhampton until 1870. No obit-
uary notice can be traced “in any obvious place.”
The Goulburn correspondent of the “Sydney Morning
Herald” wrote on the 27/5/1844:
“The annual examination of the Congregational Sabbath School
took place in the Baptist Chapel on Friday, the 24th instant...
in presence of a respectable assemblage of ladies of all denomina-
tions, who seemed to take a particular interest in religious
instruction, and who provided for the juvenile festival tea, plum-
cake, confectionery, etc.... The place of meeting was decorated
with flowers in the centre of which was placed a crown sus-
pended from the ceiling.”!
C. Meehan also wrote of 1845:
“The children attending the Sabbath School when examined
were able to repeat from memory several hundred texts of sacred
Scripture which they had learned during the year.”*
He also recalled the tea-meetings of the sixties in the
old church and that at one of these meetings a big balloon
ascent was made. A collection was made “on the Sabbath”
(27/8/1854) by the children of the Sabbath School Baptist
Chapel “on behalf of the wives and children brought into
distress by the Eastern War.” The collection amounted to
“about thirty shillings.”§
Old Robert Craig continued to minister and teach in
his little chapel until his death on the 4/1/1881. The chapel
was closed for a while after his death. It was “redecorated
and reopened” on the 13/5/1883.|| There is some confusion
here because both before and after this date the congregation
is reported as worshipping elsewhere. When the chapel

was demolished in 1898 the press report said that the build-
ing had not been used “for many years” and was “occupied
by tramps.” Despite the restoration of the old chapel the
congregation led a nomadic existence for twenty years. In
the early eighties it was worshipping in the Oddfellows’ Hall.
In 1883 it was in the Protestant Hall. Then in the late
eighties it ceased to meet altogether. Early in 1893 ser-
vices were resumed by the Rev. D. J. Graham. He, apparently,
was sent by the Baptist Union to Gonlbnrn for two months.
However, a petition from the congregation was presented
to the Baptist Union for his retention and the extension of
his term. R. T. Ball took the chair at the meeting which
decided “to form a church at an early date.” #
The “Penny Post” records that in 1893 “after a break
of some years” the Baptists assembled for worship “for the
first time” at the Academy of Music on Sunday, 12th Feb-
ruary, 1893. The Rev. J. A. Soper of Petersham, preached
both morning and evening. The press report continues
quaintly: “throughout both services there was not a dull
moment. ’ ’ It concluded:
“Mr. Soper will preach the next two Sundays, and will be
followed in due course by other ministers from Sydney, till a
minister likely to be successful in the work can be found. The
work at present is entirely in the hands of the N.S.W. Baptist
Union.”!
The minutes of the Baptist Church record these happen-
ings in greater detail and in more reverent language:
“With unbounded gratitude to God we are pleased to record
the fact that God through His grace has been pleased tb give
us as a church and people an opportunity of bringing prominently
before the inhabitants of this city the truth as made known to
men by the inspired word. Hence February 1893, was a month
of great joy and gladness to all those who having been saved
by sovereign grace and followed their Lord through the waters
of Baptism, it being the month when the Rev. J. A. Soper of
Sydney was permitted to visit Goulburn to preach the everlasting
Gospel and uphold the doctrine of believer baptism as taught
in the Divine Word.”
The names of some of the ministers supplying the charge
in 1893 have been preserved. They include: Frederick
Hibberd (Ashfield), April and August; Wm. Taylor (Bal-
main), April; D. J. Graham (Melbourne), six months in all
(he was afterwards to be appointed to the charge); W.
Coller, July; J. Soper, again in August; Stephen Sharp, who
* “E.P.P.,” 10/1/1893. t Ibid. 14/2/1893.


held the first services in the Town Hall on the 24/11/1893;
H. Clark, October; and E. Fox (Queanbeyan), November.
The Rev. F. E. Harry (Bathurst Street), also conducted some
services. The following week the “Penny Post” said the
“excellent congregations” contained a “large sprinkling”
from other churches “especially the Church of England,
which was numerously represented. ” # Later in that year
and for some years afterwards the congregation met in the
Town Hall. A laconic note in the minutes says:
“On account of Mr. Coller who was appointed sec. from the
formation of the Church not furnishing any account of Minutes
of Church Meetings held we have no record from August to
November. ,,
The Baptist Union fixed the 13/8/1893 “as the day
upon which the church here will be formed.” The meeting
was duly held, the Rev. P. Hibberd, chairman of the Baptist
Union presiding. The requisition had been signed by 18
members; 25 present accepted the obligations of member-
ship. Messrs. Hockey and Milton were elected deacons.
The Lord’s Supper was then administered, 30 participating.
One immediate outcome of all this stirring was a hectic
newspaper controversy on the subject of infant baptism,
between the Rev. F. E. Harry of the Bathurst Street, Sydney,
Baptist Church, and the Rev. G. M. D’Arcy Irvine, D.D.,
of St. Nicholas’, North Goulburn. Editors and readers
were long-suffering in those days; the letters were of in-
ordinate length, one of D‘Arcy Irvine’s extending over two
columns. The first “public baptismal service” was held
in the Academy of Music on Sunday 12th November, 1893,
the Rev. D. J. Graham officiating. A large crowd was
attracted.
“The receptacle for the water was a tank or bath so arranged
that the water could not be seen. A piece of scenery—a wing—
was placed on either side and in front was a row of pot plants
The appearance of the first candidate as she emerged from
the water excited the risible faculties of some of the audience
and there was much tittering.”!
In the minutes Hockey is paid £5 for making the bap-
tistry, Marsfield 5/- for carting it to the Academy of Music,
Judd £2 for the hire of the hall and the “Star” newspaper
£4/6/- for advertising the service. In December that year
the congregation was worshipping in the Town Hall, but
meeting for other purposes in the Coromandel Street hall
* 21/2/1893. t “E.P.P.,” 14/11/1893,


Meetings and services were held in various homes also.
From the 3/6/1894 to the 17/6/1894 "Special Baptist Ser-
vices’? were conducted in the Town Hall by the Rev. A. J.
Clarke, Dr. Thomas Porter, the Rev. W. R. Hiddlestone, the
Rev. Henry Clarke, and William White, the latter president
of the Baptist Union. # Curiously enough there is no mention
of these services and meetings in the church minutes.
The Baptist Church held its "First Anniversary” on
the 14/8/1894. Two hundred people were present at the
tea meeting. The first annual accounts showed £l6l/9/9
raised for the year, of which stipend absorbed £SB and rent
£56. The Baptist Union provided the balance of the stipend
viz., £IOO in 1893, and £75 in 1894.
The Baptist Sunday School was established in 1894. At
the third anniversary in 1897 the school numbered 100
scholars and 11 teachers. S. B. Hockey was its superin-
tendent and P. Brasnett the leader of the Bible class. The
congregation soon began to worry about a permanent home.
In 1894 it opened up negotiations with the Baptist Union
about the sale of the old chapel in Clifford Street. In 1897
the committee purchased a site in Montague Street from the
Commercial Bank for £230. Several references in the
minutes about this time would suggest that the congregation
did not at this time consider it had any interest in, claim on
or title to the Clifford Street property. Services were con-
templated in 1894 at Kingsdale, Tirranna, Boxer’s Creek
and Yarra. Some of these must have been held for there
are other references to a horse and trap. The Rev. J. Wor-
boys (Bathurst), conducted a 10 days’ mission in the Town
Hall in 1898. In 1900 the Sunday School was still 100
scholars strong with 9 teachers. That year the congrega-
tion moved back to the Oddfellows’ Hall. In 1901 when
the congregation was thinking seriously of building a new
church the A.M.P. Society offered it "Trinity Presbyterian
Church” in Bourke Street when that congregation reunited
with St. Andrew’s.
When this building was erected by the "South Goul-
burn Presbyterians” E. C. Manfred was the architect and C.
Goode and Sons the contractors. The Baptist congregation

gave £650 for it. It was opened as the Baptist Church on
Sunday, 30th June, 1901, the Rev. W. Southwell, president
of the Baptist Union, performing the ceremony. The first
meeting in the church on the 26/6/1901 is recorded in the
minutes, but not the opening. The church site in Montague
Street was then sold. The charge was apparently vacant
in 1903/4/5, although the Rev. W. Taylor appears in the
minute books as taking services and presiding at meetings,
he does not appear on the Registrar-General J s list of min-
isters authorised to/ celebrate marriages. In 1905 services
were begun in Kenmore village. In 1906 under pressure
from the Baptist Union, the Clifford Street property was
sold for £72. The Christian Endeavour Society held its
first social in the Temperance Hall on the 20/1/1902. There
were 60 present.
From 1907 the pastor was maintained by the Baptist
Home Mission Society, the Goulburn congregation undertak-
ing to refund £9 per month. In this year cottage meetings
in various parts of the town were begun, and open air ser-
vices on Sunday afternoons in Belmore Park. In 1912 the
Home Mission assessment was raised to £l2 per month. The
Individual Cup was adopted in 1916. Services were begun
at Tallong. Electric light was installed in the church in
1918. A church was built and opened free of debt at Tarlo
Gap that same year. The “monthly supply’ ’ system en-
dured until 1921 when the congregation petitioned for the
appointment of a permanent pastor. The church declared
itself a “self-supporting church” as from the 1/8/1922.
In 1922 the Tarlo Gap Church, on account of removals,
was no longer required. It was brought into Bourke Street
and re-erected on the church site as a Sunday School. Open
air services at the corner of Clifford and Auburn Streets
were begun in 1923. In 1928 services were begun at Ko-
mungla by Bro. E. Charles. A tent mission was conducted
in 1930. The manse is at the corner of Montague and Cow-
per Streets. The foundation stone was laid on the 19th
August, 1939 by the Rev. F. E. Peffer. It cost £1350, which
cost was kept down by voluntary labour on the part of the
congregation. The builder was G. L. White, treasurer and
senior deacon. The manse was opened by the president
of the Baptist Union, the Rev. W. L. Jarvis, on the 18th
November, 1939.


The Baptists in Goulburn have contributed two gems of
unconscious humour to the annals of the city. One was in
1903 when the Rev. R. Williamson announced the subject
of his farewell sermon as “The Dried-up Brook.” The
other was more recent. On one notice board at the church
it announced a special preacher for the following Sunday
with his topic. Adjoining it was the weekly “Friendly
Message“ Don’t Worry—It may never happen. ’ 9
The Rev. F. B. Meyer, D.D., visited Oonlbnrn on the
14/8/1923. He preached on Reunion in St. Saviour’s
Cathedral.*
Christian Science.
The formal organization of Christian Science services
in Goulburn began in 1931, when a number of students, who
had been meeting for some time in a private house, decided
to form a group and to meet in a public hall. Regular
Church services on Sundays, and Testimony meetings on
Wednesday evenings, have been held ever since. It was
in 1937 that the Society was formally recognized as a Branch
of the Mother Church.f
Other Denominations.
From time to time various “undenominational” or
“inter-denominational” missions have been active in Goul-
burn, sometimes for considerable periods, sometimes only on
itinerating visits. It is impossible to record them all now.
The following would seem to have made some impression
at the time or for other reasons are noticed here.
The Rev. J. Westwood, assisted by “Mr. and Mrs.
Millard” was conducting an “unsectarian mission” in Goul-
burn in 1875. The meetings were held in “Mr. Millard’s
paddock, opposite the manse.” Millard was known as “the
blind temperance advocate.” He was in business in Goul-
burn as a basket-maker. One of Westwood’s advertisements
described Mrs. Millard as a “lineal descendant of John
Bunyan.”t
The Goulburn Women’s Christian Endeavour Mission
and Nursing Sisterhood was meeting in 1891 at the Y.M.C.A.
hall.§

A “Union” Church was advertised as to be opened on
the 5/6/1892. Later it was advertised as the “ Congrega-
tional” Church. It was conducted at the Academy of
Music by “Pastor” Cotching, formerly the secretary of the
Y.M.C.A. in Goulburn and who left that body after a mis-
understanding. Rev. W. Rutledge complained that Cot-
ching had not kept his word to work on Y.M.C.A. lines.
“Now,” he said, “he has started another church.. .that had
already been advertised under two or three different names. ’ ’
He understood that the Congregational Union had “dis-
claimed all knowledge of Mr. Cotching. ”*
Various Gospel missions have met from time to time
in the old Temperance Hall or the Druids’ Hall in Gold-
smith Street. One of the earliest of these was an “Adult
Bible Class: Undenominational.” This was conducted by
W. Nowland as leader in 1906. A wicked story is told of
one of these missions. It advertised “The Pure Gospel is
preached here every Sunday night at 6.30 p.m.” A schism
occurring in its ranks the breakaways are said to have ad-
vertised a few doors further down the street “The Still
Purer Gospel is preached here, etc.” The “People’s Own”
services were conducted in the Mechanics’ Hall in 1911. W.
H. Wheatley was president. This was a branch of the
London Society of that name.
The Chapman-Alexander Mission visited Goulburn for
a week in 1912. f
The Rev. W. P. Nicholson conducted an evangelistic mis-
sion in the Broadway Theatre in June 1926. Picture shows
were described as “Vestibules of Hell,” smokers as “stink-
ing polecats,” and girls and women who attended dances as
“women of easy virtue.” His campaign proved an em-
barrassment to the denominations who sponsored it. A
bucket of water was emptied over him at one meeting but
missed its mark, drenching the pianist instead. “I have
been saved by God,” the missioner exclaimed. In a sermon
in St. Saviour’s Cathedral Bishop Radford succinctly re-
marked that “there was always room in the world for a
John the Baptist, but not for a vulgar Baptist,” Eventually
the missioner fell foul of the press and the “Penny Post”
refused to mention so much as his name.J

Dr. Kagawa, the distinguished Japanese Christian, was
a visitor to Goulburn in 1935. He addressed the Churches
and the Rotary Club.*
The Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah’s Wit-
nesses and other bodies have worked here for varying
periods as have certain itinerating tent missions.
The “Ministers’ Union,” the forerunner of the present
“Ministers’ Fraternal,” was formed in 1901. It embraces
all the non-Roman churches. From time to time it has
arranged inter-denominational prayer meetings and services
and has taken joint action in certain emergencies.!

CHAPTER XXIV.
SPORT.
HE hounds of the Argyle Hunt used to meet as far
back as 1836 at the back of Rossiville and the run
extended to Breadalbane. They generally captured
a native dog. There were 30 subscribers and 16 couples
of hounds. They met also at Springfield and at Thorn’s
waterhole.* Fisher, who also kept hounds, had a meet at
Thorn’s Bridge. This was in 1858. Various attempts were
made to revive hunting as, e.g. by Supt. Morisset, but with-
out success. On one occasion the hounds of the Sydney
Hunt Club were brought to Goulburn and some exciting runs
were experienced in the neighbourhood of Tirranna. This
was in the early nineties. There are many references to
kangaroo and wallaby hunting in the early newspapers. As
late as 1877 kangaroo and wallaby hunting on Governor’s
Hill was described as affording “excellent sport.”f The
dimensions of a kangaroo caught near Goulburn, the year
is not stated, are given as “9 feet from tip to tip, tail 4 feet,
head 11 \ inches, tail weighed lbs.” Another one was
caught which measured 10 feet 6 inches from tip to tip.J
The Goulburn Gun Club is mentioned as early as 1890.
“Popular amongst shooters” was the Goulburn Sparrow
Club. In 1901 it rented the Olympic ground and offered
3d a pair for sparrows.
Pigeon shooting was indulged in on the Victoria Recrea-
tion Ground and other places in the seventies. Henry
Payten advertised:
“Knights of the Trigger,” and “Five hundred good strong birds
will be provided.”
After that such advertisements are frequent all through
the eighties. Another Gun Club was formed in 1920.
There are a few references to fishing as, e.g. when in
1888 the Government sent 167 brown trout to Goulburn and
“a man named Gordon” to liberate them in the Wollon-
dilly. Previously in 1883 a “Fish Acclimatisation Society”
had been formed. It raised some funds but did not proceed
to stock local streams with trout. The subscriptions were
returned. §

Writing in 1935 W. A. G. Grander recalled that in the
early fifties
“on special occasions athletic sports were held on the Market
Square. The usual programme comprised, climbing a greasy
pole, catching a pig with a greasy tail, bobbing for rolls and
treacle with hands tied behind the back, diving into a tub full
of water in which small silver coins were thrown. But a
wheel-barrow race was the climax.... the course a straight
line from Auburn Street to Sloane Street.”
The contestants were blindfolded and few of them
reached their destination.
“When night came. ... lighted tar-barrels were rolled from
one end of Auburn Street to the other, and as they collapsed,
still burning, there was a line of bon-fires along the middle of
the road. Balls of candle-wick, soaked with turpentine were
lighted and thrown among the people indiscriminately. By
midnight Auburn Street was a burning fiery furnace.”*
Cockfighting was an early sport in Goulburn. On
Easter Monday 1849, Duggan of the Argyle Inn provided
as
“an untiring caterer for the amusement of the public ”
some nnnsual contests, as e.g.:
“a main of cocks, game every inch.... pitted for the sport of
the ‘fancy’.... a hurdle race by a tame bandicoot, now in train-
ing against a tortoiseshell tom cat of a Chinese breed.... a foot
race between Mr. Webster’s native companion and a well-known
schneiderkin of this town....”t
MacAlister, writing in the “Penny Post,” described the
first race meeting in Goulburn in 1838. The course was at
the old township. The winning post, which was also the
starting post, was opposite where the Hotel Gordon now
stands. The chief event was won by Matt Healy’s “Paddy-
Two-Sticks,” hard pressed by Lieut. Waddy’s “Little John.”
It was a two-mile race. The first prize was £lO. There
is a further account in his “Old Pioneering Days,” where
he gave the third horse as “Brewer” White’s (Boorowa)
“Mystery.” The next meeting was in 1842 at “Hurst-
ville,” on the east side of Gallows Hill (the old showground
site). The winner of the big money was Capt. Christie’s
“Grenadier,” ridden by Jimmy Murray. The great horse
“Jarrocks” ridden by Higgerson, appeared on the old
Garoorigang track in 1850. MacAlister mentioned too the
bullock races, the first in 1842 and the last in 1850. Dean
Sowerby, Fr. Walsh and the Rev. Wm. Hamilton all used
to attend the races in those days.J

In the forties John J. (Ginger) Roberts’ horses were
competing in Sydney. In 1848 he says Hurley’s horse
“Tommy Tittle” “got away with good money.” Henry
Badgery had two good horses “Waitawhile” and “Lady
Morgan.” Captain Edenborough (Wollorogang) had a
good performer, “Artful Dodger.” A Boorowa horse
called “Jimalong Joe” ridden by a black-fellow won two
races. The most curious fact he records is that the water-
cart horse “Bawley,” belonging to Wm. Simons, won two
hack races at that meeting. “Bawley” was actually used in
the water cart on the morning of his win. This meeting
finished in a free fight and the side of the publican’s booth
was carried away in the conflict. The Argyle races of 1840
finished up with a duel between Lieutenant Christie of the
Mounted Police and one Pack, formerly a lieutenant in an
English regiment. The duel was fought on “Barber’s
Plains.” Pack grazed the collar of Christie’s jacket.
Christie missed twice. The seconds terminated the en-
counter. Another racing dispute between Christie and
Besnard was to have culminated in a duel but that the P.M.
heard of it and compelled them to find sureties to keep the
Queen’s peace.*
There were other peculiar circumstances about those
races of 1840. The “Sydney Morning Herald” and the
‘ ‘ Australian ’ ’ reported them in full. The ‘ 1 Monitor ’ ’ denied
that there were any races at all. “There was,” it said, “a
sort of private race between Doctor Eeedy, Mr. Besnard and
Surveyor Larmer.” The “Australian” calls them “Brilliant
Hurdle Races.” “Wm. Bradley was umpire, Capt. Hovell
the judge and Solomon Moses the clerk of the course. ’ ’ Dr.
Gibson, Capt. Stewart, Francis Macarthur, Shelley, Stuckey,
Styles and Campbell were present. GWynne’s “Squire”
was first, followed by Lieut. Waddy’s “Doctor,” H.
Gwynne’s “Bennelong,” W. P. Faithfull’s “Daylight,” and
Dr. Reedy’s “Sir Maurice.” A fortnight later another
meeting was held, the course was 2| miles long with six
hurdles. Horses mentioned as at the Goulburn races of 1842
were Riley’s “Scourge,” Reid’s “Chancellor,” and Brodie’s
‘ ‘ Tam-o ’-shanter. ”f

Coming down to the fifties, John Horton wrote:
“The principal racecourse was on the left hand side of the
(Braidwood) road, somewhere about where Mr. Belcher’s resi-
dence is now. There were good races held there, some of the
best horses in the country attending. Good prizes were pro-
vided. Admission to the course was free, and in addition Jack
Holland amused both young and old with his Punch and Judy
show without charge.”*
In 1863 there was a three days’ meeting in Goulburn,
when the prize money ran to £5OO. Again MacAlister gives
the names of all the horses. Miss Dixon’s “Zenobia” and
“Kildare” were there. He adds (writing in 1907) :
“Old southern sportsmen will remember the story of the paint-
ing of Miss Dixon’s horses “Kildare” and “Zenobia.” These
two racers won several light weights under assumed names
before the fraud was discovered and atoned for. The “painter
(Tom C.. .n) did twelve months in Berrima gaol as a result of
of his artistic skill.”
Other horses he mentions were P. and John MacAlister’s
“Despatch” and “Mavonrneen,” Davoren’s “Dan O’Con-
nell,” Thorn’s “Sly Boots,” W. F. Gibson’s “Jim Crow”
and Simon’s famous miler “Charley Pork.” A. G. Finlay
subsequently owned “Despatch.” Of the races of 1875
he wrote:
“On the old Goulburn racecourse, Blackshaw’s paddock, in 1875,
the late Mr. W. Jobson, the well-known dealer, as the outcome
of a wager at level money, (viz. £5O a side) between Mr. Jobson
and the late Mr. Sam Ferguson, undertook to ride 80 miles
in 10 hours; Jobson’s riding weight without the saddle being
16 stone. Mr. Jobson won comfortably, doing the 80 “laps”
in the 10 hours. A cattle dog, I remember, trotted after the
rider for a long part of the journey.”!
John Slocombe, the butcher, once rode from Burrawang
station on the Lachlan to beyond Dubbo, on the Macquarie,
110 miles, on a grass-fed stock horse, from 7 in the morning
until 8 at night. Wm. Simons rode the famous racehorse
“Charley Pork” from Goulburn to Parramatta in the day,
over 100 miles. MacAlister mentions the meetings of 1875
and 1876 and the close finishes between Miller’s “Uabba”
and Hetherington’s “Crazy Jane” for the big handicap
(£150) over the old course in Blackshaw’s paddock. Other
horses were “Panic,” Fred Gibson’s “Marathon,” Captain
Rossi’s “Saladin” and “Lord Burleigh” and Ranken’s
‘ ‘ Prodigal, ’ ’

“which like Hillas’ 'Mulison,’ Hannaberry’s 'Barebones’ and
the great 'Dagworth’ was originally a stock horse.* ’*
Hannaberry’s “Barebones” had an interesting history.
Hannaberry obtained him by exchange from a bushranger.
The horse was unkempt and half-starved giving no indica-
tion of his subsequent value. He won 13 out of 14 handi-
caps in N.S.W., and was then raced in Sydney. He failed
there but subsequently raced and won repeatedly in Queens-
land.! A few years later, MacAlister says, came Ivory’s
“Sweetmeat,” Boyds’ “The Prior,” and Tom MacAlister’s
“Thackambau,” the latter winning the double at the meet-
ing of 1888. The late Jonathan Williams mentions
' ' Thackambau ’ ’ only he spells it differently:
“Adjacent to the lane near the skating rink was a racing stable
conducted by Tom MacAlister, who trained among others, the
famous 'Thakombau’ which ridden by Tommy Sheahan, won
numerous races throughout the South and in Sydney.”!
“G. McA.” (George McAlister) published in 1911 a
long poem, extending over one and a half columns of the
newspaper. Its title was “Dear Old Goulburn Town.”
One verse recalling the races of the forties and fifties is of
interest:
“Our fathers then—brave optimists—upheld the sport of kings,
And Goulburn had three meets a year, Summer’s, May’s and
Spring’s, , ,
When bushmen bold in legions came, and many a famous horse
O’ertook his fated 'Waterloo’ on Blackshaw’s ancient course,
When Higgerson was riding there, and Nicholson and Snell
And Davoren’s 'Dan O’Connell’ beat 'Whalebone’ and 'Barbelle,’
When Miller’s famed 'Uabba’ was always in the van,
And 'Johnny Smoker’ galloped, and 'Stumpy’—also ran;
When 'Bawley’ just a carthorse, and never trained a day,
Led 'Charley Pork’ and 'Hollyhawk’ in 'Skurries’ all the way;
And 'Prodigal’ and 'Barebones,’ and Rossi’s noted strain,
And 'Thackambau’ and 'Sweetmeat’ too, and speedy 'Crazy Jane.’ ”$
P. Maguire wrote some reminiscences “Goulburn in the
Sixties” which were published in the “Cootamundra
Herald” and the “Goulburn Evening Penny Post.” This
was in 1916. They were mostly sporting memories and
covered much the same ground as MacAlister ’s.|| Another
interesting account of old Goulburn racehorses and trainers
was written by Arthur Remmington of Yass in 1923.**

In the eighties, racing attached itself to certain hotels,
as e.g. at Confoy’s Kenmore Hotel where races were held on
the 26/1/1883; at D. O’Brien’s “Shamrock” at Laggan
where a registered meeting was held on the 17/3/1884; at
Denis Carroll’s “Travellers’ Rest Inn,” Run of Water, in
1873; at the “Retreat Inn’ at Mnmmell on Easter Monday,
1878; and at the “Golden Fleece” on the Tarago Road in
the seventies.*
The Southern Jockey Club was holding its race meetings
on part of Gundary in 1873. Henry Pay ten was its secretary.
Racing in the eighties was at a low ebb. A leading article
in the “Southern Argus” narrated the waning of public
interest and the apathy and the indifference of the public.
The “Goulburn Jockey Club” was formed on the 27/10/1876,
its president was J. W. Chisholm. At the same time the
“Spring Races Committee,” with Henry Payten as honorary
secretary, was in being. The initial meeting of the
“Southern Racing Club” was advertised at the Royal Hotel
for the 18/9/1878. Henry Payten was secretary of this
club too. A new club or a reorganisation of the Jockey
Club was launched in 1881. When the “Goulburn Turf
Club” was formed is not clear but it fell on evil times in
1890. The press reported :
“Mr. H. Chisholm, after three years’ trial, pronounces it a
hopeless task to make races successful in Goulburn.”
In a later issue the “Penny Post” suggested that the
“Dead March in Saul” would be the correct tune to play
at its meetings. In 1894 the Goulburn Turf Club disposed
of its racecourse at Gundary. When first offered it was
passed in at £975. An attempt was made in 1892 “to revive
the fallen fortunes of the Turf in Goulburn.” The “Goul-
burn Racing Club” was formed in 1897. R. E. Zouch was
the secretary. It was in difficulties again in 1898, The
Goulburn Racing Club in 1904 arranged to lease the Olympic
ground and to raise funds for putting it in order as a race-
course by means of a debenture issue. The Licensed Victual-
lers’ Race Club was advertising meetings in 1910/11.f In
trouble again, the Goulburn Race Club sold its racecourse
on the 16/10/1928 for £4OOO with an option of repurchase
at £SOOO and on condition that races were conducted six days

each year at a maximum rental of £3O per day. Another
Club, organised two or three years later, was equally un-
successful and it also expired. Credit balances, amounting
to about £297, remained in the banks, but with no method
or machinery by which they could be disbursed.* The
Tirranna picnic races were held from about 1851. The 25th
races, held in 1876, were reported as follows:
“The attendance, more especially of the gentry in and around
Goulburn and Tirranna, was exceedingly large; for such a dis-
play of omnibuses, carriages, buggies, etc., we have never seen
on any Goulburn racecourse, and scarcely ever in our limited
experience. ”
The report went on to say:
“It is not usual for the press to notice any matters of a private
character, which these races are to some extent; but considering
... that the general public feel a deep interest in the result...
Moreover they are not altogether private, as the public are
allowed to attend and witness the running within prescribed
limits.”
J. W. Chisholm was president that year. F. R. L.
Rossi’s “Saladin,” W. S. Royd’s “Viceroy,” S. M. Morton’s
“Kelso,” W. S. Royd’s “Robin Hood,” and J. T. C. Ran-
ken’s “Pilgrim” were winners of the various races.f G. W.
Lambert, A.R.A., painted a famous picture of “Tirranna
Races.” It is now in the possession of Russell Grimwade
of Melbourne. It was reproduced in the ‘ ‘ Sydney Morning
Herald’s” “Century of Journalism.
The Pony and Galloway Club was holding meetings in
1897. The Goulburn Driving Club had a membership of
60 in the nineties. Bishop and Mrs. Chalmers, Canon and
Mrs. Pritchard were members. A. E. Sendall was its sec-
retary. The Argyle Polo Club was operating in 1892. A. C.
Gibson and F. J. Curtis were its executive officers. It
advertised that any “Geese, pigs or goats” trespassing on
its barley crop would be shot. This notice was addressed
to “Eastgrove Residents.”§ Goulburn has enjoyed trotting
for a little over 20 years. During that period various clubs
have operated and controlled the sport, viz., the Goulburn
Trotting Club, the Charity Trotting Club, Tattersall’s Trot-
ting Club and the Racing and Trotting Club. Gordon Mill-
som, for the third of these, Tattersall’s, organised the first

trotting Derby in Australia for a stake of £SOO. Later
Millsom organised a Sapling Stakes for two year olds for
£250. The present Goulburn Trotting Club claims that
owing to its activities interstate buyers come to Goulburn
looking for good horses.*
The Parliamentary Select Committee on Trotting sat
for two days in Goulburn, most of the evidence advanced
was in favour of night trotting with betting.
Cricket matches are said to have been played in Goul-
burn as early as 1839. In 1845 there was a cricket match
between Goulburn and Yass “at £2 per bat.” It was
”played on Goulburn Plains” and there was “great anxiety
on both sides as to the result”. . .“had it not been for the
superior play of Mr. George Whitehead, Goulburn would
have won easily.” The match was followed by an excellent
dinner at Alexander Long’s,”!
Anniversary Day in 1845 was observed with a cricket
match Massingham’s Nine versus Plowright’s Nine. Mass-
ingham’s nine made 43 and 30 in two innings. Plowright’s
nine made 85 in one innings. The players then adjourned
to the Salutation Inn for dinner where the Goulburn Cricket
Club was formed with 26 members. There was a long list
of toasts “and Sol looked in upon the breaking up of the
party.” The chairman was C. Cook.J
In 1856 the following advertisement appeared:
“Gentlemen willing to form a Cricket Club will meet at Mr.
Gilland’s ‘Horse and Jockey’ Inn.”§
In May 1869, the first “through” passenger train which
arrived in Goulburn from Sydney brought the “Warwick
Club” cricket team. The visitors defeated the Goulburn
First Eleven. “G. McA.” wrote an article entitled “Goul-
burn Cricket, Past and Present” on the 16/12/1901. He
covered apparently from the forties to the seventies. He
mentioned amongst the pioneers of cricket in Goulburn N.
and L. Mandelson, Chas. Gillespie, Senr. Captain H. Black-
shaw, Billy and Jas. Simons, Wm. Poidevin, J. Styles, H.
Goodhew, Geo. and Tom Richards, Dick Davis, Wm. Maher

these, Chas. Gillespie was the dux. Matches were played
on the Market Square, in Captain Hovell’s and Dean Sower-
by’s paddocks. Home made bats from the Mulwaree willow
were sometimes used. Players frequently discarded boots
and played in their bare feet. In a match against Quean-
beyan Gillespie made 63, more than the total score of the
opposing side. Geo. Richards .(the “Boomerang”) was the
crack (underarm) bowler of the Old Town team. “Over-
arm” or “roundarm” bowing came in the sixties. The
Goulburn team experienced it at Mittagong in 1867 for the
first time and was badly vanquished in consequence. The
match was against Southey’s schoolboys. S. H. Belcher,
senr., was an ideal umpire. He had been a member of the
Gloucestershire county team. He played in the N.S.W.
Eleven which defeated Victoria in December 1866, in one
innings. The wickets in those days were primitive chipped
pitches. Centuries were very rare. Later in the seventies
the “Golden Boot” and “Red Boot” clubs were much in
evidence. Many important matches were played at Gar-
roorigang. In a match against Yass, F. Longley hit five
balls of an over for four each and was bowled by the last
ball. The first ladies’ match was played on the Olympic
ground in the eighties. At this time the Oriental Club was
one of the best all-round combinations. In a later article
the author told the story of the various English Elevens
which visited Goulburn.*
On the 13/10/1870 the Southern Cricket Club applied
for permission to use the lower half of Belmore Square and
permission was granted. On the 18th and 19th December,
1876, a match was played at Goulburn between James Lilly-
white’s English XI and 22 of the town and district. The
Englishmen made 125, Goulburn 60 and 51. The Goulburn
22 were:
“Belcher, H. M. Faithfull, Banks, E. Gillespie, Throsby, W.
Poidevin, Lord, H. Payten, Rush, Brodie, Poplin, Armstrong,
Donaldson, Hall, Fletcher, Roberts, Goughian, Oddy, Simpson,
Fitzgerald, F. Shepherd and H. Gannon. ”t
In 1881 the “Brittannia Cricket Club” appears two or
three times in the Municipal Council’s minutes. On one
occasion it borrowed the council’s roller. A second cricket

club was formed in 1874. It was called the “National.”
In 1876 the “Goulburn,” the “Caxton,” and the “Golden
Boot” were functioning. The Goulburn Club had a cricket
ground at Garroorigang from 1878 to 1884. The “Oriental”
club applied for the use of the municipal council’s roller in
1884. It was refused but subsequently granted “for one
day.” A cricket match “All England v Goulburn” was
played on the 26th and 27th November, 1886. Special
trains were run to Goulburn for the occasion. On the 24th
and 25th February 1889, a Goulburn 18 very nearly de-
feated an English XI. The Englishmen only made 37 in
the first innings. The match resulted in a draw. The
“Carthona” and “Clifton” clubs are mentioned in 1889,
the “Pioneer” in 1890. An “attempt to revive cricket”
in 1890, took the form of a meeting on the 5/9/1890. It
was attended by four of the half dozen clubs then existing.
A Cricket Union was formed as a result with N. Donoghue
as secretary. It got to work quickly and advertisements
appeared of No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 teams. Lord Sheffield’s
Eleven visited Goulburn on the 18th and 19th December,
1891. Dr. W. G. Grace was amongst the players. Goulburn
played a team of 22.*
After the cricket match against Lord Sheffield’s English
XI, John O’Brien, landlord of the Bridge Hotel, and the
booth holder at the match, inserted an advertisement to the
effect that he had not been paid for the beer consumed, t In
its first innings Goulburn made 57, in the second 114. The
Englishmen declared in their first innings at 187.
The “Phoenix Cricket Club” is mentioned in 1892. E.
B. Tompson, solicitor, of Wagga and brother-in-law of A.
M. Betts, in whose office he served his articles, was one of
the best bowlers of the Goulburn Cricket Club, in its early
days. He died in 1891. Elijah Weatherby, at 78, con-
tributed in 1938, some cricket reminiscences to the “Penny
Post.” He first played with the “Sons of Temperance”
team, then captained by Wm. Pursehouse. Later he joined
the “Orientals” captained by Henry Pursehouse. There
was a concrete wicket at Eastgrove in those days and a grass

wicket at Garroorigang. He remembered W. G. Grace’s,
Gilligan’s, Ivor Bligh’s and Chapman’s English teams visit-
ing Goulburn.* An English XI (McLaren’s) visited Goulburn
on the 19th and 20th December 1901. The match was much
criticised, the visitors indulging in “under-arm” lobs. The
gates and rights were sold for £l9O. The Englishmen re-
ceived £IOO and the local association made a profit of £26. f
The “Civil Service,” “ Half -Holiday, ” “Clifton,” “Bel-
more,” “Austral,” “Waratah,” and “Kenmore,” cricket
clubs were all operating in 1895. A few years later the
“Northward” and the “Southward” and “Federal” cricket
clubs appear. The “Ambulance Club” was functioning
then. A Fijian team played a two days’ match here in
1908. The game ended in a draw with Goulburn 134 runs
behind and four wickets to fall. A cricket match was
played on the Showground in 1911 between the Tickner
and Jeffrey families. Every member of each team was
related. The Tickners won by 160 runs. The Cricket
Association in 1910 contributed £25 towards the turf wicket
in Victoria Park. The municipal council and staff played
the Mulwaree council and staff on the new turf wicket on
the 19/12/1914. The Goulburn and District Cricket Assoc-
iation was formed in 1900, the first president being W. S.
Arnott, P.M., the secretary H. Phillips of the Lands Office.
About eight teams contested its first grade competition and
twelve the second grade, t
An English Ladies’ XI visited Goulburn on the 11th
January 1935. There are only casual references to athletics
in Goulburn before MacAlister who mentions the runners
of the seventies: “Scone” Watson, “Jack” Applitt, Frank
Hewitt, Charlie Baxter and “Bob” Ferguson, and gives some
results, as e.g., on the 26/12/1872 Baxter beat Ferguson at
Goulburn over 150 yards for £25 a side, time 15 seconds. On
the 26/12/1872 Baxter running in the Sydney Cup, won the
150 yards in 15 seconds, the 440 yards in seconds, and
after falling in the 300 yards, finished second. §
The Highland Society was formed in 1888. The “Penny
Post” hailed it with some ribald verse:

“Scots! wha ha’e wi’ Allan fed;
Scots! Wham Tait has often led,
Mind what a’ the chiels ha’ said
of the Society.”*
Its first gathering was on the 26/1/1889. The first
president was A. G. Finlay, the treasurer A. D. Ness, the
secretary John McDonald. W. H. Maynard recalls how
the annual sports were held on Anniversary Day each year
in the old showground. There was wrestling in various
styles. Maynard competed in the high jump from 1889.
He won it from 1889 to 1893. Sergeant Chas. McHardy
on the 6/6/1885, threw the 14 lbs. hammer 130 feet 6 inches.
Previously, on the 17/3/1885 he put the 56 lb. weight 32 feet
10 inches. At the Highland Society sports on the 27th
January 1890, he put a 14 lb. shot 63 feet 11 inches.!
A cryptic paragraph in the Goulburn “Herald' ’ de-
scribes some athletic sports at the Olympic Ground, on New
Year’s Day, 1894. Interest was killed by “stiff” running
which, the paper said, “was so discreditable that we decline
to furnish any details concerning the day’s proceedings.”!
At the old showground on the 22/8/1911 Miss A. Moore won
the 100 yards ladies’ championship of N.S.W. from Mrs. F.
Drennan in 13 3/5 seconds. The “Penny Post” recorded
that “the appearance of the two competitors in their run-
ning costumes excited interest amongst the spectators. ”§
The Goulburn Athletic Club was “newly-formed” in
1907. A. James, M.L.A., was its first president. Its
initial membership was 50. Of boxing in the forties Chas.
MacAlister says:
Long’s ‘Caledonian,’ kept later by Owen Boyle and James
Summergreen, was a great resort of the sporting men of those
days. In the long room at the ‘Caledonian,’ which did duty
as a boxing hall, the redoubtable Black Parry, the Haddigaddis,
Dave White and Jim Donnelly, erstwhile light-weight champion
of New South Wales, were amongst the men who ‘put the gloves
on’...whilst the O’Donnells (John, Terry and Ben) were noted
wrestlers. ” J|i
George Huff, for some years associated with the Prize
Ring of N.S.W. settled in Goulburn, and in 1849 gave an
exhibition at “Mr. Alexander Long’s, Large Room, Cale-
donian Inn,” on the 26/12/1849.**

Jonathan Williams, before leaving Goulbnrn for the
South African War, won the amateur lightweight champion-
ship of the Goulbnrn District. Before enlisting he had
some successful fights in Melbourne as a professional. At
the close of the South African war he gained the light welter-
weight championship of the British Army, defeating Harry
Cooper of the Dublin Fusiliers after 13 rounds. * MacAlister
mentions a contest between “Jack” Hayes and “Professor”
Nolan, both good second-rate heavyweights for £5O a side.
The following advertisement appears in 1856:
“Challenge! The undersigned is open to fight any man of 61
years on the Middle Creek. From £lOO/500. His money is
ready without bounce or gammon. James Marshall.”!
There were a number of regattas organised by the Lake
Bathurst Rowing Club in the eighties. Advertisements of
these with a quaint woodcut of a railway train appeared
at frequent intervals in the local press. Stansbury won the
£lOO handicap at the regatta of 1887. In 1866 the boys
of the Grammar School, under the guidance of one of the
masters, Hicks, and largely financed by the headmaster,
S. H. Belcher, built a boat and launched it on the Wollon-
dilly. The Wollondilly at that time at North Goulbnrn
was a stretch of water two miles long. The boat was 25
feet in length, with a beam of 4 feet 2 inches and a draught
of 1 foot 11 inches. It was built of half-inch cedar. Gaily
decorated with the school colours and the Union Jack the
“Daphne” was taken through Auburn Street and the Market
Square to Sloane Street on one of Conolly’s waggons. The
headmaster performed the christening, “Swift as an arrow,
strong as a lion and buoyant as a duck,” were the words
he used. The boat carried 16 boys on her maiden voyage.
This was on the 12/5/1866. Another boat was used on
Thorn’s waterhole.§
A “Goulbnrn Regatta” and “a Sailing Championship
of Goulbnrn” were advertised to take place on the 16th
April, 1892. The course was at Brisbane Grove. Arthur
Hunt and A. Harrison journeyed by canoe from the Murrum-
bidgee near Canberra to Encounter Bay in South Australia.
The journey, which occupied five and a half months, was
begun in May 1939.||

Swimming has always been a popular sport in Goulburn.
McFadden was given “great praise” in the Goulburn
“Herald” for “erecting baths on the Wollondilly below his
residence near St. Nicholas’ Church.” Dressing boxes and
spring-boards had been erected. “All that is wanted now
is a seat in each box.” When the first swimming club was
founded is not now clear. The “old” club was revived
in 1894. The “Juvenile Enterprise Swimming Club” was
also functioning in 1894/5. The “Goulburn Swimming
Club” was formed in 1896. The president was Alf Mit-
chell. A life saving society was functioning in 1902 A
Pedestrianism was very popular years ago. John Hill
and Patrick Byrne contested in Goulburn, 100 yards for
a stake of £SO in April 1854. Byrne won by five inches.
In a return match the next day Hill was the winner.!
Twenty-five years later W. Edwards walked 120 miles in
26 hours at the Mechanics’ Institute on the 22/8/1879. The
hall was small, necessitating 36 laps to the mile.ij:
A peculiar announcement was:
“Pedestrianism. A telegram has been received in town that
Madame Azella, winner of the late ladies’ walking-match in
Sydney, purposes walking in the Goulburn Mechanics’ Hall on
Friday and Saturday next.”
Her advertisement read:
“Mechanics’ Institute, Goulburn. Tremendous Excitement.

A walking match of 24 hours for £2O a side between
H. Forster of Goulburn and H. Woods of Victoria, took
place in the Mechanics* Institute beginning at 8.30 p.m. on
Friday, 6th February 1880, and ending at 8.30 p.m. on the
Saturday. At the finish Woods had completed 82 miles,
being 7 miles ahead of Forster, who “ walked lame and ap-
peared to be very much out of sorts, ’ ’ having only completed
75 miles. §
One of the first aeroplanes to alight at Goulburn was
that of David Jones Ltd., in 1920. It left Sydney at 1.25
p.m. and landed here at 3.45 p.m., carrying one of the first

mail orders ever delivered by ’plane in Australia.* At an
informal gathering of citizens in 1927 convened by Dr.
Burton Bradley and F. S. Walpole, an interim Aero Com-
mittee was elected to further the idea of a Goulburn Aero
Club. The Club came into being on the 15/6/1927 when
the Aerial tour of the N.S.W. Club landed on the racecourse.
That night F. Scholz the president of the newly-formed
Goulburn Club announced his gift to the Club of a de
Haviland plane. The Club itself purchased a Gypsy Moth
in 1928. Bert Hinkler, after his flight from England to
Australia, accompanied by Mrs. Hinkler flew to Goulburn
on the 22/5/1928. They were welcomed by the Mayor
and citizens and entertained by the Chamber of Commerce
and other bodies.
From 1928/1931 the Goulburn Aero Club was in being,
largely due to the enthusiasm of its president F. W. Scholz.
It established the aerodrome in 1928, borrowing the muni-
cipal plant for the purpose. A number of pilots was trained
here, Captain Chas. Matheson was the Club Instructor. It
held an aerial pageant in 1931. Proceeds were for the
hospital, ambulance and its own funds. The Club ceased
operations soon afterwards when aviation in Goulburn
passed from the realm of sport to that of transport.!
A bowling alley was conducted by Collins near the
Imperial Hotel about 1855. It was a favourite Sunday
amusement.
It was in 1878 that the steps were first taken to form
a bowling club. One of the first bowling greens was that
at the Pelican Inn, Tirranna. Another was at Fenwick’s
“Koyal Oak” Sooley Creek. In the eighties and nineties
a number of bowling and skittle alleys were licensed in town.
In 1898 a deputation waited upon the council to ask for a
portion of Belmore Square for a bowling green. Later
160 feet of the “Auburn Street frontage of the South Goul-
burn Keserve” was granted. However the government
stepped in and secured the site for a drill hall. In 1906
W. A. Gardiner and Alex Ness endeavoured to form a bowl-
ing club in Goulburn but without success. A year later
F. P. Kelly and Chas. Eveston were more successful and
disposed of £4OO worth of debentures in a few days, The

site for the club in Auburn Street was obtained from F. P.
Kelly and the green was opened by the Mayor, H. Beegling,
on the 10/10/1907. Norman Hay was the first secretary
and Chas. Gardner the first treasurer. Presidents have
included W. H. Bladwell, W. R. Costley, A. J. Bryson and
E. W. Johnson. G. T. Steadman was treasurer for 25 years.
The Club is affiliated with the Federal Bowling Association.
Its first book of rules is dated 1/7/1907. #
A meeting to form a bicycle club was held in 1889.
The advertisement was illustrated with a “penny-farthing”
bicycle. Cycling took Goulburn by storm in the nineties,
years which marked the boom days of professional racing.
Goulburn professionals of the time included Ewan Turner,
Alan Turner, Tommy Larcombe and Ollie Brook. Brook won
the Dunlop road race from Goulburn to Sydney in 1904, and
the 50 miles road championship of N.S.W. The Goulburn
branch of the League of Wheelmen was formed in 1893. It
had 20 members at its annual meeting on the 8/1/1895.
In 1901 it organised a large carnival of which features
were cycling, horse-jumping, a fancy dress football match
and a concert. The cycling was disappointing. “Visiting
riders were found most difficult to deal with. ’ ’ Some races
were “ordered to be re-run.” There was a Goulburn
Bicycle Club functioning too all about this time. When
it was formed is not now clear. From 1901 to 1906 it held
no big meeting. It resumed in 1907 with an attractive
programme. It was functioning in 1904 although it was
then under suspension by the League of N.S.W. Wheelmen.
O. H. Brook, whose win in 1904 is mentioned above, and
others got over the difficulty by registering independently.
Harry Hayes won the first Goulburn to Sydney race. Little-
child won in 1902 but is said not to have used the same
machine throughout. R. H. Jeffries won in 1906. Ernest
A Fowler achieved the fastest time in this race.f
The Goulburn Amateur Bicycle Club was formed about
1906 when racing was conducted on the old showground.
During the war, 1914/1918, the club went into recess. The
municipal council formed the cycle track at the sports
ground in 1922. Electric light was installed at the track

in 1924 at a cost of £246/10/-, the Amateur Bicycle Club
contributing £24/10/- per annum for interest and deprecia-
tion, and 5/- per hour for light. Jack and Alan Seiffert,
Don McGregor and Duncan Gray have made the Goulburn
club famous. McGregor has held both State and Australian
titles, whilst Gray has won the Australian and most State
titles and established records in New Zealand, England and
in the Olympic Games and Empire Championships. In 1935
the Goulburn Amateur Bicycle Club sought sanction for
cycling carnivals on Sunday afternoons in Victoria Park.
The matter was referred to the ratepayers by referendum
when the proposal was defeated by 1398 votes to 1046. *
The first stirrings in the matter of a golf course for
Goulburn were in 1880. Then it was proposed to make
links in Clinton Street (Clinton Street west of the Austra-
lian Arms was all vacant paddocks). The municipal council
received a letter of protest from J. T. Gannon (solicitor) on
behalf of F. Horn, Mrs. Smith and W. A. Evans. One of
the earliest courses was at “Burrungurroolong” where E. W.
Kelso and C. M. Shaw made “an apology for a golf course’ ’
in the nineties. A “Goulburn Golf Club” was formed in
1898. The opening day was the 18/8/1898. There were
80 members. The “New” links were described as starting
“at the back of Mr. Helm’s residence, Auburn Street South,
and go over towards South Hill, the residence of Mr. W. Chis-
holm. They take a turn back towards Mr. Guymer’s cottage,
then into the corporation paddock and back to the starting point
past Dr. McKillop’s cottage, the distance being three miles.
There are 18 holes.
C. M. Shaw was its secretary.
There is some little discrepancy between local accounts
of the foundation of the Goulburn Golf Club. One account
has it that it was brought into being by A., H.C.L., and R. R.
Payten, who had previously played golf on their own pro-
perty. The other states that a meeting was held on the
22/6/1898 at the old Bank of Australasia, attended by A. B.
Chisholm, J. H. Turner, A. E. Sendall, P. M. Ibbs, R. E.
Conolly and C. M. Shaw. A third account states that the
club was formed in 1891/2. Oral arrangements were made
with tenants of paddocks extending towards South Hill, and
Bethune, a Sydney golfer, came here and laid out a course.
This course was only used for a few months.
* “E.P.P.,” 1924/1935; Mun. Mins. 1922/1924.


The club then moved to the present links, but only for
two years. It then went out towards Kenmore. Before
that, however, the first golf match was played on what are
now the present links on the 22/7/1899 against a Sydney
team arranged by R. A. Warden. One of the visitors was
Hugh MacNeil, a champion of Australia. The first club
house was a deserted hut standing about where the old first
green was. About 1900 the golf club moved out towards
Kenmore using Confoy’s hotel as the club house. After
three years it returned to the Eastgrove links where it has
been ever since. The second golf house was a cottage at
the south end of the links adjoining Eastgrove itself. At
this time the golf course was leased from the University of
Sydney. Later through the efforts of C. M. Shaw, R. E.
Conolly, the Payten Brothers, Alf Riley and others, the
present golf company was formed and the ground acquired.
At first a 9 hole course with sand greens; about 1925 the
club put in an 18 hole course and grass greens. The present
golf house has every convenience for members, a caretaker’s
residence and a ball room. It was opened on the 25/5/1912.
L. Kelly, Open Golf Champion, was given a civic reception
when he visited Goulburn in 1933. #
A Hockey Club was functioning in 1907. Hockey was
taken up seriously in Goulburn in 1909 when W. Harman,
a New Zealander, attached to the Kenmore Hospital, organ-
ised the sport for the recreation of the staff.
In the following season interest extended and the Goul-
burn team which included S. and W. Pritzler visited
Kenmore. That team called itself the “All Blacks” and
arrived on the field with their faces blackened and wearing
skull and cross-bones on their shirts. Some of the players
arrived in a home-made rickshaw which capsized before the
match, almost breaking the leg of one of the players. S.
and R. Smith who subsequently developed into fine players
took part in the first match. Rus Smith used to say he had
no choice as Major Foxall gave him the option of making
up his deficiency in military parades by either appearing
on the hockey field or being sent to a detention camp. The
“Ladies’ Mulwaree Hockey Club” was formed in 1908.f

Between 1910 and 1913 several clubs came into exist-
ence, as e.g. “G. Company’ ’ (Military), Criterions, Gladia-
tors, Wheelmen, Kenmore, Buffalo and Arcadians. The
Central Southern Association came into being in 1911 and
was responsible for sending a team to Sydney that year.
In 1914 the number of affiliated clubs had grown to 14.
George Tickner of Goulburn was the first country player
to gain interstate selection. This was also in 1914. Activities
were suspended from 1914 to 1923. In 1923 a New Zealand
team visited Goulburn and played a team of old players who
had footed the expense. In 1924 the Central Southern
Hockey Association was resuscitated. Peter Jackson was
its first president and Os. Grant its secretary. Many of the
old clubs reformed, new ones were founded and a Women’s
Association came into being. “Joy Club” established by
Dr. Moffitt annexed the 1924 premiership. Two Indian,
New Zealand and Queensland teams have all played here.
The C.S.H.A. has its own ground. Thirty-six of its players
have achieved interstate representation and 16 international
honours.*
Quoits appear to have been popular in the nineties.
Matches were advertised extensively, at the “Star” and
“Prince of Wales” and other hotels and even at wine par-
lours. Considerable prize and sweep money was laid out.f
Roller skating was introduced to Goulburn in 1866 when
one Spiller, gave an exhibition at the Mechanics’ Institute.
At the conclusion of the exhibition the audience was invited
to buckle on the skates and did so with a result that “baffles
description.” The falls were so numerous that the floor
shook under the concussion threatening to extinguish the
lights. Thereafter for some years skating was indulged
in at the Mechanics’ Institute and the Oddfellows’ Hall.
The Mechanics’ Institute itself advertised a meeting to form
a skating club. The meeting fell through. Later the
Mechanics’ Institute skating rink was functioning. All
about this time W. J. Bartlett turned his warehouse in Sloane
Street into the “Elite Rink” and Chas. Rogers formed the
“Arcadian Rink.”J The Goulburn Skating Club was formed

in 1877. Thomas O’Brien and P. A. Kenane were its sec-
retaries. They leased “the old school house in Clifford
Street.” The Club was only short-lived. Roller skating
was extraordinarily popular in the eighties. Goulburn had
two rinks, the “Elite,” and the “Arcadia,” whilst skating
was engaged in elsewhere. The “Penny Post” burst into
verse on the subject:
“Tell me not, ye Goulburn croakers,
Skating’s but a senseless reel,
That we’ll all be stumped as brokers
With no brown to buy a meal.”
And so on for nine verses. #
W. Kingsell and J. J. Roberts competed on roller skates
on some three occasions in 1889, proceeds for the Goulburn
Hospital. The contests aroused much interest. The
“Penny Post” was distinctly personal in its versified com-
ment. It described Kingsell as “the Tinman” (he was a
plumber) and J. J. Roberts as “the blustering noisy Jay
Jay. ” It went on:
“How the Tinman strutted when he found he’d once more won:
Let us thank Joseph for a shilling’s worth of fun.”t
As time went on the public became completely satiated
and by the beginning of the present century roller skating
was a lost art in Goulburn. In more recent years it has
been revived and the former Arcadia Skating Rink re-
conditioned by Messrs. Turner.
Tennis was first played in Goulburn about 1877 at Gov-
ernment Cottage in Sloane Street where the Railway Courts
now are. In the early eighties the “Goulburn Lawn Tennis
Club” was in existence, its secretary J. C. Crakanthorp of
the Bank of N.S.W. Its courts were in Victoria Street on
the East side about five chains from Citizen Street, on two
of the allotments of the Victoria Park subdivision, then
owned by F. Deacon. Matches were played there against
Young in 1885, and a Sydney team, including C. Cropper
(then State Champion) about 1884. The Cropper family
lived in Goulburn. S. H. Belcher writes: “I often played
with Cropper on these courts. I have an idea that one of
the Sydney team was Barty Paterson. The Sydney team
was here at the time of the Tirranna races, I think.”

The “new grounds” of the Goulburn Tennis Club were
opened on the 23/9/1893. They were in Clifford Street and
were leased from the Hospital Committee. There were
three ashphalt courts and a pavilion. The South Goulburn
Lawn Tennis Club was in being in 1899 when the joint
honorary secretaries were R. C. Joplin and F. B. Tyrrell,
both bank officers.* Another of the early clubs was the
“Half Holiday Lawn Tennis Club” which was playing in
1894/5. Their courts, four in number, were on the Victoria
Park ground. W. J. Cheeseman was its secretary.
About 1900 the “Goulburn Tennis Club” was formed.
It had five courts situated near the District Hospital. A.
B. Chisholm was its patron, E. W. Kelso the president and
E. A. Betts, the secretary. The idea of “Country Week”
tennis was first mooted by E. A. Betts. A Goulburn team
won the first Country Teams Championship in 1910, the
team consisting of Frank Hay, Jack Lillis, C. Thoroughgood,
and N. McKenzie. The first Country Singles Championship
was won by Harry Gibbes in 1911. Other early Goulburn
clubs were “Waratah,” “St. Andrew’s,” “Cooeeana,” St.
Patrick,” and “Spring Valley.” A Tennis Association
was formed in 1921 with E. W. Kelso as president and Les
Walpole as secretary. .A large number of clubs affiliated
with it and competition play was arranged. Ladies’ teams
from Goulburn were successful in Country Week in 1925
and 1930.
In 1926 the Goulburn and District Lawn Tennis Assoc-
iation (a no liability company) was formed to acquire land
and lay out courts. Ten hard courts were laid down. W.
Harris was elected patron and E. A. Betts president. Two
competitions are arranged each year in which about 50
teams compete. Many fine exhibition matches have been
played on these courts, J. O. Anderson, V. McGrath, Jim
Willard, Les Baker, Jack Crawford, John Bromwich and
others have appeared here. About a dozen clubs have affil-
iated with the association. Goulburn has produced a num-
ber of first class players. A. Sieler won the Country Singles
Championship in 1920 and 1923. Mrs. Martin who won the
Ladies Singles in 1921 and the Queensland Championship
in 1921, toured New Zealand with the N.S.W. team in 1923.

She won the Country Singles Championship in 1924 and in
1925/6 became the outright winner of the cup. She was also
a member of the teams which won the Country Week Ladies ’
Teams’ Championships in 1928 and 1930. Henri Cochet,
J. 0. Anderson and the Willard Brothers, tennis stars, visited
Goulburn on the 9/12/1935 and played exhibition games on
the Goulburn Association’s courts. They were accorded a
civic reception.*
Brief mention only is possible of the following sports
and sporting bodies. A Coursing Club was established in
1876. Hares were settled on the Lansdowne Estate. The
course was at Gundary. The “initial meeting” of another
“Goulburn Coursing Club” was held on the 27th and 28th
of April 1900. E. T. Ball was its judge. Greyhound
Kacing with mechanical hares was established on the Show-
ground in 1934 and transferred to Victoria Park in 1940.
A Croquet Club was in being in 1915, Mesdames T. T.
Alkin and E. W. Kelso were its prime movers.
The Goulburn Motor Club made its appearance in 1913
and the Motor Cycle Club in 1922. The latter was dis-
banded in 1926 and a new Goulburn Motor Club formed.
The Bankers and Auctioneers’ Social Club is a sporting body
which for some years has held an annual football match
on the August Bank holiday, the proceeds of which are given
to the Goulburn Hospital.
Horace Lindrum, Australian snooker and billiards
champion, established a billiards break record in Goulburn
of 1349. This was in 1940, breaking his own record of five
years earlier of 1324. He made snooker breaks of 112, 118
and 121 in the same night, f
Football (Eugby Union) was played in the early seventies
against Yass on the site of the old Showground, before any
buildings were up that way. Then it was played in Vic-
toria Park Eecreation Ground, then in Brook’s paddock
(i.e. Eastgrove before its subdivision). It was also played
on the Deanery paddock, where the match against Queens-
land was played in 1884. In the early eighties Sydney

teams such as Balmain and Burwood came to Goulburn an-
nually. Brooke’s paddock was the scene of most contests,
inter-club, inter-school as well as with most outside teams. *
The “Goulburn Football Club” was formed in 1872 or
1873. Its “second annual meeting” was held on the
8/5/1874. Only two matches were played that season. A
second club, “the Southern Football Club” was formed in
1874. The “Pioneer” Football Club was operating in 1890,
the “Ironclad” in 1892, the “Warrigals,” “Pirates,” and
“Wallaroos” in the nineties. The “Ironclad” football Club
changed its name in 1893 to the “Belmore.” A branch
of the Southern Eugby Union was formed in 1893. The
Goulburn branch of the N.S.W. Rugby Union was function-
ing in 1894. f
Among the late Jonathan Williams’ outstanding sport-
ing achievements was his showing in the Rugby Union match
which Goulburn played against an English XV on the old
showground. Goulburn was defeated by about nine points
to three and its try was secured by a player named Kimpton
after good work by Williams. The Football Union in 1899
offered to contribute £ls towards the expenses of the enter-
tainment of the Governor provided the Municipal Council
arranged for the Governor to attend the match, Goulburn v
England on the 14/6/1899. The “Fusileer” Club is men-
tioned in 1900.
Regular competitive football began in Goulburn in 1892.
Prior to this, matches had been played here, St. Patrick’s
College having an excellent team in 1888, in which the star
player was Dr. Dwyer, later Bishop of Wagga. The records
show also that S. H. Belcher of Goulburn represented N.S.W.
in 1883 and 1884. The period from 1892 to 1896 saw com-
petitive football well organised, the prime mover in its
institution being Ned Pryke, one of a family of prominent
players. In 1899 Goulburn played Mullineaux’ English XV
on the old showground, the internationals winning by only
14 points to 3. About the year 1915 the new Rugby League
code found its way to Goulburn. Prior to that Rugby
Union was played. With the formation of the Goulburn
Rugby League the new code asserted itself and practically
all the players deserted the old game.

About 1928 the institution of cup football between the
towns led to the engagement of paid coaches from Sydney
clubs and later to the importation of paid players and for
a few years there was a boom in district games. Owing
to travelling difficulties it was found necessary to play on
Sundays, opposition to which made it difficult to secure
grounds controlled by the City Council. As a result in 1935
the League purchased ground from J. W. Craig and built
an oval on it. With the aid of increased gate money Rugby
League Park, as it was called, was gradually improved and
the committeemen by voluntary labour erected improve-
ments valued at over £IOOO including a substantial grand-
stand. In 1941 the ground was sold to the N.S.W. Rugby
League in order to release the local committee of the liability
which it entailed and the State body is at present improving
the park with the object of making it the finest country
ground in the State.
J. W. Seiffert, M.L.A., was elected secretary in 1930 and
still retains the position. #
Association Football was introduced into N.S.W. in 1880
and the “Goulburn Association Football Club” was playing
in 1899. When the “British Football Association” was
formed in Gfoulburn is not clear. It disbanded in 1914. f
Australian Rules Football was first played here in 1905. The
“Goulburn Australian National Football Association”
played for five seasons, 1932/1936. F. Panther was its
president for the first three years. It was wound up in 19364
A number of references have been made to the former
Victoria Park Recreation ground. This land at one time
was used for sports and games on holidays. It belonged
to H. Payten of the Royal Hotel. Another account states
it belonged to a syndicate of eight and was opened by a
sports meeting in 1871. It had pine trees all round and a
high fence, but it cannot have been a payable speculation.
It was “reopened” on the 10/11/1873 and again “reopened”
on the 9/11/1878.
It was situated in Citizen Street between Victoria Street
and George Street and extended half way down only towards

Kinghorne Street. It had a fair coating of grass which was
kept in good condition.
It was bought by D. J. McLeod and another party, cut
up into lots with Park Street dividing the new allotments.
The small cottage that was in the park and was the
caretaker’s residence is still in use. This caretaker’s resid-
ence was built by the Victorian Park Committee. It was
of hardwood “in the Elizabethan Style of Architecture,”
and was designed by Signor Stombuco and built by Pinn. #
Another sports ground was that owned by the Goulburn
Olympic Ground Company Ltd., which ground (later the
racecourse) was the main football and cricket ground in
the eighties. The cricket match with W. G. Grace’s team
was played here and the cup matches.
The company collapsed and its property was sold by
the mortgagees in 1891.f

A
CHAPTER XXV.
CEMETERIES.
good part of the history of Goulburn could be
written from the inscriptions on the tombstones of
its old cemeteries. Of these there are four, apart
from the cemeteries now in use. The oldest of these is the
St. Saviour’s (Anglican) Cemetery, lying right behind the
Reformatory. There is a difficulty in establishing the date
of its first use. The oldest headstone is to the memory of
John Weakley who died on the 14/7/1831. It was probably
in use before that, although it was not granted by the Crown
as a burial ground until the 9/5/1842 and 16/9/1848. The
difficulty lies in the fact that the burial registers of All
Saints’, Sutton Forest (prior to 1838), and of St. Saviour’s,
Goulburn (1838 onwards), do not specify the place of inter-
ment. Curiously enough, by some oversight, the cemetery
was not consecrated until June 1858, when Bishop Barker
(Sydney) performed the rite. This is all the more remark-
able in that nearly all of the church sites in Goulburn were
selected by Bishop Broughton twenty years before. One
volume of the registers, 1862 to 1867, is missing. Some of
the monuments reveal stories of early tragedies. In 1836
two brothers, Henry and James Wilson, came to Goulburn,
and in 1839 were engaged upon the building of old St. Sav-
iour’s Church. Just before its completion James fell from
the building and died of his injuries. Henry died in 1848.
Both are buried here. One of the oldest tombstones is
dated 1840. The inscription reads:
To the Memory of
John Fuller
Who was murdered at Golburn on January 28, 1840, aged 57
years.
Consider reader when you look
How soden this Soul was took
And see that thou prepared be
Lest Death should come so
Quick on thee.
There are, however, two discrepancies between this in-
scription and the register. The latter reads:
“John Fuller, Fish River, died 22nd January, buried 24th
January. Quality. Overseer. Wm. Sowerby.”
Fuller was the victim of Paddy Curran the bushranger.


The full particulars of such happenings are frequently
inscribed on the memorials. Examples are :
“Richard Bull (25/1/1864) from injuries received by coming
in contact with a tree whilst riding on horseback.”
“William Marks (19/3/1861) who was killed by a fall from
his horse.”
Another, with a spelling all its own:
“Julia, the beloved wife of Thomas Taylor, of Bunnaby, who
was accidentally drown near own house, October 13, 1856.”
The Rev. Chas. Marsden Betts, “assistant minister of
this district ” was drowned in the Wollondilly whilst return-
ing from pastoral visitation on the 28/7/1857, and is buried
here. Another assistant curate at the Cathedral was the
Rev. J. Grayson, who arrived in Goulburn on the 8/7/1872
from England and died at Bishopthorpe on the 30th. The
sum of £4O/9/- was raised by public subscription, of which
£l9/16/- was spent on the tombstone. The balance was ex-
pended some years later on a window to his memory in the
north transept of the Cathedral. Captain Hovell, the
explorer, who died on the 9/11/1875 at the age of 90 is
buried here. His tomb has been restored recently by pub-
lic subscription. Colonel Bull, who was born in 1806, and
received a commission in the Seaforth Highlanders in 1825,
and who came to Australia in 1842, died in Goulburn and was
buried here in 1901. There is a large vault of the Rossi
family. There is no inscription on it, but it seems certain
that Francis Nicholas Rossi (the elder) who died on the
26/11/1851 was the first occupant. He was a captain in the
3rd Ceylon Regiment and Principal Superintendent of Police
in New South Wales. Alexander Philip Rossi (7th Regi-
ment of Foot) who died on the 14/2/1855, was probably
buried here. F. N. Rossi’s wife was not. She died in
Mauritius in 1829. Nor is their son F. R. L. Rossi (the
Comte de Rossi) buried here. There is a monument to Wm.
Chauncey, Civil Engineer, erected in 1878 by the workmen
of the Roads Department.* Admiral John Gore, who died
on the 6/3/1853, aged 78, and Sarah his wife, who died,
aged 80, on the 7/4/1857, lie here. The Admiral, who was
a pioneer settler at Lake Bathurst, was the father of the
Lieut. John Gore who was lost in Sir John Franklin’s ex-
pedition. In this cemetery too rests an old lady who came

out in the First Fleet, f This was Mary Martin, who died
in the old township on the 9/6/1843, and was buried on the
12/6/1843 at the age of 78. Nicholas Charles Phillips, R.N.
(died 1863), was the first burial in the Phillips ’ vault. Wil-
liam Shelley (13/1/1844) and his wife Susannah (15/9/1890)
are buried here.
There is a monument to the memory of Mrs. Henry
O’Brien, of Douro, Yass, a benefactor of the Diocese and the
Cathedral, who died at Bishopthorpe in 1892, at the age of
89. There are vaults, enclosures and graves of many of
the oldest families on the Southern Tablelands as e.g., Betts,
Chisholm, Marsden, Phillips, Ranken, Shepherd, Zouch, etc.
Captain Henry Zouch, the soldier who was in charge of the
police at the Lambing Flat riots, is buried here. Other
names are redolent of the professional and commercial
history of the city, such as Cole, Conolly, Gale, Hunt, Jor-
dan, Lansdowne, Pinn, Riley, etc.
Just as the Georgian or old Colonial style of architecture
survived into the late fifties so the eighteenth century type
of lettering and epitaphs with its quaint use of capitals is
found well into the nineteenth century. On the monument
to George Holland who died at the age of 36 on the 7/8/1848
there is the following inscription:
This Stone was Erected by
Messrs Benjamin & Moses
of Goulburn as a Tribute of the
Worth of a Long & attached Servant.
Thomas Mackie was described as the “sextant,” c/o
the “Parsonage,” in 1857.* The cemetery was closed in 1937.
The first Presbyterian cemetery lies just off the main
Sydney Road, past the bridge over the Crookwell railway
line. Its oldest grave is that of Alexander Fraser, who died
on the 2/9/1839. The gravestone is remarkable in that the
name of the monumental mason, Jennings and Company is
carved prominently on it. This may have been added in
1850 when another interment took place. Samuel Eirth,
mentioned elsewhere in this history, who died on the
19/6/1860, is buried here, as is Robert Waugh “J. P. Sur-
geon” 9/5/1870, the Rev. Wm. Ross, who “laboured for
thirty years in this Colony, a faithful and successful Minister
of Christ’s Gospel,” who died on the 19/1/1869. Thos.

The Sinclair vault, although erected by James Sinclair, has
no inscription to his memory. It commemorates his wife,
Christina Douglas, died 27/9/1848, and his brother, Peter
Innes, died 26/9/1844. There are enclosures of the Craig,
Wilkie, Knowlman and other well known local families.
The old Roman Catholic cemetery adjoining was very
full when its use was discontinued. A monument to
Bridget Evans, who died 6/3/1847, has an unusual epitaph,
more especially in its use (and disuse) of capital letters:
“Go home dear friend and shed no tears
I must lie hear till christ appears
And When he comes I hope to have
A joyful rising from my grave.”
There are grave enclosures of and monuments to the de
Lauret, Dalglish, McAlister and McSbane families and all
the Roman Catholic pioneers.
There was a private cemetery at the South Goulburn
Convent. This was abolished in 1920 when nine remains
were exhumed and reinterred in the Roman Catholic ceme-
tery*
The old Methodist cemetery adjoining the Presbyterian
and Roman Catholic cemeteries was in use from an early
date, though not apparently so early as the others, probably
1849. f The epitaph on the stone of Thomas Barnes, died
4/11/1859, is somewhat pessimistic or at least doubting:
“We hope the change is for the best
He died in peace to join the blest.”
The Rev. Benjamin Hurst (died 5/1/1857) is buried
there. “For twenty years he preached the Gospel in con-
nection with the Wesleyan Church,” says his epitaph. C.
H. Walsh who died on the 5/11/1874, is buried there, as is
also Annie Elizabeth Walsh (“The Sailors’ Friend”) who
died on the 21/7/1902. A doleful epitaph is that to the
memory of Elizabeth Large, who died on the 2/8/1850:
“This once loved form now cold and dead
Each mournful thought employs,
And nature weeps her comfort fled
And withered all her joys.”

Colombo and reinterred here) and Elizabeth his wife (died
1877) are commemorated by a large monument.
The site of the Jewish cemetery to the south of the main
Sydney Road, beyond Governor’s Hill, was conveyed to
Trustees by Benjamin Moses for the purposes of a Jewish
Burying ground. The Trustees built the old cottage ad-
joining as a caretaker’s residence and mortuary chapel.
There are several graves with Hebrew and English inscrip-
tions.
At this time two hotel keepers and five storekeepers
with their partners and staff were Jews so that Goulburn
was known facetiously as “Little Jerusalem.For very
many years the cemetery has been totally neglected and the
cottage has been occupied by a series of unauthorised per-
sons who have never paid any rent. The Jewish community
in Sydney is now (1940) to restore the cemetery and protect
the graves.!
A special cemeteries committee of the municipal council
was elected in 1893 but with no definition in the minute book
of its functions. Later it was asked to report upon the
advisability of the council opening and managing a cemetery.
No action was taken. Long years of enquiry, controversy,
rival schemes, sites and negotiations preceded the dedication
by the Department of Lands in 1900 of the present general
cemetery on part of the Town Common.!
When the New General Cemetery was divided into de-
nominational portions in 1902 a section was set apart for
Congregationalists (who were not represented in Goulburn)
and none for Baptists (who were). The Baptists protested
successfully and the matter was rectified. § The Roman
Catholics transferred their section to the Anglicans. They
have their own cemetery at Kenmore. This contains a
Mortuary Chapel to the memory of Bishop Bairy,

CHAPTER XXVI.
PHYSICAL FEATURES, FAUNA AND FLORA.
N an earlier chapter “Groulburn of To-day” mention
was made of Goulburn’s climate. There are no ex-
tremes about it. It is not hot in summer, nor is it
abnormally cold in winter. The prevailing westerly winds,
are trying both in summer and winter: in summer they are
charged with dust and in winter when they blow off the
Crookwell snows. Nevertheless it is a temperate climate.
The average summer heat is 80 deg. and the nights are
always cool. The average rainfall over the past 40 years
is 25 inches.
One of the most authoritative statements of Goulburn’s
assets and potentialities is in the survey undertaken by the
Federal Capital Commission in 1899/1900. There Goulburn
and district is described as :
“a lightly timbered tract of open, undulating downs.”
The Government Astronomer gave the following tem-
peratures :
“Mean Spring temperature 57.6; the mean Summer 68.3; the
mean Autumn 57.1 and the mean winter 45.0; while the mean
maximum for the same period was 68.8 and the mean minimum
45.1.”*
Extremes, according to the Government Astronomer are
rare:
“The greatest recorded shade temperature is given as 108 deg.
on the 7/2/1894, and the lowest as 20 deg. on the 24/7/1892,
10/7/1895 and 30/7/1895.”
That same report recorded that for 29 years the mean
rainfall “works out at 25.76 inches.” A. J. Sach, resident
master of the Goulburn Technical School was quoted as de-
scribing the soil
“as having been formed from Silurian shale, weathered down
to clay, with extensive sandy areas (decomposed quartzites)
and from limestone.”
The soil of the district was said to be very favourable
“for wheat, oat, barley, rye and potato crops, also for all
English fruits.” The Commission was not impressed with
the possible water supply for a city of 70,000 people. How-
ever it agreed that Goulburn had the
* Page 48.


“capacity to support a considerable population. ”
And that its conditions were
“favourable to commercial and industrial development.”*
G. F. Naylor, M.A., M.Sc., Dip.Ed., wrote an authorita-
tive article on the geological history of the Goulburn district.
It appeared in the “Goulburn Evening Post” of the Ist
November, 1935.
In 1839 the southern districts suffered a severe drought.
The Wollondilly was dry from Goulburn to Paddy’s River.
After the drought came the deluge. The drought broke
at the end of 1843. Eastgrove, then known as the Goulburn
Flats, was a swirling sea of water. That same year a
meteor of remarkable appearance “somewhat larger than
an orange, shot over Goulburn.” In 1845 there was a great
storm which almost wrecked the Old Township. The hail
was said to have been to 9 inches in circumference and
2 inches in diameter.”! That hailstorm of January 1845
was attributed at the time to the influence of the comet
“Biclas.” At the Argyle Stores 190 panes of glass were
broken, at Bull and Woodward’s 327, at the Salutation Inn
150, at Long’s Inn 150, at Mandelson’s Inn 150, at the Mill
and Brewery 600, together with the east window of old St.
Saviour’s Church.! Of the 1852 flood the late John Horton
wrote:
“The residents in the houses on the other side of the Mulwaree
had to move to the top storey, as the water was very near the
upper windows. There were no boats in Goulburn at that
time. I can just recollect the flood. I saw people trying to
rescue the families in the houses.... the rescuers brought a big
meat vat or case from Sam Davis’ store and tried to get over.
They had a 56 lb. weight to balance the craft. After two or
three failures they succeeded in saving the people. The late
Rev. W. Ross took an active part, also Mr. Robert Craig
undertaker.... it is said he brought a coffin and tried to get
over but failed; but I cannot vouch for the truth of the story.
I saw the big case launched.”?
A hailstorm on the 4/2/1845 did much damage. The
Royal Hotel in particular had 150 panes of glass broken
“the architrave mouldings,” the “pediments” and “the
artificial sign-boards (those made of plaster of Paris) all
suffered much hurt. ”11

Eastgrove was entirely submerged and the water reached
halfway up Hawkins’ and Davies’ houses. A man called
Jarrol was drowned. Another big flood was in 1864. E. F.
Thomas has a silver salver given to his father, Charles
Thomas, mentioned several times elsewhere in this history,
for services rendered on this occasion. The inscription
reads:
“Presented by Public Subscription to Mr. Charles Thomas For
his courageous and praiseworthy services during the flood at
Goulburn on the 12th June, 1864.”
This was recalled in the obituary notice of Charles
Thomas in 1893, which read:
“During the great flood of 1864 the late Mr. Blackshaw’s
house was surrounded with water and the inmates were forced
to take refuge in the upper floors from which, through the
windows, they were making signals for the townspeople to rescue
them. A boat was observed coming down the Mulwaree from
“Garoorigang,” sculled through the raging waters by one man.
That man was the late Mr. Charles Thomas, who guided the
boat to Mr. Blackshaw’s and took a number of people through
the windows in the verandah r00f.... ”
Another account states that the water covered the old
Fitzroy Bridge (built in 1855). # The police records mention
that:
“Senior Sgt. Fenton and Constables Youngman and Walker
were employed from about 9 a.m. till 1 p.m. in assisting to
remove Mr. Blackshaw and others who were in danger, the
flood having risen to such a height that the houses were partially
covered as high as the verandah. No accident appears to have
occurred. ”
A fortnight later Constable Youngman was employed
in collecting the rails and posts washed away by the floods
and stacked them at the Court House, f
On the 9/9/1869 “the most severe snow storm ever
known in the colony” was experienced in Goulburn. A
picture was published of the “Scotch Church” in the
snow.t Another huge flood occurred on the 17/4/1870. On
this occasion the water rose nine inches above the floor of the
Fitzroy Bridge. The theory has been advanced that the
building of the Cooma railway line diverted the storm water
channels and for this reason the floods in recent years,
severe as they have been, were not comparable with those
just described. Eastgrove has, however, been frequently

flooded and upon occasions the waters have reached to the
railway fence near the gas works.
A hailstorm on the 8/11/1879 killed 115 sheep and made
holes in galvanized iron roofs. A long detailed account
of the floods of 1852, 1860, 1864, 1867, 1870 and 1891
appeared in the “Goulburn Herald” of the 29/6/1891.
There was another big flood on the 5/7/1900. Baxter’s
factory and Bartlett’s brewery were completely surrounded.
In the brewery itself the water rose 3 feet 6 inches. A man
named George Tyler White was drowned in his tent at East-
grove. Some thrilling and valiant rescues were effected
at East grove, Major Blackshaw’s family (six in number)
were rescued from a pine tree. The boat later struck a
tree and was holed. The rescue party landed safely thanks
to Sergt. McHardy baling the boat with his helmet. *
On the 20/1/1904 325 points of rain fell in three-quarters
of an hour. Sloane Street was two feet deep in water,
whilst the flood waters in Auburn Street at the Goldsmith
Street intersection were so strong that horses could not face
them. Several storekeepers were heavy sufferers. A shock
of earthquake was felt at Goulburn on the Bth and 12th
June 1871. f Another is recorded as having been experienced
at 9.40 a.m. on the 25/9/1875. More recently slight shocks
were felt on the 19/11/1934 and the 21/11/1934. The
trunnion pipe in one of the settling tanks at the water-works
was lifted out of the water, automatically cutting off the
high-level supply. Another shock was experienced in June
19414
Many of the native Australian animals were at one
time numerous about Goulburn, as e.g.: the kangaroo, walla-
roo, various kinds of wallabies, kangaroo rat, bandicoot,
native bear (or Koala), native cat, opossum, native tiger
cat, flying squirrel, flying mice and bush rats. Wombats
lived in the Cookbundoon ranges and also dingoes. These
animals are now rarely seen within a radius of 50 miles of
Goulburn and some of them are almost extinct. A young
man 20 years old saw one of the last of the native bears
and did not know what animal it was, he said it was like
a sheep and climbed up a tree. Describing the Wollondilly

or the Mulwaree, probably the latter, in 1851, Lieut. Hender-
son mentioned the platypus as “plentiful in the waterholes.”
John Gould the ornithologist is said to have studied the
platypus in the Mulwaree.
As the blackfellow has given way to the white man so
the native animals have had to make room for introduced
species. Besides horses, cattle and sheep many wild animals
have been introduced, such as hares, rabbits, foxes, rats
and mice, all of which are regarded as pests. The domestic
dog and domestic cat also have a tendency to go bush and
become a nuisance. The rabbits are far more numerous
than any of the other wild animals introduced. They were
first seen about Goulburn about 50 years ago but did not
increase very rapidly. The young were killed by native
cats, goannas and birds of prey. After the rabbits had be-
come a serious pest in other parts of Australia, many people
believed that they would never increase in the Goulburn
district because they had so many enemies here, particularly
the native cats. However, when the native cats killed the
rabbits the rabbits killed the cats. The fur of the rabbits
that were eaten caused stomach trouble amongst the native
cats and eventually exterminated them. In the 1902 drought
droves of rabbits migrated up the Lachlan and its tributaries
and infested the Goulburn district. Poisoning, trapping
and fumigation were tried but only reduced the pest. It
was eventually controlled by wire netting fences and the
destruction of burrows and harbours. Migrations were
checked and the rabbits killed with dogs and by other means.
The other introduced animals although regarded as
pests are fairly easy to control.
About 100 different species of native birds have been
identified within a radius of 10 miles of Goulburn. Many of
these however, are greatly reduced in numbers and some are
nearly extinct, owing partly to foxes which are particularly
destructive to ground birds. Closer settlement and the
destruction of trees and native vegetation have contributed
to their extinction together with the competition of exotic
birds. During the last few years attempts have been made
to establish bird sanctuaries on the Mulwaree and Wollon-
dilly rivers. It is difficult to secure respect for these
sanctuaries —boys who collect birds’ eggs and so-called
sportsmen being the worst offenders.


Magpies seem to be on the increase, probably due to the
fact that clearing and cultivation suit them, they are not
timid, and are able to live on insects or seeds or even carrion
which ever is to hand. Parrots are far less numerous than
formerly, particularly the Larikeets which feed on honey,
as their supply fails when the trees are killed, many of them
feeding on seeds of eucalypt and sheoak, etc., as do some
of the Cockatoos. These birds are nomadic as they follow
the flowering of the Eucalypts. Many of our other native
birds are nomadic and follow favourable conditions as duck-
wood swallows and quail, also Pelicans, Ibis and some of
the Heron family. There are also seven or eight of the
eighty members of the Honey-eater family in the district.
The Welcome Swallow is of course migratory and goes to
warmer localities during the months of June, July and
August. The Snipe comes in the Spring and stays for a
couple of months. These wonderful birds nest in Japan
and Northern Asia, though one, the Painted Snipe, nests in
Australia. The Swift is a raider, he lives on the sea coast
and comes in flocks in late summer, when certain flies are
plentiful and returns to the coast the same evening.
The introduced birds, such as the starling, sparrow and
goldfinch have increased at an enormous rate. The sparrow
seems to stick to the houses but the starling does an im-
mense amount of mischief among the small native birds by
using up all the nesting sites and turning the native birds
out. Plovers and curlews are much reduced, foxes and
cultivation sharing the responsibility.
The introduced birds are more prolific and very
adaptable to new conditions. The most numerous are
starlings, sparrows and goldfinches; so far the black-bird
or Bul-bul has not appeared in this district. Almost all
introduced birds are pests being mostly grain eaters. Al-
though relentless war is waged against them particularly
starlings and sparrows, they are still increasing and native
birds although protected are rapidly diminishing. # Midway
between the birds and animals are two unique creatures,
the Platypus and Echidna. The Platypus is quite well-
known but rarely seen. There are a number in the dams
on the Wollondilly river for the Goulburn water supply.
* Miss L. P. Jessop.


Less known is the Echidna (wrongly called the Porcu-
pine). It has the beak and quills of a bird and the body
of an animal and feeds on ants. They are rarely seen but
nevertheless are quite plentiful. The Echidna lays eggs
and suckles its young. Reptiles are much reduced in num-
bers. Goannas are rare and snakes seldom seen. (About
a dozen are killed in each of the Goulburn cemeteries every
year). Blue tongue and frill lizards are met with in the
district. There are no introduced reptiles. Goulburn is
on the east side of the dividing range and there are no
Murray cod, but there are plenty of eels as these breed in
the sea and are not found west of the range. Trout (rain-
bow and brown) have been introduced but do not thrive
except in sunny streams. There are some carp and perch
in the Wollondilly and Mulwaree. Insects are similar to
those of other districts of the same altitude and rainfall.
Many of them are introduced pests. The Goulburn district
was never heavily timbered and the Goulburn Plains were
almost treeless. There was also a good area of clear
country about Kingsdale. With land settlement came ring-
barking and clearing and almost all the good timber was
cut down for fencing and building purposes. The box and
red gum were particularly valuable and fencing posts of
these have lasted for 100 years or more. The native trees
are very valuable for wind breaks as they withstand wind
and drought far better than any introduced trees. The
idea that the foliage is not sufficient to check wind is an
exploded theory as a shelter belt that will diffuse the wind
is better than a thick one over which the wind will go with-
out losing its force and strike the ground a short distance
away on the lee side. Timber that has been killed by ring-
barking and clearing has been sufficient to supply Goulburn
with firewood up to the present but it is becoming scarcer
within easy distance of the town and some of the wood is
now brought 20 miles or more.
There are more than 20 of the 400 or so varieties of
Acacia and Wattle. The bark of the Black Wattle is use-
ful for tanning leather. The bark of other wattles and the
so called hickory can also be used for this purpose. The
native trees of the Goulburn district as in other parts of
Australia are the surest indication of the capabilities of the
soil for agricultural purposes and far more reliable than
sample records and soil analysis. Box is found growing


on sound well-drained soil and red gum on poorer land that
often gets water-logged. The apple tree (a eucalyptus)
indicates deep rich soil. Stunted trees indicate shallow soil.
Treeless land that is not well-drained indicates sourness,
excess of moisture or some chemical condition unsuitable for
deep rooted plants, as all native trees have chosen their
habitat through centuries of selection or elimination.
Originally the plains were covered with Kangaroo grass
but when the country was stocked with sheep the danthonias
which are far more valuable grasses came to predominate.
Many exotic clovers and trefoils (lequaminous) were intro-
duced the seeds mostly being carried in the sheep’s wool.
The growth of these lequaminous plants can be stimulated
by the use of super-phosphates so that the native grasses
are entirely eliminated.
In much of the dry hilly country about Goulburn native
grasses are the only perennial ones that will survive a dry
summer. On good soils where there is sufficient moisture
the introduced grasses can be successfully cultivated and
like the animals and birds the introduced plants are ousting
the native species. The amount of wool, mutton, beef and
butter produced by the introduced pasture plants is gaining
on that grown on the native plants. Besides the native
grasses there are many shrubby plants that are valuable
for stock in dry times but their value is little known and
they are not a great asset as they would not survive with
heavy stocking. Of the weeds the most noticeable around
Goulburn is the sweet briar but it is not altogether an un-
mixed evil. On hard hilly country where the soil is poor
it not only checks erosion but it has a certain amount of
value as a standby for stock in a dry time.
On good soil where there is plenty of moisture its room
is preferable to its company as it will completely cover the
ground if not cut out. The Bathurst Burr is fairly plenti-
ful about the town. This is a native of South Africa. Star
and Saffron thistles are also plentiful. The Scotch or black
thistle is not considered a serious pest. The seed is carried
by the wind and however clear the land may be, seed will
come from other places. Stinkwort, skeleton weed, Patter-
son’s curse, Cape weed and most other weeds appear about
Goulburn. These are brought from outside by stock. #
