TN the records of New South
A Wales and Queensland there
is no more illuminating study
than that of the unique career
of R. Towns and Company,
and that of its founder, the late
Hon. Robert Towns, M.L.C.
With its roots in the earliest pioneering days, the com-
pany has played an historic role over years fraught with
interest —years when the marvellous development of the
Mother colony was beginning to take shape and the foun-
dation of the nation’s economic life was being laid.
When the striking personality, keen foresight and
forceful character of Robert Towns is considered, it must
seem inevitable that the company he led should take a
dominant part in the affairs of this new land.
This great individualist had already laid the foundation
of a most successful career on the high seas before he came
ashore in the land of his choice, where he was to open up
vast territories, form new industries, reorganise finance, and
help in the legislature of the new country.
These achievements take on an added significance when
it is remembered that he began life without any material
advantages whatever.
Born at Longhorsley, Northumberland, on 10th Novem-
ber, 1794, of respectable but comparatively humble parents,
he learned the elements of education at the village school.
Due, no doubt, to the proximity of Longhorsley to the coal
port of Shields, he evinced a keen desire to become a sailor,
and at a very tender age his wish was granted and he was
apprenticed to a collier plying between Shields and London.

In his chosen calling he took every opportunity that came
along to add to his slender equipment of knowledge. Already
the indomitable courage, perseverance and unflagging energy
that were to make their mark in later years began to assert
themselves.
Quickly he mastered the practical work of seamanship,
and when the vessel was in port studied the theory of navi-
"The Brothers.”
gation from an old master mariner. His aptitude was such
that he was given a position of mate at the early age of sixteen,
when most boys are still at school. A year later he secured
his Master’s Certificate and actually obtained command of
a coaster, and whilst still in his teens was entrusted with a
larger, ocean-going brig trading in the Levant and other parts
of the Mediterranean.
Many men of far greater age would have been satisfied
to have reached the top of their profession, but Robert Towns
was already working to a definite plan of advancement that
would give his abilities fuller scope. He saved and accumu-
lated sufficient capital to have built at Shields a clipper ship
ot 355 tons, which he named "The Brothers.”


About this time the British Government embarked upon
a policy of emigration to Australia. Grants of land were
offered to suitable applicants who possessed £5OO and up-
wards. On arrival each settler was to receive 500 to 2,000
acres according to his capital, six months’ free rations from
the King’s stores, and cattle from the King’s herds, which
were to be repaid in kind at the end of seven years.
The chance to begin life anew in a virgin land abounding
in opportunity, and offering a degree of independence that
might never be realised in the closely-settled and highly com-
petitive homeland, made an immediate appeal. There was a
great rush to the new colony. Rates for passengers and
cargo soared, and seizing the opportunity presented, Captain
Towns entered the Australian trade with his clipper "The
Brothers.” He first arrived in Sydney in 1827, at the age of
33, in command of his own vessel!
Robert Towns seems to have secured the lion’s share of
this trade. His ship won the reputation of being the best
managed and fastest sailer on the run, and many of the
men whose names appear most frequently in our history
came out under the care of Captain Towns. Among the pas-
sengers were such well-known people as Admiral King, the
Hon. Saul Samuel, who afterwards was a colleague of Sir
Henry Parkes, and Dr. George Bennett, who was later to
be in attendance on Robert Towns in his last illness. All of
these bore witness that Captain Towns was as smart a seaman
as ever trod a deck.
Later, a second ship, equally famous in its day, was
added, and named the "Royal Saxon,” of 510 tons.
In 1833 Captain Towns, who was a close friend of Wil-
liam Charles Wentworth, consummated by marriage the
acquaintance he had formed with the patriot’s sister. But
not yet was Captain Towns to enjoy the benefits of home
life ashore. The emigrant trade proved profitable. The
demand for agricultural labour having increased, Captain
Towns brought out from England during 1836 fourteen
agricultural families, numbering 56 persons. This business
was the more profitable because Governor Sir Richard Bourke
allowed a bounty of £lB per head for each adult and £5 for
each child.


As a result of his progressive methods and energy, Cap-
tain Towns had acquired a respectable fortune, and began to
look about for opportunities ashore that would enable him to
give up his roving life. It was at this psychological moment
that Mr. Robert Brooks, one of the principal shareholders
and founders of the Union Bank, offered him his Australian
agency. Captain Towns decided to accept it.
In 1842 the emigration boom showed signs of slacken-
ing. Over-population, unemployment and scarcity of capi-
tal began to make themselves felt. The Governor of the
colony, Sir George Gipps, having been rapped over the
knuckles by the Home Government for excessive expenditure
in bounties to shippers, shut down on all forms of encourage-
ment to those interested in the introduction of emigrants.
It was an uneasy period in the colony’s history. The
question of land tenure was causing trouble, and eventually
sales gave place to the leasehold system. Stock prices went
so low that a new industry was born of necessity, and sheep
and cattle were boiled down for their tallow. Squatters found
it more profitable to obtain 5/- per sheep for its tallow and
skin than to sell the live animal for half that amount.
It was one of the worst years in Australia’s history. In
the midst of all this turmoil and uncertainty Captain Towns
made a decision that was characteristic of his courage and
foresight, and which was the turning-point in his career.
In spite of conditions that might well have dismayed the
most hardy, Captain Towns determined, in 1842, to establish
a mercantile and shipping agency in the name of R. Towns.
He could scarcely have chosen an enterprise more dependent
upon the resources and financial stability of the colony; yet,
by unremitting energy and business ability, he succeeded in
placing his new venture on a foundation so sound that it held
its own against all competition; survived the financial panics,
industrial depressions, droughts and floods that held back
the colony’s progress between the years 1842 and 1876.
One hundred years ago Sydney was a straggling town
of less than 50,000 people, the population of the whole
colony, which included Port Phillip (Melbourne), being
about 131,000. Sydney was then only about one-third the
size of Greater Newcastle of to-day. Woolloomooloo,


Sydney Cove in 1842
Darlinghurst, Surry Hills and Redfern were the outlying
suburbs —the town proper did not extend beyond about
Market Street. Scattered dwellings, interspersed by pad-
docks, lay on the outskirts of the town; gum trees grew in
the town itself, and bullock teams wended their way along
George Street.
"Neat verandah cottages” were included in the "To Let”
advertisements in the newspapers, and some of the cottages
were described as being "pleasantly situated on the Surry
Hills.”
The western side of George Street from Charlotte Place
(now Grosvenor Street) to Bathurst Street was largely occu-
pied by the walls of the old military barracks (the barrack
buildings were in what is now Wynyard Square), the markets
(the site of the present Queen Victoria Building) and the
burial ground (now the site of the Town Hall).
The outlook in Sydney was not too cheerful when Robert
Towns established his business, but the merchants had un-
bounded faith in the future of the country, and they "budded
well.” The period of the beginning of the firm of R. Towns
is also notable for several important events, including the
introduction of gas for lighting purposes in Sydney on 24th


May, 1841, and the incorporation of Sydney as a municipality
and the declaration of the capital as a city on 20th July, 1842.
R. Towns’ first offices were, in 1844, located at Miller’s
Point, adjacent to what came to be known as Towns’ Wharf,
shipping centre and focus for trade. To-day this wharf is
called Nos 7/10 wharves, Walsh Bay, and is occupied by
Burns, Philp dc Co.’s island steamers.
Miller’s Point, 1844.
Events seemed to conspire against the firm during the
first few years of its existence. Not the least of these was the
failure of the Bank of Australia, the second bank established
in New South Wales, and one of great influence and import-
ance. Immediately a severe financial crisis was precipitated,
the estimated loss to the country being nearly one and a half
million pounds sterling, or £lO per head of the population.
Nevertheless, in the same year Robert Towns took a
leading part in inaugurating a Royal Mail Line between
Sydney and England —a gesture of faith in the colony’s
future and a far-sighted move to establish trade and attract


population. The first meeting was held on 20th June, 1844,
and in describing it in a letter to Mr. Robert Carter, of
London, Captain Towns said: "If the parties interested are
to have the option of putting any ship up as a mail packet
which may be starting about the time the mail is to close, it
will be a mere post-office agency. I still think that a respect-
able line can be maintained, provided the Government will
give sufficient to secure you from loss. You will say: 'This
is what we want, and how much will suffice for that?’ I have
thought that if you can get £5OO a vessel from this end it
would secure you, as not about four vessels would be deficient
of freight, and with activity and well connected here your
vessels would soon gain a preference; when I say £5OO I
think I leave a margin—parties here think £3OO a ship.
Vessels about 350 tons, with first-rate accommodation and
respectable commanders, when such are established and well
known to sail to their time, will carry all before them.”
Whaling Scene.
In this year of 1844, and in the face of terrible con-
ditions, Captain Towns began to expand his business, pushing
out in new directions for trade. He employed many vessels,
and began whaling operations on a large scale. He also
opened up trade with the Pacific Islands, Torres Strait, Straits
Settlements, Java, Manila, and Hongkong, buying sandal-
wood, beche de mer, cocoanut oil and similar goods.

It was in 1845
that Sir Thomas Liv-
ingstone Mitchell em-
barked upon his fourth
expedition to explore tropical Aus-
tralia, and discovered the Fitzroy
Downs, Maranoa, Belyando and Vic-
toria Rivers.
The opportunity presented by
this new outlet for population was
seized by Captain Towns and other
traders who became possessed of large tracts of land in this
virgin territory.
With the rapidly
growing burden of his
enterprises it might be sup-
posed that Robert Towns
would restrict his energies
to their guidance, yet in
1851 he took an active
part in reorganising the
Bank of New South Wales, 1851.
Bank of New South Wales. Its capital was increased and its
methods remodelled on a wider basis, in preparation to cope
with the altered conditions of the colony consequent on the
discovery of gold. His genius for finance was such that he
was appointed chairman of the Bank in 1853.
His business operations by this time had become too vast
for one man to control, and in the latter part of 1853 he
arranged a partnership with Mr. Alexander Stuart (later Sir
Alexander Stuart) to share his responsibilities and permit the
further expansion his active and restless nature demanded.
Mr. Stuart was born at Edinburgh in 1825, and came to
Australia in 1851, where he entered the Bank of New South
Wales as assistant secretary. From this position he rose to
10


that of secretary and inspector of colonial branches, and was
everywhere acknowledged to be the most able financier of
his day.
The partnership effected,
the firm, now R. Towns & Co.,
immediately undertook a pro-
gramme of expansion, which
was helped by the surge of pro-
gress that occurred in 1854.
The first foreign steamer ar-
rived in Sydney—the "Golden
Age,” from the United States.
Foreign trade opened up. The
first railway in N.S.W. was con-
structed between Sydney and
Parramatta in 1855. Captain
Towns and his new partner were
well in on this wave of pros-
perity. They became identified
with a great number of enter-
prises, of which one was the

introduction of cotton growing in Queensland, where he
formed a plantation of 2,000 acres at a cost of £20,000,
and worked it with 250 South Sea Islanders. They also
engaged in meat-preserving and the tinning industries in
various parts of New South Wales and Queensland.
In 1856 Robert Towns was appointed a member of the
first Legislative Council under Responsible Government, and
became the Hon. Robert Towns, M.L.C. In 1861 he played
a prominent part in one of the most dramatic incidents in the
history of New South Wales politics. The Cowper Govern-
ment, wishing to pass a Land Bill, set out to "swamp” the
Upper House, and actually had about 20 proposed new
appointees at Parliament House ready to be sworn in. The
Minister for Lands, Sir John Robertson, informed the Presi-
dent of the Legislative Council, Sir William Burton, of the
Government’s intention. What followed is told in the
Parliamentary report: —
"The President said: T have held the position in
which I stand at present with honour; I will not consent
to hold it with dishonour, and I have immediately upon


receipt of that verbal communication resigned my office
into the hands of His Excellency.’
"The President thereupon left the Chair and
retired from the Chamber. At the same time all the
members on the Opposition benches rose and walked out
of the Chamber exclaiming, 'Let us follow him,’ and
Captain Towns calling out, 'Follow your leader,’ ”
The Councillors opposed to the Government then
resigned. Robert Towns was again appointed to the Legis-
lative Council on 17th June, 1863, under the life tenure
system.
Robert Towns was president of the Sydney Chamber of
Commerce during the years 1856-1857 and 1865.
In the meantime, the ever-growing scope of the firm’s
business, which included mercantile, shipping, coal, whaling,
cotton growing, meat packing and other activities, was now
still further widened by the purchase of large tracts of
country in the north, and in conjunction with Sir Charles
Cowper and Sir John Robertson, both of whom held the
office of Premier in their day, acquired an immense station
property in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Still the mercantile side of the firm’s business continued
to grow. In 1860 the firm was offered, and accepted, an
important agency for American tobaccos —T. C. Williams Co.
of Richmond, Virginia—retaining the connection right up to
1904, when T. C. Williams’ interests were disposed of to the
British-American Tobacco Co. in Australia.
At this time the Hon. Robert Towns, M.L.C., engaged
in large scale activities in Queensland; organised a new port,
which was named TOWNSVILLE after him; acquired ex-
tensive properties, and engaged in new industries. The
record of these years, beginning with 1863, compiled by
W. J. Doherty, is quoted;—
"In the year 1863, Robert Towns took over Fan-
ning Downs, Woodstock, and other pastoral properties
from the Banks, and John Melton Black, the pioneer
of Fanning Downs, was appointed general manager.
"At the time Bowen was the only port for North
Queensland, and the long haulage of goods to the


Townsville, 1865.
interior was found troublesome. To Woodstock the
journey was one hundred miles, whereas the coast at
Cleveland Bay could be reached in a quarter of that
distance. It occurred to J. M. Black that a new landing-
place might be found, and therefore he sent Andrew
Ball and Mark Watt Reid to make an exploring trip.
In April, 1864, they discovered Ross River and Ross
Creek.
"When J. M. Black arrived upon the scene he
was immediately impressed with the shipping possi-
bilities of Ross Creek, and he fancied that a successful
township could be established. Naturally he submitted
the good news to Robert Towns, and very soon the
partnership of Towns and Black was formed to push
matters forward. About that time a new northern port
had been opened at Cardwell, so that the Queensland
Government was not greatly impressed with the Cleve-
land Bay proposition. But the Hon. Robert Towns,
M.L.C., had come to be a prominent figure in Brisbane,
as he had started large cotton and sugar plantations
on the Logan River. It is certain that without the
strong advocacy of Robert Towns the interests of the
proposed port and township on Cleveland Bay would

have been neglected or shelved for some considerable
time.
"In November, 1864, men were set to work by
Towns and Black to erect the first wharf on Ross Creek,
and to blast away some rocks from the entrance. The
township was laid out, and as soon as the survey was
made the firm commenced the erection of the Criterion
Hotel, stores, butcher’s shop, blacksmith’s shop, etc.
The first land sale took place at Bowen on 31st July,
1865. Towns and Black purchased a number of the
allotments at auction, but 'the Government did not give
them one square inch of land.’
"Some short time afterwards they purchased a
large area of agricultural land in the suburbs, where
a cotton plantation was formed and a boiling-down plant
erected. It can thus be seen that when J. M. Black
sold out to Robert Towns, in 1867, their interests con-
sisted of city and suburban property, including an hotel,
general merchants and shipping business. From the first
all the money for the enterprise had been provided by
Robert Towns.
"The young township grew with remarkable
rapidity, as business men were attracted from Bowen,
and Cleveland Bay became the shipping place for pas-
toralists on the Burdekin and Flinders Rivers,
"On 15th February, 1866, the A.S.N. steamer,
'Rangatira’ arrived for the first time. This was regarded
as a very important event for three reasons: —


1. A regular steam service was thus established.
2. The mail carried the proclamation constituting
Townsville as a municipality.
3. Hon. Robert Towns was a passenger.
"A great banquet was held at the Criterion Hotel,
at which Captain Harley, of the 'Rangatira,’ and Hon.
Robert Towns were the chief guests. The function was
attended by the Mayor of Bowen and two of the aider-
men, all the leading men in Townsville, and a few
pastoralists, also by Revs. Searle and Father McGinty,
who were making their first appearance in the new
settlement.
There can be no doubt that the visit of Hon.
Robert Towns was made as pleasant as possible, and
that he was greatly impressed with what he saw. When
the first Hospital Committee was formed he was elected
patron, and about the same time he was elected president
of the Townsville, Burdekin and Flinders Turf Club.
"The first mayor of the new municipality was his
partner, J, M. Black."
"The place was called TOWNSVILLE after Robert
Towns. Most likely this name was selected by Sir A. C.
Gregory, the Surveyor-General of Queensland, but
previous to the proclamation of the first land sale
Townsville was referred to as Cleveland Bay or Port
Cleveland."
Somewhere about 1867 Captain Towns was instrumental
in pioneering the coal-mining industry in Queensland by
opening up mines at Redbank, on the Brisbane River. From
this beginning the coal-mining industry in Queensland has
grown to an annual yield of more than a million tons. In the
same locality and at the same time, Captain Towns established
meatworks.
At the close of 1870, Mr. Stuart’s nephew, Mr. William
Edward Wilson, arrived in Sydney from Edinburgh in the
old "Sobraon,” commanded by Captain Emslie.
Three years later —11th April, 1873 —Captain Towns
died in his 79th year at "Cranbrook," his home at Rose Bay.
Thus ended a life whose story was also that of the colony’s
advancement and commercial development. Robert Towns
was peculiarly well fitted to the times in which he lived and was


an essential factor in the historic march of events that marked
the colony’s earliest years. Australia owes much to this great
individualist, whose commercial achievements went hand-in-
hand with devotion to the welfare and progress of the land he
loved so well.
”Cranhrookß. Towns’ Home at Rose Bay.
The "Herald,” of 12th April, 1873, reported the death
of the Hon. Robert Towns as follows:—
"Another and much-respected colonist has passed
away at a good old age. For fifty years the position of
Captain Towns has been one of industry and enterprise.
It will be admitted by all who knew him that no man
for so long a period has striven with more resolution to
advance the interests of New South Wales. Earnest,
active and independent —whilst endeavouring to advance
his own commercial welfare he was equally desirous of
benefiting and helping others.”
Late in the same year the company leased central offices
at the corner of George Street and Charlotte Place (now
Grosvenor Street), the present site of Union House, and the
site of the first Lieutenant-Governor’s house from 1788 to
1809.
In addition to controlling large operations in mercantile,
shipping and pastoral interests, Mr. Stuart now began to take
a very active part in politics, and in 1874 was elected member
for East Sydney. The responsibilities of political life occupied


more and more of his time, however, and in 1875 it became
necessary to appoint Mr. W. E. Wilson and Mr. Edward
Stephen, son of Chief Justice Stephen, as joint managers of
R. Towns Qc Co.
In the following year Mr. Stuart became Colonial
Treasurer in the Robertson Government, and in 1883, on the
defeat of the Parkes-Robertson Coalition Ministry, Mr. Stuart
(afterwards Sir Alexander Stuart) formed a Government.
Of Mr. Stuart’s political activities, Walter E. Bethel wrote in
"The Sun”:—
"I remember Sir Alexander when he became
Premier of New South Wales in 1883. I remember
him speaking from the hustings in Hyde Park. He had
a very capable Ministry associated with him, and one
that included some strong personalities. Three members
of his team became Premiers of New South Wales in
their turn, and one of the three Prime Minister of
Australia as well.” (George R. Dibbs and George H,
Reid led N.S.W, Ministries and William Bede Dailey
became Acting-Premier Reid later became Prime
Minister.)
Meanwhile, important developments were taking place
in the economic life of the community and in which the firm
of R. Towns 8C Co. played a part. The firm was appointed
agents (1879) for the Baldwin Locomotive Works, of Phila-
delphia (U.S.A.), and was instrumental in introducing the
first steam trams in Australia. A number of the largest
engines manufactured by the Baldwin
Co. were imported from time to time for
the New South Wales Government for
hauling heavy mountain traffic.
Mr. Stuart visited America in 1879,
and returned with the first two Edison
telephones imported into New South
Wales.
The same year was also marked by
two other events in the firm’s history —
the opening of the Shamrock Meat
Works, at Maitland, New South Wales,
and the arrival from Glasgow of

Hawkesbury River Bridge.
Mr. Robert James Wilson by the small steamer "Hilda”
(135 tons), commanded by Captain H. Grainger. This
steamer, together with the "Herga,” was specially built in
Scotland (1878) to carry coal from the firm’s Coalcliff
collieries on the South Coast.
The following year R. Towns 8c Co. were appointed
agents for the Pacific Mail Steamship Co., trading between
San Francisco and Sydney with the steamers "City of New
York” and "City of Sydney.”
In 1881 a small parcel of goods was sent to R. Towns
& Co. by Weekes & Potter, of Boston (U.S.A.), for sale in
Australia.
_ Such was the beginning of an association which has
grown closer with the years, and which is described in "Old
Times,” April, 1903, in these words: —
"A correspondence was initiated which was after-
wards extended when this firm merged itself in 1883
into the Potter Drug and Chemical Corporation of
Boston, whose brand of "Cuticura” is now a household
word in almost every city, town or hamlet in the civilised
world. Few would have dreamt that the business, started
in a comparatively small way in Boston 25 years ago,
could have grown to the enormous proportions that it
has assumed.”


In 1920 a decision was made to manufacture "Cuticura”
preparations in Australia in association with R. Towns & Co.
Now in 1942 (61 years later) the connection still exists —
the passing years having stood the test of time in what has
been a most happy association.
In 1884, a year after Mr. Alexander Stuart had become
Premier and Colonial Secretary, Mr. C. E. Stokes, for many
years a merchant in Newcastle, N.S.W., and Mr. W. E.
Wilson were admitted as partners in R. Towns & Co.
In the following year (1885) work was begun on the
iron girder railway bridge over the Hawkesbury River —still
among the largest engineering works of its kind in Australia.
The national importance of the undertaking was only equalled
by the technical difficulties encountered during construction
owing to the peculiar instability of the river bed. The fact
that the bridge was successfully completed and has been in
constant use ever since is a standing tribute both to Mr.
Charles MacDonald, who supervised construction, and the
contractors, The Union Bridge Co., of New York. The
bridge was opened in May, 1889. R. Towns 6C Co. acted
throughout as general agents for the contractors.
Among the many notable characters with whom the
firm’s business dealings brought them into contact about
this time, none was more interesting than the late Robert
Louis Stevenson. This famous
writer set out from San Francisco
in 1887 to tour the South Seas
aboard his schooner "Casco.”
With him he took his
mother, his wife and adopted
family, Lloyd Osbourne, Mr. and
Mrs. Strong and their little son.
During his wandering among the
Pacific Islands he visited Sydney
several times, and on one of these
occasions appointed R. Towns dC
Co. as his Australian agents. In
June, 1889, writing from Hono-
lulu, R. L. Stevenson advised
that he was sending to the care
of R. Towns 8C Co. several of his
manuscripts for safe keeping.
R. L. Stevenson.


Mr. Alexander Stuart was knighted in June, 1885, and
became Sir Alexander Stuart, K.C.M.G. Because of ill-health
he resigned his office of Premier 6th October, 1885, being
succeeded by Sir George Dibbs. Sir Alexander was appointed
to the Legislative Council 7th October, 1885. He later went
to London, where he acted with
marked success in the capacity of Ex-
ecutive Commissioner for New South
Wales at the Colonial and Indian ex-
hibition until the time of his death on
16th June, 1886.
The following years were to see
several changes in the control of R.
Towns 6>C Co. In 1896 Mr. Stokes
died, Mr. Robert James Wilson was
admitted to partnership, and conduct-
ed the management with his brother,
Mr. W. E. Wilson.
Sixteen years later (1912), Mr.
W. E. Wilson retired from the busi-
ness, and in the following year (1913)
Mr. Frederick White, who had been
with the firm since 1907, became a
partner.

Mr. R. J. Wilson died 18th
December, 1935, and the business
passed into the control of Frederick
White. Robert James Wilson was
intensely proud of his association with
R. Towns Qc Co., and for some time
prior to his passing expressed the
personal wish that at an opportune
time something might be done to per-
petuate the name of R. Towns 6C Co.
So when the N.S.W. Companies Act
was amended to permit the registra-
tion of "Proprietary” Companies,
action was taken to incorporate the
firm as from July, 1937, under the
name of R. Towns Qc Co. Pty. Ltd.
