manufacture. They are strong, durable, and simple in construction, and cannot
be put out of grder except by gross carelessness or violent misusage.
For a confirmation of our assertions we would respectfully refer to the manufac-
turing establishments of Messrs. Sargood, King and Sargood; Messrs. Harris and
Heymanson; Messrs. Solcsberg and Son; Messrs. Patterson, Ray, Palmer, and Co.;
Messrs. Lang and Webster ; Messrs. Warne and Webster, Monster Clothing Com-

THE UNIVERSAL COG-WHEEL CLOTHES-WRINGER,
SELF-ADJUSTING AND ADJUSTABLE.
The only Wringer with the Patent Cog-wheel Regulator for turning both rolls
together, and which positively prevents the rolls from breaking or twisting on the
shaft. It is not only a perfect Wringer, but the cog-wheels give it a power which
renders it a most excellent washer. The cog-wheels prevent all wear and tear of
clothes by the friction of the rolls, or breaking of stitches by twisting.

To arrive, ex “ Tanjore,” from New York, the Great New Invention,
A SEWIMG MACHINE FOR MAKING BUTTONHOLES

MR. C. LANGE,
SURGEON-DENTIST,
G 4 COLLINS STREET EAST, MELBOURNE,
TWO DOORS ABOVE SWANSTON STEEET.
MR. C. LANGE supplies Artificial Teeth on his new system of _ Self-Adhesion,
without extracting any Teeth or Stumps, or causing the least pain. _ A new and
elegant improvement connected with DENTAL SURGERY has been invented by
Mr. C. Lange, Surgeon-Dentist. It isthe construction of an entirely New Descrip-
tion of Artificial Teeth, Beautifully Enamelled, 'and of the Most Exquisite Work-
manship, from part of a Tooth to a Complete Set, and are composed of the Finest
Materials, which are afterwards Enamelled to resemble the Natural Teeth, in every
shade and colour. They are Incorrodible (will Never Change Colour or Decay),
and when adapted to the mouth, are not discernible from the. natural teeth. They
are Constructed upon metals of Unexceptionable Purity, on the Much Admired
Principle of SELF-ADHESION
A new, Original,
and Invaluable
Invention, which
has been brought
to the most ab-
solute perfection
and success. The
extraordinary re-
sults of this ap-
plication may be
briefly noticed in a
few of their more
prominent fea-
tures:—All sharp
edges are avoided;
no springs, wires
or fastenings are
required; a greatly
increased freedom
of suction is sup-
plied, a natural
elasticity hitherto
wholly unattain-
able; a fit perfected
with the most un-
erring accuracy is
secured; whilst
from the softness
and fixibilityof the
agent employed,
the greatest sup-
port is given to the
adjoining teeth when loose, or rendered tender by the absorption of the gums.
All Artificial Teeth inserted by Mr. C. Lange are Warranted to be Perfect for
Use and Comfort.
Filling Decayed Teeth. —Mr. C. LANGE’S Metallic Gemeut,
Which never changes colour, and is free from those injurious properties found in
ordinary stoppings. It is applied in a state like Paste to the cavities of the Tooth,
without giving the slightest pain, and in a few minutes it becomes as hard as the
enamel of the tooth itself. The operation of stopping decayed teeth is frequently
performed in so careless a manner, as to be utterly useless. To avoid this, a
respectable dentist must be employed. The affected tooth should be attended to
in as early a stage of decay as possible; and if the caries be scientifically
and carefully removed, and the cavity plugged with gold, or an indestruc-
tible composition (according to the extent of the disease), the tooth will then be
rendered as useful as ever, and will remain so for many years. The importance of
timely attention to the teeth will be acknowledged, when we consider the injurious
effects on the constitution of the poisonous and foetid gases generated by the
decomposing animal matter during the destruction of the teeth, that are inhaled
by the lungs at every inspiration, consequently, seriously impairing the general
health. The fact is, perhaps, not sufficiently attended to by the medical practitioner.
MR. LiMGE’i ODOWTALOIC ESSENCE.
The Odontalgic Essence is an instantaneous cure for the most agonising Toothache, Neuralgia,
Tic-Doloureux, and all diseases of the gums and teeth. Price 3s. per bottle, only to be had of
Mr. C. Lange, Surgeon-Dentist, 64 Collins-street east.
Extract of a letter from the New Zealand gold-fields:—“ The first three days I was suffering
dreadfully from the most agonising toothache ; it was impossible for me to work, and I consider
the loss sustained through it would amount to five ounces of gold. On the evening of the third
day I met Mr. Brown; he gave me some of Mr. Lange’s Odontalgic Essence, and the effect of it
was really wonderful. I have not felt the least pain since. I think everyone ought to provide
himself with sound teeth, as the weather is very wet and changeable. Tell Henry to come as
quick as possible; and send me a few bottles of Mr. Lange’s Odontalgic Essence, as a great
many are suffering from toothache.
