THE FROGS' ORCHESTRA
Now that spring is drawing near,
The frogs their orchestra prepare.
On lily pad each take a seat,
Their white shirt fronts all clean and neat.
Father Bullfrog guides the band,
With bullrush baton in his hand.
First, beneath the rising moon
They play a most pathetic tune
Of "Froggie who would wooing go."
His tragic fate you all must know.
It's followed by a lively air
Called "Dill/ Duck Dies of Despair."
Then next an item "All Alone" —
A solo on the big trombone.
"The Frogs' March" follows. It sounds good
With instruments of wind and wood.
And so, through all the night they play,
Until the earliest sign of day.
Then, with a hop, a leap, a splash,
Beneath the water cool they dash.

DON'T LEAVE IT
TO YOUR NEIGHBOUR
In ancient times a learned man
Thought he had found a splendid plan
By means of which he'd quickly tell
If people on the moon did dwell.
He said, 44 If all the human race
Should stand together in one place,
And when the order was sent out
They'd all together loudly shout,
No doubt the noise would very soon
Arouse the people on the moon."
The day arrived —it was fine weather—
And all the people stood together,
But when the leader gave the word,
Alas! no single sound was heard.
For each one to himself had thought,
44 My feeble shout will count for nought,
And who among this noisy clatter
Will miss my voice? What does it matter?


Now though this tale is but a fable,
Yet human beings, when they're able,
Still try to dodge their share of labour
And leave it all unto their neighbour.


THE SUNFLOWER
Clytie, a nymph in days of old,
Loved Apollo, we are told;
And when she found he didn't care,
She gave herself up to despair.
So long she sat, at last she found
That she was rooted to the ground.
A flower now, her face doth follow
Our flaming sun, the god Apollo.

At Taronga Park you'll often see
The native bears, each up a tree;
Billie Blue Gum doesn't care.
And when the keepers, for a treat,
Gum-tips bring for them to eat,
The sleepy bears will take a bite
And once again their eyes close tight.
From countless creatures large and small,
He is the laziest of all.
BILLIE BLUE GUM
But, though of them there's quite a number,
You'll find they all are wrapped in slumber.
Jammed in a fork they keep their place,
And clasp a branch with tight embrace.
While cameras click and people stare,

WHAT THE
KOOKABURRA SAID
A kookaburra on a tree
Gave a laugh, and said to me,
"I really find it quite a joke
To sit and study all you folk.
Very much I'd like to know
Why you hurry to and fro.
When I've dined upon a snake,
On a branch a rest I take;
But you rush about all day:
Never in one spot you stay."
While I wondered what to say,
He laughed again and flew away.

THE HUNTER
A kangaroo lay on the ground,
Wrapped in slumber most profound.
From the last line that sounds so grand,
I hope you all will understand
That it was only sleeping.
In search of food, along the track
There came a little hunting black.
/
His dress was of the simplest taste
piece of bark around his waist.
S- A V. , . v™
And when he saw the sleeping 'r
Vie "said, "For dinner this will do
HisJ heart with joy was' leaping.
\ 1 fir I
From out the bush he quickly sp
And swiftly threw his boomerang.
The kangaroo it gives a sniff,
Its little ears they stand up stiff,
Into the scrub it's staring.
And then it gives a mighty bound
Which covers twenty feet of ground.
The weapon now in circles flies
And, to the little boy's surprise,
A sudden blow he feels, most keen,
Just where his trousers should have been
If such things he'd been wearing.

CHRISTMAS EVE
'Twas Christmas Eve, and little May
Safe in her bed was tucked away.
But, no matter how she tries,
In sleep she cannot close her eyes;
For Santa Claus —how very thrilling!—
To-night her stocking would be filling
While thinking of to-morrow's joys
She hears a very curious noise—
A patter on the roof o'erhead.
She quickly jumps from out her bed,
And when her mother she has found,
She tells her of the funny sound.
Her kind mama replies with smiles,
"It's only rain, dear, on the tiles."
So off to bed once more she goes,
And snuggles underneath the clothes,
For if it's reindeer she can hear,
Then Santa Claus must now be near.

THE ANIMALS' CRUISE
The animals from everywhere
All hurried to the quay,
For the Ark was weighing anchor
And was putting out to sea.
The rain came down in torrents;
There was no time to lose
As, two by two, they came aboard
All eager for the cruise.
And now into his own state room
Each animal repairs,
To start unpacking luggage.
The crocodile's in tears
Because she says she never
Sleeps in an upper bunk;
The elephant is bawling
That he has lost his trunk.
Both the giraffes are nervous
Of pirates and of wrecks;
They sit beside a lifeboat,
Twelve lifebelts round their necks.
The centipede is busy,
ifflKffhrfi"-
Cleaning fifty pairs of shoes.
Mrs Hippo's making up
With lipstick and with rouge.

LONG, LONG AGO
Long, long ago, in ages past,
Upon our Earth grew forests vast.
But in them was no kind of tree
That you could hope to-day to see,
For ferns and mosses, tall and weird,
From out the swampy ground appeared.
No bird within this forest sings,
But hideous reptiles fly with wings.
The silence by no voice is broke
Except the bullfrogs' mournful croak.
In vain for human life you'd scan,
For this was ere the age of man.
A million years slip swiftly by.
Beneath the earth these forests lie;
And as the ages onward roll
The buried trees are changed to coal.
Now when, upon a winter's night,
You sit beside a fire bright,
And watch its cheerful ruddy glow,
Just think how, in the long ago,
Those forests, as they slowly grew,
Stored all their sunshine up for you.
We should be thankful, every one,
To our good friend the shining sun.


WHAT I HEARD IN THE TOOL SHED
In the gardener's shed when the day was o'er,
The tools lay scattered around the floor.
A rake with its rusty teeth all bent
Said, as against the wall it leant,
"Now that we all are gathered here
Our meeting starts: Who'll take the chair?"
"How about me?" said the garden hose.
"I always keep cool, as everyone knows."
"Why, you're full of kinks, so don't talk rot.
You'd better choose me," said the watering pot.
Then every tool gave the reason why
The chairman's seat it should occupy.
A poor little trowel burst into tears
At the cutting words of a pair of shears.
So the quarrel grew, until peace was made
By the wise remark of Father Spade,
Who said, "We're behaving like human fools.
Instead of sensible garden tools."
But who took the chair I cannot say,
Because it was then I was called away.

THE PLATYPUS
When first they saw a platypus,
The scientists made quite
They said, "This creature
Its feet and bill are like
Yet still—and this seems
The body is all clothed i
a fuss.
is absurd,
a bird,
bird,
very queer-
in hair,
And, though it has two pairs of legs,
The little ones are hatched from eggs.
A beast like this cannot be true,
For no such creature ever grew.


i. ■^^■i
New Holland has some curious things
That hop with legs, and flap with wings,
But now they're trying fun to poke:
It's easy seen the thing's a joke."
English scientists, when they first saw a stuffed
platypus, were convinced that someone had made
the creature up for a joke.


SIR ISAAC NEWTON
Sir Isaac Newton, you all know,
Who lived two hundred years ago,
Brought fame unto our nation.
An apple falling on his head,
He picked it up and calmly said,
"The cause is gravitation."
In mathematics he was skilled.
The scientific world was thrilled
By problems he kept solving;
For it was he who found out why
The planets all stayed in the sky
While round the sun revolving.
One day a friend who chanced to call
Found him beside the garden wall,
And with surprise was smitten
When Isaac said, "These holes I'm at
I've made a large one for the cat,
A small one for the kitten."


THE GOLDEN TOUCH
King Midas, who loved gold so much,
From Bacchus begged the "golden touch"
And everything, so we are told,
Was by his hand turned into gold.
His bed, his clothes, his favourite chair
At once turned to this metal rare.
With joy he through his palace ran,
Until his breakfast he began.
At the first bite he gave a jump,
For in his mouth a molten lump
Of gold his food at once became;
And every mouthful did same.
His little daughter, when she hears
Her father shout, bursts into tears.
But when to soothe her fright he tries,
And pats her head, before his eyes,
Instead of living flesh and blood,
A golden statue by him stood.
And now he begs the god to lift
From off his hands that fatal gift.
Bacchus, in pity at his cries,
Informs him where the cure lies.
He seeks the river where he bathes;
The "touch" is washed off by the waves
But evermore, so it is said,
There's gold found in that river bed.

Each Christmas Eve at Taronga Park,
When the sun has set, and its growing dark
You would be surprised if you only knew
What a change occurs at that famous Zoo.
For by the magic of Christmas-tide
The doors of the cages are opened wide,
And all the creatures, quite free from fear,
Step out to enjoy the evening air.
The garden paths they saunter along,
A happy, friendly, carefree throng.
To the miniature train the monkeys run,
And riding on it have lots of fun.
The hyena's cheerful laugh you hear
As he cracks a joke with the polar bear.
The tiger bows to Madam Gazelle
And asks if her family are keeping well;
While Mrs Camel, without a sneer,
Calls the baby hippo a "little dear,"
And tells the doting and proud mama
That her son is as handsome as his papa.

Whether stripes or spots are the latest wear;

m When everyone's had enough to eat,
IT They hurry away to obtain a seat
At the annual concert, where each one tries
To exhibit his talents, and win a prize.
The parrots recite, and the wallabies croon;
A native bear plays on a big bassoon;
The crow and the peacock try to sing,
While the elephant dances a Highland fling;
Till all the creatures, from rabbits to gnus,
Have tried the audience to amuse.
Next the stage is darkened, and then they see,
Lit up with candles, a Christmas-tree;
And not one creature in all that host
But receives the gift it would like the most.
Then carols are sung, good-byes are said,
And all of them hurry away to bed.


THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA
It was a dark and stormy night:
The thunder rolled, and flashes bright
Of lightning filled the sky.
With clothes all torn and tear-stained cheeks
A lonely maiden refuge seeks
At the castle perched on high.
The warder listens to her tale,
Takes pity on her face so pale
And opens wide the gate.
He leads her up a winding stair
To where the baron's lady fair
Sits in her chair of state.
The lady asked the maid her name,
And how it was that now she came
To be in such great need.
"Alas!" she answered with a sigh.
44 An emperor's daughter once was I,
Though few my story heed.
44 My mother died, my heart with pain
Was filled, my father wed again.
She hated me, I ran away
Her story told, with downcast eyes
She stands, until the dame replies,
44 To-night with us you'll stay."
The maiden's room they now prepare:
Ten feather beds they place with care,
All soft as soft can be.
But at the bottom of the pile
The lady, with a knowing smile,
Slips in a tiny pea.


Time quickly passed; soon morning broke;
The maiden from her sleep awoke
To find the lady near,
Who said: " Now was your bed all right,
And did you have a peaceful night?
Just answer without fear."
"I must confess," the maiden said,
"That sleep I could not in this bed.
No matter how I lay."
The lady smiled and said, "I see
A genuine princess you must be,
My son you'll wed this day."


A TRIP TO THE MUSEUM
Isabel and I, in our quest for knowledge,
Went to the museum, in the street called College
There every creature that walks or flies
Stared at us with it's glassy eyes.
Skeletons, too, were grouped about
With their outsides off, and their insides out;
Hungry lions in search of a meal,
Horrible snakes that made Izzie squeal,
A winter scene with penguins and seals,
All kinds of fishes from sharks to eels;
Spears and clubs and murderous knives,
A cannibal chief with his dusky wives;
Beautiful birds with nests and eggs,
Loathsome spiders with hairy legs.
All this we saw, and a great deal more,
And we left the museum at ten past four.

MONSIEUR PAUL'S DILEMMA
Stout Monsieur Paul was most excited:
This was the day he'd been invited
To dinner, a most grand affair,
And he'd been asked to take the chair.
But from his bedroom, oh, what cries
As his new dress suit on he tries!
"That wretched tailor" how he scolds!
His trouser legs hang down in folds.
And now his wife he vainly begs
To "take six inches off the legs."
She says her time is all engaged,
And leaves the poor man quite enraged
His spinster aunt then next he tries;
She gives a look of shocked surprise.
"To mention such things isn't fitting.
Besides, I'm busy with my knitting."
Next to the kitchen he repairs.
The cook his plea in silence hears.
Her face it goes a shade more red,
And then she slowly shakes her head.
Quite ovecome he slams the door,
And leaves the garment on the floor.
But later on, filled with regret,
They all in turn the trousers get.
The alteration soon is done,
Each thinking she's the only one.
Monsieur Paul, his rage soon o'er,
Is asked to try them on once more.
Was ever man so hard to please?
They now reach only to his knees.

TOO MUCH ADVICE
A Chinese farmer named Ah Fun
Set off for market with his son.
And, by a rope around its head,
Behind them both an ass they led.
They trudged along the dusty way;
All three of them were feeling gay.
The little ass had not been told
That he was going to be sold.
Just as the road came to a bend,
The farmer chanced to meet a friend
Who said, "Why walk on side by side
When one of you could have a ride?"
The boy climbed on the ass s back.
Once more they followed on the track,
Until they to a village came,
When all the people shouted, "Shame!
That lazy son to have a seat
While father tramps on in the heat!"
The three of them then halt a space,
As son and father change their place.
They amble on until they see
A group of ladies 'neath a tree,
Who, when the farmer they espy,
At once with indignation cry
That to his son he is unkind;
So up he takes the boy behind.
The poor ass groans beneath the load,
And staggers on along the road.

They reach at last the city wall,
When passers-by commence to bawl,
"Who ever saw a pair so cruel?
They treat that poor ass like a mule.'
Off they jump, quite in despair,
And seize a pole that's lying near.
To it their beast's four legs they tie,
And carry him off shoulder-high.
But when across a bridge they pass,
The struggles of the little ass
Increase, until the pole goes smash,
And in the river there's a splash.
One final glimpse of his long ears,
Then 'neath the waves he disappears.
And now, too late, the farmer sees
That everyone you cannot please.

MY TELESCOPE
When I'm a grown man, I hope
To make a monstrous telescope.
I'll turn it on the Milky Way,
And maybe see the Twins at play,
Or perhaps the Goat, the Ram, the Bull,
The Man with waterpot so full.
And other creatures I may spy
That people say live in the sky.

THE MAGIC WOOD
" Now, Pat and Pam," said mother dear,
"While I'm away you must take care.
Behave as all good children should,
And don't go near the Magic Wood."
The children promised to obey,
And from the garden not to stray.
They played about in sunshine bright
Until they saw a curious sight:
A rabbit standing at their gate
And shouting, "Children, don't be late!
Just hurry up and follow me,
If wondrous things you want to see."
Their promises all flung aside,
The gate they quickly open wide
And, mother's words no longer heeding,
Run down the lane, the rabbit leading.
Still faster, faster grew the pace;
They give no thought to time or place
Until they reached a house that stood
Concealed within the Magic Wood.
A stranger house they'd never seen:
Its window panes were gelatine,
Of chocolate slabs the walls were made,
With liquorice tiles the roof was laid.
Each bush that in the garden grew
Bore jelly beans of every hue.
The door was formed of almond rock,
And marked on it was, "Taste —don't knock!"


\Y Ay ] *
But when they went to take a bite,
The rabbit disappeared from sight.
Instead, there stood a hideous crone
With hat shaped like an ice-cream cone.
Her nose and chin did almost meet,
Like claws were both her hands and feet.
She gave a horrid toothless grin,
And quickly dragged the children in.
Now in a cage she places Pat,
And grimly says, "We'll make you fat!"
While Pam is given a large broom
And told to sweep out every room.
Within the witch's house they stay:
There is no chance to run away.
Oh, how they wish they had been good,
And not gone near the Magic Wood!
In spite of all his frightened squeals,
Poor Pat the witch each morning feels,
Until one day she says, "You'll do!
To-morrow I shall have a stew."
Next day, while Pat and Pam are toiling
To get the monstrous cauldron boiling,
The witch picks up the pepper pot,
And says, "I likes my stews real hot."
From off the pot the lid it flies,
The pepper fills the witch's eyes.
Then as she gives sneeze after sneeze,
Their chance the children quickly seize
And, slipping through the open door,
Run home to mother dear once more.

THE PARTY
Sometimes at night,
When the moon shines bright,
The field mice give a party;
And there you will meet
All the elite,
With appetites good and hearty.
The food is the best,
So each older guest
At the menu soon is glancing,
While near at hand
A cricket band
Sets all the young folk dancing.
At cards some play,
And others stray
To the garden, in couples walking;
While stout papas,
Smoking large cigars,
On politics soon get talking.
They have lots of fun
Till they see the sun
Above the horizon climbing,
Good-byes are said,
Then away to bed
And that's the end of my rhyming.


fm The mice in solemn conference sat: J

W And how from out a trap to squeeze. / /

The way to check our greatest foe J
If round her neck a bell we tie,
We'll always know when she is nigh,
And then no matter how she tries
She'll never take us by surprise."
They all agreed his plan was sound;
He took his seat mid cheers profound.
An old mouse tottered to his feet,
"Your plan, I think, is very neat.
One simple thing remains, and that
Is which of you will bell the cat?"

HOUSE HUNTING
" I want a flat," said Mother Pig.
"It must be clean, and not too big."
The agent questioned, "Mrs P.,
How many in your family?"
"Alas! since I lost little Ben,
My children only number ten."
His head the agent sadly shook,
And slowly closed his letting book.
" I can't oblige you, for, you see,
Flats and children don't agree."
Poor Mother Pig her family takes,
And for the graveyard now she makes.
She tells her children there to stay,
As she will not be long away.
Another agent now she sees,
And when he asks, "What children, please?"
She sadly gives her head a bow
And says, "They're in the graveyard now."

THE CATS' HIGH JINKS
Last night beside the garden wall,
The cats they held their annual ball,
And found it most exciting.
A full moon shone, the sky was clear.
Madam Persian, with haughty stare,
Saw common cats from everywhere
From bus and tram alighting.
Poor Lady Manx arrived in style,
With aching heart beneath a smile,
her tail, though brief, is tragic.
The Lord Mayor, looking very grand,
Takes her gently by the hand,
Gives a signal to the band.
The dancing starts like magic.
And now the ball is under way,
Both young and old are feeling gay—
The music is delightful—
Till two young Toms cannot agree
About a certain charming she,
And fight" a duel beneath a tree.
The noise they make is frightful.
Now supper's served. Oh, what a rush!
How they push, and how they crush!
Their manners are appalling.
For in a way that is far from nice
They seize upon the cream and ice,
And at the sight of jellied mice
They send the waiters sprawling.
The elder folk they now depart,
But younger ones, who think they're smart
Their high jinks still are keeping.
They carry on with noisy cry
Until the sun is in the sky.
So now you know the reason why
Your can all day was sleeping.

THE INSURANCE AGENT
Although all day he'd done his best,
Poor little Mole felt quite depressed.
From house to house he'd rung each bell,
But no insurance could he sell.
At last he to a villa came
Catnip Cottage was its name
And there he saw beneath a pine,
A mother cat, and kittens nine.
His shabby bowler hat he raised,
And said, "Now, madam, I'm amazed
That one so young could ever be
The mother of this family.
"To make their future quite secure,
Their little lives you should insure;
And you yourself could easily be
Included in the policy."
She blushed, and slowly shook her head.
"You flatter me, I fear," she said.
But little Mole could not be baulked:
He simply talked, and talked, and talked.
Of all fatigue he soon was cured,
he had insured.
For ninety lives

THE MIDSHIPMAN
Two months before that glorious fight
When Spain and France in all their might
By Nelson were defeated,
A French and English frigate lay
Not far from Rochford, in the bay,
Close locked in action heated.
As cannon thunder overhead
With sullen roar and flashes red,
While steel on steel is smiting,
A British boy with wide-stretched jaws
(He'd helped himself to Purser's stores)
An orange large is biting,
When swift, a bullet flying wide
Goes through his cheek from side to side,
The teeth and jaws not harming.
In victory now the battle ends—
But evermore his lady friends
Think both his dimples charming.

DREAMLAND
When I am lying in my bed
I think about the books I've read
Till fast asleep, and then I see,
and then I see,
In dreams, the things I'd like to be.
Sometimes I am an Eskimo
And build an igloo out of snow.
When it is time to have a meal
I dine on blubber, from a seal.
And if I meet a polar bear,
I slay it with my trusty spear.
Again I am a diver brave,
Seeking for treasure 'neath the wave
Inside a sunken galleon's hold
I find a rusty chest of gold,
And, with my knife so keen and bright,
With shark and octopus I fight.
Or perhaps I live on prairie wide,
My home a wigwam made of hide.
On shaggy pony swift I go
To chase the ponderous buffalo.
Around my waist, foes' scalps I wear,
With eagles' feathers in my hair.
But in the morning when I wake,
I dress, and then my breakfast take.
My mother dear, and father see
I'm very glad I'm only me.




THE SWALLOWS* NEW HOME
Said Mrs Swallow to her spouse,
"We'll have to build another house;
Our friends have all stopped calling.
Since all those vulgar sparrows came,
This neighbourhood is not the same:
The noise is most appalling."
Mr S. laid down his book,
Up the morning paper took
And said, "Now listen, darling:
'For sale, within an easy flight
Across the pond, a building site.
Apply to Thrush and Starling.'"
His coat and hat at once he donned,
And very soon had crossed the pond,
The agents' words thus proving.
No time was lost about the terms
The price was but two hundred worms
So now they'll soon be moving.

FINIS
And now Bertie Beetle
Must bid you good-bye.
Of ink, brains, and paper
There's no more supply.
He hopes you've enjoyed
All these stories in rhyme,
For then he won't feel
He has wasted his time.
