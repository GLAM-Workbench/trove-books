A Word to our Readers.
The following pages consist of a compilation
of important statements, all of which have
-a bearing on the present and future well-
being of man. These statements are enforced
by passages from the Divine Word and the
illustrative writings of the apostles, and on
which they are based. The reader is earnestly
and affectionately invited to examine the
whole of these passages, and ponder them,
with a view to the confirmation of the facts
set forth. We then come into the sphere of
the Lord, of the angels, and of heaven where
the Divine Word is regarded, loved, and
obeyed ; and by this means we shall realize
even in this life the blessed privilege of
becoming Christ-like men ; and in the future
state, in our spiritual body, attain to the
estate of angel-men in heaven. “ 1 will
arise and return unto my Father.”
H. J. B.
Melbourne , 1874.

God declared, or rather brought
forth to view, for He is- so truly
the Visible Image of the In-
visible God, that to know Him,
to see Him, and to believe in
Him, (as the object of worship,)
( 10 ) is to know, to see, and to believe

Why did God manifest
Himself in the flesh ?
THAT He might become our
Redeemer and Saviour, as

He might redeem us from Hell,
and from the curse of a sinful
nature (averted, by its sinful-
ness, from God, the Foun-
tain of blessing;) and this He
effected by destroying the works


of the Devil; or, in other words,
by destroying the overwhelming
influence which the Powers of
Darkness (collectively called the
Devil) had obtained over a sinful
world (13). Secondly , He came fl?) Gal.

ration to such only as obey Him,
and who thus accept Him for
their Saviour, as well as their
Creator and Redeemer (15). £5)
This is the Christian Doctrine of n’. 4
Redemption and Salvation.


What was the principal
Doctrine taught by Jesus
Christ when in the worlds
THAT we should love God
above all things, and our
Matt, neighbour as ourselves (16).
xxl1 ’ ' This teaching the Lord illus-
trated by the perfect example
of His Humanity ; and this
Example all Christians are bound
to follow, by loving Him their
Glorified Lord, now revealed as
the Oklt True God and Eternal
Life, and by keeping His Com-
x^29jJno! mandments, and following His
Tno *v ’■>(/• s^e P s This is the Christian
jno.’xlv.'is Doctrine of a Good Life.
Jesus Christ was put to
death by the Jews: Why
did He suffer this ?
THAT by sufferings His
(lo ucu , Humanity might be made
it- 10 perfect (18), or sanctified (19) ;
xvil. 19 in thus that fallen human nature


might be reconciled to, and united ( 2 °) 2 Cor-
with God, nr Him (20); prepara- vl9
tory to individual reconciliation
by Him, through the operation of (21) Rom.
His Spirit. (21) That our Lord’s yiy. q' 11 ’
Human Nature needed Sanctifi-
cation, was a consequence of His
being made in all things like i. 22 > Heb -
His brethren (22) ; and of u '
His inheriting our fallen nature,
by being made of a woman, made (23)OaUv.
under the Law (23). He was, t- Jno! ill.’
indeed, really and truly made sin 3 & 6;Gai.
for us, yet not actual sin, (for v
He knew no sin,) but original
sin, which consists in a heredi- (24) 2 Cor.
tary tendency to evil (24); for He v ‘ 2l
bare our sins in His own Body I? 5 ) 1 Pet-
(2s) ; and, finding, by that in- u ‘
ward experience which was the
necessary effect of His tempta-
tions, that He was fashioned in
the likeness of fallen man, —of
sinful flesh, He humbled Him-
self, learning obedience by the
things w r hich He suffered, and
was obedient, even unto death
(26) ; that by death He might viii -’ 3;
destroy the power of the Heb ' y ' B
spirits of darkness over human
nature by delivering it, in


His own Person, from the
ii. i 4 6 spiritual death of sin (27). He
was tempted in all points as we
i. 4 ’ " are (28), but He overcame the
iiL2i ßeV ' Tempter (29), and by means of
temptation, especially that of the
(30) neb. Cross, He purged our sins which
(smTim were in His humanity (30).
u. 4&e 'Thus have all mankind (31), in
(32) coi i Him, Eedemption from, and
14 ' ’ Forgiveness of sins (32), even
the hereditary tendencies to evil
accumulated in our nature from
(33^ Rom. am xyloses (33), and thence-
,, forward under the Mosaic law
lx. is ° ' (34) ; for the law could not
i| 5 is Heb ' cleanse the spirit (35), nor make
(36) .'Acts inwardly just (36) ; and there-
Gai! Rif 2i fore it has been superseded by
that Hew Covenant of Grace
and truth, under which, by the
ministration of the Spirit, indi-
vidual sins and hereditary cor-
ruptions are inwardly purged,
2 Cor blotted out, after actual re-
nt 7 8; Jno! pentance and conversion (37) ;
m' i 6 A ° tS
(38) Acts God (38);Himself beingthe First
v- 31 Begotten from the spiritually
dead, and the First-Born of many
brethren made spiritually alive


by and through Him (39). If s^coiT’i.

ciliation with Q-od, had not been 19
first effected in the person of
Him, our Head and Forerunner,
they could never have been
effected in us (40) : therefore (40) i sa .
in Him alone we have these
blessings, and from Him alone
we derive the power of seeking
and realizing them ; and bt Him
alone, through the operation of
His Spirit, they are, and can be,
realized in us ; so that we may
be grafted in Him, the Living
Vine, and be accepted in the
Beloved (41). This is the Chris- (4i) Eph.
tian Doctrine of Atonement (or 6
Deconciliation) and Propitiation
for sin.


What Effect followed the
sanctifying and perfecting
of our Lord's Humanity
by means of his sufferings
or passion?
IT was glorified, and raised
from the dead by the glory of
(42) Acts the Father or Divine Nature
Eom. vi. 4; (42), and by union therewith
pwi. ii. 9, became possessed of all Divine
(43) Mark Power (43). Thus Jesus Christ,
i^’ 6 Matt! as t°. His Humanity, as well as
xxviii. is to His Divinity, became Life in
Himself, or the very essential
Life of all things, and conse-
quently Divine; and He is,
therefore, able to quicken or give
(44) John life to whomsoever He will (44),
V. 21-26 even a p W J IO come unto jj- m
that they may have life eternal
40, vif.°B7 (45). This is the Christian
Doctrine of the Lord's Resur-
rection.


Why was it necessary that
the Humanity of Jesus
Christ should he glorified
and raised from the dead?
THAT the Man Christ Jesus
might become the Mediator
between God and man, or that by
means of His Divine Humanity
Jehovah might render Himself
eternally comprehensible and ap-
proachable to His creatures; (just
as the soul of a man is made ap-
proachable hi) and through his
body) (46). And also, that by x|.27;Jno.
and from His Glorified Body, as XlV ’ 6
the appointed Medium, He might 2 ,J° h “
dispense the Holy Spirit (47) ; cor. ” xv.
for the Holy Spirit was not until fP ; 18 Epb -
Jesus was glorified (48), It is by (48) John
His Spirit with in us that the Lord
intercedes with our spirits (49), is
beseeching us to enter into cove- viil.26°27i
nant and conjunction with Him and 34
(50); and because the Humanity (50) Rev
(called the Son) incessantly ap- llh 20
plies Itself to the Divinity
(called the Father) to be the
medium of communicating to us


the Spirit of Life, Jesus Christ
(51) John figuratively said to be our Ad--
joiin ii! i * vocate with the Father, and to
Heb. vif. make intercession for us (51).
This is the Christian Doctrine of
the Lord’s Mediation and Inter-
cession.
What are the effects
attendant on the Operation
of Jesus Christ hy His
Holy Spirit ?
BY His Spirit He gives to
those who believe in Him
illumination andpower to become
sons of God; that is, power to
shun evils (which all originate in
the love of self and the world,)
(52) i cor b ecause they are sins against
ii. 10; Jno! Him (52), and to obey His holy
viif.’ commandments (53). While we
(53) Rom. do this in our lives ; walking by
John v! s that purifying, sanctifying, and
justifying Faith that worheth
righteousness hy and from the
(54) Gai. impulse of Love (54) ; He, by
ii. 24 Jas ‘ His Spirit, produces a corres-
ponding change in our hearts
i. 22,23 e ' (55); for by His Spirit He com-


municates His own Righteous-
ness, and so forgives the sins that
are past by removing their stains
from the conscience; saving us
from our sins by taking away
our evil dispositions (56) ; and |f x^v f z 2 e 0 k ;
imparting such as are just and Jno.vi.s4!
holy in their place (57). Thus | 7 OI *
Jesus is the Author and Finisher 22 & 25 ;
of our Faith and Salvation; for i’coi*
we are not saved by ourselves, vi ' 2
or by our own works of righteous-
ness, but we are saved from sin
by the operation of His Spirit
of Grace, during our co-opera-
tion (58). Our faith and obe- 58 g )
dience, (although the fruits of Titus in’.
His Spirit,) are but the means of \\ Ijg 11 - iL
Salvation, of which He, of His
free grace, is alone the Active
Cause , and therefore all the merit
thereof belongs only to Him
(59). This is the Christian Doc- 5. Luke
trine of Repentance, Forgiveness xvii.lo; 1
of Sins, Regeneration, Justifica- Epiuf.s’
tion, and Sanctification,


Why is the Gospel called
the New Testament , or
rather , Covenant f
BECAUSE it offers spiritual
blessings to mankind upon
xv°) J io n certain conditions. “If ye keep
Matt, xix! my commandments ye shall abide
17 in my love ” (GO). This is the
Christian Covenant offered to us
by Jesus Christ.

ing the Life to come f

tion to incorruption, and rises,

degree of their wickedness (77), 6att-
and all in Heaven are blessed (77) Luke
and happy in proportion to their xiL 47
goodness, or to the degree of ( 78) John
their Sanctification (78). This *jv. 2 ; 1
is the Christian Doctrine of the frz xv '
Resurrection, and of Judgment
to Life or Death Eternal.


Reader.
ALL Christian Doctrines
which are not involved in the
preceding plain and intelligible
statement of the Gospel, are
either non-essential to Salvation,
or consist of mysteries made by
man! Doth thy creed contain
unintelligible mysteries ? such as
Three Divine, Independent,
Intelligent Agents constituting
One Divine Being ; or One God
consisting of Three Objects
of worship ; or One Infinite Na-
ture, consisting of Three Infinite
Persons of diverse characters,
with other incomprehensibilities
thereon dependent? Then be
assured that, as yet, thou dost
not understand the Word of God;
the consequences of which are
declared by the Lord in Matt,
xiii. 19, (see also verse 23). How
can that enlighten thy mind or
mend thy heart, which thou
canst not comprehend, because
it involves contradictions ? Re-
ject it; it is not of God! He
would never give thee what is of


no use to thy soul! Call not
any doctrine or creed His Eeve-
lation, which reveals nothing but
His own inconsistency, and
consequent incomprehensibi-
lity ! Candidly apply these
remarks to thy present faith,
and bow to the majesty of clear,
intelligible, Scripture Truth,
which so far from being con-
trary to, or even above, is the
very perfection of, Reason. Let
the proverbs, or rather parables,
spoken by Jesus Christ concern-
ing the Rather (John xvi. 25)
now be opened to thee, for He
hath redeemed His promise of
showing us plainly of the
Rather. Do not persist in
understanding what He says
concerning the Rather, Son, and
Holy Spirit literally, when He
Himself assures you that He
spake by a parable, even that
kind of parable in which prin-
ciples are personified for the
sake of more perfect illustration
to him that “ hath ears to hear.”
Let it now be given to thee to
know the mysteries of the
kingdom of heaven (Matt. xiii.


11) as they are laid open,
through the Divine Mercy, in
the Writings of Emanuel
Swedenborg, for the building up
of the Holy City, “New Jeru-
salem,” now descending from
Grod out of heaven! (Rev.
xxi. 2).

The precepts of the Decalogue were promulgated by
Jehovah, and were not only precepts of society, but also
of religion, A. R., 529. The precepts of the Decalogue
are in every religion, and man should live according to
them from religion, A. R., 272. The first step to refor-
mation, is to live according to the commandments of
the Decalogue, A. R., 628. Through a life conformable
to the precepts of the Decalogue, conjunction is effected
with the Lord, A. R., 490. The second table of the
Decalogue is the universal doctrine of repentance,

contains general precepts of doctrine and life, but in the
spiritual and celestial senses, all things universally,

the highest to the lowest, in the interiors whereof are

vails universally, in such things as are in the circum-
ference, that is, in all and singular the parts thereof; for
hence is what is essential to the existence of the whole,
