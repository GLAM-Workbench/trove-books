The Morvada Magazine
JULY?A UGUST?I 919
The Troopship Journal of the 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments,

Edited by TROOPER GERARDY
Foreword
ALTHOUGH an outdoor man, I am not unkindly disposed to anything that suggests
literature, especially when that literature has been made by soldiers with whom I
have been closely associated for such a great length of time. Since my attention
has been directed to the contributions to this magazine in its almost completed form, I am
able to realize how the splendid efforts of all concerned in its production have produced such
pleasing results. To strangers, under whose notice it may drift, it may seem a quaint
production; but, as a souvenir, it should be of some value to the men who returned to Aus-
tralia in the Morvada.
LT.-COL. D. CAMERON, D.5.0.,

Introduction
O INC E the outbreak of war, it has been the custom with bodies of troops sailing from
and returning to Australia to create and support a troopship journal. In almost
every case the contents have been written and edited at sea; but the printing has
invariably been executed either in England or Australia; occasionally in Cairo or Colombo.
We have striven to emulate the efforts of our comrades, while the whole-hearted support
tendered by the subscribers, comprising everybody on board, has made it possible to have
this small magazine printed in our native land.
All the contributors to this journal have served with the Desert Mounted Corps, which
completed its brilliant campaign records in Syria, and many of them have had much to
relate of a retrospective character. The contents, therefore, do not strictly concern a sea
voyage, whose every incident would sound commonplace in print. The contents have been
selected 011 whatever merit they may possess; consequently we were compelled to throw
away many contributions of a pointless nature; while a number directly concerning the
campaign has served best for inclusion. Long after the voyage, certain unwritten inci-
dents of a humorous or interesting nature may be recalled, but such retrospection is of no
use to a journal which makes but one appearance.
To us, who have toiled and struggled, ridden and laughed together through long
periods of pain and stress, the realization of our survival through a game in which many
of our comrades fell; of our return to the land for which we fought, and having suffered
for, love better than ever, is overwhelming. Our present state of mind is far from being
normal. Many a man who might otherwise have given expression to some thought or
emotion, was unable to do so when called upon, but all who read the pages of this
magazine will no doubt recall our pleasant return journey, and perhaps see only the
brighter side of our strenuous days, having forgotten most of the hardships, and all that
which is unworthy of recollection.
GERARDY.

Some Blokes Reckon ?
Hp HAT the Red Sea is blue.
That our excellent band music is greatly
enhanced by the facial expressions of one,
Hoffman, a hard-working trombone player.
That the steady encroachment of the flot-
sam and jetsam on to the reserved confines
of the upper deck was regarded in some
quarters as blood-red Bolshevism.
That preserved bullock's liver is a very
tasty article of diet, in that the persistent
repetitions of its flavour often reminds a man
that he has dined- ?very annoying to some
men in rough weather.
That the man who bashed a G.M. police-
man in Colombo is very fond of arrack. That
in his most congenial moods he loves to sit
beside a flagon of water and watch it turn
white; but when darkness sets in, prefers to
drink it from the bottle with both eyes closed.
That a certain 12th Light Horse trooper
"abhors abominable food," and that he is
passionately fond of the first saloon chef.
That "The Pig" contemplates going into
business after his return to Australia. That
in pre-war days he was the premier rabbit-
vendor and bottle-gatherer in Surry Hills.
That any man who possesses a hyphenated
surname, and has slipped for a commission,
should, without delay, lodge his application to
the Secretary for Defence for Government
compensation.
That "Blackie" is very fond of animals and
rickshaw men. That after driving one for
three hours without a rest, he stroked him
tenderly on the sweaty back and gave him
sixpence.
That a well-known Light Horseman, who
has made a success as a crown and anchor-
hoard proprietor, also as a bookmaker at
military race meetings, admires the splendid
work of the Y.M.C.A., with which institution
he intends throwing in his future lot.
That "Mawdsley," better known as "Rick-
shaw," belied his name by sweeping all over
Colombo in a powerful motor car.
That troopship discipline is a disease from
which they are happily immune.
That if the black Colombo elephants stam-
pede from their places of concealment and
promenade the decks, there is likely to be a
number of Billjims left sleeping in the deep.
That a court of inquiry was held by the
Education Officers to ascertain who ate the
chalk and pinched the atlases.
That the porpoises didn't relish "Munkl-
murray's" potato-race-spuds so well as those
dumped overboard by the mess orderlies.
That Curly Holmes, when asked which
places he liked best in Egypt, replied: "Those
I don't remember."
That "Narrow" Poole is an amateur tailor.
That he accomplished the seemingly impos-
sible when he let in his best breeches, only to
discover that they would not accommodate
his legs.
That all the sth Brigade Billjims had berths
on the Dongola ?on hooks.
That the Queenslanders dined 011 back-
sheesh bananas at Colombo.
That a keen internal combustion engine-
student who regularly attended the classes for
three weeks, at the end of the voyage borrowed
a shilling dictionary from which to find out
what sort of thing an internal combustion
engine is.


That a well-known linguist, after facing
two meals of bully beef in one day, rose
dramatically from the mess table, and in a
ringing voice quoted the famous latin phrase,
"Marfeesh Stoush Anna!"
That the struggle by certain young officers
(old ones, too) for the possession of the
vacant deck chair beside the one usually
occupied by a pretty sister must inevitably
result in bloodshed.
That an oddly-contrasted pair dashing
through Colombo in a motor car, were the
Q.M. and Education Officer of a unit on
board.
That when Major won the Calcutta
Sweep on the ship's daily run, it was the first
time he'd been seen to smile for five years.
That judging by her continued absence
from the dinner table, one sister will not
spend her honeymoon sea travelling.
That the ship's daily menu shows the truth
of the old saying that much may be made out
of little.
That if the Pay staff work as hard as they
talk, we won't have to wait long for our de-
ferred pay in Sydney.
That any museum would be glad to house a
specimen of the ship's pre-war butter.
That after 30 years at sea the Chief Steward
has met his Waterloo at the hands of the ship's
Q.M.
That if the Ship's Adjutant intends to stand
on the boat-deck and order men off the fore-
castle head, he'll need some voice pastilles.
That the fine young officers who had dinner
-?with wine?at the "Galle Face" Hotel,
Colombo, sobered up considerably when the
bill for �l5 was presented.
That when the High Anglican Padre gave
his views on Calcutta sweeps, and somebody
else gave his views on Padres, the reverend
gentleman must have wished he hadn't spoken
out of his turn.
That although very little marine life can be
discerned from above the surface of the
Indian Ocean, more than one octopus is cer-
tain to give them a hearty welcome on the
wharf in Sydney.
That if arrack could be procured in Aus-
tralia, it would have a big sale in the future.
That we outpaced several ships?but they
happened to be anchored.
That there is to be no more fumigating, as
the 90-cockroach-power Indian cigars have
destroyed every known germ.
That the baksheesh tea brought aboard at
Colombo, wasn't Lipton's best.
That there really was a lot of malaria
amongst the officers. It got bad in the rough
weather and abated only when the ship ceased
to roll.
That Mr. Smiles speaks French. That
Nurse Bindley heard him remark that it was
quite au fait to start shaving at 9 a.m., and
reach the breakfast table at 9.20.
That the Bridge Train reached from the
smoke room to the dining tables and back
again?from 1000 until ten minutes to twenty-
four.
That the man who rode the red bull through
Wagga managed to get his sea kit mixed up
with the electric fan on C Troop deck, while
the Omda's boots he intended taking home
were ruined.
That the Morvada is a fast boat. That
"Blue" wanted to get over the side to see
what it was fast to.
That despite the bathroom notice: "Ten
minutes allowed," it takes one bald-headed
sub. 20 minutes.
That the sentimental married sergeants held
a meeting and decided to dump overboard
their Cairo photographs.
That since his humiliating defeat, Trooper
Power has decided to abandon his long-
cherished resolve to adopt boxing as a pro-
fession.
That a few days later than the scheduled
time for sighting Australia there were many
anxious inquiries as to whether it was true
that the Ship's Captain has been prevailed
upon to use the military prismatic compass.
That when summoned before the Board
which enquired into the loss of hats, Peter
Wold declared that his hat was blown away
by a terrible blast from Joe Warn's double
bass.


Lieut.-Col. Mcintosh, 12th A.L.H.
Died of Wounds received south of Gaza, flpril 19th, 1917
WE watched his work, nor failed to understand
The heart that did not flinch when death crept near;
We followed him across the blazing sand.
And up the grassy foothills of Judea.
He led us through the dust of muffled night,
And sought us cover for the anxious day,
Nor did the passion of a doubtful fight
Disturb, or lead his tempered wits astray.
Into the choking ruck of strife he led
His squadrons, through a sheet of rifle fire
Which scarred the poppied slopes, the while it bled
The hearts of men full-flushed with savage ire.
And then he fell, face-down upon the earth.
And many a hand caressed him as he lay
Hearing the Turkish batt'ries crash mad mirth
Into the turmoil of our fatal day.
Yes, he is dead; and in the East he lies
Lonely, but not forgotten, 'neath the sand
Where God ordained to close his earnest eyes
And rest for evermore his guiding hand.
GERARDY,

MY DESIRE.
I WANT to bash a Gyppo,
He seldom hits you back;
I want to plant my horny fist
In something brown or black;
But every man within my reach
Is strong and rather white,
So I must keep myself in check
Because I cannot fight.
O! would I were in Egypt,
Where slender Gvppo's dwell?-
I've often heard a soldier say
The place resembled hell;
But when you've bashed a Gyppo,
And cinked his ugly face,
You've helped to swell the glory of
The great Australian race.
The great word "tallaheena"
Rings like a clarion call;
It promptly brings a Gyppo
Around your boots to crawl;
But somewhere in Australia
Where I may shortly be,
Life will be sad without a "Bong"
To take a punch from me.
"BLUE STRIPE/'
* * * *
The newly-appointed controller of assumed
names reported that during the run from
Suez to Colombo tbere was a brisk demand
for the resumption of baptismal names, while
another strong following decided on starting
the new life with a new name.
* * * *
"ONLOOKER" : The most enthusiastic
audience I have yet been among, is that which
watches the mess orderlies pilot the mungaree
down the steep wooden steps that lead to the
mess deck. An orderly has only to slip one
step and he is certain of some appreciation.
Should he fall down a couple, he evokes much
laughter and many shouts of encouragement.
One wet morning a man flew from top to
bottom, hitting the deck with a sickening
thud, almost losing his life. The audience
was stirred to a high pitch of enthusiasm.
Before we reach Australia, should an orderly
have the misfortune to slip and crack his
skull, the applause is sure to be deafening.
"INCUBATOR" : A sense of discrimination
and an eye for selection are two essential
factors in almost every walk of life; but cooks
are usually too impulsive to realize the full
value of either quality. Any man who was
unfortunate enough to witness our transport
cooks preparing scrambled eggs for a
thousand men will understand what I mean.
* * * *
While watching the sharks playing around
the ship in the Indian Ocean, our senior
mathematician made some lightning calcula-
tions, which led to this conclusion: In case
of a man falling overboard, it takes seven
minutes to launch a boat, which unfortunately
is six minutes and fifty-nine seconds too late.
* * * *
On this troopship there is an excellent
machine for slicing bacon. Handled with
care by an expert, it pares the salt pig into
transparent rashers, tempting enough to re-
store the lost appetite of a sea-sick Hebrew.
Whenever it is intended to grace the break-
fast menu with the word bacon, down in his
reeking den the butcher lovingly approaches
the bacon-slicer to deliver samples of his most
careful work.
After twenty minutes he pauses and lisps
respectfully, "Officers and passengers, 80." A
run of seven minutes at a faster pace, with
coarser results, and again he halts, sighing,
"W.O.'s, 30." Commencing with a more
marked turn of speed he pulls up after eight
minutes and gasps, "Sergeants, 90."


A moment's reflection, then he gets down
to it with all the speed he can summon. The
bacon leaves the knife in coarse, greasy junks.
Fifteen minutes of this and the machine stops
with a crash. "Other ranks, 800," snarls the
butcher.
* * * *
"BUNNY": The spicy breezes of Ceylon
annoyed the auburn-haired wife of an officer
by playing such wanton gambols with her chic
Japanese silk skirt, that a number of men on
the promenade deck almost blushed. But,
hubby, like the considerate man he was,
stripped himself of Sam Browne and gallantly
strapped the wayward petticoat two inches
on the safe side of decorum. We heaved a
sigh and went down to breakfast.
* * * *
"No 9" : Sausages were the favourite break-
fast dish at our table until Trooper Woolcott
discovered a dead bullock's eye embedded in
a conglomeration of stale bread and minced
meat. We completed the meal hour leaning
far over the lee-side bulwark.
* * * *
The sausage was a ship's one,
The outside was all skin;
The inside was a mystery ?
A bull named "Brindle Jim."
* * * *
AUSSIE: "DO yer belong to the army of
occupation, chum ?"
TOMMY: "DO I, hell; be I Flanders three
years Dinkum."
* * * *
"PINNACLE": If it takes half a day for
thirteen niggers to holystone half the prome-
nade deck with half a cocoanut, how long
would it take one of the cook's cockroaches
to climb the foremast, spell in the crow's nest
five minutes, crawl across the wireless-wire,
slide down the aftermast and return to his
home at potatoville on the poop deck?
* * * *
DICK: "Feeling sick, Sam?"
SAM (Cook's assistant, cracking eggs of
various ages into a pan) : "Ow'n th'ell can I
be sick if I'm doin' this job?"
BONDMAN.
Trooper Bondman's not a freeman,
He is doing time
For wandering away from camp ?
A most outrageous crime,
According to the army laws
By which we must abide?
When Bondman's had a day at large
He spends a month inside.
Trooper Bondman's rolling home
In close captivity;
Strolling round the troopship decks
Greeting you and me.
Some day up in Waterloo,
When you're on the spree,
You may greet him ?you will meet him ?
That is, if he's free.
"CLINKER."
HE * * *
"8.C.": The concluding remarks of a
heated nautical discussion above the pro-
pellers :
"Garn, you're one of those eighteen-footer
Sydney Harbour yachtsmen!"
"Oh, well, you're a Centennial Park lake
eighteen-incher!"
* * * *
"GODFREY GAUNT": On the notice board of
the Morvada's free library for saloon
passengers, the following was posted:
"Will the person who picked up 'Render
Unto Caesar' borrow his books from the
ship's library, and return the above to Major
The following day, beneath this there ap-
peared another notice: >
"Render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and unto the Major the things that
are his. For chapter and verse see the Padre."
* * * *
Overheard at the table in the saloon:
SMITH : "Wot'll yer do wen yer git back to
Aussie, Brown?"
BROWN : "Dunno, 'spose the old game."
SMITH : "Yer see, as we bin officers we
can't go back to tit-pullin'. I'm arskin' fer a
couple o' year at the Uni. so's I kin be a
bannister."


THE DRY SHIP.
I've often felt the fiery grip
Of alcoholic glee;
But I am on a beerless ship
That sails a cheerless sea.
I know that "Red-Heart" rum's the drink
That makes a sailor bold,
And I am half inclined to think
There's whisky in the hold.
One night I saw a jaunty man
Within a "Samuel Browne,"
Asprawl beneath the whirring fan
Trying to keep one down.
Oh, I am on a grogless ship!
But I have eyes to see
How some blokes feel the fiery grip
Of alcoholic glee.
"TELESCOPE."
"GODFREY GAUNT" : An
nth L. H. officer awoke
from a heavy afternoon
nap. His one-star tnnic
met his eye. "What!" he
spluttered fiercely, "who
the -!" Then he sub-
sided. "I imagined I was
a first loot," he murmured.
. . . Some men may recog-
nize the word.
"ISIDORE" : The loyal Australians serving
in the nth and 12th Light Horse Regiments,
suddenly developed a conscience, which took
the form of providing a voluntary Orderly
Trooper to ensure that the officers were
liberally fed, and to hear all their complaints.
Trooper Freeman, by virtue of his know-
ledge of the world and society, was the
chosen instrument for the promulgation of the
newly acquired ideals. From force of habit
he first "appeared" before Colonel Cameron.
The Colonel stated that he was fairly well
satisfied, but would like to see more corn-
round, to which he attributed the Aus-
tralian's marvellous digestions. Lieutenant
Joe Coleman next on the list, remarked that
things were not what they were, and that
he was forced to live entirely 011 pate de fois
gras. Major Costelloe opined that the ice-
cream was of such inferior quality that it
quite failed to cool his extremities while in
the Red Sea. Then Major Hyman voiced
the opinion that the whole show was a lurid
failure, and that when he was Governor of
Jerusalem, he . . . Trooper Freeman here
kindly, but firmly, asked the Major to observe
the present in its entirety, and let the past
look after itself. Mrs. Chisholm and Miss
Macphillamy, who rank with William P.
Hoover as the greatest rationers of the age,
said that they didn't want to hear the word
food ever mentioned again. Major Toomey,
who appeared to be running into a decline,
stated huskily that the complete lack of stimu-
lants would be the death of him. The
Orderly Trooper wrung his hand while a
silent tear of communal sympathy coursed
down his cheek. The �biquitous Major
Loynes considered the absence of 'isher
cigarettes a scarlet disgrace. Trooper Free-
man, mounting a chair, gradually cried the
Mess down to a semblance of order, and in
a nippy speech remarked he had not brought
a ledger with him, so that the complaints for
the day were unfortunately lost, but ?and
here it was noticed that his off-side breeches'
pocket had a bottle-shaped bulge?the welfare
of his officers had his every consideration.
In conclusion, he remarked that he would be
in attendance Bukra with his ledger, while
he confidentially urged his audience to bear
in mind that this here Book of Complaints
would be fitted with two quart-sized false
bottoms.

DISILLUSION.
Fast night they might have all been dead
Aboard this plunging ship. My head
Spun round and round for want of sleep.
The moon arose to light the deep
And I went down to bed.
In spite of roll and hiss and kick,
At length I dosed. There came the pick
Of "Light o' Loves." She beckoned me.
I took her on my bended knee
And kissed . . . Her lips were thick.


She scowled and slipped from off my knee?
Her eyes looked most reproachfully?
I felt I was a waster, churl;
Then on her lip I saw a curl.
A pointed beard adorned her chin,
She'd coal-black eyes with soot therein.
I wondered what came over me.
'Twas morning?that was plain to see . . .
Boy Abdul spoke seductively,
And all he said was "Tea, sair, Tea!"
"GODFREY GAUNT."
JOE: "Where you bin, Bill? I bin lookin'
all over the ship for you."
BILL: "Oh, I bin up on the sharp end
lookin' over the fence."
Though we are all greatly excited at the
prospect of being soon in Australia, we must
not forget to tender the cooks a humble note
of appreciation.
During our passage over tropical waters, to
most of us it seemed impossible that they
could work under such trying conditions, and
yet keep the food up to a standard which left
nothing to be desired.
We all ascribe our present great physical
condition to the fine work of our cooks; while
the bread turned out by the baker is more
than excellent ?the best we have tasted on
land or sea.
Q.: "What game does the Morvada best
remember?"
A.: "Pitch an' toss."
"GODFREY GAUNT": Three days out from
Ceylon a hard-working doctor felt that he was
being talked about. "My ears are burning,
sister," he said. "But them out," sniffed the
little sister, "they smell like an Indian
cheroot!"
BILL: "That mate of yours is a Socialist."
JIM : "Only since be embarked."
BILL : "What converted him ?"
JIM: "The first saloon dining table at meal
time."
* * * *
"PINNACLE": Even at sea, cockies never
lose their reputation for early rising. One
morning, at daybreak, a few country lads
were assembled on the fo'c'stle head watching
porpoises, and discussing conditions in Aus-
tralia. Meantime those responsible for the
ship's navigation were testing the stearing-
gear and compass. This operation necessitates
a slight alteration in the vessel's course, as
well as some zigzagging manoeuvres. Before
the transport had picked up her original
direction again, Sam Saltbush (who had been
suffering from Barcoo Rot since leaving Suez,
and whose first appearance it was on deck)
joined the party. The ship's antics having
been explained to him, he remarked: "Gar'n,
yer silly lot o' coots; what do you'se blokes
know about boats? You've only bin on two ?
the one yer com over on, and this one. The
old skipper has lost his bloomin' way!"


Sursum Corda!
WE surge along the troopship deck
And leave the blazing Orient.
For us no more the desert trek!
Good-bye to bivouac and tent!
The wilderness that smote our eyes
And caused our weary feet to ache.
Is fading in the twilight's guize
And fretting silent in our wake.
I he fight is won, so we must leave
Old comrades in their desert draves?
But who can look behind and grieve
While laughter rings across the waves?
We know that we have fought the fight
As fair and clean as fights may be.
So let us face the tranquil night.
For we are putting out to sea.
II
To-day there is no land in sight.
Dark seas are massing to attack;
The wind that squalls with fierce delight
Is driving down upon our track.
It calls to mind cold winter rains
That whipped the trembling olive trees;
Bogged limbers on the lead-swept plains,
Black mud above our horses'' knees.
To-night the sky is blotted out,
Dark clouds are racing from the north ?
On such a night, a squadron scout
From home has often ambled forth
To search the dark with aching eyes.
On hostile soil, where life was cheap
As you lay under sullen skies
Through heavy hours of broken sleep.
11l
A ou steeled yourself to cross the waste,
And dreamed, mayhap, of Paradise?
God grant that you may live to taste
The fruits of your great sacrifice,
For you have sheathed the hostile blade
To sail for home, where freedom dwells?
Yours is the name Australia made
Immortal at the Dardanelle c !
\ ours is the name that rings in France,
W hose sons and daughters reverence
Rude valour in the swift advance,
Grim fortitude in slow defence.
Aye! bitter fights, by comrades won,
Shed glory to be shared by you
\\ hose giant's work was nobly done,
Whose arms have greater work to do.
IV
Once more behold the morning dew
Sun-blazoned on the wooden cross-
Old firing lines once held by you
Are overblown with sand and dross.
But there are flowers and rare perfumes
In fields that hide the valiant dead,
And God with heavenly grace illumes
The promised land for which they bled.
Behold the crimson sheets of dust
That flame on high from east to west,
The sun that swings with fiery lust
Across the ragged mountain crest!
Grim scenes of other days remain
With'every deed emblazoned clear,
So you shall dream and fight again
Red battles fougbt in old Judea.
V
Look back, my friend, along the road
For which you fought, and which you won
Beneath a galling, crushing load,
Sore-smitten by the glaring sun,
And in the distance you will see
The poppied slopes, the summits high,
Like monuments of victory
Against the cloudless Syrian sky.
Now, look ahead, the sky is blue,
The slopes are green, the bush bird sings,
And there is love to welcome you,
Whom God has spared for greater things.
Behind you, on the trackless sea,
The bitter thought is dying fast.
Take courage, friends! Step firm, and see
The gold that glitters down the past.
GERARDY.


Concerning a Dump and Some Liquid Refreshment
HAVE you ever been side-tracked from
active service? By that, 1 mean have
you ever been thrown on the scrap-
heap? Most of you have seen a regimental
dump; and most men will agree that there is
nothing spectacular about them. Well, to
have been detailed for a job at a dump on the
eve of a big stunt, meant that you had been
side-tracked ?thrown on the scrap-heap. The
word dump was a death-sentence to almost
every man at whom it was directed. Yet,
there was an occasional one who regarded it
philosophically; a few, indeed, who accepted
it with beaming pleasure.
Seven days before the fall of Beersheba,
my troop-sergeant, book in hand, approached
me with a smile and said, "Broncho, you're
for the dump at Gamli." I didn't snarl,
neither did I smile. I took it philosophically.
The same day I rolled my swag and rode over
to report to the O.C. of my new home. Large
bodies of troops were trekking in a southerly
direction, preparatory to the big push which
commenced at Beersheba and culminated in
the establishment of a firing line from the
"Auja" to the "Jordan." The atmosphere
suggested an impending battle of a magnitude
much greater than any previous disturbance
in Palestine. Although an old soldier, I con-
fess I was not very enthusiastic at the pros-
pect of bloodshed. The romance of warfare
had burned itself out. leaving only cold ashes
on my soul.
In this state of mind, I welcomed the dump
as a sheltering stronghold?as a home. Since
then, there have been many bitter engage-
ments and a great deal of excitement, in all
of which I have shared from the shelter of a
dump, the home from which I was eventually
driven, to rejoin my regiment at Tripoli, after
the breaking up of that notorious Ludd strong-
hold, which had contained so many souvenirs
?treasures which strangely disappeared after
being investigated in force by their unfaithful
guardians. Yes, I've had some fine times 011
dumps!
Miles behind the firing-line there was
always a feeling of supreme security, know-
ing that your comrades were hard at it forcing
the enemy far northward. At Gamli, there
was posted every evening a formidable guard,
which, as soon as darkness had set in, would
mysteriously melt away. In our waking hours
we often amused ourselves prying into neatly
labelled cases, some of which had been
shattered during transit. Grimy hands were
thrust into any dark hole or crevice which
came under the notice of their owners. Boxes
were cautiously prised open, to be as noise-
lessly closed when the absence of liquid
refreshment was confirmed. But we were not
always disappointed; and it is little wonder
that our spasmodic outbursts of jubilation
sometimes evoked surprise. At times we dis-
covered the reserve stock of a liquidated
officers' mess. Perhaps it yielded vermouth,
port wine, or best of all, whisky.
After we had absorbed almost every drop
of fiery moisture we knew to be concealed in
the dump, our attention naturally drifted
afield, to eventually concentrate on a N. and
A. Canteen, situated some 500 yards distant,
beside the railway line. Two strands of
barbed wire girded the large E.P. tent, out-
side of which were stacked many cases of
Bass ale and Scotch whisky. For days we
feasted our eyes on this monument of concen-
trated jollity; at nights we dreamed and
schemed on how we might gain possession of
some.
We commenced by parading each day to the
O.C. for chits, which, with the necessary cash,
enabled us to purchase an occasional case.
Although O.C.'s are very reluctant about
issuing chits, we managed to spend all our
money in less than a week. Whenever our
master refused to sign his name to one, our
most expert penman had to do it for him.


However, we soon discovered that carry-
alcohol away unchallenged at night was much
easier and less ceremonious than buying it.
There was a total absence of red tape; 110
chits were required, and signatures were no
longer regarded with scowling suspicion.
After a whole week of wild, free nights, it
was whispered to us that the O.C. was on our
track; that he wanted to know the meaning
of all the empty bottles; to find out who was
getting the beer and whisky; from whom, and
with whose authority.
He began by applying to the canteen for all
chits endorsed by his signature, but discovered
that nothing of a alcoholic nature had left
there for a week. He at once enlightened the
manager, inspiring him so much, that he (the
manager) ran to the rear of the E.P. tent and
gazed with alarm on his depleted stocks.
Next day we had occasion to become sus-
picious, and our suspicions were soon con-
firmed by the appearance of an Algerian guard.
We knew that Algerians were of little use in
the firing-line, but we were well aware that
they were unsurpassed as guardians of mili-
tary property in well-ordered camps. Outside
the danger-zone they were known to shoot on
sight.
But there was one among us, a Tommy, who
had seen much service 011 dumps in France,
where he had met Algerian sentries by the
battalion. This Tommy had acquired a slight
knowledge of the French language; he also
knew that the Algerian's greatest weakness is
French, because all of them who speak it
fluently have the best jobs; naturally there
are many students.
The day the guard arrived, we suffered un-
told agonies of thirst, and hoarsely cursed the
relentless November heat.
"We must get some whisky to-night," said
our greatest martyr, "and with the assistance
of that Tommy we shall. He can talk French
to the sentry on the northern end of the beat,
while we attack the south, where the juice is
stacked."
After tea we set out in force.
"Bon soir!" It sounded through the dark-
ness with a distinct cockney accent. "Bon
soir!" came an alert, though faint reply from
the vicinity of the canteen.
We heard the Tommy's footsteps as he
cautiously approached the sentry. There en-
sued a jabbering discussion, the nature of
which we did not attempt to construe.
The coast was clear, so we all of us crept
towards the barbed wire fencing the southern
end. Two of our most notorious dare-devils
crawled into the enclosure and approached a
stack of cases, beside a bell tent, which had
been erected for the guard during the day.
A light shone through the canvas, while the
sound of guardsmen's voices was distinctly
audible. Without hesitation our men moved
up to the cases. Each seizing one, they crept
back. All was in harmony until one man
slipped and fell, his load clattering 011 the
ground before him. But he was desperate.
Rising swiftly he picked up the case and both
rushed headlong towards us, each retaining a
fierce grip on his burden. The sentry turned
and opened fire; but, after dragging our
mates clear, we all sped along the railway line,
pulling up when we could no longer hear the
shouts of the alarmed guard.
* * * *
A full moon rose over the Judean hills,
while down in the bed of the Wadi Ghuzze,
approximately one mile from the canteen, we
crowded round two neat little cases.
"We were lucky to get whisky," said one
eager voice.
"Cripes, we were,"- answered another, "two
cases of the best. Hand me that old bayonet,
and get the corkscrew out."
I heard the rent of splintering wood and
knew that a lid was being forced open.
Suddenly the noise ceased; then the silence
was broken by a deep guttural curse.
"Well, I'm hanged; two cases of Nestle's
milk!"
"BRONCHO."

"A.W.1.": A prominent orator, one of the
Round Dozen, made a happy forecast two
days before the proclamation of peace by re-
marking that the really Big Heads must know
that Peace was a certainty, for hadn't they
called the saddles in? "Yes, Doug, nothing-
could be more conclusive from a saddle-
wearied Light Horseman's point of view."

"D.W.H.": Following our unexpected de-
parture for Aussie, the Druid with the longest
whiskers becomes reminiscent. He recalls that
one of the now Senior Lions tossed up with
his wife as to whether he or the eligible son
should enlist; but it is regretted his wife used
a double-header.

"HURRY ALONG": The Turk's blind faith as
to those raw spirits?mistika, arrack and
zabib ?killing every kind of germ was taken
too literally by a sergeant while in disease-
ridden Damascus. He was seeing blue
pointers at their best when the odor from a
simmering sheep's-head broth reminded him
of his famished condition. He stalked that
pot as only an astute, long-service sergeant
could; but when the lid was finally prised up
there appeared a bleached skull uncannily
gyrating in the bubbling moisture. To combat
the shock, the sergeant had to be sent back to
the scenes of his childhood in Australia, where
he has since led a blue-ribboned blameless life
"BON": At the Moascar Wet Canteen, just
prior to our embarkation, a Billjim, answering
to the name of "Blue" Dwyer, was approached
by a would-be "confidence" trickster. The
man of confidences smilingly confided that he
knew "Blue," who agreed that they had met
before, and wanted to know in which way he
could oblige his one-time acquaintance. The
trickster said he would like half of his friend
Dwyer's beer, to which "Blue" replied, "Half
this pint is for my pet pelican, and the other
half is for the goat?l'm the goat."

When "Squatter" Wilson and his mate

rid of his soup at a gulp, fish was brought

peered closely at the dainty little fragment.
"Here, Clifford," he growled, tipping it on to
his mate's plate, "one of us'll have a feed."

"PORKY" : The craving to explore the by-
ways of any town passed through or captured,
amounted to a sacred yet dominating passion
with MacGregor. At El Arish he was present
at two native weddings in one night?a
previously unheard of intrusion. In spite of
the fierce jealousy of the hired marital dancers,
MacGregor introduced a greatly improved
can-can, and at the second feast he held a


large section of Bedouins enthralled with
various conjuring tricks. Rumor has it that
the only known diversion of the country in
which Mac had never "starred" was a native
funeral; it being impossible for him to be the
corpse. Beersheba, though, provided the
really great adventure. His regiment had
hardly entered the town, when MacGregor,
unaccompanied, was delving through the
shattered ruins, ever faithful in his quest
towards the unknown. He found his way to
the German Headquarters, where a lavish
meal had been prepared, but left untasted in
the general precipitate retreat. Mac ate the
whole course, and was just wiping the crumbs
from his side-whiskers, when eight Turks rose
around him like phantoms. From their
hiding-places the Turks had watched Mac-
Gregor's entry, and his greatly relished meal,
on the completion of which they had suddenly
appeared as if governed by the laws of melo-
drama. The curtain descends here, as it is the
versatile MacGregor's intention to dramatize
the incident later.
"REX": One night at Damascus, a Bill jim,
who was doing some scouting in the vicinity
of another regiment's horse-lines to try and
replace his recent loss of a head-stall, saw
what appeared to be a strayed horse lying
down asleep. After carefully stalking the
unconscious prad, he rushed in and secured
the animal by the head. The horse was asleep
alright; had been for a week past.
"WALL": An orderly-room request: ?"Re-
port must be rendered of those who have
money to change." I could render a very
decent report of those who would like some
money for a change.

"GODFREY GAUNT" : We've all seen the lions
011 the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge at Cairo. That's

roar!" flashed back the Gyppo.

Although he knows a lot about ships, Major
Southernman was awfully sick. "What
would you say," remarked the purser, "if the
weather was really rough ? Why, we were
hove to for thirty-six hours in the Bay of Bis-
cay, coming out." "Wonder you wern't hove
to all the way," growled the Major.

"SANDY GLOAM" : Tel-el-Fara, 011 the
Waddy Ghuzze, was always an important
Desert Column Centre. The thousands of
animals in the vicinity powdered the loamy
soil to the finest dust, which was swirled into
the air by the unceasing winds. During one
raging duststorm, a certain trooper was repri-
manded by his troop officer for lack of energy
in respect to his grooming. The trooper
groomed furiously for ten minutes, which re-
sulted in the horse's coat being entirely
obscured by a thick layer of dust. After
realizing the futility of beating out further
dust, this trooper thought he would help in
another and more decorative manner. With
his forefinger he carefully traced the name
"Dick Barnes" on one of the prad's flanks, and
1 ith A.L.H. on the other. The troop officer,
coming up immediately afterwards, without
noting the recent artistic addition, said,
"There you are, you see what a little judicious
application will do."


"SHRAPLIN" : Signaller O'Reilly unex-
pectedly found himself up before his C.0.,
charged with being absent while on duty as a
horse-picket. The signaller, who had been
away "tossing the pennies," had decided on
yet another game of chance. He stated that
he was absent on two occasions, but only to
inquire the time from the picket-corporal.
The latter, who fortunately happened to be a
signaller also, was called in and asked what
time O'Reilly had made his enquiries. The
corporal, looking towards O'Reilly, who was
nervously drumming his fingers against his
knees, saw that the accused was sending a
message to him in Morse code. "Yes," said
the corporal, intent on gaining time while
reading the urgent message, "Signaller
O'Reilly called in to inquire the time from me
at ten minutes past nine, and then again at
er twenty minutes past ten." The times
coincided exactly with those given by
O'Reilly so the case was dismissed. Signallers
do occasionally come into their own.
Our Sojourn in the Lebanon
WHEN hostilities ceased with Turkey, the
Australian Mounted Division was
within a few miles of Homs, an im-
portant railway centre in the fertile valley of
the Orontes. We were hurrying towards
Aleppo with the object of driving in our
finishing blow on the enemy. But we pro-
ceeded no further northward from Homs,
where we camped a few days before trekking
towards Tripoli, a picturesque old seaport
town at the foot of Mount Lebanon.
Our journey from Homs was uneventful
and pleasant. After the restless days and
nights of campaigning we enjoyed the unique
experience of travelling at ease over hills and
along valleys, assimilating our fill of the fine
scenery and pure mountain air of the
Lebanons- ?the tall mountains on our left-?-
highest many of us have seen. They entirely
dominated the narrow strip of coastland along
which we travelled to our new camping
ground, situated on the Tripoli-Zagarta road.
Passing from the treeless coastal lowlands,
we turned in eastward through dense forests
of olive, which clothe every slope in a seem-
ingly endless succession of undulating waves,
rising ever upwards, to disappear in the haze
which veils the lofty peaks more than 9,000
feet above sea-level.
To us, the whole was a transformation
from the commonplace to the majestic. Here
was scenery such as we had never previously
beheld. Syrians welcomed us to their hearths
and homes, sharing with us whatever rude and
simple pleasures they could afiford. Though
many of them were in rags, it was readily ob-
served that the women were of a type most
beautiful, and the men a healthy, virile race.
The red-tiled roofs of villages animated to
a pleasing degree the olive-clad slopes which
everywhere rose terrace above terrace towards
the glorious summits.
At length, snow fell and draped the upper-
world in shawls of white, increasing the
beauty so much that the spirit of the Lebanon
gripped us heart and soul. Billjim at once be-
came popular and in great demand by the
surrounding villagers. Touring parties were
organized, and trips taken to outlying parts,
which included historical places such as Baal-
back, nestling among hills on the Anti-
Lebanon side of the range.
Waterfall near Bercherri


. *S�* "*
Snow continued to fall, eventually blocking
up the mountain passes and preventing us
from crossing over the summit; but parties
continued to visit the Cedars, the road to
which leads through the hospitable mountain-
town of Bercherri, where a number of Ameri-
cans have taken up their abode.
The journey from Tripoli to Bercherri is
one worth while. The white highway winds
upward through an earthly paradise threaded
with laughing streams. On every side there
are red-roofed villages, some of which
veritably cling to the wooded hillsides. A
welcome was always extended by the inhabi-
tants, many of whom spoke excellent English
The following are a Billjim's impressions
concerning Bercherri, written after a visit to
the Cedars?
"Mists floated along the gorge below us,
and soon we attained a summit overlooking a
deep rift in the mountains of Lebanon. Snow,
which had lain for weeks, was frozen hard on
the surface. Water oozed from crevices in
the rocks. There remained only an isolated
clump of the great Solomon cedars, of whose
hardihood much has been written since
Abraham's day.
"The veil of fog slowly lifted. Villages,
which harboured the children of the mount-
ains, were tucked away like birds' nests in
every sheltered crevice. A thin waterfall was
suspended in the sheer face of the precipice
opposite. The only apparent refinement in a
world of rudeness was on the surface of the
mountains, whose steep slopes had been
terraced for purposes of cultivation. Though
it might overlook a fall of thousands of feet,
not a single narrow ledge accessible to the
nimble-footed Lebanese is left uncultivated.
"The metal road from the coast, crossing
the gullies by stone bridges of Gothic design,
rounding the headlands and zigzagging up
the face of the hills, lay in a thin line below,
as though some giant had cast down a long,
white tape.
"Mules, which we rode because they are
good mountain climbers, scrambled down a
goat track which led us into the town of
Bercherri. Incidentally it took us back three
centuries of time. The Lebanons in this part
are the retreat of what remains from the age
before machinery was brought into popular
use. Everything here seems immune from
change. Man has not harnessed nature ; he
wins sustenance by turning the soil with a
quaint wooden plough drawn by oxen. He
sows the grain broadcast by hand. His own
miller, baker, and dairyman, his wife spins
cloth for the family on a hand spindle. Wine,
the popular beverage, is brewed and stored in
every house.
"The populace has absorbed something of
the ruggedness of the mountains. They are
but half tamed. We were their guests for two
days and will always remember the warmth
of their hospitality. Their offer of friend-
ship was frank and spontaneous. Meals of
potatoes and herbs; strange, but savoury
dishes; barley bread, white cheese, fig cakes
and wine were placed before us.

EIEENZO for ASTEIMft
To be candid, there is no definitely-known cure for asthma. The most that can honestly be promised is
something that will facilitate breathing and afford relief from the distressing paroxysms which, if unchecked,
so completely exhaust the patient from time to time. Opiates, though often used, ultimately do more harm
than good, as the dose has to be continually increased, till, sooner or later, the opium habit ?a worse
affliction than asthma itself?is often created.
Most gratifying relief from asthma may be obtained from the use of Heenzo (registered name for Hean's
Essence), which has the added advantage of exercising no ill after-effects. That is much to be thankful for.
LIEUTENANT A. McASKILL, late 3rd Battalion, A.l.F. (an original Anzac),
of 21 Ourimbah Road, Mosman, says : "When on active service I contracted what,
1 am sure, is one of the most distressing complaints?Asthma, with which 1 was
invalided home. Determined, if possible, to cure myself, I tried all sorts of
medicines, both prescribed and patent; but found nothing to equal Heenzo. I feel
better since commencing to use Heenzo, which practically cured me, and I would
strongly recommend its use to any one suffering from chest complaints. I find
Heenzo my most faithful friend."
Hundreds of other letters tell of the benefit derived from the use of Heenzo.
COSTS 21- SAVES POUNDS.
Each bottle of Heenzo when diluted and sweetened as per easy directions printed on the label produces a
family supply of superior quality mixture for Asthma, Bronchitis, Colds, Influenza, Catarrh, and other chest
and throat troubles. A like quantity of ready-made remedies would cost anything from 12/- to a couple of
pounds, according to quality. Heenzo is best quality.

v.;:
"At night, despite the snow outside, each
man slept warmly on a mattress, wrapped in
a huge, hand-made quilt. The mules were
stabled with the domestic animals 011 the floor
below.
"Next morning we heard a volley of rifle
fire down the narrow cobblestone street. The
male population had formed into a procession.
Every man was armed with something; some
with modern automatic revolvers, others with
rifles left behind during the hasty retreat of
the Turkish garrison. They had an abundant
supply of ammunition, and were firing into
the air. It was one of their religious holidays.
"We were invited to join in, and given no
opportunity of a refusal. A halt was called
at the sanctuary of the Deputy-Governor of the
Lebanons. From the stone steps he addressed
his demonstrative subjects; but to us his
oration was Arabic. The occasional mention
of Australia was greeted with characteristic
applause from the rabble, while more volleys
were fired overhead.
"Wine, cigarettes and much flattery were
pressed upon us after we'd been decoyed into
the Government offices, whose ceilings bore
the marks of previous bursts of applause from
excited citizens.
"For two days we not only partook of the
hospitality of Bercherri, but consumed with
our food enough olive oil to keep our
machinery lubricated for many months."
Throughout the cold winter months rain
fell, sometimes with a persistency that sug-
gested grey misery. But there were many
days of mellow sunshine ?days which broke
over the green earth like smiles after tears.
The Light Horse camps were continually
besieged by the poorer natives, most of whom
sought food and employment, so we had 110
dearth of assistance to tide us over the wet,
muddy season. The keen air of the Lebanon
winter necessitated a good deal of exercise to
ensure a healthy circulation, consequently
sports of every variety were popular. The
football competitions were responsible for
many close finishes and a good deal of excite-
ment. Horse-racing also claimed the usual
amount of attention, and helped to keep us
occupied during the months of waiting for
official tidings concerning our departure for
home.
At length a start was made to classify the
horses, which gradually disappeared, to be
absorbed by Imperial mounted units. The
old and broken walers, alas, were led away
and shot. They had served their purpose in
the great war.
One by one the units embarked at Tripoli to
sail for Egypt. Many tears were shed by
Syrian women and children who had been so
chivalrously treated by Billjim, whose warm
heart they had studied, to understand so well
-?Billjim whom many had learned to love.
One unit, the 12th A.L.H., received what
horses remained and with them trekked to Bey-
rout. A large number of the local inhabitants
of Tripoli followed the column for miles,
many weeping distressfully. This ride en-
abled the men of this fortunate unit to see
some of the finest and most beautiful country
in that district. After a brief stay in Syria's
chief seaport, during which time they were
right-royally treated, the last of the Aus-
tralians embarked on the Ellinga and left the
Lebanon. Many tears were shed.

The O.C. Troops
IN the whole of the 4th Eighty Horse
Brigade is there a man who doesn't know,
at all events by sight, Lieut.-Colonel
Donald Cameron, D.5.0.? The 12th Regi-
ment swears by him, and all othei units 111 the
Brigade, have, to put it in their own expres-
sive way, "a lot of time for him.
When General Grant gave up his Brigade
and sailed for Australia, he said in his vale-
dictory remarks that he regarded Col. Cameron
absolutely as his right-hand man.
We can all remember him on the tall bay
horse, riding at the head of his Regiment,
scouting up almost with the screen, sizing up
the situation at a glance, making his dis-
positions, and, best of all, from the tioopeis
point of view, sticking to his orders once he
gave them.
Tall, lean, a typical cornstalk ?this was not
his first campaign. Alongside the D.S.O.
with a bar are the South African ribbons;
King's and Queen's, both. He served through
the South African War, first as a trooper,
finally as an officer; so he is fully aware of all
the vexatious things that cross a trooper s
path.
But it is of this last war and especially
about the 4th Brigade we want him to talk;
not an easy matter, for he is somewhat dour
and cautious. But approach him about his
men! Then his face lights up, and the veil is
lifted.
"General Sir Henry Hodgson, in his last
letter to me before we sailed, stated that
while he had the Australian Division he never
worried about his front line. He knew it was
all right, and that his Australian commanders
and men knew their jobs thoroughly.
"I came away with the 12th Regiment in
June, 1915. I had C Squadron then, and of
course still have a soft spot for them. But
they are all splendid, 4th, nth, 12th, and Gun
Squadron.
"When I was in Cairo, just before we sailed,
I saw Lambert, the artist, engaged on his great
painting, 'The Light Horse at Beersheba.'
I told Lambert, even if it took him five years,
to work on and show us to the public. I don t
think any man can paint a horse like Lambert.
People will open their eyes when they see this
picture.
"Our Brigade had rotten luck for a start.
Split up on Gallipoli, it was early in 1917
before we were reformed. But individually by
units, I think we have seen as much fighting
as any of the others, and have as much to our
credit.
"I don't think we were properly recognized
as a Brigade until Beersheba. Of course we
were blooded long before that. The second
Gaza show on the 19th April, 1917. left us
almost decimated. Our casualties for that
operation were 5� P er cent, of the officers and
30 per cent, of the men actually fighting in the
line. That does not include the number of
men who, absolutely worn out by the strain
and rack of the preliminary moves, previous
to the 19th, broke down after the Gaza battle,
and had to be evacuated to hospital.
"I think the most spectacular engagement
in which the Brigade fought was the capture
of Beersheba. For that, the Brigade com-
mander, General Grant, was decorated on the
actual scene by the C. in C.. General Allenby.
This is a distinction, so far as I am aware,
which did not occur to anyone else during the
history of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.
"The most momentous task the Brigade
was ever set, was to operate across the Jordan
at Jisr-ed-Damieh. We had to stand the
brunt of the attack of treble our number, and
if the enemy had achieved his object and got
command of the Es Salt Road, the whole of
the Australian Division would have been
surrounded and probably captured. It was a
pretty severe go, but the men stuck to it and
pulled the Brigade through.
"I think I was more jumpy afterwards,
when we were in Musellabeh, than I have ev ei
been before or since. If the Turks had come
at us there in any sort of force at all, they
must have broken through. We were holding
much too wide a front. As it was, they did
break through later on, but the Ist Brigade
was able to push them back.
"The days in the Jordan Valley were the
most severe the Brigade has ever had. _ The
men were worn out and had not the vitality
to keep off malaria and withstand that awful
heat. I don't think there is any place 011 earth
nearer to Hell.
"I always advocated the use of Australians
as cavalry. It is positively fatal to employ


' '*'' ' Sat g ' ><Sy^ 4


Light Horsemen as dismounted troops. To
begin with, in dismounting them you lose at
least 25 per cent, of your effective fighting
strength; and then, as a rule, the Australian
horseman is a very poor footman. He doesn't
get enough practice on his feet and can't stand
any heavy marching. Then, again, dis-
mounted work is usually very severe, with
long distances to cover quickly, so the men are
exhausted when they attain their objective.
"Hotchkiss guns were a tremendous asset to
us in this war. They increased our fighting
strength by 40 per cent. Our Brigade Hotch-
kiss gunners have always done their job splen-
didly.
"My first experience of General Allenby
was in South Africa. He was then a Major
in the Enniskillen Dragoons. Later on he
had command of a column. He is the greatest
General with whom I have ever been
associated.
"Prior to the Damascus operations all
Regimental commanders attended Divisional
Headquarters, where General Allenby person-
ally told us what he wanted done. It was a
great thing to get these instructions direct
from the C. in C.
"Am I going to soldier any more? .Not if
I know it. There is one thing that lam going
to do, and that is join the Australian Army
Reserve. I hope everybody in the Brigade
will do likewise. We must keep the name of
the old Regiments going. Just think of the
pleasure of all getting together for four or
five days and renewing our memories of
Egypt, Sinai and Palestine."
The Chief Officer's Remarks
THE Morvada was launched in September,
1914. Like all the Company's M. boats,
it was the intention to use her for carry-
ing mails and passengers between India and
England. I didn't join her until February,
1917; but I've been 12 years with the B. I.
Company, and hope to finish my time at sea
with them.
Since we started carrying troops we've
mostly carried Americans, Territorials and
Australians. The best lot of troops? Well,
with all deference to Australia, I must give
the palm to Americans; they were splendid,
while their discipline at sea was perfect. In
April, 1918, we brought 1,350 men from New
York. Crowded? Oh, yes, pretty well; but
they put up with everything. All they were
looking for was a slap at the Hun.
Most of the time since the war began we've
travelled in convoy. I can't remember how
many trips we've made, but I think there was
only one on which we were not attacked. Our
narrowest escape was in April, 1917. We
were attacked simultaneously from port to
starboard. I put the port engine hard astern,
and swung the old boat round on her heel.
The torpedo from port passed just astern,
but the propeller blade clipped off its head?
a pretty close go. After we'd hit the torpedo
it floated end up, so the other boats in the con-
voy, thinking it was a periscope, banged off
at it. One idiot fired shrapnel, and some of
his pellets smashed our starboard ports.
The destroyer in charge signalled us "Well
done, Morvada, you've cut the war-head off
the torpedo, and we have it on board now."
It was just as well the Boche didn't get us that
time. We were carrying very valuable mails,
specie, a Cabinet Minister, and a couple of
King's Messengers.
Yes, I shall be glad to get back to ordinary
work again. No matter how good troops are,
you can't keep a ship clean, and there's just
about double the work.
I've been 23 years at sea, having served the
usual time in sail?a barque called the Doris.
I celebrated my fifteenth birthday in her at
Fremantle, W.A.
No, I've never been shipwrecked, nor have
I been in an accident?just wait till I touch
wood. I served my usual time on the west
coast of South America, the best, school going
for a sailor.
After a few years running to India, you
know these seas as though they were a rail-
way time-table. The S.W. monsoon blows
regularly from June to September. We're
pretty lucky this trip. The sea is fairly rough,
but we have it well astern so the boat does not


JIL
notice it. No, the monsoons are not the same
as the trade winds. They start from the S.E.,
then you have a spell in the Doldrums, and
subsequently get the N.E. trade. You very
seldom get bad weather in the trades; but you
can get all you want from the monsoon, which
can easily work up to a cyclone. The best
day's work the old boat has done is about 350
knots.
We usually carry about 80 or 90 first-class
passengers and their baggage. The best
passengers I've ever seen carried were Indians
from Coquinado, going to work in Burma.
Their baggage consisted of three cocoanuts,
and they never moved from the spot 011 which
they were told to sit.
Now that submarines have ceased to in-
trude, there is little or no excitement. In the
bad old days the captain never left the bridge
day or night, except when he had occasion to
visit the chart room.
Some of the cadets we're now carrying
have had their share of fun during the war.
One was torpedoed twice, another once. The
former was a prisoner for two years in Ger-
many, from where he eventually escaped
dressed as a girl.
Native crew? Oh, they're all right, as long
as there's white officers to keep them in hand.
When the destroyers had occasion to drop
depth bombs, the concussion in the engine-
room would knock you ofif your feet. You
couldn't tell whether you were torpedoed or
not. Those chaps would never take their eyes
ofif the engineers, that's all that kept them
from stampeding.
Who are the most seasick troops ? I think
you Australians take the cake there. Whether
its because most of you come from the bush,
or whatever it is, I don't know. Anyhow, you
do get sick.

Meditation
WHEN the long, hot ride is over,
And the piquet is put out,
And we listen to the jackal's mournful cry;
There's a dainty little woman,
Whom I often dream about,
Underneath the silver stars of Sinai.
Laughing eyes and sun-kissed tresses,
Dainty mouth I've often kissed,
Wee, soft fingers which have smoothed my ruffled hair
Lilting notes of girlish laughter,
And a loving girlish kiss ?
Oh, they keep my heart from sinking to despair
All night long of her I'm dreaming,
And at times I breathe a prayer
To the God Who rules our destiny above,
fust to beg that out of kindness
He will transfer all the care
He bestows on worthless me, to her I love.
E.W.H.


Contrast
WHEN we steamed out of Lemnos heavy
clouds of nimbus black foretold of
dirty weather. In a few hours our
craft had pushed her nose into the breast of a
strong gale, and during the night desultory
showers of rain made the fo'c'stle head an un-
inviting "possie." But we must stick to it.
May as well attempt to stem the seas that
broke across our main deck, as try and avert
the powers which decreed that a "submarine
guard" should remain on the fo'c'stle head, in
spite of anything the barometer might register.
I glanced at the machine gun near by, and
almost envied it in its adequate covering of
oiled canvas. . . .
But we are at Alexandria now. The ship
bumps the wharf, and then conies to rest.
Noisily we elbow each other down the sway-
ing gangway, and make off to the railway
station. . . .
We are seated in the Cairo-bound train. In
one carriage they are singing "Are we down-
hearted." Oh, the irony of it! I reach for my
emergency ration- ?bag of bully beef and bis-
cuits?and my mate and I hurriedly consume
our first Xmas dinner in Egypt, 1915
We are in a world of soft, white sand. The
fall of the horses' hoofs is scarcely audible.
Breaking the first damp crust laid by the night-
dew, they leave their trails, stretching back
into the mist. In the dew-spangled palms near
by, a lone kestrel calls plaintively to his mate;
otherwise the stillness of "morning in the
desert" is profound.
At the foot of an immense dune, the tiny
patrol dismounts and climbs slowly to its sum-
mit, attaining which we settle ourselves to
wait until the convincing light of advanced
dawn throws into bold relief the immediate
and intermediate environs. With the advent
of the sun I prepared the helio and flashed
an "all clear" to the home station. With their
flickering acknowledgment our morning's
work terminated.
In long, deep strides we descended, and
mounting our horses, trotted back along the
ten miles to camp, where we had our first
Xmas dinner in Sinia, 1916.
The hills and valleys of soft, white sand
have vanished, and ragged, bold bluffs of lime-
stone rear themselves in their stead. The
stately palm is replaced by the unimposing
olive; down its aged trunk the rain pours in
tiny rivulets. The distant peaks of Samwil
and Fokker are enveloped in a dense fog; a
stiff nor'-westerly wind threatens to demolish
my inadequate shelter of bivvy sheets and
poles.
For a space the rain ceases, and welcome
patches of sunlight appear on the slopes;
hurriedly we spread our blankets to dry.
From our jealously-guarded store of gifts,
tins of fruit and milk, and jam and puddings,
also packets of biscuits and cake are trans-
ferred to an improvised table of flat stones.
In the centre are two bottles of wine, fruits
of a four-mile walk to a neighbouring village.
When everything is in readiness the boys eat
themselves and I prepare to take their photo-
graphs. The lens is focussed, click, I lift the
autographic window at the back of the camera
and write, "Christmas dinner in the hills,
Palestine, 1917."
Everywhere are long lines of white tents,
and outside of the cook-houses long lines of
waiting men. Perspiring cooks and offsiders
dissolve themselves from the steam and smoke
of ovens and fires. An orderly-sergeant
announces that dinner is ready. Noisily we
troop in to tables whereon pyramids of cakes,
sweets and oranges rear themselves from a
haphazard scattering of cigars, cigarettes and
nuts. There is a temporary lull in the feast,
whilst the Commandant of Moascar makes a
short address. The concluding phrases of the
story might be told by an oft repeated toast
that punctuates the clattering din of knives
and forks.
Rising from the table I saunter back to my
tent. Meantime the local mail has arrived ; a
letter awaits me. As I tear it open a tiny
card flutters to the ground. I pick it up and
read, "Christmas Greetings, Egypt, 1918."
E.W.H.


The Cellars of Richon
WHILE the 4th Light Llorse Brigade, dis-
mounted, were fighting with the In-
fantry in the Judean hills, west of
Jerusalem, in December, 1917, the horse-
holders were trying to keep themselves and
their horses afloat near Ramleh. Every few
days, for reasons too remote to be classified,
camp would be shifted, which meant
traversing valleys changed by the floods into
vast seas, only to settle down again in another
bottomless bog. The horses ate their rugs in
lieu of the rations the transport failed to bring
up, while we shivered in our floating homes,
and cursed the A.S.C. for sending a con-
tinuous supply of frozen rabbits, when enough
wood for boiling even a quart was unpro-
curable.
? After being drenched to the skin for eleven
successive days, a conference was held to
choose a man of strategy to gain entrance into
Richon?the stronghold where the Provost
Corps was billited for the winter rains?and
secure some of its world-renowned wines, etc.
The job fell to Snooker, who started off at
once on his chestnut for this out-of-bounds
fortress. While taking observations just out-
side Richon, a Staff Officer came along; so, S.,
as we shall call him, fell in about thirty yards
behind in imitation of a mounted orderly,
which ruse secured his admission into the
heart of the town.
Enquiries at the huge distillery?reputed to
be the second largest in the world?led to S.
being directed through an obscure part of the
town to the Carmel Co.'s cellars, which he
found eventually by instinct rather than
organized search. A sergeant-major of the
Anzac Engineers was just entering with some
demijohns, so S. modestly decided to pass
himself off as the sergeant-major's shadow.
On ascending the steps to the office a short,
stout staff major of the Ist Brigade pulled
them up to inquire if they had authentic
passes and orders, but the sergeant-major's
papers being all in order, that danger was
successfully passed. When Snooker's turn
came, the old Jew in charge raised both his
hands and voice in protest of the worthless-
ness of Snooker's order, without an orderly-
room stamp on it. Now, this order, well
faked by the best pen-man available, was
signed with a name suggestive of blue blood,
gout and other spacious well-filled cellars;
but the old Jew was not of a romantic strain,
and had probably never read Charles Garvice.
After a protracted, but fruitless argument, S.
decided to try another line. He approached
the elder of two Tommy subalterns, both of
whom were scanning a list near by. In a
confidential way he explained that his was a
detached Light Horse Flying Squadron, ready
at twenty minutes notice to leave for the
mountains to re-inforce any portion of the
Division in difficulties, and that under the
circumstances it was absolutely impossible for
them to carry about an orderly room with all
its gear?hence the impossibility of having an
orderly room stamp on the order. The sub-
altern, after a glance at the aristocratic signa-
ture of Major Montmorency turned to the
ancient Hebrew and, in a rich Oxford drawl,
informed him that is was "Quite all right.
Yes, quite all right." After a time the Jew
was seemingly convinced; but once the officers
had left the room he turned a baleful eye on
Snooker, and informed him that a stamp, not
a verbal recommendation, passed with the
Provost Captain, who controlled all military
supplies.
S. felt himself slipping twice for every step
gained, but marshalled his resources for a
final throw, not relying on a friend this time,
but taking a chance at the Provost Captain's
expense. Remembering the latter's name, he
smilingly asked whether Isaacstein knew Pro-
vost Captain .
The Jew knew him only too well it seemed,
to the detriment of his business. "Well," said


Snooker, "the Captain is the brother-in-law
of my aunt's sister." Such a close and be-
wildering relationship completely subjugated
the Jew, who not only took down S.'s order,
but led him to the cellars to test various grades
of wines and spirits. Snooker sampled four-
teen grades before he remembered that a clear
head was necessary to get out of Richon, and
find his way five miles through the darkness
to camp; but, with the help of his old four-
legged campaigner, he managed to struggle
through and spend a truly joyous evening at
the Old Bog Hole.
Next morning the horse-piquet, which com-
prised half the troop's strength, were on the
mat before the O.C. of Brigade Led Horses.
The charges were ?
(1) Putting Allenby on picquet.
(2) Neglecting to carry out their picquet
duties.
Which is but a forgotten ripple beside the
memory of such a wonderful night.
666.
If ?
(With apologies to R.K.)
(Written after seeing a Digger who was not seasick.)
IF you can sweetly smile when those around you
Are feeling just like ninepence in the quid ;
Can lightly step while angry waves surround you,
And threaten on your can to put the lid.
If pitching gives you an immense sensation,
And rolling means for you ecstatic life;
If you can meet with calm imperturbation
The height of nature's oceanic strife;
If you can dine on pork without a quiver,
Assimilate the greasiest of food,
Nor get a swift rejoinder from your liver,
But still feel hard as nails and twice as good;
If you had never known just what delight meant,
Till in the Bight you heaved for seven days,
When Ocean's wrath provided mild excitement
And nothing more, nor made you change your ways;
[f gastronomic worries never get you
When shipping seas right o'er the fo-c-sle head;
If groaning, sea-sick shipmates cannot fret you,
Nor make your innards feel like lumps of lead;
If you can keep your grub down when you get it,
And of life's joys take out a further lease,
Then?if with health your heart is not besotted?
For God's sake let the others die in peace!
JUNIOR ENGINEER.


O.C. 11th A.L.H. Regiment
LIEUT. -COL. BAILEY, D.5.0., makes
110 reference to the fine achievements of
his regiment throughout the campaign,
but "since the signing of the Armistice," he
remarks, "the regiment has had a varied ex-
perience. C.O. Lieut.-Col. J. W. Parsons,
D.5.0., was evacuated to hospital on Oct. 15th.
1918, and embarked for Australia on Christ-
mas day. The men will never forget the rain
and cold of the Syrian winter; but everything
considered, we have some pleasant memories
of the Lebanon.
"We arrived at Moascar on March 16th,
and at once laid out a camp, in which we
anticipated living in harmony for the term
prior to embarkation. Luck was against us;
for, two days later we were fully horsed and
equipped and on the march to Tel-el-Kebir
and Abu Hamid to take a hand in quelling the
Gyppo riots. On April Ist we came under
the command of the G.O.C. 3rd Brigade, and
were subsequently sent to the Mansoura dis-
trict, where the natives were decidedly hostile.
Several times we were compelled to use our
firearms to quell the mobs.
"However, we had a fairly good time
around Mansoura, and were well treated by
the European inhabitants. Throughout the
month of June we indulged in all kinds of
sport, which included cricket, tennis, and
horse-racing. We received liberal donations
from the Australian Comforts' Lund, while
the citizens raised �4OO towards catering and
the prizes for the sports competitions held on
Peace Day, when every member of the regi-
ment sat down to a good spread.
"During May and June, 13 per cent, of our
old hands were granted English leave. A
certain number were also sent to Australia for
early repatriation. I think that more of the
original and long-service men should have
been granted an opportunity to visit England.
"The Regiment re-assembled at Moascar
011 )uly 4th and embarked on the 22nd, 22
officers, 51 sergeants, 335 other ranks strong.
Everyone will be pleased to get home and out
of harness.
"We have only 3 original officers left in the
Regiment: Majors Loynes, Costelloe and my-
self. Major Alexander, 8.H.Q., is the only
other original nth officer. The remaining com-
batant officers, except Major Moyle, have been
reared in the outfit and worked their way
right up. There are also 102 other ranks
returning with us, who are original members
of the Regiment; they have stuck to the job
right through.
"We hope to perpetuate the memory of the
Regiment in Australia. Having formed an
old nth Association, we intend to have re-
unions in Brisbane, Adelaide and Northern
Queensland at fixed permanent dates."
O.C. 4th L.H. F. Amb.
LILUT.-COL. C. V. SINGLE, D.5.0.,
A.A.M.C., is one of the most popular
men in the 4th Brigade. Lor a long
time he was R.M.O. to the 12th Light Horse
Regiment, in which unit he endeared himself
to all ranks by his unfailing sympathy and
kindness. A man of many parts ?he has
played cricket for his State (New South
Wales), and is one of the best baseball players
around Sydney.
Enlisting in the Ist Military District, Col.
Single sailed from Brisbane in April, iqU-
In Egypt he was attached at first to the Ist
Australian Hospital at Heliopolis, then he
went to Luna Park to hell) cope with the rush
of wounded from Gallipoli. It is no exaggera-
tion to say that Capt. Single (as he was then)
worked clay and night. He then went to
Gallipoli, arriving there on August 9th, 1915,
attached to the sth Wiltshires at Suvla Bay.
Colonel Single frankly admits that this was
the least happy period of his war experiences.
Eventually getting back to his own folk at
Anzac, he went to the 2nd Light Horse as
R.M.O. Subsequently he was attached to the
3rd Light Horse Lield Ambulance, with which
unit he stayed until the evacuation.
Shortly after his return to Egypt, he went
as R.M.O. to the 12th Regiment, staying with
it until he obtained his majority, when he
went as second in command to the 2nd Light
Horse Lield Ambulance, in which he served
through the Ist and 2nd Gaza battles.


Soon, to the joy of the 4th Brigade, he
returned once more; this time as a Lieut.-Col.
in command of the 4th Light Horse Field
Ambulance. He has been with this Brigade
through all the later operations, including the
2nd El Salt battle and the capture of Damas-
cus. After the Armistice, in company with his
bosom friend, Col. Cameron of the 12th, he
went big game shooting south of the Soudan.
Col. Single is somewhat reticent as to what
transpired there; but as he occasionally
refers vaguely to furriers and taxidermists, it
may be taken for granted that the gallant
Colonel's efforts in the big game line were
fraught with success.
A good comrade, an efficient medico, and a
gallant soldier, the 4th Brigade wishes him
well.
Birds of a Feather
Being a letter addressed to Mr. Nicholas
Reece, Ansae Cottage, Little Riley Street,
Surry Hills, from his bosom, pal, Temporary
L/C pi. Edward Robinson, A.1.F., on leave
at Woy Woy, N.S.W., pending discharge.
DEAR OLD NICK ?Cheero, old chap! I've
got the greatest news for you. Nothing so
wonderful, so impressive, has happened to me
since my last leave in Cairo..
What is it ? Ah ! you are such a go-easy,
don't-care-a-hang sort of chump, that you'd
never guess, even though you kept on trying
till the average Billjim voluntarily attended a
church parade.
Nicky, old sport; I have found her. Her!
the dearest trickiest little bit of goods in the
world. Sounds great, eh ? I'd tell you all
about her if I possessed the vocabulary to do
it. Anyhow, her hair is that sort of mousey-
brown which has all kinds of twinkly lights
in it; her eyes are big and brown and bewitch-
ing; they draw one irresistibly. As for her
feet?well, you wouldn't find a daintier little
pair if you watched King Street all day.
Added to these charms, she says she adores
housework, and is never so happy as when
preparing little meals.
She is just down here on a holiday, enjoy-
ing a well-earned rest after four years war-
work as a V.A.D. By-the-way, if you meet
her, don't say I was driving the Municipal
Council's water-cart in pre-war days. She
thinks I was the Chief Engineer.
Be a sport, Nicky, and don't give me away.
Mind you, she worships me, bless her dear
little heart. Your true cobber, TEDDY.

from her adored friend, Miss Ida Kiddem,
of No. 12 Tiger Lodge, Boulac Street,

DARLING LlLY?l've managed it at last. I
mean ?you know, I vowed that I wouldn't go
back to town without some sort of sign on
my left hand to prove I wasn't getting dusty
on the top shelf. Tabby cats and non-swearing
parrots may be very well in their way, but not
always comforting and satisfying-?Tomany
won't let you pull his tail, and Cocky refuses
to let you scratch him.
Well, I met Him (after dusk) on Pretty
Beach, Woy Woy, quite unconventionally and
romantically. Mind you, he's no Adonis; but
I made quite sure he had a satisfactory
balance in his pay-book (he said both sides
of his pay-book were very much balanced)
before I fixed things up and whispered a shy
little "Yes, dearie," into his manly ear.
He's awfully in love ; I'll soon have to get a
pair of rubber boots to wade through the slush
that pours from his fond, loving lips. Aren't
sentimental men a nuisance? Teddy ?such a
nice name, dear; has a huggish sound ?seems
to run somewhat in the domestic rut. So I've
told him I adore housework and just dote on
cooking. Ugh! Could you ever tell the
difference between my one and only cake and
the prehistoric bricks in the Egyptian
Museum ? It didn't seem policy to let him
know that I've been pulling the lever at the
"Crown and Anchor," Little Queen Street; so,
1 gently intimated that I was a V.A.D. Plenty
of cross (XXX) about my job. However,
expect the dear kid soon. Tons of love from

Moonstones
A BILLJIM FAIRY TALE
NO doubt some men who returned to Aus-
tralia on the Morvada were warehouse
employees in pre-war days. Perhaps
they scorn the very idea of repatriation; but
probably a few have developed a liking for
outdoor employment. Commercial travelling-
is sometimes a profitable means of gaining a
livelihood, and it's not hard work; also it is
congenial, provided always that you get hold
of the right line.
Anyhow, there's a newly-founded Queens-
land jewellery firm on the lookout for good,
reliable salesmen. Applications, by letter
only, are invited by Jas. Tigers & Co., Moon-
stone Merchants, Moascar Street, The Valley,
Brisbane.
But this story opens in Egypt and closes
nowhere in particular.
Since the "Saalam Johnnies" went into
camp at Moascar, moonstones are more diffi-
cult to get than they were when the Aus-
tralian Light Horse was in training at that
place. By the time they had returned from
Palestine and the Gyppo rising, for de-
mobolization, the boys had entirely forgotten
the existence of these precious stones.
There was, however, one soldier at Moas-
car whose pre-war commercial instinct was'
never slow to revive. He was an old pros-
pector who enjoyed the distinction for being
the first man to discover black opal in Queens-
land. He was also a Major of merry moods,
having just returned to Moascar with his
Regiment from Mansourah. In all business
undertakings he was most reserved; but his
knowledge of the whereabouts of moonstones
he kept a profound secret.
It would, perhaps, be as well to mention
that the Major was, to his more intimate
associates, known as "Blue"; more especially
so to his life-long friend and confidential ad-
viser, "Spud" Murphy, who, through unfor-
seen circumstances, was not only compelled to
dine in a meaner mess, but was denied the
rights of accompanying his old friend on his
frequent visits to the French Club at
Ishmalia.
While "Blue" went about exercising his wit
under the glowing lanterns and leafy palms
each night, "Spud" cursed his fate sitting on
the wooden bridge which spans the sweet
water canal. His only consolation was a mid-
night stroll home to camp with the Major.
One night "Spud" was at a loss to under-
stand why "Blue" was so late returning.
Becoming anxious for "Blue's" safety, he
decided on prompt action. Although unarmed,
he had a good turn of speed; so, to avoid sus-
picion he walked backwards past the bridge-
guard. Entirely deceiving the sentry 011 duty,
he passed on through the native quarter
towards the French Club, which he found in
darkness. He then searched the town, making
all sorts of enquiries, but gathered no tidings
concerning the whereabouts of his comrade.
"Spud" then decided on a bold move. He
knew that the Gyppos were in a state of revo-
lution ; that the Bedouins were lurking on the
outskirts of the town, and that he had no
revolver. Nothing daunted, however, he
crept through the darkness and soon reached
Observation Post on the Desert.


the desert. After a long search he smelt
something burning. It was the aerodrome
incinerator.
Retracing his steps, he then turned in a
north-westerly direction. After a five-mile
trek, he again smelt something burning, which
he discovered to be dead horses.
Just as "Spud" was about to give up hope
and return to camp, he heard the weird yelp-
ing of dingoes, together with the flip-flap of
vultures hovering overhead. Then he came
across the Major, at whose feet stood an open
leather portmanteau.. He was throwing
stones at a number of desert dogs which were
endeavouring to form a cordon round him.
The dogs at once recognized "Spud" as the
man who, with the aid of a meat-chopper, had
separated the fore-leg from the main portion
of the leader of the pack, at the cookery
school last year. They at once set off, so
"Spud" approached the Major unopposed.
"Blue" did not conceal the delight he felt
after he'd recognized his friend. Only one
moonstone remained in the bag. After swear-
ing "Spud" to eternal secrecy, both refilled
the portmanteau and returned to camp hum-
ming that well-known refrain, "You and I
Together, Love."
Time went on, and the friendship of "Blue"
and "Spud" gradually waned, a thing which
many imputed to the great gulf which yawned
between the social standing of each. "Spud"
became a frequent visitor to the wet canteen
at the rear of the cinema, while "Blue" re-
sumed his debauchery at the Club while the
band played.
With the help of the E.L.C. the 4th Brigade
entrained at Moascar. The men, many with
their kit-bags full of loot, marched from the
Kantara Railway Station, crossed the bridge,
and after skirting the canal for two miles,
embarked.
That day "Spud" was detailed for baggage
fatigue; but little did he know that the heavy
boxes he had to lump aboard, branded "Major
A few days after passing Suez, "Blue" was
elected President of the Sports Committee.
So conspicuous did he loom in the public eye
that "Spud" got disgusted with him and
decided to break his acquaintance.
Once, while the Major was addressing the
mess-orderlies in regard to the reduction of
the ration scale, a large number of troops
assembled to watch "Blue's" antics. In his
concluding remarks, "Blue" asked if there was
anything they wanted. "Spud," whose chin
displayed seven days' growth, blurted "Soap!"
"Blue" asked "What sort ?shaving?" The
crowd laughed at "Spud's" expense, but
"Blue" said "It's all right, 'Spud' Murphy
knows me."
On arrival at Colombo things looked black.
Niggers and elephants, together with an army
of well-fed Y.M.C.A. officials, came aboard
and announced that the backshee trip was off;
that a strong picquet was required. G.M.P.'s
were everywhere; while all the by-ways lead-
ing out the town were guarded. Shops and
pubs were closed; only officers were permitted
to visit the Galle Face Hotel. "Spud" had to
satiate himself at the Y.M.C.A.; but the only
baksheesh he remembers receiving was a
number of moonstones.
As the day wore on the elephants became
so heavy for the boys who assembled on the
wharf, that they were compelled to throw
away what moonstones they were in possession
of ; . The natives gathered them one by one,
? after which they took them to the Galle Face
Hotel and sold them for �i each to several
Light Horse officers. "Blue" was delighted.
Congratulating himself on having such untold
wealth aboard the troopship, he invited the
Colonel to have a drink.
One afternoon at sea, the boxing events
ended earlier than was expected, so the
President, who acted as timekeeper, sprang
into the ring and announced that he would
give a valuable trophy to the winner of a five-
round exhibition bout.
The champion bruiser of Egypt stepped into
the ring with a horseshoe concealed in his
right glove for luck. Nobody seemed anxious
for a flutter, so "Spud," who still had a
liking for "Blue," stepped over the ropes and
received an ovation which will long be
remembered. There were two hits, the last of
which was caused by "Spud" hitting the deck
with a horseshoe mark branded on his jaw.
The seconds just happened to get "Spud's"
left eye opened wide enough for him to see
"Blue" presenting his opponent with a moon-
stone.
After that day, throughout the voyage
"Blue" continued to give moonstones, valued
by himself at �i, to the winner of each event,
thus increasing his popularity to an unspeak-
able degree.
"ROOKE."

Mrs. Chisholm and Miss Macphillamy
Two noble Australian war workers who made great sacrifices for the welfare of
soldiers and sailors of the Empire
MRS. ALICE I. CHISHOLM, formerly
of Goulburn, N.S.W., left Sydney
with her daughter in June, 1915? an d
landed in Egypt late in July.* Her sterling
work at Luna Park and No. 3 Auxiliary
Hospitals is still remembered and appreciated
by many soldiers who returned from Gallipoli
wounded or sick.
After assisting for some time at the
Y.M.C.A. Soldiers' Tea Rooms in Esbekiah
Gardens, early in January, 1916, Mrs. Chis-
holm opened the Empire Soldiers' Club at
Heliopolis, where the services of herself and
daughter were given whole-heartedly to the
soldiers.
When the Desert Corps Rest Camp was es-
tablished at Port Said, Mrs. Chisholm had her
Club in readiness on the beach by the end of
|uly.* She subsequently provided refreshment
for large numbers of Light Horsemen after
the Battle of Romani.
Shortly afterwards, Miss Rout left for two
months' holiday in England. Elated at the
prospect of more active work, Mrs. Chisholm
took over her Kantara Empire Club, which
she quickly made famous. Having purchased
the whole stock and working plant from Miss
Rout, Mrs. Chisholm was then joined by Miss
Macphillamy; hence, assisted by 38 orderlies,
they were never at a loss to cope with any
number of hungry men.
Miss Macphillamy worked with Mrs. Chis-
holm for seventeen months; then left her, to
establish a club at Jerusalem for the Aiizac
Mounted Division. She afterwards did great
service for Australian Light Horsemen at
Rafa, where a division camped for a few
months prior to the Egyptian revolution.
The services of both Mrs. Chisholm and
Miss Macphillamy came to an end only when
many Light Horsemen had sailed for home,
while the remainder were concentrated at
Moascar awaiting embarkation.
After their return to Australia, both ladies
intend to publish in the leading papers of each
State a complete record of their turnover and
contributions.
They also wish to convey their heartfelt
thanks to the men who gave them assistance
from time to time.
Arriving in Egypt in 1915. Miss Mac-
phillamy worked for four months at No. 2
A.G.H.; later on, at canteen work in Meadi
Light Horse Club and Esbekiah Gardens. She
then joined the permanent staff of the Anzac
Hostel, where she worked for three months
before joining Mrs. Chisholm.
* * * *
One evening, at sea, a pleasing ceremony
was conducted on the promenade deck. Both
Mrs. Chisholm, 0.8. E., and Miss Mac-
phillamy, 0.8. E., were presented by the
Officers, N.C.O.'s and men with a suitable
present in recognition of their memorable
war-work in Egypt and Palestine.

Campaign Reflections
THE DREAM HORSE
The darkness haunts me ever,
It comes with black remorse;
I dream ?Ah! I shall never
Forget Dunleavy's horse!
Dunleavy rose and mounted
And stretched his supple neck,
While mentally he counted
The miles to Rachedbeck.
Then, forward, at the canter,
Dunleavy gaily went.
And o'er the hills we followed on
Like goaded devilment.
Where chips of flint and rubble
Lay scattered loose around,
We crashed across the stubble
And cleared the broken ground;
Then out in open order
We swept, and formed a screen.
But nothing of the enemy
Could anywhere be seen.
Where ruthless famine sullies
The scope of hills and plain,
Among the thirsty gullies
We drew the bridle-rein.
We sprawled in rude confusion
Far scattered, left and right,
Some showing on the rising ground.
And others out of sight.
Then weariness stole o'er me,
And wrapped me in a sleep . . .
I woke, to see before me
A living being creep.
I seized my loaded rifle
And raised it like a dart?
But as I fired, a rusty blade
Seemed driven through my heart.
A score of oaths assailed me,
The sergeant harshly said
"Dunleavy!"?reason failed me ?
"You've shot him through the head!
He crawled along the skyline
To watch a hostile force?
But' now that you have done for him,
Go back and get his horse."
Dunleavy was recorded
As accidently slain,
Much bitterness was hoarded.
And we rode home again;
We floundered on like mourners,
Mile after weary mile?
Dunleavy's horse came dragging on
Beside me, all the while.

The sombre darkness gathered
What time the sun had set,
And all the beasts were lathered
With dust and foam and sweat.
Though night had swooped upon us,
And blotted out our course,
I still led on the limping thing
They called Dunleavy's horse.
All bruised from hip to shoulder
By sling and rifle-butt.
We stumbled at each boulder,
And slipped in every rut.
No beacon marked the horse-lines
We sternly strove to find,
And all the while I led the horse
Of someone far behind.
Intense and overhearing
The darkness wove a spell?
I felt that I was faring
Into the heart of hell,
When right into the horse-lines
I stumbled with a groan?
Alas ! and poor Dunleavy's horse
Was still beside my own.
Ah! time is yet unyielding?
While others slumber sound
I take Dunleavy's gelding
And lead it round and round.
And when the moon is beaming,
No spirit seems to reck
If I lead out Dunleavy's horse
And race to Rachedbeck.
Its very shadow crazes
And holds my heart in fee;
By day it stands and gazes
Remorsefully at me;
And if I ride on duty
And leave it tied behind,
All day I hear it strain and stamp
And whinny on the wind.
The darkness haunts me ever,
It conies with black remorse;
I dream?Ah! I shall never
Forget Dunleavy's horse!
At night it moves beside me
By track and piquet line?
' Twill haunt me till an ounce of lead
Relieves this heart of mine.

"VENTILATOR": Connie was never at a loss
for a tale to tell whenever he appeared before
the orderly room. The charge was one of
insubordination. In reply to the usual:
"Have you anything to say?" Connie replied,
"Yes, sir. While serving in the Boer War, I
was chaffeur to General Blank. One day we
had the misfortune to collide with an
armoured train. the General and myself
were thrown heavily on the road and rendered
unconscious. Upon examination it was found
necessary to remove both our brains. After
successfully performing the operation the
M.O. made a mistake and placed the General's
brains in my head and mine in the General's
head. Having the brains of a General, you
can surely understand how it affects me when
sharply addressed by junior officers and
N.C.O.'s. I trust, sir, you will give my un-
fortunate position your just consideration."
Severely reprimanded!
JCNNEE WORKA" : Billjim's feminine
counterpart is not behind Billjim himself in
the famous Australian pastime of giving an
English comrade the "bumkum oil" about
Orstralia. When the two English field hospi-
tals were established at Belah, Palestine, a
number of Aussie sisters were employed on
their staffs, and when it came to camp-fire
tales, the Dinkums could prevaricate with
more semblance of truth than when relating'
actual happenings.
One English girl to whom I was introduced
was fairly bubbling over with information
concerning the fur hat bands worn by the 6th
Light Horsemen. She said they were
boomerang skins. Her room-mate was an
Aussie girl.
"DA: Two eminent medical authorities,
"Doc. S and Legs Eleven, one day dis-
covered that water, after being used con-
stantly for ablutionary purposes without being
changed, was not only distasteful as a drink,
but deadly poisonous. Those who were com-
pelled at Abassan, Palestine, in 1917, to take
the only available water from a certain six-
thousand gallon washing-bath after a hurri-
cane call-out to the front-line, are strongly
advised to make their peace and square all
debts.

"VTc":To unofficially separate two or three
tins of bully beef from an army dump is a
dangerous proceeding, which incurs a heavy
penalty if caught ; while a full case may be
removed and incur only a light penalty if the
thief is unfortunate. A similar law governs
small and large embezzlements; but this is by
way of introducing the intentions of a section
of Billjims, which, having arrived at Bayud
after the perishing Maghara stunt, straight-
way plunged their heads into the horse-
troughs from which many thirsty horses were
drinking. After four swollen tongues were
reduced enough to allow speech, a discussion
commenced about securing some tucker. The
horses piqueted, one of the section appointed
himself Acting Temporary Lance Corporal,
and marched his men down to a near-by dump,
where they were soon at work removing a
case of bully from a square stack. An en-
raged A.S.C. officer rushed upon them. "Do
you know that you are pulling down my
house?" he bellowed. Our bright A. T.
L/Corporal instantly assumed a look of deep
sorrow and contrition, which worked favour-
ably, and then asked which was the right stack.
"The pyramid-shaped one," replied the officer,
at the same time instructing one of his ser-
geants to take the party over to secure the
needed case, which action cleared the section
and its acting non-commisioned officer of any
official irregularity.

"BUNNY": Daniels was a warrant officer,
also a wowser. He found a kindred spirit in
a "Rainbow" Padre, who seemed to stake
more faith in compulsory church parades
than in the brotherhood of man. Sundays
became a weary procession of smearing leg-
gings with dubbin preparatory to the usual
lecture on "original sin," which drove us to
the point of distraction. One Sunday I fell
out with the conscientious objectors, whom
Daniels always regarded as eternally damned.
"So long as I am warrant officer," he re-
marked, "every man will either worship God
or peel spuds. Right turn! To the cook-
house ?quick march!"
"DICK TURPIN" : While the nth Light
Horse Regiment was at Tripoli, the frequent
thieving from the camp necessitated the horse-
piquet being armed. During one midnight
shift, three troopers decided on some gun-
play. ? Having deployed widely to give effect
and a sense of realization, the game began.
From the far flank came the cry "there goes
a slack-pouched Jack !" which was immediately
followed by five rounds in rapid succession,
and the belated command, "Halt!" After the
opening shots the fight raged furiously up and
down the line, while one of the actors, carried
away by his desire to start-in, fired off a
revolver from inside his overcoat pocket and
disappeared in a shower of sparks over a
steep bluff. The drama eventually came to a
stop owing to the unpopularity of the bullets
clipping in amongst the now awakened and
thoroughly annoyed Regiment. Next morn-
ing, on parade, Major Dunlop?a sportsman
to his finger-tips?congratulated the horse-
piquet on their able defence overnight, dwell-
ing on the moral influence it would have on
the native mind; "but," he added, "the
casualties might be lessened with no loss of
effect if next time you were to shoot out to
sea."
"BULLY HAYES": During the Iggery Flat
stunt, a galloper, coming across a lone Tommy
infantryman, was immediately questioned as
to whether the Aussie had seen any "Camels"
about.
No, the Billjim had seen no spare Colonels
knocking around. "No, Camels! Camels!"
corrected the Tommy, as if throwing complete
light on the subject.
The Aussie then reckoned that he hadn't
seen or smelt a camel that day. At this the
infantryman pulled back a shoulder-strap;
and, in silent exasperation, pointed to his
Regimental badge?that of the Cornwalls.
After which enlightenment the mounted man
was able to give the required information.

"RUFUS" : A miniature ex donkey rider,
who had arraeked up too freely in Jerusalem,
refused to mount his horse for the return
journey to the valley. In a shrill voice
suggestive of a cockatoo ?he defied the world.
Finally his mates had to forcibly lift him on
to his horse and tie him there. One rope
under the horse's belly connected the victim's
feet, while a fore and after brace across his
shoulders from the front bar of the saddle to
the canticle, finished the job. The pace was
fast, but the ropes held well, for, once the
fighting midget was found swinging securely
underneath the prad. Arrived back at camp
the little man's language and threats were still
vitriolic, so, lifting him from the horse, they
flung him to bed still tied to the saddle.

OUT OF BOUNDS
The regiments advanced across
The ruthless wilderness;
They suffered woe and heavy loss
In years of bitter stress.
White skylines in succession loomed
Across their hazy ken,
While vistas of depression gloomed
The hearts of all their men.
Disjointed reason waned and swirled
With weird, imagined sounds,
Till hope seemed dead, and all the world
Was barred, and "Out of Bounds."
We floundered on and on despite
The deep, defiant sand.
And then the mountains hove in sight
Across the promised land.
Where cactus-hedges wind about
Mean villages of mud,
We put the stubborn foe to rout
And dyed the grass with blood.
But Rozzas followed in our wake
Like hot, pursuing hounds ?
We won the ground for them to take
And label "Out of Bounds."
Long months we fought for Gaza town,
And pictured her supreme
As one who wears a clinging gown
Transparent, in a dream.
AVe saw the foe relax at length
And leave his battered line,
While Britain struck him off the strength
In Southern Palestine.
All day we heard the guns exchange
Their well-directed rounds,
And when the town was out of range
Thank God, 'twas "Out of Bounds!"
We scrambled over Judah's plains
All eager to behold
Tall minarets and gilded fanes
And graven domes of gold. .
Yes, some imagined they would see
The glories of the East,
And reap the fruits of victory
In one consuming feast ?
Alas! the Provost Marshal, and
His staff were on their rounds
To place the conquered Holy Land
(To soldiers) "Out of Bounds."
We reached the Holy City when
The Turks were in retreat ;
We saw the Provost Marshal's men
Patrolling every street.
All day we watched the Padres crowd
Between the cringing guard ;
The Bedouins were all allowed
To enter (men were barred).
We wandered back to camp again
Like hungry, scolded hounds,
For every outer street and lane
Was posted "Out of Bounds."
Away from old Jerusalem
We ambled joyously,
Nor pictured any A.P.M.
Beside the lifeless sea;
And down by ancient Jericho
We grimly fought, and won,
But some fell 'neath a fatal blow
Before the day was done.
Ah! we can only wish them well
Beneath their burial mounds,
And trust they'll garner joy in hell
If heaven is "Out of Bounds."
"ARRACK ANDREW."
8.D.2: The setting is the Jordan Valley at
its worst, and a church parade. The Regi-
ment was paraded, and on the R.C.'s being
told to dismiss, fully 99 per cent, fell out.
Ten minutes later this surprising majority were
called up to bury four dead horses ?a heart-
breaking job in that flint-like country, irres-
pective of climatic and other conditions. They
objected that the sectarian element was being
introduced, so Cozzy was called in to arbi-
trate.. But the big Major in his deepest fog-
horn tones declared that anyone with half an
eye could see that they were far removed
from the blessings of religion, and that if they
didn't get those horses buried they were no
friends of his. The crowd laughed, and the
burial proceeded apace.

Albert Cotter ?An Appreciation
Killed in Action, Oct. 31st, 1917
ALBERT JAMES COTTER? "Tibby"
to his numerous friends?unassuming,
genial and generous to a degree, will
long be remembered by followers of cricket,
as well as by the many who knew him in the
Light Llorse. Incidentally, there will always
be a feeling of exaltation among those who
realize that he did the right thing by coming
forward to offer his services when men were
so badly needed.
As a soldier he performed excellent work
before he was shot from the saddle during a
mounted charge on a Turkish position. He
died a glorious death. His grave is near Beer-
sheba, Palestine.
As a cricketer, Cotter stood in the highest
rank; some of his feats may never be sur-
passed. As a sportsman he was without a
peer.
After leaving Sydney Grammar School,
Cotter quickly won a place in the powerful
Glebe eleven, where his "express" deliveries
soon brought him into prominence. Then he
made his debut into interstate cricket, when
he and Bowden ?"greased lightning" and
"corkscrew" overwhelmed the Victorian
batsmen. From that time onward his career
as a cricketer was assured. He was regarded
as the mainstay of the N.SAV. attack, and
after very few matches was selected to repre-
sent Australia.
Until war put an end to this class of cricket,
no Australian eleven, either in the South or in
England, was complete without him. One of
nature's gentlemen, he was the idol of the
small boy. To have seen "Tib" walk into the
Cricket Ground, and to have said "good day"
to him, was in the life of a youth an event
which would never be forgotten.
My personal association with him was in
the Glebe eleven. For my sins I fielded slip
to his bowling, and was very often not able
to hold the "red hot" ones which flew off the
bat. But " Pibby" didn't care. Where other
bowlers may have thirsted for blood, "Tib"
used to say, and mean, "hard luck, old
fellow!" He never lost heart; the more he
was dropped the better he bowled. The
keenest of cricketers, it was a pleasure to
travel with him.
These same qualities which made him such
a great fighting cricketer, stood to him when,
a thorough soldier in the more serious game,
he distinguished himself on the battlefield.
On more than one occasion he was offered
promotion. Though he would have made a
splendid leader, he refused all advances.
He met his death in the forefront of his
galloping comrades, charging over deep
trenches at Beersheba; the end came swiftly,
painlessly.
Perhaps in his last moments he thought of
the green cricket fields of Australia; of the
days when he was the idol of the crowd. But,
if he did, I am sure there came to his lips the
old smile and the familiar expression, "Hard
luck, old man."
So, farewell, "Tibby." old man. True
sportsmen and Australian patriots will never
forget you.

A Dream Soliloquy
EL ARISH ! El Arish, on his own! Yes,
Yes, he's won right enough, and every
penny of my deferred pay on him ?
�yoo to iyo. I'm set now.
"It was Sydney or the bush with me; now
it's twelve months 'blow' round our harbour.
I'm well satisfied with my fortune, so I'm off
to town.
"'Cab, sir! cab, sir?' What a start those
words gave me ?my God! and no wonder;
hanged if isn't old Major Stetson. He gets
none of my patronage. No, curse him! The
old rotter knocked me back for a nip of rum
at Damascus. Hold on, though; Ell let him
drive me to town, and then I'll give him the
knock.
"Righto, cabby; Marble Bar, iggery. I
don't think he's awake up to me. This straw
lid and flash clobber make a great difference to
a bloke. Gee, Stetson looks 'warby;' that tale
about the chorus girl from the Tivoli catching
him for his cash must have been dinkum.
"I remember a bint in the olive groves at
Tripoli finding his cardigan ?he was always
reckless with women. Us blokes are getting
a bit of our own back. This morning I met
Lieut. Watson looking for his fare to the
races. He's a tip-slinger now. He told me
that Jack Thomas, the A.P.M., was grabbed

Bannerman! Struth ! She looks well in that
low-cut blouse; I must have a yarn with her.
"So you were dressmaking for awhile, Miss
Bannerman, until you met trooper Freeman,
now one of the most successful publicans in
Surry Hills? Engaged you as a barmaid, did
he? Ah! I thought you'd have to leave him.
Freeman always was somewhat free, particu-
larly when he got a chance on active service?
which was seldom. However, you have a
pretty good job here.
"Hello! Here's Stetson after his fare!
"You're making a bloomer, old man, I've
been in here for more than two hours; Miss
Bannerman can prove it. Keep away, or I'll
give you in charge. Well, so long, Gertie; I'll
take a stroll round the block.
"Goodness; I see them everywhere! Fancy
poor old Robson, who was such a fine captain,
spruiking for a picture show. I'll spare him
ten minutes and, perhaps, a few bob.
"I thought Robson would want something;
anyhow, 1 won't miss that old suit of clothes
I promised him. He tells me that Col. Dixon
has a good steady job driving a milk cart at
Botany; that Major Lowman is in a second-
hand clothes shop round Bathurst Street.
Ah! those Cairo tarts are no class with these
Sydney girls.
"I must mooch round to the Tivoli; have to
take Vera Fierce to supper to-night. Vera

performing monkey.
"Life's worth living after all; no more
parades; no more saluting; no more bully; no

rotten dream. . . . I'm a moral to pull 28
days. No more booze after that."
"VENTILATOR/'


The 4th A.L.H. Brigade Band
DURING the first week of February, 1919,
Brigadier-Gen. Grant, D.5.0., C.8.,
gave permission for the formation of a
Brigade Band. Attempts had been made,
without success, to keep together our success-
ful musical combinations at Belah, Palestine,
during the early part of 1918. But at that
time the Regiments were so much under
strength that every man was required for
more important duties.
After the signing of the Armistice, however,
we discovered that our "Brig." was both a
lover of music and a sticker for the band.
But his motto has always been "Work first,
play after."
Soon, the instruments, which had been
stored for several months in Jerusalem,
arrived at Tripoli, and a few bandsmen of pre-
war times met and commenced work as a
musical body, under the command of Lieut.
W. J. Murray, 12th Light Horse. These
instruments were the property of the 4th and
12th Light Horse Regiments, whose original
bandsmen brought them from Australia more
than four years ago. The process of unpack-
ing revealed a strange outfit, causing many to
wonder whether it was a brass foundry or
some fragments from Besson's workshop.
Anyhow, if Besson's had been asked to pur-
chase the turn-out (judging it on appearance)
they may have offered no more than the price
of a Tattersall's ticket. The instruments had
been dumped, packed, unpacked and trans-
ported around Egypt throughout the years of
war. "Maleesh," we were determined to have
a band, and blow the Sinai Desert and Gyppo
cobwebs through our instruments to glory.
About the first week in March, we com-
menced with seven players. Instruments were
cleaned and the first practice was held in the
olives adjacent to the camp. Certainly the
result was far from harmonious. Taking into
consideration the large number of Syrian
orange-sellers, washerwomen and general
hawkers trying to dispose of their goods,
together with the efforts of the heroic little
band endeavouring to dispose of its best, the
effect was somewhat weird. Under these
adverse conditions, however, the ardour of
the players was not damped, and daily they
worked hard at their practice to make their
venture a success. A fortnight later, the
Y.M.C.A. official allowed the band the use of
his large marquee in which to practice. This
meant working under better conditions.
Fortune soon favoured us with seven
players from Desert Corps Rest-Camp Band,
and three more from the Brigade, including
our present bandmaster, Sergt. W. H.
McCarthy, making our total strength 17
players.
At this stage, owing to the scarcity of
bandsmen, any instrumentalist whose rank
was beneath that of a W. 0., was permitted to
join. Under the baton of our new B.M. we
showed a gradual daily improvement. With
a little difficulty we soon managed to play
light marches, waltzs, hymns, etc.
March 14th the Brigade embarked at
Tripoli for Egypt. On board the troopship
a programme was rendered and greatly
appreciated. After our arrival at Moascar, six
more players joined us. We at once settled
down and commenced to work in earnest for
five hours each day. In a few weeks we were
able to manage fairly difficult music, which
was almost impossible to procure in Egypt.
After the Egyptians revolted, Brigade units
were scattered throughout the Delta and
stationed at some of the affected cities, towns,
and villages. Later on we travelled among
them, giving performances, returning at inter-
vals to Moascar, where we played at various
entertainments and sports.
On July 21st, at Kantara, we embarked for
Australia with the Brigade. Now, almost
every evening we render a programme, and
help to relieve the monotony of troopship
life. All ranks are kindly disposed towards
us, and almost everybody looks forward to
our concerts.
At this stage, we wish to make special
mention of, and also to thank, Brig.-Gen
Grant, D.5.0., C.8., for assisting us in every
possible manner ; Lieut. W. J. Murray, 12th


r ? ' ? ?
A.L.H. O.C. Band, for valuable services
rendered; S.S.M. Viles, 4th A.L.H., for his
genial assistance during the band's infancy;
Bandmaster Sergt. W. H. McCarthy, Sgts.
Ingersole and Hoffman, 12th A.L.H., and
Trooper R. J. Failey, nth A.L.H., for their
strenuous work in the interest of the band's
training from beginning to end; also the Aus-
tralian Comforts' Fund for a generous
donation of music; and Canon Garland, who
enabled the band to purchase two new instru-
ments.
In conclusion, we, the members of the 4th
A.L.H. Band, wish to thank the personnel of
the Brigades for the interest taken in our
efforts, and we trust that during our remain-
ing days as a musical body, we may rest satis-
lied that we have been able to give a few
pleasant hours to our comrades.
"ALLEGRO VIVACE."
The Contributors' Bag
D.D.: The Y.M.C.A. official cannot help it;
his commercial proclivity is manifest.
1 ROOFER J.D., Amb.: Your Colonel is
worthy of something better; verse hopelessly
crude.
EFF HEE: Impossible to locate the joke.
DIGGER: Hard luck. You mention your be-
loved Colonel 5 times in the first verse, 3 times
in the second, and once only in the third and
last. Had you mentioned him several more
times your poem may have struggled in.
DENVER: Your marine ballad entitled
"Somewhere at Sea" is somewhere in the Red
Sea.
HALLAM : Trooper Freeman is not an Ox-
ford man. We have documentary evidence to
prove that lie was matriculated at the Surry
Hills Grammar School.
1 HE SPORT: Yes; "Blue" was no doubt a
fine athlete in his day, but fifty months' active
service has majorized him.
J.N.: Your bitter remarks concerning bad
food are too inappropriate for inclusion.
L.8.: "La Petite Danseuse" treated with
insufficient skill, jokes good.
BOLIVAR: Your "History of the War," or
whatever it is, is strangled with mighty
adjectives which fail to qualify.
J.I I.: We happened to read that poem in an
American Magazine. You failed miserably
when you tried to campaignize it.
The Pines, Beirut.


Homeward Bound
WHEN Jason started on his search for
the Land of the Golden Fleece, his
boat was real, though his mission
fabulous. It was the reverse with the 4th
A.L.H. Brigade, who knew where the
Promised Land was, but it was their boat
which always proved fantastical. Late in
July, 1919, however, the ship Morvada was
seized unawares, and we sailed away.
The Suez Canal, with its grim, desert fore-
shores, was succeeded by the more steep and
rugged Red Sea coast. While passing through
the Red Sea the intense heat, unrelieved by
any breeze, reduced the entire ship's company
to a state of gasping exhaustion. During the
run from Aden to Colombo the seas ran high,
and our unladen boat made long, quivering
dives; after which descents the ship would be
flung far out into the whirlpool again. The
sailors said that it was quite usual, but the
troops ?the majority of whom were in the
last and most violent stages of sea-sickness ?-
would never believe them.
With the ocean calming down all on board
gradually developed sea legs, and an interest
in food, so a well-arranged sports programme
was started. These sports, which proved
most successful and competitive throughout,
were a happy ? diversion during the long
voyage.
One sun-kissed morning we passed through
a narrow entrance between two breakwaters,
into Colombo Harbour. The city itself, with
its fine public buildings and red-roofed bunga-
lows, is set off by a vivid background of dense
foliage. A fringe of tall cocoanut palms form
an ever changing landscape line, into which
is merged the dark green of ornamental trees
and bushes, whose sober colour is relieved
by the bright hue of the carmine bungalow-
roofs. The Australian Comforts' Fund had
arranged for a special train to take five
hundred men up to Kandy, but there was only
time for a few hours ashore for exercise and
sightseeing.
Soon after leaving Colombo the weather be-
came rather bleak in comparison to the former
extremes of heat. Our Brigade Band helped
many evening pass pleasantly by their cheery
and excellent music. Numerous sweeps, deal-
ing with the daily mileage and similar to the
old Calcutta Sweep system, caused much
interest. Occasionally we saw the "spouting"
of a whale, but never sufficiently close to get a
clear view of the gigantic mammals. Various
organizations, which co-operate under the
Australian Comforts' Fund, provided us with
a most extensive supply of comforts. They
were greatly appreciated by all on board.
The troop decks are really the topmost of
the various holds. Numerous tables take up
all the available space, and over these tables
are fixed baggage racks, a little more than a
man's height from the floor. The hooks for
swinging the sleeping-hammocks are screwed
into the timber rack beams. Although the
favourite game of leg-pulling was impossible,
for lack of subjects, an unceasing "angling
for bites" was indulged in. For instance, a
trooper would inform a mate that still another
guard was to be on duty while at Adelaide.
The question, "What on earth for?" bringing
the reply "to stop the South Australians from
getting into the crow's nest and stealing the
eggs!"
Two small passengers are worthy of
mention : Stella Dann, a pretty little mavour-
neen of eight, who held our hearts captive:
and Jacky, an adopted Syrian boy. Once,
when angry, Jacky muttered some truly
Arabic cuss-words. Stella, without under-
standing the Arabic, realized that they were
swear words. Instantly she reproved him
with "Australian boys don't swear"; then,
looking round at her soldier captives, added
intuitively this qualifying phrase, "Not in
Australia anyway."
A few days prior to sighting our native
land, a crispness in the air possessed
a certain elusive tang that was strongly sugges-
tive of the fragrance of the bush and the old
gum trees.
We received a lavish welcome from the
Western State. Such splendid hospitality was
keenly appreciated after our long exile in
Eastern lands. Awaiting us at every port was
a welcome in keeping with the Dreams of
Desire that had sustained us until this?the
wonderful Home-coming.
SERGT. D. W. HARRIS, 12TH A.L.H.


Riding by the Sea
THE young spring smiled on Tripoli,
The falling hoofs awoke
Sharp echoes in the hills, as we,
Along the margin of the sea
Farewelled the native folk.
Through groves that shaded vale and hill
Our eager horses strode;
The sun soared high, agog to thrill
The leaves with singing life, and spill
Its gold along the road.
The whitewashed wall, the ruddy roof
Loomed clear on ev'ry rise;
And when they heard the crashing hoof
The village children held aloof
With infantile surprise.
Fair women smiled their greetings shy,
Sleek menfolk bade us speed;
All through the day with song and sigh
We rode beneath a cloudless sky
With laughter in the lead.
Beside a stream we camped at night?
Beneath a spectral moon
That traced a pathway silver white
On seas we heard with soft delight
Along the beaches croon.
At dawn we rose and sought a track
'Neath cliffs and ledges tall;
On high the boulders brown and black
Wove shadows deep, and echoed back
Our ev'ry cry and call.
The green waves cooled our burning feet,
The warm sun smote the road;
Through barley field and field of wheat,
Through leafy lane and village street
We surged and crept and flowed.
The track was like a writhing snake
That hemmed a dancing sea;
The fields were fair enough to wake
The sluggish hearts of men, and make
Their blood leap warm and free.
We drifted on and dallied in
The shade of portly trees.
Where leaves and tendrils wooed to win
Rare blooms whose scent was sweet as sin
And warmer than the breeze.
We forded shallow streams that splashed
Down vales of blowing thyme;
On mountain peaks the sunlight flashed
And kissed us often as we dashed
Through fragrant groves of lime.
Fair mile by sunny mile we pressed
Until the fall of night.
No strong desire for sleep distressed
The vibrant spirits that possessed
And thrilled us with delight.
And yet we slept as sailors sleep
Off-duty, out at sea;
Nor did we waken till the peep
Of dawn disclosed each rocky steep.
And stunted mountain tree.
We saddled up before the sun
Had rolled across the range.
We watched the breakers, one by one,
Along the shingle beaches run
With fickle steps and strange.
All day we rode beside the sea,
And lustily we sang;
Our voices swelled in harmony.
For we were strong and we were free.
And heaven with laughter rang.
With speechless wonder we beheld
The ruddy harbour roofs
As 011 a rubble beach we spelled;
But when we took the road, there swelled
A song of ringing hoofs.
Ah ! long and long ago it seems;
Oh ! but the way was fair.
And it was crossed by laughing streams
Like those we see in fairy dreams
Unvisited by care.
And when we dream of alien skies
And languid sapphire seas;
Of ev'ry fair and fresh surprise
That stirred our hearts and kissed our eyes
Among the olive trees.
Perchance we'll trek for home again
Along the trail of gold;
And in the springtime, after rain,
lovingly on hill and olain
That welcomed us of old.
