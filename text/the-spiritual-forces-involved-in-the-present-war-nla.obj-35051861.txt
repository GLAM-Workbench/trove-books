the Spiritual forces engaged in tbe Present mar
In dealing with this subject I want to lay as a basis for my remarks
this statement: ?Men are not their own masters?; and I want to prove
that statement from Scripture. In Paul?s Epistle to the Romans, 6th
chapter and the 16th verse, he asks this question: ?Know ye not, that
to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to
whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obediencemmto righteous-
ness?? Paul asked this question by way of answering question,
that of believers continuing in sin because they were not under the law,
but under grace. It is a fact that believers are not under the law of
Moses, but under grace, but should they continue in sin because God is
not imputing unto men their trespasses during this His day of grace,
how could that be? So Paul brings to mind the fact that men serve
one of two masters ?either sin, which has behind it its author, Satan, or
righteousness, which has God behind it. Men may talk as they do about
being their own masters, but the fact of life is that there are
TWO GREAT SPIRITUAL FORCES
in the universe, and men and angels are the subjects of one of these two
Powers; and, so far as men are concerned, there are only two classes:
there is on the one hand those who serve Sin and Satan, and on the other
hand there are those who serve God. And this is the work of God, that
ye believe on Him whom He hath sent: that is Christ. Every person then
in this meeting should know where they are with regard to this matter.
Do you believe in Christ as the Sent One of God? If you do then you at
least have gone so far as to yield yourself to obedience unto righteousness.
If you do not believe in Christ you are the servant of Satan. Yes, all men
who have not accepted Christ are in their natural state, and men in their
natural state are
SOLD UNDER SIN.
Now, I prove that by referring you to Romans 7 and 14. Listen to
what is said here: ?For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal,
sold under sin.? I have no time to touch on the first part of this state-
ment, but this latter part: ?Sold under sin.? What does that mean? It
brings out the fact of what is called the ?Fall of Man.? The statement
bears on its face the idea that at one time man (for although Paul here
uses the first personal pronoun, he nevertheless has the whole human
race in view) was not under sin. When then did man come under sin?
In Genesis 3 we have the story. Here we have the first act of disobedi-
ence. Here we have the story of how man, the first representative and
Federal Head of the human race, fell under the seductive power of Satan,
the adversary of God and God?s creature, man. Our first parents believed
Satan, and disbelieved God. They yielded themselves to be the servants
of sin unto death. And so the tale is told how that ?As by one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all
men, for that all have sinned.? (Romans 5:12.) Yes, we were sold under
sin, and it is not until men accept God?s ransom, Christ our (Substitute,
the second Representative Man, even the Lord from Heaven, that we are
freed from the consequences of that transaction of Satan and our father
Adam.
THE RULERS OF THIS WORLD.
Now then, taking a further step, I want to draw your attention to
this remarkable statement in Ephesians 6:12: ?For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
high places.? The literal interpretation of the latter part of this verse
would read: ?Wicked spirits in the heavenlies.? Taking the verse as a
whole we gather from it, so far as our subject is concerned, that the rulers
of this dark world (for be it remembered that in the regard of God this
world for the time being is a world of darkness?the light of the world,
Christ, was cast out, and the Prince of Darkness has got control; the only
true light that is in the world to-day are the faithful Children of God?
true Christians). The real rulers of this world are not then men of flesh
and blood, but wicked spirits inhabiting the regions above. There are
also, of course, angelic hosts, spirit beings who have never sinned, and
who are always ministering to those who are the heirs of Salvation, and
who oppose and frustrate the designs of wicked spirits against the children


of God, and also exercise a restraining power over them in tlieir designs
over men and nations in general.
DANIEL AND THE ANGEL.
One of the most suggestive instances that can be used in proof of
what I say is that recorded in the tenth chapter of the book of Daniel
Daniel had been praying and fasting for three whole weeks. At the end
of that time an angel appeared to him to make known to him the answer
to his prayer. The angel told him that at the very beginning of his
(Daniel s) prayei, he (the angel) was sent to him. But (and mark this
carefully) 'The Prince of the Kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days, but, 10, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me,
and I remained there with the kings of Persia,? Then, further on, he in-
forms Daniel that after he has fulfilled his mission to him he will return
to fight with the prince of Persia, and when he is gone forth the prince of
Grecia shall come.
THIS PRINCE OF PERSIA NOT A MAN.
Surely no one will think the Prince of Persia here referred to was a
mere man, who was the physical ruler over the kingdom of Persia. Who,
for one moment, can seriously think that a mere man in flesh and blood
could withstand and oppose an angel for three weeks? We have only to
remember that account of the destruction of the Assyrian host outside the
walls of Jerusalem during the reign of Hezekiah, when, during the night
an angel of the Lord went forth and smote one hundred and eighty-five
thousand of the enemy of Judah, ?And in the morning, behold, they were
ail dead corpses? (Isaiah, 37, 36). No, the Prince of Persia mentioned
here was no earthly monarch. He was a spirit being delegated by Satan,
the god of this world, to exercise governmental control over the affairs
of the kingdom of Persia by controlling the minds and actions of the men
who occupied the places of authority in that kingdom. We have also an
intimation of the same concerning the kingdom of Grecia.
As a mattei of fact, the whole world of nations is lying in the arms
of the wicked one. Ist John 5-19 conveys to us the idea that as a babe lies
helpless in the arms of a woman who can do what she wills with it so
does a Christ-rejecting world lie helpless in the lap of Satan, and he does
what he wills with it, always with this qualification, however, he can only
act in so far as God permits. For, while it is true that Satan is the Prince
of the power of the air, and the god of this world, or age, yet God the
Creator, is supreme, and HIS Kingdom is over all, and in due time He will
manifest it by showing who is the ?Blessed and only Potentate, the King
of kings, and Lord of lords.? When He shall give to the man Christ Jesus
whom the nations at present reject, all the kingdoms of this world to
reign over.
SATAN?S OFFER TO CHRIST.
Satan anticipated this by offering this to Christ without His going the
way of the cross- It was in Satan?s power to do it. He told our Lord so
and our Lord did not contradict him, for, after showing Him all the king-
doms of this world, Satan said: ?All this power will I give thee, and the
of them, for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I
give it. If thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine ? But He
the perfectly obedient One, refused the tempting offer. He could afford
to bide His Father?s time, and although it meant the way of the cross, still
He saw the glory beyond, and so Pie endured the shame of the cross, and is
now, at this moment that I speak these words to you, at the right hand of
the throne of God. And He waits the exact moment when the times are
completed for Him to enter into all His possessions, the possessions that
are His by the rights of creation and redemption. Well might He be able
to say: ?The prince of this world cometh, but hath nothing in me ? He
the enemy, could find nothing he could touch that belonged to him there
was no flaw in Him. ?
SATAN?S DESIGNS.
Satan having achieved the disobedience of mankind at the beginning
has been at work ever since to captivate the hearts of men entirely away
fi om God, just as Absalom captivated the hearts of the people away from
David, their rightful king, his father, the story of which is an excellent
illustration of what Satan has done with mankind with regard to their
rightful King. On more than one occasion has his success been so great
that the witnesses for God have been reduced to a minimum At the end
of the first millennium he had prevailed to such an extent that God in
3


judgment destroyed all but one family, consisting of eight persons in all.
Later on, when men again began to multiply, we have another record of
the perversity of the human race again calling forth God?s judgment by
His confounding their language. You will find that story in the eleventh
chapter of Genesis. And so on down the course of time, as nations were
formed Satan took charge, and working in company with his hosts of
wicked spirits, demons, he lulled nation after nation on to their ruin, God,
nevertheless, always intervening and restraining until the cup of iniquity
was full, before men and nations were completely handed over to Satan.
No one can carefully read the thirty-first and the thirty-second chapters of
Ezekiel without being struck with the awful fact that men and nations
all make for the one way?the way of death and destruction, and that in
due time all, without exception, find their true abode ?the abode of the
finally impenitent and rebellious.
GOD CHOOSES A NATION.
At a certain period of the world?s history God chose a nation through
whom He could specially manifest His glory, power, and grace. He not
only chose this nation, but in a very special way formed it. The story of
the Jewish people is a wonderful record on the one hand of God?s almighty
power and loving care, and on the other hand of the exceeding weakness
and depravity of the human heart. Even with THIS nation Satan secured
a pronounced victory, though his triumph is but temporary. Again and
again he deceived them and led them astray, so that God had to cast them
off, at least for the time being. It was His purpose that through this nation
all the nations of the earth should be blest. One part of that purpose has
indeed been fulfilled in the coming of Christ, the Suffering Messiah, the
Saviour of the world. The other part yet remains to he accomplished,
which it will be when Christ comes again as the Glorious Messiah, the
Triumphant King of Israel, through Whom the whole earth will be ruled
in absolute justice and equity. Satan will then be bound so that he CAN-
NOT deceive the nations, and peace will reign throughout the world. That
time is not far distant, I can assure you. But, and mark this, and oh, do
please heed it: while that time of universal peace is not far distant, I
solemnly declare to you from the authority of God?s Word that before that
time does come, this world will pass through a time of trouble and anguish
such as it has never yet known. Now, I do not wish to go beyond that
which is revealed, but I only state my firm conviction when I say that the
majority of you who make up my audience to-night will live to pass
through that time of awful trial unless you make sure of being taken out
from it by fully yielding yourselves to Christ and accepting Him as your
Saviour and Lord. I may again refer to this if time permits, but just now
I must continue to deal with Satan?s power over the nations, and so bring
our subject up to this present day of almost world-wide war.
A PEEP BEHIND THE SCENES.
It is not often that God lifts the curtain and permits men to see what
is taking place behind the scenes. While here, men are called to live by
FAITH in the all-sustaining power and goodness of their Creator. Still,
God does sometimes draw aside the veil that hides the invisible from us,
and gives us a view of the activities of spirit beings. The most striking
instance of this is given in the last chapter of the Ist Book of Kings. It
is an instance full of suggestion to the sanctified imagination. Ahab, the
king of Israel, was nearing his end. We are told that he had sold himself
to do evil, and so when his iniquity had reached its limit, God permitted
the forces of evil to have their way with him, and induce him to go to war
against Syria, and thus bring about his downfall and death. His false,
demon-possessed prophets, no less than four hundred of them, all pre-
dicted victory for him, and advised his going to war. But to Micaiah, the
one solitary true prophet of Jehovah, was given the revelation of what was
taking place in the spirit world, unseen by men. And so his God-sent
message to Ahab was: ?Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw
the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven standing by
Him on His right hand and on His left. And the Lord said, ?Who shall
persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one
said on this manner, and another said on that manner. And there came
forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said: ?I will persuade him.?
And the Lord said: ?Wherewith?? And he said, T will go forth and be a
lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.? And He said: ?Thou shalt
persuade him, and prevail also; go forth and do so.? ?
From this it will be seen that this war which ended so disastrously for
i


Ahab was set in motion in the heaveniies. Ahab had been the tool of Satan
and the catspaw of a Satanic woman, Jezebel. And although God had suf-
fered him for a long time, and had given him wonderful opportunities to
repent, yet he repented not fully, though on one occasion he did humble
himself before God. Still, his perversity carried him on to ruin.
This incident shows the machinations of the hosts of evil, but it also
shows that God rules over all, and that He makes provision for every
failure of men as individuals, and also nations, so that ultimately His
purposes will not be frustrated, but every iota of His counsel concerning
the world shall be accomplished.
EARTH?S GREAT MONARCHIES.
When God cast aside the Jewish nation, He brought it about by the
great king Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty monarch of Babylon. Nebuchad-
nezzar, after making two previous assaults against Jerusalem, finally com-
pleted its destruction about the year 587 8.C., burning it with fire, taking
captive all the inhabitants except a few of the very poorest of the land.
Prom this time begins a new era in God?s governmental dealings with the
world. No longer could He deal with the nations through His chosen
people. Now begins what is termed in Scripture ?The Times of the Gen-
tiles,? the end of which will take place at the coming again of Christ.
Nebuchadnezzar?s kingdom of Babylon was the first of FOUR great world-
empires that mark this period, the times of the Gentiles. It was during his
reign that God revealed the beginning and the ending of Gentile rule.
In the first Epistle to the Corinthians and the fourth verse (see mar-
gin), we have a reference to this time, under the term ?Man?s Day,? mean-
ing man?s judgment or rule. Contrast this with that word in the 13th
verse of the preceding chapter, where we have the Day of Christ distinctly
referred to. I, of course, cannot refer at length to this, but I simply say,
in passing, that ?The Times of THE Gentiles? mean that God is NOT dur-
ing this period working DIRECTLY in the affairs of men, though, of
course, He is doing so INdirectly, as we have already seen. Men are now
left to their own devices, and if they do not willingly come under the rule
of God they are under the control of Satan and the powers at his com-
mand. When Christ came nineteen hundred years ago, it is true an oppor-
tunity was given to bring this ?Rule of the Gentiles? to an end. He came
and offered Himself to His own chosen people, the Jews, and although
they were looking, and indeed longing, for their Messiah and Deliverer to
come, yet they were so given over to the wiles of the enemy, Satan, that
they knew Him not, and so the King was cast out, both Jew and Gentile,
the Religious and Political powers casting Him out, deliberately intimating
that they would not have this Man to rule over them. And so Gentile
rule, or Man?s Day, continues. God, however, here commenced a new
thing again. He is now carrying on a SPECIAL work in the world by
gathering to Himself a People out of all the nations, kindreds, and
tongues. This People is the TRUE Church of Christ, which will be com-
pleted and removed from the world some seven years, or a little more,
before the end of ?THE TIMES OP THE GENTILES.? '
A WONDERFUL DREAM.
The history of these great monarchies up to the present is a revela-
tion of man?s almost but Complete surrender to Satan ?wars, calamities,
and the almost unceasing persecuting of the truly godly has been the order
of the day, and is so at this present moment. Satan and his hosts of wicked
spirits are the forces behind this war, as all others during this reign of
man. Men talk about the improvement of the race by a process of evolu-
tion. If ever the powers of darkness deceived men along any line, it is
certainly along this one. Evolution! Improvement! Listen: God gave to
this first great monarch, Nebuchadnezzar, a dream. In his dream he saw
a great image, in the form of a huge man. This image?s head was of fine
gold, his breast and arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his
legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. The interpretation of
this dream was given to a Hebrew captive, Daniel, a godly youth. This
dream was given to show Nebuchadnezzar that he was the first of four
great world-empires, he being the head of gold, thus signifying that he
would be the greatest of all in the estimation of God. His kingdom was
an absolute autocracy. Whom he would he slew, and whom he would he
kept alive. He had no need to consult anyone, unless he so desired. This
is God?s form of government, despite men?s talk about democracy. The
make-up of this image of Nebuchadnezzar?s dream shows a continual de-
-5 ,


clension, until finally in the feet we have iron mixed with clay, indicating
a limited monarchy mixed with democracy. What a come-down from
pure gold to clay! Monarchy and democracy may mix, as we see, but they
can never CLEAVE to each other. And although the now much-talked of
League of Nations will assuredly come to pass, and there will be a mixture
of monarchy with democracy, yet it will only be temporary. There can
be no real harmony?they cannot blend mutually.
Here again in this we have another of Satan?s schemes revealed. God
has told us that this will be the outcome of Man?s Rule in the nations,
and He permits it, but it is not His desire or way. Vox populi is not vox
Dei. The voice of the people is seldom, if indeed ever, the voice of God.
France thought the voice of the people was the voice of the supreme and
the ultimate some years ago, but France as a nation had ruled God out.
Even at the beginning of this war it is reported that her then Premier
said something like this: ?We have blotted out the light of the heavens,
and we have ended God?s interference with the affairs of France.? This
blasphemy was hailed by the French Senate as something so splendid that
they ordered this portion of their Premier?s speech to be placarded
throughout France. This was French Democracy. This was the voice of
the people at the commencement of this present war. It is to be hoped
that the scourge of war has somewhat altered the voice of Britain?s Ally.
But has it? Who can tell? Be that as it may. Can we expect God to keep
continually quiet? Will puny man continue to laugh in the face of his
Creator and mock Him, and God not take notice? Well might God reveal
to His servant Daniel in a vision the very same period of time as that
revealed to Nebuchadnezzar, but with this great difference: Instead of
these great Gentile kingdoms being representd as a man, as in Nebuchad-
dream, he being the representative of Man?s government, Daniel
the representative of God among men, had a vision of four great wild
beasts, beasts that destroy and devour. Man thinks himself fine, and that
by this process of evolution I have mentioned he will reach higher and
higher stages of greatness. But what does God see? God sees a process
of DEvolution, and sums up the whole rule and conduct of men and nations
as bestial. iSatan deludes men into the belief that by modern culture and
civilisation they will ultimately make a paradise of this earth. God says
that man, even at his best state, ?is altogether vanity.? And so
THE SPIRIT OF ERROR
which, all down the ages has been working in the children of disobedience,
is now so working as to bring matters to a crisis. War? It is impossible
that there could be anything else but war with these spirit forces at work
as they are at present amongst men. Satan knows what is taking place in
the heavenly regions. He knows that it is about time for him to quit for
ever that favoured region where he has so much liberty, even to getting
into the presence of God, and accuse the saints of God, which is one of his
chief delights. The place he now inhabits is soon to be occupied by these
very saints, and he knows it. Moreover, he knows the kingdoms of this
world are about to be wrested from him, hence his great activity, for what
is now taking place on this earth is but a reflection of what is going on
above. The activities among men are just the counterpart to the activities
in the spirit world. The Powers of Righteousness are now being arrayed
against the powers of evil, preparatory to the final conflict of this age.
On every hand we see men banding themselves together. They feel
that unity is strength, and that the trend of affairs necessitates the coming
together of those who have a common interest. On the one hand we have
those who hold the wealth and places of position uniting with each other
for the very purpose of retaining what they have. They well know that
there are forces at work that if not combated will wrench this wealth and
position from them. On the other hand there is, and has been, a uniting
of those who feel that they are more than mere pawns in the game of life,
and that if hitherto they have been considered so by those more favourably
situated, it shall be so no longer, and they are now determined to receive
a greater share of the good things that are only made possible by their
efforts. Neither may individuals refrain from being a part of these unions
and combinations. If he be a master or an employee it matters not, he
only keeps aloof at the cost of his own interest. Where, then, does 'the
child of God find his place? A true, intelligent child of God cannot pos-
sibly unite with any of these combines of ungodlv people. It is of course
6


true that large numbers of Christians are attached to these various or-
ganisations on both sides, but that is only because of their ignorance or
wilful disobedience; they are afraid that they will suffer loss, so they
lend themselves to the world, and take it easy. Well, I know it is a diffi-
cult position, but believe me, they who do so will suffer greater loss when
they appear before the Master ttuy profess to serve. However, lam glad
to say there are some of God?s children beginning to see what is at work,
and they are taking their stand. Here is one instance;
THE TYRANNY OF MEN.
A friend of mine, who until recently was engaged in the Postal Depart-
ment, refused to join himself with the other employees in the same branch
of the service in forming a union. Some time ago this union took a claim
for an increase in wages before the Wages Board, with the result that
they secured an increase of some �25 per year. My friend, however, re-
ceived no increase, though his neighbour at his side, doing the very same
work as he, had received an increase of some 10/- per week. When my
friend made inquiry as to why he was not paid the same as others doing
the same work as he, he was told that because he was not a member of the
union he was not entitled to the increase. Now this may be sound reason-
ing from the human standpoint, but it certainly takes away a man?s liberty.
My friend, however, had backbone, or I should rather say he had sufficient
of the Grace of God to refuse the alternative, and he stood firm. He is
now out of that employ, God saw he was true, and He called him to fully
give his time to His service. There are those, however, who will not be
given employment unless they first join a Union. This brings the child of
God into a position that calls for great courage. Nevertheless, if he re-
mains faithful to the Word of God, the God Whom he obeys will open up a
way for him somehow until his work be finished.
Again, take the case of those who occupy positions similar to that
which I occupied until recently. In this case there is no need to become
a member of an association of either masters or employees. This class is
paid by results, and although there are associations among them having as
their objects the social and general weal of their members, still it is not
necessary to attach one?s self to them. These men are paid by results,
they are what is called ?business-getters,? and they embrace all classes
of commercial travellers and the like. Now these men must, they simply
MUST, secure business for their firms or companies to retain their sala-
ries. If they work for themselves on a pure commission basis they must
secure orders in order for them to secure a living. This is one of the best
possible avenues of employment a man can engage in, providing he has the
necessary qualifications. But, and here is where the Christian man is placed
at a decided disadvantage, it is almost impossible to' secure decent living-
business to-day in a straightforward way. The bribery, and the giving of
illicit commissions in order to secure decently large business is rampant
on every hand. The child of God cannot, of course, secure business in any
such manner. If he does, it is at a corresponding loss hereafter. Christian
men are, for these and other reasons that I cannot bring forward just
now, finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet in ordinary
avenues of business and employment. All this is taking place in this very
city of Sydney, and is the result of the working of the spirit of error in the
children of disobedience. The spirit of war is right here. If you have but
eyes to see you can see it on every hand. Transport the very spirit of
error which is right here at our doors, and which is manifested in greed,
self-seeking, lying, the cant and humbug of present-day leaders in all
walks of life, the determination to be ?on top,? no matter at whose cost.
I say transport this very spirit over to the fields of Flanders and else-
where where this frightful War is raging in the most diabolical forms,
never before imagined amongst men, and it will simply say to you: ?This
is nothing new, the spirits behind this war are akin to myself. I only
need to find the occasion for this, and it becomes part of my very nature
to do these things. My lord, Satan, does not require my services here. He
has sufficient helpers to carry on his mighty work here; but I must return
to Sydney and prepare for more of this, yes, and even worse.?
THE CLIMAX BEING RE ACHED.
That the world is reaching a climax for good or evil every observant per-
son can see. But it is only the FAITHFUL and OBEDIENT child of God
that knows the end of it all. He knows that this age will end in a fearful
catastrophe of all that men count dear. It is all plainly revealed in this


book I hold in my hand, the Bible. One of the greatest evidences that the
climax is being reached is the fact which I have just drawn your attention
to, namely, that the true Christian ?for there are countless scores of so-
called Christians, though they are not TRUE Christians ?is finding it in-
creasingly difficult to find a footing in these very cities that take upon
them the name of Christian cities. When the climax is reached, and our
Lord sees we can no longer remain here, He will remove us all before the
deluge of trouble is ushered in. Their removal will make the way clear
for Satan's Masterpiece, the MAN of sin, the Antichrist. A man like you
and I, only possessed with the spirit of Satan without measure. Just as
the MAN Christ Jesus was possessed by the Spirit of God without
measure. Christ is God?s Man. The Antichrist is Satan?s man. The
whole spirit world is now preparing for the reception of God?s servants.
It is also preparing the world for the reception of the servants of Satan,
spirit beings who will be cast out of their heavenly abode to make still
more close contact with men. The present-day world-wide censorship is of
such a nature that a little w r hile ago would have been thought impossible
in democratic countries. Suppressing of the truth in lands like this of
Australia, where, until recently, it was the boast of the people that ?The
freedom of speech was one of their bulwarks.? The fixing of prices by
the Governments, the combination of businesses and industries under
one huge control?all these indicate the approaching climax. I have
nothing to say to the right or the wrong of these things. It is the out-
come of the wisdom of this world to meet the pressing situation. And I
need say no more than that God has already done, and will yet make the
wisdom of the world foolish. I am mentioning these facts to prove my
statement that the way is being paved for the appearance of Satan?s man,
the Antichrist. The world wants a ruler. The world is going to g'et one,
and it will be in this Satanic person, who will ultimately bring about the
great Armageddon.
THE WORLD?S PEACE,
I want to read to you a short extract from a newspaper cutting re-
porting a speech made by the Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. Lloyd George,
on the entrance of America into the war, nearly eighteen months ago, and
concerning a Peace Conference which he then hoped would be held soon.
These are the one or two statements he made that I want to read to you:
?The Peace Conference will settle the destiny of nations, and the course
of human life for countless years. I see peace coming now?a real peace
which the.world has never known. . . . To-morrow, and perhaps a not far-
distant to-morrow, war may be abolished from the category of human
crimes. . , . Our gallant soldiers are heralds of that dawn, and the Allies
will soon emerge into the full and perfect day.?
Mr. Lloyd George, speaking out of a full heart, gives his inmost wish
expression to in this manner. I believe the Prime Minister at one time
took an important part in Christian work. Be that as it may, he does
not know the Christian?s Guide, the Bible, very well, or he would never
speak like that. His statements are totally opposed to (Scripture. If the
Prime Minister be true, then it will be wise to arrange accordingly for
this time of universal and lasting peace. If the Bible be true, you had
better arrange things differently.
I am here to advise you, not as a politician, but as a messenger dele-
gated by the Court of Heaven, to believe the Bible statement that there
will be no lasting peace until the Prince of Peace comes to reign. There
will be no Perfect Day until the Perfect King comes. Be wise. See to it
that you crown that One King and Lord of your life now. Believe me,
this present war, which probably will shortly end now, is but the prelude
to the greatest war this world will ever know, when the forces of righte-
ousness will engage the forces of evil, and triumph completely. Many
things connected with this war have indicated to me that it is a true type
of Armageddon, but my time is gone, and I cannot go into that now. In
a closing word I warn you who are still rejecting Christ of the awful
times ahead for you, and as an ambassador of Christ I beseech you in
His behalf: Be ye reconciled to God.* The way is clear. God has made
every provision for you to return to Him. If you deliberately refuse, oh,
what will you do without Plim when there is no help to be found in the
time of your dire distress, and He Himself turns His back upon you?
Anticipate that time, and make provision for it by accepting Christ now.
