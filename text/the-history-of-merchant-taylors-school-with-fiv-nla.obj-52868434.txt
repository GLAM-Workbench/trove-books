THE
HISTORY*
OF
MERCHANT-TAYLORS’ SCHOOL.
IN the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, towards the close of
the year 1560, or in the beginning of the spring of 1561, the Merchant-
Taylors’ Company conceived the design of founding a Grammar School;
and part of the Manor of the Roset, in the parish of St. Laurence Pountney
(a mansion which had successively belonged to the t Duke of Buckingham,
the Marquis of Exeter, and the Earls of Sussex), seeming suitable to their
generous purpose, Mr. Richard Hills, a leading member of the court, with
corresponding liberality, contributed the sum of five hundred pounds towards
the purchase of it: but the institution was not thoroughly organized until
September 24, 1561, on which day the statutes were framed, and a school-
master chosen.
* I should be guilty of great injustice towards the Rev. Dr. Wilson, late second
under-master of Merchant-Taylors’ School, were I to omit acknowledging the assistance
which I have received from his work on the same subject; to which the reader is
referred, who is desirous of more extensive information than this work, from its limits,
can possibly give.

treason, in the reign of Henry the Eighth.

At a court, attended by about fourteen members, the following statutes
were agreed upon, which are here given without any variation in orthography
or matter. The wisdom, benevolence, and unaffected piety herein displayed,
reflect the highest honour on the generous framers. Important variations
will be noticed in their respective places; as from the lapse of ages, and
difference of customs, some have become obsolete, some, of necessity, repealed.
Statutes.
Whereas, The maister, wardens, and assistents, in the names of all the whole body
of this company of the Marchaunt-Taylors, in London, have for the better educacon and
bringing up of children in good manners and Frature, erected a schoole within the
parish of St. Lawrence Pountney, in London; and also, meete and convenient lodgings
for a schoolin' and three ushers, to inhabite and dwell in; And for because nothing
can contynue long and endure in good order without lawes and statuts, in that behalf
provided, therefore, they, the said maister, wardens, and assistents, have fully concluded,
agreed, and decreed, and by these presents doe conclude, agree, and decree, that the
said schoole shall be directed and contynued, and to have contynuaunce, by God’s grace,
for ever, in such manner and forme, and according as hereafter is expressly mencioned,
and declared, viz.
Capitulum primum de magistro primario.
I. In the grammar-school, founded in the parish of St. Laurence-Pountney, in
London, in the yere of our Lord God one thowsand, fyve hundred, sixty-one, by this
worshipfull company of the Marchaunt-Taylors, of the Citty of London, in the honor
of Christ Jesu, shalbe first, an HIGH MAISTER*. This high maister in doctrine,
learning, and teaching, shall direct all the schoole. This maister shalbe chosen by the
right worshipful the maister, wardens, and assistents, of the said company of Marchaunt-
Taylors, with such advise & counsell of welle learned men as they can gett; a man in
body whole, sober, discreete, honest, verteous, & learned, in good & cleane Latine
Frature, &, also, in Greeke, yf such may be gotten-f-. A wedded man, a single man, or

a priest, that hath noe benefice, with cure, office, nor service, that may lett his dew
business in the schoole.
11. This high maister so being chosen, as aforesaid, shall have his charge given to
him by the m'r & wardeins of the said company, for the tyme being, then being present
in the said schoole, saying to him on this wise, or such like in effect.
Sir, we have chosen you to be chief maister & teacher of this schoole, to teach the
children of the same, not only good I'rature but also good manners, certifying you, that
this is noe roome of contynuence & perpetuity, but upon the doing of your duty in the
schoole. And every yere when as the m'r, wardens, & assistaunts, shalbe assembled in
the schoole howse, concerning the visitation thereof, you shall submytt you to their
examinacon, and, found doing your duty accordingly, you shall contynewe, otherwise,
reasonably warned, you shall content you to departe, And, ye, of your party, not warned
of us, but of your owne mynde in any reason willing to departe, ye shall give us warning
twelve monethes before, without we can shortlyer be well provided of an other to supply
your roome.
Also being maister ye shall not be absent from the said school above twenty working
dayes in the year, which also shalbe (coniunctim or divisim) without some urgent cause,
and good consideracons shall move the surveyors of the said schoole for the tyme being
to graunt a further tyme of absence, and that the chief usher nor under ushers be not
then absent from the schoole.
111. And yf the chosen maister will promise this, then admytt him & name him to that
office, & stall him in his seate in the schoole, & shew him his howse or lodging on the
south side of the schoole. And they shall deliver him all the implements of that howse
by indenture.
IV. And that howse and lodgings he shall have free without payment of any rent, &
in this lodging he shall dwell and keepe howshold to his power. Hee shall nor have,
nor teach, at one tyme within the foresaid schoole, nor ells where, above the number of
two hundreth & ffyfty schollers. And he shall not refuse to take, receave, and teach in
the said schoole freely one hundreth schollers, parcell of the said number of two
hundreth & ffyfty schollers, being poore men’s sonnes and coming thether to be taught,
(yf such be meete & apt to learne,) without any thing to be paid by the parents of the
said one hundreth poore children for their instruction & learnyng.
V. And he shall also receave and teache in the said schoole ffyfty schollers more, being
numerous, observes, that “ some attempts were made to revive the study of Hebrew, but not with
the same success,” (History of Great Britain, vol. vi. p. 542.) which may account for the silence of
the statutes with regard to the sacred language. There is neither statute nor order of court that
prescribes ability to teach Hebrew as a qualification for the high mastership; but, as far as can be
discovered, Mulcaster and all his successors have taught it, and, in many instances, with considerable
success.


an other parcel! of the said number of two hundreth and ffyfty schollers comyng thether
to be taught, & being found apte and meete to learne, as aforesaid, and being poore
men’s children, so that their poore parents, or other their friends, will pay and give to
the high m*r for their instruction & learning after two shillings & twopence by the quarter
for a peece of them*.
VI. And he shall alsoreceave & teach in the said schoole, one other hundreth more
of schollers being the residue of the said number of two hundreth and ffyfty schollers
coming thether to be taught, & being also found apte and meete to learne, as aforesaid,
being rich or meane men’s children, so that their parents or other friends will give for
every of these hundreth schollers fyve shillings by the quarter for their instruction &
learning.
VII. Yf the maister be sick of a sickness curable, yet nevertheless it is meete that the
chief usher, for the tyme that the m~r is so sick, shall doe his best endeavour to direct
all the schoole, as the duty of the m~r was to have done. The said usher to his power
to doe his own duty as he did before neverthelesse.
VIII. There shalbe also one chief usher, some sober, discreete man, verteous in
lyving, & well learned, that shall teach under the schoolemr as the schoolemr shall
appoint him, some single or wedded man, or a priest that hath noe benefice with cure,
office, nor service, that may lett his due dilligence in the schoole.
IX. And yf the said chief ussher be in I'rature,discretion, & honest lief, according,
then the high maister his roome being vacant, lett him be chosen before another.
X. This ussher shall the high maister choose as often as the roome shalbe void'f", a
man whole in body. And when the high mr hath appointed him upon one, the high
maister shall call to the schoole the surveyors of the schoole, & before them he shall say
to the ussher in this wise.
Sir, before these my maisters here, thesurveyors of the schoole, I shew unto you that
I have chosen you to be the chief ussher or under m“rj of this schoole, & to teach all-
* This and the following statute were altered by the order of the court, (9th of April, 1805,)
which confirmed the report of the committee, that, on account of the alteration in the value of money
since the institution of the school, it was expedient that the quarterage (exclusive of the breaking-
up-money) should be raised to ten shillings.
f The company soon found it necessary to reserve to themselves the appointment of the under-
teachers, and by so doing they rendered their situations more acceptable to men of talent and
respectability.
% The first usher, according to the original foundation of the school, had an evident superiority
over the other two, who were, both in rank and salary, on an equality with each other; and this
continued for a number of years: but, at length, when the principle of succession began to be acted
upon, the third was placed as much below the second as the second already was below the first.
Though usher and under-master were from the first synonymous terms, (as in the statute before
us,) the former was originally in more general use, till circumstances arising that rendered it


waies, from tyme to tyme, as I shall appoint you, & supply my roome in xny absence when
it shalbe graunted me by my maisters, the said maisters & wardens, & also, at all such
tymes as I shalbe sick of any curable disease. .
XL Then the said mr & wardens shall exhort the ussher dilligently to doe his duty,
& shall say unto him on this wise: Your roome is noe perpetuity, but, according to your
labor & dilligence, you shall contynue; otherwise, fownd not doing your duty accordingly,
& reasonably warned of us, ye shall departe.
Yf it shalbe so that at any tyme you will departe of your owne mynd, yee shall give us
one yere’s warning before your departure.
Yf any controversy be between you and the high m~r yee shall stand at our direction
in every thing.
XII. And yf he will promise this, Then let the said m~r & wardens approve the eleccon
of the said ussher, & assigne him his lodging on the north side of the schoole next unto
the gate there alowe.
XIII. He shalbe absent in all the yere not above twenty working daies, which shalbe
(coniunctim or divisim) without that some urgent cause, or good consideracon, shall
move the surveyors of the saide schoole for the tyme being to graunt him a further
tyme of absence, & that the high m~r nor underusshers be not then also absent from the
said schoole.
XIV. In sicknes curable, or axes *, or such sicknes for a tyme he shalbe 'tollerated &
have his full wages, although that, during the tyme of such curable sicknes, the high m~r,
with that help of the underusshers, shall to the uttermost of their powers, instruct &
teach all the schollers within the said schoole withall dilligence, as the duty of the ussher
was to have done, the high mr & the underusshers to their power to doe their owne duty
as they did before neverthelesse.
XV. YfFboth the maister & the usshers be sick at once (as God defend) then let the
schoole cease for that while.
XVI. Yff there be such sicknes contagious in the Cytty, that the schoole cannot con-
tynue, then both the maister & the usshers must have patience in such a case.
XVII. Neither the maister nor usshers shall take office of proctorshipp, or any such
mynistery, service, or other busines, which shall lett their dilligence & their necessary
labor in the schoole. Yf they doe &be warned lawfully, yf they will not cease from such
service, office, or busines, then let them be warned to departe.
expedient to distinguish foundation-ushers from those who were retained and dismissed at the
pleasure of the principal master, the old name began to he laid aside in most of the publick schools.
At Westminster in particular, the foundation-usher has long been called under-master to distinguish
him from those assistant-teachers whose services are called for in that school. (See Maitland’s ,
History of London, vol. ii. p. 12 77.)
* Agues, as in Chaucer..


XVIII. Let the schoolenfr see that the schoole, with the court and the streete, by all
the length of the same, be kept clean e & sweete every Satterday, & also the leads, &, from
tyme to tyme, to call upon the worship full Marchaunt-Taylors for necessary reparacons,
& lett none of the children, at any tyme, come up to the leads to the upper dore, of the
which at the topp of the winding stayers of stone on high, there shalbe allwaies two
keyes, to be kept by the high maister, and the other key by the chief ussher.
XIX. There shalbe also in the said schoole two underusshers, some good, honest, and
verteous learned young men. And they shalbe chosen from tyme to tyme, by the hi<di
m'r, & they shall also help to teach in the schoole, as to the maister shall seeme convenient,
& none otherwise*.
XX. They shall have noe benifice with cure, occupation, office, or service, nor any
other faculty which may lett their dilligent teaching at the schoole, but they shall attend
only upon the schoole, and they shall teach the children, yf neede be, the Catechisme,
and instruccons of the Articles of the Faith, and the Tenn Commaundements in Latin;
(that is to say) such a Catechisme as shalbe approved by the Queenes Ma‘ r that now is,
& by the Honorable Court of Parliament of this realme from tyme to tyme.
XXI. Their lodgings and chambers shalbe in the middle roomes where as the dore
is made out under the schoole neere to the middest of the foresaid long court or greate
yard.
XXII. They shall not have their roomes by writing or by seale in hoe wise, but at
lib'ty according to their deserving, & only so long as the high m“r shall like their demeaner
& teaching.
XXIII. Their absence shalbe but once in the yere only, yf yt be needefull, & only as
it shall seeme best to the mir and wardens, with the consent of the high maister, & high
ussher being present, and not absent from the schoole.
XXIV. Yf they fall to unthriftines & behavior after lawfull warning let them be
avoided, & other chosen within viii dayes after, or as soone after as can be by the said
surveyors, but not without the consent of the high rnr & ussher.
XXV. There shalbe taught in the said schoole children of all nations & countryes
indifferently-f, comyng thether to be taught, to the number of two hundreth & fyfty, in
manner & forme as is afore devised & appointed. But first see that they can the
catechisme in English or Latyn, & that every of the said two hundreth & fyfty
schollers can read perfectly & write competently, or els lett them not be admytted in no
wise.
XXVI. And that every scholler at his first admyssion, once for ever, shall pay twelve
pence for wryting in of his name, & the same shalbe given to such one, as shalbe ap-
pointed by the said high m r & the surveyors to sweepe the schoole, & keepe the court

of the schoole cleane, & see the streete nigh to the schoole gate clensed of all manner of
ordure, caryon, or other fylthy or uncleane things, out of good order, or extraordynarily
there throwne*.
XXVII. The children shall come to the schoole in the mornyng at seaven of the
clock both winter & somer, & tarry there untill eleaven, & returne againe at one of the
clock, and departe at five-f; and thrice in the day, kneeling on their knees, they shall
say the prayers appointed with due tract and pawsing, as they be, or shalbe hereafter
conteyned in a table sett up in the schoole, (that is to say) in the morning, at noone, &
at evening.
XXVIII. In the schoole at noe tyme of the yere, they shall use tallow candle in noe
wise, but wax candles only.
XXIX. Also lett them bring no meate, nor drinck, nor bottles, nor use in the schoole
no breakfasts, nor drincking in the tyme of learning in no wise. If they need drinck,
then lett it be provided in some other place.
XXX. Nor lett them use noe cock-fighting, tennys-play, nor riding about of victoring,
nor disputing abroade, which is but foolish babling & losse of tyme.
XXXI. Lett not the schoolemaister, head ussher, nor the under-usshers, nor any of
them, permytt nor lycence their schollers, to have remedy or leave to play, except only
once in the weeke, when there falleth noe holliday. And those remedies to be had
upon noe other dayes only, but only upon the Twesdayes in the afternoone, or Thurs-
dayes at afternoone J.
XXXII. And yf there shall happen to be kept one or more hollydayes in the weeke,
that then in every such weeke there be noe remedyes nor leave to play granted.
XXXIII. Unto their uryne the schollers shall goe to the places appointed them in
the lane or streete without the court, & for other causes, yf neede be, they shall goe to
the water-side.
XXXIV. Yf any childe, after he is receaved & admytted into the said schoole, goe to
any other schoole to learne theire, (after the manner of that schoole) or shalbe absent
* It appears, by an extract from the will of Sir Thomas Rowe, in the Antiquarian Repertory,
vol. iii. p. 227, that he left to the Merchant-Taylors' Company “£6 : 1 3:4 towards the advance-
ment of the free-school that they have well begun, and to the intent they shall free the scolars and
their parents from paying any thing for sweeping the scoleand, in consequence of this, the
sweeper of the school, though a servant of the foundation, is paid, as well as appointed, by the
high master; but the entrance-money has been raised from time to time, till it was fixed, by a
recent order of court, at forty shillings.
t The boys do not come to school till eight in the morning from the Ist of November to the
Ist of March.—The morning business is still concluded at eleven; but, in the afternoon, the school
does not open till two and closes for the day at four: the last order to this effect was on April 27,
1809.
% This and the following statute superseded by orders of court.
D


from the schoole, by the space of three weekes togeather, at any one tyme, without
sickness, or any other reasonable lett, shalbe the cause of the said lett, that then in such
case it were best that such a childe, for no man’s suit, shalbe thereafter receaved into our
schoole, but goe where him list, & where his friends shall thincke. there shalbe better
learnyng. And this is good to be shewed to his frends, or other that offer him at his first
presenting into the schoole *. :
XXXV. The maister, wardens, & assistants of this company, for the tyme being, shall
yerely for ever make their assembly or apparaunce in the councell-howse, or late chap-
pell, scituate on the south side of the long court or yard of the schoole, they being- then
& thete accompanied with such well-learned men as they can gett conveniently. Which
said m~r, wardens, & assistints, with thadvice of the same learned men shall examyne.&
try whether the mV & usshers shall have taught and done their duties in the said schoole,
according as is before devised & appointed, & alsoe to try & examyne howe the children
have profited under them, & fynding them to have done their duties to be comended, &
finding otherwise to be speedely reformed & amended according as to their wise discretions
shalbe thought convenient.
XXXVI. And to that intent & effect that the same assembly of the said maister,
wardens, & assistents, may be made yerely for ever at the schoole, for the good con-
siderations afore mentioned, the comon clarck of this ■ mistery now being, and his suc-
cessors'which for the tyme shalbe, shall once in the yere yerely for evermore,. at a
quarter-day, to be howlden within this our comon-hall, reade openly all & every such
acts, decrees, & ordynaunces,- or the more parte of them as is before made & devised, or
shalbe hereafter made & devised by the said mV, wardens,. & assistants, or their suc-
cessors, for and concerning only the ordering & contynuance of the said schoole in good
order, so that thereby they may have the same the better in remembrance forever in tyme
to come.
XXXVII. And that the mV & wardens of this company for the tyme being, and also
all such as shall have borne the roome of a maister of this mistery, (except such as shall
have borne the room & place of an alderman & sherif of this mistery) shall be for ever in
tyme to come called, & be the surveyors of the said schoole, and they from tyme to tyme
shall take upon them the charge & oversight of the said schoole, to see that in the said

* The qualifications of the surveyors, and the times of their visiting the school, most
materially altered by the “ orders of the school’s probation,” January 14, 1607.
“ It is thought meete that this probation of the whole schoole shalbee committed unto the
honest and faithfull trust and disposition of the m~r of the schoole and the three ushers alone, with-
out any association, for these three causes: Ffirst, the /Founders have good experience of their
faithfull governement, and assured confidence of their care,of this trust reposed uppon them.
Secondly, this triall of the schollers being made by an act oncly in writeing, it is without doubt
that strange assembly will but hinder them in their said exercises. Thirdly, the watchfull eye of
the mr and the 3 ushers onely wilbee sufficient to make the boyes the more serious and earnest in
their work, and cause every boye’s act to bee entirely his owne worke without any help ; whereas,
yf further assembly were, this probacon could not by the m~r and the three ushers bee so carefully
attended, neither the schollers worke be so heedefully and dutifully intended and done by them
as it should.”
t The school having been rebuilt after the fire of London without a fire-place, this statute
became a dead letter, till a fire-place was recently made in consequence of an order of court, (20th
of December, 1810,) and “the greate cellor,” the rent of which was to have paid for the fuel,
having been previously granted to the master, the company voted an annual supply of five chaldrons
of coals at their expense.

The statutes being thus agreed upon, and the whole plan matured and
organized, their next care was to appoint a high master to superintend the,
as yet, infant establishment. In this they were not long undecided; their
choice fell upon Richard Mulcaster, at that time of Christ Church, Oxford,
a man of extensive research and high literary attainments. To him, there-
fore, the mastership was offered by the court, and almost immediately
accepted.
The munificence of Mr. Hills, the master of the company, secured the
services of Mulcaster; for, as the emoluments of the situation were but a
slender recompense to such commanding talents as he possessed, the addi-
tional sum of ten pounds per annum was promised him by the master.
The rapid influx of scholars fully proved the wisdom of their choice; and
in less than a twelvemonth the school was submitted to the " solemne visitation”
of the diocesan. Bishop Grindall, accompanied by several other dignitaries of
the church; which accordingly took place on Friday, August 16, 1562, when
the ushers whom Mulcaster had chosen, and the boys of the school, under-
went an examination in classical literature, to the high satisfaction of the
venerable prelate and dignified visitors.
Not long after this, Archdeacon Watts founded scholarships at Pembroke
Hall, Cambridge, with a general preference to youths educated at schools in
the metropolis; and several of his first scholars were such as had attracted
his notice at the episcopal visitations already mentioned, which he had
generally attended. And the company, in compliance with a request from
the mayor and aldermen, had agreed to keep a scholar, either at Oxford or
* It is but justice to the company to state that, if we except the fellowships, scholarships, and
exhibitions, founded by Sir Thomas White, Bishop Dee, the Rev. Dr. Stuart, the Rev. Mr. Parkyn,
Dr. Andrew, and others, the legacies “towards the augmentacon of the scole” are too inconsiderable
to be mentioned.


Cambridge, at the annual expense of five pounds, under the appellation of
" The Merchant-Taylors’Scholar.”
But these advantages were of too precarious a nature to render the school
desirable on the score of endowment, or to form the basis of any permanent
connexion between it and the universities. But this objection was speedily
removed by the munificent conduct of * Sir Thomas Whitej a member of the
* As the name of Sir Thomas White must be fondly cherished in the heart of every
Merchant-Taylor, a short biographical notice of this truly munificent patron to the
school cannot fail to prove interesting.
“ Sir Thomas White, the son of William White (clothier, a native of Rickmansworth,
Herts, by Mary, daughter of John Kiblewhite, of South Fawley, in Berkshire), was
born at Reading, in the year 1492. He is said to have been educated at the place of
his nativity, hut probably only in the elements of writing and arithmetic; as, at the age
of twelve years, he was apprenticed to a tradesman, or merchant of London. His
apprenticeship lasted ten years, during which he behaved so well, that his master, at
his death, left him an hundred pounds. With this, and the patrimony bequeathed by
his father, who died in 1523, he commenced business on his own account; and in a few
years rose to wealth and honours, and became distinguished by several acts of muni-
ficence. He was Sheriff of London in 1546, and Lord Mayor in 1553, when he was
knighted by Queen Mary, for his services in preserving the peace of the city during
the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt. Of the rest of his history, or personal character,
sentiments, and 'pursuits, no particulars have been discovered, except what may he
inferred from his many and wise acts of liberality. He must have been no common man,
who showed the first example of devoting the profits of trade to the advancement of
learning. He died at Oxford, February 11, 1566, in the seventy-second year of his
age, and was buried in the chapel of his college. He was twice married; first to a
lady whose name was Avisia, or Avis, but whose family is unknown. She died in 1577 ;
without issue, and was buried with great pomp and ceremony in the parish church of
St. Mary, Aldermanbury. His second wife was Joan, one of the daughters and co-
heiresses of John Lake, of London, gent., the widow of Sir Ralph Warren, knight,
twice Lord Mayor of London, by whom she had children. She survived Sir Thomas,
and was buried by the side of her first husband, in the church of St. Rennet Sherehog,
London.” There is a portrait of him in the chapel of Merchant-Taylors’ School (as
seen in the view annexed to these pages), “ habited as Lord Mayor of London, with a
gold chain; and collar of SS., a black cap, pointed beard, his gloves in,his right hand,
and on the little-finger of his left, a ring. There are similar portraits [in the town halls
of Salisbury and Leicester, at Reading, and St. John’s College, Oxford.”—See Chal-
mers’s History of the University of Oxford, Vol. 11. p. 368; and Coates’s History of
Reading, page 405, &c.


court, and already a co-founder of the school, who came forward a most
distinguished benefactor to it, by appropriating to its scholars thirty-seven
fellowships at St. John’s College, in Oxford, which he had recently founded
at his sole expense. From this time the school of Merchant-Taylors’ has
gradually increased in consequence and repute, until it has attained the proud
rank of being esteemed one of the most distinguished public institutions for
classical education in Great Britain.. . • -
The immediate consequence of Sir Thomas’s benefaction, was the icom-
pletion of the two hundred and fifty boys allowed to be taught on the
foundation. And, after numerous applications, Mulcaster was induced to
admit a supernumerary portion of pupils into his. own house, which was,
however, shortly after prohibited, by order of court, and the; dismissal of all
boys, for whom no vacancy occurred in the school within a given time, strictly
enjoined. •
However, notwithstanding the, gift of the scholarships to the school, no
election for some time took place. In consequence, at a court, held on the
tenth anniversary after the foundation, it was determined to write to the
college, to demand their attendance to join in an election on the feast of
St. Barnabas in thei following year; but as .no notice was taken of this letter,
the court, after an anxious delay of nearly six months, sent a deputation to
Sir William Cordall, Master of the Rolls, and visitor of the college, to request
his interference in their behalf. The answer to Sir William’s application
was; that the funds,of the college would, not admit of the necessary expenses
in travelling to London. The company, at Sir William’s suggestion, agreed
to defray the expenses, with this proviso, , that no precedent for the future
should be deduced from this act. Accordingly, about eight o’clock of the
morning, of the,: 10th of June, Horne, Bishop of Winchester, Robinson,
President, of St. John’s,, the two senior fellows of the college, the master,
wardens, and assistants of the corapany, with many other characters, distin-
guished alike for eminence and learning, assembled in the school; whence,
after a gratulatory oration to the company, his lordship, and the examiners,
and after an exhibition of verses by several of the scholars, they adjourned
into the chapel, when the examinations commenced in various branches of


classical literature. It was then determined that two scholars should be
elected on the following day, and that the examination should be confined
to such four of the boys as should seem “ meteste, as well for learninge,
personage, poverty, and years, to be presently preferred to colledge.” On
the next day, the master, wardens, and assistants of the company, together
with two senior fellows of St. John’s, met, according to the statutes of Sir
Thomas White, in the chapel, where, after due deliberation, their choice
fell upon Rickesmond and Lee, as the first scholars from Merchant Taylors.
This first election took place on the 11th of June, 1572. Some irregularities
with respect to the elections, and consequent divisions with the company,
arose at different times after this.
The next material occurrence which took place, was the reperusal and
enlargement of the original statutes, in 1606 —7> and the institution of a
“ probacon, or tryal of the whole schoole,” which has continued, with very
trifling variations from the original plan, to the present time. The first
attempt at dramatic performances as a recreation from the severer studies of
literature, was at the company’s hall, in the year 1665. The play performed
was Beaumont and Fletcher’s comedy of “ Love’s Pilgrimage,” which had
been performed before the late king and queen, at Hampton Court, on the
16th of December, 1636, by the king’s players. The expense to the company
attending this exhibition amounted to “ seaventeen poundes, tenn shillings
and ninepence.” They were afterwards discountenanced by the company,
owing, no doubt, to the necessary interruption to school business. Towards
the middle of the following year, the company finding that several members
had omitted subscribing to the school library, which they had some time
before founded, ordered that no one should be admitted as an assistant to
the court, without contributing at least forty shillings to that purpose.
The great calamity which shortly after befel the metropolis, for a time
put a stop to their benevolent proceedings. The great fire of London broke
out early on the morning of Sunday, the 2d of September, and burnt without
intermission for three days; nor ceased till it had laid the greater part of
the city in ashes. In the afternoon of the first day, the venerable Gothic
pile, which once had rung with the mingled sounds of revelry and mirth.


under the princely rule of Buckingham, where, sages had discoursed, and
nobles mingled in the festive sports, was included in the general devastation,
when it had nearly completed its first century under the auspices of literature
and education. Owing to the activity of Goad, who then filled the head-
master’s chair, the principal part of the newly established library was saved
from the devouring element.
For more than a year, the place of instruction is involved in obscurity;
but on the 10th of April, 1668, the master and wardens were ordered to
treat with the churchwardens for the grammar-school of St. Mary’s, in the
parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, which was accordingly done.
On the 11th of January, 1671, a committee for the rebuilding of the
school was formed, consisting of Sir William Bolton, and twenty other
gentlemen; to which Sir William Turner, knight and alderman, was ap-
pointed treasurer. Various liberal subscriptions were presently forwarded
from numerous quarters; and on the 26th of November, 1675, the present
structure was finished.
This edifice is a long and commodious building. The interior of the
school-room is 82 feet in length, and 2.5 feet in breadth, and in height, 20 feet;
supported on the east by seven stone pillars, forming a handsome cloister;
within which are apartments for the three under masters, the original in-
tention of which was for lodgings, now seldom used, but as retiring rooms.
Adjoining to this is a library, well furnished with classic, and other books
in various branches of literature, for the use of the school. And on the
south side of the library is the chapel, in which the examinations and elections
are held. Contiguous to these is a large house, which is appropriated to the
use of the head master.
Upon the completion of the new structure, the usual routine of scholastic
education recommenced; and towards the beginning of the next century (in
1702), the sixteen senior scholars began to be distinguished by the titles of
the Table and the Bench.
A second attempt to revive the dramatic performances at Merchant-
Taylors’ was made in the early part of 1762, by the head master, Townley,
who requested permission from the court for the scholars to perform a Latin
E


play. The request was granted; and, on the 13th of February, “ The
Eunuch” of Terence was performed for the first time; and was successively
repeated to crowded audiences, with universal applause, on the 16th, 18th,
20th, 22d, and, for the last time, on the 23d. On the repetition day, in May,
the second act of the Phormio was performed to a few private friends; and
the last dramatic performance took place in the following year, when the
Troades of Seneca, abridged into three acts, and Ruggle’s Ignoramus, cut
down into two, were performed six nights to numerous audiences, among
whom were many persons of great learning and distinction. Three thousand
tickets were issued, and a thousand orders. However, the court, deeming
that these exhibitions tended to relax the discipline of the school, and
interrupt avocations of a more serious nature, discountenanced the repetition
of them. '
From this time Merchant-Taylors’ School has continued in one uninter-
rupted course of prosperity and success. And not only its past celebrity,
but also its present flourishing condition, affords the best proof of the patriotic
liberality which founded, and of the virtue, talent, and ability, which has
supported and conducted it.
Regulations &c.
The school consists of eight forms. The entrance is now forty shillings,
the quarterage ten shillings, and the breaking-up-money twelve shillings at
Easter, Whitsuntide, Bartholomewtide, and Christmas. Besides which, every
boy pays one shilling at each probation day for a book, in which he writes
his exercises for the inspection of the examiners; one shilling in the winter,
for candles; and five shillings on being removed from one form into another,
except into the sixth, when it is ten shillings. And these are all the expenses
(exclusive of board, books, &c., which depend upon circumstances), at present
attending an education at Merchant-Taylors’ School; to partake of which,
and of the contingent advantages arising from the foundations, of Sir Thomas
White and others, at the universities, two hundred and fifty boys, for more
than two hundred and fifty years, have been invited through the munificence
of the Merchant-Taylors’ Company. Boys are admitted of any age, and are


placed according to their qualifications; but, according to a recent regu-
lation, no boy can be entered above the third form, who is a candidate for
the election to St. John’s. They may remain without superannuation until
the month of June, before they are nineteen.
For the better inquiry into the proficiency of the scholars, there are two
probations in the year, which are performed only by the master and ushers.
The first probation is in the month of March, and the second in that of
October.
For the better satisfaction of the master, wardens, and court of assistants
of the Merchant Taylors, the probations themselves undergo an examination
twice in each year, by two judicious men, well learned in Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin, who are appointed by the master and wardens of the company.
Upon these days, which are within a fortnight of the respective probations,
the master and wardens, or at least two of them, are present. The examina-
tion is performed in the chapel; and when it is finished, the audience return
into the school, where speeches are publicly recited by the eight senior
scholars, or monitors of the school. These are called Doctors’ Days.
There is also another public examination of the monitors, by the president
and two senior fellows of St. John’s College, Oxford, assisted by the two
regular school examiners; previous to which, public speeches are recited by
the monitors, as on the Doctors’ Days. In addition to which, after the
examination, a series of epigrams, on two given subjects, are spoken by the
monitors in the chapel. This takes place annually on the 11th of June,
previous to the election of scholars to be made on that day, to fill up the
vacant fellowships in that college*. At this time an account is printed,
containing the names and order of the head scholars; their birth, admission,
and continuance in the head form, and also the subjects of the orations.
The holidays are, at Easter one week, and from the Thursday preceding;
at the election in June one fortnight; at Bartholomewtide and Christmas
one month; the remaining days of the two weeks in which the examination
* The election of scholars is on the 11th, but the admission to St. John’s is on the
first Monday after St. John’s Day, the 21th, on which day they must be actually under
nineteen.

Ash Wednesday, Ascension Day, King Charles the Second’s Restoration,
and occasional fasts and thanksgivings, enjoined by the paramount authorities
in church and state.

wardens, and court of assistants of the company of Merchant-Taylors, with
the assistance of the president and two senior fellows of St. John’s College.
Six civil law exhibitions, given by J. Andrew, L. L. D., in 1803; and one
exhibition given by W. Stuart, D. D., in 1746, to St. John’s College, Oxford.
Election the same as the preceding; to be held for twelve years.
