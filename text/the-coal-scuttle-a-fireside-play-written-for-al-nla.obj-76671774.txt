THE COAL SCUTTLE;

SCENE 1.
A room at Etham. Present: Crusty old Uncle, some of the
members of his family, and Mrs. Gabb, a visitor.
Mitty : Well, pa; have you bought anything for Alice ?
Old Uncle : Yes, I have, but none of your nonsensical baubles.
It is time that more appropriate presents should be given
on these occasions. Utile dulci is my motto?if you
know what that means; but it?s all the same whether
you do or not, ?I mean it.
Mrs. Gabb : Well, sir, I really think it is ridiculous
Old Uncle: No, it is not ridiculous, begging your pardon. If
Alice is the sensible girl I take her to be, she?ll not think
it ridiculous it all. It?s a present most suitable for any
young married couple who have a cold world before them,
and
Mrs. Gabb : I didn?t mean
Old Uncle : You said as plainly as ever you spoke in your life,
that it was ridiculous. I beg to think otherwise, and
I do
Mrs. Gabb : But


Old Uncle : I hate the word hut ; it is well-called a disjunctive,
for it upsets all that goes before it.
Mrs. Gabb : Goodness me! sir; you are put out very easily,
I said nothing about your present, and ?
Old Uncle : Then what are you talking about ? I?m talking
about the present and nothing else, and never said a
syllable about anything else.
Mitty : What is the present, pa ?
All : Ah, What is the present ?
Old Uncle : A most useful and ornamental article of furniture;
I never see one but it brings my fireside before me. It?s a
coal scuttle.
Mitty : Oh, pa! I never heard of such a thing!
Flory : You must be joking, pa.
Old Uncle : I never made a joke in my life, and never mean
to, and as to your never having heard of such a thing,
Mitty?there is the novelty of it?it is quite a new idea.
Mrs. Gabb : I now say it is ridiculous.
Old Uncle : You say a number of ridiculous things, Mrs. Gabb,
but a more appropriate present there could not be ; and
as Alice is going to England?a country with the biggest
thieves in all the world, I?ll have a lock and key to it, to
keep her coals from being stolen.


Mrs. Gabb : Ha! ha ! and pray who is to keep the key ? and
who would steal from the scuttle when they could go to
the coal-hole ? but I won?t hear my country abused by
you or anyone. We are not thieves !
Old Uncle : I say they are. Not content with islands, they
take continents and everything else. There?s not a sea
or a land, a bay or a strait, they don?t put their flag on,
and surround it with guns and drums, and sailors and
marines and soldiers, and other nonsense ?and stick to
all they get.
Mrs. Gabb : And quite right too ; what would the world be
without them ?
Old Uncle : Just as good as ever it was.
Willie (ironically) : Hadn?t you better fill the scuttle with
coals, father ? ?it would make the present complete.
Old Uncle : Not at all a bad idea, Willie. Yes, coal is power !
bottled sunlight as the great Stephenson said; and as
Alice is going to that miserable climate, some bottled sun-
light might be useful, for they get precious little of it on
draught.
Mrs. Gabb : And send coals to Newcastle! ridiculous is too
mild a term for such nonsense. You forget, sir, that the
English have a cellar of their own; but I won?t stay


to hear my country run down. Good-day, sir; good-day,
my dears; I never
(Exit talking).
Old Uncle (aside): I?ve found out a good way of getting rid of
you, my lady; you shall hear more of the wrong side of
the British character. Confound her ! she knows every
hole and corner of the wrong side of mine; hut I am as
proud of the old flag as she is, after all.


SCENE 2,
A room at GreenoaJces. Present: Aunt Mariann, Annie ,
and Alice.
(Enter Mrs. Gabb.)
Aunt M.: How do you, Mrs. Gabb ? Why, you look quite
excited. What is the matter ?
Mrs. Gabb : Oh, Mrs. Mort! I have just come from Etham.
Such a bear of a man as that Mr. M. I never saw; I had
no idea he was such a man ! Outside of his house you
would think butter wouldn?t melt in his mouth ; but he
is a perfect brute in it. What his poor girls have to put
up with, no one knows !
Aunt Mariann : Then I shall love them all the more, for they
never complain.
Mrs. Gabb : Oh, my dear Mrs. Mort! that is just like all the
cousins ; they never complain of anything? turning to
Alice ?and you, dear, are the cause of all the disturbance
?it was all about you !
Alice : About me! I haven?t done anything, have I ?
Annie : I am sure he can?t have been saying anything against
her. If he has, he is a great hypocrite.


Mrs. Gabb : That is just what he is, my dear! He has been
abusing everyone and everything ; and what do you think
it was all about ? ?ha ! ha ! it makes me laugh to men-
tion it?because we wouldn?t admire his wedding present
to Alice!
Annie ; What is the present ?
Mrs. Gabb : Ha ! ha ! ha ! Most ridiculous ?a coal-scuttle !
Ha ! ha!
Mrs. Mort (with dignity): I see nothing to laugh at. Has the
man taken leave of his senses ?
(Enter a servant).
If you please, mem, there is a parcel from Etham
Mrs. M.: What sort of parcel ?
Servant : I think, mem, it?s a coal-scuttle.
Mrs. M. (with dignity): Then put it in the coal-hole; that is
the proper place for such articles.
Servant : If you please, mem, there?s a letter for Miss Alice.
(Delivers the letter and exit).
Mrs. Mort : Forgive me, Alice, for interfering, but I was so
indignant that I quite forgot the parcel was addressed to
you.
Alice : Poor Uncle M. ! he means well enough; but you know
he has such queer ideas of things.


Aunt Mariann : I have no patience with such ideas ; but what
is the letter ?pray read it ?more tomfoolery, I suppose.
Mrs. Gabb : You may be very certain of that, Mrs. Mort, but
let us all hear it.
Alice opens the letter, and reads as follows :
? My dearest Alice, ?Your many friends,
I have no doubt, have presented you with many pretty gim-
cracks, which a sensible girl like you will value accordingly. I,
however, beg your acceptance of one of the most useful articles
in the world ?emblematic of domestic happiness, and may
your share of that be great. The sight of a coal-scuttle, especi-
ally a full one, always reminds me of my ain fireside ?[ain is
Scotch for own] ?that poets often write of, and well they may,
for it?s the happiest spot on earth for a well-matched and loving
pair. Ten thousand congratulations upon your being about to
possess a fireside of your ain?and a coal scuttle !
? I add a few modest lines of my own,
addressed to the coal scuttle, with some sibylline leaves, shadow-
ing in a prophetic way your coming happiness.
? Affectionately yours, J. S. M.
Mrs. Gabb : The man?s mad ! mad as a march hare. Just fancy
him turning poet.
Mrs. Mort : Absurd ! but read the lines, pray.


Alice reads:
LINES TO THE COAL SCUTTLE.
My fireside friend, what hours of bliss I owe
To thee, thou chalice of the fires that glow
With cheering warmth when daily toil is done
And yet another day its course has nearly run !
The sun has gone, and now the hours of night
In darkness steal upon departing light.
We turn to thee, my friend, and from thy store
Heap up the fire, and parting light restore.
Blest be the prescience ! ?blest the awful mind !
That made provision thus for poor mankind,
Tell not to me, no God has e?er designed
The stores of warmth within thy hold confined,
Ten times ten thousand years ago, He stored
The now found treasures of the wondrous hoard !
Thou silent friend, and servant of my need
Supply my light, and let me haply read
In leaves prophetic, scenes that thou may?st see
In her?s?our friend?s approaching destiny!
LEAF THE FIRST.
( Their first fireside.)
The veil is lifting !?see the rising flames
Up ! upwards stream in laughing crackling strains I
Bright are the rays around the room they fling,
And bright the promises of love they bring !


Beside the fire two youthful forms I see
Hand clasped in hand, ?they speak, they laugh with glee.
They speak of pleasant times, ?the joy they share,
Each free from care, yet each, each other?s care;
They nearer draw, they whisper, fondly kiss,
And own that life has bliss, yes, heavenly bliss !
Whate?er the cares or sorrows of this earth
They still shall keep in love their fireside hearth!
The laughing flame, in dancing leaps ascends,
And leaf the first?my mystic vision ends.
LEAF 2.
Alone at Tier fireside ?storm outside ?husband at sea?
fancies his ship in the storm, sailors aloft ?hope of his return.
In other than Australia?s sunny land
My vision opens! By a hearth I stand !
In silence sits a form, her feet well dressed
Upon the gleaming fender lightly rest;
She gazes at the smoke in eddies whirl,
And wreaths of flame around the fire-bars curl.
Dark is the night without; the sleet and rain,
Borne on the whirlwind, dash upon the pane ;
Gust after gust, and blast succeeding blast,
Are hurried howling on the tempest past!
God help the poor, she thinks, in such a storm,
The fireless wretches, starving and forlorn ;


But, Oh ! preserve the sailors, God ! she prays ;
Keep them and him in all their noble ways !
Her fancy sees the ship on ocean borne,
Breasting the breaking waves in noble form !
Green seas break o?er her ! wallowing in foam,
Along she goes?her bows are pointing home !
Crash goes the gear!? Away loft, my boys !
And up they go, through storm, and roar, and noise,
For hours they strive to hand the frozen sail;
In vain! it flies to ribbons in the gale,
While numbed and chilled, the order down is borne
And heard not in the howling of the storm;
But ominous, through gloom and darkness roar,
The sound of breakers pn the dead lee shore!
The fire here brightens up, and hope, dear hope,
Cheers with the blaze ! We all with dangers cope,
When she, the charmer, to the saddest comes,
Our life keeps in, and all our woe o?ercomes.
She sees the fireside flame with clearness burn,
And pictures all the rapture of return,
And thus leaf two of vision floats away
In dreams of joy to come ?and soon, we pray I


LEAF 3.
(Employment on shore?domestic scene.)
A steady flame is burning in the grate ;
The hour is evening, and the husband late.
Strange voices in the cheerful room are heard ?
He?s coming ! and the fire is quickly stirred?
The voices multiply it seems, and noise
As if of pattering feet, and falling toys !
We had not heard these voices here before ;
But what a rush there is towards the door !
It does seem strange, but as papa comes in
She does not get first kiss, as it has been, ?
Some tiny pairs of lips come in between;
And stranger still to me, she does not seem
To feel neglected as she would of yore ?
Yet is her love still stronger than before !
Who shall divine, what poet can pourtray
The steady bliss of mellowed love, or say
That time e?er dulls or leads it to decay ?
?Tis not true love that passes thus away !
No, her turn comes. How gently both now greet ?
How softly lips to lips each other meet;
Looks are exchanged?both hands and hearts are full,.
And both in rapture gaze upon misrule,
For toys and books and pictures strew the floor,
Neglected all since father turned the door.


The steady flame illumes the cheerful scene,
And leaf prophetic No. 3 has been !
LEAF 4.
( They give a party ?their daughter?coming changes.)
The scuttle stands well charged?the fire is bright;
? There is a sound of revelry to-night!?
Fair forms are there, and music fills the place ;
Sweet are the sounds, and beautiful the face!
My vision sees the singer standing there
So innocently bright?so passing fair !
She makes all happy. He and she rejoice
With honest pride in her, her form and voice,
But most her mind. All thank the graceful muse
Whose songs delight, and all the guests amuse.
Then comes the dance, and young and old unite
To speed the hours with pleasure and delight,
While host and hostess pass from guest to guest
With well-bred ease and courteous request.
I hear of changes gay, yet sad to some,
But such must be?the young must leave the home.
She will be missed for many a coming tide,
For life and soul was she to our fireside !
While gazing on the scene, the vision fades,
And leaf the fourth has passed into the shades !


LEAF 5.
(They pass a Merry Christmas Day.)
The bells are ringing !?it is Christmas day !
The fire is blazing, and the house is gay!
Why, there are preparations for a feast,
For thirty people at the very least!
The Australian cousins sent by telephone
That they had drank our healths to-day at home ;
We rather wished that they themselves had come,
It only takes a week to bring them home.
How the snow falls ! such flakes too, how they go !
I like a Christmas in the falling snow,
It is so pure, so innocently white,
And then how beautiful it makes the night!
Ah ! there?s a robin redbreast come to beg?
Poor little thing, too, with its broken leg;
He?s not the only poor lame beggar here,
To share a dinner and our Christmas cheer.
But here they come ! Our friend, the muse !
Her husband, and some more in ones and twos.
How they do kiss the hostess !?? Come, I say,
Time?s up, my lad ; you can?t do that all day!
Let others have a chance ?you?ll kiss her up,
And leave us nothing?not a single sup !?
Well, Harry, how go gases ? fetch the moon ?
(The Admiral can?t bear the war balloon?


He says it quite capsizes every notion ;
He likes to fight npon the solid ocean.)
The fact is Harry did a clever thing,
He brought a foeman down upon the wing ;
He was promoted, and is promised soon
Command of some ten thousand power balloon!
But what a dinner ! Oh, my goodness gracious !
The table filled all roxmd?and it was spacious?
How they do talk ! No end is there of chaff,
And not a soul but must have room to laugh.
With parent pride, the founders of the whole
Look on with happiness and grateful soul,
And after dinner when they all retire
Beside the scuttle and the flaming fire,
Games, chat and music pass the happy hours,
With all their hearts and their artistic powers.
Then there were books and presents for the young,
And happy gossip fell from every tongue.
The Admiral talks shop?his daughter?s Harry
Will never him convince balloons can carry
Compounded force enough !?Those girls are laughing,
And really fear that dear mamma is chaffing.
No caps ! small waists ! hair plain ! what perfect frights !
Why how could ladies then show off their heights ?
There?s cousin Kate has hair dressed up a foot,
With heels at least six inches to her boot.


The diamonds now upon a lady?s hair
Are worth a thousand times what Ma did wear?
Then came the parting, they were kissed away,
And that was how they spent their Christmas Day !
Great God who made us ! If one lowly birth
Can make all happy for a day on earth?
Can make us love and wish to all mankind
Peace and good-will?and humanise the mind?
Why may we not in peace abide always,
And all our days be merry Christmas days ?
The flickering fire shines out ?the shadows play,
The mystic leaf has withered ?passed away.
LEAF 6.
(Their Golden Wedding Day.)
As misty vapours from the valleys rise,
Disclosing beauteous scenes before our eyes,
Streamlets and dells, and hamlets in repose
The mystic veil before leaf six arose !
The fire is burning, and a sombre light
Streams from the bars?the scuttle still is bright?
Reflecting from the embers in the grate
A sunset glow ?for they are burning late.
Fantastic shapes they take, and fancy weaves
Strange forms of caves, of grots?and falling leaves


That slip?and drop?and changing pass away
As forest giants fall and then decay??
They tend to meditation, strange to say
A pensive feeling watching as they die away.
Two forms are sitting as they were of yore,
Hand clasped in hand, ?they speak not as before,.
A still small silence near them seems to dwell,
For memory over them has cast her spell?
It is a day ! their golden wedding day!?
And young and old had been to make it gay.
He spoke?? Do you remember fifty years ago ?
That happy day we joined, for weal or woe?
There were some simple lines your Uncle wrote;
I?ve sometimes wished that we had kept a note
Of them, and other notes we had that day??
Poet and writers long since passed away !
? I have them dear, some day we?ll read them o?er,.
I have not thought of them for years before.?
? Let?s read them now, if not too late,? said he,
? The sibyl leaves were not bad prophecy :
For we have lived a happy, happy life !
And God has loved thee?noble, noble wife !
I sometimes feel I owe my all to thee,
And for thy sake, that He has prospered me ! ?
? How strange,? said she, ? the very thought I?ve thought
Of thee, my life ! and have my children taught.?


She brought the faded lines, and tried to read ?
The will was there, alas! hut not the deed.
She stopped?in glittering gems the fire appears,
They slowly turned ?looks met, and met through tears !
Not tears of sorrow ! ?but their hearts were full
Of ripened love, in age grown beautiful! ?
Blest be the fountain of the tears that flow
To ease the bursting heart in joy?or woe !
Those tears for loved ones who have passed away,
The tears of loving ones compelled to stay ?
The hopes of meeting, and of joys to come
Are clothed in verdure by those tears alone !
They nearer draw, and pressing face to face,
The liquid gems ennobling the embrace,
They own that earth has bliss to mortals given,
The mortal foretaste of immortal heaven !
The embers fall ?their failing powers decay?
The leaf grows dim, and vanishes away !
