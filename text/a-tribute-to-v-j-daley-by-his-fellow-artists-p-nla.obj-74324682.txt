A TRIBUTE TO V.J. DALEY
By his fellow-Artistsl PICTORIAL LITERARY
__ ( THEATRICAL
The Hon. Editor in expressing his thanks lor the unanimity of assistance volunteered by brother Artists, regrets
that the excellent matter generously placed at his disposal lar exceeded available space.? George Taylor.
Oh the World is wondrous fair
When the tide of Life's at flood
7 here is magic in the air,
There is music in the blood.
And a glamour draws us on
To the Distance rainbow-spanned
And the road we tread upon
Is the road to Fairy-land.
?Daley.
* VICTOR.? * *
And his death came in December,
When our summer was aglow?
Fike a song that we remember,
Fike a child?s dream long ago,
And it brought Australia to him,
Her sweetest singer dead,
While in silence friends who knew him
Bowed their heads beside his bed.
Angel Death comes softly stealing
When the watchers eyes are dim,
And, when all has failed in healing
Wounded heart or helpless limb?
With a whisper we may hear not
?Till with ? Adsum ? we respond,
And a vision we shall fear not
Of the Peaceful Fand beyond.
While Australians in their blindness
Fail to realise their loss,
Place the wreath of loving kindness
And raise the simple cross.
For he taught us to be brothers
And he taught us to be brave ?
And we?ll banish pride and envy
With a hand-clasp by his grave.
?Henry Fawson.

Not all who seek inherit
The piercing coloured flower ;
It is the price of merit
That waits a patient hour.
Though age make manhood hoary,
And care eclipse like night,
He treads the heights of glory
Who wears the flower of light.
Long time he sought it, bringing
The high gods? gift of song;
They hearkened to his singing,
A pleased and silent throng.
And while his song was burning,
With leaping lyric fire,
The gods, to ease his yearning,
Fulfilled his hearts desire.
The years will but unfold it,
And time make fierce its flame ;
?Tis his ?to have and hold it ?
The scarlet Flower of Fame.

HOSTESS (who has chattered all through the performance); ?Oh, thank you so much !
How I dote on those ? Songs Without Words.? ?
Great Artist: ?Yes, madam, and what a peety we cannot have conversation wizout
worts too !?
Ye, whom the children of his soul has
taught
That life has comelier fruitage than
success,
And regions wizard Gold may not
obsess,
Who, lulled by wind and flower and
stream his thought
Had humanised, have in Australia
caught
A gleam of Eire, a waft of Eyonesse,
And magic runes from elfin grottoes
brought
Think of his body?s children in their
stress!
Their path is hard that all your gen-
tler hours
Should be o?erstrewn with deathless
grace of flowers;
Forget them not, nor her from whom
his glances
Distilled the founts, of love in which :
ye swim :
Their food is scant that ye who needed;
him ,
Should duly get your Spirit?s susten-
ance.

TIME.
? Don Juan, Ponce de Leon,?
Very courteously it said
? I cannot take j'ou with me,
For I only take the dead.?
?Ponce de Leon, by Victor Daley
?Who painted Time with beard of
white
And snows upon his head.
He hath, in sooth, not painted
right,?
The Mourning Poet said.
Time is a housemaid young and
fair,
Clear-eyed, with cheeks abloom,
Who in the house of Joy and
Care,
Toils ever with her broom.
Without the House of Joy and
Care,
Without the open door ;
A Narrow Box it standeth there
F'or Aye and Evermore.
And Virgin Time along the Hall
Of this dull House of Life,
With ready broom she sweepeth
all
The Sorrows and the Strife.
The Narrow Box it holdeth well
The Laughter and the Tears,
The Narrow Box it holdeth well
The Dust of all the years!
? E. J- Brady
I, M.?V. J. D.
Alone the Poet gazed across the
wave
That washed the western edges
of the world
And all the golden glory sun-
set gave
About his brow like gilded laurel
curled;
When other eyes were closed and
wings were furled,
He spun for fantasy a ballad
brave,
Wherein his Lady and her Sing-
ing Slave,
Together travelled in a bark im-
pearled.
He passes on his quest; we linger
and grieve,
He is the heir to Immortality
Whose requiem the boughs and
breezes w.'ave
For earth shall hear to all eter-
nity,
Twin-music to the nightingale
at eve,
The magic song that streams
across the sea.
?George C. Whitney.

A MEMORY.
Flushed by the farewell bonfire of the day,
Where the faint breath of summer flutter-
ing
Recalled the eager panting of the spring,
Among the sapling gums the poet lay,
Gripped by his pain, worn out by long
delay,
His thin face shadowed by the hovering
wing ;
But still of his own soul the sceptred king,
Still jesting in the old familiar way.
Those whom he never knew will love to
dream
In the bright secret place whose golden
key
He wrought with curious care of fire and
file :
But, we, who saw him weary and tortured,
see
Still in our silent moonlit moods agleam
The light of his indomitable smile.
?J. LR Gay Brereton.

WATTING.
MESSAGE.
What does it matter, when all is said,
The lot of our living here ?
Death will deliver us at the end,
And what is there left to fear?
What is there here for man to fear
Who draws no coward?s breath,
For what can fright the heart of man
Who dearest friend is Death ?
Live richly while your life-days last,
And let your heart keep young.
God will remember the generous hand
Before the praying tongue.
This knowledge comes to the dying man
Who turns him to the wall,
That genius counts for less than nothing,
And Goodness counts for all.
?Victor J. Daeey.
