THE
PEOPLE IN POLITICS
A short History of the Labor Movement in
South Australia, including Biographical
Sketches of its Representatives
in Parliament
Specially prepared to aid "The Daily Herald" Fair Fund,
March 11th to 13th, 1914
By T. H. SMEATON
Member of the South Australian Parliament.


The value of the story of notable deeds is less in
the story itself than in the deeds which it records and
the manner of their doing.
Movements which command the loyal support and
co-operation of multitudes, do so by virtue of the cause
which lays behind them, and by the character and con-
sistency of their leaders.
• • • •
No movement will live which does not appeal to the
best in human nature, nor can it prosper if that best is
.not freely and loyally rendered in its service.

PREFACE.
Tt is well known that this booklet, containing a
synopticalreview ot the history of
Labor Party and of its past and presem leaae
reoresentatives in Parliament, was projected by e
Mr F A Roberts M.H.R., and that its compilation was
“ene'LVSd by hit.be. £'
scheme which is now in hand for strength b
financial position of The Daily Herald.
The present writer has undertaken the work which
the untimely death of Mr Roberts so tragically H«to>
runted for two reasons ; first, because he was asKea
ho so by those who had every right to make the re-
quest; and second, because of the opportunity i a or s
him of honoring the memory of a man who ne y r sparec
himself any trouble, or refused a request made to hm
in the cause of the workers of South Aus ‘ ral ' a ' J “ a
account this little work may be regarded not only as a
handbook of the Labor movement in South Australia
from its inception until the present day but as a tribute
to the memory of a friend and comrade, esteemed and
beloved by many thousands of people to whom he was
known, and whose death has caused an even wider
circle to experience a sense of loss and sorrow which wil
hot be soon allayed.
Although the material available is sufficiently vol-
uminous and important to warrant the! issue of a much
larger book than that contemplated by the late Mr.
Roberts, no attempt will be made to exceed the limits
which he had set himself to observe. While in conse-
quence of this, the history of the Labor move-
ment in South Australia will be, necessaril)., rea e
in a condensed form, it is still hoped that the
record herein contained may prove to be interesting,
if not valuable, to many people both inside and
•outside of the ranks of the Labor Party, for while the
cause itself is rooted in the interests of a section ot the
people, it must not be forgotten that that section is very
large and important, and that its interests are insepar-
able from those of the people of the State as a whole.


The second division of the book, while apparently
little more than a somewhat elaborated roll of the per-
sonel of the leaders and representatives of the Labor
Party during; the period of its existence, is really a
record, which enshrines the personality of men who, in
many instances; have rendered herioc service in the
cause of humanity, and whose names will be held in
grateful remembrance through long years to come, for
the patient, thoughtful, and wise way in which they did
and are doing their work. Many of these good men have
gone to their long rest, and, let it never be forgotten,
they went, in nearly every case, as indeed Mr. Roberts
himself did, wearied and broken in health; worn in body
and brain by the pressure and strain of a service which
they never shunned, but which surely claimed them as-
victims of their own loyalty and devotion. If for no*
other reason than this, it is well that the memory of such
men should be enshrined for the worthy emulation of
those who shall follow them.
i Hoping that the fruits of this undertaking may
abundantly justify the anticipations of the man who con-
ceived it, the work is now submitted to the people from
men? 1 that gentleman lo °ked for support and encourage-

CHAPTER I.
THE ADVENT OF THE PARTY IN PARLIAMENT.
There was a time in the history of the Labor Party
when its claim to be regarded as a serious factor in the
constructive politics of the State, was openly and un-
affectedly derided by most of the class of people who,
at that time, professed to be themselves serious politi-
cians . That was of course in the early days of the
Party’s existence; before its critics had any experience
of its methods, or of the ability of its selected leaders;
and when they had not realised the latent strength of a
movement which was challenging the existence of the
only order of things they had known. It was not long,,
however, ere derision and supercilious indifference gave
place to alarm, for it was soon seen that the advent of
this new Party to the sphere of politics, was a menace
to long established class privileges, and that the claims
which it made for a hearing were too ably supported to
be ignored. It is a fact that, at the period alluded to,
the opponents of the Labor Party were less concerned
with the justice of the claims it advanced than with the
threat that its mere existence offered to the continuance
of conditions which were eminently satisfactory to them-
selves, and it is not surprising that the attitude of alarm
which followed on that of scornful or amused indifference
soon gave place to one of bitter and uncompromising
opposition.
A stock platform and press platitude of those days,,
as indeed it is of a class of politicians to-day, was that
the Labor Party could not be regarded as a national
party, because its claims were narrowly limited by the
conditions of the class which it professed to represent;
nor could its leaders be accepted by the great body of
the people as suitable representatives, because of their
lack of training and experience in either business or
politics. In view of the record which the Party has
made, and the impress it has left on the political history
of the State, it is hardly necessary to argue a point
which has been so unwisely and maliciously advanced.
For there is nothing more established in the realm of
politics to-day than that, when the Labor Party entered
the field, it did so with a policy which not only challenged
tne general beliefs and reactionary doctrines of the con-
servatives of that period, but also laid down a platform
of principles which was too national for them to contem-
plate without alarm.


No doubt, opposition to the new party was also
greatly stimulated by the further challenge it made to
the old idea, that Parliament was a preserve, to be sac-
redly maintained, for men of the leisured class, and for
those others in business who could afford to devote a
little time to the work of legislation. But those gentlemen
received a rude shock when the new school of Parliamen-
tarians proved to a demonstration that they were at least
the equals in character, training, and ability, of the men
whom they displaced, and, on the average/greatly their
superiors in general knowledge of the conditions which
most needed the attention of Parliament. There is no
doubt that, grammatically and rhetorically, the men of
the new school were quite the equals of the old Parliamen-
tary brigade, although it must be admitted that most ot
them lacked the airs and graces which distinguished that
highly respectable body, and all of them were unaffect-
edly ignorant of the rules of the game as it had been
played hitherto. But such little defects, if defects they
were, did not much embarrass either the Labor members
or their followers, and were amply balanced by the deter-
mination, sincerity, and practical knowledge which they
exhibited, in the business of legislating for a nation, and
not for any section or class of the people.
Eventually it came to be recognised—and in that
position it stands to-day—that, while the Labor Party
claimed much in making a serious demand to be regarded
as a national party, it also supported the claim ably and
intelligently by the programme which it submitted to
the people, and by the manner of its advocacy. As the
years have passed, that position has been strengthened
and established by the fact that the Labor Party has
asked no more, from either friend or foe, than that it
be given a fair field for its operations, without any un-
deserved favors, and that it should be equally fairly
judged as to results.
In recording the fact that, when the Labor Party
entered as a competitor in the arena of politics, it did
so clothed with a policy which was neither scamped nor
skimped to suit any class or section of the people, it
should also be stated, for the information of those who
may be blinded by ignorance or prejudice, that of that
policy there is not enough left to-day to make a decent
garment, and that, for the simple but significant
leason that, in almost every part, it has passed into
the legislative enactments of the State Parliament.


CHAPTER 11.
THE PARTY’S REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SOUTH AUS-
TRALIAN PARLIAMENT FROM 1891 TO 1914-
Admitting that the circumstances surrounding the
publication of this book emphasise the necessity of
abrcviation and condensation, it is yet beyond doubt
that, the omission of some statement of the causes
which led to the representation of the United Labor
Party in Parliament, and its first appearance there,,
would be a serious if not an unpardonable mistake.
It must ever be remembered that the Labor Party
did not, at first, come into existence as an organisa-
tion designed for political purposes. It is true that
many of its members were keen politicians, who cher-
ished strong political convictions, but until the year
1890 no step had been taken to secure special repre-
sentation in Parliament of me class which the Party
principally comprised, and it is doubtful if it would
have eventuated then, but for the pressure of cir-
cumstances, and the suggestions of many people who
were certainly as unfriendly, as they were much per-
turbed, when their cynically bestowed advice was most
unexpectedly followed.
The deciding factor in the determination of the
Labor Party to seek Parliamentary representation was
undoubtedly the Maritime Strike in 1890. At the ter-
mination of that great industrial trouble, the leaders of
the Labor movement in the principal centres of industry
in Australasia, saw clearly that the time had come for
the people whom they represented to state their own
case, and fight their own battles, in the legislative halls
of their country. It was borne in upon them by the
logic of facts at this tragic period, that it was not
enough to have the advocacy in Parliament of sympath-
etic friends of their class, who, however good their
intentions and praiseworthy their desires, yet lacked
that personal contact with the conditions of the worker,
which was absolutely necessary for a thorough under-
standing of their cause. Stimulated by this belief, and
after much anxious debate at several specially called
meetings, the Trades and Labor Council of South Aus-
tralia eventually invited representatives of all Labor and
Democratic Associations in the metropolitan area to
meet with them and discuss the problem of the hour and,
if they saw fit, take steps to secure direct representa-
tion in Parliament, for that section of the community to
which they all belonged. The movement was hailed
with enthusiasm, and meetings held in many centres of
population were largely attended by workers and those


in sympathy with them. As the result of this, a plebis-
cite of the whole of the members of Trades and Demo-
cratic Associations was taken, for the selection of can-
didates to contest the ensuing election of repres-
entatives of the people, to the Legislative Council of the
Province of South Australia.
This determination was regarded by many of our
own people as well as others to be a very bold step for a
first attempt to secure a footing in Parliament; but the
event entirely justified it, for, on the day of election, the
United Labor Party of South Australia scored a victory
m the triumphant return of its three direct candidates,
Messrs. Charleston and Guthrie, for the Central District,
•and Mr. Kirkpatrick for the Southern District, as the first
representatives of organised labor in the Parliament of
South Australia.
That election was held in 1891, and in the same year
at a bye-election in the District of Wallaroo, which oc-
curred in consequence of; the death of the Hon. David
Eews, Minister of Education, the first representative of
Labor in the House of Assembly was returned, in the
person of Mr. R. Hooper, a working miner. In the
following year Mr. Hooper was joined by Mr. John Abel
McPherson, Secretary of the United Labor Party, who at
a bye-election for the District of East Adelaide, scored a
win over Mr. George Fowler, a very popular ex-treasurer
of the Province, and the strongest man who could pos-
sibly have been run by the Conservative Party of that
day.
The year 1893 proved to be the first great testing
time of the new party. Successful in its first appeal
for representation in the “House of second thought,'”
and subsequently at the two bye-elections for the House
of Assembly, many people prophesised that, if the Labor
Party made any serious attempt to gain a further foot-
ing in Parliament, it would meet with signal and unmis-
takable failure. But undaunted by hostility, and indeed
more determined to succeed because of the prediction of
disaster, the Party entered the lists at the General Elec-
tions in 1893 with a challenge to all the metropolitan
districts, and to the dismay of opponents and the delight
of supporters, succeeded in returning eight members in
the persons of Messrs. J. A. McPherson for East Ade-
laide, W. O. Archibald and Ivor MacGillivray for Port
Adelaide, E. L. Batchelor for West Adelaide, R. Wood for
North Adelaide, Frank Houngan for West Torrens, E. W
Coneybeer for East Torrens, and Tom Price for Sturt.*


These with Mr. R. Hooper, who was again returned for
Wallaroo, and Mr. Alex. Poynton, who was elected for
the District of Flinders, constituted the compact and
formidable little contingent which formed the vanguard
.of the Democratic Party, that was destined soon to alter
the whole complexion of South Australian politics.
At the General Elections in 1896 all of these gentle-
men were again returned, and in addition to them Mr.
W. H. Carpenter, for the District of Encounter Bay, and
Mr. E. A. Roberts, for the District of Gladstone.
It should be noted that at this time the Party com-
prised two classes of representatives, viz., those who
were pledged and those who were unpledged. To all
intents and purposes these were equal in all Party mat-
ters, but as the organisation at that time did not per-
mit of active interference in many of the Parliamentary
districts, those gentlemen who fought the battle for dem-
ocracy practically unaided by the Enited Labor Party,
were not pledged to it as were the others. t The un-
pledged members of the Party at that time were Messrs.
Hooper, Poynton and Roberts.
In the following year the Labor Party, and the cause
of Democracy generally, suffered a severe loss in the
death of Mr. McPherson, the hrst leader of the Parliamen-
tary Labor Party, and the ever-alert Secretary of the
movement, which he had done so much to organise and
■establish.
It will not be inappropriate at this point to place on
record the personal esteem in which Mr. McPherson was
’held by the public of South Australia, as well as by his
more immediate associates. Practically unknown out-
side the sphere of unionism until called to the secretary-
ship of the United Labor Party, and only more widely
known when he became the first direct member to repre-
sent it in the House of Assembly, it is not too much to
say that his death was regarded as a public loss, as
well as a calamity, by those with whom he was most
closely associated. Mr. McPherson was a man of ster-
ling worth; ringing true in every relationship, whether
as father, friend, comrade or representative of his class.
Untiring in the performance of what he regarded to be
his duty, he never spared himself any trouble or exertion,
which might enable him to better fulfil it. His last
message to the people for whom he had lived, and in
whose service he died, has become a classic to his Party,
and, engraved upon his tombstone, it comes to us to-day,
not as a voice from the dead, but from the living—“ Tell
the boys to pull together.”


Mr. McPherson’s seat was retained for the Labor
Party by the election of Mr. James Hutchison as his suc-
cessor, and Mr. E. L. Batchelor was selected to succeed
him in the leadership of the Party.
The whole of the Labor Party representation was
again returned 1 to the House of Assembly at the elec-
tions in 1899, with an additional unpledged member in
the person of Mr. John Verran for the District of Wall-
aroo.
In 1901 Mr. Bachelor, who, with the consent of his
Party, had held a portfolio in Mr. Holder’s Government
as Minister of Education, became a candidate for the j
Federal Parliament, and his seat having to be resigned
was, unfortunately, at that time lost to the Party, al-
though it was subsequently' regained and has been held
for it continuously ever since.
During the 1899-1902 Parliament, the Constitution
of the State was altered, and the membership of both
Houses reduced; that of the Legislative Council from
24 to 18, and that of the House of Assembly from 54 to-
-42. Subsequent to the election of the first three labor
representatives to the Legislative Council, Mr. Charleston-
seceded from the Party, but on April 15, 1893, Mr. W. A.
Robinson was returned for the Central District at a bye-
election, and in the following year, at the General Elec-
tions in May, Mr. Gregor McGregor was returned for the
Southern District, and Mr. Henry Adams for the Central
District. At the General Elections in 1896 Mr. Kirk-
patrick was defeated in the Southern District, but in
May, 1900, he was returned again as a representative of
the Central District, while, unfortunately, Mr. Robinson
lost his seat on the same occasion. At the General
Elections in 1902, the representation of the Party was
again reduced, Mr. Adams failing to regain his seat,
while Messrs. Guthrie and Kirkpatrick succeeded in re-
taining theirs. But in 1903, the representation of the
Party was reduced to one, for on the 19th December of
that year Mr. Moulden, a Conservative, was elected to
the seat vacated by Mr. Guthrie, when that gentleman
was elected to the Commonwealth Parliament, and Mr.
Kirkpatrick was left as the sole representative of the
Party in the Legislative Council.
This state of affairs continued until the election of
Mr. David Jelley on October 20, 1906, to fill the place ren-
dered vacant by the death of Mr. Thompson; and this was
Followed three weeks’ later by the election of Mr. J. P:.


Wilson to Mr. Joseph Vardon’s place, when that gentle-
man resigned to contest a seat for the Federal Parlia-
.ment.
But the Hon. David Jelley did not live long enough
to do more than prove to his colleagues in Parliament
the sterling qualities of a very fine, generous and capable
manhood, for, unfortunately, in little more than three
months subsequent to his election he died, after a very
short illness.
Mr. Jelley’s seat was fortunately not lost to the
Party, Mr. F. S. Wallis being elected to fill the vacancy
'o,n March 2, 1907. The following year, however, saw
a reduction of the small representation of the Labor
Party in the Legislative Council, when, on the acceptance
■of the Agent Generalship of the State in London by the
Hon, A. A. Kirkpatrick, Chief Secretary in the Price
.Administration, his seat was won by Mr. Theodore Bruce,
;a member of the Conservative Party.
At the general election held on April 2, ioro, Mr.
J. P. Wilson was re-elected to the Legislative Council,
and Mr. A. W. Styles and Mr. E. L. W. Klauer succeeded
in capturing the other two seats which were then ren-
dered vacant in the Central District; while at the Gen-
oral elections on February 10, 1912, Mr. F. S. Wallis re-
gained his seat, and took with him as colleagues Messrs.
J. H. Vaughan and J. Jelley, thus capturing for the Labor
Party the whole of the seats for the Central District in
the Legislative Council.
At the House of Assembly elections in 1902, when
the provisions of the Amended Constitution became oper-
ative, the personnel of the Party was sadly altered and
reduced in number. Some months prior to that event
Mr. Frank Hourigan died, and his seat was lost to labor;
then at the General Elections the seats which had been
held by Messrs. Hooper, Hutchison and Carpenter were
lost, and thus when Parliament met, the representation
consisted of one member of the United Labor Party in
the Legislative Council, Hon. A. A. Kirkpatrick, and five
in the House of Assembly, viz., Messrs. Price, Coney-
beer, Archibald, MacGillivray, and Verran. In the third
session of that Parliament, however, this was slightly
altered by the death of Mr. A. D. Handyside, a conserva-
tive member for the District of Victoria and Albert, ana
his seat being won by Mr. W. Senior, as the nominee of
the United Labor Party, the personnel was increased to
■six.


During the currency of the Parliament 1902-5 it
became glaringly apparent that the administration of the
supposedly Liberal Jenkins-Butler government was being,
dictated by the openly Conservative section of Parliamen-
tarians led by Mr. John Darling, and as such a lapse
from political rectitude seemed to be, for the time at
least, abhorent to a certain number of erstwhile Govern-
ment supporters, these formed themselves into an In-
dependent Liberal' Party under the leadership of Mr..
A. H. Peake, and entered into a compact with the Labor-
Party to oppose the Government at the ensuing elections.
The compact included an agreement for the joint action,
of the parties in the evpnt of them being successful at
the polls, under the joint leadership of Mr. Price and
Mr. Peake, with the important proviso that, whichever
party was returned with the greater numerical strengvi,
should have the reversion of the Premiership if the Gov-
ernment were defeated.
The elections of 1905 are memorable in the history
of South Australia for the radical changes they effected
m the representation and policy of the country. Con-
servatism seemed to realise for the first time that its-
supremacy as a directing force in the politics of the
State was being challenged, and, with its back to the
wall, it put up a strenuous fight for the maintenance of
privileges which the combined parties were equally de-
termined to destroy. In country and city alike the ver-
dict was given against the Government, and when Parlia-
ment met, while Mr. Kirkpatrick stood alone as the re-
presentative of the Labor Party in the Legislative Coun-
cil, 13 of its nominees were returned by the constituen-
cies of the House of Assembly. These were —
District of Adelaide E. A. Roberts.
W. D. Ponder.
J. Z. Sellar.
District of Port Adelaide W. O. Archibald.
I. MacGillivray.
H. Chesson.
District ot lorrens F. W. Coneybeer..
T. Price.
C. Vaughan.
T. H. Smeaton.
G. Dankel.
District of Wallaroo J. Verran.
A. E. Winter.
District of Stanley C. Goode,
District of Victoria and Albert . . Win. Senior.


The state of parties when Parliament assembled
showed that the straight-out Conservatives numbered 16,,
Ministerialists 2, and the Labor and Independent Liberals
24, giving the latter combination a majority of 6 on a
challenging vote.
When the House met on Thursday, July 20, 1905, Mia
Price took the very earliest opportunity to carry the
agreement of the combined parties into effect, and, after
the formal business of Lie day was finished, moved, with-
out any further notice of his desire to take the business
out of the hands of the Government, that “The House
do now adjourn.” It is needless to say that the motion
was carried, but the House —and indeed the whole coun-
try —was filled with astonishment when the Premier, Mr.
(now Sir Richard) Butler, refused to obey its mandate,,
declaring that he would not resign until compelled to
do so by a vote of no-confidence. The House met again
on the following Tuesday, and again Mr. Price submitted
and carried the simple motion for adjournment, and al-
though Mr. Butler continued to declare his intention to
remain in office until .ejected in the usual way, wiser
councils prevailed, and he reluctantly tendered the resig-
nation of the Government,
On the following day, Wednesday, July 26, Mr.
Price met the House as leader of the new Government,
and thus for the first—but not the last—time in the
history of South Australia, the Labor Party stood behind
a Premier of its own selection, who was one of its own
members.
The years following this great victory of the democ-
racy have been, politically, stormy and strenuous; and
the fortunes of the Labor Party have been much effected
by influences not always propitious. But how
could it be otherwise with a party whose mission
it is distinctly to revise and alter theories of government
which have acted inequitably, and with prejudice, to the
welfare of the class whom, in an especial manner, it is
elected to represent? In pursuance of the programme
for reform of the social and industrial conditions of the
people which the Party submits, it is inevitable that it
should experience reverses as well as successes, and it
is to be recorded with satisfaction that no reverse has
ever daunted the determination of its members in the
struggle for the final achievement of the objects which
they are pledged to seek.
The first year of Mr. Price’s premiership was made
memorable by his appeal to the country on the ques-


tion of the franchise for the Legislative Council. The
policy of the Labor Party on that question was —as it
still is —the eventual abolition of the second chamber;
but as the Party which followed Mr. Peake would only
agree to its reform by reducing the property qualification
on which it is elected from a rental value of £25 to £l5,
it was necessary, if any reform at all was to be effected,
for the Labor Party to temporarily agree to assist
them. In consequence of the Legislative Council’s re-
fusal to assent to the Bill for its own reform, which was
sent to it by the Llouse of Assembly on two occasions,
Mr. Price obtained the Governor’s consent to a dissolu-
tion of the latter chamber, and at the General Elections
which Followed on November 3, 1906, it was gratifying
to find that the 'country endorsed the action of the Gov-
ernment by returning all the members who supported
its action, and in addition three more of the
Labor Party, in the persons of Mr. Donald Campbell for
the District of Victoria and Albert, Mr. Harry Jackson
for the District of Stanley, and Mr. John Newland for
the District of Burra.
On January 26, 190;, Mr. Reginald Pole Blundell
was elected to fill the vacancy in the representation of
the District of Adelaide, caused by the Death of Mr. J.
Z. Sellar, and in the following year a further gain to the
ranks of the Labor Party in the House of Assembly was
secured by the election of the late Mr. Tom Crush as a
representative for the Northern Territory, to fill the
vacancy created by the death of the Hon. V. L. Solomon.
The personnel of the Party in the House of Assembly
was changed in 1908 by the election of Mr. E. A. Anstey
to fill the vacancy in the representation of the District
of Adelaide, caused by the resignation of Mr. E. A.
Roberts, when that gentleman became a candidate for
the Federal Parliament.
At this time the Labor Party had a strength of 20
members in the House of Assembly.
In the closing session of the Parliament iqoC-io,
occurred the death of the Premier, Mr. Price. Worn out
m body by the untiring and splendid service he rendered
to the State, he passed away on May 31, 1909, his
death untimely, but his memory revered by the people
who loved and trusted him.
Mr. T. Ryan, another nominee of the Labor Party
was elected to the vacant seat on July 3, 1909.
The General Elections in 1910 saw high-water mark
in the representation of the Labor Party in the House


of Assembly, for on Arpil 2 of that year, not only were
all the members who sat there in the preceding Parha'
ment returned, but two more accompanied them, in the
persons of Mr. W. J. C. Cole, for the District of Stanley,
and Lt-Col. the Hon. J. V. O’Loghlin, for the District of
Flinders, thus giving the Party a clear majority of 2 in
a House of 42 members.
On the death of Mr. Price the compact between the
two parties which supported his ucvernment was sum-
marily brought to an end, by the acceptdnce by Mr.
Peake of the, premiership, offered to him by His Excel-
lency the Governor, who, rightly knowing nothing of
party compacts, followed time-honored custom and in-
vited the second in command to assume the leadership
on the death of his chief. As Mr. Peake’s following
only numbered 8 in a House of 42 members, his hold
on the reins of office was only secured to him by the
precarious support of the Conservative section of the
House, which had whole-souledly opposed him while in
coalition with Mr. Price.
As the General Elections in iqio gave the Labor
Party, supported by Mr. E. H. Coombe, the only re-
maining Independent Liberal, a working majority against
the polyglot party which had thrown in its lot with Mr.
Peake, a change of Government became inevitable, and
for the first time that was possible an administration
consisting entirely of members of the Labor Party took
up the reins ot office, with Mr. John Verran as premier.
The path trodden by the Verran Government was not
at any time a smooth one; beset as it was by snares
skilfully laid by its enemies, as well as by obstacles
which were heedlessly cast there by its friends. The
end came when on February 10, 1912, in fulfilment of
his pledges, Mr. Verran appealed to the country on a
question of the Consitutional rights of the House of
Assembly, and was defeated, not on the policy of the
Party, but on the fears of the people, which had been
mendaciously excited by the political combination that
followed Mr. Peake.
In consequence of the transfer of the Northern
Territory from tffe administration of South Australia
to the territorial possession of the Commonwealth, the
representation of that district in the House of Assembly
ceased in 1911. But, although as the result of this,
the Labor Party’s representation was diminished it did
not affect the State of Parties, as Mr. Crush’s colleague,
Mr. Brown, was a supporter of the party in opposition
to the Government.


The 1912 elections reduced the representatives of
the Labor Party in the House of Assembly from 21 to 16,
the seats of Messrs. T. Ryan, G- Dankel, W. Senior,
D. Campbell, J. Newland, and J. V. CTLoghlm being
lost, while one was gained in the District of Wallaroo
by the return of Mr. J. A. Southwood.
That is the present state of affairs in the House
of Assembly in relation to the Labor Party. But it is
not what the present Government intends it shall be
after the Lreneral Elections to be held in 1915. The
story of the part played by the party which follows
Mr. Peake, in passing the notorious Constitution Amend-
ment Act last year, is still fresh in the public mind,
and need not be rehearsed here. It is enough to say
that, the intention of those who conceived the measure,
was to cripple the cause of democracy in this State
by assuring, as far as lay in their power, the predomi-
nance of the Reactionary party at future elections for
bodi Houses of Parliament. But to this the public will
doubtless have something to say, and, handicapped
though it is undoubtedly by the infamous provisions of
the Act, which is intended to relegate it to an insigni-
ficant place in the Councils of the State, the Labor
Party looks with confidence to the occasion when it will
again meet at the polls the men who have been guilty
of this crowning act of political treachery.


CHAPTER 111.
/HE PARTY’S REPRESENTATIVES IN THE COMMON-
WEALTH PARLIAMENT FROM 1901 to 1914.
Although the Australian Colonies were granted
separate Constitutions sooner or later after their Pro-
clamation, which gave them all the rights of sovereign
-States—excepting in some few things in which
legislation was subject to the assent of the Crown —it
-became evident at an early stage in their history that
some form of union must eventually be achieved, if they
were to take any part commensurate with their import-
ance in promoting and profiting by the progressive and
civilising movements of the age. The agitation to-
wards this end began about the middle of last century,
.and was intermittently, and more or less enthusiasti-
cally, supported in each Colony or Dependency. Ques-
tions of inter-State importance, whiph there was no con-
stitutional provision for dealing with, emphasised the
position which sentiment had first established, and in
the closing years of the century, when the beneficial
possibilities of union had been manifested by the result
of joint action in many matters, the movement entered
upon its final phase.
This is neither the place nor time for contemplat-
ing the production of an historical record of the events
■of the period alluded to, but it would be impossible to
achieve the objects aimed at in this book, if some
reference were not made to them.
It has been shown that the Labor Party en-
tered the political arena prepared to undertake
all the responsibilities which attach to an organ-
isation professing to have national aspirations and
a national programme; and the proof of its ability
to honor those professions was rightly demanded of it
very early in its career, by the occurence of the final
phase of the Federation movement, to which reference
has been made. Although unsuccessful in having
elected to the Federal Conventions any of its nominees,
the Party did not remain silent when the issues
agreed upon at the Conventions were placed before
the country. It seemed to the leaders of the
Labor movement that, broad as was the franchise pro-
posed for the election of the people’s representatives
to the Federal Parliament, the powers proposed to be
granted to that body by the States would unduly limit
its functions in some directions, and leave loopholes
in others, for certain forms of legislation which would


retard the then rising tide of democratic
Fully persuaded that this view was right, and justified
by the circumstances, the Party opposed the adoption
of the proposed Constitution; and although eventually
unsuccessful in its efforts, it yet so established itself
in the good opinion of the electors that, when the first,
elections for the federal Parliament were held, its nomi-
nees captured one of the six State’s seats in the Senate,
and two of the seven State’s seats in the House of
Representatives; that in the Senate being held by the
Hon. Gregor McGregor, and those in the House of
Representatives by Messrs. E. L. Batchelor, representing
the district of Boothby, and A. Poynton, representing
the district of Grey.
The Party was more successful in the General Elec-
tions for the second Federal Parliament, when the Hon.
Gregor McGregor was given two comrades in the
Senate by the election of the Hon. R. S Guthrie and
Mr. W. Storrie, while both Mr. Batchelor and Mr. Poynion
were returned to the House of Representatives, accom-
panied by Mr. James Hutchison, who wrested the seat
for the district of Hindmarsh from the Hon. V. L
Solomon.
This Parliament is memorable because, thus early
in the history of the Commonwealth, the Australian
Labor Party for the first time assumed the responsibili-
ties of office. The leader of the Government was Mr.
J. C. Watson; an able, well-liked, and universally re-
spected representative of the Party in New South’
Wales, and it redounds to the credit of South Australia
that, out of her comparatively small delegation of six
members, two of them were selected for office, in the
persons of the Hon. Gregor McGregor, Vice-President of
the Senate, and Mr. E. L. Batchelor, Minister of Home*
Affairs.
In the third Federal Parliament, 1907-10, a fourth-
Labor Party nominee was elected to the Senate in the
person of the Hon. William Russell, the other represen-
tatives of the Party remaining the same as in the pre-
vious Parliament.
But a peculiar and unprecedented position occurred
at this election. Mr. Dugald Crosbie, one of the selected
candidates of the United Labor Party for the Senate,
had a majority of 16 votes on the first count, and would
have been declared elected had not Mr. Vardon, his
opponent, demanded a recount; this was granted, and,.


.at the second count it was found that Mr. Vardon led
Mr. Crosby by 34 votes, and he was therefore declared
duly elected. Almost immediately after this Mr. Cros-
by died, but it having come to light that certain votes
which had been declared informal but were not so,
would, if counted, probably turn the election, appeal was
made to the High Court that Mr. Vardon be declared
not elected, Mr. Justice Barton was appointed to hear
the case, and ordered the votes to be recounted; but
this it was found to be impossible to do, because of
the declaration of the Returning Officer for the District
of Angas that 9,000 voting papers had been destroyed.
Mr- Justice Barton decided that the unfortunate occur-
ence was no bar to a recount, and that having been
made, he declared that, but for the omission of initials
in certain voting papers Crosby would have been elec-
ted by a majority of four, and therefore he declared
Vardon’s election absolutely void-
The next step was to fill the vacant seat, and as
the Government of South Australia was advised that
■according to the terms of the Commonwealth Constitu-
tion the responsibility of doing so rested with the two
Chambers of the South Australian Parliament sitting
.and voting as one body, a meeting was duly convened
and Lieut-Col. the Hon. J. V. O’Loghlin was duly elec-
ted. But this most vastly bungled question was not
even now settled, for Mr. Vardon, deeming himself to
be aggrieved, appealed to the Court of Disputed Returns
against the legality of Mr. O’Loghlin’s appointment,
and the appeal, being submitted to the High Court, was
upheld, and Mr. O’Loghlin was unseated. At the sub-
election Mr. Vardon gained the seat.
The death of Mr. Kingston in May, 1908, gave
the Labor Party an opportunity of increasing its strength
in the House of Representatives by the return of Mr. E.
A. Roberts as his successor.
In the following year, on December 6, Mr. James
Hutchison, another stalwart of the Labor Party, died,
.and Mr. W. O. Archibald, ex-member for Port Adelaide
in the South Australian Parliament, and ex-leader of the
State Labor Party, was elected to the vacant seat.
The personnel of the representation of South Aus-
tralia in both Houses of the fourth Commonwealth
Parliament remained unchanged at the elections in
1910. But death was soon busy again amongst our
legislators, and the first stroke fell upon dear, kind,
lovable, and capable “Ted” Batchelor, with an unfore-
warned suddenness which has been, alas, too common


in the experience of our Party in its Commonwealth
representation. Mr. Batchelor died on October 10,
1911, and on account of the swing in local politics
which had then set in—and because of which the Verran
Government was defeated not long} afterwards —the
seat was temporarily lost to the Labor Party.
The year 1912 saw the second thinning of the ranks
of the Party in the Commonwealth Parliament by the
death, on July 3, of Senator William Russell; and for
the second time the duty of selecting a successor to a
deceased Senator devolved upon the Parliament of
South Australia. On this occasion the Conservative
combination, led by Mr. Peake, having a majority in.
both Houses, the will of the people of South Australia
as voiced at the previous Federal election was deliber-
ately defied, and a seat that had been won by a Labor
Part}/ nominee in the interests of democracy, was given
to a previously defeated candidate of the Reactionary
Liberal Union, in the person of Mr. J. W. Shannon.
This Parliament—the Parliament of 1910-13 —will be
long remembered because, for the first time in the his-
tory of Australia—and, indeed, of the world—an
entirely Labor Party Government, supported by majori-
ties of the same Party in both Houses of the Legisla-
ture, held the reins of Government for the full term of
the existence of the Parliament.
A very remarkable position was revealed at the
elections for the Federal Parliament in April, 1913,
when the Party which follows Mr. Joseph Cook was re-
turned with a majority of one in the House of Repre-
sentatives, but with a following of only six in the
Senate. The result of this extraordinary state of
affairs was a deplorably muddled condition of public
business, which at the moment of writing still con-
tinues. The remedy for this is, of course, entirely in
the hands of Mr. Cook, who has it in his power to bring
about a crisis which will either end m a dissolution or
the resignation of his Government; but as the lesson of
the recent State elections in New South Wales are-
doubtless to him as the writing on the wall, there is
little likelihood of the threatenmgs and complaints in,
which he has been indulging producing any—even the
mildest—kind of political disturbance.
The result of the election in this State was emi-
nently satisfactory to the South Australian Labor Party,
the success of its candidates at the polls giving it the
greatest representation it has yet enjoyed in the Com-
monwealth Parliament. By the goodwill of a majority


of the electors, every seat in the Senate has been cap-
tured by a nominee, and member, of the Labor Party;
for, on this occasion, the last of the Conservative ele-
ment, in the person of the late Mr. Joseph Vardon,
President of the Liberal Union, was rejected. Although
personally—and deservedly—esteemed, that gentleman
was not able to regain his seat, and Mr. Shannon and
Sir Josiah Symon were joined with him in defeat.
As illustrating the fickleness of political popularity,,
it is enough to say that the three gentlemen who
secured election to the Senate, Lieut.-Col. the Hon. J.
V. O’Loghlin and Messrs. John Newland and William
Senior, were all defeated at the previous elections for
the House of Assembly in South Australia, but secured
handsome majorities, little more than 12 months
afterwards, when appealing to the' whole State as a
constituency.
The result of the elections to the House of Repre-
sentatives was also very satisfactory, the seats pre-
viously held by their respective occupants being re-
tained, and the Boothby seat, temporarily lost on the
death of Mr. Batchelor, was regained by the magnificent
vote cast for Mr. George Dankel.
But, alas! the first session of the fifth Parliament
was destined to furnish one more victim to the Reaper
who had already gathered so great a harvest from our
State. Within a few clays of prorogation, Mr. E. A.
Roberts, the brilliant debater, the clear thinker, the
clean, hard-hitting controversialist and fighter, the
greatly trusted delegate of the people whom he repre-
sented, and the friend and advocate of the cause of the
class which he gloried in belonging to, was laid low. It
is hard to believe that the man whose impressive per-
sonality, and brilliant qualities, were so recently and so
continuously the subject of public interest, has passed
from the activities with which he was so closely and
familiarly associated, but so it is. Yet while those who
remain mourn the loss of “Alf” Roberts, the latest of
that splendid band of men, who having served their
day and generation faithfully, at length found rest, it
is a strength to the cause which he so zealously served,
that the memory of his fine example abides as an in-
spiration to those who are left to carry on the great
and sacred duty.
The seat rendered vacant by the death of Mr.
Roberts has been filled by the election of Mr. G. E.
Yates, late Secretary of the United Labor Party.


CHAPTER IV.
THE PLATFORM OF THE UNITED LABOR PARTY FROM
iBg3 TO 1914.
The Platform of the United Labor Party, as it was
presented to the public in 1891, may well be regarded
by the political economist as a document of surpassing
importance; and it is not too much to say that it also
possesses a distinctly historic value to the State. To
the former its importance is twofold; first, because it
supplies the link which is needed to connect up the
theories of the classic economists with the develop-
ments of the then most recent industrial and social
movements in this State; and second, because it pre-
sents in succinct form, the result of the matured
thought of what may be regarded as the most advanced
section of the democratic party in Australia at the time
of issue. Its historic value lies in the fact that it stands
for an epoch which is of as much significance in the
history of Australian industrial and social evolution, as
is the Hegira to the Mohammedan. Its significance—
as well as its fate —has much that classes it with the
famous charter of the Chartist Party in Great Britain,
for both were the product of circumstances, which,
allowing for the changes of three-quarters of a century,
had much that commonly distinguished them. Their
aims and objects were the same; there was little to
choose between the manner of the reception of either
one by the people—and both are in danger of being
forgotten, because modern thought has approved,
adopted, and embodied them in the Statute laws of our
country.
It is a splendid thing for the democracy of to-day,
as it will be for that of the future, that, as each step
on the path of a larger freedom is achieved, the pro-
gress made is recorded in enactments which are not
easily set aside; for Parliaments are not easily moved
on questions of national importance. “What we have
we hold/’ is a motto which, generally speaking, can be
appropriately applied to the achievements of the Party
which stands to-day, as it has always done, for truly
national political ideals. And that is said despite the
smashing blows aimed at it last session by the Conserva-


tive and Reactionary Party which now holds the reins
of Government in this State. Misusing the opportunities
afforded by its temporary occupancy of the seats of the
mighty, that party then laid the tram for a succession
of events which, should it be returned to power, will
certainly attack, if they do not undo, much of the bene-
ficent legislation in this State of the past two decades.
But, let it be not forgotten, that as the people of South
Australia willed those enactments, they may be cer-
tainly trusted to protect them; and who will doubt
that the tide which bears the argosies of democracy will
also sweep away the works of those who withstand it.
As a striking illustration of the soundly progressive
character of the policy advocated by the Labor Party at
every period of its existence, the following selection of
its official platform is appended.
As the platform of 1891 was the first in order, and
probably in importance, it is naturally given pride of
place.
PLATFORM.
1891.
1 • Protection for the purpose of encouraging - local industries
and the further development of the resources of the colony.
2 - Progressive tax on land values, or failing this, an increase
on the present tax, with exemption on small holdings.
3- —Lien’s Bill, for the better protection of workmen’s wages.
4. —Workshops and Factories Act, for the purpose of securing
adequate breathing space, to regulate and limit the hours
of labor, limit the age at which young persons may be em-
ployed, and provide sanitary arrangements in all buildings
used as workrooms and factories.
5. —Steam Boilers Inspection.
6. —Free Education.
7 Part XIX.
8. —Tax on Goods and Passengers carried intercolonially in.
Foreign Vessels.
q. —Amendment of the Railway Commissioners i\ct.
10. —Establishment of a Department of Labor.
11. —Redistribution of Seats on the basis of population.
12. —Adult Suffrage.
13. —Reform of Legislative Council in the direction of shortening
the term of election.
14. —Establishment of a State Bank.
15. —An Act to secure to tenant farmers just compensation for
improvements.
16. —Working Men’s Blocks and Loans to Blockers.
17. —Trades Hall Site.
18. —Eight Hours Bill.
19. —Removal of duties on tea, coffee, cocoa, and kerosene.
20. —Opposed to Free and Assisted Immigration.


PLATFORM.
1893.
When the platform was revised prior to the General Elections
in 1893 the following- items were added to the list of reforms
necessary: —
21. —Stopping further sale of Crown Lands.
22. —Amendment of Electoral Laws, giving greater facilities for
transfer of electors names.
23. —Restricting candidates’ expenses at elections.
24. —Making permanent the Absent Voters Bill.
25. —Early Closing Bill.
26. —Amendment of Mining Act.
27. —Amendment of Marine Board and Navigation Act.
28. —Repeal of the Indian Immigration Acts.
29. —Prohibiting the influx of Asiatics and restricting the intro-
duction of immigrants bound to service before arrival in
South Australia.
30. —The Referendum.
31. —The establishing of a State Export Department.
Those platforms, embodying the policy of the
U.rpted Labor Party at the very earliest period of its
existence, give the lie to the often repeated assertion
that, “it was not a national party, and had no outlook
beyond the claims of the class which stood behind it.”
Reference to the 3 1 articles of this political creed will
establish beyond dispute that the faith of those who
hammered it out was a living faith; clear-eyed, far-see-
ing, and inclusive of the interests of the people in all
their civic and national relationships.
• At the following triennial period, which was deter-
mined upon as a suitable lapse of time for the revision
and re-statement of the platform, it was found that the
position of affairs was as follows; —
Of the 31 Articles agreed to in 1891-3, two had
been abandoned, viz., Nos. 8 and 30; three had been
revised prior to the 1893 elections, viz., Nos. 1- 13, and
19; sixteen HAD BECOME THE LAW OF THE LAND,
viz., Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24,
26, 27, and 31; while 10 remained as a reminder that
although much of the policy had been achieved, a third
of it was still left for future attainment.
The Platform of 1896 indicates a further advance in
the legislative outlook of the Party, and furnishes ad-
ditional disproof—if that were needed —of the allegation
that its operations were sectional and not national in
scope.


PLATFORM.
1896.
i. —Stopping any further alienation of Crown lands, and sub-
stituting instead a system of leasing.
-2. —The remission of the duties on tea in bulk, raw coffee, cocoa,
kerosene, and upon articles which are not grown nor pro-
duced in the colony; any resulting deficiency to be made up
by increasing the tax on land values.
3. —Amendment of Land Values Assessment Act of 1893 (known
as Part XIX.) on the lines of Mr. F. J. Hourigan’s Bill of
1895.
4- —Encouragement of local industries and the further develop-
ment of the resources of the colony.
.5.- —A Steam Boilers Inspection and Registration Bill, an Early
Closing Bill, reform of the Shipping Laws, amendment of
the Employers’ Liability Act, amendment of Liens Act of
1893, a minimum rate of wages and maximum hours of labor
in Government contracts and works.
<6. —Amendment of the Electoral Laws by giving greater facili-
ties for the registration and transfer of electors, and a re-
distribution of seats on a basis of population.
7- —Reform of the Legislative Council in the direction of short-
ening the term of membership, and liberalising the franchise
to leaseholders and occupiers.
8. —The extension of the Department of Labor.
9. —The extension of the functions of the State Bank.
.10. —State ownership of all railways.
*ll.—Repeal of the Indian Immigration Acts, and prohibiting the
influx of Asiatic and servile races, and restricting the intro-
duction of immigrants bound to service before arrival in
South Australia.,
a 2. —The introduction of the referendum on the lines of Mr. E. L.
Batchelor’s Bill of 1895.
U3- —The extension of the State Export Department for wheat,
wool, wine, and other agricultural and horticultural produce
by giving assistance in the shape of advances and facilities
of transit, so that producers may be able to obtain the full
benefit of foreign markets.
114. —Morgagors’ Liability Limitation Bill.
n 5. —Encouragement and development of the mining industry.
16. —Federation on a Democratic basis.
117. —In favor of any equitable and reasonable claims of women
for the amendment of the laws.
The legislation of the 1896-9 Parliament did very-
little towards the fulfilment of the Platform of 1896, so
that in 1899, when the period for revision arrived, there
I was not much to add, and the alterations made did not
•at all affect principles which were previously laid down.
The additions and alterations were as follows; —
No. 15 on the 1896 Platform omitted because it was
rregarded as too non-commital in that form.


Three new anddmportant planks added, viz.;—
1. Abolition of Distress for Rent.
2. State Insurance.
3. Old Age Pensions.
Nos. 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12 revised as follows; —
5. —A Steamßoilers Explosions Bill, Early Closing Bill, Work-
men’s Compensation Bill (including seamen), amend-
ment of Shops and Factories Act, fixing a Minimum Rate of
Wage and Maximum Hours where practicable, amendment
of 'Workmen’s Liens Act,
6. —Amendment of Electoral Laws and a Redistribution of
Seats, by an alteration of the Boundaries upon a populadon
basis.
7. —Household Suffrage for Legislative Council, and shortening
the term of membership,
10. —The State ownership of all Railways, and State or Municipal
ownership of tramways.
11. —Repeal of Indian Immigration Acts, prohibition of the influx
of Asiatic and servile races, and restriction of the introduc-
tion of immigrants bound to service before arrival in the
colony.
12. —The introduction of the Initiative and Referendum.
When the next period for revision occurred, the
Province of South Australia had become a State. Pre-
serving the independence secured to her under the Com-
monwealth Constitution which she had accepted, South
Australia had yet necessarily yielded certain functions
to the higher power, and, as a consequence of this, the
State Platform of the Labor Party was altered to ex-
clude those items which were within the scope of
Federal legislation. This also necessitated the state-
ment of a Federal Platform, and from this point onward,
the objectives of the United Labor Party are carefully
formulated under Federal and State Platforms, the State
Platform being the work of the State Conferences of the
Party, while the Federal Platform is the work of Federal
Conferences of States’ representatives.
The State Platform of 1902 was a compact docu-
ment of 16 Clauses, which included all the items of the
previous platform which had neither been carried, nor
passed on to the Federal Conference. The following is
its full text —
PLATFORM.
(Revised October 3, iqio.)
1. —Stopping any further alienation of Crown Lands.
2. —Amendment of Land Values Assessment Act.
3. —Conciliation and Compulsory Arbitration Bill.
4. — Encouragement and fuller developing of the Pastoral, Agri-
cultural, Mining, and other resources of the State.


5- Minimum Wage of 7/ per day for all adult males employed
by the State or on State Contracts.
r 6. —Steam Boilers Bill; amendment of Early Closing and Work-
men’s Liens Acts; Extension of Wages Boards and Work-
men’s Compensation Act.
7- Adult Suffrage for Legislative Council and shortening the
term of membership.

During fhe regime of the Jenkins Government, and
when the Conservative influence, of the section of Parlia-
ment, led by Mr. John Darling, was evident in every act
of administration as well as legislation, it was hardly to
be expected that much attention would be given to the
programme of a Party avowedly hostile to it. But a
better day was at the dawning. With the departure of
Mr. Jenkins for London as Agent-General, and the de-
feat of Mr. John Darling at the General Elections in
1905, democracy came into its own—for a time—and the
record of the succeeding years shows how well that
period was utilised to promote the welfare of the State.
The Platform upon which the Labor Party appealed
to the people on this momentous occasion, consisted of
the previous programme with several unimportant omis-
sions and amendments, but with the addition of 8
clauses which broke entirely new ground, and gained for
the Party the cordial support of many people who ap-
proved the_ statesmanlike view of affairs which their in-
clusion indicated. The Platform was as follows:

It may be supposed that with a Government in
power, supported by the Labor and Liberal Parties, the
years 1905-9 would have witnessed the enactment of
much of the legislation foreshadowed in the 1905 Plat-


form, but while many undoubtedly useful measures were
placed upon the Statute Books during that period, the
obstructive and reactionary conduct of the Legislative
Council blocked the passage of others, and Parliament
was brought to a close in an atmosphere of disappointed
hopes and intense bitterness of feeling. And there was-
reason for both.
In the closing months of Mr. Price’s life, it was very
apparent that the compact between the Labor and
Liberal Parties had become galling to both, and during
a week-end visit to a country district at that time, Mr.
Peake in an unguarded, or candid, moment—it is not
known which—gave utterance to sentiments which indi-
cated that he at least was prepared for a change. That
change came at Mr. Price’s death, when, unwilling to
continue an arrangement which meant his subordination
in office to another member of the Labor Party, Mr.
Peake cut the bond by accepting the office of Premier
himself.
From that time onward the Labor Party has been
made to realise more than ever the futility of "attempting
to carry its programme of teform against the opposition
of a second chamber which is only responsible to an in-
significant minority of the people. During the two years
of the Verran Government’s administration, legislation
for the amelioration of industrial conditions carried in
the House of Assembly, unfailingly met with ignominious
rejection in the Legislative Council, and for that reason,
as well as because of the absorption of the, at one time,,
Liberal section of the House of Assembly by the re-
actionary party which dominates it, the assistance which
the Labor Party had a right to expect has been with-
held, to the disadvantage of the country.
The Platforms of 1909 and 1913 are included here
to show that the Party is alive to the great questions
which mean so much to the people. They are witnesses
to the far-sightedness and sense of justice of those who
compiled them, but, alas, they also bear testimony to
the power of the oligarchy in this State to suppress the
people’s will. As a final word on this matter, it may be
saM that, in view of the legislation which was passed in
the session of 1913, by which the Legislative Council
is secured to the Conservative Party of this State as an
appanage until some means are discovered by which it
can be disposessed, class rule in its worst and mosf ob-
noxious form must prevail ,and the cause of the people
must inevitably suffer in a corresponding degree.

CHAPTER V.
THE PLATFORM OF THE COMMONWEALTH LABOR.
PARTY 1901 TO 1914.
The election of representatives to the first Common-
wealth Parliament was fought by the State Parties oa
Platforms practically consisting of those planks in the
State Pkuiorms, which had a bearing on conditions that
came within the purview of the superior legislature.
In South Australia that platform was short, but in-
clusive of great national issues. It provided for.
A White Australia.
Old Age Pensions.
Federal control of railways and navigable rivers.
Non-alienation of hederal Territory.
The fiscal question was left open.
In December, 1902, a conference of delegates from
all the States was held in Sydney to draft the first official'.
Platform of the Commonwealth Labor Party, and the-
document is submitted as a model of brevity and inclu-
siveness, in dealing with issues of high national impor-
tance.

No revision of the Federal Platform took place until
the General Conference of State delegates, which was
held in Brisbane in July, 1908; but in November, 1906,
a manifesto, which was to all intents and purposes a
platform, was issued above the signature of Mr. J. C.
Watson, Chairman, and Mr. Frank Tudor, Secretary of
the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, dealing discur-
sively with the policy which was then before the country
This document reaffirmed the Platform of 1902, with
the addition of two planks dealing with—
(a) Tariff Referendum.
(b) Progressive Tax on Unimproved Land Values.
The 1908 conference made very little alteration in
•the platform; only adding two planks, viz.—
(a) New Protection.
(b) Commonwealth Bank.
The most recent platform is that which was adopted
at Hobart in Janury, 1912, and it is appended to show
the policy up to date.

CHAPTER VI.
WHAT THE PARTY HAS DONE AND HELPED TO DO IN
PARLIAMENT.
A review of the period during which the South Aus-
tralian Parliamentary Labor Party has been in existence
contains much that should cause every lover of
Australia the most -propound satisfaction. For
laying aside for the moment any thought of the things
'7 ICI " ave p ee n attempted but not accomplished, and
those other things that reveal weaknesses in party organ-
isation which have militated against the achievement of
successes that were well-withm its reach, there yet re-
mains a splendid record of things done which, if they
had not been done, would have left Australia and its
people lagging, where they now lead.
In the record of achievements of the Party must
also be included a fair and due recognition of the assis-
ance received from those friends of democracy who
stand outside its pale. Of such friends there are, and
ave been, many who deserve to be remembered with
gratitude. Not seeing eye to eye with the Labor Party
m all things, they have yet rendered generous and help-
f Rnc \ lt: woul d be as ungrateful as unwise,
to withhold from them the acknowledgement of helpful-
ness which is their due and our privilege to give.
In this connection, the hope is suggested that the
day may come, when the forces of democracy shall be
so united, that party issues and personal ambitions will
no longer divide them, and Australia will march to what
should be her splendid destiny, unhindered and strength-
ened, by a loyal union of her faithful and devoted people.
. Amongst the things done, and helped to be done, by
le Labor Party in Parliament, is the enactment of some
ot the most humane and wise laws which adorn the Stat-
ute books of any country in the world; and the fact that
this has been accomplished, may surely be regarded as
a pledge of even better things to come.
The list appended is not regarded as a complete re-
cord ot all that has engaged the attention of the Labor
Party; for jnuch of the best work of its members in
Parliament nas been rendered in fighting determinedly
against such proposals of the enemies of democracy as
the Constitution Amendment Bill, which was carried by
the Peake Government in 1913. Reading between the
lines it will be seen that the Labor Party has ever con-


sistently thrown the weight of its influence into the scale
on the side of the people, as against any section of
them; and, following such a policy, who can doubt that
the country will give more and more support to the party
which is rendering such patriotic service to the State.

CHAPTER VII.
THE MEN OF “’93.” AN APPRECIATION.
It is of importance in every movement that the per-
sonality of its sponsors and advocates should be accep-
table in every way to those to whom appeal is made;
and by just as much as they fall short of that which im-
presses and commands confidence and esteem, may it
be said that a cause is prejudiced or weakened. For
the objects of a movement, and the methods by which
their accomplishment are sought, are not the only things
by which it is judged, although it is admitted that, if
these are unworthy, nothing else can possibly redeem
it. True of all movements, it is pre-eminently -■>;) of
those which deal with the facts upon which human re-
lationships, and the conditions which govern society in
all its interests, are built. For it is inconceivable that,
ignorance, prejudice, and intolerance can ever be safe
guides where knowledge, sympathy, and infinite patience
.and kindness are so much needed; and where, lacking
these, no amount of personal charm and bonhomie will
achieve more than a passing advantage.
Casting a retrospective glance over the outstanding
features of the Labor movement since its advent as an
.active agent in the sphere of politics as such, but more
especially as they are shewn in the sphere of industrial
and social reform, there is nothing more conspicuous or
impressive than the personality of the men who were its
earliest chosen leaders. Leaving aside the many names
which occur to those who remember the time in the late
eighties of last century, when the South Australian Un-
ited Labor Party was formed, and making selection of
that smaller band to whom the care and management of
the workers’ cause was committed, memories are stirred
which fall the heart with gratitude. Twenty-five years,
or little more, have passed since then, but how those
years are filled with reminders of momentous and epoch-
making service, and of thoughts of men upon whose
fidelity, caution, patience, and ability, the right guidance
of the beginnings of a great movement depended? Real-
ise that, until that time the cause of the workers had
no direct advocates in Parliament, and that the cry for
reform of conditions was only an inchoate utterance,
faintly heard —if heard at all—in the only place from
which a remedy could come.


Affairs of State, in those days, did not include as
■a speciality the affairs of the people upon whom the State
utself is based; and statesmen of even the broadest and
most liberal mind, were content to deal with the symp-
toms of the social trouble which was evolving, rather
than with the causes which lay behind them. How wise
—if inexperienced in the intricacies of statecraft—were
those men who first stood up before their peers in Parlia-
ment to represent a side of society which had not previ-
ously enjoyed that privilege, let the history of the last
quarter of a century declare. Untrained in politics, but
taught in the school of experience, they gave their lives
to a cause which could only live by the self-sacrifice and
devotion of its advocates, and which would have been
condemned beyond all hope of survival had they not main-
tained a reputation for personal honor and integrity, that
could stand the test of time —as well as the immediately
personal attacks of open enmity and ill-concealed male-
volence.
What that group of representatives of the workers
which entered Parliament in 1893 lacked in numbers it
gamed in knowledge of the facts with which it was
p edged to deal. Each member of the Party was there
by virtue of his ability to do something; not to talk, but
But he was there also because he was trusted;
having proved his worth in the important, if minor
sphere in which personality and ability were familiarly
known and appreciated.
And who were those men? those trusted champions
ot the cause? those pioneers of a movement which was
destined to gather to itself so rich a harvest of power, in-
fluence and responsibility? Workers, all of them! Wor-
kers with hand and brain; men whose logic and acumen
had been acquired and shaped in a school where the
acts ot life were their books and experience their school-
master. It must not be said—because it would not be
true—-that those men were fully equipped for the work
to which they were called; but if not of them, of whom
can dbe said at all? Who of all the thousands that have
Tendered service to their fellows in halls of legislature
have come to their work armed and prepared at all points?
And which of them have not had to pass through a mill
whicn stripped them of many things that they deemed
at first to be necessary and important? The truth is
that those pioneers of the Labor movement in Parliament
had as little to learn as any of the class into whose com-
P ar *y came; and, generally speaking, their training
made them more receptive of the facts of the things that


mattered, and less likely to be mislead by their appear-
ances. They were men with an immense capacity for
work, an infinity of patience, and an unswerving loyalty
to ideals. So much may be said of all of them; even
of those who in course of time seceded from the move-
ment; for it may be believed of them that the fuller re-
velation of what the Labor movement meant found them
unprepared to “follow the gleam”; but, up to the light
they had, they kept to the course as they saw it.
Look at the names of those earliest battlers for a
great cause; that “roll of honor” which means so much
to those who, in the fight to-day, are blessed with an
appreciative spirit of the pioneers who cleared the ground
for their operations.
Archibald Andrew Kirkpatrick, essentially a politi-
cian; diplomatic, shrewd, with an ever working and cal-
culating mind behind an apparently simple manner; quick,
to get at the heart of a thing, and skilful in the use of
opportunity, he entered politics as to the manner born,,
and has fulfilled every function, as private member, Min-
ister of the Crown, and Agent-General, with marked
ability and success.
Robert Storrie Guthrie; a man who brought to the
legislative sphere, natural abilities and a training which
marked him out at once as the trustworthy friend and
adviser of that long neglected and illused class of mem
who earn their scanty living upon the sea. The sailors,
friend and champion; and —unusual tribute to the honor,
integrity and ability of the chosen representative of a
class —equally trusted and esteemed by those who employ
them.
Henry Adams; quiet, thoughtful, unaggressive but
steadfast; the kind of man, who, having learned “to*
labor and to wait,” gives strength and stability to any
cause he espouses.
Gregor McGregor; sturdy and strong as ; he *ound
of his own name; vigorous and alert of mind—and tuat
stored with a wealth of knowledge of a marvellously
varied kind. Thoughtful, keenly humorous, wise in
council, logical in debate, masterly in action; yet withal 1
humble of mind and mien, and the friend of everybody.
John Abel McPherson; gone to his rest these many
years, but his name as familiar to-day in the ears of
the class amongst whom his life was spent, as when*
twenty-three years ago he stood alone in that chamber,,
where he was their earliest representative. Who that
knew him will ever forget the earnest regard with which?


3ie looked upon the affairs of life? Honesty of purpose
< nHrui Ul,ll f- S , every act and deed > unselfishness of
outlook marking him as a ready sacrifice for all good
■causes. First of that band of stalwarts who kept the
ag flying to lay down his life with the weapons of his
warfare, he bequeathed an example of honor, fidelity and
hope tTexcer 7 ’ a " m&y emulate > but none can
Frank Houngan; the next to enter the unknown.
Big, tender, warmhearted Irishman; ever thoughtful of
the distressed, and untiringly active in their relief, he
combined with a truly philanthropic and kindly nature a
■clear perception of econonic difficulties and principles,
which, all through his career in Parliament, impressed his
•opponents ano compelled their esteem. Poor in material
things, no man was richer in the love and affection of
those who called him friend.
-p Thomas Price; dear, lovable, never to be forgotten
lorn; how many hearts still echo with the sound of
ns voice, and ache with the thought that it is silenced
here tor evermore? Loved for his boyish light hearted-
ness, trusted ror his shrewdness and wisdom; admired
or his natural charm and gifts of eloquence and friend-
imess, he won his way to the hearts of opponents as well
as nends, and held his place there by virtue of stronger
qualities winch commanded respect and esteem.
James Hutchison; mercurial of mind and body; ever
ready to do a service for another, and capable as ready,
the soul of kindness; nothing calculated but the imme-
diate need of the deed, and that never repented of even
'when the hand that did it was bitten by calculating in-
gratitude. With unbounded energy, and well-tried‘cap-
f city /or affairs, it is certain that, had he lived, he would
Lave kept a foremost place m the ranks of his Party.
Egerton Lee Batchelor; who more lovable then he
■oi more worthy to be loved? With character strong
•and sweet, and ability beyond question, he was early
f ° r J eaclershl P; an d when it came, how well he
fulfilled its duties is known and affirmed bv all who were
associated with him.
Hf that splendid band of men who were returned to
-Parliament in the House of Assembly in 1893, some are
still with us, honored for the loyalty of their service, and
trusted for the ability and keeness which they have* ever
♦exhibited in doing it. It is a duty and delight to record
the appreciation in which these gentlemen are held by
; their fellow-workers in this great movement.


William Oliver Archibald; a man with strong opin-
ions, but whose right to hold them is based upon a sound
judgement and wide range of reading; a strong debater
and faithful to his Party, his fairness to political oppon-
ents has ever been a conspicuous and admirable feature
in both character and conduct.
Frederick William Coneybeer; debonaire, light
hearted, merrymannered; the burden bearer of many
causes which benefit by association with him, a shrewd
judge of the value of things political; a good friend and
a fair foe, he carries with him the esteem and confidence
of many outside, as well as inside, the Party to which
he belongs.
Ivor MacGillivray; a typical Scot in his shrewd es-
timate of the value of things; firm in opinion as sound in
principle; not easy 7 to know, but, when known, held in
affection for a deep kindness of heart which never fails
in the service of his friends.
W. A. Robinson —like others of that first selected
band of men who, having fought the earliest battles of
the People’s Party, and passed from the field of active
political strife—are too little known by the generation of
to-day; yet to those who worked with him, and them,
the name recalls many a scene in which he figured as a
valorous and clean fighter in a cause which demanded
and received the best that he could give- Mr. Robinson
was ever an alert and resourceful protagonist, keenly
alive to every move on the political chessboard, never
shunning an issue, and quick to avail himself of an ad-
vantage. Like the late Hon. Thomas Price, and Messrs.
Anstey, Ponder, and Smeaton, he gamed his training for
serious politics in the early days and associations of
Union Parliament, where he was regarded as a foemaa
worthy of the steel of the best.
These are the men of “’93”; the men who served
and some who still serve, their country, as specialists of
a class, but as representatives of the people as a whole.
In this brief record there is neither desire nor intention*
to ascribe extraordinary qualities to them; they were,
and are, men who gained and kept the confidence of the
people they represented by virtue of their consistent
loyalty and the hi eh quality of their service. In these
their example stands as a witness of what is most
manded in the representatives of a great cause, and it
may well be an inspiration to those who, bearing the
brunt of the battle to-day, are called to fight on lines-
which change with every change in the conditions of
things, but on principles which are as fixed and sure as
the rock of truth itself.
