“THE NEW IDEA” BOOK OF HOME DRESSMAKING. 1
A General Guide to
Dressmaking.
A Few Words on the Choice of Materials .
'T'HIS book has been
A published with the
view of helping the home
dressmaker with her prob-
lems. By following out
carefully the instructions
given, there is no need for
a frock that is made at
home to look home-made.
Just a few words about
suitable materials. The
slim figure may al-
most any material, soft,
stiff, thick or transparent.
The not-so-slim or medium
figure will look best in
soft, semi-stiff or trans-
parent. The outsize fig-
ure should concentrate on
soft, fine, firm materials
and clinging materials.
All underlinings should
be shrunk with a dam])
cloth and very hot iron be-
fore being tacked to any
garment. Woollen ma-
terial, such as suitings for
coats and skirts, coats.
skirts, should bo well
shrunk before cutting out.
Cotton or linen materials
should be shrunk in cold
w r ater, and pressed when
nearly dry.
Before Cutting Out.—
Make any adjustments
necessary in the pattern.
If the pattern is too long-
waisted, take a tuck in
bodice, back and front,
about half-way up the
bodice If the skirt is too
long, take a tuck in skirt,
back and front, just below
the hips, about 12 inches
down from waist. Shorten
and lengthen sleeve below
elbow. For a comfortable
fit, the pattern should
measure about 2 inches
more than measurements
taken. Diagram 1 also
illustrates how to lengthen
pattern. Insert pieces of
paper at back of pattern,
to lengthen.


For one-way design ma-
terials, lay pattern pieces
all in one direction.
One-Way Design and
Nap Materials. —For ma-
terials with a nap, such as
velvet or velveteen, pat-
tern pieces should be laid
on with the darkest way
downward. For materials
with a flat surface, such
as face-cloth, pan velvet,
JOINS.
If material is not wide
enough, and has to be
joined, always join a
straight edge to straight
edge. For instance, if a
piece has to be joined
along a selvedge, join the
piece on with selvedge to
selvedge (Fig. 8). If the
material is a figured,
etc., pattern should be
laid on with nap down-
ward, all pieces in one
direction.
striped or checked ma-
terial, join in as far as
possible to the pattern. A
strip of material cut on
the bias should always be
joined on the slant (Fig.
9), never straight across.
A join in thick material
can be made almost in-
visible by stitching and
pressing the join; then
darn across the seam on
the right side with a
thread taken from the
material (Fig. 10). Press
well after darning. Join

over the other, and sew

Two rows of stitching
make a firm join.
To Jain Narrow Edg-
ing.— Top sew the two
edges together with very
close stitches.
To Join Interlining.—
Place the edges together
flat over each other, and
stitch along both edges
(Fig. 12), this prevents
the join showing through
the material on the right
side. Always stitch and
press joins before tacking
ii]) any garment. Stitch
and press seams as you go
along.
CUTTING OUT.
Now before cutting out
any garment study the
pattern carefully two or
three times Measure the
length of the skirt, sleeve,
underarm seam, hip and
waist. Mark the pattern
to correspond with the
measurements. It is a
good scheme to measure a
frock that you have been
wearing and is a good fit.
Always choose the largest
table you have for cutting
out. Plenty of pins; tape
measure. If dark ma-
terial, a piece of tailor’s
chalk and a pair of sharp
scissors, the largest you
have. One cannot cut out
successfully with blunt
scissors, large or small. A
small pair of scissors
means snipping out your
frock, besides taking twice
as long. Having the table
all clear for cutting, place


a chair at one end; place
the material on the chair.
Now take one end and
draw it on to the table,
and level with the opposite
end of the table. Place
the edge of material to the
edge of the table and the
eut edge in line with the
end of the table. By
placing material in this
Now pin the pattern
pieces to material, follow-
ing the cutting out dia-
gram piece for piece (Fig.
1). Pin all pieces in posi-
tion. As the material on
the table becomes used,
roll it up with pattern
pinned on, and draw T an-
other length of material
on to the table. When all
manner you are sure of
the grain in the material
being quite straight.
For one-day design ma-
terials lay pattern pieces
all in one direction.
One-Way Design and
Nap Materials.— For ma-
terials with a nap, such as
velvet or velveteen, pat-
tern pieces should be laid
on with the darkest way
downward. For materials
with a flat surface, such
as face-cloth, pan velvet,
etc., pattern should be laid
on with nap downward,'all
pieces in one direction.
the pattern is pinned on,
start and cut out, leaving
the pattern pieces still
pinned to material. Now
mark each notch with a
thread mark or chalk
mark so that its position
will be clear when you
make up. All seams must
be tacked before stitching.
Stitch and press seams as
you go along.
DARTS.
Darts should be gradu-
ated carefully off to noth-
ing (Fig. 2). A short
dart ending abruptly is


unsightly. Notches must
correspond, otherwise
your frock is not balanced
correctly.
Pin seams together be-
fore tacking. A long tuck
with a short tack between
(Fig. 3) will hold seams
firmer than a long tack-
ing. Always tuck on a
table or flat surface—not
in your hand, or on your
knee.
TAILOR’S THREAD-
MARKING.
This is a tacking used
for tracing seams or pleats
where it is necessary that
two parts of a garment
should be marked the
same. Take a long thread
of double cotton; no knot
is needed. Make a small
tacking stitch through the
two thicknesses of ma-
terial on the chalk line,
tacking both under and
top parts of material to-
gether, leaving loops of
thread as on diagram
(Fig. 4). Now carefully
draw T the two pieces of
material apart, and cut
the stitches between them.
The outline of the seams
or pleats will be traced by
a line of short threads on
both pieces of material

exactly with each other.
Tack seams in velvet

ficult to keep velvet from

stitched, on account of the
pile. It is a good scheme
to pin the seams as well as
tacking th e m bef o r e

pinned across the seam

(Fig. 6), they can easily
be stitched over.
Place paper under geor-
gette or any flimsy ma-
terial when stitching.
Stitch through paper; the
paper can easily be re-
moved after stitching.
This prevents the seam
tightening, and mak e s
stitching easy.
PRESSING SEAMS.
Woollen materials will
scorch more quickly than
cotton or silk. When
pressing seams in wool-
len materials use a damp
cloth over the seams. For
thick cloth, the seam will
lie much flatter if soaped
each side before opening.
Cotton material, silk or
satins must not be damped
for pressing. Velvet must
not be pressed flat, but the
seams held at each end and


passed over the edge of
the hot iron (Fig. 7).
Velveteen may be pressed
flat. To remove unneces-
sary fullness, damp a
cloth and press it away
with a hot iron. If press-
ing leaves shine marks,
press over the marks with
a damp cloth, the steam
will remove the shine.
This applies to woollen
materials only. If velvet
has been marked, put a
damp cloth over a hot iron
and hold the velvet over
the steam. The steam will
bring the pile up again.
Stitc hin g Sea ms . —PI ace
paper under georgette, or
any flimsy material when
stitching. Stitch through
paper; the paper can
easily be removed after
stitching. This prevents
the seam tightening, and
makes stitching easy.
BINDING ON LEAFLET.
Bound Buttonholes on Leaflet
—Worked Buttonholes.
Worked buttonholes
should have an interlining
between the two materials
to strengthen the button-
hole. Mark and cut but-
tonhole large enough for
button to pass through
easily, otherwise stretch-

ing the buttonhole to pass
the button through soon
pulls the buttonhole out of
shape. Cut a tiny piece
out of the buttonhole, the
end near the edge of gar-
ment (Fig. 13) ; cut it out
as round as possible.
Oversew the edges of the
buttonhole with silk, this
holds the edges together

and keeps the buttonhole
from fraying (Fig. 14).
Thread a needle with linen
thread double, and pass
the needle through from
the wrong side in the
straight end of the button-
hole. This thread should
be held along the edge of
the buttonhole on the left
side (Fig. 15). Thread a
needle with buttonhole


twist, and buttonhole the
edge over the linen thread
(Fig. 16). When button-
hole is finished, pass the

linen thread through to
wrong side. Now pull
both ends of linen thread,

edges of buttonhole. Make
a small bar across end of
buttonhole, and sew ends
of linen thread firmly

POCKETS.
Piped or Bound Pocket.
—Mark with chalk where
pocket is to go (Fig 17).
Thread mark through to
wrong side on chalk line.
Tack a piece of interlin-
ing, cut on the bias, about
8 inches wide and 1 inch
longer than pocket, over
the thread mark on the
wrong side. Tack shape
of pocket through inter-
lining from right side
(Fig. 18). Now cut a
piece of material on the
bias about the same size
as the piece of interlining
(Fig. 19). Tack this piece
over thread mark on right
side, keeping the pocket
mark in the centre of bias
piece. Stitch round the
thread mark on the wrong


side about one-eighth of
an inch from thread mark
on each side. Stitch
straight across ends of
pocket mark (Fig. 20).
Cut between stitching to
about one-eighth of an
inch from each end. Now
snip into the corners at
the ends of pocket, taking
care not to cut the stitch-
ing (Fig. 21). Turn the
bias piece of material
through the cut to the
wrong side. Pull the ends
through. Hold the bias
piece close to the edge of
pocket to form a piping.
Tack firmly in place.
Now catch both edges of
pocket together with a
tacking thread (Fig. 22).
Press. Cut the inside
jjockets. The top pocket
piece must be of the same
material as the garment.
The under piece of lining.
Tack top pocket piece to
back of piping (Fig, 23).
The lining pocket piece is
tacked to lower edge of
piping (Fig. 21). Stitch
along top edge of pocket
as close to the piping as
possible. Stitch under
pocket to edge of bias
piece, taking care to pin
top pocket out of the way
of stitching. Now stitch
the other edge of pocket
close to piping. Tack top
and under pocket to


gether. Stitch round edge
(Fig. 25). Finish across
ends of pocket on right
side with needle and
thread.
Pocket with Flap.—
Mark pocket with a thread
line. Tack a piece of in-
terlining cut in the bias to
back of thread line on the
wrong side. Tack the
made-up flap and one
piece of the pocket to the
thread line, both edges
meeting, on the right side
(Fig. 25). Stitch along
edges. Cut between stitch-
ing and snip into corners.
Turn the pocket through


to the wrong side, binding
the lower edge with it
(Fig. 26). Turn the flap
down, and tack the turn-
ing at top down (Fig, 27).
Stitch along top of bind-
ing. Tack top pocket to
under pocket, and stitch
round edge. Stitch top
pocket to top of flap (Fig.
28). Sew across ends of
pockets firmly with a
strong thread.
Patch Pockets, or Out-
side Pockets.— Turn in
and tack round edge of
pocket. Turn in and
stitch hem across top of
pocket (Fig. 29). If
pocket has a shaped piece
(§)
at top, turn in and tack
lower edge. Tack top
edge of piece to top of
pocket on the wrong side.
Stitch across top (Fig.
31), and turn piece over,
and tack on right side.
Stitch piece to pocket
(Fig. 32).
Pockets for coats such
as tweeds or tMck woollen
material should be lined


(Fig. 33) before stitching
to coat. The lining keeps
the pocket in shape.
Press pockets. Tack and
stitch to garment. Patch
pockets sh o uld b e
strengthened with a piece
of material or interlining
at each end. Sew pocket
along top about J inch in
from edge through to in-
ter lining. Fasten end of
thread off firmly.
COAT FACINGS AND
COLLAR FACINGS.
Cut coat facings a little
larger than coat fronts.
Tack facing to front and
round top of lapel to-
where collar is joined on.
Have the facing a little on
the full side as the lapel
has to roll over at edge.
Tack collar facing to col-
lar round edge (Fig. 34),
keep collar facing on the
loose side also. Stitch
round facing and collar.
Turn facing out, and tack
round edge on right side.
Tack two or three rows of
tacking up lapel, holding
the lapel over the hand
when tacking to keep
facing loose. Turn in and
tack neck edge of facing
to neck of coat. Turn out
collar facing, tack round


edge on right side. Tack
two or three rows of tack-
ing along collar, holding
collar over hand in same
way as lapel to keep the
facing loose. Now turn in
and tack neck edge of col-
lar to neck edge of facing,
both edges just meeting

lining. Turning up length

ming it to edge of coat.
Stitch round edge of
fronts and collar. Take
out tackings, and press.
WORKING A SPRATS
HEAD.
This is an excellent way
of finishing the ends of
piped pockets, finishing
the top of pleats, or to
give a trimming to the end
of a dart or seam. Tack
a piece of interlining at
the back of the material,
where you want to work
the sprat’s head,. On the
right side mark a triangle


with tailor’s chalk to de-
note the size of the sprat’s
head (Fig. 36). Com-
mence at the top of the tri-
angle, bringing the needle
through from the wrong
side. Now take a stitch
from corner to corner of
the base of the triangle
(Fig. 37). Take the next
stitch from side to side of
the top of the triangle,
using the chalk marks as
guides (Fig. 38). Con-
OP TRIANGLE
tinue working from top to
base in this way, taking
the bottom stitches just in-
side each other along the
base line, and the top
stitches just below each
other from side to side of
the triangle until the
whole space has been filled
(Fig. 39). Use button-
hole twdst for working
sprat’s head.
FINISHING WRIST EDGE
OF SLEEVES.
Cut a strip of canvas or
hoi land on the bias, about
3 inches wide. Tack the
strip round the wrist edge
of sleeve (Fig. 40). Turn
CANVAS OR LINEN

up the edge of the sleeve
on the canvas, tack, press,
and then herringbone


down the raw edge on to
the canvas (Fig. 41).
Catch up the length of
coat the same way as the
sleeve (Fig. 42), taking
care not to draw the
thread too tightly.
TO PUT IN A COAT
LINING.
Cut lining by coat pat-
tern, allowing an inch
tuck down centre back.
Tack and stitch all seams
except underarm seams
and shoulder seams. Press
seams. Tack tuck down
back. Place coat on stand
inside out. Pin lining
down centre back. Now
tack seams in lining to
corresponding seams in
coat, taking care not to
get lining tight. Pin and
tuck side seams and shoul-
der seams. Fell seams.
Turn in, and tack lining
to edge of facing, round
neck, and 1 inch up from
length of coat. Fell lining

To Line the Sleeves.—
Stitch and press seams in
lining. Tack seams to
corresponding seams in
sleeves, to about 2 inches
from top of sleeve. Turn
lining out over sleeve.
Tack and fell lining round
length, about 1 inch up


from edge. Turn in and
gather round top of lining
about 2 inches from front
and back seam. Stitch the
sleeves in by hand. Shrink
away any fullness in sleeve
Prussian binding or tape
over edge of skirt; stitch
binding to petersham on
both edges (Pig. 44).,
Turn belt to inside of
skirt, and press. Sew on
top. Pin lining over
stitching, and fell round
armhole. Press every
part well as the work
] iroceeds.
FINISHING SKIRT BELT.
Fit petersham belt.
Tack skirt flat to belt
(Fig. 43). Now tack
hooks and eyes, and loops
to hang skirt up by.
CUTTING OUT ON THE
BIAS.
Most amateur dress-
makers find it difficult to
cut out on the bias. By
studying the diagrams one
(-an see that it is quite


•simple (Fig. 45). With a
36 inch material, large
pieces cut on the bias must
be joined at their widest
part. For instance, a
swing skirt or a skirt with
panels, 30 inch length, can
be cut without a join (Fig.
46), but a longer skirt,
that is, an evening skirt,
or a nightgown, in fact,
any skirt that reaches to
the floor, will need join-
ing (Fig. 47).
Another difficulty is
joining pieces of striped
material to form a V.
Joining stripes in this


way makes a very effec-
tive trimming. A front
panel joined in a Y (Fig.
48) is also very slimming.

MAKING SLEEVES.
Sleeves that are badly
fitting can spoil any frock
or coat. Very often one
hears this remark from
the home dressmaker, “ I
can never get sleeves to go
right.” Providing that
the sleeve has been cut out
by a good pattern it should
fit the armhole quite
easily. Don’t forget, if
the armhole is made
smaller by taking in the
underarm seam, the sleeve
will naturally be too big
for the armhole. Also, if
the armhole is made larger
the sleeve will be too tight
for the armhole. With a
full sleeve, these altera-
tions will make little dif


ference if any; but it is
altogether different with
a fitting or semi-fitting
sleeve.
Now, if the underarm
seam is taken in an inch,
that is, 2 inch on front
and i inch on back, the
position for the front
seam in the sleeve must
be moved up h inch. For
a fitting sleeve, ease the
sleeve into armhole about
2 inches up from front
seam, ease to about 2
inches below the shoulder
seam. For the extra full-
ness made by taking in
armhole put an inch pleat
in the sleeve under (Fig.
49) just about where the
underarm seam in the
bodice comes. Too much
fullness in any sleeve can
be taken away in this
manner.
Now for the armhole
that has been made larger,
and the sleeve that is too


tight. If there is not
enough in the seams to let
out, a piece must be joined
in from the elbow up if
(Fig. 50) it is a long
sleeve, and from the edge
of sleeve if it is a short
sleeve (Fig. 51). The
sleeve must be fitted on to
get the position for front
seam. Sometimes a seam
to seam sleeve, i.e., the
seam in the sleeve to un-
derarm seam in bodice,
does not set satisfactory;
try tacking sleeve in 1 in.
up the front from under-
arm seam.
A coat sleeve cut with a
top sleeve, and under
sleeve, should have a nar-
row turning on front seam
and snipped in near bend
of arm; this allows the
seam to lie flat. The
sleeve top near elbow
should be eased to under
sleeve (Fig. 52), and the
fullness shrunk away be-
fore stitching. Gather top
of sleeve about 2 inches
from seams with small
stitches the gathering pre-
vents pleats when sleeves
are being stitched. Shrink
aw r ay any fullness. A
shaped piece of wadding
(Fig. 53) tacked to seam
across the top of a tailored
sleeve (Fig. 54) gives it a
nice rounded appearance.
Press the seam of armhole
by holding a pad under-
neath, and a damp cloth


over seam, taking care not
to shine material by let-
ting cloth get dry.
A puff sleeve should al-
ways have a tight lining.
If the material is trans-
parent, make the lining in
fine net, matching the ma-
terial if possible. To get
the wide shoulder effect, a
shaped piece of canvas is
used, and sewn into arm-
hole. The canvas is cut
oval, 71 inches x3J inches
(Fig. 55) ; fold it double,
stitch edges together and
across two or three times
(Fig. 56)., Place this stay
inside armhole over gath-
ered or darted part of
sleeve, and catch its folded
edge to armhole turnings
(Fig. 57). The shaped
piece may be covered with
a thin silk if the edges rub
or are rough. Tight
sleeves soon wear out at
the elbows if they fit too
tightly. Always allow a
little fullness in the un-
der of sleeve at the elbow,
even if the fullness is not
allowed on the pattern:
tw r o tiny pleats can be
pinned in material before
cutting out sleeve.


A piping gives a muck
nicer finish to the edge of
a short sleeve, than just a
hem. Cut a strip of ma-
terial on the bias about 1
inch wide. Turn in and
SIEEVE TURNED/N

58). Turn in and press
both edges of bias strip.
Tack strip to edge of

COLLARS.
Thin material for col-
lars will stand up much
better to wear and tear if
the material is made up
double. Thick material
should be lined with a thin
silk. A bound collar is
much smarter than the
collar that is just stitched
round and turned out.
To Make a Bound Col-
lar. Cut collar double.
Place the two collars to-
tar. cut collar double.
fP/NG Place the two collars to-
Right s/de gether, wrong sides of ma-
terial facing. Tack round
outside edge. Tack bind-
in e - round edce on riedit
ing round edge on right
side; stitch close to edge;
trim edge. Turn and tack
of an inch below edge of binding over edge; hem
sleeve on right side (Fig. binding to stitching on
59). Catch inside edge of wrong side. Press (Fig.
strip with invisible 61). A narrow binding is


more effective than a wide
one. Bind cuffs same as
collar. If a collar is to be
trimmed with stitching,
always tack collar very
carefully if material is
double. It is better to
tack collar across instead
of lengthwise (Pig. 62).
Under collars may be
joined in centre back, but
not the top collar. A col-
Stitch round edge, and
turn out.
BELTS.
Soft and Stiff.
A soft belt, he., a gath-
ered or pleated belt should
not be made of thick ma-
terial.
A Gathered Belt, to
keep the gathers in posi-
tion, should have about 4
sections of gathering—
one at each side seam, and
one in centre back and
front of belt (Fig. 64).
Two or three rows of
lar will set better if under
collar is cut on the bias.
If collar is trimmed with
frilling, insert frilling be-
gathering are necessary in
each section. Always use
a fine needle when gather-
ing, and gather with fine
stitches. The finer the
stitches the smaller the
gathers. Hem the edges
or face the belt, and press
collar before gathering. If the
FAc/hq belt is to fasten at the side
without a buckle, gather
both ends of the belt with
two rows of gathering.
Bind the under end, i.e.,
the end that will have the
tween edges of collar and loops sewn on (Fig. 65),
collar facing (Fig. 63). and face back the top end


where the hooks are sewn
on. Sew a piece of tape
to the back of the other
gatherings (Fig. 66). This
back and front. Turn
edges of belt over edges of
interlining, and tack.
Line belt with a thin lin-
tape prevents the gathers
from breaking.
For the Pleated Belt a
foundation of lining is
necessary to keep the
pleats in position. Pit the
interlining for size and
shape, then pleat the ma-
terial to the interlining,
tacking each pleat in posi-
ing, if belt has no buckle
finish at side as described
for the gathered belt.
For a Stiff Belt it is a
good scheme to buy a pet-
ersham ribbon to match
the material if possible.
Turn in and tack material
to ribbon (Fig. 68), hav-
ing the material a shade

tion (Fig. 67). Catch and
pleat with invisible
stitches to the interlining
at both sides and centre
wider than the ribbon.
Stitch material to ribbon
at each edge. If the belt
is to be filled in with


stitching, it must be
tacked firmly with rows
of small tacking.
To Prevent a Wide Belt
from Wrinkling, sew a
piece of tape to the inside
of belt to form a casing,
then cut a piece of whale-
bone the width of belt, and
insert it in the casing
also give the effect of
slimness.
Marking Pleats. Pin
the pattern to material
folded double. Mark with
chalk where the pleats are
indicated on the pattern.
Cut out round pattern.
Remove pattern. If pleats
are only marked at each
(Fig. 69) ; sew up the end
of casing.
PLEATS.
Pleats are always in
vogue in some way or an-
other. They are very use-
ful for adding fullness
without being bulky. They
end of pattern, draw a line
with chalk from top of
pleat to bottom. Draw a
line for each pleat (Fig.
70). Now thread mark
along the line to the un-
derneath piece of ma-
terial. Mark each pleat
in this manner. Cut the


thread marks, and take actly the same. It is quite
material apart (Fig. 71). simple to tack up pleats
Both pieces have pleats when marked in this way
marked correctly and ex- (Fig. 72).


When Pressing Pleats
in Skirts, do not press the
length until finished, i.e.,
until the hem has been
finished. If material is
thick, and pleats are
stitched down half way,
the pleats may be cut away
at the back of stitching
and oversewn (Fig. 73).
Inverted Pleats should
have at least 6 ins. in each
pleat.
A box pleat should have
enough material for pleats
to meet at the back (Fig.
74). A 3-inch box pleat
should have 3 inches in
each pleat, ie., 3 inches in
each side of box pleat. A
knife pleat, or flat pleat,
should have twice as much
in the pleat; for instance,
if the pleat is 2 inches
wide, it should have 4
inches in the pleat; 3 inch
pleat should have 6 inches
in the pleat, and so on.
Anything smaller than a
1 inch pleat is much more
successful if pleated by
machine.
SHIRRING.
Thick material should
not be shirred. Shirring
is an ideal trimming for
thin materials. To be suc-
cessful, shirring must be
done with fine stitches,
and the rows of shirring
kept close together and
quite even. A J inch be-
tween the rows of shirring


is ample. Very fine ma-
terials, such as georgette,
sheers or chiffon, may be
shirred with J inch be-
tween rows. As each row
side with one or two but-
ton-hole stitches (Pig. 76).
This prevents the gather-
ing thread from coming
loose. If there is any
strain on the shirring, it is
a good plan to face it at
the back (Pig. 77).

ering thread loose until all

right side (Fig. 80). If
there is much piping to be

professional. After tack-

A Final Chapter
Renovations and Alterations.
Sometimes a little al-
teration or renovation
makes all the difference to
a frock. For instance, if
a frock is tight across the
bust, it can be altered with
very little trouble by
opening the underarm
seam from armhole to
waist, and joining a piece
of material to the bodice
front. Tack a strip of
material to side seam of
bodice front. Stitch, and
press. Now cut the strip
of material; allow 1 inch
at the armhole, and gradu-
ate to nothing at waist.
Always remember, just as
muph as is joined to the
bodice must be joined, or
let in the sleeve if the
sleeve is plain. If the
sleeve is gathered there is
no need to join on any ma-
terial, as the gathers can
be let out.
If you have uo material
the same as the frock, un-
pick the belt and use it,
and get a suede or peter-
sham ribbon belt.
To Lengthen a Frock.—
If the frock has a hem.
unpick the hem and join a
strip of material cut on
the bias, about 5 inches
wide, to the edge of hem.
Tack up the hem with the
seam at the edge of hem.
Another way to lengthen
a frock is to let in one or
two bands of different
material. To do this,
measure up from length
about 9 inches all round
skirt, and mark with a
tacking. Cut along this
tacking. Now cut a band
from the new material the
width you want to length-
en frock. Tack the band
to skirt, shaping it at the
seams. Now tack the 9
ins. cut off from skirt to
the other edge of band.
Stitch the band to skirt.
A belt, collar and cuffs
made of the same material
as skirt band makes all the
difference to the frock.
TigM Armholes. Un-
pick sleeves from arm-
holes. Fit armholes. To
let out sleeves to fit arm-


holes, let in a strip of ma-
terial in underarm of
sleeve.
To Straighten Length
of Skirt.—Jiang up frock
on a dress-hanger, and
measure from waist to
length; mark round with
pins the same distance all
round length of the skirt.
Renovate a last year’s
frock with a new belt, but-
tons, collar and cuffs.
Pleats in skirt can be
pressed out and the skirt
gathered to bodice. A
yoke and short sleeves of
contrast material makes
an old frock look like new.
A new panel let in from
neck to hem, with belt,
collar and cuffs to match
will transform last year’s
frock. These alterations
and renovations are quite
simple to do, and are well
worth the time taken to do
them. The instructions
and diagrams in this book
have been made as simple
as possible to help the
home-dressmaker.
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING
SUMMER HAT.
CUT three circles of material, one plaid, one canvas
and one plain material for lining. Stitch together
with canvas in centre.
Snip edges of inner circle and attach headband, which
is a length of double material to fit head.
Stitch crown pieces, cut on bias, to each side of hat
and tie on tape.

A DRESSING-TABLE SKIRT WITH CORDED SHIRRINGS
'"pHE top of the skirt of the chintz-draped table shown here has a
*■ hundred per cent, fullness—that is, the material before gath-
ering measures twice the distance round the table. The ruffle at
the bottom was then cut so that it was twice as long before gather-
ing as the measurement around the skirt. The gathers of both skirt
and ruffle are arranged so that the sides and front of the skirt are
a little fuller than the back.
This dressing-table has a curved front and hinged arms on
which to mount the skirt, so that it can be opened to permit access
to the drawer. Arms of this sort may be added to an ordinary
table if desired, though it generally requires a little figuring to make
them fit properly.
To mount the skirt, it must first be sewn to a band of covered
buckram. Cut the buckram in a strip 2J inches wide and long
enough to fit around the table. The strip may be pierced with
lapped joinings sewn flat whenever necessary. Cover it with a
straight piece of material as shown here at A.
Make the heading at the top of the skirt just the depth of the
thickness of the table edge so that it will cover the edge of the
table, when the arms are closed. Use i-inch cable cord ror the
ts sewn to a safety-pin and run through the tucks
stitched in the material as shown here at B. The material is pushed
back on the cords to make the fullness.
. t°P the ruffle is also shirred with cords in this way and
is then sewn to the skirt by hand or by using the special ifoot of the
rnac bi n € that allows stitching to come up close to cording.
When the shirrings are all finished, sew the top of the skirt to the
covered buckram strip as shown at C, and then thumb-tack it in
place, ae at D.
