HENRY LAWSON. (M ay Moore,
1867-1922 Copyright photo.)
“Australia ! My country ! Her very name is music to me.
God bless Australia! for the sake of the great hearts of the heart
of her! God keep her clear of the old world shams and callous
commercialism ! And Heaven send that if in my time her sons are
called upon to fight for her, I may die in the front rank, and be
buried in Australian ground.”
—Henry Lawson
