Hughes And His Views
Compiled for the benefit of Mr. Hughes by his best friend FRANK ANSTEY
The Great Recantation
(Oration No. '» by Mr. Hughes)
My party is the “Win-the-War” party,
and “all that is necessary to achieve a
victory’’ party.
X said the same thing of the Labor
party—when I led it.
I said "at the 1914 elections:—
“If returned with a majority, the
Labqr party will pursue with the ut-
most vigor and determination EVERY
COURSE NECESSARY for the defence
of the Commonwealth and the Empire
in any and every contingency.
I now say, “It will not.”
In 1914 I denounced the party I am now
leading, as I now denounce the party I
then led.
In November, 1915, speaking for the
Labor party, I said (Referenda pamphlet,
page 11): —
“Since deeds alone count in this
great crisis, let what we, the Labor
party, have done towards enabling
Australia to defend herself by sea and
land, before the war and since, speak
for us.”
I told the people the Labor party had
■done, and was doing, everything neces-
sary. I opposed conscription on the
-ground that it was not necessary. I said
I would never support it for oversea pur-
poses—NEVEß, NEVER, NEVER!
Gentlemen, I went to L’n gland. I
ii, c,-f v c T .-eji:- :vs: 1 v, me -pack to
Australia. The majority of my colleagues
refused to endorse my change of front —
therefore I denounced them. They re-
fused to desert the policy I had sustained
as “every course necessary’ - —therefore, I
assailed them as traitors. I put the ques-
tion to the country—l was defeated. I am
now no longer connected with the Labor
party. I am now the leader of. that party
previously led by George Reid and Joe
•Cook. In that capacity I withdraw every
thing I ever said In defence of the loyalty
.and patriotism of the La£or party. Every-
thing I ever said in their favor was a*
flle. I now recant. I now say (Bendigo,
March 27, 1917):
“The Labor party is made up of men
who forget that their first duty is to
Australia, who put other interests be-
fore those of their country. They ap-
peal to all that is narrow, mean and
■selfish. They come to destroy, not to
build up. They preach a gospel of dis-
cord between all classes.”
(MY CONSCIENCE.
Men and women of Australia, I was the
leader of that party. I led the “de-
stroyers.” I preached the gospel of dis-
cord. I was not ashamed of it until they
brutally expelled me. Had they not ex-
pelled me I should still be marching at
the head of the band singing its praises.
Now I pose before God as a man who
refused to walk abroad with a, "sand-
bagged conscience.” Men and women of
Australia, look on me for a sample of
an honest and upright man—and follow
me.
You ask me if I put country before
party, and principles before perquisites,
why I did not leave that odious junta-
ridden party of my own choice? You
asked me why I waited to be pushed?
Such questions are an impertinence to
the pions—I refuse to answer them.
I always believed in the junta—so long
as it worked my way. I always upheld
it —so long as it was an instrument to
crush those who dared to disagree. I
used it to bring Holman to heel on the
Referenda questions. I told him to his
face that what Conference had decided
’he must accept or perish. I now say that
the Labor politicians are the pawns and
mouthpieces and marionettes of outside
organisations. For years I denied it. In
my book, "The Case for Labor,” I said
(that whosoever said so lied. I now say
that the Liberals were right in their
affirmations, and that I was the lia-p when
I contradicted them.
THAT LEADERSHIP.
When I came back from the conscrip-
tion fight in October, I returned to the
Caucus. I wanted to remain the leader
of those pawns and mouthpieces and
marionettes, but they would not let me.
I wished to remain the leader of those
whom 1 had denounced during the cam-
paign as disloyalists, firebrands and
instruments of Germany. They had praised
me, but because of the language 1 had
used towards them, they refused to
praise me any more. I desired their con-
tinued patronage—they refused to bestow
it. Every party, Liberal or Labor, State
or Federal, claims and exercises the right
to change its leader. I refused to permit
them to exercise that right on me. Had
they retained me in the leadership I
should still have been with them, the
pawn, the marionette, the Jumping-jack f
of the junta.
Left with only a few followers,, I en-
deavored to form a Government composed
lof every faction. To me it was a matter
of indifference of whom it consisted, pro-
vided I was the leader. I was prepared
to offer positions in the Government to
men whom I had denounced as enemies
of their country—they refused the bait.
I formed an alliance with men whom I
had denounced not less venomously than
I now denounce the men I once led. The
men with whom 1 now associate I not
long ago denounced as:—
“Men who cover their real objectives
under the mantle of patriotism. The
only patriotism they understand Is
that which fills their pockets and
empties those of the people.” —-(Re-
ferendum pamphlet, page 21.)
Of all such patriots X am now the ac-
knowledged leader. The trumpets of
Privilege and Vested Interests blare my
praises.
The Last Refuge
I have every confidence in the good sense of the electors.
But I had no confidence in the good sense of the 40,000 electors of West
Sydney.
For 23 years they had returned me by overwhelming majorities.
For 23 years I had trusted my political life with confidence to their decision.
8,,t ! became afraid to trust them any more.
I fled from West Sydney.
I fled from the State where I was best known.
In all its wide domains, there was no Labor seat I dare contest —there was no
Liberal seat to furnish me a refuge.
I turned my eyes to South Australia. I sent William Watt over to spy out
the land. I wired to him a secret and confidential message through Crawford
Vaughan. I asked Vaughan to de-code and give to Watt. I said —
“Comporers, idyllical originac orbibus bawdiment mahompa ancilibus
boothby sluggent.”
It urged Watt to “stand immovable on the compact already made” between the
managers (the juntas) representing the various factions that comprised the
Fusion. It begged him to make the necessary arrangements Boothby myself.
But the scheme fell to pieces.
My hopes in South Australia turned to ashes.
AND NOW, MEN AND WOMEN OF BENDIGO, I TURN TO YOU.
HOW I FIXED PRICES
(Oration No. 2 by Mr. Hughes)
j said at Bendigo (Mar. 27, 1917):
“The Government will regulate
prices in any industry where such
action is necessary to protect the pro-
ducer from loss and the consumer from
exploitation.”
I have always strenuously denied that
the Government had any power to regu-
late prices, and I have always denied the
Government had power to protect the con-
sumer from exploitation.
I have said;
“Those who say to the contrary are
endeavoring to fool the electors.” (Re-
ferenda Pamphlet, 1915.)
I now admit they were right.
I have said:
“The Government cannot prevent the
exploitation of the people by regulating
prices. It cannot prevent the piling up
of huge fortunes. It cannot limit pro-
fits during the war. It cannot control
a monopoly even if it is bleeding the
nation white.” (Page 26).
I now deny everything i then said.
I have said:
“The Federal Parliament of Aus-
tralia, in the greatest crisis of the
modem world, is powerless to prevent
the exploitation of the people.” (Page
iB).
I now repudiate that statement. I now
admit *t has ample power.

oatlc activities, 1 can easily explain. As
legal adviser to the Labor party and its
Government, I had for 18 months succes-
sively cajoled the party into the belief
that the Government had no power. I
said 1 was buttressed in my opinion by
the advice of the Crown Law authorities
and others. I denounced as foois those
in the Labor party who said we had the
power.
Under the Judicature Act, I could have
had the opinion of the. High Court upon
the question.
I refused to ask it. I persuaded the
Labor party it was useless to ask. We
had no power. I knew it— at least I said
it.
Then I went to England. Then my
colleagues in the Government, freed from
my control and influence, sought, behind
my back, the advice of the Crown Law
authorities. They were assured we had
power. They proceeded to use it. They
commenced to fix prices. The exploiters
took the case to the High Court. The
Court upheld the Government. Its deci-
sion was my condemnation.
I returned from England to find in
operation the powers I said did not exist.
I returned to find in practice the fixing
of prices, which, I said, under the exist-
ing constitution was not possible. I ac-
cepted what I could not longer delay or
prevent. I now claim credit for that
which was done in my absence, IN OP-
POSITION TO ALL MY PREVIOUS
ADVICE.
Had it rested with me, there would be
no fixing of prices to-day. I would still
adhere to the opinions I expressed right
up to my departure for England. I
would still be saying:
“The Government cannot prevent the
exploitation of the people by regulating
prices.”
I would still be denouncing as charla-
tans or fools all those who said we had
power.
But now it is done, and proved to be
legal, I deny I ever said “we have no
power.”
THE WAR CENSUS.
I took a War Census on Men and a
War Census on Wealth.
I promised the Labor party I would not
use the one without the other.
One I used, and the other I put into the
dust-bin.


How I Got My Majority
and Lost It
Being the funny story of the sad sickness of
Keith Ready, the kindness of His Excellency the
Governor-General, and unexpected desertion by
the Liberal Senators, Bakhap and Keating.
I (William Morris Hughes) said on
August 6, 1914 :
“ The Enemies of Democracy are all
in the Fusion Camp. The Fusion stands
' for Privilege and Wealth. It fights
their battles and gets in return their
influence and their money.”
lam now in the Fusion camp. What
I get in return I alone know.
“Those who speak as the junta
directs, charge me with having bribed
others to serve my own purposes.”—
(Bendigo, March 27).
I deny it. I never bribed anybody to
serve my own purpose. Whatever I did
was done in the interests of my country.
It is true that I endeavored, by moral
suasion, to induce a Senator to pursue
the path of righteousness, but my
anxiety for his salvation was dictated by
the highest altruistic motives. If I failed
it was not my fault. I told him his re-
ward would be a purified conscience, not
a bulging bank account.
After my first failure I was seized of
a new idea. I at once wired to Premier
Lee, of Tasmania, to come at once to
Melbourne, but he demurred, and de-
sired to know for what public purpose I
desired his presence.
I could not tell him, but assured him,
saying:
“Very important that I see you on
Monday, leaving for Sydney to-mor-
morrow. Please catch ‘Moeraki,’ leav-
ing Hobart to-morow at 10 a.m. for
Sydney. See me Sydney, Monday.
Very important you should come.”
That fetched Mr. Lee. He came.
I told Premier Lee that one of the Tas-
manian Senators was about to resign, and
that I wanted the Tasmanian Govern-
ment to send John Earle in his place.
He asked me which Senator. I satisfied
his anxieties. He agreed to assist. A
wire was sent to John Earle to come to
Melbourne for the thing, and a wire
asking the Tasmanian Cabinet to be in
waiting for Premier Lee’s return.
On Wednesday (February 38) we got
back to Melbourne. Lee left for Hobart.
Ready and Earle arrived from Launces-
ton. I took John Earle to dinner. Sena-
tor Ready went into the Parliamentary
diningroom—and fainted.
HIS EXCELLENCY.
Next day, March 1, I interviewed the
Governor-General. I made my sugges-
tions. Although the course I proposed
was without precedent. His Excellency
readily agreed.
Thereupon clear the line for Hobart,
urgent. I forwarded a code wire to Pre-
mier Lee. Translated into plain English
it said:
“All arrangements this end com-
plete. Ready has handed his resigna-
tion to President of Senate. Presi-
dent will not announce until after
dinner.”
The President said he did not receive
the resignation until 6 p.m. My coded
wire was sent prior to that time. The
President will explain the discrepancy.
My code said:
“Governor-General will notify Gover-
nor of Tasmania.”
His Excellency was pleased to release
President Givens of any worry or trouble
in the matter.
The code went on—
“ Earle’s resignation as a State mem-
ber for Tasmania has been written out
in the ptesence of the Governor-Gene-
ral, and the Governor-General has at-
tested Mr. Earle’s signature.
His Excellency is very obliging. He
condescends to become a Commissioner
of Affidavits, a witness of signatures for
State members of Parliament anxious to
hurriedly retire.
The code proceeded:
“Governor-General will notify Tas-
manian Governor of this fact (i.e.,
Earle’s resignation as State member.)”
The courtesy of His Excellency is
without limit. Earle does not need to
forward his resignation to the Speaker of
the State House. He merely tells His
Excellency, and His Excellency does the
rest.
The code goes on—
“Governor-General now awaits
Governor of Tasmania’s notification of
Earle’s appointment as new Senator.”
The Governor-General was waiting for
notification of Earle’s appointment as new
Senator before the President of the
■Senate had received the resignation—at
least, before he said he had.
The code concluded:
“Imperative that notification should
reach Governor-Genera! to-night, not
later than 9 p.m.”
THE SECOND ACT.
But there was no assurance that the
Tasmanian Cabinet would appoint Earle.
It would be folly to throw away the sub-
stance of a State membership for a posi-
tion not secured. So Earle wrote out a
wire to Lee saying he was willing to ac-
cept nomination as new Senator. This
wire was certified and forwarded by
Major George Steward, official secretary
to the Governor-General.
CROSS WIRES.
Staying at Scott’s Hotel was a Tas-
manian gentleman named Gibson, a
sheepbreeder, largely identified with Tas-
manian milling interests. Lee wired to
Gibson asking to be informed of decision
of Cabinet. Gibson replied that there
was no settlement. Lee wired me (the
Prime Minister) on the subject. I (the
Prime Minister) saw Gibson. I came to
a satisfactory arrangement with him. I
sent a coded wire to Lee saying, ‘Gibson
satisfied.” Although Parliament was sit-
ting and my colleagues within call, I
told Lee it was
“Impossible to get Cabinet together.
Matter must rest upon my assurance.”
Gibson being satisfied, the Tasmanian
Cabinet was satisfied. John Earle be-
came an agreeable candidate. The fact
was notified.
Thereupon all lines between Melbourne
and Hobart were cleared for action, and
the following wires went through:
CLEAR THE LINE—URGENT.
The first was from the Governor-Gene-
ral to the Governor of Tasmania, saying;
“Mr. John Earle has this day written
out and signed in my presence hi* re-
signation as member for House e. As-
sembly of Tasmania.”
The second was through Major George
Steward (official secretary to the Gover-
nor-General) to Tasmanian Governor,
saying;
“May it please your Excellency, I
hereby tender my resignation as mem-
ber of the House of Assembly for Tas-
mania.—T. Earle (through Steward.)”
The third was from the Governor-Gene-
ral to Tasmanian Governor, saying;
“President of Senate has notified me
that Rudolph Keith Ready has resigned
his position as representative of Tas-
mania in the Senate.”
All this business was done before any
notification was made in the Senate that
a Senator had resigned.
Much of it was done before the hour
the President of the Senate stated he re-
ceived the resignation.
John Earle forwarded to Tasmania his
preparedness to accept nomination as
Senator hours before he forwarded his re-
signation as State member.
By these excellent methods I secured
a majority in the Senate, and at once the
resolution for the prolongation of Parlia-
ment was submitted.
That’s how I got my majority.
Then came the Watson episode. Con-
scious of my innocence, the purity of my
purpose, and the strength of my cause, I
ignored the accusation. I treated it with
the contempt it deserved. I refused to
be turned from my trip by creatures of
the junta who screeched of bribery and
corruption.
LAST ACT OF THE DRAMA.
Unhappily the daily press of .Tasmania
denounced the Earle-Ready transforma-
tion in the most opprobrious terms.
The Hobart “Mercury” said (March 3):
“The conjuring trick by which R.
K. Ready, sitting erect in view of the
whole of the people of Australia, was
made to disappear and give place to
John Earle, was performed with a neat-
ness which must evoke admiration of
that talented conjurer, Mr. Hughes.”
The “Mercury” went on:
“WE REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT
THE NATIONAL CRISIS DEMANDS
THE USE OF TRICKERY AND IN-
TRIGUE OF THIS KIND.”
Then the Liberal Senators—Bakhap
and Keating—refused to give their ’>otes
for the prolongation.
THAT’S HOW I LOST MY
MAJORITY.
My Metal Monopoly
(Oration No. 3 by Mr. Hughes)
I told Parliament and the country
that —
“German influence is dominant
throughout the many industries of'Aus-
tralia.”
Mr. Watt said; “You cannot seriously
make that statement.”
I said: “Yes.”
Mr. Watt said: “You cannot truthfully
make the statement.”
I said: “Let me, say what I have to
say."
Mr. Watt said: “It is a gross exaggera-
tion.”
If Mr. Watt was not now a member of
my Government, I would accuse him of
being a pro-German.
Before the war the Metal Gang had one
end of their business in Germany and
the other in Australia. They controlled
Mount Morgan, Mount Lyell and Broken
Hill. They controlled Amalgamated Zinc,
Electrolytic Smelters and Cloncurry Tin.
They held controlling influences in all the
great banks.
Til©- inline., o£ iUo mast prominent were
R. G. Casey, Kelso King, Frank Snow,
and the German Jews, Aaron, Hirsch and
Co.; W. L. Baillieu; Beer. Sondheimer
and Co.; Bowes Kelly; Herr Baer;
Elder’s Metal, and M. C. Muecke.
When the war broke out this gang
broke into two. One part sang “The
Watch on the Rhine,” and the other
“Rule Britannia.”
The part that sang “Rule Britannia.”
was under contract to deliver metals to
the part that sang “Watch on the
Rhine ” I barred the passage of those
metals. I annulled the contracts. In
that I not only rendered a national ser-
vice—l performed my duty.
WATCH ON THE RHINE.
“The Watch on the Rhine” crowd had
not only a majority of shares (Herr Baer.
July 30, 1915), but predominant monetary
interests in the metal producing firms of
Australia.
I (the Prime Minister) did not say that
the Australian Government would take
control on these directorates to the ex-
tent of the German interests therein, but
I left absolute control to that section of
the gang that sang “Rule Britannia.” I
left them to guard, not only their own
financial interests, but to guard and con-
trol that share of the business owned by
their German pals.
I destroyed direct German control in
the metal industry, but left the control
of the industry in the hands of the men
who had been the associates of the Ger-
mans.
When I went to England the metal
magnates worked up a splendid send-off
for me. Bowes Kelly, of B.H. Proprietary,
Mount Lyell, Hercules Tin, Tasmanian
Copper, and president of the Colonial
Bank, took the chair.
He said I was “a really great man.”
BAILLIEU FELL ON MY NECK.
Mr. W. L. Baillieu, of Dunlops and
Amalgamated Zinc, of Electrolytic Smel-
ters, the Brewery Combine, the London
Bank, Broken Hill Proprietary, Clon-
curry Tin. etc., etc., said: —
“I cannot find words to express the
gratification I felt when the new Prime
Minister stepped into office.”
I was so delighted that I afterwards
lifted up my voice (January 14, 1916), and
said;
“It is wrong t» say the capitalists
own Australia. Men must not delude
themselves with lies, with statements
Which they know to be lies.”
I said that, although only, a few weeks
before I had written these words: —
"Seventy-five per cent, of all the capi-
tal in this country is in the hands of
companies. They employ 75 per cent,
of all labor, and fix the prices of what
the community lives on. These com-
panies form themselves into Trusts and
Combines, and work together for
mutual benefit and the people’s detrl
ment.”
With the praises of Balllieu, Bowes*
Kelly and other sterling democrats ring-
ing in my ears. I went to America.
In New York I had a long conversation,
with Merry, head of the Steel Trust, and 1
Davidson, head of the Pierpont Morgan
interests (8/3/16).
I have newer told Australia the result
of those conversations.
In Australia a howl was going up over
the monopoly privileges given to Bail-
lieu, Kelly and Co. The Government was
charged with having created a gigantic
monopoly in the interests of the gentle-
linen mentioned.
In answer to these charges, the (Jovern-
ment, in my absence, denied that it had)
anything to do with the Metal Trust. It
stated officially:
“METAL COMPACT.
"This scheme has been initiated, nur-
tured and completed by men who have
little or no sympathy with the political
opinions, of the present Federal Govern-
ment.” —“Herald" (April 6. 1916).
On August 10, 1916, the “Bulletin”
said: —
“Mr. Hughes’ scheme for settling the
metal problem has proved a fraud, and:
a particularly bad fraud, from the-
Labor point of view. It is oppressing
the small man. Mr. Hughes, as he
was warned, has created a very
dangerous Trust. Mr. Hughes has-
created three combines—lead. zinc and
copper—and these are intermarried.”
I brought back with me a gift of half-a-
million from the British Government for
the zinky section of the combine.
A few days later (August 23). the
Metal Magnates gave me a splendid wel-
come home. C. E. D. Rogers said, “No
man was more worthy of their homage.”
(Loud cheers.) Balllieu and all the host
was there.
Now, the “Mining Review” for March,.
iqi7, has put into circulation against me
a pamphlet, entitled “The Metal Indus-
try.” ,
It affirms that I have created a gigantic
monopoly in the interests of an exclusive
few.
I say I did not. I charge the “Bul-
letin,” “The Mining Review,’ and all
who say to the contrary, with being Pro-
Germans.”
I tell the people that I have cut the last
tentacle of German influence from the
Australian metal industry,
1 DO NOT TELL THEM that the
former proprietorship in those industries
still remain.
I do not tell them that if a million pro-
fit be made, one-half goes to the Baillieu-
Keily end, and THE OTHER HALF IN
TRUST FOR THE GERMAN END OF
THE STICK, TO BE DIVIDED AFTER
THE WAR.
WHY SHOULD I?
HAVE I NOT SAID THAT “THE
FUSION STANDS FOR PRIVILEGE
AND WEALTH, AND GETS IN RE-
TURN THEIR INFLUENCE AND*
THEIR MONEY.”
I KNOW IT.


The Pocket Patriots
(Oration No. 4 by Mr. Hughes)
Do you remember how I said in 1915:
“The Government cannot wage this
war effectively unless it has enlarged
powers by an amendment of the Con-
stitution.”
I NOW SAY IT CAN.
Do you remember how I promised the
Referenda. Well, I don’t promise it any
more.
Do you remember how Mr. Fisher said:
“Only an earthquake would prevent
the Referenda.”
I now say, only an earthquake will get
it.
Do you remember how I promised a
Referenda on December 11, 1915?
Do you remember how I dropped it?
Do you know I whispered into the
ears of the Caucus and the juntas
stories of a new terror, imposing strange
demands upon our country ? I said
it necessitated the postponement of the
Referenda and the tariff and my immedi-
ate departure to London to ward off the
danger from this new and unexpected
quarter ?
I now say there is no danger from that
quarter.
Do you remember how, before I went, I
published a pamphlet, for circulation in
the constituencies ? ,
Do you remember how I said:
“We are at war, but the capitalist in-
sists upon his profits, the money lender
upon his interest, the landlord upon
his rent. Interest has risen; the cost
of living has risen?”
I now deny it.
I said:
“Always the people pay. Those who
are exploiting them, who live luxuri-
ously, who diaw fat dividends, say: ‘Do
nothing to help yourselves while the
war lasts.’ ”
I now say: “Do nothing while the war
lasts.”
THE FUSION.
I said of the political representatives of
the exploiters:
“They are men who cover their real
objectives under the mantle of
patriotism. The only patriotism tkev
understand is that which fills their
pockets and empties those of the
people.”
1 now say;
“These are the only patriots. They
sit behind me. Upon their votes I de-
pend for the Prime Ministership.”
I said:
“The cost of living has increased, so
that it is with the utmost difficulty the
bulk of the community are able to
make ends meet.”
“This is due to manipulation of the
market by unscrupulous persons at the
expense of the community. They pose
as patriots. They subscribe ,£5O to
patriotic funds 1 and fleece the public
of “,£5,000” by high prices.”
I now say: “They do not.”
I said of them:
“They conceal their profits by hiding
them away in reserve accounts, and by
other ingenious devices.”
“Under cover. of war, they are dip-
ping their hands deep into the pockets
of the people. They are making huge
profits at the expense of the com-
munity.”
I say it no longer.
THE TRUSTS.
I said:
“Trusts and combines control the
necessaries of life, and charge the
people what they please, and daily their
power grows greater. Never has their
power been felt more acutely than dur-
ing the present war.”
“If the Trusts can defeat this pro-
posal by the cry: ‘No party questions
during the war,’ the rule of the Trusts
will be prolonged.”
I now say, with the Trusts, “No party
questions during the war.”
I said:
“Many are making huge fortunes out
of this war,”
I say it no more.”
I said:
“For vested interests opportunity for
plunder is the only patriotism.”
I say it no more.
I said:
“When vested interests are menaced,
the Liberal party cries aloud that
“party strife is unpatriotic.”
I say it no more. lam the head serang
of Liberalism, and Vested Interests are
my backers.
I said:
“The erv: ‘NO PARTY QUESTIONS
DURING THE WAR,’ IS THE CRY
OF THE MONOPOLIST AND OF
HIS MOUTHPIECES.”
To-day I am the: —
MOUTHPIECE OF MONOPOLY.
To-day it is my cryj I cry the cry of
the monopolist.
To-day I recant everything. I de-
nounce those I once praised; I praise
those I once denounced.
To-day Trusts, Combines and Monopo-
lies, the Profiteers, Exploiters and the
great vested interests of capital generally
are massed beneath the banner of the
National Federation.
Beneath it is rallied the Women's
National League, the Employers’ Federa-
tion, the Stock Exchange and the Pas-
toralists’ Union.
I AM THE APPPOINTED SPOKES-
MAN OF THEM ALL.
It is to such a combination that pro-
gress and democracy can safely trust its
destiny, and be sure of death.
Economic Preparedness
Speaking in London (March 16, 1916),
before the Imperial Chamber of Com-
merce, I said:
“Let us devise a policy that will
cover every phase of our national
economic and social life.”
Now I say, “DO NOT.”
I said:
“To postpone consideration of broad
principles until after the war will make
the possibilities of a change most re-
mote.”
Now I say: Postpone until after the war.
My New Party
(Oration No. 5 by Mr. Hughes)
1 saiu at Putt Adelaide (March 30):
“I stand with the Liberals."
These are the men I previously de-
nounced as
“the mouthpieces of monopoly.”
I withdraw' everything I ever said about
them.
SIR JOHN FORREST.
I said of Sir John Forrest that he
was a Troglodyte, a thing of the dark
ages, a Tory, a reactionary, a man
whose one dream was the extermination
of Labor.
I now say that what I said about Sir
John Forrest was not true.
SIR WILLIAM IRVINE.
It was the “Age” that said of Sir Wil-
liam Irvine-
“He stands for everything which the
capitalist holds dear and the worker
detests. This is the type of politician
with which there is to be formed a per-
manent and effective junction. The re-
pulsiveness of such a junction stands
out in all its native ugliness. It ought
to make any good Liberal scout it as
he would the introduction of the
plague.”
I endorsed those statements. I have
told the working people of this country
that Sir William Irvine would sweep away
every vestige of Labor legislation.
I will never say it again, NEVER.
I will now ask you to believe that in his
hands the interests of democracy are
quite safe. Either I have changed or Sir
William has changed. I cannot say it is
Sir William, because he would be quick
to affirm his inflexible adherence to his
old-time- principles.
JOE COOK.
I said of Mr. Joseph Cook (Aug. 1914);
“He is the epitome of the Fusion.
What they are collectively, he is him-
self.”
i now say that what Mr. Cook was ami
is, I am.
I said of Mr. Cook:
“Beginning as the secretary of a
union, and leader of the Labor party,
he has become the leader of those who
seek to destroy unionism and the Labor
party.”
I am now that leader.
I said:
“To judge Mr. Cook, look at the
company he keeps.”
I now say, “DON’T.”
I said:
“Prompting the Fusion there stands
behind every wing on the stage a
great vested interest.”-
I now ask the democracy to support
that Fusion and those vested interests.
I said (Hobart “Daily Post,” August
6, 1914):
“The Fusion’s real feelings towards
democracy are those of the wolf to the
lamb. THE FUSION WOULD
SQUEEZE THE PEOPLE BLOOD-
LESS.”
I now deny it.
I now say the Fusion is harmless.
I said (August 4, 1914);
“The members of the Fusion have
nothing in common save a common
hatred of the Labor party.”
i now deny it. I now say they are
banded together by a common love of
country, and not by their predatory
Instincts.
I said (August, 1914);
“Fusion would do
away with Old-Age
Pensions, the Com-
monwealth Bank and
the Land Tax. It
would do away with
legal preference. It
would attack Union-
ism. It would oppose
outright the world-
wide tendency to-
wards humane Legis-
lation.
I now deny every-
thing 1 then said.
I now say (Bendigo, March 27): "It is
a sham charge.”
I now assert that the Fusion will not
do any of these things I said it would do.
I now say that everything I said about
the Fusion in 1914 were deliberate un-
truths.
I now tell the working democracy that
they can safely trust their interests to
the Fusion, and have every confidence in
the vested interests I said would squeeze
them bloodless.
I now publicly deny everything I ever
said, and affirm everything I ever denied.
(Hear, hear and cheers).
THE WHEA’, POOL.
The wheat pool is a scheme In which
the producers have no voice. I, William
Hughes, claim credit for it, but that silly
rabbit, Hagelthorn, went to Horsham and
said—
“ The wheat scheme was the creation
of two members of the Victorian Cabi-
net” —himself and Baillieu.
In view of the forthcoming elections I
am authorised to say that farmers’ repre-
sentatives on the Wheat Board will sow
be permitted.
“ The Faces at the Window
Sir John Forrest: He said I was “a Troglodyte, a Tory whose one dream was
the extermination of Labor.”
Joseph Cook; He said worse about me. He said I was “leader of the Labor
party, and deserted it to become the leader of those who sought to destroy Labor.”
Sir John; He now wishes to join us—to help us in our noble task.
Joseph; What! Us! Why he said we had “nothing in common save a
common hatred of Labor.”
Sir John; That’s nothing. He’ll recant or deny it, or explain it away.
Joseph: He said our policy was a “spineless, anaemic policy.”
Sir John; Never mind ! He will say the same of the Labor policy.
Joseph: He said “the Fusion would squeeze the people bloodless.”
Sir John: Never mind; he will deny it—let him in.
A little passing pomp.
Will make him minister to tyranny.

CONSCRIPTION
(Oration No. 6j by Mr. Hughes)
The Government will not enforce or
attempt to enforce conscription either by
regulation or by law. —Bendigo. May 27.
It is true I told you last October that
without conscription men would perish
in the trenches for want of reinforce-
ments.
I say so no longer.
It is true I told you last October that
without conscription men would die, not
from the bullets of the enemy—but from
want of proper relief and rest.
I ask you to forget I ever said it.
It is true I told you last October that
the voluntary system had failed —I now
tell you that, so far as we can see, it is
ample for all requirements.
It is true I told you last October that
“National safety” made conscription im-
perative and unavoidable. I NOW SAY
that National safety DOES NOT AT
PRESENT demand it.
WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE DONE.
Perhaps you marvel upon what plea
of public decency we now deny
everything we previously asserted.
We should be unworthy of our-
selves If we could not provide for our
apostacy an apology and an explanation.
It you think we must have been liars,
either in October last or now, that we
deceived you then or deceive you now,
you are quite mistaken. We say, “We
were in error as to the facts —things were
not as we thought they were or imagined
they would be.’
You will remember, ladies and gentle-
men, that last October I told you the dis-
position of our forces. Apart from the
dead on the hillsides of Gallipoli, apart
from the thousands returned sick or
wounded, we had an army of a quarter
of a million men,
.Sixty-seven thousand were scattered in
Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, and New
Guinea, leaving available for service in
Europe 183„000 men.
These 183.000 were as follows: —
Four Divisions in France 80,000
Reinforcements in England 63,000
Reinforcements on the water
or in Australian camps .. 40,000
103,000
183,000
I told you that such was the awful rate
of slaughter that these reinforcements
would only last until the end of January,
1917—that conscription was imperative,
that 32,000 were needed for the first
month, and 16,500 per month thereafter,
214,500 for 12 months—an average per
month of 17.800. I said these were the
absolute minimum for adequate rest and
reinforcement. I said that without these
numbers the fighters would perish for
want of the necessary relief.
I NOW ADMIT THAT EVERYTHING
I THEN SAID WAS INACCURATE.
I now (Bendigo, March 27) admit that
from October to now —a period of six
months —the casualties have been “NOT
MORE THAN ONE-FIFTH” of what I
said they would be.
At Northcote (April 3) my colleague,
Senator Pearce, said that the average
monthly casualties had been 2,000 per
month, or ONLY ONE-NINTH of what we
said they would be.
• We both say that this falling off in
casualties is due to the winter season,
which has prevented severe fighting.
HOW WERE WE TO TELL LAST
OCTOBER THAT THERE WOULD BE
A WINTER IN EUROPE? IT UPSET
ALL OUR CALCULATIONS—IT EX-
PLAINS OUR ERRORS.
* * *
To the 103,000 reinforcements existing on
October 3, there has been added 27,000
new enlistments, making total reinforce-
ments 130.000
Less casualties since October 3 .. 12,000
Leaving 118,000
Out of these we have created and put
into France a new fighting division (the
fifth.) This leaves net reinforcements
98,000.
IF CASUALTIES INCREASE FROM
2,000 to 8,000 A MONTH, WE HAVE,
WITH THE MEN ENLISTED SINCE
OCTOBER 3, SUFFICIENT REINFORCE-
MENTS TO LAST FOR THE NEXT
TWELVE MONTHS.
You may say these facts demonstrate
to what an extent we misstated the facts
last October. We admit it. We do so
because the admission of the facts con-
stitute our only justification for our de-
sertion of the conscrlptlonlst policy. We
now say that “conscription Is not a vital
necessity”—therefore we drop it.
Ladies and gentlemen, after my re-
turn from Britain.
I found that recruiting had fallen off
very seriously—we wSre not getting
one half the necessary quota.
I now say we were. (Cheers).) X now
say that so far as we can see we can
carry on under the system as it was be-
fore I went to England. (More cheers.)
I now say we have such a surplus of
reinforcements in England that! in order
to reduce them, we are creating a new
army division (the Sixth).
“WE HAVE NOT ENOUGH MEN
TO REINFORCE FIVE DIVI-
SIONS. BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO CREATE A SIXTH DIVISION.
WE ARE SUPPRESSING THIS
FACT.”
I said—
“ Without conscription brave men
will die. —I now deny it.”
I said—
“ Conscription is essential for our
effective conduct of the war.—l now
deny it.”
I said—
“ Conscription is essential for
national preservation.—l now deny it.”
Upon these principles, whatever they
are, I stand, or do not stand, as circum-
stance require. Whatever they were, or
are, or may be, they are fundamental and
essential. (Loud and frantic cheering.)
Responsible Government
I (Mr. Hughes) said (August 6, 1914):
“The Fusion is the enemy of respon-
sible Government, the enemy of De-
mocracy, and of the rights of the
majority.”
I now deny it. 1 now say the Labor
party is the enemy of responsible Govern-
ment.
The Policy of
Protection
(Oration No. 7 by Mr. Hughes)
I said at Bendigo (March 27, 1917);
“While alteration of the tariff cannot
now be made, the Government is
pledged to deal with the matter directly
circumstances make it possible.’’
On April 2, Mr. Cook said:
“The tariff could not be re-opened;
international conditions prevented it.”
On April 5, the “Age” said:
“What means this shadowy verbiage.
The implication of Mr. Cook’s words is
that some foreign power threatens us
with dire perils if we dare achieve our
own economic salvation. Mr. Cook has
suggested that our autonomous powers
and rights no longer exist.
“In this case the Australian people
are no longer their own masters.”
Whether this is the case or not, the
people may judge for themselves.
I said to the Labor party inside Par-
liament, and the Federal Labor Execu-
tive outside Parliament:
“Gentlemen, —I am sorry to say that
new and unexpected developments make
it impossible to proceed further with
the tariff. It cannot be presented as a
subject for discussion. The represen-
tative of Japan has personally notified
me, in unmistakable and peremptory
language, that there must be no prefer-
ences as between allied nations, and any
step in that direction will be treated
as an unfriendly act.”
OFF TO ENGLAND.
I said it was imperative for me to pro-
ceed at once to England upon that and
kindred matters.
Upon that statement I secured *:he sus-
pension ol the proposed Referenda of
1915, and of the tariff, and at once took
my mysterious departure to England.
When I returned from England I re-
ported the result of negotiations between
the British Government, myself and the
representative of Japan,
I reported the desire of Japan for an
open door for its citizens, and the final
limitation of claim to those citizens of
Japan who were commercial traders.
I reported how it was agreed that
negotiations should be held over for
. settlement at a later date.
I stated that it was imperative the tariff
Mioaid be. held over so that when it came
to a final settlement, as to the ii 1 c(3j.-1 da-
tions of the Allies and their dependen-
cies, Australia would have “something to
offer” as a counter attraction to the de-
mands to be made for the relaxation of
its White Australia policy.
THE ALTERNATIVE.
If you accept this statement as correct,
then you are face to face with the fact
suggested by the “Age,” that the self-
governing powers and rights of Australia
no longer exist, and that the Australian
people are no longer the masters of their
own destiny. Its future foreign relations,
and, to an extent, its interna! relations,
will be settled, not by its own legislature,
but by agreements between the allied
powers after the war.
If you refuse to accept this statement
as correct, you charge me, not only with
having maligned' a friendly power, but
with having set up a bogey for the de-
ception of members, to divert them from
the performance of their duty, and that
by these means I prevented the creation
of an effective tariff.
If you accept the first position, in what
a parlous state is Australia, since it can
exercise no preferences, have no favored
nation amongst the Allies, and can only
have an effective tariff by a Chinese wall
so high that it will exclude every nation
in the world.
If you accept the second position, no
protectionist citizen or newspaper can
support me except by subordinating pro-
tectionist principles to assist in the at-
tempted annihilation of Labor so neces-
sary for ihe preservation of my position.
(Loud cheers.)
