MAGNA CARTA OF KING JOHN, A.D. 1215.
TRANSLATION.
(From an original in the British Museum: Cotton MS. Augustus 11. 106 ; given to Sir Robert Cotton by Humphrey Wyems in 1629.)
John, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke
of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou : To the Archbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Earls, Barons, Justiciaries, Foresters, Sheriffs, Reeves,
Ministers, and all Bailiffs and others, his faithful subjects, Greeting. Know
ye that We, in the presence of God, and for the health of Our soul, and the
souls of Our ancestors and heirs, to the honour of God, and the exaltation of
Holy Church, and amendment of Our kingdom, by the advice of Our
reverend Fathers, Stephen, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all
England, and Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church; Henry, Archbishop of
Dublin; William of London, Peter of Winchester, Jocelin of Bath and
Glastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of Worcester, William of Coventry,
and Benedict of Rochester, Bishops ; Master Pandulph, the Pope’s subdeacon
and familiar ; Brother Aymeric, Master of the Knights of the 1 emple in
England; and the noble persons, William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke;
William, Earl of Salisbury ; William, Earl of Warren; William, Earl of
Arundel ; Alan de Galloway, Constable of Scotland ; Warin Fitz-Gerald,
Peter Fitz-Herbert, Hubert de Burgh, Seneschal of Poitou, Hugh de Neville,
Matthew Fitz-Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip Daubeny, Robert
de Roppelay, John Marshal, John Fitz-Hugh, and others, Our liegemen, have,
in the first place, granted to God, and by this Our present Charter confirmed
for Us and Our heirs for ever —That the English Church shall be free and
enjoy her rights in their integrity and her liberties untouched. And that We
will this so to be observed appears from the fact that We of Our
free will, before the outbreak of the dissensions between Us and Our Barons,
granted, confirmed, and procured to be confirmed by Pope Innocent HI., the
freedom of elections which is considered most important and necessary to the
English Church, which Charter We will both keep Ourself and will it to be
kept with good faith by Our heirs for ever. We have also granted to all the
free men of Our kingdom, for Us and Our heirs for ever, all the liberties
underwritten, to have and to hold to them and their heirs of Us and Our heirs.
If any of Our Earls, Barons, or others who hold of Us in chief by Knight’s
service, shall die, and at the time of his death his heir shall be of full age
and owe a relief, he shall have his inheritance by ancient relief; to wit, the
heir or heirs of an Earl of an entire Earl’s Barony, too I. ; the heir or heirs of
a Baron of an entire Barony, too/. ; the heir or heirs of a Knight of an entire
Knight’s Fee, too.?, at the most; and he that oweth less shall give less,
according to the ancient custom of fees. If, however, the heir of any such
shall be under age and in ward, he shall, when he comes of age, have his
inheritance without relief or fine. The guardian of the land of any such heir
so under age shall take therefrom reasonable issues, customs and services
only, and that without destruction and waste of men or property ; and if We
shall have committed the custody of any such land to the Sheriff or any other
person who ought to be answerable to Us for the issues thereof, and he
commit destruction or waste upon the ward-lands, We will take an amends
from him, and the land shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men
of that fee, who shall be answerable for the issues to Us or to whomsoever
We shall have assigned them. And if We shall give or sell the wardship
of any such land to any one, and he commit destruction or waste upon it,
he shall lose the wardship, which shall be committed to two lawful and
discreet men of that fee, who shall, in like manner, be answerable unto Us
as hath been aforesaid. But the guardian, so long as he shall have the
custody of the land, shall keep up and maintain the houses, parks, fish ponds,
pools, mills, and other things pertaining thereto, out of the issues of the same,
and shall restore the whole to the heir when he comes of age, stocked with
ploughs and tillage, according as the season may require and the issues of
the land can reasonably bear. Heirs shall be married without disparagement,
yet so that the marriage shall be made known to the heir’s nearest of kin
before it be contracted. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall
immediately and without difficulty have her marriage portion and inheritance,
nor shall she give anything for her marriage portion, dower, or inheritance
which her husband and herself held on the day of his death ; and she may
remain in her husband’s house for forty days after his death, within which
time her dower shall be assigned to her. No widow shall be distrained to
marry so long as she has a mind to live without a husband ; provided,
however, that she give security that she will not marry without Our assent,
if she holds of Us, or that of the Lord of whom she holds, if she hold of
another. Neither We nor Our bailiffs shall seize any land or rent for any
debt so long as the debtor’s chattels are sufficient to discharge the same ; nor
shall the debtor’s sureties be distrained so long as the chief debtor hath
sufficient to pay the debt, and if he fail in the payment thereof, not having
wherewithal to discharge it, then the sureties shall answer it, and, if they will,
shall hold the debtor’s lands and rents until satisfaction of the debt which they
have paid for him be made them, unless the chief debtor can show himself
to be quit thereof against them. If any one shall have borrowed money
from the Jews, more or less, and die before the debt be satisfied, no interest
shall be taken upon such debt so long as the heir be under age, of whom-
soever he may hold; and if the debt shall fall into Our hands, We will only
take the principal sum mentioned in the Charter. And if any one die
indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her dower and pay nothing of that
debt ; and if the children of the said deceased be left under age, they shall
have necessaries provided for them according to the condition of the deceased,
and the debt shall be paid out of the residue, saving the Lord’s service ; and
so shall it be done with regard to debts owed to other persons than Jews.
No scutage or aid shall be imposed in Our kingdom unless by common
council thereof, except to ransom Our person, make Our eldest son a knight,
and once to marry Our eldest daughter, and for this a reasonable aid only
shall be paid. So shall it be with regard to aids from the City of London,
and the City of London shall have all her ancient liberties and free customs,
both by land and water. Moreover We will and grant that all other cities,
boroughs, towns, and ports shall have all their liberties and free customs.
And for obtaining the common council of the kingdom concerning the assess-
ment of aids other than in the three cases aforesaid or of scutage, We will
cause to be summoned, severally by Our letters, the Archbishops, Bishops,
Abbots, Earls, and great Barons ; and in addition We will also cause to be
summoned, generally, by Our sheriffs and bailiffs, all those who hold of Us
in chief, to meet at a certain day, to wit, at the end of forty days at least,
and at a certain place ; and in all letters of such summons We will explain
the cause thereof, and, the summons being thus made, the business shall
proceed on the day appointed, according to the advice of those who shall be
present, notwithstanding that the whole number of persons summoned shall
not have come. We will not, for the future, grant permission to any man to
levy an aid upon his freemen, except to ransom his person, make his eldest
son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter, for which a reasonable
aid only shall be levied. No man shall be distrained to perform more service
for a knight’s fee or other free tenement than is due therefrom. Common
Pleas shall not follow Our Court, but be hoklen in some certain place.
Recognisances of Novel Disseisin, Mort d’Ancestor, and Darrein Presentment
shall be taken in their proper counties only, and in this wise: We Ourself,
or, if We be absent from the realm, Our Chief Justiciary, shall send two
justiciaries through each county four times a year, who, together with four
knights elected out of each shire by the people thereof, shall hold the said
assizes on the day and in the place aforesaid. And if the said assizes cannot
be held on the day appointed, so many of the knights and freeholders as shall
have been present thereat on that day shall remain as will be sufficient for
the administration of justice, according as the business to be done be greater
or less. A free man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but according to
the measure thereof, and for a great crime according to its magnitude, saving
his position ; and in like manner a merchant saving his trade, and a
villein saving his tillage, if they should fall under Our mercy; and none
of the said amercements shall be imposed unless by the oath of honest
men of the venue. Earls and Barons shall only be amerced by their peers in
proportion to the measure of the offence. No clerk shall be amerced ior his
lay tenement, except after the manner of the other persons aforesaid, and not
according to the value of his ecclesiastical benefice. Neither shall any vill
or person be distrained to make bridges over rivers, but they who are
bound to do so by ancient custom and law. No sheriff, constable, coroners, or
other Our bailiffs shall hold pleas of Our Crown. All counties, hundreds,
wapentakes and trithings shall stand at the old farms, without any increased
rent, except Our demesne manors. If any one die holding a lay fee of Us,
and the sheriff or Our bailiff show Our letters patent of summons touching
the debt due to Us from the deceased, it shall be lawful to such sheriff or
bailiff to attach and register the chattels of the deceased found in the lay fee
to the value of that debt, by view ot lawful men, so that nothing be removed
therefrom until Our whole debt be paid ; and the residue shall be given up to
the executors to carry out the will of the deceased. And if there be nothing
due from him to Us, all his chattels shall remain to the deceased, saving to
his wife and children their reasonable shares. If any free man shall die
intestate, his chattels shall be distributed by the hands of his nearest kinsfolk
and friends by view of the Church, saving to every one the debts due to him
from the deceased. No constable or other Our bailiff shall take corn or other
chattels of any man without immediate payment for the same, unless he hath
a voluntary respite of payment from the seller. No constable shall distrain
any knight to give money for castle-guard, if he will perform it either in his
proper person or by some other fit man, if he himself be prevented from so
doing by reasonable cause; and, if We lead or send him into the army, he
shall be quit of castle-guard for the time he shall remain in the army by Our
command. No sheriff or other Our bailiff, or any other man, shall take the
horses or carts of any free man for carriage except with his consent. Neither
shall We or Our bailiffs take another man’s timber for Our castles or other uses,
unless with the consent of the owner thereof. We will only retain the lands
of persons convicted of felony for a year and a day, after which they shall be
restored to the Lords of the fees. From henceforth all fish-weirs shall be
entirely removed from the Thames and Medway, and throughout England,
except upon the sea coast. The writ called “ Praecipe ’ shall not for the future
issue to any one of any tenement whereby a freeman may lose his court. 1 here
shall be one measure of wine throughout Our kingdom, and one of ale, and one
measure of corn, to wit, the London quarter, and one breadth of dyed cloth,
russetts, and haberjects, to wit, two ells within the lists. And as with measures
so shall it also be with weights. From henceforth nothing shall be given or
taken for a writ of inquisition upon life or limbs, but it shall be granted gratis,
and shall not be denied. If anyone hold of Us by fee-farm, socage, or burgage,
and hold land of another by knight’s service, We will not have the wardship of
his heir, or the land which belongs to another man’s fee, by reason of that fee-
farm, socage or burgage ; nor will We have the wardship of such fee-farm,
socage or burgage, unless such fee-farm owe knight’s service. We will not have
the wardship of any man’s heir, or the land which he holds of another by knight s
service, by reason of any petty serjeanty which he holds of Us by service of
rendering Us daggers, arrows, or the like. No bailiff shall for the future put any
man to trial upon his simple accusation without producing credible witnesses
to the truth thereof. No freeman shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised,
outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will We proceed against or
prosecute him except by lawful judgment of his peers or the law of the land.
To no one will We sell, to none will We deny or defer, right or justice. All
merchants shall have safe conduct to go and come out of and into England,
and to stay in and travel through England by land and water for purchase or
sale, without maltolt, by ancient and just customs, except in time of war, and
if they belong to a country at war with Us. And if any such be found in
Our dominion at the outbreak of war, they shall be attached, without injury
to their persons or goods, until it be known to Us or Our Chief Justiciary,
after what sort Our merchants are treated who shall be found to be at that
time in the country at war with Us, and if they be safe there, then these shall
be so also with Us. It shall be lawful in future, unless in time of war, for
any one to leave and return to Our kingdom safely and securely by land and
water, saving his fealty to Us, for any short period, for the common benefit of
the realm, except prisoners and outlaws according to the law of the land,
people of the country at war with Us, and merchants who shall be dealt with
as is aforesaid. If any one die holding of any escheat, as of the honour of
Wallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or other escheats which are in
Our hands and are baronies, his heir shall not give any relief or do any
service to Us other than he would owe to the baron, if such barony should
have been in the hands of a baron, and We will hold it in the same manner in
which the baron held it. Persons dwelling without the forest shall not for
the future come before Our justiciaries of the forest by common summons,
unless they be impleaded or are bail for any person or persons attached for
breach of forest laws. We will only appoint such men to be justiciaries,
constables, sheriffs,‘or bailiffs as know the law of the land and will keep it
well. All barons, founders of abbeys by charters of English Kings or ancient
tenure, shall have the custody of the same during vacancy as is due. All
forests which have been afforested in Our time shall be forthwith disafforested,
and so shall it be done with regard to rivers which have been placed in fence
in Our time. All evil customs concerning forests and warrens, foresters,
warreners, sheriffs, and their officers, rivers and their conservators, shall be
immediately inquired into in each county by twelve sworn knights of such
shire, who must be elected by honest men thereof, and within iorty days after
making the inquisition they shall be [by theni\ altogether and irrevocably
abolished, [ provided that the matter shall have been previously brought to Our
knowledge , or that of Our Chief Justiciary if We Ourself shall not be in
England.\ We will immediately give up all hostages and charters delivered
to Us by the English for the security of peace and the performance of loyal
service. We will entirely remove from their bailiwicks the kinsmen t>f
Gerard de Athyes, so that henceforth they shall hold no bailiwick in
England, Engelard de Cygony, Peter and Guy and Andrew de Cancellis,
Guy de Cygony, Geoffrey de Martinny and his brothers, Philip Mark and his
brothers, and Geoffrey his nephew, and all their followers, and directly after
the restoration of peace We will dismiss out of Our kingdom all foreign
soldiers, bowmen, serving men, and mercenaries, who have come with horses
and arms to the nuisance thereof. If any one shall have been disseised or
deprived by Us, without the legal judgment of his peers, of lands, castles,
liberties, or rights, We will instantly restore the same, and if any dispute shall
arise thereupon, the matter shall be decided by judgment of the twenty-five
barons mentioned below for the security of peace. With regard to all those
things, however, whereof any person shall have been disseised or deprived,
without the legal judgment of his peers, by King Henry Our Father or Our
Brother King Richard, and which remain in Our hands or are held by others
under Our warranty, We will have respite thereof till the term commonly
allowed to the crusaders, except as to those matters on which a plea shall
have arisen, or an inquisition have been taken by Our command prior to Our
assumption of the Cross, and immediately after Our return from Our
pilgrimage, or if by chance We should remain behind from it, We will do full
justice therein. We will likewise have the same respite [and in like manner
shall justice be done\ with respect to forests to be disafforested [or to continue
as forests ], which Henry Our Father or Richard Our Brother afforested, and
to wardships of lands belonging to another’s fee, which We have hitherto held
by reason of the fee which some person has held of Us by knights service,
and to abbeys founded in another’s fee than Our own, whereto the lord of that
fee asserts his right. And when We return from Our pilgrimage, or if We
remain behind therefrom, We will forthwith do lull justice to the complainants
in these matters. No one shall be taken or imprisoned upon a woman s
appeal for the death of any other person than her husband. All fines unjustly
and unlawfully made with Us, and all amercements levied unjustly and
against the law of the land, shall be entirely condoned or the matter settled
by judgment of the twenty-five barons of whom mention is made below, for
the security of peace, or the majority of them, together with the aforesaid
Stephen, Archbishop of Canterbury, if he himself can be present, and any
others whom he may wish to summon for the purpose, and if he cannot be
present the business shall nevertheless proceed without him. Provided that
if any one or more of the said twenty-five barons be interested in a plaint of
this kind, he or they shall be set aside, as to this particular judgment, and
another or others, elected and sworn by the rest of the said barons for this
purpose only, be substituted in his or their stead. If We have disseised or
deprived the Welsh of lands, liberties, or other things, without legal judgment
of their peers, in England or Wales, they shall instantly be restored to
them, and if a dispute shall arise thereon, the question shall be determined on
the Marches by judgment of their peers according to the law of England with
regard to English tenements, the law of Wales respecting Welsh tenements,
and the law of the Marches as to tenements in the Marches. The same shall
the Welsh do to Us and Ours. But with regard to all those things whereof
any Welshman shall have been disseised or deprived, without legal judgment
of his peers, by King Henry Our Father or Our Brother King Richard, and
which We hold in Our hands or others hold under Our warranty, We will
have respite thereof till the term commonly allowed to the crusaders, except
as to those matters whereon a plea shall have arisen or an inquisition have
been taken by Our command prior to Our assumption of the Cross, and
immediately after Our return from Our pilgrimage, or if by chance We should
remain behind from it, We will do full justice therein, according to the laws of
the Welsh and the parts aforesaid. We will immediately give up the son of
Llywelyn and all the Welsh hostages, and the charters which were delivered
to Us for the security of peace. We will do the same with regard to
Alexander, King of the Scots, in the matter of giving up his sisters and
hostages, and of his liberties and rights, as We would with regard to Our
other barons of England, unless it should appear by the charters which W e
hold of William his father, late King of the Scots, that it ought to be
otherwise, and this shall be done by judgment of his peers in Our court. All
which customs and liberties aforesaid, which We have granted to be enjoyed, as
far as in Us lies, by Our people throughout Our kingdom, let all Our subjects,
clerks and laymen, observe, as far as in them lies, towards their dependants.
And whereas We, for the honour of God and the amendment of Our realm,
and in order the better to allay the discord arisen between Us and Our
barons, have granted all these things aforesaid, We, willing that they be for
ever enjoyed wholly and in lasting strength, do give and grant to Our
subjects the following security, to wit, that the barons shall elect any
twenty-five barons of the kingdom at will, who shall, with their utmost power,
keep, hold, and cause to be hoklen the peace and liberties which We ha\ e
granted unto them, and by this Our present Charter confirmed, so that, for
instance, if We, Our Justiciary, bailiffs, or any of Our ministers, offend in any
respect against any man, or shall transgress any of these articles of peace or
security, and the offence be brought before four of the said five and twenty
barons, those four barons shall come before Us, or Our Chief Justiciary if \\ e
are out of the kingdom, declaring the offence, and shall demand speedy
amends for the same. And if We or, in case of Our being out of the
kingdom, Our Chief Justiciary, fail to afford redress within the space of
forty days from the time the case was brought before Us or, in the event of
Our having been out of the kingdom, Our Chief Justiciary, the aforesaid four
barons shall refer the matter to the rest of the twenty-five barons, who,
together with the commonalty of the whole country, shall distrain and distress
Us to the utmost of their power, to wit, by capture of Our castles, lands,
possessions, and all other possible means, until compensation be made
according to their decision, saving Our person and that of Our Queen and
children, and as soon as that be done they shall return to their former
allegiance. Any one whatsoever in the kingdom may take oath that, for the
accomplishment of all the aforesaid matters, he will obey the orders of the
said twenty-five barons, and distress Us to the utmost of his power ; and \\ e
give public and free leave to every one wishing to take such oath to do so,
and to none will We deny the same. Moreover all such of Our subjects
who shall not of their own free will and accord agree to swear to the said
twenty-five barons, to distrain and distress Us together with them, We will
compel to do so by Our command as is aforesaid. And if any one of the
twenty-five barons shall die or leave the country, or be in any way hindered
from executing the said office, the rest of the said twenty-five barons shall
choose another in his stead, at their discretion, who shall be sworn in like
manner as the others. And in all cases which are referred to the said
twenty-five barons to execute, and in which a difference shall arise among
them, supposing them all to be present, or that all who have been summoned
are unwilling or unable to appear, the verdict of the majority shall be
considered as firm and binding as if the whole number should have been of
one mind. And the aforesaid twenty-five shall swear to keep faithfully all
the aforesaid articles, and, to the best of their power, cause them to be kept
by others. And We will not procure, either by Ourself or any other,
anything from any man whereby any of the said concessions or liberties may
be revoked or abated ; and if any such procurement be made let it be null
and void ; it shall never be made use of either by Us or any other. We have
also wholly remitted and condoned all ill-will, wrath, and malice which have
arisen between Us and Our subjects, clerks and laymen, during the disputes,
to and with all men ; and We have moreover fully remitted, and, as far as in
Us lies, wholly condoned to and with all clerks and laymen all trespasses
made in consequence of the said disputes from Easter in the sixteenth year of
Our reign till the restoration of peace; and, over and above this, We ha\ e
caused to be made in their behalf letters patent by testimony of Stephen,
Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry, Archbishop of Dublin, the Bishops
above-mentioned, and Master Pandulph, for the security and concessions
aforesaid. Wherefore We will, and firmly charge, that the English Church
be free, and that all men in Our kingdom have and hold all the aforesaid
liberties, rights, and concessions, well and peaceably, freely, quietly, fully, and
wholly, to them and their heirs, of Us and Our heirs, in all things and places
for ever, as is aforesaid. It is moreover sworn, as well on Our part as on
the part of the Barons, that all these matters aforesaid shall be kept in good
faith and without deceit. Witness the aforesaid and many others. Given
by Our hand in the meadow which is called Runnymede between Windsor
and Staines, on the Fifteenth day of June in the Seventeenth year of
Our reign.
