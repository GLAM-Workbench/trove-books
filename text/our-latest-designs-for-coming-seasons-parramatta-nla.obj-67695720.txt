OUR LATEST DESIGNS FOR COMING SEASONS
Parramatta Dyers
ARE FASHIONABLE FURRIERS
DO YOU KNOW WHY Parramatta Furriers,
Dyers?, etc., Fur Necklets, Stoles, Coats, Eugs,
etc., are so soft and pliable, so glossy and good
looking, and so light in -weight? It is because
they are treated, cured, dyed, etc., by special
lurrying processes at our own factory under our
own personal supervision. The reason for this
is to avoid skins being roughly handled and too
heavily tanned at tanneries, as it takes furriers
to understand the treatment of pelts to get the
pliabilities and lifeness of same, and also to
preserve the sheen and life in the fibre of the
fur. THAT IS WHY CUE FUES AEE GOOD.
When you place your skins in our hands, they
do not leave our own factory and workrooms
until your order is completed.
We wish it to be clearly understood, and for
you to rest assured, that our work is not sub let
or sent away to other tanneries, or let out to
other workrooms on contract.
THE FEW DESIGNS that are shown on this
Catalogue are only portion of what we do, and
are really for country clients for every-day wear,
and the prices are based on a minimum charge.
And should you require any special designs and
linings, etc., such as Cuffs and Collars, or special
designs for Travelling Eugs, which are often
given for presentations, etc., or Travelling Boots,
Fur Hats, Foot Warmers, or Fur Trimmings, etc.,
etc., we will only be too pleased to quote for
same.
Polishing of Skins
Parramatta Furriers have installed, at con-
siderable expense, a most Up-to-date POLISH-
ING MACHINE, so as to give the Fur every
chance to show its beautiful effect; and it also
cleans dead hairs out, which is greatly appre-
ciated by wearers of Fur Garments, Eugs, etc.;
and we may say this is one of our leading points,
for which we are receiving testimonials daily.
Cleaning
We CLEAN and FEEE FUES from moths,
etc. White or any delicate colored Fur soon
becomes soiled, and many people keep cleaning
them with benzine and other home mixtures,
until, after a short time, the benzine has
changed the color of the Fur, and the dirt has
worked right into the texture. Then, all hope
of restoring the cleanliness has gone. It is
much better to take the Fur to people who thor-
oughly understand their business, and pay for
the cleaning, than to try and save a few shillings
and ruin a costly garment. We cater for Clean-
ing of Furs by special French process, and it
gives the new effect, and your old Fur is itself
once more.

DESIRABILITY OF QUALITY. IMPORTANCE OF PRICE
The wonderful reputation enjoyed by the PAEEAMATTA FURRIERS has been won by HIGH QUALITY and
MODERATE PEICES. Our dominant and guiding principle is, and always has been, to supply a sound and reliable and
attractive FUE GARMENT at a REASONABLE FIGURE. To-day, when advertising occupies such a prominent place
in business, it is more desirable than ever that the importance of QUALITY should be emphasised. Quality is always
remembered long after price has been forgotten. Showy sketches, low prices?they abound on every side; but they
do not necessarily mean satisfied customers.
We specially desire to thank our numerous clients for their many letters of appreciation and delight with their
articles; also for their kind recommendation, which is a continual source of great gratification to us.
Skins can be forwarded by post or rail, and then the Measurement Form and the Number of Design required.
Also state when you would like the order completed, and to what address the article is to be returned to.
Cheques and Postal Orders to be made payable to the PAEEAMATTA FURRIERS and DYERS, and crossed.
FURS GET CRUSHED WHEN FORWARDING
Allowance must be made for the crushed appearance of Furs when they are unpacked. No damage is caused by
this crushing; so just shake them up well, and the Furs will resume their original appearance and beauty after being-
exposed to the air (not bright sunshine) for a time. While you are wearing the Furs during the season, it would be well
to brush them up from time to time, as this will tend to keep them looking fresh. Don?t abuse your Furs by throw-
ing them down in a heap after you have been out in the rain, or by placing them on a radiator or close to a hot
stove. If the Furs have become damp, take a clothes brush, and brush them well, with the nap or grain of the Fur,
until it is all smooth. Then hang in a moderately cool room and allow to dry. After the Fur is perfectly dry, it can
be shaken up or whipped with a whip or flexible cane. If necessary, the clothes brush can be slightly dampened with
water in order to smooth down spots where the Fur is ruffled and crushed. Care should be taken, however, that the
leather does not become wet; in fact, all excess water should be shaken out of the brush before touching the Fur.
