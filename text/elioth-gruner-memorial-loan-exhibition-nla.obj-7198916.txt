ELIOTH GRUNER,
THIS Memorial Exhibition of paintings by EUoth
Gruner represents him in many interesting phases,
and it has been assembled as a tribute of apprecia-
tion and to demonstrate the importance, beauty and
charm of the work of one of Australia’s foremost
landscape painters.
He was born at Gisborne, New Zealand, on 16th December,
1882, and he died at Bondi, Sydney, on the 17th October, 1939.
His father was a Norwegian and his mother Irish, and they arrived
in Sydney when Elioth was an infant. When 12 years of age—so
Julian Ashton records in his intimate and interesting reminiscences of
Gruner—this shy lad destined to become a great painter was taken by
his mother to the studio and he became a pupil of that eminent instructor
in 1894.
Gruner first exhibited with the Society of Artists in 1913, and his
landscapes at that early date gave an indication of individuality and fine
quality which developed progressively until the end.
Three years later he was awarded the “ Wynne Art Prize ” for
the best landscape of the year entitled “The Morning Light.” Although
a small painting it is regarded as one of his most successful, indicating
profound observation of light, and brilliancy of technique. It is in the
National Collection of N.S.W,


Success quickly followed Gruner’s first achievement as he again
won the prize in 1919. Altogether he won this coveted distinction-
seven times, the last being in 1937 with a landscape entitled
“ Weetangra ” (Canberra).
This effort was exhibited at the Society of Artists Exhibition in
1937, and it gained the Society’s award for the finest landscape
exhibited in that year. Regarded by many artists and connoisseurs as
the best of his recent paintings it indicated Gruner’s acute interest in
design, the pattern being arresting and satisfying and the scheme of
colour perfect and true in the variation and subtlety of values.
Gruner as an accomplished painter is well revealed by twenty
examples in the Sydney Gallery, embracing varying facets of his work,
and he is also well represented in other national collections throughout
the Commonwealth. Private collectors and institutions possess excellent
examples, many being included in this exhibition.
He also exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, and the Paris
Salon, and was a prominent member and regular exhibitor of the Society
of Artists and the Australian Academy of Art of which body he was a
foundation member.
In 1923 he visited England for the first time, at the age of forty-
one, and as manager of the Exhibition of Australian Art, held at the
Royal Academy, London, rendered valuable service in bringing before
the English public the work of Australian Artists. He spent three
years abroad, visiting the Continent to study paintings in famous galleries.
Those three years of study greatly improved his sense of design,
developed a finer construction, simplification of pattern, improved his
technique and beneficially affected his general outlook. The pictures
he painted at St. Tropez in the south of France demonstrate his rapid
development during the period.


In 1921 The Trustees of the National Gallery of N.S.W. gave
him a special commission to paint a large landscape. He chose the
“ Valley of the Tweed ” and he successfully portrayed an expanse of
typical Australian country. When exhibited in London the art critic
of The Times described it as the most vital and beautiful landscape
of the year.
Pictures such as “ Early Spring,” “ Winter Morning,” “ Morning
Sheen,” and ” The Morning Light ” indicate a sensitive approach to
subject with resultant vibrancy and charm, and how above all the effect
of light gave stimulus and made the greatest appeal. Norman Lindsay
says “ I do not believe any other painter on earth has yet made such a
profound analysis of light in Nature as Elioth Gruner.”
Gruner loved flowers and although he did not produce a great
number of studies his sense of decoration, arrangement and fine colour
always ensured great distinction.
The passing of Elioth Gruner leaves a very definite void in the
realm of Australian Art, He was, pre-eminently, a distinguished land-
scape painter, possessing an acute and analytical mind, intensely receptive
to the infinite and elusive variations of light and colour which he depicted
poetically and lyrically with accomplished and charming technical skill.
A painter is fortunate to the extent that his work lives on and
Gruner’s work is his enduring monument, and will continue to give
pleasure and to influence the lives of those who have the eye to see and
the heart to understand for long years yet to be. His creative work
deserved and received continuous recognition; it enriches not only our
national galleries but innumerable private collections.
Those who were privileged to know him, and he had hosts of
admirers and friends, will retain an acute recollection of the charm of
personality, his indefatigable industry, his sincerity and his modesty.
