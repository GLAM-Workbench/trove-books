...SACRED CANTATA
(Original),
“ Fidei Victoriae in Australasia.”
PROLOGUE
The First Scene takes us back to Australia before civilisation
was introduced. Angels sing of Australia’s high destiny, and bid
her arise from her lethargy and fulfil her mission. Australia
awakes, and is filled with intense joy ; but, as the Angels’ song has
ceased, she becomes afraid, and despairs of ever being set free.
She upbraids the Sea for his incessant wail, and asks him to tell
her of her mission. From her captor she receives no response, and
earnestly begs the Angels to make known her fate. The heavenly
visitants, pitying her misery, return and tell her to lift her eyes to
her Maker, Who will send help from the Isle of Tears, the Land of
Saints—lreland.
In the last scene the Angels of the States, New Zealand,
Charity, and Schools briefly relate the progress of the Faith in
Australasia.
Australia is then crowned by the Angels of Faith, Hope and
Charity, and receives the homage of her children. She renders
thanks to the Lord, “for He hath regarded His maiden’s low
estate.” The Cantata ends with a hymn of praise to the Most High.

* Fidei Victoria; in Australasia.
Chorus (Angels).
Lo ! we leave bright realms of light,
Lo! we leave biod’s holy sight,
Lord of glory and of might!
His heralds to become.
Lo! we leave God’s beauteous Face
Lo! we flit through boundless space,
Laden with His holy grace,
His heralds to become.
Recitative.
’Mid surging waves a lonely Isle still sleeps
In Southern seas that bathe her rocky steeps.
Calmly she sleeps, unconscious of her destiny,
Which is sublime to be throughout eternity.
None but her dusky sons their vigil keep
Along her golden sand.
Chorus.
Soon will the Lord a full, rich harvest reap
In this fair Austral land.
Solo.
Her gold-wreathed hills, her fertile plains,
Her woods and valleys green,
Her sunny clime, her vast domains
Claim Freedom as their Queen.
Recitative and Chorus.
Arise! arise ! cast off thy chains;
Too long thou sleepest here.
Arise I arise ! thy Maker deigns
To give thee bright career.


Our Lord is King, our Lord is King.
From bondage He will set thee free,
Arise I arise! rejoice and sing,
O King of heaven and earth is He.
Rkcitative and Semi-Chords.
Be not afraid,
Good tidings bring we of our King,
Mighty and great is He,
Gracious and good is He.
Be not afraid,
From Him we come, rejoice and sing,
We are heralds of the Lord ;
We are angels of the King.
Scene IT.
Solo ( Australia).
Whence come those voices sweet and clear,
Thrilling my soul to ecstasy?
Soft magic tones fell on mine ear
In Music’s sweetest melody.
Methought I heard the angels sing,
“ Rejoice! rejoice! our God will set thee free.”
But no! these chains to me still cling;
'Twas but a dream—no hope of liberty.
O mighty sea, thy ceaseless wail I hear;
Why tunest thou thy saddest song alway?
E’en now sweet echoes fall upon my ear
Of joyous strains that float upon thy spray.
O mighty sea, my sorrowing heart console;
O give me hope that I may yet be free.
Chant not my solemn dirge, nor death-bell toll,
Sublime and high my future is to be.
Oh! could thy lonely murmurs but foretell
My mission, oh! could I know my fate!
Away, away, thou canst not break the spell.
Seraphic voice, oh! come, I thee await.
Recitative ( Angel of Hope),
See how' she grieveth, lone Child of the Southern Seas,
so sad and weary. But the angels of the Lord will comfort
bring her whom God loveth.


Trio (Angels Faith, Hope, Charity). (Elijah.)
“ Lift thine eyes to the mountains,
Whence cometh help. Thy help
Cometh from the Lord, the
Maker of heaven and earth.
He hath said, thy foot shall
Not be moved; thy Keeper
Will never slumber.”
Solo and Vocal Accompaniment.
As sweet to weary hearts as slumber,
And brooding gently as the dove,
When earth’s low, passing cares encumber,
Bright Hope comes missioned from above.
Where gloomed the cloud, a glory brightens;
Where sorrow wept, there gladness smiles,
While trusting faith the spirit lightens,
And aimless doubt no more beguiles.
Chorus.
Angel of Hope linger near her.
Solo ( Angel of Hope) .
There is a gem
That shines with lustre, brighter than fine gold,
Softer than pearl—of worth and price untold —
In Angel’s diadem
’Tie set; than morning dewdrop far more clear,
Its name is Hope, sweet Hope, Australia dear.
Recitative and Chorus. (Eli.)
The Lord is thy Keeper;
No evil shall befall thee—
Dear object of His choice,
This night our Lord will call thee
In a still, small voice.
Thy God saith they that fear Him
Shall heart and soul rejob e.
Awake, awake, and hear Him
In a still, small voice!
Scene ITT,
Chorus and Solo.
Glory, glory to God on high ;
Faith, Hope, and Love to thee are nigh.


Aria ( Australia),
Hark ! hark ! that seraph’s voice again 1 hear,
So sweet, so soft, melodious and clear.
Recitative {Angel Guardian).
Arise! arise! thy Maker smiles on thee,
Sublime and high thy mission is to be.
Aria (Australia).
And who art thou, ethereal spirit bright,
Whose dazzling radiance dims the sun’s great light?
Aria (Angel Guardian).
Angel, chosen of the Lord to be thy guide,
Through sorrow’s surge and joy’s calm tide.
Aria (Australia).
Speak not of sorrow, Angel fair,
My heart thou burdenest with dark care.
Aria (Angel Guardian).
A crimson stain of deepest hue
Shall tarnish thy fair fame,
A sword of grief thy heart shall pierce
In vaunting justice’s name.
Duet.
A ustralia —Ah ! woe is mine ! ah ! woe is mine !
Angel Guardian —Great hope is thine, great hope is thine
Australia— Help, help, sweet spirit, help, I pray.
Angel Guardian —Soon will thy sorrow fade away.
Chorus.
1 ! lift thine eyes, fair Austral land,
To that lov’d Isle of Tears,
Whose heart has bled in Faith’s great cause,
Through long and weary years.
Still bleeds, poor land, o’er cruel wrongs,
And deeds unholy.
Solo (Angel of Erin).
The land of God’s own chosen saints,
So meek and lowly.


Her fearless sons to thee will bring
Faith, hope and charity ;
Her daughters brave will cross the seas,
To teach thee purity.
Chorus.
Lift up thine eyes, rejoice knd sing,
In tones of jubilation ;
O weep no more, from thee will spring
A free and holy nation.
Trio.
A ngel of Hope —
Dear, tender child, lit with the torch of Heaven,
Seeking communion with thy Saviour dear;
Not in the opening flower or star at even,
Shine the Almighty Power and Love more clear.
Guardian Angel —
0 haste ! nor let thy features longer slumber,
But seek to light them with a heavenly gleam,
Embrace thy Lord, and blessings without number
Shall shower upon thee in that heavenly stream.
A ustralia —
Grant me to live, O Saviour, meek and lowly,
Firm in Thy faith, nor from Thee ever stray ;
Imprint upon my brow the sign, so holy,
Of Thy dear Cross, where passed my sins away.

For He hath regarded His maiden’s low estate,
O be it mine for ever, Lord, according to Thy word I
