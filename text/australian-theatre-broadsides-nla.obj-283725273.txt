TALL TALK I
Some few years ago, Anthony Trollope, the Great Author,
after “ doing 1 Australasia, and upon arriving back at the
“Tight Little Island,” is reported t© have said that Aus-
tralians were fond of “ Blowing,” alias “ Gassing,” Egotism
or “Tali” Talk. Well, perhaps so; but at all events they
have also proved themselves able to ‘ do ” something else
but “Talk”;or “ Blow,” and when we say—yes, and say it
. with a “ Loud Voice ” —that our
HALF-GUINEA BOOTS
are the Best Value in Austral a, we are not indulging in
“Blow,” but simply stating an irreproachable, undeniable,
unmistakable, honest truth. But be careful that you take
ONLY the J.H. Brand.

Thus an American paper.— The tele-
graph companies of Australia suffer a
good deal from the fondness of the
natives for bracelets and ear and nose
rings made of telegraph wire.” All this
statement, by the way, is true, excej
that there are no telegraph companies i>
Australia, and that the few stray aborig

jiever dream even remotely of touchi

The Amateur: “I’ve been here a couple

The Professional: “ Well, you just have
patience, an’ your hook may drift nigh
some fish that’s trying to commit suicide.”
“See here,” yelled the theatrical mana-
ger, “ you call this play a al drama,
don’t you ? ”
iH“I do,” replied the modest «pthof
“And you claim to be a reajst ? "
“ Well, I’ve introduced the Id oaken

“ Bat where’s the mortgage ? ” he
shrieked. “ Who ever heard c ; farm-

A silver shekel of the time of Simon
Macoa beaus has been discovered in Gal-
veston, U.S.A., and is causing much
speculation. It is valued by experts at
JBI2OO, and is 2033 years old.
He—“ Just think of it. They say
man descended from a monkey.” She—
“ A come down, indeed.”
LoVi£ AND TIME.
AN OLDEN LEGEND.
“My heart is broken,” she criel, who had been in love
and was deserted. “Oh, who will mend it?”
Love, who was standing near at hand, indicated an old
man who was passing through the gateway. “He will do
it,” he said. “They call him Father Time.”
“Stop, Father Time,” cried the maiden, “and mend
my heart.” But Father Time stops for no one, and was
soon mounting the hill in the distance. Over hill and over
dale he went, and the maiden was tired with running.
Then she came back to Love, and reproached him. “ Yon
told me Time would mend my heart, and it is still broken,”
But Love knew better. Three years had flown, and he
told the maiden to look and see for herself. And, 10, the
heart was whole again.
The difference between that maiden’s heart and the
Ansonia Watch is that the latter never requires mending.
Of coursept can be broken; you can break It with an axe ;
but, short of that rough treatment, it will go to the end.
And, what is more, it will go RIGHT. A watch that
won’t do this is worse than no watch, as it not only won’t
tell the time correctly, but it causes one to misplace one’s
confidence. How many boats, trams, trains, ’buses, appoint-
ments, and other things have been 1 st through a watch
that won’t keep time? It would bo impossible to count
them.
The Ansonia Watch is a beautiful nickel-silver watch,
stem winder, lever movement, second hand, open face, an I
is regulated just like any other watch. It looks well, it ? g
made well, and it will go well, and the price in Sydney is
only 5s fid. Of coarse, when the Federal tariff is imposed,
this 5s fid will have to be 6s fid; but, meantime, anyon e
wanting an Ansonia can have it for the sum named—ss fid, or
6s in the country. If you cannot get supplied easily, just
send 6s ia stamps or money order to the Ansonia Sydney
Depot, 54 Margaret-street, when a sample will be mailed
you.

“ Six years,” said the young barrister.
“ How unfortunate.”

“Oqme ? What is it ?”
“ I’ve bet five dollars that you wfll suicide
within a week. I’ve been watching you very
closely for the last half hour, and all signs in-
dicate melancholy and despondency. Have you

poison, the rope, drowning or hanging ? ”

“ That’s too bad. 1 wish I could have seen
you last week. ”
“ Why last week ? ”
“ Because I then had the ager every day right
along—two nows were sick on my hands—my
girl had gone back on me, and I expected a

hundred dollars. I did kinder think of suicide.”

He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russeß
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley,
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe. On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “I thought youjyeren’t goinrr,
to stop in England r”
“Well,” said* the Prince, “It’s this way;
If the Prino3 of Wales should go to
America an A pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it queer, r ' so I thought
I’d stop oyer here a few days and pay my

Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wif®
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols, a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportprial description the following day
in the chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”
