The Gutta Percha Company beg to call the attention of the COMMISSIONERS OF

GOVERNMENT and other EMIGRATION AGENTS, and SHIPPERS, and in particular,
INTENDING
To the peculiar properties of their Manufactures, as exhibited in the following list, and their great
superiority over all other articles of their class, not only on shipboard, but after arrival at the
place of destination.
No Emigrant should leave England without a Stock of
SOLES AND SOLUTION.
The ease with which Gutta Percha Soles can be applied to Boots and Shoes, in countries where no
Shoemaker can readily be found —their power of keeping the feet perfectly dry, when wading in either
fresh or sea water, and thus preserving the wearer from coughs, colds, and consumption, in lands where
medical advice cannot he procured—added to their great durability and cheapness, render them highly
conducive to the comfort and well-being of persons emigrating to distant countries.
The following important testimonials shew the value of Gutta Percha Soles, and how much they con-
tribute to the health and comfort of persons who, like emigrants, have to bear continual exposure to
the weather.
From CAPTAIN SIR JOHN ROSS, E.N.
“ I have worn Patent Gutta Percha Soles during the last two years, and have found them most valuable for preserving
the feet dry and warm. They are very superior to leather, being not only perfectly waterproof, but also more durable
than leather.
TO SAILORS —especially those proceeding to the Arctic Regions, Gutta Percha will prove a Warm Friend owing
to its peculiar power of resisting frost. I shall take care to have a supply, not only of the Soles, but also of the Bowls,
Tubing, &c., for my next
From CAPTAIN JOHN CROW, of the Teviot Schooner, Berwick-on-Tweed,
and Miller’s Wharf, Bondon.
u I have worn a pair of Gutta Percha Soles on my sea boots for two winters, without requiring any
repairs; and it would seem as though constant steeping in wet, made them wear the longer.
I find the Gutta Percha to be much better than leather, as the wet cannot possibly penetrate through it. I have,
in some cases, had these sea boots on for three days and nights successively, in heavy weather, and have had my
feet kept dry and comfortable. < ,
My crew now use it, and like it as much as myself. I recommend all Sailors to wear these Gutta Percha
Soles, and am sure that they will find them to be a blessing.” JOHN C ? W,
Berwich-on-Tweed, October 12 th, 1850. v _ . Captain of the Teviot Schooner.

GUTTA PERCHA LINING FOR BOXES,
&c., IN LIEU OF TIN OR ZINC.
Gutta Percha Sheeting is superior to Tin and Zinc for lining boxes, &c., not only on account of its
waterproof qualities—its freedom from rust —and the ease with which it can be applied, but it is considera-
bly lighter than either, and at the end of the voyage may be easily converted into lining for Water
Tanks and Cisterns, Soles for Boots and Shoes, and Domestic Utensils of many different kinds, which the
Emigrant is almost certain to require. And tin same remark applies to the other descriptions of goods,
which follow —as they may be transformed into o* °r shapes at will, with the greatest ease and facility..

In consequence of the durability of Gutta Percha, and its non-liability to brekaage, even when violently
thrown down, these chamber vessels are strongly recommended to Emigrants and others, particularly on
shipboard. They are lighter and more portable than any other kind ever introduced to the public, and
are totally unaffected by acids, requiring only to be washed with cold water to keep them perfectly
clean and sweet.

of a whole family may be saved, in case of shipwr ck. The one shewn above is made in four air-tight

USED IN THE “PRINCE ALBERT” EXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF
SIR JOHN FRANKLIN.
Extract from a Letter addressed by W. P. SNOW, Esq., to the Gutta Percha Company,
8, Clifton Terrace,
West Brompton, Jan. 10,1850,
The Gutta Percha Boat was
a great favourite of mine; and
being desirous of testing the
value of Gutta Percha when
applied to Boats, I worked her
pretty sharply in various ways.'
She answered most admirably.
In the ice—in open water —
under sail, or as a row-boat, she
proved the best I had ever been
acquainted with, and I should,
most certainly, strongly recom-
mend Gutta Percha Boats for
general service in the colder
regions. Yours, &c.
“ She behaved admirably :
“ every voice was in praise of
“ her: the Gutta Percharesisted
“ the ice in a manner truly sur-
“ prising, and glided past it
“ unhurt; whereas, if we had
“ had our mahogany, or any
“ other kind of boat,' it would
“ have been in great danger,
“ and, in all probability, on our
“ returning through the ice
“ afterwards, would have been
“ crushed like an egg shell.”

SUITABLE FOR
Clothes’ Lines, Window Blind Cord, Cording of Boxes, Signal Halliards, Life Buoys, &c.
One of the peculiar, and at the same time, most interesting properties of this cord is, its extreme
buoyancy, which prevents its sinking below the surface of the water. By the accidental upsetting of
a boat when just alongside, or other casualty, it not unfrequently happens that a number of individuals
are thrown into the water at one and the same instant, and in the next, pass into the wake of the swiftly
receding ship. In such a case, if a common hempen rope and life buoy were thrown out, the buoy would
float, but the rope being heavier than water, would soon sink and he out of reach, leaving a long space
between the ship and the buoy, without a point at which a drowning man could grasp. If, on the contraryv
a Gutta Percha Line were used, it would float on the surface of the water, and thus present,
throughout its entire length, the means of safety to all who were near it.
N.B.—The cord for this purpose should be of the natural colour.
For Clothes’ Lines, and other uses, where it is constantly exposed to the weather, the Gutta Percha
Cord is invaluable, as no excess of moisture has any effect upon it.
Gutta Percha Canisters for Gunpowder, &e.
To parties shipping Gunpowder, and to Emigrants generally, the following letter, received by the
Gutta Percha Company from Messrs. F. BRITTON & SON, Ironmongers, Nottingham, will be of
interest.
(Copy.) Nottingham, December 1 6th, 1850.
We have, during the last two years, used a Gutta Percha Carboy or Canister, for holding our stock of Gunpowder,
and notwithstanding its being kept in a damp cellar, we find the powder not only to be preserved perfectly dry, but as
strong at the end of twelve months as when first made. We previously used an iron vessel, in which the powder became
damp within a week. We think this to be a good application of Gutta Percha, particularly as it is non-porous, and proof
against lightning. We are, Gentlemen, yours obediently*

THE CrUTTA FEECHA COMPANY, PATENTEES,
Directions for putting on Patent Gutta Percha Soles.
Thoroughly dry the sole of the boot or shoe, and rough it well with a rasp. Heat the sole of the boot or shoe before
the fire, then rub well in a thin coat of warm Solution —let that dry, then hold it to the fire, and whilst warm, put on a
second coat of Solution spread thicker than the first; let this dry also. Then take the Gutta Percha sole, hold that to the
fire in one hand and the hoot or shoe in the other, when they will speedily become sticky; immediately lay the sole on,
beginning at the toe, pressing it gradually, until it adheres firmly in every part. In half an hour, pare off carefully with
a sharp knife, ( When the sole is too thick to become sufficiently pliable by holding to the fire, let it be immersed in hot water
until soft enough to fit the last; when taken out wipe it perfectly dry, and ho 1 d to the fire as before directed.) As the
grease and dressing of the upper leather must necessarily more or less stick to the hands of the workman, it is desirable
as a last operation, slightly to moisten a sponge with pure Naphtha, and rub over therewith the surface of the sole, and
also that of the boot or shoe to which it is to be applied, before warming them at the fire, thus removing all grease,
and ensuring perfect adhesion.
Solution is warmed as glue is commonly heated, by placing in boiling water a vessel containing the required quantity
to be used. Apply it in a warm state, stirring it before using. Be careful that the water is not allowed to mix with the
Solution. The Solution may be reduced in consistence by adding pure Coal-tar Naphtha. If the common Naphtha
(which is greasy) be used, it will prevent the sole sticking securely.
ANOTHER METHOD.
Ist. — Dry the soles well.
2nd. —Rasp or scrape them till you have a clean leathery surface.
3rd. —Heat the sole of the shoe against a clear fire, then take a small portion of the Cement on a knife, lay it on the
heated sole till it melts, spread it with the knife or the finger (the last is best) before the fire, till the sole is covered with a
good coat; hold it there till the solvent is evaporated, and a sticky coat only is left. It is of service if the Cement take
fire for a moment, which it will do, if fresh.
4th. —Tack temporarily on a piece of wood (to prevent burning the fingers) at two corners, the Gutta Percha sole, and
hold it to the fire till sticky all over, at the same time re-heat the shoe sole, —when ready, lay the Gutta Percha sole on,
commencing at the toe, being careful no air is between, which is best avoided by passing the thumb down the middle before
closing at the sides —in a quarter of an hour it may be pared and finished.
N.B. If the sole is thin, it is best held against a clear fire as short a time as possible, so as to make the surface
sticky before the heat passes through the sole to make it too soft. If thick, a slower fire is better.
To prevent Slipping* in Frosty Weather.
Slightly warm the Gutta Percha sole before the fire, and whilst warm press it upon a little rough sand, emery
powder, iron filings, Ac. .
Or, warm the centre of the sole against a clear fire, so as to soften the surface only, and apply upon it a piece of woollen
cloth, 3 to 3| inches square, and it will be safer walking with Gutta Percha than with leather soles.
Or, moisten a small portion of the sole with Naphtha, Camphine, or Turpentine, and set it on fire, let it burn a few
moments so as to soften the surface of the Gutta Percha ; warm the cloth, and apply it to the soft portion of the sole. If
a little Solution be spread upon the cloth, it will adhere much more permanently.
V'• I
Directions to Emigrants for Soleing* Shoes without Solution.
Rough the sole as before stated—then hold it to the fire, and while warm, rub into it with a heated iron
or poker (in the same manner as you would make a pitch plaster), some thin parings of Gutta Percha, which
will melt without burning if the instrument be not too hot. Having covered the leather sole in this manner, warm both
it and the Gutta Percha sole until they are sticky, in the usual manner, and bring them together as before directed.
Many persons adopt this method in preference to any other.
Instructions for lining Cisterns, Boxes, &c.
Cut the Gutta Percha sheet as exact as possible to the size of the sides, ends, and bottom of your Cistern. Secure the
pieces temporarily inside with wooden battens placed across. Then take some round Gutta Percha band an inch in
diameter or a strip of sheet, say 2 inches broad, and 4 inch thick* soften it in hot watci diy it, and then slightly wipe
it over with a rag or small piece of sponge dipped in naphtha, to make the surface perfectly clean. Have a warm iron
ready, pass it over the joints to soften them, and then press the strip or band into them with it; after which carefully close
up and flatten. A secure joint may thus be effected.
N.B.—The sheeting should not be less than 5-32 in thickness. Sheeting for the bottoms of Cisterns may be had from
the Gutta Percha Company, ready joined up to any size required.
Emigrants’ boxes are lined in the same manner, using lighter band for the joints, according to the size of the box to he
lined.
A Square Yard of Sheeting, l-32nd thick, (suitable for lining Boxes) weighs about Ig lbs.
A ditto ditto ditto l-16th ditto, (for larger Boxes) ditto „ 3 lbs.

Directions for joining Patent Gutta Percha Driving Bands.
Out the ends of the band obliquely at an angle of 30 or 40 degrees, making the band rather shorter than the length
required. Secure one end to a board or bench by a clamp or a couple of nails, as s hewn in the annexed cut. Having
heated a piece of iron (say one inch broad and half an inch thick), to the temperaturq of a laundress smoothing-iron, so
that it will soften the Gutta Percha without burning or discolouring it, place the iron between the cut edges of the band,
pressing them against it (keeping the band always in a straight direction) until the edges are boronghly softened and m
a sticky state ; then remove the iron, and press the two edges together as closely as possible, alter which a couple of nails
may be driven into the loose end of the band, to keep it in its place. The ridge or burr may be pressed down as much as
possible into the substance of the band, by a heavy weight, or by means of a clamp so as to make a smooth joint. A
band of ordinary thickness will be ready for use in ten or fifteen minutes, or sooner, if cold water be applied.
Flat Joints may be made in like manner, by shaving down the ends a little, (so as, when laid one on the other, not
to be much thicker than the band,) heating the surface of the splices, and pressing them together by a weight or clamp.
Avoid heating the band throughout . Pare the edges when cold.
CROSS BANDS—Must be separated by a Roller , or fixed round an Iron Bar, if there be much fnotion
or rapid motion .
