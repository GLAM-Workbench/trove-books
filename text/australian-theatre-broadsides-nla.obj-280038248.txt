If you want to buy jewellery, always go to a
jeweller, tobacco to a tobacconist, a pair of
pants to a tailor ; in fact, whatever you wish to
get your money’s value for, go to the man who
understands the business ; but if you are in
search of a good hat, there is only one place in
town, and that is MURDOCH’S, in Park Street.

“I cannot account for it,” said the
doctor, " but this is a severe case of vial
de mer .” “I know it, doctor,” said the sick
man, "it is all caused by the soprano in
the next flat practising on the high C’s.
Servant—“ There’s no coal,, and the
fires are going out.” Mistress—“ Dear
me! Why didn’t you tell me before ?’”
Servant —" I couldn’t tell you there was
no coal, mum, when there was coal.”
He (the eligible one) —“ Your friend is
charmingly pretty ; don’t you think so ?”
She (with an eye to the main chance) —
• "Oh ! yes, indeed ! All the woman of
her family are nice-looking while young.
She —“ It must be terrible for a man
when he is married to have to ask his wife
for money.” He—“ There is something
far worse.” She—“ What, is that?” He
—•“ Suppose she hasn’t any to give him ?”
“I’ll woo thee in the moonlight,” sang
the lover to his girl, who was gazing fondly
on him from the casement ; “ It’s much
cheaper than the gaslight,” sang her
father, the old churl, who was taking
observations from the basement.
“ There she lay,” says the sensational
writer, “ there on the floor, breathing out
her life in short pants.” She must have
been a lady bicyclist in up-to-date garb.
Mamie—“ I believe in woman’s rights.”
Gertie —“ Then you think every woman
should have a vote ?” Mamie—“ No, but
I think every woman should have a voter.”

“ Now, doctor, tell me, without fear>
what is the matter with my husband ?”
" Well, I’m rather puzzled —does your
husband drink ?” “ Drink ! Why, no,
doctor. I’m sure he doesn’t drink, because
he’s always so thirsty in the morning.”
“ How’s the old woman going on !*
"Oh, all right, thank’ee.” " Let’s see
you had twelve before, didn’t you ?’
“ Yes.” “ Thirteen’s an unlucky number
y’know.” “ Ah, but the missus is a bit
superstitious, so it’s twins !”
Husband—“ Why are you always look-
inginto the glass,madam? I declare- ”
Wife —“ Sir, I look into the glass to im-
prove my appearance; those you look
into degrade yours.”
Paterfamilias —“ Maria, how does it
happen that Gladys isn’t going to church
with you this afternoon ?” Materfamilias
—“ There isn’t room for four pairs of
sleeves in our pew.”
“ Are you married p” said the manager
to a man who was looking for a situation.
“ No, sir.” “ Then I can’t employ you.
We find that married men know better
how to obey than bachelors.”
Fall many a stock, though varied,choice
and clean,
Now fills its anxious owner with des-
pair ;
For many a bargain’s doomed to go
unseen
Because the public does not know
it's there.
Giles —“ What did Cora give you for
your birthday ?’’ Merritt—" That’s a
mystery I’ve tried hard in vain to solve. As
she made it herself I don’t know whether
it’s a pin-cushion or a tobacco-pouch, but
at present I’m using it for a penwiper.

A Scottish minister recently asked an
old lady of his congregation whether she
liked the preaching of a neighbouring
clergyman as well as his own. To this
the old lady replied, “ No ava, meenister,
no ava ; man, I understood every word
he said. O, man, he canna bamboozle an’
confoond the judgment like you.”
“It is now a standing rule in my
church,' - '' said one clergyman to another,
“for the sexton to wake up any man he
sees asleep.” “ I think,” replied the other,
“that it would bo better for the sexton,
whenever a man goes to sleep under your
preaching, to wake you up.”
Leigh Hunt was among the last sur-
vivors of the good old Cockney school ;
of the men to whom the very name, the
“ town,” still had a certain magical charm.
He knew Charles Lamb and Hazlitt and
old Godwin, who inherited Johnson’s
enthusiasm for London and the “ full
tide of human existence” that poured
through Charing Cross; who agreed
with the Westmoreland baronet in pre-
ferring the smell of the flambeaux at a
playhouse door to the country odours of
Grasmere; to whom Drury-lane and
Covent Garden were the great centres of
all enjoyment; who loved London, in
short, as Balzac loved Paris, and played
their parts contentedly in the great
“ human comedy;” of which its streets are
the theatre. —Pall Mall Gazette.

and then the hoot of the owl. After these
the panther and the jackal. The donkey
can be heard fifty times as far as the horse,
and the cat ten times as far as the dog.
Strange as it may seem, the cry of the
hare can be heard further than that of
eirdu r the dog or cat.

Dr. WAUGH’S BAKING POWDER Beats all the Rest.
Figg—“lt’s all nonsense for girls to
spend so much time and money learning
to play the piano. Before we were mar-
ried my wife used to be eternally practising,
but she hasn’t touched the piano half-a-
dozen times since.” Fogg —“ And yet
they say marriage is a failure.”
“ I don't see,’ ‘said Mr. Maguire, as he
sat in the stern of the vessel, “ how the
captain can find his way across the ocean.
If he were going the other way all he’d
have to do would be to follow that white
streak behind there, but in front there’s
nothing to point the way.”
“ Doctor, I have an important physiolo-
gical question <o ask you. When I stand
on my head the blood rushes into my
head. Now, when I stand on my feet,
why does it not. rush into my feet?”
“ Because your feet are not hollow.”
The Romans believed the roots of Rosa It is claimed that there are fifty-five

teen persons out of every hundred com-
mitted on the charge of murder are
executed.
He —“ My views on bringing up a
family ” She—“ Never mind your
views. Fll bring up the family. You
go and bring up the coal.”
“No, George,” said the mature but
still lovely maiden to her youthful
adorer. “ I can never be anything more
than a mother to you. Your father
spoke first.”
Hardy Upton (borrowing a fiver) —
“ Words can never repay this kindness,
old man.” Cumso—“ No ; I don’t think
they can.”
Don’t worry yourself trying to make ends
meet, just shop at ANTHON £ HORDERN’S,
and they will not only meet, but leave a bit
for the bank.
The Curate —“ You should always be
particular about details, Miss Tucker. It
is little things that tell.” Nellie—“ I
know that. I have three small sisters.”
Tom—“ If you tad tte privilege of
kissing a pretty girl on tte rigtt or left
cteek, wtict would you ctoose ?” Dick
—“ It would be tard to make a choice,
but between tte two I should probably
find a way out of the dilemma.”
Horrible Punishment.— Mrs. Wick
wire—“ They say that the words we hare
spoken in life go on echoing through
space for ever. What do you think of
it ?” Mr. Wickwire —“ Great Scott! I’ll
just bet that is the way future punish-
ment is meted out. I’ll be compelled to
travel through space and catch up with
all the foolish things 1 said to you when
I was courting, and be forced to listen
to them all again.”
Landlady (trying to start the conver-
sation) —“Are yon fond of the antique,
Mr. Slim ?” New Boarder (suspiciously)
—“ Um—er —not at table.”
Winks—“ I understand that you have
lost your heart since you have seen the
beautiful Miss Bjones.” Binks —“ No,
sir. On the contrary, I have found it.”
GOLDEN OPINIONS.
I mark thro’ Sunny New South Wales,

In the East it is customary to cut the
eyelashes of female children while They are

Dr. SIDNEY C4IBBONS, Melbourne-Says: “It is the only food we can
depend on as a meat substitute.”
“One pound of Qranuma has more nutritious value than ithree pounds
of lean beef and mutton. It is a model food for childhood and youth. The
food of growth, purity and beauty—in one word—health.”—Dr. T. L. NICHOLS,

Therehasbeen discoveredin Nicaragua,
a flesh-eating, or rather, man-eating plant,
which is called by the natives “ the
devil’s snare.” In form it is a kind of
vegetable octopus, or devil-fisb, and it is
able to draw blood of any living thing
which comes within its clutches. The
natives show the greatest horror of the
plant, and recount many stories of its
death-dealing powers. Its power of suc-
tion is contained in a number of infinite-
simal mouths or little suckers, which,
ordinarily closed, open for the reception
of food. A lump of raw meat being
thrown in, in a short space of five min-
utes, the blood will be thoroughly drunk
off, and the mass thrown aside. Its
voracity is almost beyond belief.

“ Lady Audley’s Secret,” was published
in 1862.

The first great boxing matches were
instituted 617 8.G., by Lucius Tarquiuius,
the fifth King of Rome. They were varied

The present year, 1896, is a leap year;
such a year will not occur again for
eight years. This arises from the year
1900 having "been specially excluded by
Pope Gregory, together with 1700 and

calendar three genuine leap years had to
he deprived of their rights. The years
selected were those of the centuries
which were not divisible without re-
mainder by 400.
