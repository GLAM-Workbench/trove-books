THE IMPROVED AMERICAN
SOIEITTIFIO SYSTEM
||fess Jutting 8j ||p v ess jotting.
Description of System.
The instruments required in this system are three, viz., the Square Measure, the
Neck and Arm Curve, and the Sleeve Scale, and for their use reference must be had
to the Book of Instructions. In the following Notes: Ist, Square Measure is the side
extending from 1 to 24 inches ; 2nd, Short Measure is its lesser side at Right Angles
with the greater, and extending from 1 to 18 inches ; 3 is the extreme point at which
the 24th inch is found ; 4 is the Curved point at the top of Square Measure ; and
sis the Double Point at which the Inches commence. The Measure given on the
Square must be thoroughly understood and practised before any other step can be
taken.
How to Draw the Back.
A. The measure must be placed level with the edge of the paper, then mark in
the holes 1,2, 3 ; move measure back, and draw a line over marks made the whole
length of the measure.
B. The measure must now be turned round square with line 1, and then draw
line 2 (as in diagram) ; also make a mark on line 1, exactly a quarter of an inch
down from line 2, and place another mark on line 1 three and three-quarter inches
from line 2.
C. Now draw lines 3 and 4 (as in diagram), keeping your measure square
with line 1 from marks previously made ; now place the exact length of back on
line 3, keeping the measure straight with line 1, then make a mark, then draw
line 5.
D. Now refer to Table for width of Back Waist, then make a mark on line 5
half an inch inside from line 1, then another mark one-third of Back Waist, and
another three inches beyond, then another, the remaining two-thirds for the side
form ; make a mark on line 1 above waist line the length of the under arm-measure a
E. Now draw from mark last made, line 6, the bust line (as in diagram), at the
same time making a mark at back bust measure, then make a mark three inches
beyond.
F. On the Neck Shape will be found a Star, which must be placed at junction of
lines 1 and 3 ; the number of the back neck measure must then be made to fall on
line 2, and then draw the curve, line 7 (as in diagram).


G. Now the double point of measure is placed at junction of lines 7 and 2, figure
7 just meeting line 4, and the line must be drawn half an inch longer than the
measure of the shoulder.
H. Line 9 is drawn from outer mark on line 5 to outer mark on line 6.
I. Two-thirds of line 10 are drawn with arm curve from point of shoulder to first
Bust mark ; place double point of measure square with line 1, just touching line 10 ;
make a mark three inches beyond ; then finish line 10 with curve from mark last
mentioned to junction of 9 and 6.
K. Both lines 11 are drawn with Arm Curve from lines 10 to lines 5.
L. A mark must now be made below line 5 double the width of Waist line on
line 1 ; move the measure towards you half an inch, and make a mark at double
point. From last mark make another half an inch less than waist line, then another
half an inch less than double the length of waist line with three inches added. Now
draw line 12 from half inch mark at waist to angles of lines 6 and 1, and line 13 from
half inch mark at waist to outside mark below.
M. Lines 14 and 15 are drawn from waist line to marks made below (as in
diagram). Curve on Square is used for drawing line 15.
How to Draw the Front.
A. Lines 1 and 2 are drawn same as in Back ; make a mark on line 1 two and a
half inches from line 2, and from this mark draw line 3 square with line 1 (as in
diagram).
B. Make a mark on line 1 at half the measure of the arm size from line 3 ; and
from this mark draw line 4. The length of Back Bust measure is now placed on the
junction of lines 1 and 4, and a mark is made at the half of the whole bust measure,
and another mark is made three inches beyond.
C. Make a mark on line 1 at the distance of the under arm length from line 4 ;
from this mark draw square with line 1 line 5.
D. Line 6 is drawn square down from line 3, passing through outer bust mark on
line 4. Place the Star of Neck Curve at junction of lines 1 and 2, keeping the
measure straight with line 1, and make a mark at neck measure.
E. Now move the Star to mark just made, allowing the neck measure on curve
to meet line 2, then draw curve line 7 (as in diagram).
F. Place double point of measure at junction of neck line 7 and 2, allowing
figure 7 to meet on line 3 ; then draw line 8 to exact shoulder length.
G. Refer to measure taken for front length ; for example, front length, ;
then deduct the measure in Back Neck, which, for example, is H inches, thus leaving
18 inches : this amount is placed on the top of neck line 7, the double point of
measure just touching line 1 ; then make a mark, placing now the double point of
measure on this mark, allowing the long measure to cross line 5 (about half an inch
up on line G).
H. Then make a mark just one-and-three-quarter inches from line 1 ; this is for
space to the first Pleat (refer to Tables for size of Pleats) ; then make a second
mark for size of Pleat, now another mark 1 inch for space between the Pleats,
another mark for second Pleat (which is same size as first).
I. Measure space from last mark and line G and deduct 3 inches, then at half
the remaining measure make a mark from the outside of second Pleat, then make a
mark on same line 3 inches towards line 6 ; now draw both lines 9 square from line 3
and parallel with line G, passing through marks just made.


K. Draw a line square down from point of shoulder to bust line (4), then make
a mark on said line one inch up, and a mark three-quarters of an inch inside the
point of shoulder ; then draw curve line 10 from point of shoulder to last mark made.
L. Make a mark on both lines 9, just a quarter of an inch below line 4, then
continue curve to first mark.
M. Measure line 9 in back drawing for length, and make a mark on line 6
the same distance up from the waist line 5, then continue curve to quarter inch mark
under line 4 (as in diagram).
U, Short arm of measure is now placed square with line 1, allowing the long
measure to just meet curve line 10 ; now make a mark on line 1 at two inches and a
mark at four inches. Line 11 is then drawn from two inch mark to second line 9 ;
line 12 is then drawn from four inch mark on line 1 to the corner of lines 11 and first
line 9.
0. Line 13 is now drawn from the mark near line 5 on line 1 to corner of
5 and 9.
P. Make a cross in the centre of each large pleat, and a mark quarter of an
inch inside first line 9 towards line 1, and another mark quarter of an inch inside
second line 9 towards line 6, then draw lines 14, 15, 16, 17 from said marks (as in
diagram).
Q. With curve point oi measure draw lines 18, 19, 20, 21 (as in diagram) ; before
drawing lines 22 and 23 make a mark six inches below waist line on line 9, and a
mark three-quarters of an inch each side of lines 9 (in space between line .)).
R. Lines 22 and 23 are drawn from quarter inch marks on line sto marks between
lines 9 below line 5. These lines are drawn with curve on long measure, commencing
about two inches down the curve. Both lines must cross lines 9 below waist.
S. For line 24 make a mark three inches down on line 6 from line 5, and one
and a quarter inches out from line 6; then draw line 24 with curve point of long
measure, so that it will cross over last mark made.
T. Lines 25, 26, 27, 28 should be drawn to meet twelve inches below waist line.
JY.B. —Between the Front and Under Arm Form leave the space of three inches*
See that you have the same distance between both lines 9 as the number of inches the
bust mark dot has been extended, which will allow for spring on hips. Large figures
can have more space allowed in the back. The space allowed is sufficient foi any lady
in front.
For Drawing Coats.
Draw back exactly as instructed for a dress, except that, to secure the requisite
freedom, place a mark on line 5 three-quarters of an inch beyond line 10, and from
this mark draw lines to the junction of lines 6 and 9 ; and from the same mark draw
a line so that it will meet the dress line 15 twelve inches below the waist.
Draw Front Bust three-quarters of an inch larger than for a dress, and on line 5
three-quarters of an inch beyond line 6 ; make a mark, from which draw a line to
meet line 6at the junction of curve line 10. If one pleat preferred instead of two,
let both be put into one ; deduct half an inch from width of this pleat, and add half
an inch to smaller pleat. The large pleat is placed midway between lines 9 and 1.
Practising Measure for Sleeve.
Length, 22; Cross Wrist, 9 ; Cross Top, 13 ; Elbow, 12.
Refer to measure for size of sleeve. A mark is then made in the holes which
correspond at the upper and lower end of sleeve curve. A line is then drawn with
curve to said marks, then draw a line for wrist one inch more than half of measure


taken for wrist. A mark is now made for width of the upper end one-and-a-half
inches more than the half width measure at top ; on the mark made at wrist place the
number of Sleeve length, then draw with the outer curve a line passing over mark
made for width to the number required for length. Top Curve on sleeve is to be used
for drawing the upper end of sleeve ; if fullness is required, make a mark two inches
above upper end of Sleeve, and Draw Curve to said mark.
How to Prove your Drawing.
First take measure of Back Waist, and continue to first Pleat in front, and then
to space in centre, and from outside second Pleat to quarter-inch dot inside line 9 ;
also continue measure to width of side form ; if you have the number of half of the
waist measure your drawing is correct.
How to Trace and Cut Back and Front.
The Front must be traced and cut first. Your pattern must be pinned to the
lining, then trace waist line 13 with a tracing wheel; lines IG, 10, 8,7, 1, 14, 15, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, “Under Arm Form” line 5, or waist line 17, 23, G
and 24 ; line 10, 6to 9 ; Side back line 5-(or waist line), 11, 9, 10, 14, 15 ; then
cut this out.
Middle Back.—Lines 5, 11, 12 to neck, 8,7, 10, 13, 14, then cut this
out. Allow turnings everywhere except on the neck and arm hole. Be careful that
line 8 does not cross line 3 in front drawing, neither should line 8 cross line 4 in back,
unless the shoulder measures more than seven inches ; in that case the half inch is
placed on the line and in front drawn to exact measure of the shoulder.
How to take Measures.
1. In this system the measure of the “ Neck” is taken tight.
2. “ Arm Size” should be taken as tight as possible at a distance of an inch
from the shoulder point.
3. “ Bust,”—The measure is placed round the bust, allowing the first and
second finger to pass freely between measure' and front of bust.
4. Now tie a small cord round the waist ; then take measure of waist tight
5. Front Length measure is taken from prominent bone in back of neck over
shoulder to cord in front at waist.
G. Back Length from last bone mentioned to cord at back of waist.
7. “ Back Bust,” from just under the arm from right to left.
8. “ Under Arm Length,” from the hollow under the arm to cord at waist
9. “ Shoulder,” from neck to point of shoulder must be taken full length ;
shorter shoulder can always be had -by sloping the arm hole the height required.
10. Hips.—Measure round hips a distance of six inches from the waist; before you
commence to cut measure your drawings.
11. Sleeve.—Take measure of length of sleeve from point of shoulder to wrist,
witli hand resting on chest ; then measure round largest part of arm (loose) for size
of sleeve at top ; also measure for size required at wrist.
NB. —If for a tight sleeve, measure from the point of shoulder to elbow point.


Directions for Cutting a Polonaise.
Your lining must be traced same as for a dress. The front and under Arm Gore
is tacked on the material, letting them meet at a distance of about eight or nine
inches from the waist line ; the space is then cut out between them. Let the seam
run down a distance of nine inches from waist in sewing them together ; the back can
be cut the same way.
To Out a Princess Dress.
A. The lining must be traced out for the waist.
B. The front piece of your lining is tacked on the material.
C. Take measure from Waist down the Front the length of your skirt
measure.
D. Across the bottom of the material square a line
E. Measure down the opposite side, then tack the under arm gore lining on
your material, and measure down side next to front the length you made long side of
front piece; then square another line across bottom same as in front.
F, Measure down from the opposite side from waist to the square line.
G. Begin with side form next to back, your lining is tacked on the material the
length you made long side of last piece, measure down the short side, then square your
line as instructed before.
H. If cutting an ordinary House Dress, about two inches can be added to long
side of this piece.
I. The back is cut exactly the same as a dress,

For Cutting, Walking and Trained Skirts.
1. Take Waist and Length measure. The size for Bodice Pleat must then be
found ; measure on the fold of material, half-an-inch beyond the exact length of
Skirt, allowing at top the half-inch for slope to first Pleat. Space must be half-an-
inch larger to first Pleat than the space in bodice to first Pleat.
2. The Pleat is made same size as Bodice Pleat. Leave same space as first
to half-Pleate, which consists of the small and large Pleats added together. The
front breadth is sloped down to width required at bottom from the inside of last
Pleat.
Side Gore. —Measure down selvage of material corresponding to long side of
front breadth, allowing corresponding half-Pleat at top. Make a Hip Pleat
double the size of front Pleat, which must be placed in the centre of space left.
After allowing three inches for gathers in back, measure down to the required
length of back to width required at bottom.


Back Width is cut on the selvage to the measure taken for Back, which is a per-
fectly straight piece of material and gathered into three inches at Band. The Pleats
are made about six inches below waist, which can be pleated or gathered.

For Cutting Train Skirts.
Train Skirts are cut the same as for a Walking Skirt, only making two Gores
instead of one, halving Hip Pleat and sloping down first Gore from centre of Hip
Pleat to two-thirds of the length required for Back. Measure down on selvage of
material, long side of first Gore ; then take off the half-Pleat at Waist and measure
down the opposite side to length required at Back.
How to Out the Skirt of a Dress
A. Trace your Pattern to drawing; continue down on material to length
required for Skirt measure, having your Front pattern pinned to the material ; cut
down same as first Gore in Skirt. Side Back is now pinned on the material and cut
down same as second Gore in Skirt. Pin Back on straight of material and cut same
as for a Skirt.
To Cut a Plastron Dressing or Tea Gown.
1. For a tight-fitting Gown draw same as for the Princess Dress—only draw the
Plastron in place of the Front Pleat; deduct about quarter-of-an-inch from the Back
Pleat.
2. The Plastron Pleat is drawn same as for children, and is also separated in
centre of shoulder and centre of Pleat—one inch space must be left ; three inches
spaces must be left between Front and under Arm Form. Make four inches further
out a second Bust mark, through which line 6 is drawn.

Pleat in front.
For Tracing Plastron Gown.
For the Front, trace Waist line 11 to lines 18 and 17 ; line 1 the whole length ;
line 7 to line 8 ; line 8 to line 12 ; lines 12, 18 and 17 ; trace next to Front
first Waist line from junction of lines 14 and 15 to lines 6 and 18, or lines beyond
6 and 18 ; next lines 8, 12, 14, 15 lines to 10, 6 and 18 ; should lines be drawn
beyond 0 and 18 trace them in place of the ordinary ones. Trace Back the same as
a Bodice. If for children, have the material folded before tracing Front.

Fitting.
When a textile material lias been accurately and scientifically cut into the various
parts which go to compose an article of apparel, not much more than half the work
of producing a graceful and comfortable garment has been done. It remains to adjust
and combine the various parts with accuracy and judicious skill—a matter scarcely, if
at all, inferior to the cutting itself. It is true it will always be impossible to fit into
a graceful and becoming dress material that has been inaccurately or unskilfully cut :
but even well-cut material may be altogether spoiled as a dress by unskilful fitting, so
that good dressmakers are accustomed to say that a garment properly <l tacked” is
half made. The rest is mere sewing ; just as a statuary, having prepared his model
and lined it out, will commit the actual chiselling to any man who can use a chisel and
mallet with moderate judgment and skill.
In the course of lessons we give such ample hints and instructions as will enable
any sempstress, having once mastered our system, to complete her work of perfectly
fitting the dress to the figure and purpose for which it is designed.
William Inglis & Co., Printers, 37 and 38 Flinders St. East, Melbourne.
