A YOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA,
A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
PART I.
THE VOYAGE Tp AUSTRALIA.
This little manual upon the Gold Regions of Australia has been
written for the purpose of placing before the public and intending
emigrants a faithful delineation of the country and the state of
society, and also to give practical information upon a subject
which at the present time is engrossing the attention of a vast
class of persons in this country, whose ideas and information
appear to be extremely vague. Our only object, therefore, is to
give a plain, unvarnished tale; leaving the intending emigrant to
judge what are his chances of success in the land of gold.
In order to convey the most accurate idea of the subject, we
propose to embark for our voyage to Australia. As we proceed
upon the voyage from England we shall stop at the most
interesting places where it is usual for vessels to touch, and shall
give a general idea of the voyage out?starting from Plymouth
Sound. J
Around the entire coast of England there is no view more
picturesque than that from Plymouth Sound. The town lying at
the entrance of the bay; the magnificent wood covering the sides
of the hill and height above; the noble breakwater and lighthouse;


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AXD
the fleet of fishing craft; and the general stir and animation of
the scene, all contribute deeply to interest those who are, perhaps,
gazing upon their native shores for the last time.
When in a far-distant land how vividly will this scene be
impressed upon the mind of the emigrant; well will he remember
the farewell shouts, answered from the ship ; the rush to the
vessel?s side; the waving of handkerchiefs; the firing of the
guns, as he sails from the beautiful bay of Mount Edgecumbe,
We now leave Plymouth Sound, and shall suppose ourselves
fairly upon our voyage to Australia, ?a distance of 16,000
miles; but one of the most safe and pleasant of passages.
During the voyage we will introduce most of the usual
occurrences and effects, both as regards the latitude we enter
and the general incidents to he met with on a passage out.
Soon after leaving Plymouth the vessel passes close to the
far-famed Eddystone Lighthouse?one of the most wonderful
of human constructions. It was erected in 1759 by the cele-
brated Smeaton. At this part of our voyage we frequently meet
with vessels; and many a home-bound Indiaman, or merchantman,
may be seen beating up the channel, just reaching home after a
voyage of six or eight months. We soon leave the English
channel, and come to the Bay of Biscay, where the long rolling
waves of the Atlantic tell us that we are fairly on our voyage;
for rarely does a vessel sail across the well-known bay without
experiencing in earnest the perils of the vast deep. Here the
voyager from England frequently sees for the first time the little
sea-bird, the stormy petrel, called by sailors ? Mother Carey?s
chicken.? These are very singular birds, always following in
the wake of, ships in search of food ; they are so strong of wing
that the same bird has been known to keep up with a fast-sailing
vessel for many days and nights in succession.
We now approach warmer latitudes, and after some few days
arrive off the
island op Madeira;
and as vessels frequently touch here for water we will make a
short stay, in order to give you some account of the island, and






A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
its principal town or city of Funchall. It is a most beautiful
and picturesque place, and is the capital of the island, which is so
celebrated for the salubrity of its climate : it is situated in the
Atlantic Ocean, 16 deg. W. lon., and between 32 deg. and 30 deg,
N. lat. The island is about 55 miles long, and about 10 miles
broad. The governor is at the head of all the civil and military
departments of this and the cluster of islands in its vicinity,
which are called the Madeiras, from the largest. The population
of Madeira amounts to 60 or 70,000; the weather is in general
mild and temperate, and is on this account much frequented by
invalids. The landed property is in the hands of a few ancient
families, who live principally at Funchall. Madeira consists of
one large mountain, whose branches rise everywhere from the
sea towards the centre of the island, in the midst of which is a
depression or excavation, called by the inhabitants the Yal,
which is always covered with a fresh and delicate herbage.
The vines that produce the celebrated wine which takes its
name from this country grow at some distance up the mountain.
Nearly the whole trade of the island depends on the vine-harvest,
and this year, we are sorry to say, is likely to prove most disas-
trous to the growers, as a blight seems to have attacked the
grapes. All the common domestic animals of Europe are to be
found here; but the wild birds are more numerous than the
quadrupeds. The gardens produce peaches, apricots, quinces,
apples, pears, wallnuts, chesnuts, and also some tropical plants,
such as the bananas and pine-apples.
We will now proceed upon our voyage, and the first thing
that attracts our attention is one of the most remarkable objects
in natural history?the flying fish?which are often seen here-
abouts, pursued by their deadly enemies the sea-gulls. We now
approach the
PEAK OP TENERIFPE,
Tenneriffe is an Island of Africa, one of the Canaries, being
the most considerable for riches, trade, and extent. The famous
Peak may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 120 miles.


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AND
Dolphins in chase are often seen sporting upon the water,
and on a beautiful evening at sunset offer a most pleasing picture
to the voyager as he hangs over the vessel?s side.
We now enter the southern hemisphere, and soon being to
notice the change in the heavens. The Great and Little Bear,
together with Orion?s belt and those constellations with which
Ave are so familiar in the northern hemisphere, are no longer
visible, and in their place we have a multitude of stars, con-
spicuous among which shines the Southern Cross,
We soon reach
RIO JANEIRO,
where vessels to Australia occasionally call. Rio Janeiro is
a province of Brazil in South America, situated between the
tropic of Capricorn and 22 deg. S. latitude. It is the most
valuable province the Portuguese are masters of; they import
yearly great quantities of gold, diamond dust, and precious
stones, which are found in the mountains in prodigious quantities.
The Brazils was formerly a colony of Portugal; but on the
invasion of that country by Napoleon Bonaparte the royal family
and court fled to Brazil under British protection, and on the
restoration of peace it became independent under the title of the
Empire of Brazil; Don Pedro, son of Ferdinand VIL, being
first Emperor. Some thousands of miles further south, driven
by the trade winds, the next spot of land the voyager beholds is
THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.
This is a very remarkable eminence, and may in clear weather
be discovered at a considerable distance. From its appearance it is
called the table-mountain, as it terminates in a flat horizontal
surface. In fine summer-weather, which commences in September
and continues till March, this table-land, or mountain, is sometimes
suddenly capped with a white cloud, often called the spread-
ing of the table-cloth. When this cloud seems to roll down the
steep face of the mountain, it is a sure indication of an approach-
ing gale from the south-east, which generally blows with great




.

A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
violence. The ships in Table Bay on the first approach of this
cloud prepare for a gale by striking yards and top-masts. A
little to the west, on the right-hand side of Table Bay, is a round
hill called the Sugar Loaf, and by some the Lion?s Head, as, upon
taking a general view of the whole, it strongly resembles that
animal with its head erect.
The Cape of Good Hope was formerly a Dutch settlement,
but was taken from them by the British in 1806.
Cape Town is extensive and well built, with spacious streets in-
tersecting each other at right angles. The houses are built of stone.
The only landing-place is at the east end of the town, where
there is a quay running some distance into the sea, with cranes
for loading and unloading the vessels that come alongside. Ex-
cellent water is conveyed by pipes to this place, which makes the
watering of ships both easy and expeditious. The principal
fortress is the castle, a strong and extensive work, with good
accommodation for troops. The fort covers and defends the east
part of the town and harbour, and is admirably planned and cal-
culated to harass and annoy ships coming into the bay; smaller
fortifications extend east and west along the coast. The gover-
nor?s house is delightfully situated in the centre of extensive
gardens. The Cape has been brought much before us of late,
as the seat of the protracted and harassing war with the native
Kaffirs, who for a long time have greatly annoyed and disturbed
the peace of the surrounding country.
After passing the Cape, the vessel is usually blown before
the gale at a much quicker rate than before; this is of great
service in expediting the passage, and there is no danger to be
apprehended. Among the marine birds, we now often see the
albatross.
The ship soon reaches the Whale Fishing Grounds ; and we
will briefly describe the mode in which whales are captured. Each
whale-ship is provided with six boats, to each of which belong six
men to row the boat, and one as a harpooner, whose business it
is to strike the whale; two boats keep constantly on the watch
at some distance from the ship, which arc relieved by others


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AND
every four hours. As soon as a whale is observed, both boats set
out in pursuit of it, and if either of them come up before the
whale finally descends (which is known by throwing up his tail),
it commences the attack. As soon as the whale is struck, the
men set up one of their oars in the middle of the boat as a signal
to those in the ship, and all the other boats are immediately sent
out to their assistance. The whale, finding himself wounded,
runs off with prodigious velocity; sometimes he descends per-
pendicularly, at others he goes off horizontally at a small depth
below the surface; the rope which is fastened to the harpoon is
about 200 fathoms long, and properly coiled up. The velocity
with which the line runs over the boat at first is so great that it
is wetted to prevent its taking fire. The whale cannot, when
wounded, stay long below water, but again comes up to blow ;
this gives another boat time to come up with him, and he is
again struck with a harpoon. The whale, after one or two
descents, is rendered incapable of again descending, and is then
killed with long lances which the men are provided with. He is
known to be near death when he spouts up water tinged with
blood. When dead, he is lashed alongside the ship, ropes
being placed round the head and near the tail, which, together
with the fins, is struck off as soon as he is taken, in order to keep
them above water. It is scarcely necessary to advert to the
advantages derived by Great Britain from the whale fishery;
the Legislature, justly considering the trade as of great national
importance, have bestowed upon it at different periods very con-
siderable encouragement. The whale caught in the South Seas
is called the Sperm Whale.
The Island of St. Paul is generally seen on the passage, near
which is also the Island of Amsterdam; they are of volcanic
formation. The Island of St. Paul, like the Island of Ascension,
is noted for turtles.
We are now nearing the Australian coast. The approach
to land is frequently indicated by floating trees and sea-weed,
and often little land birds will fly out to greet the new comers on
their arrival upon its shores. The first point of land usually seen


A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
is Cape Otway. All is now alive on board ship?smiles are on
every face?and soon the vessel glides into the bay of Port
Phillip, and the voyagers once more set foot on terra firma.
Having arrived at the termination of our voyage, we
will suppose that you have gone through the anxiety and
bustle of landing, which has been accomplished during the
night, and that you are now safe upon the shore of your new
home, which, although it is distant 16,000 miles from Great
Britain, you will find in general appearance and manners
thoroughly English.


PART 11.
A VISIT TO THE GOLD REGIONS,
PORT PHILLIP BAY AND THE TOWN OP MELBOURNE.
Melbourne, the capital of the district, is situated on the river
Yarra Yarra, about eight miles from William?s Town, which is
the place of anchorage for large vessels. Melbourne is 590
miles from Sydney, and was founded in 1837 by Sir Richard
Bourke. The town is built on a gently rising ground, in a
fertile valley; it extends upwards of a mile along the banks of
the river. The streets are laid out at right angles, and are upon
a very large scale. Although only fifteen years have elapsed
since the foundation of the city, it has long since outgrown its
former boundaries, the whole of the original space having been
covered with wharves, shops, offices, and elegant private dwellings.
A short time ago the busy population numbered 23,000, but at
the present time the town is comparatively empty, nearly all its
inhabitants have gone to the gold fields.
The public buildings are highly creditable to the community,
which has sprung up with almost magic rapidity. The Prince?s
Bridge spans the Yarra Yarra by a single arch of 150 feet; it
was erected by a public company at a cost of �15,000 ; it is
built of stone of a hard and durable texture, and forms a most
conspicuous object of the city. There are two handsome churches,
St. Peter?s and St. James?s, and a third erecting. The Roman


A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
Catholics have a cathedral called St. Francis Xavier. The
Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Independents, Baptists, Quakers, and
Jews, have also their respective places of worship. There are
also two elegant Banking Houses; a Theatre, well worthy of its
patrons; Hospitals, Mechanics? Institutes, Horse Bazaar, and
other public buildings, upon an extensive scale. The houses are
partly brick, some stuccoed, and there are a few handsome
buildings of granite that would be considered an ornament to any
European city. There are many houses at present unfinished for
want of workmen, owing to the attraction of the neighbouring
gold mines. Educational institutions are numerous, the first in
rank is Port Phillip College. The churches and chapels have
Sunday-schools attached to them; and four or five daily and
weekly newspapers were published here, but the want of hands
through the gold mania has reduced this number for the present.
Public institutions of all kinds exist; Bible Societies, Mercan-
tile Associations for supporting the commerce and interests of
the Colony, Cricket Clubs, and others. The government of
Melbourne is vested in a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve town
councillors ; this city is also the seat of a bishopric. The first
discovery of gold at Melbourne occurred in August, 1851; on
the 25th of that month Lieut.-Governor Latrobe wrote from
Melbourne to Earl Grey that large deposits of gold had been
discovered in the colony ; the three localities where the gold was
first discovered were Clune?s Diggings, Ballarat, and at Deep
Creek, only sixteen miles from Melbourne, where the precious
metal was found in contact with slate rock. Gold was afterwards
dug up in the City of Melbourne itself.
We will now start from Melbourne in the direction of the
Australian Alps. We shall meet with herds of cattle being driven
into Melbourne from pasturage ; they are termed the town herds.
The objects which will next attract our notice will be Mount
Macedon and the Moony Ponds. Mount Macedon is part of the
mountain range in which the gold was discovered.
We shall notice many trees unknown in England, such as
the shea-oaks, the gum-trees, the grass-trees, and several others.


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AND
The peculiar manner in which the natives capture turkeys is
worthy of a passing notice ; having made themselves shields from
the branches and leaves of trees, they steal upon the birds,
unaware of their approach, and capture them by the legs.
On our way we pass through the valley of Heidelburg. The
drays used for the conveyance of avool, drawn by oxen, are very
picturesque. We may catch a glimpse of the winding of Yarra
Yarra, and observe an Elizabethan house in a park; it is the
residence of Mr. Hawden, one of the early overlanders from
Sydney; he was one of the first settlers in the Melbourne
district, and brought his cattle with him from Sydney. The
mountains seen in the distance are the range leading to the gold
fields.
The aborigines are still occasionally found in this part of the
country, inhabiting their gunyahs or huts, built of the bark of
trees. These natives are universally admitted to be the lowest
standard of the human race; it is found impossible to civilize
them to any extent; they are even more degraded now than
formerly ; not improving their condition from the virtues of the
white man, they have clung only to his vices, and give them-
selves up to intoxicating drinks and tobacco; but here, as in all
the other islands of the South Pacific, they are fast disappearing
with advancing civilization.
The most successful attempts at training them to European
habits has been made by the Government who organized some forty
of them into a mounted police for the protection of the squatters;
but even these men, notwithstanding the attraction of a horse
and fine clothes, are glad to throw off their accoutrements, to
have a day or two?s freedom in their own squalid mode of life,
and enjoy their most exciting pastime?a kangaroo hunt.
The river Goulburn will next attract our attention. Many
shepherds? huts are seen hereabouts, with thousands upon
thousands of sheep.
The chief staple of Australia is wool. The number of sheep
throughout the various provinces is not less than 20,000,000.
The wool produced is of the finest description, although the


A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
sheep are never housed or fed by artificial means, as in
Saxony, from which the finest descriptions of wool formerly
came. The extent of pasture-land is without limit for any amount
of population that can be placed upon it. The climate is all
that can be desired for the purpose, and in no country in the world
can so large an amount of produce he raised with so little trouble.
Yet this great staple is at the present time in danger from the
abandonment of pastoral pursuits for the gold diggings.
The squatter or settler in the interior, having first procured
from the Government a license for the run he has selected,
next erects a hut, which should always be near a supply of
water. There are many ways of forming these huts according
to circumstances and the skill of the builder ; logs, mud, bark,
and turf being used indiscriminately. The stock-yards are
next commenced ?bush-fencing being often used for sheep,
but strong log-fencing for cattle. A garden is the next thing
requisite, and then a few fields for the growth of wheat and
maize. All this having been done, the station is formed. Two
huts are requisite, one for the proprietor and one for the shep-
herds and men ; the most easily erected are those of bark ; one
that is 20 feet long, by 14 wide, will scarcely occupy more than
two days in building, and can be made water-proof. It is greatly
to be lamented that the present gold mania should in any way
interfere with the production of the wool, for there is no doubt
but that it will ultimately prove the real golden fleece of the
country.
The gold fields are situated immediately beyond the moun-
tains. Let us take a short cut to Mount Alexander, where the
greatest excitement has prevailed owing to the enormous masses
of gold that have been discovered; one man obtained upwards of
801bs. weight of gold in a single hour. In Victoria alone more
than ten tons of gold had been collected up to the 20th of
December last; the produce at Mount Alexander in one week
having exceeded 23,000 ounces. One escort brought from
Melbourne �50,000 in bank-notes to Mount Alexander in
exchange for gold. Note engravers and printers in the colony


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AND
are represented as not being able to make bank-notes fast
enough for the demand; and one bank actually borrowed notes
from a neighbouring colony.
In the beginning of February more than 20,000 persons
arrived at the Victoria mines from the neighbouring colonies :
the production of gold was consequently greater, the weekly
estimate being 20,000 ounces of the precious metal. Wages
rose to an almost fabulous sum; reapers could only be obtained
by a payment of 28s. a day and their food, and they worked
rather for the sake of saving the crops than for the amount of
wages; servants, when they condescended to remain as such,
demanded �6O a year and their food. From the impossibility
of getting men to attend to the flocks and herds, they are almost
unsaleable. Thus, whilst the gold-seekers are flourishing, the
agricultural and pastoral interests are sinking.
On the road to the diggings all kinds of conveyances are
seen; often an omnibus, taken out from this country to convey
a party to the mountains, and afterwards to be used as a house;
many have been taken out for the same purpose.
The infatuation that still prevails is truly astonishing : men are
throwing up first-rate situations they have held for years to join
the exciting game of gold-digging. Shops are closed from the
impossibility of procuring assistance ; the labour that is obtained
is paid for at an enormous rate. Gold is exerting a truly mag-
netic influence, drawing not only the male but also the female
population to the mountains. There are hundreds of females at
this moment at the diggings rocking cradles, not the domestic
article that wo all know so well, but the more cumbrous
implement of the digger. Thoughtful men are struck with
gloomy forebodings ; the bounteous gifts of heaven are slighted,
and man, in his eager scramble for gold, neglects the food that is
to sustain him in his toil.
Mount Alexander is so near to Melbourne, that it has had
a great effect upon the town: many large establishments, where
numerous hands are required to carry on the work, are closed.
Ships in the harbour are deserted; butchers and bakers are left

without journeymen, and many of the masters themselves have
started to the diggings, and for some time the town looked
quite deserted. Hundreds have returned with their golden
treasure, determined to enjoy themselves instead of working.
We will now return to the valley of the Goulburn, and pro-
ceed upon our journey to the Alps. Gold has been discovered
by prospecting parties to exist in this range of mountains for 300
miles.
But let us call at Port Phillip Bay, where our vessels
entered at the termination of our voyage from England, and
visit the rising
TOWN OF GEELONG,
which is the second town in the colony, and nearly equal in
importance to Melbourne; it is advantageously situated between
the Bay of Coria and the Barwen river. It is 45 miles from
Melbourne, and is a place of considerable trade, shipping from
its wharves the greater part of the wool of the colony.
The houses are well laid out and amply supplied with water.
The aspect of the country from the cleared rising ground, east of
the town, with the rich green of the forest and pasture land, relieved
by the deep blue sky and water, resembles the choicest Italian
scenery.
In the neighbourhood of Geelong are the Barrobull Hills.
This is the richest part of the country, with beautiful park-
like scenery, unlike the forest lands. Continuing onward we
proceed round the town, coming again to Coria Bay and
Station Peak Mountain. Coria Bay strongly resembles the Bay
of Naples, the mountains being in form like Vesuvius. The
Bosella parrots, with their beautiful plumage, are as common
here as our sparrows.
Let us now proceed to New South Wales, a distance of 600
miles; there is no particular interest in the coast-scenery until
we come to the Illawarra District, which is a most interesting
agricultural part, and the most beautiful and romantic in the
colony. It is a belt of land enclosed between the mountain and
the ocean, thickly wooded and of most exuberant fertility. Here


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AND
most of the tropical plants flourish, as well as all kinds of vegeta-
bles, including the remarkable cabbage-palm, for which this place
is noted. Here, too, is Tom Thumb?s Lagoon, where, on the
margin of the lake, Australian pelicans and black swans are
often seen. The lake being very shallow and clear, the natives,
by means of long spears which they dart into the fish suddenly,
are always able to capture them.
Kangaroos abound in this district. These interesting animals
are fast diminishing in numbers, and are now seldom seen in the
settled parts of the country. Their movements are very
peculiar; they spring forward sometimes from fifteen to twenty
feet at a time, and in this manner outstrip horses at full speed.
THE TOWN OF WOLLONGONG,
is on the sea-coast, about forty miles from Sydney, and is a
favourite retreat for invalids. It is situated in the Illawarra
district. A steamer plies regularly between this spot and
Sydney.
Let us now pass along the coast for forty miles, past
Botany Bay, where Captain Cook first landed, and led to
the occupation of the colony by the British. The Endeavour,
a barque of 300 tons, was equipped and heavily armed
for the purpose, and Captain Cook having been appointed
to command the vessel, several eminent men of science, aware
of his previous discoveries, applied for permission to accom-
pany the expedition; the most noted of these was Mr. Banks,
afterwards Sir Joseph Banks, a gentleman of fortune and
scientific research. On the 26th of August, 1709, the En-
deavour sailed out of Plymouth Harbour, and on the 19th of
April, in the year 1770, the first land of New Holland was des-
cried, and named by Captain Cook ? Point Hicks,? after the
first lieutenant who discovered it. Captain Cook did not touch
there, but proceeded to Botany Bay, so called from the large
number of plants collected there by the naturalists of the
expedition. Captain Cook, having landed, took possession and
hoisted the British colours.

A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
We have now come to the Harbour of Port Jackson, and,
landing' on the north side, again see the Town of Sydney, with
the Blue Mountains in the distance.
Shark?s Island, Clark?s Island, and Garden Island, lie in the
harbour. On the left are Point Piper, Wooloomoolo, Spire
of St. James?s Church, the Colonial Hospital, and the Govern-
ment House ; and, to the right of Garden Island, Fort Macquarie,
the Paramatta River, and the Blue Mountains lire seen in the
distance.
The Willoughby Falls is a very favourite spot, within two
miles of Sydney, and quite in a state of nature; it is greatly
resorted to by pic-nic parties, the solitude being in strong con-
trast with the opposite side, the bustle of the town of Sydney.
Let us now pay a visit to the Blue Mountains, up the Para-
matta river. We shall meet with the cattle in vast herds being
driven in from the Bush.
The Road over the Blue Mountains is very interesting;
flocks of emus, white and black cockatoos, and the ever-present
red parrots, frequently call for our attention. Continuing upon
the road we arrive at the Falls of the Weatherboard Hut, a
celebrated mountain scene. We are now about fifty or sixty
miles from the Diggings, in the heart of these mountains; but
as they are all of the same character, we will pass at once
to Summer Hill Creek, where the first gold was discovered.
This is a run of water between two ranges of hills. Its banks
are now daily lined with thousands of men, who work there
much harder than they ever before did in all their lives. The gold
is washed down from the sides of the rocks, and is found some-
times in large quantities close by the banks of the Avater, espe-
cially at a turn of the stream. Butchers? shops and refreshment
tents are numerous enough; there is no want of creature com-
forts where there is so much money to pay with, and the diggers
in general fare well enough. Near Summerhill Creek are the
celebrated Ophir Diggings. Here also thousands upon thousands
have arrived to pursue their voluntary labours. At night, when
their work is done, an encampment of gold diggers by moonlight


A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA.
is one of the most picturesque of scenes, and can only be likened
to the encampment of an army. The fires burn brightly, the
white tents glisten against the dark shadows of the mountains,
the men, women, and children congregate in clusters and share
their only quiet meal, and, though an occasional disturbance may
be heard, all accounts confirm the fact, that in all the large gold
fields the dwellers there are as orderly and well-behaved as the
inhabitants of towns.

The object of this Company is to send out Emigrants to Australia as independent
men, and not as objects of charity, and so to aid them that their earnings in the Colony,
after their arrival, shall be the fund out of which their passage thither is paid.
The plan of operations of this Company includes a passage to the Colony, and
maintenance on hoard, with provision for a month?s supply after the Emigrant?s
arrival ; also, one suit of working-clothes, and effective tools ; also, the first month?s
Government License to dig gold.
The Company?s Commissioners in the Colony will direct, guide, and convoy him
to the best gold fields, or obtain for him good employment if he wish to lead an agri-
cultural or pastoral life, or that of a mechanic, clerk, &c. In addition to which,
Emigrants going out under the protection of the Company will have the assistance of
their Commissioners on all occasions, who will bo ready to assay or purchase the
gold they collect at the full market price, and to give them, while working at the
Diggings and Mines, the use of the Company?s machinery, and improved tools,
amalgamators, &c., so as to save expense and increase the produce; and also to
provide tents, and make arrangements for security of property, and for the sale of
useful stores.
The entire plan of the Company is thus founded in mutual co-operation. The
Company will depend on the industry, honesty, and punctuality of the Emigrants,
to perform their engagements in return for the assistance thus given; and it will he
apparent that the important advantages from co-operation with the Company will
result in realizing them considerably more in amount than if working single-handed,
and without the advice and aid of the Company. It will be likewise certain that
Emigrants associated with this Company will be free from all anxiety on reaching
the Colony, and that the expense, fatigue, and privations of a strange land will be
entirely avoided.
Prospectuses, with the plan of operations, sent free on receipt of two postage
stamps, or every information may be obtained at the
TEMPORARY OFFICES OF THE COMPANY,
