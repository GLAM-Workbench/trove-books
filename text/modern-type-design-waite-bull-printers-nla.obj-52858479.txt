MODERN

DESIGN


FOREWORD
the following pages will be found a selection
of the most beautiful of modern type designs
.•C'» suitable for all classes of printed matter. HThe
purpose of this Specimen Book is to assist the users of
printing in the selection of the best faces. It is particu-
larly designed to aid the advertising profession in the
choice of types for conve}dng the sales message in the
most readable, most attractive, and most compelling
manner. ‘[Whatever excellence a piece of printing may
possess, whether it be the simplest dodger or the most
expensive book, the charm of its appearance is finally
determined by the character and beauty of the type.
*[lt is therefore of the utmost importance that appro-
priate types should be chosen for the work. WVhen the
selection is left to us, the job is composed by highly
skilled craftsmen. llThe material is all cast in our own
works, and is used for one printing only. !iNew type is
provided for each job. This ensures not only speed and
good printing, but in addition means a substantial saving
in cost. ‘As additional new faces become available,
specimen pages will be sent to you punched ready for
insertion in this book.

CORRECTED PROOF
Showing marked alterations made from previous page.
Good taste, a quality essential to the successful pro-
duction of all kinds of printing, is of great importance
in the typography of books. In the matter of good taste
most of us are specialists, we perfect our judgment in
some one respect and let it remain erratic in others. A
musician or other artist may stand high in his class and
yet, perhaps, show poor taste in dress and manners.
A person of good taste is usually conservative. He
weighs all new things in the balance of judgment, and
allows enthusiastic faddists to push him off the footpath
rather than join the crowd and shout with it. He knows
the fickleness of mobs and remembers that in a week
hosannas have been changed to shouts of bitter invective.
The merchant catering to the whims of fashion ever has
unsalable stock on his shelves. In the days of militant
Rome the crowd which one day cheered Sulla, the next
day crowned Marius with laurel.
The natural tendency of humanity is radical. The
conservatives are in the minority, yet their influence is
great because their opinions are generally based upon
sure foundations. Of course, a person can be progressive
and possess a present day mind without being either
radical or conservative. The natural tendency of job
printers is radical. Left much to their own whims and
fancies they produce printed things which may please
only for the moment. The test of gold is not in its
appearance when purchased, but in years of wear.
Because a job of printing is made for short service is no
reason why it should not be as well done as book
composition is required to be.

PRINTERS' TABLES


SCREEN RULINGS
SHOWING THE CORRECT HALF TONE SCREEN FOR
DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PAPER


PRINTING TRADE CUSTOMS
1. QUOTATIONS.
All prices are made for immediate acceptance. When estimates are based on
printed, typewritten, or other good copy, and the manuscript copy given is
poorly prepared, or in any material point is different from that originally sub-
mitted or described, then an extra charge shall be made for any additional work
or cost involved.
The printer’s written quotation shall be deemed to interpret correctly customer’s
instructions, whether written or verbal, and that customers be accordingly
advised to exercise due care in checking quotations.
Customer’s Verbal Instructions. —The printer shall not be held responsible
for errors or omissions due to oversight or misinterpretation of customer’s verbal
instructions.
2. DELIVERY.
Unless otherwise specified, the price quoted covers delivery to customer’s pre-
mises, if situated within a radius of to miles from the G.P.O. —otherwise, f.o.b.
or f.o.r. All quotations are based on continuous and uninterrupted delivery of
complete orders, unless original specifications distinctly state otherwise.
3. QUANTITY DELIVERED.
Every endeavor will be made to deliver the correct quantity ordered, but, owing
to the difficulty of producing exact quantities, estimates are conditional upon a
margin of 5 per cent, being allowed for overs or shortage, the same to be charged
for or deducted, pro rata,
4. CONTRACTS.
Every effort will be made to carry out any contract, but the due performance
of it is subject to variation or cancellation owing to an act of God, or war, or
strike, or lock-out, or fire, or any other cause beyond control, or owing to inability
to procure materials or articles except at enhanced prices due to any of the
foregoing.
5. ALTERATIONS OF STYLE.
Where the customer does not make a typographical style for a job, the printer
shall make a style for him, and charge, as corrections, all variations from that
style.
6. TABULATED WORK.
Any excess of tabulated work and foreign language included in the job, as com-
pared with the manuscript originally submitted for the purpose of estimating,
is chargeable as an extra.
7. OVER-RUNNING LINO.
All resetting involved in making author’s corrections, including the over-running
of slug-cast machine composition, shall be chargeable as an extra.
8. TYPE AND OTHER MATERIAL.
Unless otherwise agreed, the customer shall bear the cost of type or ornaments
specially bought at his request for his work.
(Continued on next Page)


9. PROOFS.
Proofs, not in excess of two, will be submitted with original copy. Corrections,
if any, shall be made thereon and be returned marked “0.K.” or “O.K. with
corrections,” and signed with name or initials of the customer or other person
on customer’s behalf. If revised proof is desired, request must be made when
first proof is returned. No responsibility for errors is assumed if work is printed
as per customer’s O.K. Unless otherwise agreed, all proofs shall be on proof
paper. An extra charge will be made for machine proofs. When sample of paper
accompanies proof, it should be O.K.’d and returned.
10. EXCESS PROOFS CHARGEABLE.
Where more than two proofs are called for, or where machine proofs are de-
manded, the customer shall pay time charges covering the full cost.
11. ALTERATIONS.
If, through customer’s error or change of plan, additional work has to be done,
such extra work will carry an additional charge, at current rates.
12. EXPEDITED DELIVERY.
Should delivery of work be required in less than a reasonable time for its proper
production, every effort will be made to secure freedom from defects, but allow-
ance must be made by customer in such cases. Should the delivery necessitate
overtime being worked, or other additional cost being incurred, a charge shall
be made to cover the enhanced cost.
13. BLANK PAGES.
Where a price has been given at per page for a book, pamphlet, magazine, or
like work, every page in the book, including, in the case of cut-flush paper covers,
the four cover pages, shall be chargeable at full rate, whether printed upon or
not.
14. INKS.
All estimates are based on the work being printed in black ink, unless specifically
stated to the contrary, and if any change of ink is required by the customer after
the order has been placed, an additional charge shall be made.
15. SLIP-SHEETING.
Should any change in customer’s instructions necessitate slip-sheeting, an extra
charge shall be made therefor.
16. HOLDING PRESS TO CUSTOMER’S INSTRUCTIONS.
Unless the customer is present when the forme is made ready on the press, so
that no machine time is lost, machine standing awaiting O.K. of customer will
be charged for at current rates for the time standing.
17. SKETCHES AND DUMMIES.
Sketches and dummies submitted on a speculative basis shall remain the property
of the printer, and no use of same shall be made, nor shall any idea obtained
therefrom be used except upon compensation to be determined by the owner.
(Continued on next Page)
PRINTING TRADE CUSTOMS


18. OWNERSHIP OF DRAWINGS, BLOCKS, ENGRAVINGS, ELECTRO-
TYPES, ETC.
Drawings made or procured and manipulated by the printer, and plates made
from the printer’s original designs or from designs furnished by the compositor,
remain the exclusive property of the printer, unless otherwise agreed upon in
writing.
Further, if in the absence of any specific agreement the printer makes electros
or stereos, in order to cut down press work or for his own convenience, then
such electros or stereos shall remain his property.
19. EXPERIMENTAL ORDERS.
Work produced in an experimental way at customer’s request shall be considered
an order, and be charged for.
*
20. CUSTOMER’S PROPERTY.
(a) Custody of Customer’s Property.—lt shall not be obligatory on the part
of the printer to insure any paper, or electros, or engravings, or manuscripts, or
drawings, or finished work, etc., which the customer places or leaves in his cus-
tody, unless he has been definitely instructed in writing to the contrary.
(b) Disposal of Blocks, etc. —In the case of used blocks, or electros, or stereos,
or other like materials left with the printer without specific instructions, the printer
shall be free to dispose of them at the end of twelve months, and to accept and
retain the proceeds, if any, to cover his own cost in holding and handling them.
If, before that time, the printer is not prepared to accept further responsibility
for the storage of used blocks, or electros, or stereos, or other like materials left
in his possession by the customer, he must notify the customer to that effect.
(c) Anchored Blocks, Soldered or Patched Plates. —These are used solely
at the risk of the customer, and any necessary repairs or loss of time caused by
them shall be paid for by the customer. When customer furnishes engravings
or electrotypes, and any change or corrections are necessary, in order to furnish
properly-finished work, the customer shall be charged extra.
(d) Materials Supplied.—Every care will be taken to get the best results where
materials are supplied by customers, but responsibility will not be accepted
for imperfect work caused by defects in or unsuitability of materials so supplied.
(e) Spoilage of Materials Supplied.—Unless the customer is able to prove
gross carelessness on the part of the printer, the risk and cost of all spoilage of
materials supplied by the customer shall be borne by the customer.
21. STANDING MATTER.
All matter kept standing at customer’s request shall remain the absolute property
of the printer, but, excluding a charge for rental, no charge (e.g., for re-composi-
tion) shall be made in connection with it.
(Continued on next Page)
PRINTING TRADE CUSTOMS


22. INDENTED MATERIAL.
Provided that it is specifically indicated by the printer that a given quotation
is based on the cost of paper and/or other materials especially indented or to
be indented for that job, it is to be deemed a condition of the quotation that in
the event of the non-arrival or delay in delivery of such indented material (so
long as the printer can demonstrate that he has exercised reasonable care and
promptitude in endeavoring to secure such material in sufficient quantities and
in reasonable time to do the work in accordance with his quotation), the cus-
tomer shall bear the net extra cost, if any, of procuring substitute material from
supplies held in Australia or elsewhere, and neither the delay (or non-arrival)
of such indented material nor the extra cost of such substitute material shall
entitle the customer to any claim for loss or damage.
23. SUSPENDED WORK.
The suspension of any work for a period of thirty days shall entitle the printer
to payment in full for the portion of the work completed.
24. PROGRESS PAYMENTS.
Where the time of execution of any work exceeds thirty (30) days, and the value
of the work exceeds Two hundred and fifty pounds (£250), after the work has
been in hand for one month the printer shall then be entitled to a progress pay-
ment, amounting to seventy-five (75) per cent, of the value of the work done;
and thereafter to fortnightly progress payments amounting to seventy-five (75)
per cent, of the work done in the fortnight for which the claim is made, until the
work is completed.
25. CANCELLATION OF ORDERS.
Regularly entered orders cannot be cancelled except upon terras which will
compensate the printer for all expense incurred, and otherwise protect him against
loss.
26. TERMINATION OF CONTRACT.
Estimates for publications are given upon the condition that not less than
three months’ notice is given to terminate the contract for the printing of monthly
publications, and, in the case of weekly publications, not less than one month’s
notice,
27. ACCEPTANCE OF DELIVERY.
When accepting delivery of goods, the customer, or his agent, shall be required
to sign name in full in delivery book. Initials will not be accepted.
28. CLAIMS.
All claims must be made in writing within fourteen days of receipt of goods,
beyond which period no claim can be entertained.

8 Point Old Style—2
PRIVATE COLLECTIONS OF BOOKS ALWAYS EXISTED. AND THESE
were the haunts of learning, the little glimmering hearts over which knowledge
spread her cold fingers, in the darkest ages of the world. It is a curious reflection,
that the ordinary private person who collects objects of a modest luxury, has
nothing about him so old as his books. If a wave of the rod made everything
around him disappear that did not exist a century ago, he would suddenly find
himself with one or two sticks of furniture, perhaps, but otherwise alone with
his books. Let the work of another century pass, and certainly nothing but these
little brown volumes would be left, so many caskets full of passion and tender-
ness, disappointed ambition, fruitless hope, self torturing envy, conceit aware,
in maddening lucid moments, of its own folly. Perhaps the ideal library, after
all, is a small one, where the books are most carefully selected and thoroughly
arranged in accordance with one central code of taste, and intended to be
respectfully consulted at any moment by the master of their destinies. Voltaire
never made a more unfortunate observation than when he said that rare books

But for them, the Guild of Gutenberg would have remained rich in reverence, though
poor in revenue. Advertising has swelled the word's whisper into the cannon’s
crescendo that thunders 'round the earth. When twilight lets her curtain down and

with the right of-way of the King’s Messenger. Advertising has rouged the face of
type and turned it coquettish with color as the damask cheek of My Ladye Fayre.
The need of speed has made A dvertising scratch the match for the flash of invention
to blaze the path to shorter paths. A dvertising has reformed and refined alike printing
types and types of printers, setting up fresh standards in setting up and, then,
upsetting them for later and greater. The guildsman, through Advertising, has
gained new homage and honor for his olden calling, which goes back to the cockcrow
of culture and which will go on "till the sun grows cold and the leaves of the Judg-
ment Book unfold,” because the Master of the Word is the Master of the World.

them nearly five hundred years before Gutenberg cut his matrices
at Mainz. They were made of plastic clay, hardened by fire after the
characters had been cut on the soft surface of a plate of clay in which
they were moulded. The porcelain types were then set up in a frame
of iron, partitioned off by strips, and inserted in a cement of wax,
resin and lime to fasten them down. The printing was done by rubbing,
and when completed the types were loosened by melting the cement,
and made clean for another impression. This invention seems never
to have been developed for any practical application in superseding

PRINTING IS THE ART OF ENLIGHTENMENT
of all Arts, as truly as an Art Preservative. It reflects and
disseminates in true colors, without distortion or stinted
reservations, truth that is stranger than fiction, guiding
ever with strong hand the destinies of thinking worlds.
Over two hundred and seventy-five years ago, Comenius
urged, with ardent zeal, the establishment of a college of
learned men, who should bring together in one book the sum
total of human wisdom ; so expressed, as to meet the needs
of both present and future generations. But the effort

WHEN, IN THE COURSE OF EVENTS. IT IS NECESSARY FOR ONE PEOPLE
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to
assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which *
impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident: That
all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ; that, whenever
any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of
* the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government, laying
its foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to
them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence,
indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed

SIGNATURE INDICATORS WERE FIRST PRINTED IN 1472 IN
Cologne. They first appeared in England in 1480. Catchwords, In-
dicating connection of one page with the following page, were first
used in 1469 in Venice by Johannes de Spira. Leaves were numbered
before pages were. Leaf numbering was first used In 1470 in Cologne
by Arnold ter Hoernen. Musical notes were first printed in 1473
in Esslingen by Conrad Fyner. The parenthesis was first used in
Ulm in 1474 by John Zainer. The punctuation marks we use took
a lot of invention. Before printing the slanting stroke and the period
had to serve for all purposes. Marginal notes were first used in
1469 in Rome by Sweynheim and Pannartz. Whatever evolution
may or may not have had to do with Creation, it has had every-

Many years ago the styles in feminine garments did not
change once a year, A dress was in style until it was
worn out. Now such styles change at least once in
every three months. Even the apparently conventional
clothing of men varies constantly. Every progressive
