Chief Secretary’s Office,
Brisbane, 30th March, 1909.
Dear Mr. Archer,
I have much pleasure in handing to you a copy
of the report on the Port Alma-Broadmount question,
and as your Board are the body which bears or guaran-
tees the cost of the work to be carried out, I hope the
Members of your Board will give the report their care-
ful consideration and advise me as to which of the
proposals for providing a satisfactory deepwater port
for the Central District they prefer and are prepared
to guarantee.
I regret the delay that has taken place in
sending you the report, but you will see how desirable
it was that the estimate given for the novel scheme of
connecting Port Alma and Broadmount should be veri-
fied by actual survey before submitting the matter for
the consideration of your Board or of the public.
Yours most sincerely,
(Signed) W. KIDSTON.
Robert Archer, Esq.,
Chairman, Rockhampton Harbour Board,

THE DEEPWATER PORT.
THE UNDER-SECRETARY TO MR.
MONCRIEFF.
Chief Secretary’s Office, Brisbane,
12th January, 1909.
Sir,—
I have the honour, by direction, to in-
form you that His Excellency the Gover-
nor, with the advice of the Executive
Council, has been pleased to appoint you
(in conjunction with Messrs. W. Pagan
and E A. Cullen) to be a member of the
board of inquiry to consider and report
on the question of the relative cost of mak-
ing and maintaining a deepwater port at
Broadmount and Port Alma respectively,
having a minimum depth at the wharf
and in the channel leading thereto of
24 ft. at low water springs, and navigable
at all states of the tides by night and by
day.
In the case of Port Alma the main fac-
tor is the cost of connecting the existing
wharf with the Rockhampton-Gladstone
Railway and of providing for a supply of
fresh water. In the case of Broadmomit
the main factor is the improvement of the
water approach, it being necessary for you
to consider the width as well as uepth of
channel required to ensure reasonable
safety to large vessels navigating it. In
both localities the cost of providing wharf-
age accommodation for two ships is to be
considered.
Tlie cost of the work required and its
manner of execution can only be deriir-
ininod by engineers ; but the difficulties
and dangers of navigation in those two
ports can be best understood by those who
have had the actual! handling of ships
there. Therefore Captain Wilkinson, Har-
bour Master. Rockhampton, and Captain
Sykes,- late Harbour Master tlwr-g have
been instructed to attend on board the
Fitzroy, which will take you to Keppel
Bay, and to furnish you with the fullest
information, from the navigator’s point of
view; as to the advantages and disadvan-
tages peculiar to each port and the chan-
nels leading thereto. Those two officers
are both experienced pilots, and for many
years have been engaged in th; actual
handling- of ships in those waters. You
will, therefore, be largely guided by the
opinions of those officers, and by the" facts
on which their opinions are based, in de-
termining what is required to make those
ports safely navigable by large vessels.
The questions submitted for your con-
sideration are the technical and financial
ones stated above. You will disregard all
ex parte representations in favour of
either port and will deal with the matter
solely on its business merits, and after
careful examination of the two localities,
in order that the Government in coming
to a decision may have the assurance that
they are determining the matter on the
actual facts concerning those two ports.
You haye been appointed chairman.
I have the honour to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,
(Signed) P. J. M'Dermott,
Under-Secretary.
THE BOARD’S REPORT.
Brisbane,
21st January, 1909.
Sir,—
Acknowledging the honour conferred
upon us by His Excellency the Governor
in appointing as a board of inquiry to con-
sider the “ making and maintaining” of
a deepwater port at Broadmounc or Port
Alma, we, having made preliminary in-
quiries as directed in your letter ox the
11th of January, 1909, have now the
honour to report as desired.
INTRODUCTORY.
We have confined investigation strictly
within the limits laid down, and this re-
port is based on the stated requirements
of at least 24 ft. depth at low water
springs in any channel decided on, ample


wharfage accommodation for two ships,
suitable connection of such wharf with the
existing railway system, a good water sup-
ply, and exclusion of all considerations ex-
cept those which are either technical or
financial.
SEA APPROACHES.
Having visited the delta of the i'itzroy
River, we find that the existing sea ap-
proach to Broadmount Wharf is 300 ft.
wide, with a nominal depth of 17 ft., which
has b'een from time to time reduced by
silting, and that this process will be con-
tinuous. The channel is tortuous and
would require straightening as -veil as
deepening if it is to be navigated with rea-
sonable security at all states of tne tide.
Swinging room at the wharf is ample.
The existing sea approach to Port Alma
is practically straight. In its natural con-
dition it gives the depth of rvater required
and this has remained practically constant
for thirty years. Therefore no straighten-
ing or deepening would be required. The
currents are negligible. The swinging
room at the existing wharf is sufficient.
Vessels drawing from 25 ft. to 2G ft.
harm already made use of Port Alma and
Broadmount. The draft of oversea shins
is increasing. Vessels drawing 3fl ft. will
in the early future he much more numer-
ous than at present and may be expec-
ted in Keppel Ba3 T . When the firne
conies to provide accommodation accord-
ingly this can be done Avith a ve 'y small
amount of dredging near Port Alma Wharf
only, but not in the Broadmount channels
except at a very large outlay both in first
cost and maintenance.
LAND APPROACHES.
A'. Broadmount the wharf is 600 ft. long
and Avould, therefore, require lengthening
to accommodate tevo large vessels. The
connection of the Avharf sidings with the
general railway system of the state is ex-
cellent, and the usual station accommoda-
tion already existent. There is uc pro-
vision for vehicular traffic ; but this at
present appears to be unnecessary.
At Port Alma the wharf is only 500 ft.
long and would require extensio i. It is
isolated, there being no land approaches of
any kind in existence. It Avould be neces-
sary in this case to construct a new line
to connect with the railway system. Any
attempt to do so across the flat and flooded
country between Oasuarina and Inker man
creeks AA"ould be fraught with difficulties
in construction. Such a line would bo
sixteen and a-half miles long an! be liable
to interruptions in working in some sea-
sons. This we look on as a serious dis-
advantage if harbour accommodation is
provided for the express purpose of giving
quick despatch to vessels at all times.
Residential accommodation at Port Alma
Avould also involve a large expense to
obviate light running to Bajool junction.
An approach can, hoAvever, be made by
extending the Broadmount existing lino
across the river, over Casuarina island and
creek, so reaching the wharf at Po-t Alma
in a distance of, say, six and three-quar-
ter miles. This line Avould be generally
on sounder ground, and not liable to in-
terruption by floods, but Avould involve a
swing bridge, Avith two 100 ft. openings,
over the Fitzroy River for the passage of
A r essels to Rockhampton. The construction
of the rail approach by this route Avould
utilise the existing raihvay and appliances
in connection Avith Broadmount which
would otherwise be rendered useless, and
residential accommodation could readily
be found there as at present. The cost
of the necessary running between Port
Alma and Broadmount for traffic purposes
would be counterbalanced by the shorter
running of all trains to Rockhampton via
Broadmount instead of via Bajool.
FINANICIAL.
to provide a suitable navigable channel
to Bioadmount wharf 400 ft. wide and
24 ft deep at loav Avater springs would re-
quire dredging to the extent ol 4,500,000
cubic yards (barge measurement), and the
closing of the south channel of the Fit/-
roy River Avoist of Flat Island to half
tide, at a cost of £143,000. To carry out
this Avork in four and a-half years Avould
necessitate the use of plant not hoav avail-
able which Avould cost £132,000, and as
there Avould still be some continuous silt-
ing of such a channel an annual outlay
of at least £3OOO should be provided for
maintenance. The Avliarf should be in-
creased in length by 400 ft., which, if car-
ried out in timber to correspond with the
existing structure. Avould cost £15.500.
6


Thus, if Broadmount were adopted as the
deepsea port for the Fitzroy River, giving
a constant depth of 24 ft. in a channel
400 ft. wide and a wharf 1000 ft. mug, a
provision of capital to the extant of
£290,500 would be necessary and an
annual outlay of £3OOO. There would bo
some recoup to this capital outlay ii the
plant could he sold when the work was
done. There would, however, still be the
risk of an abnormal flood in tue Fitzroy
River, causing silting of the artificial
channel, the extent of which cannot be
forecast.
The Port Alma wharf should be increased
in length by 500 ft. and widened. This
would cost £30,000. A railway to junc-
tion with the .main line near Bajool across
the flooded flats would necessitate an out-
lay ot £72,000. Accommodation for traffic
working in a second approach to the
wharf, allowing for run-round siding and
lighting, would ultimately be necessary
and cost £7OOO more. An efficient water
supply would cost £20,000. The/.- would
still be danger of traffic being stopped on
this branch line by abnormal floods in the
neighbourhood of Bajool ; but how often
this might occur cannot be foretold. The
annual cost of .maintenance of this line
would be, say, £ISOO and the annual add-
tional outlay at the interlocked junction
would be £SOO.
A railway line to Port Alma wharf via
Broaoiiioimt would cost £IOO,OOO. Accom-
modatior for traffic working in a second
approach would ultimately be necessary,
allowing for run-round sidings and lighting,
and would cost, as in the previous case,
£7OOO. An efficient water supply wmld
cost £12,000. In this case there would be
no danger of traffic being stopped by
floods. The annual maintenance w T onld
cost, ©ay, £IOOO, and the annual addi-
tional outlay for working the swing-bridge
over the Fitzroy River would be, say,
£250.
Looking upon, the wharves at Broad-
mounc and Port Alma as alternativ d y pos-
sible as outer ports for the Fitzroy Elver,
and Rockhampton raihvay station as the
objective for the traffic in either case, their
comparative values are as follow, traffic
and berthing accommodation being made
equal in both cases —
The rail carriage from Broadmount
would be over a distance of 26 miles ;
from Port Alma via Bajool Jure-lion 35|
miles, or via Broadmount 33 miles.
Th , navigation of large vessels to Broad •
mount would be via an artificial curved
channel subject to strong currents and
liable to silting, while the navigation to
Port Alma would be via a straight natural
permanent channel.
The cost of putting the two places on
an eouai footing, with 1000 ft. of wharfage,
rail communication, and sea approaches,
giving 24 ft. at low water springs in chan-
nels 400 ft. wide, would be as follows—

[*Tt is found on making a survey, that
the cost of this line would be £37,891
more than the tstimate here given, so
thor the total cost would be £186,891
rather than £149,000 —see Chief Engi-
neer’s letter of the 25th of March.]
CONCLUSION.
The marine and nautical advantages
due to the situations of these two ports,
remain most unquestionably in favour -of
Port Alma, while the shore conveniences
arc in favour of Broadmount ; but most
of these can be utlised if the approach
across Casuarina Island is made. By the
selection of Port Alma and the adoption
of this route, permanent deepwater ap-
proaches to the wharf would be secured,
which would be capable of improvement if
rec ired, risk of delay by flood would be
avoided, the possible abandonment of the
Broadmount railway would be avoided,
and, if the annual cost of maintenance is
7


capitalised at four per cent, the scheme
would be found the most economical.
We respectfully submit the above re-
port as dealing with the technical and
financial aspects of the problem submitted
to us. Questions of policy have been
avoided altogether. The technical portion
of the report is not burdened with minute
detail. The estimates given are in all
eases approximate, sufficient detailed in-
formation requiring surveys not being ob-
tainable in time to admit of their being
otherwise. The documents on which the
estimates are based are available in the
local offices, AVhile a generally explanatory
map is attached, and also a list illustra-
tive of the types of A'essels which, since
1900, have visited Rockhampton, Broad-
mount, and Port Alma, exclusive of the
coasting steamers that call at Keppci Bay.

NOTES OE CAPTAIN WILKINSON’S
STATEMENT.
The outside harbour at the mouth of
the Fitzroy Biver is Keppel Bay, and the
anchorage is at Sea Hill, which can be
reached at all states of the tide and
Aveather. The minimum depth in the
middle channel to Broadmount wharf is
15 ft. loav water springs, the rise of tide
at neaps 10 ft. and at springs from 14 ft.
to iG it. 1 have taken vessels to Broad-
mount draAving 25 ft. on high water
springs. I had no difficulty, but had to
Avcrk to the tide. The taking of such
vessels depends on Avorking the tides with
all large ships of deep draught, Bioad-
inonnt is a tidal harbour. The channel is
crocked from a nautical point of vioAV.
Mackenzie Island channel —that is. Ncs. 5
and G leads —is the most dangerous. Nos.
2 and 3 are not too good for a heavy ship
The dangers are the short turns and the
cross current through the North Passage.
There have been vessels ashore there—-the
Kent, the Duke of Buckingham, and the
Lar.gt on Grange. This last Avas due to a
defect in the steering gear. At Nos. 2 and
3 leads the current sets across and is a
difficult one. If Nos. 2 and 3 were eased
round and made wider and Nos. 3 and G
cut out altogether, No. 4 being continued
to No. 7, I could guarantee to take a
vessel up or down at all times so long as
there was water to float her. No. 0 lead
has silted badly in the past. No. 3 has
also silted through the tide crossing : this
is an encroachment in the width of the
channel. Some silt comes down the river.
Four hundred feet width of channel is re-
oiured. It would not be sufficient to de-
velop the channel on the present leads.
If these works were done we would have
a splendid port at Broadmount. there is
no difficulty in approaching Port Alma
with deep draught vessels —I mean 24 ft.
—any time, tide, or weather, except with
a south-east gale. Then I would anchor in
either harbour. There has been no silt-
ing up so far as I knew. For vessels
<1! awing 24 ft. Port Alma is a self-made
harbour with straight approaches and no
silting. With care, the swinging berth is
sufficient. This harbour is well sheltered.
I do not think that for the present more
than 24 ft. depth will be required. Twenty-
five feet was the minimum depth I got in
sounding. I have had no experience with
swing bridges ; but I do not think that
less opening than 100 ft. would do.
NOTES OF CAPTAIN SYKES’S
STATEMENT.
I have had personal experience of bofh
ports for twenty years. The available
depth at Broadmount when I retired was
16 ft. minimum at low water ordinary
spring tides in the channel. That is equal
to 13 ft. 0 in. working water. The deepest
draught vessel I have known to go to
Broadmount Avas 22 ft. 6 in. All the
vessels handled by pilots are recorded in
the Harbour Master’s office. The difficul-
ties of going up are —first, the very
narrow channel; second, the curves arc too
abrupt —it is a crooked channel ; third,
from No. 5 to No. G leads you have to con-
tend Avitn the tides. The difficulty is in
the steering of the ship. One ship at
least went ashore from this cause. All
the intersections are bad. This Avould
make it A’ery much Averse if one ship were
to meet another at such places. To cure
this No. 4 lead should he produced to


No 7. The channel from Nos. 1 and 2 in-
tersection should not be less than 400 ft.
wide. If dredged out to 24 it. this
channel would fill up again. The 16 ft.
channel remained open only for a short
time. At one time there was only 10 ft.
6 in. depth in No. 6. It Avould be u : dicult
and expensive to keep it open. The ap-
proaches to Port Alma are good —excel-
lent. The minimum depth at the wharf
two years ago was 25 ft. 6 in. There
would be no difficulty in approaching at
any state of the tide. • I know of no silt-
ing except under the wharf. This port
has naturally the 24 ft. required. There
is ample room to swing large vessels now;
but it would be better if the shore on the
opposite side were dredged 100 ft. at
Chersonese Point. There is no doubt
that Port Alma is the better port ; that
is from a nautical point of via v. There
have been no material alterations in
depths or widths during twenty-six years.
There have been no contractions of the
channel. I am favourably impressed with
the idea of putting in a railway via
Casuarina Island with a bridge as de-
scribed. If a vessel going up the river
bad to wait as now, approach to tne
bridge as she would a wharf, 100 ft. width
would be sufficient.
MR. PAGAN’S REPORT.
[ln view of the fact that the estimates
of cost given for the Port Alma and
Broadmount schemes were based on. sur-
veys it was considered desirable that the
estimate of cost of tlie board’s proposal
to connect Port Alma and Broadmount
should also be based on actual survey, and
the Chief Engineer for Railways was in-
structed to have such a survey made. The
Chief Engineer reports as follows —j
Chief Engineer’s Office, Brisbane,
25th March, 1901).
Memo.
Broadmount—Part Alma Railway.
I have the honour to advise having now
prepared the estimate from the piau and
section just completed. The amount of
the estimate is £141,682. The preiimumw
estimate for the same work was £102,791,
there being thus an increase of £37,891,
which is due to the following causes—
Increase in length of line from six and
three-quarter miles to seven and a-
half miles, as found from actual sur-
vey.
Increase in length of bridging from
6600 ft. to 8484 ft.
Increasing the swing span over the main
channel of the Eitzroy River from
two 100 ft. openings to two 200 ft.
openings ; and the height of the piers,
as rock has been found at 74 ft. be-
low low water, being much deeper than
was expected.
The estimates referred to do not include
water supply, which, if brought from
Broadmount in a 6 in. pipe, is estimated
to cost £12,066, nor for any extension of
the. Port Alma wharf.

DISCUSSION BY THE HARBOUR
BOARD.
Reprinted from The Morning Bulletin of the 22nd of April, 1909.
At the meeting of the Rockhampton
Harbour Board yesterday the report of
the Board of Experts appointed to in-
quire into the deepwater port was tabled.
The members present were : —Mr. R. S,
Archer (Chairman), the Hon. A. H. Par-

The Premier (the Hon. W. Kidston)
wrote as follows under date the SOth of
March—' - I have much pleasure in hand-
ing to you a copy of the report on the
Port A(m a- Broad mount question, and as
your Board is the body which bears or
guarantees the cost of the- work to be
carried out, I hope the members of your
Board will give the report their careful
consideration and advise me as to which
of the proposals for providing a satisfac-
tory deepwater port for the Central Divi-
sion they prefer and are prepared to
guarantee. 1 regret the delay that has
taken place in sending you the report ;
but you will see how desirable it was
that the estimate given for the novel
scheme of connecting Port Alma and
Broadmount should be verified by actual
survey before submitting the matter for
the consideration of your Board or of the
public.”
The Chairman had given notice that he
would move the following resolutions :
(1) “That the Board, having received
a copy of the report of the Board
of Experts on the different proposals
for providing a deepwater port for
Central Queensland, reaffirms the re-
solution it passed on the Ist of Octo-
ber, 1907, asking the Government to
build a railway from the Rockhamp-
ton-Glads tone lino to Fort Alma, and
requests that the work bo carried
out in terras of the agreement dated
the 9th of April, 190 S, and signed
by the Secretary for Railways and
the Chairman of the Board on behalf
of the Government and the Board re-
spectively.”’
(2) “That the Beard informs the Go-
vernment that, in carrying out that
portion of the scheme which is to be
paid by the Board, it is not the in-
tention of the Board to provide at
present a second approach to the
wharf at Port Alma ; that, in ex-
tending the wharf, wdrile the addi-
tional length will be 500 ft., the
breadth for the present will be 25 ft.;
and. further, that the Board intends
at first to instal a water service by
barge from Broadmount Instead of
one by pipe from Bajool.’’
The Chairman said that, before moving
the resolutions, he would ask leave to
make an alteration in one item. In the
second resolution he said “ the breadth
for the present will be 25 ft.” He would
like to amend that to read “30 ft.” The
other figures w r ere a mistake.
Mr. Rudd : Why not leave it open I
Why fix 30 ft. any more than 35 ft. ?
The Chairman : I have an estimate
from tbe Engineer based on 30 ft.
No objection was offered to the altera-
tion being made.
The Chairman said that, in moving the
first resolution, he would point out that
Mr. Kidston in his letter said —
“ I hope the members of your Board
will give the report their careful con-
sideration and advise me as to which
of tine proposals for providing a
satisfactory deep water port for the
Central Division they prefer and are
prepared to guarantee.”


lie thought that, showed plainly that the
head of the Government, anyhow, was not
prepared to make either ot the ports avail-
able 1 at the country's expense, but would
require a guarantee. Coming to the re-
port, he thought they would all agree
that the three gentlemen appointed w ere
very competent to deal with the matter.
The Chairman (Mr. A. B. MoncrielT) was
a. w r ell-know'll engineer in South Aus-
tralia. ar.d Mr. E. A. Cuilen and Mr. W.
Pagan were very well-known engineers in
Queensland. Then, again, the evidence
that had been taken as to the merits of
the two ports was from Captains S. Wil-
kinson and A, E, Sykes. * These two gen-
tlemen had been navigating the river,
the mouth of the river, and the two ports
in question for the last twenty or thirty
years, and he did not think that anyone
could be better able to speak of the
merits of the two ports than they were.
Captain Sykes had in the past, and Cap-
tain Wilkinson had in the past, and also
would have in the future to bring ships
into these ports, and he did not think
that anyone could speak from the navi-
gator’s point of view better than those
two gentleman. Of course he took it
that the most important point of all was
the cost. When they came to look at
the cost of making Broadmount a deep-
water port, they must bear in mind that
all the time they had asked for a deep-
water port. Sonic people said now that
a tidal port was quite sufficient —that, in
fact, Broadmount had plenty of water.
Many hard things had been said about
some members of the Board for not im-
proving Broadmount ; but it had been
said now that Broadmount as it stood
was almost all that was necessary for
the requirements of the port. All lie
could say was that the Board had been
spending its money on the river for the
last four or five years. The tidal port
of Rockhampton w as at the town wharves,
and, according to the programme laid
out by idie Engineer for this year’s work,
within twelve months they would have
16 ft. of water right up to the wharves.
That was as good as Broadmount was
now. He could say—and he knew what
he was speaking about —that every one
of the ships that had been lying and un-
loading at Broadmount, if they came here
next year with cargo for the port, would
he found unloading at the town wharves.
It would he an enormous saving to the
trade of the port when they did that.
To take the coke ships alone, the cost
of railage on coke—and coke was a par-
ticularly low-grade freight—came to about
3s. per ton. The extra cost on each boat
would amount, therefore, * to £3OO or
£4OO. With kerosene and other goods
it would be a great deal more. All that
money would be saved to the importers
when* they had their tidal port at Rock-
hampton. Rockhampton was their tidal
port. What they had been asked for
—especially by the people of the west
—was a deepwater port which could be
used by ocean-going ships at any state
of the tide. So they came to the ques-
tion of cost, which was really the crux of.
the whole thing—the cost, of providing a
deepwater port. The cost of making
Broad i nount a deepwater port was
£275,000, or £290,500 if they included the
expenditure of £15,500 on the wharf. The
cost of plant and dredging was £275,000.
That placed the proposal altogether be-
yond the means of the Board. The Board
simply had not the money ; and even if
the Government would lend the money to*
the Board, it would mean doubling the
charges of the port. He did not think that
the most enthusiastic deepwater port man
in the west, or anyone else, would like to
have all his charges doubled. So lie took
it that the cost of making Broadmount a
deepwater port put it completely out of
the running. There were, then, two schemes
for making Port Alma the deepwater pout.
Coming to the report, these three en-
gineers (Said of Broadmount —
“ The channel is tortuous, and would re-
quire straightening as well as deepen-
ing if it iis to be navigated with reason-
able security at aU states of the tide.
Swinging room at the wharf is
ample.”
Of Port Alma they said —-
“ The existing sea approach to Port
Alma is practically straight. In its
natural condition it gives the depth
of water required, and this has re-
mained practically constant for thirty
years. Therefore no straightening or
deepening would he required. The
currents are negligible. The swing


• ing room at the existing wharf is
eufiieient.”
The report was founded on the evidence
of Mr. Cullen—or, rather, Mr. Cullen was
responsible for it as one member of the
board. It was founded practically on the
evidence of the two harbour masters. So
far as they were concerned. Port Alma
was the Past possible port they could get.
He did not think that statement could be
successfully challenged. The report went
on to say —
H Vessels drawing from 25 It. to 26 ft.
have already made use of Port Alma
and Broadmount. The draft of oversea
ships is increasing. Vessels drawing
60 ft. will in the early future be much
! .mere numerous than at present and
may be expected in Keppel Bay. When
the time comes to provide accommo-
dation accordingly this can be done
with a very small amount of dredging
near Port Alma Wharf only, but not
in the Broadmount channels except at
a very large outlay both in first cost
and maintenance.”
He thought the evidence in favour of Port
Alma as a suitable deepwater port was
altogether overwhelming. Of course they
had heard a Jot of things ‘mid about Port
Alma. He simply put these down —always
had put them down—as fairy tales, and
he thought the report confirmed that view’
altogether. Then they came to the ques-
tion of how they were to get to Port
Alma. The commission suggested two
routes. One was via Broadmount, with a
m idge across the Pit troy River and
another across Casuarina passage, at a
total cost of £142,000. It would be re-
membered that, in considering the line
from Bajcol originally, they discussed ho v v
much of the earnings of the blanch line
would he credited to the Board against
the guarantee. With the Bajool line the
proportion came to about half, or a shade
over that, the length of the branch line
being about half the distance between
Port Alma and -'Rockhampton. On the
other luinid, if the bridge was built across
the river, and the line guaranteed by the
Board, the new line would he only one-
quarter of the whole distance. Therefore
the Board would, he credited with only a
quarter of tins earning power. The Broad-
mount line meant an expenditure of
£142,000, and, on the other hand, the line
to Bajool would cost £72,000. The only
thing was that, in contrasting the two
routes, the report said that to build a
line
“ across the flat and flooded country be-
tween Casuarina and Inkerman creeks
would be fraught with difficulties in
construction. Such a line would be
sixteen and a-half miles long and he
liable to interruptions in working in
some seasons.”
Then again the hoard said—-
“ There would still be danger of traffic
‘being stopped on this branch line by
abnormal floods in tire neighbourhood
of Bajool.”
It would be remembered that when the
Gladstone line was to he built, the en-
gineers were very much against bringing
it along the present route, but wished to
bring it round the ridges near Gracemere
and then run across the flats. Against the
wishes of the engineers, the line was built
on its present course. There could be no
doubt that, as the engineers said, the Glad-
stone line in abnormal floods would be
covered with water near the Yeippen
Lagoon, and no doubt it was possible the
Port Alma branch might he interrupted
too. But when had they the last abnormal
flood that would dp damage to either line ?
Tine last abnormal flood was in 1896
thirteen yeans ago. He did not think the
question of floods should he seriously con-
sidered. If they never built railways in
Queensland because in abnormal seasons
they would be blocked by floods, be did not
think they would build any railways at
all. On the one hand, the Broadmount
line to Port Alma was estimated
to cost £142,000, and 1 on the other
the Bajool line £72,000. The Board
had to give a guarantee whichever line
was built, and, in his opinion, the Bajool
line was the only possible way of getting
to Port Alma within the means of the
Board. He thought they could safely give
a guarantee for £72,000 when they would
get a little more than half the earnings
of the whole line ; but lie thought it would
be very injudicious to- give a. guarantee for
£142,000 with the certainty of getting
only one-fourth of the earnings. The
second proposal was altogether beyond
the means of the Board. The commis


sioners had estimated the cost of a water
(Service for Port Aim,a at £20,000 and of
lengthening and widening the wharf at
£30,000. "No doubt it would he a very
nice thing to have the wharf equipped as!
the commissioners suggested ; hut he
thought that for some years- —anyhow
until the traffic warranted the larger
scheme —they could do with a, smaller ex-
penditure. He had asked their own Engi-
neer to prepare an estimate for an exten-
sion of the present wharf 500 ft. long by
30 ft. wide, which would give ample room
for two lines of rails along the wharf, and
which would make the total length
1000 ft. The present shed was 500 ft. long
hy 30 ft. wide, and would, he thought, for
the present anyhow, more than provide
accommodation for any cargo that had to
he stored there. The estimate for an ex-
tension built of timber on the same
plan as the Broadmount wharf was £7500,
with £IOO added for dolphins. As to the
water supply, the Board had obtained
some particulars from the Railway De-
partment as to the quantity used at
Broadmount at present. For the year
ended the 31st of March last the quantity
was 241,000 gallons. The maximum quan-
tity supplied to any one ship was 29,500
gallons. His proposal was that the Board
should supply the wharf with water by
means of a barge which would hold
25,000 gallons. Assuming that the water
used wasi the same as was supplied at the
Broadmount Wharf, the barge would have
to make only ten trips a-year to supply
the water required. He proposed, further
to put up on a stand a water tank hold-
ing 50,000 gallons. As the greatest supply
that any ship had asked for was 29,000
gallons, considering that, with the tank
full and the barge alongside, they would
have 75,000 gallons of water there, he
thought that, for a good many years to
come, I hey would be able to l meet all
calls for water at Port Alma without
going to the expense of getting, it by-
pipe. The estimate Avas —For wharf ex-
tension, £7500 ; dolphins, £l6O ; water
tank and stand, £BOO ; pump and. boiler,
£l3O ; water barge, £IOOO ; lighting,
1 £250 ; making the total cost of the pro-
poised additions £9840, or, Avith ten per
cent for contingencies, £10,824. Then the
Engineer had taken Mr. A. J. Goldsmith’s
estimate for alterations to the existing
wharf, including Avidening it by one span
and shifting hack the shed, at £SOOO.
Adding that sum to the other estimate,
gave a total of £10,424. Well, when
they had used up all the loan of £150,000
which had been voted for the river, tlie
Board would still be Avithin its borrowing
powers by £22,000, so he thought it could
afford to put the proposed extensions to
the wharf and make it perfectly service-
able for some years to come. He there-
fore moved the first motion, considering
that it was the only practicable and pos-
sible way of giving the division a deep-
Avater port. There could he no doubt
that the people in the Avest had been
calling for many years for a deepwater
port. His idea Avas that these people
did not care two straws on Avhich side
of the river the port was so long as
they got a port Avhich Avould meet their
requirements. He realW believed that
when the matter was rut fair 1 * before
the Avestern people they would confirm
the report of the commissioners, and he
hoped "the Board would also confirm it.
Mr. Parnell, in seconding the motion,
said that, considering the lucid manner in
which the Chairman had placed the case
before the Board, and lliat the question
had been before the public for something
like twenty years, he would not say very
much. He believed it Avas something like
sixteen years since the Chamber of Com-
merce appointed a commission on the
subject. The commission consisted of busi-
ness men and nautical men, and like the
present Board of Experts, it Avas unani-
mous in recommending Port Alma. As
the Chairman had remarked, the Avestern
people did not care Avhere the port
Avas situated so long as Rockhampton
gave them a deepwater port. That Avas
what the western people had been agitat-
ing for. for the last twenty years. If a
seaside resort Avere Avanted, he would ad-
mit that Broadmount filled the bill in
every- respect, but Broarmount AA'as not
a decuAvater port. It Avas nothing hut
a tidal port, and as the Qhairmaii had
remarked, they did not require a tidal
port at the mouth of the river. At
Port Alma they had 2G ft. of water.
Every year the vessels Avere becoming of
greater" draught, and it Avas necessary to
provide a port of the descriptioh of Port
Alma. He thought they Avould make a


great mistake if they did not seize the
opportunity now that it was here. He
thought the report would give finality to
the matter. As for the report, he couid
quite understand that the experts', look-
ing at the sum of money which had been
spent on the line from Nankin Junction
to Broadmount were loth to abandon it.
Hence the suggestion of the bridge, which
did not seem to have received any favour
from the supporters of Port Alma nor any
consideration from the supporters of
Broadmount. The suggestion had been
simply wipcjl away, as he thought it
should be. As a representative of the
payers of dues, ho felt certain that the
western people would be pleased to' think
that the question had come to its final
stage. He hoped the Board would pass
the motion, because it was quite within
the means of the Board to give the
guarantee without imposing anything of
a tax upon its resources. As the returns
showed, the revenue was increasing, the
Board was getting rid of its expenditure
on the river, and within the next twelve
months it would have completed the river
to a depth of 10 ft. He was sure the
west would appreciate that news, and
doubly appreciate it if the Board adopted
Port Alma.
Mr. Tomkins said he had much pleasure
in supporting the motion. He was very
glad to see finality to ibis vexed ques-
tion. Both parties had agreed that it was
desirable to have the question settled,
and he hoped to see an unanimous vote.
After looking into every phase of the
matter, he had honestly come to the con-
clusion that there was no other port
than Port Alma within the financial
means of the Board. He wag' glad to
see that the experts had confirmed what
he thought,
Mr. De Little said he was sorry he
could not accord to the motion the sup-
port that other members of the Board
were giving it. He thought the motion
Avas framed on wrong lines altogether.
When the board of inquiry was appoin-
ted there was a mutual understanding
that the Harbour Board Avas to accept
its decision.
Mr. Tomkins : Hear, hear.
Mr. De Little said he had read through
the report, and it seemed to him to re-
commend the scheme for carrying the
railway from Broadmount to Port Alma,
Of course if it came to a matter of look-
ing into the schemes and making sugges-
tions, which the commissioners had not
done, it was surprising lo him that they
had not recommended that a wharf be
built at Shell Point, Avhere there was
30ft. of water and a straight lead in.
That Avould haA’e saved the cost of build-
ing the bridge and railway across Casua-
rina Creek, which seemed to be almost
the chief part of the expense. However,
he Avas quite prepared to support the
recommendation made by the hoard of
inquiry. Before any other scheme the
board of inquiry recommended the Broad-
mount Port Alma scheme. Of course the
cost was very large ; but Avhen they came
to make deductions, as the Chairman
proposed to do in the case of Port Alma,
the cost of the scheme could be brought
down to a considerably less sum. He
thought that the cost of all the schemes
was much too heavy and that the trade
of the port did not require any such
heavy expenditure. In his opinion, the
money could he much more profitably
spent in building a railway from Long-
reach to Winton. If such a railway were
built it would bring more trade to the
port than, the one to Port Alma, Ti e
Port Alma railway could not create trade.
Of course there had been what might be
called meshes Avoven round the port ques-
tion from which it Avas very difficult to
extricate it, and he did not see Avhere
the finality Mr. Tomkins referred to came
in. He thought that most people who
read the report Avould agree Avith him
that the commissioners recommended a
certain scheme which .was not in accord
Avith the motion. If Mr. Farnel! referred
to the '' Western Champion he AA'Ould
see an article there expressing the hope
that the members of the Board would
shake hands over the matter and accept
the recommendation of the commissioners,
Avhich Avas clearly stated in their report.
Mr. Tomkins : It is a bridge of com-
promise between the two parties.
Mr. De Little : For these reasons I
Avould be prepared to support the re-
commendation as mad© by the board of
inquiry ; but I cannot support this
motion.
The Chairman : If I alter my motion to
build a bridge across the river and across


Casuarina Creek, vouldl you support
that ?
Mr. De Little : That is a. matter which
does not come into the question.
The Chairman) : Yes, it doles. We are
asked by Mr. Kidston to come to a de-
cision.
Mir. Le Little : We did) not know any-
thin" about it till we came to the table.
We had not seen that letter.
The Chairman : The report was printed
and issued to ail the members of the
Board a week ago, and Mr. Kidston’s letter
is printed on the very first page.
Mr. De Little said that lie thought the
report should be discussed first.
Mr. Bremner said he did mot feel in-
clined to support the motion ; in fact, he
did not see why it should be brought on.
If there wias a preference shown by the
commission, it was for Broadmount. The
commission did not show any preference
for the Port Alma-Bajool connection ; but
seemed to throw it aside in order to take
up the Broiadmount-Port Alma connection,
which it favoured strongly.
Tine Chairman : They evidently wanted
to get to Port Alma somtehow.
Mr. Bremner said that he was not going
to say that he was in favour of the Broard-
mount-Port Alma, connection. He thought
tire restrictions placed on the board of in-
quiry were too drastic. Tire only ques-
tion the board was asked to report on was
the cost of a port 24 ft. deep.
The Chairman : A deepwater port.
Mr. Bremner said that in his opinion
what the commission should have been
asked to examine into in connection with
a report of the kind Avas the suitableness
of the port for the town and district it
Avas to serve. Port Alma by the Bajool
connection was thirty-five miles from
Rockhampton. He had not heard of any
other place in the Avorld that had its deep-
Avater port thirty-five miles from the
toAvn. Once Port Alma was adopted there
would be no hope of getting the shipping
to Rockhampton.
The Chairman : What, Avith the river
deepened ?
Mr. Bremner said there would he no
hope of getting the river deepened to the
wharves. In Broadmount they had a A T ery
good port. There were very few ports in
the world equal to it uoav. The Chairman
proposed to cut down the. cost of the Avater
supply by providing punts and, barges, and
to make the extension of the wharf only
30 ft. in Avidth. Exactly the same argu-
ments might be applied to Broadmount.
For instance, the commission reported
that the opening of Broadmount Avould cost
£132,000 for plant alone. Well, it Avas
A l , cry doubtful whetluer that plant Avas
Avanted. He Avould like to know to Avhat
depth the present dredger was. supposed
to work.
The Chairman : Ho doubt she could
dredge to 24 ft. or 30 ft.
Mr. Bremner asked how it -came about
that the scheme involved an expenditure
of £132,000 for plant when the Board
already bad a dredger capable of dredging
to a depth of 24 ft. It seemed to him to
be out of all reason. For the reasons he
had given he did not feel inclined to sup-
port the motion. It seemed to him that
three schemes were brought forward in
connection Avith the re rut, and if any one
a vat more favoured' ov the commission
wao tii l other ii was the Rr.vidmount-
-I‘o.t Alma connexion. Seeing that there
were three schemes put forward, he did
not think the motion should have been
brought toward until the Avhole matter
had been submitted to the peop<e who had
to pay for the work.
The Chairman : You would take the in-
quiry out of th© hands of the board of ex-
perts T
Mr. Bremner : It is the people avlio have
to pay, not the experts.
The Chairman : That is Avhy I propose
to adopt the cheapest possible AAay of
doing it.
Mr. Bremner considered that the
people should have an opportunity of
expressing their opinion, seeing that there
AA-as the narrow majority of one in favour
of the scheme.
Mr. Tomkins : GiA r e us your vote and it
avill make two. (Laughter.)
Mr. Bremner reiterated that for the
reasons he had given he Avould not support
the motion.
Mr. M‘Evoy said he was. sorry the posi-
tion Avas still complicated, as he really had
been of opinion that Avdnen they got
the report of the commission they Avould
all be satisfied. As a resident of the dis-
trict, he must say that they must all Avork
for what they thought to he its best in-
terests. He had given the matter a good


deal of consideration lately, and could as-
sure the Board that lie could not see the
wisdom of the experts’ decision. A sug-
gestion such as that of the bridge across
the river would he farcical in business life.
It would mean a continual source of ex-
pense not only to the present popula-
tion, but would be a lasting expense
to the district. In salt water a
bridge would deteriorate in value from
year to year, and in ten years would have
to be replaced by something else. It
would have been much better if the ex-
perts had said yea or nay in favour of
Broadmount or Port Alma. He would
certainly prefer that to the suggestion
that a bridge should be built. There was
a lot of truth in his opinion in what Air.
Bremner had said. They were getting on
well with the river, and people were satis-
fled with the progress that was being
made. It was a pity that the matter of
a deepwater port had not been left over
for twelve months until they got the full
result from the walls. It might be that
the scour created by the walls would have
a big effect on the middle channel. It
might be that they would have another
foot or two of water there. He did not say
that that would give them a deepwater
port ; hut there might he a big improve-
ment in the middle channel when the walls
were completed. That would satisfy the
district very well. They were in a posi-
tion now, he was pleased to say, to have
a deepwater port ; but he did not see why
they should he dictated to by the west or
the south or anywhere else. They had to
fight their own battles. In years to come,
when the country was opened up, they
might see their way to have the railway to
Port Alma or some other port which might
he suggested. He could not agree
with the motion on account of the three
suggestions having been made. If he sent
out several men to say which of two
schemes he should carry out and they
brought a third he would reckon that it
was not genuine or fair. Apart from that,
the cost was to he £142,000 for the bridge,
without taking the wharf into account.
Considering that the Board had spent
£150,000 on the river, with very good re-
sults, he did not see why they should
spend another £142,000 in connection with
the port. He thought the people of the
-district should he satisfied with the re-
suits that had been attained in the river,
and wait another twelve months until
they got the full fruit of the expenditure
of £150,000. He did not see the slightest
obstacle in the way of giving the guaran-
tee, as it could be seen from day to day
that the district was going ahead. Still,
he could not support the motion.
Mr. Macfarlane said he gave the pre-
vious speakers credit for having spoken in
all sincerity, as he believed they were
under the impression that they were doing
the best thing. But they had got from
the experts a definite statement that Port
Alma was not only the best port, but
that it was the only deepwater port. The
entrance to Broadmount by the middle
channel was out of the question alto-
gether. A great deal had been said about
the instructions that were given the com-
mission to' report on the cost of providing
a port with 24 ft. of water. A good deal
had been said about Glasgow, Liverpool,
and other places having a less depth,
than that ; but the main issue was for-
gotten in speaking about these things.
The aim was to get in tire coastal boats.
They knew that the coastal boats were
now drawing 24 ft. or 25 ft., and the
experts said that in a very short tine
the draught would b© up to 30 ft.
Mr. M‘Evoy : We are not starving for
them.
Mr. De Little : 24 ft. will pot be much
good then.
Mr. Macfarlane said that there had
not been much heard on the question
until the Board received a letter from
the west asking for a, deepwater port
“ open at all states of the tide.” The
Board was quite content at that time to
allow the scheme for gradually deepening
the river to go on. Then an attempt
was made to stop the river work alto-
gether, in order to deepen the channel
into Broadmount. Next there was an at-
tempt made to get some of the money
transferred from the river work with the
same object. His sole object in coming
on the Board again was to help to defeat,
that attempt. What was wanted was to
get the coastal boats to call here. Now,
if the coastal boats were to call here,
they must he given a channel of 24 ft.
or 25 ft., as they Wou'd not stop five
minutes for the tide. It must be remem-
bered that it was not only the want of


water that condemned the middle chan-
nel ; there was also- the tortuous nature
of the passage. With regard to ports
like Glasgow, it must be. remembered
that they were termini. If Rockhamp-
ton were a terminus, where boats were
going to lie for a fortnight or a month
it would be a very different thing, as a
few hours at the mouth of the river
would not make any difference. But the
coastal boats must be able to go in and
out without any delay whatever. Before
Port Alma was brought into such pro-
minence the Board was being constantly
pestered about the 17 ft. in the channel,
and asked to deepen it to 20 ft. Now,
however, the advocates of Broadmount
said that they were satisfied with 17 ft.
To his mind 17 ft. was as good as 20 ft.,
as the boats would have to wait for the
tide with either depth. That put Broad-
mount out of it. It could be seen pretty
Avell that the object of the commission in
recommending the bridge from Broad-
mount. was to avoid flooded country. As
the Chairman had pointed out, that
question was raised at the time the low-
level line was brought into Rockhampton.
According to some people at that time
the line was going to he frequently
blocked by floods. Well, it was thirteen
years since they had had a flood which
would have blocked the line, and as was
pointed out by the late; Mr. J. Leahy
at the time, if the line was blocked at
Rockhampton it was also blocked at Gym-
uie. In the same way there could not
be very much harm in having the branch
blocked, since at the same time they
would have the Central Railway blocked.
Mr. M'Evoy : A pity they are not
blocked oftener.
The Chairman : Hear, hear.
Air. Macfarlane said that he did not
thing that any member of the Board,
speaking seriously, would advocate put-
ting a bridge across the liver, which they
had spent so much money to deepen. It
did not matter what kind of bridge it
might be, he could not believe that it
would not seriously interfere with navi-
gation. They did 'not want the naviga-
tion of the river blocked. The deepwater
port was only for ships that would not
come up the river. So far as Broad-
mount was concerned, as the Chairman
had said, all the trade that was now
going there would come to the wharves
in twelve months’ time. He felt certain
that the trade would force itself to the
head of navigation. In the meantime they;
wanted to get hold of the boats that were
pasisng them by. There had been a
genuine demand in the west for a deep--
water port. / A good many members of
the Board had foreseen that Port Alma
would come some day. Now that the
moment had come to decide he did not
think that anyone could throw any rea-
sonable doubt on the recommendation
that had been made.
The Chairman said he would simply
like to say in reply that he Was very
glad to see that the gentlemen on his
left all seemed to appreciate the work
that was being done in the river., and
to admit that they were really pushing
the river along. Mr. M'EVoy seemed to
think that the deepwater port was not
required at all now, because the river had
been improved so much. At times the
Board had been accused of not pushing
the river along as quickly as it could ;
but the opponents of the motion, who
were acquainted with the work that was
going on, did not take that view.
The motion was then put and passed
by five votes to three. The Chairman and
Messrs. Rudd, Macfarlane, Tomkins, and
Parnell voted for it, and Messrs. De
Little, M‘Evoy, and Bremner against it.
The Chairman then moved the second
resolution.
Mr. Parnell, in seconding the motion,
said he thought the Chairman had
shown, in speaking to the previous mo-
tion, that the proposal embodied in the
resolution would meet the requirements
of the port for a long time toi come. So
far as the floods were concerned, he; did
not think that they need take that mat-
ter into consideration at all, because the
floods were blessings when they did come.
He felt confident that had the Chairman
submitted a resolution to the meeting to
adopt the scheme for a railway to Port
Alma via Broadmount, it would have been
rejected unanimously.
Mr. Tomkins : 1 think this would be
the best way of settling the matter, un-
less it would be cheaper to instal con-
densers for the water supply.
The Chairman : I do not think so.
Mr. Bremner said it was still necessary


for him to oppose the motion. The Chair-
man proposed to alter the report by
cutting down.
The Chairman said that the alteration
in this respect would be the same even
if the proposal to build the bridge had
been adopted.
Mr. Bremner said that the same argu-
ments could be applied to the opening up
of Brcadmount. He thought they could
knock off the £132,000 for plant.
The Chairman, : Would you take away
the dredger from the work it is doing
and allow the river to silt up ?
Mr. Bremner : I cannot quite under-
stand that part. Why should there be
an expenditure of £132,000 on a dredger
when we already have a dredger ?
The Chairman : It is not a question of
what cur dredger can do. We have any
amount of work for our own dredger
where she is,
Mr. Bremner : I think they say the
plant is not in the river.
Mr. Parnell : Our dredger is not suit-
able for that work.
The Chairman: There would be no
walls to pump behind.
Mr. De Little : I am not in accord
■with the motion, because it appears to
me wo are altering the report of the
board of inquiry. I think we ought to
consider the report first. It is not for
ns to say that the expertsi composing
that board are wrong.
The Chairman : We do not say they are
wrong. We say these proposals are suffi-
cient, for our present requirements.
Mr. De Little ; It has been practically
hinted that the report is not of very
much value.
The Chairman. : Not by me.
Mr. De Little : Well, you. have been
making recommendations which are not
in the report.
The Chairman ; In what way ;
Mr. De Little ; In cutting down the
wharf.
The Chairman : I say that it would
be very desirable to do at once wliat they
recommend if we bad the money. But
we have not the money.
Mr. De Little : They have made their
report, and this Board should abide by
••beii' report. If we do not fall in with
it the best tiling we can do is to let
the whole matter dropi and go on with
the original proposal to make 20 ft. to
the town wharves.
The motion was then put and passed
by five votes to three. The Chairman and
Messrs. Parnell, Eudd, Tomkins, and Mac-
far lane voted for it and Messrs. De Little,
M‘Evoy, and Bremner against it.
The Chairman said that Mr. Kidston
would be in Rockhampton on the follow-
ing day, and he thought it was desirable
that a deputation from the Board should
wait on him and present him with the
resolutions. Mr. Kidston had asked for
a reply, and it would be a good thing
if the reply were handed to him in
person.
Mr. Bremner : Can we hand in a
minority report at the same time ?
The Chairman : If you can pass a
motion to that effect. (Laughter.)
Mr. Ma-cfarlane said he thought the
suggestion a very good one. Ho did not
think it necessary that the whole Board
should go. He would move that a depu-
tation consisting of the Chairman. Mr.
Parnell, and Mr. M‘Evoy wait on Mr,
Kidston and present the resolutions.
Mr. M‘Evoy said that he would have
to return home next day. otherwise he
would have been pleased to be one of
the deputation. He would suggest that
Mr. De Little take his place.
Mr. De Little : I think two quite
enough.
Mr. Macfarlane then moved that the
resolutions be presented to Mr. Kidston
by the Chairman and Mr. Parnell.
Mr. Tomkins seconded the motion, and
it was passed.
This disposed of the Business relating
to this question.


INTERVIEW WITH THE
PREMIER.
Reprinted from The Morning Bulletin of the 23rd of April, 1909.
The Chairman of the Rockhampton Har-
bour Board, (Mr. E. S. Archer), the Hon.
A. H. Parnell, M.L.C., and the Secretary
of the Board (Mr. A. A. Alawdsley) waited
on the Premier (the Hon. W. Kinston)
yesterday afternoon to present the resolu-
tions respecting the report of the board
of inquiry into 1 the deepwater port ques-
tion passed by the Harbour Board at its
meeting! on Wednesday. The Treasurer
(the Hon. A. G. C. Hawthorn) and Mr.
K. M. Grant, M.L.A., entered the room
while the interview was in progress.
Mr. Archer handed Air. Kidston the fol-
lowing letter, dated the 21st instant :
“ Sir,—ln further reply to your letter
of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour
to inform you that the report of the
Deepwater Port Commission was con-
sidered at to-day’s meeting of the Board,
and the following resolutions were
passed :
(1) “ That the Board, having received
a copy of the report of the board of
experts on the different proposals
for providing a deepwater port for
Central Queensland, reaffirms the
resolution it passed on the Ist of
October, 1907, asking the Govern-
ment to build a railway from the
Rockhampton- Gladstone line to
Port Alma, and requests that the
work be carried out in terms of the
agreement dated the 9th of April,
1908, and signed by the Secretary
for Railways and the Chairman of
the Board on behalf of the Govern-
ment and the Board respectively.”
■ , (2) “That the Board informs the Go-
vernment that, in carrying out that
portion of the scheme which is to
be paid by the Board, it is not the
intention of the Board to provide at
present a second approach to the
wharf at Port Alma ; that, in ex-
tending the wharf, while the addi-
tional length will be 500 ft., the
breadth for the present will be
25 ft.; and, further, that the Board
intends to instal a water service by
barge from Broadmount instead of
on© by pipe from Bajool.”
“I have, &c.,
R. S. Archer, Chairman.”
Air. Archer said, it gar-e him much plea-
sure to- present the letter to Air. Kidston.
The Board thought that, as the trip Mr.
Kidston was taking along the coast was
understood to be for the particular pur-
pose of looking into the different harbours
and to go into the question of providing
accommodation for the steamers of the
Torres Straits mail service, it would be
a very opportune time to present the
resolution which had been passed on the
previous day with reference to a
deepwater port for Central Queensland,
At present, as Mr. Kidston knew, the
mail steamers had to lie out in
Keppel Bay, where they were met by ten-
ders. Not only these steamers, but all
the big coastal steamers plying up and
down the coast, had to be waited on
by this very obsolete service of tenders.
If the railway which the Board proposed
were carried to Port Alma, the mail ships
and other large vessels would be able
to lie in that port, and their passengers,
goods; and mails could be placed on the
train and taken very quickly up to town.
He might say that, in passing these reso-
lutions, the majority of the. Board —
unfortunately the Board was not
unanimous—did not wish in any way to
have it thought that they differed from
the finding of the commission. The com-
mission decided that between the two
ports, from a nautical point of view. Port


Alma was out and away the best —in
fact, was the only practicable port without
a very large expenditure indeed. The
only difference of opinion on the matter
was how to get to Port. Alma, and the
Board had selected the route to junction
with tine Gladstone Railway, which
was within its means. It was easily
within the means of the Board to
guarantee that line and also to carry out
the additions which were proposed to the
wharf. No doubt later the Board would
he able to build the whole of the addi-
tions which the commission recommended;
hut it considered that the additions, of
which its Engineer (Mr. J. H. Baynes) had
drawn up an estimate, would meet the re-
quirements of the port for some time to
come. As Mr. Kidston knew, this had
been a very long and vexed question. For
a long time the producers of the west
especially had demanded a deepwater port.
It was not a local matter, hut a question
that concerned the whole of the division.
He really hoped that the resolutions
passed by the Board would he a way out ;
that Mr. Kidston would be able to put the
railway through Parliament ; and that it
would be at once constructed. He was
sure that if the railway were constructed
Port Alma would meet ail their wants.
Mr. Parnell said he had very much plea-
sure in supporting all that Mr. Archer
had said with reference to the selection of
Port Alma. The question was one that
had occupied the minds of the citizens of
Rockhampton and the people of the west
for the last twenty years. He felt that
Rockhampton was hardly worth the name
of city without a deopwated port. Fur-
ther, the western people had demanded a
deepwater port for many years and
claimed that they were justly entitled to
it, considering that they were the largest
payers of dues. Without occupying any
further time, lie would say that he hoped
the matter would he thoroughly gone
into ; that it would be brought before Par-
liament next session ; and that the ques-
tion would be settled once and for ever.
He was certain that if Port Alma were
selected it would give Rockhampton and
the western districts the finest port that
was available.
Mr. Archer said he would like to say
that the proposal would not interfere in
any way with the improvement of the
river. The Board was pushing on the im-
provement of the river faster, he thought,
than had ever been done before, and the
completion of the whole scheme was in
sight. The guarantee and the improve-
ments to Port Alma would not hamper
the Board in any way in its river scheme.
The Board was pushing on still towards
the 20 ft. of water right up to the town
wharves.
Mr. Kidston said that as the deputation
probably knew, the Government, in its
policy of developing Queensland, was try-
ing to open up new districts with railways
to bring in new settlers, and it was also
trying to improve the shipping facilities
on the coast with the same end in view.
Each was simply a different aspect of the
same policy. When the Government
agreed to subsidise the new Torres
Straits steamer service it was simply
to give the producers better facili-
ties for handling their goods, in the
belief that, just the same as railways did,
it would help in the development of
Queensland. He regretted very much that
his own district was not in a position with
its port arrangements to get the full com-
mercial advantage of the service that the
Government was subsidising. Townsville
was in the same position ; Cairns was in
the same position ; and he had been up
the coast with a view to trying to get all
these ports put into such a position that,
like Brisbane, they would be able to reap
the full commercial advantages of the ser-
vice. He did not look upon this' as a matter
affecting simply the towns on the coast —•
the ports themselves. The Government
was not doing this for the sake of the
seaports, but for the sake of offering
greater facilities to the producers, and
chiefly the producers away from the towns
in the western country. Although he
was a Rockhampton man, and had a feel-
ing towards this matter as a Rockhamp-
ton man, he did not at all hesitate to say
in Rockhampton that this was a matter
that ought to be attended to for the sake
of the western producers even more than
for Rockhampton. He noticed that in
Townsville, with the harbour improve-
ments, any ships could come in and un-
load their cargo on the wharf or the rail-
way truck and have it sent right out
west. In Rockhampton the facilities bad
never been like that, and the western pro


dueers had been handicapped by the
lighterage dues. He thought, in the in-
terests of the ports themselves, their first
business ought to be! to give the greatest
possible - f acilities to the producers in the
back country. The ports could only te
prosperous in proportion as the producers
behind them were prosperous. When the
Harbour Board originally proposed to
guarantee the Port Alma line, the Go-
vernment was agreeable to propose the
railway to Parliament. Difficulties arose,
and the Government proposed to settle
these difficulties by referring the matter
to experts. He had just had an oppor-
tunity of glancing at the report of the
proceedings of the Harbour Board on the
previous day, and he noticed that there
was a misapprehension to this extent —
that some members seemed to think the
board of experts recommended the
connection of Port Alma and Broadmonnt
by rail. The board did not recom-
mend that. The report did not recom-
mend anything. These men were appoin-
ted, not for the purpose of recommending
anything, but for the purpose of finding
out and stating the financial aspects of
the question. It w T as not for the experts
to say whether the port should be Broad-
mount or Port Alma or a connection of
the two. That must be left to the per-
sons who were going to guarantee the ex-
penditure. What the board was ap-
pointed; for was to deal with the financial
and engineering aspects of the matter
only—how to overcome the engineering
difficulties and what it would cost. As to
what particular method the Government
took, the board, strictly speaking, had
nothing to do with. The Government
wanted, before judgment was come to on
the matter, to get the actual facts of the
case, so that the Harbour Board, which
had offered to guarantee one scheme,
would know definitely and, indisputably
where it was, and so that Parliament and
the people of the district and Rockhamp-
ton should be in the same position. He
cautioned the members of the commission
in the letter appointing the commission
of inquiry, to confine their attention
simply to the engineering and financial as-
pects of the matter, to pay no attention to
ex parte statements of one kind or another.
The only evidence necessary in the matter
was the evidence of sailing masters, the
evidence of those who were accustomed to
handling ships ini these waters. These
were purely technical matters. When that
inquiry had been undertaken, and when
tney had got as nearly as possible the
actual cost of the different schemes, the
whole matter was one for the Har-
bour Board, for the bodv that was going
to guarantee the cost, ‘it was quite be-
side the point to discuss any other scheme
than a scheme which somebody was pre-
pared: to guarantee. The Government was
not going to give railway facilities or har-
bour facilities to this district or any other
lines _ than it would give them to other
districts. That was to say, the district
which was getting the immediate benefit
must be responsible for the outlay. Conse-
quently, his work was done when he ap-
pointed the board of inquiry, which
found out the facts and published the
tacts. Then naturally the Harbour Board,
which previously had offered to guarantee
a particular scheme, had the matter placed
before it. He ivas pleased to think that
the Harbour Board bad lost very little
time in dealing with the report. To him
as a member of the Government, or as a
citizen of f the Central Division, it
was quite immaterial whether the
deepwater port was made at Broad-
mount or Port Alma. He assumed,
judging from the hasty glance he had
given to the report of the Board’s pro-
ceedings, and to what the deputation said
in the letter, a copy of which he had pre-
viously read, that the desire of the Board
was to get a deepwater port that would
he a deepwater port at all states of the
tide, and which would serve the trading
purposes, not only of Rockhampton, but of
the whole of Central Queensland behind it,
u Inch he took it was a chief factor in the
matter. In deciding for the Port Alma
scheme on the figures submitted by the
commit! ee of experts, the Board prac-
tically settled the matter so far as the
Government was concerned. He did not
know any other body that was likely to
offer to guarantee any of the other
schemes, and the Government was simply
bound to he with the Harbour Board in
the matter. He noted that the Harbour
Boanl, m dealing with the matter, had
no intention, and did not make any pre-
tension of a desire, to go beyond its
financial ability at the present time.


That was a matter entirely for the Board.
To him, reading the report of the exports,
it seemed quite, possible that a much
less sum than the £300,000 needed to
make Bread-mount available might have
been spent at the present time, just as a
very much smaller sum than the £135,000
for the Port Alma scheme might be
spent at tlie present time. What the
district had to consider, and Avhat the
Harbour Board, which wa- responsible for
the decpAvater port, had to consider, was
not what Avas actually going to he spent
noAV, but what it was ultimately going
to cost to give this district a satisfactory
deepwater port. Frankly, in his opinion,
the Board had acted very wisely. The
Board could give inside of the year a
deepAvater port for Central Queensland
.which would be in every way satisfactory,
and even more satisfactory and more
easily got at than Pinkenba Avas to the
Southern Division. As the trade increased
and as the revenue increased, the Board
might carry out tlie full scheme bit by
bit, letting the development follow’ the
development of trade ; but in the mean-
time, at a very moderate cost, as com-
pared Avith either of the other schemes,
the Board could get a really satisfactory
deepwater port for Central Queensland.
He had no hesitation, as Premier, in say-
ing that the Government would accept
the guarantee of the Board and would
introduce a bill in the opening session of
Parliament. What Parliament would do
Avith the bill he did not know. He avis
only one member of Parliament. For many
a ears—ever since he had entered Parlia-
hment —it had been the custom to delay
the railway policy of the Government
until the end of the session. He bad
found, however, that that resulted in A T ery
bad industrial arrangements for Queens-
land. When the railways Averc passed in
December it was the middle of the year
folloAA iug before the engineers were able
to start, and in the slack time of the
year—from January to June —when they
most Avanted work for the men who Avere
idle in the sugar industry, the shearing
industry, and the farming industry of the
Darling Downs, the railways that Parlia-
ment had provided largely for the purpose
of finding employment could not be gone
on Avith. His purpose avas in the coming,
session and future sessions to pass the
railways in the earlier part of the ses-
sion, so that, in the busy time of the
year—from July to December—the work-
ing plans might be got ready and the
railways started early in the year, when
employment was most needed. That
meant a good thing for Queensland in the
industrial sense, so that he hoped— of
course he did not know—the railways
would be introduced in the way he sug-
gested. The Harbour Board having given
the required guarantee, and having sail
what in its judgment was the best thing
to be done in providing a deepwater port
for Central Queensland, it would be the
duty of the Government—and he hoped
Parliament would recognise that it was
its duty too—to assist the Board in
passing the railway with the least pos-
sible delay. He was afraid they had not
acted A'ery wisely in the district over
this matter in the past. In any case,
this was a purely business matter be-
tween the Government and the Board,
The Board offered to guarantee the rail-
way and the Government; considered the
guarantee good enough. He thought to
a very large extent the Government was
bound to recognise that the body which
gave the guarantee was the body whose
opinion ought to be taken. He did not
hesitate to say that, in his own personal
opinion, he quite agreed with the opinion
of the Board. Pie did not think there
was any reason to spend £300,000 on a
deepwater port when they could get it
for less than half that sum. lie thought
a deepwater port was very desirable ; but
there was no need to pay for it twice
the money that was; required. Rockhamp-
ton had control of the outlet to Central
Queensland, and in a business sense it
Avas the duty of Rockhampton to see
that the outlet Avas made as convenient
as possible. Pie had been told that in
Gladstone the people were afraid that if
the railway Avcrc built to Port Alina the
steamer Bingera would be calling at Port
Alma. As lie had already said elsewhere,
he did not think there was the remotest
prospect of getting the Bingera hero.
Mr. Grant : We do not want it.
Mr. Kidston said that in any case he
certainly Avould not assist in doing that
and would oppose it if anyone' else tried
to do it. The calling of Ihe Bingera aavis
a very valuable thing for Gladstone and
24


would be of very little value to Eock-
hampton. Eockhampton had plenty of
communication with the north and there
was no reason at all why the Government
should carry cargo, passengers, and mads
from Gladstone to Port Alma for the
same money for which it now disposed
of them at Gladstone. He hoped that
would be clearly understood.
Mr. Grant : The Board does not want
that.
Mr. Kidston said the opening of Port
Alma w r ould give the district all the
shipping facilities it would require. He
would like to say that just before he
left Brisbane he got word that the White
Star line was discussing the building of
a new class of 17,000-ton ships for the
Australian trade and was making inqui-
ries at Brisbane as to whether those
steamers could be handled in Brisbane—
whether they could be brought up to
the new r wharf at Bulimba, And that w’as
rvhat was happening on the coast of
Australia. Those who had charge of the
different ports ought to cast about and
see ahead, because the more rapidly would
their producers get the facilities that
would put them, not, perhaps on a foot-
ing with Sydney—that was a long way
ahead—but, at any rate, approximate to
it. The boats that were coming out under
contract with the Britis'i-India Company,
■although they were very good steamers,
and very well suited in every way for
the trade of Queensland, were not the
steamers they ought to look to getting
when the contract terminated. The chances
were they would then have larger stea-
mers, constantly growing steamers, be-
cause it was found that such steamers
could handle stuff much more cheaply
than the smaller vessels. Sb, if the pro-
ducers of Queensland were to be put on
a footing with those of the southern
states, attention must be paid to the
shipping facilities. Their cutter men, their
beef men, their "wool men, and everyone
who was sending produce away from here
wanted, not only ready access to the
markets with ships, but wanted similar
terms to their southern competitors. The
harbour boards and the Government in
Queensland were bound to try to prepare
their ports for these ships.
Mr. Grant asked whether tho*e was a
prospect of the steamers of the White Star
line coming to Eockhampton.
Mr. Kidston : We can hardly hope to
get those steamers here.
Mr. Grant ; Will they come to Port
Alma ?
Mr. Kidston said they could be brought
to Port Alma just as easily as to Pin-
kenba. As a matter of fact, although
24 ft. had been spoken about, there was
26 ft. into Port Alma, with the exception
of one little patch.
Mr. Parnell : 25 ft. 6 in. was the last
sounding.
Mr. Kidston said that, with the excep-
tion of the one patch, they could get from
26 ft. to 30 ft. at Port Alma ; but with
24 ft. they could get any of these ships.
The harbour which a ship could enter and
leave at any state of the tide, with a
minimum depth of 24 ft. at low water,
was good enough for any shipping coming
to Queensland ports. If the Board was in
luck, if it got the railway, and if the work
in the river culminated as the Engineer
siaid it would —so that they would have
16 ft. or 17 ft. in the river and a deep-
water port with 24 ft, of water in it—they
would bo in a better position than any
port on the coast with the exception of
Brisbane. They would be as good as Bris-
bane,
Mr. Archer* : We have more tide than
Brisbane.
Mr. Kidston said that, of course, Bris-
bane had 24 ft, of water to the town
wharves, and it would be some time be-
fore Eockhampton got that. Eockhamp-
ton would do very well to have 16 ft. or,
perhaps', 18 ft. of water in the river up to
the town wharves andi a deepwater port
where there was 24 ft. or 26 ft. of water
at any state of the tide. He thought the
Harbour Board would have done very well
by Central Queensland when that was the
case.
Mr. Archer : Within twelve months we
shall have 16 ft. to the town wharves.
Mr. Kidston : Well, if Parliament passes
this railway, as I hope it will, within
twelve months yon will have also a deep-
water port, and there will be a long and
troublesome question settled.
Mr. Archer said that, in thanking Mr.
Kidston for receiving the resolutions of
the Harbour Board so sympathetically, he
would like to say that the Board had


never asked to have the Bingera brought
to Port Alma. Rockhampton had ample
communication with the north without
the Bingera. The Board recognised that
it would be very unfair to Gladstone to
ask for the Bingera. the Board had
never asked for the Bingera and never
intended to ask for it. He knew Glad-
stone had. that idea, and that was prob-
ably the reason why Gladstone was op-
posing Port Alma. Otherwise, he really
could not see how Port Alma could affect
Gladstone in any way.
Mr. Kidston : I cannot see it myself.
Mr. Archer : I think their opposition is
without reason.
Mr. Kidston : Of course they are afraid
of losing the Bingera.
Mr. Archer : They need not be ; they
are in no danger of losing it. Continuing,
Mr. Archer said that if they could get
Port Alma, and the railway within a rea-
sonable time —within, say, twelve months
- —Rockhampton would be in a splendid
position. The work in the river was get-
ting on very well. In fact, the Engineer
was just making ready to lay out the
last Trail. Inside of twelve months the
Board would have all its walls completed
for the 20 ft. scheme and would have
the river dredged out to> 16 ft. The com-
pletion of the depth of the channel to
give 20 ft. would not involve a great
deal. With the walls finished they would
have the river “ harnessed,” and he hoped
that before many years they would have
the 20 ft. right through. As Mr. Kid-
ston had said, if more than 24 ft. of
water was required at Port Alma, it
could be provided at a, small expense.
Mr. Kidston : I think with 24 ft. at
low tide
Mr. Archer : And a rise of 16 ft.
Mr, Kidston ; We will be “ ould white-
headed men” before we want more'. If
you have all the trade in this district
you can handle with the river carrying
18 ft. to 20 ft. of water and a deepwater
port with a minimum depth of 25 ft.
or 26 ft. at low water, well, when that
is inadequate for the trade of the, dis-
trict, we shall have made a great deal
of progress.
The deputation then withdrew.
