THE ALBEHT HTAHZA,
GREAT BASIN OF THE NILE,
And Explorations of the Nile Sources.
By SAMUEL WHITE BAKER, M.A., E.R.G.S.
? The grand addition to the Geography of Inner Africa made
by jj r . Baker.?? Sir Roderick I. Murchison, Bart.
? A model of what a book of travel should be."Saturday Review.
? a book which everybody must read."?North British Review.
?As a Macaulay rose among the historians, so a Baker had
arisen among the explorers.? ? Reader,
? Mr. Baker has completed absolution of the greatest geogra-
phical mystery of the last tWS&thousand years; his name and
that of his heroic wife, will be Wiperishably associated with the
Sources of the Nile ; and his book will in future ages be read, as
we now read Herodotus-a classic in literature, a romance in ad-
venture, ,ud a high aatborl,. In
� There is not a page in it that will not repay perusal; and not
a chapter that is not, in some way or other, suggestive . . . . . .
The names of Mr. and Mrs. Baker will be inseparable whenever
reference is made to their discovery of the Albert Nyanza; the
delicate woman, so strong in peril and so wise in emergency, and
the bold, brave man who, on first gazing down on the equatorial
basin of the Nile, had not voice enough to raise an English cheer,
but had heart enough to than; God. who had brought him and tus
brave companion safely to that end Athenceum.
? Charmingly written, full ot incident.?? Spectator.
?A narrative of adventure and discovery which has never been
surpassed either for interest or importance.?? Morning Star.
? A narrative of personal courage, endurance, and perseverance,
which fills the mind not only wiih wonder, but with pride.

A record of a remarkable enterprise.?? Times.
?While many a reader in happy homes has been perusing, during
the last eight years, the narrative of Dr Livingstone?s first expedi-
tion, that enterprising traveller, in the interests of trade, science,
religion, and humanity, has been engaged in penetrating, through
the eastern coast, into unvisited country. He has nobly accom-
plished a noble work, has ?run home,?as he calls it. to give to the
world the record of his experiences. There have not been many
voices from beyond the waters, not many echoes from afar, that
have been more welcome to us than the occasional intelligence
which we received of the progress and the fortunes of the African
travellers. That intelligence stimulated a curiosity which this book
will gratify."?Athenceum.
? A record of zeal, patience, self-denial, and heroism in the cause
of knowledge and religion which, perhaps, finds no equal in modern
literature.? ?Evangelical Magazine.
? Combine Moffat with Mungo Park, and the result would re-
semble David Livingstone. The ? Zambesi and its Tributaries ? has
enriched us with valuable information, obtained during six years,
and from regions unexplored before. It is a work every one should
read, and all who have libraries should buy.??Bender.
? Dr. Livingstone prides himself on being a missionary, and he
ennobles his calling by his conduct. Among modern travellers he
has not an equal. His volume will attract the most Indolent, and
please the most fastidious, by the irresistable grace of its unadorned
language.? ?Times of India.
? As a traveller Dr. Livingstone is unsurpassed, and after another
six years?spell of work that would have killed s ! : ordinary men,
the results of bis journeyings are here pithily det . ? ; .a a volume
quite as valuable and interesting as the ? Missiona Travels ?of
1857'.? ? Examiner.
