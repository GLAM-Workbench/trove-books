INTRODUCTION.
unprecedented famine afflicting millions of our fellow
tuK subjects in the Empire of India appeals in a forcible
manner to the entire British nation. It is a matter which we
dare not put off for future consideration. Even while efforts
are being made all over the Empire to alleviate the great
calamity which has befallen (50,000,000 British subjects,
thousands are perishing weekly from hunger and thirst. This
state of dire ■ necessity must continue for months to come
unless prompt relief on an enormous scale is afforded. In
Great Britain the London Mansion House Fund will prob-
ably reach £500,000, From all the British Colonies aid in
accordance with their means will be forthcoming. When
the numbers are up, we may safely assert that New South
Wales, in proportion to wealth and numbers, will be found
in a foremost place in the list. The hospitality and charity
of Australia is proverbial. True, it has of late been sorely
taxed ; but in the fearful trouble in India, all other attempts
will be thrown in the shade in the staunch efforts put forth
to make the N.S.W, Famine Fund worthy of the cause. In the
present instance, the “Elsie Hall Indian Famine Concert” is
■one of the means to this end, nobly undertaken. The pro-
ceeds of the Concert will add considerably to the funds in a
direct manner; while, indirectly, it will prove of an immense
advantage to the cause by enlisting the sympathies of many
thousands of kind-hearted people, not present to take part

Introduction — Continued.
in the function on the 11th July. It has always been found
in this country, that concerts, balls, &c., not only aid a chari-
table cause by the ticket money, but is the means of rousing
the sympathies of the public generally to the necessity of
aid, beyond that given, when a quid pro quo is the object.
In the present instance, every individual present at the Concert
tendered by the Committee of the Elsie Hall Co. will receive far
more enjoyment than the mere value of the cost of ticket
represents. But the real obj ect of the gifted lady an d those assist-
ing,was, apart from the pleasure afforded to the thousands able
to be present on the occasion, an earnest desire to awaken
in the community at large whole-hearted sympathy for the
famishing millions in India. Everyone present at the Con-
cert should consider it a pledge of sympathy with suffering
people of India and more than this, should make every
effort possible to subscribe and persuade others to join
them, in alleviating the millions now at death’s door, through
this fearful visitation of drought and famine in India. That
the appeal to the people of New South Wales will not be in
vain we are assured, ever ready as they are to aid in any good
cause ; but never since the colony was established has such
a gigantic necessity called forth its generous sympathies.
New South Wales, as, indeed, all Australia, will prove equal
to the demand.

THE INDIAN FAMINE.
Beyond the shadow of a doubt the last few months of the-
present century has to witness the most widespread calamity
which has visited the British Empire during the last ten
decades. The nineteenth century will ever stand in the annals
of history as the most brilliant the world has seen within the
record of time. Far and away the English-speaking race,,
whether under the Union Jack or the Stars and Stripes, in
the strides of universal progress, has led the way. But in
the acquisition of territory and building up of the Empire
Great Britain stands alone. In America the Empire is nobly
represented by Canada and other places. In Africa from
Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope its sway is acknowledged.
Australia is simply Great Britain junior, whilst in Asia
without reckoning Burmah or China, the vast and densely
populated Empire of India is of itself greater than the
dependances of all other civilised powers put together.
India for, at least, the present century has always been
spoken of as
THE BRIGHTEST GEM IN THE BRITISH CROWN,
and the greatest ambition of most families in England,
Scotland and Ireland of the upper and middle classes was to
obtain for their sons the chance of a pull at the Pagoda Tree,

in either the Military or Civil Service in India. At the
present writing, if the Pagoda Tree does not produce such
rapid fortunes to its voteries, it affords far more extended
means of remunerative employment to the thousands of
Europeans. The value of India to Great Britain is immensely
great. Its vast resources are distributed over the world by
British Merchants, its absolution of British manufactures-
and product is correspondingly extensive.
ALL OF OUR GREAT GENERALS
and leading warriors have gained the most of their military
experience in India. By the valour of our arms was India
gained, and, by the means of a great and expensive army
only can the great country be retained. Space will not
permit of further allusions to this subject, beyond the fact
that the enormous revenue required, must be contributed by
the conquered people of the country. The vast majority of
the natives live by agriculture, and what with taxes in good
seasons, and periodical droughts, etc., at the best of times
have but a mere existence. When, however, these droughts
become intensified

sheep, cattle and horses dying from this cause, and occasion-
ally we read with horror of men dying in the bush from the
want of water, but no pen can depict the awful results of
these droughts in our boasted Indian Empire. The figures
are so immense, that even compassion with familiar areas of
country and known population fail miserably to convey a
correct notion of the shocking and dreadful reality. The
present famine stricken portion of India comprehends an
AREA FULLY EQUAL TO NEW SOUTH WALES,
including plains, valleys and hill country, as difficult to reach
as many portions of this land. The greater portion of this
area, at least six times as great as England, Wales and Scot-
land combined, under favorable circumstances cannot be ex-
ceeded in the universe for beauty and scenery, luxuriance of
vegetation, and adaptation to support millions of Indians in
comfort. These favorable circumstances are notfthe excep-
tion to the rule, as many suppose, but other circumstances,
which we cannot here deal with, supervene, and within a
short period of drought the natives are compelled to live on
their seed grain, dispose of their half-starved working cattle
and their farming implements, and then comes the crisis.
Having referred to the famine-stricken area, we will just
glance at the population this area carries. This will prove as
Ivy Jams are absolutely pure.

Ah ! it’s bright no more as in days of yore,
And the years go creeping by ;
For it’s far away that you are to-day,
And it’s all alone am I ;
But the waves still are singing to the shore
As they sang in the happy days of yore ;
And my heart is for ever thine, love.
Are you thinking of me, Asthore ?
And the night winds are whisp’ring to the trees
That they bring me a message o’er the seas
That your heart is ever mine, love.
I am waiting for thee, Asthore.

There is pleasure where thou art;
While thy tale of love thou’rt telling,
Say—who can be sad of heart ?
Sing, sweet bird, &c.
Morn and noon and dewy even’
Anxiously for thee I’ll wait:
Come, thou chorister of heaven,
Cheer a soul disconsolate.
So shall time fond thoughts awaken,
Joy once more shall live and reign,
And the harp, so long forsaken,
Yield its dulcet notes again.

But you’ll think of me far across the sea,
And the happy days gone by ;
And I’ll wait for you with your love so true,
Tho’ it’s sad of heart am 1,
All alone am I, sad of heart am I,

I hear thee speak of the better land,
Thou call’st its children a happy band,
Mother, where is that radiant shore ?
Shall we not seek it, shall we not seek it, and weep no more ?
Is it where the flow’r of the orange blows,
And the fire-flies dance through the myrtle bows ?
Not there, my child, not there.
Is it far away in some region old,
Where the rivers wander o’er sands of gold,
Where the burning rays of the ruby shine,
And the diamond lights up, the diamonds lights up the secret mine,
And the pearl gleams forth from the coral strand—
Is it there, sweet mother, that Better Land,
Is it there, sweet mother, that Better Land ?
Not there, not there, my child.

Nor thro’ the gath’ring darkness shed
Is seen the glimmering beacon red !

Barnby ,
MISS KATE ROONEY.
He sailed away at the break of day,
The skies were blue and fair.
He kissed his bonnie hand to me,
With a heart as light as air.
When the flowiug tide comes in.
“ Hark ye ! ” he cried,
“Go watch the tide as it cometh up the Lynn,
For foul or fair I will be there, when the flowing tide come in.”
I watched the clouds that came in crowds,
Like flocks of evil birds
My heart sunk low with higher woe,
Remembering, Donald’s words
Remembering, Donald’s words,
“ O, God,” I cried, and none beside, knew the grief, my heart within.
“ Oh ! give meiback my bonnie lad, none else my love can win.
“Oh ! give me back my bonnie lad, when the flowing tide comes in, when
the flowing tide comes in.”
Across the strand, far up the land, the fierce wild waters swept,
Laid at my feet, a burden sweet, with a smile, as if he slept,
I could not weep so soft his sleep, for fear I would waken him!
I could not weep, so soft his sleep, for fear ’twould waken him.
Peace, let him rest,
Peace, let him rest.
God knoweth best, and the flowing tide comes in.
The flowing tide comes in peace, let him rest, God knoweth best, and the
flowing tide comes in.

FORTY MILLION FELLOW SUBJECTS
in a state of positive starvation —although an undoubted fact
—is almost beyond the power of comprehension. This is no
case of living on short rations, or other such cases with which
we are familiar, but actual deprivation of all sustenance to
support nature for nearly two-thirds of a year to come.
Forty millions—nearly ten times the population of all Aus-
tralia ! But the real fact is that over twenty millions more
are nearly in the same predicament, and, unless timely aid is
forthcoming, will speedily and positively add its tens of
thousands of deaths to the fearful number now succumbing
to the awful visitation. All praise to those who so liberally
subscribed to our Patriotic Fund, and to supply our troops
with comforts and luxuries in South Africa. But the case of
our fellow subjects in India is far more urgent. A mere
handful of rice or other grain will save a life for a day; a
shilling will sustain a family for a week; but thirty or
forty weeks must elapse before these 60,000,000 sufferers can
hope, even if the drought ceases, to reap sufficient crops to

the
ARCH FIEND FAMINE
has finished his triumphant progress through the great
country, his hidious CAMP-FOLLOWERS, PLAGUE and
Pestilence, will be sure to take up the running. Out
of the more than 30,000,000 now affected, it is awful to
contemplate how many will survive to recount the
of the close of the nineteenth century in India. That the
patriotic Australian nation will respond liberally to the
urgent cry for aid for their fellow subjects in India needs no
assertion, but that response must be prompt and continuous, if
it is to be of real service, and it would be well if every amuse-
ment indulged in, until the famine is over, could in part, at
least, subserve to mitigate the sufferings of those so utterly
unable to help themselves. By so doing we should prove
ourselves worthy citizens not only of Federated Australia, but
of the Great United and boundless Empire of Greater Britain.

Facts of the Indian Famine.
[By an Eye-Witness, Mr. George S. Eddy,]
India is now entering upon the greatest famine of the
century. The Viceroy and Imperial Council, surveying the
entire country, have said officially : ‘We are now face to face
with famine of food and water and cattle, which is unprece-
dented in character and intensity.’ No government, at such
a time, can undertake to preventiall suffering. The aggregate
famine area will be about 300,000 square miles (or five times
that of England), with a population of 40,000,000. There
is a further population of 21,000,000, in which more or less
general scarcity and distress prevails. The crises is one
which demands the loyal co-operation of all who love India.
To that co-operation in the months of trial that lie before us
on behalf of the Government of India, I unhesitatingly
appeal. With ability and heroism the Government is trying
to meet this crisis, but their revenues are reduced by the very
famine they are trying to relieve. Already there is a popu-
lation equal to that of Ireland on the relief works, and they
are increasing at the rate of several hundred thousands per
week. Government feels forced to reduce the wages to one
penny per day for a man and three farthings a day fora woman,
with grain rising every day, and a population nearly equal to
that of the United States in the famine areas. In South
India I saw a veteran missionary who went through the

famine of 1870. He says that this will be even greater than
the ‘ great famine ’ of 1896. Already the crowds of hungry
people were beginning to gather about his door. ‘ I saw one
group of gaunt spectres who had walked 75 miles stalk
silently in from the dusty road.’ ‘ Sir, 1 they said, ‘we have
no work, no food, no water ; how can we live ? ’ He could
only point them on thirty miles further, where there was a
little work at a penny or two a day. * But what will become
of our wives and children ? ’ The old man could not answer.
The people are living on berries and cacti, and these could
last but two weeks longer. As we drove through the
fields the cattle were gone, the streams weVe dry, the wells
often empty, the parched farms deserted, the villages were
quiet, the people silent and gloomy. The glaring heaven
judgment of God hung over the land.
In some places disease is following the famine. In one
little village the people in forty houses had smallpox. And
these people were starving. Some had eaten nothing for
days. We could not buy them a handful of grain in that
village. There was none to sell. And these starving people
are our fellow-men. On arriving in Bombay, I met an
old Princeton acquaintance. He had just come in from his
station in Gujarat. Gujarat was a fertile country, densely
populated. Now, every blade of dry grass is gone. Every leaf
was long ago torn from the trees for cattle, and now the
trees themselves have all been cut down for wood. The
whole country, once green as an Engiish park, is now a

blasted waste of barren stumps and burnt fields. Eight or
nine months of famine lie before us, even if the rain come
next monsoon. The cattle are dead; the Government
officials say they find men dead along the roadside. As I
passed the poor-house, I saw two men lying dead in the
street. The streets were filled with children winnowing the
dust of even the manure for particles of gain, to allay the
pangs of hunger. Every day, women come to me crying,
and ask me to take their children from their arms, and save
them alive. Some of the poor little skeletons died after I
took them. They were too far gone to be saved by food.
Repeatedly the parents have offered me their children for a
shilling, and they love them as we do ours. Children are
now being offered as low as twopence each, or for a measure
of grain. The Mohammedans are buying little girls at
this price. One has to live in a heathen land to know what
they will do with them. In all my life I have never seen
such need, or such an opportunity of doing good with
money. One dollar will save a child in an orphanage in
South India for nearly a month. Ten dollars will rescue a
girl during the famine. One hundred dollars might relieve
a small village. ‘Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye
did it unto one of these, my brethren, even these least, ye
did it unto me. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me
meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink.’
