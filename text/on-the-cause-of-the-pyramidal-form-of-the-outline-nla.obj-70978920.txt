On the Cause of the Pyramidal Form of the Outline of the
Southern Extremities of the great Continents and Penin-
sulas of the Globe. By W. L. Green, Esq. of Honolulu, in
the Island of Woahoo, Sandwich Islands.
Humboldt, in his ? Cosmos,? remarks : ? The' pyramidal
configuration of all the southern extremities of continents be-
longs to the similitudines physicce in configuratione mundi,
to which Bacon already called attention in his ? Novum Orga-
num and again he observes, ? The pyramidal terminations
of the great continents are variously repeated on a smaller
scale, not only in the Indian Ocean, and in the peninsulas of
Arabia, Hindustan, and Malacca, but also, as was remarked
by Eratosthenes and Polybius, in the Mediterranean, where
these writers had ingeniously compared together the forms of
the Iberian, Italian, and Hellenic peninsulas.?
A glance at the map of the world renders the truth of the
above obvious ; indeed, it will be seen that there is no consider-
able portion of land throughout the whole globe but what does
terminate towards the south in one or more pyramidal forms.
The cause of this fact may be expressed (as I would suggest)
in a few words, viz., that when an arched or conical surface
enters the water at an angle, in the direction of the length,
the water line must always describe a conical figure thereon,
with the apex pointed to the deflected end.
In the application of this fact to the case in point, it will
readily be perceived that, as a rule, the surface of every con-
tinent or peninsula partakes more or less of an arched or a
conical form, ?that is to say (independently of its arched form
as a portion of a spheroid), it is higher towards the centre
than at the sides, and the incline from the interior towards the
sea-coast is moderately regular.
There is no fact in geology better established than that vast
portions of the earth?s crust are constantly undergoing a
change of level. The great area in the Pacific Ocean occupied
by atols and coral islands is perhaps the grandest and best
proved instance of this fact. These atols also prove, as has
? SRs ' ? P*f . -s ; ?'


Cause of Pyramidal Form of Outline of
been ably demonstrated by Darwin and Dana, that the nature
of the subsidence or upheaval is not necessarily a simultaneous
ascent or descent of the whole area, but rather that a large
segment of the earth?s crust remains stationary, or nearly so,
at one end, and rises or falls at the other.
It is self-evident that the largest and deepest oceans are the
areas of greatest subsidence, and that the southern hemisphere,
consisting as it does of nearly all ocean, has been the grand
area of subsidence. If, then, the axis of this area of subsi-
dence (or of these several areas of subsidence) has been any-
where to the northward of the pyramidal extremities of South
America, Africa, Arabia, Hindustan, and Malacca, that form
of coast line follows as a necessary consequence ; for they are
arched or conical surfaces, entering the ocean at an angle in
the direction of their length ;* and they have their apices
pointing to the deflected end.
What the Southern and Indian Oceans are to these coun-
tries, the Mediterranean is to the peninsulas projecting into it;
the Atlantic to Greenland, Newfoundland, and the south-west
of England; and perhaps North America may owe its form to
the same principle.
It is immaterial to the truth of this principle whether any
of these particular countries be at present rising or falling, all
that is necessary is, that an area of the earth?s surface, of more
or less arched or conical superficies, enters the sea, or emerges
from it at an angle.
A simple practical exemplification of the principle is obtained
by taking in the hand a common playing card, and arching it
slightly by pressing the two sides; insert it in a basin of
water with the arch uppermost, and the lower edges just below
the surface, the greater part of the arch being above; then
depress one end just below the surface, and the water line will
form a good representation of the southern extremities of
South America, Africa, or Hindustan, according to the angle
of depression. By bending the card along the middle, thus
* It is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact, that all the main moun-
tain chains of the portions of continents where the pyramidal form exists run
north and south, or nearly so, ?that is to say, the arched or conical superficies
enter the ocean at an angle in the direction of their length.


forming a ridge in the centre with straight sloping sides, and
depressing one end in the water as above, similar figures are
produced; or, bending the card parallel to its length, about
three-fourths of an inch from one side (the ridge thus formed
representing the position of the Andes to South America), and
depressing one end below the surface of the water at a certain
angle, an exact representation of the southern extremity of that
country is formed by the water line.
The smaller the angle at which such a surface enters the
water, the more acute will be the conical figure, and vice versa.
This agrees with the facts as shown in the three countries just
named ; inasmuch as where we find most ocean, there Ave should
expect the greatest depression, and the surface of the land to
enter the ocean at the greatest angle. Thus to the southward
of Hindustan there is more ocean than to the southward of
Africa, and the angle of the conical figure of the former is
consequently more obtuse than that of the latter; whilst to
the southward of Africa there is more ocean (and probably,
therefore, more depression) than to the southward of South
America, and the angle of the coast lines is more obtuse than
those of the last-named country, which are the most acute of
the three, and, having the least area of ocean to the southward,
may be expected to be inclined to the ocean at the smallest
angle.
The bluff point of Africa is evidently a local result, arising
from the circumstance of there being a table-land there, and
is rather a corroboration of the truth of the principle now ad-
vanced than otherwise, for this is just the effect a table-land
would have under the circumstances supposed.
It is of course not to be expected that we should find per-
fectly conical or pyramidal coast lines in these countries, as
local elevations, subsidences, and degradations destroy the
regularity of the surface, which has a corresponding effect on
the regularity of the coast lines.
The general average height of the land above the sea-level
should, on this principle, decrease not only from the central
portion towards the sides or coasts, but also from the direction
of the supposed highest end of the area towards the lower,
?from the northern base of the pyramid to the apex at the


south; and this seems to he actually the case. The extensive
and high table-lands appear to be where they should be in
South America, Africa, and Hindustan. Volcanic peaks must
not be accounted in estimating these relative heights; and
even mountain ranges not volcanic, which may have been
raised subsidiary as it were to the grand movement, can
only be expected to show a partial agreement with the prin-
ciple.
The general course of the rivers should show a tendency to
flow towards the deflected end of the area, besides running
east and west from the crown of the arch or ridge; and in
accordance with this, we find a marked southerly trend of the
rivers in the conical portions of South America, Africa, Hin-
dustan, and in the great track to the southward of China, end-
ing in the peninsula of Malacca.
It may be observed, that when a table land of unusual height
extends across an area, thus entering the ocean at an angle,
the coast line would necessarily make a sudden curve in at the
point where it ended. This may perhaps account for the deep
bights on each side of South America, and on one side of
Africa.
The subsidence exhibited by the ocean at the north polar
regions, being a comparatively small circular area of depres-
sion in a mass of land of somewhat even character of surface,
would necessarily not admit of larger pyramidal outlines of
land than capes and promontories.
Although the proved nature of the subsidence over the large
area of atols in the Pacific Ocean, ?that is, stationary at one
end and depressed at the other, ?is brought forward to show
the probability that this may be the nature of all the subsi-
dences and upheavals of the earth?s crust on a grand scale ; the
certainty of the fact, that a conical or arched superficies enter-
ing the sea-level at an angle must present a conical or pyra-
midal outline where the water cuts it, ought rather, in view of
the phenomenon that all the great continents or peninsulas
(being conical or arched surfaces) point with their apices to
areas of subsidences, be the proof that such is the mode of
that subsidence or upheaval.


General Considerations* relating to the Earth's Crust , which
seem to occur from the nature of its Subsidences, as exhi-
bited by the form of the Southern Extremities of Continents ;
also their probable connection with Volcanoes, illustrated
Kilanea.
Confining our view, for the present, to the southern half of
the globe, as divided by the equator, it will be evident (if the
cause of the form of the southern extremities of continents be
considered as demonstrated) that the whole solid crust of the
southern hemisphere is inclined at an angle to the surface of
the true spheroidal form of the earth ; or, at any rate, it is so
from the equator to some parallel of latitude to the south-
ward of Cape Horn, say at least to 60� south.
But besides this inclination, there is another general form,
which the surface of the solid crust in this hemisphere must
have (between the equator and 60� south), judging from the
facts as we find them.
If we commence from a point on the equator where longi-
tude 25� west cuts it (being about the centre of the North and
South Atlantic Oceans,) and draw a straight line (on the globe)
to a point in latitude 60� south and 35� east longitude, that is
to say, 60� south and 60� to the eastward ; from this point
another line to a point on the equator, 60� northward and 60�
eastward; thence 60� southward and 60� eastward again, and
so on round the globe, till we arrive at the point from which we
started; we have in the spaces included in these lines six re-
gular triangular areas, each of 120 degrees base. In three of
these spaces we find nothing but ocean, and in the other three
all the land in this portion of the globe pretty equally divided ;
the sea spaces and land spaces being also alternate, that is to
say, there is an area of all ocean between each triangular area
containing the land. And further, if we include in our view
Madagascar with Africa, and New Zealand with Australia,
we find the apices of the cones formed by the coast lines
point to about the southern angle of the three imagined trian-
* Some of these considerations are merely speculative; and although they
depend mainly on the truth of the view taken of the form of the southern ex-
tremities of continents, they may be wrong \ but the truth of that view is in
nowise dependent upon these speculations.

gular areas containing the land ; or, in other words, we ought
to look for the central ridge of the conical superficies in or
near the line drawn through the centre of our land areas. The
three meridian lines, which in fact equally divide our triangles
containing the land, pass within three degrees of the Northern
Andes, through the great north and south chain of Southern
Africa, and within three degrees of the New South Wales and
Van Diemen?s Land range of mountains. That is to say, they
pass close to the three, and the only three, great north and
south ranges of the southern hemisphere. Or, taking the six
meridian lines at equal distances of 60� each, which divide
our six triangular areas, it may he affirmed, speaking gene-
rally, that three pass along the highest ridges of land, and
three along the central or deepest portions of the ocean, in the
southern hemisphere; a line of ridge and a line of hollow being
alternate and at equal distances.
It is easy to perceive, by inspection of the accompanying
sketch (PI. 1., fig. No. 1) of the Southern Hemisphere, show-
ing these triangular areas, that a section of the globe taken
through any parallel of latitude between the equator and 60�
south would exhibit on the surface-line of the solid crust a
figure approaching that in fig. No. 2 (PI. I.), which is supposed
to be a section taken through the tropic of Capricorn, exag-
gerated in proportions to be rendered more clear and sensible.
It seems hardly necessary to observe, that this general view
of the facts of the form of the earth?s crust in the southern
hemisphere is more compatible with the hypothesis of a solid
crust, shrinking on to a contracting fluid interior than with
any other hypothesis advanced. It must be left to mathema-
ticians to say whether a supposed equal force, acting upon
every point of a hemispherical crust of supposed equal strength,
would not be resolved into three directions, and tend to cause
six rents, as supposed in fig. No. 2 (PI. I.); and whether the
irregular hexagonal form, that is with the alternate angles in-
terior, is not the form that ought to exist under the circum-
stances supposed.
There is one result of an equal pressure on the hardened
crust of a spheroid which does not require a mathematical
calculation to be perceived to be a necessary one, ?that is,
that the flattened poles must, other things being equal, be the


occurring from the Nature of its Subsidences. 67
first to yield. Is there evidence that the poles of the earth
have so yielded first, and now exhibit the greatest depression ?
The circular space of ocean existing as far as we can pene-
trate at the North Pole, shows, at any rate, a certain amount,
and a regular amount, of depression there.
The Antarctic continent at the south is as yet no evidence
that the depression of the solid crust, now assumed to be proved
to exist in an increasing degree from the equator to 60� south,
is not still greater between this parallel and the South Pole,
inasmuch as all that land is, as far as known, purely volcanic.
It is a part of the view now advanced of the nature of the de-
pression of the earth?s crust, that there will probably be an
outbreak of the molten interior at the central portion of the
line of depression. It is to be expected (as an inspection of
fig. No. 2 (PL I.) will explain), that a rent will be formed in
the solid crust at the points or lines of the resolution of the de-
pressing forces. The molten interior, then, may flow out to
the height due to the pressure (modified by accompanying
accidental circumstances), it may solidify, thicken the crust
about that region, and show above the ocean as land; but is
no proof whatever of the bodily rise or non-depression of the
mass of the solid crust of the earth,
A notable instance of a line of purely volcanic matter, and
no other land whatever, along a line of depression (in accord-
ance with this view), is exhibited by Iceland, the Azores,
Cape de Yerde, Trinidad, and Sandwich Land, extending from
the Arctic to the Antarctic circle, and all included within about
ten degrees of longitude. The central meridian of this space,
25 west, was the starting-place for our six lines, and goes
through the centre of the first of our areas of subsidence in the
southern hemisphere.
Whatever laws have governed the form of the solid sur-
face of the southern hemisphere must, we may be satisfied,
have also governed those of the northern ; and if we cannot
equally well apply the same to both, it is because some modi-
cause, not understood, has altered or complicated the
effects. The simplicity of the observed facts of the case in
the southern hemisphere, and their comparative complexity
in the northern, ought to induce us to confine our attention to
the former first, resting assured that, when these are brought

68 Considerations relating to the Earth?s Crust ,
under law, the facts of the northern hemisphere must some
day be included.
It has been shown, principally through the admirable expo-
sitions of Darwin, that lines of active volcanoes are generally
found on areas of upheaval, or at least that, where volcanoes
are active, there the land is rising : that on areas of known
subsidence, active volcanoes are not found. This is principally
exemplified in the Pacific Ocean, where perhaps an equally
correct statement of the case might be expressed as follows, viz.:
?that active volcanoes, and narrow areas and lines of moderate
upheaval, in the Pacific Ocean, are found on the borders of
areas of subsidence, and no active volcanoes within them.
On the principle now advanced, of subsidences of large
areas of the earth?s crust at one end, from a comparatively
stationary axis at the opposite end, the above circumstances
would seem to result as a matter of necessity. Deferring again
to a portion of the earth?s crust, in the form supposed to exist
in the section through the tropic of Capricorn (fig. 3), it will be

seen that the effect of the mutual pressure which must exist
amongst the segments is to cause an upheaval at the sides
opposite to the depressed sides. Suppose A, B, C, D, and E,
F, G, H to be any two of such six segments, or any two of any
number of segments extending round the earth, with their
sides mutually resting on each other, it will be evident, on in-
spection, that any force which acted so as to depress the seg-
ments at A and H would tend to raise them at B and F. The
rents between all these segments would, we might expect, be
filled with the molten interior, and volcanoes or eruptions of
trap might exist along the lines of rent. The volcanoes along
the rents of upheaval might well be active ; for we can perceive


no reason why they should not be; those along the rent of de-
pression would be extinct; because this would be the natural
effect of submerging an active volcano for centuries in the
depths of the ocean. The water would have access to cool
and solidify the molten matter in the rent. Were the greatest
active volcano in the world, Kilanea on Hawaii, to be sub-
merged, together with the whole island, to the depth of one
mile below the surface, we can imagine the effect a few thou-
sand years might have upon it; but with Kilanea one mile
below the surface, Mannakea would still exist above it, an ex-
tinct volcanic island 4000 feet high. Such extinct volcanic
islands are commonly found in the central portions of oceans,
or in the central lines of areas of depression.
The low line of volcanoes, active and extinct, in the Sand-
wich Islands, is situated upon a line of upheaval between
two areas, one of known subsidence (the old region), and one
of deep sea (assumed subsidence). The principal active vol-
cano, Kilanea, is unique in the phenomena it presents ; nor can
they be accounted for on any theory hitherto advanced as to
the moving cause in volcanoes generally. The only supposition
approximating to probability, in the case of other volcanoes,
viz., that of the waters of the ocean obtaining access to the mol-
ten interior, here fails. There is no outburst of steam, vapours,
or gases whatever. The greatest amount of vapour that is ever
seen or noticed in any way may be fully accounted for by the
rills of fresh water which may percolate amongst the heated
rocks. Nothing is seen but a comparatively quiet unfathom-
able lake of liquid stone. This great lake has its tides, which
rise or fall hundreds of feet with fearful calmness. The
greatest eruptions are the quietest; thousands of acres of land
may be covered hundreds of feet thick with the molten lava,
and the inhabitants a few miles off know nothing at all about
it. If the rise of such enormous masses were caused by ex-
panding vapours, we ought to see or hear something of them
now and then. The roar of the escape of the steam which
could produce such tremendous mechanical effects as are con-
stantly produced on Manua Loa, would be heard over the
whole group; and it would surely sometimes escape after
doing its work. No such instance has ever been recorded. I
do not hesitate to say that steam, vapour, or gases, are no


more the cause of the great movements of the lavas on Hawaii
than the dust which accompanies the movement of an army is
the cause of its march. In this, as probably in other vol-
canoes, and as in thousands of other instances, cause and effect
have been confounded.
The great rises and falls of molten matter in the rents of
the earth which are or may be open to the surface on Manua
Loa, may perhaps be looked upon as simply the varying
height of a column of liquid matter connected with the liquid
interior, depending on the pressure of the nearest segments of
the earth?s crust on that interior, modified by the tempera-
ture, and constant liquidity or viscidity, by the varying
amount of the pressure of the atmosphere, and by the form,
perhaps a varying one, of the communicating rent or orifice.
As we find a steady succession of outpourings have occurred
for many ages past, and as we know that a steady subsidence
of an adjoining area of the earth?s crust has also being going
on during the same time, may not a succession of minute sub-
sidences of a segment, as above supposed, have been the pri-
mary cause of corresponding small rises in the column of lava
and of the consequent regular overflows ?
As J. D. Dana, the Geologist to the United States Explor-
ing Expedition, and the last person who, I believe, has scien-
tifically inquired into the causes and phenomena of this vol-
cano, advances with considerable detail and ingenuity the
opposite opinion to this; that is, he argues that the rise of
the lavas is due to the steam, vapours, or gases arising from
the access of fresh water to the column of lava in the rent or
conduit; it may be necessary for me to state my view of the
causes of the principal phenomena which he attributes to the
action of expanding vapours.
And first, with respect to the ? boiling motion? in the
great lake ; ? the flow of the lavas in an unceasing current to
the south-west,? he observes of it, ? the steam is seen to move
on at a rate which has been estimated at three and a half
miles per hour.? This motion he agrees with Mr I. Coan in
comparing to that of a boiling cauldron ; for he says ?it can
be nothing else.? That there may be a certain amount of
vapour escaping from this lava, arising from the access of
fresh water to portions of the column near the surface parti-


cularly, is not improbable ; but that this constant, regular, and
steady motion in one direction is caused by such escaping
vapours may well be doubted.
I would suggest, whether the cooling of the exposed surface
of this molten lake would not cause the cooled, and conse-
quently heavier, portions to descend (as in water), to be
replaced by the hotter and therefore specifically lighter
portions, from the comparatively inexhaustible supply of the
molten interior. This action might, and probably would,
assume the form of a current, the direction of which would
depend upon the form of the sides of the conduit. The differ-
ent angle of inclination of the sides, for instance, might easily
be supposed to produce a surface current.
The other remarkable phenomenon, for which it seems at first
sight extremely difficult to account, is this ; that whilst the pro-
bability is, that the conduits of Kilanea and of Mokuweoweo
(the summit crater of Manua Loa) must unite at some depth
beneath the surface, both being filled with a liquid, the column
of lava in the latter often stands nearly ten thousand feet
above that of the former, without even sensibly affecting its
height or action.
Dana supposes that the lava in one column may be more
inflated with vapours and gases than that in the other; and
therefore being, on the whole, specifically lighter, a longer
column would balance a shorter one.
Without pretending to say that this inflation may not exist
to a certain extent in the upper portions of the column, and
therefore have some partial effect, I would suggest another
cause, which seems to require no supposition, but what must be
a necessary result of the facts of the case.
The sketch given in Dana?s work represents a section of
Manua Loa, showing the proportionate slopes and distances
on the surface, and the width of the craters of the two vol-
canoes, all according to scale, as determined by the officers
of the Expedition. The lines representing the sections of the
conduits are of course imaginary, but may fairly be expected
to give a probable representation of their form.
There can be little doubt that the conduit of the summit
crater (being the main and the largest crater, and the effects
resulting from it having vastly exceeded those of Kilanea), is


also much the larger of the two. Now, in two conduits sup-
posed to be connected, with the same heated liquid mass of
fixed temperature, the temperature in the wider one would,
other things being equal, be higher than in that of the other,
in proportion to the squares of their diameters, or in the pro-
portion of the mass to the amount of cooling surface.
The rest follows of necessity from this fact, which is also a
necessity. A column of cold water will balance a longer
column of hot water where the difference in temperature is
only perhaps 150�, how much more, then, must we expect a
column of molten lava of certain temperature to balance a
longer one of a temperature higher perhaps by 1000�. But
besides the actual difference in specific gravity which must
exist in the lava of the two columns, we must in this case
take into account the increased viscidity of the lava as the
temperature is lower ; that is to say, a pressure on the base of
the cooler and more viscid column, that would not sensibly
affect its height, on account of this comparative viscidity,
might raise the hotter and more liquid one a considerable
height. According as a liquid loses the theoretical properties
of a liquid, or becomes viscid, so it is less amenable to the
theoretical laws of liquids. Water itself is not a theoretically
perfect liquid, and in many practical cases, from the cohesion
of its particles, is not governed by the theoretical rules. How
much less, then, may we expect lava to be so. The difference
in the friction of the ascending hotter currents in two conduits
of different diameter, must be an important effect to be added
to the two already mentioned in causing a greater relative
reduction in the temperature of the lava in the narrower one.
These principles, as it appears to me, explain easily and natu-
rally this the most anomalous phenomenon in the eruptions of
Kilanea and Manua Loa.
It will be seen, first, that the column of lava in the summit
crater conduit may always stand many thousand feet higher
than in that of Kilanea, and yet never be visible, or its effects
be apparent, either in the crater or on any part of the moun-
tain. An outbreak, therefore, may occur through the sides
of the mountain, far above the level of Kilanea, without hav-
ing any other effect on the latter than perhaps lowering it.
It is ? the last hair that breaks the camel?s back and a very


slight rise in the column may rend the mountain, already and
for some time in a state of tension. Still, as before explained,
a considerable rise may take place in the lighter and more
fluid column of the greater conduit without sensibly affecting
that in the smaller. There can be no doubt that there ought
to exist a certain amount of correspondence between the move-
ment of the lava in the two columns, however different the
actual height; but how r are we able to detect it? The surface
level of the summit column is always far out of our sight,
except in a few fitful moments, when it rises to the bottom of
the crater. Or if, judging from an outburst through the sides
of the summit, we suppose the level to have risen, and hasten
to Kilanea to observe the effect, we find it lower than when we
last saw it. The outburst at the summit of Manua Loa has
lowered the column in that conduit, and that in Kilanea may
have fallen in consequence. The nature of the case supposed
?the lava in one column being invisible ?renders it all but
impracticable to detect the correspondence of movement in the
two conduits.
The eruptions in this mountain are far less noisy, and ac-
companied with fewer circumstances to astonish the senses,
than in most instances, because, no doubt, as Dana says, the
lavas are far more liquid, and the vents are open. There are
no means of confining or entangling elastic vapours, ?effects
which probably are merely incidental to, and the results of,
the rise or overflow of vast masses of molten rock in all vol-
canoes, not their causes.
Dana asks, Why are the lavas of Hawaii more liquid than
those of most other volcanoes? He tries the fusibility, and finds
it no greater (if so great) than that of other lavas, and leaves
the question unanswered. The conduits, from the source of
the lava, are wider, judging from all the observed circum-
stances than those of any other known volcano. I have already,
shown that, under such circumstances, the temperature would
necessarily be higher, and consequently (cceteris paribus) the
liquidity greater than in any volcano with a conduit of less
diameter.
Were we at a loss to account for the great rises of the lavas
on Hawaii, without having recourse to the supposition of elastic
vapours, it will be pretty evident, from what has been said,


that any cause which produced a change in the relative tem-
perature of the two columns might produce a considerable
amount of variation in their height. That elastic vapours are
not the cause of these great rises, as supposed by Dana, I
have already offered some considerations; and, in conclusion,
I may recapitulate :?There are no evidences or appearances of
the escape of any such amount of elastic vapours as would be
at all commensurable with the tremendous effects produced.
No violent escapes, or explosions of steam on a large scale, are
noticed. The lavas that overflow are usually found to cool
compact and solid; few or no vesicles of entangled gases
occur, except in the mere scum of the lakes or pools, or in the
agitated surfaces of streams subject to varied and irregular
mechanical forces. All the most important phenomena and
motions can be better accounted for in other ways.
It may be observed, that Dana expressly excludes the
waters of the ocean from being considered the probable source
of the vapours; and in this we agree. The vapours from the
water of the rills derived from rain, are the only ones he
brings forward as likely to have any connection with the lavas
of the volcano. Now, it is probably far within the truth to
say (and an approximate calculation within certain limits may
be made), that the whole annual rain-fall over one hundred
square miles on Manua Loa might easily be evaporated from
the heated surface of rock round the circumference of the con-
duit of Kilanea, from the top down to the sea-level, only in
one fortnight. Further, were it all by some means accumu-
lated, and let on at once, around the sides of the conduit, it is
difficult to imagine how the resulting steam could affect,
become entangled with, or exert an efficient pressure on, the
column of lava. By whatever orifices the water entered, the
steam could escape; and supposing, in the worst case, that all
these orifices were filled with water, the elastic vapour would
have a column of lava on one side, and a column of water on
the other. A column of water double the height of that of
the lava would he blown into the air before affecting the
height of the column of lava one inch. This consideration
may also help to dispose of the effects of a percolation of water
from the ocean on a column of lava standing far above its
level.


Fig. 4.
The most important feature in this view of volcanoes appears
to be, that they may be the results of the movement of the
crust of the earth rather than the causes of it ?the latter
being an idea which seems to influence too powerfully many
geologists.
It is not difficult to perceive that, taking into view the gene-
ral shape of the crust of the southern hemisphere, as here
assumed to exist, that a powerful lateral pressure must be the
result of, and coexist with, the downward pressure in each seg-
ment, and that other mountain chains might he formed in each,
by this lateral pressure (besides the central ones). And, fur-
ther, as the subsidiary forces or effects would tend to be deve-
loped in the same relative portions of each segment; in accord-
ance with this we find the summits of smaller mountain chains,
bearing a very similar relative position and distance to the
main ones, in three relatively similar segments, viz., ?in the
Falkland Islands to the Andes, Madagascar to the ranges in
Africa, and New Zealand to that in Australia.
The straits between and about Tierra del Fuego and the
main land, and between Australia and Van Diemen?s Land,
are the necessary results of the first hypothesis advanced;
that is to say, a chain of mountains entering the ocean, or
emerging from it, at an angle, must leave the last one or two
peaks surrounded by water, thus :
1. Passes lowering. 2. Promontory. 3 and 4. Islands. 5. Rock. 6. Shoal.
7. Sloping Plain. 8. Sea-level, giving a conical form to the coast-line of plain
land. 9. Inclination of the whole surface of crust.
A similar effect is visible at the points of pyramidal outlines
of land all over the world.
It follows also on this view of the movement of segments of
the crust of the earth, that upheaval and depression might,
and probably would, coexist; that is to say, that whilst, for


instance, tlie chain of the Andes was being raised by lateral
pressure, the portion of the segment on which the Andes are
situated, may be falling at the southern end. The actual rise
or fall, then, of any particular spot would depend on the rate
of upheaval arising from lateral pressure, compared with the
rate of depression at one end, and the distance from the sta-
tionary axis.
It will thus be seen that one simple force gives rise to two
comparatively simple movements; but the visible effects of
these two simple movements may often appear extremely com-
plicated from one point of view,?that is, judging as we do
from former ocean-beds or shores. Within a comparatively
small area a varied rate of upheaval, a varied rate of depres-
sion, and stationary land, might exist, all caused by one force
and two movements.
Another effect, which must always complicate appearances
in our inquiries into the actual motion of the earth?s crust, is
the alteration of actual sea-level which every rise or subsi-
dence throughout the whole globe must produce. And this
must in many cases be important in amount. Suppose, for
the sake of illustration, that the enormous subsidence of the
Pacific area, pointed out by Darwin and Dana, had been the
only grand movement of the earth?s crust in recent times, or
since the tertiary epoch, it must have lowered the level of
the ocean over the whole globe between 400 and 500 feet.
This would have been alone sufficient to drain the waters of
the sea from off a large portion of all the tertiary basins in the
world, without these areas having undergone any upheaval
whatever. It is not pretended that this has been the case, but
is brought forward to show how such evidences of subsidence
and upheaval must necessarily be complicated and uncertain.
It seems probable, from a due consideration of the form and
direction of different areas of the earth?s crust, as here sup-
posed to exist, that the greatest depth of the ocean may have
been under-estimated ; for, taking the double slope (that is to
the southward, and also east or west) from the highest table-
lands of South America or Africa, to the level of the sea, and
imagining the same slope continued under the ocean, as far as
we can go south-eastward or south-westward towards the cen-


A
as
tral line of the ocean without coming upon the base of the
volcanic land, 40,000 to 50,000 feet seems to come within
the bounds of the probable depth. Somewhere in the Southern
Ocean, between latitudes 45� and 60�, at about equal distances
between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, that and Van
Diemen?s Land, or the latter and Cape Horn, will probably be
found to be the deepest portions of the ocean. In sounding
for greatest depths, care should be taken not to get in the line
of the volcanic islands.*
Although only indirectly connected with this subject, it may
be well to call the attention of ethnologists to the correspond-
ing circumstances of the correspondingly peculiar tribes which
exist at the southern extremities of the continents of America
and Africa, and perhaps of Australia or Van Diemen?s Land,
and that the anomalous circumstances may be connected with,
or perhaps accounted for, by the subsidence (in one case, or
upheaval in another) of their end of the continents.
Darwin, in his ?Voyage of a Naturalist,? speaking of the
Fuegians, says, ? Whilst beholding these savages, one asks,
Whence have they come ? What could have tempted, or what
change compelled, a tribe of men to leave the fine regions of
the north, to travel down the Cordillera or back-bone of Ame-
* A fair view to take in estimating generally the probable greatest depth of
the sea, all other means failing, seems to be, as explained in the following
sketch.

Draw any triangle with two equal sides (A, B, C), prolong the base, and make
the line C D bear the same relation to B C that the area of the sea does to the
area of the land (say three times the length). Bisect CDin E, and draw F E
perpendicularly to CD. Extend ACto E, and join ED, F E will represent
the probable proportion of the deepest depth of the sea to A G, the greatest
height of the land. Call the highest table-lands (before degradation), 15,000
feet, the depth of the sea (after allowing for sediment), would be 45,000 feet.


Rica, to invent and build canoes, which are not used by the
tribes of Chili, Peru, and Brazil, and then to enter on one
of the most inhospitable countries within the limits of the
globe V ?
Well may he ask this question ; and perhaps the answer
may be ?They have never done so. But rather, being once,
when the southern extremity of this continent was at a less
angle, the inhabitants of a plain region at the base of the
chain of the Andes, a rising ridge on a falling area, when
broad lands may have existed on each side of them, and when,
consequently, the climate was drier and warmer, the soil bet-
ter, and its productions abundant; their dwelling-place has,
through the course of unmarked ages, gradually, and to them
insensibly, subsided into the ocean. Their descendants are
left at last, on the narrow bases of the ridge, in a raw, moist
climate, barren soil, and with a deep and stormy strait between
them and the main land, now contracted and fully occupied by
its own tribes ; the necessity of the case compels them to in-
vent canoes, and obtain their subsistence by fishing. The al-
teration and inferiority of circumstances induces a correspond-
ing alteration in their physical appearance and condition.
Thus, although at the present day they are classed amongst
the lowest grade of savages, ? their features indicate relation
to the Araucans,? a far superior tribe, ? whose neighbours
they are.?*
As the subsidence of vast archipelagoes will account for
otherwise inexplicable circumstances in the existing facts of
the Polynesian race,t 80 niay the subsidence of continents ac-
count for anomalies in races of men in all regions of the globe.
No study is more likely to throw light on some of the most
notable phenomena of organized beings than that of the latest
movements of the crust of the earth, and the relation of the
sea to the land. In this instance, the peculiar cause, the pecu-
liar food, and the degraded state of the Fuegians, may be ne-
cessities imposed upon them by the laws of the cooling of the
planet on which they reside.
