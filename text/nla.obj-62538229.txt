PREFACE
The aim of this preface is to give to the British public, in a concise manner,
some information respecting one of England?s great Antipodean Colonies. The
Importance of the Australian settlements is apparent to anyone who has visited
them, or who from a distance has had occasion to make himself acquainted with
their advancement in national wealth, or to contemplate their immense natural
resources ?which at present are only in the infancy of development. The vast
proportion of the British public, however, know little of Australia?the ? Greater
Britain ?of the Southern seas?and it is hoped that the handbook distributed
by the South Australian Commission will be helpful in disseminating practical
information of service to all who are interested in the triumphs of British colonisa-
tion, but particularly to those who may contemplate a removal from the crowded
populations of the United Kingdom to the attractive fields presented by Britain?s
Colonies. It will not be the privilege of the writer to draw upon a rich historic
past for the story he has to tell. There may be open to him no daring military
achievements to invest his story with the glory of national renown; there may
be no venerable institutions or relics, with inspirations of reverence and wonder;
and there may be no magnificent literature to command the attention or awaken
the interest of the student and the scholar. Scarcely eighty years have passed
since South Australia was proclaimed a British Colony, and yet the record of this
time is full of interest to all who care to note the advancement of the Anglo-Saxon
stock. The bold enterprise, the indomitable pluck, the dogged perseverance, and
the love of freedom, which form such striking Characteristics of the British race,
have been called into full operation in the peaceful subjugation of primeval wastes
to the service of man, and their rapid transformation into a hive of human industry.
Few pages in the history of British colonisation are fuller of interest than those
which record the establishment and growth of these countries in the Southern
Hemisphere, that are vaguely known in Europe under the generic name of ? Aus-
tralia.? The story of how a handful of Britons have, within the cycle of a century,
founded countries that are rivalling Old World nations in wealth and power and
in the elegancies of advanced civilisation is instructive and inspiriting. It speaks
of the vigor and genius of the old stock reassertng itself in the younger strengtli
and ardent effort of the offshoots; and it shows how the same characteristics of
courage, sagacity, perseverance, industry, and prudence, which have made
Britain what she is, are operating in the development of these daughter-nations
under the Southern Cross. In these pages special attention will be drawn to one
of the seven States that form the Australasian possessions of Great Britam?the
State of South Australia.
In the year 1831 Captain Sturt ?one of the earliest Australian explorers
discovered the great Biver Murray,.which runs down into South Australia and
empties itself into the Southern Ocean; and, on his return to Sydney, gave a
glowing report of the fertile country he had seen at a distance, but was unable
to explore. In the early part of the same year a few gentlemen met in London


to discuss the propriety of founding, on the southern shores of Australia, a Colony
upon principles which at that time were advanced principles of Political Economy.
The promoters opened up negotiations with the Imperial Government, but were-
not successful, and the project fell through. The matter was not, however, allowed
to slumber very long. In 1834 the project was renewed, and in June of that year
a meeting of gentlemen was held at Exeter Hall, London, to discuss the principles
upon which the proposed settlement should be founded. Just at that time a scheme
of colonisation propounded by Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield was attracting atten-
tion. That gentleman, thoughtfully observing the course of events in the other
Australian Colonies, had come to the conclusion that land without the operation ?
of capital and labor was useless. He sought to give a fixed price to land ; to pro-
vide that land should only be sold, and not disposed of by free grants; and to
apply the proceeds of waste lands to the cost of importing labor from the crowded
cities and towns of the United Kingdom. These principles commended themselves
to the promoters, who, in 1834, secured the passing of an Act by the Imperial
Legislature authorising the Sovereign to erect one or more provinces in that part
of Australia lying between the 132 nd and 141 st meridians of east longitude, and
between the Southern Ocean and the 26th degree of south latitude. To the persons
who should reside within the said province or provinces was accorded freedom of
action ? they were not to he subject to the law or constitution of any other part of'
Australia ,* they were in a Sovereign State?not an offshoot of any other.
The first Commissioners appointed under the Act were eight in number, viz..
Colonel Torrens, F.R.S. (Chairman), and Messrs. W. A. Mackinnon, M.P., Jacob
Montefiore, W. Hutt, M.P., Geo. Palmer, jun., John Wright, Geo. Fife Angas, and
Samuel Mills.
The project of colonisation however, almost proved abortive. The Imperial
Act provided that a sum of �35,000 must be raised before the powers given under
the Act could be exercised, and the scheme hung fire. Just then, however, the
late Mr. George Fife Angas, who was one of the Commissioners, came to the rescue.
He formed an association known as ? The South Australian Company,? and,
resigning his commissionership, he assumed the chairmanship of the company.
This company subscribed the balance of capital required, and the scheme of colonisa-
tion proceeded. The late Sir James Hurtle Fisher was appointed Resident Com-
missioner in the Colony, and the late Colonel Light was sent out, as first Surveyor.
General, to choose a site for the capital, and push on the survey of the land for
settlers. In August, 1836, Colonel Light arrived at Kangaroo Island, and thence
he proceeded to the mainland east of St. Vincent?s Gulf, where he commenced his
work, and selected the present site of the capital?Adelaide. In the following
December the first Governor of South Australia?Captain Hindmarsh, R.N.?
arrived, and took possession of the land in the name of the Sovereign of England
on the 28th December, 1836, the anniversary of which day is always closely kept
as a public holiday.
Since the proclamation of the Province South Australia has witnessed many
changes in fortune, but through all her vicissitudes she has made substantial ad-
vancement. Some of the other Colonies have attained wealth and importance by
the discovery of rich goldfields, the development of which has enormously increased
their resources, besides attracting?as few other discoveries have the power of
doing?a large and able-bodied population from a distance. These resources of


?wealth and population, springing from adventitious circumstances, have made the
progress of some of the other Australian provinces quite phenomenal in its character.
The advancement of South Australia, on the other hand, has been achieved by
patience, endurance, industry, and enterprise. Although rich goldfields have not
been discovered, gold is found in many parts of the State, and the many pro-
ductive copper mines have poured out great mineral wealth; indeed, on more
than one occasion South Australia has made onward progress, due to rich yields
of copper from the far-famed Kapunda, Burra Burra, Moonta, Wallaroo, and other
mines.
South Australia is, with the single exception of Western Australia, the largest
in area of the Australian States, and it stretches across the whole island continent
from south to north. Its southern shores are washed by the Southern Ocean,
whilst the waters of the Indian Ocean lave its northern coasts. It touches all the
mainland States of Australia, being contiguous to New South Wales, Victoria,
and Queensland on the east, and is bounded on the west by the extensive State
of Western Australia, extending from latitude 38 p to 26�, between the 129 th and
141 st meridian of east longitude, and from latitude 26� to the northern coast,
between the 129 th and 139 th meridians. Running right up through the centre
of Australia, it covers an area extending from latitude 38� to latitude 11�, and
from the 129 th to the 141 st meridians of east longtiude. Twice since the establish-
ment of the State its limits have been extended. In 1861 a strip of land between
the boundaries of South and Western Australia, south of latitude 26�, was detached
from New South Wales and annexed to South Australia by the Imperial Legislature ;
and in 1863, after the adventurous journey of the gallant explorer, John McDouall
Stuart, across the heart of the Australian continent, the northern boundary of the
colony, which was originally the 26th parallel of latitude, was shifted to the northern
coastline, thus bringing within her borders the large area now known as ? The
Northern Territory.?
The area of South Australia (including the Northern Territory) is 578,361,600
acres, an area which affords ? ample scope and verge enough ? for an extensive
population. At the present date (December 31st, 1907) 14,503,181 acres (including
right of purchase leases, 4,579,418 acres) had been alienated, and 201,391,247
acres leased (chiefly for pastoral purposes), the remainder being available for
agricultural, pastoral, and mineral settlement.
The area of mineral land, or land held under mineral lease, is comparatively
small; so that, roughly speaking, the whole State may be divided into country
of two classes?agricultural and pastoral land. Of the alienated land, a very
large proportion is devoted to agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, market gerden-
ing, and like purposes, whilst the balance is used almost exclusively for raising
sheep and cattle. The liberalisation of the land laws, the common use of artificial
manures, and good seasons have given an enormous stimulus to agricultural
settlement, so that the area now under wheat is immensely larger than it was.
South Australia is an immense State with only a handful of people occupying
it.
The following information is gathered from the latest official statistical records.
The increase of population during the year 1907 was, by births 5,473, by immi-
gration 7,481, making the total number on the 31st of December 392,431 persons,
composed of 209,294 males and 183,137 females. In 1890 the population was

314,195, and in 1900 it was 357,099. The proportion of births per thousand of
the population was 23.97, the proportion of marriages 7.99 per thousand, and the
proportion of deaths 9.72 per thousand. The Australian death rate is the lowest
in the world.
The area of land alienated from the Crown in 1906 was 12,019,000 acres. The
area under cultivation was, in 1897, 2,604,122 acres; in 1906, 3,246,835 acres.
The production of wheat?the principal crop?during the last four years has
averaged over 16,000,000 bushels. In 1906 there were in the State?horses,
206,633; horned cattle, 325,724; sheep, 6,624,941. The shipment of wool
amounted in 1897 to the value of �995,395 ;in 1907 to �2,156,000. The production
of minerals amounted in 1897 to �300,851 ;in 1906 to �820,460. The production
of wine in 1907 was 2,441,504 gallons.
The value of imports amounted in 1897 to �7,126,385; in 1907, �12,120,000.
The value of exports amounted in 1897 to �6,928,415 ;in 1907, �13,700,000. The
proportion of imports from the United Kingdom in 1906 was �2,513,376, the balance
being from other places. The combined import and export trade of the State
was in 1897 �14,054,800; in 1907, �25,800,000.
The arrivals of shipping were, in 1906, British, 2,323,663 tons; foreign, 461,536
tons; total, 2,785,199 tons. The number of vessels belonging to Port Adelaide
were, in 1906, steamers, 101, tonnage 37,673 ; sailing vessels, 207, tonnage 19,321.
In 1897 the general revenue of the State amounted to �2,628,049; in 1900 it
was �2,700,000 ; and in 1907 it amounted to �3,195,285. The expenditure in 1906
upon public works was �499,132; a large proportion was provided from loan
funds.
The number of churches or chapels existing in 1906 was 1,151 ; the number of
sittings provided, 178,000; the number of Sunday schools was 857; teachers,
7,058; scholars, 66,794.
The number of public schools in 1906 was 708; scholars, 57,270; persons
employed in teaching, 1,426. Cost of department, exclusive of expenditure on
buildings, �145,000. In addition to these there are 215 private schools, with
9,700 scholars. There are 168 country institutes, which have libraries attached
to them containing an aggregate of 294,241 volumes.
In 1907 1,832 miles of railway were open for traffic; 11,497,000 passengers,
2,042,900 tons of goods were carried; receipts, �1,575,318; working expenses,
�868,005; capital cost of construction, �13,699,000 ; percentage of working ex-
penses to gross receipts, 55.10 ; percentage of net revenue to capital cost, 5.16.
Since the foundation of the State (in 1836) to 1906 products to the following value
have been exported : Wool, �65,687,475 ; wine, �1,744,012; breadstuffs,
�30,869,741; salt, �654,613 ; wattle bark, �1,792,237.
On June 30th, 1907, the banks held in deposits �13,237,900, or �35 3s. 6d. per
head of population.

NORTHERN TERRITORY.
Government Resident, His Honor Mr. Justice Herbert.
The Northern Territory is an immense tract of country bounded on
the south by the 26th parallel of latitude, on the east by the 138 th and
on the west by the 129 th meridian of east longitude, and stretches to
the Indian Ocean. It contains an area of 35,116,800 acres, and was
provisionally annexed by Royal Letters Patent to the Province of South
Australia in 1863. Settlement was commenced and 250,000 acres sold
(half in Adelaide and half in London) at 7s. 6d. per acre, in sections of
160 acres (with each section a town allotment of half an acre was sold at
the same price); but it was not until 1 869 that the Surveyor-General was
dispatched to complete the survey of 600,000 acres of land and to lay
out the site of Palmerston, the present capital. In 1872 the great
undertaking of uniting Adelaide and Port Darwin by an overland tele-
graph line was completed at a cost of half a million of money by the
colonists of South Australia, and cable communication direct with Great
Britain was established in Australia. In the neighborhood of Pine Creek
the men employed in making the telegraph line discovered gold reefs as
rich as any in the World. In 1884 the Transcontinental railway was com-
menced from Port Darwin and carried on to Pine Creek. Since then the
southern part of the line has been extended from Adelaide to Oodnadatta,
and a distance of about 1,200 miles yet remains to be laid. Meanwhile
negotiations are proceeding between the Commonwealth of Australia,
through the Federal Government, and the State of South Australia for
the acquisition of the Territory by the Commonwealth, and its transfer
(if accomplished) will decide the route to be taken to join the two ends
of the lines. If the transfer does not take place, the same pluck and
energy still exist amongst the colonists which enabled them as a small
community to erect and equip the Overland telegraph line, and will
enable them to complete the Transcontinental railway?by the State, if so
desired by the Parliament and the people of South Australia.
For a complete account of the resources of the
Northern Territory see the handbook issued by the
South Australian Government.
