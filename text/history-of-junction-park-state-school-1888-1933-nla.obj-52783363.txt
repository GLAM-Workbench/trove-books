JUNCTION PARK STATE SCHOOL.
INTRODUCTORY.
In presenting this history of the Junction Park State
School to the past and present scholars, I wish to mention that
a preparation of a history like this should have been the work
of “The Old Scholars’ Association,” which should have been
founded while Mr. Dempsey was Head Master. We feel sure
that this is one of Mr. Dempsey’s regrets, as Mr. Dempsey
says “that things done badly or left undone, regrets which
dwell with us old fellows in the evening of life.” Nevertheless,
such an association ought to exist, and the last of the past
scholars should join it and help the school that helped them.
Especially those who enjoyed the use of the swimming pool
should help all future pupils to secure the advantages freely
provided for themselves.
Every past and present scholar should secure a COPY of
this HISTORY, and should treasure the recital of a great and
splendid lesson in co-operation. For it was only by the public-
spirited co-operation of hundreds that the tiny cottage school,
of 1888, has grown to be one of the leading State Schools of
Queensland.
IN CONCLUSION.
We would like the readers of this School History not to
pass reading the advertisements, as we feel sure that the
residents can get just as good service as elsewhere.

FOUNDATION OF THE SCHOOL.
When the first section of Thompson 200 acre paddock was
sold a number of thrifty workers bought allotments and set
out to establish homes. The need of a school was soon felt—
the nearest being those at Yeronga, Coorparoo, and Dutton
Park (then called the “Jail School”). When the second sec-
tion began to be built on, a school on or near the estate be-
came a necessity, if only for the scores of “little toddlers.”
So, in April, 1888, a “Provisional” School for very young
pupils was set up in a rented four-roomed cottage in Oxford
Street. Mrs. K. Barry opened the school on Monday, 30th
April, 1888, with a registration of 52 pupils. By June 19th
the number of pupils had grown to 122, and an assistant
teacher, Miss S. J. Minnis, was appointed. Mrs. Barry and
her assistant carried on till 14th December, 1888, when the
registration had reached 173. The Committee soon found
themselves unable to pay the 10/- a week rent, and the Depart-
ment took over the tenancy. After a year of office the Building
Committee had failed to secure a site for a permanent school;
they had collected none of the necessary one-fifth cost of
building and furnishing, and they were £35 in debt. In Janu-


OLD SCHOOL.— The first public school held in Oxford Street, Thompson Estate, and was opened in April, 1888, with an attendance of 60 pupils.
The staff consisted of Mr, J. J. Dempsey and 4 assistants, only one of whom, Miss J. E. Brown, Is still connected with the school. This old
school house is now a private residence.


J. J. DEMPSEY, Past Head Master.
ary, 1889, the Department decided that a change was impera-
tive. I was offered the appointment, and was placed in charge,
with Miss Jessie Brown as a young assistant. The latter has
served the school continuously ever since. The “provisional”
school took on new life. A new and. live committee took office,
with Mr. W. Stephens, M.L.A., as chairman, and the late Rev.
H. Molesworth as secretary. An active canvas began for sub-
scriptions for a permanent State school, the list being headed
by Mr. Stephens with 25 guineas. Meantime the school rapidly
increased, doubling its roll in the first three months. The
cottage provided room for 80 pupils, and when its walls were
bulging out to hold 200, a move was made to the Regent Street
Hall in August, 1889. Here the school remained till March,
1891. Temporary sheds were twice added to hold the increas-
ing attendance.
THE BATTLE OF THE SITES.
No land had been dedicated for a school by the vendors
of the estate, and strife soon arose as to where the school should
be built. In Marquis Street, 3 roods, price £2OO, was turned
down by the Minister—not high and dry; Regent Street Hall
—area inadequate, only 16 perches, and too near Dutton Park
School; the empty Diamantina Orphanage and 15 acres—too
near Dutton Park; Hislop’s paddock, Annerley Road—position
bleak and exposed, and the land much too uneven for a play-
ground ; three roods in Emperor Street, £550 —area inadequate,
but the Minister would accept it if the promoters would pro-
vide £llO-—one-fifth of the cost. They failed to do so, and the
offer lapsed, fortunately as it proved. Mr. Stephens then se


cured five acres, free, opposite the Junction Hotel, and this
was accepted in spite- of strenuous opposition from a rival
committee. The Stephen's Divisional Board, however, refused
to include in their gift the frontage to the Main Ipswich Road,
and hereupon the Minister refused to build the school there.
The Committee had then to convince him that the school would
be much better not to be placed on a main traffic road. The
rival committe attacked the site as unhealthy, but at last it
was gazetted a school reserve, and plans were drawn for a
school of 150 children. During all this time “The Thompson”
and its school continued to grow and fresh plans were drawn'—
this time for 250 pupils. But in the interval the ‘ ‘ provisional ’ ;
school topped 300. So a third school was planned for 450
pupils, and estimated to cost £3,500, requiring the people to
provide one-fifth cost —£700. But tin 1 Committee had only £2OO
in hand, so it was agreed to build, at first, only the central
portion, and to add the two wings of the quadrangle as funds
permitted. A tender for £l,BlB was accepted; Mr. Stephens
gave his guarantee for the balance (some £175) and, in Oc-
tober, 1890, a great picnic on the grounds celebrated the be-
ginning of the work, which was completed in March following.
THE NEW SCHOOL.
On March 31st, 1891, the school assembled for the last time
on its borrowed half acre drill ground in Regent Street, formed
up in fours, and, amid cheering, singing, and waving of flags,
handkerchiefs, and school bags, marched to the new school,
where another 100 “nowics” were awaiting for enrolment. It
was undoubtedly a great and memorable day; and did not the
boys and girls revel in the freedom of five unfenced acres in
exchange for “the borrowed half acre.* ' Even opponents now
admitted the wise foresight of Mr. Stephens and the Com-
mittee in standing out for a large area and a high and dry
position. In about a week the school was in full swing, and
three new teachers were added to an already large staff.
INSUFFICIENT TEACHING ROOM.
Throughout almost its whole history the school has been
hampered by want of teaching room. The new school provided
seating for 280 children, but 425 attended on the first day, and
in a few weeks the school settled down to a daily average of
480. The Committee pressed for additions, but were reminded
that they owed £175; ‘‘when that sum was collected they might
renew their request.” Followed next the hard time of 1892
and the crisis of 1893, and still no additional building. ‘‘You
can have an addition free, when you lodge the balance of the

<lebt. ” Well, the hour brought the men for the difficulty. A
great committee, led by Geo. Robson, Chas. Round, and myself,
organised two great displays of fireworks, and Mr. and Mrs.
Denham arranged several dances and concerts. The debt dis-
appeared. and the school was re-named “Junction Park.” At
last the way was clear! Plans were got ready for the present
“A” room (long known as the Round Room), when, to every-
body's surprise, the Committee were asked for £9O to enable a
tender to be accepted. A long and angry correspondence re-
sulted. The Minister was bluntly reminded of his promise of
a free addition. He was later charged that by his breach of
promise and delay he had caused the death of one child, and
great discomfort and suffering to children and teachers from
bleak winter winds. At last the Department surrendered, the
room was built, and the school could now nearly hold the at-
tendance, only three classes having to be taught in the base-
ment.
EARLY IMPROVEMENTS.
The new school ground was in a very rough state, covered
with hundreds of stumps; it was unfenced, and remained so
for years. Cattle, horses, dogs, and goats roamed at will. In
the classes under the school it was necessary to have an extra
monitor to chase fowls and ducks out of the class. The owners
of these intruders claimed that the ground being public prop-
erty they had a right to so use it. To get rid of the continued
nuisance I bought several loads of palings, and hired a man in
midwinter week to help me to fence one side of the grounds,
and we thus secured peace at a price. In May, 1891, we were
ready for our first Arbor Day, and the first 20 trees were
planted. The school was photographed, and many groups of
children also were taken. Other plantings followed in succeed-
ing years, and by degrees temporary fences enclosed the
ground. There was no outlet towards Thompson Estate, so to
give access from Gowrie Street an allotment was bought for
£4O (the old swimming pool now stands on it). Mr. Cockerill
and the Deposit Bank allowed the scholars to cross their pad-
docks, but when these paddocks began to be built on I saw that
a permanent road must be secured. The local board would not
act, so in 1894 I bought six allotments to keep as a permanent
road from King Street to the school. Years afterwards one
of the six was taken into the extended school ground, two were
taken over at first cost by the School Committee, and three by
the Shire Council. (There was never any mention of all the
rates I had paid on them). This road saves a long detour, and
avoids the dangerous traffic of Ipswich Road. (A similar road

■giving direct access on the southern side was provided in the
early 20’s at the instance of Councillor H. A. Manahan). Mr.
Chas. Stock, school caretaker, made a fine parade ground in his
spare time. It was done a barrowful at a time, and took 15
months. Another great improvement was the drainage and
partial filling up of the boys’ playground by about two feet,
getting rid of two large waterholes and a dangerous old well
—thus making possible a good second playing ground. For
years we used Mr. Stephens’s paddock for our first cricket
grounds.
ENLARGING THE RESERVE.
Acting on a hint from a former Under Secretary I began
a scheme for the purchase of 19 allotments, between our old
north fence and Gowrie Street. He thought that when the bad
times passed the Department and Committee might buy the
land as an addition to an already large play ground, and to
present the possibility of 19 back yards abutting on the school
ground. It was a long and tedious job to secure so many sep-
arate properties (some with houses on), especially as no one
must know why the land was being acquired, and as I must
buy each allotment when it came into the market whether I
had the money or not. Most of the scheme I carried through
with occasional help from Mr; Denham and with the aid of
useful information given by Mr. John Hill, the first Shire Clerk.
All but three allotments fronting Gowrie Street have been
added to the School Reserve. There was a net loss of a few
hundred on the whole transaction, but it was spread over 14
years, so I did not feel it very severely. The main thing was
the success of so much of the scheme. Part of the added land
afforded room for two tennis courts built by old scholars, led
by Harold and Jim Fowles and Arthur Sailer (the Annerley
Tennis Club). Later the courts and equipment were given to
the school.
THE TEACHING OF SWIMMING.
I have always believed in the schools teaching swimming.
At first we used a waterhole in Toohey’s paddock, and later
we dammed back part of Ekibin Creek, but a case of typhoid
among our boys led to an embargo on the creek, and we began
to journey to Peel Street Baths twice a week for practice. It
was costly both in time and money. The extension of the
water main to Gowrie Street made possible the idea of a pool
in the school ground; so we set to work. Mr. Jas. Law gave
a sovereign to start it, and the cadet company led by Mr. W.
Weeks, gave a benefit concert, and thus was started the move

ment that has since spread to so many schools in this State
and N.S.W. Gradually the fund grew. Mr. Denham, Premier,
and the late Mr. Barnes, our Minister, helped the scheme
along. A long correspondence was followed by a promise to
assist with pound for pound up to £BO, payable on completion
of the “Recreation Shed.” With our own £BO in hand and £9O
lent by Mr. Denham, a start was made on a design by Mr. W.
Juster. When the Inspector of Works came to see the finished
Recreation “Shed” he reported that it had no roof and the
floor was made of water, but the work was passed, the £BO was
paid to us, and the loan of £9O then repaid. In February, 1911,
Mr. Barnes opened the pool, and since that time over 2,000
new swimmers have there learned the art. At first the school
paid for the water used, the chief reason for building a small
pool; but later the Department undertook the cost. Thus was
removed one obstacle to the building of a new and spacious
pool. No other outlay by our people has proved so profitable
an investment. It pays large dividends in health, enjoyment,
bodily growth, and safety from drowning accidents. In a way,
too, the pool is a memorial to four of our youngest boys, who
were drowned on Baynes’s paddock in 1890.
LATER DEVELOPMENTS.
The continued growth of the school called for more and
still more additions (always with one-fifth of the cost paid by
the Committee). First “E” room was doubled in size, and
“P” room added (the latter was later enlarged twice), and
the basement, “G” room, added. When still more room was
needed the Committee decided not to mass any more children
on the original site, but to begin what might grow into a sep-
arate infants’ school. Messrs. Juster and Marshall, at my in-
stigation, submitted a plan for a new type of class room, with
blank front and back walls, end lighting, and 10ft. verandahs.
Again opposition, long correspondence, deputation, and then
“J” room for infants. The new type became at once the stand-
ard type for State school class rooms. Later the two-storey
building (“K” and “L” rooms) was added on similar lines.
Notwithstanding the building of new schools suggested by
me at Buranda and Weillers Hill, the school outgrew all these
rooms, and again the unsuitable basement room came into use.
A new room was planned near the north gate, and the old
buildings were to have much needed repairs at last. For some
mysterious reason there followed delay after delay, but after
my retirement the work was begun and the old building re-
paired and altered in some places as well. The opening of

CONCLUSION.
During its 44 years of existence, some 10,600 have passed
through the school, and some 200 different teachers and pupil
teachers have helped to shape the lives of its pupils. To them
it is a matter of pride that of the grown-up boys and girls so
very, very few have ever figured as breakers of the law. No
one can say how far the influence of a teacher like Miss Brown
has helped to mould for good the lives of the girls who passed
through her hands. Similarly, I recall the fine influence of
teachers like Misses Mulveny, -lane Faulkner, and Mabel
Charlton; while numberless boys will carry through their lives
and transmit to others the fine Christian and manly influence
of such men as John Campbell, “Bill” Clarkson, and George
Mel -.earn The school honour board, recording over 300 boys,
who served King and Country in the Great War, is an im-
perishable testimony to the school, the teachers, and the parents
who trained them. “For their name liveth for ever.”

THE PRESENT HEADMASTER.
On the retirement of Mr. J. J. Dempsey, October, 1923, the
school was placed in charge of acting head teacher, Mr. Dan
Joyce. The present head teacher. Mr. T. G. Fisher, took the
school over on January Ist, 1924.

SCHOOL SPORT.
The school has taken a very prominent part in all sporting
activities. In the various inter-school competitions arranged,
the girls and boys of Junction Park have met with more than
an average amount of success. The children enter into the
games wholeheartedly, and the physical and moral training
derived therefrom have done much to foster the fine “School”
spirit which is no necessary for the smooth working of a school
of the size of Junction Park. The school is well provided with
sporting facilities. There are three tennis courts (one being
in course of formation), a concrete cricket pitch, two basket
ball courts, two swimming pools.
Every branch of sport is well catered for and the school
Committees have- been pleased to render willing financial as-
sistance so that the various games may be played under the
best possible conditions. At a conference between the Com-
mittee and the sporting teachers of the school, it was decided
to set aside the sum of £5O per annum for this very important
branch of education.
The following table shows the outstanding performances
of the various clubs during the three years ending 31st Dec-
ember, 1928: —
1926.
1. Girls won “Morrow” Shield, All Schools’ Carnival,
Friendly Societies’ Day.
