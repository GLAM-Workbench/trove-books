Newcastle is said to be the second city of importance in N.S.W. Situated at the mouth of the Hunter River, has a pre-
sent population of 13,000, the population of the district being 79>000. This city has, during the last two years, made phen-
omenal progress. Chiefly among the new industries being established in the district are the Broken Hill .Proprietary Us
Steel Works, now in course of construction at Port Waratah, and estimated to cost approximately one million pounds when
completed These works will, when in full swing, employ a considerable number of hands. Then there is the British
Australian Co’s Oil Works, now established at Hamilton and employing a large staff. There are also several large foundries,
Engineering Works and Factories in active operation. Building operations havee been very brisk during the year, more espec-
ially in the city where some very handsome business houses and Public Buildings have been erected. Also there has been
considerable suburban expansion. As a summer pleasure resort there could be nothing better than Newcastle and its
environs.
The city beaches and up-to-date baths are a delight to the young and old, and the same might be said of Lake Macquarie
with its delightful scenery and health giving atmosphere.. Another resort that is also worthy of mention is t e me 1
Beach, near Dudley, which is rapidly growing in popularity. All the pleasure resorts are easily accesib e y ram or >
and very convenient services are run during the summer season. The Port of Newcastle, usually filled with v
all parts of the world, presents a magnificent spectacle. The coal exports alone, in 1913, totalled 5,236, 21 ons > *
addition there is a large export trade done in Produce, Live Stock, Timber, Minerals and many other proc uc s. J
efficient tram service to and from the innumerable suburbs afford convenient facilities to the travelling pu 1 1C an•
people. The principal suburbs surrounding Newcastle are as follows: Stockton, which is fast becoming a asll , ,
dential quarter, lying across the harbour from Newcastle, and connected by a very convenient terry service , a s V
of Wickham, Hamilton, Mayfield, Waratah, Broadmeadow, Mere wether, Glebe, Lambton and Adamstown , n ■, ' f
Charlestown, Dudley, Boolaroo, Teralba, Cardiff, Spiers Point. The whole within easy distance of Newcas e, ,
exceptions, linked up by tram or train.
The principal otlying towns in the Newcastle District are; The old established town of \\ allsend-Plattsburg, with
a very large and increasing population. Here are situated the Wallsend C. Fit, Wallsend Tunnel, Co-Operative Colliery, and
several smaller collieries. Four miles further on is situated the town of Minmi, which is supported by J. and A. Brown s Back
Creek and Duckenfield Collieries. Leaving Minmi we next come to West Wallsend. This is a much younger town, and has
made very rapid progress, and boasts of carrying a very large population, which is supported by the Caledonian Company s
finely equipped West Wallsend and Killingworth Collieries, also by the Seaham Company’s well-known No. 1 and 2 Collieries.
West Wallsend lies approximately midway between Wallsend and Cooranbong, as shown on the road map. Killingworth town-
ship is approximately two miles from West Wallsend. These towns are served by a very efficient train and tram service from
Newcastle.
Journeying north from Newcastle, we pass through Hexham, Thornton, Tarro, and then to the old historic town of West
Maitland, with its rich agricultural river flats. Here farms are dotted in all directions. Maitland is rapidly becoming an
important commercial and industrial centre, through the development of the mines, and the opening of the North Coast Railway,
and has a promising future before it. Of late some magnificent buildings have been erected in and around the town, and other
big improvements are under way, notably the remodelling of the railway station. The Maitland Tram Service has been
added to extensively of late. The neighbouring town of East Maitland is connected by tram from West Maitland.
Further on we come to the town of Morpeth, situated on the banks of the Hunter River. It is principally,, a farming dis-
trict. Steamers call here daily from Newcastle and Sydney, with freight and merchandise consigned for the north. Their back

loading-consists chiefly of produce, live stock, and other products. From Morpeth steamers carry large numbers of excursionists
up the Paterson River, which is unrivalled for scenery.
Going north from Maitland we pass through Lochinvar, and thence to Greta, which, of late years, has made wonderful
progress. Here are situated the Whitburn, Broxburn, and Central Greta Collieries, in which a great deal of development is
in progress. miles farther on is the township of Branxton, situated in the midst of a large pastoral and agricultural dis-
trict. On the outskirts of Branxton stands the Rothbury Col liery now under vigorous development.
Going South from Maitland into the South Maitland Coalfields we come to the East Greta Co’s No. i and No. 2 Collieries,
which were the first opened on the field. These Collieries are in close proximity to the township of East Greta.
Continuing, we pass through the township of Hcddon Greta, and arrive at Kurri Kurri, which is about the present centre
of mining operations, and ranks next in importance to Cessnock. It has a population of 8,000 . The Pelaw Main .and Stanford
Merthyr Collieries are its principal support. Three miles from Kurri Kurri stands J. and A. Brown’s Richmond Main Colliery,
now in course of development, and which, when completed, will be by far the best on the field. It will rank in importance
among the leading collieries of the world. The Mines Department contemplate the establishment of a mining rescue station
at Kurri Kurri in the near future. The site has been chosen next to the Kurri Kurri P. 0., and a commencement will be
made with the work at an early date. The opening of this station will mark an important epoch in the history of mining,
not only on the Maitland field but also in the Commonwealth. Adjoining Kurri Kurri are the townships of Pelaw Main and
Stanford Merthyr. One and a half miles from Kurri is situated the town of Weston, which is supported by the Hebburn
Colliery, formerly owned by the A. A. Coy. and recently acquired by the Huddart-Parker Steamship Co.
Continuing on from Weston we pass through the small township of Mayfield and arrive at Abermain. This town is
supported by the Abermain Co’s No. 1 Colliery, situated in Abermain, and No. 2 Colliery situated three miles further South.
One and a half miles further on from Abermain lies the town ship of Neath, which has made rapid progress of late and is
supported by the Wickham and Bullock Island Co’s Neath Colliery. Leaving Neath we come to the principal town ot the
coalfields, Cessnock, having a population of 9,000, which is increasing rapidly. The principal support of the town proper
is the coal industry, but the surrounding country is rich in agricultural, viticultural, and other products. Indeed, much of
the soil, particularly that of the Mount View district, is equal to any to be found in the world. The wines produced in the
Cessnock district find a place in the world’s best markets.
The scenery of mountains and ravines surrounding Cessnock is enchanting, and, when its existence becomes better known,,
the district will be one of the principal tourist resorts of the Commonwealth.
S Cessnock was recently honored by the visit of a number of the leading Scientists of the world, who found there much to
interest them geologically and otherwise. That such distinguished people should find interest in Cessnock is sufficient to indicate
its importance.
The splendidly equipped collieries of the Caledonian Co’s Abcrdare and Aberdare Extended, both of which are in close
proximity to the town, provide employment for over i,joo men. The same Co. have another mine (South Aberdare) in course
of development, and a fourth mine to be opened near Cessnock shortly. The Bellbird Colliery, the property of the Hetton Coal Co.
is about three miles from Cessnock and adjoins the township of Bellbird. The opening of other mines is contemplated be-
tween Bellbird and Wollombi, and that district, right round to Ellalong, will probably' be the scene of extensive mining
operations in the near future. A railway will probably connect Cessnock by a short route to Sydney in a few years, and there
is every probability that another railway will be constructed from Cessnock to Killingworth
