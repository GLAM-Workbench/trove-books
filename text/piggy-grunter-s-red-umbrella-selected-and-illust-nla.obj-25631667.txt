PIGGY GRUNTER'S
RED UMBRELLA
One morning the Postman brought a parcel for
Piggy Crunter. It was covered with brown paper
and tied up with string-and Piggy was so excited
that he could scarcely wait to get it open.
I wonder what it can be!" he cried.
"I think I can guess, said his mother. "Its such
a tunny shape, it couldn t be anything but—
"I know!" cried Piggy. It's an umbrella!" And
yes, when he took off the paper and string there
was a beautiful red silk umbrella. A little card was
tied to the handle-.

TO PIGGY, WITH LOVE FROM HIS AUNT
MATILDA.

Piggy was very pleased.
I can use it in any sort of weather/' he said.
When it's raining I can use it to keep me dry,
and when it's not raining I can use it as a sun-
shade.
The very next day it was raining, and Piggy
took his umbrella to school with him in the
morning and brought it home again in the after-
noon, and didn't get a drop of water on his
clothes
That was
very good
present, said
his mother.
The next
day it was
tine again,
and Piggy
used the um-
brella as a


sunshade. It looked very bright and jolly in the
sunshine, and Piggy was proud of it.
No one else has such
he said.
beautiful umbrella,”
But the next morning when Piggy woke up he
found that it was very windy. The trees were
blowing sideways, the leaves were flying through
the air, and there were big white clouds hurrying
across the sky
You must leave
your umbrella at
home to-day,” said
Mrs. Crunter. The
wind might blow it
inside out.”
But Piggy pre-
tended not to hear.
He was a naughty
little pig sometimes

and didn t always do as he was told. So, when he
was ready for school, he ran and kissed his mother
good-bye and then took the umbrella and went
out through the back door so that his mother
didnt see him.
It was very windy out-of-doors. Piggy hurried
down the street and round the corner. Then he
tried to put up his umbrella. But the wind was
blowing so hard that for a long time he couldnt
open it. He puffed and he panted and grew quite
hot and red in the face, and still the umbrella
wouldn't open. But at last he turned his back to
the wind and
gave a great big
PUSH! and the
umbrella was
open.
Thank good-
ness! said Piggy.

But just then the wind gave a bigger PUSH!
and the next moment the umbrella went sailing
up into the air with Piggy hanging on to the handle!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! cried Piggy. Help! Help!'
He sailed up over the fences and down the road.
The Postman was walking along the footpath
with his bag of letters when he heard a litfle voice
up over his head:
"Help! Help!"
"Goodness me! cried the Postman, looking up.
Its Piggy Crunter!' He began to run along the
road, trying to catch Piggy by the leg, but PUFF!
went the wind, and Piggy and the umbrella sailed
up higher than ever.
A little further down the road the Baker was
driving his horse and cart along when he heard
Piggy calling out:

"Help! Help!
Save me!"
"Goodness
me!" cried the
Baker, looking
up. Its Mrs.
Crunter s little
boy!"
He stood up
in the cart and
made his horse
gallop down the road, but every time he put up
his hand to catch Piggy's foot the wind gave an-
other PUFF! and Piggy and the umbrella sailed
along faster than ever.
The Policeman at the corner heard the Baker's
horse galloping and his cart rattling along, and he
heard the Postman shouting out, so he turned
round to see what was happening. He could

scarcely believe his eyes when he saw Piggy away
up in the air, hanging on to the handle of his
umbrella, too breathless to cry for help any more.
The Policeman
put up his hand
and shouted:
"Stop! Stop!”
but poor Piggy
couldn't stop. The
wind was whirling
him along at a
great pace, and
all he could do
was hang on!
The Policeman
started to run
after him, and
there were the
three of them.

the Baker rattling ahead in his cart, the Policeman
running as fast as he could, blowing his whistle
whenever he could get enough breath to blow,
and the Postman panting along behind, with his
heavy bag of letters on his back.
Stop!' they all shouted. Stop!' But at that
very moment the wind gave a great big WHOOSH!
and lifted Piggy and the umbrella right up over
the tree tops and carried them away across the
paddocks out of sight!

Poor Piggy! He was afraid to look down because
it made him dizzy. He shut his eyes and hung on
and wished he d left his umbrella safely at home!
They went sailing along in the wind over treetops
and haystacks, across paddocks and fences. And
then at last the wind began to blow more gently.
Soon Piggy opened his eyes, because he felt
himself floating softly down. He could scarcely
believe it, but he was floating down-down-down on
to the ground!
Piggy looked around him and saw that he had
landed in a warm sunny paddock, and he was so
tired after his long journey, and his arms were aching
so much from hanging on to the umbrella all the
time, that he just lay down on the green grass and
went sound asleep.
But he didn t sleep very long. This was not just
an ordinary paddock. It was the paddock where
Farmer Trotter kept his prize bull, and Piggy had

not been asleep more than five minutes when the
bull saw him —and saw his red umbrella!
Now, you know bulls don t like red at any time.


Pat(<‘ SixltM‘l
and Farmer Trotters bull was feeling very cranky
that morning. When he saw Piggy lying there
under the red umbrella he began to snort and
blow hard through his nostrils. He pawed the
ground and tossed his head and bellowed loudly.
Piggy woke up with a start. What was that?' he
gasped. And then he saw the bull-with his head
down— coming towards him!
Piggy didn't waste a moment. He grasped his
umbrella, scrambled to his feet and ran for his life.
He forgot how tired he was -he ran faster than
he d ever run before-down the paddock, with the
bull close at his heels!
Poor Piggy! He was soon puffing and panting, it
hurt him to breathe, his legs were aching, and he
could hear the bull snorting just behind him. Suddenly
he saw an open gate in the fence in front of him.
He swerved through it, and found himself in another
paddock-a smaller one, with fences all round it.


Pag*
The bull was close behind him-Piggy made a wild
dive under the fence, and rolled through, just in
time! The bull caught up with him at that very
moment, and crashed into the fence.
Oh!" gnsped Piggy, oh!-what an escape!"
And then he heard a sudden shout and the noise
of a gate shutting. He staggered to his feet, and
saw that the gate into the smaller paddock had

been shut, and there was Farmer Trotter coming
towards him.
Oh dear!" thought Piggy, he'll be angry with me
because I upset his bull! I wish I had left my
umbrella at home this morning!"
But Farmer Trotter was smiling from ear to ear.
He patted Piggy on the back so hard that he
nearly fell over.
Well done, my boy!" he said. Well done! That
was as smart a piece of work as any I've seen!"
W-was it.
sir? stammered Piggy.


.Vinrltrn
It certainly was, said Farmer Trotter. "I've
been trying all the morning to get that bull of
mine into the small paddock so that I can catch
him to take him to the Show to-morrow—and then
you come along and do the job before I can say
Jack Robinson! How did you do it?
”1-1 just ran,' said Piggy.
"Ran! I should say you ran! Ive never seen

anything like it. You should enter in the cross-
country championship race.
While Farmer Trotter was talking his hand was
diving into his pocket.
Here s something for you, my boy.'
Piggy looked down, and there was a beautiful
shining new shilling in his hand! He had never had
so much money all at once in his life before.
Oh-thank you! he gasped.
That's all right, that's all right,' said Farmer
Trotter. If my bull takes a prize at the Show
to-morrow I'll send you five shillings. What s your
name?
Piggy was thinking of five whole shillings all
at once, and he could scarcely find his voice.

"P-P-Piggy Crunter,” he stammered.
'Piggy Crunter, said Farmer Trotter, and a fine
name, too. Clad to know you, my boy. Clad to
know you.
