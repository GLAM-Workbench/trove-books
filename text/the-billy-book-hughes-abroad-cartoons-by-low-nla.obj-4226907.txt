CUTTING UP A CORNISH MULTITUBULAR BOILER.
A Practically Impossible Operation Made Easy by the Oxygen Metal Cutting Apparatus.
"S
PACE and Time, its invisible brother, are
perhaps the two greatest enemies of man-
kind," writes Maurice Maeterlinck, the
Belgian.
To-day above all, in the greater fields of
engineering in Europe and America, it is a race
against Time. Ships and more ships! Repairs
and more repairs ! All resources are directed
to speed and efficiency.
Here is where Oxygen is playing a giants' part.
It slices and forms steel plates with no more
effort than it takes to manipulate a piece of
gold wire in the jeweller's workshop. It welds
great fractures and saves priceless days for the
Allies.
But the ordinary, everyday business of Oxygen
is also immense. Old ships, steel and iron
structures, Boilers, Tanks, etc., are easily cut to
pieces—jobs that hitherto were not only pro-
fitless undertakings, but more often utterly im-
possible.
There is no cutting or welding of metal that
Oxy-Acetylene will not handle—from the
building of an ocean going leviathan to the re-
pairing of a simple break in a farm implement.
All over the world, Oxygen is at work in ship-
building yards, Mines, Engineering establish-
ments, Foundries, Motor Garages and Work-
shops; making big jobs into little jobs and
preventing little troubles from getting big.
We were the pioneers of the Oxygen industry in
Australia, and our plants are at work in almost
every corner of the Continent. We manufacture
Oxygen Metal Cutting Apparatus, Acetylene
Welding and Lead Burning Blowpipes, and
high and low pressure Gas Regulators.
We are interested in all the metal working pro-
blems mentioned above and will be pleased to
hear from vou.

FOREWORD.
IN presenting to the community a few sketches of William Morris Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia,
the artist has met with certain difficulties. His subject is a many-sided character, and anybody who
has tried to put all the aspects, including the underneath part, of a pyramid or a cube into one photograph
will understand what that means. He is mentally swift, and anybody who has tried to make a mai ble
statue or even a bust of a passing comet will understand what that involves. He has been many things
in his time —even, it is alleged, a veterinary surgeon. At all events, his absence from the political firing
line at a thrilling moment was ascribed to the fact that his cow was sick, and that he was busy
administering afternoon tea to the animal. All that can be done is to focus him Mr. Hughes,
not the animal when he is something, before he becomes something else or develops into almost
everything at once.
No attempt has been made to suggest what the versatile gentleman might have been if he
had been some other people. There exists a general feeling that as David ordered Joab to take a
referendum of the people, as Cincinnatus promoting agriculture, as Hannibal establishing a uniform railway
gauge over the Alps, as Frederick the Great defending his country solely out of revenue, as Casabianca
on the deck of the burning ship that was going to be built as soon as the materials arrived from America,
as Marius reluctantly but firmly accepting office for the fifth time, or as Rehoboam watching the gold
reserve leaving the country, he would have supplied a new reading of the part every time. But even a
brilliant politician can hardly be six widespread men and a boy as well as himself all in his own person.
The Commonwealth has had 14 Prime Ministers and Mr. Hughes has been four of them
consecutively. He has also been seven Attorneys-General and one Minister for External Affairs. Three
times while going out of office in two capacities he has met himself coming back to office in two
capacities, yet so well were things arranged that his twelve capacities (six leaving and six returning) never
obstructed traffic in the doorway. This frequent re-appearance has been styled "The Return of the Probable
Son," it being regarded as improbable that he would stay away. So long as there has been a
House of Representatives he has been in it, and sundry pessimists say he will outlive it as Cato
outlived the Republic, but not for the same reasons. His value in the public life of the country is
admitted by himself and others.
It has been alleged that if Mr. Hughes' temper was half as long as his continuance in office
it wouldn't be so short as it is ; that he is too busy hustling to do very much ; that it is impossible to
sit on any doorstep for half-an-hour without seeing him rush past on his way to extinguish his burning
country, with the coat-tails of his motor car streaming in the wind and leaving behind him a cloud
of dust, brown paper, sparks, terrified dogs, blown-off hats and the broken speed limit; also, that his
intentions are of the best, but that there are too many of them. It has even been declared that he is
unable to see a joke but, then, what is a joke? A French writer has declared that only two specimens
ever existed—an early Christian martyr on fire, which, of course, the Prime Minister, being comparativel>
young, didn't see, and a woman sitting down suddenly on an absent chair, a rare event which only
happens when the woman is buried in thought.
Every effort has been made to strike a happy, or at least not quite miserable-looking
medium, combining Mr. Hughes as he is and as the artist thinks he ought to be, with traces of him as
he might have been. The book may be described as an attempt to confer temporary immortality. The
permanent article is unattainable. Ihe first half of immortality is lost because people weren't born
before the Creation, and the second half is lost because they are forgotten before the Resurrection. With
both ends missing, the middle is hardly worth struggling for.

Henderson
WHAT the names of leading millinery creators like
Poiret and Georgette convey to " la chic Parisienne,"
the name Henderson likewise conveys to thousands of
fair Australians.
It is a symbol of individuality and quality—a mark by
which they identify the first Australian Millinery to be
developed to perfection.
The sale of Henderson Hats is a Quality pledge—thousands
of women know this now-a-days, and consequently do not hunt
around for hats ; they ask to see Henderson Hats, realising
that this name signifies everything desirable in Millinery.
Made in Australia and obtainable
at all leading millinery departments.

Our home is full of song;
We eat and drink and live and breathe
To music all day long.
For in the early morning,
When it's creepy still and dark,
McCormack starts the concert off,
As tuneful as a lark;
Then Schumann-Heink, and mother,
And Lauder, full of glee,
And Sarah in the kitchen,
Ranging squeakily to C.
They all seem to be warbling,
That they hear him calling me.
We fox-trot in to breakfast,
To the "Wicki Wacki Woo,"
With "A Little Bit of Heaven"
On a harp and 'cello, too:
And when the record's over,
Without a moment's rest,
The golden-voiced Caruso,
Deigns to soothe our savage breast;
Then father in his study,
Buried deep in legal clause,
And my wheezy Uncle William
Loosening up his ancient jaws—
They hum and buzz and whistle
Tunes from Tosca and Because !
And in the evening shadows,
While I learn my Latin prose,
I'm distracted by "Aida"
And a "Little trish Rose,"
Till the strains of martial music
Clear the atmosphere of cloud.
As "The Stars and Stripes Forever'
Burst upon us fine and loud;
Then mother dear, and father,
And my uncle, gaunt and gray,
And Sarah in the pantry
Putting cups and plates away,
And Rover softly howling,
Hail the end of perfect day.
Have Music in YOUR Home.
See deep enough and you see musically : the heart of nature
being everywhere if you can only read it Carlyle.
