THE AMPUTATION
They stitched me finely up when
you descended into
blinking light and bloody lap
I laboured hard
screamed
ten thousand cursed joyful tears
Allah√üuddha Jesus Mother
To bless I kissed the nape
of darkened head.
They stitched me finely up, tacking
neatly in my middle
four and score small silver teeth
and zipper catch
a girl!
a beating path
of emotion
tiny lips unlatched with every smile.
They stitched me finely, every edge
selecting purple thread
Slight pinching
by my left breast
puckers: You
along my side now
With calm fingering of zip
One tug... so deft...
I spill out
LISA MORISSET, i 995
