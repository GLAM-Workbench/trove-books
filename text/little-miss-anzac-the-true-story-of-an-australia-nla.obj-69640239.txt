LITTLE MISS ANZAC.
(MOLLY TELLS THE STORY.)
WOODENY COMES TO LIVE WITH ME.
My Woodeny has been to such lots of places, and
had so many things happen to her, that my Dadda
says I ought to tell all the other little girls and boys
about her. The things that happen to Woodeny my
Dadda calls ? adwentures."
When Woodeny first came to me I was just one
year old, and it was my birthday. Arta brought her
to me, and she looked just like what you see in the
picture at the beginning of this book.
She had lovely pink cheeks, red lips, nice black
hair, black eyes, and a long straight nose.
She was dressed in a white silk dress with red
spots, and a red sash and a lace frill, and a white
hat with lace and ribbon.
She had petticoats too, and little panty-wanties,
and you could take all her clothes off and put them
on again, because Arta had put buttons and button-
holes on.
It is a good thing when people?s clothes come on
and off, because then they can have nice baths.


Woodeny had her very first adwenture the day
Arta brought her to me.
There was a nice fence, and Woodeny used to
make such a lovely noise when you hit her against
the fence; but I hit her too hard, and her long nose
came off.
I cried, but Woodeny didn?t, and Arta said
Woodeny didn?t care so very much for a nose. Arta
painted her another nose with ink, and it got washed
off in the bath.
Woodeny?s legs and arms used to twist back-
wards and forwards, and that was dancing. I was
showing the little next-door boy how beautifully she
danced, and I twisted her legs too hard and they
came off; but it didn?t matter ?when her dress
was on she looked as if she had legs. But her
white and red dress got lost; I spilt some milk on
it and hung it on to the trees to dry, but the
wind blew it away. It went far over the ocean
beach, I think.
The next-door?s puppy chewed Woodeny?s hat,
because the hat wouldn?t keep on well, and I left it
in the yard.
Every day Woodeny came in my bath with me,
and I used to soap her all over.
She did enjoy her bath. I used to squeeze the
sponge all over her, and she used to swim all round
and round and round.
One day one of her arms came off. Arta said the

OFF, SO SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THIS NOW.

water washed it off; and when I was dressing her
in one of Mother?s veils her other arm came off.
Woodeny is just like this now
Isn?t she a pretty little thing ?
She doesn?t like dresses now; they are a bother
to her.
When I take her out I put a sash on her and
fasten it with a safety pin.
She has a bathing-gown made out of a bit of
towel, but we left it hanging on the hook at Coogee
baths.
WOODENY IN THE RAIN.
Woodeny always sleeps with me.
She cuddles up close to me in my cot, and never
kicks or anything.
One night I woke up in my cot and didn?t know
where I was.
Mother said I went to sleep in the train and
didn?t wake up when I was undressed, not even when
the prickly strings were undone. I had the bonnet
on that the lady puts too much starch in.
I felt about in the cot and couldn?t find Woodeny
anywhere, so I began to cry.
When Mother came in she said, ? What?s the
matter, dear ? ?
I said, ?I want my Woodeny; give me my
Woodeny.?


Mother said, ? I?ll get you Woodeny in the morn-
ing ; go to sleep now.?
?No; I want my Woodeny,? I said, and howled
and howled.
Mother said, ?You left Woodeny in the garden,
lam afraid. It is raining now; I can?t go out.?
? Oh, my Woodeny will get all wet and misable!
Give me Woodeny.?
I kept on asking dozens and dozens of times, and
at last Mother got up and brought Woodeny to me.
She couldn?t find her for a long time ?Woodeny
was hiding near the woodshed.
She was so wet when Mother brought her in we
had to dry her with towels, and put a piece of flannel
on her for a nightdress.
I did cuddle her up tight, and Mother gave me a
bit of chocolate and Woodeny a bit of chocolate.
Every night after that, when I was undressed,
Mother used to say, ? Now, will some one please find
Woodeny; I don?t want to be hunting for her at mid-
night again.?
And I always found Woodeny, because I did not
want her to get wet or be lonely without me.
ANOTHER HIDING-PLACE.
Once she was in the clothes-basket, and she was so
hard to find.
We tipped all the clothes out to find my sandals


POOR WOODENY WAS OUT IN THE RAIN,
HIDING BEHIND THE WOODSHED.

THEY TURNED THE
BASKET UPSIDE
DOWN, AND LITTLE
WOODENY FELL
OUT. SHE HAD
BEEN MINDING THE
SANDALS !


A TERRIBLE FRIGHT.
that Arta saw me throw in, and there was Woodeny
minding the sandals.
I throwed her in, but I didn?t remember.
Another time she was in the drawer, in Mother?s
muff. The muff was so soft and warm I thought it
would make Woodeny a nice little bed, just for a nap.
Woodeny always had a little nap in the daytime.
If I go out with Mother, Mother says we?ll have
too many parcels to carry Woodeny too.
That night we hunted and hunted. We opened
all the other drawers first, and we looked in the
clothes-basket where she had been before, and in the
woodshed, and under the sofas. Mother was so sur-
prised to find her in the muff. Pussy was in it too,
and a bit of chocolate I dropped, and all Dadda?s
studs that I?d been playing with.
He didn?t give me them to play with; I just
took them for Woodeny.
A TERRIBLE FRIGHT.
Woodeny had a very frightening adwenture after that.
Kate that used to wash the clothes went away,
and somebody I didn?t know came to wash them.
I was playing throwing clothes about ?it?s a lovely
game ?when I saw the lady putting Woodeny under
the copper with a lot of fire.
Fire is dangerous.


I cried very loud, and Mother came running out,
and I told her Woodeny was under the copper.
Mother got a poker quickly, and got her out
before she was burned.
And the lady who put her there said, ? I thought
it was only a bit of wood.?
Wasn't she naughty to say that ?
WOODENY?S FRIENDS.
I have a lot of little friends, and Woodeny has a lot
of little friends.
There is Isabel and Pussy, and Seedie and the
Elephant.
The Elephant used to sing when you pulled his
head, but I dropped him off the quay into the har-
bour, and he caught cold.
The boys got him out of the water, but he doesn?t
sing now.
Pussy is made of rag.
She is such a dear little thins!
She sleeps with me too, and she?s Woodeny?s little
sister.
But I was going to tell what a great friend of
W oodeny?s Joy is.
Joy came when W r oodeny was more than a year
old, and had no legs, or arms, or nose; but Joy had
lovely arms and legs.

THESE ARE WOODENY?S FRIENDS. THERE IS ISABEL
AND PUSSY, SEEDIE, AND THE ELEPHANT, AND JOY.


WOODENY IS LEFT AT HOME.
She was wax, and had golden hair like mine, only
you could pin her hat on to hers.
We had Joy for almost three days, and then I
dropped her over the balcony.
She got her pretty face all smashed up, but her
hair was not hurt.
Then she was so fond of Woodeny she gave
her her hair, and Arta tacked it on with golden
tacks.
We had to get Joy a brass head afterwards, but
they don?t wear hair on brass heads.
Woodeny looked lovely with her golden hair.
We used to comb it and comb it, and put lots of
hairpins in it.
But it all came off.
Arta said it was because Woodeny had so many
baths; but she bought her some more hair, dark
brown, and then we tacked that on.
She hasn?t any hair now, though.
It all seems to wear off.
WOODENY IS LEFT AT HOME.
Woodeny is very fond of travelling in the puff train,
and she has been to such lots of places.
Once we went to Narrabeen.
You go there in a tram and a boat and a coach.
Mother forgot to pack Woodeny, and when she un-


dressed me the first night I cried and cried, because
there was no Woodeny to snuggle up to me.
She was all by herself in the toy box at home.
She had no one at all to talk to, because Pussy
was downstairs on the dining-room mantelshelf.
Next day Dadda said he would go home and get
Woodeny, and bring her out on his bicycle. ?
I didn?t think Woodeny would like that, because
she had never been on a bicycle before; but I wanted
her very much, and I told Dadda he could.
Woodeny would be crying for me too, I suppose.
It was dark before Dadda came, but I went to
the gate to meet him.
Then I called out, ?Have you brought Woodeny??
and Dadda said, ?Yes; she is here, safe and sound.?
And where do you think she was ?
In Dadda?s pocket, standing on her head and
with no clothes.
She had been so frightened, and didn?t know
where she was coming to. Dadda forgot to tell
her.
But I gave her forty kisses and a nice bath and
a piece of chocolate after tea, and she was soon
laughing away.
I did hold her tight in bed that night, and she
nestled close to me.
After that, when we went travelling, I used to
pack Woodeny myself.

I PACKED DARLING WOODENY IN THE BLACK
BOX TO GO IN THE PUFF TRAIN.


WOODENY GOES TRAVELLING.
WOODENY GOES TRAVELLING.
When Mother brings out the black box and starts
putting my petticoats and dresses in I know we are
going in the puff train, and I bring Woodeny, and
pack her at once.
I make her a little bunk with a nice soft silk dress
for a pillow, and I put the French coat that has
wool on over her for a rug.
Then she sleeps so cosily till we get to the place.
Once we went to a town called Junee, and I
couldn?t see the black box with Woodeny in any-
where.
I asked Mother where it was.
Mother said it was in the Guard?s van.
The Guard is a kind man who minds the boxes,
and he was taking care of little Woodeny.
When we got to Junee I saw the black box put
out on the platform, and I wanted to open it and get
Woodeny; but Mother said no, she was in the very
bottom, and we?d crumple everything getting her out.
Then we went in a buggy, and didn?t take the
black box at all.
Dadda said as we were coming back the next
night it was not worth while; so we just took a small
bag, and left poor, poor Woodeny behind.
Mother said to try not to cry at bedtime about her,
because the people had heard I was a dear little girl,


and she didn?t want them to think I was not a dear
little girl.
So I was very brave, and didn?t cry.
I ate a lot of chocolate, and when you eat choco-
late you don?t cry.
Sometimes you do when you finish the last bit.
I was sleepy, and didn?t have time to cry after I?d
finished my bits. Four bits I had, because Woodeny
was at the station. Other nights I only have two.
But four bits make you very thirsty, and when
you?re thirsty you wake up and want a drink.
I woke up and called out for a drink of water;
and when Mother was getting it, I tried to feel for
Woodeny.
Then remembering that my dear little Woodeny
was in the black box on the Junee station I howled
very loud.
Dadda got up quickly and picked me out of the
bed, and carried me into the garden.
He went far away from the house, so that people
would not hear me howl, and sang songs to me.
But I wouldn?t listen, not even to ? Pom-Pom.?
"Pom-Pom?s? a lovely song when you?re not
misable, but it?s not any good when I can?t find
W oodeny.
I liked Dadda carrying me round the garden in
the middle of the night.
It was much better than being in bed.
Oh, Woodeny was glad to see me next day. She


thought I was lost, and I thought some one might
have taken her out of the box and kept her.
There was a bag of biscuits in the box, and she
hadn?t been hungry. I wouldn?t put her in the black
box any more.
I carried her in my arms everywhere I went, and
everybody talked to her, and said what a pretty little
thing she was.
ANOTHER JOURNEY.
Cootamundra?s a big word, but I can say it easily.
That?s a place we got to one time in the night,
and went away the next morning.
Woodeny got in the big bed at the hotel with
Mother and me, and we were all so cosy.
It was dark when the man came to the door and
said, ? It?s time to get up. The train goes in half
an hour.?
Mother put clothes on me very quickly, and I
didn?t quite wake up.
We got into a cab, and got out of the cab into the
train, and the man said the train would go in three
minutes.
Then I said, ?Mother, we didn?t bring Woodeny;
she?s on the hotel pillow.?
I cried the loudest cry a baby can cry, and Mother
said, ?Oh dear! oh dear! it?s too late now. Why
didn?t we think of her before ??


Then I cried and cried, and every one in the train
said, ? Poor little thing; ? and Mother said to the boy
who drove us in the cab to the station, ?
? Do you think, if I gave you a shilling, you could
drive back and get Woodeny off the pillow in our
room ? ?
And the boy said he would go back if Mother
would keep the train from starting. So he drove off
quickly, and Mother told the train man something
very valuable was coming, and the train man said
he would wait as long as he could.
Everybody in the carriage was hoping the boy
would be quick, and I stood on the seat to look out
the window for him.
At last the train man said he was afraid he must
let the train start; and the engine whistled very loudly
and the train began to move.
I was screaming as loud as the engine, because I
would never see Woodeny again; and just as the
train began to make the funny sound ? puff, puff,? that
it says when it begins to move, the boy came running
down the station with Woodeny in his pocket.
I could see her sticking out, and I danced and
kicked.
He had just time to throw her in the window, and
she fell on a fnan; but I ran over quickly and picked
her up, and she wasn?t hurt a bit.
I gave her forty, forty, forty kisses, and all the
people laughed.


HE HAD JUST TIME TO THROW HER IN AT THE
WINDOW, AND SHE FELL ON A MAN !






I GAVE MY DARLING WOODENY
FORTY, FORTY, FORTY KISSES.


WOODENY AND THE BUSH ANIMALS.
They said, ?Oh, is that what the .train waited
for?? And Mother told them what a pet Woodenv
was, and what a long time she had lived with us
and all the places she had been to. All the people
in the carriage held Woodeny for a little while but
I wanted her back quickly.
WOODENY AND THE BUSH ANIMALS.
We took Woodeny to Albury to see Aunt Emma
and she was very happy there.
She did not get lost once, and she had three new
sashes.
Then we went to a lovely place that?s called a
station, but it?s not a railway station. It?s called the
bush too, and the kind of animals there are gee-gees,
moo-cows, baa-lambs, birds, chook-chooks, swans,
possums, bow-wows, bunnies, bats, white butterflies,
and brown butterflies.
Woodeny thought it was a beautiful place.
There were lovely logs to have see-saws on, and
lots of flowers and trees.
I wouldn?t let Woodeny go too close to the moo-
cows, because they looked fierce.
The other animals always wanted to come and
see W oodeny, but Mother said they shouldn?t come
into bedrooms.
We were lying quietly in bed one night when we


heard a very frightening sound. We didn?t have my
cot, so Mother and Woodeny and I were all in one
bed. We looked up, and there was the pet possum
on the bed hangings just by Woodeny.
He had shiny black eyes, and he was looking at
Woodeny with them.
Mother screamed.
She doesn?t like possums in bedrooms, and said
?sha!? to him very loud, but he wouldn?t go out. He
just kept climbing round the doors and walls and
curtains.
Then at last he got on to the door that had a
window over it, like some doors have.
Mother got my umbrella ?it was a long stick that
I had turned into an umbrella that day?and poked
him gently to the top of the door.
When he got to the top she pushed him over to
the other side, and then closed the door window.
We could hear him scrambling down the other
side, and I laughed so much and danced so much on
the bed that Woodeny rolled right out of bed, and
got a dreadfully hard knock.
We had to put vaseline on her.
WOODENY GETS HURT.
The next morning we slept till long past breakfast-
time, because the possum and Woodeny had kept us

THERE WAS THE BOYS? PET POSSUM. HE HAD
SHINY BLACK EYES, AND HE WAS LOOKING
AT WOODENY WITH THEM.

WOODENY GETS HURT.
awake so long in the night, but we woke up when we
heard something scampering about.
I looked up, and there was the boys? pet baa-lamb
in the room.
He jumped up on the bed, and put his dreadfully
muddy paws right on Woodeny and on the clean
counterpane.
We said ?sha!? to him too, but he only knocked
Woodeny on to the floor.
I jumped out very quickly and got her up, else he
might have taken her away.
We chased the baa-lamb out with a towel,
and then I put some more vaseline on poor
Woodeny.
The next night it rained, and we all went to bed
early.
I cuddled up close to Woodeny, and told her a lot
of nice stories about the things I would buy her when
she was a big girl; and she was so happy.
We were nearly asleep when we heard a whining,
whinicking sound, something like a naughty baby, and
a scratching on the door.
We sat up in bed, and Mother struck a match and
made a light.
Just then the veranda door burst open, and a
bow-wow bounded in.
It was the little brown dog, Boris; but a good
thing it was not the big dog called May, that has long
legs, and barks very fiercely.


Boris was all wet and muddy, and began sniffing
at Woodeny, who was near the edge.
Mother said he thought Woodeny was a bone, and
was going to eat her.
This made me scream, and I picked up Woodeny
and put her under the pillow, and said ?shaEvery
fiercely to Boris; but Mother had to jump out of bed
and chase him out with a brush, and then she locked
the door and put a box against it, and then no dogs
could get in to bite Woodeny.
WOODENY FIGHTS A BAT.
The next night we were in bed, and no possums or
baa-lambs came, but a bat did.
We heard another funny noise.
Mother took the matches from under her pillow
and made it light, but couldn?t see anything anywhere.
I thought it might be the big dog, so I cuddled
Woodeny close to me.
Mother hunted and hunted, and at last she said,
? It?s behind the bed curtains; ? and she looked behind
the bed curtains and said, ? It?s a bat.?
I had never seen a bat before, and jumped up to
look, with Woodeny in my arms.
Mother took Woodeny from me, and poked the
bat out with her, and I cried, because I didn?t like
bats being poked with Woodeny.

THE JAGUAR THAT DID NOT COME.


LOST IN THE BUSH.
I?m sure it made Woodeny misable.
But Mother said she couldn't wait to get anything
else.
The bat flew round and round, and I put Woodeny
in a drawer for fear it might touch her again. Mother
opened the door, took my sash, and ? sha-ed ? the
bat out.
Then I took Woodeny out of the drawer, and we
all got into bed and put our heads under the sheets
and went to sleep.
Next night when we were going to bed Mother
said, ?Oh dear, I wonder what it will be to-night??
and I said I thought it would be a jaguar.
But it wasn?t.
Nothing at all came, and we were glad, because
Woodeny would be dreadfully frightened of a jaguar.
We got in another puff train and came home,
and there were no animals at home; but some-
times bow-wows and pussy cats came to see
Woodeny.
And we used to see goats in the street.
I like goats, and so does Woodeny.
LOST IN THE BUSH.
I think dear little Woodeny?s next adwenture was
the most dreadful of all.
I went in the train with Auntie Nanna to stay at


a beautiful place where there were no houses but
only trees.
When we got out of the train the station was
called Mumbil, and then we went miles and miles
in a buggy.
Woodeny likes driving very much, and likes to
hear me say ? Whoa ? and ? Gee-up ? to the gee-gees.
There was a big garden all round the house we
stayed at, and outside the fence there was big water
called a river. At the back there was the Bush, but
before you got to the Bush there were lovely shiny
stones you called pebbles that Woodeny and I and
the children that lived there used to play with.
We made gardens and houses and fences with
them.
One day the biggest little girl said we ought to
get some very big pebbles to build a house for the
queen of the fairies. We got right into the Bush
looking for them, and Nanna was frightened we were
lost and came to look for us.
It was dark when we got home, and, oh ! my poor
Woodeny had somehow been dropped on the way!
Nanna said I was too sleepy to remember where I
had seen her last, but we would all get up very early
in the morning and hunt for her.
We started to look for my poor child the very
moment the light came.
I here were Nanna and Mary and Bonny, and
Bonny?s grandfather, who is very kind and has very

WE STARTED TO LOOK FOR MY POOR CHILD THE
MOMENT THE LIGHT CAME. THERE WERE NANNA,

white hair, and the three big boys, and the gardener
and the puppy and me.
We looked everywhere all day, and I got more
and more misable, md everybody got more and more
misable because Woodeny was still lost in the Bush.
Then at night the grown-up people got lovely
things called lanterns and went out again, and said I
would be sure to find Woodeny on my pillow when
I woke in the morning; but I didn?t.
The next day we went out again, and then Nanna
said it was no good, Woodeny was gone for ever.
She said Woodeny was so much the colour of the
ground that it made it hard to find her.
Then it was nearly the next day, and Mary was
coaxing me to have bread and milk out of the blue
basin, and that was the prettiest of all the basins.
But I only had two bites because Woodeny was
lost.
Just then the gardener came in, smiling such a
nice smile, and holding dear, dear Woodeny up very
high in his arms, and said ; ? I found her lying on
some dead leaves under a tree, and she seems quite
well and happy.?
But I think she had been crying.
I gave her some bread and milk out of the blue
basin, and we ate up every teeny-weeny bit.
Nanna said I must put a red sash on Woodeny
when we take her in the Bush; but I?ll never drop
her again in a far-off place.


SEEDIE COMES TO LIVE WITH US.
Mother took me and Woodeny once to see a very
nice lady, and she gave me a lovely doll with a china
head and golden hair, and a blue-and-white silk dress.
? What is her name ? ? 1 asked her.
The lady said she hadn?t any name then, but per-
haps I?d like to call the dolly after her.
Her name was Seedie.
Mother said she thought she said Edie
But I think it was Seedie.
Seedie was lovely.
I took her clothes off and put her nightdress
on, and took her to bed with me, and forgot that
Woodeny was in Mother?s muff.
I put her there in the train, so as I could hold
Seedie nicely.
The next day I took Seedie for a walk in the park,
and didn?t take Woodeny; and I gave Seedie jam
and chocolate for her tea.
After tea I was having a game of running round,
and ran too quickly, and fell down on the garden and
hurt my knee.
I cried dreadfully, and when Mother ran to get
some vaseline I remembered Woodeny, and said, ? I
want my Woodeny. She?ll make it better.?
And they didn?t remember Woodeny was in the
muff for a long time, and then 1 ran and got her.


SEEDIE WAS LOVELY. I TOOK HER CLOTHES
OFF AND PUT HER NIGHTDRESS ON, AND
TOOK HER TO BED WITH ME. I FORGOT
THAT WOODENY WAS IN MOTHER?S MUFF.

WOODENY SITS FOR HER PHOTOGRAPH.
Poor Woodeny had been crying and crying all by
herself, and she didn?t like Seedie being in my cot.
Mother said, ? Do you like Woodeny better than
Seedie ??
And I said, ? Yes, Woodeny is the best, and Seedie
is the second best.?
Then I made Seedie a bed on cushions in a box,
and got into bed with Woodeny, and gave her a big
piece of chocolate.
Next day Seedie fell on the tiles, and got her head
broken up, so we haven?t got Seedie now, but we?ve
got her legs.
WOODENY SITS FOR HER PHOTOGRAPH.
The next adwenture Woodeny had was getting her
photo taken.
She went with Mother and me.
Mother wore a white dress, and I wore a white
dress, and Woodeny didn?t wear any dress, because
we wanted all the people who got the photo to know
it was Woodeny.
I stood on a chair, and Mother stood on the ground
just beside me.
I held Woodeny in my arms, and she kept so nice
and still.
The man said Woodeny was the best of us all.
Better than Mother and better than me.
We didn?t get the photos for such a long time.


When we did we could see Woodeny so nicely.
We could see her golden tacks that used to keep her
hair on, but you couldn t see her eyes, because she
was cuddling up to me.
THE FALLING DOWN ADWENTURE AND THE
ICE-CREAM ADWENTURE.
For a long time Woodeny and I had no frightening
adwentures, and then Mother and I took her in the
puff train to Brisbane.
I didn?t put her in the black box this time, because
Mother said we?d be dozens of hours in the train, and
there would be lots of tunnels, so I just carried her.
I got a little muff of my very own, and Woodeny
got into that.
I could feel her all the time in that, and she got
into the high bunk with me at night.
When we got to Brisbane we saw Nanna, and
Nanna was so glad to see Woodeny and me again.
We went to bed in Brisbane, and got up next day
and went to Nanna?s office, and went up very high
stairs.
There was a window in the office, and I put
Woodeny on the ledge, so as she could look into the
street; and I put her too near the edge, and she fell
out into the street, such a long way down.
I called out, ?Oh, Woodeny?s failed down!? and
Nanna ran as quickly as she could down all the


POOR WOODENY FELL DOWN !
AND DOWN ! AND DOWN !!

THE FALLING DOWN ADWENTURE.
stairs and out in the street, and found some cabmen
throwing Woodeny up in the air.
Nanna said, ? Please give me Woodeny,? and they
did, and they laughed and said they thought she was
a ninepin.
I wrapped Woodeny up in paper when I had
nursed her, and I said I would carry her home that
way, and be very gentle to her.
Next day Nanna took me and Woodeny to a
lovely ice-cream shop.
We had two ice creams, and they were beautiful.
When I was eating mine Woodeny dropped under
the table.
Nanna said, ? Don?t bother now; we?ll pick her up
after. Go on with your ice cream.?
And I did.
Then we went to meet Mother. Then we went
home, and I said, ?Oh, I haven?t got Woodeny!
Where is Woodeny??
And no one could tell me.
I cried and cried, and then Nanna remembered
her falling under the table.
There was a telephone in the house, and we rang
up a gentleman and told him to go for Woodeny to
the ice-cream shop.
Mother put me to bed, but I couldn?t go to sleep.
I sat up crying for Woodeny.
Just when I was very sleepy Nanna came running
and holding Woodeny up high.


The gentleman had got her from the ice-cream
shop.
The ladies that give you the ice cream said they
didn?t know what she was.
I hugged Woodeny very tight, and told Mother
Woodeny had too many adwentures.
For a long time after the ice-cream adwenture I
left her at home in my bed, but she was lonely all by
herself.
So now I take her out again, and am very careful.
I am glad we didn?t lose her in Brisbane.
Woodeny was so glad to get back to Sydney and
go swimming.
They haven?t much sea at Brisbane.
GOOD-BYE TO WOODENY.
Now I am making Woodeny a lot of new dresses,
because we are going travelling again.
I can sew now that I am three and a half, and
Woodeny likes the dresses I make her.
I make her a new dress every day.
I make them out of my old sashes and the patches
Arta gives me, and I make her necklaces too.
I am always going to take great care of Woodeny,
because she is the dearest, nicest, prettiest little doll
in the world, and I hope she won?t have any more
frightening adwentures.
