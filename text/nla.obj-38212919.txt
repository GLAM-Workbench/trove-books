Syd. Beck?s Laugh Maker.
Ha! Ha! Ha! He! He! He!
Composed and Written by Worton David and
Sam. Mayo.
Printed and Published by Allan & Co. Pty. Ltd.,

I am a merry sort of chap, that?s me,
I laugh Ha! Ha! and I laugh He! He!
At anything funny, well. I simply shriek,
My father had his hand blown off last week.
Chorus:
Ha! Ha! Ha! He! He! He!
I laugh?d until I cried when they told me.
??lt could have been worse,? I said with a grin,
?It might have been the hand with his wages
. in!?
I jumped out of bed this morn at four,
The bell kept ringing at my front door,
I opened the window, when a chap cried, ?Fred.,
I?m sorry if I?ve woke you up,? he said.
Chorus:
Ha! Ha! Ha! He! He! He!
?I?m ringing up the chap next door,? said he.
?He hasn?t got a bell on either of his doors,
So I thought you wouldn?t mind if I rang
yours.?
I split my pants at a fancy ball,
And stood with my back up against the wall,
?What is the matter, Sir?? a lady cried,
"Turn round and let me see,? but I replied:
Chorus:
Ha! Ha! Ha! He! He! He!
1 wouldn?t turn round, so she said to me :
?You?re not a man ?you?re only a worm,?
Then I said, ?But this worm?s not going to
turn.?

Delaney had a donkey everyone admired,
Temporarily lazy, permanently tired.
A leg at every corner balancing its head,
And a tail to let you know which end it wanted
to be fed.
Riley slyly said, We?ve underrated it; why not
train it? Then he took a rag,
Rubbed it, scrubbed it, oiled it ard embrocated it,
Got it to the post, and when the starter dropped
the flag:
Chorus:
There was Riley pushing it, shoving it, and shush-
ing it,
Hogan, Logan, everyone in town
Lined up, attacking it, shoving it, and smacking
it,
They might as well have tried to push the Town
Hall down.
The donkey was eyeing them, openly defying
them,
Winking, blinking, twisting' out of place,
Riley reversing it, everybody cursing it,
The day Delaney?s donkey ran the half-mile race.
The muscles of the mighty, never known to
flinch,
Didn?t move the donkey a quarter of an inch.
Delaney lay exhausted, hanging round its throat
With a grip just like a Scotchman on a twenty-
shilling note.
Starter Carter lined up all the rest of ?em,
When it saw them it was willing then,
Raced up, braced up, ready for the best of ?em.
They started off to cheer it, but it changed its
mind again.


Chorus:
There was Riley pushing it, shoving it, and shush-
ing it.
Hogan, Logan, Mary Ann McGraw
She started poking it, grabbing it, and choking it.
It kicked her in the bustle and it laughed hee-
haw.
The Whigs and Conservatives, Radical superla-
tives,
Liberals, Labours hurried to the place,
Stood there in unity, helping the community
To push Delaney?s donkey in the half-mile race.
The crowd began to cheer it, Rafferty the judge
Came up to assist them, still it wouldn?t budge.
The jockey who was riding it?little John
McGee?
Was so thoroughly disgusted he went home to
get his tea.
Hagan, Fagan, students of psychology,
Swore they?d shift it with some dynamite,
Bought it, brought it, then, without apology,
The donkey gave a sneeze and blew the darn
stuff out of sight.
Chorus
There was Riley pushing it, shoving it and shush-
ing it,
Hogan, Logan, all the bally crew,
P?lice and auxiliary. Garrison Artillery,
The Light Horse, the Grenadiers, and the Life-
Guards, too.
They seized it and harried it, picked it up and
carried it,
Cheered it, steered it to the winning-place.
Bookies all drew aside and committed suicide
Because Delaney?s donkey won the half-mile
race.

Has anybody got a book on racing?
Has anybody got a pair of scales?
I?ve got to ride a horse in two years? time for
the Irish Prince of Wales.
The horse isn?t foaled,
But I?ve been told, it?s a racing certaintee;
As lightweight jockeys are so scarce,
They?ve just commissioned me.
Chorus:
I?m not Bobby Lewis,
I?m not Jack Toohey,
I?m not Munro or Harrison,
I?m not Pike or Brown,
And by golly I?m not Whalley,
But I?m just as good as all the other jocks.
From my trainer I?ve got a big retainer,
But I don?t mind telling you,
Past the winning-post they?ll shout me,
You will soon know all about me
When I get down to six stone two.
I had a wire this morning from Calcutta ?
Now this is where I?ve really got a chance ?
It said, ?Will you come over here and ride one
of Lockhart?s elephants??
But wait a bit,
.I?ll make a hit, lam training right, no doubt,
I train on beef and oysters and Guinesses?
bottled stout.
After Retainer in Chorus
And I?ll stop those jockeys? tricks,
And as true as I?m a sinner,
I?ll be riding every winner
When I get down to two stone six.

Poor Uack Sambo tramp?d through U.S.A.,
The way was dreary, and Sam was weary.
But still he kept on singing gaily all the way.
And when the road was long and hard he used
to say:
Chorus:
?Sing along. Sambo, sing along Sam!
One day nearer Alabam
An? de ol? folks who?s waitin? for you.
Keep a-smilin?, sing along. Sambo, sing along,
Sam!
Show dem all how glad you am.
An? you don?t mind the miles you?ve had to do.
You mustn?t let those darkies see you weepin?,
They?ll be so glad when you come smilin? through,
So just you sing along, Sambo, sing along, Sam!
One day nearer Alabam an? de ol? folks who?s
waitin? for you.
Sambo bless?d each landmark that he knew.
As home drew nearer the sky seem?d clearer,
And in the wild wood, just as if the song-birds
knew,
They seem?d to whistle. ?Lardy, Sambo, is that
you ??
Chorus.-?Sing along, Sambo! etc.

Perhaps you are feeling inquisitive like,
As to what?s my profession or trade;
Am I like a parson, a sweep, or a snob,
Or a Sydney wharf-labourer out of a job?
Just to point out how you may be deceived,
Some lady a few nights ago
She said: ??Ain?t you our new special constable,
sir ?
?If you are, come with me.? I said ?No !?
Chorus:
I?m a flirt, I?m a flirt,
And I?m always after the skirts;
All the ladies know ray power,
As I flutter from flower to flower.
I?m a tease with the she?s.
Oh! But, girls, you mustn?t feel hurt,
I can only be true for a minute or to,
I?m a flirty, flirty flirt.
Some chaps are quite an attraction to girls.
Like the treacle-pot is to the flies;
They know very well what a man ought to be.
And it?s that sort of man they discovered in me.
Some lady wanted to marry me once.
She fancied herself, that was plain,
I said, ?If you got all of me all to yourself,
Why, you?d have to keep me on a chain!?
Chorus.?l?m a flirt, etc.
Your wife is very stout, my boy!?She?s the
fattest I?ve seen for a long time.
That?s so; she was built for comfort, not for
speed. ?Miller and Beck.

I WANT A BOY.
Words by Billy Howard. Music by Elven Hedges.
Publishers: ?Allan & Co., Pty. Ltd., Melbourne,
Sydney, Adelaide, Bendigo.
Susan Green was sweet sixteen, had never yet been
kissed.
And what you?ve never had why of course you?ve
never missed,
But Susan read a novel called Mother?s loving boy,
It put ideas into her head and filled her full of joy.
She walked into a shop, the salesman said, now Miss
What would you like to have? she shyly answered this.
Chorus:
I want a boy, I want a boy, not for a toy, one to
annoy,
I want a nice young man who will understand,
Don?t want an amateur who?ll just hold your hand,
I like to tease, I like to squeeze, I?v heard that loving
is simply divine.
One who?d meet you in the hall, kiss you squeeze
you that?s not all,
Sit you down upon his lap, hug you till you snap,
I want a boy, I want a boy, I want a great big won-
derful boy.
Susan had her eye tooth and her wisdom tooth as
well,
Also had a sweet tooth or this tale I couldn?t tell,
The sweet tooth turned a bad tooth and a dentist she
did see,
He said my lass you must take gas and leave the rest
to me.
When her dream was o?er she whispered, doctor dear,
He said, what do you want? she answered, listen
here.
Couplet I.
I like one who does work fast, one who says my love
will last.
Full of fire and no smoke, real kisses not a joke.
Couplet 11.
One who doesn?t care a jot, makes you say, I trust
you qot.
Says, he?ll eat you, makes you squeal, starts to have
a meal. Couplet 111.
Says he?ll chase you ?cross the seas, makes you wob-
ble at the knees
If another lad comes round, he snarls like a hound.

Pictures a sad memory.
Whenever leaves begin to fall,
Home again I seem to be.
Chorus:
1 get so blue thru and thru when the leaves come
tumbling down from the trees, down thru the
breeze
1 always sigh and I cry when the sun says ?Good-
bye? to the birds and the bees, their sweet melo-
dies
I never shed a tear, when the summer days are here.
But when it?s autumn time, ev?ry thought of mine,
seems so dark and drear, .
I always sing that lonesome Spring Song melody,
because you see, , .
It makes me think of someone in a gingham gown
in ray home town, ,
I hear my old girl say a pray?r beside my mother s
vacant chair,
I get so blue thru and thru when the leaves come
tumbling down.
Autumn, Autumn, seems like you know,
You took my best pal from me,
Autumn, Autumn, long, long ago
Now you feel sorry I see,
I know your leaves are just your tears,
Falling in sweet sympathy.

I was out of a job, and I didn?t have a bob,
When an bid tar said to me:
?Would you like to come and have some fun
While you?re young and stout and strong??
So the. very next day I sailed away
To this good old chanty song:
Chorus:
There is somebody waitin? for me
In an old cabin down by the sea;,
In the land where I wish I could be.
There is somebody waitin? for me.
1 know a cot in a very sweet spot,
And I think of it ev?ry day;
It is all I?ve got, my whole job lot,
And it?s miles and miles away.
There were tears and sighs, and fond goodbyes,
When the time came round to go,
Rut as I jog along, I sing this song
To myself, because I know.

All I have, all I hold, are just dreams unfold, m each

Chorus:
Faded old love letters, they mean the world to me,
Each night I read them over, they are my rosary,
My little Pal I?ve lost you, but like a star you shine,
Tho? your dear hands are still, in my heart there?s a
thrill, for those faded love letters of mine.
A garden had I with one little rose, just one little
rose of my heart,
One day they took her, and nobotty knows, what it
meant when we two came to part,
All I have to adore, all I have to live for are love
letters I read o?er and o?er.

There?s a certain girlie, she?s a Yiddish oueen,
Though she?s bandy she?s a dandy, best I?ve ever seen.
How she grabs the fellows, any time they meet.
She looks like Theda Bara, all except her feet
Chorus:
Vamping Rose, there she goes, in her fancy clothes
With her shoes number two, show they pinch her
toes,
Then she strolls to the lounge of some swell hotel
Where she acts like a baby vamp how she loves her
cocktails!
Once Rosie danced just to please a king, then he gave
her some diamonds n? everything
She?s a beauty,- oi! oi! she vamp?d ?Abee t my boy."
That?s why they call her Vamping Rose.
What a voice for singing, from a mouth it flows,
Madam Melba let me tell yer, she can?t sing like Rose
When it comes to Op?ra, she learns ev?ry part,
Have you heard Paderewski? Rose knows that by
heart.
Chorus;
Vamping Rose, there she goes, in her fancy clothes
Goodness me can it be! My! what class she shows!
On the beach she?s a peach in her bathing suit
But she doesn?t go in to swim (how she hates the
water)
Rose shows her hose when she walks the street
Then she winks at the boys oh! so very neat
She?s got rouge on her cheeks it?s been on there for
weeks.
That?s why they call her Vamping Rose.

Just make believe and smile.

Make believe you are glad when you re sorry,
Sunshine will follow the rain;
When things go wrong, it won t be long.

Smile tho? your heart may be broken;
For when bad luck departs, you will find good
luck starts ?
Don?t grieve, just make believe.

And blue skies above have -turned to gray,
Don?t worry, for it may not all be true;

I LIKE AN ?OT WATER BOTTLE

Australasian Agents: Albert & Son, Sydney.
I?ve heard wedding bells ringing merrily,
But I?ll see that they never ring out for me.
There?s many a chap thinks it?s awfully nice
To be pelted with old boots, confetti and rice.
He sees something nice in a little short skirt,
Then it?s good-bye to bachelor life;
For two can live warmer than one, he explains,
So he takes her and makes her his wife.
Chorus:
But I like an ?ot water bottle, hot,
An 'ot water bottle in bed.
Wives may be a luxury;
An 'ot water bottle?s the thing for me.
If you?re cold in the winter,
You don?t want to rush and get wed;
Stick to your seven-and-six and have
An ?ot water bottle in bed.
Each night when I go off to sweet repose,
On the ?ot-water bottle go ten pink toes.
But if I had a missus she?d give me a smack
If I only put one little toe on her back.
On Sundays I never get up when it?s cold;
I have a good ?lay in? instead.
I sit on my ?ot-water bottle for hours,
Enjoying my breakfast in bed.
I?ve had some mishaps with that bottle, no doubt,
For last Saturday morning the cork came out.
The bed it was soak?d, and my nightie as well,
When my landlady saw it she did give a yell!
She turn?d up her nose when I tried to explain,
And I got a week?s notice to clear.
Slie said, ?Take your ?ot-water bottle with you,
For I won?t have that sort of thing here.?

Buildings, Sydney.

Way out West they tell a story of an Indian Maid,
?Wana? was her name.
Ev'ry night beneath the stars a warrior young and
brave,
Sang to her a love refrain
All the birdies started spooning, when they heard him
softly crooning.
Chorus:
Oh! Wana I wana love but you no wana
1 think some day you?re gonna wana
?Cause if you do no wana why do you coo pretty lit-
tle things like you do,
When for kiss I pray you always say some other day
Oh! when 1 wana you no wana, when you wana, I
no wana,
So Wana how we ever gonna make heap love?
Ev?ry time her warrior called to hold a big pow-wow,
?Wana? would be there.
But most ev?ry one of them would break up in a row,
When she gave her brave the air
Tho? they quarreled when they parted
Here?s the way he always started.
Repeat Chorus,;
PATTER.
If you no wana love me Wana, mad I gonna be
?Cause I wana what I wana when I wana, See?
I know ?nother pretty redskin come to my tepee
And she wana, yes, she wana make heap love to me,
I can no wait a million day my fault you no say,

Harry Lauder?s Popular Chorus Song.
AUSTRALIA IS THE LAND FOR ME.
Written, Composed, and Sung by Harry Lauder.
Publishers:?Allan & Co., Pty. Ltd., Melbourne,
Sydney, Adelaide, Bendigo.
There?s a land I?d like to tell you all about,
It?s a land in the far south sea;
It?s a land where the sun shines nearly every day,
It?s the land for you and me.
It?s the land for the man with a big strong arm,
It?s the land for big hearts, too; , .
It?s the land will fight, for everything that s right,
For Australia is the real true blue.
Far away in the land of the Kangaroo,
And the wattle and the old blue gum,
We love one another, and we don?t want to quarrel,
But we?re there when troubles come.
We will stand by the side of the Homeland.
British we?ll remain;
Australia! Son of the Motherland!
Let me toast you once again.
Chorus :
There?s a land where the sun shines nearly every day.
Where the skies are ever blue;
W?here the folks are happy as the day is long,
And lots of work to do.
Where the soft wind blows, and the gum-tree grows
As far as the eye can see;
Where the Magpie chaffs, and the Kookaburra laughs;
Australia is the land for me.

He?s got hot lips when he plays jazz.
He draws out steps, like no one has.
You?re on your toes, and shake your shoes,
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues.
I watch the crowd until he?s through;
He can be proud they?re ?cuckoo,? too;
His music?s rare you must declare,
The boy is there with two hot lips.

Twelve months ago I put two-bob
In the Post Office Savings Bank.
I?d heard that money would help to keep
John Bull in the very front rank.
The very next day, I says to a chum,
?Why don?t we build more ships??
And he says, ?Well, we can?t, old Pal,
Just now we?re short of ?chips?.?
Says I, ?What?s that? we can?t build ships,
Because the country?s short of ?chips???
Chorus:
?Then where?s my two-bob gone.
I sent to the G.P.0.?
I lent the money to the State
To help to keep the Empire straight.
We need ten thousand airships
To guard us from attack,
And if they don?t set about ?em soon,
I?ll want my two-bob back!?
One day I went out camping
And after a big sham fight,
I went and told the Gen?ral
How to set the Army right.
I says, ?Wljy not buy all the guns
From Maxim or from Krupp,
And arm a fleet of flying- machines,
And send the army up??
He says, ?We can?t, we?ve got no oof I?
But I says, ?Who?re you trying to spoof?
Chorus:
?Why where?s my two-bob gone
I put in the Savings Bank?
I understood it went to keep
The War Office from going to sleep.


A million Iron-dads, air-ships?
That?s what the soldiers lack!
You shan?t waste my money building forts
I?ll have my two-bob back!?
I went to the House on Budget night,
And after the Speaker spoke,
It struck me rather forcibly
That he was going broke.
I met Billy Hughes coming out.
So I says to him, ?Look here,
Why don?t you lower those taxes that
You said you would last year??
?I can?t?l?m millions short!? says he;
So I says, ?Oh, well what price me!
Chorus:
?Where?s my two-bob gone,
That the Postmaster General had?
And how dare you stand up and grin?
And carry a purse with my money in?
You?re losing millions ?are you?
No wonder trades so slack.
Rats to you, and your Budget too!
I want my two-bob back!?

BABY BILL.
Told by Ada Reeve as ((Ain't He Jim.")
Re-Printed and Published by Joe Slater by arrange
ment with Francis Day and Hunter London, W
(Publishers of Music).
Australasian Sole Agents:?Albert & Son, Sydney
Oh, baby, do go off to sleep?
That?s twice you kidded me;
You are as artful as a lot of monkeys.
When father comes from work I?ll tel! him
As how you wouldn?t go to sleep,
And then he will come and sing to you,
And you won?t like that, you know.


Chorus:
But he?s a dear old dad?
Ain?t he, Jim?
And he loves us both, dear lad?
Don?t he, Jim?
When you see him, it looks grand,
How he holds your little hand;
He?s the best bloke in the land ?
. Ain?t he, Jim?
But we got into an awful muddle
When we tried to find a name
To give you at the christening;
Oh, it was a funny game!
I thought of lovely names like
Horace, Percival, Harold, and Cis.
But Dad would have the name of Jim,
To be the same as his.
Chorus:
And Jim is good enough for you?
Ain?t it, Jim?
It?s smart and nipp, too?
Ain?t it, Jim?
Though some people calls it low,
Names ain?t all the go,
And you are Jim?s kid, you know?
Ain?t you, Jim?
Dad had a dream about you
When we hadn?t had you long;
He dreamt that God came and pinched you
Because you?d been doing wrong.
His face was running all down with tears;
He woke up with a groan and said,
?Oh Lord! oh, ?strewth!
I dreamt the kid had gone and left us all
alone.?
Chorus:
If you did you?d break his heart ?
Wouldn?t you, Jim?
So we?re never going to part ?
Are we, Jim?
Though men sometimes go and booze,
There?s generally some excuse,
For blokes will go on the loose ?
Won?t they, Jim?

Someone is staring at me dear,
Someone is glaring at me.
Somebody?s smiling now,
Somebody who knows how.
Long have I sought you,
Now dear I?ve caught you;
, Chorus:
Stealing, stealing with your eyes appealing,
There?s a tender feeling in my heart for you.
Sighing, sighing,
There?s a voice that?s crying
Your sweetheart is true.
Morning, morning, when the day is dawning.
You without a warning from my dreams depart.
Stealing, stealing at your shrine I?m kneeling,
I?ve caught you stealing my heart.
Songbirds are singing of you, dear.
Love they are bringing from j^ou.
1 hear them in the trees,
Their song upon the breeze.
While I am sleeping.
Near me you?re creeping.
Be sure to ask for that Wonderful Tuneful Hit
Song? ?WHEN THE LEAVES COME
TUMBLING DOWN.? It?s a furore in New

Gaze on this great copper, I?m the model of a

My figure is just what it ought to be.
I certainly look noble, and deny it no one can,
There?s not many handsome chaps about like
Chorus:
I?m Pincher the Nark; Pincher! that?s me!
When I?m out upon my beat
I?m the idol of the street (I don?t think).
All the ladies loose their hearts
When my shape they see.
Who is the man they idolise? Pincher! P.C. t
Patter;
Still there?s a lot to put up with in the force.
It?s enough to make a ?copper boil.? I?m full
of the grape-nuts?er ?I mean force. Why even
when I?m asleep my heart?s on the beat. Look
who ?ere ?I mean ?what I?ve done. This medal
is for saving life. A man came up to me and
said, ?Don?t you work at the police station?? I
said, ?Yes; I?m the cashier there; I count the
coppers.? ?Well,? said he, ?Lock me up, I?m
starving!? I said, ?See this sovereign? What
would you do if I gave it to you?? He said,
?I?d drop dead,? so I saved his life. My brother
?now, there?s a smart man?he?s chief electrician
in a slaughter-house (noise on side). Now then,
you kids, clear off, put that down, put that
horse and cart down!

The Fireman
Written and Composed by Nat. Clifford.
Publishers: Reeder & Walsh, London, W.
On the ?Never-get-there? engine I?ve been driving
thirty years,
And some dreadful sights I?ve seen, in twelve
accidents I?ve been.
The story I?m a-going to tell would melt a frog
to tears,
So go to sleep and listen to my tale ?the ?Myst?ry
of the Mouldy Midnight Mail.?
We left the station early, and the whistle gave
a scream,
She began to rock and roll?l?d forgot to take
some coal;
Then I all at once discovered that we hadn?t
any steam,
And the up-town engine was going up the Pole.
Chorus:
We went flying along, along, at a terrible rate,
I shouted to my mate, ?We?re nineteen hours
late!?
All at once I discovered, to my dismay,
The engine had turned right round, and we
were going the other way.
We stopped outside a pub, and went to have a
drink;
When we came out, oh, Golly! someone had
pinched the bloomin? trolly.
I went up to a policeman, and the copper said,
?I think , #>
I saw it disappearing down a drain _
I fished for half an hour, but all in vain.
Just then I heard a rumbling sound?the car
came dashing by ?
My mouth was in my heart! for the car I
made a dart.
It rushed up to a horse-trough, and I fanpy it
was dry.
It took a drink, then made another start.
Chorus.?We went flying along, etc.

Take It Away
Published by Joe Slater Publishing Co.. Sydney.
Written and Composed by Fred. Godfrey and
Chas. Hilbury.
Once a young lady of indefinite charms.
Ran away when she?d placed a small child in
my arms.
I went to a policeman, and turned very red;
When I asked him what I should do with it,' he
? Chorus:
Take it away! Take it away!
I do wish you?d mind what I say,
To the police station take it, I know the laws,
??Lost property office? you will see on the doors.
If it?s not claimed in three months, the youngster
is yours,
Take it away! Take it away!
I once saw a fire, and the sight it was fine,
But up on the roof was an old friend of mine
They brought a long ladder, the crowd gave a
cheer,
I whispered out loud in the fireman?s ear:?
Chorus :
Take it away! Take it away!
I do wish you?d mind what I say,
I?ll m ake it alright with you, don?t be a slop,
I owe him a fiver, you might let him stop.
When he puts his foot on the ladder up top,
Take it away! Take it away!
My wife?s got a cork leg, it?s stuck on with glue,
She wears it to bed ?cause it doesn?t unscrew.
She kicks out at night, quite disturbing my rest,
Last night I said, Mary, in gentle protest.
Chorus:
Take it away! Take it away!
I do wish you?d mind what I say,
I?ve been a good husband, and so you could
walk,
I?ve bought you a beautiful leg made of cork,
But you?re sticking it right in my supper of
pork,
Take it away! Take it away!

My ancestors were pirates
On the bounding Spanish main;
Folks tell me that?s the reason
I?ve got water on the brain.
In case you landsmen think
I?ve never braved the angry deep,
I?ll let you see my tatoo marks,
And when you?re fast asleep?-
Chorus :
I?ll be out in the life-boat all night;
For wrecks I?ll be on the alert,
I?ll be out in the life-boat all night?
Dress?d up in my waterproof shirt.
I don?t want to ?rort? about saving folks? lives,
But to-night in the channel the Sultan arrives,
And as I?ve heard he?s bringing a cargo of wives
I?ll be out in the life-boat all night.
The cottage I had rented
Was the cheapest on the coast.
I never knew till afterwards
?Twas haunted by a ghost.
The neighbours said a headless girl
Went stalking through each room.
So I whispered to the missis
As it changed from light to gloom?
Chorus:
?I?ll be out in the life-boat all night
If she can?t be kept underground.
I?ll be out in the life-boat all night
When the filleted lady walks round.
She stalks with a dagger from midnight to
three,


And jabs it in every old thing she can see,
But I?ll lay six to four she won?t jab it in me?
I?ll be out in the life-boat all night.?
You sing about Tom Bowling,
And your heroes on the sea ;
You sing about Grace Darling?
She?s no earthly chance with me.
Last Friday night with cane in hand,
And tall hat on my head,
I took the rent from ?neath the clock.
Then to the wife I said ;
Chorus:
??l?ll be out in the life-boat all night,?
Said 1 as I scented my hair.
?I?ll be out in the life-boat all night,?
Then I wandered towards Wynard Square.
I went to the ?Panto,? the ballet to see,
And a girl in pink tights smiled as sweet as
could be.
So I wired to the wife, ?Don?t you wait up for
me,
I?ll be out in the life-boat all night.?

It?s no use denying facts,
I?m henpeck?d. you can see!
1 was on our wedding morn
My wife commenc?d to peck at me.
The wedding breakfast over.


I said; We?ll start off to-day
Upon jour honeymoon! then she yelled;
What, waste time that way!
Chorus :
Archibald ?certainly not!
Get back to work at once, sir, like a shot!
When single, yon could waste time spooning.
But lose work now for honeymooning,
Archibald ?certainly not.
A sportsman I have always been ?
I?ve hunted with the hounds.
I?ve hunted, too, without them,
And it?s cost me many pounds.
I can?t afford to hunt now that
I?m married, but one day,
The wife remark?d, when I asked her
If cricket I could play:?
Chorus:
Archibald?certainly not!
About this cricket game I?ve read a lot,
Besides, last time you play?d at Dover,
I heard you bowl?d a maiden over,
Archibald ?certainly not!
A lady named Miss Hewitt got
On friendly terms with me.
She fell in love with me at once ?
And then fell in the sea.
My wife came on the scene as I
Threw coat and vest aside;
As other garments I stripped off
To save the girl, she cried: ?
Chorus:
Archibald ?-certainly not!
Desist at once disrobing on the spot,
You may show your pluck to save Miss
But if you?ve got to strip to do It?
Archibald ?certainly not!
Hewitt.

Published by Joe Slater Publishing Co.,

I ve just come from a church bazaar, upon my
word ?twas prime;
Amongst the giddy, gushing girls I had a lively
time.
One sweet young thing came up to me, I couldn?t
well refuse,
She asked me if I?d go in for a pair of baby?s
shoes.
She giggled and blushed in a style so gay,
Till I said, ?My dear, "lease do go away.?
Chorus;
Don?t look at me like that; don?t look at me like
that.
Oh ! you you giddy young thing;
Please run away now?ting-ting-ting !
Tour face is charming, Miss, it makes my heart
pit-pat,
I like your ways, but spare my davs,
Don?t look at me like that.
The other day I went into a restaurant, you
know,
I fancied poultry for a change, they brought
some up?What O!
I made a gallant, glorious charge to cut that bird
in two ;
I must have hurt its feelings, for the air turned
navy blue.
I grabb?d that chicken and I held him so;
All of a sudden he started to crow!
Chorus:
Don?t look at me like that; don?t look at me like
that.
Keep cool, Joe; what a mug you are,
I?m old enough to be your pa.
Kindly respect old age, and don?t be such a flat;
I?m ninety-two, so cock-a-doodle-doo!
Don?t look at me like that!
