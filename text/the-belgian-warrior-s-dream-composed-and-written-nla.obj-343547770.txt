“The Belgian Warrior's Dream.”
Composed & Written by A. ROCHESTER, Blackheath,
Alone, in stricken Belgium, a brave old warrior lay,
His head was pillowed on some rags, beside a stack of hay;
The scenes of bygone happy days before him in visions passed
The scenes which now had passed away too happy for to last.
In dreamland he again beheld his once loved, happy home,
From which he was forced by German greed an outcast for to roam
Once more he’s standing at his cot beside the running stream,
He greets his wife and family, and murmurs in his dream.
O take me to my little cot, beside the running brook,
And on my wife and children dear just let me once more look ;
But alas those joys that thrilled his heart, and caused bright hopes
to beam,
Were only visions of the past in that bold warrior’s dream.
’Twas German lust and raging fire caused him to lose his farm,
A cruel bayonet pierced his wife and ended Life’s sweet charm ;
His children he was forced to leave for charity to keep,
While he went forth alone to bear his sorrows keen and deep ;
Deprived of all, sworn to revenge, he wanders day by day,
Through ruined, wasted Belgium, he makes his dreary way,
Though weary, sad, and sick at heart, still bright hopes within
him beam
He falls asleep and once again, he says this in his dream.
O take me to my little cot, etc.
With revenge stamped upon his brow the warrior slumbers on,
The pleasure of those bygone days before his memory shone,
The pleasures of his early youth now hover round his head,
Unconsciously he slumbers on no danger does he dread,
But suddenly he feels a sting, and awakens with a start,
A murderers bayonet he beholds with cruel, death-dealing dart,
Too well he knows he is called upon to cross Death’s icy stream,
But in that Peaceful Land he’ll meet the loved one’s of his dream.
