PILLOWING ARE THE RAINF'ALL RECORDS AT
URALLA P'OR PERIOD 1885 TO 1924:


JOHN McCROSSIN
JOHN McCROSSIN died on 11th November 1881. A
lengthy obituary, illuminatingly written appeared in
'the Ur alia and Walcha dimes of 16 th November 1881,
from which the following brief extracts are taken:
The late Mr John McCrossin was born in Newton
Stewart, County Tyrone, Ireland, in the year 1831, and
at the time of his death was about 50 years of age. He
came to this colony, with his father, mother, and six
brothers and sisters, in 1841, and in October of that
year this sterling family removed to New England at
that time almost a terra incognita, and the confines or
the white man’s progress in these parts. Like all sturdy
pioneers in countries such as Australia, the late Mr
McCrossin had to battle with hardships of no uncommon
kind during the first years of his career in this dis-
trict, but, with an unswerving regard to rectitude. a
determination to overcome every obstacle by hard toil
and honest means, and with a heart whose throb was a
protest against hypocrisy, meanness and deceit, he had
that innate satisfaction, which is the legacy of an up-
MRS. McCROSSIN
right life, of seeing,, his labours crowned with success.
Knowing the inestimable goed qualities of our de-
parted citizen, we I'ccl peweress to do or say anything
which can add to his !r eprvachable character. Our eulo-
gium cannot reach the bounds of extravagance because
we are utterly unable to pom tray a character which is
universally admitted to come as near perfection as it
is possible for human nature to attain to.
It is further noted in the obituary notice that the
burial took place in the old cemetery, besides the graves
of iris father and mother, and that the lunerai was at-
tended by quite 600 sorrowing residents of the town an I
district.
In 1859-60. John McCrdssin took a leading part i i
the expedition led by Captain John Mackay, which locat-
ed the port of Mackay, in Queensland, 'the party in ad-
dition to Captain Mackay and Mr- McCrossin, comprised
Hamilton Robson, John Muldoon, Andrew Murray and as
Italian. r l he long, hazardous and arduous journey north

VIEW OF THE TOWN TAKEN FROM MT BEEF.


URALLA’S “PLACE IN THE SUN.”
MRALLA is situated just over the west-
ern side of The Great Divide, on the
u PP er wa ters of The Gwyder. With-
al 1/r TgJyh in a couple of miles to the east, the
head waters of the Macleay wind their
way eastward.
The towm is situated almost midway between Sydney
and Brisbane and has an altitude of 3337 ft, and .there
are few places that offer to the wearied city-dweller
or P.lains-men, so delightful a change. Its very bracing
air possesses wonderful recuperative virtues, and the
district is to become one of the State’s sana-
toria.
Its name is variously stated as meaning
‘Rocky’ and ‘A Qiain of Waterholes.’ Either name is
most appropriatejws the huge boulders of excellent grey
granite are conspicuous features, whilst the creek, un-
fortunately now silting up, was at no very distant date
a chain of waterholes; but as thg first settler gave the
name the river, it is probable that that is the
original furnie.'*
'kind J t"o Uralla. Mt. Beef, as a
northern eminence, and Mt. Mutton, as a westerly
pect, are two topographical features that appeal readily
to the aesthetic sense of nature-lovers. But w'hile na-
ture has been good, the hand of man has also been busy,
and to-day Uralla presents the appearance of a pictur-
esque arboreal retreat. Pines, willows, elms, and other
exotics, grace its streets, parks and private lands. In
these days of motordom, thousands of travellers pass
through the town every year, and the stately avenues ol
.piper-trees in the main and other streets convey a sense
of the beautiful to all.
Throughout the district, a fact touched upon else-
where in this Souvenir, there are splendid drives and
beauty spots galore, besides many points of interest in
the old homes of the pioneers, as well as the modern
dwellings of the younger generations.
Our position in the .pastoral industry is unique*,
while as a fruit producer the district has reached a po-
sition of eminence.
Ihese combined with the activities of our various
sporting bodies such as cricket, tennis, golf, football,
racing and gun clubs, and various ’ public organisations
such as Agricultural Society, etc., constitute Vralla’s
tg -“A Place in the Sun”.
the many former come to join us
in. tfie celebrations of Back-tV-UralhuWeek, the progress
of the town, always along safe and sure lines, will at
once be evident.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF URALLA.
Like most inland towns of N.S.W. it is somewhat
difficult to set out the actual facts in regard to the
first settlement, but from the available lecords it
seems fairly certain that the foundations of the town
were laid by those travellers who traversed the ma’A
road to Brisbane.
This road then followed the direction of what is now
known as Queen Street, winding round the foot of Mt.
Mutton, and passing through Arding and Saumarez to
Armidale.
About the year 1854 the first business places were
established in Uralla, an accommodation house and
bootmaker's shop being added to the few bark humpies
which then formed the tiny hamlet. Ihese were built
near the intersection of Hill and Queen Streets by the
late Mr Samuel McCrossin. bearer of a name that was
intimately associated with the progress of the lowm for
many years subsequently.
The first mail depot was situated on the site now'
occupied by Alma Park, and it. is interesting to note
that the mail coach was then run by the late J. Gill,
whose sons at present hold a large landed property at
Moonbi. Later Mr Gill .gave way to the rather famous
Cobb & Co’s coaches, the mail stables then being shifted
to a site on Mrs Woods’ peresent property, and subse-
quently to a site at the corner of Biidge & John Sts. Mi
Samuel O'Dell was then in charge of the stables, which
were carried on there for a number of years until the
advent of the railway.
At this early date in the town's history, the land
extending - from Alma Park up the slope of Mt. Beef was
under cultivation, the principal crop being wheat,
which, when cut, was threshed by means of flails, win-
nowed, bagged, and carted to Gostwyck, where it was
made into flour by the old-fashioned ‘stone’ process, the
power for which was provided by a windmill.
• A
The first hotel in the town was erected on a sTe
at tne corner of Hill and Queen Streets in the year
1853 by Mr Dumaresq, the licensee being Mr Samuel
McCrossin, and the trade of the rather pretentious inn
immediately began to flourish by reason of the many
new hands being attracted to the Rocky River Gold-
field. Many of the miners arrived on horseback, and
to accommodate the horses a paddock w: s formed em-
bracing practically the whole aiea from H i! Sheet to
Jchn Street and extending a considerable distance to-
wards the Rocky River. Among the most important
guests to put up at the hotel was the Gold Commissioner
“(Mr Dalton), who stayed there during his period : cal
\isits to the goldfields.
Opposite the hotel was the first butci ers’ shop, the
slaughtering-yard being at the corner of Queen and
Salisbury Streets, on the land recently purchased by Mr
A. H. Holloway.
Next to the butcher’s shop was a blacksmith named
Drant, and the influx of new hands likewise kept him
busily engaged.
A snifUl school was also established in the vicinity,

and it was here the first born UraPa natives secured
their early tuition.
That was practically the extent of the business
community for the time being.
The first cemetery was established nearby, but as
the little town extended, and the population of the
Rocky River goldfield had considerably increased, what
is known as the Old Cemetery was secured for that pur-
pose, and the bodies were removed and le-interred
there.
The Old Cemetery, by the way, had a tragic start
the first burials therein being the bodies of five Scotch-
men, miners all, who were smothered in a fall of earth
on Mt. Jones. The funeral was one of the largest evei
witnessed in the town, practically the whole of the po-
pulation being present at the graveside.
The first poundkeeper (who, by the way, used the
slaughter-yards to secure trespassmg stock) was Richard
Ward, who was succeeded by E. Dwyer, in whose time
new pound-yards weic elected at the north-western enft
of the town.
The year 1860 saw the introduction of the'flour-mil-
ling industry, a mill being erected in King Street by
Mr J. Kirkwood. Some of the blocks used’ in the
foundations of the mill lemain to-day as sound as when
they were placed in position. Mr Kirkwcod a'so built
seveial ccttagcs in the vicinity of the mill, all of
which have since been demolished, and added to his
possessions the coiner store on the site now occupied by
Mr Nem an Low's Blue Trail Garace.
’j his store was kept by Mr Ogilvie, who carried on
successfully for a number of years, being succeeded by
Messrs Cunningham Bros., H. Roman, and R. Clayton,
respectively.
Cn the opposite corner Messrs Allingham Bros bu ; !t
an hotel, 1 nown as T lie Commercial Hotel, which upon
their'retirement was taken over by Mr. Mackay, who
in turn was followed by Messrs G. Morrow, I. Sinoiccr.
J. Rjcn, . Williamson, P. Griffin, and P. Shanahan,
respf|tfi<ely. Portion of the old building lemains and,
in its remodelled form, is used as a private residence by
Mr H. Bower.
The next hotel to be built was r ihc Uralla Hotel, at
the corner of Hill and Bridge Streets. The old build-
ing did duty for many years until demolished and re-
placed by the fire brick structure now known as The
Impelial Hotel.
Building operations followed clo ely in Ih’ ma : n
street (now Biidgc Street), the first of importance be-
ing iho Presbyterian Church. Many years after He
oiigiral building gave place to tie present structu.e.
Park houses were very much the vogue in these
dayk, several being in the main street. The first local
ructicncer, named' O’Connor, occupied ore of these.
Wheßi*, now stands the modem store pienises of
Tried ett’s Ltd. (corner of Bridge and Hill Streets) was
then the site of a wheelwright’s shop cor ducted by Mr
B. J. Smith, and on the opposite corner ttas another
black mithy owner by Mr J. Davidson.
7 Ids building was demoli-hed in to make loom
for (he Ausl i alien Joint Slick Bank p emi.-es, now
owned by the Coinm.eicial Banting Co. of Sidney Ltd.
Mr Briggs was r: sport Mo for the first pi arn ary.
which was between Davidscn's shop and the Ore a/
Northern Hotel. This hitter was conducted by "Mr
Phil. O’Brien, and later for many yea’s by' Mr Jhes.
Murray. In recent years the building was considerably
enlarged and the narre changed to The Commercial
Hotel, the present licensee being Mr W. J. Wales/
Other buildings towards the noith-castern end of
the main street were Mr D. Davidson’s rm’thy ard resi-
dence. Mr W. Ambicy’s monumental works, and the
shops of A. P. Smith (tailor), H. Malkins (saddler),
and W. A. Jones (wheelwright) and the letter’s residence
The land now’ owned bv the CalhoPc d?nom inai ion,
and on which arc erect’d them fine Church and school
buildings, was formerly farmed by the late Mr W. Kyan.
Adjoining the Church properly a brick be i ding, in-
tended for a hotel, was creeled, hut v as not o; ered as
such owing to objection being upheld to the granting of
a license. The house was therefore used for tesidenUal
purposes only.
Next came a cordial factory owned by Mr W.
Hopkins. Many years later this building was convert-
ed into a comfortable dwelling by the present owner,
Mr J. P. Henry Jnr.
The late Mr Samuel McCrossin died curing h’s occu-
pancy of the Uralla Hotel, which was c’osecl for a
considerable time and, alter being renovated, was re-
opened under the management of Mr James Stnekcr.
Lower down the street and nr a southerly ci cc'tion
another house was built which was int n-’cl for - a hotel,
but proved unsuitable, and Mr K<m> e:ly, for whom it
was built, then opened what was named The Ro\al
Hotel, and afterwards Tat tci sails Hotel, ir a • the crook.
The building intended for Mr Kenner y ra : tlien
rrsed as a store by Mr W, Ccghcrn (the first Mayor of
the Municipality), who sold < ut fo Mr McDonald, ho in
turn to Mr A. R. Frem’in. The latter was. .‘■ucccdcd by
Mr. H. Purkiss, R. F. Lcamon, ard CL & J. McCro-s'n
respectively. Mr FrenTin afterwards secured the corner-
opposite the Uralla Hotel, on winch a store huik ing l,tad
previously been commenced. ilvs h.c c:mp'eted and
opened the first general stoic on (hat site. He was suc-
ceeded by Messrs Fean, Cooper and Cranp, D. T. Pea - -
son, J. Lonsdale, A. W. Taylor. Cooper Bros., Wm,
Moss & Co., and finally The New- England Stores Ltd.
From time to time alterati ns were effected by tie
various proprietors until it would be difficult to recog-
nise in the up-to-date premises of to-day the modest
building erected in tire ‘good old days’—yet there re-
imins a considerable portion of the old s ructuie, the
walls of which arc built of basalt and are in thick-
ness.
Lower down, on ihe s.anc side of the ma : n sliest,
Mr J. T. Crapp built a residence and butchers’ shop,
both of which are at present standing.
From The New England Stores corner an open gully
from four to five feet in depth extending practically tire
whole length of the block, crossing the street opposite
the Bank of N.S.W. and being bricked by a narrow
culvert.
Between the butcher’s shop mentioned and the
Bank N.S.W. wore several vacant allotments, and it.
was here that the first Show' was held in Uralla.

Uralla in the early part of
1872 and practised continu-

Tiie Bank building was in recent jea\s rd’ed
to, until now it presents a substantial appeerages, t! e
olficc portion being desigre;! on n o.’cni lines.
Cf all tbc business piemiscs existing in Ural'a at
the i icscnl time, none perhajs was mo c cli-c'y associ-
ated witli the early de\cloj ire r.t ef the town and dist i’t
than tic Test Office Stores (now Curtis’ Aicadc), at the
cerre ’ of Bridge are! Salisluiy Streets. r i he ran e of
the''for.ne’er of this store, viz., John McCrossin. is a
■household word throughout the district, even at the pre-
sent day, end v. ill Icng he remcirbeied as that of me
who v. a 5 in every sense whai Australians are preud to
call ‘A Map.' Possessed of strong moral courage, pro-
gresive ideas, and a heart as big as the proverbial moun-
tain, his” was a friendship treasured by a’l those who
bad that honour. Even in those early days his motto
was ‘Advance Uralla’ and he never missed an oppor-
tunity in pursuance of that ideal. Little wonder that, on
his demise, the residents of the town and district erect-
ed over his grave in the old cemetery a monument to
perpetuate the memory of this b'g-hearted philanthro-
pist.
Another name associated with this establishment arc!
levered by ad who knew the man, is that of Joseph
Haines, who, upon the death of Mr McCrossin, succeeded
to lire position of manager. Mr Haines was ore of the
first aldermen elected, lopping the poll in the first
election. He was aftei wards Mayor, and also be el many
important positions in the town, including those of
Justice of the Peace and Licensing Justice.
The store derived its name from the fact that the
first Post and Telegraph Office was conducted in con-
nection with the business, the first Postmaster being Mr
Grahainc.
Tiie spacious flour-mill (still standing as one of the
prominent landmarks of the town on its site in Salisbuiy
Stieet, hut now used as a freezing works) was built by
Mr McCiossin. the contractor being Mr Mitchell, who e
I os'r.css was located in the premises afterwards occupied
by Ibo late Dr F. H. Woods, and now by the latter's
aged widow.
For (he installation of the milling machinery, the
j-e:vices of Mr H. S. Goddard was secured. Mr God-
dard came from Sydney, and upon I lie completion of.
bis (<nt:aet he decided to open a Foilndiy* and Kngin-
< eiing Works beie. lb' secured i site in Salisbury
bluet, in the* vicinity of Queen Street, and (he:e erect-
ed bis plant and commenced operations. It was in the
Foundry that tbc bell was cast which for many years
did ‘‘ci vice at St Patrick's Church, Glen limes. The
tasting of ibis bcil was quite an event in the history of
Hie 'tablelands, it being considered at the time the big-
gest undertaking of its kind attempted in the colony,
and a banquet was held to celebrate its satisfactory ac-
complishment.
v.'-At the Foundry also was manufactured much of tho
machinery used in the early days of the Hillgrove and
Melrose mines, and many if the stoves and ranges in use
in the biggest establishments of (he north, and it is
a tiibute to the stability of the wmrk carried out by Mr
Goddard to say that many of those ranges are still in
use.
Adjoining the f oundry was the Bakery of the late
Mrs Coleby, who subsequently became the wife of Mi
John Ihompson. 'i lie latter tarried on the business for
many years, being succeeded by the piesent owners, Mes-
srs G. C. Roberts & Co. The site of the Bakery has not
been changed, but the growth of the business necessitat-
ed larger shop premises, and Messrs Roberts & Co. bu : lt
the large building at the corner near the big biidge, re-

The situation of the first Court House and Police
Station was in Park Street, and here it was that tin 1
body of the bushranger ’Thunderbolt’ was brought for
identification, and the inquiry into his death, wmicli oc-
curred during his capture by Constable Walker.
Opposite the Court House stood the fiist Anglic a i
Church, in which the Rev Septimus Hungerford officiat-
ed. It is pleasing to note that the reverend gentleman,
although in his hundredth year, is still hale and beartv.
Ihe Church was a wooden building, and upon the com-
pletion of the fine biick edifiice now in use, w'as taken
down and re-erected in Biidge Street, where it now'
serves as a Parish Hall and Sunday-school.
Opposite the present St. John's Sunday-fcbool was
the Methodist Church, a modest brick budding, drirol-
ished in later years, when the site was transfened to
the more central situation on the corner of Hill a".d
Maitland Streets, and the beautiful building of lidv
erected.
At the rear of the old Court House (in Park Street),
towards the main street, stood the little building which
did service as a Church and day school for the early
Catholic residents, whose spiritual ministrations were
attended to by priests from Anmdalo, rather McCrr hv
and Dean Lynch being the first clergymen to officii I ■.
r J hen followed Father (now' Bishop) O'Connor, ’ih.iiki
mainly to his foresight, the present spac’oos block of
land situated on the northern erd of the If wn was :o
cured, upon which was built a (d utch, which was afl( i •
wards replaced by the present picturesque building "I
St. Joseph's. The original Church on Ibis site, after b'-
ing Iwdce rebuilt, is now us< d as a garage at the rear of
the Presbytery.
Adjacent to the site occupied first by the Catholic
Church now stands the Oddfellows Hall, which, when
elected, was considered a spacious building, but tiie in-
creased population has long since outgrown it, and the
Lodge has in contemplation additions which wdll hiing it
more into line with the needs of the community.
The first Public School was erected on a site in
Queen Street it being a modest place of one room wit'll
slab walls and bark roof. Mr Warland was the first tea-
cher. This did service until a new brick school was er-
ected some time later, in which have been trained the
majority of Uralla's contribution to the list of good
Australians. With the changes of time, that old school
has been transformed into an up-to-date private hospital
known as St. Elmo Private Hospital, which, under the

skilful supervision of Sister McMaugh, has wen the re-
spect and confidence of the community.
The block on the opposite side of Park Stieet was
secured and a large modern school-building'e;ected. This
was subsequently gutted bv fire, and had to be re-bum,.
The school occupies one of the picked positions over-
looking the town. It says much for the progress of the
town that, although this school was erected rnly a few'
years since, its capacity is already overtaxed, and com-
mensurate additions are about to be undertaken.
The Royal Hotel (which came into the town’s history
as The Court House Hotel) was a very modest hostelry
and was situated half-way up the hill (known for many
years as Carroll’s Hill) in Bridge Street. Between ths
hotel and the bridge, where now stand the private resi-
dences of Mr. J. New-Campbell, Mrs Trickett, and Mr.
Duncombe, were only a bark hut and a blacksmithy, the
latter being tenanted successively by Messrs W. Hogbin.
B. J. Smith, and C. A. Young. The latter subsequently
moved to his present site in East Street, to where later
the machinery and plant of the old New England Foun-
dry, acquired by Mr. Young, was a'so shifted.
Salisbury Street was then nearly all scrub-land, the
only buildings being the miller’s cottage and the resi-
dence of Mr. Edward Walker.
Some years later the Masonic lemplc was built in
Maitland Street. In recent years it was added to, and
several years ago was duly dedicated by the then Grand-
master of the order in this State.
The Locomotive Hotel, which stood at the corner of
Salisbury and Duke Streets, was opened by Mr. A. Cor-
ish, being afterwards conducted by Mr. C. H. Givney, a
man who did much for the progress of the town.
On the opposite corner, Mr David McNeill establish-
ed The Uralla Stores, in connection with which a large
chad cutting plant was installed! The business was sub-
sequently purchased by Mr. P. McAlister and conducted
by Mr. W. McAlister until purchased by Mr. C. E. Solo-
mon, who removed to the corner of Bridge and Hill Sts.
where it is now carried on by Messrs Trickett’s Ltd.
Just on forty-nine years ago the first newspaper,
under the title of The Uralla and Walcha Times, was
published by Mr F. W. Vincent. The plant was form-
erly used in the production of The Armidale Chronic'c.
It was duly installed in a building next to the old Royal
Hotel, portion of the premises being occupied by a
chemist, and another portion by a Celestial fruit vendor
named Den See. The newspaper thus established in
these romantic quarters has remained in the hands of
the Vincent family ever since, being now published by
Mr H. W. Vincent, a son of the'founder.
About twenty years ago Mr. J. Elliott established a
second newspaper, called The Uralla News, which was
latterly carried on by Mr. J. L. Eather until he disposed
of the business last year to Mr. Vincent.
Near the printing office stood a butcher’s shop kept,
by Mr J. Tanko, the -shop being afterwards remodelled
and converted into a Post Office, with Mr James in
charge. '1 he latter was succeeded by Mt Woodall it.
whose time the present Post Office in Hill £.t cct
erected, the old building being taken by Mr W. Lov
who remains with us to-day, having ‘served his tim<
faithfully as a business man as well as cno of ou
civic leaders, with the office of Mayor to h'S credit fo
several terms.
After Mr Low vacated the olel Post Office budding, i
was used in turn as a saddler’s shop by Mr M. J. McMa
lion and others. Mr. McMahon, after acting as an Alder
man for some years, during which he fulfilled the offic
of Mayor, sought higher honours in the service of th>
State and was successful in contesting the old "Uralia
Walcha electorate.

place now stands the imposing brick stiucture known a 1
The Central Chambers, which houses the furniture em
porium of Mr E. J. Williams and Hie Lilac Domino re
freshment rooms, conducted by Mrs Groves.
With the advent of the railway in 1882, Hill Street
was cleared of scrub and converted into a busy thorough-
fare, in which numerous business plates, as well as some
modern homes, were eretted, the principal of these be-
ing the present office and home of Mr A. V. Gostc'ow.
Next door was a carpenter’s shop and dwelling, erected
by Mr. Mark Scanlon. These latter ha\c long since given
way to the ravages of time, and a butcher’s shop, con-
ducted by Mr D. K. Duncombe, now occupies the site
of the carpenter’s shop. Further along towards the rail-
way was a small weatherboard building occupied fo-
il any years by Adam Jong, who was succeeded by a
brother Celestial, Sam War Lee. The latter added con-
siderably to the building, which was burnt cut some
years ago and replaced by the present bn’ck store pre-
mises. On the opposite corner towards the railway sta-
tion, the Court House was built, and later the Police Sta-
tion .
On the opposite side of Hill Stieet is the o’d build-
ing formerly conducted as a hotel and called The Bel'c-
vue Inn, Mr Thos Crotty being the licensee for many
years. He was succeeded by Mrs Trim who, since the can-
cellation of the license, has there conducted a prn ate
boarding house.
Where now stands Mr J. P. Henry’s Jo’nery, Saw-
mill, and Electric Lighting Plant was a gravel pit.
Tire site of the present Methodist Church was in
the early days used as a cultivation paddock, which
extended down to the New England Stores corner.
About 40 years ago the old Rink was built. The pre-
mises were taken over by Mr O. Carter, who tarried on
there until his death in 1924, when the trustees contin-
ued the business. Mr Carter had an honorable connec-
tion with the town. He was the ‘father’ of the Muni-
cipal Council when he retired a Tew years Pefore his
death, and served several teims as Mayor. Mr Carter
was also a member of the local Oddfellows Lodge almost
since its inception.

I said, ‘All right.' We both galloped. He turned round
and fired at me again. I returned his fire. We then
raced for a good bit across a, few creeks and up a bit of
a hill. As soon as he got to the top he wheeled round
and faced down to me. I was going up hill. I again
fired at him. He then turned again up another hill, and
we raced for about a' quarter of an hour. My horse was
gradually pulling him. He then faced over a spur and

EARLY PASTORAL HISTORY
Extracts from ‘Discovery and Early Settlement of New England’ by J. F. Campbell,
L.S., written for the Royal Australian Historical Society in 1922.
In the early spring of the year 1818, Oxley and his
party crossed the southern end of the New England
Tableland on their way to the coast at Port Macquarie.
During their first day’s journey over the tableland,
on September Bth, they had unconsciously followed a
portion of the Great Dividing Range which Oxley de-
scribes as ‘the finest open country, or rather park, imag-
inable.’ Upon reaching the Apsley River, they camped
on an open grassy flat of very considerable dimensions,
on which in later years, was erected the homestead of
the Walcha run, which run, we are informed, was the
first occupancy on the tableland. At the lower end
of the flat is situated the township of Walcha, establish-
ed by survey in 1852.
When the party reached the ‘Falls' region at Mocna
Plains, they were awestruck at the precipitous charactei
of the country on which they gazed, the ravine walls
descending rapidly to a depth of two thousand foet and
over. Further progress in the diiection stated being
considered impracticable, the party doubled back along
the edge of the Apsley Gorge to the waterfall of that
name (which Oxley named Beckett's Cataract), where
they camped for'two days. From this encampment
scouting parties were sent to inspect the country along
the southern edge of the Apsley canon and its tributary
the Tia River gorge, at the head of which is the famous
Bathurst or Tia Waterfall.
From the Apsley Falls the party proceeded in a
south-easterly direction, in order lo avoid the deep
gorges of the river and its tributaries, the route and
terminal point of this day's journey having been previ-
ously ascertained by Evans. They camped for the night
on the Tia River, at the lower end of ‘an extensive and
wide valley’ at which place in after years the Denne
brothers established their homestead.
From the Tia or Croker's River they continued east-
erly and formed an encampment on the basaltic slopes of
the Vernon County boundary, within the pastoral holding
of Yarrowitch. On the following clay, September 18th,
they endeavored to advance on their easterly course, but
the dense biush belts that skirt the county boundary
along the margin of the eastern falls, together with the
inclemency of the weather, made progiess so unsatisfac-
tory that they decided to return to the mo;e open coun-
try of the Yarrowitch holding, where they lema'ncd for
the next two days. On September 21st, Oxley and his
party reached the eastern limit of the tableland, from
whence they descended lo Mount Sea-View.
When Oxley crossed the New England tableland, in
he encountered natives who, as stated in h : s Journ-
a| from the whole tenor of their behaviour, had pre-
viously heard of white people’ and upon continuing h s
journey southerly from Port Macquarie along the coast,
16 f° ur >d in Chowder Bay a small boat, half buried in the
s and, and the remains of a hut which had evidently been
constructed by Europeans: the saw and axe having been
employed on it.' From these and other indications it
would appear that adventurous bushmen, free and other-
wise, had already explored to some extent the coastal
and tableland regions, especially the former, lying far
beyond the recognised limits of settlement.
When it became known in Britain that rich pasture
lands had been discovered beyond the range of moun-
tains which for a quarter of a century had confined set-
tlement to a limiteel portion of the coastal region, immi-
giation, especially of pastoralists, became mere pro-
nounced.
From the early part of 1822, Lo the end of the jear
1825 all pai ts of the colony made extraoidira’y advance"
in settlement, and consequently added considerably to its
respectability and importance.
The rapid prog less of pastoral settlement akng (he
Hunter River and its tributaries, as described by H.
Dangar, was continued northerly beyond the limits of
settlement, and by the end of 1831 the so-cailed waste
lands of the colony had become exploited in that direc-
tion up to the New England tableland. The lend of
this pastoral occupancy was naturally directed along the
roam creeks and rivers that drain the open valleys of the
Namoi basin, but little information, other than tradi
tional, seems to be available respecting the personnel
and doings of the pioneers outside the limits of settle-
ment.
1 he squatting invasion of New England (according to
Gardner) commenced in 1832, when Hamilton Collins
Sepill, of Beltrees, Hunter River, from his out-station,
EMerstone, crossed the ‘boundary' (Liverpool Range) with
his stock, and following approximately the Gieat Divid-
ing Range north-easterly to the Hamilton Valley of Ox-
ley, foimed a station in the upper Apsley Val ey, which
hq named Wolka (Walcha), with headquaiters on the flat
near where Oxley pitched his camp on the evening of
September Bth 1818.
About the same time Edward Qostwyck Cory, a set-
tler, also from the Hunter district (Page's River and the
Paterson, and a ‘squatter’ on the Peel River, about where
Tamworth is now situated) is said to have passed ovei
the Moonboy Range along the route of the Great North
ern Road from Tamworth, which route, it is also staled,
was previously discovered by him, and, proceeding north-
erly, he camped for a time on one of the upper tributar-
its of Carlyle's Gully. This tributary streamlet still
bears the name of Cory's Camp Creek, and where the
camp stood may be seen in the Dog-Iran paddcck of
Rimbanda. A memorial of his ascent to the 'tableland is
also seen in the form of a rock at the foot of (he second
Moonboys, known to the present day as Cory’s Pil’ow.
Cory, evidently finding that the granite country, on
which he had temporarily settled, was unsuitable for
the healthy maintenance of sheep, moved over the low
ridge to the Salisbury Waters, the tableland there being
chiefly of slate formation and sound sheep country. It ip
not definitely known on what part of the majn stream


Cory first formed his homestead, but it is surmised tha
Gostwyck was his headquarters for a time. Later on he
established himself at Terrible Vale, about where the
present station is situated, while the representative of
William Dangar occupied the lower part of the valley
with the homestead,, Gostwyck included.
Chilcott, who appears to have been the first occupant
of Kentucky run, had evidently fixed his homestead on
the rivulet called Kentucky Ponds, about four miles be-
low the present homestead, near the junction of Chil-
cotfs Swamp and Church Gully. This position agrees
approximately with the distance (by bush track) from
Gostwyck, as given by O’Neil in his evidence.
The discoveries which led to pastoral occupation of
Cory’s New England were continued ‘By Messrs James
and Alexander McDougall and Alexander Campbell, who
(writes Gardner) in March, 1835, started on an expedi-
tion to examine the country now named New Engand.
and at the time unexplored.' These explorers evidently
followed Oxley’s trail to the tableland, their subsequent
course being described as due north to lilbuster, which
station was then in the course of formation. From
that locality they proceeded easterly, and then northerly,
locating suitable positions for stations en route. Some
two years later Campbell settled on his Macintyre occu-
pancy, which he named Inverell.
With reference to the activity by squat-
ters, about this time, in the appropriation of the coun-
try lying generally to the north of the latitude of Armi-
dale, the following statements were made by Mrs Susan
Bundarra Young (dale of interview not given.):
Abington was taken up first by Mr John Cameron,
He was one of the first pioneers to come to New Eng-
land. In or about the year 1841 he sold it to Mr Barlow',
who, years afterwards, disposed of it to Henry and
George Morse.
Laura Creek was taken up by Smith and Baker in or
about 1839. It still belongs to the latter's family.
Hloneyhatter was taken up by Mr Tom Hall, of
Dai (brook. It now belongs to the Hayes.'
The following list of pioneer squatters and their
lespective squattages is arranged in accordance with
the sequence of occupancy, as far as known,

The craze for land, which had induced men of all
ranks and professions to try their luck in squatting, hav-
ing run its course, was followed by probably the most
serious depression our pastoral industry has experienced,
and this depression was more apparent on the Tableland
than elsewhere, owing to the greater disabilities of tran-
sit and the adverse climatic conditions of the winter
months. When stock became almost unsaleable, except
for the tallow their carcases yielded, the upland runs, as
a matter of course, also became more or less valueless,
and so much so was this the case that at auction sales
of bankrupt stock the purchaser was frequently given
the rights of occupancy, if he so desired.
Hitherto the uncertainty to tenure had largely pre-
vented the effecting of useful improvements of a more
or less permanent character, the land remaining practic-
ally in its wild state, and the structures which constitu-
ted the homesteads, being of the most primitive kind.
Frequently a ’bark humpy' and a bough yard for sheep
were the only indications of occupancy rights to the
thousands of acres around. Under the leasehold system
however, enacted in 1847, genuine pastoral settlement
became more apparent.
When the pioneer pastoralists of New England
leached that Tableland they found it an extensive tract
of well watered woodland country, interspersed with
numerous lightly timbered patches of grass land, but the
coarse and sour character of much of the pasturage, to-
gether with the inclement winters, and the difficulty of
access to the Tableland from the east, south, and south-
west, militated somewhat against permanent or at least
perennial occupancy in its earlier stages. It was soon
observed that the granite country on tire west, and the
basaltic ranges on the south and in other places, were
unsuitable for the healthy maintenance of sheep all the
year round, and especially in wet seasons. The early
squatters on these two classes of coqntry had therefore
to abandon sheep and stock with cattle, or move with
their slteep to more suitable pasturage. Hence the fre-
quent changes of occupancy which, being unrecorded,
obscure much of the early history or pastoral settle-
ment.
The troubles which beset pastoral pioneering, espec-
ially on the tableland, were many and varied. Apart from
the ordinary discomforts of bush life as then experienc-
ed, the visits of bushrangers, the destruction of stock by
aboriginees, and the delinquencies of many of the assign-
ed servants were causes of annoyance and unrest, and
occasionally the loss of life itself. The following ex-
tract from a memorial to Governor Bourke, portrays the
troube which pressed upon these pioneer pastoralists in
this direction: —‘We beg leave to add our own personal
knowledge of the fact that the interior of the colony is
infested by gangs of cattle stea\ers and otner disorderly


persons, whose depredations are carried on to an alarm-
ing extent. These gangs consist of freed men, who have
served short sentences, or those of long sentences hold-
ing tickets-of-leave, who combine with the assigned ser-
vants to plunder the herds of their masters. Many of
these men are known to possess large herds of cattle,
obtained in a very short time by series of schemes for
stealing them' (Sydney Herald, April 11, 1836).
In reviewing the bushranging and other lawless acts
incidental to the convict days, by aid of information
gleaned from law court proceedings and Press narratives
etc., one cannot fail to perceive that ‘man's inhumanity
to man' gave rise to many retaliatory offences of a more
or less serious nature, which could leadily have been av-
erted. The earliest recorded instance of bushranging on
the tableland occurred about the beginning of the year
1836, at Saumarez (Armidale) regarding which notice
has already been taken. The bushrangers in this in-
stance were absconders from the service of the few
squatters who had established themselves cn that por-
tion of the tableland, but their misdemeanours appear to
have been confined to robberies only.
The bellicose attitude of the aboriginees on the
tableland, as elsewdiere, began when their localities he*
came overrun by the stock of the squatters. The
blacks naturally lesented the intrusion of the whites
with their flocks and herds, and both paities soon com-
menced a war of extermination. Fearing.the firearms of
the intruders, the natives devoted their "attention to
the slaughter of the stock, and, when opportunity pre-
sented, of the shepherds and herdsmen as well. In retali-
ation the conquering whites, while making application to
the government for protection, which they scarcely ex-
pected, ensured the granting of such relief in other ways
’the following extracts, taken mostly from the Syd-
ney Herald, will indicate the attitude of tke New Eng
land aborigines in defence of their upland homes:
Sydney Herald, of December 10, 1838;- ‘Mr Cruik-
shanks at (Mihi Greek) New England, had a shepherd
murdered in the hush, and some sixty or seventy sheep
stolen.'
Sydney Herald, of January 27, 1842: - ‘Letters have
been received in town stating that the b'acks had at
tacked the station of Robeit Ramsay Mackenzie, Esquire
(Salisbury run), murdered a shepherd and driven off
1,300 sheep, and burned down two huts. Ti e district is
without police, Mr Commissioner Macdonald and his
party having been ordered by the Governor- to proceed
to Moreton Bay.
Sidney Morning Herald, of October 25, 1844: ‘A poor
fellow at Marsh's station (Sa'isbury) New England, nar-
rovvly escaped with his life, a short time ago, whilst-
tending a .flock of .sheep. The blacks surrounded him
imd threw .several spears at him, one of which penetrated
bis body some inches. He shot the nearest, and the oth-
-ors t-iew off a short distance, which enabled the poor
fellow to get behind a tree and break the end of the
spear off. By the help of his dogs, he was able to head
his sheep up to the station (a distance of six miles
ITom his hut, which was plundered) where the point of
the spear was extracted.
Prior to railway communication, the principal line o?
traffic to and from the tableland followed the route of
the Great Northern road, via Tamworth, but the two
hundred and fifty mies of poorly formed roadway to the
shipping ports about Newcastle consumed so much time
in the transit of wool and goods, etc., that efforts were
made to reach the coast by a nearer route.
On May 21, 1839, George James Macdonald was ap-
pointed Commissioner of Crown Lands for the New
England district. He fixed his ‘head station’ as stated in
his first report, :on an extensive open plain, well water-
ed and sheltered, centrally situated and contiguous to the
extensive establishments of Messrs Mackenzie, Dangar,
and Durnaresq. This station he called Armidale, after
the baronial estate of Lord Macdonald, a Scottish noble-
man. The Commissioner's staff according to the official
returns of 1843, consisted of eleven men, seven of whom
were mounted constables or border police, selected from
the soldier convicts.
the turf was then, as it is to-day, the leading out-
door sport of squatters. On April 4, 1842, horse racing
was held for the first time at Armidale, and the follow
ing owners of horses were present: —Messrs McLean,
Roberts, Cheeke, Maister, Campbell, Perry, Parke, C. Mc-
Leod, A. W. Robertson, C. Marsh, Steel, Probart, Cruik-
shanks, M. W. Marsh, Fenwick, Clarke, Baker and Tourle.
The meeting lasted two days and part of a third, and
the ‘owners usually rode their own horses.'
THE TABLELAND PASTURAGE PRIOR TO SETTLE
WENT.
As the seemingly abundant pasturage of the New
England Tableland was the incentive to settlement in
that elevated region, a few general remarks regarding
the composition and character of such pasturage and its
forest flora may not bo ultra licitum from an histone
point of view.
As already slated, thus plateau was an extensive
liaet of woodland country, timbered with some fifteen
species of eucalyptus of tree dimensions. The forest
flora naturally adjusted itself to the surface and sub-
soil conditions of the various geological fonr.ations, and
this natural tendency of the timbers to group was an ex-
cellent guide to observant squatters in choosing their
occupancies for the healthy maintenance of sheep. It
was soon observed that the absorbent slate country
yielded the best results, from a pastoraMst's point of
view, and that such country was more or less clearly in-
dicated by the character and condition of its forest
flora. The slate ridges were usually monopolised by the
‘stringy barks’ especially the species botanically known
as E. eugenioides and E. capitellata, both of which were
largely used in the building of homesteads. Immediate-
ly off the ridges and along the shallow valleys, the .Pep-
permints (E.Stuartiana and E. amygda'na) intermingled
with the White and Red Gums (E. viminalis and E. ter-
eticornis) and other species.
The other formations, especially the basalt, were
similarly wooded with certain species peculiar to each,
hut while the vegetation of the granite country was


sparse anti indifferent, that of the basalt, in manv
places, densely covered the ground.
The pasture plants of the Tableland consisted large-
ly of true grasses, which, being surface-rooters, wer?
more or less cosmopolitan in their habits of growth, bu\
notwithstanding their indifference to location and condi-
tions of sub-soil, most of them required direct sunshine
for the true development of their fattening properties
hence the indifferent average carrying capacity of fom>
acres to a sheep, as estimated by the pastoralists prior
to the destruction of the timber.
Of the many species of Australian grasses that car-
peted our northern uplands in the early days, only the
more abundant kinds, and those with conspicuous inflor-
escence, seem to have been noticed and named by the
pastoralists, such as /Kangaroo grass’ (Therr.eda) ‘Wild
sorghum’ (Sorghum Milumosum) ‘Wallaby grass’ (Dan-
thomia) ‘Blue grass’ (Andropogon), Tussock grass’ (poa)
'Star grass’ (Chloris), and several others, but the major-
ity of the indigenous grasses were, and still are, dis-
tinguished by the scientific names only.
Under the influence of a fair average rainfall, which
in those days appears to have been more pronounced ant
regular than that of later years, the vegetation of th >
tableland grew apace dining the summer months, but
the low temperature and bleak westerly winds of the
winter months caused a suspension of growth, especially
on the more elevated and exposed portions of the plat-
eau, and heavy frosts soon impaiied or altogether de-
stroyed the nutrient properties of the summer grasses.
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND PIONEER ‘SQUATTERS*
EDWARD GOSTWYCK CORY.
EDWARD GOSTWYCK CORY, whose explorations on the
tableland north to Tamworth led to the eaily occupancy
of that portion of New England, was born in Devonshire
(England) in 1797, and is said to have been related to the
Corys of Hartland and Cardiff. We are also informed,
that he was the ’eldest son of John Cory, grandson of Sir
William Gostwyck’ of Willington, near Bedford.
The Cory brothers, Edward f Gostwyck and John
Johnson (the latter known as Cory, of the Royal
Navy), arrived in New South Wjales early in the twenties
of last century, and settled on. land giants front ng the
Patterson River, named respectively ’Gostwyck’ and ‘Cory
Vale.’ They also acquired land, by purchase, on Page■«
River (adjoining the village of Blandford), which pro-
perty they called ’Beckham’ (now Bickham), a name of
Anglo-Saxon origin denoting ’a home on a brock.’
Like most of their fellow-pastoralists in tke Hunter
district, whose land grants were inadequate for theii
lequiiements, they found it necessary to become ‘squat-
ters’ beyond the limits of location, and accordingly thr
elder brother, E. G. Coiy, who was reputed to he an ex-
cellent bushman, went norther y from their squatlage on
the Peel River in or about the year 1831, to explore th)
tableland region now known as the Armidale district.
As stated elsewhere, Cory and his party reached thg
tableland by the route which is now the Great Northern
road, and fixed his first encampment on one of the upper
tributaries of Carlyle’s Gully (near Rimbanda head sta-
tion). Soon becoming awaie, however, of the good sheep
country over the low range on the eastern slones, Corv
moved his cam]) to the Salisbury Waters, and appears
to have formed his head station at ‘Gostwyck’ with an
out-station at ‘lerrible Vale.' Having evidently d sposed
°1 lower portion of his occupancy to Dangar. in or
about the year 1835, he resided for a .time a.t Terrible
Vale. (See proceedings of the Supreme Ccuit in the case
‘The Crown v Thomas Walker’ in November 4th 1836).
Later on ne sold his reduced occupancy (Terribl)
Vale and Salisbury Plains) to Robert Ramsay Mackenzie.
(It may be stated that, presumably with respect to this,
transaction, Cory lost £7,397, Mackenzie having been un-
fortunate in subsequent years). (Sge insolvency p.oceed-
ings in the Sydney Morning Herald of July 11, 1844).
During the latter part of his life Cory resided on liis
Gostwyck property of live thousand acres, which is situ-
ated at the junction of the Allyn River with the Patter-
son. He died on March 7, 1873.
In conjunction with his pastoral put suits, Co y con-
ducted agricultural operations, as was usually conditional
in those days, and he opened a flour mill on his Patter-
son property in 1834, particulars of which woe duly ad-
veitiscd in the ..Sydney Herald of the times. In 1833 he.
nearly lost i.is life at the hands of one of his ass'gne' 1 ,
servants, named Coleman, for which assault Coleman was
executed. In t 1835 he sued the Editor of The Colonist
for defamation of character. The editor frankly acknow-
ledged the mistake he had made, but was nevertheless
lined Kl 5.
From time to time Cory filled important public of-
fices of a local character. He was also a member of th <
magistracy.
HEMIIY DANGAR, OF GOSTWYCK.
HENRY DANGAR. came to New South Wales in 1821
Shortly after his arrival he was engaged by the Govern-
ment as Assistant Surveyor under Oxley, and continued in
the service until 1827, when he letumed to England.
About two years later he entered the seiviee of the Aus-
tralian Agricultural Company, and again letumed to the
colony. In June 1833, he left the company's employ and
settled on the land. While in the company’s service in
1831-33 lie was largely instrumental in locating the ex-
change giants 'Warrah' and ‘Peel River' also the connect-
ing route between the coastal and inland grants by way
of Nowendoc, Callaghan’s Swamps and the Nundlj spur,
which route is probably the earliest defined by suivey
outside the limits of location'. While engaged on this
work he apparently inspected a portion of the tableland
as far north as Oxley’s route, as indicated by very old
survey markings that were still to be seen in 1886, along
the slightly elevated ridge which here forms the Great
Dividing Range, between the eastein and western waters.
As a pastoralist, Dangar was eminently successful
and his public utterances, both in and out of Par.iament.
indicate a lively interest in the affairs of the settlement.


DB . WILLIAM BELL CARLYLE, OF CARLYLE’S GULLY.
DR. W. B. CARLYLE, Surgeon Superintendent of
Transport Vesels, finally landed in Sydney in 1827, and
settled on his grant of 2000 acres, Invermein, in the
Hunter Valley. About eight years later he joined the
New England pioneer squatters, and occupied a tribut-
ary valley of the Muluerindie River, which was named
Carlyle’s Gully. He was unfortunate in the choice of
this squattage, as the country lies within the New Eng-
land granite belt, which formation, in its unimproved
condition, was, and still is, especially in drooping sea-
sons, unsuitable for the healthy maintenance of sheep.
Having disposed of his Hunter River property to Clerk
and Rankin in 1836, which sale evidently carried the
rights of his Tableland occupancy, Carlyle’s Gully, he
moved to the Port Macquarie district, where he resided
for the remainder of his life. His death occurred on
September 5 1844, regarding which the local coirespond-
ent of the Sydney Morning Herald writes: ‘ln the dis-
charge of his public duties Dr. Carlyle bad ranked for
years as one of the first magistrates of the Commission,
and in private life he bore an inestimable character. The
inhabitants of Port Macquarie, where he has resided for
the last ten or twelve years, have entered into a sub-
scription for a marble slab, which they propose to erect
in his memory in St. Thomas’ Church.
ROBERT RAMSAY MACKENZIE, OF SALISBURY.
R. R. MACKENZIE was the third son of Sir George
Mackenzie of Coul, Scotland. He arrived in New South
Wales in or about the year 1826, and settled for a time,
on the Williams River. In 1837 he purchased from E. G.
Cory, as already stated, the occupancy rights, stock, etc.
of Salisbury, New England, which then included the ad-
joining run, Terrible Vale. He subsequently acquired two
other tableland occupancies, viz., Furracabad and Ballin-
dean. His runs he placed under the superintendence of
managers, and preferring the social advantages of city
life, he resided in Sydney. This easy attitude respecting
his ruial interests may have partly led to his undoing in
1844, when he was found to be £20,000 short of his lia-
bilities. 'this considerable sum, however, was hugely
owing to the great falling in the value of stock, for
which he had not provided, sheep and cattle having be-
come almost unsaleable excepting for the tallow their,
carcases produced, and occupancies, in consequence, prac-
tically worthless. But Mackenzie was an optimistic man
and would appear to have elebrated his clearance by
marrying Richard Jones’ daughter and proceeding to
Queensland’. He soon became ‘a squatter whose inter-
ests weie large and prosperous’.
H. S. Russell, in his Genesis of Queensland, writes of
him as follo\ys: ‘Hob Mackenzie, of Salisbury, became
Sir Robert, dwelt on the Brisbane in after years, and
took his part ministering to infant Queensland’.
He. was Colonial Treasurer from 1859 to 1862, and
Premier in the fifth Ministry. He died in Scotland while
on a visit there.
JOHN MORSE AND THOMAS TOURLE, OF BALALA.
In the Sydney Herald of September 13 1839, notice
was given of the arrival from Plymouth of the Rev. Mn
Morse, Lady, and three daughters, Mr. Morse Jnr., Mr
Tourle and Mr Croft. More exact information as re-
gards the identity (also subsequent relationship) of the
parties concerned may be gleaned from the following
matrimonial intimation, which appeared in the Sydney
Morning Herald of July 1846:—‘On the 7th inst., Thomas
Tourle Esq., of Balala, New England, late of Landport.
in the county of Sussex, to Hellen Martha Emma, eldest
daughter of the Rev. John Morse, Chaplain, of Scone, and
late Rector of Huntly, Gloucester.’
With regard to ‘squatting’ on this area, it may he
stated that, notwithstanding the lapse of five or six
years, during which pastoral exploitation was in pro-
gress on the east and north-east, no effort appears to
have been made to form Balala into a separate pastoral
holding prior to its occupancy by Morse and Tourle, for
the simple reason that the raw granite soils of the area
offered btrt'-'Tittle inducement to,, permanent occupation
w’hile better country was available.
Balala remained in possession of Morse and Tourle
until about 1881, when it was transferred to the late
Richard Hudson.
FREDERICK CRUIKSHANKS, OF MiHI CREEK.
FREDERICK CRUIKSHANKS’ name appears on the
earliest official list of New England pioneer squatters as
shown in the Government Gazette notices of 1837. He
occupied the Mihi Creek Valley and the upland country
lying to the east (Enmore). Two or three years later he.
entered into partnership with George Jenkins, which
joint interest continued until about the year 1843, when
a division of the holding was made. In 1848 Cruikshanks
ham Ted over his interest in the valley to his cieditors,
but retained Enmore* hence the tripait division of the
occupancy in that year.
RIMBANDA AND LOOANGA.
r lhe upper tributary valleys of Carlyle’s Gully was
the camping ground of travelling stock in the early days
and Cory’s camp was a prominent feature in the itinerary
of stockmen en route, but, notwithstanding its popular-
ity and publicity as a camping ground, no lengthy occu-
pation of the valley was taken until about 1843, when
the Buchanan Bros entered into possession. The holding
was then divided, the main >1 team forming the boundary
common to both.

FIELD 1852
The discoveries of gold in Australia was largely re-
sponsible for the early settlement of the Colonies from
thq late forties, although the Home Government held the
attitude that tlie country was serving a sufficiently use-
fur purpose as a Convict settlement.
When the-means of communication in those days was
taken into consideration, the thought that Australia
might some day be one of the Empire’s most precious
possessions existed as a dicam In the minds of very few
of the then ‘Empire Builders.’
It is a wellknown fact that gold was knowm to exist
many years before any proclamation was made. r lhe
position was most difficult for our prospectors for, to
make an open declaration of a gold find then was hazar-
dous in the opinion of those in authority. When Mr
Hargraves waited on Mr Deas Thompson with a few pel-
lets of gold in Ids hand the population was about 35,vXK
people, consisting largely of Convicts, and there was" "a
fear that a gold rush would result in the end of all dis-
cipline; the Convicts would get out of hand and instead
of progress it would probably mean chaos. Mr Thompson
however, did not altogether hold to these ideas. He con-
tended that theie was an opportunity to encourage the
correct class of settlement; to aid the pastor a’iss aid
to bring prosperity speedily to the country.
Gold, contrary to the general belief, was fadly
found, discoveries following one another very closely and
within one year of the official discoveries by Hargiaves,
almost every field in the Colonies of New South Walei
and Victoria was discovered.
'ihe Rocky River Gold Field was discovered prior-to
1852 and was originally proclaimed on the June
1856; this proclamation was later cancelled and included
within the Sandon Gold Field proclamation of tlie 30th
June 1807.
Alluvial mining on the Rocky River was, apparent-
ly. first commenced in December 1852, Mr Robert G.
Massey, Crown Lands Commissioner, reporting on the
24th Mfirch 1853 that tfie Licences to dig issped by )iim
from the first discovery to the end of March totalling
538, made up as follows: —
December 1852, 40 Licenses.
January 1853, 94 licenses.
February 1853, 221 licenses.
March 1853 183. licenses.
In a further report the same officer advised ti at be
tween the 3rd and sth June 1854 he took a Census,
which showed that there were 86 Tents on the Fie;d and
a population of 350, comprising 193 Males, 58 Females
and 99 children.
At this time very little was known about gold
mining or tli'e various formations which carried gold, and
no Geological reports were on record to assist the Min-
ers; evitlfetly the digging of gold during 1852 to 1850
was confined to the river and creeks.
the names of the Miners to whom
the origiffaF4icenses were issued are not available, but
the discovery of the deep leads is credited to a Mr J.
Jones, who, in 1856, accidently-found an outcrop of gold-
bearing sand.
PreAiious to this, however,, gold was discovered in tha
river a point about 3 miles west of Sydney Flat, now
called Maitland Point, where some very rich dirt was ob-
tained.
the location of the find by Jones has been named
after him (Ml Jones). It was then found that the gold-
bearing sand continued under the basalt, which caps
most of the. leads of this locality, and the working of
one of the richest and one of the most consistent deep
leads v ever found in this country followed. From the
outcrop the ground was worked north under the fcasa 1 !
on the eastern side of Mt Jones, and then followed furth-
er north across Sydney Flat, the yield in many instance;}
leaching 4 to 6 ounces of gold to a small green hide
bag of dirt. Mr D. G. Scardon, acting Crown Lands
Commissioner, reporting on the 18th March 1856, staled
that 200 men were working on Jones’ new find on Rocky
River, and that there were only solitary instances of.
failu-re to win payable gold. Me also staled that I°,
parties of Miners, one of which was J. Jones and party,
won approximately 2000 ounces.
Thus the largo field was opened up and employment
found for many Miners, and it is believed that about
5000 people were living on the Rocky when the field was
at its zenith.
Under the mining Law's at that time one man could
only hold 400 s«j ft. under a mining claim, and this ac-
counts for the numerous old shafts which still exist.
'i he escoi I lelurns from 1858 to 1874 lecord the
gold despatched from Rocky River amounting to 118,821
ounces valued at 1467,293. These figures do not take into
account any gold which may have been personally taken
away by diggers, or forwarded by means other than by
the official escort.

1 dun cl along tire whole belt. A great number of leases
were tal cn up in the vicinity of the Enmore Consolidat-
ed. a gcod read constructed to the mine, and a stamp
i: il lof the latest design erected. The only oxidised
ore cn the lenses came from the rich shutc, from which
the return cf 11 oz. to the ten was recovered. Primitive
methods of treatment were largely responsible lor the
discont inuar.ee of many operations, the use of cyanide a-:
a gold solvent being then practically unknown.
Twentv years ago numerous samples of. ore were
taken from reefs other than the rich slrule in this lo-
cality, and tlresc averaged 26 dvvts. to the ton.
Gold extraction methods have improved since this
mine was abandoned and It is possible that its working
still he a profitable undertaking.
A feature worth notice on this bell is the occur-
rence of gold in the country rock adjacent to the lode
proper, and is so found of the Kalgoorlie (W.A.) belt
At the 100 ft level in the Kalgurli mine the lode was UP
feet wide, onf which' not more than five per cent v a
quartz, the balance being country rock, 'the values, how
ever - , were always there and the mill average was 60
per ton, and the monthly yield about .'‘12,500. Thcrs i

Work is usually ceased when 11m free gold vamshes am

conditions of this class of mining, the ore should he o

purposes arc plentiful.
There arc possibilities in tlvs field fer a ’a* go m'n

to the mining industry in New Eng’and.
FRUITGROWING
Fruit growing in the Uralla oistrict forms a very
important section of our agricultural industry, the soil
being specially suited. The grarctic soil favors the ex-
tensive growing c f apples, while peaches, cherries and
pears favor the soil of volcanic origin, both soils heine
in abundance in this d.btiict.
The rainfall arc! climate assure the successful grow-
ing of all English fruits, such as app'es, pears, cherries,
peaches, plums, and apricots.
Two of our principal markets are Brisbane and the
North-west of New South Vales, where a high repu-
tation for- quality is steadily maintained. This reputa-
tion is well deserved and jealously safeguarded by care-
ful pruning of trees and the adoption of the latest mod-
ern methods of storing and packing.
Lectures and demonstrations are frequently aj- a’ g-
ed by officers of the Department of Agriculture, whi'c
the Uralla Fruit Growers Association (W, H. Crapp, Sec-
retary) purchases, in bulk, supplies for the members, and
in many ways protects the interests of the Orcharci st s.
Each individual grower markets iris own fruit, lut
every case bears the imprint of Uralla.
Record prices are maintained each year, as much as
22 being received for a quarter bushel case of cherries
while the average return for the season exceeds 16 per
case.
Apples, too, are considered to be of the best qua ity
marketed in Brisbane, many growers receiving up to 25
per bushel case.
The*.-fallowing varieties c f (!>' itVj aic St.
Margaret, Florence, Early Lyons, and others.
Apples include Granny Sn Jonati a y Fonv
Beauty,' Democrat, Five Crown and Fame rs^^S'liil' p~ar;-
are represented by Bartlett, I'acl l a'ii, W'ntm
Cole, Wfhtcr Nellis, Buerre Bose.
Cherfics are marketed in November and Drc.'nhrr
peaches apricots and plums in December and January
whiles the apples follow in February, Match, Apiil and
May.
Four y’bars ago the Granny Sn ith was cors’d red fit
for cooking. bnly and it is a great tribute to the vat ic t y
that this, as grown in. Uralla, is new considcicd the most
delicious apple on the Brisbane market. r \ ivs a) pie im-
proves with age, and many eases I a* c been in cell stor-
age from the previous season to this date.
Eaeli year secs the demand for fruit increarirg and
while young orchards arc in evidence everywhere, many
many areas arc being enlarged. In 1924 season the ap-
proximate output exceeded '50,000 eases of all the above
varieties.
The Railway service to Brisbane is excellent, cherne.
reaching the market in 16 hours.
While not entirely free from pests, they are wed
under control, and the district is free of black-spec, and
practically free of the fruit-fly.
Thousands of acres of suitable land at most reason-
able prices are still available for fruit-growing.

Development work commenced dining July, 1918, and

PRODUCTION.
The estimated u turns from the irohads for 1920
arc between B,UO ard 10,000 bushels of apples, 1.500
bushels of Pears, 300 bushels Angelina Burdctt pi uni!-,
and 800 bushels of Prunes.
The estimated average returns from apples an*
years when the frees reach 1 he- full homing age are up-
proxirnaictly 250 to 300 bushels per acre.
Agieullural crops such as Potatoes, Swedes, Maize.
Oaten and wheaten hay can be grown successfully by ap-
plying fertilisers and good cultivation, while goosebe •


ries, green peas, onions, and other vegetables do very
well.
The small holdings allow of intense cultural meth-
ods by applying rotation of crops and thus help the
settler along until the orchard returns are sufficient to
allow of specialising in production of fruit. Cue draw-
back to the successful production of such crops as Maize
and Potatoes is the liability to severe frosts in the sum-
mer months during some years. The crop returns for
1924 will give some idea of the value the Soldiers' Set-
tlement is to the district.

PROGRESS d FUTURE PROSPECTS.
A c'ay spent on the Settlement will show that the
soldier settlers have made good progress and show an
aptitude and enthusiasm for their occupation. The
various phases of the work, viz. various methods of
cultivation, pruning, spraying, together with the harvest-
ing, grading and packing of the fruit are grasped in a
practical way and carried out in a workmanlike manner.
The prospects of the industry are bright. A
splendid market awaits development in northern New
South Wales, while for the present production a ready
market is found in the Brisbane Fruit Exchanges. The
varieties planted, from a market point of view, are of
the very best allowing of a shipping season from January
until October of the favouiite market sorts. The quality
of the fruit grown in the Kentucky district is excel-
lent and a great demand has set in owing to the cleanli
ness of the district from fruit pests and diseases and
the keeping quality of the fruit together with a good
colour and exquisite flavour.
In addition to the planting of fruit .trees by me
Government, many settlers have purchased from their
own funds and planted assorted fruit trees. Since the
commencement of the Soldiers' Settlement in 1918, six-.-
teen settlers have vacated their holdings and returned to
their pre-war trades etc., while six others have found
men to take over their holding, the incoming man paying
a substantial monetary consideration lor the opportunity
offered in respect of crops and piivate expenditure for
permanent improvements.
Ihis article on Kentucky Soldiers’ Settlement would
not be complete without a short review of the Social
side of the Settlement in which the Ladies take a very
prominent part.
THE COUNTRY WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION.
A movement was set on foot by Mrs A. G. Rodger,
during September, 1923 and a branch, of the Association
was formed in January 1924. The Executive for ti c op-
ening year was, Mrs Lind Taylor, President, Mrs Mac-
Fhcrson, Vice-President, Mrs L. J. Bird, Hon, Treasur-
er, Mrs A. G. Rodger, Hon Secretary. The Society had a.
very successful year, attaining, their main objects, viz.
the establishing of a branch of the Bush Nursing Associ-
ation, and a Branch of the Bush Book Club. In addi-
tion, a promise of help has been received from tlni
Hehd Quarters of the Association towards financing the
building of Nurse’s quarters.
BUSH NURSING ASSOCIATION.
A branch was inauguiated on Ist July, 1924. The
fust executive committee being Mr C. B. Colless. Presi-
dent, Mrs A. G. Rodger, Vice-President, Mrs R. C.
Adamson, Honorary Secretary and Terasurer.
Committee of Management:—Mesdames Bashford and
Brecht and Messrs A. W. Brecht and F. J. Cupples.
The objects of the branch is to supervise nursing fa-
cilities within an approximate distance of five miles
from the ‘Diggers Hall.'
Nurse F. Morrison has been installed in charge of
the nursing with very beneficial results. The Digge:s’
Hall has been chosen for the present as the central con-
sulting room. For the six months approximately 20(1
cases, mostly home cases, and 50 minor casual!ties have
been attended to successfully by Nurse Morrison.
The Committee this year are negotiating for the:
erection of quarters for the Nurse in conjunction with a
maternity ward.
HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.
The Kentucky Horticultural Society have held two
very successful Shows launched by the Diggers and j a-
tronised splendidly by the residents of the distiict. It is
hoped that the show will blossom into an annual event.
The first show was held in March 1922; Mr F. J.
Cupples being the organiser and Honorary Secretary.
The effort of 1924, proceeds in aid of the Church of
England Building Fund, eclipsed the 1922 show. The
Executive Committee was;
Messrs F. G. Taylor, Patron, F. J. Cupples, Presi-
dent, J. W. McKay, Hon. organiser, H. C. Smith, Hen
orary Secretary.
A strong working Committee helped the show along
to success. There were 90 classes with approximately
300 entries; the prize money totalling £l2. An attract-
ive sports programme during the afternoon and a danco
at night combined to allow of the sum of £sl being
handed over to augment the Church Building Fund.
ANZAC DAY. Commemoration and Sports.
The 25th April 1921 was the first occasion on which
Anzac Day was, by mutual consent of the Soldier Set-


tiers ard residents, held as a Public holiday. A com-
bined Church Service held in the open during the morn-
ing and an attractive programme of Military Sports,
brought to a happy finish daring the afternoon, con-
cluded the ‘Diggers' celebration of Anzac Day. May we
sec many such social gatbeiings.
The sports programme of 1921 was organised by Mr
C. B. Colless with Mr A. J. Burton as Honorary Secre-
tary.
As a close to this article let us mention the
District War Memor’al, ‘Nofhmba’ Avenue, r. o g vvl i *h
have been planted 18 trees to commemorate the iron
of the district who enlisted for Active Service, li 1 his

making another town centre has commence:). It is Vm

ful fulfilment of the Solc'iers - a ; ms Ic realhed with orn-
iit to themselves and the district generally.
THE EARLY DAYS OF FARMING
While the bulk of the land in Uralla district is em-
inently suited to pastoral pursuits, there is also a fainy
large area of agricultural land. This latter applies par-
ticularly to the hills and slopes of the Main Divide.
Lying to the north and north-east of the town, embrac-
ing The Rocky, Arding, and Big Ridge, there is a num-
ber of farms. The nature of the soil is a chocolate
loam, with patches of heavy black soil. Some of the
best chocolate loam in the north is to be found, particu-
larly in the vicinity of Arding. Roughly the area of
good agricultural land in this portion of the district is
4000 to 5000 acres, and about 3000 to 4000 acres in the
Big Ridge region. In the Gostwyck, Salisbury and
Kentucky portions of the district there is also a fair
area of agricultural soil. The district will produce good
wheat, but is better adapted for growing ma : ze, pota-
toes and oats, at the present time these being the main
crops grown.
Prior to 1861, the whole of the land in this dhstiict
was held under big squattages. With the enactment cf
Sir John Robinson’s Land Act in that year, the selector,
or ‘cockie’ (as he was termed) made bis appearance. A
man named Hutchinson was the first selector under tb s
Act in these parts, the farm at present occupied by Mr
S. Berry, about 5 miles north of Uralla on the Great
Northern Road, being the identical land thus selected.
The next selector was Patrick Sullivan, who took up the
Sandon Forest property: and James Browning was the
third., taking up the land on which Metlncn Pari-;
homestead now stands. This was the commencement, ol
a series of selections, and it was not long before 1 It
best of the agricultural land was occupied.
The lot of the selector in those early days was not a
bed of roses. The living was rough. Damper and corn-
beef were the main standby, coupled with what vege-
tables were grown on the farm. Flour was poor in qual-
ity, and (be black sugar was often so solid that it could
only be cut with an axe. The houses were built ut
round timber, with hark roofs, rough split slabs lor the
walls, and the bare ground for a floor. Shutters took
the place of windows, and doors were n.ostiy made frem
split slabs. The only sawn timber procurable was out
by the old pit-saw worked by two men. Even (ho rcugn
pieces of furniture used were made from split timber in
many instances.
The good agricultural land was l.cav 1/ timlc ed,
very often frem 20 to 30 largo trees being found to ihe
acre, 'the clearing of such land was very heavy, slow
work, and only a few acres could be cleared each year.
The plant consisted of a single furrow plough and a
harrow, the frame of the latter being of wood. The
area of land ploughed per day would not exceed half an
acre. Cultivators were unknown, and tie only spr'ng
vehicle in use was the old spiing-cart—and very few’ of
these. In fact, it was a coir.men thing to sec the
farmer and his wife and family drive to town in a d ay
drawn by a single horse.
All the reaping was done by a scythe, and in har-
vest time, men worked 14 to 16 hours per day.
Maize was generally grown the first year, but wheat
was the staple crop, the caily farmers having to depend
on their home-grown wheat for supplies of flour for the
year.
The Great Northern Road to-day, on the Arm’dale
side of Saumarez creek, runs through what was former-
ly a wheat paddock. The maiks of eultivaCon can he
seen there to-day.
In tilc early days the grinding of wheat into flour
was mostly done by hand, but as the areas under culti-
vation increased, mills began to spring up in adjoimng
town. It is interesting to note in this connection that
at the time John McCrossin's mill was built it was the
largest and most up-to-date up north. When first built,
and for some years subsequently, it was worked all the
year round. It was last worked in the year 1893 by a
man named Reubens, who rented it for the purpose of
grinding a few hundred bugs of wheat.

sing the best health-giving climate in this Slate.
The town is by nature very well drained, possessing,
perhaps, the best natural drainage of any town in New
South Wales, lor, even within two hours of very heavy
rain, the streets have sufficiently dried to al ow p d:s-
trians to move without the least irxsnven'enc3.
First class accommodation for touiists is ava lab’%

their excellent surface, mating motoi ing to the .nurr-

Viewed from many of the heights, the gently slop-
ing valleys of the rich pastoral land form an impiessiv *
picture, while many avenues of stately elms, poplars and
other trees lend a distinctly English atmosphere.
Quite close to the town are two Lagocns where
boating and swimming are indulged in.
Two well shaded parks are within the Municipal
boundaries, and a public Tennis Court and a Nine Hole
Golf Course are available.

THE GREAT WAR.
A history of the Town and District, however brier
it is, would not be complete without some reference to
the part it has taken in the Empire’s struggles. Some
thirty of our young men volunteered and were accepted
for service in the South African War, while in the Great
War of 1914-18 about 40p men joined up withVthe A.I.F.
and saw active service in Gallipoli, Egypt, Palestine.
France, Belgium and of -the War. Of
these, no less than 68 laid down their lives
Tablets perpetuating the names of ail who joined
the colours have been erected in the churches and
schools, and the Memorial Gates to be officially dedicated
dui ing Back-to-Uralla Weew will eventually bear the
nair.es of all.

The Southern New England P. & A. Assn, was or-
ganised in 1873, and the first show held the following
year. Unfortunately the original minute book has been
mislaid; but of the third annual Show, held in 1876, we
icad that the attendance was 16C0 or 1700 and the ex-
hibits numbered G2O. For many years, Walcha district
combined with .Uralla in holding the Show. Among the
members of the committee in the early days were:-— G.

has continued a progressive policy in the matter of prize
money paid out each year, and undoubtedly has played a

VIEW OF URALLA RACECOURSE
The earliest records to which we have accr?,. wo .. t'-e
Tiroes of January 1877, show that the nniual ra<-emi;e.
ing of the Uralla Jockey Club wu* held on 'he Lago-m
course. In the early clays, races were held at Dangar’s
Lagoon, and in later years the mm so was prepaid ai
the site at present in use. The officials for the race-
meeting held on abovenamed date were; Judge; W . J.
Fletcher; Treasurer: Henry Roman; Societal/: J. H.
Watkins; Stewards: M. J. Walsh, Wm. Manuel. Rich-
ard Roberts, John Fletcher, Fred Taylor, and C. McL.
Marsh.
The results of the meeting were: —Maiden Plate, If-gin,
G. Gross’ Barrallen 1, R. Vickers’ Kingsborough 2.
Publican’s Purse, 1%m., F. Perry’s Honest John 1, R,
Dixon’s Coronet 2, J. Hamilton's Wombat 3. Ladies’
Purse, R• Vickers’ Cossack 1. G. Gross’ Tiaveller
2, D. Lynch’s Darkic 3. Hack Selling Stakes, mile heat;-
R. Vickers’ Faddy 1, W. Murray’s Traveller 2, J. Ward's
Soldier Boy 3. On the second day races were won by
Wombat (2), Coronet, Cossack, and Cress’ Traveller.
The Jockey Club has carried, on through varied fortune.
In recent years a progressive policy of Improving the
course and fixtures was observed. The course, itself has
been graded, and is now admitted to be one of the
best tracks in the north. A fence has been completed
to the mile peg, a grandstand erected (and latterly ad-
ded to), and the saddling paddock enlarged sufficiently
to provide for a ‘bird-cage.’ Three or four racemeetings
arc now held annually, generally with financial success.

URALLA f PORTS CLUB.
The Uralla Sports Club as at prc:ent constituted
was formed in 1920 with the dual object of reviving pro-
fessional footrunning and providing' an attractive pro-
gran" me of athletic events at Easter aaHSI year.
Prior to ihe v.ai iciiod a Bicycle and Spoils Club
was in existence, and cateied in an annual galheiing for
these sports, while, inn king back to son e llnec decades
ago, the annual gathering of the Ancient Order of For-
esters was always marked by big footrunning handicaps,
in which some of the champions of the continent com-
peted .
The olOceis of the present Club were: Patron, Ma-
jor Hay, M.H.R. President: T. C. Bragg. Committee:
Eev G. Cowie, M. Power, B. J. Davey, Edward Ferris;
G. Holdaway (Treasurer), and J. L. Father, (Sec.etaiy).
Pedestrians from all parts of N.S.W. and Queens-
land competed at the Club's initial meeting, held on Fas-
ter BMonday 1921, and it proved highly successful.
Meetings in subsequent y;ears have all been well patron-
ised, and the Uralla Sheffield, on Easter Monday . is now
regarded as one of the events of the Northern Table-
lands.
Since the Club's formation over £7OO has been paid
as prize-money. The principal race viz., 120yds hand-
cap, has been won by the following competitors:—l92l,
Robert Pitt, Roma (Qld), 11 fa yds. 1922, George F.
Bower, Emerald (Qld), 9'4 yds. 1923, Victor Murray,
Terara (N.S.W.), 13yds. 1924, Clive G. Gan ad, Manick-
ville (N.S.W., 12i ; .yds.

't-~: A Gudin son, Edward Ferris, W L. Elliott, R. G.
■ , Ernest Ferris, E. A. Neil, and A. F. Donahue.
URALLA RIFLE CLUB.
Uralla Ride Club had its genesis in the Volunteer
Rifle Corps of the 30’s. The officers and non-coms, in
the early days were; —Captain Richardson, Lieut. McMa-
hon, Sergt. Woodall, Sergf. McCrossin, Cpl. C. Thorpe.
Cpl. W. C. McCrossin, L.-cpl. Hickling, L.-cpl. W. H.
Crapp. There was a squad fifty strong, and a dark blue
uniform and helmet were adopted—leading to the name *
of The Dark Blues. A Photograph of the squad is ex-
! ant, but unfortuneately is not sufficiently clear for re- '
producing on a half-tone. Upon his return to Uralla aft-
er and absence of some years, Captain W. H, Crapp set '
about recusitating the Club, which secured a range lying
across Sawpit Gully, in the visinity of Mt. Mutton. W.
H. Crapp has remained the captain of the Club since it
was reformed. Monthly shoots are held, and a 1 so an
annual prize meeting, and these competitions are gener-
al! well patronised.
LRALLA CRICKET CLUB.
Since the district has been a nentity almost, cricket
has been one of its most popular pastimes, and enthusi-
asm for the game rekindles with the approach of every
season. .Among the players of the early days were such,
familiar names as E. and M. Scanlon, Ward, Dawson,
Tcurle, Fa’coner, Furniful, Mather, C. Marsh, Murphy,
A, Fletcher, Conolly, F G Taylor, A. Maclean, W. Ei. Ben-
re! t, G. Marsh, W. Taylor, C. Ferry, J. Thorley, R. Mac-
-1 ay, Among the district's notable players have been J.
R. M. Mackay, who attained international rank, and C. G.
('coper. Tiie latter has been playing the game for well
nigh half a century and still dons the flannels for ins
Club. Since Iho days of competition cricket, the Club
has had many successes, winning the district shield on
seveial occasions. At present the Club has team playing
in both senior and junior grades of the Association com-
] edition, and the several district centres have teams also,
URALLA BAND
The present Uralla District Band was formed in
March 1924 and now consists of sixteen players under
the baton of Bandmaster D. E. T. Pearson, with J. W.
Fuller as Deputy-Bandraa; ter. Considerable progress
has been made since its formation, and the liberal sup-
port received frem all parts of .the town and district is
sufficient proof of such an organisation fulfilling a useful
purpose in the social life of the community, and a con-
tinuance of the necessary financial assistance is desired
to enable the Band to accomplish its best work.

The first churchwardens were; C. R. Blaxlard,

The Rev D. M. SincWr remained as Vicar until 1883
when lie was succeeded by the Rev (afterwards Canon)
W. J. Hugill, who retired in 19( 6. The Rev E. 11. Stam-
mer was then inducted, remaining* until 1916. Rev A. R.
Pcgler, who succeeded Mr Stammer, remained only a
year when the Rev F. cle P. St. John was appointed.
St John's Church was dedicated on 14th October 1888
by James F. Turner, Bishop of Armidale. The ereefon
of the Church at this time was made possible through
the gift of £lOOO from the late George Western.
The Parish of Uralla embraces Bendemcor on t':e

and Mihi on the east. Churches have bean erected at
Bendemcor {St Stephen’s), Brushgrove (St. Matthew’s),

ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
ST. JOSEPH’S CHURCH
The Parish of Uralla was c , tituted in 1912, and on
16th June of the same year the Rev P. J. McGrath we-
inducted as Parish Priest. On the same clay the founda-
tion stones of the Presbytery and the new School wen;
laid, and upon the completion of the Presbytery Father
McGrath took up his residence here.
Dean Lynch, assisted by Father McCarthy, adminis-
tered the spiritual needs <»f the sir. all congregation i;
the early days of the town. ,mri following them, Fadwi
(now Bishop) O’Connor, For \vr\ many years BUhi p
O’Connor, as Dean O’Conmn, supervised the rapid!} u
creasing flock, to be followed by Dean O’Neil and Bean
(now Monsignor) Tobin. Bishop O’Connor has ever k>
tained a warm spot in his heart for Uralla. Upon his
elevation as Bishop of the Armidale Diocese in 1903, he
still continued to exercise a kindly interest in the spir-
itual needs of the congregation here, and took the
first opportunity of creating the Paris of Uralla aril
appointing Father McGrath as Parish Priest.
The signal success of His Lordship’s appeal for funds
on that day was only another instance of the love and
fealty of his people —a spirit that has so often been dis-
played since his elevation as their loved Bishop, whose
lofty ideals of Christian Charily have made him one of
the most popular prelates in Australia.
Ihe Convent and School is an establishment cf the
Sisters of St Joseph, of whem tlieic are five at the pre-
sent lime, and it U worthy of note that they have I ad
some notable simccsms in the scholastic field. The curri-
culum includes 1 m-imas Irainhig, Km if. and several oth-
er of the arts.
A red-letter day in the history of the Parish was
the occasion of the visit of , His Eminence Cardinal
Moran, which occurred subsequent to the consecration of
Bishop O'Connor at Armidale. His Eminence was accom-
panied by a distinguished company of pielates. A
few years since, following the opening of the Armidale
Orphanage, Archbishop Kelly, Archbishop Mannix, Arch-
bishop Duhig, and several Bishops also visited the Par-
ish, and were royally entertained.


PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
8. DAVID’S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
The Uralla Church was for a period cf sixty seven
years included in the Armidale Charge. The latter at
the time of its formation extended from Murrurundi to
the Queensland border and the first Minister appointed
to this wide parish was the Rev John Morrison, from
the Established Church of Scotland, who after a min’s-
try of two years removed to Walcha. He was succeeded
by the Rev Andrew Maxwell from the Free Church of
Scotland, who at the end of three years accepted &
Charge in Victoria.
Then came in 1807 thp man so eminently fitted for
the District, Ike Rev Thomas Johnstone (afterwards D.
D.) At ihe lime of his arrival from Scotland and ap-
pointment by the Presbyterians of Maitland there was
not-a Presbyterian Church in either, Armidale or Uralla.
but in less than two years, Churches were built in both
places. Dr Johnstone held a service on Sabbath - after-
noons at the Rocky in the first instance and later at
Uralla, and it is interesting to note that the Bible still
in use on the pulpit in the Uralla Church was given by
Alexander J. Kyle, late of Londonerry, in February 1855.
After a faithful and arduous ministry extending over
ihe long period of forty three years, Dr Johnstone re-
tired in 1905. His striking personality is well remember-,
cd and his name highly honoured throughout the Armi-
clale District for his work’s sake.
The Rev H. S. Buntine, the present Minister of Ar-
midale, has likewise taken a deep interest in the Uralla
portion of his "Charge, and when the Presbyterians bi
Uralla, Kingstown, and district felt they were in a posi-
tion to form a new Charge, Mr. Buntine and his Se:sioif
heartily supported the movement.
In 1918 the New England Presbytery gave permission
to have the Uralla Charge -formed and the Petifonws
were congratulated upon their zeal. Mr Buntine wa •; ap-
pointed Interim Moderator and steps were imrrcd’a'.eiy
taken to call a Minister. On the 17th of October 1918.
the Rev George Ccwio, of Gloucester, was inducted as
first Minister of Uralla. Ihe first elders consisted of
Messrs W. O. Murray, J. Haines, H. P. Mitchell, -U 1..
Mitchell and H. Cameron, while the folk wing cor s.i lut-
ed the first Committee of Management: Messrs W. \\\
A. Cameron, D. * Reeves, McDonald, Mclntosh,
Swales, Jas Weed, and J. McLennan, with the members
of Session.
The Rev. George Cow’e demitted his Charge in 1921
and the Rev W. Powell, the present Minister, was induc-
ted on 4th May in the came yea’".
The present Elders are Messrs H. F. Mitchell (Ses ;
sicn Clerk), W. O'. Murray, W. Low, and J. H. McAl-
pine.
Of the original Members, Messrs. H. Cameron and
J. L. Mitchell have been called of God to ‘higher ser-
vice.’ Mr J. Haines resigned on account of removal from
the Parish.
The following is the present Committee of Manage*
ment: Messrs J. Swales, J. Wood, J. Warwick, A. L.
Munro. il. Bower, K. McMillan, W. Low, A. Cameron,
G. M. Edwards, L. B. Bartlett, A. Wine's, J. D. McLen-
nan, !I . Macpherson, and L. Jamieson.
The year 1924 is reported as showing a steady ad-
vance in the Spiritual and temporal position of the
Parish.


METHODIST CHURCH.
METHODIST CHURCH
The first Church, then called the Weselyan Church,
was built in the main street, about opposite The V:car
age. Before the building of a Church, services were con-
ducted in Mr James McCrcssin’s hon e in Queen Stieet.
and Mr John McCressin's home in the main Street .
From the point of view of the Church, Uralla had
in 1891 grown to such importance that at the July quar-
terly meeting held in Armidale it was decided to croppy
a Circuit Missionary, who was to reside here.
An extract from the Plan (the late Rev W. H.
Beale being Superintendent) should be of interest. It
reads:—ln resolving to engage a Circuit Missionary for
Uralla the Circuit is.committed to an cnlerpr se wlrch.
l esides being important in itself, is especially interesting
as an experiment, upon the success cf which may de-
pend -further movements in the same d'roction which
have for some time been in the minds cf many inter si-
t'd in the extension and consolidation of cur Church in
the New England district.
The first Circuit Missionary engaged was Mr Rais
beck, who was in 1892 succeeded by Mr W. S. Smith.
Mr Smith laboured here for about ore year. Then not un-
til 1903 was the Armidale Circuit in a financial position
that again warranted the engagement of a Circuit Mis-
sionary for Uralla. Mr Ssdgewick Oliver received the
appointment.
Armidale Circuit was divided and Uralla, with adjac
cut places, was constituted a separate Circuit in 1905.
Hie Rev J. A. Thomas was the first Supeiintend
ent Minister, and Messrs J. Harris and W. Bendrey, the
first Circuit Stewards. There were two local preachers
(Messrs J. D. Leece and J. Yeomans) and ten preach-
ing places on the plan.
During the term of the Rev Thomas the present
Parsonage was purchased.
In 1907 the Rev H. C. Foreman, 8.A., was appoint-
ed to the Circuit. The Plan then showed fifteen preach-
ing places, and Mr A. Crapp (new Rev A. Crapp, of
Dungog) was appointed as a Circuit assistant.
The present Church building was erected during Rev
Foreman's term. The official opening took place on
Wednesday, ISth October 19(9. The ceremony was per-
formed by Mrs J. T. Crapp and Mrs Davidson at 3.30.
p.m., was followed by a tea-meeting and then at 7.3 C
p.m. by public worship conducted by the late Rev J.
W. Holden (Chairman of Armidale District), the preach-
er for the occasion being Rev P. J. Stephens.
The following appointments have since been made:
Rev A. H. Johnstone, 1911-14; Rev J. W. Dains, 1911-16
(the latter having been accepted as Chaplain to the
Military forces, the Rev S. W. McKibbin took charge of
the Circuit for several months); Rev P. L. Blapk, 19'-3
20; Rev A. J. Cutler, 1920-23; Rev W. Epwcrth Barker,
1923.
An account of the operations of the Church hero
would not be complete without reference to the work of
the late J. D. Leece, whose memory is treasured by
many of the members of to-day. An extract from a
Flap of Services of 1886 will remind many of the ser-
vices he rendered:- ‘A movement has been on foot for a
few months to make some recognition of the long and
valuable services of Mr J. D. Leece as local preacher.
Sunday-School Superintendent, and honorary curate of
the Ural la end of the Circuit, and chiefly through the en-
ergy of Messrs D. Davidson and W. Henderson the mat-
ter was brought to a successful issue. On New Year's
Day, in the presence of ovm 200 friends, the Rev J. E.
Carruthers had the pleasure, at the request of the don-
ors, of presenting Mr Leece with a new wagonette bug-

Commenced in 1860 by the late Mr Ogilvie the up-to-date premises here illustrated, and
known as THE NEW ENGLAND STORES have for upwards of 60 years housed many of
tiie prominent men in the Comnterc’al Zone of the North,
The original building, which is a’so shown, was completed and opened as a general store
by the late Mr Fremlin about the year 1862.
The business was carried on by various owners, who, from time ta time, effected i in-
provements to the building until in 1920 a> company was formed of local shareholders to
purchase the business, then being conducted by Wm. Moss & Co. The whole prcmi.es
were remoddelfed and the building extended along Bridge Street, the result being a com-’
modious, Well Lighted, Well Appointed Store, in every respect Up-to-date,
The present board of directors consists of such well known men as Messrs M, Hayne, T,
M. Heagney, J. Grattan, W. Carion (Cha : r), J. H. Carlon, and W. L Elliott (Manager),
whose object is to give the Public a fair deal by providing them with the necessaries of
life at reasonable prices accompanied by courteous and prompt service
In accordance with the Firm’s Motto of ‘Support Your Own Town’ it is interesting to
note that every member of the Staff forms a connecting link with the old pioneer famil-
ies of Uralla and district
‘Uralia Backers’ support the Store built by Uralla Workmen, owned by Uralla residents
and staffed by Uralla hands.


F. W. VINCENT, who founded The Times.
THE UR ALL A TIMES was first published on 15th April
1876. It was founded by the late F. W. Vincent for
Vincent Bros., but shortly afterwards was taken over
by Mr F. W. Vincent, who carried it on until his
death in February 1902, when his wodow, Mrs S. J.
Vincent, assumed the role of proprietress, and Mr Arth-
ur E. Vincent, a brother of the founder, was appointed
editor. The latter’s death occurred in 1912, when the
present proprietor, H. W. Vincent, assumed control.
The late Mr F. W. Vincent was a man of versatile ac-
complishments. He wielded a facile pen, and under his
regime The Times bore very high literary merit, as well
as catering- for the needs of the town and district in
a progressive and liberal spirit. Mr and Mrs Vincznt’s
Im-ge family induced six sons, the eldest of whom t ied
at the age of 10 years. The' other boys were all trained
‘at the case’ in the office, and as they grew to man’s
estate they moved out to open up fresh fields for them
labors. Frank W. established the Bundarra ‘Advcca + e’
and some years later The Eangalow Herald; H. W. Vi i-
ec nt put in a plant at Guyra in opposition to The Ar-
gus, and afterwards removed the plant to Tingha. whe:o
The Miner was established, later being sold; E. Lloyd
Vincent established The Kyogle Examiner twenty years
ago. and is still there; and Reg. H. Vincent established
rhe Don Dorrigo Gazette fourteen years ago. He was
later joined in partnership by the youngest son, Roy S.
Vincent. The latter served with the A.I.F. in France,
and a year or so after his return to Dorrigo was elected
to the State Parliament as one of the members for
the electorate of Oxley. Frank Vincent some years ago
acquired the Boggabri "Examiner, which has been earned
on by his widow since his death in 1923.

as a daily, which passed out of the family’s hands after
the death of the founder. Henry C. St Vincent, his
eldest son, established the Glen Innes Examiner, and two
of his sons also established newspapers, notably The
Manilla Express; while Arthur E. Vincent, a brother,
established The Moree Examiner,

URALLA ELECTRIC LIGHT AND RADIO SUPPLY
This business was started in the shop shown in the lop
corner in 1891 and was a continuation of the business oi
M. and E. Scanlon, later carried on by Mr J ■ F. O’Con-
nor, now of Inverell.
This shop was situated in Hill Street on the site now
occupied by Buncombe’s Butcher Shop next to the Post
Office.
The original business dates back to about the year 1875
when Hill Street was unformed and little better than a
scrub. Business was transformed for a time to Bridge
Street, and eventually to the present establishment
shown in the lower corner in the year 19C0.
As the district became more progressive machineiy was
added until a complete modern plant was installed to
allow the whole of the building trade to be catered for.
Joinery and furniture are now turned out, from the
cutting of the pine logs to the finished article, and at
prices equal to the best procurable.
The aim of the proprietor has always been to cut out the
middleman and supply direct to the user.
The latest addition to the plant is the electric installa-
tion which furnishes power and light for the town, and
which is considered the greatest boon that has been of-
fered to the townspepole. Current for all purposes is
supplied at a price Idwer than any town witli the same
population in the Commonwealth where current is gener-
ated by mechanical means.
Prices quoted for all building supplies, andjdans and es-
timates prepared.

THE ORIGINAL BUILDING.
The Royal Hotel, Uralla.
J. G. COOPER, Proprietor.
The Royal Hotel is intimately associated with the history of Uralla right
from the early days of the Town. The original premises were used by
James Tanko as a butchery, and the premises were first opened as a hot-
el by John Ryan, who was succeeded by John Carroll, who foremrly kept
a hotel on the Rocky Diggings. Patrick Griffin succeeded John Carroll as
licensee and remained in possession of the hotel until his death. The pre-
sent proprietor took over as licensee several years ago, and has made
the Royal a real home from Home. Everything in connection with the
hotel is clean and comfortable, and you’re made feel the homely influence
about the place immediately upon your entrance. Back-to-Uralla Visitors
and, in fact, all visitors to the Town at any time, should call on The
Royal.

The Firm, as at present, is the original partnership between Messrs A. L. and R. J. Munro. They have built
up the present Up-to-date Garage and Engineering business from a small business, in a different portion of the
town, as a commencement twenty years ago, and the Imperial is the oldest established Garage under one
name locally.
They have long been recognised as particularly capable Shearing Machinery Engineers, this work being most
important in a wool-growing district, and the majority of the big plants in the district were put in by Mr
John Munro (the father) or Munro Bros.
The Garage has a particularly well-equipped Workshop, and almost every convenience for clients, and the
Travelling Public. Two Agencies which have been exclusively handled by theb for a number of years.
STUDEBAKER and CHEVROLET, are still their best sellers; and they have now added the All-British MOR-
RIS OXFORD and MORRIS COWLEY CARS and TRUCKS to their agenc'es.
Among other activities, the firm hold a two-third interest in and manage the local PICTURE THEATRE.

THE AVERAGE RETURN
your flock gives is a factor in the amount of money it
earns. That fact is beyond dispute. But the price at
which your clip sells is also a decided influence. If ii
make s indifferent figures your year’s income suffers.
But the grower who sees that his business is carried
through to a successful finish gains every possible ad-
vantage which the season and selling conditions offer.
Clear evidence of that statement is provided by the
popularity of Winchcombe Carson Ltd. as wool salesmen
The firm’s name stands high in sheepmen's favor be-
cause clients’ returns conclusively prove that top values
are constantly obtained.
The goodwill Winchcombe Carson enjoy among growers
rests on the sound foundation of solid, capable work.

HELPING URALLA DISTRICT
TO GAIN PROSPERITY.
Since the introduction of power farming, Cooper Machinery
lias played a leading part in the development of Uralla’s prin-
cipal industries. Many old settlers will confirm our claim
that Cooper Machinery in the earlier days had an unrivalled
reputation for genuineness of construction, and practical effi-
ciency .
Year by year since those earlier days the Cooper Organisa-
tion has constantly endeavoured to improve its Shearing Ma-
chinery, Engines, Pumpers, Chaffcutters, Sawbenches Orchard
Sprayers, etc., striving to bring them as near to perfection
as it is possible to have them, so that they might give their
owners a standard of service that would remain as a con-
crete testimony to the faithfulness of Cooper manufacturing.
And so to-day we are able to point to the inevitable result
of this policy.
Look where you will in any district in the Commonwealth,
you will find its Cooper Machinery working steadily under all
conditions, shearing sheep, pumping water, cutting chaff,
sawing wood, jetting for the sheep fly, spraying in the best
fruit orchards of the country, but always giving the same re-
liable, trouble-free service
Public confidence in Cooper products is apparent everywhere
you look. Surely there are reasons why!
