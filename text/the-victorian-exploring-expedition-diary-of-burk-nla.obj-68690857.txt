VICTORIAN
EXPLORING EXPEDITION.
Despatches were received in Melbourne late on
Saturday, 2nd Nov., from Mr Howitt, the leader of
the Victorian Contingent Exploration Party, con-
taining the disastrous intelligence that after suc-
cessfully crossing the Australian continent,
Messrs Burke and Wills had died of starvation in
the neighborhood of Cooper?s Creek, and Gray a
short time before Cooper?s Creek was reached,
King being the only member of the party who
survived, and who was rescued by the contingent
party.
MR. HOWITT?S DISPATCH.
Poria Creek, Oct. 10, 1861,
Sir, ?I have the honor to report my arrival here
with the Contingent Exploring Party, cn my re-
turn journey, having on September 15, in lat. 27
deg. 44 min., and long. 140 deg. 40 min., found
John King, the only survivor of Mr Burke?s
party, living with the Cooper?s Creek natives.
Mr Burke and Mr Wills had died some time pre-
vious to my arrival, from hunger and ex-
haustion, and Gray died before reach-
ing Cooper?s Creek, on their return jour-
ney from the Gulf. King was in a very
weak, exhausted state when found, but, I am
happy to say, has recovered wonderfully since,
and Mr Wheeler has just reported him to me as
being out of his hands. The full particulars will
be found in my diary, which, with King?s narra-
tive, is enclosed. I may state regarding my diary,
that I have only transcribed that portion sub-
sequent to our reaching this place on our out-
ward journey, as up to that time we had
followed the Expedition track, and nothing
of interest had occurred. It may suffice for me
to state that from leaving Menindie we had tra-
velled without meeting with any particular
hindrances, finding splendid feed almost the
whole way, and sufficient water for our use, with
the exception of three, nights, when our horses
were without. The rain had been very partial,
and in places we only found sufficient for our im-
mediate use. Torowoto and Carriapundy swamps
and the mud plains were perfectly dry, and no
water that could long be relied on, without subse-
quent rain, from Nuntherunga back to this place,
a distance of about 180 miles. I had intended
leaving the Expedition track at Carriapundy, but
was deterred from doing so by the very dry appear-
ance of the country ; and, therefore, followed the
track to this creek, which is permanent. I am
happy to be able to state, that the party are and
have been in perfect health, and that the horses
are in excellent working order. The camels are
on the whole, in as good condition as when they
eft Menindie, and may be pronounced cured of
the scab, which I cannot help attributing in a
great measure to the bid management of the
sepoys. So far I have met with no loss or acci-
dent of any kind, and the natives, wherever I
have seen them have been friendly. I expect to
be down at Menindie in three weeks, and may
probably spend two or three days at Torowoto to
endeavor to find permanent water, as I know of
none there that can be relied on. I forward these
despatches by Mr Brahe and Weston Phillips,
with four of our best horses. I consider that
they will have no particular difficulties in going
down, excepting as regards water, which would
not be lessened by a larger party, and I cannot
well spare more men, from the number of
camels and pack-horses to look after. Should
there be horses at Menindie fit for the journey
down, I have instiucted Mr Brahe to proceed at
once to town, taking with him the documents and
field books belonging to Mr Burke and Mr Wills,
and relating to the journey to and from the Gulf.
King I shall send down on my arrival at the
Darling.
I beg to urge on the committee the necessity
of sending me immediate instructions to Menindie
respecting the further disposal of the party and
equipment. I have the honor to be, Sir, your
most obedient servant,
A. W. Howitt,
Leader of the Contingent Exploring Party.
To ths Hon. John Macadam, M.D., Hon. Secre-
tary the Exploration Committee, Melbourne.
JOHN KING?S NARRATIVE.
Mr Burke, Mr Wills and I, reached the depot
at Cooper?s Creek, on April 21st, about half-
past seven in the evening, with two camels?
all that remained of the six Mr Burke took
with him. All the provisions we then had con-
sisted of a pound and a half of dried meat. We
found the party had gone the same day, and look-
ing about for any mark they might have left, found
the tree with DIG, April 21. Mr Wills said the
party had left for the Darling. We dug, and
found the plant of stores. Mr Burke took the
papers out of the bottle, and then asked each of
us whether we were able to proceed up the
creek in pursuit of the party ? we said not, and
he then said that he thought it his duty to ask
us, but that he himself was unable to do so,
but that he had decided upon trying to make
Mount Hopeless, as he had been assured by the
committee in Melbourne, that there was a cattle
station within 150 miles of Cooper?s Creek. Mr
Wills was not inclined to follow this plan, but
wished to go down our old track, but at last gave


in to Mr Burke?s wishes; I also wished to go planted?two-and-a-half pounds of oatmeal, a
down by our old track. We remained four or small quantity of flour, and the dried meat?
five days to recruit, and make preparations to go
down the creek by stages of four to five miles a
day, and Mr Burke placed a paper in the plant,
stating what were our plans. Travelling down
the creek, we got some fish from the natives, and,
some distance down, one of the camels (Landa)
got bogged, and although we remained there that
day and part of the next trying to dig him out,
we found our strength insufficient to do so.
The evening of the second day we shot him as he
lay, and having cut off as much meat as we could,
we lived on it while we stayed to dry the re-
mainder. Throwing all the least necessary things
away, we made one load for the remaining camel
(Rajah), and each of us carried a swag of
".bout 251b. We were then tracing down the
Branches of the creek running S., but found
that they ran out into earthy plains. We had
understood that the creek along Gregory?s track
was continuous; and finding that all these creeks
ran out into plains, Mr Burke returned, our camel
being completely knocked up. We then intended
to give the camel a spell for a few days, and to make
a new attempt to push on forty or fifty miles to the
south, in the hope of striking the creek. During
the time that the camel was being rested, Mr
Burxe and Mr Wills went in search of the natives,
to endeavor to find out how the nardoo grew.
Having found their camp, they obtained as much
nardoo cake and fish as they could eat, but could
not explain that they wished to be shown how to
find the seed themselves. They returned on the
third day, bringing some fish and nardoo cake
with them. On the following day the camel Rajah
seemed very ill, and I told Mr Burke I thought
he could not linger out more than four days ; and
as on the same evening the poor brute was on the
point of dying, Mr Burke ordered him to be
shot. I did so, and we cut him up with
two broken knives and a lancet. We cured
the meat and planted it ; and Mr Burke
then made another attempt to find the
nardoo, taking me with him. We went down the
creek, expecting to find the natives at the camp
where they had been last seen, but found that
they had left; and not knowing whether they had
gone up or down the creek, we slept in their
gunyahs that night, and on the following morning
returned to Mr Wills. The next day Mr Burke
and I started up the creek, but could see nothing of
them, and were three days away when we re-
turned, and remained three days in our camp with
Mr Wills. We then made a plant of all the arti-
cles we could not carry with us, leaving 5 lb of
rice and a quantity of meat, and then followed up
the creek, where there were some good native
huts. We remained at that place a few days,
and finding our provisions were beginning to run
short, Mr Burke said, that we ought to do some-
thing, and that if we did not find the nardoo we
should starve, and that he intended to save a
little dried meat and rice to carry us to Mount
Hopeless. The three of us then came to the con-
clusion that it would be better to make a second
attempt to reach Mount Hopeless, as we were
then as strong as we were likely to be, our daily
allowance being then reduced. Mr Burke asked
each of us whether we were willing to make ano-
ther attempt to reach the South Australian settle-
ments, and we decided' on going. We took with
ua what remained of the provisions we had
this, with powder and shot, and other small arti-
cles, made up our swags to 30 lb each, and Mr
Burke carried one billy of water, and I another.
We had not gone far before we came on a flat,
where I saw a plant growing which I took to be
clover, and, on looking closer, saw the seed, and
called out that I had found the nardoo. They
were very glad when I found it. We travelled
three days, and struck a water course coming
south from Cooper?s Greek. We traced this, as it
branched out and re-formed on the plains, until we
at last lost it in flat country. Sandhills were in
front of us, for which we made, and travelled all
day, but found no water. We were all greatly
fatigued, as our rations now consisted of only one
small johnny cake and three sticks of dried meat
daily. We camped that evening about four
o?clock, intending to push next day until two
o?clock, p.m., and then should we not find water,
to return. We travelled, and found no water,
and the three of us sat down and rested for an
hour, and then turned back. We all felt satisfied
that, had there been a few days? rain, we could
have got through. We were then, according to
Mr Wills?s calculation, forty-five miles from the
creek. We travelled on the day we turned back
very late, and the following evening reached the
nearest water at the creek. We gathered some
nardoo, and boiled the seeds, as we were unable
to pound them. The following day we reached
the main creek ; and knowing where there was a
fine water-hole and native gunyahs, we went
there, intending to save what remained of our
flour and dried meat, for the purpose of making
another attempt to reach Mount Hopeless. On
the following day, Mr Wills and I went out to
gather nardoo, of which we obtained a supply suf-
ficient for three days; and finding a pounding-
stone at the gunyahs, Mr Wills and I pounded
the seed, which was such slow work that we were
compelled to use half flour and half nardoo. Mr
Burke and Mr Wills then went down the creek
for the remainder of the dried meat which we had
planted, and we had now all our things with us,
gathering nardoo, and living the best way we
could. Mr Burke requested Mr Wills to go up
the creek as far as the depdt, and to place a note
in the plant there, stating that we were then
living on the creek, the former note having stated
that we were on our road to South Australia. He
was also to bury there the field-books of the
journey to the Gulf. Before starting he got 31b.
of flour and 31b. of pounded nardoo, and about a
pound of meat, as he expected to be absent about
eight days. During his absence I gathered nardoo
and pounded it, as Mr Burke wished to lay in a
supply in case of rain.
A few days after Mr Wills left some natives
came down to the creek to fish at some water-
holes near our camp. They were civil to us at
first, and offered us some fish ; on the second day
they came again to fish, and Mr Burke took down
two bags, which they filled for him; on the third
they gave us one bag of fish, and afterwards all
came to our camp. We used to keep our ammuni-
tion and other articles in one gunyah,
and all three of us lived together in another.
One of the natives took an oilcloth out of this
gunyah, and Mr Burke seeing him run away with
it, followed him with his revolver and fired over
his head, and upon this the native dropped the


oilcloth. While he was away the other blacks all three of us. I continued to do this for a few
invited me away to a waterhole to eat fish ; but I
declined to do so, as Mr Burke was away, and a
number of natives were about who would have
taken all our things. When I refused, one took
his boomerang and laid it over my shoulder, and
then told me by signs that if I called out for Mr
Burke, as I was doing, that he would strike me.
Upon this I got them all in front of the gunyah
and fired a revolver over their heads, but they did
not seem at all afraid, until I got out the gun,
when they all ran away. Mr Burke, hearing the
report, came back, and we saw no more of them
until lata that night, when they came with some
cooked fish and called out ? white fellow.? Mr
Burxe then went out with his revolver, and found
a whole tribe coming down, all painted, and with
fish in small nets carried by two men.
Mr Burke went to meet them, and they
wished to surround him, but he knocked
as many of the nets of fish out of their
hands as he could, and shouted out to me to fire.
I did so, and they ran off. We collected five
small nets of cooked fish. The reason he would
not accept the fish from them was,, that he was
afraid of being too friendly lest they should be
always at our camp. We then lived on fish until
Mr Wills returned. He told us that he had met
the natives soon after leaving us, and that they
were very kind to him and had given him plenty
to eat both on going up and returning. He
seemed to consider that he should have very
little difficulty in living with him, and as our
camp was close to theirs he returned to them the
same day and found them very hospitable and
friendly, keeping him with them two days. They
then made signs to him to be off. He came to us
and narrated what had happened, but went back
to them the following day, when they gave him
his breakfast, but made signs to him to go away.
He pretended not to understand them, and
would not go, upon which they made signs that
they were going up the creek, and that he had
better go down. They packed up and left the
camp, giving Mr Wills a little nardoo to take to
us.
During his absence, while Mr Eurke was cook-
ing some fish, during a strong wind, the flames
caught the gunyah, and burned so rapidly that
we were unable, not only to put it out, but to save
any of our things, excepting one revolver and a
gun. Mr Wills being returned, it was decided to
go up the creek and live with the natives, if pos-
sible, as Mr Wills thought we should have but
little difficulty in 'obtaining provisions from them
if we camped on the opposite side of the creek to
them. He said he knew where they were gone,
so we packed up and started. Coming to the gun-
yahs where we expected to have found them, we
we were disappointed, and seeing a nardoo field
close by, halted, intending to make it our camp.
Tor some time we were employed gathering nar-
doo, and laying up a supply. Mr Wills and I
used to collect and carry home a bag each day,
and Mr Burke generally pounded sufficient for
our dinner during our absence, but Mr Wills
found himself getting very weak, and was shortly
unable to go out and gather nardoo as before, nor
even strong enough to pound it, so that in a few
days he became almost helpless. I still continued
gathering ; and Mr Burke now also began to feel
very weak, and said he could be of very lit le use
in pounding. I had now to gather and pound for
days, but finding my strength rapidly failing, my
legs being very weak and painful, I was unable to
go out for several days, and we were compelled to
consume six days? stock, which we hadlaid by. Mr
Burke now proposed that I should gather as much
as possible in three days, ana that with this supply
we should go in search of the natives?a plan
which had been urged upon us by Mr Wills as
the only chance of saving him and ourselves as
well, as he clearly saw that I was no longer able
to collect sufficient for our wants. Having col-
lected the seed, as proposed, and hav-
ing pounded sufficient to last Mr Wills
for eight days, and two days for ourselves, we
placed water and firewood within his reach,
and started. Before leaving him, however, Mr
Burke asked him whether he still wished it, as
under no other circumstances would he leave
him ; and Mr Wills again said that he looked on
it as our only chance. He then gave Mr Burke
a letter and his watch for his father, and we
buried the remainder of his field books near the
gunyah. Mr Wills said that, in case of my sur-
viving Mr Burke, he hoped that I would carry
out his last wishes in giving the watch and letter
to his father.
In travelling the first day, Mr Burke seemed
very weak, and complained of great pain in his
legs and back. On the second day he seemed
to be better, and said that he thought he was
getting stronger, but, on starting, did not go two
miles before he said he could go no further. I
persisted in his trying to go on, and managed to
get him along several times, until I saw that he
was almost knocked up, when he said he could
not carry his swag, and threw all he had away.
I also reduced mine, taking nothing but a gun and
some powder and shot, and a small pouch and
some matches. On starting again, we did not go
far before Mr Burke said he should halt for the
n?ght, but as the place was close to a large sheet
of water, and exposed to the wind, I prevailed on
him to go a little further, to the next reach of
water, where we camped. We searched about,
and found a few small patches of nardoo, which
I collected and pounded, and, with a crow which
I shot, made a good evening?s meal. Prom the
time we halted Mr Burke seemed to be getting
worse, although he ate his supper. He said he
felt convinced he could not last many hours, and
gave me his watch, which he said belonged to the
committee, and a pocketbook to give to Sir
William Stawell, and in which he wrote some
notes. *He then said to me, ?I hope
you will remain with me here till I
am quite dead?-it is a comfort to know
that some one is by; but when lam dying, it is
my wish that you should place the pistol in my
right hand, and that you leave me unburied as I
lie.? That night he spoke very little, and the
following morning I found him speechless, or
nearly so ; and about eight o?clock he expired. I
remained a few hours there, but as I saw there
was no use in remaining longer, I went up the
creek in search of the natives. I felt very lonely,
and at night usually slept in deserted wurleys,
belonging to the natives. Two days after leaving
the spot where Mr Burke died, I found some
gunyahs, where the natives had deposited a bag
of nardoo, sufficient to last me a fortnight, and
three bundles containing various articles. I also
shot a crow that evening, but was in very great


dread that the natives would come and deprive themselves, and supplied me with fish andnardoo
me of the nardoo. regularly. They were very anxious, however, to
I remained there two days to recover my
strength, and then returned to Mr Wills. I took
back three crows ; but found him lying dead in
his gunyah, and the natives had been there and
had taken away some of his clothes. I buried
the corpse with sand, and remained there some
days. But finding that my stock of nardoo was
running short, and being unable to gather it,
I tracked the natives who had been to the camp,
by their footprints in the sand; and, when some
distance down the creek, shooting crows and
hawks on the road, the natives, hearing the re-
port - of the gun, came to meet me, and
took me with them to their camp, giving
me nardoo and fish. They took the birds I
had shot and cooked them for me, and after-
wards showed me a gunyah, where I was to
sleep with three of the single men. The
following morning they commenced talking
to me, and putting one finger on the
ground, and covering it with sand,
at the same time pointing up the creek, saying
? Whitefellow,? which I understood to mean
that one white man was dead. From this, I
thought they were the tribe who had taken Mr
Wills? clothes. They then asked me where the
third man was, and I also made the sign of put-
ting the fingers on the ground, and covering them
with sand, at the same time pointing up the
creek. They appeared to feel great compassion
for me when they understood that I was alone on
the creek, and gave me plenty to eat. After being
four days with them, I saw that they were be-
coming tired of me, and they made signs that they
were going up the creek, and that I had better go
downwards ; but I pretended not to understand
them. The same day they shifted camp, and I
followed them; and, on reaching their camp,
I shot some crows, which pleased them so
much that they made me a breakwind in the
centre of their camp, and came and sat round
me until such time as the crows were cooked,
when they assisted me to eat them. The same
day, one of the women, to whom I had given part
of a crow, came and gave me a ball of nardoo,
saying that she would give me more only (she
had such a sore arm that she was unable to
pou d. She showed me a sore on her arm, and
the thought struck me that I would boil some
water in the billy and wash her arm with a
sponge. During the operation the whole tribe
sat round, and were muttering one to another.
Her husband sat down by her side, and she was
crying all the time. After I had washed it, I
touched it with some nitrate of silver, when she
began to yell and ran off, crying, ? Mokow!
mokow!? (fire! fire!) From this time, she
and her husband used to give me a small quan-
tity of nardoo both night and morning, and
whenever the tribe was about going on a fishing
excursion, he used to give me notice to go with
them. They also used to assist me in making a
wurley, or breakwind, whenever they shifted
camp. I generally shot a crow, or a hawk, and
gave it to them in return for these little services.
Every four or five days the tribe would surround
me and ask whether I intended going up or down
the creek; at last I made them understand that
if they went up I should go up the creek, and if
they went down I should also go down, and from
this time they seemed to look upon me as one of
know where Mr Burke lay, and one day when we
were fishing in the waterholes close by I took them
to the spot. On seeing his remains the whole
party wept bitterly, and covered them with
bushes. After this they were much kinder to
me than before, and I always told them that the
white men would be here before two moons, and
in the evenings, when they came with nardoo and
fish, they used to talk about the ? whitefellows?
coming, and the same time pointing to the moon.
I also told them they would receive many presents,
and they constantly asked me for tomahawks,
called by them ?bomay ho.? From this time to
when the relief party arrived, a period of about a
month, they treated me with uniform kindness,
and looked upon me as �ne of themselves. The
day on which I was released, one of the tribe who
had been fishing came and told me that the white-
fellows were coming, and the whole of the tribe,
who were then in camp, sallied out in every direc-
tion to meet the party, while the man who had
brought the news took me over the creek, where
I shortly saw the party coming down.
Brahe?s letter.
The following is the letter deposited by Mr
Brahe in the cache at Cooper?s Creek on the
21st of April when he left that for Menindie :
Depot, Cooper?s Creek, April 21st, 1861.
The depot party of Y.E.E. leaves this camp to-
day, to return to the Darling. I intend to go
S.E. from camp 60, to get into our old track near
Bulloo. Two of my companions and myself are
quite well; the third?Patton ?has been unable
to walk for the last eighteen days, as his leg has
been severely hurt when thrown by one of the
horses. No person has been up here from the
Darling.
We have six camels and twelve horses in good
working condition. William Brahe,
burxe?s last letter.
The following is the despatch of Mr Burke,
left at the Depot, at Cooper?s Creek :
Depot No. 2, Cooper?s Creek.
Camp No. 65.
The return party from Carpentaria, consisting
of myself, Mr Wills, and King (Gray dead), ar-
rived here last night and found that the depot
party had only started on the same day. We pro-
ceed on to-morrow slowly down the creek towards
Adelaide, by Mount Hopeless, and shall endeavor
to follow Gregory?s track, but we are very weak.
The two camels are done up, and we shall not be
able to travel farther than four or five miles a day.
Gray died on the road from exhaustion
and fatigue. We have all suffered much from
hunger. The provisions left here will, I think,
restore our strength. We have discovered a prac-
ticable r�ute to Carpentaria, the chief portion of
which lies on the 140 th meridian of east longi-
tude. There is some good country between this
and the stony desert. From there to the tropic
the country is dry and stony. Between the
tropic and 'Carpentaria a considerable portion is
rangy, but it is well watered and richly grassed.
We reached the shores of Carpentaria on the
11th February, 1861. Greatly disappointed at
finding the party here gone.

22nd April, 1861.
P.S. The camels cannot travel, and we cannot


walk, or we should follow the other party. We Camp 20, 2nd September.?Spelled here to-day

WILLS? LAST LETTER.
The following is Mr Wills? letter, which he
buried in the cache at Cooper?s Creek, after find-
ing it impossible to get through to South Aus-
tralia :
Depot Camp, 30th May.
We have been unable to leave the creek. Both
camels are dead, and our provisions are done.
Mr Burke and King are down the lower part of the
creek. lam about to return to them, when we
shall probably come up this way. We are trying
to live the best way we can, like the blacks, but
find it hard work. Our clothes are going to
pieces fast. Send provisions and clothes as soon
as possible. W. J. Wills.
The depdt party having left, contrary to instruc-
tions, has put us in this fix, I have deposited
some of my journals here, for fear of accidents.

Camp 20, Poria Creek, September Ist, lat. 28
deg. 44 min., long. 142 deg. 42 min.?The country,
after leaving camp 19 (Koorlegur), was generally
sandy ridges, running variously from N.E. round
to N.W. Between these sandy tracts, we passed
a good deal of clayey flat ground?in places hard
and smooth, in others spongy and rotten, and
cracked deeply by the heat, polygonum and cane-
grass growing in great quantities. The feed
everywhere poor and scanty, and very dry. I
believe that very little rain has fallen here this
season. After about ten miles, the sand ridges
became more marked, and of a red color, and the
flats wide, and draining to the N.E. Scattered
box-trees began to appear, and birds were more
numerous. At five miles more, struck Poria
Creek, a deep channel coming from a northerly
direction, and containing abundance of water ;
its general width appears to be about 60 feet, and
the banks are lined with small box-trees; water
plants and a species of water moss grow in the
bed, and from fish and crayfish being found in it,
I have no doubt that it is permanent?in fact, the
only water I can consider such of all these we
have seen on this side the Daubeny Ranges. At
a distance of about half a mile, the course of the
creek is followed by high redsand ridges, running
parallel to its course. There is no timber any-
where but on the creek, and only small bushes,
and one or two kinds of pittosporurn and mulgar
on the sand ridges. The country is very inferior
in every respect, but water as we proceed. Signal
fires in two places as we were travelling; both
very large, and no doubt intended to announce
our arrival. On some of the flats I observed
quantities of the plant growing from the seeds
of which the natives make their bread. It
appears to choose a loose blistered clayey
soil, subject to be flooded, such as is gene-
rally found in polygonum ground. The leaves
resemble clover, but with a silvery down, which
is also found on the seed when fresh ; these grow
on short stems springing from the roots, and are
flat and rather oval; in places where the plant
has died down, these seeds quite cover the
ground ; they are gathered by the native wo-
men, and, after being cleaned from the sand,
are pounded between two stones and baked as
cakes.
ing pack bags, dressing camels, baking four days?
bread, fee. Day warm; wind from S.E., which
seems to be the prevalent quarter. Flies begin to
be troublesome.
Camp 21, 3rd September, Lat. 28 deg. 22 min.,
Long. 142 deg. 31 min.?Started at eight o?clock,
and left the expedition track at Poria Creek.
Struck a course for Cooper?s Creek N.W. by com-
pass. For seven miles travelled over sand ridges
running N.E. and S.W., with wide clayey valleys
between, in which were occasional small pools of
muddy water. The feed everywhere very dry,
but tolerably plentiful on the sandhills. Bushes
and small mulgar trees were growing in places.
We here crossed a dry box swamp, where crows,
wood swallows, kites, and small birds were
numerous, and I observed here several trees with
a rough bark resembling cork, and with bunches of
long, pointed, dark green leaves growing at the
ends of the small branches. The sandhills here
became low and flat, and the valley wider.
Shortly afterwards crossed the track of a large
camel going N.E , apparently about eight months
ago. The country undulating and well grassed,
and, as far as I could make out, the watershed
both to the N.E. and S.W. At twelve o?clock,
after crossing a dry swamp full of watercourses,
and passing a low sandhill, came on a creek run-
ning S.W., thickly timbered with large box
trees, the bed wide and the banks steep, and in
several places large pools of clear water. Marsh-
mallows and other vegetation now perfectly dried
up were on the banks. Native camps were nu-
merous ; but none that I saw were very recent.
Mussel-shells and the claws of crayfish were
lying near them. I have every reason to believe
that some of these pools are permanent. Cross-
ing this we passed several branch creeks running
through a clayey plain, and all lined with trees ;
large pools of water in several. I named this
creek after the Hon. David Wilkie, M.D.,
M.L.C. On leaving the clay flats at the ereek
we again crossed sand hills and undulating
country for several miles, mostly well grassed
but much burned up. Saltbush and cottonbush
plentiful in the hollows, and scattered timber
beginning to appear. At half-past two came on
a watercourse running N., and containing large
but shallow pools of water. The feect round
about excellent, and enough timber to be called
a thin gum forest. The gums here a new species
not before seen by us, several feet of the butt
having a rough semipersistent bark, above which
it is smooth and greenish, with a red tint ; leaves
thick and glossy, very much resembling one grow-
ing near Omeo. Ducks here very tame. Camped,
having made eighteen miles, and country not
looking so well ahead. The general fall seems to
be to the westward. Samla, the largest of our
camels, lay down just before reaching the camp ;
he is the only one of the lot that has not im-
proved in condition, and he keeps himself poor
by constantly watching the other camels, and
driving them away from the females. He only
carries 2 cwt.
Camp 22, Stokes? Ranges, Sept. 4, lat. 28 deg.
20 min. Long. 142 deg. 19 min. Left camp at
half-past seven. Trrveiled for three miles
through open gum forest, growing �n clayey land.
Water channels frequent, with occasional small
pools of water. Saltbush and grass, but very dry.


Then crossed an open plain with claypans, the to camp, the camels and horses being very tired.
drainage of which running westward, forms nume-
rous small box creeks, which form and spread out
again on the plain. No w r ater here, only liquid
mud. At about five miles passed a small box
creek with pools of water, and came on an open
sandy plain destitute of vegetation, excepting the
remains of salsolaceous plants grown last season.
At ten o?clock crossed a large dry gum creek, full
of gravel and boulders, coming in an easterly
direction from the range. As it lay in our course,
we followed it up for some distance, but
found no water, although crows, rose
cockatoos, and crested pigeons were on it.
The country here became stony, but with
more dry grass, and gradually rose to the range ;
from this the travelling was very severe
upon the horses, and consequently very slow, as
the ground is everywhere covered with fragments
of sharp flint stones. The ranges are of no great
height, and slope gently upwards, but are cut by
numerous deep gorges, filled with blocks of stone
and scrub, and mostly containing a dry gum
creek, These lying across our track made it dffi-
cult to get on. The mulgar scrub was very thick
in places, a great deal of it dead, and numbers of
shrubs new to me. Campeed at 3.30 at the edge
of a deep scrubby gorge, with plenty of dry grass,
but no water. Went down the gorge after camp-
ing to look for water but found none, nor could I
see any chance from the loose gravelly bed and
large boulders. Scrub very thick ; among other,
the native orange, of large size, and covered
with unripe fruit. Distance, twenty miles.
Camp 23, north side of Stoke?s Ranges, sth
September, lat. 28 deg. 10 min., long, 42 deg. 8
min.?Had some difficulty in crossing the gully
this morning, the sides being steep and covered
with large blocks of stone ; thick mulgar scrub
up both sides. From here, travelled over similar
stony ridges to those described yesterday for
several hours, crossing two wide deep gorges,
each with a dry creek and large gums, and flanked
by precipitous stony ranges. On reaching the
summit of the range, found it to be a stony table
land, almost devoid of vegetation.. Some remark-
able flat-topped peaks to the N. about twelve
miles. At noon, suddenly came to the edge of a
bluff overlooking the Cooper?s Creek country ;
apparently a boundless extent of plains,
with dark lines of scrub or timber on the horizon.
To descend from this bluff to a wide basin of open
country below, probably seven to eight hundred
feet, occupied an hour, and I could only consider
it a happy chance that some of the packhorses or
camels met with no accident among the large
blocks of loose stone. I could not have believed
that the camels could have carried their loads up
or down such places as we have crossed to-day.
On reaching the basin found it stony to a degree
difficult to describe. The ground was literally
paved with angular and rounded frag-
ments of sandstone and flint, coated
with a shining oxide of iron. Vegeta-
tion very scanty and water nowhere visible,
although I saw birds which I have seldom seen
far from springs. Travelling for several miles
over this country, surrounded by a chain of
abrupt square hills, we slowly picked our road as
best we could. Several of the horses were very
footsore, and most of them fagged with the severe
day?s work and want of water. The day, too,
was unusually warm. At 3.30 found it necessary
No water, scarcely any feed.
After camp went to a square steep hill, with
Mr Brahe to reconnoitre the country. From it
had an extensive view towards Cooper?s Creek,
and was pleased to see that the stony country
does not probably extend more than four miles
from us. Beyond that open plains, and on the
horizon what seem to be sand hills and timber.
A large body of smoke to the west. I found the
summit of the hill to be covered with large masses
of a white crystalline stone, grouped in irregular
columns, and ringing with a metallic sound when
struck. It is the same stone as that universally
strewn over the country, and of which and a
coarse sandstone and conglomerate the ranges are
mostly formed. Managed to give the horses two
Quarts of water each, in the hope that they
would feed. They were so thirsty that two tried
to take the quart pots off the fire.
Camp 24, Sept. 6. Lat. 28 deg,, Long. 142 deg.
2 min.? Left camp shortly after six. The horses
had not fed during the night, partly from thirst,
partly being afraid of the stones. Followed down
a gully leading into very stony plains, which we
crossed for several hours, being obliged to lead
the horses very slowly. No timber and scarcely
any vegetation; the most desolate stony wilder-
ness imaginable. About ten o?clock came near
the sandhills, and the country improved as re-
garded travelling, but not for feed or water. On
a dry watercourse came on a party of natives, of
whom some ran away; the others, consisting
of an old grey-haired man, an old hag of a wo-
man, a younger :oian, and two or three lubras
and children, waited until I rode up. They were
in a very excited state, waving branches, and
jabbering incessantly. The younger man shook
all over with fright. Sandy could not under-
stand them, and I could only catch ? Gow? (Go
on). At last, by the offer of a knife, I prevailed
on the old man to come with us to show us the
nearest water, but after half a mile his courage
gave way, and he climbed up a box-tree to be out
of reach. Mr Brahe rode up to him, when he
climbed into the top branches, jabbering without
stopping for a moment. Finding that he would
not come down, and kept pointing to the N.W.
(our course), we left him. All the natives were
naked, and the old man was the only one who had
any covering for his head ?a net.
We here entered undulating sandy country,
slightly scrubbed and well grassed, and at the same
time came on Brahe?s down track. Our horses at
once struck into a better pace, going at least three
miles and a half an hour. The-camels also pushed
on well. The loose horses kept wide of the track,
looking out for water in the polygonum ground,
and at ten minutes past "welve one old stager
found an ample supply in a channel on the right
hand. The horses at once made a rush, and it
was almost impossible to prevent them drinking
as much as they wished. Three had for the last
hour shown unmistakeable signs of giving in,
and all were very much pinched with thirst.
Camped by -the water, in first rate feed. Rain
came* on steadily from N.E. shortly after, and has
1 continued. The horses have just been a third time
to water.
Camp 24, Sept. 7-?lt rained very heavily
during the night, with strong flusts of wind from
N.E., and this morning the flats and claypans
are swimming with water, and the ground very


soft. Resting to-day, as the horses require it. the S. of W., at about nine miles, we had a range

Camp 25, Cooper?s Creek, Sept. 8. Lat. 27 deg.
51 min., long. 141 deg. 45 min.?(Half amile above
camp sixty of Victorian Expedition.)? Travelled
N. 60 deg W., through a succession of sand hills,
with flats of rotten polygonum ground between.
The vegetation very green and in full flower, and
box-trees growing in most of the flats. Towards
noon, after crossing some high red sand hills,
came into the earthy plains through which the
various channels of Cooper?s Creek run to
the westward. The ground very rotten, and
cracked by numerous deep fissures ; dry channels
in every direction. About six miles brought us
to a patch of sand hills, where the bare loose
summits were crested with a pink flowering mesem-
brysanthunum ; the pink flower, with the orange-
colored sand, and the light green vegetation,
produced a very singular effect. We here sud-
denly came upon a native camp of four wurleys.
Only one blackfellow was at home, and the three
leading men of our procession came suddenly
upon him as he was lying on the ground playing
with his dog. He gave a succession of yells, and
then ran off as if electrified. Here we crossed
the first branch of Cooper?s Creek, a wide shallow
bed, full of green weeds and grass, and lined with
box. From this we crossed about three miles of
loose earthy plains devoid of vegetation, and
camped on the N. side of a large branch, near
a shallow sheet of water. No feed on the plains,
but grass and green weeds in the channel.
Large box trees on the bank. Distance travelled,
twenty four miles.
Camp 26, 9th September. Lat. 27 deg. 49 min.,
Long. 141 deg. 38 min.?While loading up this
morning five blackfellows made their appearance
on the opposite side of the creek, and, as usual,
commenced shouting and waving their arms. We
cooeyd in return, and one waded across, but waited
on the bank until I broke a branch and beckoned
him to come up. The others then followed him;
they were all fine well-built young men, with
open intelligent faces, and very different from the
natives usually met with. They wore nets
wrapped round their waists ; and one, apparently
the head man, had his front teeth knocked out.
Sandy said he could only understand ?narrangy
word? they said ; but I believe that he could
not understand them at all, as he was quite
unable to make them comprehend that I wished
to know if they had seen any stray camels
about the creek. Before we had finished load-
ing they returned to the opposite bank, and
sat down watching us. On our starting they
waded across to our camp?probably to pick up
anything left behind, which would be very little.
To-day we travelled over earthy plains for thir-
teen miles ; they were cracked in every direction,
and covered with a network of channels. In
times of flood the whole of them must be under
water, and I can scarcely imagine anything more
luxuriant than the appearance of these plains
after a wet season. At present everything is dry
and withered, but everywhere the stalks of marsh
mallows and other flowering plants are as high
as a horse?s back, and very closetogether. Tufts of
grass line each side, and cover the bed of the water-
courses. Here and there clumps and lines of tim-
ber mark the course of the larger creeks, and
sandhills rise like islands from the plains. To
main creek. No floods appear to have come down
for two seasons, and waterholes which were tole-
rably well filled five months ago are now dry, or
nearly so. At thirteen miles crossed a branch,
where Burke?s marked tree, LXI, stands, and
camped at a claypan under a sandhill, about a
mile to the W. Strong breeze from the N.E. and
N. all day, and steady rain at night. Near here,
I observed for the first time a new tree, with a
rough scaly bark and thick foliage, the leaves
small and oval, and set in pairs on a stem. The
tree grows to fifteen or twenty feet, and bears
numbers of flat brown pods, each containing from
five to six hard light brown beans, known,by us
as the bean tree.
Camp 27, September 10. Lat. 27 deg. 39 min.,
long. 141 deg. 30 min.?The rain ceased shortly
before sunrise, and the travelling was in conse-
quence very heavy, the earthy plains being not
only soft, as before, but sticky. Shortly after
leaving camp saw several natives on a sand hill
making signs. I went up to them with Mr
Welch, and after a great deal of trouble persuaded
one to come to me. He was a fine-looking fellow,
painted white, skeleton fashion, and carried a
very long boomerang stuck in his girdle behind.
I could make nothing ol him, excepting that he
gave me a small ball of what seemed to be chewed
grass, as a token of friendship, and in return I
gave him a piece of cold doughboy I had with me
for lunch, which he seemed to relish very much.
We travelled till noon over a succession of earthy
plains, broken by numerous box channels, one of
which contained a large reach of water ; but the
feed everywhere was miserably dry and scarce.
The country looks wretched. After passing this
channel, seven natives made their appearance,
one of whom Mr Brahe recognised as one of the
party who tried to surprise the depot last season.
They presented him with a small quantity of
some dried plant, from a bundle which one of
them carried ; it had a strong pungent taste and
smell, and lam at a loss to conjectura its use,
unless as a kind of tobacco. Our black boy was
frightened, and told me he thought they meant
to ?look out, kill him??as I understood?by
witchcraft, or enchantment, or poison. They fol-
lowed us at a distance to our camp, where they
sat down a little way off, making signs
that they were hungry, and wanted
tomahawks. After an hour?s waiting they
decamped. Killed two deaf adders and a snake
of a sulphur color on the track. Halted
near a small pool of water, where there was a little
green feed, which hits become a rarity; the
country looks miserable ahead. Travelling very
heavy on the horses, as the mud balls in great
lumps. Stony ridges to the S. of the creek, at
about four miles, and a good deal of timber visible
on all sides. Weather still threatening rain;
flies very troublesome.
September 11th, Camp 28, lat. 27 deg. 35 min.;
long. 141 deg. 19 min. Our horses strayed for feed
during the night, and made it late before we
started. Travelled through a box forest full of
channels, when we came to a dry creek coming
from the N.E., with a rocky bed. From here, for
some distance, stony ground to the right hand,
and deep channels running parallel to each other
in a westerly direction. I observed flood marks


considerably higher than our heads on horseback, here lately than elsewhere, and the grass is just
and the water must be much confined by the stony springing, but too short to be of much use. I be-
rises on each side of the creek, although they are
probably two miles apart. Mint was growing on
the edges of the channels, and tea-tree of large
size. We then came on a long reach of water,
about sixty yards wide ; the country miserable,
not a vestige of feed to be seen anywhere, except
the withered and blackened remains of plants on the
plains, and occasional patches of green couch grass
in the creek bed. After this we traversed a box
forest, and came on a deep channel from the
N.E.. where Mr Burke?s first depot was situated.
The feed was slightly better, owing to the sandy
nature of the ground. About noon, passed large
reaches of brackish water, and numerous pools
of brine, in the channels of the creek, but saw
no feed anywhere. At length found one place
where patches of couch grass, with green plants
and tufts of coarse grass, were growing among
the stones, and halted, as the clay plains before
us were perfectly bare. It is long since I have
seen such a barren, miserable place as this part
of Cooper?s Creek, Native camps were numerous,
but all deserted. During the day, flights of
cockatoo parrots passed us, migrating to the east-
ward. Where we are camped the creek is wide,
with a stony bed; the south bank is formed of
limestone, and large quantities of opalized wood
are lying about. A short distance above, the
rocky banks come close down to the creek.
12th September, Camp 29, lat. 27 deg. 35 min. ;
long. 141 deg. 6 min. Travelled over clayey
plains, with scattered timber and a good deal of
withered herbage. A rugged range, apparently
sandstone, with flat-topped hills and peaks to the
N., running N.E. and S.W., at about nine miles
distance. At four miles passed a wide deep reach
of water, several miles in length, between steep
banks, and probably brackish, from its color.
Numbers of pelicans, spoonbills, cormorants, and
other water-fowl on it. On each side bare cracked
plains, extending to the stony rises. At three
miles more, the stony country on our right hand
closed in numerous deep channels, forming the
creek, some of which were rocky, some sandy.
Here, as elsewhere, was green grass and plants
growing on the sand. Rather thickly timoered.
At noon, came to where the creek forces a pas-
sage between rocky ridges ; the channels are
deep and tortuous, and in places encumbered
with large blocks of stone. I here saw red gums
for the first time on the creek. This continued
for four miles, with narrow ridges of hard clay,
covered with dense polygonum, separating the
watercourses, when we came on more open country,
with detached sandhills, and better feed, though
very dry. Large reaches of water ; rocky banks of
sandstone in places ; bars of rock cross the
creek. Camped near some sandhills, at a large
waterhole. After camping, tried fishing, and
good success, only that I lost two hooks, which I
can ill spare Caught five silver perch, weighing
from l|lb to 31b, and several others were caught
by the party by firelight. The fish excellent and
of a fine flavor. Distance, seventeen miles.
September 13, Camp 30, lat. 27 deg. 38 min. ;
long. 141 ceg. Made a short stage to-day, for
the sake of feed for the horses, which is a thing to
be considered, from the dry appearance of the
country. Reached the depot, Fort Wills, in
three miles, through country rather better than
we have seen for some days. More rain has fallen
lieve this to be the first rain for many months.
The water all down the creek as far as we have
. come, has fallen at the rate of about three feet in
the last four months. Found the depot as Mr
Brahe left it, the plant untouched, and nothing
removed of the useless things lying about but a
piece of leather. But from the very evident fact
that things are buried, I cannot understand why
the natives have not found them. From here, fol-
lowed down the creek for several miles, and
camped at some sandhills near a pool of water.
Saw here the track ot a large camel going up the
creek. The small crested pigeon, spoken of by
Sturt, numerous. Cool windfrom S. E.
September 14, Camp 31. Lat., 27 deg. 42 min.;
long. 140 deg. 4 min.?We had a late start this
morning, as three of the horses went away, and
one ill?indeed, I doubted at first whether he
would be able to travel. Followed the course of
the creek down for about nine miles, crossing
several branches which go out south, and form a
reach of water before re-entering the main creek.
Here the rocky ridges on both sides close in, and
the water has forced a narrow deep channel
through a perfect wall of rock, forming below the
finest reach of water we have yet seen?about
500 yards wide, and several miles long, and very
deep. The rugged hills on the north side, and
the fine gums on its banks, produce a fine effect.
The rock through which the channel has been
worn is of a hard flinty nature, inclined to be
columnar, but forming huge masses of boulders.
Deep round hollows have been worn in these by
the floods, and at the water?s edge in, one place
where I tried the depth, the rock is per-
pendicular below the surface. Waterfowl, fish,
and turtle are plentiful. The immediate
neighborhood, and as far as one can see
on each side, is destitute of vegetation, and very
stony. We had some trouble in getting the
horses and camels over the masses of rough
stone which block up both sides of the creek.
Leaving this, we struck across a large bend, over
sandy country, with large red sand hummocks,
and better grassed than any we had yet seen on
the creek. More rain must have fallen here, as
pools of water were visible in many places.
About three o?clock struck the creek again, with
a wide sandy bed, heavily timbered with box and
gum, and scrubby. This creek, I think, had
been running slightly, from the watermarks, and
a good deal of green grass was growing on the
banks. Camped on a large waterhole, about a
quarter of a mile below Mr Burke?s first camp
after leaving the depot. We could see where the
camels had been tied up, but found no marked'
tree. To-day I noticed in two or three places old
camel droppings and tracks, where Mr Brahe in-
formed me he was certain their camels had never
been, as they were watched every day near the
depot, and tied up at night. Mr Burke?s camels
were led on the way down. It looked very much
as if stray camels had been about during the last
four months. The tracks seemed to me to be
going up the creek, but the ground was too stony
to be able to make sure.
Sept. 15. ?Camp 32. Lat. 27 deg. 44 min.,
Long. 140 deg. 40 min.?On leaving this morning
I went ahead with Sandy, to try and pick up Mr
Burke?s track. At the lower end of a large water
hole, found where one or two horses had been


feeding for some months ; the tracks ran in all them, situated on a sandbank between two water-
directions to and from the water, and were as re- holes, and about a mile from the flat where they
cent as a week. At the same place I found the
handle of a clasp-knife. Prom here struck out
south for a short distance from the creek, and
found a distinct camel?s track and droppings on a
native path : the footprint was about tour months
old, and going E. I then set the black boy to
follow the creek, and struck across some sandy
country in a bend on the north side. No tracks
here ; and coming on a native path leading my
way, I followed it, as the most likely place to see
any signs. In about four miles this led me to the
lower end of a very large reach ef water, and on
the opposite side were numbers of native wurleys.
I crossed at a neck of sand, and at a little distance
again came on the track of a camel going up the
creek ; at the same time I found a native, who
began to gesticulate in a very excited manner, and
to point down the creek, bawling out, ? Gow,
gow !? as loud as he could; when I went towards
him he ran away, and finding it impossible to get
Viim to come to me, I turned back to follow the
camel track and to look after my party, as I had
not seen anything of them for some miles. The
track was visible in sandy places, and was evi-
dently the same I had seen for the last two days.
I also found horse tracks in places, but very old.
Crossing the creek, I cut our track, and rode
after the party. In doing so I came upon three
pounds of tobacco, which had lain where I saw
it for some time. This, together with the knife-
handle, the fresh horse tracks, and the camel
track going eastward, puzzled me extremely, and
led me into a hundred conjectures. At the lower
end of the large reach of water before mentioned
I met Sandy and Prank looking for me, with the
intelligence that King, the only survivor of Mr
Burke?s party, had been found. A little further
on I found the party halted, and immediately
went across to the blacks? wurleys, where I found
King sitting in a hut which the natives had made
for him. He presented a melancholy appearance
?wasted to a shadow, and hardly to be distin-
guished as a civilised being but by the remnants
of clothes upon him. He seemed exceedingly
weak, and found it occasionally difficult to follow
what he said. The natives were all gathered
round, seated on the ground, looking with a most
gratified and delighted expression. Camped
where the party had halted on a high bank, close
to the water. I shall probably be here ten days,
to recruit King before returning.
Sept. 16.?Camp 32.?King already looks
vastly improved, even since yesterday, and not
like the same man. Have commenced shoeing
horses and preparing for our return. Wind from
'S.W. with signs of rain. The natives seem te be
getting ready for it.
Sept. 18.?Camp 32. Left camp this morning
with Messrs Brahe, Welch, Wheeler, and King,
to perform a melancholy duty which has weighed
on my mind ever since we have camped here, and
which I have only put off until King should be
well enough to accompany us. We proceeded
down the creek for seven miles, crossing a branch
running to the southward, and followed a native
track leading to that part of the creek where
Mr Burke, Mr Wills, and King camped after
their unsuccessful attempt to reach Mount Hope-
less, and the northern settlements of South Aus -
tralia, and where poor Wills died. ?We found the
two gunyahs pretty much as King had described
procured the nardoo seed, on which they managed
to exist so long. Poor Wills? remains we found
lying in the wurley in which he died, and where
King, after his return from seeking for the natives,
had buried him with sand and rushes. We care-
fully collected the remains and interred them
where they lay; and, not having a prayer-book, I
read chap. xv. of 1 Cor., that we might at least feel
a melancholy satisfaction in having shown the last
respect te his remains. We heaped sand over the
grave, and laid branches upon it, that the natives
might understand by their own tokens not to dis-
turb the last repose of a fellow being. I cut the
following inscription on a tree close by, to mark
the spot: ?
W. J. WILLS,
XLY. Yds.
W.N.W.
The field books, a note-book belonging to Mr
Burke, various small articles lying about, of no
deep value in themselves, but now invested with
an interest from the circumstances connected with
them, and some of the nardoo seed on which they
had subsisted with the small wooden trough in
which it had been cleansed, I have nowin my pos-
session. We returned home with saddened
feelings; but I must confess that I felt a sense of
relief that this painful ordeal had been gonethrough.
King was very tired when we returned, and I must
most unwillingly defer my visit to the spot where
Mr Burke?s remains are lying until he is better able
to bear the fatigue.
September 19.?Shoeing horses. A very slow
and troublesome job, as many have never been
shod before, and our forge is of the most primitive
description. This afternoon got the pigeons in
order of flying. Their tails being rubbed down by
travelling so far in a cage, I got the tails from se-
veral crested pigeons, and inserted feathers in the
stumps of our carriers, fastening the splices with
waxed thread ; the p lan answered far better than
I had expected, and the birds can now fly about
the aviary we have made of a tent with the greatest
ease.
20th September.?Started the pigeons at day-
break, each with a message fastened to its legs.
On throwing them up they commenced wheeling
round the camp, but separated, one being chased
by one of the large kites which are always hover-
ing about the creek. After flying round in
various directions with great speed they gradually
drew across the creek, when we lost sight of
three; the fourth, after making a large circle,
pitched in a tree about a mile off. After break-
fast he was found under a bush, with a kite
watching him ; and the feathers of one of the other
pigeons was found not far off, having been killed.
Of the two others nothing has been seen, and I
hope that they got clear away, but I am much
afraid that the experiment has proved a failure;
however, I should have thought more of it if the
pigeons had made a more decided start. Last
night the wind changed from N.E. to S.W., and
brought up a slight shower. This morning S. W.,
with heavy clouds, threatening rain. King im-
proving slowly, but very weak. Turned out the
white pigeon again this afternoon; he flew into a
gum standing in the camp, and has taken up his


quarters there ?not a proper proceeding for a
carrier-pigeon, according to my ideas.
Sept. 21.?Finding itwouldnotbe prudent for
King to go out for two or three days, I could no
longer defer making a search for the spot where
Mr Burke died ; and with such directions as King
could give, I went up the creek this morning
with Messrs Brahe, Welsh, Wheeler, and Aitkin.
We searched the creek upwards for eight miles,
and, at length, strange to say, found the remains
of Mr Burke lying among tall plants under a
clump of box trees, within 200 yards of our last
camp, and not thirty paces from our track. It
was still more extraordinary that three or four of
the party and the two black boys had been close
to the spot without noticing it. The bones were
entire, with the exception of the hands and feet ;
and the body had been removed, from the spot
whereit first lay, and where the natives had placed
branches over it, to about five paces distance.
I found the revolver which Mr Burke held in his
hand when he expired partly covered with leaves
and earth, and corroded with rust. It was loaded
and capped. We dug agr ave close to the spot,
and interred the remains wrapped in the union
jack?the most fitting covering in which the bones
of a brave but unfortunate man could take their
last rest. On a box tree, at the head of the grave,
the following inscription is cut :
B. O?H. B.
21 I 9 ?6l.

September 22.?The pigeon still keeps its quar-
ters at the camp, and comes down to feed now
and then. I have removed the message, and shall
leave it to its fate. It has been trying hard to
rain for two or three days, but does not seem
able ; great clouds drift over, looking ready to
burst, but only squeeze out two or three drops,
and then pass over. I expect fully that it will
clear up without rain; another dry season will
make Cooper?s Creek look fearfully miserable.
When the hot weather comes on the water holes
will many of them be dry, unless filled by rain or
a flood. I have written down King?s narrative
as much as possible in his own words. Shall
annex it to this diary. Finished shoeing the
horses.
September 23.?Went down the creek to-day, in
search of the natives. One of the party accom-
panied me, and we took two days?rations, in case
it should be necessary to prolong our search. Two
days after we camped here the natives left, and
have not been seen since ; and I could not think
of leaving without showing them that we could
appreciate and reward the kindness they had
shown to Burke?s party, and particularly to King.
For three miles we travelled over alluvial flats
along the creek, timbered with box and large
gums, and dotted with bean-trees, orange-trees
of large size, but at present without fruit, various
kinds of acacias, and other bushes. To the right
hand level flats and sand ridges, apparently toler-
ably grassed. We then came on a large reach of
water, where four or five natives had just been
fishing; their nets were lying on the sand to dry,
and the fire yet burning.* Not seeing any one
about, and getting no answer to a cooey, we went
on. At three miles more we passed the first
feeder of Stralezki?s Creek, going to the south-
ward, and at a large reach of water below found
the natives camped. They made a great commo-
tion when we rode up, but seemed very friendly.
I unpacked my blanket, and took out specimens
of the things I intended giving them?-a toma-
hawk, a knife, beads, a looking-glass, comb,. and
flour and sugar. The tomahawk was the great
object of attraction, after that the knife, but I
think that the looking-glass surprised them most.
On seeing their faces some seem dazzled, others
opened their eyes like saucers, and made a
rattling noise with their tongues expressive of
surprise. We had quite a friendly palaver, and
my watch amused them immensely. When I
gave them some of the sugar to taste, it was ab-
surd to see the sleight of hand with which they
pretended to eat it, I suppose from a fear of being
poisoned, which I suppose is general, as our black
boys are continually in dread lest the ? wild black
fellow? should poison them by some means. I
made them understand that they were to bring
the whole tribe up next morning to our camp to
receive their presents, and we parted the best of
friends. The names of the principal men are
Tchukulow, Mungallee (three in number)', To-
quunter, Pitchery (three in number, one a funny
little man, with his head in a net and a kite?s
feather in it?another a tall man, with his beard
tied in a point), Pruriekow, and Borokow.
September 24.?This morning, about ten o?clock,
our black friends appeared in a long procession,
men, women, and children, or, as they here also
call them, piccaninnies; and at a mile distance
they commenced bawling at the top of their
voices as usual. When collected altogether on a
little flat, just below our camp, they must have
numbered between thirty and forty, and the
uproar was deafening. With the aid of King, I
at last got them all seated before me, and distri-
buted the presents ?tomahawks, knives, necklaces,
looking glasses, combs, among them. I think
no people were ever [so happy before, and it was
very interesting to see how they pointed out one
or another who they thought might be overlooked.
The piccanninies were brought forward by their
parents, to have red ribbon tied round their dirty
little heads. One old woman, Carrawaw, who
had been particularly kind to King, was loaded
with things. I then divided 501b of sugar between
them, each one taking his share in a Union Jack
pocket handkerchief, which they were very proud
of. The sugar soon found its way into their
mouths; the flour, 501b of which I gave them,
they at once called ? white fellow nardoo,? and
they explained that they understood that these
things were given to them for having fed King.
Some old clothes were then p ut on some of the
men and women, and the affair ended in several
of our party and several of the blackfellows having
an impromptu ? corroboree, to the intense delight
of the natives, and, I must say, very much to our
own amusement. They left, making signs ex-
pressive of friendship, carrying their presents
with them. The men all wore a net girdle, and
of the women, some wore one of leaves, others of
feathers. I feel confident that we have left the
best impression behind us, and that the ? white-
fellaws,? as they have already learned to call us,
will be looked on henceforth as friends, and that,
in case of emergency, any one will receive the
kindest treatment at their hands.
Sept. 25. ?At camp 31. This morning I turned
my face homewards. The object of our mission
being fulfilled, I had to do so, but I return with a
great regret at not being able to go on. We take


back five months? rations from this date, at the
scale we have been using, and which has proved
sufficient. The party are in the best of health, the
hcrses in fine order, .and the camels none the
worse for their journey, and decidedly in better
health than when they left the Darling. On the
edge of a country so well worth exploring, in a
tolerably good season, and with the means I now
have at my disposal, I feel how much might be
done. We camped to-day at our last camp but
one coming down the creek, making an easy stage
for King. Got in by noon, as the horses were very
fresh after their spell. The camels gave us a good
deal of trouble this afternoon, and from a cause
which may and probably will constantly occur.
One of the male camels had taken to driving the
females about, and fighting with the other male,
Sama, who up to this time had been master.
To-day the other camel was furious, and in
spite of being short hobbled, and having his
head tied down to his knee, chased the whole of
the camels from the camp, ten minutes after they
were let loose, and although Brahe went imme-
diately after them, and was for three hours on
their tracks, he was unable to overtake them.
Coming back tor a horse he took Sandy with him,
and cut across to where he had left the tracks,
running N. over some very rough stony country.
It was dark before they returned, having found
the camels some miles away. From this and
similar occurrences I find it very unwise to take
male and female camels on a journey together.
One is never safe for a day from their straying,
and from continual fights between the male
camels for mastery. The result is, that the camels
are continually harassed, and watch each other
instead of feeding. With either all male or all
female camels there would be less, or certainly not
more, trouble than with horses ; and with this
drawback, I firmly believe in the suitability of
camels for exploring.
Sept. 26. ?Made ten miles, and camped where
the creek forces a passage through the rocks.
Sept. 27 ?Obliged to stay where we are, as one
of the mares foaled during the night. Knocked
the foal on the head. Blowing hot wind.
Sept. 28.?Camped at the fish-pond, having
made only fifteen miles. King very tired; cannot
ride on a camel, as he thought, and had to give
him a horse to try if it would be easier for him.
Dug up the things planted by Mr Burke and Mr
Wills, and found the field-books and papers all
safe. All hands fishing this evening, and a large
pumber of fish caught, varying from a quarter ef
a pound to three pounds and a quarter. Blowing
a strong hot wind from N. and N.E.; will dry up
the surface water very fast.
September 29.?The doctor does not consider
that King should travel to-day, so shall remain
here. Could not have a much better place on the
creek?plenty of feed and abundance of fish. A
dozen caught this morning weighed nearly twenty
pounds. Two of the party caught seventy-two
pounds weight from three o?clock to sundown,
They are most excellent eating. Ido not know
any fish of as fine a flavour. Strong gale from
N. and N.E., and very hot. If this goes on with-
out rain we shall have some pushing to do before
reaching Kolialto ; and, without rain has fallen, I
do not think we can depend with certainty on
any water from Poria to Nuntherungee Creek?
about 180 miles.
September 30.?Camped at our 28th camp. Sur-
face water nearly all gone, and no feed. Found a
small pool at the mouth of a gully, but all the
other water in the creek was as salt as brine. Hot
wind again.
October I.?Halted above our 27th camp, at a
number of waterholes, where there was pretty
good feed. Passed our black friends on the road,
who invited us to stop and eat fish and nardoo,
and have a corroboree. Strong hot wind from
N.W. round to N.E.?the fifth day now ; and it
seems to have blown away every sign of clouds.
The sky looks hard and blue, with a grey haze on
the horizon, and the vegetation is withering fast.
Where we camped happened to be not more than
a couple of hundred yards from a large native
camp, situated in abranch channel, and completely
hidden by dense timber and scrub. When we ar-
rived, all the men excepting three old fellows
were away, and only the lubras and piccaninnies
were at home, in a terrible fright at so many
white-fellows squatting down close to them.
They began to pack up their things for a flight;
but an amicable understanding being brought
about, and some of the men returning, we were
soon the best of friends. I distributed the few
remaining presents, and they gave in return
some chewed pitchery and nardoo balls. One
old greybeard had been as far as Wonominta
Creek, and could repeat the names of the various
waters between here and that place, via Bulla;
but I found him impenetrable on any other road.
There were about twenty men, all well made and
well fed, and several were eld patriarchs, and
some of them apparently old rascals, too. They
were far more inclined to be troublesome and
importunate than our friends lower down?parti-
cularly one tall young fellow, tubbed all over with
red earth, who pestered me for a tomahawic. One
of them had had his arm broken above the wrist,
and roughly bandaged up with rags and grass
cord; the doctor set it properly, and it was re-
markable to see the perfect composure with
which the blackfellow bore the operation. In
assisting I had to use my clasp-knife to cut bark-
splints, and laying it down beside me it of course
vanished, and I saw no more of it; but strange
to say, in the same place shortty afterwards one of
the knives was found which I had given the
blackfellows, which, I suppose, they had ex-
changed for mine, on the principle of the old
saying, that ?exchange is no robbery.? After a
while the natives began to draw in too close to
our camp, talking a good deal about our ?portos,?
or bundles, so that we had to draw a line as a
boundary, a hint they took at once, and all
squatted down beyond it. At dusk I fired off two
rockets, to their unbounded surprise, but they
were not so alarmed as I expected, probably from
feeling that we were kindly disposed towards
them. I believe that the sight of us smoking,
and seeing the smoke coming out of our mouths,
alarmed them much more, as some made signs to
put the pipe away, and others got up and walked
off, looking behind them. At dark they retired to
their camp.
October 2.?This morning the natives came up
and commenced a brisk trade in nets, grass-string
girdles, boomerangs, and other things, for old
clothes, rags, and such like valuable property. For
part of an old blanket I obtained two boomerangs,
a large staff used in digging roots, one of the long
pointed sticks used in fishing, a stone tomahawk,
cemented into a boxwood handle, and the head of


a larger one, about the size and shape of an
American axe, which the proprietor, a tall old
warrior, with one very sinister eye, scraped up
from the sand by his hut. The smaller tomahawk
he dropped twice between his camp and ours, and
pretended he had never had it, until I made him
understand that I was not going to be done, when
he burst out laughing, and sent his lubra back for
it. The whole mob sat down by our camp, and
observed us packing up with great interest, but
were terribly frightened at the horses, far more so
than at the camels. They accompanied us for
half-a-mile on our road, and then waited looking
alter us for a while. Camped at some sandhills
near our 26th camp, the only water near being
a pool of liquid mud, from which we obtained
a small supply of water by draining the surface.
In going up, this was a fine channel. Day rather
hot, but the wind from the S., and a great im-
provement on the last five of hot winds.
Oct.fi.?This morning the clouds began to bank
up from the south, drawing northward, with every
sign of a thunderstorm. During the time we
were travelling, before reaching our camp, the
clouds continued to gather in masses, threatening
rain, but dispersed as they passed over towards
an arch of blue sky to the north. The country
much greener since we came down, owing to the
two nights rain we had. Camped at the remains
of what was a large sheet of water in one of the
branches of the creek. It has now a very un-
pleasant taste of soda, and produces
thirst rather than quenches it. Sent Phil-
lips away after dinner on one of the spare
horses to run our track as far as possible before
night among the sand-hills, to see if there was
any water in the polygonum flats. The clouds
still gathering, and thunder and heavy rain to the
north-west and south-east. We lit a fire at dark
on the edge of the plain, but had great difficulty
in keeping it up, as the natives had burned all the
dead wood near the water ; by means of this, and
rockets fired occasionally, Phillips returned about
nine o?clock, having been ten miles on the track.
He reported the water to be almost all dried up,
and had only seen two small pools of mud. The
night very dark, with thunder and lightning, but
no rain.
October 4.?Started late this morning, as I
wished all the horses to drink well before leaving
the creek, and also as I had to send the camels
two miles to fill the water-bags, this pool being
scarcely drinkable- I went on ahead of the party
to search for water, but did not leave the track for
the ten miles Phillips had been over. The sand-
hills are looking splendid, the two nights? rain
having covered them with grass and herbage, and
even the earthy flats between the ridges show some
signs of vegetation. About three o?clock I came on
four native children sleeping under the shade of a
box-tree,, and covered with nets. One waking sud-
denly, started up in a terrible fright at such an
unusual sight, and ran off screaming into the
polygonum, where I saw its mother peeping at
me through a bush. When I called out to her
to come she did so, but kept at a very respectful
distance. I asked her for water, and to re- assure
her gave her an old handkerchief. She got her
children gathered round her, two on her back and
one carrying a fourth, all of them screaming
loudly, and having pointed out a little pool of
mud, moved off to a sand-hill, where she com-
menced bawling to some of the natives, who
seemed to be about half a mile off. I went off to
hunt over the flat for water, and shortly heard
shouts of ? Gew, gew,? behind me, from three
natives, who came running up in an excited state,
each with a boomerang or a waddy. We soon,
however, came to a friendly understanding by
means of the few words I knew, and the promise
of a knife decided them to show me the water.
One of them, a jolly-looking young fellow minus
his front teeth, took the lead; the other two,
both of them dressed in red paint and a head net,
keeping a little on one side. We kept up a sort of
conversation, and in half an hour came to their
camp, a large hut on a sand hill, with a small pool
of water near, among the clay pans. I was very
much amused at the ceremonious way in which
ray guide led the way, pointing out the best road,
and very earnestly making me notice the bushe
in my way, as if I were in danger of falling over
them. They gave me as usual a ball of chewed
pitchery, and seemed very much surprised that
neither I nor my horses cared about drinking. I
found it quite impossible to make them under-
stand that the waterhole was too small.
My guide having received his knife,
was now very anxious to fiiave my
shirt, which, of course, I objected to ; and, as
I could learn nothing more, I gave them a few
matches and rode on my way, my four black
friends, however, either out of politeness, or in
the hopes of getting my shirt, followed me, and
kept so close behind the tail of my horse, each
with a waddy in his hand, that I thought it best
to send them back to their camp, whither they
went, after some yabbering among' themselves.
About three miles further on I found eight small
channels of water in a polygonum flat, containing
sufficient water for ourselves and our horses for
two days. Camped here, when the party came
up, in splendid feed.
October 5. Camped to-day at the tank,
which, with the channel by it, is brimful of water.
The country looks beautiful, the sandhills are
covered with flowers and bushes in full bloom,
and swarm with birds of all kinds. It has every
appearance of being spring here. Passed several
fine channels of water by the track. Natives in
various places scattered through these sand-
hills. It is very difficult to estimate the num-
ber of the blacks here, but I believe they can-
not be far short of 400, belonging to Cooper?s
Creek.
6th October.?Stokes? Ranges, Surprise Creek.
?Left the tank this morning, carrying as much
water as possible on the camels, and two horse-
loads, sufficient for ourselves for four days and
one drink for the horses ; calculating on making
Koliatti or Poria Creek, in four days. If I find
water on the track I intend striking for Wilkie?s
Creek. The sandhills covered with grass and
flowers, and even the bare clayed plains, and the
miserable stony country between them and the
ranges, had struggled into something resembling
vegetation. The ranges, where we entered them,
by Brahe s Gap, are not so high as where we
crossed them more to the westward, but ran in
low ridges along wide stony valleys formed by
the numerous gorges we found so difficult to
cross. Mulga and acacia scrub everywhere, but
not much feed : only saltbush and very short
herbage grown since the rains. We were agree-
ably surprised by a fine waterhole in the first
oreek we came to, which proved to be the lowest


of several of nearly the same size higher up the
creek. I believe it to be about ten yards wide
and eighty long, and some three or four feet
deep. Distance eighteen miles.
October 7. ?Stokes? Ranges, Keppel's Creek,
lat. 28 deg. 17 min., lone. 142 deg. 30 min.?We
were late in leaving camp this morning, as nine-
teen of the horses had followed the track back for
several miles. The country travelled through for
fifteen miles was much of the same character?
wide stony flats surrounded by low ridges, and
intersected by gum creeks coming from the
gorges in a northerly direction. We passed
through a succession of gaps, in each of which
we found a creek with pools of clear rain water,
and from the very loose gravelly nature of the
ground, I am inclined to believe that these creeks
are still running slowly underground since the
rain. At fifteen miles came on the south slopes
of the range, with a wide view towards Koliatti
and Poria. Camped on a small watercourse near
its junction with Keppel?s Creek. Two tolerable
pools of water. Another make-believe thunder
storm to-night, with violent gusts of wind, but
no rain, excepting at two places to the N.W.,
where it appeard to be raining, about a mile wide.
Everything looks spring-like here.
Oct. B.?Junction Camp, No. 21.?Crossed
Keppel?s Creek and crossed over stony slopes, for
six miles, when we crossed the creek on to barren
sandy plains. At three miles entered the sand-
hills and found the country terribly burned up,
and no signs of water. Rain cannot have fallen
here for some time. Made our old camp in
twenty-two miles from Keppel?s Creek, and found
water still in the small creek, but the feed very
dry and scanty.
9th October.?Poria Creek.?When the party
started this morning I went to the westward of
the track, and found that at a short distance the
sandhills terminated in the gum forest and poly-
gonum swamps before mentioned. Prom a high
sandhill I could see across these for many miles
towards the range, in a westerly direction; and I
believe that they also extend to or across Wilkie?s
Creek to the south. I found no water, but lam
convinced that there are other channels similar
to the one we camped on last night, which will
contain water for months after rain. At Wilkie?s
Creek I again left the track, and followed the
creek upwards, crossing several deep channels
running in and out from it, and full of water.
At a short distance I came on a large sheet of
water, certainly mote than a mile long, and about
eighty feet wide, and with the couch grass grow-
ing on its banks, and large box timber, having a
striking resemblance to some of the smaller
branches of Cooper?s Creek. It is a far finer
watercourse than lat first supposed. Made
Poria Creek about two o?clock. The country
very dry and parched?we seem, in one day?s
journey, to have travelled from spring to spring.

Sunday, 16th December, 1860.?The two horses
having been shod, and our reports finished,
we started at 6.40 a.m. for Eyre?s Creek,
the party consisting of Mr Burke, myself,
King, and Charley, having with us six
camels, one horse, and three months? pro-
visions. We followed down the creek to the
point where the sandstone ranges cross the creek,
and were accompanied to that place by Brahe,
who would return to take charge of the depdt.
Down to this point the banks of the creek are
very rugged and stoney, but there is a tolerable
supply of grass and salt bush in the vicinity. A
large tribe of blacks came pestering us to go to
their camp and have a dance, which we declined.
They were very troublesome, and nothing but
the threat to shoot them will keep them away;
they are, however, easily frightened, and,
although fine-looking men, decidedly not of a
warlike disposition. They show the greatest in-
clination to take whatever they can, but will run
no unnecessary risk in so doing. They seldom
carry any weapons, except a shield and large
kind of boomerang, which I believe they use for
killing rats, &c.; sometimes, but very seldom,
they have a large spear; reed spears seem to be
quite unknown to them. They are undoubtedly
a finer and better looking race of men than the
blacks on the Murray and Darling, and more
peaceful, but in other respects I believe they did
not compare favorably with them, for, from the
little we have seen of them, they appear to be
mean spirited and contemptible in every res-
pect.
Monday, December 17th, 1860.?We continued
to follow down the creeks. Found its course very
crooked, and the channel frequently dry for a
considerable distance, and then forming magnifi-
cent waterholes, abounding in waterfowl of all
kinds. The country on each side is more open
than on the upper part of the creek. The soil on
the plains is of a light earthy nature, supporting
abundance of saltbush and grass. Most of the
plains are lightly timbered, and the ground is
finer, and not cracked up, like at the head of the
creek. Left Camp No. LXYII at ten minutes to
six a.m., having breakfasted before leaving. We
followed the creek along from point to point, at
first in a direction W.N.W. for about twelve
miles, then about N. W. At about noon we passed
the last water, a short distance beyOnd which the
creek runs out on a polygonum (Polygonum
Cunninghami) flat ; but the timber was so
large and dense, that it deceived us into the
belief that there was a continuation of the
channel; on crossing the polygonum ground
to where we expected to find the creek, we be-
came aware of our mistake. Not thinking it
advisable to chance the existence of water a-head
we camped at the end of a large but shallow sheet
of water in the sandy bed of the creek. The hole
was about 150 links broad, and feet deep in
most places. In most places the temperature of
the water was almost incredibly high, which in-
duced me to try it in several places. The mean
of two on the shady side of the creek gave 97.4
deg. As may be imagined, this water tasted dis-
agreeably warm, but we soon cooled some in
water bags, and thinking that it would be in-
teresting to know what we might call cool, I
placed the thermometer in a pannikin containing
some that appeared delighfuliy cool, almost cold
in fact. Its temperature was, to our astonish-
ment, 78 deg. At half-past six, when a strong
wind was blowing from south, and temperature


of air had fallen to SOdeg,, the lowest temperature
of water in the hose, that had been exposed to the
full effect of evaporation for several hours, was 72
degs. This water for drinking appeared posi-
tively cold, too low a temperature to be pleasant
under the circumstance. A remarkable southerly
squall came on between five and six p.m., with
every appearance of rain. The sky, however, soon
cleared, but the wind continued to blow in a
squally and irregular manner, from the same
quarter at evening.
Wednesday, 19th December, 1860. ?Started at
a quarter past eight a.m., leaving what seemed to
be the end of Cooper?s Creek. We took a course
a little to the north of west, intending to try and
obtain water in some of the creeks that Sturt
mentioned that he had crossed, and at the same
time to see whether they were connected with
Cooper?s Creek, as appeared most probable from
the direction in which we found the latter run-
ning, and from the manner in which it had been
breaking up into small channels flowing across
the plains in aN. and N.N.W. direction. We
left on our right the flooded flats on which this
branch of the creek runs out, and soon came to a
series of sand ridges, the direction of which
were between N. |-W. and N.N.W. The
country is well grassed, and supports plenty of
saltbush. Many of the valleys are liable to be
inundated by the overflow of the main creek.
They have watercourses and polygonum flats,
oordered with box trees, but we met with no holes
fit to hold a supply of water. At about ten miles
we crossed a large earthy flat, lightly timbered
with box and gum. The ground was very bad
tor travelling on, being much cracked up, and
intersected by innumerable channels, which con-
tinually carried off the water of a large creek.
Some of the valleys beyond this were very pretty,
the ground being? sound and covered with fresh
plants, which made them look beautifully green.
At fifteen miles we halted, where two large plains
joined. Our attention had been attracted by some
red-breasted cockatoos, pigeons, a crow, and
several other birds, whose presence made us feel
sure that there was water not far off; but our
hopes were soon destroyed by finding a claypan
just drying up. It contained just sufficient
liquid to make the clay boggy. At ten minutes to
seven p.m. we moved on, steering straight for
Eyre?s Creek, N.W. by N., intending to make a
good night?s journey, and avoid the heat of the
day ; but at a mile and a half we came to a creek,
which looked so well that we followed it for a
short distance, and finding two or three water-
holes of good milky water, we camped for the
night. This enabled me to secure an observa-
tion of the eclipse of Jupiter?s I satellite, as well
as some latitude observations. The night was so
calm that I used the water as a horizon, but I
find it much more satisfactory to take the mer-
cury, for several reasons.
Thursday, 21st (20tii) December.?We did not
leave this camp until halt-past eight, having de-
layed to refill the waterbags with the milky water,
which all of us found to be a great treat again.
It is certainly more pleasant to drink than the
clear water, and at the same time more satisfying.
Our course from here, N.W. by N., took us
through some pretty country, lightly timbered
and well-grassed. We could see the line of creek
timber winding through the valley on our left.
At a distance of five miles there was a bush fire
on its banks, and beyond it the creek made a
considerable bend to the S.W. At two miles
further we came in sight of a large lagoon bearing
N. by W., and at three miles more we camped on
what would seem the same creek as last night,
near where it enters t� the lagoon. The latter is of
great extent, and contains a large quantity of
water, which swarms with wild fowl ot every de-
scription. It is very shallow, but is surrounded
by the most pleasing woodland scenery, and
everything in the vicinity looks fresh and
green The creek near its junction with
the lagoon contains some good waterholes,
five to. six feet deep. They are found
in a sandy alluvium, which is very boggy
when wet. There was a large camp of not less
than forty or fifty blacks near where we stopped.
They brought us presents of fish, for which we
gave them some beads and matches. These fish
we found to be a most valuable addition to our
rations. They were of the same kind as we had
found elsewhere, but finer, being nine to ten
inches long, and two to three inches deep, and in
such good condition that they might have been
fried in their own fat. It is a remarkable fact,
that these were the first blacks who have offered
us any fish since we reached Cooper?s Creek.
Friday, 21st December.?We left camp LXX
at half-past five a.m., and tried to induce
one or two of the blacks to go with us, but
it was of no use. Keeping our former
course we were pulled up at three miles by a
fine lagoon, and then by the creek that flows
into it; the latter being full of water we were
obliged to trace it a mile up before we could cross.
I observed on its banks two wild plants of the
gourd or melon tribe ; one much resembling a
stunted cucumber, the other, both in leaf and ap-
pearance of fruit, was very similar to a small
model of a water melon (probably muckia mic-
rantha). The latter plant I also found at camp 68
On tasting the pulp of the newly-found fruit,
which was about the size of a large pea, I found
it to be so acrid that it was with difficulty that I
removed the taste from my mouth. At eight or
nine miles from where we crossed the creek we
passed another large lagoon, leaving it two miles
on our left, and shortly afterwards we saw one
nearly as far on our right. This last we should
have availed ourselves of, but that we expected
to find water in a creek which we could see by
the timber lining its banks, flowed from the lagoon
on Our left, and crossed our course a few miles a
head. We reached it at a distance of four or
five miles further, and found a splendid water-
nole, at which we camped. The creek at this
point flows in a northerly direction, through a
large lightly-timbered flat, on which it par-
tially runs out. The ground is, however, sound
and well clothed with grass and salsolaceous
plants. Up to this point the country through which
we have passed has been of the finest description
for pastoral purposes. The grass and saltbush
are everywhere abundant, and water is plentiful,
with every appearance of permanence. We met
with porcupine grass (Triodia pungens Br.J
and only two sand ridges before reaching Camp
LXXI.

Saturday, 22nd December.?At five minutes to


five a.m. we left one of the most delightful camps
we have had in the journey, and proceeded on the
same course as before, N.W. by N., across
some high ridges of loose sand, many of which
were partially clothed with porcupine grass. We
found the ground much worse to travel over than
any we have yet met with. As the ridges were
exceedingly abrupt and steep on their eastern
side, and although sloping gradually towards the
west, were so honeycombed in some places by the
burrows of rats, that the camels were continually
in danger of falling At a distance of about six miles
we descended from these ridges to undulating
country of opm box forest, where everything
was green and fresh. There is an abundance of
grass and salt bushes, and lots of birds of all
descriptions. Several flocks of pigeons passed
over our heads, making for a point a little to our
right, where there is no doubt plenty of water,
but we did not go off our course to look for it.
Beyond the box forest, which kept away to the
right, we again entered the sand ridges, and at a
distance of six miles passed close to a dry salt
lagoon, the ridges in the vicinity of which are
less regular in their form and direction, and con-
tain nodules of limestone. The ground in the
flats and claypans near has that encrusted sur-
face that cracks under the pressure of the foot,
and is a sure indication of the presence of saline
deposits. At a distance of eight miles from the
lagoon we camped at the foot of a sand ridge,
jutting out on the stoney desert. I was rather
disappointed, but not altogether surprised, to find
the latter nothing more nor less than the stoney
rises that we had before met with, only on a
larger scale, and not quite as undulating. During
the afternoon several crows came to feed on the
plain. They came from an E.N.E. direction, no
doubt from a portion of the creek that flows
through the forest that we left on our right. In
the morning, as we werefloading, a duck passed
over, but it was too dark to see which way it
went.
Sunday, December 23.?At five a.m. we struck
out across the desert in a W.N.W. direction. At
four miles and a half we crossed a sand ridge, and
then returned to our N.W. by N. course. We
found the ground not nearly so bad for travelling
on as that between Bulloo and Cooper?s Creek ;
in fact, I do not know whether it arose from our
exaggerated anticipation of horrors or not, but
we thought it far from bad travelling ground, and
as to pasture, it is only the actually stoney ground
that is bare, and many a sheep run is, in fact,
worse grazing than that. At fifteen miles we
crossed another sandridge, for several miles around
which there is plenty of grass and fine saltbush.
After crossing this ridge we descended to an
earthy plain where the ground was rather heavy,
being in some places like pieces of slaked lime
and intersected by small watercourses. Flocks
of pigeons rose from amongst the salt bushes and
polygonum, but all the creeks were dry, al-
though marked by lines of box timber. Several
gunyahs of the blacks were situated near a water-
hole that had apparently contained water very
lately, and heaps of grass were lying about the
plains, from which they had beaten the seeds.
We pushed on, hoping to find the creeks as-
suming an improved appearance, but they did
not, and at one o?clock we halted, intending to
travel through part of the night ; about sunset
three flocks of pigeons passed over us, all going in
the same direction, due north by compass, and
passing over a ridge of sand in that direction.
Not to have taken notice of such an occurrence
would have been little short of a sin, so we de-
termined to go eight or ten miles in that direc-
tion. Starting at seven o?clock p.m., we, at six
miles, crossed the ridge over which the birds had
flown, and came on a flat, subject to inundation ;
the ground was at first hard and even, like the
bottom of a clay pan, but at a mile or so we came
on cracked earthy ground, intersected by number-
less small channels running in all directions. At
nine miles we reached the bed of a creek running
from east to west; it was only bordered by poly-
gonum bughes, but as there vt as no timber visible
on the plains, we thought it safer to halt until
daylight, for fear we would miss the water. At
daylight, when we had saddled, a small quantity
of timber could be. seen, at the point of a sand
ridge, about one and a half to two miles to the
west of us, and on going there we found a fine
creek, with a splendid sheet of water, more than
a mile long and averaging nearly three chains
broad; it is, however, only two or three feet deep
in most parts.
Monday, 24th December, 1860. ?We took a
day of rest on Gray?s Creek, to celebrate Christ-
mas. This was doubly pleasant, as we had never
in our most sanguine moments anticipated of find-
ing such a delightful oasis in the desert. Our
camp was really an agreeable place, for we had all
the advantages of food and water attending a posi-
tion of a large creek or river, and were at the same
time free of the annoyance of the numberless ants,
flies, and mosquitoes that are invariably met with
amongst timber or heavy scrub.
Tuesday, 25thDecember, 1860.?We left Gray?s
Creek at half-past four a.m., and proceeded to
cross the earthy rotten plains in the direction of
Eyre?s Creek. At a distance of about nine miles
we reached some lines of trees and bushes, which
were visible from the top of the sand ridge at
Gray?s Creek. We found them growing on the
banks of several small creeks, which trend to the
N. and N.N.W. At a mile and a half fur-
ther we crossed a small creek, N.N.E.,
and joining the ones above-mentioned. This
creek contained abundance of water, in
small detached holes, from fifty to one
hundred links long, well shaded by steep banks
and overhanging bushes. The water had a sus-
piciously transparent color and a slight trace of
brackishness, but the latter was scarcely percep-
tible. Near where the creek joined them is a
sandhill and a dense mass of fine timber. The
smoke of a fire indicated the presence of blacks,
who soon made their appearance, and followed us
for some distance, beckoning us away to the N.E.
We, however, continued our course to the N.W.
by N., but at a distance of a mile and a half,
found that the creeks did not come round as we
expected, and that the fall of the water was in a
direction nearly opposite to our course, or about
west to east. We struck off N. ~W. for a high
sandridge, from which we anticipated seeing whe ?
ther it were worth while for us to follow the course
of the creeks we had crossed. We were sur-
prised to find all the watercourses on the plains
trending rather to the south of east; and at a dis-
tance of three miles, after changing our course,
and when we approached the sandhills towards
which we had been steering, we were agreeably
pulled up by a magnificent creek, coming from the


N.N.W. and running in the direction of the
fire we had seen. We had now no choice but to
change our course again, for we could not have
crossed even if we had desired to do so. On fol-
lowing up the south bank of the creek, we found
it soo i keeping a more northerly course than it had
where we first struck it. This fact, together with
its magnitude and general appearance, lessened
the probability of its being Eyre?s Creek, as
seemed at first very likely from their relative'
positions and directions. The day being very hot,
and the camels tired from travelling over the
earthy plains, which, bye the bye, are not nearly
so bad as those at the head of Cooper?s Creek, we
camped at one o?clock p.m., having traced the
creek up about five miles not counting the bends.
For the whole of this distance, we found not a
break or interruption of water, which appears to
be very deep ; the banks are from twenty to thirty
feet above the water, and very steep; they are
clothed near the water?s edge with mint and other
weeds, and on the top of each side there is a belt
of boxtrees and various shrubs. The lower part
of the creek is bounded towards the north by a
high red sand ridge, and on the south side is an
extensive plain, intersected by numerous water-
courses, which drain off the water in flood time.
The greater portion of the plain is at present very
bare, but the stalks of dry grass show that after
rain or floods there will be a good crop on the
harder and well drained portion, but I believe the
loose earthy portions support no vegetation at
any time. The inclination of the ground from
the edge of the creek bank towards the plain is
in many places very considerable. This I should
take to indicate that the flooding is or has been
at one time both frequent and regular.
Wednesday, 26th December, 1860.?We started
at five a.m., following up the creek from point
to point of the bends ; its general course was at
first north by west, but at about six miles the
sand ridge on the west closed in on it, and at this
point it takes a turn to the north-north-east for
half-a-mile, and then comes around suddenly
north-west. Up to this point it had been rather
improving in appearance than otherwise, but in
the bend to the Uorth-west the channel is very
broad, its bed being limestone, rock, and indurated
clay, is, for a space of five or six chains quite
dry, then commences another waterhole, the creek
keeping a little more towards north. We crossed
the creek here and struck across the plain on a
due north course, for we could see the line of
timber coming up to the sand ridges in that direc-
tion. For a distance of seven or eight miles, we
did not touch the creek, and the eastern sand
ridge receded to a distance in some places of
nearly three miles, from our line, leaving an im-
mense extent of grassy plain between it and the
creek. The distinctly marked feature on the
lower part of this creek is, that whenever the main
creek is on one side of a plain, there is always a
fine billybong on the opposite side, each of them
almost invariably sticking close to the respec-
tive sand ridges. Before coming to the next
bend of the creek, a view from the top of a sand-
hill showed me that the creek receives a large
tributary from the northwest, at about two miles
above where we had crossed it. A fine line of
timber running up to the north-west, joined an
extensive tract of box forest, and the branch we
were following was lost to view in a similar forest
towards the north. The sand ridge was so abrupt
when we came to the creek, that it was necessary
to descend into its bed through one of the small
ravines adjoining it. We found it partially run
out, the bed being sand, and strewed with
nodules of lime, some of which were 1| to 2 feet
long. They had apparently been formed in the
sand-downs by infiltration.

Tuesday, 30th December, 1860. ?Finding that
the creek was trending considerably towards the
east, without much likelihood of altering its
course, we struck off from it, taking a ten days?
supply of water, as there were ranges visible to
the north, which had the appearance of being
stoney. A north-east by north course was first
taken for about seven miles, in order to avoid
them. The whole of this distance was over allu-
vial earthy plains, the soil of which was firm but
the vegetation scanty.

Saturday, sth January, 1861. ?On leaving
Camp LXXXIY., we found slight but distinct
ndications of rain in the groves, and a few blades
of grass and small weeds in the little depressions
on the plain. These indications were, however,
so slight, that but for the fact of our having
found surface water in two holes near our camp,
we should hardly have noticed them. At a dis-
tance of about two miles, in a north north-east
direction, we came to a creek with a long, broad,
shallow water-hole. The well worn paths, the
recent track of natives, and the heaps of shells, on
the contents of which the latter had feasted,
showed at once that this creek must be connected
with some creek of considerable importance. The
camels and horses being greatly in need of rest, we
only moved up about half a mile, and camped for
the day.
Sunday, 6th January, 1861. ?Started at twenty
minutes to six o?clock, intending to make an easy
day?s stage along the creek. As we proceeded up
in a northerly direction we found the waterhole
to diminish in size very much, and at about two
and a half miles the creek ran out in a lot of small
water-courses. At the upper end of the creek we
found in its bed what appeared to be an arrange-
ment for catching fish. It consisted of a small
oval mud paddock about 12ft by Bft, the sides of
which were about nine inches above the bottom of
the hole and the top of the fence, covered with
long grass, so arranged that the ends of the
blades overhung scantily by several inches the
sides of the hole. As there was no sign of timber
to the north, we steered off to north-west by
north for a fine line that came up from the south-
west, and seemed to run parallel with the creek
we were about to leave. At a distance of about
three miles we reached the bank of a fine creek
containing a sheet of water two chains broal, and
at least fifteen feet deep in the middle. The
banks are shelving, sandy, and lightly clothed
with box trees and various shrubs. On starting
to cross the plains towards this creek, we were
surprised at the bright green appearance of strips
of land, which look in the distance like swamps ;
on approaching some of therfi we found that there
had been a considerable fall of rain in some places,


mchhad raised a fine crop of grass and portulac*
herever the soil was of a sandy and light nature ;
but the amount of moisture had been insufficient
to affect the clayey ground which constitutes the
main portion of the plain. The sight of two
natiye companions feeding here, added greatly to
the encouraging prospects; they are the only
specimens of that bird that I remember to have
seen on that side of the Darling.
7ih January, 1861.?We started at half-past 4
a.m. without water, thinking that we might
safely rely on this creek for one day?s journey.
We however found the line of timber soon begin
to look small ; at three miles the channel con-
tained only a few pools of surface water. We
continued across the plains on a due north course
frequently crossing small water courses, which
had been filled by the rain, but were fast drying
up. Here and there as we proceeded, dense
lines of timber on our .right showed that the
creek came from the east of north. At a dis-
tance of thirteen miles we turned to the north
north-east, towards a fine line of timber. We
found a creek of considerable dimensions, that
had only two or three small waterholes ; but as
there was more than sufficient for us and very
little feed for the beasts anywhere else, we
camped. I should have liked this camp to have
been in a more prominent and easily recognised
position, as it happens to be almost exactly on
the tropic of Capricorn. The tremendous gale
of wind that we had in the evening and night
prevented me from taking a latitude observa-
tion, whereas I had some good ones at the last
camp, and at camp LXXXYI. My reckoning
cannot be far out. I found on taking out my
instruments one of the spare thermometers was
broken, and the glass of my aneroid barome-
ter cracked. The latter I believe, not otherwise
injured. This was done by the camel having
taken it into his head to roll, while the pack was
on his back.
Tuesday, Bth January, 1861.?Started at a
quarter past 5 a.m. with a load of water, deter-
mined to be independent of all creeks and water-
courses. At a mile and a half found surface
water in small creek, and at a mile further, water
in two or three places on the open plains.
The country we crossed for the first ten miles
consists of fine open plains of firm argillaceous
soil, too stiff and hard to be affected by the
small quantity of rain that has fallen as yet.
They are subject to inundations from the overflow
of a number of small creeks which intersect
them in a direction E.N.E. to W.S.W. Nearly
all the creeks are lined with box trees and shrubs
in a tolerably healthy state ; of the remains of
dead trees there is only a fair proportion to the
living ones. After traversing a plain of greater
extent than the rest, we at ten miles reached the
creek proportionately large and important looking.
The channel, however, at the point where we
struck it, was deep, level, and dry, but I believe
there is water in it not far off; for there were some
redbreasted cockatoos in the trees and native par-
rots on each side. On the north side there is a
part bearing off to the N.N.W. The mirage on the
flain to the south of the creek was stronger than
have before seen it. There appear to be sheets of
water within a few yards of one, and it looks suf-
ficiently smooth and glassy to be used for an arti-
* Fortulaea olerasca.?L.
ficial horizon. To the westward of the plains some
fine sandhills were visible nearly in the direction
in which the creek flowed. To the north of the
creek the country undergoes a great change. At
first there is a little earthy lai d subject to inun-
dation. The soil then becomes more sandy, the
stoney pans in which water collects after rain; the
whole country is slightly undulating, lightly tim-
bered, and splendidly grassed. A number of
small disconnected creeks are scattered about,
many of which contained water, protected from
the sun by luxuriant growth of fine grasses and
small bushes. We passed one or two little rises
of sand and pebbles, on which were growing some
trees quite new to me ; but for the seed pods, I
should have takenth�m of a species of casuaerinse,
although the leave stalks have not the jointed
peculiarities of those plants. The trunks and
branches are like the sheoak, the leaves like those
of a pine ; they droop like a willow, and the
seed is small, flat, in a large flat pod about six
inches by three quarters of an inch. As we pro-
ceeded, the country improved at every step.
Flocks of pigeons rose and flew off to the east-
ward, and fresh plants met our view on every
rise ; everything green and luxuriant. The horse
licked his lips, and tried all he could to break
his nose-string to get at the feed. We camped at
the foot of a sandy rise, where there was a large
stoney pan with plenty of water, and where the
feed was equal in quantity and superior as to
variety, to any that I have seen in Australia,'
excepting, perhaps, on some soils of volcanic
origin.
Wednesday, 9th January, 1861.?Started at five
minutes past five without water, trusting to get a
supply of water from the rain that fell during
the thunderstorm. Traversed six miles of undu-
lating plains covered with vegetation richer
than ever; several ducks rose from the little
creeks as we passed, and flocks of pigeons were
flying in all directions. The richness of the
vegetation is evidently not suddenly arising
from chance thunderstorms, for the trees and
bushes on the open plain are everywhere
healthy and freshiooking, very few dead ones
are to be seen ; besides which the quantity of
dead and rotten grass which at present almost
overgrows in some places the young blades,
shows that this is not the first crop of the
kind. The grasses are numerous, and many of
them unknown to me, but they only constitute a
moderate portion of the herbage; several kinds
of spurious vetches and portulac, as well as
salsolaceae add to the luxuriance of the vegeta-
tion. At seven miles we found ourselves in an
open forest country, where the feed was good,
but not equal to what we had passed, neither
had it been visited by yesterday?s rain. We
soon emerged again on open plains, but the soil
being of a more clayish nature, they were not
nearly so, much advanced in vegetation as the
others; we found surface waters in several places
and at one spot disturbed a fine bustard which
was feeding in the long grass.We did not see him
until he flew up. I should have mentioned that
one flew over our camp last evening in a northerly
direction; this speaks well for the country and
climate. At noon we came to a large creek the
course of which was from east north-east to west
south-west. The sight of white gum-trees in the
distance had raised hopes which were not at alflj
damped on a close inspection of the channel. JjLt


the point where we struck it there was certainly on the banks was an abundance of good feed, but
no great quantity of water, the bed was broad and very little timber.
sandy, but its whole appearance was that of an Friday, 11th January, 1861.?Started at five
sandy, but its whole appearance was that of an
important watercourse ; and the large gums
which line its banks, together with the improved
appearance of the soil, and the abundance of feed
in the vicinity, satisfied us as to the permanency
of the waters and the value of the discovery.
Although it was so early in the day, and we were,
anxious to make a good march, yet we camped
here, as it seemed to be almost a sin to leave such
good quarters. The bed of the creek is loose
sand, through which the water freely permeates ;
it is, however, sufficiently coarse not to be boggy ;
and animals can approach the water without any
difficulty.
Thursday, 10th January, 1861.-?At five o?clock
twenty minutes a.m., we left our camp with a
full supply of water, determined to risk no re-
verses, and to make a good march, I should
mention that last evening we had been nearly
deafened by the noise of the cicadas, and but for
our large fires should have been kept awake all
night by the mosquitoes. A walk of two miles
across a well grassed plain brought us to a
belt of timber, and we soon afterwards found
ourselves pulled up by a large creek, in which
the water was broad and deep. We had to
follow up the bank of the creek in a north-
east direction, for nearly a mile before we could
cross, when to our joy we found that it was
flowing, not a muddy stream from the effects of
recent floods, but a small rivulet of clear water
as pure as crystal. The bed of the river at this
place is deep and rather narrow, the water flows
over sand and pebbles, winding its way between
clumps of melaleuca and gum saplings. After
leaving the river we kept our old course, due
north, crossing, in a distance of one mile three
creeks with gum trees on their banks, the soil of
the flats through which they flow is a red loam
of fair quality, and well grassed. Beyond the
third creek is a large plain, parts of which are
very strong ; and this is bounded towards the east
by a low stoney rise, partly composed of decayed
and honeycombed quartz rock in situ, and partly
of water-worn pebbles and other alluvial deposits.
At about two miles across this plain we reached
the first of a series of small creeks with deep
waterholes; these creeks and holes have the
characteristics peculiar to watercourses which are
found in flats formed from the alluvial deposits of
sehistose rocks. The banks are on a level with
the surrounding ground, and are irregularly
marked by small trees or only by tufts of long
grass which overhang the channel and frequently
hide it from one?s view, even when within a few
yards. At about five miles from where we crossed
the river we came to the main creek in these flats,
Patten?s Creek; it flaws along at the foot of a
stoney range, and we had to trace it up nearly a
mile in a north-north-easterly direction, before we
could cross it. As it happened, we might almost
as well have followed its course up the flat, for at
a little more than two miles we came to it again ;
we re-crossed it at a stoney place just below a very
large waterhole, and then continued our course
over extensive plains, not so well grassed as what
we bad passed before, and very stoney in some
places. At eight miles from Patten?s Creek we
came to another, running from south-west to
south-east; there was plenty of water in it, but |
it was evidently the result of recent local rains; l
a.m., and in the excitement of exploring tine well-
watered country forgot all about the eclipse of the
sun, until the reduced temperature and peculiarly
gloomy appearance of the sky drew our attention
to the matter ; it was then too late to remedy the
deficiency, so we made a good day?s journey, the
moderation of the mid-day heat, which was only
about 86 deg., greatly assisting us. The country
traversed has the most verdant and cheerful
aspect, abundance of feed and water everywhere.
All the creeks seen to-day have a course more or
less to the east by south. The land improves in
appearance at every mile. A quantity of rain has
fallen here and to the south, and some of the flats
are suitable for cultivation if the regularity of the
seasons will admit.

Saturday, 12th January, 1861.?We started
at five a.m., and keeping as nearly as pos-
sible a due north course, traversed for about
eight miles, a splendid flat, through which
flow several fine well watered creeks, lined
with white gumtrees. We then entered a series
of slatey low sandstone ranges, amongst which,
were some well grassed fiats and plenty of water
in the main gullies. The more stoney portions are,
however, covered with porcupine grass, and here
and there with mallee; large ant hills are
very numerous, they vary in height from
21 to 4 feet. There was a continuous rise
perceptible all the way in crossing the ranges, and
from the highest portion, which we reached at a
distance of about 7 miles, we had a pretty good
view of the country towards the north. As far
as we could see in the distance, and bearing due
north, was a large range, having somewhat the
outline of a granite mountain. The east end of
this range just comes up to the magnetic north;
the left of this and bearing north north west, is
a single conical peak, the top of which only is
visible. Further to the west there were some
broken ranges, apparently sandstone ; to the east
of north the tops of very distant and apparently
higher ranges were seen, the outline of which
was so indistinct that I can form no idea as to
their character; the intermediate country below us
appeared alternations of fine valleys and stoney
ranges, such as we had just been crossing. From
here a descent of two miles brought us to a creek
having a northern course, but on tracing it down
for about a mile, we found it turn to the south-
east, and join another from the north. We crossed
over to the latter on a north-by-west course, and
camped on the west bank. It has a broad sandy
channel, the water-holes are large but not deep,
the banks are bordered -with fine white gums, and
are in some places very scrubby. There is abun-
dance of rich green feed everywhere in the vicinity.
We found here numerous indications of blacks
having been here, but saw nothing of them. It
seems remarkable that where their tracks are so
plentiful we should (see) none since weleft King?s
Creek. I observed that the natives here climb
trees like those on the Murray, &c,, in search of
seme anim&l corresponding in habits' to the
opossum, which they get out of the hollow


branches in a similar manner. I have not yet
been able to ascertain what the animal is.
Sunday, 13th January, 1861. ?We did not leave
camp this morning until half-past seven, having
delayed for the purpose of getting the camels?
shoes on, a matter in which we were eminently
unsuccessful. We took our breakfast before
starting for almost the first time since leaving the
depot. Having crossed the creek, our course was
due north as before, until at about six miles we
came in sight of the range ahead, when we took a
north half-east direction for the purpose of clearing
the eastern front of it. We found the ground more
sandy than what we had before crossed, and a
great deal of it even more richly grassed. Camp
XCIII is situated at the junction of three sandy
creeks, in which there is abundance of water.
The sand is loose, and the water permeates freely,
so that the latter may be obtained delightfully
cool and clear by sinking anywhere in the beds of
the creeks.

Saturday, 19th January, 1861.?Started from
camp XCVIII. at 5.30 a.m., and passing to
the northwest of Mount Forbes, across a
fine and well grassed plain, kept at first a north
by east direction; at a distance of three miles
the plain became everywhere stoney, being scat-
tered over with quarts pebbles, and a little fur-
ther on we came to low quartz ranges, the higher
portions of which are covered with porcupine
grass, but the valleys are well clothed with a
variety of coarse and rank herbage. At about 5
miles we crossed a creek with a sandy bed, which
has been named Green?s Creek. There were blacks
not far above where we crossed, but we did not dis-
turb them. After crossing the creek, we took a due
north course, over very rugged quartz ranges of an
auriferous character. Pieces of iron ore, very rich,
were scattered in great numbers over some of the
hills. On our being about to cross one of the
branch creeks in the low range, we surprised
gome blacks ?a man, who, with a young fellow
apparently his son, was upon a tree cutting out
something, and a luora with a piccaninny. The
two former did not see me until I was nearly
close to them, and then they were dreadfullv
frightened. Jumping down from the trees, they
started off shouting what sounded to us very like
? Joe, joe.? Thus disturbed, the lubra,
who was some distance from them, just
then caught sight of the camels and the
remainder of the party as they came over the hill
into the creek, and this tended to hasten their
flight over the stones and porcupine grass. Cross-
ing the range at the head of this creek, we came
on a gully running north, down which we pro-
ceeded, and soon found it open out into a creek
at two or three points, in which we found water.
On this creek we found the first specimen of an
eucalyptus, which has a very different appearance
from the members of the gum tree race ; it grows
as high as-a good-sized gum tree, but with the
branches less spreading; in shape it much re-
sembles the elm, the foliage is dark like that of
the lightwood, the trunk and branches are co-
vered with a grey bark, resembling in outward
appearance that of the box tree. Finding that
the creek was trending too much to the eastward,
we struck off to the north again, and at a short
distance came on a fine creek running about
south-south-east. As it was now about time to
camp, we travelled it up for about one and a half
miles, and came to a fine waterhole in a rocky
basin, at which there were lots of birds.

Sunday, 27th January, 1861.?Started from
camp CY., 5 min. past 2 in the morning ; we
followed along the bends of the creek by moon-
light, and found the creek wind about very
much, taking on the whole a north-east course.
At about 5 miles it changedsomewhat its features ?
from a broad and sandy channel?winding about
through gum tree flats, it assumes the unpro-
pitious appearance of a straight narrow creek
running in a north north east direction be-
tween high perpendicular earthy banks.
After running between 3 or 4 miles in this
manner, it took a turn to the west, at which
point there is a, fine water hole, and then assumed
its original character. Below this we found water
at several places, but it all seemed to be either
from surface drainage or from springs in the sand.
The land in the vicinity of the creek appears to
have received plenty of rain, the vegetation every-
where green and fresh, but there is no appearance
of the creek having flowed in this part of the
channel for a considerable period. Palm trees
are numerous, and some bear an abundance of
small round dates (nuts) just ripening. These
palms give a most picturesque and pleasant ap-
pearance to the creek.
Wednesday, 30ch January, 1861. ?Started at
half-past seven a.m. After several unsuccessful
attempts at getting Golah out of the bed of the
creek, it was determined to try bringing him
down until we could find a place for him to get
out at; but after going in this way two or three
miles, it was found necessary to leave him
behind, as it was almost impossible to get him
through some of the waterholes, and had separated
King from the party, which became a matter for
very serious consideration, when we found blacks
hiding in the box trees close to us.

Sunday, February 1861.?Finding the ground
in such a state from the heavy falls of
rain, that the camels could scarcely be got
along, it was decided to leave them at
Camp CXIX., and for Mr Burke and I to proceed
towards the sea on foot. After breakfast we
accordingly started, taking with us the horse and
three days? provisions. Our first difficulty was
in crossing Billy?s Creek, which we had to do
where it enters the river, a few hundred yards
below the camp. In getting the horse in here, he
got bogged in a quicksand bank so deeply, as to
be unable to stir, and we only succeeded in
extricating him by undermining him on the
creek side, and then lunging him into the water.
Having got all the things in safety, we continued
down the river bank, which bent about from east


to west, but kept a general north course. A
great deal of the land was so soft and
rotten, that the horse with only a saddle
and about 25 pounds on his back, could scarcely
walk over it. At a distance of about five miles
we again had him bogged in crossing a small
creek, after which he seemed so weak that we
had great doubts about getting him on, We, how-
ever, found some better ground close to the water?s
edge where the sandstone rock runs out, and we
stuck to it as far as possible. Finding that the
river was bending about so much that we were
making very little progress in a northerly direc-
tion, we struck off due north, and soon
came on some table land where the soil
is shallow and gravelly, and clothed with box
and swamp gums. Patches of the land were very
boggy, but the main portion was sound enough
beyond this we came on an open plain covered
with water up to one?s ankles. The soil here was
a stiff clay, and the surface very uneven, so that
between the tufts of grass one was frequently
knee deep in water. The bottom, however, was
sound, and no fear of bogging. After floundering
through this for several miles, we came to a path
formed by the blacks, and there were distinct
signs of a recent migration in a southerly direc-
tion. By making use of this path we got on much
better, for the ground was well trodden and hard.
At rather more than a mile the path
entered a forest, through which flowed a nice
water course, and we had not gone far before we
found places where the blacks had been camping.
The forest was intersected by little pebbly rises
on which the} had made their fires, and in the
sandy ground adjoining some of the former had
been digging yams*, which seemed to be so
numerous that they could afford to leave lots of
them about, probably having only selected the
very best. We were not so particular, but ate
many of those that they had rejected and found
them vsry good. About half a mile further we
came close on a blackfellow, who was coil-
ing by a camp fire, whilst his gin and
picanmny, were yabbering alongside. We stopped
for a short time to take out some of the pistols that
were on the horse, and that they might see us be-
fore we were so near as to frighten them. Just
after we stopped the black got up to stretch his
limbs, and after a few seconds looked in our direc-
tion. It was very amusing to see the way in
which he stared, standing for some time as if he
thought he must be dreaming, and then having
signalled to the others they dropped on their
haunches and shuffled off in the quietest manner
possible. Near their fire was a fine hut, the best I
have ever seen, built on the same principle as those
at Cooper?s Creek, but much larger and morecom-
plete. I should say a dozen blacks might com-
fortably coil in it together. It is situated at the
end of the forest, towards the north, and looks
out on an extensive marsh, which is at times
flooded by the sea-water. Hundreds of wild
geese, plover, and pelicans, were enjoying them-
selves in the water-courses on the marsh, all the
water on which was too brackish to be drinkable,
except some holes that are filled by the stream
that flows through the forest. The neighborhood
of this encampment is * one of the prettiest
we have seen during the journey. Proceeding on
our course across the marsh, we came to a chan-

nel through which the sea water enters. Here
we passed three blacks, who, as is universally
their custom, pointed out to us, unasked, the
best part down. This assisted us greatly, for the
ground we were taking was very boggy. We
moved slowly down, about three miles, and then
camped for the night. The horse Billy being com-
pletely baked, next morning we started at day
break, leaving the horse short hobbled.

Between four and five o?clock a heavy thunder-
storm broke over us, having given very little
warning of its approach. There had been light-
ning and thunder towards S.E. and S. ever since
noon yesterday. The rain was incessant and very
heavy for an hour and a half, which made the
ground so boggy that the animals could scarcely
walk over it. We nevertheless started at ten
minutes to seven a.m., and after floundering along
for half an hour, halted for breakfast. We then
moved on again, but soon found that the travel-
ling was too heavy for the camels, so camped for
the remainder of the day. In the afternoon the
sky cleared a little, and the sun soon dried the
ground, considering. Shot a pheasant, and much
disappointed at finding him all feathers and
claws. This bird nearly resembles a cock phea-
sant in plumage ; but in other respects it bears
more the character of the magpie or crow ; the
feathers are remarkably wiry and coarse.
Friday,22ndFebruary, 1861. ?CampYll, R. A
fearful thunderstorm in the evening, about eight
p.m., E.S.E., moving gradually round to S. The
flashes of lightning were so vivid and incessant as
to keep up a continual light for short intervals, over-
powering even the moonlight. Heavy rain and strong
squalls continued for more than an hour, when
the storm moved off W.N.W.; the sky remained
more or less overcast for the rest of the night, and
the following morning was both sultry and op-
pressive, with the ground so boggy as to be almost
impassable.
Saturday, 23rdFebuary, 1861.?Camp VIII, R.
In spite of the diffiulties thrown in our way by
last night?s storm, we crossed the creek. We
were shortly afterwards compelled to halt for the
day, on a small patch of comparatively dry ground
near the river. The day turned out very fine, so
that the soil dried rapidly; and we started in the
evening to try a trip by moonlight. We were very
fortunate in finding sound ground along a brllibong,
which permitted of our travelling for about five
miles up the creek, when we camped for the night.
The evening was most oppressively hot and sultry


?so much so, that the slightest exertion made one
feel as if he were in a state of suffocation. The
dampness of the atmosphere prevented any eva-
poration, and gave one a helpless feeling of lassi-
tude that I have never before experienced to such
an extent. All the party complained of the same
sensations, and the horses showed distinctly the
effect of the evening trip, short as it was. We
had scarcely turned in half an hour when it began
to rain, some heavy clouds having come up from
the eastward, in place of the layer of small cirro
cumuli that before ornamented the greater portion
of the sky. These clouds soon moved on, and we
were relieved from the dread of additional mud.
After the sky cleared, the atmosphere became
rather cooler and less sultry; so that, with the
assistance of a little smoke to keep the mosquitoes
off, we managed to pass a tolerable night.
Sunday, February 24,1861. ?Camp IX, R. Com-
paratively little rain has fallen above the branch
creek with the running water. The vegetation,
although tolerably fresh, is not so rank as that
we have left. The water in the creek is muddy
but good, and has been derived merely from the
surface drainage of the adjoining plains, The
Melaleneus continues in this branch creek, which
creeps along the foot of the ranges.
Monday, February 25, 1861.?CampX,R. There
has been very little rain on this portion of the
creek since we passed down. There was, how-
ever, no water at all then, at this point. At the
Tea Tree Spring, a short distance up the creek,
we found plenty of water in the sand, but it had
a disagreeable taste from the decomposition of
leaves and the presence of mineral matter, ?pro-
bably iron. There seems to have been a fair share
of rain along here, everything is so very fresh and
green ; and there is water in many of the channels
we have [crossed.]

bably at finding himself left behind, and he has
been walking up and down the tracks till he has
made a regular pathway. Could find no sign of
his having been far off it, although there is
splendid feed, to which he could have gone. He
began to eat as soon is he saw the other camels.
Sunday, 3rd March, 1861.?Eureka Camp, XV,
R. In crossing a creek by moonlight Charley
rode over a large snake. He did not touch
him, and we thought it was a log until he struck
it with the stirrup-iron. We then saw that it
was an immense snake, larger than any that I have
ever before seen in a wild state. It measured 8
feet 4 inches in length, and 7 inches in girth
round the belly. It was nearly the same thick-
ness horn the head to within 20 inches of the tail,
it then tapered rapidly. The weight was 11J lb.
From the tip of the nose to five inches back the
neck was black, both above and behind ; through-
out the rest of the body the under part was
yellow, and the sides and back had irregular
brown transverse bars on a yellowish brown
ground. I could detect no poisonous fangs, but
there were two distinct rows of teeth in each
jaw, and two small claws or nails, about
three-eighths of an inch long, one on each side of
the vent.
Monday, 4th March, 1861.?Feasting Camp,
XYI, R. Shortly after arriving at Camp XVI we
could frequently hear distant thunder towards the
east from which quarter the wind was blowing. D ur-
ing the afternoon there were frequent heavy
showers, and towards evening it set in to rain
steadily, but lightly. This lasted until about 8
p.m , when the rain ceased, and the wind got
round to W. ; the sky, however, remained over-
cast until late in the night, and then cleared for a
short time ; the clouds were soon succeeded by a
dense fog, or mist, which continued until morn-
ing. The vapor having then risen occupied the
upper air in the form of light cir-stratus and
cumuli clouds.
Tuesday, sth March, 1861,?Camp XVII, R.
Started at 2 am. on a S.S.W. course, but had
soon to turn in on the creek, as Mr Burke felt
very unwell, having been attacked by dysentery
since eating the snake. He now felt giddy, and
unable to keep his seat. At 6 a.m., Mr Burke
feeling better, we started again, following along
the creek, in which there was considerably more
water than when we passed down. We camped
at 2.15 p.m., at a part of the creek where the date
trees * were very numerous, and found the fruit
nearly ripe, and very much improved on what it
was when we were here before.
Wednesday, 6 th March, 1861.?Camp XVIII, R.
Arrived at the former camp, and find the feed
richer than ever, and the ants just as trouble-
some. Mr Burke is a little better, and Charley
looks comparatively well. The dryness of the
atmosphere seems to have a beneficial effect on
all. We found, yesterday, that it was a hopeless
matter about Golah, and we were ooliged to leave
him behind, as he seemed to be completely done
up, and could not come on, even when the pack
and saddle were taken off.

There is less water here than there was when we
passed down, although there is evidence of the
creek having been visited by considerable floods
during the interval. Feed is abundant, and the
vegetation more fresh than before. Mr Burke
almost recovered, but Charley is again very
unwell, and unfit to do anything. He caught
cold last night through carelessness in covering
himself.

?Eain ail day, so heavily that I wis obliged to
put my watch and field -book in the pack, to keep
them dry. In the afternoon the rain increased,
and all the creeks became flooded. We took
shelter under some fallen rocks, near which was
some feed for the camels, but the latter was of no
value, for we had soon to remove them up amongst
the rocks, out of the way of the flood, which for-
tunately did not rise high enough to drive us out
of the cave; but we were obliged to shift our
packs to the upper part. In the evening the
water fell as rapidly as it had risen, leaving every-
thing in a very boggy state. There were frequent
light showers during the night.
Thursday, 14th March, 1861.?Camp XXVI, E.
Sandstone Cave. The water in the creek having
fallen sufficiently low, we crossed over from the
cave, and proceeded down the creek. Our pro-
gress was slow, as it was necessary to keep on the
stoney ridge instead of following the flats, the
latter being very boggy after the rain. Thinking
that the creek must join Scratchley?s near o'ur old
camp, we followed it a long way, until, finding
it trend altogether too much eastward, we tried to
shape across for the other, creek, but were unable
to do so from the boggy nature of the intervening
plain.

clouded about nine p m., and a shower came
down from the north. At ten o?clock it became
so dark that we camped on the bank of the creek,
in which was a nice current of clear water. To-
day we halted, intending to try a night journey.
The packs we overhauled, and left nearly 601b
weight of things behind. They were all sus-
pended in a pack from the branches of a shrub
close to the creek. We started at a quarter to
six, but were continually pulled up by billibongs
and branch creeks, and soon had to camp for the
night. At the junction of the two creeks just
above [are] the three cones, which are three re-
markable small hills to the eastward.
Thursday, March 21st, 1861, ?Humid Camp,
XXXIII, R. Unable to proceed on account of
the slippery and boggy state of the ground. The
rain has fallen very heavily here to-day, and
every little depression in the ground is either full
of water or covered with slimy mud. Another
heavy storm passed over during the night, almost
[extinguishing] the miserable fi v e we were able
to get up with our very limited quantity of
water-logged and green wood. Having been
so unfortunate last night, we took an early
breakfast this morning at ?Camp XXXIII, which
I have named the Humid Camp, from the state
of dampness in which we found every thing there,
and crossing to the east bank of the main creek,
proceeded in a southerly direction nearly parallel
with the creek. Some of the flats near the creek
contain the richest alluvial soil, and are clothed
with luxuriant vegetation. There is an immense
extent of plain back, of the finest character for
pastoral purposes, and the country bears every
appearance of being permanently well watered.
We halted on a large billibong at noon, and were
favored during dinner by a thunderstorm, the
heavier portion of which missed us, some passing
north and some south, which was fortunate, as it
would otherwise have spoiled our baking process,
a matter of some importance just now. We started
again at seven o'clock, but the effects of the heavy
rain prevented our making a good journey;
Friday, March 22,1861. ?Muddy Camp, XXXIV,
R. Had an early breakfast this morning, and
started before sunrise. Found that the wet
swampy ground that checked our progress last
night was only a narrow strip, and that had we
gone a little further we might have made a fine
journey. The country consisted of open, v ell-
grassed, pebbly plains, intersected by numerous
small channels, all containing water. Abun lance
of fine rich porlulaca was just bursting into flower
along all these channels, as well as on the greater
portion of the plain. The creek that we camped
on last night ran nearly parallel with us through-
out this stage. We should have crossed it to
avoid the stoney plains, but were prevented by
the flood from so doing.
Saturday, 23rd March, 1861.?Mosquito Camp,
XXXV, R. Started at a quarter to six, and followed
down the creek, which has much of the charac-
teristic appearance of the River Burke, where we
crossed it on our up journey. The land in the
vicinity greatly improves as one goes down, be-
coming less stoney and better grassed. At eleven
o?clock we crossed a small tributary from the
eastward, and there was a distant range of consi-
derable extent visible in that direction. Halted
for the afternoon in a bend, where there was tole-
rable feed, for the banks are everywhere more or
ess scrubby.
Sunday, 24th March, 1861, ?Three-hour Camp,

Monday, 25th March, 1861.?Native Dog
Camp, XXVII. R. Started at half-past five, look-
ing for a good place to halt for the day. This we
found at a short distance down the creek,
and immediately discovered that it was
close to Camp LXXXIX of our up jour-
ney. Had not expected that we were so
much to the westward. After breakfast,
took some time altitudes, and was about to go
back to last camp for some things that had been
left, when I found Grey behind a tree, eating skil-
ligolee. He explained that he was suffering from
dysentery, and had taken the flour without leave.
Sent him to report himself to Mr Burke, and went
on. He, having got King to tell Mr Burke for
him, was called up, and received a good thrash-
ing. There is no knowing to what extent he has
been robbing us. Many things have been
found to run unaccountably short. Started
at seven o?clock, the camels is first-rate spirits.
We followed our old course back (S.)
The first portion of the plains had much the
same appearance as when we cams up, but
that near camp LXXXVIII, which then
looked so fresh and green, is now very much
dried up, and we saw no signs of water
anywhere. In fact there seems to have been little


or no rain about here since we passed. Soon Monday, April 8, 1861, Camp L, R.? Camped a
after three o?clock we struck the first of several short distance above CampLXXV. The creek
small creeks or billibongs, which must be por-
tions of the creek with the deep channel that we
crossed on going up, we being now rather to the
westward of our former course. From here, after
traversing about two miles of the barest clay
plain, devoid of all vegetation, we reached a small
watercourse, most of the holes in which con-
tained some water of a milky or creamy description.
Fine saltbush and portulac being abundant in the
vicinity, we camped here at 4.30 am. When we
started in the evening, a strong breeze had already
sprung up in the south, which conveyed much
of the characteristic feeling of a hot wind. It in-
creased gradually to a force of five and six, but by
eleven o?clock had become decidedly cool, and
was so chilly towards morning that we found it
necessary to throw on our ponchos. A few cir.
cum. clouds were coming up from the east when
we started, but we left them behind, and nothing
was visible during the night but a thin hazy veil.
The gale continued throughout the 26th, becom-
ing warmer as the day advanced. In the after-
noon it blew furiously, raising a good deal of dust.
The temperature of air at 4 p.m. was 94 degrees

on the stoney pavement. The neighboring country
chiefly composed of stoney rises and sand ridges.

Saturday, 6th April, 1861.?Wild Duck Camp
XLYIII, R. Earthy flats, cut into innumerable
watercourses, [succeeded by] fine open plains,
generally very bare, but having in some places
patches of fine salt bush. The de d stalks of
portulac and mallows, show that those plants are
very plentiful in some seasons. [Toward * noon
came upon] earthy plains and numerous billi-
bongs.
Sunday, 7th April, 1861.?Camp XLIX, R.
Find the water and feed much dried up. JN early
all the water we have met with has a slightly
brackish taste of a peculiar kind, somewhat re-
sembling in flavor potassio tartrate of soda.
here contains more water, and there is a consi-
derable quantity of green grass in its bed, but
it is much dried up since we passed before.
Halted 15 minutes to send back for Gray, who
gammoned he could not walk. Some good
showers must have fallen lately, as we have passed
surface water on the plains every day. In the
latter portion of to day?s journey the young grass
and portulac are springing freshly in the flats and
on the sides of the sand ridges.
Tuesday, 9th April, 1861, Camp LI, R. ?
Camped on the bank of the creek, where there is
a regular field of salt bush, as well as some grass
in its bed, very acceptable to the horse, who has
not had a proper feed for the last week until last
night, and is, consequently, nearly knocked up.
Wednesday, April 10,1861. ?Camp LII, R. Re-
mained at Camp LII, R, all day to out up and jerk
the meat of the horse Lilly, who was so reduced
and knocked up for want of food, that there ap-
peared little chance of his reaching the other side
of the desert; and as we were running short of
food of every description ourselves, we thought it
best to secure his flesh at once. We found it
healthy and tender, but without the slightest
trace of fat in any portion of the body.
Thursday, April 11, 1861.?Plenty of water in
creek down to this point.
Priday, April 12, 1861. Extensive earthy
plains, intersected by numerous water courses.
Saturday, April 13, 1861.?Small water courses
lined with lakes. Plenty of salt bush and chry-
santhemums on either side. Camped on Stone y
Desert.
[Note by Transcriber. ?Up to this point, as
it appears from Mr Wills? fieldbook, the Expedi-
tion never passed a day in which they did not
traverse the banks of, or cross, a creek or other
watercourse.]
Sunday, April 14, 1861.
Monday, April 15, 1861.?1t commenced to
rain lightly at five a.m. this morning, and con-
tinued raining pretty steadily throughout the
day. Owing to the wet and the exertion
of crossing the numerous sand ridges, Linda
became knocked up about four o?clock,
and we had to halt at a claypan
amongst the sand hills. [The party seems to have
crossed a creek near a native camp, about 10 a.m.]
Tuesday, 16ch April, 1861.
Wednesday, 17th April, 1861.?This morning,
about sunrise, Gray died. He had not spoken a
word distinctly since his first attack, which was
just as we were about to start.
Thursday, April 18, 1861.?[Another creek and
native camp were passed.]
Friday, April 19, 1861.?Camped again without
water on the sandy bed of the creek, having been
followed by a lot of natives who were desirous of
our company ; but as we preferred camping alone,
we were compelled to move on until rather late, in
order to get away from them. The night was
very cold. A strong breeze was blowing from
the south, which made the fire so irregular that,
as on the two previous nights, it was impossible
to keep up a fair temperature. Our general
course throughout the day had been S.S.E.
Saturday, April 20, 1861.
Sunday, 21st April, 1861.?Arrived at the depot
this evening just in time to find it deserted. A
note left in the plant by Brahe communicates the


pleasing information that they have started to- 18th. The same. 67. ~ .
day for the Darling; their camels and horses all 19th. We made a (?) shall creek, supposed to
well and in good condition ; we and our camels be OttaEra (?), or in the immediate neighborhood
being just done up, and scarcely able to reachthe
depot, have very little chance of overtaking them.
Brahe has fortunately left us ample provisions to
take us to the bounds of civilisation, namely :
Flour, 50 lb ; rice, 20 lb ; oatmeal, 60 lb ; sugar,
60 lb ; and dried meat, 15 lb. These provisions,
together with a few horse-shoes and nails, and some
castaway odds and ends, constitute all the articles ?
left, and place us in a very awkward position in
respect to clothing. Our disappointment at find-
ing the depot deserted may easily be imagined ;
?returning in an exhausted state, after four
months? of the severest travelling and pri-
vation, our legs almost paralysed so that
each of ua found it a most trying task
only to walk a few yards. Such a leg-bound
feeling I never before experienced, and hope I
never shall again. The exertion required to get
up a slight piece of rising ground even without
any load, induces an indescribable sensation ot
pain and helplessness, and the general lassitude
makes one unfit for anything. Poor Gray must
have suffered very much, many times when we
thought him shamming. It is most fortunate for
us that these symptoms which so early
affected him, did not come on us until
we were reduced to an exclusively animal
diet of such an inferior description as that offered
by the flesh of a worn out and exhausted horse.
We were not long in getting out the grub that
Brahe had left, and we made a good supper off
some oatmeal porridge and sugar. This, together
with the excitement of finding ourselves in such
a peculiar and almost unexpected position, had a
wonderful effect in removing the stiffness from
our legs. Whether it is possible that the vege-
tables can so have affected us, I know not; but
both Mr B. and I remarked a most decided relief
and a strength in the legs greater than we had
had for several days. lam inclined to think that
but for the abundance of portulac that we obtained
on the journey, we should scarcely have returned
to Cooper?s Creek at [all.]
burke?s notes op the expedition.
These notes were often illegible, and in many
places the pages of the book had been ripped and
cut out. The book was evidently kept for rough
memoranda: ?
The following extracts are from the memoran-
dum book of Mr Burke. Mr Archer, to whom
the task of transcribing it was entrusted, writes
the following preface :??I went carefully through
Burke?s note book last night. It is an ordinary
memorandum book, with a clasp, and a side pocket
for a pencil. It is much dilapidated, and several
of the leaves are torn out. Some so torn had been
written on. I have numbered these consecutively
throughout. The following is a copy, letter for
letter, and word for word, of all that remains of
Burke?s pencillings. I have queried all doubt-
ful points.?

20 th. Made a creek where we found a great
many natives ?they presented us with fish and
offered their women. Camp 70.
21st. Made another creek, camp 71. Splendid
water, fine feed tor the camels ; would be a very
good place for a station. Since we have left
Cooper?s Creek we have travelled over a very fine
sheep grazing country, well watered, and in every
respect well suited for occupation.
22nd December, 1860. Camp 72. Encamped
on the borders of the desert.
23rd. Travelled day and night, and encamped
in the night in the bed of a creek, as we supposed
we were near water.
24th. Encamped on the morning of this day on
the banks of Gray?s Creek, called after him be-
cause he was detached on horseback from the
party, and found it good water. The
third day without it. Now for a retrospec-
tive glance. We started from Cooper?s Creek,
Camp 66, with the intention of going through to
Eyre?s Creek without water. Loaded with
800 pints of water, four riding camels carried 130
pints, each horse 150, two pack camels 50 each,
and 5 pints each man.
25th Christmas Day.?Started at four a.m.
from Gray?s Creek, and arrived at a creek which
appears to be quite as large as Cooper?s Creek.
At two p.m. Golah-Sing gave some very decided
hints about stopping by lying down under the
trees ; splendid prospect.
26th Dec., 27th Dec., 28th Dec., 29th Dec.,
followed up the creek until it took a turn to the
south-east, which I thought rather too much to
put up with, therefore left it on the morning of
the 30thDecember, 12.30, on the road?started at
seven o?clock, travelled eleven hours. 31st,
started at 2.20 sixteen and a-half hours on the
road, travelled thirteen and a half hours.

2nd January from King?s Creek, eleven hours
on the road. Started at seven, travelled nine
and a half hours; desert.
3rd January, five started, travelled twelve
hours no minutes.
4th ?Twelve hours on the road.
5th ?Water at Wills? or King?s Creek. It is
impossible to say the time we were up, for we had
to load the camels, to pack and feed them, to
watch them and the horse, and to look for water,
but I am satisfied that the frame of man never
was more severely taxed. Here follows an entry
for March2Bth, commencing thus, ?March 28th

appear to have been torn out from pages forty-
three to fifty-five.
13th January, 1861.?As I find it impossible to
keep a regular diary, I shall jot down my ideas
when I have an opportunity and put the date.
Upon two occasions, at Cooper?s Creek and at
King?s Creek, on New Year?s Day, whenever the
natives tried to bully or bounce us and were re-
pulsed, although the leaders appeared to be in
earnest, the followers and particularly the young
ones laughed heartily and seemed to be amused
at their leaders? repulse. The old fellow at King?s

18th January.?Still on the ranges, the camels
sweating profusely from fear.
20th January.? I determined to-day to go
straight at the ranges, and so far the experiment
has succeeded well. The poor camels sweating
and groaning, but we gave them a hot bath in
Turner?s Creek, which, seemed to relieve them
very much. At last through?the camels bleed-
ing, sweating, and groaning. (Leaves 35 to 39

28th March.?At the conclusion of report, it
would be well to say that we reached the sea, but
we could not obtain a view of the open ocean,
although we made every endeavor to do so.
Leaving Carpentaria ?Flour, 83 lb ; pork, 3 lb;
D. meat, 351b ; biscuits, 121b ; rice, 121b ; sugar,
10 lb. (Page 15 blank).? Return party from Car-
pentaria arrived here last night, and found that the
D. party had started on the same day. We proceed
slowly down the creek towards Adela.de by
Mount Hopeless, and shall endeavor to follow
Gregory?s track, but we are very weak, the camels
are done up, and we shall not be able to travel
faster than five miles a day at most. Gray died
on the road from hunger and fatigue. We all
suffered much from hunger, but the provisions
left here will, I think, restore our strength. We
have discovered a practicable route to Carpentaria,
the principal portion of which lies in the 140 th
meridian of east longitude. Between this and
the Stoney Desert there is some good country from
there to the tropic. The country is dry and
stoney between the tropic and Carpentaria. A
considerable portion is rangy, but it is well
watered and richly grassed.

JOURNAL OF TRIP FROM COOPER?S CREEK
TOWARDS ADELAIDE, APRIL, 1861.
(Transcribed by Mr. Archer.)
The advance party of the Victorian Exploring
Expedition, consisting of Burke, Wills, and King
(Gray being dead), having returned from Carpen-
taria on the 21st April in an exhausted and weak
state, and finding that tne depot party left at
Cooper?s Creek had started for the Darling, with
their horses and camels fresh and in good condi-
tion, deemed it useless to attempt to overtake
them, having only two camels, both done up, and
being so weak themselves as to be unable to walk
more than four or five miles a day; finding also
that the provisions left at the depot for them
would scarcely take them to Menindie, started
down Cooper?s Creek for Adelaide via Mount
Hopeless, on the morning of the 23rd April, in-
tending to follow as nearly as possible the route
taken by Gregory ; by so doing they hope to be
able to recruit themselves and the camels, whilst
sauntering slowly down the creek, and to have
sufficient provisions left to take them comfortably
or at least without risk, to some station in South
Australia. Their equipment consists of the fol-
lowing articles: ?Flour, 60 lb; lb ; rice,
20 lb ; oatmeal, 60 lb; jerked meat, 25 lb; ginger,
2 lb ; salt, 1 lb.
(Then follow some native words, with their
meanings.)
Tuesday, 23rd April.?From Depot.?Having
collected together all the odds and ends that
seemed likely to be of use to us, in addition
to provisions left in the plant, we started at a
quarter past nine a.m., keeping down the southern
bank of the creek. We only went about five
miles, and camped at half-past eleven on a bilii-
bong, where the feed was pretty good. We find
the change of diet already making a great improve-
ment in our spirits and strength. The weather is
delightful, days agreeably warm, _ but the nights
very chilly. The latter is more noticeable from our
deficiency m clothing, the depot party having taken
all the reserve things back with them to the Dar-
ling. To Camp I.
Wednesday, 24th April.?From Camp I.? A.s
we were about to start this morning, some blacks
came by, from whom we were fortunate enough to
get about twelve pounds of fish for a few pieces of
straps and some matches, &c. This is a great treat
for us, as well as a valuable addition to our ra-
tions. We started at a quarter past eight p.m.,
on our way down the creek, the blacks going in
the opposite direction, little thinking that in a few
miles they would be able to get los of pieces for
nothing, better than those they had obtained from
us. To Camp 11.
Thursday, 25th April ?From Camp ll.
Awoke at five o?clock, after a most refreshing
night?s rest. The sky was beautifully clear and
the air rather chilly. The terrestrial radiation
seems to have been considerable, and a slight dew
had fallen. We had scarcely finished breakfast
when our friends the blacks, from whom we ob-
tained the fish, made their appearance with a few
more, and seemed inclined to go with us and keep
up the supply. We gave them some sugar, with
which they were greatly pleased. They are by
far the most well behaved blacks we have seen on
Cooper?s Creek. We did not get away from the
camp until half-past nine a.m., continuing our
course down the most southern branch of the
creek, which keeps a general S.W. course. We
passed across the stoney point which abuts on one
of the largest waterholes in the creek, and camped
at half-past twelve about a mile below the most
dangerous part of the rocky path. At this latter
place we had an accident that might have resulted
badly for us. One of the camels fell while cross-
ing the worst part, but we fortunately got him out
with only a few cuts and bruises. The water-
hole at this camp is a very fine one,
being (to Camp III) several miles long,
and on an average about chains broad.
The waterfowl are numerous, but rather
shy not nearly so much so, however, as
those on the creeks between here and Carpen-
taria, and I am convinced that the shyness oi the
latter, which was also remarked by Sturt on his
trip to Eyre?s Creek, arises entirely from the
scarcity of animals, both human and otherwise,
and not from any peculiar mode of catching them
that the blacks may have. ,
Friday, 26th April.? From Camp 111. Last
night was beautifully calm, and comparatively
warm, although the sky was very clear. Re-
ceded the camels by moonlight this morning, and
started at a quarter to six. Striking ofl to the
south of the creek, we soon got on a native path,
which leaves the creek just below the stoney
? ground, and takes a course nearly west across a


piece of open country, bounded on the south by j
sand-ridges, and on the north by the scrubby j
ground which flanks the bank of the creek at j
this part of its course. Leaving the path on the I
right at a distance of three miles, we turned
up a small creek which passes down between
some sand-hills ; and finding a nice patch of feed
for the camels at a waterhole, we halted at fifteen
minutes past seven for breakfast. We started
again at fifty minutes past nine a.m. Continuing
our westerly course along the path, we crossed to
the S. of the watercourse above the water, and
proceeded over the most splendid saltbush country
that one could wish to see, bounded on the left
by sandhills, whilst to the right the peculiar look-
ing flat-topped sandstone ranges form an exten-
sive amphitheatre, through the far side of the
arena of which may be traced the dark line of
creek timber. At twelve o?clock we camped in
the bed of the creek, at Camp , our last camp
on the road down from the Gulf, having taken
fijur days to do what we then did in one. This
comparative rest, and the change in diet, have
also worked wonders, however ; the leg tied feel-
ing is no.w entirely gone, and I believe that in
less than a week we shall be fit to undergo any
fatigue The camels are improving, and
seem capable of doing all that we are likely to
require of them. To Camp IV.
Saturday, 27th April.?First part of night clear,
with a light breeze from S. Temperature at mid-
night, 10 deg. (Reaumur) ; towards morning there
were a few cir. cum. clouds passing over N.E. to
S.W., but these disappeared before daylight; at
five a.m. the temperature was 7'5 deg. (Reau-
mur). We started at six o?clock, and, following
the native path, which at about a mile from our
camp takes a southerly direction, we soon came
to the high sandy alluvial deposit, which sepa-
rates the creek at this point from the stoney rises.
Here we struck off from the path, keeping well
to the south of the creek, in order that we might
mess in a branch of it that took a southerly di-
rection. At twenty minutes past nine we came
in on the creek again where it runs due south,
and halted for breakfast at a fine waterhole, with
fine fresh feed for the camels. Here we remained
until noon, when we moved on again, and camped
at one o?clock on a general course; having been
throughout the morning S.W. eight miles. The
weather is most agreeable and pleasant; nothing
could be more favorable to us up to the present
time. The temperature in the shade at half-past
ten a.m. was 17*5 (Reaumur), with a light breeze
from south, and a few small cir. cum. clouds
towards the north. I greatly feel the want of
more instruments, the only things I have left
being my watch, prism compass, pocket compass,
and one thermometer (Reaumur). To Camp V.
Sunday, April 28.?From Camp V. Morning
fine and calm, but rather chilly. Started at a
quarter to five a.m., following down the bed of
a creek in a westerly direction, by moonlight.
Our stage was, however, very short, for about a
mile one of the camels (Linda) got bogged by the
side of a waterhole, and although we tried every
means in our pov'er, we found it impossible to
get him out. All the ground beneath the surface
was a bottomless quicksand, through which the
beast sank too rapidly for us to get bushes or
timber fairly beneath him, and being of a very
sluggish stupid nature, he could never be got to
make sufficiently strenuous efforts towards ex-
tricating himself. In the evening, as a last
chance, we let the water in from the creek, so as.
to buoy him up and at the same time soften the
ground about his legs, but it was of no avail
The brute lay quietly in it as if he quite enjoyed
his position. To Camp YI.
Monday, April 29.?From Camp YI. Finding
Linda still in the hole, we made a few attempts
at extricating him, and then shot him, and after
breakfast commenced cutting off what flesh we
could get at for jerking.
Tuesday, April 30.?Camp VI. Remained here
to-day for the purpose of drying the meat, for
which process the weather is not very favorable.
(Meteorological note follows.)
Wednesday, Ist May. From Camp VI.
Started at twenty minutes to nine, having loaded
our only camel, Rajah, with the most necessary
and useful articles, and packed up a small swag
each of bedding and clothing for our own shoul-
ders. We kept on the right bank of the creek
for about a mile, and then crossed over at a native
camp to the left, where we got on a path running
due west, the creek having turned to the N.
Following the path, we crossed an open plain,
and then sand-ridges, whence we saw the creek
straight ahead of us, running nearly S. again.
The path took us to the southernmost point of
the bend, in a distance of about two and a half
miles from where we had crossed the creek,
thereby saving us from three to four miles, as it
cannot be less than six miles round by the creek.
To Camp VII.
Thursday, 2nd May.?Camp VII. Breakfasted
by moonlight, and started at half-past six.
Following down the left bank of the creek in
a westerly direction, we came, at a dis -
tanoe of six miles, on a lot of natives, who were
camped on the bed of a creek. They seemed
to have just breakfasted, and were most liberal in
the presentations of fish and cake. "We could only
return the compliment by some fish-hooks and
sugar. About a mile further on we came to a
separation of the creek, where what looked like
the main branch looked towards the south. This
channel we followed, not, however, without some
misgivings as to its character, which were soon in-
creased by the small and unfavorable appearance
that the creek assumed. On our continuing along
it a little further it began to improve, and
widened out with fine waterholes of considerable
depth, The banks were very steep, and a belt of
scrub lined it on either side. This made it very
inconvenient for travelling, especially as the bed
of the creek was full of water for a considerable
distance. At eleven a,m. we halted until half-
past one p.m., and then moved on again, taking a
S.S.W. course for about two miles, when, at the
end of a very long waterhole it breaks into billi-
bongs, which continue splitting into sandy chan-
nels until they are all lost in the earthy soil of a
box forest. Seeing little chance of water ahead,
we turned back to the end of the long waterhole,
and camped for the night. On our way back
Rajah showed signs of being done up. He had
been trembling greatly all the morning. On this
account his load was further lightened to the
amount of a few pounds, by doing away with the
sugar, ginger, tea, cocoa, and two or three tin
plates. To camp No. VIII.
Friday, 3rd May.?Camp VIII. Started at
seven a.m., striking off in a northerly direction


for the main creek. At a mile and a half came to fish each for luncheon, and intimated that if we
a branch which (left unfinished.) To camp No. IX. would go to their camp we should have some
Saturday, 4th May.?Junction from Camp IX. more, and some bread. I tore in two a piece
Night and morning very cold. Sky clear, almost
calm; occasionally a light breath of air from
south. Rajah appears to feel the cold very much.
He was so stiff this morning as to be scarcely able
to get up with his load. Started to return down
the creek at 6.45, and halted for breakfast at nine
a.m., at the same spot as we breakfasted at yes-
terday. Proceeding from there down the creek,
we soon found a repetition of the features that
were exhibited by the creek examined on Thurs-
day. At a mile and a half we came to the last
waterhole, and below that the channel became
more sandy and shallow, and continued to send
off billibongs to the south and west, slightly
changing its course each time until it disappeared
altogether in a north-westerly direction. Leaving
King with the camel, we went on a mile or two
to see if we could find water, and oeing unsuc-
cessful, we were obliged to return to -where we
had breakfasted, as being the best place for feed
and water.
Sunday, sth May.?To Camp No. X. Started
by myself to reconnoitre the country in a
southerly direction, leaving Mr Burke and King
with the camel at Camp No. X. Travelled S.W.
by S. for two hours, following the course of the
most southerly billibongs. Found the earthy
soil becoming more loose and cracked up, and
the box-track gradually disappearing. Changed
course to west, for a high sand ridge, which I
reached in one hour and a h If, and continuing
in the same direction to one still higher, obtained
from it a good view of the surrounding country.
To the north were the extensive box forests
bounding the creek on either side. To the east
earthy plains intersected by water-courses and
lines of timber, and bounded in the distance by
sand ridges. To the south the projection of the
sand ridge partially intercepted the view, the rest
was composed of earthy plains, apparently
clothed with chrysanthemums. To the west-
ward, another but smaller plain was bounded
also by high sand ridges, running parallel with
the one on which I was standing. This dreary
prospect offering no encouragement for one to
proceed, I returned to Camp X, by a more direct
and better route than I had come, passing over
some good saltbush land which borders on the
billibongs to the westward. (Here follow some
meteorologicial notes.)
Monday, 6th May.?From Camp X. back to
Camp IX. Moved up the creek again to Camp
IX. at the junction, to breakfast, and remained
the day there. The present state of things is not
calculated to raise our spirits much. The rations
are rapidly diminishing ; our clothing, especially
the boots, are all going to pieces, and we have not
the materials for repairing them properly ; the
camel is completely done up, and can scarcely get
along, although he has the best of feed, and is rest-
ing half his time. I suppose this will end in our
having to live like the blacks for a few months.
Tuesday, 7th May.? Camp IX. Breakfasted at
daylight, but when about to start, found that the
camel would not rise, even without any load on
his back. After making every attempt to get
him up, we were obliged to leave him to himself.
Mr Burke and I started down the creek to recon-
noitre. At about eleven miles we came to some
blacks fishing They gave us some half a dozen
of macintosh stuff that I had, and Mr Burke
gave one piece, and I the other. We then
went on to their camp, about three miles further.
They had caught a considerable quantity of fish,
but most of them were small. I noticed three
different kinds?a small one that they call cupi,
five to six inches long, and not broader than an
eel; the common one, with large coarse scales,
termed peru ; and a delicious fish, some of which
run from a pound to two pounds weight. The
natives call them cawilchi. On our arrival at the
camp, they led us to a spot to camp on, and soon
afterwards brought a lot of fish and bread, which
they call nardoo. The lighting a fire with matches
delights them, but they do not care about hav-
ing them. In the evening various members
of the tribe came down with lumps of nardoo and
handfuls of fish, until we were positively unable
to eat any more They also gave us some stuff
they call bedgery, or pedgery. It has a highly
intoxicating effect when chewed even in small
quantities. It appears to be the dried stems and
leaves of some shrub.
Wednesday, Bth May,?Left the blacks? camp
at half-past seven, Mr Burke returning to the
junction, whilst I proceeded to trace down the
creek. This I found a shorter task than I had
expected, for it soon showed signs of running out,
and at the same kept considerably to the north of
west. There were several fine waterholes within
about four miles of the camp I bad left, but not a
drop all the way beyond that, a distance of seven
miles. Rinding that the creek turned greatly
towards the north, I returned to the blacks? en-
campment ; and, as I was about to pass, they in-
vited me to stay. So I did so, and was even more
hospitably entertained than before, being on this
occasion offered a share of a gunyah, and supplied
with plenty of fish and nardoo, as well as a couple
of nice fat rats. The latter found most delicious.
They were baked in the skins. Last night was
clear and calm, but unusually warm. We slept
by a fire, just in front of the blacks? camp. They
were very attentive in bringing us firewood, and
keeping fire up during the night.
Thursday, May 9.?Parted from my friends,
the blacks at half-past seven, and started for
camp IX.
Friday, May 10.?Camp IX.?Mr Burke & King
employed in jerking the camel?s flesh, whilst I
went out to look for the nardoo seed for making
bread. In this I was unsuccessful, not being able
to find a single tree of it in the neighborhood of
the camp. I however tried boiling the large kind
of bean which the blacks call padlu ; they boil
easily, and when shelled are very sweet, much
resembling in taste the French chesnut. They
are to be found in large quantities nearly every-
where.
Suturday, May 11.?Camp IX.?To-day Mr
Burke and King started down the creek for the
blacks? camp, determined to ascertain all parti-
culars about the nardoo seed. I have now my turn
at the meat jerking, and must devise some means
for trapping the birds and rats, which is a plea-
sant prospect after our dashing trip to Carpen-
taria, having to hang about Cooper?s Creek living
like the blacks.
Sunday, 12th May.?Mr Burke and King re-
turned this morning, having been unsuccessful


in their search for the blacks, who, it seems,
have moved over to the other branch of the creek.
Decided on moving out on the main creek to-
morrow, and then trying to find the natives of the
creek.
Monday, 13th May.?Shifted some of the things
and brought them back again, Mr Burke thinking
it better for one to remain here with them for a
few days, so as to eat the remains of the fresh
meat, whilst the others went in search of the blacks-
and nardoo.
Tuesday, 14th May.? Mr Burke and King gone
up the creek to look for blacks, with four days?
provisions. Self employed in preparing for a
final start on their return. This evening Mr
Burke and King returned, having been some
considerable distance up the creek, and found
no blacks. It is now settled that we plant the
things, and all start together the day after to-
morrow. The weather continues very fine ; the
nights calm, clear, and cold, and the days clear,
with a breeze generally from S., but to-day from
E., for a change. This makes the first part of
the day rather cold. When clouds appear they in-
variably move from W. to E.
Wednesday, 15th May.?Camp IX. Plant-
ing the things, and preparing to leave the creek
for Mount Hopeless.
Thursday, 16th May.?Having completed
our planting, &c., started up the creek to the
second blacks? camp, a distance of about eight
miles. Finding our loads rather too heavy, we
made a small plant here of such articles as could
best be spared. (Here follow a t few meteorologi-
cal notes.)
Friday, 17th May.? Nardoo.?Started this morn-
ing on a blacks? path, leaving the creek on our
left, our intention being to keep a south-easterly
direction until we should cut some likely-looking
creek, and then to follow it down. On approach-
ing the foot of the first sand-hill King caught
sight in the flat of some nardoo seeds, and we soon
found that the flat was covered with them. This
discovery caused somewhat of a revolution in our
feelings, for we considered that with' the know-
ledge of this plant we were in a position to support
ourselves, even if we were destined to remain on
the creek and wait for assistance from town.
Crossing some sand ridges running N. and S.,
we struck into a creek which runs out of Cooper?s
Creek, and followed it down. At about five miles
we came to a large waterhole, beyond which the
watercourse runs out on extensive fiats and
earthy plains. Calm night ; sky cleared towards
morning, and it became very cold. A slight east-
erly breeze sprang up at sun-rise, but soon died
away again. The sky again became overcast, and
remained so throughout the day. There was oc-
casionally a light breeze from south, but during
the greater portion of the day it was quite calm.
Fine halo around the sun in the afternoon.
Saturday, May 18. ?Camp XVI. (No entry
except the following meteorological entry on an
opposite page, which may probably refer to this
date.) Calm night, sky sometimes clear and
sometimes partially overcast with veil clouds.
Sunday, May 19. ?(Np entry beyond this cita-
tion of date.)
Monday, May 20.?(N0 entry beyond this cita-

this citation of date.)
Wednesday, May 23. ?Cooper?s Creek. (No

Thursday, May 23.?(N0 entry beyond this

Friday, 24th May.?Started with King to cele-
brate the Queen?s birthday by fetching from Nar-
doo Creek what is now to us the staff of life.
Returned at a little after two p.m., with a fair
supply, but find the collecting of the seed a
slower and more troublesome process than could
be desired. Whilst picking the seed, about eleven
o clock a.m., both of us heard distinctly the noise
of an explosion, as if of a gun, at some consider-
able distance. We supposed it to have been a shot
fired by Mr Burke; but on returning to the camp,
found that he had not fired nor heard the noise.
The sky was partially overcast with high cum. str.
clouds, and a light breeze blew from the east,
but nothing to indicate a thunderstorm in any di-
rection.
Saturday, 25th May.?(No entry beyond this.)
Sunday, 26th May.?(No entry beyond this.)
Monday, 27th May.?Started up the creek this
morning for the depot, in order to deposit jour-
nals and a record of the state of affairs here. On
reaching the sand hills below where Lands was
bogged, I passed some blacks on a flat collecting
nardoo seed. Never saw such an abundance of
the seed before. The ground in some parts was
quite black with it. There was only two or
three gins and children, and they directed me on,
as if to their camp, in the direction I was before
going; but I had not gone far over the first sand
hill when I was overtaken by about twenty
blacks, bent on taking me back to their camp,
and promising any quantity of nardoo and fish.
On my going with them, one carried the shovel,
and another insisted on taking my swag, in such
a friendly manner that I could not refuse them.
They were greatly amused with the various
little things I had with me. In the even-
ing they supplied me with abundance �f nardoo
and fish; and one of the old men, Poko Tinna-
mira, shared his gunyah with me. . . . The
night was very cold, but, by the help of several
fires ?[The entry suddenly stops, but in the
margin of the opposite page are written the names
of several natives, and certain native words, with
their meanings in English.]
Tuesday, 28th May.?Left the blacks? camp,
and proceeded up the creek. Obtained some
mussels near where Landa died, and halted for
breakfast. Still feel very unwell from the effects
of the constipation of the bowels. The stools
are exceedingly painful. After breakfast, tra-
velled on to our third camp coming down. Puy
to Blowr, (sic.)
Wednesday, 29th May.?Started at seven
o?clock, and went on to the duck-holes, where we
breakfasted coming down. Halted there at thirty
minutes past nine for a feed, and then moved on.
At the stones saw a lot of crows quarrelling about
something near the water. Found it to be a large
fish, of which they had eaten a considerable por-
tion. Finding it quite fresh and good, I decided
the quarrel by taking it with me. It proved a
most valuable addition to my otherwise scanty
supper of nardoo porridge. This evening I
camped very comfortably in a mia-mia, about
eleven miles from the depot The night was very
cold, although not entirely cloudless. A brisk
easterly breeze sprang up in the morning, and
blew freshly all day. In the evening the sky


clouded in, and there were one or two slight j around, but it turned out that they had already
showers, but nothing to wet the ground.
Thursday, 30th May.?Reached the depot this
morning, at eleven o?clock. No traces of any one
except blacks having been here since we left.
Deposited some journals, and a notice of our
present condition. Started back in the afternoon,
and camped at the first waterhole. Last night
being cloudy, was unusually warm and pleasant,
Friday, 31st May.? Decamped at thirty
minub s past seven, having first breakfasted.
Passed between the sand hills at nine, and
reached the blanket mia-raias at twenty minutes
to eleven ; from there proceeded on to the rocks,
where I arrived at half-past one, having delayed
about half-an-hour on the road in gathering some
portulac. It had been a fine morning, but the
sky now became overcast, and threatened to set
in for a steady rain ; and as I felt very weak and
tired I only moved on about a mile further, and
camped in a sheltered gully, under some bushes.
Night clear and very cold. No wind. Towards
morning sky became slightly overcast with cirro
str. clouds.
Saturday, Ist June. ?Started at a quarter to
eight a.m. Passed the duck-holes at ten a.m.,
and my second camp up at two p.m., having
rested in the meantime about forty-five minutes.
Thought to have reached the blacks? camp, or at
least where Landa was bogged, but found myself
altogether too weak and exhausted ; in fact, had
extreme difficulty in getting across the numerous
little gullies, and was at last obliged to camp from
sheer fatigue. Night ultimately clear and cloudy,
with occasional showers.
Sunday, 2nd June.?Started at half-past six,
thinking to breakfast at the blacks? camp, below
Landa?s grave; found myself very much fagged,
and did not arrive at their camp until ten a.m.,
and then found myself disappointed as to a good
breakfast, the camp being deserted. Having
rested awhile, and eaten a few fish-bones, I
moved down the creek, hoping by a late march to
be able to reach our own camp, but I soon found,
from my extreme weakness, that that would be
out of the question. A certain amount of good
luck, however, still stuck to me, for, on going
along by a large waterhole, I was so fortunate as
to find a large fish, about a pound and a-half in
weight, which was just being choked by anothe
which it had tried to swallow, but which ha
stuck in its throat. I soon had a fire lit, and both
of the fish cooked and eaten. The large one wa
in good condition. Moving on again after my lat
breakfast, I passed Camp LXYII of the journey
to Carpentaria, and camped for the night unde
some polygonum bushes.
Monday, 3rd June. ?Started at seven o?clock,
and, keeping on the south bank of the creek,
was rather encouraged, at about three miles, by
the sound of numerous crows a-head ; presently,
fancied I could see smoke, and was shortly after-
wards set at my ease by hearing a cooey from
Pitchery, who stood on the opposite bank, and
directed me around the lower end of the water-
hole, continually repeating his assurance of
abundance of fish and bread. Having with some
considerable difficulty managed to ascend the
sandy path that led to the camp, I was conducted
by the chief to a fire, where a large pile of fish
were just being cooked in the most approved
style. These I imagined to be for the general
consumption of the half a dozen natives gathered
had their breakfast. I was expected to dispose
of this lot?ra task which, to my own astonish-
msnt, 1 soon accomplished, keeping two or three
blacks pretty steadily at work extracting the
bones for me. The fish being disposed of, next
came a supply of nardoo cake and water, until I
was so full as to be unable to eat any more, when
Pitchery allowing me a short time to recover my-
self, fetched a large bowl of the raw nardoo flour,
mixed to a thin paste ?a most insinuating article,
and one that they appear to esteem a great deli-
cacy. I was then invited to stop the night there,
but this I declined, and proceeded on my way
home.
Tuesday, June 4.?Started for the blacks? camp,
intending to test the practicability of living with
them, and to see what I could learn as to their
ways and manners.
Wednesday, June s.?Remained with the blacks.
Light rain during the greater part of the night,
and more or ?ess throughout the day, in showers.
Wind blowing in squalls from S.
Thursday, June 6.?Returned to our own camp,
found that Mr Burke and King had been well
supplied with fish by the blacks. Made prepara-
tion for shifting our camp nearer to their?s on the
morrow.
Friday, June 7. ?Started in the afternoon for
the blacks? camp, with such things as we could
take ; found ourselves all very weak, in spite of
the abundant supply of fish that we have lately
had. I myself could scarcely get along, although
carrying the lightest swag?only about thirty
pounds. Found that the blacks had decamped,
so determined on proceeding to-morrow up to the
next camp, near the nardoo field.
Saturday, Bth June.?With the greatest fatigue
and difficulty we reached the nardoo camp. No
blacks, greaTy to our disappointment. Took
possession of the best mia mia, and rested for the
remainder of the day.
Sunday, 9th June.?King and I proceeded to
collect nardoo, leaving Mr Burke at home.
Monday, 10th June. ?Mr Burke and King col-
lecting nardoo ; self at home, too weak to go out.
Was fortunate enough to shoot a crow.
[Here follow some meteorologial notes, which
appear to relate to another period.]
Tuesday, 11th June.?King out for nardoo.
Mr Burke up the creek to look for the blacks.
Wednesday, June 12.?King out collecting
nardoo. Mr Burke and lat home, pounding and
cleaning. I still feel myself, if anything, weaker
in the legs, although the nardoo appears to be
more thoroughly (?) digested.
Thursday, June 13.?Last night the sky was
pretty clear, and the air rather cold, but nearly
calm ; a few cir.-st. hung about the N.E. horizon
during the first part of the night. Mr Burke and
King out for nardoo. Self weaker than ever,
scarcely able to go to the water-hole for water.
Towards afternoon cir.-cum. and cir.-st. began to
appear, moving nosthward, scarcely any wind all
day.
Friday, 14th June. ?Night alternately clear and
cloudy, cir.-cum. and cum.-st. moving north-
wards ; no wind, beautifully mild for the time of
year ; in the morning some heavy clouds on the
horizon. King out for nardoo; brought in a
good supply. Mr Burke and I at home, pounding
and cleaning seed. I feel weaker than ever, and


both Mr B. and King are beginning to feel very t
unsteady in the legs. *
Saturday, 15th June. ?Night clear, calm, and j
cold; morning very fine, with a light breath of air (
from N.E. King out for nardoo ; brought in a 1
fine supply. Mr Burke and I pounding and (
cleaning. He finds himself getting very weak, i
and lam not a tit stronger. I have determined <
on beginning to chew tobacco and eat less nardoo, . <
in hopes that it may induce some change in the i
system. I have never yet recovered from the <
effects of the constipation, and the passage of the | i
stools is always exceeding painful. j
Sunday, 16th June.?Wind shifted to N., |
clouds moving from W. to E.; thunder audible ,
two or three times to the southward; sky becom-
ing densely overcast, with an occasional shower i
about nine a.m. We finished up the remains of j
the Rajah for dinner yesterday. King was f�rtu- ;
nate enough to shoot a crow this morning. The ,
rain kept all hands in pounding and cleaning seed j
during the morning. The weather cleared up to- j
wards the middle of the day, and a brisk breeze j
sprang up in the south, lasting till near sunset, j
but rather irregular in its force. Distant thunder
was audible to westward and southward fre- |
quently during the afternoon. I
Monday, 17th June.? Night very boisterous and
stormy. Northerly wind blowing in squalls, and j
heavy showers of rain with thunder in the north j
and west. Heavy clouds moving rapidly from
north to south; gradually clearing up during the
morning, the wind continuing squally during the
day from W. and N.W. King out in the after-
noon for nardoo. .
Tuesday, 18th June.?Exceedingly cold night.
Sky clear, slight breeze, very chilly and change
able; very heavy dew. After sunrise, cir.-st.
clouds began to pass over from west to east, gra-
dually becoming more dense, and assuming the
form of cum.-st. The sky cleared, and it became
warmer towards noon.
Wednesday, 19th June.?Night calm; sky
during first part overcast with cir.-cum. clouds,
most of which cleared away towards' morning,
leaving the air much colder, but the sky remain jd
more or less hazy all night, and it was not nearly
as cold as last night. About eight o clock a strong
southerly wind sprung up, which enabled King
to blow the dust out of our nardoo seeds, but
made me too weak to render him any assistance.
Thursday, 20th June.? Night and morning very
cold, sky clear. lam completely reduced by the
effects of the cold and starvation. King gone out
for nardoo. Mr Burke at home pounding seed ;
he finds himself getting very weak in the legs.
King holds out by far the best; the food seems
to agree with him pretty well. Finding the sun
come out pretty warm towards noon, I took a
sponging all over, but it seemed to do little good
beyond the cleaning effects, for my weakness is
so great that I could not do it with proper expe-
dition. I cannot understand this nardoo at all;
it certainly will not agree with me in any form.
tVe are now reduced to it alone, and we manage
to get from four to five pounds per day between
us. The stools it causes arp enormous, and seem
greatly to exceed the quantity of bread consumed,
and is very slightly altered in appearance from
what it was when eaten. ?
Friday, 21st June.?Last night was cold and
clear, winding up with a strong wind from N.E.
in the morning. I feel much weaker than ever,
and can scarcely crawl out of the mia mia. Un-
less relief comes in some form or other, I cannot
possibly last more than a fortnight. It is a great
consolation, at least, in this position of ours, to
know that we have done all we could, and that
our deaths will rather be the result of the mis-
management of others than of any rash acts of
our own. Had we come to grief elsewhere, we
could only have blamed ourselves ; but here we
are, returned to Cooper?s Creek, where we had
every reason to look for provisions and clothing ;?
and yet we have to die of starvation, in spite of
the explicit instructions given by Mr Burke,
that the depot party should await our return,
and the strong recommendation to the committee
that we should be followed up by a party from
Menindie. About noon a change of wind took
place, and it blew almost as hard from the west
as it did previously from the N.E. A few cir.
i cum. continued to pass over toward east.
Saturday June 22.?Night cloudy and warm,
i livery appearance of rain. Thunder once or
| twice during the night. Clouds moving in an
1 easterly direction. Lower atmosphere perfectly
calm. There were a few drops of rain during the
night, and in the morning, about nine a.am.,
; there was every prospect of more rain until to-
wards noon, when the sky cleared up for a time.
Mr Burke and King out for nardoo The former
i returned much fatigued. lam so weak to day
as to be unable to get on my feet.
Sunday, 23rd June. ?All hands at home. lam
so weak as to be incapable of crawling out of the
mia mia. King holds out well, but Mr Burke
finds himself weaker every day.
Monday, 24th June. ?A fearful night. At about
an hour before sunset, a southerly gale sprang
up and continued throughout the greater portion
of the night; the cold was intense, and it seemed
as if one would be shrivelled up. Towards morn-
ing, it fortunately lulled a little, but a strong
cold breeze continued till near sunset, after which
it became perfectly calm. King went out for
nardoo, in spite of the wind, and came in with a
good load, but he himself terribly cut up. He
says that he can no longer keep up the work, and
as he and Mr Burke are both getting rapidly
weaker, we have but a slight chance of anything
but starvation, unless we can get hold of some
blacks. \
Tuesday, 23rd June {sic).? Night calm, clear,
and intensely cold, especially towards morning.
Near daybreak, King reported seeing a moon in
the E., with a haze of light stretching up from
it, he declared it to be quite as large as the mosn,
and not dim at the edges. I am so weak
that any attempt to get a sight of it was out of
the question; but I think it must have been
Venus in the zodiacal light that he saw, with a
corona around her. Mr Burke and King remain
at home cleaning and pounding seed. They are
both getting weaker every day. The cold plays
the deuce with us, from the small amount of
clothing we have. My wardrobe consists of awide-
awake, a merino shirt, a regatta shirt without
sleeves, the remains of a pair of flannel trousers,
two pahs of socks in rags, and a waistcoatof which
I have managed to keep the pockets together. The
others are no better off. Besides these, we have
between us, for bedding, two small camel pads,
some horsehair, two or three little bits of rag, and
pieces of oilcloth saved from the fire. The day
turned out nice and warm.

Wednesday, 24th June (sic).?' Calm night; sky
overcast with hazy cum. strat. clouds. _An
easterly breeze sprang up towards morning,
making the air much colder. After sunrise there
were indications of a clearing up of the sky, but
it soon clouded in again, the upper current con-
tinuing to move in an easterly direction, whilst a
breeze'from the E. and N.E. blew pretty regularly
throughout the day. Mr Burke and King are
preparing to go up the creek in search of the
blacks. They will leave me some nardoo, wood
and water, with which I must do the best I can
until they return. I think this is almost our only
chance. I feel myself, if anything, rather better,
but I cannot say stronger. The nardoo is begin-
ning to agree better with me ; but without some
change I see little chance for any of us. They
have both shown great hesitation and reluctance
with regard to leaving me, and have repeatedly
desired my candid opinion in the matter. I could
only repeat, however, that I considered it our
only chance, for I could not last long on
the nardoo, even if a supply could be kept up.
Thursday, 25th June (sic).? Cloudy, calm, and
comparatively warm night, clouds almost sta-
tionary. In the morning a gentle breeze from
east. Sky partially cleared up during the day,
making it pleasantly warm and bright; it re-
mained clear during the, afternoon and evening,
offering every prospect of a clear cold night.
Friday, June 26 (�c.)? Clear cold night, slight
breeze from the E., day beautifully warm and
pleasant; Mr Burke suffers greatly from the cold,
and is getting extremely weak ; he and King
start to-morrow up the creek to look for the
blacks, it is the only chance we have of being
saved from starvation. I am weaker than ever
(sic.), although I have a good appetite and relish
the nardoo much, but it seems to give us no
nutriment, and the birds here are so shy as not
to be got at. Even if we got a good supply of
fish I doubt whether we could do much work
on them and the nardoo alone. Nothing now
but the greatest good luck can save any of
us; and as for myself, I may live four or five
days if the weather continues warm. My pulse
is at forty-eight, and very weak, and my legs
and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only
look out, like Mr Micawber, ?for something to
turn up but starvation on nardoo is by no
means very unpleasant, but for the weakness one
feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for
as far as anpetite is concerned, it gives me the
greatest satisfaction. Certainly, fat and sugar
would be more to one?s taste, in fact, those seem
to me to be the great stand by for one in this ex-
traordinary Continent; not that I mean to de-
preciate the farinacious food, but the want of sugar
and fat in all substances obtainable here is so
great that they become almost valueless to us as
articles of food, without the addition of something
else.

In the last four days it will be observed that the
dates are wrongly stated. Doubtless the melan-
choly situation of the party had in some degree
affected the writer. The journal was kept in a
note book which was completely filled up, the
signature being attached at the bottom of the last
page. The journal closes on the 27th June, and
about four days afterwards King having left
Burke dead on the route, returned to the hut
and found that Wills also had expired.
