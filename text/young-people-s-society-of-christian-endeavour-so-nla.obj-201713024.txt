Hymns of Consecration and Endeavour
Jesus! I am resting.
Jesus ! I am resting, resting,
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
Of thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
And Thy beauty fills my soul,
For, by Thy transforming power,
Thou hast made me whole.
Refrain —Jesus! I am resting, resting,
In the joy of what Thou art,
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart.
Oh, how great Thy loving-kindness,
Vaster, broader than the sea 1
Oh, how marvellous Thy goodness,
Lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
Know what wealth of grace is Thine,
Know Thy certainty of promise,
And have made it mine.
Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy love so pure, so changeless,
Satisfies my heart;
Satisfies its deepest longings,
Meets, supplies its every need,
Compasseth me round with blessings;
Thine is love indeed !
Ever lift Thy face upon me,
As I work and wait for Thee;
Resting ’neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
Earth’s dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father’s glory,
Sunshine of my Father’s face,
Keep me ever trusting, resting,
Fill me with Thy grace.
Jean Sophia Pvjott.
3 Buried with Christ.
“Buried with Christ,” and raised with
Him too;
What is there left for me to do ?
Simply to cease from struggling and strife
Simply to “ walk in newness of life.”
Glory be to God!
“ Risen with Christ,” my glorious Head,
Holiness now the pathway I tread,
Beautiful thought, while walking therein,
“He that is dead is freed from sin.”
Living with Christ, who “dieth no more,”
Following Christ, who goeth before ;
I am from bondage utterly freed,
Reckoning self as “dead indeed.”
Living for Christ, my members I yield,
Servants to God, for evermore sealed;
“ Not under law,” I’m now “ under grace,”
Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its
place.
Growing in Christ; no more shall be
named
Things of which now I’m truly ashamed,
“Fruit unto holiness” will I bear,
Life evermore, the end I shall share.
T. Ryder.


Courage, Brother!
Courage, brother! do not stumble,
Though thy path be dark as night;
There’s a star to guide the humble:
“Trust in God, and do the right.”
Let the road be long and dreary,
And its end far out of sight;
Foot it bravely—strong or weary:
“Trust in God, and do the right.”
Perish policy and cunning,
Perish all that fears the light;
Whether losing, whether winning,
“ Trust in God, and do the right.”
Some will hate thee, some will love thee,
Some will flatter, some will slight;
Cease from man, and look above thee:
“Trust in God, and do the right.”
Simple rule and safest guiding,
Inward peace and inward light,
Star upon our path abiding,
“Trust in God, and do the right.”
Courage, brother! do not stumble,
Though thy path be dark as night;
There’s a star to guide the humble:
“Trust in God, and do the right.”
Dr. Norman M'Leod.
My heart is resting, 0 my God.
My heart is resting, 0 my God;
I will give praise and sing;
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.
Now the frail vessel Thou hast made,
No hand but Thine shall fill;
For waters of the earth have failed,
And I am thirsting still.
I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
And here all clay they rise;
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
And close at hand it lies.
And a new song is in my mouth,
To long-loved music set;
Glory to Thee for all the grace
I have not tasted yet.
I have a heritage of joy
That yet I must not see;
The hand that bled to make it mine,
Is keeping it for me !
My heart is resting on His truth,
Who hath made all things mine—
Who draws my captive will to Him,
And makes it one with Thine.
Anna L. Waring.
5 Soldiers of Christ, arise.
Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armour on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies
, Through His eternal Son:
Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
And in His mighty power;
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
Is more than conqueror.
Stand then in His great might,
With all His strength endued;
But take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God.
That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts passed,
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,
And stand entire at last.


Leave no unguarded place,
No weakness of the soul,
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole;
To keep your armour bright,
Attend with constant care,
Still walking in your Captain’s sight,
And watching unto prayer.
From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle, and fight, and pray,
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day!
Still let the Spirit cry
In all his Soldiers, “ Come,”
Till Christ the Lord descend from high
And take the conquerors home.
Charles Wesley.
6 We eome unto our Fathers’
God.
We come unto our fathers’ God:
Their Rock is our salvation:
The eternal arms, their dear abode,
We make our habitation;
We bring Thee, Lord, the praise they
brought;
We seek Thee as Thy saints have sought
In every generation.
The fire divine, their steps that led,
Still goeth bright before us;
The heavenly shield, around them spread,
Is still high holden o’er us :
The grace those sinners that subdued,
The strength those weaklings that renewed,
Doth vanquish, doth restore us.
The cleaving sins that brought them low
Are still our souls oppressing;
The tears that from their eyes did flow
Fall fast, our shame confessing;
As with Thee, Lord, prevailed their cry,
So our strong prayer ascends on high
And bringeth down Thy blessing.
Their joy unto their Lord we bring;
Their song to us descendeth;
The Spirit who in them did sing
To us His music lendeth.
His song in them, in us, is one;
We raise it high, we send it on—
The song that never endeth 1
Ye saints to come, take up the strain —
The same sweet theme endeavour!
Unbroken be the golden chain!
Keep on the song for ever!
Safe in the same dear dwelling-place,
Rich with the same eternal grace,
Bless the same boundless Giver!
T. H. Gill.
Y Is thy cruse of comfort failing ?
Is thy cruse of comfort failing ?
Rise and share it with a friend;
And thro’ all the years of famine
It shall serve thee to the end.
Love divine will fill thy storehouse,
Or thy handful still renew ;
Scanty fare for one will often
Make a royal feast for two.
For the heart grows rich in giving;
All its wealth is living grain;
Seeds—which mildew in the garner—
Scattered, fill with gold the plain.
Is thy burden hard and heavy ?
Do thy steps drag wearily ?
Help to lift thy brother’s burden—
God will bear both it and thee.


Numb and weary, on the mountains,
Wouldst thou sleep amidst the snow?
Chafe that frozen form beside thee,
And together both shall glow.
Art thou stricken in life’s battle?
Many wounded round thee moan;
Lavish on their wounds thy balsam,
And that balm shall heal thine own.
Is thy heart a well left empty ?
None but God its void can fill;
Nothing but a ceaseless fountain
Can its ceaseless longings still.
Is thy heart a living power ?
Self-entwined, its strength sinks low ;
It can only live in loving,
And by serving love will grow.
Mrs. Bundle Charles.
The very same Jesus.
Come, sinners, to the Living One,
He’s just the same Jesus
As when He raised the widow’s son,
The very same Jesus.
Refrain— The very same Jesus,
The wonder working Jesus;
Oh, praise His name, He’s just the same,
The very same Jesus.
Come, feast upon the “Living Bread,”
He’s just the same Jesus
As when the multitudes He fed,
The very same Jesus.
Come, tell Him all your griefs and fears,
He’s just the same Jesus
As when He shed those loving tears,
The very same Jesus.
Come unto Him for clearer light,
He’s just the same Jesus
As when He gave the blind their sight,
The very same Jesus.
Calm ’midst the waves of trouble be,
He’s just the same Jesus
As when He hushed the raging sea,
The very same Jesus.
Some day our raptured eyes shall see
He’s just the same Jesus;
Oh, blessed day for you and me!
The very same Jesus.
L. H. Edmunds.
9 Come ye yourselves apart.
Come ye yourselves apart and rest awhile,
Weary, I know it, of the press and
throng;
Wipe from your brow the sweat and dust
of toil,
And in My quiet strength again be
strong.
Come ye aside from all the world holds
dear,
For converse which the world has never
known:
Alone with Me and with My Father here,
With Me and with My Father not alone.
Come, tell Me all that ye have said and
done,
Your victories and failures, hopes and
fears;
I know how hardly souls are wooed and
won;
My choicest wreaths are always wet with
tears.
Come ye and rest! the journey is too great,
And ye will faint beside the way, and
sink;
The bread of life is here for you to eat,
And here for you the wine of love to
drink.


Then, fresh from converse with your Lord,
return
II Ten thousand thanks to Jesus.
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
Whose life our ransom paid,
Whose blood a full atonement
And work till daylight softens into even;
The brief hours are not lost in which ye
learn
For all the world has made.
Let every heart adore Him,
Let every creature sing
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
Our Saviour and our King.
Refrain —Ten thousand thanks, ten thou-
sand thanks,
We’ll praise Him o’er and o’er;
And for the life with Him to live
More of your Master, and His rest in
heaven.
E. H. Bickersteth.
10 “ Our Land for Christ!”
“ Our land for Christ!” we sing;
Our hearts to Him we bring,
And trust His word:
Ten thousand thousand more.
Ten thousand hearts to Jesus
With His dear cross in view,
Each Christian grace renew,
And make endeavour true
How gladly would we give!
Ten thousand lives to Jesus,
Had we so long to live.
Ten thousand tongues shall praise Him,
Ten thousand songs ascend
To Him, our blest Redeemer,
To Him, our dearest Friend.
For Christ our Lord.
Our land for Christ,
Our hearts we bring,
And make endeavour firm and true
For Christ, our Lord and King.
“ Our Land for Christ!” we sing
Away earth’s follies fling,
And seek His love :
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus
For blessings every hour;
Ten thousand times ten thousand,
For love’s redeeming power.
And when we hear his welcome
Ours be a heavenly prize,
Unseen by mortal eyes,
In mansions in the skies,
With Him above.
Beyond the rolling sea,
His love through endless ages
Our sweetest song shall be!
“ Our land for Christ!” we sing;
Christ—Prophet, Priest, and King—
Whom saints adore:
Each day some duty done,
Some Christian work begun,
Some soul to Jesus won,
We ask no more.
12 Moment by Moment.
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine:
Living with Jesus a new life divine—
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, 0 Lord, I am Thine.
Refrain —Moment by moment I’m kept in
His love,
Moment by moment I’ve life from
above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, 0 Lord, I am
“ Our land for Christ!” we sing ;
Our all to Him we bring,
With one accord;
Sinners, from sin set free,
His wondrous grace shall see,
And through eternity
Worship the Lord.
C. G. Clark.
Thine.


Never a battle with wrong for the right,
Never a contest that HE doth not fight;
Lifting above us His banner so white,
Moment by moment I’m kept in His sight.
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment I’m under His care.
Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop, and never a moan,
Never a danger, but there on the throne
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that he cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus my Saviour abides with me still.
13 Once it was the blessing.
Once it was the blessing,
Now it is the Lord;
Once it was my feeling,
Now it is His word;
Once His gifts I wanted,
Now Himself alone;
Once I strove and hungered,
Now His presence own.
Once ’twas painful trying,
Now ’tis perfect trust;
Once a half salvation,
Now the uttermost;
Once ’twas ceaseless holding,
Now He holds me fast;
Once ’twas constant drifting,
Now my anchor’s cast.
Once ’twas busy planning,
Now ’tis trustful prayer;
Once ’twas anxious caring,
Now He has the care;
Once ’twas what I wanted,
Now what Jesus says;
Once ’twas constant asking,
Now ’tis ceaseless praise.
Once I hoped in Jesus,
Now I know He’s mine;
Once my lamps were dying,
Now He makes them shine;
Once for death I waited,
Now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil.
14 Full Consecration.
Full consecration! heart and spirit
yielded,
In the calm rest of resurrection life;
Within the secret of God’s presence
shielded
From care in service, and from harm of
strife.
Full consecration! eye hath not beholden,
Ear hath not heard, nor heart of man
conceiv’d;
All the deep gladness in these words
enfolden,
Their blessing who, not seeing, have
believed.
Full consecration! confident surrender
Of starting wish, of plan unowned by
Him;
Consciously circled by a love too tender,
With needless cloud the pilgrim-path to
Full consecration! Whither, Lord, Thou
goest,
We too would follow, listening for Thy
call;
The true, glad watchword of our hearts
Thou knowest,
All, all for Christ, and Christ our all in
all.
E. S. Elliott.


15 “Victoria for Christ!”
“Victoria for Christ!” Hark! the chal-
lenge resounding
High over mountain, and valley, and
plain—
All the dark forces of treason confound-
mg—
Christ is advancing to conquer and
reign! •>>>■
Rally, Endeavourers! Swell out
the chorus,
Trusting in God, and renewing
your tryst!
Bright gleams the banner that’s
marching before us,
Claiming the victory—“ Vi-
ctoria for Christ!”
Pledged youths and maidens, in glad
attestation,
Setting your seal to the bond of the
Lord,
Follow your fathers in high consecration,
Filled with His Spirit, believing His
word.
Brothers and sisters in Christian En-
deavour,
Loving and earnest, leal-hearted and
true,
Bound in a union that nothing can sever,
Rally around our own Red, White and
Blue!
John Pollock {altered).
16 Like a river, glorious.
Like a river, glorious
Is God’s perfect peace,
Over all victorious
In its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it fioweth
Fuller every day—
Perfect, yet it groweth
Deeper all the way.
Refrain —Stayed upon Jehovah,
Hearts are fully blest;
Finding, as He promised,
Perfect peace and rest.
Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow,
Never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry,
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry
Touch the spirit there.
Every joy or trial
Falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial
By the Sun of Love.
We may trust Him fully
All for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true.
17 I’m not ashamed to own my
Lord.
I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause;
Maintain the honour of His word,
The glory of Plis cross.
Chorm —At the cross, at the cross, where
I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away;
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day.
Jesus, my God, I know His name,
His name is all my trust;
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.
Firm as His throne His promise stands
And He can well secure
What I’ve committed to His hands
Till the decisive hour.
Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father’s face ;
And in the New Jerusalem
Appoint my soul a place.


18 0 Light of light, shine in!
0 Light of light, shine in!
Cast out this night of sin;
Create true day within:
O Light of light, shine in!
Refrain— o Light, all light excelling,
Make my soul Thy dwelling;
0 Joy, all grief dispelling,
To my poor heart come in.
0 Joy of joys, come in!
End Thou this grief of sin;
Create calm peace within;
0 Joy of joys, come in!
0 Life of life, pour in 1
Expel this death of sin,
Awake true life within;
0 Life of life, pour in!
0 Love of love, flow in
This hateful root of sin,
Pluck up, destroy within:
0 Love of love, flow in!
My God and Lord, 0 come!
Of joys the Joy and Sun;
Make in this heart Thy home:
My God and Lord, 0 come!
Horatius Bonar.
10 0 Jesus, I have promised.
0 Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
Be Thou for ever near me,
My Master and my Friend 1
I shall not fear the battle
If thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my guide.
Oh, let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will.
Oh, speak to reassure me,
To hasten or control;
Oh, speak, and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul 1
0 Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee
That where Thou art in glory,
There shall Thy servant be;
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end :
Oh, give me grace to follow,
My Master and my Friend.
Oh, let me see Thy foot-marks,
And in them plant mine own ;
My hope to follow duly
Is in Thy strength alone!
Oh, guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end;
And then in heaven receive me,
My Saviour and my Friend.
John E. Bode.
80 Loved with everlasting love.
Loved with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know;
Spirit, breathing from above,
Thou hast taught me it is so!
Oh, this full and perfect peace!
Oh, this transport all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His, and He is mine.
Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green;
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen;
Birds with gladder songs o’erflow,
Flowers with deeper beauties shine,
Since I know, as now I know,
I am His, and He is mine.


Things that once were wild alarms
Cannot now disturb my rest;
Closed in everlasting arms,
Pillowed on the loving breast.
Oh, to lie for ever here,
Doubt and care and self resign,
While He whispers in my ear—
I am His, and He is mine.
His for ever, only His,
Who the Lord and me shall part ?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss,
Christ can fill the loving heart!
Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
Firstborn light in gloom decline;
But, while God and I shall be,
I am His, and He is mine.
G. Wade Robinson.
21 Christ has for sin atonement
made.
Christ has for sin atonement made;
What a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed!—the price is paid:
What a wonderful Saviour:
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Jesus!
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Lord I
I praise Him for the cleansing blood:
What a wonderful Saviour 1
That reconciled my soul to God:
What a wonderful Saviour!
He cleansed my heart from all its sin:
What a wonderful Saviour!
And now He reigns and rules therein:
What a wonderful Saviour!
He gives me overcoming power:
What a wonderful Saviour!
And triumph in each trying hour;
What a wonderful Saviour!
To Him I’ve given all my heart:
What a wonderful Saviour!
The world shall never share a part
What a wonderful Saviour I
E. A. Hoffman.
22 I heard the voice of Jesus
say.
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Come unto me, and rest:
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast. ”
I came to Jesus as I was—
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Behold, I freely give
The living water —thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quench’d, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“I am this dark world’s Light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun,
And in that Light of life I’ll walk
Till traveling days are done.
Horatius Bonar.


Jesus saves.
We have heard the joyful sound ;
Jesus saves! Jesus saves !
Spread the tidings all around :
Jesus saves! Jesus saves !
Bear the news to every land,
Climb the steeps and cross the waves ;
Onward!—’tis our Lord’s command:
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves!
Waft it on the rolling tide :
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide:
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves!
Sing, ye islands of the sea;
Echo back, ye ocean caves ;
Earth shall keep her jubilee :
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing above the battle strife,
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves !
By His death and endless life
Jesus saves !. Jesus saves !
Sing it softly through the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o’er the tomb :
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Give the winds a mighty voice :
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice :
Jesus saves ! Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free
To every strand that ocean laves ;
This our song of victory:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Priscilla J. Owens,
34 In full and glad surrender.
In full and glad surrender,
I give myself to Thee,
Thine utterly and only,
And evermore to be.
0 Son of God who lovest me,
I will be Thine alone,
And all I have, and all I am,
Shall henceforth he Thine own.
Reign over me, Lord Jesus!
0 make my heart Thy throne !
It shall be Thine, dear Saviour,
It shall be Thine alone.
Oh, come and reign, Lord Jesus ;
Rule over everything!
And keep me always loyal,
And true to Thee, my King!
F. It. Havergal.
35 Lord, Thy ransomed Church
is waking.
Lord, Thy ransomed Church is waking
Out of slumber far and near,
Knowing that the morn is breaking
When the Bridegroom shall appear;
Waking up to claim the treasure
With Thy precious life-blood bought,
And to trust in fuller measure
All Thy wondrous death hath wrought.
Praise to Thee for this glad shower,
Precious drops of latter rain;
Praise, that by Thy Spirit’s power
Thou hast quickened us again;
That Thy Gospel’s priceless treasure
Now is borne from land to land,
And that all the Father’s pleasure
Prospers in Thy pierced hand.
Praise to Thee for saved ones yearning
O’er the lost and wandering throng;
Praise for voices daily learning
To upraise the glad new song ;
Set on fire our heart’s devotion
With the love of Thy dear name,
Till o’er every land and ocean
Lips and lives Thy cross proclaim.
fiai'ah G. Stock,


36 Let me come closer to Thee,
Jesus.
Let me come closer to Thee, Jesus ;
Oh! closer day by day ;
Let me lean harder on Thee, Jesus,
Yes, harder all the way.
Let me show forth Thy beauty, Jesus,
Like sunshine on the hills ;
Oh! let my lips pour forth Thy sweetness
In joyous sparkling rills.
Yes, like a fountain precious, Jesus,
Make me and let me be;
Keep me and use me daily, Jesus,
For Thee, for only Thee.
In all my heart and will, 0 Jesus,
Be altogether King.
Make me a loyal subject, Jesus,
To Thee in everything.
Llanthony Abbey Hymns.
I would not ask for earthly
store.
I would not ask for earthly store—
Thou wilt my need supply;
But I would covet, more and more,
The clear and single eye,
To see my duty face to face,
And trust Thee, Lord, for daily grace.
Refrain:
Then shall my heart keep singing,
While to the Cross I cling ;
For rest is sweet at Jesus’ feet,
While homeward faith keeps winging.
I care not for the empty show
That thoughtless worldlings see;
But gladly do the best I know,
And leave the rest with Thee—
Well satisfied that sweet reward
Is sure to those who trust the Lord,
Whate’er the crosses mine shall be,
I will not dare to shun;
I only ask to live for Thee,
And that Thy will be done ;
Thy will, 0 Lord, be mine each day,
While pressing on my homeward way.
And when at last, my labour o’er,
I cross the narrow sea,
Grant, Lord, that on the other shore
My soul may dwell with Thee;
And learn what here I cannot know,
Why Thou hast ever loved me so.
J. J. Maxfield.
38 The Watchman’s Cry.
Hark, ’tis the watchman’s cry,
Wake, brethren, wake:
Jesus Himself is nigh;
Wake, brethren, wake.
Sleep is for sons of night;
Ye are children of the light;
Yours is the glory bright;
Wake, brethren, wake.
Call to each wakening band,
Watch, brethren, watch;
Clear is our Lord’s command,
Watch, brethren, watch.
Be ye as men that wait
Always at their Master’s gate,
E’en though He tarry late ;
Watch, brethren, watch.
Heed we the Steward’s call,
Work, brethren, work:
There’s room enough for all;
Work, brethren, work.
This vineyard of the Lord
Constant labour will afford;
He will your work reward ;
Work, brethren, work,


Hear we the Shepherd’s voice,
Pray, brethren, pray:
Would ye His heart rejoice,
Pray, brethren, pray.
Sin calls for ceaseless fear,
Weakness needs the Strong One near,
Long as we struggle here,
Pray, brethren, pray.
Sound now the final chord,
Praise, brethren, praise:
Thrice holy is the Lord,
Praise, brethren, praise.
What more befits the tongues
Soon to join the angels’ songs?
While heaven the note prolongs
Praise, brethren, praise!
God be with you.
God be with you till we meet again !
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again!
Till we meet at Jesus’ feet; . . .
God be with you till we meet again!
God be with you till we meet again!
When life’s perils thick confound you,
Put His loving arms around you ;
God be with you till we meet again.
God be with you till we meet again!
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
Smite death’s threat’ning wave before you
God be with you till we meet again.
J. E. Rankin.
The New Year.
Father, here we dedicate
All this year to Thee,
In whatever worldly state
Thou wilt have us be;
Not from sorrow, pain, or care
Freedom dare we claim;
This alone shall be our prayer,
“Glorify Thy name.”
Can a child presume to choose
Where or how to live ?
Can a Father’s love refuse
All the best to give ?
More Thou givest every day
Than the best can claim,
Nor withholdest aught that may
Glorify Thy name.
If in mercy Thou wilt spare
Joys that yet are ours,
If our future life may bear
Some few brighter flowers,
Let our glad hearts, while they sing,
Thee in all proclaim,
And whate’er this year may bring,
Glorify Thy name.
If Thou callest to the cross,
And its shadow come,
Turning all our gain to loss,
Shrouding heart and home:
We will think how Thy dear Son
To His glory came,
And repeat, till life is done,
“ Glorify Thy name.”
Lawrence Tuttiett.
31 Throw out the life-line!
Throw out the life-line across the dark
wave,
There is a brother whom someone should
save;
Somebody’s brother! oh, who then will
dare
To throw out the life-line, his peril
share?


Throw out the life-line I throw
out the life-line!
Someone is drifting away:
Throw out the life-line! throw
out the life-line!
Someone is sinking to-day.
Throw out the life-line with hand quick
and strong;
Why do you tarry, my brother, so long ?
See—he is sinking; oh, hasten to-day—
And out with the life-boat! away, then,
away!
Throw out the life-line to danger-fraught
Sinking in anguish where you’ve never
been:
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark
waters flow.
Soon will the season of rescue be o’er,
Soon will they drift to eternity’s shore;
Haste, then, nry brother! no time for
delay,
But throw out the life-line, and save them
to-day!
E. S. Ufford.
3£ If any little word of mine.
If any little word of mine
May make a life the brighter, >■
If any little song of mine
May make a heart the lighter,
God help me speak the little word,
And take my bit of singing,
And drop it in some lonely vale,
To set the echoes ringing.
If any little love of mine
May make a life the sweeter,
If any little care of mine
May make a friend’s the fleeter,
If any lift of mine may ease
The burden of another,
God give me love, and care, and strength
To help my toiling brother.
33 Gospel Light.
O’er the gloomy hills of darkness,
Look, my soul, be still and gaze;
All the promises do travail
With a glorious day of grace;
Blessed jubilee!
Let thy glorious morning dawn.
Kingdoms wide, that sit in darkness,
Grant them, Lord, Thy glorious light;
And, from eastern coast to western,
May the morning chase the night;
And redemption,
Freely purchased, win the day.
May the glorious day approaching,
Thine eternal love proclaim;
And the everlasting gospel
Spread abroad Thy holy name,
O’er the borders
Of the great Immanuel’s land.
Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel,
Win and conquer, never cease;
May thy lasting wide dominion
Multiply and still increase:
Sway Thy sceptre,
Saviour, all the world around.
William Williams.
34 Looking upward.
Looking upward every day,
Sunshine on our faces;
Pressing onward every day
Toward the heavenly places.
Growing every day in awe,
For Thy name is holy;
Learning every day to love
With a love more lowly


Walking every day more close
To our Elder Brother;
Growing every day more true
Unto one another.
Leaving every day behind
Something which might hinder;
Bunning swifter every day,
Growing purer, kinder.
Lord, so pray we every day,
Hear us in Thy pity,
That we enter in at last
To the Holy City.
Mary Butler.
35 0 King of Kings.
0 King of kings, whose reign of old
Hath been from everlasting,
Before whose throne their crowns of gold
The white-rob’d saints are casting;
While all the shining courts on high
With angel songs are ringing,
Oh, let Thy children venture nigh,
Their lowly homage bringing.
For every heart made glad by Thee,
With thankful praise is swelling;
And every tongue, with joy set free,
Its happy theme is telling,
Thou hast been mindful of Thine own,
And lo! we come confessing—
’Tis Thou hast dower’d our queenly throne
With sixty years of blessing.
Oh, Eoyal heart, with wide embrace,
For all her children yearning!
Oh, happy realm, such mother grace
With loyal love returning !
Where England’s flag flies wide unfurled,
All tyrant wrongs repelling,
God make the world a better world
For man’s brief earthly dwelling.
Lead on, 0 Lord, Thy people still,
New grace and wisdom giving,
To larger love, and purer will,
And nobler heights of living.
And, while of all Thy love below
They chant the gracious story,
Oh, teach them first Thy Christ to know,
And magnify His glory.
Dr. Walsham How.
36 Hail! sweetest, dearest tie
that binds.
Hatt, ! sweetest, dearest tie that binds
Our glowing hearts in one;
Hail I sacred hope that fills our minds
As towards the goal we run.
It is the hope, the blissful hope,
Which Jesu’s grace has given ;
The hope when days and years are past,
We all shall meet in heaven.
We all shall meet in heaven at last,
We all shall meet in heaven;
We know when days and years are past,
We all shall meet in heaven.
What though the northern wintry blast
Should howl around our cot;
What though beneath an eastern sun
We cast our distant lot;
Yet still we’d share the blissful hope,
Which Jesu’s grace has given ;
The hope when days and years are past,
We all shall meet in heaven.
No lingering look, no parting sigh,
Our future meeting knows;
There friendship beams from every eye,
And love immortal glows.
0 sacred hope 1 0 blissful hope!
Which Jesu’s grace has given;
The hope when days and years are past,
We all shall meet in Jieayen,


37 My heart is fixed.
My heart is fixed, eternal God,
Fixed on Thee:
And my immortal choice is made,
Christ for me;
He is my Prophet, Priest, and King,
Who did for me salvation bring;
And while I’ve breath I mean to sing,
Christ for me.
Let others boast of heaps of gold,
Christ for me;
His riches never can be told,
Christ for me.
Your gold will waste and wear away,
Your honours perish in a day;
My portion never can decay,
Christ for me.
In pining sickness, or in health,
Christ for me;
In deepest poverty, or wealth,
Christ for me;
And in that all-important day,
When I the summons must obey,
And pass from this dark world away,
Christ for me.
38 Christ’s Love.
It passeth knowledge, that dear love of
Thine,
My Jesus, Saviour; yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and
length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting
strength,
Know more and more.
It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
My Jesus, Saviour; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and
near,
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget,
It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Jesus, Saviour; yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so
free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
Nigh unto God.
0 fill me, Jesus, Saviour, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above ;
Thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.
Mary Shekelton.
30 Go ye into all the World.
Far, far away in heathen darkness dwell-
ing,
Millions of souls for ever may be lost;
Who, who will go, salvation’s story tell-
ing—
Looking to Jesus, counting not the
cost?
“All power is given unto Me!
Go ye into all the world, and
preach the gospel;
And 10, I am with you alway.”
See o’er the world wide open doors in-
viting :
Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!
Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,
Send forth the gospel, break the chains
of sin!
“Why will ye die?” the voice of God is
calling;
“Why will ye die?” re-echo in His
Name:
Jesus hath died to save from death appall-
ing;
Life and salvation, therefore, go pro-
claim,


God speed the day when those of every
nation,
“ Glory to God” triumphantly shall
sing;
Eansomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salva-
tion,
Shout “Hallelujah, for the Lord is
King!”

40 There are lonely hearts to
cherish.
Thebe are lonely hearts to cherish,
While the days are going by;
There are weary souls who perish,
While the days are going by;
If a smile we can renew,
As our journey we pursue,
Oh the good we all may do,
While the days are going by.
There’s no time for idle scorning,
While the days are going by ;
Let your face be bright as morning,
While the days are going by;
Oh, the world is full of sighs,
Full of sad and weeping eyes ;
Help your fallen brothers rise,
While the days are going by.
All the loving links that bind us,
While the days are going by,
One by one we leave behind us,
While the days are going by;
But the seeds of good we sow,
Both in shade and shine will grow,
And will keep our hearts aglow,
While the days are going by.
George Cooper.
41 Ten thousand times.
Ten thousand times ten thousand,
In sparkling raiment bright,
The armies of the ransomed saints
Throng up the steeps of light:
’Tis finished! all is finished,
Their fight with death and sin;
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in.
Refrain— Hallelujah! to the Lamb that
once was slain!
Hallelujah! to Him who lives
again.
What rush of alleluias
Fills all the earth and sky!
What ringing of a thousand harps
Bespeaks the triumph nigh !
0 day, for which creation
And all its tribes were made!
0 joy, for all its former woes
A thousandfold repaid!
Oh, then what raptured greetings
On Canaan’s happy shore!
What knitting severed friendships up,
Where partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimmed with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless,
Nor widows desolate.
Bring near Thy great salvation,
Thou Lamb for sinners slain ;
Fill up the roll of Thine elect,
Then take Thy power and reign:
Appear, Desire of nations,
Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign:
Thou Prince and Saviour, come I
Dr. Henry Alford.


42 lam Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus.
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
Trusting only Thee;
Trusting Thee for full salvation,
Great and free.
I am trusting Thee for pardon,
At Thy feet I bow;
For Thy grace and tender mercy,
Trusting now.
I am trusting Thee for cleansing,
In the crimson flood;
Trusting Thee to make me holy,
• By Thy blood.
I am trusting Thee to guide me :
Thou alone shalt lead :
Every day and hour supplying
All my need.
I am trusting Thee for power,
Thine can never fail;
Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me
Must prevail.
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
Never let me fall;
I am trusting Thee for ever,
And for all.
F. It. Havergal.
43 0 Lord, Thy Heavenly Grace
Impart.
0 Lord, Thy heavenly grace impart,
And fix my frail inconstant heart;
Henceforth my chief desire shall be
To dedicate myself to Thee.
Whate’er pursuits my time employ,
One thought shall fill my soul with joy:
That silent, secret thought shall be,
That all my hopes are fixed on Thee.
Thy glorious eye pervadeth space ;
Thour’t present, Lord, in every place;
And wheresoe’er my lot may be,
Still shall my spirit cleave to Thee.
Renouncing every sinful thing,
Safe ’neath the covert of Thy wing,
My sweetest thought henceforth shall be,
That all I want I find in Thee.
J. F. Oherlin, tr. Lucy Wilson.
44 Prayer.
Prayer was appointed to convey
The blessings God designs to give;
Long as they live should Christians pray,
For only while they pray they live.
If pains afflict, or wrongs oppress,
If cares distract, or fears dismay,
If guilt deject, or sin distress,
The remedy’s before thee—pray.
’Tis prayer supports the soul that’s weak ;
Though thought be broken, language
lame;
Pray if thou canst or canst not speak ;
But pray with faith in Jesus’ name.
Depend on Him, thou canst not fail;
Make all thy wants and wishes known;
Fear not—His merits must prevail!
Ask what thou wilt, it shall be done.
45 Room for thee.
Thou didst leave Thy throne
And Thy kingly crown
When Thou earnest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem’s home
Was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity:
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee!


Heaven’s arches rang
When the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth
Cam’st Thou, Lord, on earth,
And in great humility:
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee!
Thou earnest, Lord,
With the living Word
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn,
And with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary:
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
Thy cross is my only plea 1
When heaven’s arches shall ring,
And the choir shall sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home,
Saying, “Yet there is room—
There is room at My side for thee 1”
And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me.
Emily E. S. Elliott.
46 Dedicatory Song Prayer.
0 blessed Master, take Thine own,
For all we have is Thine alone.
0 may our lives true worship be,
As faithful stewards, Lord, for Thee,
4Y True-hearted, whole-hearted.
True-hearted, whole-hearted, faithful and
loyal,
King of our lives, by Thy grace we will
be!
Traced on Thy standard exalted and royal,
“ Christ and the Church” our watchword
we see.
Peal out the watchword! Christian
Endeavour!
Song of our spirits, rejoicing and
free—
Peal out the watchword! Loyal for
ever,
True to our pledge by His grace we
will be!
True-hearted, whole-hearted! Fullest
allegiance,
Yielding henceforth to our glorious King;
Valiant endeavour and loving obedience,
Freely and joyously now would we bring.
Banded together for earnest endeavour,
Joined to each other by Christ-love
divine,
So let us live, that nothing may sever
This blessed union ’twixt your heart
and mine.
F, R. Havergal [altered).
48 Lord, speak to me.
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone;
As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
Thy erring children, lost and lone.
0 lead me, Lord, that I may lead
The wandering and the wavering feet;
0 feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.
0 teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things Thou dost impart;
And wing my words, that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.
0 give Thine own sweet rest to me,
That I may speak with soothing power
A word in season, as from Thee,
To weary ones, in needful hour.


0 fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
Until my very heart o’erflow,
In kindling thought and glowing word,
Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.
0 use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where,
Until Thy blessed face I see,
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
Frances Ridley Havergal.
49 Jesus, Thine all-victorious love.
Jesus, Thine all-victorious love
Shed in my soul abroad ;
Then shall my heart no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God.
Oh that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow;
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow.
Thou, who at Pentecost didst fall,
Do Thou my sins consume;
Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call;
Spirit of burning, come.
Refining fire, go through my heart,
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole.
My steadfast soul from falling free,
Shall then no longer move,
While Christ is all the world to me,
And all my heart is love.
50 A Covenant Hymn.
We covenant with hand and heart
Ever to follow Christ our Lord;
With world and sin and self to part,
And thus obey His sacred word:
To love each other heartily,
In truth and in sincerity,
And under cross, reproach, and shame,
To glorify His Holy Name.
8. T. Benade.
31 Take time to be holy.
Take time to be holy,
Speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always,
And feed on His Word.
Make friends of God’s children;
Help those who are weak;
Forgetting in nothing
His blessing to seek.
Take time to be holy,
The world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone—
By looking to Jesus,
Like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends in thy conduct
His likeness shall see.
Take time to be holy,
Let Him be thy Guide;
And run not before Him,
Whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow
Still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus,
Still trust in His Word.
Take time to be Holy,
Be calm in thy soul;
Each thought and each temper
Beneath His control:
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted
For service above.
W. D. Longstaf,


52 Trust and Obey.
When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way !
While we do His good will
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey !
Refrain —Trust and obey!
For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey!
Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide, while we trust and obey!
Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest" if we trust and obey.
But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey!
Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey!
53 I want, dear Lord.
“I want, dear Lord, a heart that’s true
and clean,
A sun-lit heart without a cloud between;
A heart divine, a heart like Thine,
A heart as white as snow—
On me, dear Lord, heart like this bestow
“ I want, dear Lord, a love that feels for all,
A deep strong love that answers every call;
A love divine, a love like Thine,
A love for high and low—
On me, dear Lord, a love like this bestow.
“ I want, dear Lord, a soul on fire for Thee,
A heart baptised with Heavenly energy;
A willing hand at Thy command
To do whate’er I know,
And spread Thy word wherever I may go.”
54 My God, I thank Thee.
My God, I thank Thee, who hast made
The earth so bright,
So full of splendour and of joy,
Beauty and light;
So many glorious things are here,
Noble and right.
I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made
Joy to abound;
So many gentle thoughts and deeds
Circling us round,
That in the darkest spot of earth
Some love is found.
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept
The best in store;
I have enough, yet not too much,
To long for more;
A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.
I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls,
Though amply blest,
Can never find, although they seek,
A perfect rest—
Nor ever can, until they lean
On Jesus’ breast.
Adelaide A, Procter.


Come, Holy Ghost, in love.
Come, Holy Ghost, in love,
Shed on us from above
Thine own bright ray:
Divinely good Thou art;
Thy sacred gifts impart
To gladden each sad heart:
Oh, come to-day.
Come, tend’rest Friend and best,
Our most delightful Guest,
With soothing power;
Rest, which the weary know,
Shade, ’mid the noontide glow,
Peace, when deep griefs o’erflow,
Cheer us this hour.
Come, Light serene and still,
Our inmost bosoms fill,
Dwell in each breast:
We know no dawn but thine;
Send forth Thy beams divine,
On our dark souls to shine
And make us blest.
Exalt our low desires,
Extinguish passion’s fires,
Heal every wound;
Our stubborn spirits bend,
Our icy coldness end,
Our devious steps attend,
While heavenward bound.
Come, all the faithful bless,
Let all who Christ confess
His praise employ;
Give virtue’s rich reward,
Victorious death accord,
And, with our glorious Lord,
Eternal joy.
Dr. Day Palmer.
56 Praise Him ! Praise Him!
Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our

0 ye saints that dwell in the mountains of
Zion!
Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful
song.
Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our
blessed Redeemer;
For our sins He suffered and bled and
He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salva-
tion,
Hail Him! Hail Him! Jesus, the

Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced
His brow;
Once for us rejected, despised, and for-
saken,
Prince of glory, ever triumphant now.

blessed Redeemer,
Heavenly portals, loud with hosannas
ring!
Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever ;
Crown Him! crown Him! Prophet and
Priest and King !

Fanny J. Crosby.
57 Jesus, Sun and Shield.
Jesus, Sun and Shield art Thou;
Sun and Shield for ever!
Never canst Thou cease to shine,
Cease to guard us never.
Cheer our steps as on we go,
Come between us and the foe.
Jesus, Bread and Wine art Thou,
Wine and Bread for ever!
Never canst Thou cease to feed,
Or refresh us never.
Feed we still on Bread divine,
Drink we still this heavenly Wine!
Jesus, Love and Life art Thou,
Life and Love for ever!
Ne’er to quicken shalt Thou cease,
Or to love us never.
All of life and love we need
Is in Thee, in Thee indeed.
Jesus, Peace and Joy art Thou,
Joy and Peace for ever!
Joy that fades not, changes not,
Peace that leaves us never.
Joy and Peace we have in Thee,
Now and through eternity.
Jesus, Song and Strength art Thou,
Strength and Song for ever!
Strength that never can decay,
Song that ceaseth never.
Still to us the strength and song
Through eternal days prolong.
Horatius Bonar.
58 0 Glad and Glorious Gospel.
’Tis a true and faithful saying,
Jesus died for sinful men;
Tho’ we’ve told the story often,
We must tell it o’er again.
Refrain —0 glad and glorious Gospel!
With joy we now proclaim
A full and free salvation
Thro’ faith in Jesus’ name.
He has made a full atonement,
Now His saving work is done;
He has satisfied the Father,
Who accepts in us His Son.
Still upon His hands the nail-prints,
And the scars upon His brow,
Our Eedeemer, Lord and Saviour,
In the glory standeth now.
But remember, this same Jesus
In the clouds will come again,
And with Him His blood-bought people
Evermore shall live again.
M. Fraser.
59 Farewell, our happy day
must close.
Farewell, our happy day must close,
The ev’ning’s shadow longer grows,
’Twill be a mem’ry soon.
But, in our march along life’s way,
The echoes of this festal day
Will long repeat their tune.
Farewell! farewell!
God watch between us one and all,
God watch between us one and all,
God watch between us ;
Mizpah our seal, our seal and sign.
Farewell! farewell!
God watch between us one and all,
God watch betw.een us one and all,
Till we another year shall meet,
And welcome thee and thine.


Farewell, we utter soft and low;
The summer’s heat, the winter’s snow,
Will bring again our day.
Now, thro’ the year still veil’d from sight,
We’ll strive to serve the Lord aright,
With love His care repay.
Farewell! farewell, &c.
Farewell to-day, but oh, the time
When, in a better, fairer clime,
That word shall be unknown !
When the great 801 l is called at last,
And, earthly joys and sorrows past,
We’ll meet around the throne.
Farewell! farewell!
God watch between us all!
M. F.
Benediction.
Of Thy love some gracious token
Grant us, Lord, before we go;
Bless Thy Word which has been spoken,
Life and peace on all bestow.
When we join the world again,
Let our hearts with Thee remain;
Oh, direct us,
And protect us,
Till we gain the heavenly shore,
Where Thy people want no more.
Thomas Kelly.
Faith, that mountains could remove,
Tongues of earth or heaven above,
Knowledge—all things—empty prove
Without heavenly love.
Though I as a martyr bleed,
Give my goods the poor to feed,
All is vain—if love I need:
Therefore give me love.
Love is kind, and suffers long;
Love is meek, and thinks no wrong;
Love than death itself more strong:
Therefore give us love.
Prophecy will fade away,
Melting in the light of day!
Love will ever with us stay:
Therefore give us love.
Faith will vanish into sight;
Hope be emptied in delight;
Love in heaven will shine more bright:
Therefore give us love.
Faith and hope and love we see
Joining hand in hand agree;
But the greatest of the three,
And the best, is love.
From the overshadowing
Of Thy gold and silver wing,
Shed on us, who to Thee sing,
Holy, heavenly love!
Christopher Wordsworth.
62 Full Salvation!
61 Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost.
Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,
Taught by Thee, we covet most,
Of Thy gifts at Pentecost,
Holy, heavenly love.
Full salvation I full salvation 1
Lo ! the fountain opened wide,
Streams through ev’ry land and nation
From the Saviour’s wounded side.
Full salvation 1
Streams an endless crimson tide.


Oh, the glorious revelation!
See the cleansing current flow,
Washing stains of condemnation
Whiter than the driven snow:
Full salvation!
Oh, the rapturous bliss to know!
Love’s resistless current sweeping
All the regions deep within;
Thought, and wish, and senses keeping
Now, and every instant, clean;
Full salvation 1
From the guilt and power of sin.
Life immortal, heaven descending,
Lo! my heart the Spirit’s shrine;
God and man in oneness blending—
Oh, what fellowship is mine!
Full salvation!
Raised in Christ to life divine!
Care and doubting, gloom and sorrow,
Fear and shame are mine no more;
Faith knows naught of dark to-morrow,
For my Saviour goes before:
Full salvation!
Full and free for evermore.
Benediction.
May the grace of Christ our Saviour,
And the Father’s boundless love,
With the Holy Spirit’s favour,
Rest upon us from above!
Thus may we abide in union
With each other and the Lord;
And possess in sweet communion
Joys which earth cannot afford!
John Newton.

If any little word of mine 32 There are lonely hearts to cherish .. .. 40
In full and glad surrender 24 Thou didst leave Thy throne .. ..45
Is thy cruse of comfort failing? .. ..7 Throw out the life line .. .. ..31
It passeth knowledge 38 Tis a true and faithful saying .. .. 58
Jesus, lam resting 1 True-hearted, whole-hearted .. ..47
Jesus, Sun and Shield art Thou .. ..57 Victoria for Christ 15
Jesus, Thine all-victorious love .. ..49 We come unto our Fathers’God .*. ..6
Let me come closer to Thee .. ..26 We covenant with heart and hand .. .. 50
Like a river, glorious 16 We have heard the joyful sound ..23
Looking upward every day 34 when we walk in the Lord 62
Lord, speak to me .. ~ ~ ~ 48
