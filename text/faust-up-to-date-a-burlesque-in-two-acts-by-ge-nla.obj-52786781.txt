Chorus.
To each show
If we’d go
To and fro
We must hurry,
At the fete
In the great
Ex-hi-bi-ti-on.
(Student.)
Everywhere
At things rare
We can stare,
If we scurry
Through the fete
At the great
Ex-hi-bi-ti-on.
(Tarantella Boys and Girls.)
Taran. This way to the nimble marionettes,
There one to the gladiator gets.
Here’s the switchback—let us have a ride,
Hi! Conductor ! Room for two inside ?


Lo ! the Tarantella i ’Tis a dance Italian™
Tra. la. ia, la, la, ia,
Tra, la, la, la, la, 3a !
None, ah,.none can do it like a true Neapolitan j
Bnt if yon would like to try, why, of coarse you cam
Tra. ia, la, la, la, ia! etc.
Boys' Chorus.
One day, as I was walking
Down in the lane with Bella,
She patted my head
And stammered and said—■
“You are a nice young fellah ! ”
I took her to a cafe
Dejeuner to procure—ah !
She’d cutlets and peas
And Camembert cheese
And sherry and Angostura.
Men. That fine girl had sherry and Angostura ?
Crowd. Ohi, their nimble fingers certainly must be sore,
With thumbing so,
And strumming so,
All the livelong day.
Eh, you mandoiinists, timidly we implore
Cease thumbing so,
And strumming so,
Those guitars you play.
(Dance by Tarantella Boys and Girls.)
Wag. What ho ! there, Kelner, bring more lager beer,
My fraulein’s thirsty, ain’t you, Totchen dear ?
Another, another, and another still!
You’ll join us, Dormer ?
Don. Wag, why, of course I will.
At Young and Jackson’s, Wagner stood us wine.
Wag. He can’t afford it !
Don. Where is Valentine ?
Wag. , He starts co-morrow in the war to fight,
To say good-bye he will be here to-night.
See, here he comes. Salute our comrade dear.
Vai.. Play eight more bars to bring me down,
I’m here.
Wag. Hurrah for Vai, who fights at duty’s call—■
Our soldier brave !
Val. Thanks, comrades, one anti all.


Don. We’ll drink your health, if you’ve a generous heart*
Val. Yes ; though I stay with you I like to part.
Come to the bar, I like one I must own.
E’en in my music there’s a bar-y-toae.
Song—“ Our Society
We’ve joined a new Society, the oath I took to-day,
In which the members are employed in giving things away'.
Suppose we quarrel with a mar,, it causes no surprise
If he goes home the owner of a pair of new black eyes.
We give ’em away in our Society,
We give ’em away in large variety,
Black eyes of every shade, every size, and ready made,
We give ’em away in our Society.
Elsa. Valentine ! Valentine !
Val. Ah, sweet Elsa, idol of rny soul!
I love thee while the endless ages roll,
While worlds and empires crumble in the dust.
(Another of these blessed buttons bust!)
Let Venus, Hebe, Flora, hide their faces,
Before your charms—and now I’ve broke my braces.
Wag. Good old fourteenth of February 1
Elsa. My soldier hero, thee I fondly greet!
Val. My popsey-wopsey, where is Marguerite ?
Elsa. You only think other, and not of me.
Val. Don’t cry, mein Fraulein, bride that is to be,
I am her guardian and must do my duty ;
But still, of course, I have an eye for beauty.
Now, don’t be jealous,
Kat. She would be if she knew
How many other girls are mashed on you.
Val. Good old fourteenth of February !
Wag. See, who comes here, who looks so old and feeble,
And leans upon that rascal, Siebel ?
Val. ’Tis Doctor Faust, gone dotty altogether—
He reads the stars and prophecies the weather.
(Old Faust and Siebel.)
Faust See, Siebel, see, that inky cloud again
That grows and gathers. It is going to rain.
Sie. Ah ! wondrous master, you’re a clever fellah,
And we’ve forgot to bring an umbereller.
Faust. Good gracious me 1 what means this row and ruction?
And I’ve brought Siebel here to gain instruction.
Look at that girl, I swear I saw one wink.


Wait. Your ordm, gem.
What will you take to drink r
Si;;. Gin sling.
Faust, Nothing for me ?
Elsa. Not e’en a sweetheart rare,
With whom to talk and spoon around the square 1
Faust. Go away.
Ka.t, Or such a captivating thing as this—
Some one to idolise, to dress and kiss.
Faust. Police!
Elsa. Do rake something, or at you all will snigger }
Blue ribbon coid.
Faust. You are requested not to touch the figger.
Tot. There’s such a nice blue grotto here to see.
Sie. A nice blue grotto ? Come along with me.
Faust. Come back, you rascal, or with rage I’ll burst.
Sie. Come back ! Not hie. If you should get home first
Leave out my supper, and shut up the flat,
And put the latchkey underneath the mat,
Omhes. Ha, Ha, Ha I
Tot, Won’t you come, too ?
Faust, She’s really very nice.
Val. I shall just go and tell your father of this.
Faust. I’ll just give you some fatherly advice.
Omkes. Ha, Ha, Ha f
Faust. The pretty souls, the darling little pets!
Hark ! there’s the music ! ’Tis the Marionettes 1
(“To each show, if we’d go.”)
Faust. I see now, why they said we’re depressed,
Cash is so scarce, the girls are but half dressed ;
An aged moralist I dare not scoff,
Or as to clothes, I say, they’ve got ’em off.
Ten thousand lights, which through the foliage gleam,
And over all the switchback reigns supreme—
Such vanities, .of course, I treat with scorn—
I’m old and feeble, weary and forlorn ;
Yet, were I young, and had a mind to mash,
Me thinks ’twere here that I would spend my cash.
If I were young ; Oh, for the vanished bliss,
The amorous sigh, the long, the lingering kiss,
The bright eye’s glance, the pouting lips of red !
Oh, days of rapture, days for ever fled S
’Mid these gay scenes, where love and laughter reign
I’d give my soul to be a youth again.
Meph. That’s right 1 I’m down, the blessed thing ain’t bust!
It’s all right when you’ve done it, but you’ve got to doit fust ;




My good old Faust, your wicked wish I’ve heard ;
The bargain’s struck, I take you at your word.
Faust. The Devil!
Meph. Yes, my card.
Faust. Do you know that’s forty shillings, or a month ?
Meph. Very well! You have the month, and I’ll have the
forty shillings.
Yes, my name you seem to know.
Faust. Tell me your business quickly, and then go.
Meph. I’ll take your soul and give you back your youth.
Faust. Transaction’s fishy.
Meph. Yes, ’tis that forsooth !
But wealth, youth, love I offer. Quick, decide!
Faust. Youth ! Love ! How will you take your soul, sir ?
Meph. Fried!
Faust If I consent, you’ll make me handsome, young,
Give me a high old time the girls among,
Give me nice sweethearts ?
Meph. Rather, for my firm claims
To stand Al, sir, in supplying Flames,
Faust. He tempts me sore, a loveless life I’ve spent,
O’er musty tomes grown grey and old and bent,
A word from me, this life’s mistake repairs—
You haven’t got a-er-sample of your wares ?
Meph. A pattern girl ! I'll show you one toutc suite.
The maidenly and modest Marguerite !
Of Nuremberg the pearl, the dove, the rose,
She’s taken prizes at Six Barmaid shows.
Faust. A barmaid, hum !
Meph. You don’t object to barmaids, surely ?
Wait till you see her, as she sits demurely
In maiden meditation fancy free,
A new Virginia, mixing S. and B.
I am sure you would like to see her.
Faust. Yes, I should.
Meph. A Gaiety revival I’ll unfold,
And since you would be young —Behold !
What do you think of her ?
Faust. She’s rather good,
Some sweet maid, Marion.
Meph. Sweet maid, Marion Hood.
Song.
Marg. I’m a simple little maid.
Of the swells I am afraid,


I tell them when they’re forward, they rmist mind what they're
about.
I newer go to balls
Or to plays or music halls,
And my venerable mother always knows when I am out.
Faust & Meph. She never goes to balls
Or to plays or music halls.
And her venerable mother always knows when she is oat.
Marg. When I leave my work at night
I never think it right
To talk to any gentleman I haven’t seen before.
But I take a ’bus or tram,
Like the modest girl I am,
For I know that my big brother will be waiting at the door,
Faust & Meph. Oh ! she takes a 'bus or tram,
Like the modest girl she am,
For she knows that her big brother will be waiting at the door!
Marg. I am a simple, a simple little maid,
Of the swells I am afraid, afraid,
I am a simple little maid.
Faust. How pure ! how innocent! Sweet Marguerite !
Behold me here a suppliant at your feet.
Makg. Go on, you wicked old man, go home to your wife and
family ; .you ought to be ashamed of yourself, at your time
of life.
Faust. Close me up, please. It’s my night off early, and I’ve
got an appointment in the grounds.
Marg. You wicked old man! Take that home to your
missis, it will do her good.
Faust. Good-bye, my pet ! I’ll meet you later on the switch-
back. I say, does she keep a public house down there ?
Meph. A public house, indeed i You old idiot, you’ve spoilt
any chance you ever had there; she’ll never look at you
again.
Faust. She wasn’t angry with me, was she ?
Meph. Yes, she was ! Very angry !
Faust, Yes, but you’re not angry?
Meph. Yes, lam ! I’m in a devil of a temper.
Faust. And so am I■! Rage, fury, and despair i The hussy
bold I
She called me wicked and she called me old !
My jealous fury knows henceforth no bounds,
I’ll stake m 3? life
She’s gone to meet a fellow in the grounds!


Meph. You’re jealous ! Well, these grounds, it seems to roe,
Are quite sufficient grounds for jealousy.
But come, cheer up, there's no need to despond,
The girl is yours if you but sign this bond.
Faust. The bond I Ah, sweet hope 1 I'll not resign it,
Give me the bond and witness how I sign it.
There’s no occasion to read this.
Meph. Why not?
Faust. Why ! because it's red.
With my heart’s blood, I sign this bond of fate.
Meph. I claim your soul at twelve months after date.
Faust. What no you call this document so strange.?
Meph. In banking terms —“ This sole bill of exchange.”
Faust. ’Tis done ! Now, fiend, at once perform your part,
Help me to storm that little minx's heart;
Take age, grey locks, and wrinkled brow away,
And leave a masher, handsome, young and gay.
Meph. You’d like to be a masher, you shall be a masher; now,
what sort of a figure would you like ?
Faust. Figure!
Meph. You must have figure, you can’t go about without a
figure,
I’m sorry I haven’t got any pattern book with me, but
Faust. Doesn’t matter, if you could manage to get me a
figure to suit all weathers, I think that would do.
Meph. A figure to suit all weathers, you’d better have a water-
proof figure, will you have it tall or medium ?
Faust. Medium, I think.
Meph. Certainly i John, one medium figure on order. Would
you like it stout or slim ?
Faust. Half-and-half will suit.
Meph. Very well, one half-and-half with it. And now, how
about eyes ? What color would you like ?
Faust. I think I’ll leave that to you.
Meph. Very good. Now, how would you like blue ?
Faust. Blue ?
Meph. Yes ! Blue is a very fashionable color this year; we’re
selling a lot of blue this season; or would you like
- brown ?
Faust. I think the brown would suit me better than the blue.
1 think it a softer color.
Meph. Yes ! it would suit you being softer. How would you
lijce bir.CK
Faust., A nice sparkling black would do admirably.
Meph. There are several shades of black. Weil, you’ll decide
on the black ones,
Faust. Yes, I’ll have the black, ’tins.


Meph. You’ll have two lovely black eyes. Come on then. Oh I
I forgot, why not have hazel eyes ?
Faust. Hazel ; nice color hazel.
Meph. Yes! they always fetch the girls.
Faust, Then I’ll have them.
Meph. Very good, sir, your haze! eye order can be hazeleye
complied with, and what sort of expression would you
like ?
Faust. Expression ?
Meph. Yes.
Faust. I should like to get a dreamy, loving, sort of expression,
a-a-er-sort of a meet me round the corner, sort of expres-
sion.
Meph. I’m afraid we shall have to send abroad for that—but
if you don’t mind waiting a week or two. Now let me see,
the usual Faust costume, I presume, we are turning out
some very good ones now, at. 32/6; and you’ll want a new
coat; you’d better have a coat of Aspenall’s Enamel; it will
make you beautiful for ever.
Faust. I think I should prefer to be a little more “Up to
Date.”
M eph. Right you are, sir ! I think I know what you want now,
and will turn you out complete. Our toute ensemble defies
competition. Orders executed with punctuality and des-
patch, at the lowest possible prices.
Faust. If they’ve been sweated they won’t do at all.
Meph. I’ve knocked off sweating, thanks to the Trades Hall.
We don’t allow of sweating, don't you know,
Not e’en in my little factory—down below.
Now, are you ready.
Faust. For a drink. Yes!
Meph. A drink? No. Stand where you are; you’re going down
there.
Faust. Down underneath there. I say, do you think I shall
meet anyone I know down there ?
Meph. Yes ! You are sure to see a lot of your acquaintances
down there. Now, are you ready ?
Faust. Yes! quite ready.
Meph. Attend, ye spheres !
Here, Phillips, some music, quick !
Blood-curdling, and suggestive of Old Nick.
Thanks, that will do.
More thunder, lightning, and the raging storm.
From death and age, to life and youth Transform ’
Meph. Exit old Brimstone, enter youthful Treacle,
You’ve shed your Hide, and now you’re Dr. Jeckyll,


Faust. X’m young again,.l know, I feel I am.
Oh, hip fiooray ! but this is real jam S
Come on, old man. don't stand there like a dunce,
But let’s be off upon a spree'at once.
Duet and Dance.
Faust and Mephistopheles,
Faust. So, come along, old fellow, please, and trot me up and
down,
Arid show me all the pretty things that are about the town,
Meph. I’ll show you every novelty that on the earth is found.
You’ll see some sights to startle when the devil shows you
round.
Chorus.
Both. So now we’re prime
For a high old time,
The fun in the town to see ;
So start away
Without delay
We’re out upon the spree,
Faust, To every city in the world we’ll pay a passing call,
And finish up in London, that’s the wickedest of all.
Meph. I’ll show you youth and beauty, too, and life in every
StEg'Cj
You’ll have a knowing servant when Mephisto is your page.
Chorus.
Meph. I’ll show you all the sights and wonders without end;
For everywhere I’ve planted schools, from Kew to Yarra.
Bend.
Faust. You’ll find a willing pupil, sir, and ready one in me,
We will rolic and we’ll frolic and set oat upon a spree.
Girls’ Chorus.
Sing and dance, bright eyes glance,
■Join in a laughing chorus ;
Let time fly, hope beats high,
Pleasure is ail before as.
What does it matter when hearts are young ?
Merrily'let the song be sung.
Our joys are many, oar cares are few ;
But our lads all know that our hearts arc true.


SIE. Here, doctor, doctor, save me if you please,
This girl has- had six lunches and three - teas,
A dozen cakes, and hiilfui-dozen ices,
I can't stand more at Exhibition prices,
Kat. I’d like a pretty bracelet for mv neck,
Elsa. And I your signature upon a cheque,
Sie. You girls will drive me mad, wild stark,
Do you suppose that I’m a Joseph Clark.
Elsa. Well, I’ll take a
Tot. Gracious, how you talk.
Let us take something nice
Sie. Oh ! Take a walk.
Tot. Buy me some gloves !
Kat. I want some acid drops !
Elsa. Some lemonade !
Sie. You’ve had six ginger pops.
Elsa. I want a bun and some Italian wine.
Omnes. And then you ought to take us all to dine.
Sie. I’m stoney-broke, I’ve got the knock of knocks,
I’ll have to milk the baby’s money-box.
Dance,
Mar. Where is my brother ? Where is my Valentine ?
He knows to-night that I am off at nine.
On all my movements, bother him ! he spies,
Last night he gave the Shifter two black eyes.
I never see a swell and try to mash him,
But up comes Val, and threatens that he’ll thrash him.
Faust. ’Tis she ! Oh, lady fair, or radiant star !
Can you direct me to the nearest bar ?
Mar. lam no lady, sir, nor am I fair.
Faust. Not fair, and yet you are my fate, I swear.
Mar. Please don’t ; I know you not, so let me go.
Faust. Won’t you come for a walk this evening ?
Mar. No !
Faust. S’m other evening ? To-morrow evening, p’raps ?
Mar. My brother doesn’t let me walk with chaps.
Faust, I’ll call upon your brother, if I may.
Mar. He’ll call on you, if you don’t go away.
Don’t follow me to find out where I live;
It is a thing I never should forgive.
If you are seen near N uremburg Square,
My brother’s sure to hear that you’ve been there.
They’re awful gossips who, next door to me,
Have the first floor at No, 23.


Faust. Sweet Innocent! how artlessly she gives.
These full directioxis as to where she lives !
I'll call to-morrow.
Mar. I’m not off at nine.
.Faust. Then later.
Mar. Yes.
Faust. Good-bye.
Meph, The girl is mine.
Duet—Faust and Marguerite..
Faust. It fills my heart with silent pain
To part, my love, with thee ;
Will you not meet me once again
Beneath the Linden Tree ?
Mar. No, not beneath the Linden Tree
For there the shadows fall,
And with a lover I must be
Within a neighbor’s call.
2,
Faust. The nightingale to-night will sing
The moon will light the sky,
The bat will flap his dusky wing
And ghostlike pass us by.
Mar. The moon would hide behind a cloud
The stars would leave the sky,
And I should have to cry aloud
When there was no one by.
Chorus.
Mar, ’Tis wrong to woo me so.
Faust, Oh ! pray don’t go, don’t go.
Mar. My own true love, good bye.
Faust. Say not good bye, good bye.
Val. Ish alwaysh painful task to say good-bye;
You shed a tear and wet the ocher eye.
I’ve said good-bye on yonder hallowed spot
To several comrades in Scotch whisky hot.
I’ve said good-bye to friends both new and old
In brandy neat and also Irish cold;
But e’er I seek the far-off foreign shore,
I’d like to say good-bye a few times more.


Val. So name your drink, ray brave, devoted band,.
Although I’m seated, you must let me stand.
Val. May we not be as we used to be of old.
Kat. No, sir ■ I’m not to be mashed after others,
When other girls have spooned with my beau,
And he returns to me, my answer’s—No !
Val. But won’t you sing and dance as long ago ?
Kat. Well then, I will, because I couldn’t say No I
Song.,
Elsa. You’re a nice Valentine, Ido declare S
Val. What is the matter with you, ma chere f
Elsa. Your share ! You haven’t paid your share as yet,.
I’ve paid for both.
Val. Lef purse at home, my pet.
Wag, This is some club swell on the mash.
Don. And yet he doesn’t seem to have much cash.
Val. I’m awful dry, you know.
Elsa. Awful dry hash.
Do come along and leave that drinking crew.
Val. I have to meet a man.
Wag. He’s met a few !
Elsa. Then our engagement’s broken off, that’s flat.
Val. Good-bye, my dear, one kiss.
Elsa. Take that ! and that!
Omnes. Ha ! ha ! ha
Meph. Bravo, bravo ! You all seem nice and hearty.
Any objection if I join your party ?
Val. I never drink with strangers.
Meph. Then, forthwith
I’ll introduce myself. My name is Smith.
Val. Surely you’re not the Smith, L. L.
Meph. Well, not exactly—But I don’t feel well.
Val. I’ve read your ad’s in all Australian papers.
Meph. Yes, I’m duly qualified to cut capers,
At pills and parliament I take odd snatches.
Val. Oh, what a smell of common sulphur matches!
Meph. lam a match for most folk that I meet.
Val. It’s very warm here, don’t you feel the heat ?
Meph. You are no match for me.
Val. Our band he mocks i
Veph. lam a match that strikes but on the box !
Val. Stand, sir and draw !
Meph. Yes, stand and draw I will.
And what I stand draw from my private still
That’s right, my hearties, laugh and drink away*


Oknes. Give us a toast,
Mefh. I’ll 'toast you all.some day.,
SoMG—Mi'FMISTOFHLES,
.“7 Shall Have 'Em”
1.
I’m a jolly clevei fellow,-and I’m very wide awake,
And IVe studied human nature, and I’m up to ey’ry fake.
I can see through all the dodges, and I’m up to all the rigs
Of paupers and of princes, and of p'licemeu and of prigs.
I have intimate relations with the palace and the cot,
And when there's any mischief I am always on the spot.
They may think they’re very artful, and to get away may try,
But I’ve got my optic on ’em, and shall have ’em by-and-bye.
They may wriggle,-they may struggle,
But I’ve got ’em ih my eye,
And I’ll have ’em, yes. I’ll have ’em,
I shall have ’em by-and-bye.
There’s a Melbourne late land boomer, you should see him
roll his eyes— ■
He has one-upon his pockets, and the other on the skies ;
He thinks it wrong to whistle, but he sticks to lots of cash,
And ruins tens of thousands when the bubble goes to smash.
He may gang to kirk on Sunday, and about his goodness
brag,
But he’s not above a swindle, if he stands it in the swag
To impose upon the people let the canny humbug try.
I have tumbled to the rascal, and I’ll have him by-and-bye.
2,
There are barristers I know of who are eminent Q.C.’s,
Who think less about their clients than they do about
their fees ;
When they’ve taken, say, a hundred or a thousand on a brief
They will let a junior light it or their client come to grief.
There are members of .a vestry, not a thousand miles array,
Who spend in wanton gluttony the poor rates that we
pay
There’s the snug teetotal lecturer, who drinks upon the
sly™
I have booked the lot for places, and I’ll have ’em by-and-
bye.
They may wriggle, &c.




There's a well known West-end lawyer, whose money has
been lent,
To swells in want of ready cash, at sixty-five per cent.
He gets them in his clutches, like the spider does the fly,
And squeezes them, and squeezes them, until he’s squeezed
them dry.
There’s a gentleman whose custom was to go to every race,
But the Jockey Club have warned him, and he must not
show his face ;
On the tape he now is betting, and he thinks he’s very fly,
But he’ll take the knock directly, and I will have him by-
and-bye.
He may wriggle, &c.
Siebel, Hilda, Totchen, Elsa.
Val. Here, have a drink, you must be rather dry.
Sik. Another man he wants to say good-bye.
Meph. No, thanks, not yet, but just good, good friends to be,
Suppose, old chap, you have a smoke with me.
Val. Well, I don’t mind, although we’ve had a row.
Meph. I’ll have him by-and-bye.
Val. I’ve got ’em now.
Meph. The jim-gem cigarettes.
Omnes. Your health, old man.
Sie. This is a public statue, I declare
They wouldn’t grumble at in any square.
Sie. ’Tis fire!
Meph. I’m off!
Val. Stay, for I plainly see,
You are the devil out upon the spree.
Omnes. Down with him! Kill him! He’s a sorcerer. K’llhim!
Val. Die traitor ! die!
Meph. Put up your sword, sir, for it only tickles.
Val. We will not stand your sauce.
Meph. Then try my pickles.
You’ll find them hot, the lot that I shall mix for you.
Omnes. Death to the traitor!
Meph. Back ! Thus I transfix you !
Tableau.
Thanks ! Very kind of you all, the waxworks show—On
the right you will observe a distinguished member of the
Board of Perks, I mean Works. There’s a lovely figure.
It will give you an imitation of the blackbird ; it will now
give it. This group represents Dignity and Impudence—
you pay your money and you take your choice as to which


is which. This group in the centre represents the three
Graces —Disgrace, Goo&egrace and Candlegracc. ,W, G.
Grace is not there. Ah ! there’s a lovely figure ; this
figure represents Cupid arrived at manhood —this' is a
marvellous piece of mechanism —this is the only working
model in the show. It was imported from Hatton Gardens,
and brought up on garlic and ice cream —as I have said be-
fore, it is pure Italian. You observe, it is pure Italian. I will
now proceed to make it work. First movement : It will
now show you the ancient Roman game of the best two
out of three. His bright smile haunts me still —that smile
will continue for years unless turned off at the meter.
Chorus.
We are the glories of the waxworks show ;
We’re like the figures of Madame Tussaud.
Meph. I pull the strings
And work the springs.
Chorus.
We turn our heads, and we roll our eyes,
And we’re sometimes tickled on the nose by flies ;
We laugh, ha ! ha ! and we swear, ho ! ho !
We’re not u all happy in the waxworks show.
Meph. No one can help you, victims of my rage,
Except a woman who’ll confess her age ;
A lady who will let the fact be known
The sealskin that she wears is not her own ;
A maid who says, in spite of female scoffers,
She’s still unwed, because she’s had no offers ;
A maiden true and simple, free from guile,
Without a blemish or one female wile —
A paragon the world will never see.
Mar. lam that paragon, and they are free !
Val. Good old Free!
Concerted Piece.
Omnes. Villain, get hence, away !
Or you shall rue this day,:
For we will take you by the heels and make you dearly pay.
Mar. Don’t show the cloven hoof,
Or we will give you proof.'.


Sie. We don’t mean it for a joke you’ll find to your dismay,
All. Sorcerer, hence ! now quick, depart ?
Terrible one, away!
Verily, we will kicks impart,
Sorcerer, hence, away !
Chorus,
The devil’s sport that you have brought 3
You demon, you shall dearly rue ;
For now, you rascal, you are caught,
We mean to make it hot for you.
End of Scene 1.
SCENE 2—The Garden.
Mar. I’m Martha, and my husband’s never seen |
Though fifty, my complexion’s seventeen.
In all the versions .I’ve one role to play,
To mind Miss Marguerite while her frere's away.
You ask me why she don’t live with her mother,
And I reply by asking you another —
Where is my husband ? I often wonder if
The public know he left me in a tiff,
And not a single word from him I’ve heard
Sine. Marguerite’s mother also disappeared.
Not that I draw conclusions, oh dear, no !
The gents who wrote the opera made them go.
And Goethe lets the gentleman in red
Inform me briefly my old man is dead.
These details show my characters not shady,
I am a widow and a perfect lady,
Sie. Is Marguerite in ?
Mar. She is.
Sie. Then go and say
I’ve come to offer her a nice bouquet.
Mar. I beg to state this garden, sir, is ours,
And visitors are requested not to pick the flowers.
Sik, Too many feet, that line, ma’am, doesn’t scan.
Mas, Too many feet ? then keep yours off, young man,
Sie. There's a fine nosegay, and don’t cost me a tarden,
I’ll pick them here in Marguerite’s own garden.


Choeds—Mephisto and Faust.
Meph. Come in, my boy, «tts is her place.
Faust. It is a lovely place.
This is her home ! Oh, bliss 1
I shall not find a better chance than this,
In vocal numbers to address my bride.
Meph. Do so ! I’ll ride at anchor on the O.P. side.
Sie. Here are the flowers !
Faust. Who’s this, a rival beau ?
Meph. No, he’s a Goethe masher ; let him go !
Mar. A gentleman to see me ; can it be,
The handsome stranger who accosted me ?
That he would try and find me out I knew,
He’s found me in.
Oh, is it only you ?
Sie. Oh, Marguerite ! haven’t you a word ?
Mar. Oh, go away, and don’t be so absurd.
Sie. I love you Meg, I’ll love you till I die.
Mar. Oh, take a run !
Sie. I see! You’ve other fish to fry.
Mar. You don’t suppose a lad like you I’d wed.
It’s time that little boys were all in bed.
■'Go home to your mother dear.
Sie. A boy! she called me boy ; but be revenged I can,
The time will come when I shall be a man.
Though at me now the little darling glowers,
Her heart may soften when she sees my flowers.
Have I a rival ? Yes, I have, I fear,
I’ll wait and watch for his arrival here.
Faust. Help rne, Mephisto, I’ll a present make,
That from all other presents takes the cake,
In love and war all things they say are fair,
And jewels are the things a girl to square.
Meph. Your order’s booked. Behold, the gems are here!
All the first water, free from fleck or flaw,
The finest jewels Drummond ever saw,
All fine and large, of perfect cut and shape.
Faust. All best Brazilians ?
No, they’re from the Cape.
This Cape.
Mar. I wonder how it is I can’t forget
The words of that young gentleman I met.
His underiip has that peculiar curl
That marks the marquis or denotes the earL
And when he spoke, instinctively I knew
His birth was ancient and his blood was blue.


What: was his name ? How foolish not to ask it I
Oh, good gracious ! what a lovely casket 1
When did it coxae ? My brain is in a whirl.
See! here's a card, which says, “ For a good girir’
I’m glad I’ni good, and if the sender will
Send more of these, why, I’ll be belter still.
Oh, won’t the other girls be nice and riled !
I’ll wear the lot and make them jolly wild.
This pair of earrings ; oh, what charming taste;
Suppose that after all, they’re only paste.
Oh, no, they’re real, I’m sure, I know the others,
They’re not a bit like those cheap ones of mother’s.
If I’d a mirror—
Meph. Right you are, my lass,
I like to stand a pretty girl a glass.
Mar. O, goodness gracious ! Isn’t this surprising ?
It is enchantment! see, the glass is rising.
Meph. The glass is rising, and she’s settled fair.
Mar. Shan’t. I look lovely, when these gems I wear?
Faust. See how she smiles, the gems have won her heart.
Mar. Now for the song,-as usual in this part.
She’s got ’em on ? No, no, that’s surely wrong!
I want an operatic jewel song.
That’s better.
Jewel Song.
Marguerite, Faust and Meph.
Mar. What a charming bracelet,
What a pretty ring !
For a pretty maiden, it is just the thing.
A string of pearls
My brain it whirls
I’ll be the envy of the girls.
A sweet device
These gems of price
They’re awfully, awfully, awfully nice.
Faust and Meph. She’s awfully, awfully, awfully nice.
Mar. What a pair of bangles to put round my arms!
W hat a lovely locket and a bunch of charms !
Here’s a watch and here’s a chain.
I 'will never wear a common silver watch again.
Won’t they stare,
Won’t they glare,
When all these gems I wear,
Faust. Don’t yon dare,
Or you’ll make me swear.




Mar. What a chance !
Won’t they glance
When I join the mazy dance ?
Faust. What a glance
How I like to see her dance.
Mar. At the ball
One and all,
Before me they will fall.
Faust. Like them all
Beneath her sway I fall.
Mar. With this mien
When I’m seen
I shall reign as Beauty’s Queen.
Faust. When she’s seen as Beauty’s Queen.
Faust, and Meph. What a handsome necklet!
What a lovely spray !
For this lovely present, who is going to pay 2
These sapphires blue
These rubies, too —
It is a dream, it can’t be true.
Oh, what a treat!
This pendant neat,
It’s awfully, awfully, awfully sweet.
Faust and Meph She’s awfully, awfully, awfully sweet.
Mar. Oh, what a lot of beauties ! chosen with such taste
Here’s a diamond pendant, I hope it isn’t paste!
Here’s a pin, and here’s a star
They will say, “ Oh Marguerite, how beautiful you are.”
Mart. Where is that girl ? What can she be about 1
I’ve dressed the lobster, and uncorked the stout.
She ordered supper to be laid at nine,
I’m reg’lar sinking for the want o’ mine.
Here, come on, Mag ! for half an hour I’ve waited.
Mar. Don't call me Mag.
Mart. I must, I’m maggravated.
Mar. Martha come back.
Mart. Well, what is it ?
Mar. See
The lovely present some one’s left for me.
Look at these gems, they’re mine for being good !
Mart, Hush i We’re observed.
Meph. Hum ! hum ! hum ! allow me to introduce my friend,
Mr. Faust, Miss Marguerite ; Miss Marguerite, Mr.
Faust ; Faust, Marguerite, Faust.
How do you do ?
I beg your pardon,


Do I address the wife of Herr Von Schwerleia,
Who travelled in the artificial hair line ?
Mast, You do,
Meph. I'3l break it gently. Hum ■ Aval, widder.
Mast. What, me ! Go on with you, you kidder,
It’s all a trick to see if I shall fret,
I’m sure that my old man’s not dead.
Mkpk. You bet,
He died last week, your photograph caressing,
And left you as he breathed his last—
Mart, Yes, yes.!
Meph. His blessing.
Mart. How generous !
Meph, Would you like to hear some more ? Let’s go for a walk.
Allow me!
Mar. The handsome stranger. Sir,
These pretty things you sent, unless I err.
They’re much too good for rae.
Faust. Oh, weally no!
Pray keep them on, for you become them so.
Sie. This the reason, then, she snubs me so,
She’s taken on this Fitzroy Gardens beau,
In the mysterious absence of her mother
My duty’s clear. I’ll go and fetch her brother.
Mar. They are so beautiful, so large and bright.
Faust. The sparkle of your eyes outshines them quite.
Mar, These sapphires are the finest I have seen.
Faust. Ah, what I’ve sapphired for your sake, my queen.
Mar. An opal ring they say bad luck will be,
This one I opal not do that for me.
Faust. I hope not , dear ; for when I bought the thing,
I hoped it would be our engagement ring.
Mart. This gent has something for mp? private ear.
Mar. Don’t go away !
Mart. Ring! if you want me, dear,
I shall not leave the garden. Here you are,
Ring for your Martha, if he goes too far.
Do you, sir, ever think of getting married?
Mkph. I have done so, but fear too long I’ve tarried.
Mart. Oh no, you’re in the prime of life,
And not bad-looking ; you should take a wife,
Would you hot wed if you a spouse could meet ?
Mspk. Well, where 1 live she might not like the heat.
Mart, With one I loved I would go anywhere.
Meph, Oh, you saucy cuckoo, you ! The old girl is going to
mash me, I do declare.
Mart. Darling S


Meph. I beg pardon ; Yes, darling ?
Mart. What’s the matter, darling ?
Msph. Nothing, darling ■ Only darling, darling I
Mart. Do yon know I feel I could listen to yon for ever,
Meph. Oh, you may have an opportunity of doing so one o-
these days.
Mart. Do you know your face seems so familiar to me.
Meph. I dare say, I dare say 1
Mart. Do you know I seem to know your face so well —I
wonder where I’ve seen you ? Was it —was it at. a “ Home
Rule ” meeting ?
Meph. No, I think not. I like things a bit warm myself,, but
a Home Rule meeting , that would be a little . too hoi, e ven
for me. No ! not there, my child 1 No, I don't think we
have met before, bat I hope we shall meet again—" home
day, some day.”
Mart. I wonder what Marguerite can be doing ?. She’s

You pet! you darliiig, you G.O.M.
Mart. What’s that ?
Meph. Good old Martha !
Mart. I must go.
Meph. Your name is Martha, is it not ? Let me pour forth my
confession of love into your ear, , Let me, let me, tell you
how much I love you.
Duet —Martha and Mephisto.
Meph. You’re a charming little widow,
But you must not be so coy.
Mart. Why my hand so does he press it ?
Oh, you naughty, naughty boy,
Meph. You’ve a dimple when you’re smiling
That no mortal can withstand.
Mart. Oh, you mustn’t hold my fingers,
And you mustn’t kiss my hand.
Meph. There’s not a soul about, love,
Won’t you kiss me now ?
Mart. Oh, no, that is a liberty
I never could allow 1
Ensemble.
Meph. A shy, coy look from the corner offer eye,
A drooping of the lashes, and a pretty little sigh,
A gentle little squeeze.
Mart. Oh; douVsir, if you please.
I’m aft aid there is somebody looking.


Msfh. Touts the crummiest of widows
That I ever yet have met.
Mast. Would you like to take my lodgings ?

I love you madly
Mar. ■ Oh ! is this some dream ?
Faust. One kiss of love.
Mar, Be quiet, or I’ll scream,
Alas ! he holds me in the way, I’ve heard,
The serpent fascinates the frightened bird.
Faust. Here is a special license, fly with me 1
A priest is handy, we can married be.
What is your answer, darling ?


Mar. Can’t you guess ?
Faust. You’ll fly with me at once, and marry—

Val. For impudence, young chap, you take the cake.
Mar. I will not give him up !

A ward in Chancery I’ll make of you, my dear !
Knock up the Chancellor and bring him here.
Faust. I will not give you up.
Mae. I will be true.
Meph. Trust in the Devil, he will pull you through.

Mar. and Faust, Oh, love—my love —go pot away

Chorus. Take her inside, sir, and lock up the door,
She shall go flirting with mashers no more.
Safely her brother can march to the fray

No more will the hussy go out on the spree,
So lock up the door and take care of the key.
Val. Hark ! hark ! it is the drum.

Chorus. Hark ! hark ! we hear a drum,
Hark ! hark ! that bugle call, the soldiers come.
Sol, Hurrah, we soldiers come,
We march with fife and drum,
Our banners bravely fly,
Our loved ones say good-bye.
And if we should be slain
Upon some lonely plain,
We shall steer for glory,
And on the field remain. ( Repeat .)
Mar. and Faust. I will not part from you,
Though fate may so decide, etc.
I cannot say adieu,
For you are my life, my bride.
Meph. Ha ! ha ! ha ! let them march away,
Ha ! ha ! ha ! she still will be my prey.
Omnes. For we’re off to battle,
Where the bullets round us rattle.
Rat a plan ! rat a plan !
Rat a plan 1 plan, plan !
END OF ACT I.


ACT II.
SCENE 1. —Nuremberg Square.
Chorus of girls with pitchers.
Come, now, haste to the well!
There our gossips we tell,
And our tongues go pell-mell
Our pitchers as we fill.
While the water we draw,
We find many a flaw
In folks we never saw.
Our chatter ne’er is still.
The village well’s the place we choose
To chat about the latest news.
Some funny tales the gossips tell
Who gather at the village well.
A lot of wrangling, grumbling, wrangling, jangling hussies, we,
The village in our naughty, haughty way we criticize.
No single soul escapes our tongue ;
We have a word for old and young ;
We let no man or woman be
From scandal free.
A lot of mumbling, grumbling, wrangling, jangling hussies, we,
To slander both our friends and foes we are not loath.
We’d scandal mother
We’d scandal brother ;
In scandal we delight
From morn till night.
Elsa. That proud minx, Susan, lov es a chimney sweep, they say.
Chorus. Really ? Is it true ?
Elsa. Quite true.
Chorus. It’s true,
Elsa. That old dame Schweriem drinks a quart of gin a day.
Chorus. Well, I never! Ob.'
Elsa. ’Tis so 1
Chorus. ’’Tis so 1


Elsa. She might have had the decency,’she might have had
the tact
From her neighbours’ eyes to hide the little fact.
But: don't say a word to a soul, my dear,
But don’t say a word to a soul,
For some folks might
Think ’twas said in spite.
Kat. So don’t say a word to a soul!
That fast Frau Goldschmidt at the parson’s set her cap.
Chorus. Really ? Is that true 7
Tot. Quite true !
Chorus. It’s true !
Kat. She’s said that she’s a widow to the poor old chap!
Chorus. Well, I never ! Oh !
Kat. ’Tis so.
Chorus. It’s so.
Tot. She must have been an idiot to think we didn’t know,
Why she left the town not many years ago.
But don’t say a word to a soul, &c.
( Repeat)
Elsa. Our glorious army, so the papers say,
Have thrashed the blacks, and will be home to-day.
My Valentine ! Oh, how I long to greet him !
Tot. Of course you’ll tell him <2//, dear, when you meet him !
Lisa. It’s nice to have a military mash,
Although he’s always rather short of cash.
Elsa. If half your little games they only knew,
While they’ve been gone, they wouldn’t speak to you.
Kat. See who pomes here with measured steps and slow.
Tot. ’Tis Martha sighing for a beau.
Hilda. She knows all about Marguerite’s capers,
Elsa. She’ll send the news to the society papers.
Kat. Let’s stay and hear what she has got to say,
Elsa. If you’ll take my advice
Omnks. Yes.
Elsa. You’ll away.
She’ll do all the talking, you’ll not have a squeak here—
No Duffier she—she’s Bent on being speaker.
Mart. Oh dear, oh dear, what -will her brother say
If he should learn that Maggie’s been away 7
It’s nigh twelve months since with that chap she fled,
She says by Mr. Kinsman they were wed.
But late last night she came home rather flurried
And said about her husband she was worried.
He’s said good-bye, his little wife embracing,
And with that foreign gentleman gone racing.


Since then for weeks she has not had a letter;
For worse she took him. now he’s turned a better.
Elsa. Halloa ! There’s Martha! Martha, is it true
That Marguerite last night came hack to you?
Mart. Suppose it is. what then. ?
Elsa. Well, we’re curious rather
To know if it’s like her or like its father.
Mart. What it ?
Girls. That it.
Mart. What next will scandal find !
Good gracious me ! There’s nothing of the kind !
Elsa. Why, in the Opera, she kills it, and goes mad.
Mart. Our Marguerite, then, isn’t half so bad
As Goethe’s heroine, for she is only sad ;
For she is spliced, which must a secret be,
Because she is a ward in Chancery,
And if found out her husband they would quod.
Elsa. Of coarse, we all believe you, don’t we, girls?
Omnes. Rather odd 1
A likely story!
Kat. res, poor thing, she pines
To wear a ring, and show her marriage lines.
Elsa. Think of another, Martha dear, to tell us.
Mart. You unkind girls, you know you’re only jealous.
But here she comes ; ask her ; she’ll answer you,
And give you beans to-night. I hope she will.
Kat. No thanks, Won’t do
For anyone to see us talking in the street
With such a dreadful girl as Marguerite.
Marg. Hulloa, girls !
Well, ladies !
Nice girls !
They shun me. Oh, why can’t I from my breast
Produce my lines and set their doubts at rest ?
No ; let them taunt me ! I will keep my vow,
And save the man I love so dearly now.
“ The Dawn of Love.P
Fond heart, fond heart, tell me why
Day ai-d night thus you sigh ?
Ah ! ’tis love. Ah, yes ! a trembling maid,
I’ll own it’s sway, it’s potent sway at last.
The flower is born that ne’er again shall fade
Till my hope and all it’s joys are past.
Oh, trembling heart.! in glad surprise
Flash out your secret to mine eyes.


Dear one, mine, I love with all my heart,
Thine am I, until life’s latest day !
Dear one, mine, my lord, my king thou art,
Thee alone I love and love alway.
Fond heart, fond heart, tell me why
Fast you beat when he is nigh ?
Ah ! ’tis love. Ah ! yes ! I know it now ;
I gaze within my darling’s glowing eyes,
He whispers low His fond and ardent vows,
And on his breast are hushed my dreamy sighs.
Oh, blushing cheek ! that did betray
The words my lips refused to say.
Dear one, mine, I love with all my heart, &c.
Song—Faust—“/« the Morning
I’ll sing of the curious sights that we seel
At night, at night.
They’re awfully funny I think you’ll agree,
At night, at night.
There’s Johnny the shopman who hasn’t much cash,
He likes with his pals to appear very flash,
So he calls for champagne, and he cuts such a dash
At night, at night.
But oh ! don’t his head ache
In the morning.
Then comes repentance with the dawning,
It’s twice its usual size,
And he’s got two fine black eyes,
And calls for half of four ale
In the morning.
Marg. What do I see ?My husband ! rapture ! joy !
But he shan’t know I’m glad, the wicked boy.
You have come back! Oh, you cruel man !
Can you, sir, look me in the face ?
Faust. Yes, I can !
Marg. You’ve cheek enough for anything.
You left me alone ; a poor neglected wife.
Faust. Young chaps, my dear, must see a little life.
Marg. You’ve seen a lot, and just see what it’s cost ;
You once had wealth, now every mag you’ve lost.
Faust. Not every mag, for still, sweet Mag, I’ve you.
Marg. Don’t soft soap me, but say what we're to do.
Faust. What do you want ?
Marg. A house, to keep my carriage,
And all my friends to know about my marriage.
Faust. We kept it dark because, for wedding you,
A ward in Court, I’d get a year —p'raps two.




Mars. To keep it dark, was hardly fair to-me.
When Valentine returns, a nice set-out-there’ll be.
iCir/'aker. y ‘
I've just got here thro’ E-’aris, from the .sunny southern shore
I to. Monte Carlo went, just to raise my winter’s rent.
Dame Fortune smiled upon me as she’d never done before,
And I’ve now such lots of money—l’m a gent.
Chorus.
As I walk along the Bois Boolong,
With an independent air,
You could hear the ladies swear
He must be a millionaire.
You could hear them sigh and wish to die,
You could see them wink the other eye
At the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo,
Me ph. Excuse the grammar, but it’s only me.
My scene’s cut out, they’ve left me in the lurch
Because it wouldn’t do to have a church.
But, wait a bit, till we get further through
Without a church you’ll see this chap I’ll do.
Maks, On our love scenes you’re always an intruder.
Me:ph. I’ve jnst dropped in to tell you of your bruder.
Marg. Mein bruder! Ach !
Meph. Oh, won’t he warm his schwester !
Faust. Don’t brood upon your bruder, should he pester,
I’ll kill him, dear !
Marg. There spoke my own brave boy !
Meph. How sweet the sight of pure domestic joy !
Marg. Here ! you’re not on in this scene.
Meph. I beg your pardon, lam on, very much on.
Marg. Get hence! You’re worse, you mocker,
Than any villain in a shilling shocker !
Meph. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Well really, Mrs. Faust,T am awfully sorry I called on
washing day, and upset you. I say, Faust, my boy, come
and dine with me, will you ?
Meph Darling, take me with you.
Meph. No, really, no, .Mrs. Faust, I am extremely sorry, but
you see they don’t allow ladies in our club.
Marg. Well, can’t I sit on the doorstep ?
Meph. Oh yes ! Mrs. Faust, you can sit on the doorstep, it
will do you good this warm weather. Now, Faust, you

the doer.

you should object,
Meph. And so am I, but I do.
Chan. It’s a very simple matter to answer any question,.,

“ I'll Raise No Objection to That."
M eph. The year nineteen hundred’s some distance from here.-,
Chan. Well, I raise no ojection to that.


Meph, Fitzgibbon won’t write any letters that year,
Chan. There’s no earthly objection to that.
Meph. Up to now that grand Board has produced only nix,
They’ve the cash and at once ought their contracts to mix
In the concrete no doubt: they are all of them bricks.
■Chan. But we’ll raise no objection to that.
Chorus, Dance and Exit.
Chorus,
We went away just twenty-two,
And have returned just forty five,
Which will clearly prove to you
That on fighting we do thrive.
The bomb-shells flew about the field,
But danger we will bravely spurn.
We made the doughty foeman yield,
Victorious we return.
They come from many a battle-field,
They come victorious from the fight;
They made the doughty foeman yield,
These men of might.

Whene’er you ride, or drive a prancing pair,
May the steam roller meet you everywhere f
May your fields grow thistles and you be fed on ’em,
May you have corns and everybody tread on 'em,

By looking at she Post Office Clock at night
May you live where, through lath and piaster walls,

There poor Maggie now must dwell,
Let her sad fate to each maiden show

And drive straight to the church.

Marg. It is. and nothing but the truth.

For one short space of love’s enthralling sway,
Gave me this bond. For this I’ll make you pay.
The: bond is due, and with relentless hate
I seize you thus, and drag you to your fate.

Faust. The opera’s over, let’s get to the end !
You go below !

Marg, I shall not part with you
’Tis fate doth so decide,
I shall not bid you
Sweetheart, adieu 1
I shall not part with you,
You are my life, my pride


I felt that I should die.
Away, away from you.

But I've got ’em in my eye,
And I’ii have ’em, yea I’ll have ’ere..

Chorus. Yes, he is a soldier born,
Val. You may blow me to bits
But I keep his wits
For I am a soldier born.
IRISH CHORUS.— Irish Lads and Lasses.
Omnes. Arrah, bedad, and it’s we are the bhoya
Who come from Tipperary
Who a colleen bawn
And a cruisken lawn,
Sweet Arrah-na-Pogue,
And tire Irish brogue
And Donnybrook Fair
And County Clare.
We are the pride of old Tipperary
So sang Brian Buroo,
And the shamrock, too,
And Saint Pathrick for Tipperary.
Hooroh, hooroh! Finale.
Le Rideau Tombe.
