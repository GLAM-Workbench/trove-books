STATISTICS FOR 1887-88.
ADELAIDE:
PRINTED BY WHILLAS & ORMISTON, FLINDERS STREET.


It has been thought advisable to publish the following
Address, as it presents features of interest, and is well fitted
to convey a vivid idea of the nature of the work on Tanna,
and of the difficulties under which it is carried on. It is
hoped the publication of this Address may help to deepen
the Church’s interest in this important Mission, and so lead
to sufficient funds being provided to carry it on. We have
been honored as a Church to make a commencement in the
way of evangelising a portion of the heathen world, and it
behoves us to persevere until success crowns our efforts*
and Tanna, so long shrouded in darkness, rejoices in the
fulness of Gospel light.
The statistics of the Church for the year ending March,
1888, and extracts from the Report of the Home Mission
Committee, are appended.
JAMES LYALL,
Convener of Foreign Mission Committee.
16th July, 1888.


BY S$V. W. CffiSY,
and Brethren—You have been good enough
JAlrJsl to ask me to address you on our mission-work in the New
Hebrides. In doing so, I assume that you have a general
knowledge of the geographical location of the New Hebrides group
of islands; and some of you are familiar with the history of our
Presbyterian Mission in the group since the year 1848. Any way,
you will permit me to state a few general facts concerning the
group of islands itself, the number of inhabitants, and the state of
the mission as a whole: —
The group itself lies within the tropics and near the centre
of what is known as Melanesia; the distance from Sydney to
Aneityum is about 1,200 miles, and about the same from Auckland.
The French possession, New Caledonia, lies between Sydney and
the New Hebrides —being 200 miles this side of Aneityum. It
may help some to get a better idea of our work if I state the com-
puted area of the group, which is about 3,500 square miles, or
equal to the half of Wales. We estimate the native population of
the group at 100,000. Three of the northern islands are
under the care of Bishop Selwyn’s Melanesian Mission. The
other islands of the group are regarded as the field of your
Presbyterian Church. We have 14 Missionaries at work in this
field ; three others have retired from active service, but two or
three new Missionaries are preparing for this field. And, through-
out the group, we have —assisting Missionaries at their stations,
working at stations under personal supervision of or
laboring by themselves as Missionaries —more than 120 native
teachers. We have fully 6,000 people under Christian instruction ;
of that number, more than 1,000 are church members in good
standing. These Missionaries and Teachers are supported, and
this work is carried on by the Free Church of Scotland, the Pres-
byterian Churches of Canada, Victoria, New South Wales, South
Australia, Tasmania, and both sections of the Presbyterian Church
of New Zealand—a real Federation that puts formal ecclesiastical


Federation to the blush. On Aneityum, Christianity is the form
of religion recognised by the whole community. The whole Bible
was translated into the language of the people, and paid for years
ago by the people. And now the people make enough arrowroot
to pay the Missionaries’ salary and expenses connected with the
Mission on Aneityum, besides keeping the Mission property on
the island in a state of repair; and throughout the whole group
the work of preaching the Gospel, translating and publishing the
Word of God, educating the people and gathering them into the
visible Church, goes on in an equally encouraging manner. I
could say much more regarding our New Hebrides Mission as a
whole, but this will suffice now.
I wish to speak now of the work of this Church in the New
Hebrides; and in doing this, we have the Apostolic example of
Paul and Barnabas rehearsing to the Christian Church at
Antioch the work that God had done with them. And so may I
do to-night; and in doing so, I give to God all the glory ! But
before I recount what God has done with us, let me say two things
once for all—lt is simply impossible to tell you to-night all that
God has done by us in the New Hebrides ; equally impossible is it
to tell all that God has done for us and for you as a Church. Let
me say also. Do not be disappointed when you hear what has
been done! If you expect to hear the thrilling story of
thousands casting away their idols and cutting down their sacred
groves, we have, let me tell you, no such story to tell. Wonder-
ful things have occurred in connection with preaching the gospel
to the heathen, lam willing to admit. Strange things may occur
again ! Strange things have occured in connection with our own
work ; but in the face of these, I must own that I am sceptical
about magazine-conversions of uncivilised heathen. The daily
trials of faith, the hard unceasing toil of Mission life, the heart-
consuming knowledge of the moral twist and sensuality of degrad-
ed people, the mental struggle with tremendous problems of truth
that will not fit into the mould of text-book theology, have led me
to feel that these stories are the products of individual fancy ; are
not compatible with the nature of things, and even border on
falsehood and profanity. While we have no such story to tell,
we can, I think, honestly show Gospel triumphs ! And if we can-
not show as much done as you expect, it is but right that you
should know the actual facts. Your Missionary has had, and
continues to have, his faith tried ; let this Church now have her
faith tried in respect to this work.
It is, as you will remember, a little more than six years since
Mrs. Gray and I left South Australia to go to the New Hebrides
to carry out your Foreign Mission scheme. In Sydney we pro-
cured our dwelling-house, a boat, and a quantity of medicine, at
the expense of this church. There we obtained also a six-
months’ supply of provisions, and such domestic articles as we
thought our circumstances required and would permit. After
these were stowed in the bottom of the hold of our Mission vessel.


and a few days before the appointed time of departure, Mrs.
Gray’s illness from typhoid fever prevented us from sailing for
the New Hebrides as intended. Our burden was lightened and
our faith strengthened by the practical sympathy of your Foreign
Mission Committee. Apart from the fruits borne by this dis-
pensation of God’s providence (God sometimes tries us not only
that He may see what we are, but also that we ourselves may dis-
cover the nature of our own metal), I recognise in this incident
the hand of God leading us to settle on Tanna—admittedly the
hardest part of our New Hebrides Mission field.
After a six months’ further stay in profitable to us
in many ways, and affording us facilities to attain new and better
equipments for our Mission work, we left Sydney for the New
Hebrides on the last day of September, 1882. To you who are
familiar with the speed and enormous tonnage of your floating
palaces, every year growing larger, swifter, and more palatial, it
will be difficult for me to convey an idea of what a trip in our 160
ton Mission schooner is like. We had three weeks of gales and
calms before we reached Weasisi in our Mission vessel, a vessel
which after all has done God’s work so well.
When delayed in Sydney on account of Mrs. Gray’s illness,
I left it to the New Hebrides Mission Synod to select our station.
Several places were nominated by the Synod with a strong recom-
mendation in favor of Weasisi. Having heard that Tanna was
such a hard field, I at first absolutely refused to entertain the
idea of going there and putting this Church to such an early trial
of faith. But the Spirit of God works upon the mind, we know
not how, and thus, I believe, it came to pass that Mrs. Gray and
I resolved to settle on Tanna, and there we have labored in your
cause, which is God’s cause too, for over five years. When we
anchored at Weasisi, we found the people willing to take a
Missionary. They sold us ground and the chief of the village
promised us protection, but how were we to live there ? The
different circumstances account for the different condition of
things in the home and foreign field, and I ask you to bear with
me—it will give a more vivid idea of what a Missionary has to
do—when I remind you that most of you, when called to your
respective congregations, had your dwellings provided, either in
a manse already built, or in an allowance for rent. No need to
lift a tool save to place your household furniture. Missionaries
in the New Hebrides have to grub out the brushwood and stones,
level the ground, carry and build in the stones of the foundation,
plumb and square, fit and nail his house together; he has to put
on his roof, fix his gutterings, set up his tanks, lay his floor, burn
his lime, plaster his walls, build his chimney, and make his own
furniture; he has to be the family physician, hymn writer,musician,
and preacher, and combine in one man all the crafts and pro-
fessions distributed among so many in civilised life.
With the assistance of three senior Missionaries and a band
of .Christian [natives, we made our house habitable in nine days.


Having put ashore our effects and brought over from the Christian
island of Aniwa a teacher and his wife and a young man as a ser-
vant, the Mission vessel and our brethren left us thus alone
amid savage people, where the Gospel had never been before
preached, and where, since then, the Gospel has been preached
continuously. Our manual labor was not at an end when the
Dayspring left us to fight our own battle. We live about six miles
from a volcano crater in a state of perpetual eruption, and one of
the benefits of having this fiery neighbour—not to speak of the
severe and frequent earthquakes that visit us or call en route —is
a steady rain of volcanic dust for about nine months in the year,
dust so fine as to penetrate through the smallest cracks, and so
corrosive as to destroy machinery, tools, timber, and household
goods in a very short time. Then the employment of native ser-
vants requires us to have a room and a place for everything and
every different kind of work. The fact that we have to store six
months’ supplies of the things you get from your butcher and
baker, your grocer and draper, your carpenter and smith, when
ever you wish them, necessitates buildings of some kind. A work-
shop has been a necessity. The same is true of houses for teachers
and servants, for goats, and fowls, and pigs—we do a little in this
line, not of choice, but of dire necessity. For these, and other
reasons I need not mention, our dwelling had to be enlarged, out-
houses and fences have been erected —the worshipping natives
built our grass church of their own free will. And if we except a
donation in money, sent from a friend in Adelaide, Mission goods
from four congregations in this city and suburbs, and a little help
from friends in Sydney, the additions to our dwelling house, our
outhouses, improvement of the ground, and the purchase of the
ground itself, have been paid for out of my own pocket. I am not
overstating the case when I say that half my salary for the last
five years has been spent on erecting what is now Mission pro-
perty at Weasisi. This work I felt to be needful, and we bore
the cost ourselves that our Mission might not seem too heavy a
burden to this Church, and so crush instead of strengthen her
faith. I mention these things now not by way of boasting, though
I might justly do that, but that I may stimulate the Church as a
whole, to be real in making sacrifices for Jesus, and to warn you
that this Church must bear this burden that I and my family
have borne in the past, so far as that may be required of it.
This efficient organisation of our station at Weasisi is a
matter of importance, but of no more use than the skeleton of a
bridge that spans a river without the planking to form the car-
riage way. The planking in this case is the acquisition of the
native dialect, and the difficult part, if I may extend the illus-
tration, was to put in this planking. We do not make these
native languages, though we are sometimes accused of doing so.
The language is there wonderfully regular, but unwritten.
Part fits to part like a perfect mosaic. But imperfectly known,
it is hard to get the parts to fit, and little wonder if one be


tempted to saw off the corner of a plank to make it fit. Almost
every new Missionary opening a new station has to face this diffi-
culty of language ;we had no exemption. To the ear unused to
these languages, words from the lips of a New Hebridean is a per-
fect jumble of sounds; patience and effort will at length dis-
tinguish words, preformatives, and suffixes. By and by the
language, with its Hebrew caste,'its complicated comparative verb
absence of prepositions, and, to us, half-expressed thoughts
becomes a channel for exchanging ideas.
Superficial critics of our Mission work charge us with the
blunder of giving these natives the Bible in their native tongue.
Why do not Missionaries teach the natives English ? they ask.
Such a question reveals ignorance of the real nature of our work
as Missionaries, and inability to appreciate important facts. To
teach natives through the medium of the English language means
teaching them English; and to do this requires the backing of
English Government and English influence—the former v e have
not had, and little of the latter compared with our native popula-
tion. On the contrary, the English language would have to con-
quer, perhaps, a dozen different languages, and a host of widely-
differing dialects, purely through the effort of one Missionary, to
500 or 1,000 people ! No such thing has occurred in history
to my knowledge, and this would be an entire perversion of our
mission as Missionaries. Our commission from Christ is to
evangelise these people, not to teach them the English language ;
to Christianise them, not to Anglo-Saxonise them ! In itself it
is a much more reasonable thing for one man to learn a native
language than it is for him to teach from 500 to 1,000 people the
English language, while he must remain more or less ignorant of
that native language. And even supposing we could teach our
natives English, here is a fact that affects our results in
evangelising the people through the medium of the English
language. I refer to the great difference in habits of thought, as
revealed in different languages. There is such a thing as think-
ing in a particular language ; and before you could get a South
Sea Islander to receive truth through the medium of the English
language, you would have to Anglo-Saxonise his habits of thought.
In his own language, we have the medium, we have means of
conveying to him any truth he, as a human being, is capable of
receiving. I would go further than this and say, that except
through the native language, it is impossible to convey to these
people at once such truths as Christianity embodies. Just now I
said at once, because the speedy evangelisation of these people is
rendered imperative by the command of Christ and the necessities
of the people. Taking the native language as our medium for
this, we adopt the most speedy method to attain our end. It suits
the natives’ habit of thought; and I need only suggest when you
will recognise the power we have over natives, when I say that
every one knows that people are most powerfully influenced by
truth spoken in their own language.


That we have no common language is one of our greatest
obstacles to the speedy evangelisation of the New Hebrides. Not
only do we find different languages on different islands, but
different dialects, and even different languages on the same
island. Tanna is no exception. Thirty miles long, by eight to
twelve wide, we reckon it contains eight to ten thousand people,
and these people speak at least four dialects, mutually unintelli-
gible to the people who speak these widely-differing dialects.
Although Mission work has been carried on among the Tannese
unbrokenly for nearly twenty years, we had to acquire almost un-
aided an unwritten dialect of the Tannese language. The first
book in that dialect was printed by myself at Mr. Watt’s press.
Since then, hymns and portions of Scripture have been translated
into the dialect of Weasisi. A Catechism has been prepared, and
matter suitable for native readers. These now constitute a book
of 36 quarto pages, printed free of charge by Mr. Watt, and bound
by myself. And in the course of next week, I hope to have a por-
tion of John’s Gospel in the hands of printers here. The cost of
printing and binding these portions of Scripture for our people at
Weasisi will be borne by the South Australian Auxiliary of the
British and Foreign Bible Society.'
Still you have not, and cannot have, a complete conception of
the nature of the work we are trying to do for you. To do so you
must think of this community with every trace of Christianity
and Bible influence blotted out —and remember that there is not a
sphere of life, not a circumstance of life, not an agency of life un-
affected by this influence. To men in this state you must super-
add centuries of consequent degradation and enslavement to evil
passions and terrible paralysing superstitions. In religion, our
Tannese are heathen—that is, they are not worshippers of Jehovah
in our fashion. Their social institutions are of the rudest kind ;
they cannot be classified according to the trades they follow ; we
have neither carpenters or smiths. Their form of government—
by small Chiefdoms, is of the most elementary kind ; they have
neither kingdom, empire, or republic; they have nothing that
can be called a system of legislation or administration of justice ;
their arts are practically nil. There is no education save oral
instruction in native tradition, and such as a person may acquire
by observation and example. In short, our people are savage
heathen. But we must not confound heathen with savage. A
Chinaman in his native state is a heathen, but he i=> not a savage,
though just now some people are minded to put him in that list.
Our Tannese are both heathen and savage. Our object is to
Cnristianise them —the civilising of them will take care of itself.
What have we done, you want to know ? If you are to esti-
mate our work fairly, you must be careful about the terms you
use in describing it. Almost every term ordinarily used
to describe our Church work in civilised lands is either inade-
quate or misleading when applied to work amongst savage
heathen. The conversion of a savage heathen, though radically


the same, must mean more than is meant when we apply that
term to one that is circumstanced in the midst of Anglo-Saxon
civilisation. Not only must we he careful about our terms, but
we must guard cur very thoughts—they are apt to be twisted by
our nationality. We are so familiar with all that is English, we
are apt to think anything not English is strange, unnatural, and
even wrong. It is English to dress from head to foot, a thing
in itself extremely barbaric. And when an Englishman sees a
man with no clothing save a girdle of calico, and is told that the
man is a Christian, he is astounded. The first New Hebridian
Christian I saw had only one leg to his trousers, and the rest of
his garments were in keeping with his trousers. But when we
have learned to distinguish between the true effects of divine
life in a man and his imitation of Anglo-Saxon modes of dressing,
we look upon our natives as decently clad when girded with a
fathom of calico. When a man is converted to God his personal
identity remains. Convert a heathen and his nationality remains.
Yea, his habits and modes of life remain so long as they are not
inconsistent with the religion of Jesus.
These differences, if I may so call them, must be taken into
account in forming an estimate of our work. Then we must re-
member that the progress of goodness, though the rate of speed is
increasing, the progress of goodness is slow ! In the individual
and in the community it is like the flow of the tide —a series of
little ebbs and flows—the extent of the flow can only be measured
after a time; so is the work of the Gospel among the people on
Tanna. Over five years ago, we went to Weasisi, and began work
among the rude unclothed heathen who were ignorant of the true
God and our proprieties of life. During the time we have been
there we have had 120 persons—there are about 2,000 persons
living within an easy distance of our Mission Station —under
religions instruction. Of this number some have died —died sing-
ing our hymns and repeating the name of Jesus, others have left
the district, others have withdrawn from the worship—this some-
times happens. The women and boys and old men and girls come
readily to worship. Men in the prime of life hold aloof. The con-
ception of the worship of Jehovah is this:—The man who wor-
ships must wear clothing and give np fighting. It is an indignity
for a Tannaman to wear clothing; in fact, he considers he is
making a woman of himself by wearing clothing, as he would do
if he came to worship ! Besides, who would constitute the stand-
ing army end do the fighting ? Then, too, when we get the boys
they may be taken from us as they grow up. Much food means
much feasting; and much feasting means much wickedness; and
a season rarely passes without onr losing a promising youth in
this way. In spite of these drawbacks, we have row two regular
services on Sunday at our home station. Once a fortnight we
have a service at two out villages—one of them six miles distant
—to which we have to walk often amid much discomfort. And at
these services we have 100 people attending. We have a prayer


meeting on Wednesday, and school every day of the week except
Saturday attended by adults and children. During my absence
this work is carried on by a native teacher. Our house is now open
and in charge of a native Christian woman; she has, therefore,
the care of more than <£2oo worth of our own property. At
different times Mrs. Gray has conducted a sewing-class for the
girls and women with fair results. The work that has been done
—and when we compare the present condition of the natives with
their state when we went amongst them first, w r e see that much
has been done —we consider to be of a preliminary nature, What
has been done forms a basis for future operations.
And now what of the future P That depends to some extent
on your estimation of the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
and the faith you exercise in God. lam this Church’s represen-
tative, I know. But not in the matter of the trial of faith in this
work. The whole Church must stand the trial of its own faith in
this matter. The Church must be convinced that the Gospel is
the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.”
We hear it said that Christianity is effete, and people seem afraid
lest they should be left stranded when the stream has run out,
like driftwood of the mountain torrent. They seem in a hurry to
sever their connection with Christianity, lest their faith remain
when the object of their faith is gone, and their short-sighedness be
made manifest. How little such people realise what the gospel of
Jesus has done for the human race, and what it is capable of still
doing. If they did, would we need to beg men and women to
come to Church and identify themselves with the Gospel of Jesus
and His Church. Fourteen hundred years ago our fore-
fathers in Scotland were rude, painted, unclothed, savage
heathen, living by the spoils of the chase, and dwelling in huts no
better than what we see on Tanna to-day. What has produced the
change we see ? Not the splendid discoveries of science, nor the
mental growth from education; not the march of invention, nor
the superiority of race or government! These will thrive only in
suitable soil. If we want soil wherein to cultivate such fruits, we
would not think of planting our seed among people conditioned
like our Tannese. These things came into the possession of our
forefathers and us after the Gospel had been preached to our
heathen and barbarous forefathers by Missionaries almost as
superstitious as themselves. What the Gospel has done for Scot-
land it can do for Tanna. But let us not be impatient with the
result of our work. Considering that most modern Missionaries are
men of more enlightenment than even St. Patrick or St. Columba,
and the like j considering that this is an age of electric speed, we
have a right to expect more and better results in a given space of
time than were found in the days of our forefathers. Still we
have no right to expect in five years, or even twenty-five years,
what has taken 1,000 years to accomplish in our own ra,ce ! Why
expect our Tannese to discard their superstitious beliefs after a
few years of Christian instruction ? Some of us believe in lucky

J. HALL ANGUS, Convener of Statistics Committee.




days and numbers, believe in burying our dead lying east and
west, and such like things !
Again, people who live in glass houses should not throw
stones! Seeing then that we ourselves have not yet been wholly
emancipated from heathenism in our faith, let us judge fairly of
the results of our work. We have savage heathen within our own
borders and of our own race. In this colony and among our own
race I have seen ignorance, superstition, dirt, thriftlessness, and
barbarism, that are not surpassed on Tanna. In some of these
the approach to absolute barbarism was very close. This state of
things would be much more wide-spread if it were not for the
children, who are brought into contact with Sunday-school in-
fluence ; if it were not for the refining energy of church-going
habits and the like, the relapse into barbarism and heathenism
would be speedy, complete, and as fully developed as it is now
among the rudest savages in the South Seas. Do we despair
because of this element at home ? We believe we have the remedy
for it in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Why despair for Tanna?
The same remedy will do for the same disease when the conditions
are the same ! The work is one at home and abroad—we have
one Gospel for the heathen here, and the same for the heathen
there! Let all join in the prayer;—
“ Spirit of truth and love.
Life-giving, holy Dove,
Speed forth thy flight!
Move o’er the water's face.
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth’s da ke-t place
Let there be light! ”


REP O R T
OF THE
HOME MISSION COMMITTEE. **
TITHK Charges at present under the control of the Home
Mission Committee are Goodwood, Bmithfield and Golden
Grove, Wallaroo, Koolunga, Jamestown and Spalding,
Woodside and Nairne, and Mannum. Of these, the two last have
been rendered vacant during the course of the year ; the former
by the translation of tne Rev. J. Macaulay to Mount Pleasant,
and the latter by the translation of the Rev. W. R. Milne to
Clare. Your Committee have been fairly successful in securing
a regular supply for the different pulpits, though often with
much difficulty from the want of available preachers. Your
Commitee, while unable to do much, have been able to do a
little towards consolidating one or two of the weaker charges
of the Church, both by slight pecuniary help and sustained
personal sympathy. It almost goes without saying, that owing
to the continued depression, no new field of operation has been
opened up. At a recent Meeting of your Committee, a set of
Rules was adopted for the formation of Missionary Associations
throughout the various Churches similar to those adopted by
the Foreign Mission Committee, and we are hopeful that all
our Congregations may in time agree to form such Associations.
The contributions to the object of the Home Mission come in
slowly and scantily, and the efforts of the Committee in doing
its work are consequently greatly impeded. The appeals and
calls and claims upon the Fund are, if not so numerous, at
least so great and so urgent that the administration of the
small moneys at our command is a matter as difficult as it is
delicate The entire sura to the credit of the Fund
at present —a sum which, small as it is, has not been equalled
for years, although it is nothing like equal to our liabilities—is
£44 3s. Bd., the Income for the year having been £93 13s. 4d.
(including a credit balance of £9 6s. Bd.), and the Expenditure
£4l 3s. Od.
