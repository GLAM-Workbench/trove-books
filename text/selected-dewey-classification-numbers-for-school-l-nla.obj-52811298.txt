THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF NEW SOUTH WALES
SELECTED DEWEY CLASSIFICATIOIT NUMBERS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
NOTE
These numbers follow the decimal classification
of Melvil Dewey* Subjects with their corresponding
numbers have been selected from his full tables to meet
school library and Australian needs, and for the actual
classifying of the Public Library’s Model School Library,
In one or two places alterations have been made, for
example, provision has been made for myths and legends
in literature and for Australian literature as distinct
from English literature. For schools too it has been
thought advisable to remove Physical Geography from
551 to 910,21 so that geographical studies are grouped
.together. But as far as possible alteration of the
classification has been avoided, and no further* alter-
ations should be made.
In any classification an attempt is made to anticipate
all likely demands on it. Subjects are included here
which some libraries will never use, and others which
they will use only as their collections grow. It is
not expected therefore, that every number will be wanted
by every library.
There must always be some choice, real or
apparent, of places in a classification, because of
the various aspects and relations many subjects have,
for example railways with an economic as well as civil
and mechanical engineering aspects. As far as possible
a ’single place’ has been chosen here, so as to supply
a simple approach, and one suited to children, to such
subjects as ’aeroplanes', ’fire brigades’, etc. No
division has been arbitrary and, if only for the sake of
consistency from school to school, the decisions which
have been made should be followed.
The numbers are in their class order with an
alphabetical index, pp, 37-52
The note at the head of this Index should be
read carefully- (page 37.)
Before any attempt is made at classifying, a study
should be made of the subject in the manuals of library
economy. If possible practice should be obtained under
skilled guidance. Before applying the numbers, read
them through paying special attention.to the notes.
Whenever possible these numbers should be used
alongside the full Decimal Classification in the latest
edition (the Il+th) or!.the Abridged Decimal Classification
in the latest edition (the 1936),

ALPHABETICAL INDEX TO D.C. NUMBERS
SELECTED FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIES
NOTE
D.C. is not a single place classification. Many
subjects have several numbers according to the branch,
aspect or relation which may be dealt with, for example
animals have a scientific or zoological, and a useful
arts, or agricultural aspect, and so there are two
places or numbers, £9O and 636, for them. The object
of this index is to display the aspects and relations
of subjects and their possible clasr- numbers. The
user must decide the class number most appropriate
to the book in hand, and he can only make his decis-
ion sure by looking at each possible number in its
numerical context. Do not classify from the index
alone.
