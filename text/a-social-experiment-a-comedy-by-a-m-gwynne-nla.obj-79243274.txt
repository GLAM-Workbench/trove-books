act i.
( Queenscliff- ?part of the Esplanade , a view of Hobson's Bay
in background showing shipping passing. A few people
strolling about at back ; a man with telescope who is gazing
through it occasionally ; seats on right and left.
Harry Farnborough and Tom Millard discovered sitting on
seat at right?both are smoking cigarettes).
Harry:
(Rising.) So you have made up your mind to leave
me, old chap?
Tom :
Unfortunately, yes. That letter I got this morning
reminds me that business must not be neglected even
for the sake of enjoying this delightful sea-air, to say
nothing of your company.
Harry :
Can?t say I?m looking forward to staying on here
alone. I shall not know what to do with myself.
Tom :
I can tell you what not to do. Don?t go in for reck-
less indulgence in exercise till you are stronger. Don?t
smoke too much ?that cigarette must be your last till
dinner-time. Don?t keep late hours. Don?t remain
in damp clothes, especially damp boots. Don?t
Harry :
There, there, old man; I?m not a baby or a girl.


Tom :
(Rising.) A baby, or even a girl, might be con-
sidered more interesting than a corpse, which is what
you were nearly becoming.
Harry :
When you found and nursed me back to life.
Tom :
I did nothing so foolish. I employed a properly
trained person to do the nursing.
Harry :
You have been kindness itself, Tom. Any expres-
sion of gratitude on my part must seem weak.
Tom :
Pooh ! My dear boy, what I have done is to repay
but a small part of my debt to your father. He was
like a big brother to me. I was his fag at Harrow,
you know. There w r as never a kinder or more generous
man. Coming out here in the early times, he was
already a prosperous man when I was packed off to the
colonies with the poor pittance which was all that
could be spared for a younger son. My relatives
left me to sink or swim?they didn?t care which?
and it was your father, Harry, set me on my feet ;
showed me how even a younger son with a thoroughly
unpractical education and tastes beyond his means
might succeed in this country. It was thanks to
him I swam.
Harry:
My father was one of the kindest men who ever
lived.
Tom :
Kind to everyone but himself, Harry. He could
make money, but never kept it. He was too gener-
ous to save. I was away in England when he died,
you know. The notice of his death in a Colonial
paper was a sad shock to me. When I returned
I naturally hunted you up, found you at a hotel in
town laid up with typhoid. The people at the hotel


didn?t want to be bothered with you?were about
to pack you off to the hospital?said they couldn?t
have you die in the house. I got a doctor who
forbade you being moved. The people wanted to
insist. I used strong language.
Harry :
And got your own way !
Tom :
And got a nurse which was more to the purpose,
and here you are, above ground still and likely to
remain above for a considerable number of years yet.
And by the bye, before I go, my boy, there?s one
little piece of advice I?d like to give you, and I want
you to promise that you will seriously consider it and
act upon it; will you?
Harry:
I shall certainly listen to any advice from you, Tom;
and?yes?l?ll promise to consider it also.
Tom :
And act on it?
Harry :
It would be churlish of me to refuse after your
kindness. Yes, I can safely promise to follow your
example in anything you advise.
Tom :
Hum ! Well, it?s not following my example in this
instance.
Harry :
vVould you set an example you would not wish
me to follow?
Tom :
Cases differ my boy. I want to see you married.
Harry :
Out of the question, my friend. Can?t afford it.
Tom ;
You want a wife to look after you. A wife would


never have left you to die of fever in a hotel, for
instance.
Harry :
A wife is among the luxuries of life I must make
up my mind to do without. That heavy mortgage
on my land is a bar to my marrying. How could
I ask any woman to share my poverty?
Tom ;
Your poor father?s generosity again. No chance
of paying it off, I suppose?
Harry:
None. The interest on it and expenses of working
the place swallow up nearly all the profits.
Tom ;
And you say you are carrying it on as economically
as possible?
Harry:
Yes. lam my own manager, with help from Bux-
ton. You remember Arthur Buxton as a boy?
Tom :
Son of the Buxton who owned so much Queens
land property?
Harry:
The same. The old man was cleaned out by the
long drought. Arthur asked me for a job?we
were at the Grammar together?so I took him on
as bookkeeper. He?s in charge now, with strict
orders to keep down expenses. Things are not look-
ing too promising about my part this season, and
I?ll be glad if we can make both ends meet. So
you see there?s little use in my thinking of a wife,
Tom.
Tom :
There?s only one thing to do. You must marry
an heiress.
Harry :
Never. I should never consent to place myself in


the position of being under an obligation of that kind
to my wife. I have too much pride.
Tom :
That?s a pity. You must not encourage it. Pride,/
Harry, you know, is a sin?at least in this case.
Harry :
But Tom, to give advice in my turn. Why have
you yourself never married?
Tom ;
A long story my boy; too long to go into now
or I shall miss my boat. (Looking off to left.) It?s
in 1 see. There?s a cab just driven up to the door
of the hotel and two ladies alighting. If I?m not
mistaken they are Mrs. Alsop and Miss Mannering ?
a very wealthy lady and her paid companion. You?re
in luck Harry. The heiress I prescribed for you
has fallen right into your lap.
Harry :
(Indifferently.) Friends of yours, Tom?
Tom :
I know them slightly?at least, one of them.
Harry:
A pity you have to go. Your lady friend will be
sorry to have missed you.
Tom :
Eh! Oh yes; perhaps. But, there, I must slip
off before she knows I?m down here. Good-bye, old
chap, and take care of yourself. My best wishes
for your success with the heiress. Play your cards
properly, and who knows what may happen. (Exeunt
Tom and Harry. While thy have been talking Andrew
Hartwood has strolled on at back and while apparently gazing
at the sea has heard the latter part of conversation. As they go
off at left , he watches them and finally strolls off at right).
(Enter Muriel and Mrs. Alsop. The latter is stylishly
dressed in black. Muriel is in a plain black coat and skirt ,
linen collar , etc., and plain black hat).


Mrs. Alsop :
My dear Muriel, I think you are so foolish not to
rest awhile. Now a cup of tea and a lie down will
set you up for dinner.
Muriel :
You dear old molly-coddle, I?m not a bit tired, and
I don?t want any more tea. I just want to have a
good look round at the world. If you had been
tied to one room with influenza for the last two
months, you?d long to be out in the air again, too ?to
feast your eyes on the sky and sea. Look at that
glorious bit of blue out there. And look at that
steamer. Doesn?t she seem to rejoice in movement,
as if cutting through the waves were the height of
happiness
Mrs. Alsop:
Perhaps the sea air doesn?t make her as thirsty as it
makes me (dolefully).
Muriel :
And it is my fault for dragging you out here, instead
of waiting for tea. Well, please don?t suffer a
moment longer. Go, dear Mrs. Alsop, and have your
tea. I shall be all right.
Mrs. Alsop:
I cannot think of leaving you here alone, my dear,
with all these people about.
Muriel :
With all these people about I shall not be alone.
Mrs. Alsop :
But, my dear, suppose anyone seeing you sitting
here, unprotected, were to speak to you?
Muriel :
I hope I should answer politely. In fact, it would
be bad manners on my part not to do so, wouldn?t
it? But don?t be afraid. You may enjoy your tea
in comfort; nobody is at all likely to want to talk
to me. They all have friends of their own to talk


to. (Sighing.) You don?t know how envious I
sometimes feel, and almost wish I were poor just to
fnow what it feels like to have real friends.
Mrs. Alsop :
My dear, you know you have plenty of real friends.
Muriel :
(Shaking her head.) How can one tell? When
people tell me I am beautiful, and my mirror says
otherwise?when, at a dance, I can fill my programme
twice over while other girls prettier and better
dancers, but poor, are left to adorn the walls ?what
tan I conclude?
Mrs. Alsop :
My dear child, for goodness sake don?t begin to
get bitter. It does make such unbecoming lines
on the face. You ought to be thankful your father
made the money to leave behind. If you were poor
you?d have some excuse to be bitter. Look at me.
I always lived in the belief poor Peter was a wealthy
man till he died, leaving me nothing but debts.
Muriel ;
And so compelled you to become chaperon to a
very discontented and selfish person. But I mustn?t
quarrel with you, for I believe you are one of the
few who really care for me for myself.
Mrs. Alsop :
Indeed, I do.
Muriel :
And I daresay Andrew would care for me just the
same, even if I were poor.
Mrs. Alsop :
I have my doubts. I should say Mr. Hartwood finds
your money as great an attraction as others. I should
say your cousin is one of those men, and there are
many of them about ?born with a chronic distaste for
hard work. They find it easier to make a living by
talking.


Muriel :
I know you have never done Andrew justice, but
that is because you don?t approve of his Socialistic
doctrines.
Mrs. Alsop :
Of course I don?t. Am I not a member of the
Women?s National League?
Muriel :
And yet I find a great deal to agree with in his
theories.
Mrs, Alsop
I don?t object to theories, my dear; they are harm-
less. It?s when these people try to put them into prac-
tice, instead of letting well alone, that the trouble
begins.
Muriel :
If all thought as you do, the world would never pro-
gress. We cannot stand still?we must move onward.
Mrs. Alsop:
But all movement is not progress, my dear. Some-
times it is retrogression.
Muriel :
Even that might be better than standing still. But
I won?t let you stay any longer, dear Mrs. Alsop, when
I know? (laughing) ?that you are dying to ?retro-
gress? to the hotel and have your tea.
Mrs. Alsop:
I wish you would change your mind, dear, and come.
I really don?t like leaving you.
Muriel :
I never change my mind, and I?ll not budge, so
ta-ta!
(Exit Mrs. Alsop. As she goes off at left , Andrew
Hartwood enters at right, and comes to hack of seat
on which Muriel has seated herself.)


Andrew :
Gone at last, thank heaven, and I can speak to
you alone. I dislike that woman immensely.
Muriel :
(Without turning her head.) Not more than she
dislikes you, my dear cousin. But what brings you
down to this part?
Andrew :
(Coming round to front of seat, where he stands
or walks about while speaking.) \ou do. I came
solely to speak to you. All the time you were ill I
called in vain. That woman refused all my requests
to see you.
Muriel :
Quit right. It is running contrary to the recommen-
dations of the Board of Health to put yourself need-
lessly in danger of infection.
Andrew :
Then I heard you were coming down, so I arranged
to hold a meeting here last night, and came down
yesterday.
Muriel :
And the meeting?was it a success?
Andrew :
A success! (Impatiently.) No, you cannot make
these dunderheads ?who won?t understand why they
should be discontented with things as they are?hear
reason.
Muriel :
Reason! But are you sure, Andrew, that what you
have to tell them is reason?
Andrew :
Isn?t the fact that the people are being robbed right
and left by the Capitalists reason? ?that they don?t
get value for the work they do, the wealth they pro-
duce ! They see the land ? their land ?alienated, in
the hands of a few robbers; and they are content to


see it, to leave things as they are, to go on in the
old way instead of rising up and driving every Capital-
ist from off the face of the earth!
Muriel :
And where do you propose to drive us to?
Andrew :
Eh! drive you?
Muriel :
Yes, us-?me. I suppose I come under your category
of Capitalist, don?t I?
Andrew :
You! (Seats himself beside her.) Ah, no! You
have never sweated the worker. You have not piled
up wealth over the graves of helpless women and
children. You have never trod underfoot the weak
and suffering. You have a heart and a will to help
the cause of humanity. You would give your wealth
to it. You have listened to me so far, Muriel; you
have gone with me so far along the road the great
Cause is marching. Let me lead you still further ?
give yourself to me, Muriel ! What might we not do
together?with my talents and your wealth !
Muriel ;
Ah ! there it is. My money. Always and always
my money. Do you know, Andrew, if that old man
there with the telescope were to ask me to marry him
this minute, and I could feel quite sure he didn?t
know I had money, I?d?well, I?d
Andrew :
(Scornfully.) You?d marry him, I suppose!
Muriel :
No, but I think I?d give him a kiss for his disin
terestedness.
Andrew :
Muriel, you know my love is untainted with any
sordid spirit. Why will you not listen? Why will
you not consent to give yourself to me, trusting my


promise to make you happy? With me you will
taste a joy of living unknown to the rest of your class
?your set , as you call it?for I can teach you how
to live for others; how to bring brightness and con-
tentment into the lives of millions of our submerged
fellow creatures.
Muriel :
Contentment! But I thought your object was to
make them discontented.
Andrew :
With things as they are?yes. With the unequal
distribution of property and the means of acquiring
wealth. But only as a preliminary to the masses
attaining their own ?the fruits of their own labour.
Then the reign of Contentment so long and hardly
fought for will begin.
Muriel :
You really believe that state of things will ever take
place ?
Andrew :
As firmly as that I am alive and am here talking
to you. Not only is it certain to come, but it will
come soon.
Muriel :
Very well, when it does come, if I?m not already
married, I?ll promise to marry you.
Andrew :
(Rising angrily.) That is unworthy sarcasm on your
part, Muriel. You have already promised to listen
favourably to me in two years? time; but how can I
wait two years? Every day I dread to hear some
other man, perhaps unworthy, has stepped in and car-
ried off the prize I have set my heart on.
Muriel :
Why press me so now? I only want to realise that I
am alive; out in the open air again after a long ill-
ness. I feel a desire to spread my wings like that


ship. I could even envy that great steamer puffing
it?s long trail of smoke to the breeze. It makes me
long to puff too. Have you a cigarette about you,
Andrew?
Andrew :
(With disgust.) No; at least not for you to smoke.
Muriel :
But surely, with your ideas, you draw no distinction.
If men smoke, why not women?
Andrew :
Other women can do as they choose, but I would
have my wife
Muriel :
(Interrupting quickly and a little haughtily.) Your
wife! Your ideas march too fast, my good cousin!
Andrew :
(Passionately throwing himself down beside her.)
Muriel, will you not give me some hope?a kinder
answer, dearest? I leave this evening. Let me go
from here with the knowledge that you will be mine.
(Takes her hand.) This little hand, my darling, is
dearer to me than all your fortune. Give it to me,
Muriel.
Muriel :
(Flippantly.) I can?t spare it. I want it myself
awhile yet.
Andrew :
(Flinging her hand from him.) And so you play
with me! You lead me on at your pleasure, and cry
halt when you are tired of being made love to. Do
you think I have no heart to suffer? Muriel, I must
have some hope. I cannot wait two years.
Muriel :
My poor Andrew, do you really love me so much?
all for myself? Then let us say next Christmas ?that
is but a few months off. If I am not married or
engaged before that, I?ll listen to you.


Andrew ;
My darling, you will never repent it.
[Enter Mrs. Alsop and Harry talking. Andrew looks
annoyed at the interruption. He and Muriel both rise).
Harry;
(Continuing conversation.) And are you here alone,
Mrs. Alsop :
Oh, no; I have a companion, Miss Mannering.
Muriel, dear, let me introduce Mr. Farnborough, who,
it appears, is a friend of a great friend of mine, lorn
Millard, whom I knew before I was married.
Muriel :
How do you do? My cousin, Mr. Hartwood, Mr.
Farnborough. (Men how.)
Mrs. Alsop : .
Mr. Farnborough is down here for change of air,
too, Muriel. I tell him you can sympathise with each
?other.
Harry :
At least we have a common ground to form an
acquaintance on. Is it not delightful down here?
Muriel :
Very. You are making a long stay?
Harry :
No; that is, yes. I had thought of leaving to-mor-
row, as my friend could not stay, and I have no great
hankering for my own society; but now
Muriel :
Now you have found someone to rescue you from
the infliction of your own society, you have decided to
remain? That is a very pretty compliment, Mr. Farn-
borough. (They retire to back conversing.)
Andrew :
{Who has been watching them with displeasure.)
Tell me, Mrs. Alsop, does that fellow know Muriel is
an heiress?


Mrs. Alsop :
Not that I know of.
Andrew :
You have said nothing about it?
Mrs. Alsop :
Not a word. Why should I?
Andrew :
Mrs. Alsop, if I give him to understand that Muriel
is companion to you, and that it is you who are
wealthy, you?ll not give me away?
Mrs. Alsop :
(Laughing.) My good man, tell him what you like.
I?ll say nothing either way. One?s poverty is not a
thing to sing about. But what are you afraid of?
Andrew :
Of Muriel falling a prey to a mere fortune-hunter.
Mrs. Alsop :
But what is it to you whom she marries? You
don?t think she is likely to marry you, I suppose?
Andrew :
She has just this moment as good as promised to be
my wife.
Mrs. Alsop :
Your wife? Impossible!
Andrew :
(Indignantly.) And pray why?
Mrs. Alsop :
Because I regard such a thing as a positive calamity
for any girl?and for Muriel
Andrew :
You are not flattering, Mrs. Alsop. But let that
pass. She has promised to listen to me seriously if
she is not married or engaged by next Christmas.
Having promised that much, it will go hard with
me if I cannot pursuade her to promise the test. Even
you have to admit she is amenable to mj influence
in many ways.


Mrs. Alsop :
I wish I hadn?t.
Andrew :
Hush ! they are coming towards us. Draw Muriel
aside for a few minutes while I tackle the fortune-
hunter ; and remember your promise to say nothing.
Mrs. Alsop :
I?m sorry now that I gave it; but I?ll keep it.
(Takes Muriel to hack of stage.)
Andrew :
(To Harry.) You have been ill, I understand.
Nasty thing typhoid.
Harry:
Very; but one ought not to complain when it lands
one in such a charming spot as this.
Andrew :
And among such charming people; eh, Mr. Farn-
borough ?
Harry:
Indeed, yes, lam in luck. I?m all the more sorry
my friend had to go to-day. Mrs. Alsop knew him
well, it seems.
Andrew :
Charming woman, Mrs. Alsop; don?t you think so?
Harry :
Very. She seems extremely kind-hearted, too.
Andrew :
She is. Would bring my cousin?her companion,
you know ?down here for change of air. Muriel is
much attached to her; wouldn?t part from her for
worlds.
Harry:
It must be a satisfaction to you to know your
cousin is so happy and well cared for.
Andrew :
It is. Having no other near relatives, I feel a sort


of guardian in a way. Her father died recently, you
know.
Harry:
Ah, indeed ! Her father. Um ! He left her un-
provided for, I suppose?
Andrew :
(Aside.) Now it is coming. (Aloud.) Poor fellow ;
it was very sad. He used to be enormously wealthy
at one time?like a great many others before the boom
burst ?but (Shrugging his shoulders.)
Harry ;
I see. Sad for a girl like your cousin to be obliged
to earn her living.
Andrew :
It is; very hard. (Aside) I think I?ve spiked his
gun.
(Mrs. Alsop and Muriel come forward.)
Mrs. Alsop :
Muriel, dear, you ought to rest. Do come inside
now.
Muriel :
I?ll sit here for awhile. (Sits on seat at right.) It
is too early to go in-doors yet. Mr. Farnborough will
tell me what there is to be seen here. There are local
attractions, I suppose, Mr. Farnborough?
(Harry sits beside her. Mrs. Alsop and Andrew
occupy another seat at left.)
Harry:
Yes, certainly, there are local attractions (mean-
ingly gazing at her). But I?m afraid Tom and I
loafed away our time instead of obediently following
the guide-book?s directions as to seeing what one is
expected to see.
Muriel :
Then how did you put in time down here?
Harry :
Boating chiefly, and fishing


Muriel :
I should love that. You must take us boating to-
morrow.
Harry :
With pleasure?if Mrs. Alsop will consent
Muriel :
Then we must see the lighthouse. I shall love a
climb up that.
Harry :
That I?m sure Mrs. Alsop will not permit. You have
been ill, remember.
Muriel :
There, I?ll go without her permission, if you will
take me.
Harry:
1 shall certainly not encourage a very self-willed
young lady to disregard her employer?s wishes.
Muriel :
(Surprised.) Employer?s! (Aside)? ls it possible?
(Aloud)? Ah, yes! of course you are right; especially
as she is so kind to me.
Harry :
I am very glad to hear you say so. Forgive me,
Miss Mannering, if I say lam interested in you. You
are so different from my idea of the typical companion
of a rich lady. Your cousin tells me he is satisfied
as to your present welfare.
Muriel :
It is exceedingly kind of him to trouble about my
welfare. Don?t you think so, Mr. Farnborough?
Harry:
Are you engaged to him?
Muriel :
To Andrew! Oh, dear, no. Did he tell you I was?
Harry:
Not in so many words, but I inferred such might be
the case.


Muriel :
Dear old Andrew! lam very fond of him as a
cousin; but only as a cousin, you know. I could
not marry a man unless I loved him more than that.
Harry:
Not even to escape from poverty ?from the drudgery
of your present life; for (pardon my saying it), however
kind and considerate Mrs. Alsop may be, you must
feel having to be at her beck and call. Forgive me
if I appear to be taking a liberty.
Muriel :
No. I like to hear you speak to me in this way.
It is different from what I am used to.
Harry:
Poor little girl! I wish I might try and make life
easier for you?more like the lives other girls lead;
girls who have their own homes, their amusements,
dances, friends
Muriel :
Alas ! I have not many friends ?real friends I mean.
Harry:
(With great earnestness.) Miss Mannering, let me
be your friend ?your real friend ?for, like you, I
have not many either. lam a comparatively poor
man, though I have not to eat the bread of dependence.
Andrew :
(To Mrs. Alsop.) I wonder what those two find to
talk so much about?
Mrs. Alsop :
Perhaps discussing microbes or comparing symp-
toms. Convalescents usually find a great deal to say
about their experiences.
Andrew :
They don?t look as if they are discussing microbes.
Harry :
(To Muriel.) And you would really care to hear
about my life in the country?


Muriel :
Indeed, yes. It is all so unknown to me. My
life has been passed in towns, you see. The life
of the bush ?the typical life of Australia?l am quite
a stranger to, though it appeals to me.
Harry:
I like to hear you say that, Miss Mannering. I was
born to it, and love it. There is no such life,
to my taste, as one lives it away up in our country
districts. The freedom and unrestraint?the long,
unbroken distances of the plains ?the fresh, clean air?
I love it all.
Muriel :
It is what I should love, too, I feel certain
Harry:
(Earnestly.) How different you are from other town
girls I have met, Miss Mannering! When I have
spoken of the bush to them, they have pitied me for
living there, have called such a life worse than
a prison; when to me the city streets, with their bricks
and mortar, their noise and crowds, are far more prison
like. They shut one in from the pure air of heaven
as the wide, open bush cannot do.
Muriel :
You make me long to see your home, Mr. Farn-
borough. It must be beautiful to feel as you do
about it. Now, I could never feel any wish to pass
my life in the house I was born in?just one of a
row, all alike, all bare and ugly. I tried to squeeze
out a tear when Melba sang ?Home, Sweet Home,?
but it was no use.
Harry :
(Tentatively.) One?s home may be where one
chooses to make it. May you not ?some day?make
a home for yourself elsewhere, Miss Mannering? Per-
haps?(hesitating)?in the country.
Muriel :
If it only might be !


Harry :
You think you could be happy there?
Muriel :
I feel sure I could. But, go on; please tell me more
about your home, Mr. Farnborough.
(They continue talking in a low voice; then rise
from seat).
Andrew :
(Impatiently to Mrs. Alsop.) Don?t you think it?s
time I rescued Muriel from that fellow. She must
be feeling bored.
Mrs. Alsop :
She doesn?t look bored.
(Harry and Muriel walk towards hack, and off at
right.)
Andrew :
There now, they?re leaving us, and going for a
walk along the beach. It is unpardonable of the
fellow, when he hardly knows her, to take her off alone
like that.
Mrs. Alsop :
Probably she is taking him.
Andrew :
You must follow at once, and stop them
Mrs. Alsop :
Thanks; I prefer to remain where I am.
Andrew :
Muriel is not strong. She ought not to overtire
herself. If you will not go, I shall.
Mrs. Alsop :
There is no necessity. Muriel will return if she
feels tired. Why should you interfere? lam her
chaperon; not you.
Andrew ;
Because, if you think it suitable for my cousin to


make herself conspicuous with a total stranger, I don?t.
What do you know about the fellow ?
Mrs. Alsop:
(Rising.) I know he is an intimate friend of one of
the best men I have ever known?a man whom I was
wicked enough to throw over because he was poor.
(Turns toward hack , and goes off at left.)
Andrew :
(To himself , as he looks after her.) So, is that
the way the land lies?
CURTAIN.
ACT 11.
(Drawing room at Riverton Downs. Besides ordinary
drawing room furniture there is a writing table towards front
at right with an easy chair drawn up. On table, ink and
writing materials. Five place on left.
Jessica aiscovered filling vase of flowers from glass water jug
she holds. As she places vase on mantel-piece and sets down
jug on a table near, Buxton enters with mail-bag in his hand.
He wears dark tweed suit, soft hat, and leggings).
Buxton:
Here?s the mail, sweetheart.
Jessica :
(Skipping over to him.) Anything for me, dear?
Buxton:
Heaps. What?ll you give me for them?
Jessica :
(Trying to seize mail-bag.) Don?t be a tease.


Buxton;
(Holding mail-bag at his back.) No pay, no letters.
Jessica :
(Taking flower from her waist-belt.) This piece
of boronia, then.
Buxton:
111 take that, too. (Kisses her , and hands her a
letter.)
Jessica ;
(In a disappointed tone.) Only a bill I
Buxton:
(Producing another letter.) This other looks much
more interesting. It?s from a girl.
Jessica :
How do you know?
Buxton;
Address sprawling all over envelope. Capitals same
size as other letters.
Jessica :
(Eagerly.) It?s from Kitty Bolton. Give it to me,
quick. I?m dying to see what she says.
Buxton:
(Holding it up out of her reach.) You?ve only paid
me for one yet.
Jessica :
(Jumps up and catches it from his hand.) I wrote
to tell her all about us.
Buxton:
How very interesting! I hope Miss Bolton is duly
grateful for the information.
Jessica :
(Glancing over letter.) About our engagement; of
course I told her; she is to keep it to herself, as it?s a
secret yet.
Buxton:
And of course she will!


Jessica :
You see, I had to tell somebody besides Muriel and
her husband, and I wrote to Kitty because I knew
she?d be so jealous.
Buxton :
Jealous! Why?
Jessica :
Of me being engaged before she is
Buxton:
Jealous at your being engaged to a poor book-
keeper?
Jessica :
I didn?t tell her you were bookkeeper. I said you
are manager; and so you are when Mr. Farnborough
is not there. And, anyway, it?s no business of her?s
what you are. I said you are the handsomest man I
have ever set eyes on. And?oh, yes!? (glancing at
letter) ?she wants me to send her your photo.
Buxton:
Sorry such a work of art does not exist.
Jessica :
Then I?ll snap you before you?re a day older. Won?t
it give her the green-eye? This other is only the bill
for my dress. (Opening other envelope.) Eight
guineas! (Sighing.) I suppose, when we?re married,
you?ll say you can?t afford to give me eight guinea
dresses?
Buxton:
I?ll give you anything you ask for, dearest; even
if I have to work myself to a skeleton for it. (Places
several letters and papers on writing table.)
Jessica:
I certainly shall not ask for much, if that is to be
the result.
(Enter Muriel.)
Buxton:
I?ve brought the mail, Mrs. Farnborough.


Muriel :
Thanks. (Seats herself at writing table, and sorts
over letters, etc. Buxton, after glancing round to
see Muriel is not observing him, kisses Jessica, and
goes out at left.) Don?t you want to see the papers,
dear? (Opens a letter, and is reading it.)
Jessica:
(Takes a paper from the table and unfolds it.) I
had a letter from Kitty,
Muriel :
(Absently.) Oh!
Jessica :
She is very surprised at my news,
Muriel :
(Still reading.) Ah!
Jessica :
You know I told her?
Muriel :
Did you?
Jessica :
Yes, about Arthur.
Muriel :
(Looking up.) About Arthur? Oh! Mr. Buxton;
but I thought you were not going to announce it yet?
Jessica :
Not to anyone else; but I had to let Kitty know.
She would have felt hurt if she had heard it first from
strangers. She and I have always been such friends.
Muriel :
(Absently.) I suppose so. Really, Andrew is too
funny. (Smiling.) One would think he was a great
overgrown schoolboy, he is so intensely enthusiastic.
Listen to what he says:? (Reads.) I only wish you
could have been at our meeting, Muriel. The recep-
tion I got was wonderful. I spoke for fully an hour,
and the people went nearly wild with excitement?
cheering and shouting, and pressing round to shake


my hand. I can tell you it makes a fellow feel he?s
filling a place in the world when he can rouse them
like that. We are starting a fund for printing a lot
of leaflets, for distribution all over the Commonwealth.
Each leaflet will contain a stirring address. Mine is
to be the first published. I shall be very glad if you
can let me have a donation . Ah, h?m! (Breaks
off-)
Jessica :
liut you sent him one the other day ?
Muriel :
No, not for this. That was to subsidise a Labour
paper.
Jessica :
I don?t know how you can swallow all Mr. Hartwood
says. You must be very easily led, Muriel.
Muriel :
(Displeased.) On the contrary. I have always been
considered rather too strong-minded ?that is, by those
competent to judge of sucn things.
Jessica :
Which I am not, you mean? At any rate, you
can?t deny you agree with anything your cousin chooses
to say.
Muriel :
Because Andrew?s ideas and mine happen march
together, you cannot accuse me of being easily led.
I hope I am sufficiently out of the conventional groove
??rut,? Andrew calls it ?to have opinions of my own.
I daresay I may be called eccentric. Well, I d
rather be eccentric than follow blindly with the crowd.
Jessica ;
Does Mr. Farnborough like your spending money on
those things?
Muriel :
Harry! Why should he mind? Surely he cannot
object to my helping my own cousin!


Jessica :
Some husbands would; but he?s such an awfully
good fellow.
Muriel :
Andrew is sorry to hear we are going to England.
He thinks, having put my hand to the plough, I ought
not to turn back.
Jessica ;
That means he?ll miss having you to draw on when
he wants a subscription.
Muriel :
I?m not certain yet if I shall go.
Jessica :
(In surprise.) Has Mr. Farnborough changed his
mind?
Muriel :
No; he intends going, but
Jessica :
�ou don?t mean you?ll let him go without you? Oh,
Muriel, you can?t!
Muriel :
It may suit us better for me to stay out here. Harry
will be such a short time away; just long enough to
visit his invalid uncle and return immediately. It
really will scarcely be worth while for me to go.
Jessica :
Of course you know best. What cheek! (Read-
ing from a society paper.) Just listen to this:??lt
is rumoured that a young Melbourne girl is about to
throw herself away on an out-back boundary rider.
The young lady referred to is at present the guest of
last year?s heiress, and is following the example of
her hostess, who also generously gave her hand and
her fortune to an impoverished dweller in the wilds.?
Did you ever hear such a story?
Muriel :
I thought you had not let anyone know yet?


Jessica :
Only Kitty. She?s a nasty, spiteful little cat.
Muriel :
Don?t worry about it, dear.
Jessica:
(Nearly weeping.) Oh, I don?t mind. It s for you
and Mr. Farnborough, and Ar-Ar-Arthur, that I care.
Muriel :
Neither Harry nor I shall be a penny the worse*, my
dear; and Mr. Buxton is too sensible to care what a
paper like that says about him.
(Enter Harry at left.)
Harry:
Mail come? (To Jessica.) What?s the matter, little
girl? No bad news, I hope?
Jessica :
(Handing him paper.) Look there!
Harry:
Ha, ha, ha! So the murder?s out!
Jessica :
But look what they say about Arthur ?a boundary
rider! (Imdignantly.)
Harry:
What shall we do? Take a warrant out for the
editor?s arrest, or a libel action ?damages, a thousand?
Go and break it gently to Arthur, little woman; but
beg him not to endanger his life in a duel over the
affair for all our sakes. (As Jessica is going , he
takes letters up from table.) Oh, and here are some
accounts you can give him to look over. (She
returns, takes letters from him , and goes out at left.)
Poor little Jessica. (Laughs.)
Muriel :
I had a letter from Andrew, dear.
Harry:
(Looking grave.) Another already! What ?cause?
is he collecting for now?


Muriel :
(Offended.) You mean, he only writes to me when
he wants a subscription.
Harry:
I mean he always wants a subscription when he
writes.
Muriel :
I prefer to think he writes because he knows I take
an interest in his work, and also I enjoy getting his
letters, they are so clever and amusing.
Harry:
Clever, I admit; very clever!
Muriel :
I know you have never liked Andrew, or his plans
for the amelioration of the lot of the working-class,
so I do not expect you to contribute a penny to his
different enterprises; but when he asks my help in rais-
ing the poor and needy, I would indeed be selfish to
refuse him a trifle out of my abundance. Still, if you
are going to forbid me to spend it as I please, of
course I shall obey you.
Harry:
(Sitting on the arm of her chair , and placing his
arm affectionately about her shoulder.) Dearest, I
would cut out my tongue rather than say a word to
control the use you make of what is your own.
Muriel :
Yet you do not approve of my spending it on
Andrew?s behalf. You wish it were not my own,
often, don?t you, Harry?
Harry :
I wish, darling, you were indeed the poor little girl I be-
lieved you to be when I asked you to be my wife.
Muriel :
Why, dear?
Harry :
Because I wanted you to owe everything to me. Ah !


Muriel, it sounds selfish on my part, but I longed to
be the one to smooth your path?to give you a home
to fold you in my love, and guard you from the
buffeting of the world; for the world can be very hard
on a poor and friendless woman.
Muriel :
Dear Harry, when you say those things I almost
wish I were poor. Yet ? (sighs) ?it is nice to have
money. I?d not be willing to renounce it, I?m afraid,
even to please you.
Harry:
Nor should I wish you to
Muriel :
Yet, how angry you were when you found you had
become engaged to an heiress!
Harry :
Angry! Was I? If to be plunged suddenly from
the height of bliss into profound depths of bitter dis-
appointment is to be angry, I suppose I was. I loved
my poverty-stricken little girl so much.
Muriel :
Yet you would have jilted me if I had let you.
Harry:
I felt humiliated. What had Ito offer but my love?
Muriel :
Your home.
Harry:
(Gloomily.) Heavily mortgaged !
Muriel :
Well, thank heaven, that is no longer a weight on
your mind, since I got my trustees to take over the
mortgage.
Harry: ,
Do you think a man enjoys being indebted to his
wife to the tune of twenty thousand?


Muriel :
Foolish pride, Harry. Why, it only means that
I am your partner in the ownership of Riverton Downs.
Surely a man can take his wife into partnership liter-
ally as well as figuratively.
Harry:
(Jokingly.) And she have a say in the management?
Muriel ;
(Earnestly.) Yes; it is what would please me above
all things. I want so much to learn, Harry, if you
will teach me. (He laughs.) Why should I not?
Harry :
Because the work is rough and unfitted for little
girls.
Muriel :
(In a wheedling tone, and caressing his hand.)
Harry, if only you would consent, we might make
Riverton Downs famous.
Harry;
(Affectionately.) Might we, little woman? What
scheme has it got in its pretty head now?
Muriel :
We might work it, you and I together, on co-opera-
tive principles.
Harry:
What, exactly, do you mean by ? co-operative prin-
ciples??
Muriel :
Well, share the profits with the employes.
Harry:
(Frowning, and drawing away his hand.) Is that
one of your cousin?s crack-brained suggestions?
Muriel :
It is my own as well.
Harry :
That fellow has been perverting you, I see. I


thought you had too much common-sense to be led
away by all that nonsense, Muriel.
Muriel :
(Offended.) Now you are being rude.
Harry :
Dearest, cannot you see the folly of trying to graft
such Utopian ideas on to the requirements of every-
day life?
Muriel :
I cannot see why some should be living in super-
fluous luxury while others are starving for the neces-
saries of existence. You cannot believe it is right.
Harry ;
It is a sad state of things, I grant you, and we
can only hope it will be remedied. Indeed, every day
things are being done to mend it, but not by men like
your cousin.
Muriel :
Why should some be born masters, and some ser-
vants?
Harry:
They?re not. The fortune or misfortune of circum-
stance causes them to acquire those positions.
Muriel :
Andrew says it is wrong for any free man or woman
to be at another?s beck and call.
Harry :
Then do you think it wrong for Polly to answer your
bell when you ring for, say, afternoon tea?
Muriel :
If it would help to bring about universal equality I
would be quite willing to go to the kitchen and get
my own tea.
Harry;
I suppose it has never struck you that when that
happy state of things is brought about, there may pos-


sibly be no tea to get. The coloured worker as well
as the white will then be our equal; and how many of
them, think you, will be content to toil in sultry
climates to grow tea or sugar for you to consume at
your ease?
Muriel :
But Andrew says, under Socialism everybody must
do some kind of work.
Harry:
And if they are unfitted for it, what then?
Muriel :
Andrew says there will be work suited to everybody?s
ability. I hose who can do hard, manual work will
be given that. Those who have talent will use it in
painting pictures, or singing, playing, acting, or
writing.
Harry:
And what work would you do?
Muriel :
1 could do fancy-work.
Harry:
Ah, yes ! I should say there is likely to be a large
output of ?fancy??-work. I see your cousin has
you well primed. And when, may I ask, does he ex-
pect the country will be ripe for his Socialistic experi-
ments?
Muriel :
Whenever all the people will join together In demand-
ing it. It rests with the people, he says.
Harry :
Yes; there is our safeguard. Fortunately, the
majority of the masses know when they?re well off.
You have not ascertained Polly?s views on the subject,
I suppose. (Muriel shakes her head.) No? Well,
we?ll hear what she thinks. (Rings bell.) In her
case, I should say it will be an entirely unprejudiced
opinion. (Enter Polly.) Polly, your mistress and I


want you to tell us if you are satisfied to remain with
us, or if you would like a change?
Polly : ?
Oh, please, Sir, don?t say you?re going to give me
notice. Mam, what haven?t I done right? Please
don?t send me away. (Beginning to whimper.)
Harry :
There, there, my girl; it?s all right. For goodness
sake don?t begin to cry. Your mistress is perfectly
satisfied with you. I only want you to tell us if you
are contented here.
Polly :
Oh, quite, Sir, thank you.
Harry:
Then you don?t hanker after any sort of change?
Polly :
Oh, no, Sir, please. I just want to go on being
here.
Harry :
Suppose, now, you were offered a nice little cottage
in town to live in, all for yourself alone. .You would
be your own mistress, no one to order you about, and
all the washing-up, sweeping, and dusting, and so on,
would be for yourself entirely. Would you be happier
than you are here?
Polly :
Oh, no, Sir, I?m happiest here. I don?t want to
go to no house in town, Sir.
Harry:
Hum ! And why, Polly, do you prefer domestic ser-
vice here to being your own mistress in town?
Polly :
(Looking coy.) Please, Sir, I?ve got my Joe here.
Harry:
You may go, Polly. (Exit Polly.) She?s got her
Joe. You see, my dear, we may plan great schemes


and make laws to drive and pull poor humanity in the
way we think it ought to go, but let Mother Nature
call, and with a bound the call is obeyed. Polly?s Joe
is more to her than all the Socialistic theories in the
world. (Takes a letter from the table.) I see this is
from Tom Millard. (Opens and reads it.) That?s
unfortunate. He will be passing through after giving
delivery of his stock next week?(you know, he sold his
place lately)?and would like to spend a few days
here. I must write and tell him we shall be away. �
Muriel :
Harry, dear, if I ask you as a great favour not to
ask me to go home, will you much mind?
Harry :
Not go to England? But, dearest, I have cabled
to my uncle to say we are leaving this month. The
poor old man* will be heartbroken. He wrote that
he has set his heart on seeing me again before he dies.
He is the last left of three brothers, and has been a
good friend to me. No, I cannot disappoint him,
even to gratify you, Muriel.
Muriel :
But I don?t ask you to disappoint him, dear. You
go, only let me stay here.
Harry :
Alone!
Muriel :
I need not be alone. Jessica will stay, I?m sure,
and I could get Mrs. Alsop to come and keep me com-
pany while you are away if you like.
Harry :
I really cannot hear of it, dearest. Igo to England
and leave you out here ! Quite out of the question.
Muriel :
It will not be for so very long, Harry; only a little
over three months, or at most four. Really, I?d be
much happier here.


Harry :
Happier!
Muriel :
Of course I don?t mean I shouldn?t be happier still if
you stayed here with me, and I shall miss you most
terribly. But I don?t want to be selfish, and shall not
think of letting you give up your trip just because I
don?t want to go. That would be too cruel to your
uncle, who is longing to see you.
Harry :
Tell me, dearest, why do you want to stay.
Muriel :
Because? (hesitates) ?because Harry, even in these
few months, I have grown to love our home. I don?t
want to leave it now. Let me stay, dearest, and I
can look after your interests while you are away.
Harry ;
Buxton will do all that. He is thoroughly experi-
enced and reliable.
Muriel :
Then there will be the shearing starting next month. I
would so much like to be here for that. There will
be shearers to get.
Harry :
That is already arranged for.
Muriel ;
Already ! But I thought shearers had to be en-
gaged fresh every year, and agreements signed, and
that sort of thing.
Harry :
Buxton has engaged nearly all we shall want, and
he?ll see about the agreement when they arrive.
Muriel ;
(Putting her arms round his neck coaxingly.)
Harry, dear, I?ve set my heart on staying here. Don?t
deny me the first thing I have ever asked you since we
were married.


Harry:
(Embracing her affectionately.) It is such a big
thing, dearest?so cruelly big?for me to go away and
leave you for even three months; but there
(Kissing her.)
Muriel :
You?ll let me stay, Harry?
Harry:
Can I refuse you anything? I only want to see
you happy in your own way, dearest, and if staying
at Riverton Downs will make you happy
Muriel :
It will dear.
Harry:
I ought to be glad, I suppose, for you to be so fond
of the old place. Of course, I was born here, and
love it better than any place on earth; and were I
called on to part with it, it would be a terrible blow;
but I could scarcely have hoped you would become so
attached to it. You think you won?t be very dull ?
very lonely?
Muriel ;
Not with Jessica and Mrs. Alsop
Harry:
I?ll get Tom Millard to come and stay as long as he
can. He?s a splendid fellow, and I shall feel more
satisfied knowing he is here. Besides, his advice will
be valuable to Buxton. I?ll drop him a line to-day.
(Goes out at left.)
Muriel :
(Stands thinking a moment, in doubt.) It might be
done ? (walks towards writing table) ?if Andrew could
only?/ hesitates). But, then, what would Harry say?
(Decisively.) Well, after all, what right has he to say
anything? The property is as much mine as his.
(Goes quickly to table, sits down, takes pen, and
begins to write.) ? Dear Andrew, ?Your letter just to


? hand. Am enclosing cheque for twenty pounds.
? You will, I daresay, be pleased to learn that I have
? changed my mind about going to England. Harry
? has now decided to go alone. He leaves next week.
?We start shearing in about a fortnight. Can you
?come up? It may be the opportunity you have
? waited for so long, and ? (Continues writing.)
CURTAIN.
ACT 111.
[Scene I. A corner of the garden at Riverton Downs. On
right pari of verandah of house up three steps from ground.
Two or three rustic chairs and a table near verandah with tray,
tea-cups and saucers, etc. On left a small flower bed where
Harry, disguised as ? Old Billy,? a swagman, in grey wig and
beard, long ragged coat, old boots and battered hat, is kneeling
down weeding. Knter Muriel from verandah followed by
A ndrew ).
Muriel :
You are just in time for tea. So the shearing is
going on capitally?
Andrew :
First-rate. Ihe knowledge that they share in the
profits of their labour makes all the difference. It is
co-operation as opposed to individualism. T-hey will
cut out this afternoon. I came up purposely to ask
you all to come down to the shed. Ihe men are
anxious to cheer you. You have quite won their
hearts in doing what you have.
Muriel :
I have done nothing. It is you, Andrew? you sug-


gested trying the experiment of carrying out our shear-
ing this year on Socialistic methods ?you drew up the
agreement setting forth exactly what Harry?s share of
the wool proceeds is to be, and letting those who have
done all the work divide the remainder between them?
and it was you persuaded them to accept the new terms
in place of the agreement Mr. Buxton wanted.
Andrew :
There was not much persuasion required with the
men. My greatest triumph, and one of which I shall
always be most proud, was in inducing you to agree to
the experiment.
Muriel :
I was quite ready to agree. My only doubt was
as to what Harry might say when he comes back from
England, supposing we had failed.
Andrew :
You know me well enough by now, Muriel, to know
I do not fail. When a man has faith in himself, and
in his cause, he does not usually fail. (She makes
gesture of dissent.) You shake your head. You
would say I failed to win you. Because you are Harry
Farnborough?s wife, therefore I failed. * But did I fail,
Muriel? Fail in carrying on the work I set myself?
True, I would have won you for my wife. I had
mapped out our lives together, leading the great move-
ment which is to bring countless blessings on the
lowly and down-trodden among the great human race.
But Fate willed otherwise. You married Farn-
borough, and by that act you place in my hands tools
which I could not otherwise have hoped to handle in
shaping the destinies of the Commonwealth. You
lend me not only your wealth and influence, but your
husband?s property, his sheep, his workmen, this shed
?a theatre ready made and equipped to my hand. The
puppets dance to my will. I prove by practice what
many have talked about; many have ridiculed as im-
practicable, but none has had the courage to carry


out. I have proved that co-operation may be success-
ful, even in the shearing-shed. Can you say I failed?
Muriel :
You have succeeded splendidly, Andrew, in spite of
Mr. Millard?s prophecy to the contrary and Arthur
Buxton?s opposition. And I shall be able to give
Harry the most glowing accounts of our doings. I?m
writing him a long letter now. (Sighs.)
Andrew :
You will be glad when he returns? You miss him?
Muriel :
I miss him? Yes, of course, I miss him. (Doubt-
fully.)
Andrew :
Always? Even when I am here with you, Muriel?
(Takes her hand and holds it.)
Muriel :
Perhaps?not quite so much since you came.
Andrew ;
Tell me, Muriel, have you been happier since I came?
Your life has been fuller?
(Billy has been watching them from the flower-bed
he is working at, and now approaches with a leaf in
his hand.)
Billy? :
(In an assumed voice.) Please, mum ? (they start,
and Andrew drops her hand) ?can you tell me if this
here be a flower or only a weed?
Muriel :
(Looks at it.) A weed, Billy. (He retires.)
Andrew :
A life of idle ease, of lazy luxury, will never suit you,
Muriel. You are cut out for better things?for higher
aims.
Muriel :
But I don?t intend to lead an idle life. I want 'o


be able to help Harry?to learn all I can about the
country where my home is. I have been taking les-
sons, and can assure you I?m a very apt pupil. Joe
has taught me to milk. I can almost use two hands
at once now; and I have made butter ?very good but-
ter, too, the cook says. Then I?m learning how to
muster, though I can?t drive the sheep as well as the
dogs can, yet. And Mr. Buxton is going to teach me
wool-classing, and I actually tried my hand shearing
before you came up, only I wanted to cry when the
horrid shears slipped and stuck into the poor little lamb.
What do you think of all those accomplishments?
Andrew :
That they can all be done very much better by others.
Muriel :
(Offended.) Andrew! I thought you would have ap-
proved ! You condemn my being idle, and when I
show you I am not, you mock at my work.
Andrew :
Because you are wasting your talents. Can you not
see you are burying your gifts up here in the country?
With- the exception of this co-operative shearing, what
single thing have you done that tends to raise your
fellow creatures? It is all petty and sordid. Ah,
Muriel! if only you had chosen differently, what might
not your life have been? Raising up the thousands of
oppressed and ill-paid workers in the towns, you would
have found scope for your energies, and a fitting field
for your talents and wealth. As my wife, what might
not your influence have been? For lam ambitious.
You look on me now as nothing but a paid agitator?
a fire-brand, the Capitalistic press calls me ?stirring up
discontent where it has not been known before, because
the workers were too blind, too stupid, to perceive their
just grievances. But my ambition seeks wider fields.
My work is leading me even now towards the goal of
politics. The next election is not far off. I have de-
served my party?s confidence. Who know r s, they may


elect me their leader, and then, Muriel, you may see
your cousin Prime Minister of this great Common-
wealth yet.
Muriel :
(Flippantly.) That will be jolly. Why, you will
be able to go home for trips then !
Andrew :
(Annoyed.) You laugh at me and my ambition, but
think, Muriel ?(speaking earnestly, and taking her
hand again in his own) ?will a regret never arise in
your heart for what might have been?
? Billy? :
( Advancing with another leaf.) Please, mum ?
(Andrew drops Muriel's hand, and looks put-out) ?can
ye tell me if this thing be a weed or a flower ?
Muriel :
A weed. (Impatiently.) Why, Billy, that?s the
same as the other.
? Billy? :
Is it now? Fancy that. He, he! the same as the
other? (retiring).
Andrew :
What does that old fellow want poking about here?
PH send him about his business.
Muriel :
Don?t dismiss him. Mr. Buxton says he?s the best
piece-picker in the shed.
Andrew :
Then why can?t he keep him in the shed? He might
be listening to everything I say.
Muriel :
Well, what matter? Billy can?t hurt.
Andrew :
I?m not so sure. Billy! (Billy approaches.)
Here?s half-a-crown ?(gives coin) ?to drink your mis-
tress?s health in the township. (Aside.) He can


make himself blind drunk, and if he does talk, nobody
will listen to him, anyway.
? Billy? :
'I hank ?e, Sir. (Puts coin in his pocket. It falls
through; he makes no move to pick it up.)
Andrew;
Look, you?ve dropped it, you old fool.
? Billy? :
(Turns, and looks down at it.) That?s a pity, Sir.
Andrew :
Well, don?t you see it? Aren?t you going to pick it
up?
? Billy? :
Not me, Sir. ?Tain?t lucky to pick up a coin as has
dropped through yer pocket.
(Andrew picks it up and puts it in his pocket.)
(Billy returns to his weeding.)
Andrew :
I?ve often wondered, Muriel, what you saw in Harry
Farnborough to have chosen him out of so many,
he?s not brilliant, and he?s not much to look at com-
pared with some.
Muriel :
I?ll tell you. As you know, I had offers from almost
every impecunious man of my acquaintance, young and
old, clever and dull, good-looking and otherwise. I
never thought seriously of any of them but you and
Harry. You, because you were the most brilliant
Andrew :
And Harry?
Muriel :
Harry is the only man I cared for who asked me
to be his wife, because he believed me to be a poor
girl.
Andrew :
Poor! Harry believed you to be poor? Are you
certain?


Muriel :
Quite. He told me so.
Andrew :
And if I tell you that before Harry ever met you, Tom
Millard told him you were an heiress?
Muriel :
(Firmly.) I should not believe you. It is of no use
to try and rob me of my faith in Harry, Andrew. Be-
sides, it is unfair when he is not here to answer you.
Andrew :
Not if it was by unfair means he gained you. Here
comes Millard. Ask him?
(Tom enters jrom verandah at right.)
Muriel :
Mr. Millard, is it true you told Harry I was an
heiress? I mean before he and I ever met.
Tom :
Let me think. Ido remember seeing you and Mrs.
Alsop arrive at the hotel, and, yes, I fancy I did men-
tion to him the fact that it was an heiress and her com-
panion; but why do you ask?
Muriel :
(Earnestly.) You told him which was which?
Tom ;
No; I left then. I had known Mrs. Alsop some
years ago, as you are aware, and was not sure the
meeting would be agreeable to her.
Muriel :
(Much relieved.) Then you are wrong, Andrew.
Harry did not know. lam certain of it.
? Billy? :
(Advancing with small plant in his hand.) Beg par-
don, mum, but could ye say what this be?
Muriel :
That is one of my choicest heart?s-ease. You mustn?t
uproot those, Billy.


? Billy? :
No, indeed, mum; I wouldn?t think of goin? for to do
it. It wouldn?t do to root up another person?s heart?s-
ease, would it Sir? (to Andrew).
Andrew :
(Angrily.) Get out of this at once. You?ll do more
harm than good if you can?t tell plants from weeds.
If you can?t find something to do in the shed, you can
clear out altogether.
Muriel :
(Polly appears with teapot etc., on tray.) Wait a
moment, Andrew. Billy must be tired. Let me give
him a cup of tea before he goes.
Andrew :
Certainly not. Ridiculous. Let him go and get his
tea at the shed, and ? (to ? Billy?) ?then take yourself
off.
(?Billy? goes out at left.)
Muriel :
I?m afraid, Andrew, you have not much sympathy
with old age.
(Enter Mrs. Alsop at right.)
Mrs. Alsop :
If ever it is proposed to raise a regiment of Amazons
I shall suggest the standard shall be a teapot. 1 hey?ll
follow that anywhere. But, pray, don?t let me stop
your discussion. What was it? ?Socialism,? as
usual?
Muriel :
I was telling Andrew he is not very considerate in
his treatment of the past generation.
Andrew :
It?s work is done. Why let it block progress? I
look upon it merely as a necessary prelude to the pre-
sent generation.
Mrs. Alsop :
Thanks, dear. (Taking cup from Muriel , who is


pouring out tea.) Even you must admit, Mr. Hart-
wood, that the prelude was necessary. (Muriel hands
tea to Tom and Andrew.)
Andrew :
Certainly, but it is done, played out. The play itself
is on the boards; the prelude is forgotten.
Mrs. Alsop :
Poor prelude ?relegated to an unhonoured grave.
Andrew:
No; I would pension off every old or disabled worker,
for I hold that every incapable worker tends to lower
the wages of the able-bodied by competition.
Muriel :
(To Jessica , who has entered at right.) Tea, dear?
Jessica :
Thanks. And how is shearing getting on, Mr. Hart-
wood ?
Andrew :
Ai. I came up on purpose to ask you all to go down
to the shed and see the finish this afternoon.
Jessica :
I?m so glad it has turned out all right, for Muriel?s
sake.
Muriel :
Yes, isn?t it splendid? I?m going to put on my
hat. (Goes out at right.)
Andrew ;
I think we are all glad, Miss Jessica, except Mr.
Millard, who hoped we?d make a failure of our experi-
ment. (To Tom.) You have never approved of it?
Toai :
No, I can?t say I have. As I told you from the
first: To come on to another person?s property, take
the management out of the hands he left it in, and
carry it on in a way you know he would disapprove
of, I regard as a piece of unmitigated cheek on your
part.


Andrew :
My dear sir, you and I look at it from entirely dif-
ferent points. You regard the place as belonging to
ifarry Farnborough alone. I look on it as partly
my cousin?s. You?ll admit her interest in it is con-
siderable. Take the mortgage alone. If she chose
to foreclose to-morrow, and take the property over,
what would happen? Harry could not lay his hands
on twenty thousand at a moment?s notice. What
would prevent her selling him up?
Tom ?
I would. I have more than that waiting investment
now.
Mrs. Alsop :
(Aside.) Twenty thousand! And to think I threw
over that man for poor Peter !
Andrew :
No wonder we become Socialists when the wealth
earned by the many is concentrated in the hands of the
few.
I had to work harder for mine, young man, than
ever you worked in your life. I did not acquire it by
talking.
Mrs. Alsop :
Now, for goodness sake, you two, don?t begin argu-
ing. Your Socialism is wasted, Mr. Hartwood. Muriel
is not here to listen.
Andrew :
I take the hint, Mrs. Alsop, and shall return to the
shed. We shall expect you all in about half an hour,
remember. (Goes out at left.)
Mrs. Alsop :
I cannot say I enjoy looking on at the men shearing
those poor, helpless sheep; and the shears are such
cruel things. And I?m sure our being in their way
makes the men swear.


Jessica :
On the contrary, Arthur says it prevents them swear-
ing.
Mrs. Alsop :
Of course, Mr. Buxton never swears, my dear.
Jessica :
Oh, no, never. (Emphatically.) He told me he
only says ?damsel? when he feels put out.
'I ( >m ? .
What fills the thoughts must out at the lips, eh?
Damsel! A very pretty way of swearing.
Mrs. Alsop :
Even ?damsel? might sound effective if one forgot
to end it. By-the-bye, my dear, don?t forget, I shall
expect an invitation to the wedding.
Jessica :
I intend asking you both.
Mrs. Alsop :
Mr. Millard doesn?t like weddings. He refused to
come to mine.
Tom :
In the particular capacity I was asked to fill. Do
you think, Miss Jessica, that Arthur Buxton would con-
sent to be present at your own wedding as best man
to another bridegroom?
Jessica:
(Shakes her head meditatively.) No, I?m sure he
wouldn?t.
1 om :
By-the-bye, what does he think of the success of
Hartwood?s co-operative shearing?
Jessica : . ,
I don?t know. We don?t talk much about shearing.
'I om . .
I suppose not. Other things more interesting?


Mrs. Alsop :
Well, I for one am glad it has turned out so well,
for Muriel?s sake; even though it is a triumph for
Andrew and his new-fangled ideas.
Tom :
It serves Harry right for leaving his wife alone.
When I heard he was off without her, I wrote pretty
strongly to him. He would get my letter at Adelaide,
and have food for reflection during the voyage. But
I didn?t contemplate Muriel playing into that fellow?s
hands like she has done.
Mrs. Alsop :
Muriel was ahvays fond of fads. She dearly loves
experiments.
Tom :
Women shouldn?t try experiments with their hus-
band?s property.
Mrs. Alsop:
Why didn?t you remonstrate with her?
Tom :
I did; took her to task roundly. It nearly caused a
breach of friendship. In fact, I had resolved to pack
up and go away had not Miss Jessica kindly repaired
the breach. I have since wondered what arts you
used, little girl, to cause her to forgive me and beg
me to stay on.
Jessica :
If I confess, will you be dreadfully angry?
Tom ;
I promise not to be too severe.
Jessica:
I said, if she let you go away it would make two
people?.-not far away from me now ? very unhappy.
(Jessica goes out at right. Mrs. Alsop and Tom are
both silent a minute then.)
Mrs. Alsop :
(Laughing nervously.) How the child lets her
imagination run away with her. (Is about to leave.)


Tom :
(Absently.) Yes; oh, yes. Doubtless you are right,
Mrs. Alsop. (Following her.) Lilian! Is it?are you
quite sure it is all imagination?
Mrs. Alsop :
Perhaps?not quite all, Tom.
(Both go out at right.)
SCENE 11.
(SC KNE changes to Woolshed at Riverton Downs. In the
background can be seen several shearers at work; also picker s-up,
piece-pickers and other rouseabouts moving about. Towards the
frcnt on right a wool press with a full bale in it which two
pressers are sewing up. Rows of finished bales on each side of
press. Arthur Buxton wearing large white apron stands at
bench on left examining fleeces. Behind table may be seen bins
containing rolled nf pieces already classed. Two boys bring
fleeces and throw them on bench. Buxton examines them, puts
them in separate bins, then takes out his watch and looks at it,
rings bell on post at his side).
Buxton:
Smoke, Oh ! men.
(All the men and boys, excepting a few of the shearers who
have not finished, come forward. Buxton continues the classing.
Two boys appear with large billies of tea. Men bring tin
mugs and dip ont tea for themselves, then seat themselves about
on bales, etc.)
Ben Lawson :
Joe, my lad, tune up for us for the last time.
( Joe sings?any music-hall song popular in town about
twelve months hack can be introduced here. All join in chorus.
While the singing is going on Dan Kennedy and the few other
shearers who did not stop, gradually come forward and join the
others).


Ben Lawson :
Well, boys, this ?ere?s the last tea we?ll be drinking
in this ?ere shed till next shearin?, so ?ere?s luck to
you all; an? to you, too, Mr. Buxton, Sir.
(Buxton , who has now finished , joins the men. A
boy hands him a mug of tea.)
Buxton:
I hanks, Ben. Here?s luck to you, and may River-
ton Downs wool clip never be worse. Drinks.
Ben Lawson :
You think it?s good this year, Sir?
Buxton:
Very good.
Ben Lawson :
Better ?n last?
Buxton:
Much better.
Ben Lawson :
Boys, let?s give three cheers for Riverton Downs.
?lp, ?ip, ?ip
All :
Hurray!
Ben Lawson :
Three cheers for the ?Boss? an? ?is purty young
missus; bless ?er kind ?eart; ?ip, ?ip, ip
All :
Hurray !
Ben Lawson :
Three cheers for Mr. Buxton, as is alius fair an?
square, an? may ?e get a wife of ?is own before ?e?s
much older.
All :
Hurray !
Ben Lawson:
An? now, boys, come on?a tiger fer oursels.


All ;
Hurroo ! Ye?ow
Dan ;
(Coming forward.) Well, ye?re a nice lot, I must
say. Yer go cheerin? the place an? the ?Boss,? an? ?is
?Missus,? an? yerselves, an? never a one fer the man
as ?as done everythin? fer you. Yes, I mean Hart-
wood. ?Asn?t ?e given up ?is work in town to be ?ere
all through shearin?, just to see as ?ow we get our
rights? Warn?t it ?im as got the missus to run this
?ere shed on Socialist lines? Don?t we owe it to ?im
we?re to be paid more?n double what any other darned
shed?s payin?? O? course we do, an? yer set there an?
jaw an? call fer cheers fer every breathin? thing ?cept
?im. Yer rought to be ashamed o? yersel?es. Now,
come boys, I'll lead yer. Let?s ?ear what yer can do
fer Andrew ?Artwood. Hip, ?ip, ?ip
All ;
(Rather feebly.) Hurray!
(Enter Andrew.)
Dan :
We?re just after cheerin? you, Mr. ?Artwood.
Andrew ;
(Leaping on a bale near wool-press, and facing the
men.) Boys, I thank you from the bottom of my
heart for this token of your confidence and apprecia-
tion. I cannot express the gratification I feel at hav-
ing had this splendid opportunity of vindicating the
much-abused character of the doctrine of Socialism.
All :
Hear, hear!
Andrew ;
I venture to believe I have succeeded in demonstrat-
ing beyond a doubt that such principles are practicable,
even in station management ?one of the most Conser-
vative businesses in Australia. Thanks to the owner
of Riverton Downs being at present in England, and


Mrs. Farnborough having temporary charge here, I
have been enabled to put our theories to practical proof.
And you will all agree that the commercial soundness of
the doctrine of Socialism has been nobly vindicated,
notwithstanding the blatant opposition of tyrannical
capitalists, whose one desire is to crush it in the bud
to protect their own pockets.
All :
Hear, hear!
Andrew :
We have proved that our arguments are not the
froth and vaporings of rhetorical wind-bags which our
enemies would have you believe; but that they are
founded on justice to the worker, a fair division of
profits to employer and employed. This shearing
which you finish to-day marks an epoch in the history
of our land. In future, when asked by our enemies
to give an instance of where this glorious doctrine of
Socialism has been tried in pastoral pursuits, and has
succeeded, can you not point triumphantly to this shed
and cry?Behold !
All :
Hear, hear !
Dan :
That?s right.
Andrew :
And how was this state of things brought about?
Not by sitting still?not by doing nothing. Had I not
been working for years, instilling our noble doctrines
into ears that were open to me, could this thing ever
have taken place? By my work, my persuasions, my
arguments; by taking the opportunity of Farnborough?s
absence to induce his wife to give me the chance I
have waited for ?the chance to convince every man,
woman, and child in the Commonwealth .
All :
Hear, hear!


Andrew :
And not only the Commonwealth ?great as it is;
greater still as we will make it ?but the world!
All :
Hear, hear!
Andrew :
And we have convinced them. Men, I say by your
work in this shed ?by the agreement ?I have been
the sole means of getting drawn out for you?l say we
have convinced them that it can be done. Co-opera-
tion of pastoralist and station hands, a just distribu-
tion of the wealth produced so that the real producer ?
the man who holds the shears .
Dan :
Hear, hear, boss ! That?s right.
Andrew :
Will get his fair share. That is what I have striven
for and what I have got for you. Men, I ask you,
have I faithfully fulfilled my trust?
All :
You have. Hear, hear!
Dan :
Three cheers for ?Artwood, boys. (All cheer
loudly.) Ah, that?s more like. But now, Sir, I?d
just like to know about how it?ll figger out. It?s all
very well to see all these bloomin? bales of wool piled
round ?ere, an? I can?t say as ?ow it doesn?t make ?em
look purtier still knowin? ?alf of ?em?s goin? to be ours;
but about ?ow much of it?s goin? ter be my share?
That?s what I wants ter know.
Ben Lawson :
You ain?t agoin? to get no more nor me an? the rest,
Danny. Don?t you go fer to make no bloomin? mis-
take.
All :
We all share alike, Dan. We?re all standin? in
equal in this.


Dan :
No fear! Hain?t I done more?n any two of yer?
Hain?t I arned more?
Ben Lawson :
We?re all Socialists here, ain?t we boys?
Several:
That?s right, Ben.
?Billy? :
(Coming forward from behind the others.) I?m
Socialist, too, mates. Don?t forget Billy.
Dan ;
Shut yer bloomin? head, Billy. Well, Mr. ?Art-
wood, can yer tell us what it?ll be we?re gettin?,
anyway.
Andrew :
Mr. Buxton has the whole account of the returns, I
believe, haven?t you, Mr. Buxton? Have you
reckoned up what the total for distribution among the
hands comes to? All to share, remember. Every
man Jack on the place. Isn?t that so, men?
Men :
That?s right
?Billy?:
Don?t forget Billy. I?m a Socialist
Andrew :
Hold your tongue, Billy, I thought I told you to
clear out long ago.
Buxton?
(Producing small account-book from his pocket.)
Here?s a copy of the agreement between Mrs. Farn-
borough and yourselves, drawn out in accordance with
Mr. Hartwood?s instructions, and an account of receipts
and expenses. After deducting necessary expenditure
for repairs to buildings, fences, etc., rates, taxes, etc.,
also expenses other than already mentioned incurred
in carrying on the station for the 12 months, viz., for
stores, etc., so much. I can give you details of all
the separate accounts if you wish.


Andrew ;
Never mind, Mr. Buxton; we?ll take it as read ?
eh, men?
Dan :
Yes; cut all that, sonny, and come to business.
Buxton:
Then there is the interest on mortgage?one thou-
sand two hundred. That was mentioned, I think, Mr.
Hartwood?
Andrew :
Yes; that?s all right.
Buxton:
Then five hundred was to be allowed as a sort of
honorarium to Mr. Farnborough for allowing you the
use of his shed and sheep for theoretical experiments
in Socialism?
Dan :
Never mind introdoocin? no funny business, sonny.
We said the boss would ?ave five ?undred, an? we ain?t
goin? back on it now.
Buxton:
Then that leaves close on four hundred pounds.
All :
Hear, hear ! Good enough !
Buxton:
Which gives everybody nearly ten pounds apiece
divided between forty of you.
(The rouseabouts, including all the hoys, start to
cheer; then seeing the look on Dan's face, desist.)
Dan :
(Incredulous.) What?s that? How much did you
say?
Buxton:
Ten pounds.
Dan :
Ten besides what I arned myself shearin?


Buxton:
Ten altogether. There?s no more for anyone if all
share alike. The amount from the wool last year,
after deducting expenses, leaves the sum I mentioned.
Andrew :
Was last year?s clip less than this year?s?
Buxton:
Much less. We had a bad season
Dan :
Then why not pay us on this year?s? It?s this
year?s we?re concerned in.
Buxton:
Certainly it could be done if you?ll all agree to wait for
your wages till after the wool sales?say, next January.
Dan :
Wait? Not me! Where?d I get my livin? from if
I wait till next year? Boys, d?ye ?ear that? It?s
robbin? us they?re after. Ten quid is it ye?re offerin?
me? Me what?s worked ?arder nor any two almost
in the shed ! Me as ?as shorn my ?undred a day. It?s
nigh on two thousand I shorn if I shorn one, an? it?s
twenty pounds, an? not a penny less, I?ll take with me
when I quit! Ten quid!
Andrew :
Listen, men! Mr. Buxton knows the difference be-
tween last year?s clip and this. You know the prices
ruling for wool this year, Mr. Buxton? You can
easily reckon what this will fetch, and let the men be
paid on this year?s scale. How does that strike you,
boys?
Buxton:
Can?t undertake to do it, Mr. Hartwood. The price
of wool is dependent on so many things. Till it?s
sold no one can say what it will bring. A slump in
the home market may make all the difference to the
sales here.
Andrew :
But you can give an approximate guess?


Dan :
I?ll have no more monkeying. I shorn two thou-
sand sheep, an? that?s twenty pounds, an? if I ain?t
agoin? to ?ave what?s mine I?ll make someone sorry for it.
Ben Lawson :
Dan?s right. I shorn nearly that meself, an? I don?t
cotton to takin? less nor my rights.
Shearers:
Yes, Dan?s right. We ain?t takin? less nor what
we?ve got a right to?not for all yer bloomin? agreements.
Andrew :
Men ?I?m truly sorry this has happened. Who
could have foreseen that the expenses would eat up so
much of what is actually produced by your exertions,
and therefore your due? I can only suggest the
shearers each receive their pound a hundred, to be
made up by the other hands, who will divide what?s left.
Rouseabouts, etc. :
No, no; not if we know' it! We?re satisfied.
Dan :
You miserable, lazy pack ! You think you?any of
y OU ?are worth as much as me, or even Ben here?
You ain?t worth yer salt, let alone ten quid!
A Rouseabout: . .
None o? yer lip, Dan. You ain?t boss o? this shed.
Dan : ?
Ain?t I? Come, any two of yer, and I?ll settle every
one of yer in turn. (To shearers.) Come on, mates,
we?ll soon thrash this scum. (A free fight is about
to take place.)
Andrew :
(Appealing.) Boys, boys! for heavens sake stop
fighting! Think of the ladies, who will be here in a
few minutes. Be men ! You wouldn t have Mrs. Farn-
borough see you behaving like a lot of savages?
Dan: . ,
Wouldn?t we? Who cares for her, or you either?
Let ?er come. I?ll tell ?er what I think of er an yer


too. Wait till I talk to ?er. I?ll ?ave my twenty
quid, or I?ll know the reason.
Andrew :
Men, hear me ! You are dissatisfied because the
result of our labours has not been so great for some
of us as we had a right to expect. I confess I
for one never could have anticipated such a low return.
I can only account for it by bad management some-
where, or a leakage of some sort which it is too late
to remedy this year. But I ask you to bear with it,
even though some few of you will suffer loss now.
Remember, we all share alike, gain or loss. And can
we not all resolve to bear it for the glorious cause?
Let us nail our colours still more firmly to the mast
of Socialism?
Dan :
Damn you an? yer Socialism! Gi? me my money
what I worked fer. You! What ?ave you done
fer any of us? Come up here when the boss is at
t?other end of the world, an? make love to ?is wife?
pertendin? yer was only tryin? ter ?elp the workin? man !
Bah ! Nice excuse ! You can tell yer fine sweet?eart
she either gives me my money or she?ll smell burnt
wool.
Andrew :
Dan, you?re either mad or drunk. I?m surprised at
you !
Dan :
Are yer? And she?ll be ekally surprised I reckon.
Wait till she comes. I?ll let ?er know what I thinks
of ?er.
Buxton :
(Taking off his apron.) Joe, throw the saddle on mv
horse, will you?
(Joe goes out at left.)
Dan :
(Catching Buxton by the arm.) Where?re yer off
to, young man?


Buxton:
Mind your own business.
Dan :
You?re goin? up to the ?ouse?
Buxton:
That?s no business of yours. Take your hands off.
Dan :
An? yer think yer goin? ter stop ?em cornin? down ter
the shed?
Buxton:
Yes, I do. This is no place for ladies.
Dan :
Well, I tells yer ye ain?t goin?. I wants ?em ?ere.
I wants ter tell ?er what I thinks of ?er.
Buxton:
Take your hands off, or I?ll make you.
Dan :
Not till yer give yer word yer won?t leave the shed.
Buxton:
We?ll see. (Wrestles and throws Dan; then .runs
off at left.)
Dan :
(Picking himself up.) Stop ?im, boys. Don?t let
?im give us the slip.
(Two or three men rush out and return with
Buxton.)
Dan :
Now, then, Mr. Arthur Buxton, will you give your
word yer won?t move from here?
Buxton:
No; I?ll promise nothing.
Dan :
Very good; we?ll ?ave ter keep you ?ere by other
means. Into the wool-press with ?im, boys. Yer?ll
find it nice an? snug, Mr. Buxton, till we?re ready ter
let you out.


? Billy?:
(To Buxton, as men drag him towards press.) Bet-
ter give in, matey; they be too many for ye.
Dan ;
Hold yer jaw, you cackling jackass. What ?ave you
to do with it?
? Billy?:
I?m a Socialist, too. Ain?t I, Mr. Hartwood?
Andrew :
Here, clear out of this. Didn?t I tell you to be off
long ago? Well, then, clear; and if I find you hang-
ing about the place again, I?ll set the dogs on you.
? Billy?:
All right, boss. So long! (Goes off at left.)
Buxton:
(Struggling.) Mr. Hartwood, are you going to allow
this ?
Andrew :
I?m sorry; but you brought it on yourself. Ido
not see that I can interfere.
(Men having turned bale out of press, are about to
put Buxton in, when Muriel, Mrs. Alsop, Jessica, and
Tom enter.)
Muriel :
Good day, men ! We have come, Andrew, as we
promised. Is the shearing nearly done? (Sees Bux-
ton struggling.) What?s the meaning of this? Mr.
Buxton! (Men release Buxton.)
Buxton:
Ask Mr. Hartwood what it means, Mrs.
borough?or the men.
(Muriel looks at Andrew inquiringly.)
Andrew :
Mr. Buxton wished to prevent you and your friends
from coming over, and he has received rather rough
treatment in consequence.
Muriel :
Wished to prevent us coming? But why? We


promised to be here when they cut out. We were in-
vited, were we not?
D AN :
Yes; that?s just it, mum, an? we worn?t gom? to be
done out of the pleasure of seein? yer; were we boys?
An? I just wants ter tell yer what we thinks of you an?
yer precious cousin an? ?is bloomin? agreement.
Muriel :
(Astonished.) What do you mean? Surely every-
thing is satisfactory. Mr. Hart wood assured me you
were all quite satisfied.
Dan:
Did ?e? Then we ain?t. It?s bin a jolly fine kind
of picnic for ?im, I daresay ! Comin ere, an foolin
everybody with ?is talk of justice an? fair wages fer
workers an? division of wealth ! A grand time fer ?im
an? you larkin? up at the ?ouse together, while the boss
is at t?other end of the world.
Tom :
Be silent, man!
Muriel:
You would not dare to talk like that if my husband
were here.
Wouldn?t I? I wish ?e was ?ere, till I tell ?im what?s
bin goin? on be?ind ?is back.
(Enter Harry from left. He has discarded Billy s
long coat, heard, and wig.)
Harry: ~
He is here! What have you to tell him ?
(All are taken aback.)
Men :
The boss!
Muriel and Tom :
Harry!
Tom :
When did you return to Australia?


Harry ;
1 never left it?didn?t get past Adelaide. Your letter
brought me back from there, lorn.
11 <M ;
But where have you hidden yourself all this time?
Harry :
I have been here among you all, though you didn?t
recognise me; and Mr. Hartwood kindly promised to
set the dogs on me a few minutes ago.
Dan :
Old Billy ! Holy Moses ! boys, say your prayers !
Andrew :
You have been masquerading as that old swagman?
Harry:
Yes, I was Billy. I didn?t want to turn up too soon
to interfere with existing arrangements?your arrange-
ments, Mr. Hartwood?for working my property on
Socialistic lines. But now that you have failed, the
time has come for me to carry it on my own way.
Men, get back to your work. You are to cut out
this afternoon, remember. You can stay in the hut
to-night, and come up to the house to-morrow for your
cheques.
Dan :
The old agreement, boss?
Harry:
The old agreement, Dan.
Dan :
Three cheers for the boss, boys! (All cheer.)
Harry:
(To Andrew, who has been standing in gloomy
silence.) Mr. Hartwood, the trap will be ready to take
you to the station as soon as you have packed.
Andrew :
(To Muriel, who is standing on right, and showing
signs of agitation.) Good-bye, Muriel.
Muriel :
Good-bye. (She does not offer her hand.)


Andrew :
Muriel, you may perhaps think I have failed. Per-
haps you may even pity me; but I do not need your
pitv, for my work has been so far from failure that
I tell you the seed dropped here at Riverton Downs
will yet spring up and bear fruit?perhaps next year,
perhaps not for many years to come. But my work
is not wasted, Muriel. You may reject my teaching?
probably you will?to follow the lead of the man you
have chosen for your husband (the old conventional
lead); but you can never put out of your soul what I
have implanted there. You will hear of me ?will read
of me ?many a time, as I lead the van of human pro-
gress in the Commonwealth. And you will continue
in your groove, and think with vain regret of what might
have been ! The banner of a glorious leadership was
put Into your hand, and you would not hold it up.
?Good-bye! (Goes off at left.)
Harry:
(Looking after Andrew.) To him the worst punish-
ment is failure.
Buxton:
(Advancing with Jessica.) Welcome home, Sir.
Jessica :
I am glad to see you back, Mr, Farnborough.
Harry:
Thank you both. Yours and Arthur?s happiness,
Jessica, shall be my earnest concern. My assumed
part has shown me my friends, and I shall not forget
them.
Buxton:
Thank you, Harry.
(Buxton and Jessica retire to sorting bench.)
(Mrs. Alsop and Tom come up to Harry.)
Tom :
Welcome home, Harry, my boy. We are all heartily
glad to see you.


Mrs. Alsop :
And turning up so providentially, too; just when
your presence was most desirable. You see, it doesn?t
do for a man to go away and leave his young wife be-
hind him. She is sure to get into mischief.
Harry:
I have to thank my good friends who remained to
guard her.
Tom :
We hand over the charge to you now. (Retires with
Mrs. Alsop to watch shearing.)
Harry:
(In centre ?to Muriel at right.) Have you nothing
to say to me, Muriel?
Muriel :
What should I have to say? You have been with
us all the time. You know everything.
Harry:
Yes; I know everything.
Muriel :
Then there is nothing for me to say
Harry :
Nothing?
Muriel :
What do you wish me to say?
Harry:
I want to hear from your lips the words I have
already heard from others.
Muriel :
(Doubtfully.) You only wish that?
Harry :
Only that.
Muriel :
(Impulsively.) Welcome home, Harry
Harry :
(Taking her in his arms.) My wife!
