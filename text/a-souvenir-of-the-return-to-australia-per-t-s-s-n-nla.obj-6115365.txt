Introduction
T.S.b. 1 Nevasa' was built in 1913, on the Clyde, by Barclay, Curie and Coy., for the British India Steam Navigation Co.,
her dimensions being as follows :—Tonnage (gross), 9070 tons; length, 490 feet; beam, 56 feet; and speed, 14 knots.
After a long and honorable war service in many seas, including a share in the historic operations at the Gallipoli Peninsula,
the Nevasa was, early in the present year, allotted to the work of repatriating the A.I.F. Originally due to leave on the 2nd February,
it was not until 6 a.m. on 6th March, and then only after the fitting up of the vessel had been done by volunteer workmen—chosen
from among those due to embark on her—-that she steamed slowly out of Portland Bay on her maiden voyage to Australia.
Repatriated prisoners of war and unfit men made up the majority of those on board, but there were, in addition, some
few returning Australian Army Nursing Sisters, as well as some Anzacs, rejoining their units in Egypt on completion of their 75
days furlough, the totals of those for Australia being :—Officers, 51 ; Sisters and Nurses, 10 ; other ranks, 1314.
Good weather was met with, and the trip proved as enjoyable as is possible on a transport. A speedy run down the
coast of Portugal brought us into warmer latitudes than we had left, and Gibraltar was passed at 4 a.fn. on the 10th, only the lights
being visible—unfortunately. Port Said was reached at 11.30 a.m. on the 16th, and, after a most interesting trip through the Suez
Canal, Port Suez at midday on the 17th. It was understood that some Light Horse men were to be taken on board here, but,
apparently the native disturbances at this time affecting these parts prevented their movement, for, after a delay of 24 hours, the
voyage was resumed without them, and on the 30th Colombo came into view—anchor being dropped about 4 p.m.
The news that " shore leave '* would be granted the following day came as a surprise—the more welcome as we had been
warned not to expect any, owing to the prevalence of Influenza in Ceylon—and at 7 a.m. the disembarkation began. By 9 a.m. all our
objectives had been taken and the city was practically in our hands—heavy onslaught continuing all day on the Y.M.C.A. canteen, where
"mopping up" parties did great execution amongst the soft drinks and fruit. Though a good proportion of us were " financiallv
embarrassed " at this time, we, nevertheless, managed to enjoy ourselves, and few returned to the ship without some mementoes of our visit.
Coaling being completed, we left Colombo at midday on Ist April—shortly afterwards running into rather heavy weather, which
continued for the greater part of the journey across the Indian Ocean. When within a couple of days steaming from Fremantle Ave received
orders by wireless to proceed to Albany direct. Our course was altered, and at about 5 p.m. on 12th April we had our first glimpse of the
Homeland—anchor being dropped at midday on 13th, at King George's Sound—the West Australian quota leaving for the Isolation Camp
about a mile distant—during the afternoon. As there were a few cases of influenza on board it was decided to send them ashore to the
hospital and thus minimise the chance of it spreading any further among the men during the rest of the trip.
Since leaving Colombo we had received frequent issues of fruit and cigarettes—the gifts of the Y.M.C.A. and citizens of that city
and deeply appreciated they had been—as can be imagined—but it Avas the good old Salvation Army, and our incomparable Australian Red
Cross Society, who literally showered fruit, chocolates, and other welcome gifts upon us during these last few days of our long journey. It
was a fitting conclusion to their previous splendid efforts, and one and all realised that we Avere —once more-—back among our OAvn warm-
hearted people.
Of the trip itself there remains little more to tell. After a pleasant run across the " Bight," Adelaide AVUS reached on the
morning of the 18th—the Tasmanian quota being transferred that evening to the " Kashmir"—thus saving us the extra journey to Hobart.
Leaving Adelaide on the following day, another quiet run brought us to Port Phillip Heads, which were entered at daybreak on the 21st, and


%If p 5
d b
at 11 a.m. the journey was resumed, Sydney Harbour coming in sight on the morning of the 23rd, and Moreton Bay a couple of days later
on. In each case some days were spent in quarantine before proceeding to the Finalisation Depot, and then—" Home, Sweet Home" once
more.
It was generally conceded that much of the credit for the splendid trip and the good feeling that existed was due to the C.O.
Troops, and those associated with him for the consideration and common sense shown in handling the men, and the absence of some of the
customary ' red tape.' A word of praise must be given some others also for their share in the ' good work ' —to the Band and Concert Party
for their tip-top performances ; to the untiring efforts of the Sports Committee, perhaps more particularly to Lieut. G. M. Ingram, V.C.
M M., and Pte. A. Solomon, who seemed always in the thick of it ;to Lieut. A. W. Hicks, who organised the Educational Classes to
the Medical and Nursing Staff ; to the Captain and other officers of the ' Nevasa'—good fellows all, and last—but by no means least "Our
Padre"
We the fortunate ones—are home once more; the war, witli its sad memories, slips rapidly back into the past; of it, we do not
seek reminders; but of this return home—the fighting over—our loved ones awaiting us at the end—we do perhaps, look for 'something'
that will keep the memory of it fresh in our minds. This booklet is an attempt to fill that need. If its perusal gives to others half the
pleasure that its preparation gave to me, then I am amply repaid for the time and trouble given to it.
I must acknowledge my indebtedness to those who, in any way, assisted me in its preparation, particularly my friend Gnr. W.
A. Pennell, whose help was invaluable, and the ' C.O. Troops' and his Adjutant, Capt. Saunders, who gave me every assistance possible.
As copies of this publication will be handed over to the War Records Section, no doubt, at some future time, they will occupy a place in
the Australian War Museum, to be erected in our ' Capital to be ' —Canberra.
There seems, at present, a real danger that this great country of ours may not prove itself worthy of those who have lain down
their lives foi it. Ihe need now, as ever, is for men—not slackers—workers, not agitators—statesmen, not wreckers. In the hands of
those who fought for it to a great extent—rests its future. May we be found no less willing to work for it, and thus prove our boast to
be no empty one—-that it is, indeed, " God's Own Country."
