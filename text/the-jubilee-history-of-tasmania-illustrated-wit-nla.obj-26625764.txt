THE COLONY OF TASMANIA
CHAPTER I.
DISCOVERY AND EARLY NARRATIVE.
1642-1810.
4«HE spirit of commerce is the life of exploration. Nations desirous of
adding to their wealth, becoming masters of an extensive territory, and
furthering the prosperity of their subjects, are naturally impelled to
accomplish these objects in the most expeditious and advantageous manner. In the
present day, expeditions of discovery are undertaken with a view to gain a more
complete scientific knowledge of the different geographical and topographical facts of
this orb, rather than to extend commercial interests. From the historical records of
the past four centuries, it may be gathered that colonisation has been carried on by
different countries with varying success, according to the conditions under control;
for, be it observed, some conditions are beyond our control. To take an instance —
the three scourges of the world are war, pestilence, and famine. In no civilised
country need there be war, and there ought not to be pestilence, but famine is
beyond the range of control. Circumstances may or may not be favourable.
Circumstances are causes producing effects, which in their turn may and do
become causes. The complexity of the elements, or the causes affecting and entering
into the growth or decay of a country, are not capable of a strict analysis a priori,
nor can they be rigidly verified a posteriori ; because when we deal with such facts, we
are dealing with historical facts, and in history the phenomena never repeat
themselves, nor can they be reproduced. Science is based on observation and
experiment, and if given the same conditions the same results will recur, because in
this case you are dealing with an order which is uniform and permanent, whereas in
history you are engaged in the investigation of that which is not permanent but
progressive, or, at any rate, which is undergoing continual change. Given then the
same physical conditions that have contributed to the development of a country, it
is impossible to predict that these given conditions will contribute in like manner
to the development of another country; and why? because there enters into


consideration the factors —freedom and consciousness of man, which are ever
changing. The history of a colony especially is a narrative, and in such a manner
do we intend to treat the subject in the present work.
The circumstances favouring the development of the colonies of Great
Britain have been so unprecedented that they are each and all brilliant jewels in her
Crown. No greater pleasure can be indulged in than that of penning the account of
a colony’s birth and growth—her embryonic struggles—although at times many
disputes, or, at least, conflicting claims as to the mode of that growth blur the
history. Again, the same takes place when the date of the colony’s original
discovery is discussed, and the claims put forward by nations as to the honour of
having made it are considered. Many claimants are to be found asserting their right
to that honour in the case of Van Diemen’s Land. As this colony, in its history, at
points impinges on that of Australia, it will be necessary to touch briefly on them, so
as to preserve a continuity in the record. The French writers on Australian voyages,
the President de Brosses and the Abbe Prevot, claim for a countryman of their own,
Captain Gonneville, the merit of having discovered this continent. He sailed from
Harfleur, in the month of June, 1503, was caught in a storm at the Cape, lost his
reckoning, and drifted about until he saw some birds flying towards the south.
Following them, he reached a land where he lived for some time, and to
which he gave the name of Southern India. He describes the natives as
friendly and somewhat civilised. Recent voyagers think he must have mistaken
the country about which he speaks, as their experience is that the natives
on the north coast of New Holland were without the very first element
of civilisation, and that their treachery and cruelty precluded any intercourse with
them. General Anthony Van Diemen, Governor of the Dutch settlements in the East
Indies, was desirous of having the coast of the “Great South Land” explored, that
being the name by which Australia was then known—Flinders giving the continent
its present name after it had borne that of Great Java, Great South Land, New
Holland and others. In accordance with instructions, Commodore Abel Jans
Tasman, a Dutch navigator, sailed from Batavia on August 14th, 1642, in the
“Heemskirk,” accompanied by his brother, Gerritt Tasman, in the fly boat “Zeehaan.”
The vessels arrived at Mauritius on September sth, and sailed again on October Bth,
in an easterly direction. Altering the course to the south of east, he continued in
that direction until he sighted the island of Tasmania, on November 24th, 1642,
at 4 p.m. The land seen was Point Hibbs, a cape on the west coast. Tasman named
the country Van Diemen’s Land, in honour of his friend the Governor of Batavia.
As the explorers neared the coast they observed lofty mountains rising in the
background, two of them now bearing the names of Tasman’s vessels, “Heemskirk”
and “Zeehaan,” given by Flinders. They pulled ashore to examine the country, saw
signs of smoke but no natives, and trees of enormous height, with notches cut in
them seven feet apart. These were supposed to be the steps used by the natives in
climbing the trees, and on their return to the ship they reported that the land was
exceedingly beautiful. The tool used for the purpose of cutting the notches was flint,


and it is presumed from the great distance between the steps that they had some
mode of climbing trees unknown to us. Tasman, next day, allowed the carpenter to
swim ashore and hoist the Dutch flag, and then weighed anchor. Steering eastward,
he discovered the islands of New Zealand, and having partially surveyed the coasts
set sail again, passed Maria Island, which he named after a member of Anthony Van
Diemen’s family, nowknown as the island where Smith O’Brien, the “Young Irelander,”
spent a portion of his time in exile, and arrived in Batavia on June 15th, 1643. The
Dutch had already visited the north-west and part of the south coasts of Australia.
The Spaniards, whose Peruvian discoveries proved very successful, were anxious to
acquire further valuable possessions in the unknown regions of the south. In 1594,
Fernandez de Quiros, a Spaniard, was given charge of an expedition fitted out by the
Viceroy of Peru, to establish a settlement upon one of the Solomon Islands. Some
years afterwards he succeeded in prevailing on Philip 11., King of Spain (who for a
long time was deaf to his entreaties) to instruct the Governor of Peru to equip
an expedition for the discovery of the great continent, which De Quiros believed lay
south of the East Indies. Two vessels and a launch having been provided, the
expedition set sail from Callao on December 21st, 1605, with Luis Van de Torres as
chief in command, De Quiros acting as sailing captain. They sighted several islands
in the Pacific, and on April 2nd, 1606, discovered what appeared to be a vast territory
full of great mountains. De Quiros named the new region Australia del Espiritu
Santo, took formal possession of it in the name of the King of Spain, and founded a
city, which he called La Nueva Jerusalem. The whole project turned out to be
a failure. The natives were warlike and so aggressive that a collision ensued;
several blacks were slain, and in less than a month De Quiros abandoned the
settlement. For some reason not known, Torres determined on parting company
with De Quiros, and accordingly returned with his ship, “La Almiranta,” to his
former anchorage, where he remained for a fortnight. He then set sail, and steered
along the west side of the land, which was now found to be an island, and not
the Australian continent. For two months Torres explored the dangerous seas
north-east of Australia. Steering westward, the eastern shores of New Guinea were
sighted; and sailing along the southern coast of that island, the intricate passage of
the straits which bears his name was effected for the first time by a European. He
sighted Cape York, but returned without making any further explorations to the south.
It is now known that what De Quiros conjectured to be the great continent of which
he was in search, is one of the New Hebrides Islands. The last heard of this
intrepid and enthusiastic explorer is that he returned home, and spent the rest of his
life in petitioning the King for a new ship; but, as Torres asserted that there could
not be a continent in that region, the King refused to undertake another expedition.
He died in poverty, but his name is to be honoured as the first of the early Australian
discoverers. Shortly before the time that the Spanish navigator was exploring
Torres Straits, the Dutch yacht “Duyfhen” (Dove) was despatched from Java to
explore the coast of New Guinea. In March, 1606, this vessel sailed westward along
the western coast of the Peninsula of Cape York, and a landing was effected; but


owing to want of provisions and the hostility of the natives the place was abandoned,
and the name Cape Keer-Weer (Turn Again) was given to it as commemorative of the
incident. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company was established. Noted for
maritime enterprise, they formed various settlements in the Indian Archipelago, their
head-quarters being Batavia, in Java. This mercantile company fitted out their
vessels on a liberal scale, and their commanders were remarkable for their skill and
daring. Before the date of Tasman’s voyage, these famous navigators explored a
large extent of coast on the Australian continent; but the discoveries at later periods,
of that portion which now contributes to the commercial supremacy of the British
Empire, are due to three Anglo-Saxons —Cook, Bass and Flinders. In 1616,
Hartog’s Island, in Shark Bay, was discovered by Hartog in the “Eendracht; and
in 1618, Zeacher discovered and surveyed the land extending from North West Cape
to fifteenth parallel of latitude, as well as the territory which he named Arnheim’s
Land. In 1622 South West Cape was discovered, and the coast of Western Australia.
In 1628 Captain Peter Carpenter (a Dutchman, who gave his name to the gulf)
explored the coast line of the Gulf of Carpenteria from Cape Keer-Weer to Arnheim s
Land. Other navigators, belonging to the Dutch East India Company, also
undertook the exploration of the same land. Tasman was therefore continuing a
series of discoveries initiated by the Dutch, when he sighted the coast of Tasmania.
But in the year 1770 several important discoveries in the southern hemisphere were
made. The Eoyal Society of London persuaded the English Government to send
out an expedition for the purpose of observing the transit of Venus. James Cook
commanded the “Endeavour,” which was chosen to carry the scientific party. He
had been a shopkeeper’s assistant, but having a preference for the sea, he served his
apprenticeship in a coal vessel. After he spent many years in this vocation, he
entered the Eoyal Navy, and rose to the rank of master. He contrived during his
rough sailor life to gain a sound knowledge of mathematics and navigation; and as
he had shown by the surveys he made in North America, as well as by his proficiency
in astronomy, that he was well fitted to take charge of an expedition of this character,
the choice the Government made was a wise one. Having accomplished, successfully,
at Otaheite, the task imposed on him, he visited New Zealand. In 1777, on his
third voyage, he visited Van Diemen’s Land, cast anchor in Adventure Bay, took in
wood and water, and pronounced the island to be “by far the largest in the world.”
In 1798 Governor Hunter, of New South Wales, gave Flinders and Bass the small
sloop “Norfolk,” for the purpose of making discoveries. They sailed round Van
Diemen’s Land, and during the voyage discovered the river Tamar, and its estuary,
Port Dalrymple.
We have arrived very nearly at the period when Van Diemen’s Land was first
settled. This was effected during the administration of Governor King, when it was
taken possession of and occupied as a dependency of New South Wales. This step
was taken chiefly through a desire to rid Port Jackson of the most dangerous and
riotous of convicts. When the colony at Sydney had recovered from its early trials,
and began to enjoy a little prosperity, a new difficulty for solution presented itself.


It had been established as England’s transportation settlement; but now that free
settlers were making their home in the country, it was found difficult to deal with
the convicts, who, whenever opportunity offered, committed acts similar to those for
which they had been exiled. Nearly seven thousand prisoners had been transported,
amongst whom were many of the “ Young Irelanders ” of 1798, a section certain to
create much trouble, and be a cause of much anxiety to the authorities. What was
to be done ? The want of proper prison accommodation, the recklessness of the
emancipist settlers, and the non-deterrent effect of hanging or flogging on the more
hardened criminals, made the adoption of some new system compulsory, as the
present unsatisfactory condition of the colony at Port Jackson endangered authority,
and would, if allowed to continue, have terminated in a disaster. It was therefore
decided to remove a number of the most violent convicts to Van Diemen’s Land,
which, from its remote distance, would eminently fit it for a second Botany Bay, and
afford less scope for their criminal practices and contaminating influence.
Accordingly, Lieutenant Bowen was sent with his vessel, the “ Lady Nelson,” and
the most turbulent convicts, together with a strong guard of soldiers. They entered
the Derwent from Sydney in June or July of 1803, and chose Risdon, or Restdown,
the estuary of that river, as the site for the settlement. In the same year, 1803, the
English Government determined on forming another penal settlement for their
criminal exiles, at the place so favourably spoken of by Captain Flinders. Collins,
who had about this time proceeded home from Sydney, whither he had accompanied
the first expedition in 1787 to Port Jackson as Judge-Advocate, received charge of
this, the second expedition. He (as can be gathered from the account given in the
“Jubilee History of Melbourne and Victoria,” published in this volume) disapproved
of the place, and pronounced it unsuitable on account of the scarcity of water. While
Collins was yet on his voyage from England, Mr. Grimes, Surveyor-General of New
South Wales, acting on instructions from Governor King, discovered and rowed up
the river, which still retains its native name of Yarra Yarra, or ever flowing, and was,
therefore, unaware of the existence of fresh water at the head of Port Phillip. He
immediately sent a communication to Governor King to the effect that the
colonisation of Port Phillip was impracticable. It is difficult to understand the action
of the Governor in this matter. If Mr. Grimes saw the Yarra, which some authorities
seem to doubt, and if fresh water was the chief obstacle to the formation of a second
colony, it appears singular that Governor King should have, without a further
investigation, given permission for the removal of the settlement. It may not be
improbable that he considered it judicious to avoid a number of scattered convict
communities; but on the other hand, when he gives instructions for the expedition
to cross over to Van Diemen’s Land and unite with that of Lieutenant Bowen, who
had (as already stated) under his control some of the most desperate convicts, the
proceeding becomes inexplicable. True, to bring them to Port Jackson would be
unwise; but at this distant date it seems that although the number of settlements
would not have been reduced, yet some other part of the island (as was done
thereafter) might have been fixed upon. Collins, however, upon whose conduct in


this matter some severe strictures have been passed, glad to remove from the (what
he considered) inhospitable region, left with two vessels containing about four
hundred prisoners, and took charge of the new settlement, landing at Risdon, on the
estuary of the Derwent river. Doubtless, his first impressions were that he had not
bettered the condition of affairs, as he found the party in a state of semi-starvation,
and exposed to attacks from the natives. He determined at once to remove to a
more suitable spot, and selected the opposite side of the Derwent, which possessed
the advantages of security and easy access by store ships. The site chosen was the
mouth of a little creek, with Sullivan’s Bay for its harbour, which was, until lately,
the southernmost city of the world. In a short time the place assumed a very
different appearance, as houses of wattle-and-dauh, with chimneys of stones and
turf, and roofs of grass, were quickly erected. The city was named in honour of
Lord Hobart, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, “Hobart Town.” On
May 3rd, 1804, the death knell of the natives was struck. Edward White, an
occupant of one of the three outlying huts, was busily engaged hoeing some ground
near the creek, at Risdon, when he was startled by great shouting. Looking up, he
saw about three hundred natives armed with waddies, and accompanied by their
women and children, driving a herd of kangaroos before them. That their
intentions were not hostile is inferred from the presence of the women, it being
customary for them to remain behind when there was going to be any fighting.
They were fired upon, and about fifty men, women, and children were killed. White,
in his evidence before a committee of enquiry held in 1830 (matters moved slowly in
those days) by Colonel Arthur, stated that “ they did not attack the soldiers.”
Another witness (Robert Evans) said “ he was not present when the fight began, but
was on the ground immediately afterwards. He was told that the natives did not
interrupt anyone, but that they were fired upon.” He did not know, nor was he
informed who gave the order to fire. The committee’s report was presented some
time after the enquiry, but they found it difficult at so late a period to decide as to
which party were the aggressors. Some of the evidence went to prove that Burke,
whose hut was the outermost on the settlement, was driven from it by the natives.
This commenced a feud, which only terminated with the extermination of the
aborigines. Until the last of them disappeared there was endless trouble on the
island. It is said it might have been otherwise, as they had been proved to be
susceptible to the kindness of strangers. If such were the case, it is difficult to
understand how they could be the aggressors in the first attack of the English.
They were, in addition, exposed to other misfortunes. Bands of convicts, during
the famine on the island, prowled through the country to beg or steal food sufficient
for their daily wants. It was not likely men with their evil passions unbridled
would leave the natives unmolested. They took the kangaroos on which the blacks
relied for subsistence, lured away their women, shot the husbands, murdered babes,
and violated maidens. These atrocities led to savage resentment. Cattle and sheep
were wounded; men and women were murdered if they moved very far away from
the settlement. There appears in the Muster Book of 1810 an order on the subject.


It is dated January 29, 1810; and after expressing fear that the natives, in revenge
tor the murders and cruelties practised upon them by the white people, put to death
Win. Bussell and George Gelley, states that “ the Lieutenant-Governor hereby
declares that any person whomsoever who shall offer violence to a native, or
who shall in cold blood murder, or cause any of them to be murdered, shall, on
proof being made of the same, be dealt with and proceeded against as if such
violence had been offered, or murder committed on, a civilised person.”
In the same year (1804) the Sydney Government sent another party of
convicts, in charge of Colonel Paterson, to found a colony in the northern part of the
island. The settlement was formed at the entrance of Port Halrymple, on the
western arm of the Tamar, and called York Town, and continued to exist in an
independent state until the year 1812, when it was placed under the charge of the
Governor at Hobart Town, thereby putting both sides of the island under the same
government. Lieutenant Laycock and his party performed the first overland journey
between the two places in nine days. In 1807, the settlement which had been
formed at Norfolk Island in 1788 was abandoned by the British Government, and
the convicts removed to Tasmania. Many of these men had undergone a great moral
change for the better, and engaged in farming operations. Some of them settled at
Hobart Town and Pittwater, and others at New Norfolk and at Norfolk Plains.
The deposition and expulsion of Bligh, the Governor of New South Wales,
properly belongs to the history of that colony; but as Collins was concerned in it,
and as he visited Tasmania in 1808, where an unsuccessful attempt to capture him
was made, a short account of the episode may be given here. Bligh succeeded
Governor King in 1806. An excellent seaman, he was sent in his ship, the
“Bounty,” by the British Government to the South Sea Islands for bread-fruit trees,
which he did not succeed in obtaining, as his tyrannical conduct to his sailors raised
a mutiny, which ended by him and some others being put into an open boat, and sent
adrift in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. He was a good navigator, and fearlessly
undertook one of the most remarkable voyages on record. After traversing 8,500 miles
over an unknown ocean, he landed with his party safely on the Island of Timor, lying
north-west of the Gulf of Carpenteria, where they remained; but he was conveyed
home in a vessel. He came out to the South Seas again, with a new ship and crew,
and this time was successful in obtaining and conveying the trees to the British Isles
of the North Pacific. It is difficult to withhold—it would be unjust—admiration for
the man who, in spite of all his sufferings, in spite of all misunderstandings, had the
courage to make a second attempt to carry out what might prove a second failure.
It is well known what sailors were in these days—an ordinary sea-novel will reveal
the fact—and it is highly probable that it was not the fault of this gallant seaman,
in whose body there was not a drop of coward’s blood, that he was so ignominiously
treated on his first expedition. Matthew Arnold says—“ Force till right is ready;”
doubtless that was Lieutenant Bligh’s motto.
Governor Bligh, in his despotic rule of the convicts, some of whom required
it, could not distinguish between this class and the free settlers, whom he treated in
a similar manner. He soon became thoroughly disliked by them, although they


were not slow to acknowledge his humane treatment of the Hawkesbury farmers,
who lost everything by the flood of 1800 ; and although he did everything in his
power to alleviate their distress, for which he was specially thanked by the Biitish
Government, yet his unfortunate manner, and the hard hits he was compelled to
give, nullified his kind-hearted deeds. For the slightest fault the convicts were
flogged, but doubtless this was to preserve discipline; his officers, some of whom
richly deserved it, he treated rather roughly at times. At this period the tiaffic in
spirits, which was carried on in a most unscrupulous manner, assumed so gigantic
proportions that it threatened to produce complete anarchy. Large quantities of
mm were sold among the convicts, and the profits were so enormous, that everyone
who could embarked in this questionable enterprise, some going so far as to introduce
stills for the manufacture of spirits in the colony. Freed convicts, soldiers, officeis,
in short the whole community, were steeped in drunkenness. Riots, atrocities and
debauchery became fearfully prevalent. The only remedy for this demoralised
condition of affairs was to put a stop to the traffic of spirits. Bligh’s predecessor,
Governor King, tried, but failed, to check the evil, and now he was called on to put
it down. With his characteristic vigour he proceeded to effect a reform, caring little
for the hatred of those whose sole object was unpardonable greed. It was a bitter
contest, but in the end the vendors ot the spirits were too many foi him, and he
retired from the struggle completely defeated. We may be sure that this last incident
in the career of one of the most remarkable men of the day did not inciease his
popularity, nor did it effect a change in his administration of the colony, foi on all
sides he made enemies. He increased the bitter hatred of his bitterest foes to such
an extent that they were ready to stop short at nothing, to virtually annihilate him,
and they had not long to wait for an opportunity of venting their spite. A quarrel
between Mr. Macarthur and Mr. Atkin, the new Judge-Advocate of the colony, was
their opportunity. Mr. Macarthur was heavily fined for neglecting to prevent the
escape of a convict in a vessel of which he was part owner. He refused to pay the
fine, and was summoned to the court presided over by Mr. Atkin. On declining to
appear, on the ground that Mr. Atkin was his enemy, he was by that gentleman s
orders seized and imprisoned. A special court, consisting of six officers and
Mr. Atkin, was appointed by Bligh to try him; but Macarthur, on appearing before
it, strongly protested against Mr. Atkin’s presence as his judge, at the same time
stating that he was perfectly willing to accept the decision of the six officers. The
officers considered his protest a reasonable one, and the case fell through. Bligh
was so angry that he threatened them with imprisonment, but their comrades in
the New South Wales corps rallied round them.
In 1810 Governor Collins died suddenly. A report was circulated that he had
committed suicide, but according to the authority of the Rev. John West, “ He died
on March 24th, 1810, while sitting in his chair conversing with his attendant.” The
statement of this gentleman should be sufficient to repel the foul slander, which, no
doubt, was the outcome of malice on the part of some enemy to damage the
reputation of one who was generally regarded as a warm-hearted friend. In 1838
Sir John Franklin, the Governor, erected a handsome monument over his remains.


Although he has been represented as a bad disciplinarian, yet it is well nigh
impossible for those unacquainted with the difficulties attending the discharge of
duty in such a society as that of convicts to appreciate what he had to undergo.
Besides, abuses existed, and calamities incidental to new settlements took place (to which
reference shall be made further on,) and for which little or no blame can attach to him,
and he must have found his administrative abilities tested to the utmost to prevent
them spreading more alarmingly. On the night of his death two Government officers, for
some reason or other, burned all the official documents they could lay their hands on.
As for the progress of the colony during his tenure of office, much cannot be said, as
there was barely any sign of improvement perceptible. There were no roads in the
interior; public buildings were conspicuous by their absence. '1 he house of the Governor
was a mere cottage of the poorest description, and most scanty accommodation ; indeed,
at the close of 1805 he was still living in a tent. The early settlers in Van Diemen’s
Land had to contend with many difficulties and endure great hardships. There were
the bushrangers on the one hand and the aborigines on the other —the former living
by plunder, rapine, and murder; the latter thirsting for revenge, and imbued with
such a bitter hatred of the white intruder that it was considered a virtue to perpetrate
any atrocity, no matter how barbarous. Again, there was another very serious incon-
venience, which is common to all distant settlements —irregular, slow, and expensive
communication with England, or with other countries where they could obtain
supplies, until they were able to cultivate their lands to produce sufficient food for
their wants ; and it is not, therefore, a matter of surprise that the early settlers suffered
very severely from famine and the diseases that follow in its train. Lastly, business
was conducted in a most slipshod and truly primitive manner, which considerably
affected trade, if such a name could be extended to what existed then. Perhaps the
most serious calamity that befell the settlement was the famine occasioned by the
disaster which, in 1806, occurred in New South Wales. Heavy rains caused the
Hawkesbury to overflow its banks to a most alarming extent, the river rising to a
height of five or six feet in some places. It swept everything before it, and created
devastation. The farmers lost all their produce, their live stock, and in many instances
their dwellings. A regular panic ensued, for all the settlements were depending more
or less on garrison regulation, whilst the wheat fields had now become of such
value as to necessitate their protection by means of sentinels. In 1808 the state
of the settlement was pitiable, as absolute starvation was overtaking it. In the month
of August there neither remained maize or wheat, and the supply of salt beef and pork
was also exhausted.
Those on board a vessel approaching the coast saw fragments of the floating
ruins of the dwellings many miles distant from the shore. The poor suffered extreme
destitution, the price of maize and wheat rising to .£5 and ,£0 per bushel, which would
make these commodities worth about £350 and £3OO per ton respectively. As the
B


Government was unable to lend any aid to the colony, it was left to its own resources
and for many years the scarcity continued with fluctuating intensity. The kangaroo
was the principal article of food. Officers who were granted servants sent them to
hunt, and sold their spoil to the Government. This enterprise resulted in many of
those who were successful making large profits. The Commissariat Department
allowed Is. fid. per pound. A marine, with the assistance of two convicts, delivered to
the Government lOOOlbs. of kangaroo per month, and followed up this occupation for
several months. A few biscuits were distributed as long as the supply held out,
but the substitute for bread was the dried and pounded flesh of kangaroo. This
famine was the means of not only causing great privations to the settlers, but also laid
the foundations of those lawless habits which subsequently well nigli mined the colony,
as the Government, unable to provide food, had no alternative but to release the
prisoners, who were sometimes permitted to disperse in search of subsistence. When the
loss of the “ Sydney,” which had been chartered to India, became known, a second effort
was made to obtain a food supply.
Colonel Paterson, while Acting-Governor of New South Wales, contracted with
Captain Bunter, of the “ Venus,” to bring a cargo of wheat from Bengal. It was not
until 1810 that she arrived, but with that arrival all dread of a famine was dispelled,
and the price of wheat fell to 12s. a bushel. The change of wheat proved very bene-
ficial to the farmers, as they were enabled to clear their ground of that mixed and
inferior grain which had proved so disappointing. When at Bengal the captain
received two prisoners supposed to be castaways from the “ Harrington,” seized by one
Stewart, formerly a lieutenant in the navy. The vessel was richly laden, and Stewart
could not forego making an attempt to carry off this prize. Having called together some
of his companions, he submitted his project, which was the first successfully attempted
by prisoners. His plan was that before suspicion could be aroused, to seize a boat,
hurry on board, where he mastered the crew, and was soon scudding before the breeze.
At sea, however, his good fortune deserted him, for the “ Harrington ” was captured by
the “ Greyhound,” and both vessels were lost on the coast of Livonia. These pirates
were permitted to land at the Derwent, and were left behind by the “ Venus,” and were
found at the house of a settler named Garth by soldiers sent to seize spirits secretly
landed from the vessel.
Collins had the misfortune to be involved with the parties responsible in the
deposition of Governor Bligh. New South Wales being so distant from the centre of
commerce, the Crown was induced to provide for the settlers the various articles
necessary for use. At Port Jackson the magazine was filled with every requisite,
such as potters’ ware, kitchen utensils, &c. They were issued at stated prices, which
were less than those for which they could be purchased in Europe; and to guard
against them becoming the objects of speculation, an official order for every issue,
specifying the article, was required. Notwithstanding this precaution room was found


for partiality and corruption. When Blight arrived he found the settlers discontented
and poor, and completely at the mercy of the military officers. Bligh, desiring to take
the settlers out of those dealers’ grasp, who bought their produce at a low price and
gave them in exchange goods at an enormous percentage, permitted the settlers to
draw from the magazine whatever was necessary for private use, on the understanding
that they should deliver their grain to the stores at the close of the harvest. The
officers became irate with this interference. Bligh was arrested on 26th January,
1808. A quarrel with Mr. Macarthur, formerly Paymaster of the New South Wales
Corps, arising out of mercantile transactions, was the origin of the military insurrection.
Having refused to attend a summons, Macarthur was apprehended on a warrant, and
committed for trial. He was charged with the design to stir up the people of the
colony to hatred of the Governor and Government. Except the President of the
Court, the officers were more favourable to Macarthur than to Bligh, and regarded him
as a victim. Mr. Macarthur, when addressing the Court, objected to the Judge
Advocate, on the grounds that he was of disreputable character and was hostile towards
him, whereupon the Judge Advocate threatened to commit him for contempt of
Court. Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp interposed by threatening to commit the Judge
Advocate, who, seeing many soldiers wearing side-arms, and apprehensive of his
personal safety, left the bench. Macarthur appealed to the officers to protect him
against the constabulary, an appeal emphasised by calling them ruffians. The officers
immediately ordered the soldiers present to do so. This act was pronounced as an
illegal rescue. Macarthur surrendered to the Provost-Marshal, and was lodged in gaol.
The Governor resolved to bring to trial the six officers who had interfered with the
Judge Advocate. As a precautionary step they were ordered to appear before the
bench of Magistrates, of whom Colonel Johnston, their commander, was one. This
order was suspected to be the initiative in constituting a novel court of criminal
jurisdiction, and that he was resolved to carry out his declared hostility. In order to
avert serious complications, Colonel Johnston was named to march his regiment to
Government House, and place His Excellency under arrest —demanding his sword
and commission as Governor. Various opinions exist as to the origin and necessity
for this transaction, which caused a great sensation both in the colony and in the old
country. The unfortunate termination of Bligh’s first expedition to Tahiti, his
reputed harshness and cruelty, and the employment of disreputable agents at times in
his service, rendered the position of the officers precarious. Bligh had become
popular with the expiree settlers, who reckoned a long arrear of vengeance on the
military for supposed or real acts of cruelty, and who, with the law in their favour and
the countenance of the Governor, would hardly deal leniently. Bligh was permitted to
embark on board the “Porpoise” on condition that he would proceed forthwith to> Great
Britain, engaging not to communicate with any intermediate British colony. He
bound himself on his honour to make no attempt at interference with the existing


Government. He, however, soon forgot his word, for when once on board the “ Porpoise”
he ordered the lieutenant to bombard Sydney and restore his authority by force. This
order was not obeyed. He, however, sailed to the Derwent, where his vessel was still
lying. Bligh had despatched information of the insurrection at the earliest possible
moment, and the home Government lost no time in forwarding more troops. The
ships approached the harbour prepared to raise a blockade, but Colonel Paterson,
the officer in command, handed over the reins of Government to the newly appointed
Governor, General Macquarie. The greater part of his (Paterson’s) official acts were
cautiously endorsed by Governor Macquarie, but the gifts and appointments of the
interim Government were declared null and void. When Bligh went to Hobart Town,
Collins, not aware of what had transpired at Sydney, received him with ,t|ie respect due
to his station.
When despatches were received from Sydney, Collins, Bligh says, attempted to
arrest him, but Bligh returned in the “ Porpoise” to Port Jackson, although the time for
his restitution was passed, and was received with respectful formality. This affair of
Bligh’s was the last important occurrence in the life of Collins.
His death was unexpected and sudden ; except a slight cold there was little
warning of its approach. He died whilst sitting in his chair, and holding a conversation
with his attendant. Over 600 persons were present at his funeral, which was
celebrated with all the ceremony the colony could command. It has been generally
considered that the share he had in the deposition of Bligh must necessarily have upset
him, and hastened his end. In the early part of 1810, the first newspaper printed in the
colony, and projected by Collins, made its appearance under the title of the Derwent
Star and Van Diemens Land Intelligencer. It was a quarto leaf with broad margin, and
was issued fortnightly at two shillings per copy. It appears from the Van Diemen’s
Land Almanac of 1820 that Governor Collins brought out the press and type, which,
in the first place, were utilised for printing his orders both at Port Phillip and Van
Diemen’s Land, under what may be regarded as a most primitive press-room or rather
press-ground, a tree in the woods. The editor was G. P. Harris, Deputy Surveyor-General,
and the paper was printed by J. Barnes and T. Clark at the “ Government Press, Hobart
Town,” the Governor supervising everything. The venture having failed to pay, even at
two shillings per copy, its existence lasted but a few months. Perhaps its failure was due
to the fact that although such an insignificant sheet, it was much too large for the
settlement, where a birth or marriage was published in preference to the appearance of
a paragraph, where little or no advertising notices were required, where there was no
taste for general literature, and where politics were, comparatively speaking, unknown.
The chief contents were anecdotes of a droll description and thrilling exploits, some of
the latter being as odd as the adventures of Don Quixote. In the second number
there was at least some news afforded to its readers, as it contained a grandiloquent
account of Governor Macquarie’s inauguration at Sydney. The next issue contained


a description of the feat of Captain Barclay, of Uray, Aberdeenshire, the pedestrian
who accomplished a thousand miles in a thousand hours; the wonderful longevity of
Joseph Ram, a Jamaica black, who died in his 140 th year; then the ponderosity of
Lambert, whose body weighed 7281b5. or 52 stone, a weight which none of our present
automatic weighing machines could register. His body was sent by an inclined
plane into the grave on account of it being too heavy to lift. Collins was buried in
the churchyard of St. David’s, Hobart Town. To provide a temporary place for public
worship a small wooden church was erected and its altar was over his grave. During
the prevalence of a terrific storm the building was blown down and the materials were
carried off, thus leaving the resting place of Collins long exposed, until Sir John
Franklin, who arrived in the colony in January, 1837, as Governor of Van Diemen's
Land, reared a monument to the first Governor of the Island bearing the following
inscription :
SACRED
To the Memory of
DAVID COLLINS, ESQ.,
Lieutenant-Governor of this Colony,
And Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal Marine Forces.
On the first establishment of the Colony of New South Wales, he was
employed as Judge Advocate,
And in the Year 1803
He was entrusted by His Majesty’s Government with the command of an expedition
destined to form a settlement at Port Phillip, on the south coast of
New Holland, but which was subsequently removed to
VAN DIEMEN’S LAND.
Under bis Direction as Lieutenant-Governor, the site of the town was chosen,
and the foundation of its first building
Laid in 1804,
He died here on the 28th of March, 1810,
AGED 56 YEARS.
And this Monument long projected, was erected to his memory in 1838,
by direction of
His Excellency Sir John Franklin, K.C.H., K.R.


CHAPTEE 11.
THE COLONY DURING THE INTERIM AND UNDER GOVERNOR DAVEY.
1810-1813; 1813-1817.
•N the demise of Colonel Collins, Lieutenant Edward Lord administered the
affairs of the colony until Captain Murray, of the 73rd Regiment, arrived and
assumed the reins of government, his successor being Lieutenant-Colonel Geils.
During Captain Murray’s administration the Governor-in-Chief visited the colony in
1811, an event which was regarded with great feelings of exultation. The Governor
was most enthusiastically received, addresses by delegates were delivered, and the
windows of the scattered cottages were illuminated. There is nothing remarkable
in this visit except that Governor Macquarie traced the plan of the future city.
The centre of the projected town he called St. George’s Square, where he intended
to rear a church and town hall, and the quarters of the main guard. The open
space he designed for a market, and the streets intersecting each other he called
by the names which still distinguish them : Liverpool Street after the Minister of
that day, Macquarie Street after himself, Elizabeth Street in honour of Lady
Macquarie, Argyle Street after his native country, and Murray Street out of
compliment to the officer in command. The plan sketched by Governor Macquarie
was not absolutely followed; he ordered the erection of a signal-staff on Mount
Nelson named after the vessel which conveyed him to and from the island. His
devotedness was fully appreciated by the settlers on the Derwent, and they were
loud in praising his courage in risking the visit, more especially when accompanied by,
what they termed, his consort. In February, 1812, Colonel Geils became Acting
Lieutenant-Governor, a position which he held until the arrival of Colonel Davey.
Previous to dealing with the events which occurred during Governor Davey’s
administration, it may prove interesting to state that the first Tasmanian house stood
on land adjoining the Macquarie Hotel, and was built by Lieutenant E. Lord, of
wattle and dab. It was cf rather primitive construction, since its windows represented
those of the portholes of a vessel. Owing to its having been the first house, it must
therefore claim distinction, and it was regarded by those who viewed it as the first step
towards civilisation, and the initiation of the breaking down of the barrier which
separates savagery from culture. The construction consisted of posts fixed in the


ground and joined by wall plates. It was woven with wattle rods plastered with mingled
clay and sand and short wiry grass, and whitened. It had a grass-thatched roof, and
a chimney of turf piled on stone.
Colonel Davey, the second Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, reached the
scene of his future labours on 4th February, 1813. His manner of entrance was the
subject of much comment, inasmuch as the day being warm, he, upon landing from the
ship in the afternoon, walked through the streets on his way to Government House
with his shirt-sleeves exposed, and his coat carelessly slung across his arm. This
spectacle was but the foretaste of his subsequent administration. He took pleasure in
practical jokes and humour far from that indulged in by a gentleman, and especially by
one delegated to represent the Crown. He lacked the capacity to govern, and his free
and easy manner betrayed the want of that depth of character and judgment which
were at that period in the colony’s history essentially needful. He had a strong love for
spirituous liquors, and was “ hail fellow well met ” with everyone who invited him to
drink. The young colony was rapidly sinking into a demoralised condition, and it is
not to be wondered at that Davey’s administration would be calculated to intensify the
evil, since he failed to command the respect of the small community. On what principle
he was selected to conduct the affairs of such a settlement it would be difficult to state.
As a marine he had been present at many important actions, notably that of the battle
of Trafalgar.
For some reason best known to himself, he concealed his intended departure
from his family, who, having accidentally heard of it, reached the ship by extraordinary
exertions, and at the same time quite unprepared with the usual outfit for a voyage.
The ship conveying his luggage was taken by the Americans during the war, for which
he was indemnified by the largest grant ever conferred in Tasmania—3ooo acres—
considering that it was generally believed the captors had not made an extensive prize.
Mrs. Davey was spoken of with respect, and the Governor himself with kindness, seeing
that his failings were of the head and not of the heart. During Davey’s government
two hundred female prisoners were brought from Sydney in the brig “ Kangaroo,” A
proclamation was issued, inviting the settlers to receive them. They landed and
disappeared, some being carried into the bush, where they changed their destination
before they reached their homes, and in many instances it is stated that these peculiar
unions were fraught with all the customary felicity of conjugal life. Although Davey
was a poor administrator, considerable progress was made during his time in developing
the resources of the colony. The ports were open for general commerce in June, 1813,
mercantile houses were established, and English goods were imported direct from Great
Britain, which were supplied by Messrs. Kemp and Gatehouse, and Messrs. E. Lord and
J. H. Reibey Very often the most necessary articles were found wanting, and the
settlers purchased even the clothing of the prisoners in preference to the skins of the
animals which were used for garments, The whale fishery was a profitable enterprise.


A lucrative trade in sealskins from the islands of Bass’ Straits, the haunt of whalers,
was established. In 1815, 1770 bushels of wheat were exported to Sydney, and in 1816
the export of wheat to the same port rose to 13,135 bushels. A flour mill was erected,
and the use of the hoe in breaking up ground having been gradually superseded by the
employment of oxen and the plough, a belter system of tillage obtained. On 19th
February, 1817, the foundation-stone of the first church built in Tasmania was laid by
Governor Davey, in the presence of Mrs. and Miss Davey, and a grand procession of
several military officers. Bev. Mr. Knopwood, who preached on the occasion, selected
as his text, “ For other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jesus
Christ.” After the delivery of a Masonic oration by a member of the order, Governor Davey
proclaimed a public holiday, and in conformity with his eccentric behaviour, oidered
half-a-pint of spirits to be served out to each of the soldiers and constables on this
“ Thanksgiving Day.” “It is not pleasing to record such a questionable mode of observ-
ing a holiday, which was intended to celebrate the building of a church in a new land.
One is led to draw comparisons between the spiritual indifference and moral depravity
which marked the first settlements of Australia, and the holy devotion of those early
settlers who founded the American States.* Nothing is better calculated to give an idea of
the indifference of the early settlers to religious observances than the fact that the colony
had been inexistence for fourteen years before the first church was commenced, and
that St. David’s, as it was called, was in progress of construction for four years before
it was completed. The only court was the Lieutenant-Governor’s Court, established in
the year 1814. It dealt only with personal actions in matters under the value of TSO,
all other cases, civil and criminal, being tried at Sydney. On 14th May, 1814, the
Van Diemen's Land Gazette made its appearance, but, like its predecessor, was short-
lived, it having expired at the end of September of the same year after the issue of
nine fortnightly numbers. The advancement of the colony was very much hindered
at this period by the depredations carried on by gangs of armed bushrangers. They
struck terror in every direction throughout the country districts. The rapidity with
which these outlaws changed their base of operations was marvellous. One day they
would be seen at Launceston, and shortly afterwards they were to be met with in the
southern part of the island.
They committed all sorts of atrocities, not even excepting murder in cold blood.
To check this state of affairs Colonel Davey declared the whole colony under martial
law. All those quitting their houses by night, whether free or bond, were punished with
flogging, many of the offenders undergoing sentence of death. The Governor-in-Chief,
although six hundred of the inhabitants expressed their approval of this step, promptly
forbade such extreme measures, which had on many previous occasions been pursued.
This state of affairs was brought about in part by Colonel Davey, whose incapacity to
rule caused a lack of zeal on the part of the officials to preserve law and order. When
♦Fenton.


Governor Collins lived some order was maintained; but it was hopeless to expect, with
such a man as Colonel Davey at the head of affairs, that a due regard to law and order
should be paid. He was a man given to dissipation, and on the station which he
selected not far from town, he provided for a bacchanalian revel. The tent was
surrounded hy the more talented of the convicts, who entertained the Governor with
songs. Rum in large quantities was served out, first to the chiefs and then to the
retainers; and it was not an uncommon thing to see the gaol gang wandering after their
inebriate ruler, and frequently the Governor and his retainers might be seen going home
together. The newspaper press, which as has been already mentioned unsuccessful
attempts were made to found in the years 1810 and 1814, was permanently established
in 1816. Andrew Bent, who was known from his subsequently long literary career as
the father of the u Van Diemen’s Land Press,” published the first number of the
Hohart Town Gazette by authority on Ist June, 1816. The matter for the paper was
supplied, and its proprietor paid by the Government, Nothing could more fully
demonstrate the laxity of morals prevalent at the time than the official announcement
in the first number of the Gazette , relative to the birthday of King George 111.,
ordaining that “ one pound of fresh meat, and one half-pint of spirits be supplied to
the soldiers and constables that their loyalty might be duly maintained." The second
number contained a Government notice which shows the depth of degradation to which
the inhabitants had sunk. The bodies of the felons which were gibbeted on Hunter’s
Island were close to the place where the wharf is erected, and became objects of
disgust especially to the female sex. They have been removed (by command of his
Honour the Lieutenant-Governor) to a point of land near Queenborough—now Sandy
Bay—which in future will be the place of execution.” The Gazette first consisted of
only two pages of foolscap, and in 1824 it was enlarged to four pages. In the early
years of the paper its proprietor was obliged to face many difficulties, and at length on
3rd April, 1819, he made an appeal to his subscribers to pay him in kind for their
arrears, which in some cases amounted to three years’ subscriptions, and for which he
must otherwise sue for payment. The Sydney Gazette , a contemporary of Bent’s paper,
did not fail to support his appeal in the most encouraging manner. Bent was short
of type, as shown by the use of capitals in the middle of words, and had to make his
own ink. He plodded on in conducting the only newspaper in the colony with bad
paper and bad type for ten years. As late as 1824 he had frequently to use a sort of
Chinese paper, about half the size of foolscap, and of which two sheets were pasted
together for each issue. This paper cost two guineas sterling per ream. During
Governor Davey’s administration the south and west coasts were explored by Captain
James Kelly, who went round the island in a small whale-boat manned by four men.
He named a large inlet on the south coast, which he entered on the 17th December,
1815, Port Davey, in honour of the Lieutenant-Governor. The eastern arm he named
Bathurst Harbour, in honour of Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State for the Colonies.


On the 28th of the same month he named Macquarie Harbour in honour of the
Governor-General. Elizabeth Island was named after Mrs. Gordon, of Pittvvater.
Sarah Island and Birch’s Inlet were named after Mr. and Mrs. TTo. o W. Birch, of
Hobart Town ; and the Gordon River after Mr. James Gordon, of Pittwater. Captain
Kelly left Macquarie Harbour on Ist January, 1816, and sailed along the shore in a
northerly direction; touched the Hunters group of islands, then rounding the north-
west coast he called in at what is now known as Port Sorrell, and reached Poit
Dalrymple on 9th January. When Kelly’s party landed at the George Town
Wharf, they received a rather warm reception, and as they were mistaken for
bushrangers, were handcuffed. As soon, however, as Major Stewart, the Commandant,
saw Captain Kelly’s clearance papers signed by Captain Nairn, at Hobart Town, he
was satisfied, and they were immediately liberated and treated in a most kindly manner.
It was necessary to take the utmost precaution in protecting the camp, as the bush-
ranger, Michael Howe, was at large at the time. Captain Kelly, during his voyage of
exploration along the coast, had several interviews with the natives, one tribe of which,
numbering about fifty, he encountered at Hunter’s Island. The following is his
narrative of the meeting :
“ They were all armed with spears and waddies. We immediately brought the
arms from the boat and put ourselves into a state of defence. They began to advance
slowly towards us near the fire. We held up our pieces and made signs for them not
to come any closer. They held up their spears in return, accompanying their
movements with loud laughing. They jeered at us, as it they thought we were afraid
sf their formidable band. We thought it desirable to retreat to the boat, when
suddenly they laid down their weapons in the edge of the bush and each holding up
their hands as if they did not mean mischief, at the same time making signs to us to
lay down our arms, which we did to satisfy them ; for if we had retreated quickly to
the boat, it was probable they would have killed every one of us before we could have
got out of range of their spears. The natives then began to come to us, one by one,
holding up their hands to show they had no weapons, but we kept a good look-out that
they had no spears between their toes as on a former occasion. They had none.
There were twenty-two came to the fire. We made signs to them that no more should
be allowed to come. Upon that being understood two others came from the bush
together. One of them seemed to be a chief, a stout, good-looking man, about six
feet high and apparently thirty years of age ; the other an old man, about six feet
seven inches high, with scarcely a bit of flesh on his bones. When the chief came
he ordered them all to sit down on the ground, which they did and formed a sort of
circle round the fire. The chief ordered the old man to dance and sing, as if to amuse
us, which he did, making ugly faces and putting himself into most singular attitudes.
While the old man was engaged in his dancing and singing, we found it was only to
divert our attention from what the chief and his men were doing. He ordered them


to gather pebble stones about the size of bens’ eggs, and put them between their legs as
they sat for the purpose, as we apprehended, of making an attack. Our men began to
get alarmed, expecting some mischief would be done. We planned it that we would give
them a few swans and get off as well as we could. Briggs brought two swans from the
boat, one under each arm. When the chief saw them he rushed at Briggs to take the
swans from him, but did not succeed. He then ordered his men to give us a volley of
stones, which they did, he giving the time in most beautiful order, swinging his arms
three times and at each swing calling Yah I Yah ! Yah! and a severe volley it was. I
had a large pair of duelling pistols in my pocket, loaded with two balls each, and seeing
there was no alternative I fired amongst them, which dispersed them ; the other I fired
after they ran away. Two of them dragged Briggs along the ground a little distance to
get the swans from him, but were unsuccessful. The chief and his men ran into the
bush, but were quickly out of sight. On looking round after they had all scampered
we found the six foot seven inches gentleman lying on his back on the ground. We
thought of course he was dead, but on turning him over to examine his wounds, found
that he had no blemish on him. His pulse was going at 130. It must have been the
reports of the pistols which frightened him. We set him on his feet to see if he could
walk; he opened his eyes and trembled very much. We led him a few feet towards
the bush. He stood up straight, looked round him, and took one jump towards the
scrub—the next leap he was out of sight. As soon as he was lost to our view the hills
around echoed with the shouts of joy from the voices of men, women and children.”
Colonel Davey’s administration of the colony ceased in April, 1817. He remained
for some time as a settler; but being not successful, he returned to England, where he
died on 2nd May, 1823. At the close of Governor Davey’s administration the popula-
tion of the colony was 3114, of whom 566 resided on the northern side of the island.


CHAPTER 111.
GOVERNOR SORRELL'S ADMINISTRATION.
1817-1824.
«OLONEL WILLIAM SORRELL was the third governor of Van Diemen’s
Land, and arrived on Bth April, 1817. He was not much impressed with the
aspect of affairs, as Hobart Town was little better than a collection of huts;
but considering that it was only founded fifteen years previously, and that its founders
were intent more on protecting themselves from the ravages of bushrangers, it could
not he expected to be a town of more than the rudest construction. The houses were
in general of the meanest description, the majority being one storey in height, and
weatherboarded without and lath-plastered within. The Government House was of
very had construction. During the first year of his administration the Governor removed
from his dwelling-house in Barrack Square to a new Government House in Macquarie
Street, which has since been considerably enlarged. When Lieutenant-Governor Sorrell
arrived there were no schools, and no buildings set apart for divine worship save an old
shed, known as the King’s stores, being occasionally used for that purpose. There was
at this time no system of control for the male and female prisoners. The want of a
security of quarters for the night enabled the men employed by the Government to
roam about and commit all kinds of heinous offences at their pleasure. The convict
women were supplied with food and clothing, but no place of shelter was afforded them
for the night—a condition of affairs which naturally led to a degree of depravity never
paralleled in the annals of British colonisation. Indeed, to such an extent had depravity
been carried that Government officials were found cohabiting with the convict women,
and it was no wonder that the rite of matrimony was neglected. The sales of wives were
common : one wife having been sold for fifty ewes ; another for five pounds and a gallon
of rum; and a third for twenty ewes and a gallon of rum —a bottle of rum in the
interim passing for one pound sterling. Although this may seem a very depraved state
of affairs in the early days of the history of Tasmania, the writer distinctly .saw, in the
year 1869, a man leading, or rather driving, his wife up by what is known as a straw
wisp, to the market square of the city of Armagh, Ireland, and selling her by auction
for one shilling. Advertisements frequently appeared in the local paper to the effect


that wives had deserted their husbands without any provocation, and that they would
not he responsible for any debts their wives might incur. Bushrangers were ranging
at large in formidable gangs, harassing and intimidating the settlers. The system of
convict discipline alternated between laxity and severity, according to the caprice of the
official. Owing to the vagueness and confusion of the statutes relating to penal
colonists, no redress was available.
The first step taken by Governor Sorrell was to call the inhabitants together so
as to deliberate on various matters relating to the welfare of the community. He
su S^ es^ tfmt subscriptions should be given towards a reward fund for the suppression
of bushranging- a proposal which the respectable inhabitants cordially accepted and
liberally responded to. Owing to this step, the capture of many noted bushrangers
was effected by the soldiers and constables, who now felt that they were supported by
law and authority, and in less than three months the majority of these ruffianly bands
was either captured or destroyed. The result was that the dwellers in their home-
steads could ply their callings by day, or rest at night without fear of being molested
under Sorrell’s mode of discipline, who, like the present Chief Secretary of Ireland,
never hesitated in doing his duty towards law-abiding citizens ; and consequently Van
Diemen’s Land began to assume the appearance more of a British colony than it had
hitherto done.
Sorrell did all in his power to encourage immigration, and during his
administration free settlers were constantly arriving in ships direct from Great Britain.
Several officers, retired from the army and navy, were among the number, as well as
other gentlemen of moderate capital. This immigration imparted a new tone to the
social character of the colony. The early settlers were mostly emancipists, who received
small grants of land in proximity to each other in localities which appeared favourable
for agricultural pursuits, where they erected such dwellings, tilled the land in a most
primitive manner, and lived in a loose way. The new settlers were men of intelligence
and character, and their influence soon began to be felt in an improved state of things.
Each settler on his arrival received a grant of land in proportion to the capital he
brought with him, the maximum area being 2560 acres, equal to four square miles;
but exceptions to the rule were freely admitted afterwards, and additional grants of 640
and even 1280 acres were bestowed according to the will of the Governor, who
possessed almost absolute authority in such matters. Settlers also received loans of
stock and seed from the Government, rations for themselves and their convict servants
for six months, and they were guaranteed 10s. per bushel for all the wheat they grew,
and 6d. per pound for meat. These concessions were withdrawn in 1818; but the
system of granting land free of all charges saving a small quit rent continued until 1830.
With the influx of settlers, the demand for sheep and cattle to stock the pastures
increased. The first stock was introduced by Colonel Paterson; but the quality was
greatly improved by the importation of 300 lambs from the flocks of Captain John


Macarthur, of Camden, New South Wales, who visited England in 1803, and obtained
one ewe and nine rams from the royal flock of pure merinos at Kew. Wool was
not an article of export from Van Diemen’s Land in 1818; it was considered worthless.
In 1819 the Colonial Government bought several tons at 3d. per pound, and the
captain of an English trader accepted some in exchange for merchandise. In 1822
Mr. Henry Hopkins offered a cash price for wool, and bought twelve hales at 4d. per
pound. This was the entire export of the colony that year, and it was sold in London
at 7d. per pound.
The sheep brought by the first fleet to New South Wales were sacrificed to the
necessities of the time; the cattle strayed, and were discovered long afterwards grazing
on the Nepean, where they increased to many hundreds Several efforts were made
by the New South Wales Corps to introduce a stock chiefly for the knife; but the
transmission was attended with considerable difficulty, and the greater portion died.
The basis of the New South Wales stock was the Bengal; these, bearing hair, were
mixed with sheep originally from Holland, and imported from the Cape. Mr.
Macarthur having obtained some sheep from inland remarked the great, though acci-
dental, improvement in the fleece, which exhibited a mixture of wool, and gave the
first hint of a possible improvement.
The results surpassed all expectation. The flocks of Bengal yielded to three or
four crossings, and produced the finest wool. Ihe ewe produced wool worth 9d., her
lamb’s wool was valued at 35., and even the merino improved by the exchange of
climate ; its wool, produced at the Cape, being worth 4s. 6d., and in New South Wales 6s.
The rate of increase was not less encouraging: produce of fifty ewes in seven years
was 2000.
Macarthur requested the Crown to grant the use of public lands and servants,
and offered to supply the Commissariat at a given price, and to sustain the entire
risk or loss of his experiment. The statement of increase was doubted ; the testimony
respecting the quality of wool could not be disputed, and Macarthur had procured the
certificates of eminent manufacturers. It was, however, asserted that the natural
pasture would not give subsistence to flocks. Macarthur proposed to sell his flock at
their value to a company and on credit, on condition that the company procured
a grant from the Crown for pasture. This was declined; but Lord Camden was
requested by their lordships to encourage Macarthur, and he received in consequence
permission to occupy the said pastures, where natural fences prevented the
intermixture of his flocks. It was not until 1820 that settlers of Van Diemen’s Land
entered the career of improvement. The original stock was introduced by Colonel
Paterson—a mixture of Teeswater, Leicester, and Bengal breeds. By dn engagement
with Macarthur 300 were shipped from Sydney; but more than one-third died; the
rest were distributed to the settlers by lot, who gave the engagements to repay at the
stipulated sum, and who secured facilities for the experiment in suitable tickets of


occupation. Macarthur secured, at 7s, 6d. per acre, 4368 acres of land for 300 lambs,
valued to the Crown at <£s per head.
From this date (1820) the wool of the Tasmanian flocks became known to
commerce. Van Diemen’s Land wool was not an article of export until 1819. Only
71,0001b5. had been sent to London from New South Wales, but some had realised
even 7s. 6d. per pound; in one instance 10s. it is said was paid—three times greater
than the Lnglish price of the finest Continental wool. A specimen had been manu-
factured for George IV., and which so pleased him that he directed Sir J. Bloomfield
to inquire if more could be obtained in England. There seemed now no hesitation
in giving credit to Macarthur’s prediction that the boundless pastures of New South
Wales would relieve the manufacturers of dependence on Spain. That great encourage-
ment had not been afforded and greater progress accomplished, may be considered
surprising. The wool of commerce was still inconsiderable, although the flocks of
both colonies amounted to 200,000. Before the merino was introduced, the fleece was
considered worthless. The operation of shearing was often delayed until the sheep
were injured ; it was a deduction from the profit. The wool was burnt, or thrown
into the stockyards as manure.
In 1819 the captain of the “ Regalia” accepted a proportion of Van Diemen’s
Land wool in exchange for merchandise.
To Mr. Henry Hopkins the public are indebted for the first appreciation of
Tasmanian wool. In September, 1821, he offered by advertisement a price in money,
and bought at Id. per pound. Twelve bales were sold in London, the entire wool export
of the colony, for 7d. per pound, or £88; the expenses amounting to nearly half that
sum. Merchants continued to purchase, settlers to improve, their flocks. In 1823
five hundred and fifty bales were exported in the “ Deveron,” and an equal quantity in
other vessels; and the wool of Clarendon rivalled the flocks of Port Jackson. Melville
and Bent relate some curious facts concerning trade and the medium of exchange.
Promissory notes were freely circulated, every trader issuing them from sixpence upwards.
The want of coin induced the Government to pay the debts it incurred in rum, which,
commonly valued at £1 per bottle, passed from hand to hand. In 1810 dollars were
imported from Bengal; the centre was struck out, and valued at Is. 3d.; but the ring
dollar was issued at its original value of ss. The Government, however, received it
back at 45., thus gaining 20 per cent. Macquarie visited Van Diemen’s Land a second
time in 1821. On his former visit in 1811, the population then being 1500; now
(1821) it was 7400, with greatly augmented resources; 15,000 acres of cultivated land,
35,000 head of horned cattle, 170,000 sheep, 560 horses, and 5000 swine, Macquarie
was received with great enthusiasm, and His Excellency was delighted with the reception,
climate, place and people. He found the colony in a comparatively comfortable con-
dition, and the free inhabitants prosperous; 426 houses in Hobart Town, and
2700 souls.


The Governor-General was fond of giving names. He named the towns of
Perth, Campbelltown, Oaklands, Brighton, Roseneath, Sorrell, and Elizabeth Town,
The latter was named after his wife, but was afterwards abandoned in favour of its
present name, New Norfolk. Macquarie Street, Plains, Harbour, and River were
named after the Governor-General. St. David’s Anglican Church, which was
commenced during Davey’s government, was not completed until 1822, and was
consecrated in the following year by the Rev. Samuel Marsden, Senior Chaplain of
New South Wales, and on the same occasion the burial ground was consecrated. The
Rev. Robert Knopwood, the first clergyman to reach Van Diemen’s Land, arrived in
the colony with Collins’ fleet in 1803. In addition to his clerical functions, he
regularly presided at the magisterial bench. Great exception has been taken to him
acting as a magistrate, as it is said the office interfered considerably with his
ministerial duties ; but it must be interposed that in those days the number out of
which a selection for such a post could be made was very limited, and we question very
much whether the clergymen of the present day, who are obliged to get up bazaars
and tea-meetings, do not find that their really spiritual vocation is seriously disturbed
thereby. Be this as it may, iie was not, however, the heau ideal of a spiritual adviser,
and it is only his convivial friends who made light of his freaks of folly, whilst his little
white pony also gained some notoriety. Service, during the long interval that elapsed
from the laying of the foundation-stone of St. David’s until the completion of the
edifice, was held under the verandah of Government House, then a wooden building
in Barrack Square (weather permitting,) or in the King’s store. Mr. Knopwood
received a grant of thirty acres of land at Cottage Green, Hobart Town, reaching over
what is now known as the New Wharf and Battery Point, one of the most valuable
sites in the colony; he was subsequently appointed chaplain to a country district.
Mr. Knopwood offered the whole block for .£BOO. Mr. Knopwood died in 1838, and
was succeeded by the Rev. William Bedford. He may be regarded as what is now
known as a Broad Churchman. In the absence of a clergyman it was customary for
the magistrates to conduct public worship, or, where that was not possible, to assemble
the prisoners, and, after inspection, to address to them a few words of advice.
The Rev. Benjamin Carvosso, whose ship called at Hobart Town in May, 1820,
on her way to Sydney, was the first Wesleyan minister to visit the island, and
delivered his first discourse on 18th August, 1820, from the steps of the Courthouse.
The text was from Ephesians, “ Wherefore He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” That the colony required such
addresses may be gathered from Mr. Carvosso’s description of the inhabitants, whom
he pronounced to be kindly, but dissolute. At New Norfolk and Pittwater, with a
population of several hundreds, no religious services had been held. The effect of
Mr. Carvosso’s eloquent appeals to the spiritual condition of his audience was
exhibited in a most marked degree. Several soldiers of the 68th Regiment who at


Sydney had embraced the doctrine of Methodism were quartered in the island, urged
a Mr. Noakes to secure a room for worship. Eight persons met on 29th October,
1820, at a house in Collins Street, Hobart Town, and next removed to the residence
of a Mr. Wallis. Corporal Waddy, who appears to have been their leader, was, together
with the soldiers, during the. hour that they were joining in praise, prayer and exhorta-
tion, violently assailed with great fury; their devotions, although for a time disturbed,
were, through the interference of the Governor, allowed to proceed quietly. The
landlord of the house, however, grew weary of the undertaking, and consequently they
were obliged to seek a place of refuge. Donne, a carpenter, whose “ lay-to ” formed a
workshop, was entreated to arrange it for worship, to which he at first gave a hesitating
consent, whilst his wife, who was a Romanist, opposed the project in a most vigorous
manner. Owing, however, to her superstitious feelings, which were brought into full
play on that night when a violent thunder-storm set in, and caused the house to sway
to and fro, she at once submitted to the Methodists having the use of the house. The
building, becoming too small, it was enlarged to accommodate 300 persons. A society
of fourteen members was constituted, and on 13th May, 1821, a Sunday school was
established—the first in Van Diemen’s Land. This is the more remarkable, since it was
done in the absence of a minister. This man, Donne, had been a prisoner, but lived to
acquire the confidence and esteem of his neighbours. His proper name was Cranmer, and
he is said to have been a descendant of the illustrious Archbishop Cranmer. Mr. Noakes,
the organiser in great part of Wesleyanism in the colony, becoming dissatisfied with
the results, withdrew from their fellowship in 1823. On 21st September, 1821,
the Rev. W. Horton arrived, and began to work most zealously amongst his people;
but his description of the social state of the country is most depressing, the majority of
deaths being caused by accident or drunkenness. He received a church grant of two
acres at Hobart Town from Governor Sorrell, but the site was not considered suitable
for a church. Mr. David Lord gave a small block of land in Melville Street for the
erection of a place of worship. By his indefatigability he succeeded in obtaining
contributions of cash and material to the extent of £4OO, but this amount was not
sufficient, as the walls which had been raised remained long uncovered. In 1823
Mr. Horton retired, and the Rev. R. Mansfield, from New South Wales, succeeded him.
By his exertions, and by obtaining timber and labour from the Government, whilst
gifts and loans were provided by the Society in England, the chapel was at length
completed. In 1822, owing to Mr. Carvosso’s accounts of the material and moral
prospects of the colony, many persons of a religious tendency were induced to embark
for Van Diemen’s Land. They sailed in the “ Hope,” and encountered great dangers
in the British Channel. On their complaints the vessel was seized under an Act for
the protection of passengers, and the “ Heroine ” being chartered for the purpose, they
were transmitted at the expense of the Government. The owners, who accused the
passengers of conspiracy, successfully appealed against the seizure. The first Roman
Catholic clergyman was the Rev. Philip Conolly, a man said to be of the same genial


disposition as his friend, Bobby Knopwood, of the Anglican Church, with whom he was
on intimate terms. He arrived in the island from Sydney in March, 1821, and he held
his services first in Mr. Curr’s store in Bathurst Street, Hobart Town. Land was
granted by the Crown, for the use of the Roman Catholic community, in Harrington
Street, where a plain wooden edifice was afterwards erected. Many amusing stories are
told of Father Conolly’s eccentricities —amongst the rest the extraordinary one of the
selection of penances for the offences of his flock. The Rev. Archibald Macarthur was
the first Presbyterian minister at Hobart Town, where he preached his first sermon in
the colony on 12th January, 1823. At this time there were several Scotch families
residing in the island, who befriended the Church of their fathers, Sir Thomas
Brisbane, then Governor-General at Sydney, who belonged to the Scottish Church,
aiding the cause in Van Diemen’s Land with a liberal subscription. Messrs. Scott,
Bethune, Ogilvie, Turnbull—the latter afterwards becoming ordained as clergyman of
the church—and Dr. Officer (afterwards Sir Robert Officer,) were among the early
supporters of Presbyterianism. The Presbyterian Church at Hobart Town was opened
on 12th September, 1824. Mr. Macarthur, who acted as its pastor for ten years after
his arrival, was, owing to some charges of improprieties, superseded and succeeded by
Doctor Lillie, These were the only Church establishments in Van Diemen’s Land
during the administration of Governor Sorrell—the northern part of the island having
no fixed place of worship. Although education had hitherto suffered as much neglect
as religion, during Governor Sorrell’s government an impetus was given to the formation
and opening of many scholastic institutions. One redeeming point in Knopwood’s
character was that he was desirous of promoting the education of the young, and with
this object united with the Wesleyans. In September, 1819, the returns received by Mr.
Knopwood of the number of children receiving instruction in Hobart Town and the most
populous districts amounted for that month to 164—the figures representing the children
who attended both public and private schools. Mr. Commissioner Bigge, who was sent
from England to report on a variety of matters affecting penal discipline in the colonies,
objected to the system obtaining. There was an absence of supervision in the public
schools, and there was no definite system laid down for the guidance of the teachers until
1823, when Mr. Peter Archer Mulgrave was appointed Superintendent of Schools.
The Post Office Department was what might be termed a rather impromptu affair
in those days. There was a Postmaster at Hobart Town, but the weekly messenger
carried letters only so far as Pittwater. In October, 1816, a great improvement
was made in this most important department of the Public Service by the appointment
of Mr. Robert A. Taylor as Government Messenger between Hobart Town and
Dalrymple, the name by which Launceston was then known. The messenger was to
leave each place on alternate Sunday mornings. The places were 120 miles apart,
without the least track to enable the rider to steer his course; and considering that
Taylor managed to run the gauntlet safely and escape unhurt by the natives, the
undertaking may be considered as a very plucky one, and ably carried out, Launceston


was a small unfrequented place at that time, and nothing can be told of its rise and
progress, save that of oral testimony, which, as every historian full well knows, is most
unsound evidence. A few rude structures at the east end of Cameron Street marked
the spot where building was first carried on. The Rev. John You), formerly a
missionary at Tahiti, was appointed chaplain at Georgetown. Until his arrival no
clergyman had ever visited the northern districts of the island. In 1819 he made a
tour and baptised sixty-seven children, and married forty-one couples, most of whom,
through force of circumstances, had already contracted bonds of union in a manner
not consistent with ecclesiastical law. Every person in the early history of the colonies
was obliged to resort to the most primitive methods of civilisation, and the clergyman
as well as the layman was compelled to use the best means available. For instance,
when Mr. Youl visited Launceston, he was accustomed to call his congregation
together by the sound of an iron barrel, which was swung to a post and struck by a
mallet, and it was said that he announced his arrival by walking through the settle-
ment in his canonical dress. He used to preach when at Launceston in a small
wooden building where the Bank of Tasmania now stands. During the week it was
devoted to the administration of the decrees of the civil law, whilst on Sunday the
decrees of the divine law were announced. In front of it were the public stocks used
freely for the punishment of inebriates. Women were frequently sentenced to twelve
hours in the stocks, where they, like male offenders, were exposed to the gaze of
passers by. Launceston was destitute of a clerical resident until 1824, when Mr. Youl
returned from Georgetown. The people were sometimes deprived for weeks of a
service, and for three years they had no clergyman. Mr. Youl must have been a man
of extraordinary moral and spiritual feeling, for he is described as a man of the most
amiable disposition ; and although placed in a station under which scarcely one man
in a hundred could undergo the trials to which he was subjected, he succeeded in
cultivating the minds and affections of the young, and discountenancing every descrip-
tion of vice. The Wesleyans visited Launceston in 1822, and the Rev, Mr. Horton,
when writing to Sydney for help, described the spiritual darkness of the people as most
deplorable, and added that assistance to alter the state of affairs then existing was most
urgently required. The administration of justice in Van Diemen’s Land was very
imperfect before the establishment of Law Courts. Enormities of the most diabolical
nature were inflicted on free and bond for offences of the greatest or most trivial
nature. It is said that even witnesses who did not give what the magistrate considered
ample evidence were sent to the triangles, and that as late as 1823 one was ordered to
be taken out of court and have one hundred lashes, so as to elicit more satisfactory
information from him A single magistrate had the power to inflict fifty lashes, while
two could sentence to any number of stripes. Until 1822 there was not a lawyer in Van
Diemen’s Land ; a schoolmaster and Mr. R. L. Murray were permitted to plead in court.
Mr. J. P. Fawkner was one of the earliest pleaders in the Launceston Court. On 19th
July, 1828, the British Legislature enacted a law to secure a better administration


of justice in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, “ and for the better
government thereof,” to expire at the close of the session of Parliament, 1827. The
old courts, with their military functions, were superseded, and a Supreme Court erected
under Act IV., Geo. IV., c. 96, in New South Wales as well as in Van Diemen’s Land ;
and in 1824 Mr. J. L. Peddei arrived, as Chief Justice, from England, taking with him
the charter of the Supreme Court. Mr. Joseph Tice Gellibrand was Attorney-General,
and Mr. Joseph Hone (brother of the author of the Day Book) was “master” of the
Supreme Court. By the Act it was provided also that the King might erect Van
Diemen’s Land into a separate colony, conferring on the Acting-Governor, in the absence
of the Governor-in-Chief, the various powers conveyed by the Act, and in that case
terminate the dependence of the Supreme Court on the Court of New South Wales.
The Act of Parliament did not pass without a heated debate and discontent. Sir James
Mackintosh moved that a jury of twelve should be substituted for the clause con-
stituting a military jury—the most obnoxious portion of the bill. In this he was
seconded by Mr. Wilberforce, but the proposition was defeated by a majority of eleven.
Mr. Canning recommended a compromise between the friends and opponents of the
bill by limiting its duration to five years, and to this the Minister assented. The
settlers were generally desirous that Van Diemen’s Land should be erected into a
separate colony; but to this Governor Sorrell was opposed, as he thought the measure
premature—tending to augment the expenses of government, and as being productive
of other consequent evils. A public meeting was summoned, and a petition adopted
by acclamation; the sole dissentient present, Mr. Murray, receiving some rough treat-
ment at the hands of the petitioners. Governor Sorrell’s administration came to a close
in the early part of 1824.
In the early journals the name of Sorrell occurs frequently. Previous to his
departure a banquet was given to him, at which complimentary allusions were made
as to his successful administration of the colony’s affairs. A happy coincidence
marked his departure, as the return freight of merino wool, which the colony owed to
his care and foresight, was shipped in the “ Guildford,” which carried him home. He
is said to have been a good ruler, and his popularity, owing to his open-heartedness
and affability, was extensive. He was respected by all classes of society, whether free
or bond, and never was a Governor more popular or a people more contented
than Lieutenant-Governor Sorrell and the people of Tasmania while under his
government, and when he departed no man was more regretted.”* In addition to
these social virtues, he was endowed ■with an active mind and shrewd penetration, his
great object being to please all with whom he came in contact. Shortly after the
arrival of his successor, Governor Sorrell sailed for England in the “ Guildford,” the
same vessel which had brought him to the colony. A pension of ,£560 a year was
granted him until his death, which took place on 4th June, 1848, aged seventy-four years.
He was colonel of the 48th Begiment, and many of his descendants reside in the colony.

CHAPTER IV.
GOVERNOR ARTHUR’S ADMINISTRATION.
1524-183 S.
SEORGE ARTHUR, Esq., fourth Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen’s Land,
arrived in the “ Adrian on 12th May, 1821, Formerly Superintendent of
Honduras, he was well known as an officer of inflexible and energetic
disposition. His administration, which had occasioned considerable difference of opinion,
became the subject of parliamentary and judicial inquiries. Honduras, an establish-
ment on the American coast, was occupied by adventurers from Jamaica. At first
their presence for a time remained unnoticed by the Spanish Crown; but after a
hundred years had been spent in protests and opposition, the Court of Spain
reluctantly recognised the location of the cutters of logwood within its own territory.
Arthur entered the army in 1801, and served in Sir James Craig's expedition to Italy
in 1806, and being afterwards appointed adjutant of the Light Battalion on service in
E gypL was engaged in the attack on Rosetta. In 1809 he accompanied the Light
Company of his regiment with the Walcheren expedition, and was employed in the
attack on Flushing. Subsequently in 1814 he was appointed Superintendent of
Honduras by the Duke of Manchester. At the same time he received from General
Fuller the government in the following words :—“I do hereby constitute and appoint
you, the said George Arthur, to command such of His Majesty’s subjects as are now
armed, or may hereafter arm, for the defence of the settlers at the Bay of Honduras;
you are therefore, as Commandant, to take upon you the care and charge accordingly.”
In virtue of these appointments, he claimed both the military and civil command until
he quitted the settlement in 1822. In 1820, Bradley, an officer stationed at Honduras,
was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Governor on full pay, and knowing that the
regiment of which Arthur was colonel (the York Chasseurs) was disbanded, he
considered himself entitled to the military command by seniority of rank, according
to the rules of military service, having refused to acknowledge any longer Arthur’s
authority, or to attend a council of officers to which he was summoned. Thereupon
he was placed under arrest, and his sword taken from him by Arthur’s command, and
he was detained in prison for seventy-three days. General Fuller, having received an
account of this transaction, ordered Bradley’s liberation, but forwarded from Jamaica


to the authorities in Great Britain a statement of the dispute. Ihe conduct of
Colonel Bradley having been deemed inconsistent with military discipline, he was
dismissed from the service without trial, but allowed to dispose of his commission. An
action was brought by Colonel Bradley against Arthur for false imprisonment. His
counsel was Lord Brougham, and Arthur was defended by the law officers of the
Crown. The jury, considering that Bradley’s detention was unnecessarily prolonged,
gave him damages to the extent of <£loo. Subsequently Bradley was found guilty of
libelling General Fuller, whom he accused in a statement which he published. It was
to the effect that General Fuller had ante-dated Arthur’s commission in order to
justify the measures he had taken. He was not brought up for judgment. It was
decided by the judges that Bradley was mistaken, and that Arthurs title to command
was regular and valid. This was not the only charge preferred against Arthur. In
Honduras slavery existed, and Colonel Arthur gained the favour of an important
class of politicians by the compassion he expressed for the negro race, and
his exposure of the connivance of magistrates at the cruelty of masters. Wilberforce
and Stephen, the great advocates of slave liberation, who possessed influence
with the Executive, considered Arthur a valuable coadjutor in this noble cause,
and were supposed to overlook the arbitrary spirit of his government for the sake of
his philanthropy. Arthur’s reception at Hobart Town was respectful but cold, and it
may be proper to notice the moral state of the colony on Arthurs assumption of office.
In his reply, which was cold, he took occasion to express his conviction that the moral
example of the free population was essential to the improvement of a class less
favoured, and while employing his authority for the general welfare, he was resolved to
maintain the rights of the Crown.* Such sentiments were just, but were not acceptable
to the free settlers, whose lax morality was clearly perceptible to the new Governor.
Although possessing the ability to rule, he lacked the art of doing so in a conciliatory
spirit. He could not discriminate between the convict class and those free settlers
induced to emigrate by the overtures of the Home Government. Governor Arthur was
convinced that the only way to rule Van Diemen’s Land was to regard it in the light
of a convict settlement. He deprecated the mixture of the free with the bond as a
most dangerous barrier against a stringent system of prison discipline. He accordingly
set to work to carry out his policy without any regard to the circumstances of the
colony. Many of the settlers were either unable or unwilling to contract lawful
marriages with the prisoners or their offspring. Their example affected those in
stations beneath them. All these were placed under a ban ; the favours of govern-
ment were denied them. Subordinate officers were dismissed the service, and whatever
good this policy may eventually have effected, it called forth at the time a great deal of
ill-feeling towards and contempt for the Governor. When Governor Arthur received
his commission, he was authorised to govern under the rules of convict law. Those
“ • West.


free settlers whom the Home authorities induced to emigrate, forgot that they were
living in quite a different sphere of society to that which they had recently left, and
wanted institutions like those of the old country, where they had a voice in the affairs
of government; a system which could not possibly have been carried out at that period.
The first session of the Supreme Court was opened on 24th May, 1824. The
jury consisted of seven military officers. The first person tried was named Tibbs, for
killing a negro, who, while on the watch for thieves, was taken for a robber. The
negro, though not a constable, found pleasure in detecting crime, and in some
instances succeeded. It was whilst engaged in indulging this singular passion, by
hunting the premises of a settler, that he was killed by Tibbs.
The first prosecution for libel was at the instance of Mr. R. L. Murray, who was
formerly a captain in the army, and had been transported for bigamy. He served
twenty years, but his commission in the Royal Waggon Train having been declared
forfeited, he came out to New South Wales, where, after residing some time, he settled
in Van Diemen’s Land, where his extensive experience and literary talents gave him
an entree to the limited society then existing. Owing to his opposition to the petition
for an independent Colonial Government, on the grounds that it would not be instru-
mental in increasing the freedom or prosperity of the colony, the committee for the
promotion of a separate Government issued a placard referring to the history of the
dissentient, and thereby exposed themselves to a criminal prosecution.
The merchants complained that the duties levied at Hobart Town were higher
than those fixed by Brisbane, the Governor-in-Chief at Port Jackson, as injurious to
their trade, and the duties levied prior to landing were sometimes imposed upon wines
never actually delivered. A request was made by them that the charges might be
equalised with the other port, and that what had been charged them in excess
previously should be restored. Arthur refused to entertain the petition. Dissatisfied
with the reply, Mr. Dudley Fereday, the Sheriff, was requested to convene a public
meeting to address the Governor-in-Chief, which the Sheriff promptly declined on the
grounds that his Honour Colonel Arthur was not mentioned in fhe requisition, and
that there was no real locus standi for the meeting so far as the object the meeting
wished to have set forth. The Sheriff’s decision to decline with the request caused a
meeting to be held, at which his conduct was severely censured; but the meeting
ended, as all other meetings do where grievances imaginary are ventilated, with the
impression that the colony was under a system of despotic rule. Trial by jury was a
more important question, as it displayed the variations existing between the colonies,
as it was permitted at Port Jackson and not at Hobart Town. Mr. Alfred Stephen*
then a solicitor in Hobart Town, brought the matter before the Court, but Judge
Pedder ruled that civil juries were not legal unless with Royal sanction.
General Darling visited Hobart Town on his way from England to assume office
of the government of New South Wales, and the separation of the local government


from that of Sydney was formally commenced. His arrival was a time of great
festivity, more especially as he proclaimed the independence of the colony on New
South Wales, 3rd December, 1825. Up to that time the dependent settlement had
been ruled by those who had been addressed, or,were addressed, as his Honour. After
the visit Governor Arthur was addressed as his Excellency. Ihe colonists were
pleased with the change, for which they had sent a petition to the Home Government
in April of the previous year. Although opposed to disintegration, we may say that,
owing to the distance from head-quarters, and the delays necessarily incurred thereby,
a separation was actually compulsory. Events which followed cooled the ardour of
those patriots who were clamouring for separation. Local, Executive and Legislative
Councils were duly appointed by the Crown. The functions of the former were to
advise the Governor on important occasions, and of the latter to frame laws for the
government of the colony. The members of the Executive were —Captain John
Montague, Chief Secretary (nephew of the Governor;) John Lewes Pedder, Chief
Justice; A. W. H. Humphrey, Police Magistrate; and Jocelyn Thomas, Colonial
Treasurer. The Legislative Council consisted of seven members, viz., Edward Abbott,
W. H. Hamilton, Edward Curr, and four of the Executive Councillors. One of the
acts which Governor Arthur committed shortly after gaining his new position as an
independent ruler excited much interest in legal circles throughout Great Britain
the dismissal of Mr. Gellibrand, the Attorney-General, for what was considered unpro-
fessional conduct in drawing pleas for a plaintiff, and afterwards acting officially against
him in court. The question was brought before Judge Pedder, in view of having
Gellibrand struck off the rolls, but that gentleman declined to interfere, as it was
outside his jurisdiction. Arthur, with that pertinacity for which he was so remarkable,
firmly determined to press the charge, and appointed a commission of inquiry,
consisting of Messrs. Jocelyn, Thomas, Humphrey and Pedder. After an investigation
into the whole question, Mr. Gellibrand was dismissed, but the practice of the English
Bar proved that he had a precedent in so acting.* It was found that the first counsel
in England often acted against a retaining client, and sometimes drew pleas on both
sides* Notwithstanding, the Governor dismissed Mr. Gellibrand, as he considered
the practice and precedence of law courts in England were not applicable to such
a colony as Van Diemen’s Land. This action of Governor Arthur towards a gentleman
who was highly respected throughout the colony rendered him still more unpopular.
The division of the island into police districts, subject to a stipendiary magistrate
(1827,) proved to be one of the most useful measures carried out by Governor Arthur.
The new system brought the prisoner-population under the more immediate control of
the Government. It was a great improvement in the internal discipline of the colony.
Each district had a stipendiary justice and police clerk, an efficient police staff, a
salaried surgeon, a small detachment of soldiers, and a public flagellator. The necessity

of these establishments is illustrated clearly by many facts. In the first place, gentle-
men, themselves masters, were liable to be biassed in their decisions, and where
conflicting interests arose, a cool and impartial judgment was rarely given. The
revision of their sentences by the Executive reflected on their judgment; nor were
they at all times disposed to devote time to a patient and searching investigation, or to
distinguish between a trivial and sound defence. Facts, now almost incredible, are
related of the severity of the punishment inflicted on offenders at that period—the lash
being the grand panacea for all minor offences committed by the settlers’ servants.
Some of the settlers were men of a kindly disposition, but the atmosphere in which
they moved by degrees benumbed their feelings of good nature.
“It mends their morals; never mind the pain,” was the maxim. The tyrannical
conduct of masters often drove men to commit acts when in a desperate state of mind, and
for which they suffered the extreme penalty of the law. It was not enough for these men
to suffer extreme punishment as convicts, but they had also to undergo oppression at the
hands of their masters, who considered it necessary to render their lives still more
miserable. The English Criminal Law of that day was cruel in the extreme. Offenders
were executed for crimes now punishable by a few years’ imprisonment. It is now a
well-known fact that many who then were transported would, under the present laws,
undergo a few weeks’ imprisonment. The theft of the cheapest commodity rendered a
man liable to transportation, while many were thoroughly innocent of the charges upon
which they were convicted. Some curious examples of magisterial equity in Van
Diemen’s Land are told. It is said that one of these dignitaries on a certain occasion
when he heard his waggon in the street, delivered his sentence during his exit in
the following words: “ I can’t stop ; give him fifty.” A cattle-stealer owed his life to
the nervousness of the magistrate, who, before the case had been half investigated,
said : “ Give him fifty.” A clergyman met a number of men brought up for disobedience,
and sent them back with the following words : “ Ah, well, give them five-and-twenty
all round.” This man certainly had not the power, or perhaps the will, to separate the
goats from the sheep. Summary decisions by unfledged thinkers never had nor never
will have any effect on the morality of a people. The duty of the Home authorities,
when shipping cargoes of convicts to Australasia, was to despatch at the same time
men qualified to adjudicate on crimes affecting the welfare of the community, and not
to relegate such a power to those who were partial, indifferent or incapable. Another
malpractice of the time was to despatch the man whom it was intended to punish with
a note to the effect that he was to be flogged, which request was of course complied
with, and then the miserable suffering creature was sent back. This enormity was
increased by innocent persons often undergoing the punishment of the lash through
having brought such missives, which were handed him by his fellow-servant, who rightly
suspected what the contents were, and notwithstanding his protests of innocence, the
magistrate to whom he handed the note ordered the punishment to be inflicted. This


system, like every other diabolical scheme, defeated its own ends, for it is recorded that
another, who had been on a similar errand before, returned on the following day to his
master, complaining bitterly of his suffering, but his low cunning prompted him to
destroy the note, and thereby escape the punishment intended to be meted out to him.
It is, therefore, matter of little surprise that the annals of crime in Van
Diemen’s Land are so black ; but the cause may be traced to the severity of discipline
carried out by settlers and officials, and the system of congregating together a most
heterogeneous mass of all sorts, grades, and conditions of vice. There was only one
outlet from this contaminating influence, but in the majority of cases it was but a
forlorn hope. We allude to the home of the settler. Fenton, in his “ History of
Tasmania,” says that “ many personal reminiscences are too shocking to be recorded.”
There were, however, instances where mild treatment of the offenders produced most
salutary effects. Numbers of bad men were reclaimed, and hundreds saved from ruin.
A notorious culprit was reclaimed by gentle means applied at the instance of a
benevolent master. Many other cases in which gentility and kindness towards men
whose feelings had been outraged by unjust sentences were passed, and unduly severe
treatment had been exercised, could be enumerated as to the beneficent influence of
mercy towards the oppressed. The writer has heard many tales of the behaviour of
the convicts at Port Arthur from the last chaplain stationed there; and as a corrobora-
tion of the statement that kindness will quell violence, he relates the instance of a
most violent felon whom he went to visit in his cell, as having made a most desperate
rush at him. On being questioned by the chaplain, who had dexterously eluded his
onslaught, he said he wanted to murder someone; but he dare not think in his calmer
mood of striking a man like him, whose eyes showed tenderness of heart, and whose
voice displayed a sympathetic depth of feeling. The chaplain was the Rev. Rowland
Hayward, now stationed at Inglewood, Victoria. Private service was no doubt
intolerable, but penal settlements surpassed all the morbidly melancholic imaginations
of man. Macquarie Harbour was selected for its isolated position, it having been
established by Governor Sorrell, in 1821. Lieutenant Cuthbertson, of the 48th
Regiment, acted as the first commandant, and was drowned two years subsequently in
his attempt to save a Government vessel. “The name of Macquarie Harbour is
associated exclusively with the remembrance of inexpressible depravity, degradation,
and woe.”* Macquarie Harbour is an inlet of the sea on the western coast, about two
hundred miles by water from Hobart Town, and penetrates the country twenty miles
till it joins the Gordon River, and then diverging to the right, Sarah Island becomes
visible. It is now deserted and desolate, as it is a most inhospitable region. Animal
life is with difficulty preserved, vegetation only of the coarsest description exists, its
waters are discoloured by the decayed vegetable matter which mingles with the torrents
which pour down from the mountains, and the fish may be seen floating to the shores

poisoned by the water. West, in his description of this convict settlement, says:
“The passage to this dreary dwelling-place was tedious and often dangerous. The
prisoners, confined in a narrow space, were tossed for weeks in an agitated sea. As
they approached, they beheld a narrow opening choked with a bar of sand and crossed
with peril. This they called ‘ Hell’s Gates,’ not less appropriate to the place than the
character and torment of the inhabitants. Beyond they saw impenetrable forests,
skirted with an impervious thicket, and beyond still enormous mountains covered with
snow, which rose to the clouds like walls of adamant: every object wore the air of
rigour, ferocity, and sadness. The moment the prisoner landed, if the hours of labour
had not expired he joined his gang. The chief employment was felling the forest and
dragging timber to the shore. These gigantic trees, formed into rafts, were floated to
the depot In this service life was sometimes lost, and the miserable workmen
diseased and weakened by hunger while performing their tasks often passed hours in
the water. They were long denied vegetables and fresh food. They were exposed to
those maladies which result from poverty of the blood, and many remained victims long
after their release. On a breakfast of flour and water they started from their island
prison to the main land, and pursued their toil without food till the hour of return ;
they then received their chief meal and went to rest. Those who were separated to
punishment still more severe, lodged on a rock. The surf dashed with perpetual
violence on its base, and the men were compelled to pass through wet to the waist,
and even to the neck. They were destitute of bedding, sometimes in chains, their
fires were extinguished, and they laid down in their clothes in a cold and miserable
resting-place.”
It had been found that Macquarie Harbour was ill adapted for the purpose
intended. The bleak climate, the sterility of the soil, and the great delay and
danger in navigating vessels to the port, induced the Government a few years
afterwards to abandon it. The second penal settlement chosen was that of Maria
Island, and was selected as a place of secondary punishment for educated convicts and
others whose crimes were not of such a grade as to require transportation to Macquarie
Harbour. Its approximation to the Biver Derwent, together with its fertile soil and
salubrious climate, as well as its sufficient distance from the main shore—which latter
advantage cut off all chance of escape by the prisoners—held out hopes of it being a
well-chosen spot. This settlement was formed in March, 1825, with Peter Murdoch,
Esq., as the commandant. In addition to the proposal for the removal of the site of the
capital to Brighton—a proposal which, as has been already seen, caused much irritation
to the Hobart Town merchants —another project about this time, the removal of the
common wharf from the old jetty to the Bev. B. Knopwood’s point, produced great
dissatisfaction. Various merchants who had expended large sums in the erection of
buildings at the old jetty, considered that, should the step contemplated take place,
large individual losses would be sustained. The merchants, therefore, drew up a


petition to Governor Arthur, praying that no such alteration should be sanctioned.
To this the Governor replied by saying that no such change had been mooted, and
that the survey of Sullivan’s Cove, which had created the alarm, was solely connected
with an application made to erect certain machinery in or near the water s edge. ’
The first of the annual Sorrell dinners was held on 7th April of this year, when a large
number of the most respectable settlers attended, many of whom spoke in eulogistic
terms of Sorrell’s administration. Commerce this year was flourishing and gradually
extending, large quantities of fat sheep were exported to Sydney, and the profit secured
in this trade induced further shipments to be made for several years. Wheat was
also shipped in large quantities, and it may be safely said that, notwithstanding all the
blots and stains which bespattered the mantle of the little island, it was able to show,
owing to the enterprise of really chivalrous men, a record, during its twenty-two years
of existence, of substantial progress. As an instance of the expense of living in those
days, it may be mentioned that tea, which is regarded as a necessary and not a luxury
of life, cost from ,£3O to £4O per chest. The township of New Norfolk, at this period,
received very great encouragement from the new Government; the church was
enlarged, and several houses were erected. Richmond and other towns showed several
signs of improvement. A Government public notice, dated 29th June, 1825, contains
the direction that the custom hitherto prevailing in all transactions with the
Government —the dollar had been paid and reissued at 4s. sterling—should be
discontinued, and that the dollar should be received in liquidation of sums due and
payable to the Colonial Government, at the rate of 4s. 4d. During this winter the
rations that were given to all fresh settlers for six months after their arrival were
reduced to four months. This was the first check given to the emigrants, whereas
hitherto every encouragement was held out to those desirous of settling in Van
Diemen’s Land. The British Government seems, however, to have repented of holding
out inducements for emigration, which consisted in a promise of land for cultivation,
and food till such times as he was enabled to supply himself from his own resources.
It is to be regretted that a check was put upon that great stimulus to emigration
which had formerly proved so advantageous. The new settlers were men of
intelligence and character, which soon made itself felt in such a community as then
existed. Each settler received a grant of land proportionate to the amount of capital
he brought with him, the maximum area being 2560 acres. Exceptions to this rule
were freely admitted afterwards, and grants of land up to 1280 acres were bestowed by
the Governor, whose decree in such matters was absolute. Loans of stock and seed
were granted to the settlers, as well as six months’ rations for themselves and their
convict servants. A guarantee that they should receive 10s. per bushel for all the
wheat they grew, and 6d. per pound for all the meat they could raise, was given. These
concessions were withdrawn in 1818, but the system of granting land free of all charges,
with the exception of a trifling quit-rent, continued till 1830.


Governor Arthur was of opinion that every encouragement should be given to
agriculture, and a society founded under Colonel Sorrell received his patronage. At a
dinner given by the society, Governor Arthur and his friends attended. Every induce-
ment was held out by this society—the Agricultural Society of Van Diemen’s Land—
for the improvement of the soil and stock, and valuable importations of the very finest
description of woolled sheep were effected through the agency of many of its members.
Owing, accordingly, to the encouragement of this society, and the inducements of the
British Government, it followed that the finest parts of the island were alienated.
Those who obtained grants of land spread themselves over the grassy plains of the
interior and engaged in pastoral pursuits—many of the best districts of the colony
remaining to the present day in their primitive condition and used only as sheep-walks.
1 he early colonists, however, notwithstanding the boon granted them, were obliged to
take the bitter with the sweet, in the form of not only undergoing hardships and
privations, but also of living in constant dread of bushrangers and the infuriated
aborigines—some of the latter, however, showing their appreciation of a kind word and
tender treatment, but which, sad to relate, was often prevented by the treatment they
received at the hands of the servants of those masters who endeavoured to win their
affections. There were some settlers, notwithstanding all these temptations prompting
the blacks to take revenge, who were deeply beloved by them. In another portion of
this work a detailed account of the aborigines and their surroundings is given, as well
as a few notes on, and incidents connected with bushranging.


CHAPTER V.
GOVERNOR ARTHUR AND THE PRESS.
■HE site of the capital narrowly escaped a second change; the Commissioner, Mr.
Bigge, considering that the seat of Government should be nearer the source of
the Derwent, Brighton was named as the most suitable spot, it'being close to an
extensive and fertile country, and owing to the facility of communication therefrom with
the interior. Arthur, having been instructed to determine this question, some advocated
its removal on the ground that the prisoners would be beyond the reach of the
temptations of the port On the other hand, property was already invested to a large
amount, and the merchants strongly opposed the transfer. Moreover, it was contended
that the separation of the seat of Government from the chief population would have
seriously impaired its moral influence. Arthur acted with moderation whilst discussing
the project with the merchants and other principal inhabitants. In fact he did not
seem disposed to press the matter, which was finally abandoned; and which, owing to
the uncertainty as to what would be decided on, the progress of the place was for some
time obstructed. Launceston was still more unfortunate. On the abandonment of
York Town as the chief settlement, Paterson removed his head-quarters to Launceston;
but when Governor-General Macquarie visited the island, he determined to constitute
George Town the northern capital. The superior convenience of a spot at the head
of the river to one forty miles distant caused Launceston to obtain a mercantile
preference; moreover, an extensive fertile country adjoins it, whereas George Town
lacks an agricultural district, and jts pasture is poor. Macquarie maintained his project
to the last, but Mr. Bigges opinion had the effect of allowing Launceston to be the
capital, and the head-quarters were, in 1824, removed finally from George Town. The
principal objection to Launceston was the navigation of the river. Lighters, and even
rafts were employed to discharge ships, which can now approach the wharves.
Captain Watson, of the “ Aquilar,” charged his detention for several months at George
Town on the river, but Governor Arthur flatly denied the accusation. He said that the
master had despatched his mate and seamen on a sealing voyage, and that, therefore,
to excuse the delay he had no alternative but to condemn the port. During the rule
of Arthur’s predecessors, the Press existed only in name—the Hobart Town Gazette , of
which Mr. Emmett was the first official editor, being under the strict control of the
Governor, When Governor Arthur arrived, Bent resolved to act on independent lines,


and moderately, to criticise public matters. He claimed a property in the title of the
Gazette , and determined to free himself from a partnership supposed to hind him to
the Government. Money, lent for the purchase of the material, which he intended to
repay, was the link. His right to the property was disputed hy Arthur, but having
referred the case to Sydney, his claim was recognised. Arthur was at first willing to
countenance a newspaper which, if properly conducted, would be instrumental in
counteracting the social evils that existed, and for a short time he tolerated the liberty
of the Press. Bent engaged Evan Henry Thomas as editor, and Robert Lathrop
Murray was a contributor under the nom de 'plume of “ Colonist,” addressing his letters
to the Governor, whose conduct he showed to be in great contrast to that of his
immediate predecessor. In June, 1824, appeared the first article of the liberated Press.
The writer of the article said: “We esteem ourselves a beacon, placed by Divine
graciousness on the awful perilous coast of human frailty.” “We view ourselves as a
sentinel, bound by allegiance to our country, our Sovereign, and our God.” “We
contemplate ourselves as the winnowers for the public.” Further on he says : “We
desire to encourage the cloudless flames of rectified communion,” rejecting “ each
effusion, however splendid, of degenerate curiosity and perverted genius—of misan-
thropic acerbity and calumnious retrospection/' Such were the vows and resolutions
of Mr. Bent. He added: “ The duties of our typographic province are performed by
the proprietor and one assistant. ’’
The Governor soon afterwards established another newspaper, under the title of
Gazette , which was started to suppress opposition. Colonel Arthur’s troubles with the
settlers began in real earnest when he attempted to interfere with the liberty of the
Press, since many talented and liberal-minded colonists who favoured Bent’s attitude
became politically the antagonists of the Governor. Moreover, the contest with the
Press upon which Colonel Arthur entered was not checked by the fear of lack of
friends, such as Forbes, Chief Justice of New South Wales, who withheld his certificate
because a newspaper stamp duty of fourpence was proposed in that colony. Colonel
Arthur received similar instructions to those issued to Governor Darling, regarding the
control of unlicensed printing, but, unlike Darling, suffered no open or covert opposition
from the Chief Justice, J. L. Pedder. Bent continued to grow still more daring, and
the first ex officio prosecution was instituted against him. The Lieutenant-Governor
was charged with attempting to deprive Bent of his property, the fraud, as already
referred to, being defeated only by an appeal to Governor Brisbane.
In another paragraph the writer alluded in strong terms to the incarceration of
Colonel Bradley, which, he said, was a sufficient warning to the colonists of what they
might expect from a man like Arthur. In one place he declared he would not surrender
his rights to any tyrant. The Government printing, previous to this, was taken from
Bent. George Terry Howe, who, on sth January, 1825, had commenced a newspaper
at Launceston, was induced to relinquish his position and become printer of the Gazette


at Hobart Town. It contained articles of news and politics, as well as Government
notices, until the Courier, under the management of James Ross, LL.D., appeared in
1827. The Gazette was then issued as a sheet for official information only, and Dr.
Ross was appointed Government Printer. During all this time the public Press of the
colony was vastly improved, and the writers displayed a fearlessness that seemed to
arouse apprehension on the part of some of those in authority. At the time to which
we are alluding, the letters signed “ Colonist ” made their appearance. The depriving
Mr. Bent of the Government printing and support was not all that occurred to him
during this period, for he was twice tried in the month of July, 1825, for libel upon
Colonel Arthur. He was found guilty by the military jury, and for the first offence
he suffered three months’ imprisonment, and received a similar sentence for the second.
Mr. Bent, finding it impossible to oppose those who were supported by,the Government,
in the piracy of his title to the Gazette, was compelled to change the name of his
journal, and the Hohart Town Gazette, of ten years’ standing, was continued under the
title of the Colonial Times. Bent, however, in his appeal to the Governor-in-Chief
against the piracy of the title of his paper, had the appeal decided in his favour. He
did not press his claim, for on 19th August, 1825, he applied for a license for the new
paper, but was refused permission. He then sold the paper to Mr. James Austin, who
was also refused a license because Bent was the printer. The good-will reverted to
Bent, owing to the impossibility of carrying out the arrangement. In consequence of
this restriction the Colonial Times was published without information of any description,
save what could be gathered from the advertisements. On 1 9th October it appeared
in deep mourning, the columns for leading articles and general news being left blank.
An advertisement announced that the journal had neither a stamp nor a license for
news. With a view to crush out the liberty of the Press, Colonel Arthur, in September,
1827, had an Act of Council passed, which made the continuance of a paper to be subject
to the will of the Governor. The Act also authorised securities for penalties. Mr. Bent
now handed over his press to Mr. J. T. Gellibrand, the late Attorney-General. Owing
to Bent being a printer on the staff, the Governor refused to license the paper,
whereupon Bent started an advertising sheet and a monthly periodical the latter being
under the editorial management of an able writer, who was at the time undergoing
punishment. This course of procedure called forth a further exercise of tyranny, for
an order was issued which threatened with punishment any convict daring to write for
a newspaper, and Bent was imprisoned for a month for publishing an advertising sheet.
He therefore published monthly from Ist March, 1828, the Colonial Advocate, containing
much valuable information. Its price—five shillings a number—was excessive, and it
was not adapted for colonial readers. The A astral-Asiatic Review , edited by Mr.
Murray, appeared in February, 1828. The Acts passed in 1827 did not remain long
on the Statute Book, since a tax of threepence upon all newspapers in such a small
community prohibited any profit, and accordingly the stamp duty was not maintained.


In the early part of 1829, two newspapers were published at Launceston, one
named the Cornwall Press, and owned by Mr. S. Dousett, but its life was of a brief
duration. The other was the Launceston Advertiser, subsequently under the manage-
ment of Henry Dowling. The latter is now incorporated with the Launceston Examiner.
It was established by Mr. John Pascoe Fawkner, who was rather a remarkable man
in the annals of colonial life. He was but ten years of age when he left England
with his father in Collins’ expedition of 1803. Having removed, as he was obliged to,
accompanied by his father to the Derwent with Collins’ party, he would naturally know
something, although it be but little, of the founding of Hobart Town in 1804. After
his hours of manual labour he accustomed himself to the study of such books as he
could obtain. He laboured as a ranger in the vicinity of Hobart Town, and being very
steady, he soon acquired a little property. Removing to Launceston, he embarked in
several undertakings, and as there were at that period no lawyers in Launceston, he
was permitted, in addition to his other vocations, to prepare legal documents and
plead for clients in the Court. In 1828 he became landlord and proprietor of the
Cornwall Hotel in Cameron Street. His next venture was, at the end of that year, to
enter into an arrangement with Mr. William Monds, a man of some experience in the
mechanical department of presswork, to assist him obtaining type and other appliances
for a newspaper. Fawkner and Monds then went to Hobart Town for the purpose of
interviewing Mr. Andrew Bent, with whom they desired to make preliminary arrange-
ments. On reaching Ross they learned that Mr. Dousett and his son had gone to
Launceston for the purpose of issuing a weekly newspaper. This information caused
a temporary disappointment, who, however, in company with Monds, pushed on to
Hobart Town. They made arrangements with Bent for a supply of second-hand type,
some paper, printing ink and a wooden press. Having secured a bullock dray and a
driver about to start for Launceston, they shipped their plant by this vehicle, which,
however, just as they reached where New Town now stands, capsized. It can be easily
imagined what a confused mass would be created by this accident. The type was
collected and thrown in a box, the press, fortunately, sustaining no damage. After
the type had been distributed into their proper cases on reaching the Cornwall Hotel,
they were enabled to issue the numbers of the first paper permanently established at
Launceston. Removing from Launceston, Fawkner, as is well known, arrived in
Victoria, where, by his energy and activity, he was instrumental in giving an impetus
to the founding of what is now justly regarded as the most important city in the
Southern Hemisphere.
An Act to regulate the printing and publishing of newspapers was re-enacted in
1828. It prescribed affidavits of the names of printers and publishers under extreme
penalties, together with other very stringent conditions. It will, therefore, be seen that
the Press was still held fast by the stern clutches of law, under the strong will of
Governor Arthur, who, notwithstanding the vigorous battle waged by printers and


editors, pursued what he considered to be his duty. In response to an address signed
by Meredith and several other magistrates, merchants and leading citizens, protesting
against the restrictions imposed as needless, unconstitutional and debasing, as well
as being contrary to the implied arrangements of the Crown when immigration was
invited, the Governor said that the peculiar circumstances of the island forbade the
freedom of the Press, In order that history may not lag behind facts it is necessary
here to allude to some other events of the period, although not actually coming under
the title of this chapter.
At this time the Van Diemen’s Land Company commenced operations. Captain
Dixon, commander of the “ Skelton,” came to Van Diemen’s Land in 1820, and on his
return to England he published a small volume bearing on the capabilities of the
country. He suggested the formation of a pastoral company, with a capital divided into
.£IOO shares, which he regarded would be a profitable scheme. Reports had reached
England of the large returns realised by owners of sheep. The promoters of the
company, therefore, resolved to venture upon a speculation which seemed likely to
prove profitable. Flocks of an improved quality were proposed to be introduced upon
a large scale. On making inquiry they found that all the pasture lands of the colony
had been alienated, with the exception of scattered areas of limited extent, and that it
was impossible to secure a solid block such as they required. They, however, having
determined to carry out their project, applied to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of the
Colonies, for a grant of half a million acres of land on certain conditions. An Act of
Parliament was obtained under which the charter passed (9th November, 1825.) This
charter empowered them to employ their capital in pastoral and agricultural operations,
to lend money on mortgage, and undertake public works on the security of tolls.
Banking and commercial pursuits were forbidden the company, which received a grant
of 250,000 acres in one square block at the north-west corner of the island. The land
was ill adapted for the scheme, as it was heavily timbered, the higher ranges to the
westward being barren and the open plains wet and cold. On this being represented
to the Home authorities, the company was permitted to select their land in several
detached blocks. A survey party was sent out, under the command of Mr. Henry
Hellyer, to select the best lands in the north-west. He started on his exploring
expedition in February, 1827, and on the 13th of the month crossed the Emu River,
which he named from the number of emus he saw thereabouts. On the following day
he named St. Valentine’s Peak, which he ascended, and saw from its summit a fine
pastoral country, naming it Surrey and Hampshire Hills. Two days following he and
his party crossed the river which now bears his name, and on the 19th he came across
a river running in a south-westerly direction, which he named the Arthur, in honour of
the then Governor. Some native huts were found at the Surrey Hills by the exploring
party, and some trees from which the bark had been taken to cover them. Mr. John
Hilder Wedge was the next explorer of the district. He was sent to make an official


report to the Government prior to the survey of the company’s grant Owing to his
report, the company was permitted to select 350,000 instead of 250,000 acres,
Ultimately, the Van Diemen’s Land Company was allowed to divide their grant into
six separate blocks containing altogether more than 400,000 acres, for which the only
charge made was a quit-rent of ,£468 16s. a year, redeemable at twenty years’ purchase.
The company, however, laboured under great difficulties far many years. They
despatched several ships from England to Circular Head direct, the first ship being
the “ Tramnere,” followed by the “ Caroline,” laden with free emigrants and stock,
and were allowed a remission out of their quit-rent for introducing free servants, at the
rate of £l6 for males and £2O for females. The speculation, however, owing to losses
sustained proved ruinous to the shareholders. About the same time an Agricultural
Association was established in England, with a similar object to that of the Van
Diemen’s Land Company. The company received a grant of 40,000 acres of land in
the Norfolk Plains district. They imported improved breeds of horses, sheep, and
horned cattle. Captain Bartholomew Thomas, the managing partner, who arrived in
1826, was speared by the blacks in 1831. In 1826 the progress of the colony, both in
the north and south, was rapid. There were upwards of 18,000 inhabitants; the
Commissariat expenditure exceeded £IOO,OOO in the year; there were a few taxes
principally levied on spirituous liquors. In 1828, 49,424 acres of land had been
alienated from the Crown, while the revenue derived from sales and rentals reached
only £2418, nearly all the land having been given to the settlers as free grants. Up to
this period more than 34,000 acres had been under cultivation. There were 2034 horses in
the colony, 84,476 horned cattle, and 553,698 sheep. The imports amounted to
£241,382, and the exports totalled £91,461, of which one-fourth was represented by wool.
There were twenty-four flour mills at work. There were eight Government schools,
with 410 scholars on the roll. By a new Constitutional Act, which came into force in
1828, the Council was increased from five or seven to ten or fifteen, with the Governor
as President, who had a deliberative and the usual casting vote. The former oath
of secrecy was abolished, and the Gazette published the drafts of proposed Acts. The
members of the Council were appointed by the Grown, and vacancies were filled by the
Governor’s nominees. A majority of the Council was needed to pass an Act. An
important change was effected by the Council being empowered to institute trial by
civil jury, instead of the baneful military jury of seven. Prior to 1828, no system of
finance was observed by the Government—the Home authorities supplying whatever
was required for the maintenance of the civil, military and convict establishments. At
this time, however, these departments were classified under three separate heads—the
civil, military, and convict, England paying the expenses of the latter two through the
Commissariat, whilst those of the civil branch were undertaken by the colony. Up to
this period the Governor levied taxes at his will, but the new Act provided that for
local purposes alone could any tax be imposed, and these the Act defined. Owing to


new measures of finance having been introduced, as regards defraying the expenses of
the civil department, it was found that a substantial surplus existed at the close of the
year. The chief source of revenue arose from a duty imposed on imported spirits and
tobacco, and an ad valorem percentage on imported articles grown or manufactured
outside England. The numerous fees, land rents and licenses, together with the other
imports, caused a revenue of between fifty and sixty thousand pounds to be
realised. The duty on imported brandy was 10s. per gallon; that on rum and gin,
7s. od.; and on imported tobacco, Is. 6d. per lb., these articles totalling up a revenue
of about <£30,000. There were five distilleries in the colony, each of which paid
<£2s per annum, the same amount being chargeable to public-houses. Although the
new form of government was a concession, yet the colonists regarded that, without
representative government, their freedom was very much trammelled. The trial of
Salmon and Brown for a murder at Macquarie Harbour (1829,) called forth in regard to
the military jury system very uncomplimentary remarks. They could not agree as to
their verdict, Lieutenant Matheson, owing to the facts disclosed, not feeling justified in
giving a conviction. However, owing to the unanimity of all the other jurors he, after
a resistance of three days, submitted. On Saturday evening the men received their
sentence, and on the following Monday were executed. During their long deliberations
the jurymen were allowed refreshments. Heartily tired out by the tediousness in
discussing the issue before them, several made up their minds to elope, and accordingly,
at a late hour, they fled and returned to their homes. They were, however, brought
back, and kept under stricter watch until the conclusion of the trial. Amusements of
the turf were discouraged in Van Diemen’s Land. From an early date there was, at
rare intervals, a match for large stakes; but in 1827, races were regularly established
at Ross, the stand on the first occasion receiving the patronage of about fifty persons.
On the conclusion of the races, a public dinner followed, but the waiter, having been
blindfolded, the pudding was stolen from him as he entered the tent. It seems to have
been altogether a very hilarious affair, as hats and coats disappeared, and one person, it
is said, lost his boots


CHAPTEE YI.
STATE OF THE COLONY.
1824-1836.
■REVIOUS to giving a brief account of the colony up to the date of Governor
Arthur’s recall, a few more facts relative to the period may be narrated.
In 1826 attempts had been made to form a collegiate institution in the county
of Cornwall for the education of youth and the advancement of science. It
was proposed to erect buildings, and that the college should be under the
government of a directory of patrons, and also to establish a public library and
lecture room. With a view to carry out the undertaking, a subscription list
was opened and a sum of £SO each was contributed by twenty-four persons on
the spot. A commencement was made at Norfolk Plains, but the project failing,
the proposed institution sank into a private academy. In 1828 the Government
proposed to establish a school at New Norfolk, to be called the “King’s Grammar
School.” The members of the Government were the board of guardians, and the master
was in holy orders, but this effort met with a similar fate. The establishment, how-
ever, of the King’s Orphan School in 1828 proved successful. Its chief object was to
look after the numerous children whose parents were unable to support them, who had
forsaken them, or who were dead. A committee managed its affairs, and protection
was afforded to many children who must otherwise have suffered. Tasmania has
always borne the reputation of being merciful to the fatherless, and not a few of the
settlers have their names treasured in the bosoms of those who were either strangers or
outcasts. One beneficial effect resulting from the various public institutions springing
into existence at this time was a decrease in the spirit of party. In 1826 a mechanics’
institute was projected by several tradesmen, and in 1827 they called a meeting of the
inhabitants. Mr. Gellibrand was chosen chairman, and the institution was organised.
The Governor was invited to act as patron, the Chief Justice was chosen president, and
to Mr. James Wood was given the secretaryship. Dr. James Ross delivered the first
lecture on 17th July of the same year, on the science of mechanics. The second
lecture was delivered by Mr. Gellibrand, senior, while the delivery of a lecture by
Mr. Hackett on steam engines, Mr. Giblin, senior, on astronomy, and Dr, Turnbull on
chemistry, completed the course. Mr. James Thomson gave lessons on geometry to


a number of the young. After a slight lull in the success of the institution the
promoters were enabled, by the aid of contributions, to obtain a library from England.
In 1830 there were 200 members on the roll, and all classes of society endeavoured to
further the objects of the institution.
Notwithstanding the unsettled state of affairs, chiefly caused by the depredations
of bushrangers, by the hostile attitude of the aborigines, which had previously existed,
and by circumstances of a political nature, the colony continued to progress. Emigration
from the “ Old Country ” increased the population, the Home Government giving
assistance to mechanics willing to emigrate to Van Diemen’s Land, while military
pensioners, in consideration of their coming to the colony, were given small grants of
land, and four years’ payment in commutation of their pension. This turned out an
unfortunate arrangement for the pensioners, many of whom spent their money in drink,
neglected their allotments, and died in poverty. With respect to the disposal of Crown
lands, many plans were adopted, but almost immediately abandoned as soon as they
had come into operation. At one time emancipists as well as the free settlers who
arrived in the colony received a grant of land. The proviso that for 100 acres of land
granted to the settler he was to cultivate 5 was subsequently omitted for the regulation
that a convict servant must be kept for every 100 acres, and the quit-rent of 2s. was
increased to 15s. per 100 acres. In 1828, every person with <£soo emigrating to the
colony was entitled to a grant of 640 acres of land. Previous to this a regulation
existed permitting officers of the army, not under the rank of captain, to sell their
commission in order to emigrate, and on arrival in Van Diemen’s Land they could
claim a grant. Many were attracted to the colony by this offer, and upwards of 500
grants of over 500 acres each were issued until the end of 1831.
Payment of quit-rent, a condition of most grants, was generally evaded, and
ultimately a liberal compromise was instituted in its stead. The first land sales took place
in 1828. Land was divided into parishes and offered for sale at a low figure, no person
being allowed to purchase more than 9600 acres. In two years about 70,000 acres of
land were sold for £20,000, principally to the large landholders who were excluded from
otherwise adding to their grants. The system of free grants ceased on 20th January,
1831, and from that date the land laws emerged from the obscurity which had
enshrouded them. Land had been granted in a very loose way, the Secretary of State
and Governor granting it at will, and great confusion was frequently occasioned. In
many instances, when surveys were made, settlers were found occupying land belonging
to a prior grantee. Mr. Alfred Stephen declared the invalidity of all existing grants on
the grounds that they were defective in form, the Governors Macquarie, Brisbane, and
Darling having issued the grants in their own names instead of in the name of the
King. This led to the appointment, in 1835, of a caveat board, under a statute
empowering its members to adjudicate in the case of disputed titles. Each case being
duly investigated, new grants were issued in proper form, and the security of titles


guaranteed. The years immediately preceding 1830 are fraught with a decisive change
in the history of Australia, There were hut two colonies in the Southern Hemisphere
whose affairs were administered by the British Government —New South Wales and Van
Diemen’s Land. Free emigrants began to be attracted to their shores. The agricultural
labourers in England were in a distressed condition, which caused a great source of
anxiety to the British nation, since the evils of pauperism tend to weaken the dignity
of labour and self-reliance. Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield’s theory of colonisation
sought to remedy the trials of impoverished persons in the Old Country, as well as to
point out the errors in British colonisation, and the suggestions of a new and more
effective plan. His theory had not been propounded in the time of Pitt, and when it
was known half a century later it was scarcely understood. Like all theories, it has
undergone the easy censure of critics, and has been by many persons accepted as a
model. It is by many considered as if its object was to accomplish what Wakefield
maintained was not an essential or even necessary part of the scheme. Its main
intention “ was to sell lend,” some say, “ at a high price,” in order to create an emigra-
tion fund for the purpose of importing labourers and reducing the cost of labour.
Wakefield, however, declared such was not the purport of his theory; but that it was
intended by his plan that land should be sold at “ a sufficient price; ” that labour
and capital should be combined; and that all the elements of colonisation should be
collected to prevent the dispersion of population, the premature occupation of land by
workmen, and the speculations of jobbers. Various projects of colonisation were formed
by private associations. One of the earliest of these resulted in the settlement of Swan
River, in Western Australia, in the year 1829. Grants of land were given under the
condition that capital should be invested. It was owing to the favourable report of
Captain Stirling, explorer of the coast in H.M.S. “ Success,” that the settlement was
formed of which he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.
Soon after the settlement of Western Australia, an act was passed (August, 1834)
empowering the Crown to erect South Australia into a British province. Great
pecuniary gain was derived by New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, owing to the
ready market they found at Adelaide for their stock. Tasmania supplied the South
Australians with split and sawn timber for their houses, sheep for their pastures, and
grain. Soon after, owing to a want of regard for circumstances, the mercantile houses
in the new settlement became insolvent, and hundreds were driven to Van Diemen’s
Land by poverty. Subsequently the colony of South Australia rallied, and although at the
present time (1888) not in the most prosperous condition, yet it no doubt has a promising
future. While speaking of the colonies then in existence, it would be unfair to pass
over the settlement of Port Phillip, which owed its origin to the energy and enterprise
of a few private individuals unaided by Act of Parliament, and devoid of a Royal Charter;
and it is to Launceston belongs the honour of the founding of Victoria.* A brisk trade
“ Jubilee History of Victoria and Melbourne.” Vol. 1., pp. 25-32.


between Launceston and Port Phillip was soon established. In April, 1836, no less
than four vessels sailed from Launceston for Port Phillip in one week with sheep and
emigrants. The prediction in Bent's News of 7th May, 1836, “ that this, meaning
Port Phillip, u will not only be a settlement, but one of the largest in Australia, has
been amply verified. One of the results attending the exodus from Van Diemen s
Land to Port Phillip was that provisions and clothing became exceedingly costly; but
this increase was compensated for by a corresponding increase in all branches of
industry. Sheep formerly sold at ss. were worth £2. Four months after Fawkner left
for the new settlement flour was worth £2B per ton; hay, <£7 per ton ; wheat, 10s. per
bushel; oats, 45.; barley, 75.; fresh butter, 2s. per pound; and horses and horned
cattle brought high prices. During the twelve years that Arthur administered the
affairs of the colony, rapid progress had been made. In 1824 the population, including
convicts, was under 13,000; in 1835 it had increased to over 40,000, a great
decrease in the number of convicts having occurred during those eleven years.
The general revenue, almost wholly derivable from duties on spirits and tobacco,
bad risen from £17,000 to over £90,000, and the annual Government expenditure from
£30,000 to over £IOO,OOO. The area of land occupied had increased largely, a million
and a half acres having been granted, and a quarter of a million acres sold, the latter
realising £107,000. In 1824 there were 35,000 acres of land under cultivation, while
at this period there were 90,000 acres. The trade of the colony had also developed
even more rapidly. The imports increased from £62,000 in 1824, to £584,000 in
1835 ; and the exports had risen from £14,500 to £320,000 during the same time. A
most important source of wealth to the colony was wool, of which in 1835 nearly
2,000,0001b5. had been exported, whereas in 1827 only 200,0001b5. had been shipped.
The price of this article was, in 1824, from 3d. to 6d. per pound, but in 1835 it realised
as much as 2s. 6d. per pound. In 1824 there was but one banking concern with
£IO,OOO of a capital; but in 1835 there were six of these institutions, having a united
paid-up capital of £200,000.
In 1823 the Van Diemen’s Land Bank was established with a subscribed capital
of 40,000 dollars, in 200 shares. British coin, as well as dollars, was circulated, and a
reduction of financial difficulties was gradually produced. The ring dollar passed
current at a later period at 3s. 3d., and the centre, or “ dump,” at Is. Id. The charter
of the Van Diemen’s Land Bank having expired, it became a joint stock company, and
enlarged its capital to £50,000, ten per cent, being charged upon discounts. The
Tasmanian was a private bank, of which the Messrs. Gellibrand were proprietors.
This bank yielded large returns, derived chiefly from the purchase of bills not passed
in the regular course of discount, which afterwards obtained. The Derwent, established
chiefly by persons connected with the Government, was opened for business on Ist
January, 1828, with a capital of £20,000. At the same time the Cornwall Bank, with a
capital of £IO,OOO, was established by the merchants of Launceston, The Commercial


Bank of Tasmania was established in 1832, and the Launceston Savings Bank in
1835. Instead of the two Government schools which proved sufficient for the wants of
the settlement in 1824, the number had now reached twenty-nine, with an attendance
of 1177 children. Allusion has already been made to the churches in the island;
and therefore, for the present dismissing affairs ecclesiastical, it may be mentioned that
instead of four edifices being used for divine worship when Governor Arthur arrived,
there were now eighteen where congregations could meet for public worship, prayer, and
praise. Thus it will be seen that the attraction of making money did not engross
the minds of the community so much as to permit of the religious wants of the
inhabitants being neglected. The means of internal communication had undergone a
vast improvement in Arthur’s time. In 1824 the mail was carried between the two
principal towns once a fortnight, and that on foot; but the requirements of the colony
demanded something more expeditious, and accordingly Mr. Montague was able to
report that “ the mail is now conveyed under contract in a mail cart twice a week
between those two towns in nineteen hours (121 miles ;) and there is also a public coach
twice a week upon the same road, as well as several public conveyances in other places
of the island for the accommodation of travellers.”
Governor Arthur, by his administrative ability, contributed in a very great
measure to the advancement of the colony. His efforts to suppress the depredations
of the blacks enabled the settlers in the interior to dwell in their homes in peace and
security. Bushranging at this time was almost extinct, which was in a great measure
due to the more humane discipline which he introduced. Macquarie Harbour had
been abandoned, and the prisoners were removed to Port Arthur, where a less rigorous
treatment was meted out to them. This place, situated on Tasman’s Peninsula, was
especially adapted for a convict establishment, as the only communication with the
mainland is by a very narrow neck of land, which was closely guarded by soldiers and
constables, as well as some ferocious watchdogs. Escape, therefore, for any of these
unfortunate culprits was hopeless. Owing to the employment of gangs of convicts
throughout the colony many permanent works were accomplished. The New Wharf
at Hobart Town was constructed at a cost to the Imperial Government of nearly
<£Bo,ooo. Roads throughout the interior were constructed. The construction of a
causeway across the Derwent at Bridgewater occasioned a large outlay of money. In
the towns public buildings began to make their appearance, and the settlers followed
the example set them by erecting more commodious dwelling-houses. By these
improvements the value of property was increased, and the general prosperity of the
colony enhanced. The formation of a Political Association —whatever that may mean
would be difficult to explain —at Hobart Town, was an event in the history of the
colony which deserves notice. The object of this association was to make an endeavour
to redress wrongs. Mr. Thomas Horne was honorary secretary, many colonists of high
standing being on the roll of members.


The Association did not hesitate to state its views, all deliberations being
held in public in the body of a hall, whilst spectators were admitted to the gallery. In
order to amend their social and political condition, the members appointed a council of
twenty-five of its body to represent to Governor Arthur the grievances which the
colonists generally were suffering. The following gentlemen comprised the committee :
Anthony Fenn Kemp, W. M. Gellibrand, George Gatehouse, W. S. Macmichael,
T. Y. Lowes, J. G. Briggs, David Lord, C. T. Smith, W. A. Broadribb, Francis Smith,
W. H. Glover, Thomas Dutton, Thomas Lewis, Thomas Hewitt, Andrew Bent,
Askin Morrison, John Lester, James Hackett, Edward Abbott, G. Stokell, J. T.
Gellibrand, Thomas Horne, Charles Seal, Henry Bilton, and Henry Melville. On
14th November, 1832, they addressed two letters to the Governor, wherein his
attention was called to the impropriety of allowing convicts as constables, on account
of the risk to which the settlers were liable, owing to false evidence. His Excellency
was also urged to abolish the military jury of seven officers, and to accord to the
colonists the right of trial by their peers. The reply that Governor Arthur gave to
these communications was very abrupt, and revealed a great want of tact on his pait.
“ He did not feel authorised,” he said in his reply to the secretary, “ without express
sanction from His Majesty, to enter into any correspondence whatever with any such
association.” Those who knew the Governor’s views in regard to according privileges
to free settlers would not be surprised at his reply. So much space has already been
devoted to the newspaper Press of Tasmania that it will suffice to state that at this
period the Press was remarkably active in its struggle to obtain political freedom.
Melville, who was the proprietor of the Colonial Times and the Trumpeter, did not
hesitate to declare his opinions upon the leading questions of the time.
He denounced what is now known as the “ back stairs ” business, and he boldly
declared that the system of prison discipline then existing was vicious and corrupt.
The True Colonist was the property of Mr. Gilbert Robertson, whose name is connected
with the operations of the parties formed to capture the blacks. On several occasions
he was imprisoned and fined for libels, but although having undergone so many
sentences of imprisonment, he, till the last day of Arthur’s administration, continued
to publish the most vindictive articles. The Cornwall Chronicle at Launceston, which
was then in the hands of William Lushington Goodwin, displayed a similar spirit of
acerbity, and announced on 28th May the recall of the Governor in a manner happily
unknown to us of the present day. The disaffection of the Press was caused through
what it considered to be derogatory to one holding the position of a Governor.
Arthur’s appointment of convicts of good behaviour to act as petty constables, his
patronage of the Bible and benevolent societies, but not of the Turf Club, the favour
he showed to some individuals, his bestowal of grants of land on his friends with a
liberal hand, the appointment of his nephews—Captains Montagu and Forster—to the
offices of Colonial Secretary and Chief Police Magistrate, together with some other acts


on his part of an injudicious nature, aroused the indignation of many of the colonists,
who desired to have their grievances ventilated in the columns of the journals then
published. There was no other circulating literature in the colony, and therefore the
literature, no matter how virulent, were patronised. Post Office messengers were
selected from the well-conducted prisoners who carried the mails to the house of every
settler, no matter how remote his dwelling. These men travelled on foot and performed
some marvellous journeys. There were, however, some newspapers in the colony
generally favourable to His Excellency, the Hobart Town Courier and Murray’s Review
and the Launceston Advertiser being amongst the number. The ordinary term of
colonial Governors was limited to six years, whereas Arthur’s had exceeded twelve,
from which it may be concluded that the Colonial Office regarded his services in a
most satisfactory light. When it became known that the departure of Governor
Arthur was soon to take place, the members of the Legislative Council waited on him
with a suitable address, which was presented by the Chief Justice, who addressed His
Excellency in a most becoming manner before handing it to him. The Governor, in
attempting to read his reply, was so overcome by his feelings that he burst into tears.
A levee was held on the morning of his departure, and was attended by all the
Government officers, a number of country gentlemen and settlers, and influential
inhabitants of Hobart Town, Accompanied by all the members of the Executive and
Legislative Councils, the civil and military officers, and many citizens, he proceeded on
board in the afternoon of the 31st October. Previous to the departure of Governor
Arthur, Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass arrived to take the duties of Acting-
Governor, on which he entered on 31st October, 1836, and continued to administer
the Government for two months and some days. On Governor Arthur’s return he was
created a baronet, and appointed Governor of Canada. In 1847 he was made a
member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council, and in 1853 was appointed Colonel of the
Queen’s Own Regiment. He died on 19th September, 1854, after a long and painful
illness, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Frederick Leopold.


GHAPTEE VII.
THE BLACK WAR.
1828-1830.
SUEING the administration of Governor Arthur the extermination of the
aborigines began to take place, and it will therefore be necessary to devote
some space to an account of this occurrence.
When Tasman discovered Van Diemen’s Land, the island was inhabited. The
voices of people were distinctly audible to him, and the recently cut notches, five feet
asunder, on the bark of the trees, as well as the smoke of fires, were clearly visible to
him. For 150 years after the discovery of the country it was completely forgotten,
until Captain Cook was despatched by the British Government to explore this
hemisphere. By one of those strange fatalities, highly unaccountable at least to the
finite mind, he was the means of opening to the nations the channels of civilisation
and religion, whilst to the unfortunate aboriginals he was the harbinger of death.
When the colony was founded in 1808, the aboriginal inhabitants were supposed to
number from five thousand to seven thousand. Although their origin remains in
obscurity, yet it is certain that they were a race distinct from the aborigines of
Australia, and this opinion is based on the fact that their hair was similar to that of
the African negro. It was only the early voyagers who had an opportunity of
witnessing the primitive manners and customs of the natives. Many of the aborigines,
when the island was occupied by Great Britain, were obliged to retreat to lands
belonging, in some instances, to tribes which were hostile ; and in cases where
amicable relations did exist, an unfriendly or jealous feeling was generated by the
intrusion, a circumstance which threw all previous observances into utter confusion.
Passing over the social differences which existed, and a philological discussion of the
different dialects spoken by the aborigines, it may be observed, so imperfect is our
knowledge of them, that accounts of their stature and physical structure vary con-
siderably. Strzelecki, who observed the natives on their removal to Flinders Island,
says: “ The native of New South Wales has on the whole a well-proportioned frame. His
limbs, less fleshy or massive than those of a well-formed African, exhibit all the
symmetry and peculiarly well-defined muscular development and well-knit articulations
and soundness which characterise the negro; hence compared with the latter he is


swifter in his movements, and his gait is more graceful.” It is generally acknowledged
by those who had the opportunity of meeting with the aborigines, that they were a
remarkably fine race of people. Robinson said that “ they are equal, if not superior,
to many Europeans.” Of course he must have qualified in his own mind, by
reservation, as far as regards physique.
They were addicted to dancing as a recreation, and in 1816 Kelly witnessed the
singular performances of a large party of them on the north-east coast. Even captivity
at Flinders did not annihilate the innate desire of indulging at times in their native
dances. Backhouse, who was present on one occasion, describes the scene which he
witnessed. He says : “ After sunset they had a ‘ corroboree,’ or dance, round a fire,
which they kept up till midnight in testimony of their pleasure. In these dances the
aborigines represented certain events, or the manners of different animals. They had
a horse dance, an emu dance, a thunder and lightning dance, and many others. In
their horse dance they formed a string, moving in a circle, in a half-stooping posture,
holding by each other’s loins, one man at the same time going along as if reining in the
others, and a woman as driver, striking them gently as they passed. ... In the
emu dance, they placed one hand behind them, and alternately put the other to the
ground and raised it above their heads as they passed slowly round the fire, imitating the
motion of the head of the emu when feeding. In the thunder and lightning dance
they moved their feet rapidly, bringing them to the ground with great force, so as to
produce a loud noise, and make such a dust as to render it necessary for spectators to
keep to windward of the group. Each dance ended with a loud shout, like a last
effort of exhausted breath.” By the use of catamarans, which were not unknown to the
aborigines, they were enabled to cross the flooded estuaries of rivers, and also to reach
islands some distance from the mainland.
The catamaran is a kind of boat, vessel, or, more accurately, raft or float used
by the Hindoos of Madras, the Island of Ceylon, and the parts adjacent. The word
signifies floating trees. It is formed of three logs of timber secured together by means
of three spreaders, and cross lashings through small holes. The central log is much
the largest, with a curved surface at the fore end, which terminates upwards in a
point. The side logs are very similar in form, but smaller, and with their sides
straight. These are fitted to the central log. The length of the structure is from
twenty to twenty-five feet. The crew, in India, consists of two men. In the monsoons,
when a catamaran is able to bear a sail, a small outrigger is placed at the end of two
poles as a balance, with a bamboo mast and yard, and a mat or cotton sail, “ Frail as
such a structure may appear, it can pierce,” says Mr. Edge, in the “ Royal Asiatic
Society’s Journal,” “ through the surf on the beach at Madras and reach a vessel in
the bay when a boat of ordinary construction would be sure to founder.” The des-
cription of the catamaran found by Labillardiere in Adventure Bay differs very widely
from that which is in use on the coast of India. It was of the rudest construction,


being made of pieces of bark and held together by cords made of grass. Lieutenant
Gunn found one at Maria Island capable of holding five or six persons, and strong
enough to drift for sixteen or twenty miles.
The migratory habits of the people caused them to construct rude huts, made
of boughs and bark. The spear of the native was a long, thin ti-tree pole, ten feet or
more in length, and pointed at both ends. The waddy was the only other weapon
used. The natives were so far civilised, however, as to have learned the value of
stones when fighting. Owing to their ignorance of any artificial means of ignition,
they always preserved a supply of fire, and carried bark torches when removing from
one place to another. They lived chiefly on fish, birds, and animals. They were
exceedingly superstitious; they always went to bed at dusk, rising again about mid-
night, and singing until daylight, to keep away or to pacify the evil spirits. They
believed in the existence of both a good and evil spirit—any other belief would be
illogical, considering what has already been said about their habits of rising at
midnight—and had some notion of a future state.
Their dead were burned on a funeral pile, a custom which was observed when
the island was visited by the French in 1792. Robinson, the aboriginal protector,
gives the following description of the manner of cremating the dead :—“ I was preparing
for his (Joe’s) departure to Hobart Town for medical assistance, when his groans
ceased, and with them the noise of the other natives. A solemn stillness prevailed; my
apprehensions became excited. I went out —he had just expired. The other natives
were sitting round, and some were employed in gathering grass. They then bent the
legs back against the thigh, and bound them round with twisted grass. Each arm was
bent together and bound round above the elbow. The funeral pile was made by
placing some dry wood at the bottom on which they laid dry bark, then placed more
dry wood, raising it about two feet six inches from the ground. A quantity of dry bark
was then laid upon the logs upon which they laid the corpse, arching the whole over
with dry wood, men and women assisting in kindling the fire ; after which they went
away, and did not approach it any more that day.” On the following day, if any
remains were left, they collected and burnt them, afterwards scraping the ashes
together, which they covered over with bark and sticks. During the administration of
Collins and Davey the natives resorted but little to aggression or violence, and those
cases which did occur were merely retaliatory acts for wrongs perpetrated on them by
the whites. Governor Davey, in a proclamation of 16th June, 1813, concludes by
asking, “ Let any man put his hand to his heart and ask, Which is the savage: the
white man who robs the parent of his children, or the black man who boldly steps
forward to resent the injury and recover his stolen offspring?” Governor Sorrell
frequently issued proclamations on the state of lawlessness prevailing. One ran thus:
“ Cruelties have been perpetrated upon the aborigines repugnant to humanity and
disgraceful to the British character.” The proclamations of Governors were as Fenton


observes) of no avail while convict stockmen, shepherds and bushrangers were
wandering at large with deadly weapons to seize upon their prey. Immediately after
Governor Arthur’s arrival, application was made to him by a tribe of this unfortunate
race for protection, which was readily though sorrowfully granted. They were placed at
Kangaroo Point, across the Derwent. The Governor spared no pains in looking after
these unfortunates who stayed happily and quietly where they were placed, until one
of their white (?) neighbours, who ought to have known something of the principles of
religion, even if he did not practise them, committed a savage murder. Splendid
specimen of humanity, which led to these wretched creatures retreating to the
wilderness ! The beautiful Christians misbehaved themselves so far, although they
might have sung a few minutes beforehand “ At eventide e’er the sun was set,” that the
blacks were obliged to retaliate. Why should they not retaliate ? They were treated
worse than dogs or beasts of prey : they were hunted as we hunt rabbits in the present
day. As for Bishop Nixon’s explanation of the retaliation of the blacks, it is worth
about as much as any other diplomatic announcement, and accordingly it is dismissed.
While these shocking tragedies were occurring on the mainland, the natives were
subject to cruelty from another quarter. Some of the islands in Bass Straits were in
possession of bands of freebooters. These beautiful specimens of humanity, on a par
with those already noticed, were originally runaway sailors and convicts from Port
Jackson, who, it is supposed, settled at first in the small islands of Bass Strait,
between Flinders and the coast of Van Diemen’s Land. These men—more beautiful
specimens of humanity—were known as sealers, and before they had long resided on
these islands—not one inch of them belonging to them by right or title—
they commenced their nefarious system of kidnapping the native women from
their tribes on the north and east coasts of Van Diemen’s Land. As other historians
have related the barbarities perpetrated by our white (?) brethren on the blacks (?) it is
only necessary to mention the shocking tragedies which had occurred. The ruffianly
conduct of those scoundrels who were known as sealers deserves no name too harsh
nor no punishment too severe. If the question be sifted to the bottom, no answer
except a most childish one can be given to the question, “By what right do we
possess this land of Australia ? ” We did not obtain it by conquest—there would
have been some glory in that. Who gave us the title deeds ? Jaga Jaga’s title deeds
to Batman were as valid as, and more so than any title the British Crown could give.
Here is a specimen of humanity as given by Fenton. “ The sealers were not long
upon the islands before they commenced a systematic mode of kidnapping the native
women from their tribes on the north and east coasts of Van Diemen’s Land. They
practised every degree of falsehood and deceit ” [mark the words] “ to get possession
of the women and carry them off to the islands in their boats. v It is unnecessary to
refer at any great length to the barbarities of white savages which were put an end to
by grape shot in the States some few years back, and might have been put an end to


in Van Diemen’s Land by the same process. “ Force till right is ready, was poor
Matthew Arnold’s motto, and it is the only one workable. Sometimes the black
women were tempted to go voluntarily, but generally speaking they were pui chased
from their relatives, and went away with reluctance. At other times they were
violently seized, whilst their protectors were ruthlessly shot down. Mr. Backhouse
gives the following account of the rescue of two aboriginal women from the
sealers :—“ In the afternoon we brought up under Circular Head, where a whaleboat
belonging to a sealer residing on Stack Island came alongside the cutter. Seated at
the stern was a native young woman of interesting appearance, neatly dressed, and
having her hair cut off, according to the common custom among her sex in this land.
The mild expression of her features was beclouded by sadness. When she spoke,
which was rarely, it was in a low tone. The sealers appeared to treat her kindly, but
there was something in their manner that excited suspicion. . . . On being asked if
she would go to Flinders Island and live with her people there, ‘ No,’ was her answer.”
On being told that the captain of the cutter had power to take her, and that the
sailors dare not molest her, she at once, with a feeling of joy, declared her desire to
go. Another woman, who had heard this statement, but who, up till then, had not
exhibited friendly feelings to the occupants of the cutter, abandoned the sealers, and
went with her baby in the cutter to Flinders. Inspired as the blacks were with a
deadly hatred to their white foes, owing to the shocking deeds perpetrated on them,
they adopted the most treacherous measures to seek redress. Stealthily creeping
through fern or scrub upon a settler’s homestead, they would wait until the male
inmates of the establishment had left, and then, approaching with all the tokens of
friendship, meanwhile dragging the spear by their side along the ground, they would
attack the defenceless women and children, and execute crimes of the greatest
enormity.

THE HISTORY OE TASMANIA
CHAPTER I.
EDUCATION.
JAMES FENTON, Esq.
THE enlightened condition of the masses in the present age contrasts strongly
with the ignorance which prevailed at the commencement of the nineteenth
century. The cause may be traced to the development of those great National
Institutions for the promotion of secular knowledge which now exist in nearly all
parts of the civilised world They are the glory of the age in which we live. They
have broken down the barriers that hitherto separated the classes from each other.
It is to the education of the masses that the British people owe the political freedom
they now enjoy. By means of State schools the workman has been raised from
the condition of a mere serf to that of a self-acting human being. The exercise of
the franchise is open alike to the peasant and the peer. The career of usefulness
may emanate from the humblest cottage as freely as from the mansion of the rich.
In no part of the world is there a more admirable system of National education
than in Tasmania. Many of her sons have risen from obscure stations in life, and
very humble parentage, to fill posts of the highest trust and honour, not only in
their own country, but in Australia, India, the British Isles, and other parts of the
world.
It was not, however, to the Government schools that the earlier Tasmanians
owe the proficiency they acquired in those branches of knowledge which fitted them
for important positions in after life. In the primitive days of the colony—before
the State threw open the storehouses of learning to the masses —there were very
superior private schools established for boys and girls at both ends of the island.
From these institutions went forth young men who subsequently made their mark
in the world. Amongst these, we maybe permitted to name Sir William J. Clarke,


Baronet, a native-born Tasmanian, who is now one of the most eminent scientific
men in the adjacent colony of Victoria; Sir Francis Smith, the former Chief Justice
of Tasmania, who received his early education in the colony; Sir William Lambert
Dobson, the present Chief Justice; the late Judge Giblin, and Sir Richard Dry,
Premier, both of whom were born and educated in the colony. Many other
prominent public men of the present day received instruction, when boys, in the
private schools of Tasmania.
The first record of schools was supplied by the Rev. R. Knopwood, M. A ,
in the year 1819, when the colony was fifteen years old. There were, altogether
at that time, 104 children receiving instruction at different schools throughout the
colony. A Sunday school (undenominational) was opened in December, 1810, and
another in 1821, in connection with the Wesleyan body. When Governor Arthur
arrived in 1824, there was a very loose system in operation. There were only two
schools under Government supervision ; Mr. Peter Archer Mulgrave, Chairman of
Quarter Sessions, had been appointed to superintend them. In 1828 there were
eight Government schools, with 410 scholars on the robs. During Governor
Arthur’s excellent administration of twelve years, the number of public schools
had increased from two to thirty, with 1331 scholars. Arthur took a deep interest
in education; he was the patron and friend of all institutions that tended to pro-
mote the interests of religion, morality, and useful knowledge. In 1828 he
established an institution which was much needed at the time—the King’s Orphan
School, which served as an asylum for the offspring of those unfortunate women
who had been transported to the colony and were undergoing terms of penal
servitude, in which condition they frequently fell lower from the paths of virtue,
and thus inflicted additional burdens on the State. The King’s Orphan School was
placed under the superintendence of Mr. R. W. Giblin, a gentleman of peculiar
fitness for the management. He was the late Judge Giblin’s grandfather. He and
his excellent wife succeeded in establishing the male and female branches of the
school on a system of economy, thorough efficiency, and high-toned morality, which
nothing could surpass. In two or three years later the fine block of buildings at
New Town (three miles from Hobart) were erected; the school numbered a couple
of hundred children of all ages, and in every respect the institution reflected credit
on the authorities, Mr. Giblin afterwards built a commodious mansion in the same
locality, and, having retired from the management of the Orphan School, opened a
private academy for boarders and day scholars. This school was very successful.
It imparted a superior standard of classical and commercial education to the sons
of the early colonists. In 1835 there were about sixty boarders and several day
scholars. Many of these rose to eminence in the learned professions, in the
legislatures of the Australasian colonies, in the army and navy, and in other
prominent positions. At this period there were other private schools of great
merit in both the southern and northern sides of the colony. Amongst them may


be mentioned the establishments of Mr. James Thompson, M.A., and Mr. Cowle,
Hobart; the Rev. Charles Price, Launceston; Mr. W. G. Elliston, Longford; and
the Rev. H. P. Kane, East Tamar. Nor were there wanting schools for girls : Mrs.
Clarke, of Ellinthorpe Hall, near Ross, had a boarding school for young ladies,
which was quite equal to the high-class schools in England at the time;
Mrs. Towner had a similar establishment, chiefly for day scholars, in Hobart, 4or
so young a colony in the remotest part of the globe, with the adjacent continent of
Australia absolutely uninhabited and unknown, except on its eastern and western
shores, those early schools in Tasmania were not only most creditable to the
colonists, but also fitted their sons and daughters for the exalted positions in life
to which many of them have attained. It may be remarked here that the men who
emigrated with their families prior to the year 1831—the year in which the system
of free grants of land ceased —were mostly possessed of capital, and were gentlemen
by birth and education, with exceptional boldness, determination and ability to
face the difficulties that surrounded them in a new country at the antipodes, where
their servants were of the criminal class, and they Avere exposed to many dangers
from the depredations of bushrangers and hostile blacks. They carried Avith them,
nevertheless, the habits and social refinements of their class in the Home country,
and Avere thus instrumental in raising to a high standard the religious, political,
and educational institutions of the young colony. They at once imparted vitality
to the former, and never rested until they succeeded in obtaining political freedom
for the land of their adoption.
Simultaneously Avith, or shortly after, the establishment of the private
schools Ave have named, educational institutions under boards of management Avere
founded Avith more or less success in \ T arious parts of the colony. As early as
1828 a King’s Grammar School Avas opened by Governor Arthur at Ncav Norfolk.
The members of the Government formed a Board of Guardians, and a clergyman
Avas appointed as master; but the effort did not meet with success, and the project
Avas abandoned. An attempt Avas also made at this time to form a collegiate insti-
tution at Norfolk Plains, on the Launceston side of the colony. TAventy-four
gentlemen contributed £SO each towards its establishment, Avith a library and
lecture-room, but after a short time the college became a private academy, Hie
project of establishing a college, however, did not die out. In 1846, Dr. Nixon,
the first Anglican Bishop of Tasmania resolved to establish a college in connection
Avith the Church of England. This scheme received a consideiable amount of
patronage both in the colony and in England; some £IO,OOO Avas raised by subscrip-
tion for its endowment, by which means Scholarships and Divinity Fellowships
Avere provided for. A fine block of land was purchased from Mr. W. G. Walker,
of Yron, in the district of Norfolk Plains; the name A\ r as altered to that of Bishops-
bourne; and “ Christ’s College” was opened in October, 1846. This establishment
started Avith every prospect of ultimate success, Avith the Bishop as Official Visitor,


a qualified warden as head manager; it possessed the finest classical library in the
southern hemisphere. But it is said that the management was extravagant and
injudicious, and the discipline defective; so that after a brief existence of about
ten years the college was closed. The property was let to tenant farmers, and
from the rents that accrued an effort was made at a later period to revive the
scheme in Hobart. The attempt turned out a failure through what must be
regarded as indiscreet management. Quite recently, the institution was amalga-
mated with the High School at Hobart, which had been for many years the premier
scholastic institution of the colony.
The High School was established in 1850 by some of the leading citizens
of Hobart and residents in the country, on strictly unsectarian principles. Sub-
scriptions were raised freely; a substantial and ornamental edifice was erected in
the Domain, where the Governor (Denison) had granted five acres of land for the
purpose. A rector was selected by the London University, who presided over the
school for a few years, when the Rev. R. D. Poulett-Harris was appointed in his
place. Mr. Harris retained the management for some twenty-eight years, during
which time the school prospered, and was justly regarded as a very superior educa-
tional institution. Between the years 1860 and 1886 the pupils of this school
gained 14 out of 42 Tasmanian and Gilchrist Scholarships, and during the same
period 91 pupils received the degree of Associate of Arts out of a total of 251
successful competitors in the colony.
By an Act of 1858, eight scholarships, each of the value of .£2OO per annum,
and tenable for four years at a British University, are founded, of which two are
annually competed for by male Associates of Arts, of ages above sixteen and under
twenty, and who have resided in the colony for not less than the five preceding
years. The awards are made by a Council of Education appointed by the Governor-
in-Council, which body is also empowered to award other scholarships tenable in
the colony, and to confer the A. A. degree upon all students who pass a satisfactory
examination according to the standard of proficiency declared by the Council.
Tasmanian law students who have acquired the degree of A.A. are exempted
from a literary examination prior to admission to the bar ; and in England the
General Council of Education, and the Royal College of Surgeons, accept the
degree in lieu of the literary examination required from medical students, provided
the associate has passed in Latin and Mathematics. Thus it will be seen that the
Tasmanian system of education offers facilities to youths who are desirous of con-
tinuing their studies for either of the learned professions ; and each year two of the
most proficient receive the advantage of a collegiate education at the seats of
learning in the mother country.
The Hutchin’s School, established by the Episcopalians, under a Board of
Management, was built in 1847, on a site granted for school purposes in Macquarie
Street, Hobart. The Head Master is the Rev. J. V. Buckland, BA., who has


conducted it with great success and benefit to the colony ever since its establish-
ment. Since the year 1800 the Council of Education has awarded over seventy
A.A, degrees and twelve scholarships to the pupils of the Hutchin’s School. There
is an average attendance of T27 pupils.
The Launceston Church Grammar School, established about the same
period, with the Bishop of Tasmania as Visitor, is a kindred institution in the north.
It has been of great service to the colony, and its pupils have gained scholarships
and other honours. The Rev. A. H. Champion, 8.A., is Head Master, and the
average attendance at the school is seventy-eight pupils.
Horton College, near Ross, was founded in 1855 by the late Captain
Horton. It is situated near the Main Line Railway, between Hobart and Laun-
ceston, in a pleasant and healthy locality. It is surrounded by an open, thinly
peopled pastoral country, over which the pupils are permitted to wander, subject,
of course, to judicious discipline. The pure, bracing air of this locality has been
found exceedingly invigorating to the students, who, being removed from the
distractions of town life, are thus enabled to give undivided attention to their
studies. The institution is under the supervision and control of a President
appointed by the Wesleyan Conference. The Horton Scholarship of £2O, founded
by Mrs. Horton, of Somercotes, near Ross, is open for annual competition, and the
Manton Exhibition of £2O is awarded on certain conditions embodied in the Deed.
There are about sixty students, mostly boarders. Many of the students of this
College have gained the honour awarded annually by the Council of Education.
The President is the Rev. Francis Neale, and Mr. W. W. Fox, 8.A., is Head
Master.
There are Presentation Convent Schools at Hobart and Launceston —the
former established in 1858, and the latter in 1873. They are under the manage-
ment of the Roman Catholic Church, and impart a useful English education to
children of any denomination. They have an average attendance of 284 and 256.
The children display considerable proficiency at the annual examinations. The
Ladies’ Grammar School, Hobart, in connection with the Church of England, was
established in 1870, has thirteen teachers and an average of eighty-five pupils.
There is also a Ladies’ College in Hobart, presided over by a Council consisting
of the Lord Bishop of Tasmania; Sir Lambert Dobson, Chief Justice; Thomas
Stephens, Esq., M.A., Director of Education, and others. Lady Principal, Miss
Giblin, Vice-Principal, with eight assistants. This College is undenominational.
There are many other excellent private schools in Hobart and Launceston,
of which may be mentioned as well-established and superior institutions, the
Scotch College at the corner of Brisbane and Elizabeth Streets, Hobart: A.
Ireland, Head Master. Two Scholarships, £l2 and £8 respectively; attendance,
seventy-seven. The Metropolitan School, Hobart: Head Master, Rev. F. Shaun,
with four Scholarships—one of £l2, and three of less value. The Launceston


High School, Prince’s Square : Head Master, E. A. Nathan, M.A., with 115
pupils. The Collegiate Institute, Launceston :T. Hogg, Master, seventy-six
pupils. City School, Launceston, with an attendance of 224. And last, but not
least, the Ladies’ College, Launceston, recently established. This is such an
important and valuable institution, we shall describe its rise and progress in detail.
The establishment of a Ladies’ College in Tasmania under the auspices and
management of the Wesleyan Church, had long been projected. So far back as
the year 1863, the Australasian Wesleyan Conference passed a resolution expressing
“ a strong conviction of the importance of establishing such an institution in
connection with our Church, and (this Conference) gives its consent to the
Tasmania District Meeting to undertake the enterprise.” It was not, however,
until the Victoria and Tasmania Conference of 1880 that a committee was
appointed “to raise subscriptions, and to take such other ‘steps as they may think
necessary for the establishment of a Ladies’ College in Tasmania.” The committee
consisted of the lie vs. J. Cope, G. Daniel, G. B. Richards, H. J. Lavers,
F. E. Stephenson, G. T. Heyward, with Messrs. W. Hart, M. Tyson, J. Drysdale,
F. Stanfield, T. Parramore, and li. Gee. The committee met in April, 1880, and
decided that, in consequence of a liberal proposal made by the Honourable William
Hart, of Launceston, there would be no necessity for further delay in taking
initiatory steps towards the establishment of the institution. The late Miss Cowie,
of St. Paul’s, near Avoca, had left a legacy for this purpose, which, with accruing
interest, amounted to about £7OO, and Mr. Hart offered to pay one-third of the cost
if the latter did not exceed £6ooo—in other words, he offered a subscription of
£2OOO. A list was then opened for contributions, and a considerable sum was
raised. Amongst the donory were Mr. C. B. Grubb, £SOO ; Mrs. W. D. Grubb,
£200; Mr. E. Shoobridge, £l5O ; Mr. T. Parramore, Mrs. Parramore, Mrs. W.
Gibson, jun., and two anonymous friends, £IOO each; the Hon. E. W. Grubb,
Messrs. J. and T. Gunn, R. H. Price, £SO each. The sum of £265 was contributed
by the Wesleyan District Meeting, and numerous subscriptions under £SO each
were added to the building fund. The committee then proceeded to select a
suitable site for the College in or near Launceston. There was considerable delay
in this matter. The value of land had increased within a few years by two and
three hundred per cent, in some instances, and it was also difficult to obtain an
eligible site at any price. At length, however, a piece of ground was purchased on
the western slope of the Windmill Hill; but building operations had commenced,
a much more suitable place became available on the Elphin Road, about a mile from
the centre of the city. It consisted of a well-built and commodious mansion, with
about two and a half acres of land. This beautiful property was purchased by the
Ladies’ College Committee on the 17th September, 1884, for the sum of £3600.
As a site for this purpose it stands unrivalled. It commands a magnificent view
of the surrounding country. To the east and on either side are highly cultivated


fields, gardens, and orchards attached to handsome villa residences, which front,
like the Ladies’ College, on the Elphin Road. At some little distance, the North
Esk meanders through the plain; while beyond the river rise slopes and valleys, in
places thinly wooded, and in others under cultivation, with homesteads inter-
spersed ; and in the distance, more elevated hills and lofty mountains, with their
charming variety of light and shade, complete one of the most lovely landscapes
imaginable. No time was now lost in enlarging the premises. An elaborate and
handsome design (as shown in the engraving) was chosen, and tenders were
accepted from Messrs. Thompson and Bushby for the execution of the work for
the sum of £4400. The wing on the left side was the original mansion ; the tower
and buildings seen on the right are the principal additions. The new buildings
afford accommodation for forty boarders and a large number of day scholars.
Altogether, the premises when completed and furnished cost about £IO,OOO. The
College was opened in January, 1886. The Rev. Spencer Williams was appointed
President of the College, and G. Thornton Lewis, Esq., 8.A., Head Master. There
is a lady principal, assisted by a staff of highly efficient resident and visiting
teachers. The course of instruction embraces all the usual branches of a sound
English education, the languages, lectures on scientific subjects, including laws of
health and domestic economy, and all the accomplishments necessary to a lady’s
education. One aim of the college is to train the character—to create in all who
enter the classes “ a resolute hatred of evil and an earnest love of goodness.” As
a high-class scholastic institution, the Ladies’ College has been quite a success.
During part of the first year of its existence there were ninety one day scholars
and boarders on the roll. The excellence of the Tasmanian climate has contributed
to the success of the undertaking by inducing parents in Australia to send their
children across the Straits to be educated at the college, where, as the prospectus
truly says, “No pains are spared to make the studies as cheerful and attractive, as
much home-like, and as little school-like as possible.”
A very large number of private schools are open for boarders and day pupils
in the chief towns and rural districts of the colony. At the beginning of 1887, they
numbered (including those we have specially named) 165. The number of children
attending these schools was 5495—2639 boys and 2856 girls. At the same date
there were five Ragged schools, all at Hobart, maintained chiefly by the Govern-
ment, and in part by private subscriptions. There were 600 on the rolls, but the
average attendance during the year was only about 400. These schools receive £SOO
a year from the Government, and about £2OO from other sources. There are
four Industrial schools under Benevolent Institutions : the Boys’ Home, at Hobart,
with 23 inmates; St. Joseph’s Orphanage, Hobart, with39girls ; Hobart Industrial
School, with 35 girls ; and Launceston Industrial School, with 29 girls. These four
schools involve an expenditure of about £2676 annually, of which upwards of £IOOO
is contributed by the State, There are also two Training schools—one for boys,


with an average of 30, and one for girls, with an average of 10 inmates. They
receive about £I2OO annually in the shape of Government aid.
We shall now briefly describe the progress of the State schools since the
time when, in 1824, there were only two in the colony—one at Hobart and one
at Launceston. In 1827, the settled portion of the island was divided into police
districts, to each of which were appointed a stipendiary magistrate, police clerk,
district constable, a police staff, and a district surgeon. Public buildings were
erected in the country townships, including churches and schoolhouses, to which
clergymen and schoolmasters were appointed ; and a small number of soldiers were
stationed in each village. During the twelve years of Governor Arthur’s adminis-
tration, the colony made rapid advancement in every way. In 1824, the population
was under 13,000, of whom half were convicts ; in 1835, it had increased to
upwards of 40,000, of whom about 23,000 were free people. One and a half
million acres of land had been alienated, and nearly 90,000 acres were under
cultivation. All this tended to make way for the establishment of public schools in
the rural districts. In 1836, when Governor Arthur took his departure from
Tasmania, there were 80 Government schools, attended by 1331 scholars.
At this period there was no fixed system observed in the management of the
public schools. Nominally they were open to children of all denominations, but
the Episcopalians took the most active part in their establishment, and in the
appointment of masters who belonged to their church. The salaries of the teachers
were so low that, as a rule, only untrained persons who lived in the neighbourhood
and had other means of living, were willing to accept the position of schoolmaster.
In 1838, the British and Foreign system was introduced; a Board was appointed to
look after the interests of education, and a few competent masters were brought out
from England. Immediately after this apparent reform there was, however, a most
remarkable falling off in the number of schools and attendants. The former were
reduced from 84 in 1838, to 22 in 1839, and the children, who numbered 1380 in
1838, were reduced to 785 in 1839. We are unable to trace the cause of this
decline in a country that was still rapidly increasing in population. From the latter
date until 1847 the number of schools continued lower than in previous years. In
1847 there were only 28, but there were 2557 scholars. In the following year no
less than 42 new schools were established, and in 1851 there were 87 State schools,
with an active Inspector who travelled over all parts of the colony with indescribable
difficulty on bush tracks and unmetalled roads hardly passable on horseback.
It was not, however, until the year 1853 that a radical change took place in
the management of the schools. In that year a Select Committee was appointed
by the Legislative Council for the purpose of making inquiry into the question of
public education. Hie Committee in its report condemned the principle of denomi-
national schools on the ground that “ it would necessarily lead to the multiplication
of small schools, and thereby either increase the expense to an amount beyond what


could be safely charged on the public revenue, or perpetuate the employment of
inefficient teachers.” Prior to this period public education was conducted on the
“ penny a day ” system in a very primitive fashion ; the central control was vested
in the Governor-in-Council, and the administration in an Inspector of Schools. A
Board of Inspectors was now appointed, consisting of Archdeacon Davies, Episco-
palian ; Rev. Dr, Lillie, Presbyterian; Rev. W. Hall, Church of Rome; and Mr.
Inspector Arnold. The Select Committee recommended “ that the charge for
public education be met out of the general revenue rather than by local rate;
that the penny a day system be abolished ; and that the control of the Education
Department be entrusted to a Central Board, consisting of members of the Executive
and Legislative Councils, who should be empowered to regulate fees and classify
teachers, such Board to be assisted by an Inspector, who should act as secretary
also.” These recommendations were adopted, and the Board proceeded vigorously
to establish new schools. The new system commenced with 2734 scholars and an
average attendance of 2024. In the year 1865 there were 102 schools, 5357 regis-
tered pupils and the average attendance was 4076. In 1882 the number of schools
had increased to 181, with 9302 pupils and an average attendance of 6711. During
the next four years the advance was still more marked. At the end of 1886
there were 209 public schools —16,014 distinct scholars on the rolls during the
year, with an average daily attendance of 7866. The total expenditure upon State
education during the year 1886, exclusive of special grants for buildings, &c.,
amounted to £25,858. The school fees paid by parents in aid of teachers’ salaries
during the year amounted to £8458. Each scholar in average daily attendance
would therefore cost £4 10s. lid., of which £1 Is. Od. was derived from fees and
£3 9s. sd. from the public revenue. At the close of 1886 the estimated number
of children living in Tasmania was. of ages from 7 to 14 years, 22,628. When
the last census of population was taken in 1881, there were 19,322 children
in the colony of ages from 7 to 14, of whom 7545 attended State schools, 4521
went to private schools, 3075 were instructed at home, and the large number of
4181 were not accounted for as receiving instruction.
From the above figures it will be seen that great progress is being made in
educational matters, much of which is owing to the excellent system under which
the Government schools are now conducted. As soon as the new Board was
appointed in 1853, the Legislative Council determined to apply fixed sums
annually for school purposes. It began by voting £9415 for the year 1854. New
regulations were at the same time issued by the Board; the schools were made
strictly undenominational, but selections from the Scriptures, similar to those used
in the Irish National Schools, were to be read, and the other school books
published or sanctioned by the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland
were generally adopted. An hour was set apart for religious instruction five days
in the week, when it was competent for the ministers of the various denominations


to make arrangements and devote each a portion of that time in imparting
Christian knowledge to the children of the members of their respective communions.
This system has continued to work fairly well; but the Roman Catholics, in some
instances, object to the principle, and advocate the adoption of a system familiarly
known as “ payment by results.” “ This system (observes Dr. Murphy, Bishop of
Hobart, in his petition to the Governor-in-Council in July, 1884) consists in paying
for work done ; or, in other words, a fair wage for a fair day’s work. It remunerates
the teacher of the school for the amount of secular instruction he imparts to his
pupils according to the standard prescribed by the Government. The school is
open to the Government Inspector, and allows the children to be examined by him
in those subjects of secular instruction as are the pupils of the State schools, and
is content with payment to be made upon his report and certificate as to the
amount of proficiency attained, thus supplying a guarantee - that the intentions of
the State are carried out, and that the public funds are properly expended.” Both
the Government and Parliament, however, have determined not to recognise
denominational schools.
In 1867 a Royal Commission was appointed “ to consider, inquire into, and
report upon the present system of public education in this colony, and the best
mode of reducing the Government expenditure under that head,” The report of
the Commissioners clearly demonstrated the fact that reduction of expenditure was
impracticable. They recommended compulsory education at the cost of the parents
if they were able to pay the fees, and at that of the State if they were not; the
appointment of local School Boards and Inspectors; a more liberal outlay upon
school-houses, teachers’ residences, and other matters. Most of the recommenda-
tions of the Royal Commission of 1867 were adopted by the Government, and the
sum of £ll,OO0 —the amount estimated by the Board of Education as necessary for
school purposes for the year 1868—was granted. The Central Board now consisted
of honorary members appointed by the Governor-in-Council, and Mr. Thomas
Stephens, M.A., Oxon., was the active and energetic inspector. Schools were
established in any of the most distant and isolated localities where twenty children
could be placed on the roll as attendants. In the course of time the Central Board
became unpopular, and the local Boards, on account of the stringent regulations,
which narrowed the scope of their usefulness, became practically inoperative. This
condition of affairs led to the appointment of another Royal Commission in 1883.
It consisted of the Hon. C. H. Bromby, Messrs. W. H. D. Archer, B. S. Bird,
E. N. C. Braddon, Rev. R. D. Poulet-Harris, and Rev. James Scott. These
gentlemen were required to “ make diligent inquiry into the existing systems of
public education in Tasmania and the neighbouring colonies, and the manner in
which provision is made for the same,” and to report and offer suggestions, &c.
The Commissioners entered most energetically on their work, commencing to sit
on Ist March, 1883, holding meetings almost daily until 19th May. Thirty-two


ministers of religion and leading citizens gave vivd voce evidence before the
Commission. Mr. T. Stephens, Chief Inspector, and Messrs. Rule and Doran,
Sub-Inspectors of Schools, replied in writing to sixty-two questions ; 82 chairmen
of Local School Boards replied to forty-eight questions; 32 masters of superior
schools, and other gentlemen interested in the question of education, replied to
twenty-seven ; and 132 teachers under the Board of Education answered eighty-two
—all the questions bearing on subjects entrusted to the Commission to deal with.
The Commissioners sent in a voluminous report, with evidence taken, and other
documents, spreading over 260 quarto pages of printed matter, in which the whole
question of national education was considered. They summarised the results of
their exhaustive inquiries by recommending that public education in Tasmania
be “ compulsory, free and secularand in addition to these primary points, they
recommended drill and gymnastics to be more fully recognised ; an improvement in
the training of teachers ; an increase of salaries in certain cases ; additional pupil
teachers; private elementary schools to be subject to departmental inspection, with
power to order any insufficiently instructed children to be sent to a public school;
greater facilities to be afforded for the establishment of Industrial Schools,
Reformatories, half-time, evening, and Infant Schools ; a School of Mines in
Launceston; an Agricultural School at the New Town model farm, and ether
reforms. The Commissioners also recommended that the central control be vested
in a Minister of the Crown, to be aided by a paid Director, and a Board of
Patronage and Advice, consisting of elected members of District Boards ; that the
members of District Boards be elected by the ratepayers; that a law be enacted
prohibiting the employment of children under twelve years of age in factories ; and
that increased grants be awarded for the encouragement of Superior Education.
Parliament did not entirely assent to these proposals. The Board of Education
was abolished, and the central control vested in a responsible Minister. Chief
Inspector Stephens was appointed Director of Education; but the District Boards
are still appointed by the Executive, instead of being elected by the ratepayers, and
no central Board of Advice exists. By the Act of 1885 the system of instruction is, as
before, undenominational, and compulsory in the case of children whose ages are from
seven to thirteen years ; but school fees, regulated by the Governor-in-Council, are
required from parents who are able to pay. In all cases of poverty, children are
admitted free of any payment whatever. The law requires parents, under the penalty
of a fine for neglect, to send their children of the ages specified to some school, unless
a reasonable excuse for failing to do so can be given. Children attending State
schools are taken on the Government railways free of charge to and from the
nearest public school. Altogether the present system is extremely liberal, and is
working admirably. There are three Inspectors under the Director of Education —
Messrs. James Rule, Senior Inspector; Gerard Bourdillon, M.A; and Joseph
Masters, M.A. Twelve exhibitions are annually awarded of the value of £l6 13s. 4d.


each —six for boys and six for girls—tenable for four years from Ist July. Candidates
must be between ten and twelve years of age, and must have attended one of the
State schools for at least twelve months prior to the Ist June. The children who
are not exempt are required to attend school at least three days in each week.
Any who have been educated up to the compulsory standard may claim exemption
from further attendance after they attain the age of eleven years. There is a
provision in a recent Act that the head teacher of every school, not being a State
or Sunday school, shall, under a penalty of £5 for non-compliance, furnish to the
Minister of Education, in the month of January in each year, a nominal return,
giving the sex, age, residence, and school attendance of every child attending the
school during the preceding year. A school for Technical education has recently
been opened at Hobart, and it is the intention of the Government to establish a
similar institution and a School of Mines at Launceston.
THE FINGAL DISTRICT.
an Old Colonist.
My experience extends over a period of some nineteen years. Nineteen years back
Fingal was similar to an isolated little borough, whose interests were centred
in itself, and that interest among a few selected individuals. The township is finely
placed, high mountain ranges surrounding in all directions, giving a capital back-
ground, and overseer’d by the noble Ben Lomond. This township was the centre
of large sheep and cattle runs, and the best lands were held in the name of a large
estate of some 30,000 acres, Malahide. Few hands were employed, and the absence
of progress can be distinctly traced to the fact of Fingal lands being in the hands
of so few persons.
The adjoining estate of Tullochgorum was another example of the same
depressing influences. Eastwards on the other side of Malahide comes Killymoon,
a repeat of the other two estates—still less hands employed. This was, and
remains to this day, the main feature of Fingal. Ten miles further eastward and
seaward we come to St. Mary’s. This district presents entirely new features—and
a different class of circumstances. This is the district of butter and cheese. The
land is all cut up into farms of various sizes. 'These farms produce from its rich
grasses, cheese and butter equal to any production, and have been long famed in
this direction. Bacon is also produced in large quantities, and a very important


and profitable trade for live pigs is carried on with the Chinese, who come down to
buy from Thomas’ Plains and other mining communities. The farms at St. Mary’s
bring at the present time a rental double that of former days. Wheat does not do
well, but oats and peas give good returns, and there is some fattening of cattle.
Within a radius of seven miles from St. Mary’s township is some land equal to
anything known in soils of splendid quality, and matching the famed Pingarooma
description. There is the same luxuriant and overabundance of grass. This
applies to Germantown, a small district high up among the hills, with its delightful
and genial climate. Dublintown, within a mile or two of Germantown, is at a
lower level, but much of its land is of exactly similar character.
In both Germantown and Dublintown there is plenty of freestone, and coal
crops up here and there in the deep gullies. There is a disease common to both
these places in the spring and early summer —“ too much feed.” The farmers
cannot keep it down ; grow it will, and cattle get blown and die, and unless special
care is taken to keep them in “ fed-down paddocks,” loss—and great loss —takes
place.
This condition of luxurious waste suggests Silo’s. It is impossible to keep
sufficient cattle when this vast feed is in to make profitable use of it, because, as it
will be at once seen, in the winter and autumn months the land would then be
terribly overstocked, and starvation and ruin would result; but with much of this
provender conserved not required for current feeding, a much larger number of
cattle could be permanently kept. These rsnffirks apply to the similar rich lands
of Pingarooma and elsewhere, and is very promising for a better and l2Tg er supply
of winter beef. Proceeding on our way eastwards we reach St. Mary’s Pass. It
is often true that anything new carries the sway, so to some the pass on the
Scotsdale Poad was held to be far more entrancing than our old friend St. Mary’s,
of which so many descriptions have been given. Scotsdale Pass is associated with
vast expanse of view, wonderful growth of splendid fern trees, and beautiful little
trickling streams of water ever running; but with St. Mary’s there is danger
abroad, and a feeling of what might be. The pass turns and winds in such a way
that frequent opportunities are offered for the traveller to observe the tract. He
will have to pursue along this five-mile passage. There it is right in front, a narrow
road barely able to accommodate two vehicles passing each other. The side
protection may be a log of some twenty-four inches through ; but it may be only
ten inches, and you look from that bit of road down, down that deep gorge right
away down to the bottom as far as the undergrowth will allow, and then you raise
your eyes upwards to that ledge of road and contemplate contingencies. It is,
of course, all right when you have passed along. Jogging with it may be thought-
lessness ; but occasionally it will occur to you how would it be if all was not right.
A restive or vicious horse might soon bring disaster, and a paragraph with an
undertaker’s notice might be the result. However, very few accidents have taken


place ; but the awful depths do militate against some persons’ pleasure in traversing
this, after all, magnificent pass.
Falmouth, on the sea-coast, is reached by this pass. There is one estate—
there is one owner—at Falmouth. It is let to two tenants. Cheese, butter and cattle
fattening is the work of this place, as well as at St. Mary’s, and in all three the
produce is equal to any elsewhere. Falmouth has a nice beach. I have said its
all there is nothing more; it is done. At one time Falmouth may have been of
some importance, but its glory has long since departed. In the old days, however,
it was the shipping port for the whole of the Fingal district, right dowm below
Avoca. There was always delay and trouble. Cargo would be carried from Hobart
to George’s Bay, and back to Hobart again, the vessel being unable to land that
cargo, and when the fine main road was completed, the waggon took the place of
the sailing vessel, and now the railway system is connected' with St, Mary’s. The
carrying is easy and quick to any locality.
Some few miles towards George’s Bay is the lovely river Scamander. There
is a good future for this bit of water some day. Curving and winding its way in all
directions, widening out its waters here and there into lake form, there is scope for
a pietty sail in many places. The whole surroundings are very beautiful. You can
get good fishing and good shooting. What is wanted is a good accommodation
house, stabling, &c., and some three or four-roomed detached cottages, plainlv
furnished, for letting, with use of boat, fishing tackle, food and bedding supplied
from the big house, and a pleaSaut proprietor with a famous helpmate. As it is,
er § notning for it but to take a run to the Scamander and back again to
Falmouth.
George s Bay, farther on, used to belong to the Fingal district. Some years
back this interesting and pretty port was cut ofi and tacked on elsewhere, so we
must return back by the same road we came, retracing our steps up that pass. It
is a slow tiudge under the most favourable circumstances, either for man or horse.
Getting back to Fingal we run out to Mangana, five miles from that
township, the first place in the colony where gold was found, I believe. This little
out-of-the-way place has been the scene of many changes, intermittent successes,
and back again to dreary inactivity. The Mangana gets a turn every few years.
So it is with Mathina, up and down, ever and again each place shakes herself up as
it weie, casts aside her sloth, and quickens into fresh life, attracting by wondrous
finds and promised wealth. The speculation peg goes to work, and land is marked
off in all directions. Companies are formed and calls made, and the jingling of the
money changing hands is the most promising sound and frequently the last heard,
and then slumber again overtakes the overtaxed, and Mangana and Mathina go
into hiding. But both these places will come out right yet, and the sooner when
we can get true and faithful legitimate mining. Mathina, I should have said, is
sixteen miles at right angles to Mangana from Fingal.


FERNS OF TASMANIA.
It is a well-known fact that the Colony of Tasmania, next to New Zealand, produces
the finest ferns in the world, both as regards variety and delicacy of structure ; and
as Tasmania abounds in picturesque scenes, a walk through the fern ravines is to
the traveller a source of pleasure, while to the student of botany the opportunity
for study is unsurpassed. It is now our purpose to mention briefly those ferns
which are peculiar to the colony, and as the range is wide, we will particularise only
a few on the list. First we have the Gleichenia, a creeping fern, of which there are
several varieties which are to be found chiefly in the northern part of the colony.
These varieties are the Gleichenia Microphylla, which is highly esteemed in the
English gardens. The Gleichenia Dicorpa is rather a common Tasmanian plant,
and varies extremely in the amount of woolly clothing it bears. The Tasmanian
specimens are much larger than those which are found in any of the other colonies.
The last and most valuable of this family, the Gleichenia Flabillatta, or broad-
frond fern, is to be found along the banks of streams in the north-eastern portion of
the colony, is highly prized in the English market, and will command a high price
there, specimen plants having been sold at from twenty to forty guineas each. The
Dicksonia ferns are noted for the height of the trees; the variety in Tasmania have
trunks from thirty to fifty feet high, with fronds from six to twelve feet long, and
are to be found in nearly every portion of the colony. The varieties are the
Antartica and Dubia Among the most beautiful ferns in the world are the
Hymenophyllum, which are noted for the transparent texture of the delicate green
glistening fronds, and are to be found only in the darkest recesses, where there is
plenty of moisture. This is a great favourite with collectors, as it is very valuable
in the English market. There are five varieties. The Trichomanes is a very
delicate fern, often found clothing the trunks of tree ferns. The fronds of this
variety are from two to five inches in length, and a fine membrane runs through the
leaf. Although the Adiantum, or Maiden-hair Fern, is to be found in both Europe
and America, yet the Tasmanian variety is noted for the peculiar fineness of its
texture, which is superior to any to be found in the other Australian colonies. The
varieties of the Conaria are very numerous, and are to be found both in low boggy
places and on the tops of mountain ranges. They can be easily distinguished by the
peculiar tufted fronds. Asplenium ferns are highly prized on account of the peculiar
habit of bearing germinating bulbs on the panicles; hence the popular name
Bulbiferum. There is only one variety of the Todea to be found in Tasmania, and
it is by no means common. It is only found in the northern portion of the island.
The fronds of this fern frequently attain the length of from eight to ten feet. Aside
from the varieties of ferns already mentioned, there is a wide range, which are to be
found in other portions of the world, and allied to these are a great variety of


beautiful mosses, to be found in both moist and dry places, according to the variety.
Mr. F. Walker, who came to Launceston, Tasmania, in 1874, has made a specialty
of collecting ferns, and has in his extensive enclosure every variety, from the
Dicksonia, or tree fern, down to the very fine Hymenophyllum, or filme fern, which
are so much esteemed for the decoration of Wardine cases. Mr. Walker is prepared
to furnish collectors with specimens of all the varieties, which can be arranged in a
handsome bound volume. He also devotes his attention to the cultivation of both
Tasmanian and European flowers, among which may be enumerated roses and
camellias, which are imported directly from the home of these plants, and thrive in
the genial climate of Tasmania.
CHRISTIAN MISSION CHURCH, LAUNCESTON, TASMANIA.
This church was founded by the late Henry Reed, a pioneer of the colony, in
the year 1877. The site upon which the church building now stands was formerly
occupied by a hotel and livery stable, and the circumstances in connection with the
purchase of the property are interesting. During a visit of Mr. Reed to Melbourne
in 1875, a horse of his ran away in Launceston and met with an accident not far
from the above-mentioned hotel in Wellington-street. The hotel-keeper, being a
good horse doctor, removed the animal to his stable to care for him. On Mr. Reed’s
return to Launceston the coachman was sent to bring the horse home, but word was
returned that he was not in a fit condition to be removed. The following day Mr.
and Mrs. Reed called on the hotel-keeper, when an offer was made of the property
for £IOOO, which was accepted, and in due time the purchase was concluded. At
this time it was not Mi-. Reed’s proposal to found a church, but simply to establish
an evangelistic mission station. It was nearly a year after the purchase of the
property that he commenced to preach the Gospel. The work grew rapidly, and
was so fruitful that in the course of ten months he saw the necessity of increasing
the accommodation, and reluctantly took steps toward founding the church. The
first place of worship was in a long wooden building 60ft. by 15ft., which had been
formerly used for large dinner parties in the more prosperous days of Tasmania, but
at the time of the purchase was filled with numberless bottles and rubbish. The
debris was cleared away, gas was laid on, and the place was whitewashed. In July,
1876, the first meeting was held in this enclosure, and as the place was crowded
from the very first, the necessity for larger and more permanent quarters was
evident; but it was not until toward the close of 1879 that the new building, which
is the present Sunday-school, was commenced. Until the new building was
completed, the congregation had to be provided for, and to do this the stables on


the opposite side of the yard were cleared out, and many alterations were made in
them to secure a comfortable place to worship. This served until the brick building
was completed the following year, the first services being held by Mr. Reed himself on
Sunday, 6th June, 1880. In August, 1878, a Sunday school was opened in what was
formerly the billiard room of the hotel, and to it were gathered the poorest children
from the streets, but after the completion of the new building the school was conducted
there. For two years these accommodations were found to be sufficient, but in 1882
the remaining yard was covered over and formed into a temporary shelter for the large
congregation that crowded to the place. This Pavilion, as it was called, had seats
for eight hundred, and there were often more than that number present on Sunday
evenings. In 1880, Pastor D. W. Hiddleston came to Launceston, from Melbourne,
on invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Reed, to assist in the work, and his labours were
eminently successful. A short time after the death of Mr, Reed, which occurred
during the latter part of 1880, the building, now known as the Memorial Church,
was commenced by Mrs. Reed, but was not completed until 1885 ; the first services
being held in July of that year. The new church has a seating capacity of fourteen
hundred, though sixteen hundred persons have been accommodated in the building.
A few months after the completion of the church Pastor Hiddleston was prostrated
by a severe illness, and on that account —for many months up to this time—was
unable to take any part in the work. Supplies were then obtained from the other
colonies until, in 1885, Dr. H. Grattan Guinness, of London, paid a visit to
Australasia, and during his four months’ residence in Launceston undertook the
pastorate temporarily, at the request of the church, which he held to the entire
satisfaction of the congregation. In August, 1886, Pastor G. Saltau arrived in
Launceston, from London, and was formally inducted. His pastorate has been
acceptable, and over one hundred members have been added to the church during
the first twelve months. A sum of not less than £15,000 has been expended by
Mr. and Mrs. Reed in erecting the buildings and providing for the work. At the
present time the annual expenses in connection with the work are defrayed by the
free-will offerings of the people, assisted by Mrs. Reed, A Rescue Home has
recently been established, which is accomplishing much good ; and an open-air
service is held every pleasant Sunday afternoon on a hill on the outskirts of the
town, at which the attendance varies from two to fifteen hundred.
WORKING MEN’S CLUB, LAUNCESTON.
The Working Men’s Club, as its name denotes, is an institution established for the
working men of Launceston, and embraces among its members artisans, clerks, and
labourers. It was established in 1865, the first meetings being held in a house in


Patterson Street, but these quarters being too small, rooms were secured on Charles
Street. The promoters of the club were the Hon. Adye Douglas, Yen Archdeacon
Hales, and Messrs J. J. Hudson, Jas. Wallace, John Eichards, and the late
Mr. E. Ure. In 1869 a lot was purchased on Elizabeth Street, and work was
commenced on the present building, the necessary funds being subscribed by
the members and their friends, assisted by Mr. W. A. Guesdon, now of Clapham,
London, England, who in 1870 gave the munificent sum of £1250 to the club. The
club-house was completed in 1871, at a cost, including fittings, furniture, &c.,
of over £2OOO, the object of the institution being to provide a place of resort
for working men where recreation and instruction can be provided free from the
temptations of intoxicating drink; the club is therefore run on temperance
principles. The building contains two billiard rooms, a reading room and library,
and eight other rooms used for various purposes. A well-selected library, consisting
of 1600 volumes, is to be found on the shelves, and the library table is supplied
with local, English, colonial and foreign newspapers. The entrance fee is 6d ,
with a subscription of 3d. per week, which entitles a member to all the privileges
of the club, which is entirely self-supporting, and is managed by a committee elected
annually. The club rooms are available to members from 9 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. ; and
though various games are permitted and encouraged, gambling in any form is
strictly prohibited by the rules. The officers for 1887-8 are Hon. Adye Douglas
(President,) T. J. Holmes (Vice-President,) C. K- Ellis (Secretary,) John Ellis
(Treasurer,) and a committee of eighteen members. The annual income from all
sources is in the neighbourhood of £270, and the present membership 150. The
Launceston Savings, Investment and Building Society, which sprang from this
institution, was organised in 1867. The weekly meetings for the purpose of
receiving the payment of subscriptions are held in one of the rooms of the club,
but all other business is transacted at the office of the secretary, Mr. Alex. Fowler.
This institution has at present 489 shareholders, holding 2795 shares at £ls per
share.
INTEENATIONAL HOTEL, LAUNCESTON.
G. W. Barber, Proprietor.
This building was erected by James Robinson in tlie year 1857, where he
conducted the wholesale wine and spirit business; but two years after it was
remodelled into a hotel, and rented to Thomas Cocker, who was the proprietor
until 1871, when he sold out to Mr. Cleary. Mr. Cleary administered to the wants
of the public for seven or eight years, when the property was purchased by
W. J. Thrower, who, after continuing the business for a few years, sold out to


iNTEjurarioKAL Hotel
Launceston




Mr. Sharp. The lease having expired in the year 1868, the property was sold to the
present proprietor, Mr. G. W. Barber, who was for many years owner of the Latrobe
Hotel, Latrobe, and is therefore well acquainted with the wants of the Tasmanian,
as well as Australian, public. Within the first few months after the purchase of
the property, Mr. Barber made extensive alterations at an expenditure of over
£l*2oo. First, the front of the building was altered by the addition of doors and
windows of the latest pattern, and the entire floor was lowered to a level with the
footpath of the street. Directly over the main entrance a room, which was formerly
used as an auction mart, has been converted into a large and commodious
dining hall, which will comfortably seat seventy people. Adjoining and fronting on
Brisbane Street is a suite of four rooms, which can be occupied respectively as a,
dining room, drawing room, bed and dressing room. These are all elegantly
furnished with new furniture of the latest design ; and here families may feel the
same privacy as at home. The building surrounds an open court, with a wide
balcony for a promenade ; nearly all the bedrooms open upon this balcony, which
assures perfect ventilation. When desired, this court can be illuminated. A broad
staircase connects the two storeys, which was recently built by Mr. Barber. On the
ground floor may be mentioned a smoking and billiard room, and one of the largest
and best fitted bars in the colony. The hotel will comfortably accommodate fifty
people; and as there are five large sample rooms, the wants of the commercial
travellers are amply provided for.
TASMANIAN TIN-SMELTING COMPANY, LAUNCESTON.
The company was organised in 1877 for the purpose of smelting ore from the east
and north-east coast of the colony, the purity of which may be estimated from the
fact that from a given amount of ore from 65 to 75 per cent, of tin is produced, or
an average of a little over 72 per cent. This product is shipped to the London
market. The ore is brought from the mine to the works in bags in a pulverised
state ready for reduction in the furnaces. There are three furnaces, each of which
is capable of receiving a charge of 50 cwt. of ore every eight hours, making a total
production of 185 tons per week. Mr. Robert Gardiner is the local representative,
and Mr. G. J. Latta the manager and assayer.
THE LAUNCESTON DAILY TELEGRAPH.
In July, 1881, a small bi-weekly paper. The Telegraph, was issued in Launceston
by Messrs. Mowbray, Barnes and Co. This was continued for about six months,


when the printing plant was purchased by Mr. James Brickhill, who increased the
size of The Telegraph and issued it tri-weekly. It became improved in tone, and its
circulation was soon considerably increased, as public opinion in Launceston had
for some two years been represented by only one newspaper. It became a good
advertising medium, and being well patronised the proprietor was encouraged to
extend its usefulness. He had secured very suitable central premises, in which the
defunct Cornwall Chronicle had been printed. He purchased improved printing
presses and machinery, largely increased his literary and mechanical staff, and on
the 18th June, 1883 (the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo,) sent forth the first
issue of the Daily Telegraph. The enterprise of the proprietor was promptly
rewarded ; in a few weeks the subscription list of the daily increased to 4500, a
circulation far beyond that of any newspaper previously published in Tasmania. Its
columns were supplied with the latest and most interesting telegraphic news from
the adjoining colonies, from Europe, India, and all parts of the world. Its political
views were approved by the people, its correspondents in this and the adjoining
colonies, and in Europe, were numerous, intelligent, able and reliable ; and its
position as a popular leader of public opinion, and also as a sound commercial
speculation, became assured. It was the first newspaper published in Tasmania at
a penny, and no doubt this aided largely in the success of its circulation. It was
recognised as the best advertising medium in the colony, and patronised accordingly.
This encouraged the proprietor to enlarge his printing premises, and these were
doubled in size by raising them another storey and by additions in the rear, until
they became the most convenient and compact, though not the largest, in the colony.
With the increase of population, and consequent steady increase of subscribers,
the proprietor was enabled to add to his expenditure for further extending the
attractions which have thus ensured the popularity and stability of the Daily
Telegraph . Throughout its career the journal has always favoured the policy
enunciated by representative men of intelligence and progress, as opposed to that
of those whose interests or narrow views sway them on the side of mere stagnation
and the depressing policy of “ waiting for something to turn up.” The Daily
Telegraph is an honest advocate for the reform of abuses, the maintenance of the
political, civil, and religious rights of the people, and for the furtherance of the
material and moral welfare of the whole community. Triumphant its career, it has
pursued a scrupulously consistent course.
LAUNCESTON SAYINGS BANK.
In the early part of the year 1835 a meeting was called of the most influential
gentlemen of Launceston for the purpose of establishing a bank for savings, the




Congregational Church, Princes Square .


object being to encourage industry and frugality among the working classes of the
community, and to offer a secure mode of investing their savings, with interest
thereon, leaving them at liberty to withdraw the whole or part at any time they
may require. Several meetings were held, and at length, the rules having been
drawn up and agreed to, and trustees appointed, the institution was considered
established, and active operations commenced. Mr. J. Sherwin was appointed the
first manager (afterwards called actuary,) in December, 1843. Before the expiration
of one year Mr. Sherwin resigned his position, and Mr. Henry Dowling was
appointed in his place. The same year the trustees felt the urgent need of legisla-
tion relating to savings banks in the colony. After a correspondence with the
Government, an Act was obtained in 1849 to give protection to banks for savings.
This Act provides that such institutions shall be under the control of not less than
ten nor more than thirty managers, who are appointed by a general court of quarter
sessions for the peace. The deposits must be invested in approved real estate
security, situated in Tasmania, or in debentures guaranteed by Government. A
statement of the liabilities and assets of the savings banks is published half-yearly
in the Government Gazette. In 1868 Mr. Dowling resigned, and Mr. George Pullen,
who had been accountant in the bank during the preceding fifteen years, was
appointed actuary in September of that year, which position he held for nineteen
years The progressive character of the bank may be seen from the following
table ; —ln 1836, balance to credit of depositors was £560 17s. 2d; in 1855 this
balance was increased to £89,314 15s. Bd.; and in 1887 to £126,708 10s. lid. The
reserved fund for the same year was £11,724 12s. Number of accounts now open,
8423. In September, 1887, Mr. George Pullen resigned on account of ill-health,
much to the regret of the Board of Management, and Mr. J. Cathcart, who had been
connected with the Commercial Bank for over thirty-two years, was appointed
actuary.
PRINCESS SQUARE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, LAUNCESTON.
In the year 1838 the Rev. John West came to Tasmania, under the auspices of the
Colonial Missionary Society, but the following year circumstances arose which led
him to settle in Launceston. The church was formed at a meeting held in June,
1840, and the Rev. Mr. West was called to the pastorate. A rented building in
Frederick Street, near the present site, was selected as a temporary place for
worship ; but the foundation-stone for the church (now Milton Hall) was laid by
the Rev. Henry Dowling, in the year 1841, and the dedication service was held on
the 12th of August of the following year. The total cost of the property, including
the land on which the church was built, was £1652, and this sum was paid by the


freewill offerings of the congregation. In the year 1854 the Rev. John West, after
repeated solicitations, resigned his pastorate to accept the editorship of the Sydney
Morning Herald, and was connected with that journal until his death, which
occurred in December, 1873. Aside from his ministerial labours Mr. West rendered
valuable service to the colony as the foremost founder and advocate of the Austia-
lasian League for the Abolition of the Transportation of Convicts to the Colonies.
The present pastor, the Rev. Wm. Caw, who, during the three preceding years,
was a missionary to the Navigator Islands, accepted the call to the church, and was
recognised previous to the departure of the Rev. Mr. West. In 1858 the church
building was lengthened, repairs were made, and as years went by various improve-
ments were effected, and in 1875 a new organ was placed in the church at a cost of
over £SOO. As early as 1881 the necessity for the erection of a new church edifice
was evident to the congregation, and a meeting was convened in July of that year,
on which occasion a building committee was appointed and the sum of £ll9O was
subscribed. A lot was secured adjoining the existing structure, and the foundation-
stone of the new church, known as Christ Church, was laid on the Bth of March,
1883, by the pastor, assisted by the three surviving members of the original church.
The same year the Rev. Wm, Caw paid a visit to England, and while there collected
a large sum towards the building fund. Owing to various detentions the church
edifice was not completed until October, 1885 ; the farewell services being held in
the old church on Saturday, the 18th, when services were preached by the pastor
to large congregations. The dedication services of the new church were held on
the 20th, both afternoon and evening; the sermons on the latter occasion were
delivered by the Rev. Chas. Price, of Launceston, the senior Congregational minister
of Australasia. The total cost of the church building, including the site, amounted
to the sum of £9OOO, which has all been paid, with the exception of an overdraft of
£2OOO, which debt it is expected will all be wiped out by June, 1890, which will be
the jubilee year of the church. On the 15th of April, 1887, the building committee
gave in their final report and were discharged.
MOUNT BISCHOFF TIN MINING COMPANY’S SMELTING WORKS.
These works were first opened in January, 1875, on the present site at Launceston,
for the purpose of smelting ore from the Mount Bischoff Tin Mine; but at the
present time nearly 30 per cent, of the 35,000 tons of ore already treated are
from other mines in the colony. The ore is brought from the mine to the
works in 1-cwt. bags in a pulverised state ready for reduction in the furnaces.
Tin oxide is necessarily mixed with a certain percentage of carbon, and small coal


is the most convenient form, which is used in proportion to the quality of ore
treated. The average amount of tin from a given quantity of No. 1 ore from Mount
Bischoff Mine is 72 per cent. About 120 tons of the product are consumed in the
Australasian Colonies per annum, and between eighteen and nineteen hundred tons
are annually shipped to London. Mr. W. C. Jenkin, Superintendent and
Metallurgist of the Company, has been connected with the works since the start in
1875, at which date the first ton of ore was smelted in Tasmania. Mr. Jenkin had
been previously connected with smelting works on the Continent of Europe, and
afterwards was assayist and superintendent of works in Chili, and Sydney New
South Wales.
ANGLICAN CHURCH, NORTHERN TASMANIA.
In the eaily days of the colony only three religious denominations were recognised
by the State—the Church of England, the Roman Catholic, and Scotch. & The
clergy of the first-named body were appointed by the Crown, at the rate of £2OO per
yeai with extra allowances. In 1842 the diocese of Tasmania was created, the
fiist Bishop, Dr. Nixon, as well as Dr. Bromby, who also assumed the Episcopal
chair, having been appointed by the Secretary of State of the Imperial Cabinet.
Consequent, however, on the judicial decisions given in the case of the South
African Church, this minister refused to make any fresh appointments on a vacancy
arising through the resignation of Dr. Bromby, and the present Bishop, the Rev. Dr.
Sanford, was therefore nominated by a committee of English bishops appointed by
the Synod, and subsequently inducted to the See. The Synod was instituted in
1857, and its actions were legalised by an Act of Parliament in 1858. It consisted
of the Bishop, licensed clergy, and fifty-four lay representatives from the several
parishes in the island, who are elected for a term of three years. Each Act of the
Synod must be forwarded to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and may be disallowed
by the Queen within two years. The appointments to the cure of parishes are of a
very simple nature, being either made by the Bishop or a council of patronage,
the latter consisting of an archdeacon, six members of the Synod appointed by
that body, the lay representatives, and three communicants elected by the
parish. Every parish has one or more Sunday schools; and where ordained
ministers cannot be supplied, lay readers are appointed. There are two Grammar
schools in connection with the Church—one in Launceston and the other in
Hobart—which are doing good work, many of the pupils having won distinguished
honours alike in the British and Colonial Universities. There are three parishes
in Launceston—Holy Trinity, St. John, and St. Paul, the former two being of
ancient date, the latter of recent creation. Trinity has a glebe producing an annual


income verging upon £4OO. A former parishioner also bequeathed property
amounting in the aggregate to about £4OOO. The existing church is an old one,
having been erected in 1842 ; and a fund has recently been established, which now
amounts to £BSO, with a view of erecting a new church in the place of the present
edifice, since, owing to its age, it is in an unsatisfactory condition. The present
incumbent is the Yen. Archdeacon Hales, who is assisted by the Rev C. Young.
The glebe attached to St. John’s Church yields at present a yearly rental of £340.
The church and parsonage stand in extensive grounds overlooking Princess Square,
and are tastefully laid out. The late incumbent, the Rev. Canon Brownrigg, after
presiding over the parish for a period of eighteen years, was obliged, owing to
failing health, to resign the cure in the early part of the year 1887, and in the same
year the Rev. E, Champion, formerly of the North Coast of Tasmania, was inducted
to the charge. St. Paul’s Church is a pretty wooden structure located in the
southern part of the town, and is in close proximity to the hospital, the present
incumbent being the Rev, A. Barkway, who has presided over the parish lor the
past thirty years.
LAUNCESTON COFFEE PALACE.
In 1881 Coffee Palaces first became popular in Australia, and were patronised by
that large class of people who desire a quiet temporary home where no intoxicating
drinks are sold. In 1882 Mr. S. Sutton erected, at a cost of nearly £12,000, the
Launceston Coffee Palace, located on the present site in Brisbane Street, Launceston.
The building is a three-storey brick structure, cemented in imitation of stone,
is surmounted by a handsome tower, and is, both on account of its size and the
beauty of the architecture, an ornament to the city. The dining room is on the
ground floor, 44ft. x 40ft, and is capable of comfortably seating 120 people, it being
the largest dining room in the colony. There is also a ladies’ sitting room and
a gentlemen’s smoking room on either side of the main hall, and a billiard room,
23ft. x 42ft., in the rear, which is furnished with two new tables. The second and
third floors are divided into sleeping apartments ; and there are two private parlours,
connecting with suites of sleeping rooms. The bathrooms on each floor are supplied
with hot and cold water, and the proprietor has spared no expense to provide for
the comfort of his guests. Tasmania is the great summer resort for the Australians,
and Launceston, on account of the many picturesque places of interest in the
vicinity, is the favourite rendezvous for visitors to the northern portion of the
island. Mr. Sutton, the proprietor of the Coffee Palace, is always prepared to
furnish intending guests with full information in regard to the city and the many
delightful places of interest in the neighbourhood.

G-9 NixonStewart


GEORGE NIXON STEWART
Was born in Castle Place, Belfast, Ireland, on Bth May, 1818, and was the only
son of Alexander Nixon Stewart, merchant, who died in 1823. Mrs. Stewart
married in the following year Mr, William Joyce. Captain Nixon, her brother-in-
law, and an officer who had fought at Waterloo, adopted the subject of this sketch,
and took him to reside at Newtownards, a village distant from Belfast eight miles.
Young Stewart received the best part of his education at the Collegiate School, in
the diocese of Raphoe, where Isaac Butt, subsequently known as the “ Father of
Home Rule,” and he were schoolmates. Captain Nixon, after having discharged
the onerous duty of Inspector of Police in different parts of Ireland, was obliged
to remove, owing to ill-health, to a warmer climate. Meanwhile his nephew had
been placed with Councillor Hercules Nixon, in Hardwick Square, Dublin, for the
purpose of being trained as a lawyer; but Mr. Nixon having entered Parliament
and removed to London, George joined his uncle, Captain Nixon, who was daily
failing in health, and eventually died at Boulogne. Having been advised by his
uncle to emigrate to New South Wales or Van Diemen’s Land, he, acting on this
advice, in 1840 reached Hobart Town and having placed his money, £250, in
the hands of Dr. Crooke, obtained a situation in the Colonial Times office as
accountant. In 1849 he was appointed temporary clerk in the Commissariat
Department at Launceston, which, although once a very extensive one, had been
reduced, until only Assistant Commissary General Swan, Mr. John Windeath, and
Mr. Stewart remained to perform the duties for all Northern Tasmania. In 1851
Mr. Stewart married Mary Ann, eldest daughter of Mr. William Wliitaker, who
at the time was acting as locum tenens at New Norfolk for the Wesleyan minister
at that station. The Commissariat Department at Launceston having been abolished
in 1853, he joined the staff of the Cornwall Chronicle as reporter. On the death of
Mr. William Lushington Goodwin, the proprietor, the paper passed into the hands
of Messrs. M. L. Goodwin and D’Arcy W. L. Murray. It was then sold to Messrs.
Robert Harris and T. C. Just, and, after a chequered career of forty-five years, it
became defunct in 1880. During a quarter of a century Mr. Stewart had the chief
literary management of the paper, it being a first-class journal when financially it
failed. On 26th July, 1880, a meeting was held in the Town Hall, Launceston,
when Mr. Adye Douglas, the Mayor, presented Mr. Stewart, on behalf of a large
number of colonists, with a handsomely illuminated address, which alluded in
flattering terms to his efforts, as a pressman, in endeavouring to further the interests
of the colony by the aid of his pen. The address was signed by Messrs. W. T. Bell,
J H Smith, John Denning, George Pullen, and John Ellis, on behalf of some
two hundred inhabitants, and was accompanied by a puise containing one hundred
D


sovereigns. Mr. Stewart, though deeply affected by the expression of such kindly
sentiments, replied at some length. In conclusion he said, that to find the addiess
so numerously signed by gentlemen of all shades of political opinion, many of
whom necessarily differed from the views set forth in the newspaper he had foi so
many years conducted, almost uncontrolled, constituted, in his mind, the highest
honour ever paid during his career to any journalist in Tasmania. With regaid to
their wishes as to his being yet of some service, he assured them that whatever
health and strength might be given him would be employed as earnestly as ever in
defence of “The Rights of the People,” that being the motto on the banner under
which he had fought so long.
Mr. Stewart had been too actively employed to remain long idle. He was
soon engaged in the office of the Chief Commissioner of Mines, Mr. Bernard Shaw,
and, after that, in the Lands Titles Department, until he became editor of the Daily
Telegraph. After his accession the paper was issued on and since the 18th June,
1883, as the Daily Telegraph , and it rapidly became the most popular paper, it
having a circulation double that of any other newspaper in the colony. Towards
the end of 1886 Mr. Stewart’s health began to fail; but though his friends wished
him to retire from his active position as editor, he was firm in his determination to
continue as long as possible. He remained at his post, notwithstanding that for
the last few months great pain and weakness afflicted him, till the 27th of May,
about a fortnight over his seventieth birthday, when he was obliged to yield, and,
after much suffering, passed gently away at two o’clock on Wednesday morning, Ist
June, surrounded by those nearest and dearest to him.
Mr. George Stewart left a family of three daughters and two sons to mourn
their loss, the two sons being Messrs. F. and W. Stewart, of Charles Street, Laun-
ceston, who are importers of watches, clocks, jewellery, electro-plate, optical goods,
and many other articles.
HON. JOHN SCOTT.
The history of every individual’s life in the Southern Hemisphere is one of toil,
and in many instances of disappointment. Difficulties, if a man desires to succeed,
must be encountered and overcome, which are considerably minimised in older
countries; and one of the causes is that young countries, like young children, are
extremely arrogant. Consequently, it follows that a man of taste and culture,
when obliged to come into contact with this phase of what is erroneously called


■ ... ,

life, resents any attempt to thrust upon him what others may fancy is right. Now
the history of Tasmania bears out this assertion to the letter, inasmuch as men
have died fighting against what was unreasonable, and contrary to common-sense.
But let us pause ; common-sense has been proved, on more than one occasion, to
be non-sense. Common-sense, —it is an unfortunate circumstance that the word
ever came to be used, since, when it is analysed, it really has no effective meaning,
—once murdered a Man who was the highest type of Humanity; common-sense
has caused innocent persons to undergo the most exquisite suffering; and common-
sense—we take it, it was consensus —declared the world stood still. Common-sense,
therefore, means very little, unless backed up by experience; in fact, unless expe-
rience be the foundation. It was only men of experience who could have succeeded
in securing to Tasmania the privileges she now enjoys ; and amongst them may be
mentioned the name of John Scott, who was born in Hobart Town on 29th
August, 1829, but removed to Launceston at an early age. In 1839 he sailed with
his people to Port Phillip (now Melbourne,) where he remained until 1844, when
he returned to Launceston, and was apprenticed to a brewer in the town. The
gold fever of 1852 in Victoria induced him, in common with other Tasmanians, to
seek his fortune in new fields of labour; but, after a sojourn there of three months,
during which time he collected three and a half ounces of gold, he came to the
conclusion that mining was not his vocation, and wisely returned to Tasmania. In
1855 Mr. Scott built his brewery, and laid the foundation of the business of which
he is now the head. In 1860 he originated the first Volunteer corps in the colony.
Previous to that date Tasmania was dependent for her defence on the soldiery
furnished by the English Government; but in 1858 a Bill was passed through the
Legislature, at the instigation of Mr. Scott and others, granting the power to
organise a Volunteer force, and Mr. Scott was elected as the first Volunteer captain
in the island. In 1861 he was one of the aldermen of Launceston, and was elected
Mayor of the city from 1867 to 1868, and it was during his term of office that
H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh paid a visit to Tasmania. In 1865 he was elected
a member of Parliament for George Town, and in 1866 was returned to represent
Launceston, but, owing to the dissolution of Parliament, he retired in 1871, refusing
to serve for a longer term. After a period of nine years, Mr. Scott consented to
stand again, and in 1880 was elected member of the Legislative Council for Tama
(now Launceston.) His re-election for Launceston, in 1886, was considered a great
compliment, inasmuch as he was ill during the previous term, and unable to attend
fully to the duties of the office. Mr. Scott was one who strongly supported the
introduction of railways in the colony. In 1865, Parliament having made it a
sine qua non that those who were in favour of having the railways in Tasmania
should prove their sincerity in the matter by subscribing £50.000, Mr. Scott was
one of the first who subscribed, and paid his proportion of £IOOO. He was opposed
to the purchase of the Main Line Railway from a private company by the Govern-


ment for £1,000,000, at 3J per cent., believing that the original cost for the con-
struction of the line did not exceed £600,000, and that it was a useless expenditure
of the people’s money. Mr. Scott is a Conservative in politics, and is inclined
toward Protection, feeling that in a new country local industries should be fostered.
He is a magistrate for the territory, and was appointed one of the Commissioners
for the International Exhibition which was held in Melbourne from 1880 to 1881.
He can claim to be the oldest living brewer in Tasmania, and has gained by his
conduct throughout life the respect of the Tasmanians, Men like this gentleman
foster the industries of a country, and it is to the examples of such men that the
rising generations of the Australian group must look for guidance.
LAUNCESTON HOTEL. LAUNCESTON.
In the old coaching days of Tasmania the arrival of the Hobart mail coach in Laun-
ceston was the event of the day. The headquarters for the coach was at the
Launceston Hotel, which then, as now, is located in the business centre of the
town. The hotel was built by Mr. Richard White in 1835, who was the first pro-
prietor. It, like all the early structures of the town, was built of wood; but, as
time went on, the premises were pulled down and a brick building erected. The
present owner and proprietor is Mr. J. Huston, who has been engaged in the hotel
business for over thirty jears in the Australian colonies, and purchased the property
alluded to in June, 1886. In order to meet the requirements of an increasing
business, Mr. Huston immediately set about making additions and alterations.. We
may mention that these consist chiefly of a three-storey addition, which contains, on
the ground floor, a large and commodious dining hall, the first and second floors
being divided into sleeping apartments. In the main body of the building, on
the ground floor, are two commercial rooms, a gentleman’s parlour, and a well fitted
bar, and billiard room adjoining. The storeys above are divided into suites of rooms
for families, as the hotel is patronised by that large number of European and Conti-
nental tourists who come to Tasmania during the summer months. As it is the
aim of the proprietor, Mr. Huston, to make it in every respect a family hotel, he
has therefore introduced all the modern improvements, including hot and cold water,
well arranged bathrooms, &c, and tourists may feel assured that their comfort will
be studied. The hotel surrounds an open court with a cement floor, and a row of
Tasmanian fern trees in the centre, which gives to it the appearance of a garden.

JAMES BRICKHILL.
A great difference of opinion, and, in some instances, a very heated and angry
discussion, has arisen as to whom the honour of having invented the art of printing
is due. Some authors attribute it to Coster, of Haarlaem; others to Gutenberg of
Mentz, while a few assert that it was introduced by the Venetians, from China,
where it had been practised for nearly two thousand years. It would appear that
the art was known for some time previous to 1441, in Venice, where a decree was
issued in that year relating to printing. On the other hand, it would seem that it
was invented in Europe in 1440. Among the earliest specimens of printing extant,
is an exhortation to take up arms against the Turks in 1454. In the beginning of
the art each page was engraved on a block of wood, but soon movable types were
introduced. Impressions of the former kind pass under the name of block books.
If the intellectual condition of a country is to be estimated by the literary activity
displayed in the publication of books, Venice, at the close of the fifteenth century,
must be allowed to take the lead, and Italy was as far advanced intellectually in
1400 as England in 1500. It is a mistake to suppose that in very early times the
methods and advantages of printing were unknown, for every Babylonish brick and
signet ring contradicts that opinion. Gradually the system of information passing
from mouth to mouth, and not from eye to eye, ceased; but when there were more
readers, an increased demand gave origin to an increased supply. It may not
generally be known that the paper first made in Europe was manufactured by the
Spanish Moors from the fine flax of Valentia and Mercia. Dismissing this
interesting subject, we must pass on to the time when newspapers first made their
appearance. Venice, during the Turkish war in 1563, published newspapers which
were in manuscript; and, although there are copies of English newspapers in the
British Museum reputed to have been published during the excitement of the
Spanish Armada, it was not actually until the civil wars that newspapers can be
said to have been fairly established in that country. As everyone well knows, it
was printing that gave a great impetus to the progress of the Reformation. Passing
over a great gulf of time, we come to the close of the seventeeth century, when no
man was allowed to publish political news unless he had been duly authorised by
the Crown. Newspapers were, however, beginning to be periodically issued, and
newsletters were written by enterprising persons in the metropolis and sent to the
rich who subscribed for them. They then circulated from family to family. The
information was picked up in the coffee houses, which were great places for political
and social gossip. By degrees the liberty of the Press was secured. In England,
at first, it was subjected to the common law, and offenders could be punished with,


if the judges so determined, the extreme penalty of the law. But “nous avons
chang6 tout cela” as a jury must now decide on the offensive character of the
publication.
The Press in Australasia, as elsewhere, is a powerful moulder of public
opinion, and deservedly holds a prominent position. For a new country, with the
difficulties and expense attending the collection of the interesting events of the
day, the newspapers in the colonies have called forth the admiration of the
experienced journalists of Europe and Great Britain. To every class of reader it
has become an absolute necessity, while to a very large majority of the Anglo-Saxon
race it constitutes half the matitutinal meal, as the breakfast would be incomplete
without it. To the enterprise and foresight of the proprietors of the numerous
newspapers published in the colonies is due the influence which journalism wields
in the southern hemisphere, as a strict regard to respectability is jealously observed,
and the most sensitive individual need not hesitate to take up the sheet which lies
on the dining room table or is found in the drawing room. Hundreds of villages in
England very much larger than many of the towns in the colonies are strangers to
the “ local print” which almost every little township in Australasia possesses, while
in the more important places there are several daily and weekly issues.
The flourishing town of Launceston, Tasmania, enjoys the privilege of number-
ing among its journals the Daily Telegraph, of which Mr. James Brickhill is pro-
prietor. This gentleman is a native of Launceston, and was born on 20th September,
1846, his father being Mr. John Brickhill, a retired Government official, who
emigrated to Tasmania in the early days of the colony, about forty-five years ago.
James Brickhill has accordingly spent his whole lifetime in Launceston, and has grown
up with the place and the people. After receiving a moderate education, which was
in those days much more difficult to obtain than a first-class one is now, he chose
the printing business as his profession, and was apprenticed to the proprietors of
the Launceston Examiner in the latter part of the year 1862. After having served
his apprenticeship he continued in the employment of the firm until December,
1881, during which period he filled a variety of positions —from office boy to
accountant —with satisfaction to his employers and credit to himself. In 1879,
consequent on an arrangement with the firm, he resigned his position as accountant,
and engaged successfully in the outdoor work, which consisted of collecting the
accounts, canvassing for printing and advertising, and numerous other duties.
During this period he also undertook commission work for other firms, having an
office of his own, and having several insurance and other agencies. Official changes
in the Launceston Examiner caused him to resign in 1881, his connection with the
paper ceasing at the end of the year. In July, 1881, a small bi-w.eekly paper, named
The Telegraph , was started in Launceston by Messrs. Mowbray, Barnes and
Stephens, but the combination not working harmoniously, a dissolution of partner-
ship took place at the end of the year.


A. printer named Bell having purchased one of the interests in the concern,
the books were handed to Mr. Brickhill for examination and adjustment; and it
was this circumstance which led to a partnership between these two gentlemen, the
paper reappearing, still as a bi-weekly, under the auspices of the new firm on 12th
January, 1882. Shortly afterwards The Telegraph was increased in size, and issued
as a tri-weekly. The business capacities of Mr. Brickhill, as one of the firm, inspired
the public with confidence in the venture, which very rapidly increased in circu-
lation and general printing business. Three months afterwards it was found
advisable to dissolve partnership, whereupon a dispute arose which was decided
by arbitration in favour of Mr. Brickhill, who acquired by purchase his partner’s
interest. This circumstance gave increased confidence in the paper, which now
showed marked signs of improvement. Hitherto the business had been carried on
in a most unsuitable building in George Street; but an opportunity presenting itself,
the present building in Paterson Street was secured by purchase, together with a
large quantity of printing plant, which formerly belonged to the extinct Cornwall
Chronicle. A complete jobbing plant was then added, and first-class tradesmen
having been employed, the business still further increased. During the early part
of the year 1883 several influential gentlemen were anxious that the paper should
appear daily ; and, with a view to realise their wishes, a substantial offer of pecuniary
assistance was made. Mr. Brickhill, who had hesitated to issue the paper daily,
owing to his financial position not being strong enough to meet the strain, was
prevailed on, through representations made to him of the urgent demand for a
second daily paper in Launceston, and the guarantee of a sufficient sum of money,
to yield to the wishes of the public. Accordingly the paper appeared as a daily on
18th June, 1883, and was a very marked success. In 1885 the business had
increased to such an extent that the building had to be enlarged by the addition of
another storey. This was done whilst the business was going on, though of course
under considerable difficulty; but the master mind of the proprietor continued to
arrange matters in such a manner as to reduce the discomfort to a minimum. It
may be interesting to mention that the history of the Brickhill family shows that
many of them have held positions for lengthened periods of time. The grandfather
of Mr. Brickhill was an English excise officer for nearly half a century, and his
father was employed in the Launceston Post Office for quite forty years, while a
brother, who died in 1874 at the age of thirty-two, occupied a position in a leading
solicitor’s office in the same town for sixteen years. There was also an uncle, who
emigrated to the Cape about the same time as his father landed in Tasmania, and
became connected with the Natal Bank, working his way up to the manager’s
position, and retiring after a service of nearly fifty years.
Early in life Mr. Brickhill, having recognised the good work done by the
Friendly Societies, became a member of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, and
afterwards, having adopted total abstinence principles, joined the Independent


Order of Recliabites, filling the chair in both societies, and otherwise doing useful
work. Mr. Brickhill, though of an unobtrusive and retiring disposition, possesses
a large amount of enterprise, backed up by great perseverance ; and it is through
these attributes that his success in life is mainly due. He has had to make his own
way in the world, and having married when young, was obliged to maintain and
educate a large family. His time has been too much occupied by business matters
to admit of his taking an active part in public affairs, though repeatedly urged so to
do; but, owing to his position as a newspaper proprietor, he has wisely observed a
neutral course, this step leaving the paper entirely independent in dealing with
matters affecting the body politic.
A. T. PILLINGER, M.H.A.
Mr. Alfred T. Pillinger, Member of the House of Assembly, Tasmania, was
born at Oaklands, Tasmania. He is the second son of James Pillinger, Esq., of
Tasmania. The subject of this sketch received his education in the colony, devoting
much of his time to the study of Economic problems relating to the welfare and
advancement of the people. He has been principally connected with pastoral
pursuits. On the 17th July, 1876, he was elected a Member of the House of
Assembly, and re-elected in 1877, 1882, and 1886. Mr. Pillinger is a coroner and
magistrate for the Territory, being also a councillor for Oaklands Municipality. He
is a trustee of Oaklands, and chairman of the Great Lake Road Distiict. For
three years he was Warden of Oaklands Municipality, 1874-6. In 1886 he married
the eldest daughter of George Nicholls, of Castara, Tasmania. Mr. Pillinger has
proved a painstaking and zealous member of the Assembly, who looks with exceed-
ing care after the best interests of his electorate \ being, at the same time, mindful
of the general wants of the colony.
As a native, he fully understands the wants of Tasmania, and the influences
which tend to retard her growth and development. His aim has ever been to
remove, by wise legislation, such causes, and to place upon the Statute Book
measures calculated to increase the area of land devoted to agricultural pursuits.
In the mineral wealth of the island he sees a storehouse, from which, in time, will
be drawn factors of the greatest importance to all citizens of the State.


THE TASMANIAN ABORIGINES.
James Fenton, Esq.
The early records of British settlement in Tasmania present many dark pages,
which make one shudder at the cruelty and barbarity of a people who raised
the “ meteor flag of England,” and occupied the island in the name of
civilisation. The darkest page of all is that which tells of the troubles and
the final extinction of the aboriginal inhabitants of the country. When
European navigators first visited the island the natives were found to be a
quiet, cheerful, inoffensive race, ignorant to an extreme of the arts which
elevate mankind, but so contented in their patriarchal habits that the sug-
gestive sentiment of the poet Gray seems to have suited their condition—
“lf ignorance is bliss, ’tis folly to be wise.” It will be seen, as we proceed,
that the innocent and confiding nature of the blacks, as shown in their first
interviews with the whites, led them into many snares, until indescribable
cruelty made them treacherous and vindictive ; and, at last, when every hope
of holding their hunting grounds and maintaining their tribal independence had
vanished, they gave themselves up to despair, fell into all the vices their
conquerors had introduced, and faded away, until, at length, the entire race
became extinct.
Before Tasmania was occupied by the English in 1803, the aboriginal
inhabitants were supposed to number from five to seven thousand ; but it was
impossible to form an accurate estimate at that time, or for years after, as
many of the tribes inhabited districts which were comparatively unknown.
The natives with whom the French and British navigators came in contact
before the settlement was formed, were exceedingly docile and tractable, as
will be seen from the narratives of these voyagers. Tasman, in 1642,
saw no natives, but he observed smoke along the coast in several
places, and concluded that the island was inhabited. One hundred and thirty
years passed away since Tasman discovered the island before it was again
visited by Europeans, and then a French expedition, under command of
Captain Marion du Fresne, consisting of two ships, the “ Mascarin ” and
Castries,” anchored in a bay off 1 Forestier’s Peninsula on the east coast,
south of Maria Island. The natives came with confidence down to the
boats, and remained for some time, with their children and wives, near the
strangers. The sailors distributed presents of the kind usually esteemed by
savage nations, and there was at first every prospect of a friendly intercourse;
but about an hour later the captain landed, and the interview is described
by the historian Rienzi as follows:— f ‘ Advancing in front of him, one of the


aborigines offered him a lighted firebrand, that he might set light to a heap
of wood on the shore. Marion took it, believing that it was a formality
intended to give confidence to the savages ; but hardly had the little pile of
wood been inflamed, when the aborigines retired en masse toward a little
height, from which they threw a volley of stones, which wounded the two
captains. They (the French) repelled them by several discharges of musket.
They killed one aborigine, and wounded several others, and the rest fled
howling towards the woods.” This collision was a very unfortunate affair.
It probably arose from want of discretion on the part of the French; but
during the visits which followed soon afterwards, the fullest confidence was
restored. In the following year (1773) Captain Furneaux, in the “Adventure,
entered Storm Bay, and cast anchor in a roadstead off Bruny Island, to which
he gave the name of Adventure Bay. He did not see any natives, but came
upon their fires, and found their rude dwellings, in which were a few baskets
and spears. He took these away with him, and left in return nails and
trinkets. Captain Cook was the next to visit the island. He entered
Adventure Bay with his discovery ships on 26th January, 1777. Anxious to
fall in with the natives, he went with a party of marines some miles into the
country. At length he fell in with and captured a girl, naked and alone.
Cook soon gained the confidence of his terrified captive ; he bound a
handkerchief round her neck, placed a cap on her head, and allowed her to
depart. Shortly afterwards eight men and a boy approached without fear.
Cook says in his narrative—“ They were unarmed, were quite naked, wore no
ornaments, were of middle stature, rather slender, with skin and hair black,
and the latter as woolly as the natives of New Guinea, but they were not
distinguished by remarkably thick lips or flat noses. On the contrary, their
features were far from being disagreeable. They had pretty good eyes, and
their teeth were tolerably even, but very dirty. Most of them had their hair
and beards smeared with a red ointment, and some had also had their faces
painted with the same composition.” Captain Cook had two pigs let loose
on shore, but the natives seized them, and carried them off. Another inter-
view took place with a number of females. They wore a kangaroo skin
fastened over their shoulders, by means of which the younger children were
carried on their backs, but they had no other covering. They had their
heads closely shorn —some on one side, some on the crown, others altogether.
They were indifferent to presents, and Cook noticed with satisfaction that
the women repelled the advances of the sailors with a considerable degree
of virtuous indignation. The island was not again yisited by Europeans
until 1789, the year after the colony of New South Wales had been
founded, when Lieutenant Bligh spent twelve days in Adventure Bay in
the “ Bounty.” Twelve men and eight women were seen on the beach,


who assembled to meet the strangers in a friendly manner, and a similar
interview with an old man, a young woman, and two or three children, took
place on another occasion.
But the most interesting records of the now extinct Tasmanian race, when
they "were in their undisturbed primitive condition, occur in the narrative of
M. Labillardiere, a naturalist in Admiral Bruny D’Entrecasteaux’s expedition in
the year 1792, and that of M. Peron in 1802. Labillardiere wrote long accounts
of his many interviews with the natives during a stay of several months The first
meeting is thus translated from the French naturalist’s account: —“We got ready
a few cartridges as fast as we could, and set out towards the place where we had
seen the natives. It was now only nine o’clock. We had gone but a few steps
before we met them. The men and youths were ranged in front, nearly in a
semi-circle; the women, girls, and children were a few paces behind. As their
manner did not appear to indicate any hostile design, I hesitated not to go up to
the oldest, who accepted, with a very good grace, a piece of biscuit I offered him,
of which he had seen me eat, I then held out my hand to him as a sign of friend-
ship, and had the pleasure to perceive that he comprehended my meaning very
well. He gave me his—inclining himself a little—and raising at the same time his
left foot, which he carried backward in proportion as he bent his body forward.
These motions were accompanied by a pleasing smile. My companions also advanced
up to the others, and immediately the best understanding prevailed amongst us.
They received with great joy the neckcloths which we offered them. The young
people approached nearer to us, and one of them had the generosity to give me a
few shells of the whelk kind, pierced near the middle, and strung like a necklace.
This ornament, which he called ' canlaride,’ was the only one he possessed, and he
wore it round his head. A handkerchief supplied the place of this present—
gratifying the utmost wishes of my savage, who advanced towards me that I might
tie it round his head for him, and who expressed the greatest joy as he lifted up
his hand to feel it again and again. We wore abundance of clothes, as I have
already observed, on account of the coldness of the nights ; and we bestowed the
greater part on these islanders. The women were very desirous of coming nearer
to us, and though the men made signs to them to keep at a distance, their curiosity
was ready every moment to break through all other considerations. The gradual
increase of confidence, however, that took place obtained them permission to
approach. It appeared to us very astonishing that in so high a latitude, where, at
a period of the year so little advanced as the present, we experienced the cold at
night to be pretty severe, these people did not feel the necessity of clothing
themselves. Even the women were, for the most part, entirely naked, as well as
the men. Some of them had only the shoulders, or part of the back, covered with
a kangaroo’s skin, worn with the hair next the body ; and amongst these we saw
two, each of whom had an infant at the breast. The sole garment of one was a


strip of kangaroo skin, about two inches broad, which was wrapped six or seven
times round the waist. Another had a collar of skin round the neck, and some
had a slender cord bound several times round the head. I afterwards learned that
most of these cords were fabricated from the bark of a shrub of the Spurge
family, very common in this country. I had given them several things without
requiring anything in return; but I wished to get a kangaroo s skin, when, among
the savages around us, there happened to be only a young girl who had one. When
I proposed to her to give it me in exchange for a pair of pantaloons, she lan away
to hide herself in the woods. The other natives appeared to be truly hurt at her
refusal, and called to her several times. At length she yielded to their entreaties,
and came to bring me the skin. Perhaps it was from timidity, only she could
not prevail upon herself to part with this kind of garment, in return for which she
received a pair of pantaloons; less useful to her according to the custom of ladies in
this country than the skin which served to cover the shoulders.”
Labillardiere relates a touching story of female innocence and chastity.
“ Four young girls of a party received with indifference the garments we gave
them ; and, that they might not be encumbered with a useless burden, immediately
hung them on the bushes near the path, intending, no doubt, to take them on their
return. ... We lost much by not understanding the language of these natives,
for one of the girls said a great deal to us ; she talked a long time with
extraordinary volubility, though she must have perceived that we could not
understand her meaning ; no matter, she must talk. The others attempted more
than once to charm us by their songs, with the modulation of which I was
singularly struck from the great analogy of the tunes to those of the Arabs in Asia
Minor. Several times two sang the same tune at once, but always a third above
the other, forming a concord of the greatest exactness. Soon after we reached the
entrance of the port, two of the girls followed the different windings of the shore
without mistrust, at a distance from the other natives, with three of our sailors,
who took the opportunity to treat them with a degree of freedom, which was
received in a very different manner from what they had hoped. The young women
immediately flew to the rocks projecting into the sea, and appeared ready to leap
into the water and swim away if our men had followed them.”
Ten years after the visit of the French discovery ships, under command of
D’Entrecasteaux, another French expedition, consisting of two ships and a corvette,
under command of Commodore Baradin, anchored off Port Cygnet, near the
entrance to D’Entrecasteaux’s Channel, on 13th January, 1802. There were several
scientific gentlemen with this expedition, including M. Peron, who published a
history of the voyage, with an account of the natives of Tasmania, and some well
executed pictorial illustrations of the people and their habits. It is the last record
of the interesting race before the British settlement was formed, and is worthy of
preservation here, as Peron’s work is out of print. The natives were on the beach


v'-

'The Last Tasmanian Native)




observing the movements of the French voyagers. M. Peron and Lieutenant
Freycinet went on shore, and the following is Peron’s account of the interview :
“ To the signs of friendship which we made, one of them precipitated himself from
the top of a rock rather than descended it, and in the twinkling of an eye was in
the midst of us. Fie was a young man of from twenty-two to twenty-four years of
age, of an apparently strong constitution, having no other defect than a slenderness
of legs and arms, which characterises his nation. His physiognomy exhibited
neither austerity nor ferocity ; his eyes were quick and sparkling, and his looks at
once expressed benevolence and surprise. M. Freycinet having embraced him, I
did the same; but the air of indifference with which he received this evidence of
our interest made it easy to observe that it had no significance for him. That
which appeared to affect him most was the whiteness of our skin. Wishing to
assure himself, without doubt, if that colour was the same all over the body, he
opened our waiscoats and shirts, and his astonishment was manifested by loud cries
of surprise, and above all, by quick stamping of the feet. Yet our cutter appeared
to occupy him more than our persons, and, after having gazed a few moments,
he rushed down to the landing-place. There, without disturbing himself about the
sailors whom he found there, he seemed quite absorbed in his new observation.
The thickness of the ribs and panels, the solidity of its construction, its rudder, its
oars, its masts, its sails, he observed with all that silence and that profound
attention which are the least equivocal signs of a reflective interest and admiration.
In a moment one of our sailors, wishing no doubt to add to his surprise, presented
him with a wine bottle filled with grog, which formed a part of the rations of the
ship. The brightness of the glass called forth a cry of astonishment from the
savage ; but, soon his curiosity being led again to the vessel, he threw the bottle
into the sea, without appearing to have any intention other than to relieve himself
of an indifferent object, and afterwards went to his first research. Neither the cry
of the sailor, who was troubled at the loss of his bottle of grog, nor the entreaty
of his comrades to throw himself into the water to catch it, appeared to move him.
He made several attempts to push the cutter free, but the cable which held it
rendering all his efforts powerless, he was constrained to abandon it, and return to
join us, after having given us the most striking example that we had had of the
attention and reflection in savage people. An old man, after having examined both
of us with as much surprise and satisfaction as the first, made signs to two women,
who had hitherto been unwilling to approach. They hesitated some moments, after
which the elder came to us. The younger followed her, more timid and fearful than
the first. The one appeared to be forty years old, and (from appearances) had been
the mother of several children. She was absolutely naked, and appeared, like the
old man, kind and benevolent. The young woman, of from twenty-six to twenty-
eight years, was of a pretty robust constitution ; like the preceding, she was
entirely naked, with the exception of a kangaroo skin, in which she carried a little


girl, whom she still suckled. Her breast, a little withered already, appeared
otherwise pretty well formed, and sufficiently furnished with milk. This young
woman, like the elderly man and woman, whom we presumed to be her father and
mother, had an interesting physiognomy. Her eyes had expression, and something
of the spirituel which surprised us, and which since then we have never found in any
other female of that nation. She appeared also to cherish her child much ; and
her care for her had that affectionate and gentle character which is exhibited
among all races as the particular attribute of maternal tenderness.”
Peron relates another interview with a family group consisting of father and
mother, a young man, a little boy of five years, a younger girl, and a girl of sixteen
or seventeen, whose name was Oura Oura. The old man invited the visitors to his
evening meal of cockles and mussels. The French historian gives a glowing
description of the manners and customs of those simple children of Nature, but
more especially the innocent attentions of the forest maiden, who was “ chattering
with M. Freycinet, and seemed vexed at her inability to make herself understood.”
On another occasion, wandering in the forest with some of the officers,
Peron encountered a company of women. “ One of the oldest amongst them (he
writes) made signs for us to stop and sit down, crying out loudly to us— medi , medi,
(sit down, sit down.) She seemed also to ask us to lay down our arms, the view of
which alarmed her. These preliminary conditions having been complied with, the
women squatted upon their heels, and from that moment abandoned themselves
without reserve to the vivacity of their character, speaking all together, questioning
us all at once ; making, in a word, a thousand gestures, a thousand contortions as
singular as varied. M. Bellefin (surgeon) began to sing, accompanying himself with
very lively and animated gestures. The women kept silence, observing with much
attention the gestures of M. Bellefin, as if by them to interpret his singing. Hardly
had one couplet been completed when some of them applauded with loud cries,
others laughed to the echo, while the young girls, more timid doubtless, kept
silence, evidencing, nevertheless, by their movements and by the expression of their
physiognomy, their surprise and satisfaction. . . . One only, in the midst of
all her companions, preserved a dignified aspect. After M. Bellefin had ended his
song, she began to mimic with her gestures and her tone of voice in a very original
and pleasant manner, which much diverted her companions. Then she began to
sing herself in so rapid a way that it would be difficult to apply such music to the
ordinary principles of our own. Their song, nevertheless, is here in accordance
with their language; for such is the volubility of speech in these people that it is
impossible to distinguish any precise sound in their pronunciation. It is a sort of
thrilling sentiment, for which we cannot find any terms of comparison or analogy
in our European languages.” M. Peron adds his testimony to that of Captain Cook
and M. Labillardiere as to the chastity of the native women. “ Nothing (he says)
could induce them to be approached nearer. The least movement we made, or


appeared to make, to pass the prescribed line caused them to spring up from their
heels and take to flight,” The passion of jealousy, however, was found by Peron to
dwell in the savage breast as well as in that of the civilised courtier. “As they
were returning from fishing when we perceived them, they were laden with large
crabs, lobsters, and shell fish of different kinds, grilled upon ashes, and carried in
reed baskets. These baskets were tied round in front by a circle of cord, and hung
behind the back. . . . At length they went back to the beach, near which the
husbands of these poor women had been gathered together for some time. In
spite of the least equivocal evidence of the benevolence and generosity of our
countrymen they exhibited a restless and sombre physiognomy; their look was
ferocious and threatening, and in their attitude we distinguished a constraint,
malevolence, and perfidy, which they sought to dissemble in vain. At this
inauspicious meeting all the women who followed us appeared much concerned.
Their furious husbands cast upon them glances of anger and rage. After having
laid the products of their fishing at the feet of these men, who partook of them
immediately without offering them any, they retired behind their husbands, and
seated themselves on the other side of a large sandhill; and there, during the rest
of our interview, these unfortunate creatures dared neither to raise their eyes, nor
speak, nor smile.” One or two incidents of a less pleasing character occurred while
the Frenchmen remained, but they only show that human nature is the same
in all races. A boat’s crew landed at Bruny Island. An athletic native had been
exhibiting his powers, when a French midshipman engaged him in a wrestling
match, and threw him. The savage got up sulkily, and threw a spear at his victor.
On another occasion Messieurs Petit, Leschenault, and Hamelin went ashore at
Bruny. Petit, being an artist, proceeded to take likenesses of the natives who
were present, This liberty was resented by one of the blacks, who rushed forward
to seize the portraits, and they were saved with some difficulty. Blows were struck
on both sides, and a shower of stones closed the interview. But Peron was not to
be moved in his preconceived notions of the tender simplicity of the aboriginal
inhabitants of Tasmania. He closes his narrative in the following words :—“ Thus
ended our interview with the natives of Diemen’s Land. All the descriptions
which I have given are of the most rigorous exactitude; and without doubt it
would have been wrong to deny oneself the sweet emotions which similar circum-
stances ought to inspire. This gentle confidence of the people in us, these
affectionate evidences of benevolence which they never ceased to manifest towards
us, the sincerity of their demonstrations, the frankness of their manners, the
touching ingeniousness of their caresses—all concurred to excite within us senti-
ments of the tenderest interest. The intimate union of the different individuals of
a family, tho sort of patriarchal life of which we had been spectators, had strongly
moved us. I saw with an inexpressible pleasure the realisation of those brilliant
descriptions of the happiness and simplicity of the state of nature of which I had
so many times, in reading, felt the seductive charm.”


It is probable that there is an air of sentimentalism, incident to their
national character, in these records of the French naturalists who visited Tasmania
when the island was little known; but their accounts of the manners and habits of
the aboriginal race accord with those of Cook and Flinders. The latter was the
discoverer of Bass Strait, when, in 1798, he circumnavigated the island—after
Labillardiere’s and before Peron’s visit—on which occasion he met with natives at
the Derwent. Flinders writes : “ Our attention was suddenly called from contem-
plating the country by the sound of a human voice coming from the hills. There
were three people; and as they would not comply with our signs to them to come
down, we landed and went up to them, taking with us a swan. Two women ran
off, but a man, who had two or three spears in his hand, stayed to receive us, and
accepted the swan with rapture. He seemed entirely ignorant of muskets, nor did
anything excite his desire or attention except the swan and the red kerchiefs on
our necks. He knew, however, that we came from the sloop, and where it was
lying. . . . The quickness with which he comprehended our signs spoke in
favour of his intelligence.” Flinders had made his grand discovery of the insular
position of the island, and probably on that account was anxious to return to
Sydney with his report; for he parted with the black in order to save the flood-
tide ; but he remarks that “he was a short, slight man of middle age, with a
countenance more expressive of benignity and intelligence than of the ferocity or
stupidity which generally characterised the other natives (of Australia,) and his
features were less flattened, or negro-like, than theirs.”
The aboriginal inhabitants of Tasmania are now extinct For this reason we
have deemed it desirable to transcribe in a collective form all that was known of
them before the white men settled in their country, in order that the peaceful,
simple, and happy life they led prior to that event, may be contrasted with the sad
story of their subsequent career. Before we proceed, however, to narrate the
history of their degradation and final extinction, we shall refer to some incidents
which occured after the British settlements at the Derwent and the Tamar were
established —incidents which will further illustrate the native character.
In December, 1815, Captain Janies Kelly circumnavigated the island in a
whaleboat with four men. He came upon several parties of blacks on the south
and west coasts to whom the whites were unknown, except, perhaps, from the
reports of other tribes. On the coast opposite De Witt’s Isles he and his crew
landed for the night. They were received in a friendly manner by a large number
of natives, who brought down their women and children to see the strangers —an
act which Kelly regarded as a token of confidence and friendship. In the vicinity
of Port Davy they landed on the following day on a low grassy island near the
mainland. “ Here (Kelly says in his diary) we fell in with two aborigines ; they
seemed very much alarmed at seeing us. They were above six feet high; their
stomachs very large, legs and arms very thin ; and they seemed as if they were


nearly starved. We gave them two black swans, and they seemed delighted with
the present.” Kelly was the discoverer of Port Davey and Macquarie Harbour, on
the 17th and 28th December, 1815. On pulling into the Narrows at the latter
place the parties heard “ a large number of natives shouting and making a great
noise, as if they were hunting kangaroo.” The air was dense with smoke along the
coast, and consequently this party of natives did not see the visitors. On the
following day, however, the boat was beached on the coast farther to the north,
when, on landing and making a fire, they “ were accosted by six huge men, black
natives, each of them above six feet high, and very stout made. They had each
one spear in their right hands, and two in their left. They were quite naked, and
appeared ready for war or mischief.” They had probably never seen a white man
before, and the boat’s crew were alarmed at the approach of those sable warriors.
They held up some black swans, and a wombat, which they had in the boat; the
natives were delighted, and came nearer, when it was observed that each had a
spear between the great toe of each of their feet, which they dragged along the
ground. They parted with all their spears for the wombat and four swans,
appearing much pleased with the bargain they had made, and went away “ holding
up one hand each as a sign of friendship.” On 4th January, 1816, Captain Kelly
rounded Cape Grim and steered for Hunter’s Island. Here they landed, when an
encounter with natives took place, which Kelly describes as follows :—“ We landed
on the point opposite to the mainland on a large plot of pebble stones, to boil our
kettle and take a rest. There were a great many fires along the shore, and we
kept the boat and arms ready in case of an attack from the natives. Toombs and
Jones were left to take care of the boat and to have the arms in readiness. We
had just lighted a fire, when we perceived a large body of natives, at least fifty in
number, standing on the edge of the bush about fifty yards from us. They were all
armed with spears and waddies. We immediately brought the arms from the boat,
and put ourselves into a state of defence. They began to advance slowly towards
us near the fire. We held up our pieces, and made signs to them not to come any
closer. They held up their spears in return, accompanying their movements with
loud laughing. They jeered at us, as if they thought we were afraid of their
formidable band. We thought it desirable to retreat to the boat, when suddenly
they laid down their weapons in the edge of the bush, and each holding up both
hands as if they did not mean any mischief, at the same time making signs to
us to lay down our arms, which we did to satisfy them; for if we had retreated
quickly to the boat, it was probable they would have killed every one of us before
we could have got out of range of their spears. The natives then began to come to
us, one by one, holding up their hands to show they had no weapons, but we kept
a good look-out that they had no spears between their toes, as on a former occasion.
They had none. There were twenty-two came to the fire We made signs to them
that no more should be allowed to come. Upon that being understood, two others


came from the bush together. One of them seemed to be a chief, a stout, good-
looking man, about six feet high, and apparently 30 years of age; the other an old
man, about six feet seven inches high, with scarcely a bit of flesh on his bones.
When the chief came, he ordered them all to sit down on the ground, which they
did, and formed a sort of circle round the fire. The chief ordered the old man to
dance and sing, as if to amuse us, which he did, making ugly faces, and putting
himself into most singular attitudes. While the old man was engaged in his
dancing and singing, we found it was only to divert our attention fiom what the
chief and his men were doing. He ordered them to gather pebble-stones about the
size of hen’s eggs, and put them between their legs as they sat, for the purpose, as
we apprehended, of making an attack. Our men began to get alarmed, expecting
some mischief would be done. We planned it that we would give them a few
swans, and get off as well as we could. Briggs brought two. swans from the boat,
one under each arm. When the chief saw them he rushed at Briggs to take the
swans from him, but did not succeed. He then ordered his men to give us a
volley of stones, which they did, he giving the time in most beautiful order,
swinging his arms three times, and at each swing calling ‘ Yah I yah! yah ! ’ and
a severe volley it was. I had a large pair of duelling pistols in my pocket, loaded
with two balls each, and seeing there was no alternative I fired amongst them,
which dispersed them ; the other I fired after them as they ran away. Two of them
dragged Briggs along the ground a little distance to get the swans from him, but
were not successful. The chief and his men ran into the bush, and weie quickly
out of sight. On looking round after they had all scampered we found the six feet
seven inches gentleman lying on his back on the ground. We thought, of course,
he was dead, but on turning him over to examine his wounds, found he had not a
blemish on him. His pulse was going at 130. It must have been the reports of
the pistols which frightened him. We set him on his feet to see if he could walk ;
he opened his eyes and trembled very much. We led him a few feet towards the
bush; he stood up straight, looked round him, and took one jump towards the
scru ]Q the next leap he was out of sight. As soon as he was lost to our view, the
hills around echoed with shouts of joy from the voices of men, women, and
children. We measured the first jump the old man took—it was exactly eleven
feet, but the second must have been more, for they were more like the jumps of a
kangaroo than a man.” At this period bands of escaped sailors and convicts had
taken possession of some of the islands in Bass Strait. Peron met with a party
of them, in 1802, as far west as King’s Island. These men were afterwards
known as “ sealers.” One of their chief employments was that of kidnapping
the native women from their tribes on the north coast of Tasmania. It is said
that they practised every degree of falsehood and deceit to get possession of the
women and carry them away in their boats. Sometimes the women were
persuaded to go voluntarily, but more frequently they were purchased from their


relatives or were violently seized, while the blacks, who tried to protect them, were
shot down. These women were usually treated as slaves by the islanders, but
unions were sometimes effected, and family ties respected. The man Briggs (one of
Captain Kelly’s crew) was a sealer, and had two native wives at Cape Barren Island,
one of whom was daughter of the old chief Lamanbunganah, of the Bingarooma
tribe. Kelly, having spent a few days at George Town (River Tamar,) where there
was a military station, ran along the coast to the eastward, and landed at noon at
Ringarooma Point. Here they suddenly encountered a large party of natives, who,
upon first appearance, seemed hostile; but upon seeing Briggs, whom they knew
well, and who could converse with them in their own language, they were delighted
at the interview. The native chief made inquiry after his daughter, and was told
that she and her children were safe at Cape Barren. He said he knew that, for he
saw her smokes every day—a method of communicating with each other adopted
by the natives.
Captain Kelly touched at Swan Island on the 13th January, 1816, and
running along the shore on the following day hauled up at sunset on a small
island near Eddystone Point, where they spent a few days killing seals for their
skins. The native chief, Tolobunganah, with his tribe, numbering 200 men, women
and children, came down to the beach and received the visitors in a most friendly
manner. For some days they traded with the natives, bartering the carcases of
seals for kangaroo skins. Tolobunganah was anxious to procure more seals, and
suggested that Kelly would take some native women to the island to assist in
catching them, as they were dexterous at sealing. Kelly’s description of the
process adopted by the black women is interesting : —“ This course being agreed
on, Tolo (the chief) ordered six stout women into the boat. They obeyed with
alacrity, evidently delighted with the prospects of the trip. The wind being fair,
we ran over to the island, hauled the boat up, and pegged out the kangaroo skins
to dry. The women, perceiving some seals on the rocks, were anxious to commence
operations. We gave the women each a club that we had used to kill the seals
with. They went to the water’s edge and wet themselves all over their heads and
bodies, which operation they said would keep the seals from smelling them as they
walked along the rocks. They were very cautious not to go to windward of them,
as they said 'a seal would sooner believe his nose than his eyes when a man or
woman came near him.’ The women all walked into the water in couples, and
swam to three rocks about fifty yards from the shore. There were about nine or
ten seals upon each rock, lying apparently asleep. Two women went to each rock
with their clubs in hand, crept closely up to a seal each, and lay down with their
clubs alongside. Some of the seals lifted their heads up to inspect their new
visitors and smell them. The seals scratched themselves and lay down again. The
women went through the same motions as the seals, holding up their left elbow and
scratching themselves with their left hand, taking and keeping the club firm in


their right ready for the attack. The seals seemed very cautious, now and then
lifting up their heads and looking round, scratching themselves as before, and lying
down again; the women still imitating every movement as nearly as possible.
After they had lain upon the rocks for nearly an hour, the sea occasionally washing
over them (as they were quite naked, we could not tell the meaning of their
remaining so long,) all of a sudden the women rose up on their seats, their clubs
lifted up at arms’ length, each struck a seal on the nose and killed him; in an
instant they all jumped up, as if by magic, and killed one more each. After giving
the seals several blows on the head, and securing them, they commenced laughing
aloud and began dancing. They each dragged a seal into the water, and swam
with it to the rock upon which we were standing, and then went back and brought
another each, making twelve seals, the skins of which were worth one pound each
in Hobart Town.” When Kelly and his party were about to take leave of the
natives they seemed sorrowful at the prospect of parting from their white visitors.
The chief asked Briggs not to go until they had a dance, which Kelly thus describes
in his journal:—“ The whole mob of them —about three hundred in number —
formed a line in three divisions, the men and women forming two of them, and the
children another. Tolobunganah then gave the signal to commence the dance, and
it was a most singular one. The women in the centre division began a song, and
joining their hands, formed a circle, dancing round the heap of dead seals. They
then threw themselves upon the ground, putting themselves into the most grotesque
attitudes, beating the lower parts of their bodies with their hands, and kicking the
sand over each other with their feet. The loud laughter of the men and children
evidenced their gratification with the sport; and the women having sat down, the
children went through a similar dance. The men then commenced a sort of sham
fight with spears and waddies, dancing afterwards round the heap of seals, and
sticking their spears into them as if they were killing them. This game lasted
about an hour. Tolo then informed us that the dance was over.”
There are no further records extant of the manners and customs of the
Tasmanian blacks before their tribes were driven from their hunting grounds and
scattered. Occasionally, in after years, they displayed some traits of their original
habits; but very seldom, indeed, for their tribal independence had ceased —they
were fugitives collected together from different tribes or families in remote parts
of the forest, and, at last, were in captivity on a cheerless isle, away from
their native haunts. Mr. James Backhouse, who visited them at Flinders Island,
after all who survived had been brought in and transported thither, gives an
account of a dance which he had witnessed there. “ After sunset they had a
* corrobery,’ or dance round a fire, which they kept up until midnight, in testimony
of their pleasure. In these dances the aborigines represented certain events, or
the manners of different animals ; they had a horse dance and emu dance, a
thunder and lightning dance, and many others. In their horse dance they formed


a string, moving in a circle, in a half stooping posture, holding by each other’s
loins, one man at the same time going along as if reining in the others, and a
woman, as driver, striking them gently as they passed. Sometimes their motions
were extremely rapid, but they carefully avoided treading upon one another. In
the emu dance they placed one hand behind them, and alternately put the other to
the ground and raised it above their heads as they passed slowly round the fire,
imitating the motion of the head of the emu when feeding. In the thunder and
lightning dance they moved their feet rapidly, bringing them to the ground with
great force, so as to produce a loud noise, and make such a dust as to render it
necessary for spectators to keep to windward of the group. Each dance ended
with a loud shout, like a last effort of exhausted breath. The exertion used made
them very warm, and occasionally one or other of them plunged into the adjacent
lagoon. One of their chiefs stood by to direct them, and now and then turned to
the bystanders and said : ‘ Narva coopa corrohery ’ (very good dance,) evidently
courting applause.”
It is not certain whether the natives were acquainted with the method of
procuring fire from wood by means of friction. The process, applied to the hard
woods of the country, would doubtless be a difficult one, which reason alone would
account for the fact that they carried embers, or torches of bark, when they moved
from place to place. They had abundance of food when Tasmania was their own,
consisting chiefly of fish and kangaroo, of which there was a great abundance. The
women, as usual, in most uncivilised races, were more industrious providers than
the men. Labillardiere relates an interesting story of their industry : “ Hitherto
we had but a faint idea of the pains the women take to prepare the food requisite
for the subsistence of their families. They each took a basket, and were followed
by their daughters, who did the same. Getting on the rocks that projected into
the sea, they plunged from them to the bottom in search of shell-fish. When they
had been down some time we became very uneasy on their account; for where they
had dived were seaweeds of great length, and we feared they might have been
entangled in these so as to be unable to regain the surface again. At length,
however, they appeared, and convinced us that they were capable of remaining
under water twice as long as our ablest divers. An instant was sufficient for them
to take breath, and then they dived again. This they did repeatedly till their
baskets were nearly full. ... On seeing the large lobsters (crayfish) we were
afraid they must have wounded these poor women terribly with their large claws,
but we soon found they had taken the precaution to kill them as soon as they
caught them. They quitted the water only to bring their husbands the fruits of
their labours, and frequently returned almost immediately to their diving till they
had procured a sufficient meal for their families. At other times they stayed a little
time to warm themselves, with their faces towards the fire, on which the fish were
roasting, and other little fires burning behind them, that they might be warmed on


all sides at once. It seemed as if they were unwilling to lose a moment’s time, for
while they were warming themselves they were employed roasting fish, some of
which they laid on the coals with the utmost caution, though they took little care
of the lobsters, which they threw anywhere into the fire, and when they were ready
they divided the claws among the men and children, reserving the body for them-
selves, which they sometimes ate before they returned into the water.”
The Tasmanian natives were never known to indulge in the revolting
practice of cannibalism. They were too gentle and patriarchal in their habits to
countenance such a savage propensity. Perhaps the abundance of food induced a
life of greater contentment than that which characterised most of the savages of the
Pacific islands. They burned their dead on a funeral pile—a custom which was
observed both before and after British settlement on the island. It was noticed by
the French of D’Entrecasteaux’s expedition, in J 792, and again by Peron in 1802,
who describes and gives a drawing of a cone which he saw on Maria Island erected
over the ashes of the dead. The cone was built of poles and bark in the form of a
pyramid, which Peron considered graceful, elegant, and picturesque. Mr. G. A.
Robinson, the Protector of the aborigines, witnessed the cremation of a man and
wife on Bruny Island in 1829. The wife’s death is recorded in Robinson’s journal:
—“ Made her some tea and returned to my quarters. The husband soon followed
me, his cheeks wet with tears. He said : ‘Luberer lowgerner un-wence ’ (wife sleep
by fire.) He stopped half an hour. I made him some tea for his children, and
asked him if he would take his luberer any. He said : ' Tea no ailly , parmatter,
panmerlia line-ner, no ailly ’ (tea no good, potatoes, bread, water no good.) Shortly
after I met him coming towards my quarters with his two children, kangaroo
skins, &c. At about one hundred yards distant I saw a large fire. It immediately
occurred to me that his wife was dead, and that the fire I then saw was her funeral
pile. I asked him where his luberer was. He replied : ‘ Loggeenee, uenee ’ (dead,
in the fire.”) The husband died broken-hearted a fortnight after his wife, and
Robinson thus describes the disposal of his remains :—“ The other natives were
sitting around, and some were employed in gathering grass. They then bent the
legs back against the thigh, and bound them round with twisted grass. Each arm
was bent together and bound round above the elbow. The funeral pile was made
by placing some dry wood at the bottom, on which they laid dry bark, then placed
more dry wood, raising it about two feet six inches from the ground. A quantity
of dry bark was then laid upon the logs, upon which they laid the corpse, arching
the whole over with dry wood, men and women assisting in kindling the fire, after
which they went away, and did not approach it any more that day. On the
following day they collected any remains and burned them • finally they scraped
the ashes together and covered it over with grass and sticks.”
The natives were timid during the darkness of the night, and full of super-
stitious dread of any evil spirit. They disliked to speak of their deceased friends


and relations. They always went to rest at dusk, rising at midnight or in the early
morning, when they passed the remainder of the time before daylight in singing, in
order (as they thought) to keep away the evil spirit. They believed in the existence
of both a good and an evil spirit; and, according to some authorities, they had a
faint conception of a future state. In their primitive condition they lived—as the
narratives of Labillardiere and Peron show—in simplicity and contentment. They
had not acquired the knowledge of forming canoes out of logs of wood, but made
catamarans, by means of which they crossed rivers and bays, and frequently visited
Hunter’s, Maria, and Bruny Islands. The French navigators found a catamaran
in Adventure Bay, made of pieces of bark and held together by cords of grass.
Another was found at Maria Island, capable of holding half a dozen persons, and
strong enough to resist a moderate sea. Some of them had sharp bows ; they were
propelled by paddles, but these were without blades. Rude huts, or breakwinds,
made of boughs and bark, were occasionally met with on the southern and western
sides of the island. Mr. Calder saw a bark hut, on the inside walls of which were
several rude drawings in charcoal of a kangaroo, an emu, and a battle scene. The
spear of the natives was a long tea-tree pole of about ten feet in length. Although
they were not a warlike people, they were skilful in the use of the spear. An
instance is recorded of a native who had been captured; he put a crayfish on a
spear, and pierced it with another spear at a distance of sixty yards
We must now turn to that period in the history of the native race when a
great change took place in their life and habits, and all was dark and gloomy in the
young British settlement. The first party of white people who came to reside on
the island landed from Sydney, in August, 1803, on the banks of the Derwent, a
little higher up the river than the site afterwards chosen for the city of Hobart.
There were some soldiers under command of a Lieutenant Bowen, a small party of
convicts, a few free settlers, and a doctor. The place was named Risdon. Some
rough cottages had been erected, and the little settlement was fairly estab-
lished before the natives appeared. With their first interview, which was quite
unexpected and unprovoked on their part, a murderous assault was committed
upon them by the soldiers, which marked the commencement of a series of
hostilities which continued until the whole race were either murdered or captured.
The outlying huts on the settlement were occupied by three persons named Clark,
Burke, and White. The latter was engaged one day hoeing some ground near the
river, when he heard the sound of voices, and saw a large body of natives,
numbering at least three hundred, shouting and approaching rapidly down the hill
as they drove a herd of kangaroos before them. I hey had no spears with them,
but carried waddies (short, thick hunting clubs,) and their women and children
accompanied them. White’s account of the affair was given some years later in
evidence before a commission of inquiry. He stated that when he first saw about
three hundred natives coming down the tiers in a semicircle—men, women, and


children—with a flock of kangaroos in front of them, he ran down the creek and
reported them to some soldiers, and then returned to his work. Ihe natives did
not threaten him, nor was he afraid of them. They did not attack the soldiers, but
the latter commenced to fire at them, and many were slaughtered and wounded
he could not state how many. They never came so close again afterwards. They
had no spears with them, only waddies. Another witness named Evans, belonging
to the Risdon party, was examined by the committee. He was not present at the
time of the firing, but was on the ground immediately afterwards, and learned the
news. He was told that when the blacks came down in a large body they did not
show any hostile intentions, but appeared to be hunting kangaroo. He never
heard that they interrupted anyone, but were fired upon by the soldiers. He did
not know who ordered the firing, or how many were killed, but he had heard that
there were men, women, and children. The report of the committee records the
melancholy fact that “ a lamentable encounter did at this time take place, in which
the number of slain—men, women, and children —have been estimated as high as
fifty.” This horrible slaughter of an innocent and unoffending people is perhaps
the darkest deed in colonial history. Mr. W. C. Wentworth, who published a
description of New South Whies and Van Diemens Land in 1819, thus alludes to
the affair : “ The spirit of animosity and revenge, which this unmerited and
atrocious act of barbarity engendered, has been fostered and aggravated to the
highest pitch by the incessant encounters that have subsequently taken place
between them and the whites.” It was not until the year 1830, when Colonel
Arthur was Governor, that an official inquiry was made, and the facts were
recorded.
For some years following this tragedy the blacks kept away from the British
settlement at the Derwent; but they were not permitted to remain undisturbed in
their forest haunts. Before the first Governor (Collins) had been long in the
colony, the new settlement suffered severely from an unexpected famine. New
South Wales had been growing grain on the Hawkesbury plains in sufficient
quantity to supply the southern colony as well as herself. In 1806, heavy rains
occurred; the Hawkesbury plains were flooded for miles, and all the grain, with
barns, cattle, sheep, and many homesteads were carried away in the flood-waters,
which rose to a height of sixty feet in a few hours. In consequence of this
misfortune there was a great famine. There was no possibility of supplying the
Tasmanians with meat or breadstuff’s from New South Wales, so that they were
entirely thrown on their own resources, which consisted only of sufficient meat and
flour for a few weeks. A succession of disasters followed. The wheat crops failed for
two years running, and the settlements at the Derwent and Tamar were bordering
on absolute starvation. All the maize, wheat and barley had been consumed, and
there was not a pound of beef or pork left in the Commissariat stores. The
Government, unable to feed the convicts, of whom numbers of the worst class had


been sent to Hobart from Sydney, permitted them to roam at large in search of
food. They were provided with muskets and ammunition for the purpose of shoot-
ing birds and wild animals for their own use and that of the settlement. Bands of
these lawless desperados wandered at will over the country, disturbing the natives
on their hunting grounds, and destroying the herds of kangaroo upon which they
depended for their sustenance. This, however, was but a spec in the chapter of
misfortunes which followed. The desperate criminals who had thus been liberated
were sent from Botany Bay under double and treble sentences. Sunk in the lowest
depths of depravity, they paid no respect either to the dictates of conscience or to
the restraints of human or divine law. It can therefore be imagined how, thus let
loose upon the confiding blacks, they indulged their evil propensities when, under
the guise of friendly intentions, they took them off their guard, and seized the
young women and girls for the purpose of gratifying their lustful desires. If the
male natives attempted to rescue their wives and daughters they were shot down
and brutally murdered ; and when those poor children of the wilderness discovered
the real character of the whites —when deceit and artifice failed to induce them to
approach near-then they were watched to their encampments at night, and, under
cover of the darkness, were slaughtered in cold blood, the blacks were stupid,
timid, and incapable of defending themselves during the darkness of the night, and
it was then that the whites succeeded in carrying out monstrous acts of cruelty. It
was the custom of the natives to sleep surrounded by watch-fires, kindled under
an impression that they would keep away the evil spirit. These hies revealed theii
resting-places to the new enemy, who pounced upon them while they slept, and
made captives of the females, while the terror-stricken males fled out into the forest.
Thus began a series of depredations which bore bitter fruit in after years.
Strange as it may now appear, six years elapsed before the settlement at the
Derwent had food to eat in sufficient quantity, and then they were only relieved by
the arrival of a cargo of wheat from India. During that time the convicts, under
no restraint, continued to wander at large, and to commit depredations on the
black tribes. When they were called in, after having tasted the sweets of freedom
so long, they naturally resisted coercion, and many of them fled to their old haunts
in the forests, were they had acquired a knowledge of hunting, and thus
enabled to live in idleness and unlawful indulgences. Henceforward they were
known as bushrangers. They hesitated not to commit deeds of \ iolence uporr
either the blacks or the whites, whenever an opportunity offered. In like manner
the blacks, animated by a spirit of revenge, became wily and treacherous, retaliated
on the whites without discrimination, speared the shepherds and cattle on the
outlying stations, burned the huts and the pasture, murdered inoffensive persons
travelling through the country, and in every possible way impeded the advancement
of the young colony. There are but few records of this terrible period left behind ,
for when Collins, the first Governor, died in the year 1810, at Hobart, all the public
Qt


documents of the colony were mysteriously destroyed. The first record which has
been handed down is a memorandum book, in which is an entry of the following
Government Order, bearing date 29th January, 1810 “ There being great reason to
fear that William Russell and George Gelley will be added to the number of unfor-
tunate men who have been put to death by the natives, in revenge for the
murders and abominable cruelties which have been practised upon them by
the white people, the Lieutenant Governor, aware of the evil consequences
that must result to the settlement if such cruelties are continued, and abhorring
the conduct of those miscreants who perpetrate them, hereby declares that
any person whomsoever, who shall offer violence to a native, or who shall in
cool blood murder, or cause any of them to be murdered, shall, on proof being
made of the same, be dealt with and proceeded against as if such violence had
been offered, or murder committed, on a civilised person.” This proclamation
did not have the desired effect. Governor Collins died two months after it was
issued, and it was nearly three years before his successor was appointed, the
government of the colony in the meantime devolving upon military officers.
When the next Governor did reach Hobart, there was no improvement
made in the social condition of the colony. He was a man unfit to govern ;
and, as a consequence, the unfortunate natives still suffered violence at the
hands of their unprincipled oppressors. Nevertheless, many instances occurred,
showing the docile and confiding nature of the blacks in cases where kindly
disposed settlers, living in isolated parts of the country, treated them in a
friendly or humane manner. As soon as they discovered these traits in the
white settler they became his friends, frequently assisting in the light work of
the farm, notifying the movements of bushrangers, and bartering kangaroos for
bread and mutton. In such cases they respected the rights of property, and
were never known to betray the confidence reposed in them. The white chil-
dren played with those of the blacks ; boys and young men went out into the
bush on hunting excursions, accompanied by the natives ; gentlemen who had shown
kindness to them could take a journey, leaving their wives and families unpro-
tected, so long as there were no bushrangers in the neighbourhood. But these
were only exceptional cases. The quick ear, the watchful eye, and the sharpened
spear of the native were, as a rule, called into action to protect himself and
his family from wanton assault—and too often without avail; for not only the
numerous gangs of outlaws who infested the country, but frequently the sous
and servants of the settlers shot them down without provocation. The historian,
West, gives a brief, but vivid picture of the practices of the whites“ The
wounded were brained; the infant cast into the flames ; the bayonet was driven
into the quivering flesh; the social fire, around which the natives gathered
to slumber, became before morning their funeral pile.” Melville, an early colo-
nist and newspaper proprietor, wrote:— “In this riot of wildness, favourable in


its very existence to the display of our worst attributes, how have they been
treated ? Worse than dogs, or even beasts of prey—hunted from place to
place; shot; their families torn from them; the mother snatched from her
children, to become the victim of the lust and cruelty of their civilised
‘ Christian ’ neighbours.” And the first Bishop of Tasmania, who took a great
interest in the wretched survivors, wrote at a later period; —“ There are many
cases on record which make us blush for humanity when we read them, and
forbid us to wonder that the maddened savage’s indiscriminate fury should
not only have refused to recognise the distinction between friend and foe,
but have taught him to regard each white man as an intruding enemy who
must be got rid of at any cost.”
In vain did the Government endeavour to deter the white people from
acts of cruelty which provoked retaliation on the part of the natives, and
which resulted in terrible murders on both sides. Two years after Sorell,
the third Governor, arrived in the colony (1819,) he found that matters were
going from bad to worse. Frequent proclamations had been issued, warning
the inhabitants that any person found guilty of murdering, or otherwise un-
lawfully molesting a native, would be dealt with in precisely the same manner
as he would in the case of committing the same offence on a British subject.
In 1819, Governor Sorell issued a Public Order, as follows :—“ From infor-
mation received by his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, there seems reason
to apprehend that outrages have been recently perpetrated against some of
the native people in the remote country adjoining the River Plenty . . , .
Upon this subject, which the Lieutenant-Governor considers of the highest
importance, as well to humanity as to the peace and security of the Settle-
ment, his Honour cannot omit addressing the settlers. The Lieutenant-Governor
is aware that many of the settlers and stock-keepers consider the natives as
a hostile people, seeking, without provocation, opportunities to destroy them
and their stock; and towards whom attempts at forbearance or conciliation
would be useless. It is, however, most certain that if the natives were intent
upon destruction of this kind, and if they were incessantly to watch for oppor-
tunities of effecting it, the mischief done by them to the owners of sheep
and cattle, which are now dispersed for grazing over so great a part of the
interior country, would be increased one-hundredfold. But so far from any
systematic plan for destroying the stock, or people being pursued by the native
tribes, their meetings with the herdsmen generally appear to be accidental;
and it is the opinion of the best informed persons who have been longest in
the Settlement, that the former are seldom the assailants, and that, when they
are, they act under the impression of recent injuries done to some of them by
the white people. It is undeniable that, in many former instances, cruelties
have been perpetrated repugnant to humanity and disgraceful to the British


character, while few attempts can be traced on the part of the colonists to
conciliate the native people, or to make them sensible that peace and
forbearance are the objects desired. The impressions received from earlier
inquiries are kept up by the occasional outrages of miscreants whose sense of
crime is so remote as to render detection difficult, and who sometimes wantonly
set fire to and kill the men, and at other times pursue the women for the
purpose of compelling them to abandon their children. This last outiage is
perhaps the most certain of all to excite in the sufferers a strong thirst
for revenge against all white men, and to incite the natives to take vengeance
indiscriminately, according to the general practice of an uncivilised people,
when in their migrations they fall in with the herds and stockmen. It is
not only those who perpetrated such enormities against a people comparatively
defenceless that suffer; all the owners of stock and their servants aie involved
in the consequences brought on by the wanton and criminal acts of a few.
From the conduct of the native people when free from any feeling of injury
towards those who have sought intercourse with them, there is strong reason
to hope that they might be conciliated. On the north-east coast, where
boats occasionally touch, and at Macquarie Harbour, where the natives have
been lately seen, they have been found unsuspicious and peaceable, manifesting
no disposition to injure; and they are known to be equally inoffensive in
places where the stock-keepers treat them with mildness and forbearance. A
careful avoidance, on the part of the settlers and stockmen, of conduct tending
to excite suspicion of intended injury, and a strict forbearance from all acts
or appearances of hostility, except when rendered indispensable for positive self-
defence, or the preservation of the stock, may yet remove from the minds
of the native people the impressions left by past cruelties; so that the meet-
ings between them and the colonists, which the extension of the grazing grounds
and progressive occupation of the country must render yearly more frequent,
may be injurious to neither, and these mischiefs may be prevented.
u To effect this object is no less the interest than the duty of the
settlers and the stockmen ; to bring to condign punishment anyone who shall
be open to proof of having destroyed or maltreated any of the native people
(not strictly in self-defence) will be the duty and is the determination of the
Lieutenant-Governor, supported by the Magistracy, and by the assistance of
all just and well disposed settlers. With a view to prevent the continuance
of the cruelty before mentioned, of depriving the natives of their children,
it is hereby ordered that the resident Magistrates at the Districts of Pitt-
water and Coal River, and the District Constables in all the other Districts,
do forthwith take an account of all the native youths and children which
are resident with any of the settlers or stock-keepers, stating from whom
and in what manner they were obtained. The same Magistrates and District


Constables are in future to take an account of any native person or child
which shall come to be brought into their district or country adjoining, together
with the circumstances attending it. These reports are to be transmitted
to the Secretary’s Office, Hobart Town. No person whatever will be allowed
to retain possession of a native youth or child, unless it shall be clearly
proved that the consent of the parents had been given, or that the child
had been found in a state to demand shelter and protection, in which case
the person into whose hands it may fall is immediately to report the circum-
stances to the nearest Magistrate or Constable. All native youths and children
who shall be known to be with any of the settlers or stock-keepers, unless
so accounted for, will be removed to Hobart Town, where they will be supported
and instructed at the charge, and under the direction of the Government.”
This important Government order had little or no effect. The bush-
rangers, shepherds, and stockmen held laws, rules, and regulations in open
defiance. They continued to kidnap the native girls, and to oppress the
tribes in a most inhuman manner. Horrible tales were told of these abomin-
able deeds by the perpetrators themselves, many of whom were in the habit
of boasting of the part they took in annihilating the aboriginal inhabitants.
One young man, the son of a wealthy settler, told the writer of some shock-
ing tragedies in which he had taken a leading part. On one occasion the
natives had speared some of this man’s cattle in retaliation for previous wrongs.
It was the custom of the sons and servants of the settler to lie in ambush for
“ a mob ” of native women and girls, and to seize and carry away the younger
ones whenever an opportunity offered. Instinctively the women fled, in terror
of being captured; but, as time went on, they discovered too often that their
flight was arrested by the deadly bullet; and, in order to save their lives, they
sometimes yielded to the brutal grasp of the captor. These acts produced
retaliation on the part of the natives, who avenged their wrongs by spearing the
sheep and cattle on the runs. Our informant told his story thus:—“As soon
as evening approached, I mustered our men to watch for the resting-place of
the natives on the tiers. We had six muskets in good working order, and a
good supply of ammunition, with ball and heavy slugs. The men posted them-
selves in good positions for making observations; and at last, in the grey
twilight, one of them detected a light smoke rising from a gully two miles
distant. We carefully noted the spot and waited until near midnight, when we
all sallied out together in search of our game. We took no dogs with us, lest
they might be heard by the watchful dogs of the natives. Keeping the open
country we soon reached the tier, and proceeded stealthily along until we
stood over the little gully, from whence we then distinctly saw the smoke
arising. It was now necessary to move along as quietly as possible; and, by
observing every precaution, we succeeded in getting a pretty near view of


the lighted lire, with a mob of natives and their dogs fast asleep around it.
Having arranged our muskets and pistols for the fray, the former being
loaded with heavy charges of slug and grape shot, we all six noiselessly
approached to within a few yards of the wretches, when all of a sudden
the dogs gave the alarm by raising a great commotion and furious barking.
The natives were on their feet like electricity, but they looked stupefied, and
never attempted to run. It would have been all the same if they had, for
we had them nearly all under cover of our guns, which we discharged at
once, and dropped some eight or ten like crows. Then there was a jolly
scramble to make off, but we dropped a few more as they bolted away
into the scrub. Our night’s sport made a dozen less natives, whom we left
there to rot, and we sent away several wounded.” It is a very remarkable
fact—and one that points to a Supreme Avenger of innocent blood —that
those sons of early colonists who habitually indulged in lawless deeds of
vice and crime seldom succeeded in after life : they became gamblers, drunkards,
suicides and no wonder that a heavier curse than that of Cain should have
rested upon them.
The bushrangers were, if possible, a greater terror to the natives. It
is on record that one party of those outlaws was in the habit of binding
them to trees, and using them as targets for practice. Another bushranger
“ killed a blackfellow, seized his gin (wife,) then cutting off the man’s head,
the brute fastened it round the wife’s neck, and drove the weeping victim
to his den. The bushrangers Dunn and Michael Howe committed many
atrocious murders. Mr. Bonwick, the indefatigable explorer of old records,
relating to the life and extinction of the Tasmanian aboriginies, has given
some heartrending accounts of the abominable cruelties of the whites, some
of which are too horrible to relate. “We came upon them (he says) as
evil genii, and blasted them with the breath of our presence. We broke up
their home circles. We arrested their laughing corroborree. We turned their
song into weeping, and their mirth to sadness.” Mr. Backhouse relates that
one party, in pursuit of the blacks, killed thirty in capturing eleven. Quamby’s
Bluff, in the Deloraine district, was so called from a poor hunted savage
who was caught there falling upon his knees and shrieking out — “ Quamby!
Quamby ! ” (mercy ! mercy !) A magistrate of the colony told Mr. Bonwick
of the spearing of one of his servants near Macquarie River. A company
of soldiers went in pursuit of the supposed murderers. Falling in with a
tribe around their night-fires, in a gully at the back of the river, they shot
indiscriminately. Many were slain, but the Government made no inquiry
into the affair. An eye-witness described a similar attack in the night:— ‘ One
man was shot, and the others got away : the party went up to the fires,
found a large number of waddies and spears, and an infant sprawling on


the ground, which one of the party pitched into the fire.” In 1827 a man
was killed by the natives. The neighbouring settlers chased the criminals,
and according to the newspaper of the day, “They report that there must
be about sixty of them killed and wounded.” A party of soldiers and con-
stables “ got a number of natives between two perpendicular rocks, and killed
seventy of them, dragging the women and children out of the crevices of
the rocks, and dashing out their brains.” Night-time, as we have already
said, was the opportunity of the dastardly white man to reap his harvest
of blood. Filled with superstitious dread, trembling and terrified, the poor
savage, naturally of a meek and affectionate disposition, fell an easy victim
of brutal passion and unmerciful revenge. The testimonies of numbers of
writers all concur in condemning the barbarous conduct of the white people. The
Rev. Doctor Lang narrates one of the many tragic acts that were perpetrated
during that reign of terror which lasted for twenty-five years : “A spot was
pointed out to me a few years ago in the interior of the island where seventeen
had been shot in cold blood. They had been bathing, in the heat of a sum-
mer’s day, in the deep pool of a river, in a sequestered and romantic glen,
when they were suddenly surprised by a party of armed colonists who had
secured the passes, and I believe not one of them was left to tell the
tale. A convict bushranger who was hanged a few years ago for crimes
committed against the European inhabitants of the colony, confessed, when
under sentence of death, that he had actually been in the habit of shooting
the black natives to feed his dogs.”
But this carnival of blood was not confined exclusively to the whites.
The natives, maddened by a spirit of revenge, made desperate efforts to exter-
minate their oppressors. Regardless of friend or foe, they watched the
homesteads of inoffensive settlers, who, if they ventured away to inspect
their stock on the runs, or to take a journey, were waylaid and speared;
and then the blacks would return to the house for the purpose of attacking
its inmates, who were barbarously murdered in many cases where the means
of defence were inadequate. The Avails of the setttlers’ dwelling-houses Avere
usually made of logs, Avith Avooden chimneys, and a roof of bark. In the
walls Avere loopholes through Avhich the inmates could fire in case of attack
from the bushrangers or the natives. This method of defence afforded a
certain amount of security when there Avere arms and ammunition inside;
but the wily blacks were in the habit of throAving torches of burning bark
on to the roof, thus setting fire to the house and dislodging its inmates. Some
instances of heroic resistance are recorded. The folloAving incident Avas pub-
lished at the time —and the writer received from the heroine herself an
account of the adventure, Avith many thrilling tales of the native war Our
informant Avas the celebrated Dolly Dalrymple Briggs, the half-caste daughter


of Briggs who accompanied Captain Kelly in his whaleboat excursion round
Tasmania. She was born in the year 1808, at one of the Straits Islands,
to which place Briggs, who was then a sealer, had taken her mother, a
young and handsome native of the Ringarooma tribe. Subsequently Briggs
brought his wife and half-caste children to Launceston, and Dolly, the eldest
daughter, was brought up and educated by a gentleman and lady in that
town. Afterwards she became the wife of Mr. Thomas Johnson, a stock-
keeper in one of western districts. Here, in 1831, Mrs. Johnson was attacked
by the natives while Johnson was absent from home. There was no person
in the hut but the mother and two female children. Hearing some voices,
the elder child ran out, and had only proceeded a few paces when she
uttered a loud shriek. The mother ran to the door with a musket in her
hand, and found that her child had been speared. The spear had penetrated
the upper part of the thigh, and was so firmly fixed in the flesh that it
was removed with considerable difficulty. Retreating at once into the hut
with her child, she secured the doors and windows, and, seizing her musket,
proceeded to fire on the natives with duck shot, which was all she had.
The natives protected themselves behind stumps and trees for a time; then
they made a rush to the slab chimney, which they were in the act of pulling
down, but one of the men got wounded by the fire from inside which Mrs.
Johnson kept up as briskly as she could, and the blacks retreated for a
time. They returned in about an hour with a quantity of faggots which
they had prepared for lighting and throwing on the roof of the hut in view
of burning out the inmates. For several hours the would-be murderers were
kept at bay by this brave woman, when at length the sudden appearance
of Johnson, galloping towards the premises, and loudly cracking his stock-
whip, dispersed them. A sad tale is recorded of the family of one Gough,
who lived in a remote part of the interior. While he was from home one
day the natives stole down the wooden chimney into the hut, speared, and
then brained the poor woman, and waddied the children. Taking what clothing
and provisions they could find, they disappeared into the forest. When the
father arrived home one of his girls was still alive, and he heard the shock-
ing tale from her dying lips. On another occasion a farmhouse was attacked
when the settler was from home. The wife, daughter, t\yo sons, a servant,
and a traveller were in the hut. They defended themselves successfully for
some time, when the enraged natives set fire to the thatch of the roof.
At this moment a party of soldiers appeared through the forest, and the
hostile tribe fled. This reign of terror was not confined to any particular
locality. In every district of the colony the cry of the wounded and the
wails of the widow and fatherless was heard. At Swanport, Fingal, York
Plains, North Esk, Lovely Banks, Oatlands, Port Sorell—wherever there was


a settler residing, the same sanguinary deeds were perpetrated. The hostile
blacks moved from place to place with amazing rapidity. Remnants of alien
tribes united in a desperate attempt to extirpate the common enemy of their
race; and in avenging the blood of their slaughtered countrymen, they
paused not to consider the distinctions between their unmerciful persecutors
and the whites who were kindly disposed: all shared alike in the wild
carnage. The beautiful summer sky was turned into darkness by the smoke
of conflagrations, which rose from the waving harvest of indigenous grasses
on the plains. Flocks of sheep, unable to escape the flames, huddled together,
and were burned to death. Brush fences, shepherds’ and stockmen’s huts,
homesteads, and grain ripe for the sickle, were swept away by the fires which
spread all over the country, and left nothing in their wake but the charred
surface of the ground. Within six years no less than 121 outrages by the
blacks were recorded in the district of Oatlands alone; and Mr. Anstey,
the coroner of the district, held twenty-one inquests upon murdered people
in three years —1827-30. Some of the most hostile blacks were led by semi-
civilised natives who had acquired the use of firearms, and were well acquainted
with the habits and customs of the Europeans. These were mostly young
men, and they proved formidable foes. They had taken to the bush in
most cases, notwithstanding a good English training, in consequence of the
horrible treatment they had seen their own people suffer at the hands of
the whites. Thus fired by an avenging spirit of retaliation, many innocent
persons suffered for the wrongs others had inflicted on the native race.
There was one heroic woman named Walloa, the wife of a chief in the
north-west, who had been stolen by a sealer, but escaped to her own people.
This woman became a ferocious enemy of the whites on account of the
cruel treatment she had received from the sealers; while the war of the
races lasted her steps were marked with blood. But the most powerful
accomplice was Mosquito, an aborigine of New South Males, who had been
brought up with the whites in his own country, and had been transported
to Tasmania for the murder of a female. After a chequered career, this
monster joined a tribe of Tasmanian natives. He was accompanied by Black
Jack, a “ civilised ” native who had received an English education. After
a sanguinary career these men were executed at Hobart on 25th February,
1825. Our informant of Mosquito’s last tragic act was Mr. Radford, who
was afterwards known to the writer as a settler at Little Swanport. In the
year 1823, Radford fell in with Mosquito’s party at Grindstone Bay, when
he received a spear wound in his side from Black Jack. He ran wounded
for three miles to a hut, pursued by the natives. Radford eluded their
search, but two men in the hut were murdered. The chief was so hotly


pursued after this crime, that he had to lie in concealment, but he was at
length discovered and brought severely wounded to Hobart, where he and
Black Jack were tried for murder, found guilty, and executed.
Governor Arthur was pained by the horrible accounts that were per-
petually coming to headquarters from the country districts. He was a
firm and energetic man, experienced in military life, but he was moved by
the tenderest sympathy for the unfortunate natives. In April, 1828, he pro
claimed a line of demarcation, in the hope of restraining intercourse between
the whites and the coloured inhabitants. The tribes were to be driven back
into that wild and inhospitable region on the western side of the island,
where there were no hunting grounds, where there was but little food to
sustain life, and where even the austerity of the climate was foi bidding.
Military posts were established along the line, across which neither party
was to trespass. This attempt entirely failed. The tribes, who had been
accustomed to the kangaroo walks on the verdant pastures of the eastern
and midland districts, could not all be driven back over an imaginary line,
beyond which were unproductive wilds and snow-clad mountain ranges , and
those who were thus forced away consisted of mixed tribes, whose numbers
had been decimated by fire and sword, and whose very dialects were strange
to each other. Thus the shattered fragments of a once contented and happy
people, though they escaped in their new haunts the midnight raids of the
murderer, led a life which was worse than death. The natives soon disre-
garded the Governor’s proclamation, and preferred to go back to their accustomed
hunting grounds, with all the dangers attached. Murders and outrages were
of continual occurrence still. In November of the same year martial law
was proclaimed against all the blacks who were found in the settled districts;
but the humane Governor was dissatisfied with harsh measures, and in view
of civilising the tribes, offered a reward of five pounds for the capture of
an adult, and two pounds for a child. Several “capture parties” engaged
in this undertaking. They were to bring in the blacks with the least pos-
sible loss of life, and the Governor would reward those who were successful
with grants of land, in addition to the money to be paid for each capture.
But it was unfortunately too late. A desire for retaliation and revenge
was so deeply rooted in the black man’s heart that it was with difficulty
any were captured without fighting and bloodshed. Mr. Bonwick says:—
“So rancorous was the hatred of the natives against the whites, that every
expedient was adopted to carry out their malevolent purpose, and torments
were used with almost an Indian refinement of cruelty . . . The most abominable
atrocities were perpetrated upon some victims’ bodies. But this was adopted
for the purpose of exhibiting their deadly animosity against the Europeans
for their treatment of the native women, and was a terrible retaliation for


similar cruelties practised upon the male blacks. Some of our countrymen
were emasculated, and the dying were often given up to the torturing hands
of the gins, who, with sharp stones, added poignancy to the last agony. Several
bush hands have told me such stories, unfit for publication, but all evidencing
the blacks’ deep-rooted spirit of revenge.”
The capture parties were not, upon the whole, very successful. The
names of Cotterell, M‘Kay, Sherwin, Howell, Parish, Anstey, Gilbert Robertson,
Batman (afterwards the founder of the Colony of Victoria,) Jorgensen, and the
afterwards celebrated conciliator of the whole race, George Augustus Robinson,
were prominent in their efforts to capture the natives. These and a few others
led bands of roving parties, who penetrated all parts of the island in search
of the blacks, in view, not of destroying them, but of bringing them in
alive. In 1829 Gilbert Robertson brought in the bold and powerful chief
Eumurra, with four of his tribe, for which service he received a reward of
1000 acres of land. Batman, born in New South Wales, was an expert
bushman, and was known as the black man’s friend. He succeeded in captur-
ing several natives. On one occasion he relates his adventure thus (18th
September, 1829)“ Seeing a number of natives approaching toward us, I ordered
the men to lie down, and not to fire on them ; but when I should whistle,
to rush forward and seize them. When they approached within forty yards
I gave the signal. We all ran forward, and secured three women, two young
children, three boys, and two young men.” In another letter he told a sad
tale of the state of the colony about this time. “ I have just time to say
that the natives last Thursday week murdered two men at Oyster Bay, and
the next day they beat a sawyer to death. On the Sunday after, they
murdered a soldier. On last Wednesday they attacked the house of Mr.
Boultbee when he was absent; and had it not been for a soldier, who happened
to be there, they would have murdered Mrs. Boultbee and all the children.
Friday last they murdered three men at a hut belonging to Major Gray,
and left the fourth for dead.” On a subsequent occasion, when he was
searching the forests at the foot of Ben Lomond, Batman suddenly came
upon a mob of seventy ferocious black warriors, belonging to mixed tribes.
They immediately saluted him with a shower of spears, and followed it up
by such a determined assault that he had to order a discharge of musketry.
Fifteen were slain, and one woman and a child were made prisoners. After
spending twelve months in pursuit of the natives. Batman was rewarded by
a grant of 2000 acres of land. The other capture parties were more or less
successful. It is said that over 200 were secured. These were sent to
Bruney Island, where they were placed in charge of a protector.
Governor Arthur was not satisfied with the methods adopted by the
roving parties They carried firearms, and natives were frequently shot.


His Excellency therefore devised a scheme by which he hoped to drive the
whole of the aborigines, or nearly all of them, on to an isthmus of land
on the southern side of the island, called East Bay Neck. Here they would
have no means of egress, except onward to Forestier’s Peninsula, where it
was supposed they could be captured. The plan of action involved a large
outlay on the part of the Government, and all the colonists were called
upon to render assistance in carrying out the undertaking. The object aimed
at was of vital interest to the inhabitants, for the colony was in a most
alarming condition at the time. The bushrangers, owing to the clever tactics
of the military Governor, had been almost exterminated; but from north to
south, and east to west, a furious warfare was going on between the black
and white races. The natives were being slaughtered in a wholesale man-
ner —so much so that the remnants of the most formidable, tribes had abandoned
their hereditary haunts, and united together in positions which offered the
best facilities for attacking the shepherds, stockmen, and the homesteads of
the settlers. Instead of yielding in despair, they fondly hoped to drive out
the foreigner, and regain supremacy in their beautiful island home. Their
adverse fortunes and the sad experience they had gained in their intercourse
with the whites had made them artful, cunning, treacherous, and full of
revenge. It was therefore imperative that a desperate effort should be made
to restore order, and put an end to the bloodshed which was destroying
both the natives and the colonists.
Arthur’s proposal was to organise a force sufficient in number to form
a cordon, or line, extending from east to west at the northern side of the
island, each person being within hail of the next on either side, so that
by advancing southward the natives would be driven in front, and ultimately
secured on the peninsula. Some there were who ridiculed the idea of thus
entrapping such a wily foe, but generally the inhabitants were delighted with
any proposal that afforded a bare possibility of relief from the dangers that
surrounded them. A public meeting was held at Hobart, and the people
in both town and country resolved to support the movement. It was accordingly
arranged that an attempt be made on a very costly and elaborate scale.
The military consisted of about 800 men belonging to the 63rd, 40th, 57th,
and 17th regiments. The plan of operation was designed by Governor Arthur,
and was hartily responded to by the settlers, who prepared themselves to
go out en masse, and render what service they could in the great under-
taking. In addition to the settlers, their assigned servants were permitted
to take the field and engage in the enterprise. The inhabitants of the towns,
except those who were told off to guard those places from the attacks of
bushrangers or natives, also took part. The military and the constabulary
formed an important element in this great undertaking, known as the “ Black


Line.” The field command was placed in the hands of Major Douglas, with
divisions under the command of some twenty gentlemen, chiefly officers in
the army. Colonel Logan was left with eight divisions of seven men each
in charge of the capital, and Major Abbot was appointed Commandant during
the absence of the Governor, who personally directed operations on the Line.
There were 119 leaders of parties; in all there were about 8000 persons
engaged in the undertaking, of whom 738 were convict servants. When the
line was formed, it extended from St, Patrick’s Head (on the east coast)
to Lake Echo and the Great Lake on the west, and thence along the
western portions of the county of Buckingham. The whole of the inter-
mediate county was to be thoroughly scoured, and the line was to pass onward
towards the Peninsula in the south, care being taken that no gap should
occur to allow the natives a chance to escape through it to the northern side.
Depdts for the supply of food and clothing were established at twenty-six places
between the east coast and the lakes. Full provision was made for the
supply of arms and ammunition; and, in addition to the supply taken at
starting, there was a central depot established at Oatlands, with a thousand
stand of arms, thirty thousand rounds of cartridge, and three hundred
handcuffs.
The march commenced on the 7th October, 1830. The details of this
great enterprise—great for so small a community are extremely interesting;
but as the results were so small, it is not within the scope of our present
design to transcribe them here. It is stated that the “despatches received
and sent equalled in number those forwarded by the allied armies during the great
European war.” The Governor was known to ride fifty miles a day over rough
country without roads. At one time he was lost three days in Paradise, a
wild forest country near the east coast. The settlers and others were completely
worn out in their tedious march up the rocky and precipitous mountain ranges,
down the deep ravines, where a heavy growth of underwood, interlaced with
creeping plants and vines, impeded their onward progress at every step, and
frequently caused deviations and breaks in the line. Boots and wearing apparel
were worn out and parted into shreds long before the termination of the
march. Intense anxiety prevailed as the parties closed in round East Bay
Neck, where it was ardently hoped a grand capture of natives would be
made. But the attempt turned out a complete failure, affording only another
illustration of the fact that the best laid schemes of men as well as mice
“gang aft a glee.” A small party of natives were in advance of the line
Their night-fire was seen and their encampment was stormed. Five natives
were asleep round their fire; one of them was seized by the legs, and
secured after a violent struggle; a boy was also taken alive, two men
were shot, and the fifth made his escape. Thus ended a remarkable episode


in aboriginal history. The cost of the expedition to the Government was
about £BO,OOO, and it is calculated that, altogether, £60,000 would be short
of the total expense incurred.
In consequence of this unfortunate result, the colonists were more deter-
mined than ever to extirpate the blacks by all possible means. The work
of destruction had already reduced their numbers so considerably that it was
conjectured that only a few hundreds remained alive; but these were a terror
to the whole country. They still hoped that by destroying the stock, and mur-
dering the colonists, they would induce the whites to quit the country, and
thus they would regain their ownership of the land. Their hopes were vain;
still the war raged, and the poor natives began to lose their only solace —hope.
Many of them retreated into the uninhabited parts of the interior to escape
the midnight incursions of the whites, whose open determination to destroy
them had now reached a pitch that knew no limits.
At this juncture Mr. George Augustus Robinson came forward, and
made proposals to the Governor to the effect that he would engage to bring in
all the natives, lodge them in a place of safety without the use of firearms, and
by peaceful means only. Gladly did his Excellency listen to Mr. Robinson’s
humane proposals. The roving parties were called in, and Robinson made active
preparations for the execution of his conciliatory mission. For some years prior
to this he had been acquiring a knowledge of the native language, and of the
habits and disposition of the race. In March, 1829, a notice was published in
the Gazette, offering £SO a year to any person of good character who would
undertake the oversight of any natives who could be induced to reside on Bruny
Island, under British protection, at which place they would be provided with
food and clothing, and all their wants would be attended to. Robinson, a
Wesleyan school teacher and tract distributor, applied for the situation. Being
a man of excellent report, with a wife and family to maintain, he was appointed
at a salary of £IOO a year. It soon became evident that he was the right man
in the right place. The blacks on Bruny Island became devotedly attached to
him; and, if ever he went out into the mainland bush, he succeeded in capti-
vating the natives of the wildest tribes by his gentle, winning, and fearless
manner. In 1831. his salary was raised to £250 a year —for he had by that
time satisfied the Governor that, by moral force alone, he would bring in all
the tribes. Arrangements were now made to prepare Swan Island for the
reception of the blacks; but that island was found to be unsuitable, as it
was bare of wood, and too much exposed to wind and weather. Gun
Carriage (Yansittart) Island was next selected. It, too, was abandoned, being
too small, and without a good stock of wild animals. "Ultimately, in 1832,
Flinders Island was chosen for the “ Black Settlement.” It is an extensive
island, 130 miles in circumference, within sight of the Tasmanian mainland


at Ringarooma, abounding in kangaroo, wallaby, wildfowl, and with plenty
of fish on the coast; but the sight chosen for the Black Settlement was
low and damp, contiguous to swamps and lagoons, and without a supply of
pure river water.
Robinson entered on his peaceful mission of conciliation in 1830. His
party consisted of eight Europeans and ten natives who belonged to the
domesticated blacks of Bruny Island. Amongst the latter were the Chief
Wooreddi, and his wife Truganini, whose chequered life was not void of
interest even at this time; but her career became more interesting at a
later date. She outlived all her race. Truganini’s history from first to
last was a thrilling romance of real life. She was born at Recherche Bay,
or Bruny Island, about the year 1811, seven years after the British settle-
ment was formed. Her father was Mangana, chief of the once powerful
Bruny tribe, who were probably the friendly natives met with by the
French in 1802. w Her sister Moorina was taken captive in her early days
by a party of sealers. Her mother was murdered by the whites, and her
uncle was shot by a soldier. In 1830, all that remained of the formidable
Bruny tribe were Truganini, her husband Wooreddi, two of his boys by a
former wife, and two more women, all of whom laid down their spears, and
gave themselves up to Robinson and M‘Kay in January, 1830. Truganini’s
first remembrances of the English people were similar to those of nearly all
her race. Her family experienced indescribable cruelties. Mr. Calder has
preserved a statement from her own lips : it is deeply affecting, coming as
it does from one who was afterwards so celebrated in native history. “We
were camped close to Partridge Island (in D’Entrecasteaux Channel,) when
I was a little girl, when a vessel came to anchor without our knowledge
of it; a boat came on shore, and some of the men attacked our camp.
We all ran away, but one of them caught my mother, and stabbed her
with a knife, and killed her. My father grieved much about her death,
* The late Mr. J. E. Calder kindly supplied the writer with the following extract from the Hobart Toivn
Gazette of 28th October, 1826, from the pen of the late Mr. Thomas Scott, surveyor, whose party was on the
Bruny Island, examining the coal cliff of that island ; —“ There does not appear to be more than twenty blacks on
the whole island. Their fires are generally seen on the hills to the south, opposite Satellite Island. Occasionally,
however, they make excursions to the north. They are a stately race of men. While our tent was pitched at the
head of Isthmus Bay, five men came down, but without their women or children. They had spears with them, with
which I asked them to aim at a tree. After many trials, it appeared that within a distance of thirty yards they
never fail to strike their object—but beyond that, success is uncertain. Their countenances were placid, generally
with a smile, and their manners were friendly. They were in general about 5 feet 6 inches, or 5 feet 8 inches in
height. They have with them a number of little dogs, very expert in hunting the small species of kangaroo, with
which the island abounds. This accounts for the owners being stout and healthy. Their only covering was a skin
over the shoulders, and suspended to the neck a few trinkets, buttons, and other things which they had obtained
from the navigators who had in former periods visited their coasts. They are remarkably fond of bread, and
frequently asked the party for it. In approaching strangers they hold up both hands over the head, to show they
carry no offensive weapons ; and if their signal of peace is answered, they approach with confidence.”


and used to make a fire at night by himself, when my mother would come
to him. I had a sister named Moorina; she was taken away by a sealing
boat. I used to go to Birch’s Bay; there was a party of men cutting
timber for the Government there; the overseer was Mr. Munro. While I
was there, two young men of my tribe came for me; one of them, named
Paraweena, was to have been my husband. Well, two of the sawyers said
they would take us in a boat to Bruny Island, which we agreed to. When
we got about half-way across the channel, they threw my companions over-
board, but one of them held me.” The rest of this tragedy was communi-
cated’by Truganini to M‘Kay. "Directly they were overboard and the girl
secured, the sawyers took to their oars, and using all their strength, pulled
away from them, leaving them either to drown or to regain the land if they
could. But the young blacks were both fast swimmers, and overhauled the
boat before she had much way on her, and laying hold of the gunwales
tried to get in again; but this was most effectually prevented by one of
the boatmen seizing a hatchet and chopping off their hands near the wrists,
in which disabled state the poor creatures went down, and the murderers
o’ot clear off with their prize—the poor girl who had just witnessed the
shocking massacre of her young companions.” Mangana’s home was
His wife had been murdered; his daughter Moorina had been carried off
by the whites ; his tribe had been scattered and slaughtered by the unmerciful
hand of lawless marauders who perpetrated the most unmanly crimes in order
to gratify their insatiable lust. No wonder, therefore, that the young, and (it
is said) handsome daughter of the broken-hearted chieftain led a wandering and
perhaps erratic life. There is no record of Mangana’s death, which probably
occurred soon after the murder of his wife. Truganini was nineteen when,
in 1830, she and her husband, Wooreddi, with four others, the sole survivors
of the Bruny tribe, gave themselves up to M‘Kay and Robinson. She was
a clever, intelligent woman. Mr. Bonwick says 1 “ Her mind was of no
ordinary kind. Fertile in expedient, sagacious in council, courageous in
difficulty, she had the fascination of the serpent, the intrepidity of the royal
ruler of the desert. ... A lady described to me her appearance in 1882.
She declared her exquisitely formed, with small and beautifully rounded
breasts. The little dress she wore was thrown loosely around her person,
but always with a grace and a coquettish love of display. Mr. Duterrau,
the artist, made an excellent collection of aboriginal portraits about this
time, amongst which were those of Truganini, Wooreddi, and Manalagana,
a celebrated chief who also joined Robinson’s mission. Manalagana was a
remarkable man. Mr. Duterrau, who took much interest in the unfortunate
race described him as -a warrior who stood unrivalled amongst the abori-
gines, and was considered a sage by his tribe Such was the


commanding influence Mr. Robinson possessed over these singular people,
that, at the first interview, Manalagana left his native wilds, and accompanied
him on all Mr. Robinson’s missionary enterprises throughout the island, to
whom he continued faithfully attached to the conclusion of his service in 1835.”
Manalagana’s wife was Tanlebouver, who with her sister was originally
stolen from their tribe by the sealers when children, and were held in
bondage until released by Mr. Robinson in 1830, who proceeded to the
Straits Islands in that year with an authority from the Governor to liberate
all the black women involuntarily detained there. Mr. Duterrau says :
“ Tanlebouyer was superior to the other natives, both in person and intel-
ligence. and possessed much dignity of manners, seldom participating in
those frivolities the other indulged in. She was exceedingly attached to her
husband. The feeling was mutual, for during the period of six years they
were with Mr. Robinson they never quarrelled.”
With these and other trusty followers, Mr. Robinson entered on his mission
of conciliation. The year 1830 was spent in traversing the country, holding friendly
interviews with the natives, presenting them with gifts, and persuading them to
abandon their hostile feelings of revenge, and to place themselves under his protec-
tion. Starting from Bruny Island, he landed at Recherche Bay, and proceeded
overland with his blacks and three white men, the latter carrying firearms to be
used only for procuring supplies of food, or for self-defence in case of an emergency.
No natives were seen until the party reached Port Davey, on the south coast. Here
a large number appeared in sight, but they fled at Robinson’s approach. He then
sent forward some of his friendly blacks, who succeeded in holding an interview
with the wild ones. One of the women found a long-lost brother with the tribe—
a circumstance which greatly facilitated the work of the mission. The wild blacks
arranged to meet Robinson on the following day. When they met they discovered
that the white people carried muskets; this excited supicion, and they withdrew.
A meeting, however, was effected on the 21st January, which led to friendly inter-
course. Robinson remained three weeks, travelling and camping with the savages
during the whole of that time. He then moved on with his party to Macquarie
Harbour, proceeding onward in a northerly direction to Cape Grim, and thence
easterly to Circular Head and Emu Bay. During this long and difficult journey he
met many tribes, and left impressions behind which were highly favourable to his
future exploits. He also visited the Ringarooma country, whose native tribes had
been greatly harassed by the sealers. Proceeding across to the islands in the
Straits, he rescued eighteen females from the sealers, who had liberty to join their
relatives or to go under protection at Bruny Island. This noble conduct endeared
Robinson’s name to the eastern tribes, and paved the way to his future success.
The Governor was now satisfied that there was a prospect of bringing in the
natives by means of Mr. Robinson’s pacific plans. Flinders Island was prepared


for their reception. Robinson was invested with full control, as Conciliator and
Protector of the Aborigines, with an increased salary of £250 a year. Accordingly,
early in 1831 he made preparation for his grand enterprise, the principal object
being to induce the blacks to leave the forest and accompany him to a new country,
where they could live in peace on fine hunting grounds, no one daring to molest
them. Amongst the first who laid down their spears and followed the “ Conciliator,”
was the broken remnant of the Stony Creek tribe. Its chief, Moulthalergunah, had
been a sanguinary foe before his followers were scattered and slaughtered by the
whites. They now numbered only twenty in all. Within the first six months of
1881, Mr. Robinson met sixteen tribes, and induced 123 blacks to abandon the
forest wilds, and follow his party on their mission of peace. Many pathetic inci-
dents are related of the natural kindliness of those savages, whose adverse fortunes
had corrupted their gentle disposition, and made them a terror to the whites.
Many happy reunions took place. Husbands and fathers again met their lost wives
and daughters who had been kidnapped by the white people. Others joined in the
hope of meeting their long lost relatives ; but in too many instances they had been
killed. Altogether this was an exciting time in Tasmanian history. The fierce
savage and his tribe, ever on the watch round the homesteads of the settlers,
seizing every opportunity to kill or wound all who came within their reach, were
now converted into meek and harmless adherents of the Conciliator. Men of firm
resolve, intent on gaining back possession of their hunting grounds, and filled with
feelings of inveterate hatred and revenge —men whom the most active persecution
failed to subdue were won over and their vindictive spirit quelled by the potent
spell of a friendly word and confiding manner. The former docility of the race
came back to them when they laid down their spears and joined Robinson. As
they journeyd towards Hobart the settlers looked on with amazement and terror
when they beheld the famous Stony Creek tribe thus subdued by the simple arts of
moral suasion.
During the latter part of the same year a celebrated victory was gained over
the Big River and Ouse tribes, who had united their forces in the hope of extermi-
nating or driving off the white people. This formidable body of native warriors
was led by the chieftain Montpeliata, and urged on to the perpetration of the most
horrible deeds of treachery and bloodshed by Walloa, a woman of wonderful tact
and determination in avenging the slaughter of her race. They moved through the
interior with amazing rapidity, spearing horses, cattle, and sheep in the Ouse
district one day, then hurrying away to the lakes and on to Port Sorell in the far
north. At the latter place there was only one settler, Captain Thomas, who
selected his grant of land at North Down, between Port Sorell and the River
Mersey. He had a large agricultural establishment, and had never been harassed
by the aborigines, those of the Port Sorell tribe who were still at large in the
vicinity being friendly. On the 31st August, 1831, Captain Thomas rode down to


a vessel in the port which had brought him supplies. His overseer, Mr. Parker,
was with him. They had made their horses fast iu a shed, when a female of the
friendly blacks came up and informed them that “a mob of the wild blacks was in
the bush close by.” Captain Thomas and Mr. Parker decided to proceed on foot
with the woman to interview the tribe, and endeavour to conciliate them. At a
distance of about half a mile on the right hand side of the track to North Down the
natives were encamped. Being in no way intimidated, the wild blacks allowed the
two white men to approach, Captain Thomas having given the signal of friendship.
He carried with him a gun, and this probably raised their suspicion. They
dissembled friendship for some time; but at the moment when Captain Thomas
was off his guard, a powerful native snatched away his gun, and a general display
of hostility ensued. The two unfortunate visitors sought safety by flight, but a
shower of spears followed, and they fell. Their dead bodies were found, covered
with spear wounds ; the murderers had retreated to the mountains. The spot
where this tragedy occurred was pointed out to the writer by Captain Thomas’
nephew six years after the unfortunate event. Robinson was soon on their track.
He followed them into the wild uninhabited regions of the Western Mountains—-
past the elevated plateau of the Great Lake—and at last, on the 18th of November,
he came upon them at Lake Echo. Robinson’s party consisted of twelve friendly
natives, his son, a Sandwich Islander, and a messenger. As soon as Montpeliata
discovered the mission party approaching his camp, he ordered his followers to
retreat in haste, for he suspected that it was an armed party in pursuit of his tribe,
to avenge the murders at Port Sorell. They fled so suddenly that they left behind
several spears, a looking-glass, and the gun which they had taken from Captain
Thomas. Robinson followed them up, frequently finding their encampments ; but
they invariably fled as he approached. At length, on the last day of the year,
their camp fires were seen about two miles distant, in the neighbourhood of the
Barn Bluff Mountain. Here it was deemed desirable to resort to artifice in order
to gain an interview with the fugitives. The whites secreted themselves in a scrub,
while the native women were sent forward to negotiate. It was a bold and
daring exjfloit. No firearms were carried by any of the party. No human aid was
within reach. They were in the heart of the wild and lonely mountains, scores of
miles from the nearest habitation. The Conciliator and his followers had committed
themselves to the work, and had determined to do or die. It was a time of awful
suspense until the result of the messenger’s reception was known. Presently the
wild tribe was heard approaching with a war-whoop and the rattle of spears.
Robinson, in his report to the Governor, wrote : “In less than half-an-hour after-
wards I heard the war-whoop, by which I knew that they were then advancing upon
me. I also heard them rattle their spears as they drew nearer. At this moment
Manalagana leaped on his feet in great alarm, saying the natives were coming to
spear us. He urged me to run away. Finding that I would not do so, he


immediately took up his spears and kangaroo rug and walked away. Some of the
others were about to follow his example, but I prevailed upon them to stop. From
their advancing with the war-whoop, the friendly natives as well as ourselves con-
sidered that they were approaching with hostile intentions, and that they had either
killed the natives we had sent from ns, or that those natives had joined the hostile
tribes. As they drew nigh I did not observe my people amongst them. The
hostile natives being a large body, I was rather anxious as to the result. It was
not until they approached very near that I saw my own people with them. Ihey
continued coming up in the same warlike attitude. I then walked up to the chiefs
and shook hands with them. Having explained to them in the aboriginal dialect
the purpose of my visit amongst them, I invited them to sit down, gave them some
refreshment, and selected a few trinkets as presents, which they received with much
delight. They evinced considerable astonishment at hearing me address them in
their own tongue, and from henceforth placed themselves entirely under my conti 01.
The men were accompanied by the women; and after taking their refreshment, I
returned with them to their own encampment, where the evening was spent in
mutual good humour, each party dancing alternately.” This was one of the grandest
achievements recorded in native history. Had Robinson lost courage and attempted
to fly, his safety would have been endangered as well as that of all his followers.
Instead of this they stood with uplifted hands awaiting the advance, Montpeliata,
the tall and powerful-framed chieftain, glared at them, grasping a spear eighteen feet
in length. He was followed by fifteen strong men, with three spears and a waddy
each. The women kept behind, carrying on their backs a fresh supply of spears.
One hundred and fifty dogs growled defiance at the strangers. The chief with
difficulty restrained his men from rushing on the trembling mission party,
for they were fired with a spirit of hatred of the whites. A word from the
chief and every life would have been forfeited. Montpeliata advanced some
sixty yards in front of his men, and addressed Robinson. “ Who are you ? ”
He replied “We are friendly.” “Where are your guns?” “We have none.”
“Where your piccaninni (little guns or pistols)?” “We have none,” was
again the reply. There was a pause. The chief seemed undecided. Bungera
ran away; all the Conciliator’s party were in intense terror and anxiety until
the chief called Bungera back, saying he would not hurt him. Still there were
several minutes of doubt and suspense. The chief walked slowly to the
rear to consult the old women, while the men pointed their spears in readi-
ness for the attack Shortly, however, the women were seen throwing up
their arms three times —a sign of peace. At the chieftain’s command the
spears were thrown down, and the friendly natives rushed forward with tears
of joy and shouts of gratitude. Several lost relatives and loved ones were
found. Eumurra recognised his two lost brothers; his wife found three
relatives. Wooreddi, the chief of Bruny, grasped the hand of his brother


Montpeliata. A cheerful corroborree was celebrated in the evening, and
the parties spent the night together, the wild tribe yielding unreservedly to
the counsels of their white friend. Thus were the sanguinary tribes that
had long spread terror and dismay in the homesteads of the settlers sub-
dued by the prudent intervention of one man unarmed. When the whole
colony went out in arms against them, and all that military stratagem could
accomplish was brought to bear in order to capture them, they eluded the
grasp of their supposed enemies ; but now, when the lone undefended white
man and his handful of followers were at their mercy, the benevolence of
the native character manifested itself, and they became once more tender-
hearted and confiding. They laid down their spears at Robinson’s feet, but
he handed them back, and conversed with them in a friendly manner.
This mark of confidence produced the desired effect: henceforward their lives
were devoted to his service.
There was great rejoicing in the ranks of the friendly blacks when they
witnessed the bloodless victory their commander had gained over these wild
tribes. Early on the following morning all were astir preparatory to taking
their journey to Hobart. They reached Bothwell on the sth January, 1832.
The united parties of men, armed with spears and waddies, who now followed
Robinson, with their women, children, and dogs, formed so large a company
that the shepherds, stockmen, and settlers fled in consternation at their
approach, and it was with considerable difficulty that Robinson, as he advanced
through the settled districts, could make the people understand that he was
actually the victor, and that the much-dreaded tribes had voluntarily thrown
down their weapons and surrendered. As they approached Hobart, the
Conciliator sent despatches to the Governor, announcing his successful mission,
and intimating that they would arrive in the city at a given time. The
inhabitants assembled at the appointed hour, and greeted their arrival by
such friendly manifestations as were likely to please and give confidence to
the blacks. Presents were showered upon them from all sides, everyone
appearing now to realise the fact, too long concealed, that the power of
love is greater than that of hate and revenge. Governor Arthur waited
at Government House to receive Robinson and his followers. It was a
time of great joy to his heart. With money and men at his command,
he had been unable to touch the key-note which had softened the dark
warriors’ hearts. He was moved to tears as he gave them a hearty welcome,
and observed how their ranks had been thinned by war. They were only
the shattered fragments of a once powerful and numerous people. The
demonstration at Government House assumed the form of a festive gathering.
As soon as the repast was over, sports were indulged in. The whites dis
played their skill and the blacks, in return, performed feats with their


spears. The native, Ondia, hoisted a crayfish on a spear, and at a distance
of sixty yards brought it down with another spear. The military band was
ordered by the Governor to play a lively air in view of astonishing the
natives; but, as soon as the martial music filled the air, they screamed
with terror, and crowded round Mr. Robinson, entreating him to protect
them. Nor were their fears allayed easily; it was some time before they
could be induced to approach the drums and examine them. In the evening
Mr. Robinson took the whole party to his own house in Upper Elizabeth Street,
and they camped about his premises. It was during their stay at Hobart
on this occasion that Mr. Duterrau took several portraits of the aborigines,
copies of which are justly prized as faithful records of the race.
Robinson was received at Hobart with enthusiastic demonstrations on
the part of all classes of the people. The newspapers of the day lauded
his bold efforts, and expressed surprise at his extraordinary success in sub-
jugating such a treacherous and wily people. It was generally felt that,
although many natives were still at large, the capture of the Big River and
Ouse tribes had broken the strength of the savages, and that the unhappy
settlers in the midland districts would now be enabled to pursue their
avocations in peace, without fear of sudden attacks, and instant death at
any moment from the spears of their antagonists; for those who remained
at large consisted mostly of fugitives who had retired to the unsettled parts
of the island. Robinson received a reward of £IOO ; but it was now con-
sidered that his wonderful success was worthy of further recognition. The
Governor presented him with a grant of £4OO, and promised an additional
sum of £7OO as soon as he had completed his mission.
It was now evident that all the survivors of the unhappy race would
be brought in, and it was deemed expedient to at once decide on a suitable
place for their future abode. Various islands in Bass Strait were proposed.
Swan Island, as we have said, lying olf the north-eastern corner of Tasmania,
only a few miles from the mainland, had been selected in 1830. In
November of that year twenty-three voluntary exiles were sent there. They
were followed by thirty-three in December. These were all well cared for
by the authorities, but they were extremely unhappy in their new abode.
Mr. Bonwick tells us that “ they were not unhealthy on this desolate granite
rock ; ” but one little incident occurred there which illustrates the melancholy
condition of the captives. Amongst them was an intelligent and faithful
female who had been guide to Mr. Robinson, “ When the second party of
blacks arrived on the island, the earlier transports were eager to learn the
fate of their friends. Amongst the many sad tales rehearsed by the new-
comers was the intelligence of the murder, by the whites, of the two brothers
of the guide. It were vain to picture the harrowing sorrow of the unfor-


tunate woman, or to describe her regret at the part she had taken with
the mission, and the indignant reproaches she cast upon the enemies of her
people.” The limited area and barren nature of Swan Island, together with
the fact that the water on it was brackish, soon satisfied the Government
that it was not a suitable residence for the blacks. Mr. Robinson visited
the place, and at once condemning it, removed the inhabitants to a small
islet further north. In April, 1831, the captives were again removed to
Yansittart Island. Dr. Maclachlan was appointed superintendent over the
little black settlement, and a small military party under a sergeant was
stationed on the island to guard the stores, protect the females from
illtreatment, and keep off the sealers who occupied islands close by. This
move turned out a failure also. Yansittart Island was too small for the
active natives of Tasmania, who had been accustomed to wander at large
over the extensive wastes in the interior of the home country. Mr. Bonwick
says: —“ The unfortunate creatures, having no motive for exercise—for little
game ran within those narrow boundaries—used to sit day after day on the
beach, casting tearful glances across the stormy sea towards the mountains
of their native land. Those denizens of the thicket and the forests, with
no maritime tastes, with nothing at every turn but the ever-restless, hateful
water, pined in their rocky prison. Their officers were as dissatisfied with
the dungeon-like residence. Strong representations were made as to the
wretchedness of the climate, and the barrenness of the ground. No means
existed for the arrest of the terrible home sickness which was carrying off
so many of the natives.” It was then resolved to abandon Yansittart, and
occupy Flinders Island, close by, where there were extensive plains well stocked
with kangaroo, and abundant scope of mountain, hill, and dale, over which
the natives could wander at their will.
At the close of the year 1831 the Black Settlement was established
on Flinders. It is a large island, upwards of forty miles long and from
twelve to twenty-two miles broad. There are some mountain ranges on the
southern side of the island, and forests with rich agricultural soil extend
along the western side ; but generally the country is low, with healthy plains
and dense underwoods of stunted tea-tree. The spot chosen for the settle-
ment was called the Lagoons, surrounded by damp, salt-water flats, and tea-
tree scrub. There were no running streams to be found —the only means
of procuring a supply of fresh water being from holes dug for the purpose.
As soon as the natives beheld the place, they at once relapsed into a state
of despondency. They had been looking forward to the happiness they would
experience when they left their little prison-house and came to the land
whose lovely mountains they often gazed on in the distance, and longed to
be there, because they reminded them of their own Tasmanian homes. The


selection of the site for the dwellings devolved upon Sergeant Wright, who
had been instructed to lose no time with the soldiers under his charge in
building rough cottages for the natives, and for his own party of white people.
While the old sergeant and his men were thus occupied, the utmost disorder
prevailed amongst the blacks, whose worst passions had been revived in con-
sequence of their isolated position and the discomforts by which they were
surrounded. Tribes who had never, even in their days of freedom and pros-
perity, been on terms of friendly intercourse, and were now brought into
close contact with each other, manifested a quarrelsome disposition, and there
was no competent authority on the island to exercise a benevolent
influence over the unhappy captives. Wright did all he could to preserve
order and decorum, but he was endowed with the military spirit, using
coercion and severe punishment as a means of mending matters, but these
measures had the opposite effect. It is said that he seized fifteen of the
most powerful or quarrelsome of the men, and, assisted by sealers from the
adjoining islands, put them upon a barren rock in the sea, without food,
water, or other necessaries, and that the wretched people would have died
in that condition had they not been rescued by a vessel which happened
to pass the spot. They had been five days without food, and were in a
dying state when thus released. The story they told was to the effect that
the soldiers had carried them off in order to enjoy uninterrupted criminal
indulgence with their women. Wright’s statement was at variance with the
other, and it was certified by some of the residents. He stated that there
was a plot laid to upset his government, and to murder the whites. A
native woman, known as Black Mary, gave evidence to this effect against
her husband Cantityer, and the others whom Wright had punished.
Such was the state of affairs when Robinson arrived at Hobart with
his important acquisitions in the beginning of the year 1832. He heard of
the sorrows of those whom he had already placed in exile with deep regret,
and resolved to spare no effort to ameliorate their condition. Arrangements
were made at once, whereby he would be enabled to visit the islands,
inquire into the cause of existing troubles, and select a more suitable place
for the settlement. Accordingly, on the 11th February, he sailed for Flinders
Island, taking with him the tribes who had surrendered, with Montpeliata,
their noble chief. It was a time of sadness. The bold natives who had
seen their tribes reduced to a fragment during years of unholy warfare,
and were themselves driven back into inhospitable forests, until in despair
they gave themselves up to Robinson when he proclaimed to them his
message of peace, were now crowded together in a 'small sailing vessel,
suffering violently from sea-sickness, and terrified at the novel position as
they were tossed about by the waves. But their deep faith in the humane


object of the Conciliator did not forsake them. He was with them in the
vessel, and they looked forward to a fulfilment of the pledge he gave them —
that they would reach a peaceful country where they would not be disturbed
in the chase, where the hunting grounds would be all their own, and no
white man would be permitted to molest or disinherit them. When they
reached the island, Robinson found that everything was in the utmost dis-
order and confusion. The blacks upbraided their protector for deceiving them.
He listened to their tales of sorrow with a sad heart and with eyes filled
with tears. He assured them that there would be an immediate change
made in the management, and that all he had promised would be faithfully
fulfilled. He excused his apparent neglect by explaining to the blacks that
his personal presence was required on the mainland, to bring in their friends
who were still at large, and liable to be shot down at any moment by the
vindictive whites, but that as soon as his mission was accomplished he
would come and reside amongst them. These assurances pacified the poor
confiding natives, and order was spedily restored.
The moment Governor Arthur heard of the calamities which had
befallen the natives at Flinders Island he despached Lieutenant Darling, of
the 63rd Regiment, who received the appointment of Commandant, and was
accompanied by a suitable staff to assist him in the management of affairs.
This gentleman —who was a brother of Sir C. H. Darling, one of the
Governors of Victoria at a later period —was peculiarly fitted for the task
he had undertaken. He was a strict disciplinarian, but carried out his
official duties in a benevolent and Christian spirit, and possessed the rare
quality of ruling rather by love than fear. Mr. Bonwick says He arrived
at Flinders Island in March, 1832, and immediately adopted such measures
as tranquillised the minds of the excited savages, and disposed them to
listen to the first lesson in civilisation. By his kind, persuasive manner he
succeeded in effecting some change in the rough habits of his charge;
while, by his determined character, he kept the turbulent in check, and
shielded the gentle and weak. He sought to engage the men in employment,
and the women in domestic cares. The primary difficulty was the want of
water j this he relieved by digging in the Lagoon and in the white sand
of the shore. His policy with respect to the sealers was very decided. He
ordered their absolute withdrawal from eveiy pait of the island, and put
written notices on posts around the coast, warning them, undei penalty,
from approaching the place.”
In the meantime Robinson, with his black associates, had hurried
away to follow up his mission work in the interior of the mainland. His
movements were rapid, and displayed an almost unintenuptcd caicci of success.
At Port Davey he fell in with the tribe whom he had met, and from whom
K


he parted on friendly terms, in 1830, They were now reduced to twenty-
six. Many of these were fine athletic men, upwards of six feet in height.
They at once laid down their weapons, and placed themselves under Robinson’s
protection. Twenty-two more joined him in the south-west corner of the
island, and others in the neighbourhood of Macquarie Harbour, Some of
these small scattered parties presented a wretched appearance from the scars
and wounds they had received from the settlers and their stockmen, who
had driven them back from their usual haunts into a country where there
was little food and where they had to depend chiefly upon a supply of
shellfish for their sustenance. Weary of their miserable existence, they joy-
fully yielded to the Conciliator’s invitations to follow him.
In August of the same year (1832) Mr. Robinson and his original
party of friendly natives were engaged in the north-western districts of the
island. There were four tribes at large in this quarter, three of whom he
had with much difficulty subdued, and placed on West Hunter Island,
where he had a depot preparatory to their removal to Flinders. As in
former cases, the tribes in this part of the island had been reduced to
mere fragments They were in the habit of making incursions into the
estates of the Van Diemen’s Company at Wool worth and other out-stations,
on which occasions they killed the stockmen, and were slaughtered in return
The sealers also had taken away many of their women. In the three tribes
taken there were only twenty-three persons, of whom only three were
children. The fourth tribe, known as the Sandy Cape, or Pieman River
tribe, were more difficult to conquer. Mr. Robinson’s report, dated 14th
September, 1832, contains an interesting narrative of his dangerous adventures
while endeavouring to negotiate with them. He writes to the Govern-
ment ; —“ In my communication with the ‘ Tackine,’ or Sandy Cape natives,
I had to encounter one of the greatest dangers that I had ever been exposed
to during the whole of my long career in the aboriginal service . . . These
people came with the avowed purpose of massacring my aboriginal attendants,
siezing the women and dogs, and then returning to their own country
(between the Arthur and Pieman Rivers) The first indications of their
proximity were discovered on the 31st ultimo, between six and seven miles
north of the Arthur River. From those traces it was apparent that the
natives had returned to their own country. They had been on the war
expedition in quest of the people I had removed ... On my arrival to
within one and a half miles of the river, I halted my people, and formed
an encampment. I sent forward three of the recently captured aboriginals,
with four of my friendly natives, to proceed with all possible celerity, and
to omit no endeavour until they had effected a communication, and which
they considered they could do without my being present. On the 3rd instant


I set out to meet the natives, having the previous evening descried a large
smoke—a signal that my natives had got to them, and which had been
previously agreed upon between me and them. Conceiving that my presence
would give them confidence, I crossed the Arthur River (on a raft) accom-
panied by four of the friendly natives. Soon after I had crossed, a body
of wild natives, well armed with spears, were descried in the woods, and
advancing to where I stood. This was at noon. On their arrival I pro-
posed to cross the river and return to my encampment; but this was objected
to, and it was suggested that we should remain for the night on the south
side of the river, and that the male aborigines should hunt for game.
Previous to setting off on the hunting expedition, I distributed amongst
them presents of beads, knives, boxes, handkerchiefs, &c., with which they
appeared highly delighted. At the time I met these people I was unac-
companied by any but my aboriginal attendants, and without the slightest
means of protection. I sojourned with them for upwards of eighteen hours.
During the whole night I was kept in the most awful suspense that it is
possible to imagine—for it was not until night set in that I was made
acquainted with the extreme danger of my situation. Escape seemed to me
impossible, and every moment I expected to be massacred. I was in the
midst of them. They slept not, but employed themselves in preparing their
spears; some sitting with them across their shoulders, others held them
across their knees, while others kept walking about Their fires were put
out, and they sat by the embers. My aborigines kept their fires in for
the purpose of watching them, and the better to see their spears coming.”
It is not clearly explained in Robinson’s report why the unfriendly blacks
did not proceed to butcher their visitors at once, but it is probable that,
with their usual instinct, they were aware of the presence of a larger party
not far off, and so hesitated to make an attack. The report continues :
“At the earliest dawn of day they made a large fire, around which the
men assembled, and began preparing their weapons intended for my destruction.
At this juncture, one of the wild natives (a relative of one of my friendly
aborigines) commenced a vehement discussion, and argued against the injustice
of killing me, and asked why they wanted to kill their friend and protector
I had by this time put on my raiment. My aboriginal companions were greatly
alarmed, and, on looking for their spears, found that the wild natives had
taken them away during the night. Several of their blankets had also been
stolen, and attempts had been made to tie up the dogs. In the midst of the
discussion I rose up and stood in front of them with my arms folded, thinking
to divert them from their savage purpose. I said if they were not willing to <>o
with me, they could return again to their own country. Scarcely had I spoken
ere they shouted their war-whoop, seized their spears, and proceeded at once


to surround me. With their left hand they grasped a bundle of spears, whilst
in their right they held one. My aborigines shrieked and lied. The natives
had nearly encircled me. Their spears raised were poised in the air. The
friendly aborigines were gone. At this crisis I made off. Although I saw not
the slightest chance of escape, I pursued my way rapidly through some copse,
winding round the acclivity of some low hills, and took a north-east direction
toward an angle of the river, on approaching which I saw one of the friendly
natives (Truganini) who had escaped, who with much trepidation said that
all the rest were killed. At the same instant she descried the hostile blacks
approaching, and in much alarm begged of me to hide, while she swam the river
and went to the encampment. To have attempted concealment at such a
crisis would have been next to suicide; and looking up (for the river had
deep banks on both sides,) I saw one of the wild natives looking for my footsteps.
At this instant he turned, and I lost sight of him. I saw no chance of escape
except by crossing the river. The difficulty seemed insurmountable. I could
not swim. The current was exceedingly rapid, and it required time to construct
a machine. The natives were in strict search after me, and I expected every
moment to be overtaken. The raft on which I came over was nearly a mile
lower down. I was persuaded that the hostile natives would be waiting to
intercept me. I therefore abandoned all thoughts of crossing on this machine.
I made an attempt to cross on a small spar of wood, and was precipitated
into the river and nearly carried away by the current. After repeated attempts,
I succeeded, with the aid of the woman, in getting across.” Truganini performed
a noble feat on this memorable occasion. Always apt in expedient, she made
the spar fast to her body, and thus swam across the river, landing Robinson
in safety on the opposite bank. This was the most remarkable instance on
record of Robinson’s deliverance from a cruel death in the far-off uninhabited
wilderness, whence no authentic account of the disaster would have, perhaps,
ever reached his friends in Hobart. “In all my difficulties (he aftenvards
said,) my sole dependence was on the Omnipotent Being; and, I may truly
say, I was led in the paths I knew not —preserved in danger by His power
alone. Frequently have I seen the sun go down without any expectation of
beholding it again in the morning ; and I have been surrounded by savage
blacks, with their spears presented at me, and have been spared wdien all hope
had fled.
“ When about midway (in the stream) the aborigines made their appear-
ance, and followed my track down to the river, where my clothes were left
behind. I then returned to my encampment, where my son and some natives
were staying. With these I again returned to the river,- and was agreeably
disappointed to find that my aboriginal friends had escaped unhurt, and that
two of the hostile blacks had joined them. The wild natives had assembled


on the opposite bank of the river. Here they continued to exhibit the most
violent gestures, and were exceedingly boisterous in their declamations,
threatening to cross the river and massacre us. From the fugitives I learnt
that when the hostile blacks found that I had escaped, they searched the
bushes, supposing that I had hid myself.” He also learned that it was their
intention to have killed the whole party except the women, and to have
mutilated and burned Robinson’s body, making his ashes into raydee or num.re-
mur-he-kee —amulets worn by the natives. “My exit (he says) from the hands
of these savages was so sudden and so unexpected, that Avith all the vigilance
for Avhich they are so remarkable they scarcely saw me ; and the effect produced
on their credulous minds led them to believe that I was influenced by more
than an ordinary spirit. To this superstitious notion may be attributed, in
a great measure, the preservation of my people’s lives. Failing in their attempt
to kill me, they became suddenly dismayed, and the consequences that Avould
ensue as a punishment caused them greatly to despond, on observing which,
the strangers that now accompanied me reproached and taunted them. They
would not nay-wid-ding-er [i.e., eat much) the nuiu-mer (white man) would
return with plenty of puv-dci-bcu' (guns) and kill them all. Mobile Robinson
and his party were at the banks of the river on the north side, the old
chieftain, "Wyne, with his tribe, stood on the other side, dhe foimei assuied
them that he had no bad feeling towards them, that he forgave them the
attack they had made on his life, and again offered his piotection. Duiing
the intend 6av two more swam across the river and joined Robinson, one of
whom was Kyenrope, the youthful daughter of Wyne. Irritated at the desertion
of these, the old chief put himself in a menacing attitude, and threatened to
come across and murder Robinson, who, to avoid anothei collision, icsoited
to the expedient of making a large fire of green boughs, which sent up a
dense smoke. The wild natives looked upon this as a signal foi assistance,
and at once made off in a southerly direction. Robinson lost no time in
retreating towards the north with his Avhole party, including his four new
followers. Cape Grim, the north-western point of Tasmania, Avas reached after
a journey of forty miles. The Protector now took those who had joined him
in this West Coast expedition, twenty-seven in all, across to Hunter’s Island.
We have already said that a depot had been established on West
Hunter Island for the reception of the north-west tribes prior to their removal
to Flinders. All had now been brought in from that direction except those
Avhom Robinson encountered at the Arthur River; and, as it afterwards turned
out there was also a famdy of seven who had evaded the seaich paities, and
were still at large. The neAV exiles had hardly reached Hunter’s Island before
they were seized with an epidemic, the nature of Avhich Avas not understood.
Within a fortnight thirteen out of the tAventy-seven died. “ This dire malady,”


says Mr. Robinson, in his official report, “had every appearance of an epidemic,
the patient seldom living beyond forty-eight hours after being attacked. All
ages and sexes fell victims to its ravages, and they generally expired in a state
of delirium.” The disease did not attack the natives of the mission party;
it was therefore conjectured that it arose from the removal of the aborigines
from their ancient haunts, the sudden change of diet, and the partial adoption
of European habits. About this period it seemed as though the whole race
was to be utterly extinguished from other causes than war, butchery, and
famine. They suffered physically from mental irritation, produced by the troubles
and vicissitudes which had fallen upon them. They became desponding and
dejected when they were driven back from the Kangaroo grounds in broken
families, and when all hope of recovering possession of the country had forsaken
them. Few, if any, increases by birth took place, and those who escaped
the deadly bullet were rapidly dying off, both at Flinders and in the recesses of
the forest, before they laid down their spears.
During the years 1833 and 1834 Robinson was actively engaged in
conciliating the natives who were still at large. In 1833, forty-two were
brought in from various parts of the island. They were the vestiges of tribes
that had disappeared gradually from different causes until only a few of each
were left, who had resolutely stood out to the last. The persuasive eloquence
of the Protector induced them to abandon their haunts and follow him; but
it was not without great difficulty, trial, and suffering, that the mission party
succeeded in gathering together those scattered remnants.*
On the 10th of January, 1833, Mr. Cottrell, one of Robinson’s coadjutors,
went along the western coast in search of the chieftain, Wyne, and his tribe,
from whom Robinson had to fly at the Arthur River in the latter part of
the previous year. Cottrell fell in with them near the Pieman River. Writing
* Some of the natives captured in 1833 were sent to Flinders Island in the Government schooner “ Shamrock,”
which sailed from Hobart on the 22nd November in that year, having on board Messrs. Backhouse and Walker, the
Quaker missionaries. The latter gentleman has left an interesting record of the aborigines that were on board
“ They came on board at an early hour, and we dropped down the river with the tide ; but after beating about the
greater part of the day with an adverse wind, came to anchor in the mouth of D’Entrecasteaux Channel. 23rd. The
poor aborigines are to be commisserated, having to sleep on the deck during these damp, cold nights. When the
vessel gets to Port Arthur, and discharges her cargo, they will have a portion of the hold to sleep in. This party
of natives appears to be as uncultivated as any we have encountered, but they are quiet and tractable. The only
man amongst them has a black beard and mustache, and a countenance strikingly Jewish. I never contemplate his
visage long together but lam forcibly reminded of the descendants of Abraham. They are all excessively fond of
their dogs, hugging them like children, carrying them in their bosoms, and allowing them to lick their faces.
. . . We saw some of the women dive for fish. They appear to be half amphibious, such is their dexterity in the
water; and what is singular, they appear to float with their heads in an upright position above water, without any
effort, and this in the midst of kelp and other seaweed that would terrify the generality of skilful swimmers. They
put aside the weed with their hands, or lift it over their heads as it becomes wrapt round them, and fearlessly dive,
head foremost, into the midst of it, passing the branches of kelp through their handle as a sailor would a rope;
until, as they continue to descend, a crayfish arrests their sight, when, seizing it by the back, they ascend promptly
to the surface, where they readily disengage themselves from the kelp and weed, and throw the prey to their
companions on shore


to the Protector on the 19th, he says: “We fell in with the tribe that
attacked you at the Arthur River, Old Wyne and Edick were with them.
They remained with us all night, and agreed to accompany us to Macquarie
Harbour; but when we had marched about four miles on the following day,
they disappeared amongst some scrub.” It was not until April in the following
year (1834) that Robinson finally succeeded in taking this tribe. On 28th
February eight gave themselves up to him. Three others followed on the
14th March, and the remaining nine on 12th April. Of these twenty there
were seven men, five women, and eight younger persons of both sexes. They
were placed in safety on Hunter’s Island, and sent from thence to Flinders.
It was now generally believed that all the wild aborigines had been
brought in from the forest and that peace would reign throughout Tasmania;
but a few more made their appearance in the interior of the country.
Their haunts were in the mountainous district west of the Forth and Mersey
Rivers. It was in the winter season when Robinson and his party went
in search of them. They proceeded along a rough bridle track as far as
Middlesex Plains, and then diverged to the south, directed by the distant
smoke of what seemed to be the watch-fires of the savages. The country
over which they had to pass was a succession of deep rocky ravines, and
lofty mountains covered with snow. The friendly natives, unaccustomed to
such a severe climate, with freezing gusts of wind and sleet driving across
their path, shuddered at the contemplation of proceeding onward ; but when
they saw the smoke rising from the camping places of their countrymen on
the distant ranges, and listened to the words of their indomitable leader,
urging them on to the final fulfilment of their noble mission, they took courage
and pressed on, enduring hardships and privations which cannot be adequately
portrayed. In Robinson’s letter of the 2nd October, 1834, he says : —“ For seven
successive days we continued travelling over one solid body of snow, in which the
natives were frequently up to their middle.” Their legs and arms were bruised and
lacerated through clambering over sharp rocks and forcing their way through
prickly vines and almost impenetrable scrub. At last, on 28th December, 1834,
they came upon the unhappy fugitives at the extreme western bluff. “ The moment
these poor creatures saw our natives advancing (wrote the leader) they' ran forward,
and embraced them in a most affecting manner.” The party consisted of only eight
individuals, of whom there were four women, one man, and three boys. They had
with them thirty dogs. During an interesting conversation which Robinson and
the friendly natives held with these unhappy people when they first met, they
assured their captor that they had long desired to give themseves up in order to
join their relatives and friends who had been taken; but when they ventured within
sight of a white man’s dwelling, they were fired on by the stockmen, and pursued
to the mountains.


This was Robinson’s last great exploit. He brought the party to Hobart,
arriving there on the 22nd of January, 1835. It was then, for the first time, that
the writer of this narrative had an opportunity of seeing the Tasmanian aborigines in
their primitive condition. They were sojourning for a few days at the rear of Mr.
Robinson’s house in Upper Elizabeth Street, and he kindly permitted a party of
friends to be present at a long interview with those interesting people. Mr,
Robinson and his followers were greatly fatigued with their protracted and unusually
severe expedition, but they were nevertheless cheerful and happy in the knowledge
that their mission had been fulfilled—that complete success had attended their
operations, all the blacks having been brought in without the shedding of one drop
of blood on either side. Truganini and her husband Wooreddi, Manalagana and
his noble wife, Tanlebouyer, with the other less notable but equally faithful natives
who had accompanied Robinson in all his wanderings, were present on this
occasion. Notwithstanding all the hardships they had encountered, they exhibited
no loss of physical energy, but were lively and cheerful still. Truganini, who was
about twenty-three years old, displayed the same vivacity which has been ascribed
to her by all writers of native history. The powerful and well-formed figure of
the celebrated chief, Manalagana, was conspicuous amongst the crowd for his manly
and commanding person. The people who had been just brought in from the wilds
maintained a sullen reserve and somewhat melancholy aspect; they remained
lounging in the shade of an outhouse, surrounded by their dogs. Manalagana and
his countrymen entertained the visitors by exhibiting their skill in using the spear,
piercing distant objects with wonderful precision. Their conversation in the native
language —now extinct —was perhaps the most interesting feature of this visit.
Truganini and Wooreddi, at Mr, Robinson’s request, sang a few couplets of a native
song, the modulations of which were soft and harmonious. The preponderance of
vowels in almost every word gave a softness to the intonation, which led
Labillardiere to remark that there was a striking analogy between the songs of the
Tasmanian natives and those of the Arabs in Asia Minor. The same pleasant
memories of the lost language are recorded by several writers. Mr. Calder, in his
little book entitled “Habits, Customs, &c., of the Native Tribes” (1876,) says :
“ Their language, which is all but lost, was peculiarly soft; and, except when
excited by anger or surprise, was spoken in something of a singing tone, producing
a strange but pleasing effect on the sense of the European.”
It is impossible to look back at the faithful services of that little band
without a feeling of sadness at the unprofitable results which followed. It is true
that the settlers were more speedily delivered from a constant source of annoyance
and danger, while the miserable remnant of the race were spared to live and die in
peace; but the sequel will show that their final extinction was not less certain.
Robinson and his followers had performed herculean feats of pedestrianism during
the period they were employed in their mission of peace, namely, from January,


1830, to January, 1835. They walked four thousand miles over the roughest and
wildest country imaginable. Often were they for days and nights forcing their way
through dense horizontal scrubs, where the dripping foliage, through which the sun
never penetrated, and slimy trunks of prostrate trees, drenched their bodies and
impeded their progress. Sometimes a mile would be the extent of their day’s
journey over some wild ravine, thickly overgrown with tangled vines climbing over
rocks and branches of fallen trees, and forming such an impervious mass that it
was impossible to pass along without immense labour and difficulty. On other
occasions rain had swollen the mountain torrents to such an extent that they were
impassable on foot, while the current ran so strong that rafts of timber could not
be used for crossing in safety. Added to this, a supply of food could not be
obtained in the inhospitable forests which produced no pasture, and even the birds
and wild animals shunned as unfit for habitation. These were a few of the
difficulties which beset that heroic band of adventurers in their efforts to reach the
distant haunts of some fugitive tribe who had been driven from the settled
districts.
The country was now at rest. Out of the six or seven thousand aborigines
who inhabited the island when it was first occupied by the whites, only about
two hundred remained. The last eight who had been brought in were sent
to join their countrymen at Flinders Island. They were shortly afterwards
joined by the friendly natives and by Robinson, who was appointed Commandant
of the native settlement of Wybalenna (Black Man’s Village.) Manalagana
died on the island in the following year. Truganini lived to be the last of her
race. Her chequered career will be recorded as we proceed. It may be
mentioned here that for some few years it was supposed that not one aboriginal
inhabitant of Tasmania remained at large; but it was afterwards discovered
that one family had escaped the vigilance of the search parties. It consisted
of father and mother, about fifty years of age, and five children of the ages
from childhood to maturity. About the year 1840 they were seen near one
of the Van Diemen’s Land Company’s out-stations at the north-west corner
of the island, and at intervals they made their appearance between Table Cape
and Woolnorth, but invariably shunned the white people. At last, however,
in 1842, they resolved to give themselves up. A sealer happened to touch on
the west coast; he had an interview with the savages, and ultimately persuaded
them to accompany him in his boat to Launceston, from which place they were
sent to Flinders. The youngest boy, aged seven, became celebrated afterwards
in native history. He was William Lanney, or “ King Billy,” who lived to be
the last man of his race. The capture of this family created no sensation, for
they had been quiet and inoffensive, living in seclusion on the western coast,
and having no intercourse with the whites. While they remained in Launceston,
awaiting their removal to Flinders, the junior members of the family played


with the white children on the Market Square, and quickly acquired domestic
habits. When Mr. Robinson had completed his mission, there were great public
rejoicings throughout the colony, as well there might be, for then ceased one
of the most barbarous systems of guerilla warfare that ever disgraced a civilised
country. Mr. Robinson received high honours for his noble exploits. Besides
enjoying the hearty gratitude of the whole community, he was rewarded by
large grants of land and sums of money amounting altogether to about £BOOO.
While the settlers were now enjoying a respite from those dangers by which
they had been surrounded, the more kind-hearted and philanthropic of the colonists
were anxiously watching the fate of the natives on Flinders Island, as accounts were
constantly reaching Hobart and Launceston that they were rapidly dying off. Messrs.
James Backhouse and George Washington Walker have left some very interesting
records of the condition of the settlement in its early days. These devoted
missionaries visited Flinders Island in October, 1832, and again in November, 1833.
From Mr. Walker’s diary we quote the following particulars of the place under
Lieutenant Darling’s superintendence : —“We had been there (at the landing place)
but a very short time before the Commandant, Ensign William J. Darling, came on
board. He is quite a young man, little more than of age, tall and of agreeable
countenance and prepossessing manners. We landed on a fine sandy beach.
Many of the aborigines were on shore : they did not press forward to gaze at us as
is common with Europeans. We went up to them and shook hands with several.
They looked healthy and cheerful, notwithstanding the straitness of provisions
from which they had suffered ; and their countenances exhibited none of that
marked ferocity which has been ascribed to them. They are lodged
in three rude dwellings, called ‘ break winds,’ which are merely sloping roofs
reaching to the ground, formed of boughs, and closed at the ends. They are
surrounded on three sides by a fence of boughs. There are forty-four men,
twenty-nine women, and five children on the establishment. They are rather
below the average stature of Englishmen. Both sexes are stout, and their limbs
well proportioned. They walk remarkably erect, assuming a dignified mien,
and in all their movements exhibit agility and ease. Their complexion is very
dark—almost black; a few are of a lighter hue, approaching to the colour of
copper; the soles of their feet are as light as those of Europeans who go
without shoes; the palms of their hands are also much lighter than their
bodies. There is considerable variety of feature among them; generally, thick
lips and flat, distended nostrils are the characteristics of the race. Many of
their countenances are pleasing, and very few of them forbidding. Their hair is
uniformly black and woolly, like the African negroes, whom, in most respects,
they nearly resemble. In their savage state, the men let . their hair grow, and
ornament it, as they conceive, with grease and red ochre; the women shave their
heads; and neither sex wear any article of clothing, but they are fond of


besmearing their bodies with grease and ochre, which enables them to
bear with more ease the exposure to the weather. They make incisions on
their persons, particularly the thighs, arms, and breasts. This is done with a
sharp flint, so as generally to form longitudinal lines parallel to each other. The
wounds are kept open until proud flesh is formed, and a lasting protuberant
scar produced. ... We were present, on the evening of our arrival, when
supper was served out to the natives. The meal consisted of biscuit, boiled
rice, and tea; of the latter they are immoderately fond, the sweeter the better.
I was surprised and pleased at the decorum with which each advanced in
succession and received the allotted portion. ... As soon as it w T as dark,
preparations were made for a ‘ corroborree,’ or dance, for joy at the arrival of
the cutter. These are seasons of great excitement, attended with much exertion,”
The dance is described in a former page, Mr, Walker observed that the women,
who occasionally joined in the dance, make no alteration in their adopted dress ;
but the men had not yet been prevailed upon to retain their clothing. Still,
though the exhibition in a state of nudity must necessarily offend the eye of a
European, there was not the slightest action or gesture that would offend the
modesty of the most scrupulous.
The missionaries remained a week on the island, observing the manners
and habits of the blacks. “An increased acquaintance with the aborigines (wrote
Mr. Walker) only confirms us in the favourable opinion we had formed of them.
They appear to be very sociable people, and act remarkably in concert. The
occupation of one is generally the occupation of all, whether in their amusements
or their engagements of a graver nature. If a stranger accosts them in their
own language, or by any other means affords them gratification, they express
their pleasure by a simultaneous shout, so universal that one would imagine
that they were actuated by the heart of one man Through the influence of
the Commandant, the people have conformed to many regulations that conduce
to their comfort and welfare.” In the course of the evening the visitors went
to the native huts. At the suggestion of the doctor, they sang two of their
songs, which are thus described : “ The first was sung by a chief of the
Port Dalrymple tribe. I observed that the same words were repeated many
times in succession, accompanied by many impassioned gestures, and so much
exertion of breath as was almost painful to witness. Occasionally he gave a
short sigh, as if his breath was spent, in which the rest united with one accord.
The shout that succeded allowed the performer a moment’s pause, when he
resumed the song with great animation. A great deal of character was displayed
in the course of this exhibition, the chief often becoming highly excited, pointing
significantly with his finger, and showing remarkable expression in his coun-
tenance, as if the subject of the song was one of a most important nature,
the people meanwhile listening with profound attention. A short time after


the chief had concluded, the women began a song in chorus, which showed
a greater knowledge of music; and I was very much surprised to hear some
sing tenor, while others sang treble, which, to those who know anything of music,
will appear strange, because the power of doing so denotes some advancement
in the art.
“ The tribes now show little appearance of jealousy. Many, when in the
bush, were in a state of hostility; but their animosities are merged in the general
feeling of goodwill that seems to pervade the settlement. If there is anything that
betrays the remembrance of former feuds, it is with reference to hunting. They
show some reluctance to hunt together if the tribes that compose the party have
once been at warfare, unless the Commandant or surgeon be with them, when his
influence is considered a sufficient guarantee against harm. They seem to be aware
that these are times of high excitement, when they might be off their guard, and
quarrels might ensue. Two men of the western tribe exhibited before us the man-
ner in which quarrels are decided amongst them ; or it may be described as the
mode of giving vent to those feelings of irritation which, among Englishmen, would
terminate in a pugilistic encounter. The parties approach one another face to face
and, folding their arms across their breasts, shake their heads (which occasionally
come in contact) in each other’s faces, uttering at the same time the most vociferous
and angry expressions, until one or other of them is exhausted, or his feelings of
anger subside. This custom is called by them ‘ growling,’ and from the specimen
afforded us by the western lads, will not probably issue in anything worse than a
bloody lip or nose. Quarrels are rare among the aborigines of the settlement; but
some of their tokens of displeasure, when they do arise, are very odd and unac-
countable. One of the men differed with his wife because she had broken a bottle,
or some other article which he highly prized. Instead of showing his displeasure by
taking up a stick and retaliating on the offender, he arose and deliberately cut the
feet of seven women who happened to be lying near him asleep, but offered no
violence to his wife. After this burst of rage, his anger was appeased, and they
became reconciled. The aborigines on occasions of this sort do not generally show
a disposition to retaliate on the person who thus wreaks his vengeance on them;
they rather endeavour to get out of the way. This circumstance, however, came to
the Commandant’s ears, and he thought proper to notice it, and inflict some punish-
ment on the man who thus injured so many innocent women. He caused him to
be brought before him, and made him to understand that he was much displeased ;
and as the women, through his misconduct, were unable to bring their quantum of
water from the well, the offender was required to bring all the water himself.
Without saying a word or making the least difficulty, the man set about his task,
which he soon completed, and there the whole affair ended.”
On this visit of the missionary Friends to Flinders Island in 1832, the Black
Settlement of Wybalenna had not been established. The encampment was situated


in a damp, low-lying place near the Lagoons, fifteen miles south of the spot which
had been selected for the future settlement. Messrs. Backhouse and Walker
journeyed through the bush, accompanied by the Commandant and some of the
natives, to inspect the proposed site. Mr. Walker wrote in his journal (13th
October, 1832): —" For some distance before we reached the spot, the richness of
the soil and verdure of the grass that clothed the fine open plain that lay before
us convinced us that, in these respects, the situation looked forward to as the site
of the new settlement was greatly superior to the old one.” A soldier and two men
were erecting huts for the future establishment, and an acre of ground had been
fenced and was in cultivation as a garden. The missionaries had a further oppor-
tunity of observing the character of the natives while they were out on this
excursion. “ The favourable opinion we had previously entertained of their
dispositions, and especially of the capabilities they evince for improvement, is more
than ever confirmed. There is nothing servile or abject in their conduct when they
are not under the influence of fear. We are perpetually reminded that in their taste
for amusements, and in some respects in their capacities, they are children. But
in many things that occur within the range of their knowledge and acquirements,
they show a quickness of perception, and powers of reflection, that prove them to
be far from deficient in intellect.” Inquiry was made as to the condition of the
native women who were in possession of sealers on the adjacent islands. Mr.
Walker ascertained that some had been forcibly carried off) without reference to
their inclinations. He says : —“ The testimony of several of the women who have
lived with sealers, but who have either run away or been removed at their own
desire, confirms the reports as to the ill-treatment they have experienced from these
men. We put some questions to these poor creatures last evening, and especially
to one named Boatswain, which, from the answers they drew forth, may throw some
light upon the subject. When we asked her if the sealers beat their women, she
answered ‘Very much.’ She was requested to describe the manner in which they
were beaten, and she went through several pantomimic exhibitions, in which she
gave us to understand that she had been tied up and flogged in the way that is
common among prisoners who are offenders, whilst she uttered many piteous
exclamations indicative of the severity of the punishment. Another mode of
chastisement she described as being practised was to beat them on the back and
legs with a large stick—and while she represented herself as undergoing this punish-
ment, she seemed to sink to the ground, exclaiming several times, f Oh, I will clean
the mutton birds better,’ until at last she was quite spent through exhaustion. The
other women who were present corroborated these statements ; and one and all,
when the question was put to them, declared they would not return to the
sealers.”
In November, 1833, the missionaries again visited Flinders Island at the
request of Governor Arthur, in order to inquire into and report upon certain


disputes which had arisen between some of the officers of the establishment. They
found that the new settlement of Wybalenna was now occupied. The habitations
of the natives consisted of several neat cottages, built of wattle and daub, with
thatch roofs, and whitewashed. Several parties of aborigines had been added to
the exiles; yet the mortality had been so great that the number had not increased.
Those who remained had made great progress in the arts of domestic life. Lieu-
tenant Darling was still Commandant. Messrs. Backhouse and Walker interviewed
the aborigines, who welcomed their return with expressions of delight. On the first
day of the week the natives were drawn up in trout of their huts, according to
usual custom, to be examined by the Commandant. The men were arrayed in
linen jackets and trousers, very white and clean from the laundry of the females.
The women wore linen and cotton dresses with stuff petticoats and corsets, all the
group presenting a clean and tidy appearance. During the month of December
the travellers sailed for Launceston in the “ Shamrock,” which was despatched
thither for provisions. They returned in her on the 30th, and took final leave of
the natives and white people at Wybalenna on the sth January, 1834.
During the latter year, several official changes were made in the admin-
istration of affairs at Flinders. Mr. Henry Nicholls was appointed Superin-
tendent ; Mr. Robert Clark, Catechist; Mr. Loftus Dickenson, Storekeeper;
and Mr. Allen, Surgeon. The Rev. Thomas Dove was appointed Chaplain
at a later period. In November, 1835, Mr. Robinson, who had been appointed
Commandant of the settlement, took personal charge of the natives at Wybalenna.
He at once proceeded to carry out whatever reforms were deemed necessary
for the health and comfort of the people; for he excelled not only in his
executive, but in his administrative capacity. He established an Aboriginal
Fund, which was raised from the proceeds of work performed, and the sale
of various articles prepared by them. He also formed a Native Police Force,
to preserve order ; introduced a circulating medium amongst them, which gave
them a knowledge of the rights of property, and, in furtherance of this object,
he established a market, to which they brought their produce. Thus they
acquired the habits of civilised life, and felt an interest in the acquisition of
property, all of which tended to divert their attention from dismal broodings
over the past; and by thus turning their attention to industrial pursuits, they
were rendered more happy and contented. In the latter part of 1836, a weekly
newspaper, entitled the Aboriginal Flinders Island Chronicle, written on half
a sheet of foolscap, by native editors, was published on Saturdays, price 2d.
The profits from the work were divided among the contributors. This modest
indulgence in literary pursuits acted as an incentive to the young of both sexes,
who were assiduously pursuing their studies in the minor .branches of a plain
English education. The newspaper, however, did not long survive. Perhaps
the editors had gone to the grave, like many of their countrymen.


This attempt to civilise the remnant of the race seemed plausible enough.
Every effort was made to promote their comfort and happiness. Schools were
established in which they were taught to read and write, and Mr. and Mrs.
Clark, assisted afterwards by the Rev. Thomas Dove, a Presbyterian clergyman,
imparted a knowledge of the truths of Christianity. In one of Robinson’s
reports, he says :—“ At the periodical examination of the schools, some of the
native youths were able to answer questions in the leading events of Scripture
history, Christian doctrine and duty, arithmetic, the principal facts of geography,
and also on several points of useful information. Some very fair specimens
of handwriting were exhibited on such occasions—one, in particular, was worthy
of notice, being an original address from the writer, a native youth of fifteen
years of age, who was employed by me in my office, to his countrymen. It
was expressed in simple and tolerably correct language, and breathed a warm
spirit of gratitude to myself. In the schools they were taught various handi-
work, such as knitting in worsted, sewing, &c.; and they proved to be apt
and industrious scholars.” No restraint was placed upon them when they
wished to indulge in the sports of hunting kangaroo and wallaby, with which
the island abounded, or of catching the fish that swarmed along the coast.
These old habits, however, were almost entirely abandoned in their new home.
They were provided with food and raiment, and therefore all incentive to search
for the means of sustenance had disappeared. But there were other reasons
still more potent. The enforced associations of mixed tribes, whom bitter feuds
had separated from social intercourse when they were at large in their own
country, was a great cause of discomfort to them when they resided together
on Flinders Island. There were three distinct dialects spoken by the natives
of the eastern, north-western, and southern divisions of Tasmania, so that, even
in their language, they suffered a degree of estrangement which operated
detrimentally to genuine friendship and harmony. Broken English was the
language spoken at Flinders, but it became infused with some of their own
words, so that the very act of exchanging their thoughts was attended with
difficulty and some degree of sadness. The want of the pure, dancing stream-
lets and rivers of their native country affected them much. The settlement
was nine miles away from the low-lying tea-tree swamps known as " The
Lagoons; ” but they had no fresh water to drink except such as was obtained
by digging holes in the ground, through which a supply permeated; but the
holes did not tap crystal springs of the pure element, and the water they
drank was consequently unwholesome. Apart from this, the poetry of their
native streams had possessed their souls, for when they spoke of their old
haunts beside the rushing rivers they were filled with grief. * The rivers were
* John Mitchell, one of the political exiles who had been transported in 1849, thus wrote of the River
Shannon, a Tasmanian river“ All my life long I have delighted in rivers, rivulets, rills,—fierce torrents, tearing


a delight to them in their wandering bush life ; their homes were by the
rivers, and the tribes were called by the names of the streams they frequented.
No wonder, therefore, that they felt sorrowful in a land where the music of
the rivers was never heard.
Notwithstanding the care and attention bestowed on the aborigines by Mr.
Robinson and his associates, they continued rapidly to decline. Many perished
from that strange disease called nostalgia, so often fatal to the soldiers and
peasants of Switzerland, who die in foreign lands from home-sickness. They were
in sight of Tasmania, their native home ; and (the historian, West, says,) “ When
they beheld its not distant, but forbidden shore, they were often deeply melan-
choly.” Mr. Barnes, surgeon, who gave evidence before a Parliamentary Com-
mittee of the House of Commons, stated that more than half died, not from any
positive disease, but from a sickness which affected the stomach, and came on
entirely from a desire to return to their own country. These peculiar symptoms
were observed by all who took an interest in the captives. The late Mr. R. H.
Davies, of the Mersey, who frequently visited Flinders Island in 1835 and 1836, in
a Government schooner which he commanded at that time, was impressed with a
conviction that the native race would become extinct ere many years. “ They were
treated (he writes) with uniform kindness; nevertheless, the births have been few,
and the deaths numerous. This may have been in a great measure owing to their
change of living and food, but more so to their banishment from the mainland,
which is visible from Flinders Island; and the natives have often pointed it out to
me with expressions of the deepest sorrow depicted on their countenances.”
We must now pass rapidly on to narrate the decay and final extinction of
the race. Matters went smoothly at Flinders, and the survivors had attained to a
considerable degree of civilisation ; but so great was the mortality, with hardly any
increase by birth, that it had become painfully apparent to the most sanguine that
the race would soon become utterly extinct. This decadence had, of course, a
depressing effect upon those who remained. When Captain Stokes, of H.M. survey
ship “Beagle,” visited the island in 1842, he found that out of the 200 that had been
captured, 150 had perished. Before Governor Arthur left Tasmania, in 1836, he
was sensible that death had marked the whole of the unhappy race for his prey,
and, in the hope of prolonging their lives, had fourteen of the younger ones removed
their rocky beds—gliding, dimpled brooks, kissing a daisied marge. The tinkle, or murmur, or raving roar of running
water is, of all sounds my ears ever hear now, the most homely. Nothing else in this land looks or sounds like home.
The birds have a foreign tongue; the very trees whispering to the wind whisper in accents unknown to me, for the
gum-tree leaves are all hard, horny, polished as the laurel; besides they have neither upper nor under side, but are
set on with the plane of them vertical; wherefore they can never, never let breeze, pipe, or zephyr breathe as it will—
never can they whisper, quiver, sigh, or sing, as do the beeches and sycamores of old Eosstrevor. Yes. all sights and
sounds of nature are alien and outlandish, save only the sparkle and the music of the streams. Well I know the voice
of this eloquent river: it talks to me, and to the woods and rocks, in the same tongud and dialect wherein the Roe
discoursed to me, a child. In its crystalline gush my heart and brain are bathed, and I hear, in its plaintive chime, all
the blended voices of history. or]prophecy, and poesy, from the beginning.”


from the island and sent to the Orphan School, at Hobart. Here they displayed
the same tendency, and several died in their early years.
Sir John Franklin, who succeeded Governor Arthur in the administration of
the government, took a deep interest in the blacks. Twenty-nine male survivors
addressed a petition in 1838 to his Excellency, praying that they and their wives
might be removed to the mainland of Port Phillip, to which place Mr. Robinson was
about to go, as Protector of Aborigines, under an appointment from the New South
Wales Government. Sir John was willing to consent, but the authorities of the
sister colony objected to the introduction of the poor creatures who remained of the
Tasmanian race, erroneously deeming them dangerous, and unfit to be let at
large in Australia. When Robinson went away on his new mission they sank
into a deeper degree of despondency than they manifested while he remained
with them. Governor Franklin visited the settlement in 1843, accompanied
by the Bishop of Tasmania and the benevolent and large-hearted Lady Franklin.
It was now decided that, in order to save the miserable fragment of the race
that remained, they must be removed from Flinders Island ; but the difficulty
was-where to place them; for, at the mere mention of removing them to their
native country, some of the colonists were loud in their remonstrances, declaring
that the sanguinary deeds of the past would be revived, and the country districts
would be up in arms once more. In deference to this folly, their removal was
postponed for years.
At length, in October, 1847, to their great delight, the natives were
taken from Flinders Island and placed at Oyster Cove. There were only twelve
men, twenty-two women, and ten children, and some of these were half-castes.
Six children were sent to the Orphan School ; the rest were transferred to
quarters that had been prepared for them. Oyster Cove is situated in D’Entre-
casteaux Channel, near the estuary of the Derwent, lying west from Bruny
Island. The buildings in which the blacks were lodged formed once a penal
establishment, and still bore the gaol-like aspect about them, in keeping with
the purpose for which they were designed. Mr. Robert Clark, their faithful
teacher at Wybalenna, was placed in charge of the Oyster Cove Settlement.
For a time they were as happy and contented in their new home as circumstances
would admit. They had plenty of provisions, weie able to till their gardens,
sow peas, beans, potatoes, and occasionally to earn money, of which, at this
time, they knew the value. The women made all their own clothes, cooked
their food, and kept their houses comfortable and clean. This happy condition,
however, did not last long. The Native Reserve at Oyster Cove was frequently
visited by sawyers, splitters, and the sailors of wood boats trading between
Hobart and the Huon, who carried drink to the natives. Mr. and Mrs. Clark
used every effort to put a stop to this piactice, and so deep was the esteem
and respect of the blacks toward their excellent protectors, that they did abstain


from falling into vicious habits for a time; but after a time Mrs. Clark became
ilb was removed to Hobart, where she died. Mr. Clark’s frequent absence
on that occasion caused a break in the discipline he had hitherto maintained.
The grief ho suffered at the loss of his partner affected Mr. Clark’s health
so severely that he soon followed her to the grave. Hie blacks mourned
over the loss of this estimable pair with feelings bordering on despair. Another
Protector was appointed, but he possessed no influence over the natives ; they
became hopelessly indifferent to that decorum which had marked their career
during their captivity, and indulged in vices which hastened their extinction.
Out of the forty-four who came from Flinders in 1847, only three men, eleven
women, and two boys remained in 1854.
In 1859, Mr. Bonwick paid a visit to the blacks at Oyster Cove, and
found the miserable remnant of the race in a very deplorable condition. In
his last publication, “ The Lost Tasmanian Race,” he has given an account
of what he saw: —“ A collection of huts and out-buildings, the ruins of an
old penal establishment, profoundly dirty, and swarming with fleas.” Here
the blacks dwelt in separate apartments, with earthen floors, some of which
had parts of wooden planking remaining ; the roofs not waterproof, the windows
broken, the doors difficult to open or shut, the furniture gone, and the beds
in a deplorable condition, and not sufficient bed-clothing. The Superintendent
called one of the women, and inquired where all the blankets had gone. She
replied: “ Bad white fellow, him steal’em all.” But he explained to the visitor
that “they were so given up to drink as to sell for liquor the Government
blankets, and even their clothing, to the low population about.” No fence
enclosed the Native Reserve. They were allowed to ramble over the bush,
and they sometimes remained absent for days, on which occasions they generally
returned in improved health. The diseases from which they suffered arose from
neglected colds, caused, as they believed, by the climate and confinement of
Flinders Island.
At this time there were three married native couples at the station—Augus-
tus and his wife, Bessy Clark, the latter under forty years of age, and “ the best
looking of the sisterhood ” She had been under the “protection ”of the English
from early childhood. When Mr. Robinson and his son, with the friendly natives,
were seeking after the Macquarie Harbour tribe, a family were disturbed round
their fire so suddenly that the mother in her fright forgot her child. The infant
was placed on the back of young Robinson, and was ultimately confided to the care
of a native woman on Flinders Island. When old enough, she was sent for educa-
tion and training to the Orphan School at New Town, near Hobart, and was
afterwards removed to Flinders. This was Bessy Clark. Tippo Saib and his wife,
Flora, were both surviving; the former was old, feeble, and nearly blind. And
lastly, Jackcy and his wife, Patty. Of Jackey, Mr. Bonwick says : — “I regret to


say that Jackey was much advanced in one civilised habit —that of indulgence in
strong drink. This was, unfortunately, the cause of his death —being drowned
when returning drunk from Hobart Town, in May, 18(31. Patty, whose native
name was Cooneana, died in July, 1867, at the supposed age of seventy. In addition
to these three married couples, there were other women whose husbands were
dead—Emma, somewhat younger than Patty, once of the Patrick’s Head tribe ;
Caroline, relict of the renowned chieftain, Poumetewah, of the Big Elver tribe ;
Sophia, apparently over sixty years of age, with white ‘hair and forbidding
countenance, a native of Bruny Island; Wapperty, of the Patrick’s Head tribe,
whose native name had been Woonoteah-coota-mena (Thunder and Lightning ;) and
the celebrated Truganini, whose wonderful career has been chronicled in many a
page of native history. Mr. Bonwick observes :—“ Laughing little Lalla Eookh, or
Truganini, was my especial favourite of the party. She acted among the rest as if
she were indeed the sultana. She was then much over fifty years of age, and pre-
served some of those graces which made her beauty a snare in olden days . . 1
Her coquetry reminded me of the faded loveliness of French courts ; and, as she
stood smirking and smiling beside me, I thought of the septuagenarian admirer
of Voltaire. Her features, in spite of her bridgeless nose, were decidely pleasing
when lighted up by her sparkling black eye and animated conversation.” There
were two young men still living in 1859, one of whom, Walter George Arthur (so
called after Governor Arthur,) was married to a half-caste, and resided on his own
land near Oyster Cove; and William Lanne, who was afterwards known as “The
Last Man ”of his race. He was twenty-four years of age in 1859, and had chosen
to earn his living as sailor,
Walter George Arthur was an exceedingly intelligent young man. About
the year 1841 he married a half-caste girl, named Maryann Cochrane, whose
father was one of the early sealers of the Straits. This man stole Maryann’s
mother from her forest home, was a kind husband to her, and a fairly attentive
father to the offspring of the union; but when Mr, Kobinson made his raid upon
the Straits men in 1832, Maryann, then a child, was transplanted to Flinders. In
Captain Stokes’ narrative of the voyage of the “ Beagle ” he records his visit to
Flinders Island in 1842, and thus refers to the young couple :— <f Walter and Mary-
ann, a married couple who had recently returned from Port Phillip, where they had
been living in the family of the former superintendent, Mr. Kobinson, were so
civilised and proficient in all the plain parts of education, that they possessed great
influence over their countrymen, who, incited by the contemplation of their
superiority, were apparentl}' desirous of acquiring knowledge. Ihe barracks in
which the natives dwell form a square of good stone buildings, but Walter and his
wife have a separate cottage, with a piece of land attached. Maryann is a very
tolerable needlewoman, and capable of teaching the others.” When the Flinders Set-
tlement was broken up, Walter and his wife were taken to Oyster Cove with the


rest of the natives, where he obtained one hundred acres of land from the Govern-
ment, and upon which he built his cottage. The late Mr. Calder, Surveyor-General,
was once asked if the blacks of Tasmania were capable of true civilisation ? The
answer to his correspondent was as follows : —“ My reply is, Yes I undoubtedly ;
and I give as an example the case of Walter George Arthur, a Tasmanian aboriginal,
whom I knew well, who was captured when a mere infant, and was brought up and
educated at the Queen’s Orphan School. His ideas were English, and
there was not the smallest dash of the savage in him. He was a very conversable
man, fond of reading, and spoke and wrote English quite grammatically. His
spelling was also quite correct. This man had a hundred acres of land, and knew
his rights in relation thereto quite as well as you do yours. An instance of this,
quite as creditable to his acuteness, sense of right, and of honourable feelings, was
related to me by our old friend Bennison, the surveyor. One of Arthur’s neigh-
bours was a grasping and rather unprincipled fellow, who took Arthur for a person
with whom he might do as he pleased, and encroached on a cultivated part of his
land, which Arthur had no idea of suffering. So, after expostulating with him to
no purpose, he employed and paid Bennison to re-survey his land, which was done
in presence of both litigants. This operation proved that Arthur was right, and
that he knew his proper boundaries quite well. And when he saw that his oppo-
nent was satisfied, he said to him: “Well, Mr. , though you have tried to wrong
me, I will treat you very differently from what I believe you would have done to
me if I were in your place. You can come on to my land and remove your crop
when it is ripe.”
When the author of “ The Lost Tasmanian Bace ” visited Oyster Cove,
he found Walter and his wife living in much comfort on their farm. Arthur
might have been “selected as a model for his magnificent head. His nose
was depressed—a characteristic of his tribe ; but his eye was of even unusual
expressiveness. His general aspect was one of seriousness and melancholy.”
Maryann “had the appearance of her mixed race. Her delicate hand, her
dark eyes, her nose and mouth, declared the native mother; but her broad
and lofty forehead indicated the European descent of the father. She was
unquestionably a woman of weight in the country, bringing down upon the
floor, as she walked, a pressure of some seventeen or eighteen stone ! There
was not only vigour of intellect, but a strength and independence of will,
stamped upon her expansive features. The base of her brain represented the
portentous character of animal appetites, while the loftiness and breadth else-
where exhibited the force of moral sentiments. . . . Arrived at the door of a
neat three-roomed bush cottage, I was received with many smiles by the buxom
Maryann, who introduced me within. There I found my royal host conversing
with a Sydney half-caste, who had come on a friendly visit. 'The room into which
I was brought had many tokens of civilisation and gentility wanting in most of the


country cottages of England The furniture, though homely, was suitable and
comfortable. A carpet covered the floor. Not a particle of dust could be seen. A
few prints adorned the walls, and books lay on the side-table. The Bible occupied
a conspicuous position. The daily newspaper was there, as Walter was a regular
subscriber for the press. The table was laid with quite a tempting appearance, and
a thorough good cup of tea was handed round by the jovial-looking hostess.” The
conversation which followed was cheerful and interesting. When the subject of
Mr. Clark’s death was introduced, Maryann gave an interesting account of the
superintendent’s last days. “ I attended him,” she said, “along with his daughter,
night and day. But all the people wanted to do something for him, for all loved
him so. And then he would talk to us, and pray with us. He would tell me what
to read to him from the Bible when too weak to hold the book himself. How he
would talk to us ! When he thought he was going to die, he got the room full, and
bade us good-bye. He held up his hands and prayed for us. He did love us. And
then he said, while he was crying, 1 Mind you be sure and all meet me in Heaven.’”
Here the poor creature sobbed aloud, and could utter no more. After a j)ause,
Maryann continued : “We had souls at Flinders, but we have none here. There
we were looked after, and the bad whites were kept from annoying us. Here we
are thrown upon the scum of society. They have brought us among the offscouring
of society (alluding to the convict population about.) Here are bad of all sorts.
We should be a deal better if someone would read and pray to us. We are tempted
to drink, and all bad practices, but there is neither reading nor prayer. While they
give us food for the body they might give us food for the soul; they might think of
the remnant of us poor creatures, and make us happy. Nobody cares for us.” It
is necessary to remark here that Bishop Nixon had made some provision for their
religious instruction, by requesting a neighbouring clergyman to give them an
occasional service. But the gentleman was said to be unpopular, and whenever
his horse was seen on the hill, it was a signal for general dispersion. There was,
therefore, no congregation, and the service was not held. Poor Walter died soon
after. He was returning home from Hobart in his boat, intoxicated, fell overboard,
and was drowned. Maryann did not long survive her husband. They never had a
family.
As time went by, the old inmates of the Oyster Cove prison-house died off
one by one, until there was no aboriginal male left but the young sailor, William
Lanne. He was the youngest son of the last family of natives who had escaped all
the search parties, and gave themselves up near Wool worth in 1842. He, too, died
on the 3rd March, 1869, at the early age of thirty-four years. As a boy he grew
up at Flinders Island until, at the age of thirteen, he was removed, with the remnant
of his countrymen, to Oyster Cove. Ultimately he took to the sea, and for several
years went whaling in vessels belonging to the port of Hobart. He was a great
favourite with the sailors, being pleasing in his habits and appearance. The citizens


of Hobart also took an especial interest in the sole male survivor of his race. In
January, 1868, King Billy, as he was then called, was introduced on the Hobart
Regatta ground to His Royal Highness Prince Alfred. Neatly attired in a blue sailor
suit he walked with Prince Alfred with the confidence of one who felt conscious of
royal brotherhood. He went on another whaling voyage, and returned in February,
1869, when he received his pay, amounting to £l2 odd. On this occasion he fell a
victim to the intemperate propensities which had destroyed the most intelligent of his
race. On the 2nd March he was siezed with an attack of diarrhoea, and in
attempting to dress himself on the following morning, intending to proceed to the
hospital for treatment, he fell dead in the public-house. His body was removed to
the hospital; and the remains of “ The Last Man ” were followed to the grave
by a large concourse of people. Great excitement prevailed in Hobart when it was
discovered that, first, the head had been stolen from the hospital, and the rest
of the body had been removed, after interment, by some unknown person,
evidently for the purpose of preserving a most interesting osteological record of
the lost race.
Truganini still lived. Year after year she had seen the men, women, and
children of her race passing away, until at length she was the only Tasmanian
aboriginal native living on the face of the earth. What a bitter contemplation for
this aged woman who had taken such a prominent part in rescuing the people of
her country from the inhospitable forests, into the recesses of which those who
escaped slaughter had been driven like wild beasts. She had followed them through
all their vicissitudes for upwards of forty-six years—was with Robinson’s mission
party from 1830 until all the blacks were brought in—remained with them at
Flinders, where she saw them rapidly pass away under the most humane treatment —
accompanied the handful of survivors to Oyster Cove—saw her companions, young
and old, passing down to the grave, until at last she was left alone—the sole
remnant of a bygone race What painful reminiscences would posses her active and
intelligent mind as she stood alone over the graves of her people —a people who, in
the order of Providence, had received that lovely Island of the South as their
heritage in prehistoric times. Well might that extraordinary woman muse in the
agony of despair over the blighted fortunes of her countrymen, whom she had
devoted her life to serve.
Truganini died on the Bth day of May, 1876, at the age of sixty five.
She was buried at the Cascades Cemetery, in the suburbs of Hobart, and
thus the grave closed over the last remaining member of the unfortunate
Tasmanian race.

R. GOLDSBROUGH & CO., LIMITED.
It is questionable whether a firm in the civilised world
engaged in the wool business has not heard or does not know
by repute that of E. Goldsbrough & Co., whose warehouses
in Bourke-street are shown in the preceding pages. Many
although realising the influence and power of this firm and its
vast dealings in wool, grain, hides, and tallow, would fail to
grasp the gigantic operations of an establishment the name of
which is associated in the mind of every Australian with
a respect almost akin to veneration. Everyone conversant
with the history of Melbourne cannot but concede the fact
that Messrs. Goldsbrough & Co. have done more for the
advancement of the Australian wool trade, by fostering its
steady development until the value of its export has now
reached £12,796,000, than any other firm or individual,
and it was certainly just that the late head of the
firm during his lifetime was dubbed the “Father of the
Australian Wool Trade.” In 1817 Mr. Richard Goldsbrough
arrived in this colony, and immediately devoted himself to
the wool business, which grew so rapidly and satisfactorily,
that shortly after he required larger premises than those he
had commenced in. In 1851 his first bluestone warehouse
was commenced off Market-street, but this building was not
completed until 1853, owing to the scarcity of labor conse-
quent on the outbreak of the “ gold fever.” In 1854, Mr.
Hugh Parker was taken into partnership, and remained in
the business until his death, which occurred in 1878. In
1873, Mr. John S. Horsfall, was also admitted into partner-
ship, as were Messrs. David and Arthur Parker in 1876.
The rapid growth of the business can be imagined by a
glance at the huge warehouses in Bourke-street, which could
not but convey to one’s mind the idea that the transactions
carried on within such a pile must be enormous. Whilst
indirectly affecting the whole of Australia, the firm of
Goldsbrough & Co. has borne so prominent and characteristic!,
a part in the development of Victorian commercial pros-
perity, that a work of the nature of this history would
certainly be incomplete without a description of that firm.
It will be matter of surprise to many that the pile of buildings
shown in our illustration cost upwards of £150,000; and
cover an area of over five acres, providing a storage capacity
of over two and a quarter million cubic feet, with a tonnage
measurement of more that fifty-eight thousand tons. These
figures in themselves clearly indicate that Melbourne, which
is steadily and rapidly extending her commerce, is an
enormous wool depot. In addition to the benefits conferred on
Victoria by this firm through the wool business, it has been of
permanent and substantial help to Melbourne in many other
ways, and for this the name of Goldsbrough & Co. must be
handed down to posterity. It is scarcely to be denied that so
far as creating Melbourne into a large wool centre is con-
cerned, Messrs. Goldsbrough & Co. had “ little less than
all ” to do with it.
The company as at present constituted was formed in 1881,
and was the result of a purchase of the private firm by
the Australasian Agency and Banking Corporation, which
was then formed into a limited company, with a capital of
£3,000,000. The purchase money amounted to something
like £250,000. On the formation into a limited company,
the management of the business was entrusted to a board of
six directors —Sir W. H. F. Mitchell, Sir Chas. Sladen, Mr.
Goldsbrough, Mr. Horsfall, Mr. Cattanaoh, Mr. Hines ; and the
present board consists of Mr. A. W. Robertson, chairman, Mr.
Horsfall, Mr. Andrew Rowan, Mr. Salathiel Booth, Mr Arthur
Parker; Mr. F. E. Stewart, the manager of the Australasian
Agency and Banking Corporation, accepting the general
management of the company in Melbourne. The London
Board of Directors is composed of Abraham Scott, Esq.
(Chairman of the National Bank of Australasia), Chairman;
H. H. Dobree, Esq.; J. Cockfield Dimsdale, Esq.; and Frank
C. Capel, Esq., with offices at 156 and 157 Leadenhall-street,
E.C. The business of the company is not restricted to sales in
wool, tallow, hides, grain, sheepskins, and almost every
natural product of Australasia, since they conduct an extensivs
business for the convenience of their numerous clients. Ths
indisputable indication of Melbourne becoming one of the
principal marts in the world for wool is established by the
fact that yearly an increasing number of buyers resort to the
warehouse of Goldsbrough & Co. Ltd., from England, the con-
tinent of Europe, and America, and these acknowledge that
they find in the splendid salerooms of this princely company
every opportunity for obtaining the pick of Australian wools.
Some idea of the immense business campassed by the firm
might be gleaned from the fact of the following statement of
business transacted by the company for the year ending 31st
March, 1887. The total quantity of wool offered in Mel-
bourne during the year was 178,613 bales. Of this number
R. Goldsbrough & Co. Limited offered in their rooms by
public auction 75,103 bales, and succeeded in disposing of
60,033 bales, whilst they made direct shipments on account
of clients of 8,352 bales. The firm is justly noted for the regu-
larity and smoothness with which all their business is carried
on.
When the diversion of a deal of the produce which found
its way to Melbourne took place consequent on the extension
of the railway system of New South Wales, the company found
it necessary to open a branch in Sydney, and accordingly
erected warehouses having a frontage of 354 feet to Darling
Harbor. The building, which is entirely constructed of
Pyrmont stone, is really magnificent, and has a storage
capacity for 50,000 bales of wool.
Liberal advances are made to clients, and Messrs. Golds-
brough <fe Co., Ltd., in addition to their other business, conduct a
large stock and station agency, and it is a well-known fact
that many of the most important Australian runs have passed
through their hamds. Their business transactions are not
confined to Victoria and New South Wales, but range over
the adjoining colonies, and New Zealand and Tasmania.
L. STEVENSON AND SONS LTD.
WAREHOUSE.
The very handsome structure portrayed on the following page,
in which the business of the above firm is carried on, was
designed, and its erection supervised by Mr. F. M. White, the
well-known architect. This magnificent pile was the first of


many large places of business erected in Flinders Lane, and
has the merit of being unsurpassed by its later rivals, either
in dimensions or architectural beauty. The foundations are
of bluestone and the first floor of the front elevation is con-
structed of the same material elaborately dressed, the re-
mainder is built of brick and cement. The external measure-
ments are 150 feet by 75, and the building as shown in our
illustration is five storeys in height. The flooring, if spread,
would cover an area of two acres. Upwards of a million of
bricks were used in the construction, and the building contains
no fewer than one hundred and sixty plate glass windows,
those fronting south and west being protected by fireproof iron
shutters which by a most ingenious contrivance can be closed
s multaneously. They form a thorough preventive against
fire, and are closed every night, whilst for additional safety
water is laid on to every floor, and a hose the entire length of
the building is kept constantly ready. A significant feature
of the building in these days of overcrowding is that it is
entirely detached and that, consequently, it enjoys the adjunct
of light to a remarkable degree, and that vehicles can be
driven right round the strurture. The internal arrangements
are thoroughly in keeping with the requirements of such an
extensive establishment. Three hydraulic lifts, two used for
passage of goods outwards and inwards, and the third for the
convenience of customers, are fitted up and an official kept in
constant attendance to regulate the traffic of these lifts.
This is the first building which was fitted up with such con-
veniences. There is a well appointed apartment known as
the “ Customer’s Room,” fitted up with lavatory, letter-box,
writing materials, patent gas-heating stove, daily papers, and
other articles suggestive of comfort and convenience. The
offices are extensive and complete, and can be kept distinct
from the warehouse by folding doors. The fixtures and
counters are of polished cedar, and no expense has been
spared in rendering this one of the most perfect and elegant
structures. The cost of the building, exclusive of land, is
estimated at £20,000. The land which measures 150 by
108 feet at the present day is worth about £BOO per foot,
but when purchased in 1865, cost £5O per foot. The buildings
and fixtures cost £28,000, which, with the present value of
the freehold, brings the total up to £114,400.
In consequence of the steady growth of the business, it was
decided in the latter part of 1887 to change the business into
a Limited Liability Co. The capital was placed at £300,000,
in 100,000 shares of £3 each. Fifty thousand shares, paid
up to £2, were retained by the vendors in part payment of the
purchase money. Ten thousand shares were reserved for
the connections and employes of the firm, while 40,000 shares
were offered to the public. The provisional directors were
the Hon. C. H. James, M.L.G.; the Hon. Edward Langton, J.
Loyd Roberts, Esq.; E. Murray Smith, C.M.G.
The Managing Directors are George Stevenson, Esq.;
G. F. Brind, Esq.; Herbert Stevenson, Esq.; and in
London, Leader C. Stevenson, Esq. Remarkable suc-
cess attended the floating of the company. The allotment of
the shares was made December 7th, 1887, when it was ascer-
tained that the shares had been over-subscribed for by sixty
per cent., large numbers having been taken by the employes
and customers of the firm. With increased capital and under
the old and experienced management, the future is full of
promise for the company.
Those having an inkling of Colonial history, cannot but
know that the name of Stevenson and Sons has been closely
identified with the mercantile and shipping interests from the
earliest days of colonisation. As far back as 1827, Mr.
Stevenson’s father commenced a shipping trade between
London and Tasmania, and in 1846 sent out his eldest son,
Leader Cox Stevenson, to overlook his interests there. Mr.
George Stevenson, a younger brother of Mr. L. C. Stevenson,
on leaving school entered his father’s office in London, and
shortly after was despatched to Tasmania to take charge of
affairs, as his elder brother was returning to England. In
1853 a branch was established in Melbourne under the man-
agement of Mr. John Morris, which prospered with the
other branches to such a degree that ever since the name of
Stevenson and Sons has been numbered amongst the list of
merchant princes. Mr. George Stevenson re-visited England in
1859, and on his return selected Melbourne as a permanent
place of residence, and soon after commenced the erection of the
building which is the subject of this short sketch. Carrying
on an extensive business in that building, in 1865, Mr.
Stevenson inaugurated the manufacture of clothing on an
extensive scale, and subsequently added thereto the hat
manufacturing business. The gigantic business done by the
firm has been hitherto conducted in Melbourne by Messrs.
George Stevenson and his son, Mr. Herbert Stevenson, and in
London by Mr. L. C. Stevenson.
WALLACH BROS.
In the year 1850, in a canvas tent pitched at the corner of
Elizabeth and Little Bourke streets, Wallach Bros, began
business. At the expiration of 12 years they built a massive
warehouse in Elizabeth-street, and removed thither, where
the business was conducted with great success until the
completion of their present colossal establishment. The
partners in the present firm are B. J. Fink, M.L.A., of Mel-
bourne, and Maurice Aron, J.P. of Sydney. To their enter-
prise and capital is due the erection of the largest and most
complete furniture warehouse south of the line. The style of
architecture is Italian, combining strength and beauty with
usefulness. Messrs. Twentyman and Askew, the architects,
kept strictly in view the practical use for which the structure
was designed, and they succeeded admirably. The front, up
to the first floor, is of rubbed Malmesbury bluestone, the super-
structure being brick and cement; the contractors, Messrs.
Nation, Gamlin, and Nation, left nothing to be desired on
their part. The frontage on Elizabeth-street is 74 feet, the
depth being 180 feet. At 80 feet from the front the building
widens to 123 feet. The premises are in reality four stores
combined, each having a separate entrance and divided by
fireproof doors. Ventilation and light have been carefully pro-
vided for, the result being two acres of floor space bright and
airy. The cost of the land and building was £120,000, which,
being augmented by the immense stock, brings up the total
value of the premises to a quarter of a million sterling. On

the ground lloor the immense windows display specific lines
required in house furnishing. Large show-rooms are devoted
to drawing, dining, and bed-room furniture, crockery, electro-
plate ware, ironmongery, drapery, silk coverings, carpets, pic-
tures, and all that combine to make home comfortable or
luxurious. We were particularly struck with the fact that this
immense establishment caters just as carefully for the poor
housewife as for the richest dame in the land. The humble
cottage can be furnished for a few pounds, as well as the man-
sion for thousands. An almost endless variety and assort-
ment has been provided, and all customers or casual visitors
are cordially welcomed and their wants carefully attended to
by polite assistants. The building is furnished with three
patent Otis safety elevators, two for freight and one for pas-
sengers. The car is a very handsome piece of work built by
Wallach Bros., and is in every particular fully equal to the
best found in New York. The elevator is manufactured by
the Austral Otis Engineering and Elevator Co., who
have secured the right for this patent in Australia.
The automatic appliances render this elevator absolutely
safe. The fact that it has been 37 years in use, carry-
ing 125 millions of passengers annually in New York
alone, renders comment unnecessary. The history of
Wallach Bros, is co-existive with the history of the
colony of Victoria, and the premises in Elizabeth-street a new
landmark in Melbourne of one of the oldest, largest, and most
successful business enterprises established in the Queen City
of the South. In addition to the warehouse affording immense
show rooms fcr the display of household requisites, the upper
flats furnish ample room for the upholstering and packing of
the furniture brought from the factory of the firm at Leicester
street, Carlton. Many of the rooms are hand-painted with
artistic designs, while the entire establishment in magnitude
anl finish has but few rivals in the world. It is a significant
fact that several of file employds have been connected with
the business since its establishment in a tent. They
have grown up with the colony of Victoria, and thoroughly
unlerstand the wants of the people, not only in the metro-
polis, but in all parts of the country. While cultivating and
inculcating a taste for the beautiful, they have never lost sight
of the important fact that the useful and the practical furnish
the substantial foundations, and must be kept constantly in
view. In the early days the requisites were few—-now we
possess a complete civilisation. Many of our citizens have
seen and carefully examined the best that can be produced in
Europe and America, and it speaks volumes for Wallach Bros,
that they have kept pace with the accelerated demand which
has been made on their judgment, skill, and taste. A stroll
through their show rooms demonstrates that they are utilising
the various beautiful native woods in producing artist furni-
ture of the very highest class. Many pieces are unique in de-
sign, and classical in proportion—a combination resulting
from the union of the artist with the workman.
W. P. BUCKHURST.
W. P. Buckhurst is the second son of John Robert Buckhurst,
Esq., grazier, from near Rochester, Kent, England, a
direct descendant of a welhknown old historical family
in the peerage. Young Buckhurst wished to see the
world, but his father refused any assistance. Nothing
daunted, he sailed for Canada, and landed at Quebec
with a capital of £ll. After visiting the principal
points in Canada, he proceeded to Chicago, U.S.A.,
and apprenticed himself at the milling business, and in seven
months was given charge of a flour mill in the Valley of the
Mississippi, where he remained for two years. In 1852, he
bought a team of six bullocks, two cows, a covered waggon,
and, with a party of twenty-six, started overland for
California. Five months were spent in the journey, which
included adventures with the Indians, buffalo-hunting, and
many perilous adventures. While at Salt Lake City he
received an offer from the Mormon prophet, Brigham Young,
to take charge of a flour mill, but refused. The golden State
was reached in September, 1852. He followed mining for
two years with varying success and failure ; but after two
years’ hard work, arrived in San Francisco without a dollar or
even enough to pay for a meal. Not daunted, he drove an
express, painted signs, and finally resumed milling. Having
accumulated about £4OO, he determined, with a friend, to
build a small flour mill. The capital was entrusted to a
millwright to buy material for the mill, instead of which he
bought a ticket for New York and disappeared. Once more
Mr. Buckhurst set to work, bought an allotment in “ Happy
Valley,” San Francisco, and built two cottages. The next
year he purchased a lot from the celebrated Lola Montez,
situated on Stockton-street, near the site of the present
Palace Hotel, upon which he erected two brick houses. Life
in California at that time was full of danger and excitement.
He was present during the regime of the “ Fort Gunny Bags,”
and the Vigilance Committee, the lawless times on the Yubas,
at Downeyville, and other diggings. Upon one occasion he
was in a room 12 x 20 in which eighteen shots from revolvers
were fired among about twenty people. While regarding the
climate of California as one of the finest in the world, and
scenery and soil of the first order, the lawless life at that
period in vogue was not congenial, consequently Mr.
Buckhurst determined upon removing to Australia. He
arrived in Melbourne in 1857, and located on Emerald Hill,
where he built two small terraces, one of which paid him 33
per cent, on his investment. In 1859 he joined Mr. H. G.
Nelson in the estate business in Swanston-street, and
remained with him for two years. He then married, and
commenced business for himself in Clarendon-street, Emerald
Hill, as auctioneer and estate agent. The entire profits on
the business for the first week were three shillings and
sixpence, and sixteen shillings and two guineas respectively
for the second and third weeks, without allowing for expenses;
but energy, perseverance, and honesty of purpose soon
attracted clients, and in a few years Mr. Buckhurst’s name
became a household word in South Melbourne. He was the
largest purchaser of Crown lands in the district, and
engaged in extensive building operations. “Rochester
Terrace,” in St. Vincent’s Gardens, which he still retains, is
uiodel of convenience and taste, and was erected at a cost
of £lO,OOO. After fourteen years of hard work, his health
became impaired, and Mr. Buxton, his nephew, joined the


business. Mr. Buckhurst then took his first trip around the
world, visiting India, Palestine, Italy, Switzerland, Germany,
Austria, Belgium, France, Scotland, and Ireland. On his
return, he published a small volume entitled “ Rambles by an
Australian Abroad.” Since that time Mr. Buckhurst has
become the most extensive traveller in Australia, having
been four times around the world and across it, visiting the
chief cities of India and Russia, including Agra, Delhi,
Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Warsaw, Moscow, and St.
Petersburg. While in India he ascended the Hymalayas to
Darjeeling. After sojourning in the chief cities of Italy,
France, Belgium, and Austria, he proceeded to the Mediter-
ranean ports, including Joppa, Smyrna, Constantinople,
Athens, Venice, Naples, Marseilles, Malta, Gibraltar, Genoa,
and Algiers. While in Algiers, he proceeded through the
country to the Morocco Border, and crossed over to Spain,
travelling through that kingdom, and witnessing one of
the largest bull fights of the season in Madrid on a Sunday
afternoon. During a northern tour, he saw Denmark,
Holland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Lapland (the latter
included an experience of reindeer sleighing). Penetrating
the Arctic Circle to within 18 degrees of the Pole, he found
himself in “ The Land of the Midnight Sun.” He has
crossed the American Continent three times; he has seen the
wonders of the Yosemlte Valley and of the now famous
Yellowstone Park, including geysers and marvels having no
equal elsewhere. In one trip he proceeded to all the
Queensland ports, thence to China, including Canton,
Hong Kong, and all the treaty ports, with a seven hundred
miles journey into the interior of the Celestial Empire. He
then crossed to Japan, from thence to California, the
Sandwich Islands, Samoa, and New Zealand. Many
interesting accounts of his travels have appeared in the
Daily Telegraph. Mr. Buckhurst has not been unmindful of
home affairs, taking the deepest interest in the prosperity
of South Melbourne. He was the originator of the South
Melbourne Bowling Green, of the Albert Park Lake as a
yachting place, putting on the pioneer boat. Mr. Buckhurst
struggled long for his direct ship canal scheme, which would
have given Melbourne a magnificent water approach, and thus
avoided the costly blunders which will prove annually an
enormous bill of expense to the colony. He was an early
champion of the agitation in favour of putting an end to the
convict system, and the first to suggest sending a ship load
back to England, and now advocates the establishment ot
woollen mills at Shanghai, China, and at Tokio, Japan, as an
outlet for Australian wool. He favours the manufacture of
native wine, brandy, fruit-preserving, and raisin-curing in
Australia as profitable industries. In 1884 Mr. Buckhurst
bought the well-known Mason Estate, on Toorak-road,
comprising 9J acres, for £22,500, for which Mr. Mason paid
£299. He has retained two acres adjoining the mansion of
J. B. Payne, Esq., upon which he has built one of the most
elegant mansions in the vicinity of Melbourne, from {plans
prepared by his son, Mr. Walter Buckhurst, architect, of
20 Collins-street west, a sketch of which we give in our
illustrations. Mr. Buckhurst is still a partner in the well-
known firm of Buckhurst and Buxton, and carrying on a
prosperous business, which he started in 1861, commencing
with two cottages. In 1887, they have now charge of over
700 houses. He recently propounded a scheme for a grand
central station at Elizabeth-street, bringing in the Spencer-
street traffic on a high level to Elizabeth-street, letting off the
frontage to Flinders-sti eet as shops, showing the whole
outlay would yield a return of 11 per co it, lEs last offer is
to build a station himself, giving the Railway Department
sixty tine offices, each of 20 x 30 feet, ten ticket offices and
board-room, for nothing, and in addition give them (£4000)
four thousand pounds per annum, if they will give him a
lease of the Flinders-street frontage, 75 feet deep from Queen
to Swanston street, and at the end of thirty-three years will
hand the whole pile over to the Railway Department—a
plucky and bond fide offer.
THE AUSTRALIAN IRRIGATION
COLONIES ON THE RIVER MURRAY.
Messrs. Chaffey Bros., Limited.
By agreements entered into between Chaffey Bros, and the
Governments of Victoria and South Australia, Messrs. Chaffey
have secured half a million of acres of land upon the Murray
Eiver for irrigation purposes. The proprietors have not come
to Australia upon an experimental journey. In Southern
California they long since solved the problem, and the
people of this country will reap the benefit of their experience,
scientific knowledge, enterprise, and practical common sense.
It is universally conceded that agriculture in Australia only
presents one obstacle, viz. ; Failure of crops from lack of suf-
ficient rainfall. Once you remove this obstacle the element
of uncertainty disappears. The colonies which the Messrs.
Chaffey have established are situated upon the banks of the
Murray River.
Some idea of the enormous resources for irrigation pur-
poses which this river affords may be formed from the fact
that the mean flow of water in gallons per 24 hours in 1886,
was calculated in April at 590,031,000, and in September at
7,250,007,000 gallons.
The Mildura Colony, Victoria.
This colony consists of 250,000 acres, of which 50,100 are
being practically dealt with by being irrigated. This area
includes the site of a town, and surrounding residential or
suburban villa blocks. Elsewhere will be found particulars
with reference to climate, <fec., showing the conditions generally
to be extremely favourable to the different kinds of cultivation
which will be carried on ; these being chiefly of the same
character as those which have been attended with such re-
markable success in California, namely, the grape, the orange,
the olive, the prune, the fig, the apricot, the peach, and such
other varieties of profitable fruit and vegetable production as
may be found most desirable. The Australasian (1887) reports
as follows concerning “ Mildura ” “ The plain is about two
miles wide, and stretches away for three or four miles to the
westward. The soil upon this open country is a rich, friable,
red, sandy loam to a depth of from 18 in. to 2 ft., when it
changes to a more clayey loam. ‘ Just the soil for irrigation,
I was the general opinion. The apparently level surface pos-

sesses a gradual fall in two directions, namely, one to the
north-west, along the course of the Murray, and another to
the westward from the river bank. . . . On the journey
between Mallee Cliff and the homestead, a distance of 16
miles, the road passes through level plains of red, friable soil,
intersected at frequent intervals by low pine ridges. The
soil came completely up to our idea of the best land for irriga-
tion, and the cultivation of vines and fruit trees, while the
aspect appeared to us as if specially designed for being arti-
ficially watered. ... A fine ridge, just high enough to
give a gentle fall to the adjacent plains, has been raised by
Nature at every mile, or half mile, so that distribution and
drainage are admirably provided for. . . . The river at
Mildura is a grand stream over 300 feet in width, and more
than 35 feet deep. . . . The mallee land, like the land
bearing mallee elsewhere, is as good as the plains, and the
Murray water can be carried back 15 miles to the boundary
of the Chaffey block. . . . With irrigation its possibilities
are unlimited.”
Messrs. Chaffey are dealing in the first instance with no
less an area than 80,000 acres—so,ooo acres in Victoria,
30,000 in South Australia —each of which will form a distinct
irrigation scheme in itself. That is to say, that it will be
complete in all the elaborate and expensively constructed field
works for the laying on of water, the very powerful pumping
machinery for raising the fertilising liquid from the river, the
laying out of the land, or rather the determination of its
appropriation for the various agricultural, horticultural, viti-
cultural, and other purposes to which it is to be applied,
accordingly as situation, soil, and other conditions may be
specially agreeable to each of the various cultivations which
can be advantageously carried on— having reference also to
the extent of irrigation necessary for each ; —all these points
being carefully studied by Messrs. Chaffey, and arranged with
that thorough knowledge of the subject (of the varied elemen-
tary constituents of soils, and their adaptability to the most
successful and profitable cultural purposes, &c., &e.) with
which their past achievements have so well furnished them.
The plans of the two settlements as finally surveyed and
arranged in 10-acre blocks are now prepared ; and there is also
a plan showing the arrangement of a town, which will form
the commercial focus of the wide surrounding areas of busy
and varied cultivation. The town allotments are of the
ordinary size, and are encircled by an extensive array of villa
or residence sites, each two and a half acres in extent. The
streets are disposed at right angles, with a chief thoroughfare
or boulevard of very great breadth (200 feet), thus admitting
of ornamental tree planting and the creation of a really fine
and beautiful avenue, not inferior, as regards its future
prospective possibilities, to those which constitute the chief
pride and glory of some of our great modern cities. Messrs.
Chaffey make, drain, and plant this avenue at their own
expense.
Messrs. Chaffey have set aside some 28,000 acres altogether
(land with irrigation works worth, at £2O per acre, about
£560,000), for the erection and endowment of an Agricultural
College upon each of the irrigation estates of the Murray ; and
we may be sure there will be no delay in putting these im-
portant works in hand, so that scientific enlightenment and
agricultural development may be early united together, and
thus true and genuine progress assured from the beginning.
The erection of this building, as indeed may be said of all the
numerous works of convenience and general utility which
Messrs. Chaffey contemplate, is intended to be proceeded with
as from the commencement, and as forming part of the great
and enlightened scheme of Australian colonisation which
they have now set in operation.
The irrigated lands are offered to the public upon the fol-
lowing terms :—Cleared and ready for the plough, at £l5 per
acre for agricultural, and £2O for the fruit cultivation lands.
Agricultural lands (including water for irrigation) may be
taken upon lease, with power of purchase, by purchasers of
vine or fruit growing areas at the rent of one-quarter of the
product of their cultivation; and such lands being rendered
highly productive by irrigation, settlers are thus enabled to
obtain a good remunerative return from the outset, and until
their fruit trees, &c., come into profitable bearing. This plan
of charging for the use of land by taking a share of the pro-
duce is, we believe, somewhat new in Australia, but it is very
commonly practised in the United States.
Messrs. Chaffey will also furnish from the outset the best
guidance, instruction and information with reference to the
science and business of irrigation farming in all its various
departments; the most approved methods of cultivation ; the
best descriptions and 'Varieties of plants with reference to
the peculiarities of soil, climate, <kc.; the most profitable
kinds of cultivation having regard to colonial consumption
and importations, and the nature of foreign market require-
ments; the most economical ordering of shipping and general
carrying arrangements; the most advantageous adjustment
of local buying and selling facilities; and, in short, in every
other way and by every practicable means by which the
common interest or the individual welfare can be promoted
and assisted.
The members of the firm Geo. Chaffey, W. B. Chaffey,
Stephen Cureton, and W. M. Patterson are all specialists in
the respective departments they control, —engineering, hor-
ticulture, irrigation, and construction. At the present time
no shares of this company have been placed upon the market,
tbe paid up shares being alloted to the different members of
the firm in proportion to the amount of interest held by them
individually.
Parties interested in irrigation will receive every informa-
tion by communicating with Messrs. Chaffey Bros., 78 Collins
street West, Melbourne.
“LANGI KAL KAL.”
The picturesque view depicted is that of the homestead
and surrounding paddocks of Langi Kal Kal, the well known
property of Kobert Simson, Esq., who for some years repre-
sented an electorate in the Legislative Council. The house is
situated 24 miles west of Ballarat, and is within two miles
north of the Trawalla Railway station. Nearing the station
from Carngham, the country which at first is gently undulat-
ing and dotted with gum, lightwood, honeysuckle, and she-
oak, growing in the appearance of a park, changes consider-


ably, every yard bringing one nearer the hills which surround
it. To the north-west, stand densely wooded ranges with
high hills as a background, the Pyrenees not far distant
to the left and the Mount Misery Ranges showing close on the
right.
The homestead is situated at the foot of a steep hill that
rises up from the creek. The house is small and old fashioned,
and like all old squatting residences, is close to the water.
The garden is an excellent one, the fruit and other trees grow-
ing remarkably well. The manager has planted a number of
young oaks which have made great progress. A fine piece of
water formed by a dam placed across the creek in front of the
house, enhances the beauty of the place and gives one the
impression that it must be a lovely summer residence.
The property contains nearly 27,000 acres of land, every
inch of which is freehold, not a single selector having foothold
within the boundary fences. The view from the front of the
house is really charming, the hills of Ercildoune being only
six miles distant, and betwixt these two points there are about
1500 acres of fine old red gum trees which impart to the place
the appearance of an English Park. The country is poor but
grows very fine wool, and during the spring and early summer
makes fat sheep, but in winter the cold is severe and then
the stock have a difficulty in keeping their condition. The
property lays principally in the parishes of Livingstone,
Brewster, Ercildoune and Langi Kal Kal, all in the county of
Ripon ,Beaufort, the county town, and which is still a mining
centre, being six miles distant. When the Fiery Creek rush
took place many years ago on the Langi Kal Kal run, the
population numbered thirty thousand, but has now dwindled
down to some fifteen hundred.
This magnificent estate passed into the hands of Mr.
Simson in 1853, Mr. W.B. Hamilton having been the previous
owner. At the time of Mr. Simson’s purchase there was not
an acre of freehold on it, it being purely a squatting run held
under two separate licenses as Langi Kal Kal and Mount
Ross stations.
The great attraction at Langi Kal Kal is the fine stud of
merino sheep bred there. The flock originally belonged to
Messrs. Donald and Hamilton, who settled down here under
squatting lease about 1840. They obtained their sheep from
the late Mr. W. Kermode, of Monavale, Tasmania, and used
rams bred by the Circular Head Company, the Australian
Agricultural Company, N.S.W., and imported rams from the
flocks of New Gadegast, Saxony, and Mr. Sturgeon, of Grays,
England. The stud was formed by the present proprietor in
1862, and since then the rams used have been drawn from the
flocks of Messrs. T. Shaw, T. and S. Learmonth, and J. L.
Currie. Imported Rambouillet and Steiger rams were tried,
but they did not give satisfaction, and their stock were thrown
out of the stud. The wool of the sheep on this estate is loiijj
in staple, soft and bright, and the quality is excellent. A few
years ago it was thought the sheep were becoming too light on
the points, and in 1881 a fine ram, bred by Mr. Jas. Gibson, of
Bellevue, Tasmania, was purchased, with the view of remedy-
ing the defect. The experiment succeeded admirably, the
Bellevue ram's stock being excellent in every respect. Mr.
Simson was so well satisfied with the introduction of the Tas-
manian blood into his flock that at the annual Melbourne sale
in 1884, he purchased a ram by Magenta, bred by Mr. W. H.
Bennett, of Bloomfield, Tasmania. So much fancied was this
fine animal that he had to give 500 guineas to secure him. At
the same sale he purchased a ram bred by Mr. T. Gibson, of
Eskvale, Tasmania, for 300 guineas. The latter is larger in
frame, but the former has a most excellent fleece, which is put
on him in a faultless manner. Both rams were heavily worked
the first season, 400 lambs of their get being marked, and the
same year they each cut 141b. of clean, bright, unwashed
wool.
The stud flock is kept in two divisions, the first or extra
stud consists of 500 sheep, the second stud numbers 1,000 head.
The wool from the Langi Kal Kal sheep always realises good
prices, and it has on some occasions topped the market. The
sheepwash is well planned and well built, the situation being
on a grassy bank high above the creek, on the opposite side
to the house. The water is brought from a marsh under
Mount Misery, and, unlike that in the creek, is very soft.
The greatest care is taken to get the wool thoroughly clean
and bright. On entering the batten yards the sheep pass
through a shallow bricked tank, in which the water is con-
stantly replenished. This is to remove any dirt from their
feet and legs. They are hosed as they stand close together
in the yard, and from this they are put into the hot water
tank, which is divided into four compartments. In these the
sheep are well handled by the men, who use currycombs to
remove any foreign substance from the tip of the wool. On
leaving the hot water tank the sheep enter a shed, from which
four shoots lead to the pool where the spout-washing is carried
on. When the men below want a fresh sheep they open a
door at the bottom of a shoot, and a sheep slips out. The
door closes automatically, and the men above at once put
another sheep in the shoot. There are four strong jets of
water, and the sheep are put on rollers while being spouted.
The sheep from each jet leave by a separate lane, so that if
there is any bad washing it can be traced to the proper person.
The rule is to shear the sheep as soon as they are thoroughly
dry, which is usually about the fifth day. The wash will turn
out 900 wethers, the average of the flock sheep being about
1,000 head per day.
Langi Kal Kal was of old a cattle station, the stock for-
merly bred by Mr. Simson being of a very high class. On
one occasion he used a famous bull bred by Mr. Robert
McDougall, which was so much fancied that when he was
sold he realised 300 guineas. Of late Mr. Simson has paid
more attention to his cattle, and he has purchased a couple
of bulls that cannot fail to make their marks in the herd.
One of these bulls, Duke of Manchester 2nd, is a creamy
white bull, of large size for his age, being only three years
old, and of great length. He was bred by Messrs. Hart Bros.,
of Becfacres, near Adelaide, and is by Lord Red Rose 6th
(bred by the Hon. Win. McCulloch, Victoria) from May Rose
9th (also bred by the Hon. Wm. McCulloch). The other bull
is Duke of Underly sth, from Countess 15th, by Fusilier. This
bull has unfortunately put his hip out. At the sale of Messrs.
Robertson Bros.’ Colac herd Mr. Simson purchased some very
fine cows, which have been added to his herd. Among them
are Faithful’s Duchess, Magnolia 3rd, Marchioness 6th, and
Miss Butterfly 10th.

WYNN STAY,
Residence of G. W. Taylor, Esq., J.P.
The owner of one of the most charming suburban residences,
within a radius of miles. George William Taylor, Esq., was
born in North Wales, at Khos, in the parish of Ruabon,
Denbighshire, on the 7th of January, 1840. He received his
early education in his native village. Mr. Taylor’s father,
who was a rigid Nonconformist, and belonged to the Welsh
Presbyterian denomination, better known in Wales as the
Welsh Calvanistic Methodist Church, expressed his desire that
his son should be educated for the ministry, but to this Mr.
Taylor’s mother objected vehemently, and he himself threw
in his vote for a commercial career. At the age of about
thirteen and a half he entered the employ of a Mr. Savage, a
storekeeper, and remained with that gentleman for eighteen
months, and was then apprenticed to a Mr. H. W. Jones, of
Town Hill, Wrexham, some four miles distant from his native
village. Having served his indentures, at the age of nineteen,
we find him facing the world, in London, in the employ cf
F. C. Caters, foimeily of the firm of Caters and Wood,
Finsbury. In the beginning of 1860 he re-visited his native
place, and on his return to London in the same year accepted
an appointment with Messrs. Tarn and Co., and attained a
position of trust and importance. He once more visited his
parents in 1862, and on the 12th of July of that year em-
barked for Australia in the Annie Archbell, arriving in Sydney
in October. The day following his landing he secured an
appointment with Messrs. Francis Giles and Co., of George-
street, and served that firm creditably for a few years. Pos-
sessed cf a desire to settle in Victoria, he next visited Mel-
bourne and served with Messrs. Alston and Brown, Janies
Dodgshun and Co., and Beath, Schiess and Co. successively.
About the year 1874, wishing to commence business for him-
self, he started as an auctioneer and land and estate agent.
Gradually he dissociated the auctioneering element from his
business, and devoted himself particularly to the land busi-
ness, and by this means acquired several lots of suburban
land. Through the troublous times of “ Black Wednesday ”
and “ the Berry Blight,” the value of land fell almost to zero,
but his discrimination induced him to struggle on without
parting with a rood of the land he had acquired, and his
judgment in this respect was amply rewarded. Confidence in
property commenced reasserting itself in 1880, and it was
then that he brought a scheme of his into fruition by forming
a syndicate for the purchase of land in large blocks, sub-
dividing it and selling the same in small allotments. Such
was the judgment displayed by himin theseenormous transac-
tions that within two years of the formation of the first
syndicate by him, land to the extent of £2,000,000 sterling
had been operated with through his instrumentality.
Prahran, where he lived for the best part of twenty years,
received his utmost attention to its requirements in the direc-
tion of advancement. Both time and money have been
lavished by him to that end, and no scheme where he has not
been the promoter, for social, religious or educational ad-
vancement, has been without material assistance from him.
He has always advocated the higher branches of education,
and has given substantial proof of his opinions in that respect.
lii 1«75 and ’7O, when Prahran had not attained to the dignity
of a city, he unsuccessfully contested two municipal elections,
but in 1877 his endeavours were crowned with success.
After the expiry of his term he sought the suffrages of the
ratepayers again, but was defeited. With that persistence so
characteristic of him he faced the ordeal once more in 188.',
and was i\ turned on this occasion by a large majority, and was
subsequently elected by the unanimous voice of the Council
to till the Mayoral chair during the years 1881-85. During
his mayorality he took an active part in the leading political
questions of the day, and entertained the then Government
and some three hundred others at a sumptuous banquet in the
Prahran Town Hall, to mark his approbation of the view
taken by them on certain matters.
Nor were his energetic endeavours confined to the actions
already enumerated. The rapidly increasing population of
Prahran, numbering something like 30,000 inhabitants, ren-
dered building necessary, and all available land was being
fast appropriated for that purpose, when Mr. Taylor bethought
himself of the future generations, and there being no Govern-
ment or public reserves, he induct d, desp.te strenuous opposi-
tion, his brother councillors to purchase some land and
dedicate the same to the public, as a park and gardens
for the purpose of recreation. These were formally
dedicated by Lady Loch, on the 7th August, 1885, when, after
the ceremony had been concluded, Sir Henry Loch, the
Governor, Lady Loch, and suite, and 200 visitors partook of
the liberal hospitality of the Mayor, at luncheon, at the Town
Hall. Mr. Taylor’s hospitality, which has always been pro-
verbial, on this occasion caused him to issue invitations for a
garden party, at his private residence, Wynnstay, of whichever
a thousand people availed themselves, and a very enjoyable
finale, to the dedication and luncheon was the result. The
juveniles were not forgotten, for upwards of seven thousand
of them, from the different public and Sunday schools, were
provided with games and delicacies in abundance, in an
adjoining paddock. The public of the city of Prahran, in
token of their great obligation to Mr. Taylor in respect of the
parks and gardens, which he had been instrumental in secur-
ing for them, and in recognition of the unparalleled hospitality
both of himself and Mrs. Taylor, took advantage of the occa-
sion of a return ball to present both with illuminated addresses,
and the latter with a diamond bracelet, expressing incisively,
at the same time, the respect and esteem in which both were
held. His term of office expiring on the 12th of August, Mr.
Taylor again presented himself to the ratepayers, and in the
teeth of a most determined and unaccountable opposition by
that section of the community that had gained most by his
liberality of views and clear-sightedness, was returned at the
head of the poll, with the exceptionally large number of 2393
votes. Drainage, sanitary, and street improvements have
always been consistently advocated by Mr. Taylor, and his
warm support in the matter of a suitable building for a Town
Hall, helped in carrying the motion for the floating Oi a loan
of £75,000 for that purpose.
His continuous and tried local services, at this time, pointed
him out to the electors as a fit representative for the electorate
of St. Kilda in the Legislative Assembly, and, against his
inclination, he wishing to present himself for South Bourke,


where he possessed large interests, he was induced to stand for
that constituency. The evanescence of popularity is imme-
morial, and Mr. Taylor’s contest for legislative honors only
added another exemplification in verification of the aphorism
anent a man never being a prophet in his own country.
Electioneering tactics prevailed, and that especially in the
portion of the electorate where he ought to have been trusted
implicitly, having proved his consistency, probity, and desire
for the advancement of Prahran. Those who were in a posi-
tion to recall the services of Mr. Taylor, expressed the deepest
regret at his defeat, and sympathised with him heartily. No
doubt should Mr. Taylor offer himself again for the represen-
tation of the electorate which rejected him in 1886, that con-
stituency may probably have awoke to the truth that it once
ignored the claims and qualifications of a really useful man. If
not, Mr. Taylor should have no difficulty in successfully contest-
ing South Bourke or some other district. Some six months ago
Mr. Taylor, with his family, departed for Europe to enjoy a
well-earned holiday. Since his arrival in England he has been
selected as a candidate in the Liberal interest for a seat in the
Imperial House of Commons.
THE ORIENTAL TEA CO.
The rapid development of the wants of the Australasian
colonies has been one of the most marked features in their
short but eventful history. Doubtless this is due mainly to
the fact that the community, as a whole, is able and willing
to pay for the best, and the supply has naturally followed.
Australians from the first have been a great tea-drinking
people. Whatever may be said as to the consumption of
spirits, beer, or other liquids in the colonies, the national
drink par excellence has been, and still is, Tea.
The “pot ” or cup of tea, both in town and country, with
the farmer, the miner, and the stockman, is regarded almost
as a necessary adjunct to every meal amongst the majority.
Visitors from other countries never fail to remark the
peculiarity of this custom, and speculate as to the influences
which have induced the acclimitisation and adoption in Aus-
tralia of a Tartar practice. Eussia alone of the European
Continental Nations makes tea the popular beverage, a habit
doubtless due to the national extraction of its people. With the
taste for, and the means to supply the want in Australia, it is
by no means surprising that the demand year by year for a
superior article has increased with our growing population.
The “posts and rails,” which atone time represented the bulk
of the tea consumed in these colonies, is now a thing of the
past. The gardens of China, India, Ceylon, and Java are
ransacked to supply their best growths to meet the improved
public taste. Harsh, crude, and raspy teas, blunting the
palate and injuring the nervous system are now wholly out of
favour. The Australian tea-drinker has been educated, and
what is now required are those delicate blends combining all
the flavour of the rich leaf, without the dangerous elements
of coarser growths. To meet this public want, and to supply
Australia with teas equal if not superior to those vended to Eng-
lish consumers by Horniman, Twining, and other London firms,
the Oriental Tea Co.—-a plate of appears on
th pposite page—was founded in 1876.
The definite object for which this company was formed was
to supply a better class of teas to the community, and at the
same time to afford consumers a wider selection than, under
the old system, was practical. To effect this object consider-
able capital had not only to be found, but a staff of experts
selected, qualified to ensure success. Commodious premises
were secured in Flinders Lane West, the site selected being a
most fortunate one, directly in the centre of all shipping and
railway outlets.
The success which has attended so far the company’s opera-
tions is, however, the best and surest evidence that a public
want has been met, whilst the numerous attempts by rival
traders to follow the example set, is a flattering tribute to the
business capacity of the originators of the Oriental Tea Co.
As it would be impossible for the numerous consumers of the
company’s teas to visit their extensive establishment, it may
be well briefly to describe its most striking features. The
building itself is constructed of brick, upon bluestone of
massive character. This ensures, at all times, an equable
temperature for the delicate task of tea blending. On the
ground floor will be found the company’s offices, storage rooms
for packed and bulk teas, carpenter’s shop, and the usual
conveniences for the receipt and delivery of goods. The bulk
of the tea, however, as is usual, is kept in bond, but the large
turnover of the company tends to keep up a steady inflow and
outflow of tea throughout the year, so that it is only by bear-
ing this in mind that the visitors can fairly judge of the
extent of the trade done.
The most important, though not one of the largest rooms on
the first floor, is devoted to the tasting department. Here the
expert tests and determines the value and qualities of the teas
submitted for selection, assorts and decides on which blends
are most suitable to he public want, and detects any impuri-
ties or adulteration. It need hardly be said that here the
strictest supervision is exercised, because the passing of a tea
not up to the standard, would mean a disarrangement of the
company’s blends. The teas having passed the expert, we
have to proceed to the top flat, so as to follow the sequence of
operations until it becomes stamped with the company’s trade
mark, as a voucher for its character. There we find the teas
of “ all nations” waiting for use, (as shown in the right hand
smaller cut); some of these are repacked in packages to meet
the special wants of the market, for, in addition to its blend-
ing business, the company does a large trade in China, Indian,
and Ceylon teas in bulk. Those selected for blending are
unpacked and transferred to the room specially set apart for
that purpose. Now, blending is an art, and differs as much
from grocer’s hand-mixing as cheese does from chalk. The
greatest care is, therefore, required, not only to ensure the
success of a blend, but that the special quality of each tea
shall be preserved, and not destroyed. The teas are emptied
into the cylinder (shown in the plate on the left-hand-side of
our engraving) with mathematical precision. This revolves by
machinery, mixing all its contents equally together. To form
some idea of what this process means, it should be stated
that the mixer holds 4000 pounds weight of tea for a charge,
and some blends reach the proportion of nearly a quarter of a
million pounds weight before a change is made. From the
mixer the tea passes to the hoppers, which communicate by

shoots with the packing rooms below, and is there received
by the packers, whose work it is to fill the packets. Each
packet is twice weighed to ensure accuracy, first when filled
and afterwards when closed and ready for despatch. All the
work is done by women, whose more delicate fingers enable
them to manipulate the packets more quickly than men.
The greatest attention is paid to cleanliness, which is so
requisite in dealing with a delicate article such as tea. The
progress of the Oriental Tea Co.’s business is shown by the
fact that whilst in 1881-2 it paid duty on 408,856 lbs. of
tea, in 1884-5 it increased to 535,440 lbs., and in 1886-7 to
805,840 lbs. The large amount of support given to the
Company is due to several causes. First it has made blending
a science, and in securing the best teas of all growths has
been able to give the public an article so superior in quality
to the usual run of teas, that a first trial is always followed by
a regular demand. Again, the secret of uniformity has been
attained, not good tea one month and bad the next, but
always up to the standard, fixed so high as to challenge com-
petition. Inferior and damaged teas which are often blended
by some persons to get rid of an unsaleable article, are never
allowed on the Company’s premises. The company import or
purchase only such teas as are suitable for their blends, and at
the commencement of every new season fix their standard
quality, from which they do not vary throughout the year.
The reputation of the Company has been formed on the
solid basis of providing the best article obtainable for money.
No gifts, such as books or prizes, are given to compensate for
an inferior quality of tea, for the public must be alive to
the fact that valuable prize packets or handsome books are
not provided by the tea-seller at anybody’s cost but that of
the buyer. If you want a handsome book go to the bookseller
for it, and if you want a good tea buy it. By adopting this
plan you ensure fair value for your money—and this is what
the Oriental Tea Co. offers to its customers.
HON. LOUIS LAWRENCE SMITH, M.D.,
M.L.A.
The view facing this short biograpical sketch is that of a
house as well-known, perhaps, as the features and the name of
the owner of it. Everyone who has had occasion to proceed
through Collins-street, Melbourne, towards the Treasury
Buildings, will at once acknowledge the truthfulness with
which the house of the doctor is now shown. Of Dr. Smith him-
self, enough has been written in our other publication —The
Representative Men of Australia, —yet for the benefit of those
who may not have perused that work, we shall give once
again a synoptical sketch of his early life and career.
Louis Lawrence Smith, the son of Mr. E. T. Smith, of
London, who was looked upon by the British public as
°ne of the most enterprising men of his day, was born
in London in 1830, and commenced his studies at St.
Saviour's Grammar School. Desirous of following the
medical profession, on the completion of his preliminary
education at St. Saviour’s he was transferred to the Eeole de
Medicine at Paris. He was well known as having sprung
from a fighting stock, for both his maternal and paternal
ancestors distinguished themselves in the naval service of
Great Britain, and obtained high positions. During the
Revolution in France in 1848 Dr. Smith, remembering his
descent, could not be withheld from taking an active part in
the fight that resulted, and was almost immortalised “as the
young Englishman, who was carried shoulder high by the
populace when Louise Phillippe escaped from France.” He
(Dr. Smith) was twice captured by the garde nmnicipale and
twice rescued by the Republicans during the fighting within
the barriers. On leaving Paris, the doctor returned to London
and had himself entered at the Westminister Hospital, where
he distinguished himself by gaining the first prize for medi-
cine, botany, midwifery, medical jurisprudence, and chemistry,
besides numberless honorary certificates. After he obtained
his diploma he commenced practice in London, but the
furore created in England about this time, consequent on the dis-
covery of gold in Australia, impelled him to forego his daily-
increasing practice and emigrate. The Oriental, being in
want of a surgeon, the young doctor accepted the position and
came to Victoria. The vioissit ides of a digger’s life did not
altogether enthral him, more especially as the yellow metal
did not fall to his share. He returned to Melbourne, and
started practising his profession in Bourke-street. In 1859
his popularity was so established that he was requested to
allow himself to be nominated for Legislative honors; he
consented, stood for East Bourke in the Liberal interest, and
was triumphantly returned. He was subsequently re-elected
and returned at the head of the poll on five different occa-
sions for the same constituency. Though brusque in manner,
he has always been looked upon as an honest and consistent
politician, and his terse and incisive speeches on all the
burning questions of the times have been listened to with
attention and respect. In order to prove his independence
Dr. Smith, on one occasion, resenting what he opined as an
intentional insult, boxed the ears of one of the Ministers in
the House, and then resigned his seat; but his constituents
re-nominated him and returned him at the head of the poll.
Never swerving from the path to which principle pointed, he
opposed the wishes of his constituents on one occasion by
peremptorily setting his face against the “ Darling Grant.”
This opposition severed his connection with East Bourke, but
Richmond accepted him, and he was again placed in the
Assembly Chamber. He strenuously opposed the Reform
known as the Norwegian scheme, introduced by the late Hon.
J. G. Francis. For his clear-sightedness in this matter his
constituents rewarded him by rejecting him at the next elec-
tion, but, seeing their error, they placed him at the head of
the poll again at the following general election of 1877. In fos-
tering the interests of the agricultural, pastoral and manufac-
turing classes, he has always advocated the entire irrigation of
the colony. No individual member in the House has rendered
the country better service than the Honorable Doctor.
Among the various works might be mentioned the Bill for the
Regulation and Preservation of Fisheries, and the reduc-
tion of the fishermen’s license ; the Game Amendment Act •
the amended postal system, which reduced the rates from
fourpence to twopence ; the initiation of penny postal cards •
and the advocacy for a fish market, for which he publicly


received the thanks of the Melbourne Corporation. He like-
wise carried in 1878, a resolution for the postage on all inland
letters to be reduced to one penny. Dr. Smith built the
Polytechnic Institute in Bourke-street, but failed to arouse
sufficient interest to make that institute successful. Notwith-
standing the heavy demand on his time, he has devoted some
attention to literary matters, and is the author of a large
number of works, and was the proprietor and editor of
several newspapers, which advocated Liberal principles. He
was for several years proprietor of the Australian Journal, and
was the first to publish and edit a medical journal in Vic-
toria.
His connection with viticulture is too well known to require
dilation upon. The fact of the recently-acquired high repu"
tation and the encouraging effect upon the industry in Vic-
toria might, without hesitation, be accredited to the “ father
of the industry ” —Dr. L. L. Smith. His samples of Victorian
champagne, competed with upwards of a hundred varieties of
that wine of European celebrity at the International Exhibi-
tion of 1880-81, and were awarded equal prizes with Krug
and Co. The Duke of Manchester, when tasting some of the
wine manufactured by the doctor, endorsed the fiat of the
judges who awarded him prizes at the above-mentioned
Exhibition.
Dr. Smith acted as President of the Eoyal Commission, in
connection with wine at Bordeaux and Amsterdam, and was
inducted into the chair in connection with the Wine, Grain,
and Fruit Industrial Exhibition, which was carried out by
public subscription. In his capacity as Chairman of the
Exhibition Trustees, he advocated the establishment of the
Aquarium and Fernery, and these, it must be said, add
materially to the beauty of the place. Much need not be
written about his attempt to prove to Victorians what really
could be done in the way of model farming; for his model
farm, on which he expended upwards of £20,000, is as well
known as his racing establishment. Although owning a very
large stud, and constantly winning prizes with his horses, he
never bets, and merely indulges in the sport as a pastime. Dr.
Smith recently made a tour through Europe, America, and
Canada, and, though on pleasure bent, remembered the Vic-
torians, as evidenced in the numerous suggestions conveyed
through the press, for the welfare of the industries of the colony.
In 1887 he was elected Vice-President of the Chamber of Manu-
factures, and was deputed by that Chamber to meet delegates
from other colonies at Adelaide to initiate Intercolonial Free-
Trade. He now represents the constituency of Mornington in
the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.
THE NEW PRINCESS THEATRE.
The new Princess Theatre has many advantages in the way
of theatrical construction which no other theatre in the world
possesses, the first being that of the marble staircase and
handsome foyer public, with its open balconies, thus enabling
the theatre-going public to enjoy the open air during the
intervals. The auditorium is at once very noticeable, by the
sweet curves to the balcony fronts being so distinct fiom any
theatre in the colonies. The ceiling of the auditorium has
the novelty of a sliding roof, combined with a sliding ceiling,
which both together have never been introduced in any part of
the world, and which on the warmest nights give the theatre
a wonderfully cool effect. Over the dress-circle boxes are
introduced for the first time in any theatre, two alcoves,
which, when opened between the acts, show waterfalls and
ferneries, which have a very pleasing effect to the eye. The
appearance of the theatre from Spring-street is very notice-
able, being carried out in the Italian renaissance style of
architecture, with a bold portico in the centre, and large pro-
jecting wings at each end, the centre being surmounted with
the goddess Fame, flanked on each side by lions couchant,
while immediately underneath the goddess appears the
British coat of arms, making the fagade one of the hand-
somest in the city. The success of the new Princess, with all
its novelties, has brought without doubt Mr. W. Pitt forward
as one of the first architects in the colony.
The theory in regal'd to first impressions in connection with
animate objects may be said, in a great measure, to hold good
in regard to inanimate objects, and the effect produced upon
the visitor to Mr. Pitt’s creation—the new Princess Theatre—
by the main entrance, the marble staircase and the handsome
foyer public, is as prepossessing as that which a stranger
experiences on ascending to the corresponding portions of the
house in the Grand Opera in Paris, the Stait Theatre in
Frankfort, and the Grand Theatre in Bordeaux, which contain
the finest approaches and foyers in Europe. The building,
whilst in existence, will stand a monument to the skill of the
designer and architect, and undoubtedly set at rest the oft-
recurring question of the wisdom of pitting Colonial and
“ native” against European talent. In the design there are
occasional suggestions of the French style of architecture—a
departure from rule excused by the detail of the interior of
the theatre. To experts, the attractive feature in the building
is the cleverness shown by Mr. Pitt in devising an air of
loftiness for a two-story building not at all happily placed for
such effects.
Mr. Pitt was born in the year 1855, and received his pre-
paratory education at Howful School, St. Kilda, Melbourne,
and finished his scholastic studies at Mr. Neighbo xr’s Carlton
College, after which he commenced his apprenticeship as an
architect. In the year 1879 he started in the practice of his
profession, and at once distinguished himself by winning the
first prize for his design of the Melbourne Coffee Palacei
Bourke-street, beating nineteen competitors. He also prepared
all the working plans and drawings, and supervised the
erection of the building. This building forms a pronvnent
feature in Melbourne architecture on account of its height,
and Mr. Pitt can well claim the honour of having been the
first to introduce buildings of this type. He immediately
followed this success by securing the first prize for the new
Bridge over the Yarra, in conjunction with Mr. Merrit.
The ceremony of the laying of the foundation-stone of this
bridge, wh ?n so many thousands gathered to witness the
proceedings, will be fresh within the memory of nearly every
citizen of Melbourne. In the same year he succeeded in
winning the first prize for the design of the Premier
Permanent Building Society’s edifice. The following year he
was engaged in the alterations to the old Colosseum, Bourke.

street, and in erecting at the back thereof the present Victoria
Hall. After this, he was called to Sydney to prepare plans for
the new Queen’s Theatre, and make extensive alterations in the
Opera House there. In the year 1884 he was chosen architect
for Mr. Coppin’s Improved Lodging-houses and Dwellings,
which contain large kitchens, reading-rooms, smoking-rooms,
and other conveniences for lodgers, and have accommodation
for 300 beds. He next succeeded in gaining the second prize
for the Federal Coffee Palace, Collins and King streets, and
his services were retained in conjunction with the first prize-
takers to carry out the erection of the building, which is the
largest and handsomest of its class in Melbourne, being seven
storeys in height, and having as many as 500 bedrooms.
Mr. Pitt has also erected a considerable number of other
buildings, including churches, mansions, villas, hotels, and
training stables. He was appointed by the Legislative Council
to give evidence, as an expert, as to the condition of the
present Melbourne Hospital building. Mr. Pitt combines the
profession of surveyor with that of architect, His next work
on a large scale will be the erection of a new coffee palace at
Brighton, which will be fitted up in a most elaborate style and
will contain 200 bedrooms and all possible conveniences. The
elevation is to he of an imposing character in the French
renaissance style, relieved with colonnades and balconies, and
surmounted with the French mansard roof.
He is a man of genial and winning manners, and as a private
citizen, as well as a professional man, he is highly esteemed. He
has taken no active part in political matters up to the present.
PRINCE OF WALES HOTEL, FRANKSTON.
The proprietor of the above well-known hotel is Mr. Oliver
Dolphin, -who was born in Leicester, England, in 1851, and
came to Victoria at the age of 18, and followed various occupa-
tions until 1863, when he began business at Shepparton as a
manufacturer of soda water and cordials. So popular was he
with the citizens of that place that upon signifying his inten-
tion of removing from the town he was presented with a tes-
timonial, the cost of which was one hundred guineas. He
secured a Melbourne hotel for a short time, but perceiving the
advantages which Frankston presented as a summer resort, he
secured the Prince of Wales Hotel, and removed to it about
one year after its erection. He immediately proceeded to
make the interior comfortable for his guests. He also spared
no pains or expense in laying out and embellishing the sur-
rounding grounds. The situation of the hotel is admirable, being
but a few seconds’ walk from the beautiful beach, and flanked
by the stream which enters Hobson’s Bay at this point. The
Prince of Wales offers a cool and pleasant home for the tired
man of business, or families seeking health and recreation.
Visitors are furnished with boats and all the necessary require-
ments for fishing expeditions. Traps are also kept for those
who are desirous of making inland excursions. Mr. Dolphin
is the President of the Frankston Cricket Club, and his hotel
is the head quarters for the Melbourne Cricket Club when
visiting that part of the coast. An especial feature of the
Prince of Wales should not be forgotten, viz., the musical and
other parties originated by Mr. Dolphin for the entertainment
of his guests.
GREGG’S HOTEL, SOUTH BRIGHTON.
This well-known hotel has been in the possession of Mr.
Gregg, the present proprietor, for the past twenty years. It is
celebrated for its situation, and its salubrious air, which is a
happy medium between the air of the sea, and that of the
interior. Just far enough removed from the ocean, the at-
mosphere is pregnant with saline qualities and ozone, mak-
ing it stimulating, and at the same time healing.
Leading members of the Medical Faculty have repeatedly
urged Mr. Gregg to build extensive premises, for the reception
of invalid guests, as they consider the situation one of the
most favoured in Victoria. Deeming such an establishment
calculated to bring increased care and trouble, he has declined
to comply with the requests, and confined his attention to
looking after his guests and customers with a care and
assiduity, which leaves nothing to be desired. Several of
the champion athletes of the world have trained upon the
premises, and expressed entire satisfaction at the results.
Much of his time, and no expense, has been spared in beauti-
fying his grounds, and making his hotel a home for families
requiring a change of air, or pleasure parties bent upon a
day’s outing.
Among the special attractions may be mentioned a laby-
rinth, considerably larger than that of Hampton Court, Lon-
don, which is celebrated throughout Europe. This unique
plantation covers several acres, and is a never-failing source
of perplexity and amusement to visitors. Mr. Gregg’s
grounds contain many rare birds and animals, collected at
very considerable expense, among which some Timor ponies
are found, having no equals in Australia. Mr. Gregg was for
many years connected with the Argus, and, as a reward for his
labours, has amassed a handsome fortune. Intending visi-
tors should remember that the South Brighton Kailway
premises is built upon part of his estate.
THE FREEHOLD INVESTMENT AND
BANKING COMPANY OF AUSTRALIA,
LIMITED.
This company was founded about years ago by Mr.
J. Bartlett Davies, the managing director. It was the first
institution to combine investment in landed property with the
business of an ordinary mortgage bank.
Mr. Davies had some years before started the Australian
Deposit and Mortgage Bank, of which he was manager until
he resigned to start the company, under which, and in his
official capacity, he had ample opportunities of noticing the
substantial profits made by persons investing money obtained
from the bank in landed property, while the bank, incurring
all the risk, if any, had to be content with a bare 1 or 2 per
cent, margin of profit on the transaction. Noticing results,
Mr. Davies came to the conclusion that a company, con-
ducted on sound principles, with a large capital, would be
even more successful than an individual. He communicated
his ideas to a few friends, and they being satisfied with the
practicability of the scheme, the result was the formation
of the Freehold Investment and Banking Company of
Australia, Limited, with a first issue of 40,000 shares, all of
which were readily subscribed for.

The first directors were J. Bartlett Davies, Hon. M. H. Davies
(the present Speaker of the Legislative Assembly), John
Moodie, Esq., and Hon. C. H. James. The last named shortly
afterwards retired, and the directorate has since remained
unaltered. Mr. T. K. B. Morton, who had been accountant to
the Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank from its com-
mencement, was appointed Secretary, and still retains that
position.
In addition to conducting ordinary banking business the
company’s memorandum of association empowers it to invest
in landed property, both freehold and leasehold. Its pro-
moters decided that it should be of a permanent nature, not
formed merely to take advantage of some anticipated sudden
jump in values of property, but basing its investments on
normal values.
When the directors, making use of this power, commenced
to deal in land, many persons who considered themselves
authorities, condemned this “out of the ordinary” way of
doing business, but the directors, who had thoroughly
considered the practicability of their scheme, ignored the
opinions of these wiseacres, and carried out their ideas
with such satisfactory results, that the company is now
recognised as one of the most prosperous and stable financial
nstitutions in the colony, and, along with others of a similar
nature called into existence by its success, enjoys a full share
of public support.
The company’s investments, so far, have been chiefly of
two kinds, viz., properties in the city, and properties in the
suburbs of Melbourne. Bearing in mind that the company
was formed on a permanent basis, and feeling assured of the
continued prosperity and growth of Melbourne, the directors,
while availing themselves of every opportunity of buying a
bargain for re-sale at a quick profit, have aimed mainly at
securing properties, with a view of holding, in positions that
are likely to become first-class.
Most of the city properties have been purchased, with the
intention of erecting suitable buildings thereon, and thereby
securing a steady income, by means of rents. At the present
time many of these purchases have increased three or four
times in value, and whenever the company has deemed
it advisable to part with a property there has always
been a substantial profit to show. Some three years
ago the extensive premises, on the site opposite the
Town Hall, known as Nicholson’s Corner, were erected
by the company, and the shops and offices have been
let at very satisfactory rents to first-class tenants, while on the
opposite corner it is just about completing the erection of a
magnificent block of buildings (a view of which appears here-
with) comprising an arcade, to be called “ Queen’s Walk,”
running from Swanston-street to Collins-street, a large
exchange, auction room, shops, club rooms, &e., with the
company’s head office at the main corner. It is estimated
that the revenue from these two buildings alone will be as
much as £20,000 a year, an amount which will leave a
very respectable margin over interest and all other charges.
With regard to suburban properties the Directors aim at
purchasing at moderate prices large blocks of land which are
so situated that they are bound to become valuable in a
reasonable time, and after improving them, selling in building
allotments as opportunities occur. One notable transaction of
this kind by the company was the sale of the now well-
known Windsor Park Estate, Suney Hills, the sale of which
opened up that picturesque suburb, and yielded a very hand-
some profit to the company.
The subscribed capital of the company was at first
£1,000,000, in 40,000 shares of £25 each ; it is now
£1,500,000, in 60,000 shares, with £215,000 paid up. There
is a general reserve fund, and a dividend reserve fund, and
since only a portion of the profits are paid out by way of
dividends, the strength and stability of the company increases
every half-year. The total amount of reserves at present is
£Bl,OOO.
By February, 1886, at the termination of the 7th half-year,
the properties had increased so much in value that it was
considered necessary to have a re-valuation made by Messrs.
C. J. and T. Ham, and Fraser and Co. After reducing this
valuation by £60,000, so as to allow for any possible over-
estimation, the directors recommended that the balance
should be treated as profit, and accordingly a bonus of 355.
per share was declared, and paid in addition to the usual
dividend of 8 per cent. In order, however, that the company
should not be weakened by the payment of such a very large
sum, the directors arranged that shareholders should
simultaneously pay to the company an additional sum of
£1 10s. per share on all shares previously paid up to £1 only,
and the same policy has since been pursued proportionately
when other bonuses have been declared. Thus, shares on
which only £1 in cash was originally paid, have been paid up,
virtually out of profits, to £2 155., and dividends are payable
on the larger amount, while the present reserve fund and
undivided profits are equal to £1 7s. per share. The market
value of these shares is £9 to £lO each, and were the whole
of the properties realised, it is believed by some authorities
that even a larger amount would be payable to holders.
Since the last valuation was made, in February, 1886, a very
large actual increase has taken place.
The following table shows the growth of the Company to
the 31st of August, 1887 :

THE PRAHRAN HOME AND COFFEE
HOUSE COMPANY, LIMITED.
Proprietors ot the South Yarra Coffee Palace, '
the St. Kilda Coffee Palace, and the Prahran ]
Coffee Tavern.
We present our readers with illustrations of the above Coffee
Palaces and also with a portrait of J. B. Crews, Esq., J.P.,
which will be found interesting. The foundation stone of the ■
Prahran building was laid by J. B. Crews, Esq., J.P., January
31st, 1880, and opened by Sir Janies McCulloch in July of the
same year. It was amongst the first (if not the first) Coffee
Tavern registered in Victoria. For some time the new
departure was not successful, and but for the energy and ■
perseverance of the promoters, must have terminated in !
failure. Gradually the public became aware of the numerous
advantages possessed by a Coffee Palace over the ordinary '
boarding-house and hotel, at which intoxicating drinks are
sold, and well-deserved success came in consequence.
Fortified by experience and encouraged in their laudable
endeavours, they decided upon opening a similar institution at
St. Kilda, and they were fortunate in securing an excellent
and commodious site in Grey-street, but half a minute’s walk
from the railway station. The premises had formerly been
in use as an assembly room, and later as a skating rink.
Messrs. Henderson and Smart, architects, were instructed by
the Directors to prepaie the necessary plans and
specifications, and under their supervision the work was
carried out to the entire satisfaction of all parties concerned.
The St. Kilda Coffee Palace was opened by G. Shaw, Esq.,
Mayor of St. Kilda, on the 17th of April, 1882. Since that
time it has been under the managemement of Mr. and Mrs.
Edyson, who have made it the most popular and comfortable
seaside Temperance Hotel in this colony.
An excellent site was secured by the directors for a Coffee
Palace in Toorak Koad, near the South Yarra railway station;
and upon it erected a magnificent structure replete with every
requisite for a first-class Temperance Hotel. The memorial
stone was laid by the managing Director, J.B. Crews, Esq., J.P.,
on the 12th of July, 1886, and opened by Sir James Macßainon
the Ist of February, 1887. The step taken by the Directors
has been amply justified by the unqualified success of this, their
last addition to the properties of the Company. This success is
in a marked degree due to the indefatigable energy and volun-
tary exertions of Mr. Crews, who, from the organisation of the
Company, has given much valuable time and oversight to
advancing its interests. It must be highly gratifying to that
gentleman and his co-workers, to feel that their efforts have
proved such an undeniable success. The present Directors
are Messrs. J. B. Crews, W. Robinson, J. Hole, J. E. Heath,
H. Eayson, G. Prowse, and J. H. Furneaux.
The history of the Coffee Palace movement in Victoria
is full of significance, and clearly marks an advance in the
moral and intellectual development of the people. It is the
handwriting on the wall foretelling the gradual decay of the
grog shop, and the creation in its stead of comfortable,
quiet and respectable houses of accommodation. Now that
Coffee Palaces are proved successes from a financial as well
as a social and moral standpoint, no trouble is experienced
in securing the co-operation of capitalists, but it should not
be forgotten that the primary credit is due to such men as the
directors and stock-holders of the Prahran Home and Coffee
House Company Limited.
JOHN BRANSCOMBE CREWS, J.P.
John Beanscombe Chews, J.P., the subject of our memoir,
was born at St. John’s, Newfoundland, 1815, and in very early
life went to Devonshire in England. He is the second son of
Mr. Chas. Crews, of Newton Abbott. He married, in 1838,
Sarah, daughter of Mr Gregory Weatherton, of Newton
Abbott, Devonshire, He emigrated to Australia and arrived
in Melbourne in 1852. Soon after his arrival he started
business as a baker, &c., in Prahran, where he has resided
ever since. He ultimately started business as an auctioneer,
&c., which he only relinquished in 1885. During the time he
has resided in the district he has taken a very active and
prominent part in politics, he having been for many years a
member of the local Municipal Council (and the first Mayor
of the same), from which he only retired in 1887 at the age of
72. During the latter period of his time in the Council he
strongly advocated dividing the City into Wards, which has
since been accomplished, mainly through his exertions, but
his great and most successful effort has been the establish-
ment of the Prahran Home and Coffee House Company, with
which he has been connected from the start, and as managing
Director has been head and front of its unqualified success.
He was elected to the Victorian Parliament as the first
member for St. Kilda under universal suffrage, and was like-
wise elected three times for South Bourke. He was a
member of the old Central Board of Health, has been
President of the Victoria Permanent Building Society nearly
from the start, which is one of the most successful
institutions of its kind in the colony. In private life he is
generous and charitable, as many a poor family in the district
he resides in can testify to. He is a Wesleyan, and has taken
an active and prominent part in the progress and prosperity
of that denomination. He has served in all the offices which
are available to laymen, with honor and credit. At the age
of 72 he is hale and hearty and retains all his faculties, with
every prospect of being spared for many years to give to the
community his practical advice. Full of years and honor, Mr.
Crews is a pioneer whose career is an honor to the colony of
Victoria.
ROBISON BROS. & CO.
Eobison Bros, and Co., of 31 Flinders-street west, Melbourne,
date the establishment of their works from 1854; the head of
the firm having arrived from Edinburgh in 1862. With a
force of 250 employes, and extensive works at Moray-street,
South Melbourne; machinery bond at Normanby-road, South
Melbourne ; and copper works at 81 Flinders-street west, they,
as engineers, boiler-makers, brassfounders, coppersmiths,
plumbers, sheet lead and lead pipe manufacturers and ma-
chinery importers, command a very extensive and profitable


trade. The following are their special lines: —Eobison’s
Patent Centrifugal Pumps, which they claim are constructed
upon a new principle, and will discharge more water with the
power applied than those of any other maker in the world.
These pumps were used in floating the sunken and stranded
steamers “ Austral,” “ Borata,” “ Dawn,” “ Pretty Jane,”
“ Queenscliff,” “ Eodondo,” and “ Waihora.” In the Engi-
neer’s report of the Echuca and Waranga Water Trust the
following appears:— 11 1 attended at the pumping station on
the Bth inst., and finding everything complete, I officially took
possession. At the time the pumps were throwing 30,000,000
gallons of water per 24 hours, or 50 per cent, more than the
Trust contracted for. I am of opinion that Robison Bros,
and Co. have carried out their contract in an excellent
manner.”
Australasian, Nov. 18,1882. —“ The disaster to the splendid
ship ‘ Austral’ has brought the ‘ Royal George’ (figuratively)
to the surface after having been sunk for a century. The
sympathy with the enterprising and plucky Orient Company
was wide-spread, deserved, and deep. There are just now two
facts which gratify the amour propre of Melbourne. First,
H.M. big ship had to come to Melbourne to be docked; and,
secondly, the intimation of the sinking of the ‘ Austral’ is
accompanied with the flattering announcement that the agents
had ‘sent to Melbourne for the pumps,’ by the aid of which it
is hoped to raise her. These are the graceful competitions
which need no figures of speech to emphasise them.”
The following is from their Trade Circular :—“ Our special
study for the last thirty years has been Hydraulic Machinery,
and we are thoroughly posted up in all that has been done
both in Europe and America. The construction of our Patent
Centrifugal Pump is so entirely novel that we can guarantee
that no Centrifugal Pump by any maker can deliver as much
water with the power applied. Intending purchasers are
invited to call on us, as we are prepared to show the reason
why our pumps are so infinitely superior to those of other
manufacturers.”
BERNARD KING.
Ever since Monday, the first day of January, 1838, when the
Melbourne Advertiser, written for and published by Mr. John
P. Fawkner, appeared, there has been advance of literature
in Victoria compatible with the colony’s rapid progress in
commerce and trade. Intellectual activity measures pretty
accurately the commercial influence of a country. The inces-
sant intercourse kept up during the five centuries before
Christ by the communities scattered around the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea, was highly conducive to the propagation
of thought. Such an intercourse furnishes excitement to
intellectual activity. In this respect the contrast pre-
sented by a commercial community to an agricultural one is
very striking. The very name of pagan, which in many minds
is erroneously connected with a form cf religion, derives its
designation from the stolidity with which the agriculturists of
early days adhered to their ancestral traditions. Such a state
of things is detrimental to intellectual development. Men
devoted to literature, it is said, are impractical. But this is
not so. Our foremost statesmen of the present day have been
and are remarkable for their literary productions. We may
mention the names of the Duke of Argyle and Mr. Gladstone,
and not to enumerate the long list of those distinguished in
letters in earlier days, we need only call the reader’s
attention to the names of the late Lord Beaconsfield and
Edmund Burke.
Aristotle kept a druggist’s shop in Athens, and Plato sold
oil in Egypt, and both these men were intellectual giants.
These considerations go to prove that commerce fosters intel-
lectual activity, while it, in turn, is no bar to the development
of a country. The progress of national literature indicates a
people’s advance from a rude and unsettled position to
one of leisure and comfort. When this present colony of
Victoria was but a sheep walk, Melbourne was only
a depot and forwarding agency of the stores which
were transmitted to country stations. But with its
growth in commerce came a desire for knowledge and infor-
mation. Even in a young colony the want of books is felt.
There is always a certain number among the population who
require relaxation different from what public amusements
afford. This they find in mental culture of one kind or
another, but chiefly in reading; hence the necessity for books.
Literature has its patrons in all lands except in those sunk in
the deepest barbarianism. Among the lower classes of society
a taste for reading exists, as among the educated and more
refined classes. The introduction of high-class literature
tends to enlighten the minds of the people as well as educate
and elevate the feelings.
Nowadays discovery and research has led to so vast a fund of
information that it requires a large amount of reading to keep
up even a mediocre knowledge of what the most noted authors
think and write. It would be impossible to peruse in the
most cursory manner the number of books which are daily
leaving the publishers’ hands. It therefore behoves those
who may be the lucky possessors of a large amount
of spare time, to make a judicious selection of their
books, while it is incumbent upon those having little
spare time to be doubly careful in their choice. The
reading public of Victoria can have no grounds of com-
plaint on the score of reading, since there are mechanics’
institutes and public libraries scattered throughout the colony,
not to say anything of the extensive stock of books, dealing
with the most profound subjects as well as those of ephemeral
existence, kept by the numerous booksellers. Far otherwise
was it in the infancy of the colony, when Mr. Fawkner began
to import British books and magazines for the delectation of
the visitors to his hotel.
While, however, it is possible to obtain every description of
literature at the Melbourne bookshops, there may be those of a
special character which could not be immediately procured by
a purchaser. A visit to the establishment of the late Mr.
Bernard King, in Lonsdale-street east, Melbourne, has led us
to this conclusion. This gentleman was born in Dublin, and
arrived in the colony of Victoria in 1858. In 1860 he com-
menced business at the above address. Mr. King was as
ardent a patriot as he was a staunch Catholic, and estab-
lished a business devoted solely to the sale of Catholic books
and the devotional articles used by the members of that
communion. He also obtained a selection of all works

relating to Irish history, politics, and literature, a large stock
of which is to be seen at the establishment of which he was
the proprietor. During the quarter of a century in which Mr.
King carried on business, he formed a very large connection
among the clergy and laity of the different colonies. In
1862 he married Margaret Hennessy, youngest daughter of
Mr. Patrick Hennessy, of Cork. Eight children were the
result of this marriage, but four of them died during child-
hood. Mr. King was as amiable and charitable in private
life as he was honorable in business, and, though he seldom
took a prominent part in public national demonstrations, his
establishment was often the scene of warm discussions on those
subjects which he had so much at heart. After a long and
painful illness, Mr. King died on February 6, 1886, at the age
of 61, leaving three sons, Bernard, Joseph, and Ignatius, and
one daughter, Margaret, aged 12. Under the title of Bernard
King and Sons, the business has, since that event, been carried
on by Mrs. King and sons. One of them, the eldest, Mr.
Bernard M. King, lately visited Ireland, and since his return
distinguished himself as the writer of several stirring articles
in support of Home Eule for Ireland.
WEDDERBURN.
The village of Wedderburn owes its origin to the fact that in
the latter part of 1851, or early in 1852, a shepherd and two
little boys, who were tending their flocks near Mount Korong,
picked up a few small nuggets near the site of the gold fields
since known as Wedderburn and Kingower. Large numbers
of miners and speculators docked to the new field, and in a
short time the population rose to 5000. Some of the finds
were very rich. Among the number was the “ Blanche
Barkly” nugget, unearthed by Ambrose and Napier, and sold
for £3OOO, prior to which the lucky finders presented it for
inspection to the Queen, at Buckingham Palace. At Korong a
township was laid out, receiving the name of Wedderburn.
In 1855 attention was attracted to quartz mining, the reefs
being located in Queen’s Gully, at Lane’s Gully, and on Spe-
cimen Hill. A crushing plant, consisting of eight head of
stampers, was erected by Paterson, Pringle and Co., at
Kingower, the stone being conveyed from Wedderburn, a dis-
tance of 18 miles. The most notable crushing was from
Lane’s Beef, yielding 100 ounces to the ton, —the charge for
crushing being £6 per ton. Wedderburn gradually increased
in importance, and now boasts handsome public buildings,
including a literary institute, four churches, a bank, and
several handsome stores and hotels. In the early days the
population included many desperate characters, notably Sul-
livan, the New Zealand murderer. Happily a change for the
better soon came. One name stands out in the history of this
section, viz., the Hon. James Macpherson Grant, a gentleman
who was invited to represent the district in the Assembly in
1858, and continued to hold the position for 25 years, until
death closed his long and honourable service. He is remem-
bered with gratitude; his services in connection with the
liberal interpretation of the Land Act, while holding office as
Minister for Lands, proving of almost incalculable value to
many struggling settlers in all parts of the colony. For the ,
above facts we are indebted to Mr. Edward Graham Pringle.
THOMAS NAPIER, ESQ.,
Of Rosebank, Essendon.
Thomas Napier, late of Eosebank, Essendon, Victoria, was the
sth son of James Napier, of Marykirk, Scotland, by Margaret
Suttor his wife, and was born July 11, 1802, at Marykirk, near
Montrose. His father was engaged in the weaving trade.
When a boy he was sent to work on a neighboring farm, where
he learnt much that was useful to him afterwards as a
colonist. At 14 years of age he went to London to fill the
situation of a clerk in the business of his uncle, William
Napier (Napier and Harvey) a large timber and produce
merchant at Blackfriars Bridge. There he remained six
years—till he was 20 years of age. While at London his
uncle sent him to the best schools of painting to learn
that art. He was at the British Museum Gallery for two
years, and received while there a letter of introduction to that
distinguished artist, Sir David Wilkie. But, underrating his
own abilities, which were evident 1 y of no mean order, he did
not prosecute the art farther than in a private way.
Owing to unhappy social relationships he preferred to leave
his uncle’s employ and learn the carpentering trade in Scot-
land ; first at Montrose as an apprentice, and afterwards at
Arbroath as a journeyman. After learning the business he
started on his own account, and built several houses at
Montrose. About this time he made up his mind to go to
India, where he had an elder brother, John, in the East
India Company’s service at Moulmein. But on application
he was refused, not having received special permission from
the East India Company. He wrote to Joseph Hume, M.P.,
then representing Arbroath, to get the necessary recommen-
dations, but, through the adverse influence of some relative
he did not get any satisfaction from that person. Disap-
pointed in going to India, he shortly afterwards met a
gentleman, a Mr. Burns, recently arrived from Van Diemen’s
Land, who advised him to take passage to that place first,
and from thence to India, as there were no restrictions as to
vessels from that land.
He left Liverpool in the year 1832, by the ship “ Lavinia,”
Captain Gray, for Hobart Town, in company with John
Brown, (late of “ Como,” Toorak) with whom he had been as-
sociated in business in Scotland.
On his arrival in Hobart Town, on the sth November of the
same year, he was just in time to witness the bringing in of
the last lot of aboriginals by Mr. Robertson, the natives’ pro-
tector, being on their way to Flinders Island. He fortunately
was also in time to make good use of his artistic talent, and
by permission of the authorities, was enabled to paint on
canvas several portraits of the natives, prior to their removal,
some of which are still in the possession of the family.
Immediately on his arrival at Hobart Town, in company
with his partner, he erected several buildings, including one
for Franklin, the Colonial Secretary. While there, on the
3rd August, 1836, he married Jessie Paterson, the daughter
of Mr. James Paterson, of Montrose, and who had arrived by
the ship “ Evelyn ”in July of the same year. About this time
news of the settlement of Port Phillip by the Hentys, and of
Melbourne by Fawkner, had been carried to Hobart Town, and
many families were leaving that place for Port Phillip and


settling there. Mr. Napier, dissatisfied at the condition of
things in Van Diemen’s Land—which, at that time, was more
the abode of convicts and Government officials than of free
settlers—determined to sail over to Port Phillip and judge for
himself as to its suitability for settlement. Accordingly he
chartered a small schooner, the “ Gem,” and brought over in
her a cargo of timber for the new settlement at Melbourne in
March, 1837.
When he first landed no permanent houses had been
erected by the settlers, for no land had been sold up to that
date, and “wattle and daub” huts were generally the best
erections. The first land sale was in June of that year, when
he purchased an half-acre allotment in Collins-street, where
the Commercial Dank of Australasia now stands, for £2O
cash. At the third sale, held in Sydney, he, through a friend,
bought a quarter-acre allotment for the same amount—the
value of land having doubled in the interval of a few months.
This is where the Argus office now stands. Both these allot-
ments remained in his possession till his death in 1881, and
are now held in trust for his family. Governor Lonsdale was
then the superintendent, whose arbitrary treatment of the
early colonists caused much complaint.
After procuring an allotment, Mr. Napier built thereon a
comfortable “ wattle and daub” cottage, and then sent over to
Hobart Town for his wife, whom he had left behind with
friends. Here he followed his business for nearly two years,
and, in company with Mr. Rankin, built the first brick house
in Melbourne, which remained standing until very recently,
when it was pulled down to make way for the Salisbury
Buildings, at the corner of Bourke and Queen streets.
About this time settlement in the country around Mel-
bourne was advancing, and Mr. Napier availed himself of the
opportunity of settling in the neighborhood of the Dandenong
Creek as a bond fide squatter, having purchased a number of
cattle from a Mr. Hunter, from Sydney. Not being satisfied
with the nature of the pasture about Dandenong, he sold out
to a Mr. Scott, recently arrived from Edinburgh, at a satis-
factory price. Returning to Melbourne, he built for himself a
dwelling-house on the allotment now occupied by the Argus.
Por several years business was very much depressed, and
there was no country land sold by the Government, until
he, along with others, made request to the Sydney authori-
ties to put up for sale some country blocks. He procured
about 100 acres of land on the Moonee Ponds Creek, in 1845,
and has resided there ever since. During the period that he
was residing in Melbourne, after his return from the station,
Mr. Napier painted several portraits of friends, and executed
the first oil painting of a Pert Phillip blaekfellow, called
“ Jack Weatherley,” which is now in possession of the
family. To the blacks themselves it was a source of great
wonderment. They would come up in groups to the rooms
where he was at work to watch, poke the picture with their
fingers to see if it had life, and look behind to see if they
could find out the secret.
In April, 1842, Mr. Napier had the misadventure, in com-
pany with a Mr. Darling, of being stuck-up by two bush-
rangers—then a novelty in that part of the colony—while
travelling on the Dandenong-road. Fortunately, with the
exception of a horse and a little money stolen, no damage was
done to the travellers; and shortly afterwards the whole gang
of four bushrangers were either shot or captured by the
authorities.
Throughout the whole period of the gold rush Mr. Napier
remained unaffected by the abnormal excitement of the time,
and when most men were rushing madly into wild specula-
tions he continued in the steady current of his ordinary life.
About this time he leased a large part of his farm to Mr.
Abraham Lincoln, of Adelaide, who was in possession of the
same as tenant for many years. In 1857 he lost by dysentery,
then very prevalent in the colony, his eldest son Hector, at
the age of 19 years, a most promising and highly intelligent
youth.
In the year 1859 he left Melbourne with the whole of his
family by the mail steamer “Oneida” for Britain, by the
overland route through Egypt, visiting on the way various
other places of interest, including Malta, Naples, Genoa,
Marseilles, Lyons, and Paris. On bis arrival in Britain he
proceeded to Scotland, after a short stay in the neighborhood
of London, and settled for a little time in Edinburgh, where
he sent his children to school. He spent one winter at home,
and in the following summer visited the Highlands of Scot-
land and other places of interest, returning by the “Blue
Jacket” clipper ship to Australia in the latter part of 1860
along with his family, excepting his eldest son, who remained
behind in Edinburgh to finish his education at the High
School and University.
Mr. Napier was made a Justice of the Peace in 1860, and
continued to fill that position with credit to within a few
months of his decease. He also took considerable interest in
the management of the local School Board—of which he was
the honorary correspondent—before the present Education
Act came into force, and had the honor of laying the founda-
tion stone of the present State School at Essendon.
Mr. Napier enjoyed good health throughout the whole
period of his life; and his death, which occurred on the 7th
February, 1881, was entirely due to natural causes, apart
from any constitutional disease. He enjoyed the full use of
his mental faculties to the very last. As a man he exhibited
most of the valuable traits of the Scottish character, and in
private life was much esteemed by those who knew him best.
He left a widow and two of a family, his son being the present
Mr. T. Napier, of “ Magdala,” Essendon, and his daughter
Mrs. G. P. Barber, of Warrnambool.
ROBERT REAPER PUDNEY, M.R.A.C.,
F.H.A.S.,
Op Cashel, was born at Earlscolne, Essex, England, in 1856,
and comes from an ancient family of landowners in that
eastern county. His early education was received at “ The
Friends’ School,” at Ackworth, in Yorkshire, after which he
studied at the Royal Agricultural College, taking his
diploma and gold medal as a Professor of Agriculture.
He also took a diploma of the Highland Agricultural Society of
Scotland, and the certificate of the Royal Agricultural So-
ciety of England in the same year. In 1885 Professor Pudney
left England for New Zealand, on a tour of inspection, thence

to Tasmania, where he spent three months, and arrived in
\ietoria in July 1886, receiving the appointment of Principal
and Professor of the Agricultural Sciences, at the first Vic-
torian School of Agriculture, in connection with the Dookie
Experimental Farm, a position he still holds. This institu-
tution at present represents the Agricultural College of the
colony. There are forty students, and as many more will en-
rol when there is sufficient accommodation for them. The
fees are fixed at the low figure of £25 to encourage farmers to
send their sons, and this without loss, inasmuch as Parlia-
ment has munificently endowed the Council of Agricultural
Education, for the time being, with a land grant of 150,000
acres. Under Professor Pudney, students may be assured of
having the science of practical agriculture imparted to them
in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.
MARK YOUNG’S PIER HOTEL,
FRANKSTON.
This hotel, which is owned and has been occupied by Mr.
Mark Young for the past twelve years, contains a large num-
ber of lofty and well-ventilated bed and sitting rooms, many
of which open upon a spacious balcony, running nearly
around the house, so that in the hottest weather a cool spot
can always be found. The large billiard room is excellently
ventilated and lighted with gas. Baths of fresh and salt
water have been provided, and also a snug lawn tennis court
for visitors. Good horses and traps can always be secured
for making coast excursions and trips into the country.
Boating and fishing on the Bay, or in the Kanauook Creek
(now snagged and cleaned), which runs along the hotel
garden, afford amusement to all lovers of air aquatic. The
beach is reached from the garden by a suspension bridge, the
distance being only two minutes’ walk. The situation of
Frankston, as a summer resort, is admirable, being only 26£
miles by rail from Melbourne ; eight trains running daily; the
morning train landing gentlemen in this city in ample time
for business. The old coach road to the city runs close to
and parallel with the Bay, furnishing a delightful drive. Good
roads also run from Frankston to Mornington and Dromana,
along the Bay to Hastings and Flinders on Western Port Bay,
also to Cranbourne and Dandenong.
From the Mornington or Hastings roads many vistas of
great beauty are to be met with. At the beach is a very long
and wide jetty, which is utilised as a promenade. To the
north stretches the far-famed nine-mile beach of clear, white
sand, skirted by a dense growth of the sheltering ti-ti
tree. To the south begins the rugged rocky beach and steep
cliffs, broken here and there by deep ravines and fern-tree
gullies. To the south-east the country is hilly and un-
dulating, and in some places rocky and romantic.
Mr. Young came to Victoria in the “ David G. Fleming,” of
the Mersey line, sailing from Liverpool and landing at
Sandridge on November 27, 1857. He proceeded to Ballarat,
and followed, for some time, various pursuits. In 1859,
when the Geelong and Ballarat railway was being con-
structed, he, in conjunction with his brother James, carried
on storekeeping until 1861, when he proceeded to the rush
at Otago, N.Z., where he also kept stores at Watihunt
and another place. In 1862 he disposed of his business, and
returned to Ballarat, where he was employed by Claxton and
Dalton, with whom he remained until 1863, when he married
and began business as hotelkeeper in the White Hart Hotel,
Sturt-street, Ballarat. The venture was a success, and Mr.
Young soon took an active part in all matters relating to the
district, including the hospital and benevolent institutions,
being Vice-President of both, and also a life-governor,
when he left Ballarat. He was a member of the
Ballarat West volunteer fire brigade, of which he was hose
officer for many years. On leaving for Melbourne he was
made an honorary life member. In 1868, in conjunction
with some warm-hearted Irishmen, he assisted in establishing
the “ Ballarat Hibernian Benefit Society,” of which he was
first Chairman, first President, and first Chief President.
The society prospered, and branches were soon established
in all the colonies, including New Zealand. In February,
1869, the society presented Mr. Young with a beautifully
illuminated address. For the purpose of making the benefits
of the society more general he, with others, labored to bring
about the amalgamation of the Hibernian with the Australian
Catholic Benefit Society. After much hard work the union
was completed under the present name, “ The Hibernian Aus-
tralian Catholic Benefit Society.” Mr. Young was elected first
Chief President of the new society. In 1871 he was presented
with the cross of the society for meritorious services rendered,
the presentation taking place on St. Patrick’s Day of that
year, on the Western Cricket Ground, Ballarat, by the Eev. Dr.
Moor, in the presence of a large number of the society, and
several members of Parliament. In 1879 Mr. Young sold out
the White Hart, and purchased the business of the Unicorn
Hotel, Sturt-street, paying an annual rental of £1,456.
Daring the great mining depression in Ballarat in 1879, he
got his lease cancelled, sold off, and removed to Melbourne,
where he had previously bought the business of the old
Hummum’s Hotel, Bourke-street east, to which he gave the
name of The Unicorn, and established a good business, but
owing to the failing health of Mrs. Young he disposed of his
business in 1872, and went to live on a selection previously
held on Carrum Swamp, upon which he had built a comfort-
able residence. The following year he was elected a member
of the Dandenong Shire Council, of which he was President
the two following years, at the end of which, on going to
Frankston, he became a member of the Shire of Mornington,
of which he remained a member for six years. In 1876 he
was elected a member of the Board of Advice for the Morning-
ton School District. He has always been a warm supporter
of the principles of the Educational Act. In 1880, he con-
tested Mornington as a candidate for a seat in the Legislative
Assembly as an Independent Liberal, but was defeated by Mr.
Gibb.
OMEO.
From facts furnished by Mr. Thomas Fasten,
The Omeo Distkict, now comprised within the Shire, is
situated on both slopes of the Great Dividing Eange, which,
running irregularly from south-west and north-east, bisects
the territory unequally. Its central latitude is about 37 deg.,
its longitude deg. East.


The altitude of the lower valleys, as that of the Tarabo
River, varies between 800 and 1500 feet, while the ranges are
of all elevations up to the highest point in Victoria—Mount
Bogong, 0500 feet. Its geological structure includes all for-
mations from azoic, silurian, Devonian, to tertiary drifts, ex-
cepting perhaps carboniferous.
The earliest settlement was certainly prior to that of Gipps-
land, and appears to have been about 1839 or 1810, when Dr.
Duncan McFarlane obtained a pastoral license for the Omeo |
Plains run, he with a party having explored as far as Mount
Leinster previously, when, having camped early in the after- j
noon, he ascended the prominent peak now known as Mount
McFarlane, from which he could see over the greater part of
the Omeo Plains.
Soon after he was settled at Omeo Station, another party
of explorers, consisting of Mr. Matthew McAllister, Dr. Ar-
buckle and a party of men, started from Maneroo ; following t
the track of their predecessors, and possibly guided by the [
narrations of the blacks, they crossed the Dividing Range at )
Tongio Gap, and explored the very difficult country abutting |
on the Tambo River, which river they appear to have followed
down to some distance below where Bruthen is now situated.
They discovered and named the Nicholson, Mitchell and Avon
Rivers, which they appear to have otherwise named, the
Tambo being sometimes called the Thomson, the Mitchell the
McAllister, and the Avon the Dunlop.
Pastoral settlement followed closely on these explorers,
whose labours were also being supplemented by the discoveries
of some pioneers who came to Port Albert and examined the
country north therefrom.
Still, Omeo was very little known until gold was reported to
have been discovered on the Livingstone Creek about 1854,
when a great number of miners attempted the journey by way
of Port Albert, others by following the Mitta Mitta River up
from the Ovens diggings, and some few by way of Maneroo,
either way being extremely rough and mountainous, with
great danger if the rivers should be in flood. Of course many
of these men had only acquired their knowledge of mining
from their experience on what was then called the lower digg-
ings, and it was only those who had had experience in Cali,
foruia who succeeded, or at least were in partnership with
those who had, and who understood the process of sluicing, by
which all the alluvial claims within the district had been
worked.
Those who remained, numbering perhaps from 100 to 200,
had to form a community apart from the others, from 1854 to
1858, when Mr, A. C. Mills, the first warden, arrived, and
the camp of police was formed.
It appeared that their arrival was not any too early, as near
the end of that year the most brutal murder known was com-
mitted on Mr. Cornelius Greene, a commission agent. It is
satisfactory to record that the murderers were tracked by one
of the last surviving Omeo blacks, who led a party consisting
of Mr. Inspector (now Superintendent) Hill, the same Matthew
McAllister spoken of herein, Mr. Wm. Gibbs (now residing on
the Buchan-road), and Constables Reed and White, and cap-
tured them on Wheeler’s Creek, a tributary of the Murray
River, alter whicn they paid the last penalty of the law.
The alluvial ground was being worked, and much of it aban-
doned, until 1873, when the territory, having been included
within the Shire of Rairnsßale, was severed therefrom and con-
stituted the Shire of Omeo.
Soon after, numbers of selectors took up their holdings,
commencing on Omeo Plains, so that in two or three years
every available acre was appropriated. They were met by
some very sad condolences on the part of the old squatters
and their employds, who assured them that no crops could
ever be grown, the climate being too severe, and that some-
times there would be no grass for years. They, however, were
not daunted by these assurances, and meeting the circum-
stances manfully, are this day in a comparative state of af-
fluence, crops up to 60 bushels of wheat and 80 bushels of oats
having been grown in an acre.
The roads at this time were almost impossible to travel with
wheeled vehicles, the hills being so steep, and there was little
money to expend on them, the whole revenue of the Shire
being about £l2OO to £l6OO ; yet, by careful economy on the
part of the Engineer, Mr. Easton, a road between Omeo town
and Omeo Plains, a distance of seven miles, has now been
constructed, on which 8 tons of wheat have been conveyed in a
waggon. The revenue of the same Shire has now increased
to £BOOO.
The area of the Shire is 2200 square miles, the population
being 2500, the number on the voter’s roll is 450, rateable
property assessment valuation £25,000. The district was
proclaimed a Shire in 1873, the first year’s revenue being £BOO,
last year’s £BOOO. Mr. Thomas Easton has been the Shire
Secretary since its formation.
THE PREMIER PERMANENT BUILDING
ASSOCIATION AND DEPOSIT BANK.
The handsome structure adjoining the Age office in Collins-
street east, designed by Mr. Charles D’Ebro for the Premier
Permanent Building Association, is well worthy a description
in the pages of a work which deals with the progress and
development of the Victorian commercial institutions.
The front of the building, designed in the French Renaissance
style and built of freestone from the Grampian Mountain quar-
ries, near Stawell, is of superb beauty. The building is five
storied, the last story being surmounted by a mansard roof
finished with elaborately contrived iron cresting and ornamen-
tation. The faqade reaches to a height of 88 feet from pave-
ment to parapet, and towers majestically above its neighbours.
From the pavement to the first floor the beauty of the facade
is enhanced by polished grey granite pilasters, while the
windows are adorned witu red polished granite columns. The
central entrance bay forms of itself a striking feature.
Entering the building, the ground door of which is devoted
principally to tiie use of tne Building Association, the pave-
ment formed of beautifully-designed tesselated tiles, manu-
factured in the colony, attracts observation. On the left are
situated the banking offices, where the branches of the
business connected with tiie Savings Baux, deposits, and
dividends are carried on, tne Accountant’s room, the Board

and the Secretary’s room; while facing the entrance at the
end of the long central corridor is the large office in which the j
building society business exclusively is transacted. The
furniture throughout these various occupied chambers is of
exquisite workmanship and design. The counters and screens
in the savings bank chamber are particularly noticeable, the
panels being made of polished cedar, Huon pine, and
blackwood. Portions of the Huon pine very much resemble
a rich maple. The furniture of the board room is also of a
handsome and elaborate character, and entirely of colonial
manufacture.
It might here be mentioned that Mr. Mirams, true to his
protectionist principles, has, throughout the entire building,
consistently employed colonial workmanship and colonial
materials. Under the ground floor lies one of the best
divided cellars in Melbourne, lofty, roomy, well ventilated,
and lighted with Hayward’s patent prismatic lights. The gas
engine which works the lift is placed at the foot of the stairs
leading into the cellar. The lift is an American Otis hydraulic
elevator, now in general use throughout the United States,
and is the first of its kind erected in Australia. For safety,
facility in working and economy, it is unsurpassable, possess-
ing innumerable advantages over lifts in ordinary use, es-
pecially in the particular that it uses the same water con-
tinuously from a large cistern underneath the machinery.
The elevator runs in the well of the staircase, and is pro-
tected throughout by strong wh e netting. The car is light
and elegant, and on reaching a landing stops of itself, owing
to the hydraulic power being then exhausted by a patent
process.
The first floor consists of twelve conveniently-arranged
offices, each of which averages in size 15 feet x 12 feet. Each
of these is fitted with a gas stove placed in the wall and with
elegant gas brackets. The second and third floors are similar
to the first, with the exception that at the south end of both
the two former are placed lavatories and all other requisites
for the comfort and convenience of the office holders. The
corridors throughout are wide and airy, and each flat is fitted
with a strong room. On reaching the fourth floor, the care-
taker’s quarters and a luncheon room for the employes are
noticeable on the right, and on the left a large chamber front-
ing Collins-street. At least thirty-six completely-arranged
offices in this new building are placed at the disposal of the
public at most reasonable rentals.
Having briefly sketched the building, we will now give a
resume of the operations of the Society from the date of its
establishment in 1874 by its present able Secretary, Mr-
James Mirams. Glancing at the public reports and balance-
sheets, we find that in 1874 the Society enjoyed a patronage
from which an income of something under £IO,OOO was
derived. This in itself spoke volumes for the energy and
ability of the guiding mind. Confidence was so far established
in the Institution that during the first decade, notwithstand-
ing the disquietude of the public mind in regard to city and
■ suburban properties, owing to the adversity into which the
colony was plunged through political changes and political
warfare, the income of the Society kept steadily increasing,
and, in 1883, rose to the sum of £54,894. From this date a
tide of prosperity for the Association set in, and no better
exemplification of this could be given than the following
figures in regard to its income: in 1881, £86,305; in 1885,
£200,103; in 1886, £451,085; during the six months ending
March, 1887, the income totted up to £308,000, or at the rate
of £620,000 per annum. As a proof of the exceptional position
of the Society’s finances, it might be mentioned that the
subscribed capital stands at £420,000, and the paid-up capital
at £185,000, and this is being added to every fortnight. The
fixed £5 shares, of which 27,000 have been issued, are now
at a premium of £1 per share. That the pre-eminent posi-
tion of this financial institution is mainly if not solely due
to the ability, management, and energy of its Secretary, is
undeniable, and, in recognition of this fact, the success he has
achieved in other walks of life, and the general favor and
esteem he is held in, we have, in our Australian Representa-
tive Men, inserted a biography of Mr. Mirams, together with a
chromo-lithograph of his portrait.
MESSRS. PATERSON, LAING & BRUCE.
} Not a man of practical experience will gainsay the fact
that the gigantic strides made by Melbourne during its short
| existence are thoroughly marvellous. In dealing with the
I almost incredible growth of commerce in the Queen City of the
I South, one is liable while depicting the truth to be twitted
I with an extravagance of language, or an abnormal develop-
j ment of the faculty of imagination; yet, a true descriptive
j narrative of the success of some of the merchants of Mel-
j bourne, could not possibly be read by those unacquainted with
] the vitality of the colony without the writer of such an article
I being accounted mendacious. Cities that have been in exis-
j tence for centuries, and which have a history, and whose
wealth has been amassed gradually, may be written of in a
[ fulsome style without any such imputation; but in writing of
I a city of “ mushroom growth,” and such a one as Melbourne,
one has a hesitancy in being branded an Ananias. Wishing
j to convey to the world at large a faithful picture of the capital
of Victoria, with its palatial residences, its gigantic ware-
houses, its magnificent public buildings, its wealth of re-
sources, and its almost illimitable enterprise, we cannot do
; better than faithfully reproduce in lithograph a few of the
{ banks, warehouses, private residences, &c., with which the city
jof Melbourne abounds. Very nearly all who have embarked
| in this city in commerce or trade have done so with success
| and it is a matter worthy of consideration that this success
[ does not belong as in the old world to only a certain class of
j individuals or cities, but to everyone in any town or city in the
colonies who brings to bear a certain amount of energy.
Whatever the cause may be, whether that the business man
on arriving on these shores casts off the trammels of English
prejudice, or that the new country possesses wider and newer
fields for enterprise, it is quite certain that he whose vision
would have ranged no further at home than mediocrity, no
sooner does he arrive and commence business here, aspires to
something better, and soon attains the goal of his desires.
Amongst the soft-goods merchants the firm whose building,
graces this volume might proudly be mentioned as one which
commencing comparatively poorly, now leads the way in Mel-


bourne, where such palatial warehouses rear their heads, and
whose merchants may justly be termed princes, so far at least
as opulence is concerned.
In 1850, Mr. J. C. Young commenced business in Geelong
with a stock of £3OOO, and a staff of four assistants. Some
twelve months after, the business received a sudden check
through the discovery of gold in New South Wales, and the
consequent depopulation of Geelong. This reverse, however,
was somewhat counterbalanced in 1852 by the discovery of
gold at Ballarat, and a tide of prosperity set in. Quick to
avail himself of the opportunity, Mr. Young, securing the
services of Mr. Paterson, opened a branch in Ballarat, which
flourished successfully under Mr. Paterson’s management.
The business steadily increased until in 1854 it became
imperative for Mr. Young to consider the advisability of
erecting a suitable warehouse. With him, for the necessity
of a certain coarse to be pursued to arise was simply the
prelude to that course being pursued. A new warehouse
being erected, Mr. Palmer was taken into employ as book-
keeper. A short season of depression followed, prior to which
Mr. Yhung had gone on a visit to England. On his return he
came to the conclusion that the business should be moved to
Melbourne, and, acting on his opinion, on the first favourable
opportunity he carried his intention into practice. Mr.
Paterson was now taken into partnership, and business was
commenced at the corner of Flinders-lane and Bussell-street
under the style of J. C. Young and Co., in the year 1856, when
the value of the stock was estimated at £25,000. There were
then about sixteen assistants employed. The business from
its very inception was healthy, and two years subsequently
Mr. Palmer was admitted into partnership. In 1860, Mr.
Young retired, leaving the business to be carried on by Messrs.
Paterson and Palmer. Simultaneously with the retirement of
Mr. Young, the purchase of the business of Bay, Glaister and
Co. was effected. On the admission of Mr. Briscoe Bay as a
partner, the two businesses were amalgamated, under the
style of Paterson, Bay, Palmer and Co., and moved from
Bussell-street to Flinders-lane West, opposite Messrs. Gibbs,
Bright and Co. Mr. J. E. Bailey then became associated with
the firm, and was subsequently taken into partnership. A
crisis for a move to meet the growing requirements of the
business arose now, and a decisive step was taken, the result
being the handsome structure shown. Considerable regret
was caused by the premature and unexpected death of Mr.
Bailey prior to the completion of the buildings, more
especially as he had taken a most active part in its construc-
tion. From this date the history of the firm was purely one
of daily increasing success until 1876, when Mr. Paterson
bought up the interests of his other partners. He was then
joined by Mr. Laing, who had some time prior retired from
the firm of Laing and Webster, and eventually by Mr. John M.
Bruce, who was a resident partner for years in George Webster
and Co.’s business. The firm, now styled that of Paterson,
Laing and Bruce, kept growing apace daily, and soon an
extension of premises was made necessary, and this was
effected by the addition of another storey.
The basement of the building, which measures 110 feet by
100 feet, is used as a receiving and despatching room for bulk
packages. Adjoining this is the entering room, which is di-
vided into three compartments, namely, town, suburban and
country, and intercolonial. The rest of the basement is stored
with Manchester goods. On the ground floor are woollens,
clothing, hats, caps, Ac. The first floor is devoted to the
storage of shirts, ties, gloves, hosiery and also Bradford
manufactured goods, French merinoes, silks and silk mixed
goods of every description, as well as ribbons of every hue and
description. On the second floor are placed French and
English millinery, gloves, feathers, plumes, hats and other
requisites for ladies, the third floor being used partly as a
package floor for bulk and bonded goods for package trade,
and here a Customs officer is continually in attendance.
The building runs through from Flinders Lane to within a
hundred feet of Collins-street, and covers an area of half an
acre. The firm has a branch in London at 7 and 8 Australian
Avenue, where all purchases are made, and from which all
goods are shipped by the firm to Australia,
“ ENDERBY.”
The Residence of William John Mountain, Esq.
Harry B. Gibbs, Esq., Architect,
That enterprise and foresight have been the chief factors in
the achievement of position and affluence in regard to many
old colonists, is an irrefutable fact, and in verification of this
one has only to view the handsome structure, entitled “ En-
derby,” the residence of Mr. W. J. Mountain, J.P.
The name “ Enderby” will recall that beautiful poem
written by Jean Ingelow, commencing with
“ The old mayor climbed the belfry tower,
The ringers rang by twos, by threes,
‘ Pull, if ye never pulled before,
Good ringers, pull your best,’ quoth he.
1 Play up, play up, O 1 Boston bells,
Play all your changes, all your swells,
Play up the Brides of Enderby.’ ”
“ Enderby,” an illustration of which we publish in this
volume, is the palatial residence of Wm. J. Mountain, Esq.
It is situated in Queen’s Terrace, South Melbourne, and was
erected in 1885 from designs prepared by Mr. Harry B. Gibbs,
architect, of 43 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, who also superin-
tended its construction. The external appearance of “ En-
derby” is neat yet bold, being without lavish ornamentation,
careful attention having been paid to stability, with large and
lofty rooms. The Loggia, with its garden terraced, forms an
imposing approach to the main entrance hall, which is laid
in encaustic tiles, with a marble slab adorned with crest and
motto. The entrance doorway is embellished with stained
and hand-painted glass, the designs being from Australian
subjects. The drawing-room is handsomely finished, with
niches in each angle. The breakfast and dining rooms may
be thrown into one by means of a sliding door, which dis-
appears, leaving a handsome archway, and forming a room
42 feet in length. The billiard room, off the staircase hall,
is large and lofty, with a side door leading into the beautiful
conservatory, with a fountain playing in the centre. The
main staircase of three flights rises from a spacious hall of
30 feet in length, with an open well to the tower. This may
be considered the most striking feature of the house. The
kitchen buildings and appurtances are complete. The upper

(NORTH (VIIF^BOO.




floor is devoted to bed-rooms, with a wide balcony on the
south and west sides. A staircase rises from this floor to the
tower, which is surrounded b$ a promenade platform capable
of carrying 30 persons. The tower view commands the Bay,
Albert Park Lake, the City, and Rotten Row.
The site comprises one-and-a-half acres, and from its
proximity to the city, and yet being retired, forms one of the
most desirable homes in Melbourne.
Among other buildings which have been erected under Mr.
Gibbs’ care may be mentioned “ The George” Hotel, situated
at the corner of Fitzroy and Grey streets, and immediately
opposite the St. Kilda Railway Station, one of the largest
and most handsome family hotels in the colonies, which will
contain, when complete with every modern convenience, about
160 rooms.
The Bairnsdale District Hospital is also another instance of
Mr. Gibbs’ skill, he having carried off first and second prizes,
with a field of 32 competitors. This building was opened at
the close of last year, and is a great credit to this rising dis-
trict and the architect.
Having given a description of the building, a few words in
connection with the career of the owner would not be in-
appropriate. William John Mountain was born in Woolwich.
England, in 1836. The death of his father occurring when
he was a mere lad, Mr. Mountain followed the bent of his in-
clination, and enlisted into a Royal Engineer Corps. The
realities and hardships of a life not by any means suited to all
temperaments, soon caused him to regret his precipitancy, and
ill-health intensified the dislike which had already set in to
the chosen profession, and then Mr. Mountain applied to his
surviving parent, who, after a deal of trouble, succeeded in
obtaining his discharge. It becoming imperative that he
should remove to a milder climate, Mr. Mountain decided on
emigrating to Adelaide, South Australia. The vessel in
which he embarked for that place had hardly entered the bay
(Glenelg) when rumours of the discovery of gold in Victoria
were wafted on board, and the fever which seized thousands
did not spare him. Electing not to debark, he proceeded to
Melbourne, and reached Port Phillip in January, 1852. With-
out loss of time Mr. Mountain, having first housed his family
at great expense and trouble, joined a party of Cornish miners
and proceeded to Mount Alexander. His struggles there were
of the severest kind. The result was not altogether unsatisfac-
tory as far as getting together a few ounces of gold ; but just
when fortune had smiled on him, one morning he found him-
self in a worse plight than ever, through the treachery of his
“ mates,” who decamped with his hard-earned spoils of six
months. He returned to Melbourne almost penniless, but,
bracing himself, set to work and obtained a small interest in a
lighter named the “ Caroline.” Working manfully for three
years in this vessel, ill-health necessitated his relinquishing
a very profitable occupation and accepting the management of
Mr. H. H. Lohman’s business. On the departure of Mr. Leh-
man for New Zealand, and on the receipt of glowing accounts
regarding the richness of the Ballarat diggings, Mr. Moun-
tain once more endeavoured to attain competence on a gold-
field, but his second attempt was not more successful than his
first, and after a fight against fate for eighteen months, he once
more returned to Melbourne, and with that energy so character-
istic of him, applied himself to hard work as a wharf clerk in
the employ of Mr. C. L. Throckmorton. His diligence, per-
severance, and trustworthiness raised h ; m step by step to the
management of Mr. Throckmorton’s business. On the
retirement of Mr. Tbrockmorto.n, Mr. Mountain, in con-
junction with Mr. Gibbs, purchased the timber business, which
is now known as that of Gibbs and Mountain, on the Yarra
bank. On the present yard the firm has expended no less a
sum than £14,000 in reclaiming, filling, roadmaking, &c.
At the Emerald Hill municipal election in 1875, Mr. Moun-
tain secured a seat in the Town Council, and took a promi-
nent part in every movement, and notably in that of grouping
together in one imposing pile of buildings the Town Hall,
Post Office, Police Court, and Mechanics’ Institute. He also
countenanced and actively assisted in the floating of the
£130,000 loan by that Council. On his retirement by efflux-
ion of time he was re-elected, and in 1880-81 unanimously
chosen Mayor. It is a matter of fact that he is still remem-
bered as one of the most popular mayors of Emerald Hill,
now known as South Melbourne. On his vacating the chair
he expressed his desire of retiring from public life, but public
pressure being brought to bear, he was compelled to stand
once more, with the result of being triumphantly returned by
2236 votes. In March, 1883, he was nominated to the Mel-
bourne Harbor Trust Board by the Council, and in 1886 when
the power of nomination was transferred from the Council to
the ratepayers, he was re-elected by the people. He was
created a justice of the peace in 1882, and also a trustee of
the Albert Park.
WURROOK.
The owner of Wurrook is Mr. Thomas Russell, who was
born at Kincraig, in Fifeshire, in 1828, and came to
Victoria in 1850. Shortly after his arrival he purchased,
in conjunction with some relatives, the station known
as Long Water Holes, situated between Innsleigh and
Cressy, in the Western district, from Mr. James Austin,
the orignal holder. This property, which is now freehold,
consists of upwards of 50,000 acres, and Mr. Russell, until
lately, continued to hold a share in it. The wool from Bare-
mah Plains (the present title of the property) has always com-
manded a high price in the London market, and the breed of
sheep kept is highly esteemed throughout Australia. After
seven years spent on the plains, Mr. Russell found himself in
a position to purchase from Mr. Campton Ferrers an adjoin-
ing station, called the Ponds, and on this property he has
built the moderate sized mansion of Wurrook, at the edge of
the timber country. The house is charmingly situated, and
bears the name of the parish in which most of the purchased
land lies. The sheep on Wurrook are favorably known for
the fineness of their wool, and on one occasion a considerable
number of bales from this station averaged, in the grease, as
high as Is. lid. per lb., a figure seldom if ever reached by
any o ( her flock. Mr. Russell was twice returned to Parlia-
ment for North Grenville, and discharged his duties with
zeal and fidelity. Soon after reaching the colony Mr. Rus-
sell was made a magistrate, and adjudicated upon both the
Shelford and Rokewood benches. He was the first President of


the Shire of Leigh. Mr. Russell married Anna Louisa,
daughter of Charles Parsons, Esq., of Bloomfield, Tasmania,
and niece of Cecil Parsons, Esq., of Presteign—a deputy-
lieutenant of Herefordshire. Mr. Russell made a prolonged
visit to England for the education of his children, and while
there became possessed of an estate in Sussex, called Harr-
mere Hall. He is a member of both the Melbourne and Aus-
tralian Clubs here, and of the Reform Club, London, being
also a Fellow of the Colonial Institute and of the Royal Geo-
graphical Society of England.
HENRY MORRIS JONES & CO.
Mr. H. Morris Jones was born in London. He is the eldest
son of Henry James Jones, the well-known contractor, who
came to this colony in 1852. Mr. H. Morris Jones received
his education in Prahran, and commenced life in the drapery
business, at which he remained for nine years. He then en-
gaged with the firm of W. H. Rocke and Co., Collins-street,
and remained in their employ for sixteen years, becoming
manager of one of their branches, and acquiring a thorough
knowledge of the furniture and house-furnishing business
in every department. Mr. Jones next commenced business
with Messrs. Cullis Hill and Greig (as Cullis Hill and Co.),
this arrangement lasting for about five years. Fortified with
experience, and possessing sufficient capital, he opened a fine
establishment on his own account at the corner of Chapel and
High streets, Prahran. His success was instantaneous.
Business rapidly increased in consequence of the variety of his
stock, and the knowledge that he could be thoroughly relied
upon in all matters of taste in furnishing a house. He has
been compelled to secure the adjoining frontage, to make room
for additional stock, and at present his establishment is sup-
plied with all the requisites required by the housewife. Orders are
carefully executed, and the public can rely upon honest dealing,
which is the highest compliment that can be paid. Mr. Jones
is a member of the Wesleyan Church, and has held all the
positions which fall to laymen in that society. He takes a deep
interest in local and political matters, and in all movements
which contribute to the social, moral, and intellectual advance-
ment of his fellow citizens. In 1876 Mr. Jones married the
eldest daughter of Mr. H. Denhan, builder, Melbourne. The
family consists of two children. We publish a fine illustra-
tion of Mr. Jones’ place of business in this volume.
FRANK NEWMAN.
Mr. Newman in 1883 established at 183 Brunswick-street,
Fitzroy, a Fancy Repository, which includes all the lines kept
by the Melbourne shops, and such was his success that he
subsequently added a new department, namely, artists’
materials of all descriptions, including the requisites for oil
and water colour painting. The greatest care is exercised in
selecting the goods, which are invariably from the best
makers. Artists soon discovered that they could rely im-
plicitly upon the judgment of Mr. Newman, while at the same
time his prices were moderate, and, in consequence, his trade
rapidly increased. Mr. Newman keeps a large and varied
assortment of plush and leather goods suitable for presents,
also shell and leather card cases and purses. His prices
compare favourably with those of Melbourne, and all orders
by mail are attended to with the same care which attends a
personal visit. We publish an excellent illustration of the
premises, which will well repay examination.
WILLIAM ELLINGWORTH.
Mr. Ellingworth was born in England, March 20th, 1830,
and arrived in New South Wales with his parents in 1839.
His father was employed for two years by the Colonial Sec-
retary. At the expiration of that time he and Mr.
Wm. Beaver joined in farming in Collon Gully on High-
land Station, situated on the Murrumbidgee River, fourteen
miles from Wagga Wagga. Some seven years after, squatting
became very unprofitable, and the best herds in the district
could be bought at from 20 to 25 shillings per head, including
the run. The station was sold, and Mr. Ellingworth, senior,
removed to Melbourne, establishing a butchering business in
Fitzroy in 1852. On the discovery of gold he arranged with
the subject of this sketch for the business, and then visited
the principal goldfields, but without success. He, in con-
junction with his son, then purchased £lOOO worth of land,
upon which he resided until his death, May 11th, 1886, in the
86th year of his age. In 1857, Mr. Ellingworth disposed of
the business and settled at Box Hill, following the business
of Government contractor, under the Public Works Depart-
ment, cultivating also a portion of the land, and planting an
extensive orchard. His services to the public made him a
member of the Shire Council for 23 years, and for eleven years
President of that body. In 1860, he was appointed by the
Hon. J. G. Francis a J.P. He was also made a Life Governor
of the Melbourne Hospital for services rendered. In 1860
he contested South Bourke for a seat in the Legislative As-
sembly, but owing to outside influences, was defeated by a
small majority. As a member of the United Methodist Church,
with which he has been connected since 1852, he has done
important service, acting at present as district treasurer. He
has also been chairman of the S.B. of Advice for several years.
BENJAMIN MIDDLETON.
Mr. Middleton is a native of Yorkshire, England, and came
to Victoria in 1856. He followed gold mining for years at
Dunolly, Ararat, Inglewood and various other places. In 1859,
he went to New South Wales and worked on the Lambing Flat
goldfield (now the town of Young). From there he proceeded
to the Lachlan and sunk the second hole on that field. In
1862, he paid New Zealand a visit, working on the principal
fields of the South Island. He returned to Victoria in 1861,
and mined on Crooked River reefs with fair success. He
then tried his fortune on Gympie Creek, Queensland, and
worked on various fields. He proceeded to Omeo in 1869,
and commenced business as an hotelkeeper in the “ Commer-
cial,” it being the leading hotel of Omeo. He holds invest-
ments in the various mining ventures of that section.

MORDIALLOC COFFEE PALACE.
The Coffee Palace, Mordialloc, was erected in 1887, by Mr -
V. W. Bailey, and immediately filled a long-felt want. The
building is situated opposite the railway station, and occupies j
one of the best sites in Mordialloc, being only half a minute’s
walk from the sea. and yet it is so sheltered that visitors es-
cape the bleakness so much complained of by many who seek
the invigorating atmosphere only to be found on the sea-shore. [
In erecting the building every care and attention was paid to j
the interior arrangements so as to provide a comfortable home
not only for the man of business, but also for families. The
large dining-rooms, sitting-rooms and bed-rooms furnish ample
accommodation, being admirably ventilated. Mordialloc is a
charming retreat for the tired and dusty denizen of the city>
being easy of access, with pure air and all the attractions re-
quired as an Australian summer resort. An especial feature
of the Coffee Palace is the attention which is paid to ladies
and children. For a few days’ or weeks’ outing, we know of
no place near to Melbourne which possesses any advantages
over Mordialloc. The cuisine of the Coffee Palace will be found
all that is desirable. We publish an excellent view of the
structure in this volume.
BLACKWELL AND DALTON,
Architects.
The business was established in 1883 by Mr. E. H. Black-
well, as Architect, House, Land and Insurance Agent, in the
premises shown in our illustration. Within twelve months
the magnitude of the transactions and the number of clients
demanded additional assistance, when Mr. W. A. Dalton
became a member of the firm, which assumed the title of
Blackwell and Dalton. At Hawksburn building operations
were pushed forward with great energy, and most of the
edifices were erected from plans and specifications furnished
by the firm. The success which came to Messrs. Blackwell
and Dalton was undoubtedly due to the fact that they devoted
their personal attention to all work entrusted to their care,
and possessing a thorough knowledge of the business, they
soon won and retained the confidence of their clients. Owing
to the increase in their business, and the superior facilities
offered by the city, in uniting with and consulting those who
were desirous of securing their services, they have secured
offices in the Premier Deposit Bank, 54 Collins-street East,
next door to the Age office, where they can at all times be
consulted.
GEORGE CROKER.
Mr. Croker is a native of Tasmania, and came to Victoria
when a lad with his parents, who settled at Geelong. He
learned the brickmaking trade with his father. About ten
years since he started brickmaking at Bairnsdale, and carried
on the yard for two years. He then went to Omeo in 1879,
being the first man to start and conduct this business in that
place. His output is from 90 to 100 thousand per annum, all of
which meet with a ready sale at £3 per thousand. It is his
intention to commence the manufacture of tiles.
DAVID T. WAY.
Mr. Way was born in England, Nov. 9th, 1889, and reached
this colony in 18.55. He engaged in various businesses for
some years, and accumulated sufficient capital to purchase
two restaurants in Melbourne, one in Bourke and one in
Little Collins streets. He is entitled to the credit of being the
first man to establish in Melbourne a restaurant in which a
working man could procure a meal for sixpence east of the
G.P.O. He carried on the business for about 13 years. In 1871,
he purchased Surrey Hill Estate on the Dandenong Road for
£550. He has taken a prominent part in all local matters,
and has held all the chairs in the A.O. and Court Victoria
No. 230(5, and also the A.0.0.5. His interest in Masonic
work has been constant and zealous.
Much of his time has been devoted to public banquets and
dinners, held on the opening of the principal railways, and
for 23 years he acted as head caterer for Mr. Clements.
HENRY SHARP.
Mr. Sharp is a native of Cumberland, England, and arrived in
Victoria in 1859. For a time he followed the trade of a stone
mason, then proceeded to the Inglewood rush, working as a
miner for 12 months with good success. His next venture in
mining was at Canvas Flat, N.S.W., and from thence he
proceeded to New Zealand, where he worked in Gabriel’s
Gully and other places with excellent results. After six years
spent in that colony, he returned to Victoria, and remained
for three years in Melbourne, holding the position of overseer
of city waterworks. Leaving the city, he spent two years in
the country, and finally reached Sandhurst, where he followed
mining, principally upon the reefs, where he had charge of a
claim. His next venture was at Foster (Stockyard) Creek.
On December 3rd, 1872, he went to Tirton’s Creek, but was
not among the fortunate ones, the gold being found only over
a very limited area. His claim was No. 19. Peter Furnesss
was one of the prospectors of the creek. Leaving Tirton’s,
he was appointed mining manager of the Ophir claim.
From his extensive experience, he was a highly capable man
for the position. The best crushing was from highly
mineralized leaders about eight inches thick. The company
stopped working at the 150 feet level, the stone being from 6
to 8 inches thick and 120 feet wide.
ANDREW McCALLUM.
Mr. McCallum is a native of Geelong. His father, Mr. Wil-
liam McCallum, came to Victoria about 1845, he being one of
the first station owners of that district; the station was
located at Mount Gellibrand. The subject of this memoir
followed farming and the breeding of racehorses, also dealing
in horses in the Geelong district until 1883, at which date
ho went to Gippsland and selected 500 acres on the Tambo
River fiats, near Ensay. After a residence of two years on
the selection he leased the Little River Inn, which hotel he
now conducts, in connection with farming and grazing pur-
suits. Mr. McCallum is the Postmaster at Ensay.


SUBURBAN RESIDENCE
OF
J. BARTLETT DAVIES, ESQ.
On an adjoining page we present onr readers with a view of
the suburban residence of J. B. Davies, Esq. The situation
at Mentone is one of the most charming in Victoria.
Mentone promises to become, at an early day, the fashion-
able watering place of the colony, its rise and progress being,
in a great measure, due to the untiring energy of Mr. Davies,
who, as the founder of the Freehold Investment and Banking
Co., Limited, has established the reputation of being one of
the most successful financiers in Melbourne.
ROBERT SUTTON
Was born in England Aug. 25th, 1827, and arrived in the
colony in January, 1857. Asa blacksmith he obtained im-
mediate employment, but in four months proceeded to Nuna-
wading, and established a general smith’s shop and wheel-
wright’s business, which he carried on with success for about
26 years. He has been a member of the Eoad Board for
several years ; also a councillor for the Shire for many years,
and Chairman of the Board of Advice. Taking a prominent
part in Church matters, he has long been an active worker in
the Wesli yan Church, and a zealous advocate of the temperance
cause, being ®ne of the founders of the 1.0. E. Tent No. 130.
He is secretary and treasurer of the Cemetery, and for special
services has been made a Life Governor of the Melbourne
Hospital. In 1876 he purchased 60 acres of land at Box Hill
at £l5 per acre, and 28 acres at £ll 55., which he sold in 1883
at £l5 per acre. In 1833, he secured the Mona Vale Estate,
most of which he has sold at a handsome advance. His
family consists of four sons and three daughters. The eldest son
conducts the original business. Another son is a State-school
teacher, while another is teller in the E.S. and A.C. Bank,
Kew.
THOMAS BILLING.
Mb. Billing was born in Cornwall, England, June 23,1833,
and arrived in this colony October 12, 1848, with his parents.
His father followed various occupations, and entered into
partnership and established a business in Collingwood. He
subsequently visited the goldfields at Forest Creek and other
places, and led the life of a digger for about 12 months.
Subsequently he purchased land in Collingwood. In
1854 he purchased 7J acres of land at Boroondara,
for which he paid £4O per acre. He cultivated this land as
a market garden. He also built cottages on the Collingwood
property, which he rented. His death occurred September
29, 1859, at the age of 57. During his life Thomas remained
with his father, and, being the only son, he inherited the entire
property, which he cultivated as an orchard, &c., his mother
residing with him. Her death took place June 22, 1869.
Mr. Billing married March 25, 1862. He has for 20 years
been a trustee of the Primitive Methodist Church, and taken
a prominent part in social and progressive matters. In 1880,
he purchased 24 acres of land at Mulgrave, which he also
cultivates as an orchard.
CHARLES LANGHORN.
Mb. Lanohobn is a native of Kent, England, and came to
Victoria in 1874. He at once took a position in the service of
the Bank of Victoria, remaining with that institution for 14
years, in various places in the colony. He proceeded to the
Port Albert branch in 1881. He then opened the branch at
Yarram Yarram, the first branch opened in that township.
He was manager of that branch for upwards of three years.
In February, 1887, he resigned his position and commenced
business as a Heal Estate and General Commission Agent in
the rising of Foster. During Mr. Langhorn’s resi-
dence in Yarram, ho held the position of Secretary to the
Mechanics’ Institute, and he was mainly instrumental in
raising funis for the erection of a suitable building—said
building being the finest institute in South Gippsland. Mr-
Langhorn commenced his present business in April, and his
agencies embrace the following: —Dalgetty & Co., Law,
Somner & Co,, Colonial Mutual, Mutual Live Stock Associa-
tion. He is also agent for the boats running between Mel-
bourne and Corner Inlet, and Inlet and Port Albert. He has
built a substantial wharf and auction room, and is fully alive
to all the best interests of the township.
WILLIAM BARRATT.
Mr. Babratt was born Dec. 2nd, 1818, in Lincoln, England,
and at an early age apprenticed to black and white smithing. He
commenced business on his own account at 18, and arrived in
Melbourne in 1853, where he worked for some time, eventually
proceeding to the goldfields, but abandoned mining, returning
to Melbourne and proceeding to Rush worth. Buying some
tools on credit for £l3, he opened a smith’s shop, in which he
was very successful. Upon several occasions he nearly lost
his life from robbers, being compelled to set trap guns and re-
volvers within his tent for self-protection. He took a contract
for building a punt and public-house at Murchison, and com-
pleted the job in time, although the sawyers were out of ma-
terial within one week. He then started a smith’s shop, built
a store, and continued in business for some years, sold the
business, but bought it back, keeping at the same time the
Post-office. In 1870 he was elected a member of the Shire
Council, and continued a member for five years.
Mr. Barratt at one time in early days was compelled to pay
nine shillings for three turnips, and ate them raw to keep from
starving. Flour sold at Is. fid. per lb., and oats at 13s. per
bushel. He was compelled to give up farming and the store
in consequence of bodily ailments. He became a member of
the Shire Council again in 1837, and discharged his duties
with great credit.
At one time Murchison was infested with garden robbers.
A robber shot himself and broke his leg in the garden. Mr.
Barratt gave him in charge, secured the services of a doctor,
and helped to set his injured limb; yet, in spite of this kind-
ness, Mr. Barratt was charged with having shot the man, and
was committed for trial. He was bailed out, and a hand-
some subscription made by Ins neighbors to defray his ex-
penses. This sum he handed to the Cemetery trustees, pay-
I ing his own costs, and, being honorably acquitted at the trial,
| returned home, vindicated as an honored citizen.

MENTONE. D.WORMAL ARCHITECT




THOMAS ARKLE, J.P.
Born at Bywell, a small village in Northumberland, on the
banks of the Tyne, near Newcastle, in the year 1839, Mr.
Arkle is now in his forty-eighth year. At the age of sixteen
he was apprenticed to the engineering profession, and having
served his stipulated five years, he received his indentures,
without which it would almost be hopeless for a young man
to endeavour to commence his career as a mechanical
engineer. From an early age Mr. Arkle evinced a desire to
become prominent in his profession, and to that end obtained
employment from time to time in some of the leading firms
on the Tyne. After fulfilling an engagement at Sir William
Armstrong’s Els wick Factory, where he occupied the position
of a pattern-maker for some time, Mr. Arkle left for Leeds,
with the avowed object of making himself better acquainted
with engineering works in general, and with locomotive
engineering in particular, as also with flour-mill machinery,
for which Leeds at the time was noted. He remained there
for two years, using the time very profitably. Having gained
a fair knowledge of his business, he next decided to move to
London, where he worked in several of the leading estab-
lishments until 18(36, when his attention was drawn to the
Australian Colonies, and he left London in that year in the
ship “ Netherby,” bound for Brisbane. The vessel, however,
never reached its destination, and Mr. Arkle’s introduction to
Australian soil was anything but pleasant. On the 14th of
July, the “ Netherby” became a total wreck off King’s Island.
The survivors of the wreck encountered numberless hardships,
not the least of which were the want of food and clothes. It
is needless to state that the passengers lost their all. For
fourteen days the wrecked ones remained on the island, eking
out an existence till the Government vessels, the Pharos and
Victoria, went to the rescue, and brought off all hands, landing
them safely in Melbourne on Saturday, July 28th, 1866,
where they were sheltered and cared for in the old Exhibition
buildings. After providing himself with an outfit, Mr. Arkle
commenced work on the following Tuesday in a small
engineer’s shop in Bourke-street. Here he remained for a
few months, eventually obtaining a post in the Government
workshops at Williamstown. Mr. Arkle seems to have been
fond of travelling, for no sooner had he become thoroughly
acquainted with the nature of the work required of him at
the workshops than he became possessed of an inclination to
explore the interior of Victoria, and accordingly started for
Ballarat, where he undertook the erection of machines. From
Ballarat, he visited Ararat and the Creswick district, and
after spending three years in those districts, he returned to
the Government workshops in Williamstown, and worked as a
fitter there until June, 1874, when he entered into partnership
with the well-known Mr. J. B. Crews, auctioneer, &c., and a
resident of Prahran. A very fair business, under the style of
Crews and Arkle, was carried on both at Prahran and Mel-
bourne, and the partnership continued until about two years
ago, when Mr. Crews retired. Taking a profound interest in
the city that he was residing in (Prahran), Mr. Arkle offered
himself to the ratepayers on two occasions, but was beaten,
and it was not until October, 1877, that an extraordinary
vacancy having occurred, he was elected to the City Council.
Since then he has been returned on three occasions, securing
over two thousand votes at the last election. During 1879-80,
he filled the position of Mayor very satisfactorily, and
still retains his seat as Councillor. Mr. Arkle is the Prahran
representative on the Melbourne Tramways Trust, having
been unanimously voted to the position. At the general elec-
tion of 1880 he contested the constituency of Williamstown
with Mr. A. T. Clark, but failed to score a win. Mr. Arkle
has also been a member of the Prahran School Board of
Advice, and has devoted much time and trouble in scrupulously
performing all his duties.
WILLIAM DAVISON.
Mr. Davison was born at Hexham, Northumberland, England,
June 20th, 1838, being the youngest son of Mr. Thomas
Davison, builder, of that town. At an early age Mr. Davison
served his apprenticeship as a stone mason. When a boy he
worked on the High Line Bridge and Railway Station, New-
castle-upon-Tyne, and also upon several extensive works in
the County and City of Durham. At the age of 16 he re-
ceived full wages, and determined to try his fortune in Aus-
tralia. Hs landed at Moreton Bay prior to the separation
from New South Wales. In 1857, he joined his two bi others
in Melbourne, and followed his calling as a stone mason,
eventually becoming managing foreman for several leading
contractors. The erection of the Swan-street bridge, con-
necting Hawthorn with Richmond, was entrusted to his super-
vision by Messrs. J. C. Johnson and Co., of the Tyne Foundry,
who obtained the contract from the Richmond City Council.
Mr. Davison carried out this work with such skill and ability,
that it is regarded as one of the most complete and safely con-
structed bridges in the colony. At the conclusion of this en-
gagement he began business on his own account as a con-
tractor. In his younger days he was in sympathy with
Liberal principles, and naturally became a supporter of the
party led by Mr. Graham Berry, Mr. Wilson Gray, and others.
Deeply interested in municipal matters, he offered himself as
a candidate for the position of Councillor for Richmond,
North Ward. He was opposed by Mr. T. J. Forbes, an un-
successful candidate for municipal honors only two months
previous, in the year 1885, and defeated by 21 votes. In
August, 1886, he again presented himself, and was elected by
a large majority over his opponent, Mr. Hansen. After hold-
ing his seat for one year only, he was unanimously chosen as
Mayor of the City of Richmond by his brother councillors.
Mr. Davison owed this mark of esteem and approval to his
thorough business habits and practical knowledge of the re-
quirements of the city, combined with honesty and integrity
of purpose. At one time Mr. Davison was engaged in exten-
sive mining speculations, at first successfully, but finally he
lost several thousand pounds, and was compelled to star*
business again, not a rich, but a wiser man, devoting his ener-
gies exclusively to his original business. He is at present en-
gaged in erecting extensive studios for C.S. Patterson, Collins-
street east, Melbourne. His career has been a varied one, but
as he has secured the respect and esteem of his fellow citizens,
of which he justly feels proud, he has no reason for complain .
ing of his adopted land.


JOHN TURNER.
Mr. John Turner is the eldest son of the Rev. John Turner,
Baptist minister, of Fitzroy. He was born at Brighton, Sussex,
England, Jan. 3, 1839, and arrived at Melbourne, on Jan. 3,
1850. For several years he engaged in the shipping trade, and
in 1870 was appointed Post-Master for South Yarra, which
at that time was a very small office. He at once began an agi-
tation for the extension of the telegraphic system to South
Yarra, and eventually induced the authorities to carry out his
suggestions. In the year 1877, while holding the office of Post-
Master and Telegraph Manager, at the imminent risk of being
deprived of his position, he, from the public platform, advo-
cated a half-holiday on Saturdays for all Victorian letter-
carriers. In a great measure, through his exertions,
the boon was granted by the Department. The benefits
thus derived by an honest and a hard-working class
of public servants were not long confined to this
colony. New South Wales and South Australia fol-
lowed the example set by Victoria. With pleasure we record
the fact that Mr. Turner’s efforts on behalf of the letter-carriers
have not been forgotten. At the banquet held in January of
each year to celebrate the event, the name of Mr. Turner is
invariably coupled with the half-holiday toast, and precedes
all other toasts excepting, of course, those of loyal character.
The Sydney officers acknowledged the services of Mr. Turner,
who was instrumental in securing for them the great con-
cession, by a communication full of thanks. At the time of
Mr. Turner’s retirement from the public service in 1884, South
Yarra office had become one of the most important in the
colony. Since his withdrawal from the Postal Department he
has engaged extensively in business of both a public and private
nature. He is widely known as a highly successful financier and
auctioneer, having invested his capital upon the Building
Society principle, in building in Richmond and South Yarra,
permitting his clients to become their own landlords, by mak-
ing time payments in lieu of rent. V e understand that he is
the largest private lender, under this system, in Victoria. In
1877 he was elected a member of the City Council for Prahran,
and he has been re-elected at every subsequent triennial elec-
tion, viz., 1880-83-86. He was chosen Mayor by a unanimous
vote in 1882, and discharged his duties with skill, probity, and
discretion. As a councillor he is thoroughly practical, and
labours with untiring zeal for the benefit of the city, of which
he is an honoured citizen. He occupies a loading position in
every public movement in South Yarra and Toorak, and is a
member of The Auctioneers’ and Estate Agents’ Association.
DAVID NEWELL.
Mr. David Newell was born in the county of Galway, in
Ireland, on the 25th December, 1835. When twenty-three
years of age, hearing glowing accounts of the Antipodes, he
started for Australia and landed in Victoria in 1858.
Attracted to the goldfields on his arrival, he engaged for
some years in quartz reefing and, proving passably successful,
abandoned the pursuit and settled in Footscray, where he has
resided for the past twenty-one years. For a number of those
years he has represented the Footscray ratepayers in the local
Council Chamber, and was on three different occasions, elected
to occupy the Mayoral chair. On two occasions he was
induced to contest the representation of Footscray in the
Legislative Assembly, but, unfortunately, was opposed both
times by very popular candidates, and then his defeats were
almost victories inasmuch as he was beaten by very small
majorities. His first o2iponent was the late M. L. King, and
his second, one of the present sitting members, Mr. W. M.
Clark. Mr. Newell’s courtesy, uprightness, and integrity of
purpose are well known throughout the district in which he
resides, and it is more than probable that were the opportunity
to again arise, and could he be induced to oiler himself, he
would secure a seat in the Lower House of the Legislature of
Victoria.
JOHN ZEVENBOOM.
Reference has already been made in many instances to
characters which have in a great measure helped to form the
early history of the colony of Victoria. These characters,
usually severed from politics, and unassuming, unobtru-
sive, and carefully anxious of refraining from taking any part
in the larger and more momentous questions that agitate
parties from time to time, have yet influenced for good the
general weal, and have by their perseverance, uprightness,
and steadfastness of purpose, taught a lesson to the younger
generation of the possibilities of this world.
Of such men we have an example in Mr. John Zevenboom,
who was born in Amsterdam in 1823. He received his educa-
tion in his native town, and immediately on arriving at a
suitable age was apprenticed to his father, who at that time
carried on an extensive business in the brushware line at
Amsterdam. His apprenticeship was so faithfully gone
through, and his time so profitably employed, that on the
completion of his time, it was found that he had become one
of the most expert hands in the factory, and as a result he
was taken into partnership with his father. Here he
diligently worked until the year 1856, when the mania for
gold -mining, consequent on the reports of the wonderful gold-
fields which were said to be discovered in Australia, affected
him with thousands of others, and in March of that year he
found himself in Melbourne. His immediate care was to rush
off and make his fortune in a few days, but “ Fortune ” was
too coy, and after months of hard and constant labour and
mental worry, he was obliged to return to Melbourne. In
1860, bethinking himself of his trade, and finding that a very
good opening existed, he established the first Brush Manufac-
tory in Melbourne, and this it is stated was the first factory
of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. For the first three
or four years the struggles for success were severe, and the
little factory in A’Beckett-street was the scene of many a hard
fight with “Fortune,” but undaunted energy and a determina-
tion to succeed at last crowned his efforts, andagradual though
continual tide of prosperity set in. The little factory gave
place to a bigger, and employment was afforded a large number
of hands, until the present, when it can be said that he stands
unrivalled in his line of business; and also, that every brush
factory in the colony might be said to be an offshoot of his,


since the proprietors or managers of all learnt their business I
at his place. In 1871 he was elected a member of the Berwick j
Shire Council, and created a Justice of the Peace. It is need- j
less to state that he discharged his duties both as a magistrate
and a councillor with that diligence and honesty so character-
istic of him. In 1870 he was appointed one of the Commis-
sioners to the Paris Exhibition. In the beginning of 1879 a '
vacancy occurring in the City Council for the representation j
of Bourke Ward, Mr. Zevenboom was requested to stand, and
consenting, was returned by a large majority. He was then
appointed a Commissioner for the International Exhibition of
1880, and rendered such efficient aid that he was not forgotten
in the list of Commissioners for the Centennial Exhibition, to
be held in 1888. In October, 1887, the appointment of Vice-
Consul for the Netherlands was conferred on him. He still
continues a member of the City Council, and is likely to hold j
his seat till he voluntarily resigns.
THOMAS SMITH,
Councillor, South Melbourne.
In a young and eminently democratic colony, where individual
merit materially assists in bringing its possessor into notice
and where the minor arenas for the development of those
qualities which partially form a politician are looked upon as
the preparatory schools for the education of such, any one
who is singled out both by his confreres and such of the
general public as may be interested as a “ coming man,” must
necessarily be considered deserving mention, especially in a |
comprehensive work of the nature of this volume.
It often transpires that what is considered merit, is not j
dissociated from obtrusiveness, and many a rising man, !
no sooner is he looked upon with a kindly eye, becomes so
painfully cognisant of his own importance and so persistently
desirous of impressing that sense of importance on others,
that he gradually loses the good graces of that portion of
the community which has the right and the power to advance
his interests in order that he might look after theirs. Of all
the minor schools or arenas adverted to, none possesses
superior claims than the Council Chamber.
Of the Emerald Hill (South Melbourne) Council, something
has already been written, and of all its members none deserves
greater consideration for steadfastness and integrity of
purpose, together with a disposition for unobtrusiveness, than
the subject of this sketch.
Born at Warwick, in England, he arrived in Victoria with |
his parents in the year 1856 in the “ Moorsfort.” After a stay of
a few months in Melbourne his father removed to Launceston,
Tasmania, with his family and remained there until 1859,
when he returned to Victoria, since which year Mr. Thomas
Smith has been a resident in the colony. Having received a
fair education Mr. Smith was in his youth apprenticed to the
hat manufacturing business in Melbourne, and on the com-
pletion of his training commenced business for himself in
Clarendon-street, South Melbourne, in 1871. Electing to set
up his lares and pennies in that town, from the first he mani-
fested a desire to further its interests in every conceivable way,
and to that end identified himself with every movement that
had for its end the ulterior improvement of what used to be
termed the “model city.” As time progressed Mr. Smith’s
qualifications became to be recognised and appreciated to such
an extent that he either has been or is now associated in some
measure with most of the local institutions. He was for
some years a director of the Emerald Hill and Sandridge (now
the Federal) Life Assurance Society, and has been for the past
three years or more a member of the School Board of Advice.
He was one of the founders of the Enterprise Permanent
Building and Investment Society, and has been on its com-
mittee of management since its establishment. On the death
of Mr. Alexander Moore, a much-respected citizen of South
Melbourne, and one of the directors of the South Melbourne
Permanent Building Society, Mr. Smith was elected to fill the
vacancy on the board, and up to the present he has so con-
ducted himself that the shareholders have had reason to con-
gratulate themselves on their choice.
It was not until August, 1885, that our subject sought for
and obtained a seat at the local Council board. The petition
for the division of the municipality into wards was about this
time granted, and on the expiry of the term for which Coun-
cillors had been elected, the whole Council within a twelve-
month of Mr. Smith’s return had to face the ratepayers.
Notwithstanding the comparatively short service of the
gentleman in question, such was the promise given during his
novitiate that he was returned by the ratepayers of Beacons-
fleld Ward, and immediately on the assembling of the Coun-
cil, now formed of fifteen members, was offered the mayoralty, a
position which he gracefully declined owing to the fact that
the coveted seat had been canvassed for by another Councillor.
On his refusal of this position he was elected a member of the
Legislative Committee, and has since then served in that
position with benefit to his constituents and eclat to himself.
Looking upon the Municipal Council Chamber as a sort of
preparatory school for the Legislative Assembly, and bearing
in mind that the latter body has generally recruited from
such schools, we do not think we would be misleading our
readers by prophesying that the time is not far distant when
Mr. Thomas Smith will be afforded an opportunity of render-
ing South Melbourne and Victoria such service as his honesty,
intelligence, and experience qualify him for. Mr. Smith has
received one of the very few appointments conferred on South
Melbournites of a Commissioner for the Centennial Exhibi-
tion to be held in Melbourne in 1888.
WILLIAM THOMAS McFEE.
In the life histories of others in this volume, we have en-
deavoured to show that the prosperity and position of the
colony at the present day is not due solely to those who are
known as politicians, and who hitherto have absorbed all the
interest and consideration of the general public. Although
politics of late has been an important factor in the develop-
ment of the colony, it cannot with any truth be asserted that
it has been the principal; and when we come to review the
struggles, the abnegation and the indomitable energy of
those who have built up the commercial status of the colony,
we cannot but allot a prominent position to the unobtrusive


workers who can point with pride to Melbourne and say, “I
had a part, no matter how mean, in making her what she is.”
Look in whatever direction we might, we can only see the
results of commercial enterprise which followed fast the
unstable and doubtful results of the “ gold-fever” in 1852-53-
54. Attracted by the charms of a versatile and potential life,
the father, like many hundreds of others, of the subject of
this sketch, came to this modern land of promise, but of his
struggles and failures or successes we need have nothing to
say.
William Thomas M‘Fee was born in Little Collins-street on
the 23rd August, 1852, and received his early education under
the well-known Mr. Horsfall, of George-street, Fitzroy. In
1866, the family left for New Zealand, when the subject of
this paper, at the age of fourteen, entered the service of Messrs.
Briscoe and Co. Eemaining with the firm for a space of four
years, Mr. McFee returned to Melbourne and attached himself
to the firm of James McEwan and Co., and subsequently
obtained a position with Messrs. M‘Lean Bros, and Eigg,
with whom he spent ten years and a half. He left them to
take the management of the firm then known as Long and
Co., and remained with that firm for two years, when, pos-
sessed of extreme vitality and a thorough belief in the proverb
that—
“ There’s a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,”
he started in business for himself in the premises occupied by
him at present in Elizabeth-street. Mr. McFee commenced
business with only three assistants, but such was the favor in
which he was held that his business gradually increased until
now, when he employs no fewer than sixteen hands. His busi-
ness embraces both wholesale and retail trade. In politics
Mr. McFee is a Constitutionalist, and has evinced the greatest
interest in municipal matters. So favorably known did he
become to the ratepayers of Hawthorn, where he has resided
for the past ten years, in regard to honesty of purpose and a
consideration for the welfare of the district in which he re-
sided, at Auburn Grove, Upper Hawthorn, that on the 11th of
August, 1887, on a requisition signed by over three hundred of
such ratepayers, he was asked to represent them. Acquiescing
in the general desire he consented to stand, and was elected by
a majority of over four hundred at the head of the poll, by
the largest number of votes (1508) ever polled in Hawthorn.
He is an active committeeman of the Australian Natives’ Asso-
ciation of the Boroondara Branch. Mr. McFee occupies the
position of President of the Auburn Bowling Club, and Vice-
President of the Hawthorn Cricket Club, and is also connected
with other clubs and associations. He is an Oddfellow and
a Freemason. In addition to devoting himself to his legiti-
mate business of a wholesale and retail ironmonger and
importer, Mr. McFee has dabbled in land, and in such
speculations he has been more than ordinarily successful. He
is largely interested in land at Dandenong, Whittlesea, Surrey
Hills, and also has a summer residence at Phillip Island.
He is a Congregationalist and has been identified with that
body all his life, being at present a member of St. Augustine’s
Church at Hawthorn. He is a member of the Jubilee Com-
mittee in connection with that church.
Mr. McFee married in 1874 and is the father of seven
children. He owes much of his success and present prosperity
to the wise counsels of his helpmate. For honesty, integrity
of purpose, and a determination to uphold the prestige and
advancement of the district for which he happens to be one of
the municipal representatives, Mr. McFee is unrivalled, and
his actions up to the present in all matters relating to the
municipality indicate that in him the ratepayers have found
one whom they can trust and one whom they can respect.
ROBERT CHAMBERLAIN,
Hay salesman, and produce commission agent, New Hay-
market. This sketch presents as varied an experience as the
most “indurated colonial” could wish to read of. Mr.
Chamberlain arrived in Victoria at the latter end of 1853, and
essayed to the Ballarat diggings on foot, but returned after
a two days’ tramp, and took boat for Geelong, thence per
bullock dray. The only ‘ ‘ success ’’ he met with was in catching
the fever, which necessitated his return to Melbourne. On
recovering his health he entered the employment of Messrs.
Robertson, Martin, and Smith, at £4 a week, and after saving
£l2O, bought a horse and dray for £l4O and struck out a
career for himself; in three weeks he paid the balance due on
his purchase. His next contract was to deport 300 Chinamen
to Campbell’s Creek, returning with a cargo of diggers, and
was financially successful. For some time hereafter he
“ bought and sold ” in such a manner as left him a tolerably
large measure of profit, insomuch as to induce him to take a
trip to England ; and as an earnest of his own good fortune,
forwarded £2O in advance to his relations. After trading
successfully in the corn trade till 1880 he paid another visit
to England for the benefit of his health ; and on his return
joined Mr. W. S. Kingston, as millers and grain merchants.
The mill was subsequently destroyed by fire, but was, fortun-
ately, covered by an insurance up to £3,700, although, atthat,
the firm were great losers, and the Insurance Company
allowed them the salvage. On the dissolution of the partner-
ship, Mr. Chamberlain entered into negotiations with Mr.
Marshall, of the firm of Fenton and Marshall, for his present
business in 1882. Success continued to follow, for, in the
first year, the increase in the business rose from £70,000 to
£lOO,OOO. Mr. Chamberlain also bought a station at Glen-
burnie, but, after two years, had to dispose of it, to give an
undivided attention to his city business.
WILLIAM OWEN.
Mb. Owen was born at Adelaide in 1851, and proceeded to
Sandhurst with his father’s family the same year. At an
early age he became a miner. He recently sold out his
interest in a mine at Eushforth for £BOOO. In 1886 he pur-
chased 420 acres of land two miles north-west of Tatura,
where he now resides. Two hundred and fifty acres are under
cultivation. He keeps good stock, and raises excellent crops
of wheat, oats, &c. His family consists of one son and one
daughter.

PART lI.—YOL. I.
THE OLD COLONISTS' ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA.
all the institutions in our midst none should have so great an interest for us as the above, because
rISIMI brings us back to the days of our birth as a colony. There is an eternal fitness in the nature
of things. We are ushered into the world, helpless and aimless, unable to control our actions,
incapable of guiding ourselves aright. Our progress is fortuitous; our conduct is ofttiraes the result of
impulse rather than of choice. Such being the case, we stand in need of counsel which will enable us to act
out the drama of life; and when we come to reflect seriously on the part we have played, and the manner in
which we have interpreted it, we find not unfrequently that much of it is undeserving of congratulation—here
a false step, there an unexpected failure. Over many of those who have failed, and over many of those who
have succeeded, the grave has closed. Notwithstanding this fact, there remain a few who could tell the story
of the colony’s birth, who saw it in its swaddling clothes, and who contributed by their efforts to rear it with
such care, and who bestowed so much thought on its growth, as to give it a healthy constitution and a vigorous
physique. What could not some of these old colonists relate of Port Phillip in its earliest days, when with stout
hearts and strong arms they put forth their energies to build a colony and its capital city, which stands unrivalled
for progress in the annals of colonisation ? But this colony has had its days of gloom—its hours of trial and
distress. In 1841 and 1842 Port Phillip received a large accession of population, and its progress became almost
magical. Prosperity smiled on all. But in the latter part of 1842 and 1843 a severe monetary crisis overtook
the colony of New South Wales, which at this time included Port Phillip. In Melbourne there was great distress,
and failures were of frequent occurrence, numbers of merchants and stockowners passing through the Insolvency
Court. Cattle and sheep would not sell at any price, the consequence being that many colonists were ruined.
Sheep at that period formed the main source of production, but had depreciated so much in value that flocks which would
have previously brought £1 10s. to £2, sold at from Is. 2d. to 4s. a head. Cessation of immigration, over-speculation,
and extravagance occasioned this state of affairs. There were at this time from a million and a half to two millions of
sheep in Port Phillip alone; and, on the suggestion of Mr. O’Brien, of Yass—who showed that even for tallow this number
represented three-quarters of a million of money—large boiling-down establishments were started. This step averted a
financial disaster of the gravest description. Hundreds were enabled to clear off their encumbrances by turning their old
ewes into tallow. Trade revived to such an extent that the value of exports over imports showed a balance in favour of the
district of £66,000.
Henceforth, the colonists practised strict economy, and the lesson they received was so severe as not to be easily forgotten.
Perhaps that which changed the destinies of the land so effectually was the discovery of gold in 1851, to which we have
devoted some space in this volume ; and it is not to be wondered at if many of our old colonists feel a great pride in having
been actors in those exciting times. Some of them take a retrospective view with feelings of sadness, and ere long their ears
will be deaf to the praises or censures of men. It is to provide a home for those on whom the goddess Fortune has not smiled,
1869, that the Old Colonists’ Association was called into existence. The Hon. G. S. Coppin, M.L.A., who originated it in the year
was born on April 8, 1819 (the year of Her Most Gracious Majesty's birth), at Steyning, Sussex, during a visit of his parents
to that town. He is one of the most active and useful members of society in Victoria; and not only is this Association, but
many other charitable institutions, greatly indebted to his liberality. He is, in addition, the founder of the Victorian Humane
Society, and the Dramatic and Musical Association. Desirous of placing “on record, by the establishment of an Old
Colonists’ Association, the names of those who have been instrumental in founding, on a broad and firm basis, a colony which
promises to outstrip, in wealth and greatness, all the colonial dependencies of the British Crown,” he convened a meeting of
Old Colonists at Menzies’ Hotel, Melbourne, May 11,1869 (thus signalising his jubilee year), at which the following gentlemen
were present: —Messrs. G. S. Coppin, J. C. King, Peter Davis, William Hull, Michael Lynch, Henry N. Hull, Thomas
Moubray, David Ogilvy, E. S. Montefiore, Joseph Sutherland, D. S. Campbell, J. Cosgrave, Kobert Turnbull, J. C. Bear, John
Mackenzie, A Woolley, Benjamin Williams, Thos. Strode, Jas. Stewart, Doyle, Dr. Thomas, Dr. Barker. The Mayor, Mr.
Thomas Moubray, having been voted to the chair, requested Mr. Coppin to explain the object for which he had called the
present meeting.


Mr. Coppin, having explained his views for the establishment of an Old Colonists’ Association, proposed That an
Association be established, to be called the Old Colonists’ Association of Victoria, to consist of persons resident in the
colony twenty years and upwards.” This motion was seconded by Mr. Peter Davis, and carried unanimously. Mr. William
Hull then proposed and Mr. Peter Davis seconded the motion for the appointment of a Committee, which would consist of
twelve gentlemen entrusted with the drafting of the rules and regulations of the Association, and report to a general meeting,
to be held on the first Tuesday in June. The following were appointed as Committeemen : —Messrs. George S. Coppin,
Thomas Moubray, J. C. King, Wm. Hull, J. B. Were, J. Sutherland, David Ogilvy, Peter Davis, John Mackenzie, H. Henty,
H. Creswick, and Dr. Barker.
The rules and regulations of the Association were adopted unanimously at the general meeting summoned for the
Ist June, 186'J, the day on which it was established. They are some 27 in number, and start with a description of the
constitution and objects of the Association. The first office-bearers and council were as follow : President, His Honour Judge
Pohlman; vice-president G. S. Coppin, Esq.; treasurer, David Ogilvy, Esq. The council consisted of Messrs. E. Barker, D. S.
Campbell, H. Creswick, P. Davis, D. C. McArthur, H. A. Coffey, John McKenzie, Thos. Moubray, J. B. Were, A. Woolley, W.
Plummer, and J. A. Marsden. During the first year 303 members were enrolled, and from the seventeenth annual report
read at the annual general meeting 23rd November, 1886, the continued progress of the Association was illustrated by the
large number of 130 members being elected during the year, making a grand total of 755. The qualification for membership,
which at the inception of the Association consisted in a residence in the colony of Victoria for a period of at least 20 years,
has been increased to 25 years. Such members, as well as those who arrived previous to the 23rd November, 1855
(being the day upon which Constitutional Government in Victoria was proclaimed), and their male descendants, are termed
“ Pioneers.” The Association consists of life-governors, governors, and members, and is now under the patronage of Sir H.
B. Loch, the Hon. G. S. Coppin, M.L.A., acting as vice-patron. All donors of £lO 10s. and upwards are life-governors ; all
persons subscribing £2 2s. or more annually are governors, and all subscribers of £1 Is. annually are members.
Life-governors and governors are only eligible as members of the council, and have the privilege of voting at ballots for the
election of inmates to the Homes. The objects of the Association were well stated at the Colonial Reunion Banquet in
London, organised by the indefatigable Mr. George Coppin, and held on the 15th July, 1886. On that occasion about
150 Australian Old Colonists dined together at the Kensington Town Hall, under the presidency of the Right Hon.
H. C. Childers, the Home Secretary. Tiie dinner had been organised by Mr. George Coppin, vice-president of
the Old Colonists’ Association of Victoria, and it was utilised to make known the objects of that Association, and to
appeal to colonists to support it. But the gathering was a “Reunion of Australian Old Colonists who have resided
in England for many years, and those visiting the Exhibition.” This description, however, was preceded by the words
“ Confederation Banquet ” on the first page of a little pamphlet setting forth the objects and work of the Association, which
pamphlet had the list of toasts printed at the back. The vice-chairmen were the Agents-Genei’al of the Colonies. The
company included Sir Henry Barkly, Sir Andrew Clarke, Sir W. J. Clarke, Bart., Mr. J. Henniker-Heaton, M.P., the Hon. W.

The loyal toasts having been drunk with marked enthusiasm,
The Chairman said : The next toast which I am authorised to propose is that of “ Peace, Progress, and Prosperity to the
Australian colonies.” This is called on our paper a “ Confederation Banquet,” and it is also called a “ Reunion of Australian
Old Colonists who have resided in England for many years, and those visiting the Exhibition.” I will allude first to the
second title which our banquet takes, that which describes it as an occasion upon which some of us who are old—some,
indeed, very old—colonists living in this country have the great privilege and pleasure of meeting those who are younger as
colonists, and who have come here to enjoy the Exhibition, which is so pleasant and agreeable to all of us. Speaking for
myself as one of the former class, being a tolerably old colonist—and I do not think there are a great many here who went
to the colonies before I did—l must say it is an immense pleasure to greet those—the majority of you present who have
come over on this pleasant expedition, and whom we have the opportunity of shaking by the hand, and wishing you
all happiness. It is some thirty-five years since I became a colonist of Victoria; and there are not many around me now I
see one or two—who are older colonists in that sense than I am. It was the happiest time of my life that I spent in the
colony; and it is one of the happiest occasions of my recent years when I have the opportunity of seeing others, better
colonists than I was, for they have stayed longer in the colony of Victoria than I did, or in some of the adjacent Australian
colonies, but who cannot have a greater affection for that part of Her Majesty’s dominions than I and other Old Colonists
have now, and who cannot have a greater satisfaction than I have in meeting, as on the present occasion, old fellow-colonists
at this hospitable board. The affection between the colonists has always been very remarkable. Those of us in England
are accustomed to meet together, and then we meet as members of a very extensive community. The special interests which
we have are found to be general interests common to all; and when colonists meet together, they have peculiar and great
privileges in conversing upon the special interests of the colonial communities in which they dwelt, in which the best parts
of their lives were passed; and I cannot imagine any greater satisfaction to them, whether they be Old Colonists like some of
us, or younger colonists, like some of you, than to be able to exchange experiences as they have done during the visit of so
many to this great Exhibition, and to let all England and the world know what the character of the colonies and the colonists
is, and how much the colonists ought to be regarded and respected by the rest of their fellow subjects. (Cheers.) So much
for the second title of our banquet to-day—that of the reunion of Old Colonists with younger men who have come here only
upon a visit. Now let me say a word upon the second title ; it is called a Confederation Banquet. I remember thirty years
ago some of us who were in public life in Australia—and particularly in Victoria took a good deal of interest in that great
question of Confederation, because it was our belief that if the Australians were to be strong they ought to be well bound
together, and that nothing would more strengthen and attach the colonies to the mother State than the fact that they were
so bound together, and would act together, and could in that way add greatly to the strength of our great Empire. lam not
going to touch upon politics, whether they be the politics of this country or the politics of Australia, and least of all am I
going to refer to any of the controversies which have arisen within the last few years on this subject of Australian
confederation which has made some progress, but which cannot be said to be anything like completed ; but this I think I
can say with the concurrence of all who are here to-day, that in some shape or other, though it may be a difficult question to
decide the exact shape, we all wish that the Empin should be confederated. (Cheers.) We all wish that among the nations
of the world the United Kingdom and the British Empire should be bound together, home and colonies alike, and, whatever
difficulties may attend that operation—and no one is more conscious of them than I am—l feel sure that, if we have one
mind, if we have one will, we shall find a means to our end, and that the Empire in all its parts, whether it be at home or
whether it be abroad, in our dependencies or in our colonies, will gain enormously when that great problem has been solved.
Therefore I thank Mr. Coppin, to whom we owe so much on the present occasion, for having put at the head of this paper
the magic words, “ Confederation Banquet,” because I feel certain, from the manner in which those words have been received,
although we may differ as to the method of confederation, we all desire that it may be satisfactorily concluded. (Cheers.)
Without further remark I ask you to drink to the toast, with which I couple the names of the Agents-General of the Colonies.
Sir Saul Samuel, who was indistinctly heard, was understood to say that the toast simply meant that a number of
Australian gentlemen drank “ prosperity to our noble selves.” As to this being described as a “ Confederation Banquet,” he had
no idea that it was anything but a social gathering—a reunion of Australian Colonists. (Cheers.) He had no idea that it was to be
in any sense a political gathering. Confederation was a large question upon which he, as Agent-General for New South Wales,
was not disposed to express any opinion on that occasion. He would not express any opinion as to whether the Australian
colonies ought to confederate or not. If ever the time came for them to do so, he thought they would be confederated in the
same way that the provinces of Canada were confederated, and that there would be a central body on which all the colonies
would be equally represented. He was about the oldest colonist in the room. Having referred to what he did in 1837 and
1841 he sail that he was appointed to attend a conference of delegates from all the Australian colonies in 1870. He had
seen the Colony of Victoria separate from the mother colony; but the mother was proud of her daughter, and the two would
always be united by ties of affectionate regard. (Interruptions and cheers.) He was not one of those who were actuated
with feelings of jealousy with regard to the Colony of Victoria; there was no reason why the people of New South Wales should
be- they were marching ahead of her. (Oh.) They were all Australians there; but still if Victoria had been, so tar as


statistics indicated tbeir relative positions, tar ahead of Now South Wales, the mother colony was now reassuming her right
position ; and her people were proud to see the progress made by the colonies which had sprung from New South Wales. That
progress was evidence in favour of the self-government they had enjoyed. Their attachment to, and their readiness to help
the mother country, was abundantly manifested by what had occurred in connection with the campaign in the Soudan.
Sir Graham Berry.—lt is an easy task to reply to such a toast. We are all Australians, and we all wish peace and
prosperity to the Australian colonies. (Cheers.) If we could have assembled within these walls all the English people, the
toast would have been drunk with quite as much enthusiasm. It is impossible as Australian visitors to the mother country)
in the heart of that country, in the city of London, not to realise how thoroughly the colonies are appreciated by the mother
country. Much as we may desire the continuance of peace, progress, and prosperity to the Australian colonies, we are quite
sure the mother country desires it equally with us. lam quite sure it is a fact which must come home to the mind of the
last speaker, because to-morrow he is in the happy position of successfully floating a loan of five-and-a-half millions.
(Laughter.) By the best and dearest of all ties we have linked the mother country with us in the desire for the continued
prosperity of these colonies, which are so largely her debtors. However, Ido not think any of us have the slightest doubt as
to the continued prosperity of these great colonies, from which we simply for a short time are absent. The foundations of
their prosperity are laid broad and deep, not only in the conditions of the countries, but in the attributes of the men who
have founded the colonies. Whether in New South Wales, in Queensland, or in Victoria, the colonists are all animated by
the British spirit that does not know failure. They always go onward to success. They may possibly meet with checks now
and then, but they never despair, for they always feel that in those new countries they can raise the flag of prosperity.
(Cheers.) There is just one thing wanting—well, not absolutely wanting, but lacking in the complete fulfilment of promise—
that would add to the security of their prosperity in the future, and that is the giving up of all mean local feeling of one
colony against another (cheers), and fully realising the great future before them. If they will only rise to the height of the
occasion, and sink all petty differences in the one feeling of advancing Australia (cheers), they will attain to the position
which it is easy for them to occupy among the communities of the world. That position must be attained either in this
generation or in the next, and are we to allow the honour to depart from us and to descend to our children ? This is within
our grasp, the real, true, hearty federation of all the great Australian colonies. I say there is no other sentiment that is worth
the acceptance of Australians at the present time ; and mind in doing that, in working out our own destiny, in doing the best
for our own country, we are paving the way for that higher and greater confederation, the confederation of the whole Empire.
What Canada has done Australia ought to do. Canada is the right arm, and Australia ought to be the left arm of England.
We shall be unable to be that until confederation is carried out. There can be no higher conception of the toast; all this is
bound up in the near approach of the grand confederation of the Australasian colonies. (Cheers.)
Sir James F. Garrick, Agent-General for Queensland, said it was a pleasant thing to reflect upon the great change in
public opinion regarding the colonies which had been effected in this country within the last few years. It was within the
memory of the youngest of them when many people had almost made up their minds that the colonies were of little or no
value to this country. It was said that the advantages derived from trading with the colonies could be gained just as well if
they were under any other flag. It was said that in time of war the protection of commerce with colonies so distant would
cast too heavy a burden upon the old country. All this was changed, and public men no longer sought for a decent
opportunity to say “good-bye ”to the colonies. It had been realised that in times of peace the trade with our colonies was
a considerable part of our commerce ; that while trade with foreign nations had been standing still or going back, that with
the colonies had been growing by leaps and bounds, and making up for the foreign trade we were losing. So much for the
opinion that trade was wholly independent of the flag. Then as to times of war, he believed that all Australians felt, almost
more deeply than Englishmen did, any slight or injury to the old country. (Cheers.) The hearts of Australians leaped with
joy at any great success which this country achieved over her enemies. The colonies might quarrel amongst themselves.
The company had just seen evidences of their friendly rivalry. (Laughter.) Have you not seen (said Mr. Garrick) my dear
old friend, Sir Saul Samuel, stand up—and I glory in him for it—for the colony in which I was born ? I honour Mr. Graham
Berry for standing up for his colony, that small yet still great colony of Victoria. I am going to stand up for my colony
too. I have not the slightest doubt —though this is not a fitting occasion to do it—-that I could prove to you to demonstration
that she is the best of the lot. Ido not call this quarrelling ; I call this friendly rivalry. (Cheers.) We are proud of you>
although Victoria is always so pugnacious. (Laughter.) If any foreigner were to interfere with us in our quarrels, we
should say “ Hands off; it is no business of yours.” The Exhibition is an illustration of our friendly rivalry ; but with all
we are the best of friends. If we have a difference we can fight it out fairly, and bury the hatchet directly the fight is over
So here we are nothing more than friendly rivals. With reference to the talk about confederation, when we discuss the
questions with Ministers here, we find that one colony will take one view and another will take another view, and we cannot
get Ministers to direct our efforts straight at one point when we are unable to make up our minds. I hope if there is ever to
be colonial confederation, it will grow up something very much larger than is sketched out in the Bill. With respect to the
greater question of confederating the colonies with this country, I think it is impossible to sketch out any constitution on
paper which would work without friction. It is much better to let us grow up by events into confederation. Let us nourish


that sentiment of loyalty which has been so strongly exhibited of late. If it be properly nourished, events will lead to the
confederation of the Empire. You may say, “We have talked about it too long, and it is becoming stale but, while
Australians are so eager to come to the relief of the mother country, and so determined that no harm shall happen to her,
out of such feeling and consequent co-operation will grow a permanent confederation. Public men should bear in mind that,
while by all honourable means they seek alliances with foreign countries, it is one of their duties to nourish Imperial
federation. If that be properly nourished, it will be seen that any country that draws the sword against England will have
to take into account not only the old country, but also the great possessions whose representatives are met on this occasion.
The Hon. Adye Douglas said he might be excused for mentioning the fact that Tasmania had been chosen as the
meeting-place of the Council for the federation of Australia. It was well known that the gentleman who had taken the chief
part in the effort to bring about confederation was a native-born Tasmanian. Referring to the rivers and resources of
Tasmania and to the character of its people, he predicted that before long they would take the lead in Australia. Victoria,
he claimed, was simply the offspring of Tasmania.
Mr. Charles Warner recited a poem on the recent co-operation of the New South Wales contingent with the British
forces in the Soudan.
The Chairman conveyed the thanks of the company to Mr. Warner for his noble recitation.
Sir Andrew Clarke proposed the next toast—“ Success to the Old Colonists’ Association of Victoria.” He said that
some thirty years ago Mr. Coppin and himself went on a stumping tour around Melbourne, agitating for the establishment of
those municipalities which, after all, were the foundation of the prosperity of the Australian Colonies. He remembered
telling Mr. Coppin that he ought to be a soldier because he had the power of organisation ; and that power he had shown in
organising that entertainment. The toast was one which must appeal to the heart of every Australian. One of the objects
of the Old Colonists’ Association was stated to be to encourage a friendly recognition of the great Australian brotherhood.
That object they were fulfilling by the friendly recognition in a general assembly of what each colony had done for the rest of
the Empire. Another object of the Association was said to be to promote the advancement of native-born Victorians. His
own knowledge of them was that they required little encouragement in this respect, and that they had plenty of backbone of
their own. (Laughter.) Another object of the Association was to promulgate facts relative to the early history of the colony.
He could remember a member sitting next to him in the Assembly of Victoria who stood up and said : “ This hand cut the
first wool; this hand planted the first vine ; this hand ploughed the first furrow ; this hand bound the first sheaf of corn.”
This was in 1837 or 1838; and what a contrast between the state of things thus referred to and that illustrated by the display at
the Exhibition, not only of the raw products, but also of the art and science products of the colonies under the Southern
Cross ! Mr. Childers had said that politics were not to be spoken, but he could not refrain from pointing out that the history
of the Australian colonies brought into relief one fact, which was that it was the Old Colonists of Australia who laid deep and
broad the principles of freedom in politics and religion which in great measure had contributed to the progress of the colonies.
There had been broad liberal principles laid down there which were after all the foundation of the stability of the Empire.
The first object of the Association was to assist necessitous Old Colonists. Colonisation had had its victories, and great
victories ; but these victories had not been won—the present position of the colonies had not been obtained—without the field
of colonisation being strewn with the wrecks of many men. Many men had not reaped the fruits of their labour and
enterprise. He could remember some, and he could see the result of their labour and their genius in the Exhibition, and these
men had perished without having in the least reaped the reward of their genius and their labour. There were men now in
Australia who had not been blessed with the success and good fortune of those he saw around him. The appeal was made
on behalf of those who had not had good fortune, and who were placed in necessitous circumstances through no fault of their
own. Victories could not be won without sacrifices, and it was on behalf of those who bad been sacrificed he asked them not
to separate without in some way recognising their labours and assisting to redress their misfortunes.
Mr. Coppin, in responding, said : —Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, —I feel great satisfaction that you consider me
entitled to respond to the toast that has just been given in such an able manner by Sir Andrew Clarke, and received so heartily
by yourselves. lam afraid that too much credit is given to me personally ; it is true that lam the founder of the Association,
but if I had not received the co-operation of gentlemen who were as enthusiastic as myself in carrying out its objects, we
could not have arrived at the satisfactory position we now enjoy. The objects of the Association having been fully explained
to you by Sir Andrew Clarke and the small pamphlet that is before you, I will now say a few words upon its practical working.
In the first place, it is established upon a solid foundation—all donations; the ten guineas paid by life-governors, and one-half the
amount paid by governors, form a permanent fund which is protected by Act of Parliament. The amount at the credit of this
fund at the present time is £3OOO, the interest upon which is available for working expenses ; and, although it is not a very
large income, this particular fund must annually increase, and will ultimately maintain the Association without the solicitation
of donations. Upon becoming a member, the name, age, birthplace, date of arrival in the colony, names of children,
dates of birth, etc., and any other particulars, are entered in a book of registration, which will no doubt become an
historical record of national importance. A page is allotted in this volume to each member, upon which is recorded any
public position he has held, or other matters which the council may think of sufficient importance. Of course the history of


a country may bo easily manufactured from parliamentary documents, newspaper reports, and stories that are handed down
from one to another, which lose nothing by the telling. The law court has lately decided against a statement that had been
printed in an historical work; this could not take place with the Old Colonists’ book of registration, as every entry is made
under the supervision of a council of fifteen Old Colonists, who in most cases are quite familiar with the facts proposed to be
recorded. This, I think, is an unmistakable guarantee that the statement is correct. It is a fact that the early history of a
young country must grow in importance and interest. We must, therefore, deplore that it is so much neglected. Piizes
have been offered for Victorian history without effect. A society was formed for the purpose of collecting and preserving
records relating to the early history of the colony, which seems to have collapsed ; and I regret to say that the registration
book of the Old Colonists is very much neglected. Let us take this meeting to illustrate a few interesting facts. We have
Mr. W. Westgarth, who was elected in Melbourne to represent that district in the Sydney Legislature. He might have
continued to occupy that position if our absurdity of electing the Duke of Wellington, Lord John Russell, and other leading
English politicians to represent us had not brought about the establishment of a Parliament of our own. There is our
worthy chairman, who was a nominee under our old Legislative Council, who took an active part in obtaining responsible
government, who was elected by the voice of the people to represent them in the first Parliament under the glorious
constitution by which we are now governed. We have the first Governor who was appointed to represent Her Most Gracious
Majesty the Queen under responsible Government, and I do no hesitate to say that Sir Henry Darkly was deservedly the
most popular Governor we ever had in the colony. Mr. Hitchcock, with three others now dead, was the first that lived on
Ballarat city site. Sir Saul Samuel visited Melbourne before one Government allotment was sold. Mr. Lansell has done
more for deep sinking than any other miner ; we have pioneer squatters, vintagers, merchants, and others, all of whom have
taken an active part in the early history of the colony, and what record is there of their work ? Absolutely none. When I
have asked for particulars to place on record I have been told that we do not care to boast about what we have done ; but
we ought not to consider our own feelings upon such a matter as this. We ought to do our duty to our children and their
descendants, who will take a pride in tracing their origin to one of the pioneers of a great country. We ought to do our duty
to the colony by giving every assistance in our power in recording a truthful history of passing events. The idea of an Old
Colonists’ Association and Book of Registration occurred to me in the United States twenty years ago. When looking through
an old volume in a public place at Baltimore, examining the signatures of those who took part in the Declaration of Independence,
a tall American stretched his hand over, and pointing to some name, said: “ That was a great man, sir; we are
indebted to him for the successful result of that movement.” He looked perfectly disgusted at me when I told him that
though the names of Washington and others were familiar to me, I had not heard of the gentleman to whom he alluded.
“ Perhaps not, sir,” he said; “ but I tell you he did the work whilst others got the credit. I know, sir; he was my
grandfather.” Oh, oh, thinks I, if the pride of birth exists in this democratic country, why should it not be felt in Australia?
And so it will some day. Someone will be looking over the Old Colonists’ Book of Registration when a voice full of pride and
gratitude will say : “ That man did great work, sir, in the early days of this colony ; that is Captain, afterwards Sir Andrew
Clarke ; he was the father of Municipal Government; of course it was Parliament that passed the Bill, but we were indebted
to his industry, perseverance and talent for the initiation of local self-government that has done more than any other measure to
advance Australia.” A record of facts like these in the early history of the colony would be very interesting; but the main object
of the Old Colonists’ Association is charity. Our chief work is to relieve necessitous Old Colonists. If it were possible for the
gentlemen present to take their seats at the council table and listen to the tales of distress, sickness, and destitution, they
would doubt the correctness of their own hearing ; and this unhappy state of poverty is not confined to Victoria alone; it
exists, I regret to say, throughout Australia. There are many pioneers who by birth, education, and position deserve
something better in their old age and adversity than the ordinary benevolent asylum—men who once held high positions, and
others that were paid for their services, and assisted in laying the foundation of enormous wealth for many that followed
them ; these poor people by sheer ill-luck and adverse turn in the tide of prosperity—for which they were in no way to blame—
are now reduced to absolute want. One of our inmates at the home was a well-to-do merchant in Tasmania when I met
him forty-five years ago ; he was the first person who overtook sheep to Australia Felix, now Victoria, having landed a shipload
for the Hentys at Portland Bay; and when he came to the Old Colonists’ Association for assistance he was absolutely destitute.
He has now a comfortable home to pass the remainder of his days in. We have housed, supported, nursed in sickness, and
buried unsuccessful squatters, merchants, farmers, and others. When walking through the courts of our magnificent
Exhibition, looking with wonder, admiration, and pride upon the display of wealth resulting from the perseverance and skill of
our fellow-colonists, it is very sad to know that many who have faced the difficulties and dangers of early settlement in laying
the foundation of such substantial prosperity are now homeless and penniless. This is probably unknown to many who reside
in England. I therefore hope to receive a liberal response to my appeal for assistance. There are many wealthy old colonists
to whom the erection of a cottage would be a mere trifle, who can afford to perpetuate their name by following the example
of those who have erected a cottage at their own expense; or a few might join together to erect and endow an English cottage ;
some would, perhaps, like to become life-governors or governors, whilst others will probably give a donation. I regret that the
proceeds of this entertainment will scarcely cover its cost; the result to the Old Colonists’ Association will therefore be nil.


If I can return to the colonies with names of many who are here present as members, and some memoranda for our book of
registration, I shall feel that I have been the means of collecting important information toward the early history of the
colony, that the gentlemen who supply it are simply doing an act of justice to themselves and children, and, above all, that
we are assisting to relieve the distresses of a class of pioneers to whom we are indebted for the general prosperity of that
Greater Britain upon the other side of the world of which we justly feel so proud.
Mr. William Westgarth, in proposing “The Colonial and Indian Exhibition,” said: The subject confided to
my charge may well give me a sense not only of high honour but of lofty inspiration, for it is that grand spectacle at South
Kensington, the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, which within the last ten weeks was opened with all its interesting
ceremonies by our Most Gracious Queen, and which has ever since been the wonder and delight of hundreds of thousands of
her people. This is now, for us, the fourth of these grand exhibitions; but this fourth occasion has a material difference
from its predecessors. Ihose were international exhibitions. We besought for them the help of the whole world to complete
our spectacle. This time we rely solely upon ourselves, and present an Exhibition limited to the British Empire. But what
an Exhibition ! Gentlemen, it exceeds in variety, in interest, in importance, all its three predecessors; indeed, I question if
the world has ever yet seen such a varied and interesting exhibition of human industry and skill. Such is the work of our
Empire. And what is the British Empire ? I shall endeavour to answer that question by selecting a few, a very few, of its
salient features. It comprises upwards of nine millions of square miles out of the fifty-and-a-half millions which constitute
the entire land surface of the globe. It claims 30-5 millions of human beings out of the 1600 millions which occupy the earth’s
surface; and its total yearly external trade,intercolonial and international, amounts to 1130 millions sterling, or considerably
more than one-half of the trade of the world. When or where, in the past or the present, has there been another empire
which could deal with figures such as those ? I shall not venture upon the multitudinous particulars of those great interests
of the Empire ; but I cannot resist referring to one, and only one, item of its great commerce—l mean the gold produce.
The Canadian Dominion, in its provinces of British Columbia and Nova Scotia, has given out some share of this most precious
of metals, but the grand field of production has been Australasia. And what has been the amount of that production since
the gold discoveries took place in 1851 ? Up to the beginning of this present year it was no less than 317 millions sterling.
Why, gentlemen, that amount approaches to one-half of our great national debt—that huge debt which with a sort of
national pride we regard as about the biggest concern in a money way in the world. Of all this gold Victoria has contributed
by far the largest share—namely, 216 millions—as the picturesque bridge in the Exhibition representing all the mass of solid
gold may conveniently remind you. New Zealand comes next with 46 millions, New South Wales with 36 millions, and
Queensland with about 18 millions. The other colonies of the group are as yet but fractional, but they are still full of hope,
with great areas of more or less similar country; and already the accounts of this year from West Australia, in their
resemblance to those that reached us first from the rich surface drifts of B allarat and Bendigo in 1851, seem to assure us
that we are on the eve of exposing one more great goldfield. In conclusion, let me give you a story—a small piece of history—
which I am sure will alike interest, surprise and amuse you, as an illustration of the rapid progress of our Empire. What
do you think was the contribution which the colony of Victoria sent to our first exhibition of 1851 ?—that great colony of
to-day, with its million of busy colonists, and its grand court of the Exhibition with its golden bridge, and its almost
countless other exhibits. I know what it was, because the whole of it passed through my hands, so that I was the sole
exhibitor. Gentlemen, it was a small bag of wheaten flour—very good flour it was, but that was all—and I think I can
hardly better illustrate than by this my story the marvellous progress of our Colonial Empire.
Mr. Bosisto, of Victoria, responded, and said it was only right to acknowledge how much the labours of the
Commissioners had contributed to the success of the Exhibition, and they had been most cordially assisted by the
Australian colonists.
Sir H. Barkly proposed “ The Chairman,” and said he must express the gratification he felt at finding himself in the
midst of so large an assembly of Australian Old Colonists. It seemed almost impossible to realise the fact that it was
something like thirty years since he was associated with the chairman in the Government of Victoria. Since that time Mr.
Childers had had a distinguished career in this country. But he had never forgotten his old Australian friends, and he had
always been ready to render them any attention in his power.
Mr. Childers said he was extremely obliged for the cordial way in which the toast had been proposed and received.
As they had been reminded, he was once a member of Sir Henry Barkly’s Government, and there was no one under whom
he had served with greater satisfaction and pleasure. During the years in which it had been his good fortune to serve Her
Majesty in this country, he had never forgotten that his political apprenticeship was passed in Victoria, and that there they
had difficult questions to settle which they could solve only by going back to true first principles, and this recurrence to first
principles had always greatly assisted him in the complicated matters which had come before him for settlement in this
country. It had always been his chief pride that he had served the Queen in a distant part of her Empire, and to that part
of his career he should always look back with the greatest pleasure. It had been a very great satisfaction to him to meet
some whom he had not seen for twenty or thirty years, and to meet other rising colonists who would walk in the path the
Old Colonists had trod before, and he hoped with the same good results to themselves and their families.
The concluding toasts were “ The Press ” and “ The Ladies.”


In the Australian Times and Anglo-New-Zealander of August G, 188G, the newspaper from which the account of the
banquet is taken, the following reference is made to “ The Old Colonists’ Association of Victoria.
'•The outcome of Mr. Coppin’s “Australian Old Colonists’ Reunion,” held at the Kensington Town Hall, has taken
practical shape by the formatien of a committee to collect funds for the purpose of erecting an English cottage in connection
with the Old Colonists’ Home in Victoria. The following circular has been issued and responded to
“ ‘Dear Sir, —On the occasion of the successful dinner of the Old Colonists and their friends at the Kensington down
Hall, on the 15th instant, a wish was expressed to raise a fund sufficient for an additional cottage or home in Victoria, to
give further accommodation for the deserving objects of the charity. These are chiefly the earlier colonists, who have fallen
latterly into poverty, and who may surely urge some claim on the great and wealthy colony of to-day which they helped in
its infancy to build up. About £4OO is required, and a subscription has been promptly begun. The Treasurer, or any
member of the Committee, will be happy to receive further contributions. As Mr. Coppin, who first instituted and has
largely befriended the Association, re-embarks for the colony on the 12th proximo, it may be possible to raise the monej
within that time, and to gratify the benevolent founder of the charity by committing to his personal charge so timely an
addition to its resources. —We are, dear sir, faithfully yours, Walter M. Hitchcock, Win. Wilson, John Radcock, P. H. Nihill,
G. W. Rusden, George Wright, W. Westgarth (Hon. Treasurer), 8 Finch Lane, E.C.’
“Subscriptions received: R. H. D. White, £lO 10s.; Right Hon. H. C. E. Childers, M.P., £5 55.; Sir Heniy Laikly,
K.C.R., £5 ; C. E. Bright, C.M.G., £5; General Sir Andrew Clarke, G.C.M.G., £5; Lieut. St. John Caws, £1 Is.; W. B.
Collyns, £1 Is.; Walter H. Hitchcock, £lO 10s.; W. Westgarth, £lO 10s.; W. J. Bush and Co., £2 25.; H. J. Smith, £1 Is.;

Wilson, M.P., £lO 10s.; Felix W. Spiers, £lO 10s.; J. Paterson, £lO 10s.; Thomas Russell, £3 3s.
“ There are many Old Colonists in England who are greatly indebted to the pioneers who opened up the country for the
wealth they now enjoy, to whom the erection and endowment of a cottage would be a mere trifle, who will no doubt, with
feelings of gratitude and benevolence, follow the example of those who have already had their names inscribed upon the
tablet of a cottage erected at their own cost; but the present appeal is of a more general character, being for a small
donation as an expression of sympathy from England on behalf of the poor and distressed people who assisted to lay the
foundation of wealth that is so attractively displayed at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. As the movement is a very
becoming recognition of services rendered in the early settlement of the colony, and is intended to provide a home (under
the supervision of a council) for those who are now destitute, we trust that the London Committee will receive a very liberal
response to their praiseworthy solicitation.”
As a result of Mr. Coppin’s untiring efforts in the interests of this institution, he was enabled to report, in
November, 1886, that he had received the sum of £IBB towards the erection of the proposed English cottage.
There is also a project on foot for building a cottage to accommodate eight inmates, towards which the sum of
£303 17s. Gd. has been already received, the Hon. John Halfey subscribing £IOO “ in honour of Her Majesty’s Jubilee, and of
our country, which bears her name;” his Excellency the Governor promising a donation of £SO, an example “ which has
been followed by three gentlemen ; Messrs. Francis Clark, A. G. Young, and another, who does not wish his name mentioned.”
There is consequently every prospect of the required sum of £BOO being raised, to carry out the contemplated cottage for
a f ew to use the words of Mr. Halfey—“ of our Old Colonists who have not been fortunate enough to make sufficient provision
for themselves.”
At present there are five cottages erected on the land granted to the Association, and situated on the banks
of the Merri Creek, viz.
The Founder's Cottage, erected by the Hon. G. S. Coppin, M.L.A.; occupied by Mr. \V. Ogilvie and
Mrs. McGeoch.
The Clarke Cottage, erected by Sir W. J. Clarke, Bart., and Joseph Clarke, Esq.; occupied by Mrs.
M. Bignell and Miss Akerman.
The Goldsbeough Cottage, erected by Richard Goldsbrough, Esq.; occupied by Mrs. A. Timbrell and Mrs.
J. Lewis.
The Campbell Cottage, erected by the Hon. W. Campbell; occupied by Mr. J. Green and Mrs. C. Wilkes.
The Association’s Cottage, erected by the Association; occupied by Mrs. A. Farrar and Mr. T. D.
Weatherly.
The leading feature of the Association, namely, to assist “ necessitous Old Colonists,” received serious consideration
from the first Council appointed, and a resolution was passed unanimously to the effect that the establishment of a
permanent “ Home,” where those who had grown feeble through age or were in a state of distress through no fault of their
own could find a resting place, would prove far more beneficial than by responding to the numerous applications for
emporary out-door relief. Having decided to carry out this resolution, application was made to the Government for a piece of


ground suitable for the erection of “ Homes.” The Government responded to the appeal by giving a grant of four and
a-half acres of land on the banks of the Merri Creek, at North Fitzroy, near the Northcote Bridge. During the first year
the land was fenced in, and the Council, in 1886, owing to the members having subscribed a sum of £222 16s. in aid of the
Homes Improvement Fund, has been enabled to drain and put the garden and grounds in fair order, and erect a substantial
iron fence, with entrance gates at the front. As the Railway Department has fenced the northern side of the grounds, the
property is now presentable in appearance, and a credit to the Association.
The Endowments are as follow: —The sum of £I,OOO from the Hon. G. S. Coppin as an endowment to the Founder’s
Cottage, the interest of which is handed to the Association, on the condition that the balance remaining (if any) after
deducting the cost of maintaining the two inmates of the cottage, is placed to the credit of the Permanent Fund ; Richard
Goldsbrough, Esq., handed the sum of £I,OOO to the Association, the balance of which, after paying for the erection of
Goldsbrough Cottage, was to go to the Permanent Fund to support the inmates of the cottage. The balance of £515, which
remained, was applied as directed. When a vacancy occurs at the “ Homes,” applications are invited from old colonists in
distress, such applications being recommended by members of the Association.
These applications are considered and inquired into by the Council, who recommend, say half-a-dozen, for election
by ballot for each vacancy, by the Life-Governors and Governors. Whenever a vacancy occurs there is always a large
number of applicants; on one occasion there being as many as seventy.
In addition to the relief given to inmates at the Homes, numerous applications for outside assistance are made at every
meeting of the Council, most of which are of a very distressing nature, and which the Council is reluctantly compelled to
refuse for want of funds.
The working of the Association is carried on in as economical a manner as possible, the only paid officer being the
secretary, and no assistance is received either from the Government or any other source, excepting from Old Colonists,
large number of whom, it is hoped, will assist the Council by becoming members.
Through the courtesy of Mr. Robert G. Johnson,the Secretary of the Old Colonists’ Association, who has placed at our
disposal all the documents connected with its history, we are enabled to give the biographies of a few of the early colonists
which will prove interesting to our readers. It is a matter of regret that the Registration Book, which is intended to contain
the personal history of each member of the Association, and to which Mr. Coppin at the Confederation Banquet alluded, is
not more largely made use of, especially since it would, as Mr. Coppin pointed out, be a record of facts authenticated by those
who are and have been living witnesses to the truth of the statements. The first biography we shall give will be that of
the founder of
The Old Colonists’ Association.
We have already stated the date and place of his birth. His grandfather officiated as clergyman at Norwich for
upwards of forty years, and all his family connections resided there. His father received a surgeon’s education, but disliking
the medical profession, he adopted the stage as a means of livelihood, and became manager of a company travelling through
his native county, and at intervals visiting Suffolk and Essex. The subject of this sketch became a violinist at an early
age, and occasionally appeared on the stage with his father’s company. When seventeen, Mr. Coppin left home to earn his
bread, with his fiddle under his arm, and in the following year he was stage-manager, actor, and violinist at the Woolwich
Theatre, under the proprietorship of Mr. Saville Fawcett, Mr. Sheridan Knowles being the star. At the termination of the
season the manager of the Richmond Theatre, Mr. Davenport, secured his services, and during that season he was elevated to
the responsible post of first low comedian, at a weekly salary of twenty-five shillings. There he played with the celebrated
Mrs. Nesbitt, Mrs. Honey, and many other leading stars. From the Richmond Theatre he went to the Queen’s Theatre,
London, and appeared before its footlights with Elton, Johnstone, Green, and George Wild, as well as other leading actors.
When the season terminated, Mr. W. J. Hammond engaged him for Doncaster, Sheffield, and the Strand Theatre, London.
Relinquishing the violin, he played as first low comedian in York, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast, and Dublin,
when he sang one song 250 times in succession. Having risen in the profession, and acquired a sound reputation as an actor,
he determined on visiting Australia, and arrived by the ship “Templar” in Sydney, on March 10, 1813. He offered the
services of himself and wife to Messrs. Wyatt and Knight, proprietors of the Victoria Theatre, at a salary of £ls a week,
was refused. He then proposed that the managers should first take then expenses fiom the receipts, and that the
balance be equally divided. This was eagerly accepted, and the success of the Coppin engagement was so great that instead
of £ls a week, Mr. Coppin frequently received £6O a night, and never less than £25 a night.
As the field for star engagements was limited, he commenced business as a publican, but his inexperience of the trade
robbed him of his money, and he again took to his old profession by accepting a star engagement at Hobart Town, which
provided him with sufficient funds to undertake the management of a theatre at Launceston, where he had a veiy successful
season. He then engaged, on May 30th, 1815, the whole of his company, including Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Mr, and Mrs.
Charles Young (now Mrs. Hermann Vezin), a portion of the Howson family, and many other well-known performers, whom he
brought over to the Queen’s Theatre, Melbourne, in the schooner “ Swan.” In those days the theatre-going population was
far from numerous, the Queen’s Theatre during the year 1815 being open only three nights in the week. Unable to make


terms with Mr. John Thomas Smith, he engaged the large room at the Royal Hotel for the purpose of converting it into a
theatre, which had the effect of bringing about an arrangement for each company to play two nights a week. Mr. Coppin s
first bill in Melbourne, June 21st, 1845, was “The Lady of Lyons”—Dance, by Mrs. C. Young ; song, Mr. G. H. Rogers;
comic song, Mr. Hambleton; dance, “Tarantella,” Mr. and Mrs. C. Young; comedy, “The Four Sisters;” double Irish
Jig, Mr. and Mrs. C. Young; farce, “The Turnpike Gate ; ” Mr. Coppin appearing as “Glavis,” “Captain Beauchamp, and
“ Crack.”
In August, 1846, Mr. Coppin left Melbourne for Adelaide, where he built a theatre in the remarkably short period of
five weeks, and had a most successful season. He again entered into hotel business, and was this time more fortunate, as he
made a large sum of money. He built a large hotel and kept some first-class racehorses, was instrumental in establishing the
British and German Hospital, gave his attention to public affairs, and speculated heartily in mining shares. Mr. Coppin,
with well nigh the adult population of South Australia, left that colony on the discovery of gold in Victoria, where he became
an unsuccessful digger, and ultimately returned to the stage. After having had a very profitable engagement, he received an
advantageous offer of partnership which he accepted. When he fulfilled the conditions upon which it was made, an
arrangement was effected with his creditors in Adelaide, who cheerfully agreed to his proposals; and accordingly in
1852 he entered on the management of the Geelong Theatre.
In a short time Mr. Coppin, owing to the success attending this undertaking, was in a position to discharge all his
liabilities, and in January, 1854, he retired from business with a competency, and paid a visit to England. Ambitious to test
his talent, he offered his services gratuitously to the leading London managers, but failing to have them accepted, he rented
the Haymarket Theatre for one night, and on June 26, 1854, played the principal role in the “ Mayor of Navarre,” and
appeared as “Crack” in the “ Turnpike Gate.” The London Press criticised his performances in the most flattering manner,
and as “The Australian Comedian ” he accepted numerous starring engagements.
His success as a professional was unquestionable, but not being entirely satisfied, he engaged poor G. V. Brooke with
other artists, and built an iron theatre in Manchester for erection in Melbourne, which he reached on December 18, 1854, and
commenced a star engagement at his old theatre, the Queen’s. He next erected the Olympic Theatre, took G. V. Brooke into
partnership, and purchased the Theatre Royal and Cremorne Gardens, upon which a sum of £lOO,OOO was expended. In
February, 1859, his partnership with Brooke was dissolved. Another reverse of fortune through his unsuccessful
speculations induced him to visit America with Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean, who had at that time terminated their Australian
engagement, under Mr. Coppin’s management, by which he was enabled to pay his creditors. We may here mention that at
a public banquet in Richmond upon his departure from the colony Mr. Coppin was the recipient of a cheque for £3OO, which
was to go to the support of his wife and family, until he would be able to remit money to them. After two years’ absence he
returned to Australia, joined the management of the Theatre Royal, purchased his partner’s interest in it, but, unfortunately, a
fire at the end of the first twelve months broke out on the stage, and eompletely gutted the building, which was not insured.
Undaunted, Mr. Coppin accepted tenders for the erection of a new Theatre Royal, which he afterwards put into a company,
holding a half interest in it himself. This theatre was opened in November, 1872, and has been attended with great success.
Mr. Coppin has erected six theatres in the Australian colonies, and has made Victorians familiar with upwards of two hundred
artists, many of whom in their respective professions have been recognised as leaders. Public affairs have occupied a good
deal of Mr. Coppin’s time. Richmond municipality elected him twice as its chairman, a position which he occupied
for two years, and lastly he was appointed a territorial magistrate. To him is due a reform in the Municipal Act
which he originated at a banquet he gave to upwards of one hundred representatives of municipalities. In September, 1858,
he defeated the sitting member, and was elected to represent the South Western Province in the Legislative Council.
The Torrens Act, whereby the transfer of real property is simplified, and the Post Office Savings Bank Act, were
introduced by him. After five years’ Parliamentary work he resigned his seat, as he was leaving the colony. In 1874 he was
elected member of the Legislative Assembly for East Melbourne. Confederation of the Australian colonies was warmly
advocated by him, and he supported the question of a uniform tariff with intercolonial free trade. He opposed payment of
members, and distributed his Parliamentary salary of £3OO a year for charitable objects. His refusal to canvass or spend
money in committees lost him his seat at the next general election.
Mr. Coppin contested Colliugwood, in the interests of the Constitutional party, and although defeated by Mr. Mirams
he number of votes he received Lorn the most democratic and protectionist constituency in the colony was considered so
satisfactory that he was promised the party vote at the next election in 1880. Mr. Coppin announced himself for the
Melbourne Province in the Legislative Council, claiming the promised vote of the Constitutional party. A split, however,
had taken place, the vote was divided, and Mr. Coppin was not returned. A testimonial was presented to him, very largely
signed, with an amount of money to cover the cost of the election. In 1883 Mr. Coppin returned to his old constituency of
East Melbourne, opposing the sitting member, and the feeling of resentment at the manner in which he had been treated
was so strong—having made so many sacrifices in the interests of the Constitutional party—that he was returned at the
head of the poll by a large majority. In 1886 he was again returned at the head of the poll, after which he visited England.
Whilst there he obtained valuable information upon sanitary matters, and brought about a reunion of old colonists,
which resulted in a handsome contribution to the funds of the Melbourne Association.


He joined the Order of Oddfellows at the early age of nineteen, and is still a member of the Manchester Unity. He
founded the “ Wandering Minstrel ” Lodge in Sydney, and has also been an active Freemason. He re-established the Scotch
Lodge in Adelaide ; founded and was first Master of the United Tradesmen's Lodge at Geelong, where he was presented with
a hundred-guinea testimonial by that body; and, through his efforts, an encampment of the Knights Templars in Victoria was
formed. He was also elected M.W. Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Victoria, re-elected for three years, being the limit of
oilice under the book of constitutions. He is the founder of the Victorian Humane Society, the Dramatic and Musical
Association, and the Old Colonists Association ; the Founder’s Cottages of the “Home” of the two last-named institutions
being erected by him, and endowed with £lOOO each. He is also the founder of the Gordon Institute for Poor and Neglected
Boys, and established the Gordon Cadet Corps Brass Band. The excellent manner in which these boys played after eighteen
months’ training enables them to visit the benevolent institutions every Saturday afternoon to cheer the inmates- Our
Improved Dwellings and Model Lodging House was established by Mr. Coppin, who purchased the land for £BOOO, and
undertook the entire risk of the movement until it was formed into a company. Turkish baths and skating rinks were
introduced by him, while his numerous professional engagements and active attention to charitable institutions do not
prevent him from being one of the directorate of the Commercial Bank and of the British and Tasmanian Iron Mines.
In May, 1874, he obtained a reduction in the Yan Yean water rates by one-third.
He was the first chairman of the Richmond Free Dispensary; vice-chairman of the Old Colonists’ Association;
chairman of the Ocean Amphitheatre Company, the Continental Hotel Company, the Purveyor’s Association, the Dramatic
and Musical Association, and the Sorrento Steam Navigation Company, by which he was able to obtain for the recreation of the
people the great boon of cheap excursions down Hobson’s Bay on the steamship “ Golden Crown,” introduced through him to
Victorian waters. He has given much time to acclimatisation, and not only had the first lions born in Victoria, but also
introduced the “ ship of the desert,” and that lovely songster, the English thrush. In public life he commands the esteem
of the community, and in private life he is the beau ideal of hospitality.
GEORGE CARMICHAEL was born July 7, 1821, at Abington, Lanarkshire, and arrived in the colony in March, 1839.
He was appointed a territorial magistrate in 1864, and was sworn in in the month of January, 1865. At this time he resided
at Retreat Station, Glenelg River, near Casterton. Mr. Carmichael was returned at the head of the poll, at the first election
of members of the Glenelg Road Board, and was chosen Chairman of the same, which he continued to hold until the Board
was declared a shire, when he was elected to be its President. This position he held until July, 1868, when he resigned from
ill-health, and removed to Geelong with his family. On the eve of his departure the members of the Glenelg Shire Council,
over whom he had so long and so faithfully presided, presented him with a testimonial handsomely illuminated and
embossed, which expressed in the most complimentary terms the deep regret experienced at the cause of his resignation.
DAVID OGILVY, born on January 14, 1804, at Edinburgh, was admitted in 1832 a member of the Society of Writers
to Her Majesty’s Signet in Scotland, and appointed Notary Public by the Court of Council and Session in the year 1836. He
arrived in the colony, or what was then known as the Port Phillip settlement, in December, 1839, and was admitted in the
year 1840, as Attorney, Solicitor, and Proctor of the Supreme Court of the colony of New South Wales. In the same year he
was elected and ordained an Elder of the Scots’ Church, Melbourne, and in 1855 became an Elder of Chalmers’ Church
congregation. In 1854, he was appointed Treasurer to the congregation of the latter church, and had the honor of being the
first President of the Law Institute of Victoria in 1859. He was appointed a member of the Denominational Board of
Education for the colony in the year 1848, and continued to act as such till the year 1862, when the Board dissolved. He
was one of the Trustees of the General Cemetery for the City of Melbourne from 1853 till 1863, when he resigned office on
the occasion of leaving the colony to visit England. In 1857, he was elected member of the Committee of the Melbourne
Orphan Asylum, and thereafter annually acted as such, except during the years 1863-64, when absent from the colony. He
was elected member of the Committee of the Deaf and Dumb Institution in the year 1866, and thereafter annually. He was
elected in 1867 to the office of Treasurer to the same Institution, which he held until his death, which took place at Portman
Square, London, on July 17, 1871. He was elected member of Committee of the Asylum for the Blind in the year 1866, and
annually thereafter. He was appointed a Commissioner of Savings Banks for the colony in the year 1864, and was elected a
member of the local committee of South Yarra School in the year 1868. He was elected a member of the first Council of the
Old Colonists’ Association in the year 1869, and in the same year was chosen as its Treasurer.
The only record of Mr. THOMAS REED in the Registration Book is the following extract from the Musical World
(London), July 14, 1849 ; —“ Haymarket Theatre.—The members of the orchestra presented to Mr. T. Reed, on Saturday last,
a handsome ring, as a memorial of their respect and attachment on his quitting the theatre for Port Phillip after a service of
thirty years.” Mr. Reed was born at Spitesfield, England, on February 11, 1795; arrived in the colony in November, 1849 ;
carried on business in Melbourne as music seller and estate agent; and died in June, 1871.
PETER NETTLETON was born at Ossett, Yorkshire, May 10, 1824, was brought up as a worker in wool, and learnt
the trade of woollen cloth maker. He left his native place on February 17,1849, to join the emigrant ship “ Caroline Agnes,”
Captain Alexander, then lying at Deptford, and bound for Port Phillip. He sailed from Deptford on February 23, 1849, and
arrived at Geelong on June 30, 1849, after a long but very pleasant passage. From Geelong he came to Melbourne, and


obtained work in a fellmongery, where he remained until the discovery of gold in 1851. Like most of the population of those
days, he went to Forest Creek in November, 1851, where he met with fair success as a digger. In 1853 he purchased land at
the eastern end of Simpson’s Hoad, and carries on business as fellmonger and wool merchant.
GEORGE DORAN was born in Maryport, Cumberland, on March 3, 1819. He arrived in South Australia in 1839,
and commenced to trade to the colony of Victoria in 1848, subsequently commanding the barque “ Margaret,” and the brig
“ Louisa,” both of which were his own vessels. In 1853, he established the first steam communication to the westward, viz.,
to Warrnambool, Belfast, and Portland, in the steamer “ Manchester.” He also commanded the steamers “ Keira,’’
“ Collier,” “ Queen,” and “ Fenella and on December 27,1855, while master of the “ Queen,” performed the heroic act of
rescuing about 470 persons, and saving the mails, from the Royal mail ship “ Schomberg, Captain Forbes, which was
wrecked at Curdie’s Inlet, forty miles to the west of Cape Otway. For this deed the Government gave him the sum of £2OO,
and the Chamber of Commerce presented him with a snuff-box and subscription. Mr. Doran became a civil servant in the
Harbor Department, and in 1870 was Assistant Harbour Master, Hobson’s Bay, and Pier Master, Sandridge. Mr. Doran was
the first person in the colony of Victoria to pass an examination of competency as a master mariner, his certificate being
marked No. 1. Since 1853 he held an exemption certificate from pilotage. He was also one of Mr. Khull’s Board of
Underwriters, before there were any regular Marine Insurance Companies in the colony. He married in South Australia in
184G, and at the date of giving these particulars of his life (in 1870) had two sons living—George Doran, born on February
17, 1849; and Charles James Doran, born April 18, 1851; both of them being natives of South Australia.
The Hon. GEORGE WARD COLE, M.L.C., for the Central Province, was born at Lumley Castle, Durham, in
November, 1793. He entered the navy in October, 1807, as volunteer on board the “ Lark,” 18 guns (Captain Robert
Nicholas), which was placed on the Jamaica station, and there he soon attained the rating of midshipman. He subsequently
served in various vessels, and in 1815 attained the rank of lieutenant. In December, 1814, he had the command, with the
rank of acting-lieutenant, of the “ Destructive” gun vessel. He was concerned in the expedition against New Orleans, and
was slightly wounded during a serious conflict, which resulted in the capture, by the British, of five American gunboats. In
March, 1815, he was confirmed in the rank of lieutenant, when he returned to England in the “ Wasp” sloop (Captain John
Fisher). During the two following years Mr. Cole served in the West Indies on board the “ Primrose,” 18 guns (Captain C.
G. R. Phillot); the “ Pique,” 36 guns (Captains J. H. Tait and John M'Kellar); and the “Active,” 38 guns (Captain P.
Casteret). While in the “ Primrose,” on her passage from England to Jamaica, Mr. Cole intrepidly plunged overboard, and,
at the risk of his own life, saved that of one of the crew. In October, 1817, he retired from the service on half-pay. He was
promoted subsequently to the rank of commander, his seniority dating from December 7, 1873. Captain Cole afterwards
engaged in various mercantile pursuits, and in 1839 he came to Port Phillip. Here he found ample employment for his
active mind. He entered upon the business of a merchant, shipping agent, and bonded storekeeper. He had not been in
Melbourne long before he was honored with several public appointments. In 1851 he built the “ City of Melbourne,” the
first steamship constructed in the colony. In 1842 he bought the land on the north bank of the Yarra, on which now stands
Cole’s Wharf. In 1863 he introduced sugar-beet into the colony, having received a supply of the best seed from Holland, which
he distributed freely. In 1853, on Mr. Turnbull resigning his seat for Gippsland, he was elected as its member in the old
Legislative Council, for which he sat until 1855, when an intended visit to England led to his resignation. On his return, in
1859, he was elected to represent the Central Province in the Legislative Council, in succession to Mr. John Hood, who had
resigned. The following year he was re-elected without opposition, and, in 1870, when his ten years’ seat was vacated by
effluxion of time, he was again re-elected. In politics he was an advocate of protection, and wrote several pamphlets in support
of that principle. He was always in favour of borrowing money for reproductive works, and was amongst the earliest
supporters of a harbour trust. The defences of Victoria received special attention from him; he was a member of more than
one Defence Commission, and published pamphlets advocating the use of gunboats and the establishment of a gunpowder
manufactory. In 1867 he was appointed an Executive Councillor ; he represented the M‘Culloch Government for some time
in the Legislative Council, and during the political struggle when the “ Darling Grant” deadlock occurred, he was aM‘Cullochite.
He died at his residence, Bay-street, North Brighton, at the advanced age of 86. Captain Cole married twice ; issue, seven
children, two of whom survive him; three died young; his eldest son, a fine, promising young man, was drowned by the
upsetting of a boat in Hobson’s Bay, on January 1, 1846 ; and Farquhar McCrae Cole died a fortnight after his father.
GEORGE GILMORE was born at Bristol, England, in the year 1816, and left that port for Australia on the fifteenth day
of June, 1841, in command of the iron paddle steamship “ Shamrock,” arriving at Sydney, N.S.W., on October 15th of the same
year. In the month of January, 1842, she was despatched to Moreton Bay, for the purpose of conveying supplies to the
flockmasters and their men, who had taken up stations on the Darling Downs. This mission was successfully accomplished,
and the goods and stores were landed at the penal settlement, situated on the north side of the Brisbane River. The first
clip of wool from the Darling Downs flocks was shipped in the “ Shamrock,” and conveyed to Sydney.
In the month of February, 1842, the Governor, Sir George Gipps, embarked in the “Shamrock” at Sydney, and
proceeded to Moreton Bay. On arrival at the penal settlement situated on the Brisbane River, Sir George Gipps landed on a
small jetty, and, in the presence of his staff, consisting of Colonel Burney, R.A., Mr. Parker, Mr. Merreweather,


Lieutenant Gorman of the 80th Regiment, and a guard of soldiers, a few squatters, and a number of naked aborigines, His
,xce ency gave notice that Moreton Bay was no longer a penal settlement, that the convicts were to be removed to Sydney
and that the Crown lands would be put up for sale. “ God save the Queen.” This was the beginning of the now important
colony of Queensland. In the winter of the year 1842 the “ Shamrock ” anchored in Hobson’s Bay, and was the first iron
vessel m the Port Phillip waters. For many years from that period, the “ Shamrock ” continued to make monthly voyages
between Sydney, Melbourne, and Tasmania, and was the only means of steam communication between those places.
When the separation of the colony of Victoria from New South Wales took place, Mr. Charles La Trobe, who was
superintendent for many years of the province of Port Phillip, took passage to Sydney in the “ Shamrock,” and in that city
received rom Sir Charles Fitzroy, the Governor of New South Wales, his commission as Governor of the colony of Victoria.
His Excellency Governor La Trobe returned in the “ Shamrock” to Melbourne, and on leaving the vessel a salute of
19 guns was fired, with flags flying and crew cheering. The commander of the “ Shamrock” had, therefore, the honor of
sailing the ship which brought the first Governor of Victoria to the colony, and of his ship firing the first salute in Port
Phillip waters.
Mr. Gilmore commanded the “ Shamrock ” eleven years on the coast of Australia—from the time of her leaving
England, in the year 1841, until after the discovery of gold in the colony of Victoria, in 1851.
The original intention, when compiling an account of “ The Old Colonists’ Association,” was to have given the date
of the arrival of all those members who reached the colony prior to the 23rd November, 1855, as it would have proved
interesting to our readers; but owing to some of the members having failed to record that event in the book kept for the
purpose, the project had to be abandoned.
JOHN MURCHISON, in a letter to the Secretary of the Old Colonists’ Association, dated Kew, 17th July, 1879,
writes as follows:—“As promised, Ido myself the pleasure of sending you a photo., taken about two years ago. I was
at that time eighty. In the event of the Society taking notice of a man’s early life, mine has not been without interest.
I joined the Ist Royal Scots’ Regiment in 1813 as a volunteer, under the patronage of the Duke of Kent, who was
colonel of the regiment; and was at Brussels during the eventful Waterloo, but was not in front. I joined the Scotch
Fusilier Guards in 1818, and subsequently, on the augmentation in 1824, I joined the 96th Regiment; was in the West
Indies, America; and finally quitted the army and came to New South Wales in 1833, having received a grant of land for
my services. In 1838 I came overland to Victoria, and I believe I was the first “ overlander ” who drove a tandem and pair
of horses into Melbourne. I took up a station on the King Parrot Creek, where I remained for nearly thirty years. lam
now an old man, living in comparative comfort and happiness with my daughters (five) and one son; and there are
thirty-five grandchildren and two great grandchildren, all in Australia. * * * Very truly yours, Jno. Murchison ”
The handwriting of this letter will vie with any caligraphy we have ever seen, by means of its elegance, regularity,
and firmness.

LEAVES EEOM THE DIAEY OF AN OLE
BENDIGONIAN OF 1853.
GEORGE E. THOMPSON, Esq., Sandhurst.
sudden influx of population to these shores occasioned by tlie discovery of gold was not regarded very
<#*l favourably by the older settlers, whose first experience was an abnormal rise in the cost of all the necessaries
of life, accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the value of labor. The towns and stations, both here and in
the neighbouring colonies, were rapidly denuded of all the able-bodied males. The Government employes, merchants,
clerks, citizens and station hands, all alike smitten with the gold fever, were off to the diggings ; old men, women and
children cnly remained. Thus the whole machinery of society was suddenly thrown out of gear. Vessels arriving
in the bay were immediately abandoned by their crews ; labor to discharge cargo was not to be had. Ships lay at
anchor for weeks and months with their captains and an occasional hand or two, too timorous to venture inland, only
in charge. Melbourne itself, then only a mere hamlet, gave but little promise of the wondrous future. The site
where Parliament House and the Government Offices now stand was a tract of waste land more dangerous to cross
after nightfall than even the roads to the diggings. Collins-street West, beyond King-street, was covered with stumps
of trees, and emigrants pitched their tents where the central railway station now is. Fifteen years had only intervened
since Batman and Fawkner contended for the honor of founding this, the “ Queen city of the south. The
settlement had made but little progress, and during that short period had suffered a severe commercial crisis. lor
a while the public affairs of the colony were conducted by officials appointed from Sydney, assisted by a council,
partly composed of nominees of the Crown, with a few members elected by the citizens of Melbourne, Geelong, and
the freeholders in other towns. This arrangement had not been in existence twelve months when the gold discovery
convulsed this small community like an earthquake. The whole annual revenue at the disposal of the infant state
was £20,000, which included £6OOO under the head of public worship. The Governor's salary was £2000; the
presiding judge of the Supreme Court, £l5OO. The salaries of the Attorney-General and Crown Solicitor, and the
contingent and miscellaneous expenses of the administration of justice throughout the colony, was covered by the
modest sum of £5,000. Melbourne and Geelong were the only two communities possessed of the advantages
of local self-government.
Towards this small section of the human family the attention of the whole civilised world was suddenly
turned. Ships from all quarters of the globe daily vomited their living freight by hundreds and thousands. All
the ordinary channels of industry were forsaken. The mechanic, laborer and domestic servant were alike affected.
All the enterprising spirits were bound for the diggings. If new arrivals tarried in Melbourne, it was for a short
period only, until a sufficient sum was realised to cover the expenses of the journey inland. The disparity between the
sexes was great even before this sudden invasion. It was now greater than ever. Men had been largly employed in
the performance of those household duties which are usually alloted to females. Labor was so much in demand that
those who sought it demanded and readily obtained £1 per diem. Skilled operators, when their services were
indispensable, asked and were paid whatever they chose to exact. They were masters of the situation. Ihe earnings on
the goldfields were said to average an ounce of gold a day. Certain it was that those who were lucky far exceeded
this amount, large as it was reported to be. The salaries of Government officials, even of the highest grade,
scarcely amounted to so much. The clergy, professional men, et hoc genus omne, saw with envy the lucky digger-
return to Melbourne after a few weeks of absence with pounds weight of gold, which he proceeded “to knock down ”
with the same prodigality which usually characterises men on whom fortune suddenly bestows her favors. The bags
of gold-dust were scattered as quickly as obtained, and the digger again turned his face towards the goldfields with
the confident assurance of again replenishing his store.


The effect of this lavish display of wealth so easily obtained rendered the prospects of hiring labor of any
description impossible, except at most extravagant rates, if at all. High dignitaries were reduced to the necessity
of grooming their own horses, blacking their boots, and doing other menial offices, while their wives and daughters
had the performance of all the household requirements forced upon them.
Hence a feeling of antagonism speedily developed between the settled classes of the colony and these nomads,
who had occasioned this unexampled state of affairs. The Legislative authority was entirely in the hands of the
former, and they were the present sufferers. The costs of the necessaries of life were trebled and quadrupled, while
the exchequer speedily became exhausted. Salaries of the Government officials fell greatly in arrear. In this dilemma
the Governor and Legislative Council hit upon an expedient which, whatever else might be said of it, possessed the
character of simplicity. Licenses were issued, and every resident on the goldfields was required to pay 30s. per month
for the privilege of doing so, whether engaged in digging or not. In fact, even while in transitu all who came within
the boundaries of a proclaimed goldfield were liable to this impost. Medical men, storekeepers, visitors out of
curiosity, carriers, drovers of stock —in fact, every male, and at one period it was held every female, was liable to this
charge if found within the limits of a gold-bearing district. The only exception allowed was, 1 believe, to Government
officials and clergymen of the established churches actually so engaged. This tax, obnoxious as it was in practice, was
not altogether unreasonable in theory. The large influx of strangers in search of the gold had imposed additional
burthens on the very limited revenues of the State, which were derived from the sale of Crown lands and duties levied
upon spirits and tobacco. The first, except in the immediate neighborhood of the towns, and which required to be
surveyed before being offered, and no surveyors being obtainable, had almost ceased, while the latter fell far short of
exigencies of the Government in maintaining an adequate staff of officials and police to protect life and property
amongst the heterogeneous crowd daily disembarking on these shores.
The influx was at first disastrous to all settled industries. The enormous good afterwards resulting was not then
apparent. The gold unquestionably belonged to the State, and to that portion of it represented by the Sovereign.
Many of those who came to possess themselves of it were aliens, and the whole were too numerous to be resisted. In
addition to this California furnished a precedent, a similar policy having been there resorted to. The revenue would be
immediate and the returns large, while it afforded a partial check to the exodus that threatened such serious
consequences. The law officers of the Crown contended that the impost was in the nature of a rent, which the State had
the right to exact for the territory occupied by the miner from which he expected to obtain the treasure he was seeking.
If he disliked the conditions he need not accept them, and might employ his labor and energies in other pursuits. This
was a plausible argument, and, had the Government resorted, which they afterwards did, to the expedient
of levying a duty on the gold obtained, it would more nearly have approached that definition, and might have been easily
collected, and more profitable, while less oppressive, and might have continued on the statute book even to the present
day, it in reality presenting no greater objections than any other form of taxation, and much less than some against
which no opposition has been offered. But that it partook more of the nature of a tax than of rent is plainly obvious.
It was, in fact, a capitation tax of the most objectionable character, imposed alike upon men who engaged in search
for gold and upon those who did not and never intended to do. The professional man, artisan, storekeeper, auctioneer,
carrier, and every resident, however temporary his sojourn on the goldfield might be, was amerced. Alike, men who took
no share in the golden lottery were expected to contribute equally with those who did. The artisan, tradesmen, their
employes, and others who followed their different avocations, were subject to an oppressive tax from which the
same men dwelling in towns were exempt. The occupation of a piece of waste land 16 x 10 on which to pitch a tent
was rather dear at £lB per annum, to say the least of it. Even when exacted from the persons actually engaged in
mining, there was but little to be urged in its favor and much to be said against it. The returns of labor so employed
were then, as they have ever been, extremely precarious. The average earnings of the diggers were reputed to amount to
an ounce per diem, and possibly they did not fall far short of that estimate, but fortune’s favors were very unequally
distributed. Those who were lucky netted fabulous amounts for a few weeks’labor. Others there were who toiled for
months, hardly able to win the bare necessaries of life, but all were taxed alike, the impost to the successful was a
mere bagatelle; to the unsuccessful compliance with the law was an impossibility. It was a direct tax of the most
obnoxious kind, and enforced in the most oppressive form. Periodically a raid was made by troopers on horseback and
a posse of police on foot, all armed with pistols and swords or muskets and bayonets. “ A digger hunt,” as it was
termed, ensued, and woe betide the unhappy wight who failed to produce his license. No excuse availed him. He
was run out of the gully or off of the hill on to the road, where a picked of armed men, under the command of a mere
boy called a commissioner, and distinguished by a gold-laced cap, but whose lips and chin were as innocent of hair as
were those of Bailey, junior, when he requested Poll Tweedlepipe to go on tip-toe over the pimples. The men thus
trapped, as it was termed, were marched through the diggers for hours, while others were being caught and added to the
number, which not unfrequently amounted to fifty or seventy stalwart men in the prime of life. The hunt finished for
the day by marching the unfortunates to the camp, there to be detained in the lock-up for ten days, unless the fine of


five pounds for being without a license is paid in the interim. Direct taxation has never been popular with the English
people from the days of the Plantagenet king, when the Kentish blacksmith, in his righteous indignation, felled the
collector with a blow of his hammer. From the enforced “benevolence” of the Tudors, the “hearth money” of the
Stuarts, down to the income tax of the present day, all alike have been regarded with aversion, but none of these were so
radically vicious as the digging license of the early goldfield days. The wonder is that it was long and so patiently
submitted to.
Another source of extreme irritation to the miners was the prohibition with reference to the sale of spirits and
fermented liquors on the goldfields. Stringent as the law was, it failed in effecting its object. Human appetites cannot
be restrained by Acts of Parliament, of which fact a very cursory knowledge of mankind ought to convince the
unprejudiced. Although the law was unsuccessful in attaining the objects for which it was framed, it was admirably
calculated to exasperate those whom it was intended to control, and to create a bitter feeling of antagonism towards the
authorities. The privations that had to be endured were considerable—the digger life was little better than that of a
soldier during a campaign, and prejudicially affected the most robust constitutions. There was a total absence of fresh
vegetable diet; water was both scarce and bad. Diarrhoea, typhoid—or, as it was then known by name, colonial fever-
scurvy and ophthalmia, were alarmingly prevalent. In sickness there was no attendance procurable, save the rough and
impatient sympathy of men, and those in most cases were but very recent acquaintances, rarely extending beyond a three
months’ knowledge acquired on board ship. Under these conditions the system gradually fell into a morbid state not
exactly amounting to sickness, but producing an irresistible craving after those things which it had been formerly
accustomed to; and how strong this unnatural appetite became was proved by the exorbitant prices paid for them.
Amongst the foremost was alcohol in some shape, and in cases of dysentery or diarrhoea often the only remedy procurable.
The old allegory of the forbidden fruit was exemplified on an extended scale. The scrupulous and conscientious trader,
fearful of breaking the law, abstained from meddling with it, but these were only a few. The more adventurous preferred
to run the risk rather than lose custom, and trust to good luck and diplomacy to escape through the meshes of the law
without sustaining much damage. This was the case with the general dealer, whose whole slock was in peril of
confiscation on a conviction being obtained against him. Another class of trader, however, there was who dealt in the
contraband solely. With them neither flag or sign disclosed what business was carried on by them. They had a rather
superior class of tent —the Fronta Curtain—which always down, but never fastened, seemed to indicate where the article
was obtainable. In fact, the neighbouring storekeepers, unwilling to incur the risk attendant on the trade, were
content to recommend their less scrupulous neighbours in the vicinity, who, having no stock liable to seizure on the
premises to a value of more than a score of pounds at one time, were prepared to supply what was required. It is hardly
necessary to state that the storekeeper who on principle did not sell was occasionally the sleeping partner of the man in
the tent close by, “ who, poor fellow, had a sick wife, or who had met with an accident that prevented his working,” but
whom the proprietor of the larger establishment believed did a little in that way, and was seemingly “ a very decent,
respectable kind of body.” “ Still he did not approve of sly grog selling, but there were occasions when a little of the
‘ right sort ’ was very necessary.” He knew it himself from experience, and his countenance did not belie the assertion.
There have been, and doubtless will be, “ Tom Truepennies ” in the community who do many things in the way of
business, and are not over curious respecting the affairs of their neighbours. But it was in the carriage of the
prohibited article from Melbourne to its destination on the goldfields that the true genius of the contrabandist was
displayed. “ Nanty Ewarts ” were as numerous as the “ Truepenniesthe risks and excitements had as many charms for
them as the profits had for the “ Truepennies.” Many and varied were the expedients resorted to by the teamsters, who
risked horses, dray, harness and cargo, with a fine of £SO to boot, if detected in the act of conveying the prohibited
commodity. A very common practice was to collect the names of those possessed of licenses, and bring a number of
two-gallon kegs containing spirits, addressed to the various persons whose names had been previously given them, as
if they were simply executing a commission with which they had been entrusted, parcels of these dimensions not
coming within the legal restrictions. If their cargo were overhauled in transitu , out came the list of the alleged
customers by whom orders had been given, which, however, did not always succeed in allaying the suspicions of the over
zealous constable, and a visit to the camp, and a detention until the goods were claimed, was sometimes the result.
Amusing instances of this transparent manoeuvre occurred on several occasions on the field. On one occasion some forty
kegs and a pile of cases occupied the floor of the police court, but the delinquent was equal to the emergency. His
customers were outside the tent (for the majesty of the law had no better accommodation in those days), and on the
case being called on, in crowded the claimants, answered to their names, showed their licenses, replied satisfactorily to
the questions put to them, by picking out the particular parcel by name addressed, to the great discomfiture of the
officials, who evidently felt the carrier had proved one too many for them. Another mode of evasion was also successfully
practised. Brewers’ casks were greatly in request on the diggings for puddling purposes, commanding a ready sale
at high prices. They were also the most efficient protection to any description of goods packed in them against the
perils of a protracted journey over a country entirely destitute of either roads or bridges. The cask alone was good


freight, and if filled with other commodities became a parcel of very considerable value. Nothing bore the cost of
carriage better than alcohol. The centre was therefore used for the storage of lesser vessels containing this article, while
the spare space was filled in with the coarser kind of clothing, or with groceries, oats, salt, in fact anything that would
injure by exposure to the weather, saleable on the goldfields, thus battling the curiosity of the police, even where a gimlet
was inserted or the bung taken out. But of all devices the old Roman difficulty “ Inas costas insos custodies ” proved
eventually the most efficient; the reply to interrogations as to what the cargo consisted of was satisfactory if the
answer came, “ The loading is for Mr. Melbourne Merchant’s store, Kangaroo Flat or White Hills,” or some other descriptive
ocality, with the production of the waybill. Persons disposed to be sceptical may call to mind the customs frauds here
and the railway cases in the adjoining colony of later days. Demoralising as this temptation to evade the law was, a
much worse one existed. Members of the police force notoriously exacted black mail for winking at the open violation of
the law by a not inconsiderable number of those engaged in the business. At the same time encouragement was given to
a class of men who have long been held in the greatest abhorrence by English communities, viz., the common informer,
and these vile tools found congenial employment. The fine on conviction for sly grog selling was fifty pounds, and the
confiscation of property in some cases to the extent of hundreds. Half the fine went to the informer. A wretch named
Mangin who commenced his career by laying information in this locality, succeeded so well that he proceeded to
Castlemaine on a similar errand, where, incredible as it may appear, the authorities, on his laying an information,
arrested the accused, and pulled down the premises before investigating the cases. One was a boarding-house, from
which some twenty occupants were turned out in an inclement night to seek shelter as best they could. The
indignation of the residents was intense, and a riot only averted by releasing the prisoners. Mangin himself was taken
in charge by the police to protect him from the fury of the mob, who for once were thoroughly aroused, and a riot appeared
imminent. At the hearing of the charges the next day the approver’s evidence broke down ; the cases were dismissed,
and Mangin, tried for perjury, was convicted and sentenced to two years. The Government partially compensated the
sufferers. Another instance of the atrocity of the law occurred here shortly afterwards in the neighbourhood of Golden
Square, resulting in the loss of life. A party of miners, while spending the evening in a store, where no doubt drinking
was indulged in, were pounced on by the police, who, surrounding the premises, demanded admission. Now, besides the
penalties to which the proprietor was subject, the persons found in the place drinking were, or supposed to be, liable
to a fine of £5 each. An unfortunate man trying to escape by the rear either fell or was knocked into a hole, where his
body was found next morning. An inquest was held, but no evidence could be obtained as to how the man met with his
death, and a verdict to this effect was found. These were possibly extreme cases, but by no means isolated ones. In an
attempt to suppress this traffic the police were in the habit of making domiciliary visits, upon no better authority than
their own instigations. A young married man, living not far from the before-mentioned neighbourhood, experienced an
outrage which, with some men of violent temperaments, would have had a similar tragic ending. The police forced their
way into his residence late at night, turned his wife out of bed, and proceeded to ransack the premises in quest of the
liquor they chose to assume was secreted there, all the time producing no warrant for the proceeding. Not discovering
what they sought, they departed without offering any apology for the outrage. The enumeration of all the instances of a
similar character would occupy much too large a space to allow room for other matters to be subsequently dealt with of
more importance in showing the great changes which have occurred in the social life on the mines since these early
days, and the efforts made to bring them about. It may be imagined that this law or Order-in-Council, regulating the
consumption of spirits and fermented liqueurs, was devised in the interests of the miners, and to better preserve order on
the goldfields. Had such been the intention it would have been excusable, and the prohibition would not have permitted
quantities of two gallons any more than parcels of larger bulk to be carried. The real fact was that the public-house
interest in the Legislature was relatively much stronger there than it has been at any subsequent period. There were
then no merchant princes in the colony The wholesale houses were but few, and bonded stores were unknown. No
large stocks were on hand. It was therefore in the interest of both importer and publican to restrict his trade as much
as possible to the large towns. The hotel-keepers had been accustomed to reap a periodical harvest from the station
hands, who at regular intervals came to town to “ knock down ” their cheques at the close of the shearing season, and now
the lucky digger was to replace him with bags of gold instead of orders on wool-brokers and merchants. There were no
banks on the diggings, and not many even in the colony, hence the bulk of the gold obtained from time to time had to be
deposited in the local treasury, and from thence forwarded to Melbourne by escort. Keeping gold in tents, however well
secreted, was a hazardous game; to sell it on the field, and carry the proceeds of the sale about, was equally so. There
were no means of investing in the vicinity, except on personal security, and that without interest, taking care of the gold
being considered sufficient “ quid pro quo ” by the obliging trader who was willing to undertake this responsibility. In
fact, the first bank established here at a later period, and to whose business the Bank of Victoria succeded, demanded
one per cent, for affording the accommodation. Hence it followed that sooner or later the successful miner found his way
to the metropolis, which at that time possessed but few houses that could by the most imaginative have been termed
hotels. Drinking bars, however, abounded, and those who would be satisfied with the humblest accommodation byway


of board and lodging were not likely to get it unless prepared to squander their gold freely. In proof of how little store it
was held in, nearly a quarter of a million in value remained unclaimed in the hands of the Government for some years,
and the bulk of it eventually passed into the general revenue.
That a state of society such as here described could ever have existed amongst an English community
governed by English law appears almost incredible; that it could exist for long was impossible. Its existence,
nevei tireless, was a fact which can be accounted for only by taking into consideration the peculiarity of the surroundings.
The dwellers on the goldfields were for the most part strangers to each other, and by this reason, incapable of any combined
action. There was no Press in the colony outside Melbourne and Geelong to criticise and expose the abuses of the
prevailing system. It had as much as it was possible for it to do to keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements
of those towns. Its appliances as regards staff, material, and plant were of the most meagre description. It, like other
interests, was affected by the unwonted scarcity of labour. The judicature existed; but to seek redress through that
channel was fraught with such difficulties, that it might as well have had no existence. The delay and expense would
inevitably prove ruinous if it were resorted to. The only channel remaining open was that of public meeting, and
to this recourse was had. On the 6th June, 1853, a few persons, thoroughly disgusted with the existing state of affairs,
assembled at the . corner of the reserve opposite to where Jackson’s buildings now are, and where his store then was.
The licensing system and the tyrannical proceedings of the camp officials were denounced in no measured terms. A
committee was appointed to draw up a remonstrance by way of petition to the Governor and Executive Council, stating the
grounds of complaint and the steps necessary for their removal. The grievances the residents had to complain of were so
numerous and so palpable that, although the license question was paramount, the movement adopted the title of the
Anti-gold License Association. The remonstrance comprised twelve distinct heads, of which the following were most
important. First, the immediate reduction of the digger’s license fee from 30s. to 10s. per month, with a provision for its
ultimate abolition, the licensee having the option of taking it out for one month or a three months’ term, as he might elect.
Second, the withdrawal of the restrictions to the sale of liquors, with the issue of a permit to deal in them to those who
chose to pay for it. Third, the immediate sale of lani in the vicinity for the formation of mining townships, and the
establishment of municipal institutions for their management. Fourth, the construction of roads and bridges between
the principal goldfields and the ports of Melbourne and Geelong. Fifth, larger sale of lands for agricultural purposes,
that men might be induced to settle in the colony, in place of taking the gold out of the country to enrich distant
communities, from which, at that time, the major portion of the food supplies were obtained. Even horse feed was
imported from such distant regions as England, India, America, and other places, by which these States were reaping a
lai-ge portion of the rich mineral resources which the colony possessed. Sixth, equal political rights for the mining population,
entitling them, in common with all other residents in the colony, to the possession of the franchise and the election of
members to sit in Parliament to represent their interests in the local legislature, which right at the time was limited to
freeholders only. Seventh, the appointment of men to the magisterial bench from the ranks of citizens, to ensure a more
impartial administration of the law, which at the time was grossly abused by some who held appointments as Government
officials. These were the principal subjects contained in the petition, which was drawn up, submitted to, and adopted by
a large meeting held on the fifth White Hill. On the 13th of the month a numerous committee was formed to carry it
into effect. A tent in immediate proximity to the camp (now Rosalind Park) was selected as a place of meeting for the
transaction of business connected with it. Funds for the expenses of a vigorous propaganda were furnished, the
contributions being mostly paid in gold-dust, money as a circulating medium being so scarce that in ordinary transactions
purchases were paid for with that metal in its uncoined state. The difficulties to be overcome in organising public
opinion were considerable. Printing presses were not available out of Melbourne or Geelong, and weeks must elapse
before the most trifling orders for printing could be executed; recourse, therefore, was had to writing. The
announcement of the intentions of the league from time to time, on sheets of brown paper, were distributed amongst the
stores in the various gullies, at which places copies of the memorial against the grievances complained of and the reforms
asked for were left for signature. Two members were appointed to address and explain to those working in the more
distant parts of the field the extent and object of the movement. The organisation of this district was rapidly achieved.
Local committees were appointed, the chairmen of which were to be members of the central body, who were to control
and direct the policy and arrange plans of action in the future. The deputies then visited the MTvor and Castlemaine
districts, both of considerable importance as mining centres in those days. A similar course of procedure was adopted in
both these places. Neither Ballarat nor the Ovens took any active part at this juncture, although parties resident there
were communicated with by letter, those districts being considered too remote for delegates to attend. At the end of
July the memorial had been signed by 23,000 people on Bendigo and at Castlemaine. MTvor also reported
eight thousand had done so in that locality. These results achieved, it was deemed advisable to lay the memorial at once
before Governor Latrobe, and to do this three of the leading men of the central committee were despatched to town, with
instructions to bring the matter under his notice, and explain the existing causes of discontent among the digging
population. The deputation started about mid-day, on 26th July, carrying the petition with them in a dog-cart, the oulv


mode of conveyance procurable. The weather was inclement, and the roads were in a wretched state, being so heavy
from the winter’s rain, that on arrival at the Porcupine, about five in the evening, a distance of only sixteen miles, a halt
for the night was made to procure saddle horses for two of the party, it being perfectly clear that the journey could not
be accomplished with the vehicle loaded as it was. The journey occupied four days, and on reaching Melbourne an
attempt was made to secure accommodation at several of the principal hotels, but on the errand of the applicants becoming
known, it was invariably refused, the proprietors alleging that their licenses might be imperilled by affording shelter to
them. At that time the licensing system in Melbourne was as bad as it could be, and only the proteges of the Licensing
Bench were likely to obtain licenses or get them renewed, that body being corrupt as well as arbitrary. In this
predicament the members of the deputation had to rely on their personal friends for a night’s shelter, and proceeded the
next day in search of accommodation among private lodging-houses. This after some delay was secured in Collins-street
east, from whence a letter was sent to the Lieutenant-Governor, stating the nature of the mission, and requesting an
appointment to consider the petition and hear the deputation as to the grievances complained of. In reply, a notification
was received, naming an hour in the forenoon of the third of August at Government House, at that time situated in
Queen-street. The delegates attended, meeting the Governor, Colonial Secretary, and Chief Commissioner of the goldfields.
The petition was presented, and the deputies heard in its support. The reply given was in effect that Government was
not inclined to make any change in the existing laws and regulations affecting the gold-fields, and the petitioners, if
dissatisfied, might quit, but the law would be enforced. Troops from Sydney were now available to compel submission.
All remonstrance proved of no avail, and the Conference terminated by the Colonial Secretary informing the deputies that
the Government considered the existing dissatisfaction solely attributable to the agitators having inflamed the minds of
the petitioners, who did not constitute, nor did they represent a majority of the residents; that many of those signing
were foreigners, who were in the colony only on sufferance, and had no right whatever to complain of the institutions of
a country upon which they had thrust themselves uninvited. If they found them not to their liking, they had their
remedy by leaving. This suggestion, if plausible, was far from practicable. The attempt to obtain any redress from
Government having failed, it was determined to enlist if possible the sympathies of the Melbourne people, and with this
view several leading citizens were interviewed. Among the number the mayor and town clerk of Melbourne, the editor
of the Argus, Messrs. O’Shannassy and Fawkner, none of whom, however, seemed disposed to regard the movement at
all favourably. Before quitting the city it was determined to hold a public meeting to explain to a larger number at
greater length the objects of the movement, and the grievances sought to be redressed, than was possible to be done by
interviewing individual citizens. Here, however, another difficulty was encountered. It was impossible to secure a large
room in any of the hotels, the proprietors alleging the same objections which had induced them to refuse to receive the
delegates into their houses as guests, namely, that they were indisposed to afford any countenance to what was regarded
by the authorities as an illegal association. An open air meeting was deemed inadvisable, as not likely to be
attended by business men or the older residents of the colony. Eventually, after considerable importunity,
Dr. Cairns, one of the trustees, promised the use of the Protestant Hall, if the Mayor of Melbourne took
the chair; this, after much persuasion, he consented to do. An announcement was published to this effect,
and many leading citizens were again applied to, requesting them to occupy the platform on the occasion.
The room was filled to its utmost capacity. The delegates explained the condition of the population
on the goldfields, and the oppressive character of the gold digger’s license, especially upon the unsuccessful
miner; that the occupation of the gold-seeker was at the best a very precarious one, the mode of raising a
revenue by the existing system alike injudicious and dangerous ; the expense of collection out of all proportion to the
amount realised, while it was in every way calculated to create an ill-feeling between the population and the authorities,
which threatened eventually to result in a rupture between them. The various other subjects dealt with in the petition
were discussed, and an opinion arrived at by the meeting, that efforts should be made to remove, as far as possible, the
grievances complained of. Already a fortnight had elapsed since the deputation had started for Melbourne, and nothing
beneficial seemed likely to result from the steps hitherto taken. Something further had, therefore, to be done if the
grievances were to be removed. Troops had arrived in Sandhurst. Information reached town that the raids on the
diggers (license hunting) prevailed to a greater extent than ever, and for the future, public meetings on the gold-fields would
not be allowed. The members of the association therefore requested the delegates to return as soon as possible, and
determine on the future course of action. It was accordingly resolved that one delegate should proceed to Ballarat, and
secure the co-operation of that section of the miners ; one should remain in town to further urge the Government to a
more favourable consideration of the question at issue ; the third to return to Sandhurst with the account that their
negotiations had hitherto proved unsuccessful. The Sandhurst man proceeded on his journey immediately, and arrived
early on the third day.
Fifteen thousand or 20,000 diggers assembled on the return of the diggers’ delegates from Melbourne; the central
committee were immediately assembled, the prospects of the movement discussed, and unanimous determination arrived
at to run all hazards rather than submit to the tyranny of Government, if the miners could be relied on, and to bring the


question to an issue before the end of the month. Meetings were again hold in all the chief centres of population, the
want of success hitherto achieved explained, and the determination of the central committee announced; this course was
very generally approved. But the temper of the miners had greatly changed in the interval. Hitherto, no inflammatory
declamations had been made, or violent language indulged in. The speaking at the meetings had been left to members
of the various committees, who rarely indulged in anything declamatory. Now the platform was largely occupied by
men who before had taken no prominent part in the movement. Armed resistance was openly talked of, and the
abvisability of procuring all the ammunition available being suggested, a demand for powder and lead sprang up. The
storekeepers were entirely cleared out of these articles, even the linings of tea chests being purchased to make into
bullets, and large orders were given for further supplies. A whole week was devoted to the work of inciting the men to
organise a determined resistance against the action threatened by the Government to maintain the existing state of
affairs by the employment of the troops concentrated on their field. Other members occupied their time in writing
placards in large letters, declaring the intention not to relax their efforts, or cease the agitation until the assurance of
the redress of grievances complained of was given. A mass meeting was summoned to assemble for the 21st of the
month, on Hospital Hill, so called from the first institution of that character being erected there. The meeting thus
convened was held, and some thousands attended. Resolutions were passed that a week from that date, namely, the
28th, a final meeting should be held at the same spot, when the tender of 10s., the amount to which the licence was
sought to be reduced, should be made to the authorities on behalf of the diggers, and a determination expressed to resist
any attempt to harass the miners by contrivances like the “diggers’ hunts,” in the effort to collect the larger amount. The
Government were buoying themselves up with the belief that they had a majority on their side, and had issued placards
inviting the well-affected to rally in support of law and order by taking out licenses at the original cost of 30s. It was
therefore deemed advisable for the adherents to wear a distinctive badge, that it might be ascertained if their opinion
was correct. A red ribbon to be worn on the hat or some other conspicuous portion of the dress was selected for this
purpose. The suggestion was approved, and the demand for every particle that could by any stretch of the imagination
pass for that colour was so large that the stock was soon exhausted. Recourse was then had to rosettes made of pieces
of red shirts to answer the like jmrpose. The result of this test of the numerical strength of the two parties astonished
even the proposers. It might be fairly estimated that ninety-five per cent, adopted this simple mode of showing their
sympathy with the movement. The storekeepers had at the commencement looked coldly on, fearful of a raid being
made on property in the event of the miners proving too strong, if a collision occurred between them and the authorities.
The feeling gradually wore away as the latter understood the character of the men who were prominent in the agitation.
The orderly conduct of the proceedings, the absence of any violent speeches, and the great stress laid upon the necessity
of abstaining from all rioting, and the prevention of any interference with property, combined with the fact that several
of the prominent leaders themselves were of the storekeeping class, eventually won their confidence. In the reply to the
invitation to take out licenses in proof of their adhesion to the existing state of affairs, less than thirty responded, and those
provisionally that their stores should have one man left in possession in case arrests for not possessing the document
were continued. Many adopted a still bolder course by writing in large letters on their canvas walls that no licenses
were taken. Copies of the resolutions, with a notice of the intended movement on the following week, were sent to the
officials, although several were present at the meeting, probably out of curiosity, but no allusion was made to them in any
way; but it was deemed advisable not to leave a possibility for the excuse that they were taken by surprise when the
tender and resolution should be formally presented, ample time being thus given to communicate with Melbourne and
obtain final instructions for their guidance. The copies of resolutions adopted at the meeting, and notice of intention to
carry them out, were very courteously received by the officials, many of whom began to think the malcontents had a
good show of reason for what they were doing. The responsibilities of enforcing the old license by the old method were
becoming clearly more and more serious, and, as was afterwards learned, they required to be very definitely instructed
as to the course they were to pursue, not feeling inclined to take upon themselves the responsibility which a collision,
resulting in loss of life, would entail, unless acting under plainly expressed orders, at the same time furnishing full
information of the threatening aspect which the subject was assuming. The messenger was informed that the papers
delivered would be forwarded to the Executive without delay, but no expression of opinion as to what policy would be
pursued could be given until an answer was returned. The committee now made preparation for the final effort.
Messages were sent to Ballarat, MTvor, and Castlemaine, stating what had been done, and what it was resolved should
be done at the following meeting, requesting that similar steps might be taken in all those places. The local committees
were informed of the intended places for mustering those who meant to attend the meeting, the fifth White Hill being one,
and the head of Kangaroo Flat the other. They were instructed to keep men known to each other as much as possible
tog ether, for which purpose, to avoid confusion, flags would be necessary, which a number of storekeepers had proposed
to lend, on the several borrowers undertaking to return them. All were requested to keep by their local committees until
they arrived at the place of meeting, and, when there, to keep to the same order as far as practicable. On the question of
coming armed or not, they were informed the Government had expressed its determination not to allow the meeting to be


held, but the lenders did not intend to retreat a single step from the position they had assumed, and it must rest with the
men themselves whether they deemed it necessary to bring arms with them or not. Should the troops and police move off
the camp and approach towards either of the processions, the miners were directed to disperse slowly without coming to a
conflict with them, but this movement on the part of the Government would be taken as a declaration of hostilities. Ihe
possibility of such an occurrence had been considered, and should it happen, means had been provided to apprise those
interested with what next step was to be taken, which information would reach them through the chairman of their local
committee. All parties were strictly enjoined not to give offence in any way, and to abstain from offering any provocation
that could be urged as an excuse for interfering with them. The whole of the central committee were actively engaged
in this work throughout the earlier part of the week, and it was hoped that every precaution had been taken, and all
probable contingencies provided for. Early on Friday, however, they were surprised by a trip from the delegates who
had remained in town, accompanied by Dr. Owens, formerly a resident on this field, but then located on the Ovens. It
appeared that people in Melbourne, both in and out of the Government, had awakened to the gravity of the situation,
and, as the Argus of the day expressed it, had despatched these men to the diggings for the purpose of exerting their
influence in allaying the existing excitement. They called at the office of the association ; two members, as usual, w'ere
present to supply any information it might be necessary to convey to the outlying districts. They were solicited to get the
committee together without delay. The visitors were informed that it had been appointed for 4 p.m., and it would be
impossible to alter the hour. Attention was urged to the serious consequences that might ensue if the meeting were
persisted in, as the Executive were determined to disperse it by force if held. It was explained that those present were
powerless in the matter. Men had already been turned off the committee during the last few days for doing on their ow r n
responsibility what had not been discussed or adopted by the other members, and were they to do what was suggested
they would surely meet a similar fate. A promise was, however, given that neither of the two would interfere in the
discussion until every member had had an opportunity of expressing his views on the subject. When the committee
met the same arguments were used over again, and a postponement of the meeting suggested until the Governor should
be again appealed to. Ncne of the members made any reply, but requested to hear the opinions of the two acting
members, who had charge of the proceedings for the day. They at once declared against the proposition as being
impracticable. A course of action had been determined on of which the diggers had approved. The committee had pledged
themselves to be at their posts to carry it through. Time did not permit of explanation that the affair was to be postponed,
and if it did the men were not in the frame of mind to entertain the proposal. The meeting was sure to assemble ; every
precaution had been taken that no provocation should be given warranting an interference on the part of the Government.
If any weakness were displayed on the part of the leaders they might exj>ect to be put aside, to use the mildest term.
Those who assembled would have cause to think those in whom they had reposed confidence were after all a set of contemptible
triflers, and being left to themselves might disregard everything they had been counselled to do. It was well-known that
some of the more violent persons thought the committee much too tame to effect the purpose at which they aimed.
Once the opinion that cowardice instead of tameness was to be ascribed to them, their influence was gone. Whatever
was the cause of it they could not now safely withdraw from the action already determined on. The committee was
unanimous not to discuss the matter any further. Those who feared for the consequences had better absent themselves from
the meeting, and thus avoid the danger they dreaded. The final arrangements for the morrow were then made. The
central committee was divided into two equal numbers, and the charge of the respective processions assigned them, the
steps to be taken in the event of a threatening demonstration by the Government determined, and the parties to make
the tender on behalf of the meeting, in case it was not interfered with, elected. This closed the business, and the whole
were enjoined to be at their allotted posts punctually by ten o’clock next morning. Both the men who had come from
Melbourne expressed dissatisfaction at the failure of their mission, but determined they would not shirk their share
of the responsibility, and as both were to sleep at the White Hills for the night, they elected to join that section in the
morning, which they did with commendable punctuality. The two processions at starting numbered about four thousand
each, and were joined as they advanced along the road by so many others, that on arriving at the place of meeting it was
estimated that between fifteen and twenty thousand were in attendance. Everything had proceeded satisfactorily, with
one exception. When the procession from the White Hills was opposite the Camp one section halted and fired a volley,
as if to challenge the officials to an encounter with them. This foolish piece of bravado might have led to serious
consequences, and was in direct opposition to the oft-repeated advices given, not to afford any pretext to the authorities to
come into collision with the people. The first act of the meeting was to condemn this uncalled-for act of folly, which
might have endangered the peaceful settlement of the question at issue by the wanton provocation offered the occupants
of the Government enclosure. Luckily, with admirable good sense, no notice was taken by them of it. The meeting
proceeded to confirm the previous resolution as to the making of the tender of the reduced license fee. Some difficulty
was experienced in selecting a reasonable number to form the deputation from the numerous volunteers who offered
themselves. It was advisable that a small party only should undertake the task. Several of the committee and
volunteers from the body of the meeting were eventually selected to the number of ten, all of whom were required to give


up their firearms before entering within the Camp fence to the care of others, who were appointed to take charge of them.
The meeting was advised that under no circumstances should any other person approach the enclosure, but wait with
patience the result of the negotiation, and the return of the delegates with the answer. It was deemed advisable that all
discussion with the Camp party should be avoided, and the business restricted to making the tender and announcing the
determination that had been arrived at by the meeting. One member of the committee was chosen to speak in that
behalf. The deputation entered the Camp ground where the Bank of Victoria now stands, and proceeded to ascend the
rising ground, on which a large party of Government officers were collected. Before proceeding many steps they were
challenged by a sentry, a number of whom were posted in a cordon extending around that spot. A halt was made, and an
officer advanced to enquire the errand they were there for, which, being explained, the deputation was permitted to
proceed. On reaching the group of officials, in reply to the interrogation of the Chief Commissioner of the goldfields, the
deputation tendered 10s. as the license fee of the future, stating at the same time the determination to pay no more. The
acceptance of this was declined, as no authority had been given him to do so. Beference was then made to the
precipitate manner in which proceedings had been forced on by the Association, allowing no opportunity for the Governor
to confer with the Legislative Council, which was not sitting when he had been appealed to. Allusion was also made to
the miners assembling with arms in their possession, and to the firing which occurred while passing in front of the Camp.
Begret was expressed for the latter, but as to the other objections, it was replied that the answer received from the
Government while waited on in Melbourne amounted to a peremptory refusal to effect any change in the law, and further
discussion was now unavailing. What the deputation desired at his hands was a notification to the authorities in
Melbourne of what now took place, at the same time giving an assurance that the meeting would quietly disperse if not
interfered with, and patiently wait the further issue of events until forced into activity by a repetition of the acts of
aggression which they had met to protest against. A promise was made that a messenger should be immediately
despatched with an account of what had taken place, and assurance given that no molestation would be offered to
the persons assembled. The deputation then withdrew to announce to the meeting what had resulted at the
interview.
The result of the interview with the officials having been disclosed, the public meeting—described previously, of
15,000 or 20,000 diggers, near where the Bank of Victoria now stands—expressed its entire satisfaction, and the miners
quietly returned to their occupations and awaited future developments. It was generally considered that the popular
party had scored a win without any recourse being had to measures that might have endangered the public peace and led
to serious consequences. The populace were naturally elated at the success achieved, and indulged in some little
conviviality in commemoration of the event; but the excitement was not greater than is often witnessed over a successful
political contest of the present day. No rioting occurred of any kind. A very general feeling prevailed that the policy
pursued by the leaders had been characterised both by firmness and moderation. Even those who were opposed to the
movement were ready to admit that their fears that a state of anarchy would result from the triumph of the popular party
were groundless. The agitation had extended over ten weeks, and no single instance had occurred of any attempt to
intimidate or coerce those who had withheld their countenance from the proceedings. Property had been as safe within
the canvas premises as if protected by more substantial buildings. Not a solitary attempt had been made to obtain any
commodity without payment. The fact was that the much-dreaded criminal class from the neighbouring colonies had
stood in awe of the consequences, dreading, as was most probable it would be, that “Lynchlaw” might be resorted to in
place of appealing to the ordinary tribunals of the colony for the suppression of crime. They had sense enough to
perceive that a resort to that summary mode of dealing with ruffianism might be adopted, as had been in California.
Proposals to establish “ vigilance committees ” had been repeatedly spoken of if the Government withdrew from the
responsibility of maintaining order on the goldfields—a proceeding which had been hinted at as the necessary outcome of
the refusal to contribute funds by submitting to the form of raising revenue by means of the license fee.
At the interview on the Camp with the officials they undertook to despatch a messenger to Melbourne to inform
the Executive of what had taken place, and explaining the alarming symptoms which the disaffection amongst the mining
population had then developed, and that the attempt to enforce the collection of the licenses would most probably end in
bloodshed. Great excitement prevailed in Melbourne, a rumor having been circulated that a collision had occurred in
which the insurgents had gained the advantage, and were besieging the Camp. The report, although perfectly groundless,
seemed to have awakened the citizens to the danger attendant upon such an occurrence taking place. The members of
the Executive Council were called together, by whom it was determined not to attempt collecting the tax for the ensuing
month, and in the meantime to take evidence as to the existence of the evils complained of, and the best method of removing
them. Notification was sent to that effect, and parties summoned from each goldfield to confer with a commission
appointed for the purpose. The witnesses were summoned from each locality, for on the occasion of the tender of the
10s. both Ballarat and the Ovens had acted in concert with the Sandhurst league; the parties selected were very fairly
chosen. Three of the known adherents of the movement and three of the residents who had held aloof from it were cited from
each field, to the number of some thirty in all. The commission was also fairly constituted, and comprised an equal number


of Government officials and members of the Legislative Council. The parties were examined separately, but there was a
general consensus of opinion that the administration on all the goldfields was vicious in the extreme, and as to the reforms
demanded by the petition, like unanimity was shown. The examination of some of the persons was very protracted, especially
those who had a hand in framing the memorial. Each demand contained in it was severely criticised, and a good deal of
astonishment manifested that a claim for equal political rights was made by the new arrivals in common with the older
residents, who had a stake in the colony by possessing freehold property, which, at this time, gave the right to the franchise.
Allusions were made to the danger of giving political power into the hands of penniless adventurers who held no stake in
the country, and the old argument was again and again reiterated that those who were dissatisfied with the institutions
might leave at once, as doubtless they intended to do eventually, if lucky enough to take with them sufficient of the
auriferous treasure of the colony to make a start in life in the countries whence they came. Much surprise was also
expressed that not a single alien had anything to do with the drawing up of the memorial, or had in fact even seen it until
read at the meeting, which adopted it; that the framers of the draft had never been out of the United Kingdom until they
sailed for these shores ; and when the answer came that what was claimed here as a right did not exist in Great Britain,
the reply was equally ready that the men coming here did so as much from dissatisfaction with the class restriction
existing in the older communities of Europe as with a desire to better their fortunes, and were of opinion that a State
could be formed on more democratic lines than existed there, with advantage to the community generally. The right to
the franchise insisted on in the petition, and which the commission would persist in calling a privilege, was the occasion
of considerable diversity of opinion. One member of the commission asked if the miners were so anxious for its
possession, what would they pay for the privilege ? The reply given was a quotation from a countryman of his own,
which closed every oration made by him, and was as significant as Cato’s “ Delenda est Gathargo ” —“ Every man a vote
and every man a musket. Let him who seeks to deprive you of the one have the contents of the other.” Allusion was
then made to the recent meetings of the league being illegal and a repetition of them would not be allowed. The witness
at once disputed this proposition by claiming that the right of meeting in public to discuss grievances and devise remedies
was as old as the English Constitution, and had never been challenged, quoting by way of illustration those held to
piocuie the passing of the Reform Bill, the Corn Law League, O’Connell’s Repeal Agitation, and the more recent Chartist
demonstrations throughout the kingdom. If the objection were to their being held in the open air, it must be remembered
that on the goldfields there was no other place in which they could be held, and even so, open air meetings were
just as legal as those held in buildings. The meetings at the hustings to nominate candidates and to announce the
result of the election were universally so held. The only prohibition that the speaker was aware of was that of holding
them within a mile of the House of Commons while sitting, and that very prohibition was proof of their legality;
otherwise, why was it made if meetings generally were illegal ? The only instance that he could call to mind where a
contrary opinion had been acted on was the dispersal of the Manchester meeting by the Yeomanry in 1819, better known
as the “ Peterloo Massacre.” He thought that none but madmen would attempt a revival of that experiment in these
times. If the last meeting held at Sandhurst were referred to, the authorities were solely to blame for what took place
there by the threats they had held out. No meetings in the three kingdoms had been nearly so orderly conducted as the
earlier meetings in the goldfields had been. As to the right to meet in the future, he opined that an Englishman carried
his political rights with him all through the British dominions, penal settlements perhaps only excepted, of which he
had no experience. If the Government were of a different opinion it would have the opportunity to test it, as a
meeting would be assuredly convened the instant the witness arrived on the diggings, and he felt confident, if cited
before the tribunals of the country for doing so, the case would be scouted out of court by any judge acquainted with the
simplest principles of constitutional law.
This witness was informed that no further information was required from him. Before retiring, however, he
produced the summons requiring his attendance, and demanded his expenses. This seemed to take the members wholly
by surprise, as no similar demand had been made by any previous witness, and the evidence offered was entirely
voluntary. Attention was drawn to the document signed by an officer of the Legislative Council commanding the
attendance, and if that command had been disregarded, it was presumed a warrant could be issued to compel the
attendance. In such case the testimony given could hardly be styled voluntary, and the witness insisted on his claim for
expenses incurred in obeying the summons. He was directed to send a detailed account to the Treasury, and the
validity of the claim would be considered. In the meantime the parties summoned from various localities had previously
arranged to meet every evening to compare notes as to the tenor of the evidence given by each witness examined, for
the instruction and guidance of those who had still to undergo that ordeal. This claim for expenses had been loosely
spoken of, but no resolution had been come to, it being deemed advisable to leave the Sandhurst representatives to take
the initiative. It was reported at the next meeting, and an agreement come to as to the amount that should be claimed
As usual when new men undertake to appraise the value of their own time and services, some very preposterous amounts
were named. Eventually, however, it was agreed that £SO per man should be claimed by all excepting the men from
the Ovens, who, it was agreed, were entitled to £75 per man. These sums appear large when considered in relation to


the present cost of travelling. But in those days the journey from Sandhurst to the metropolis by coach occupied
three days, and the fare was ten pounds. On horseback it was not much, if any, cheaper, if the use of the horse was
taken into account. Hotel expenses, compared with modern charges, were excessively high. The validity of the
claim was ultimately admitted and the amounts paid. At the same time an assurance was given that no delay would
occur in devising measures to remedy the grievances of which the goldfields residents complained, and the hope was
expressed that all occasion for a continuance of the existing excitement would be avoided while the Legislative Council
deliberated on the measures of reform which were in contemplation for the benefit of that section of the community.
This was readily promised, as a satisfactory termination of the controversy seemed to have been achieved. Unhappily,
this ultimately proved a delusion, for within fifteen months the miners at Ballarat were goaded into madness by the
obstinate adherence to the remnant of the licensing system, which it had been promised should be entirely abolished,
and a less objectionable method of raising revenue resorted to.
Doubtless, all these things would have been achieved in the fulness of time, but a commencement was necessary,
and that was made by the “ Red Ribbon agitation,” and, exorbitant as the demands then made were considered at the
time, it will now be readily conceded that every single item of the programme was essential to the progress of the colony.
It has been customary to speak of the movers in this agitation as “ stump orators,” as if the platform from which they
were in the habit of delivering their opinions detracted from the value of their utterances. The phrase was, it is believed,
for the first time applied to them, although since commonly in use when speaking of men who advocate popular
measures of reform from platforms to which the term “ stump ” could in no sense apply. It may be fairly claimed for
the men who made use of this primitive class of platform that they uttered less bombastic nonsense than many who
have subsequently spoken both in and out of Parliament. No threats of “broken heads and flaming houses,” or the
deportation of the representative of the throne, were ever, on any occasion, indulged in by them, although greater
provocation had been given for their doing so. But the movement was none the less formidable because inflammatory
language was abstained from.
THE RISE OF POLITICAL AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS.
The commission appointed to take evidence as to the complaints of the goldfields residents previously referred to,
lost no time in bringing up their report before the Legislative Council, which at that time consisted partly of nominee
and partly of elective members, the first being appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor, the latter elected by freeholders
in those localities which were proclaimed electoral districts. It bore but little analogy to either the Upper or Lower
House under the present constitution. It more nearly resembled a national board of advice than a legislative chamber,
the members of which assisted the Governor and Colonial Secretary in framing measures in accordance with the
requirements of the community. The emergency was a serious one. The revenue previously raised on the goldfields
had entirely ceased, while the expense of maintaining a large force for the protection of property and the preservation of
order continued. The exchequer was nearly bankrupt, and a large outlay would be necessary to effect the whole of the
measures of reform insisted upon. A numerous staff of surveyors was required to lay out townships on the diggings
The construction of the roads to connect them with the ports would absorb hundreds of thousands of pounds. The
sale of lands would ultimately recoup this. The expenditure must be immediate, the returns would be remote. Added
to this, a severe financial crisis was threatening the colony, which culminated the following year. The difficulties in
the way of the legislators were formidable; but they set about the task of surmounting them with commendable alacrity.
Shortly after this time the first English investment in Victorian securities, known as the Gabraelli Loan, became
available. The law officers of the Crown drafted bills, which were then submitted to the House for its approval before
becoming law. In the instance of the license fee, the proposals of the league were taken as the basis of the amount
and manner of its collection. Unfortunately, a foolish, obstinate, old man, one of the Melbourne representatives,
moved an amendment that the sum be forty instead of thirty shillings for the three months’ license, upon no stronger
argument than that the Legislature would not be dictated to by the mining population. It was carried in this altered
form without any provision for its ultimate abolition. The people to be affected were entirely unrepresented, and then-
opinions that the tax was both injudicious and vexatious ignored. Upon the other subjects embraced in the memorial,
less antagonism was shown. A bill was brought in extending the elective franchise to those who held annual licenses
either for pastoral or mining purposes. The latter, however, required that the holder should have been resident and
registered in the locality in which he intended to exercise the right for a period of three months antecedent to the time
when an election took place. This, being a fundamental alteration in the constitution, had to be submitted to the
Imperial authorities for approval, and consequently was reserved for that purpose, and did not come into force till
March, 1855. Enough was in progress before the end of September to render a continuance of the feverish excitement
occasioned by the agitation of the league no longer necessary or excusable. The committee resolved, therefore, to hold a
final meeting and furnish a report of their proceedings, with a balance-sheet accounting for the funds with which they
had been entrusted, of which they still had a balance in hand largely exceeding the historical sixpence of a later period.
The meeting was accordingly held at the usual place, the Hospital Hill.


A ludicrous episode occurred on the occasion, worth narrating as evidence of how little the feelings of diggers
were understood by the Government of the day. In response to the demand for equal political rights, it made an absurd
offer to appoint a nominee member to represent the goldfields, and for choice of the person so nominated asked of the
Camp officials the names of three eligible persons to select from. The names furnished were those of Dr. Tierney,
Edward Nucella Emmet, and Osgood Pritchard, but as they were of equal merit, it was determined they should draw
lots for the office, and the successful one, it approved of by the populace, receive the appointment. The Jonah on the
occasion happened to be Emmet, who submitted himself to the ordeal of the plebiscite. On presenting himself, he was
accorded a patient hearing, but the proposal was rejected with contempt. The association, having now achieved the
objects for which it had been called into existence, proposed to disband, and invited the meeting to determine in what
manner the surplus funds in hand should be disposed of. Several propositions were discussed, and a determination
ultimately arrived at to expend the money by havin; a festival to commemorate the event. This was held accordingly
on that part of Bendigo Flat which had not been subject to digging operations. It was largely attended, and everything
passed over pleasently.
With this festival terminated what at one time threatened to have had a much less peaceful ending. Most of
the abuses which led to the organization were in course of removal. The survey of the various goldfield towns
was in course of preparation. The construction of the worst parts of the Mount Alexander road was undertaken. The
restrictions on the sale of liquors were not entirely removed, but the high-handed proceedings in quest of the prohibited
article were greatly abated. The facilities for obtaining licenses were much increased, and the authorities less tyrannical
and overbearing than they had been. This district either was or was supposed to have been proclaimed a place in which
liquors might be sold, and permission was accorded to one place known as the “ Exchange,” situated where the Shamrock
Hotel was afterwards built. But the establishment was not popular, a suspicion being current that it was in reality
owned by some Government official, although ostensibly conducted by another person.
With the sale of the land now forming the city, the conditions of society greatly changed. Comfortable dwellings
quickly took the place of the frail canvas shelter to which we had been previously accustomed. With the establishment
of permanent houses came also the formation of family ties. The married men sent for their wives and children ;
single men looked round them in search of those with whom they could form alliances, and marriage became an
institution. The socialities and amenities of life were once again within reach of the gold-seeker. Men thought less of
making their piles and quitting the colony, and more of settling in their new homes. Many sent for their relations to
join them here, in place of returning to the countries which they had quitted. With the change in character of the
population, other industries soon found opportunities to establish themselves in the midst of a thriving community, and
the people rapidly lost the characteristics peculiar to a nomadic condition of society. Churches, schools, charitable
institutions, and public buildings for various purposes were erected. With the improvements in these directions came
the necessity for better streets and roads. Municipal institutions and rates and taxes followed. The blue and
red shirted denizen of ’53 became the citizen of ’54. His very appellation altered. He had been content with being
addressed as “Brother Digger;” he now resented any such familiarity, and wore broad-cloth, white shirt, and bell-topper.
His boots were no longer destitute of blacking, and ho expected to be styled “gentleman” when spoken to from the public
platform. The enterprising staging company originated by Cobb had shortened the journey to the metropolis in point
of time from sixty hours to fifteen. He obtained his Melbourne paper on the same day it was printed ; had his own local
journal to report and check any abuse of power by Government servants; in fact, had achieved a huge stride toward the
high state of civilisation which he now enjoys. But it took several years longer before Sandhurst became what it now is.
For years it had neither the gas or water supply it now enjoys; years elapsed before the rail connected it with Hobson’s
Bay and the Murray. All through this time the wooden structures were gradually giving place to the handsome and
substantial buildings of the city of the present.
In the previous pages the progress of the agitation has been traced from the formation of a committee to carry
out the objects sought to be obtained, to the final dissolution of that body, and the question naturally arises of what the
result might have been had the Government, as it subsequently did at Ballarat, persisted in an attempt to coerce the
mining population by the employment of the forces at its disposal. To understand the relation in which the opposing
elements stood to each other, it will be necessary to give an outline of the then character of the communities of the
goldfields. The whole was divided into entirely distinct parties, the one being the Camp, which consisted of
Government officials, the police and soldiers; the other, the diggers, storekeepers, and persons carrying on the few
other occupations which were allowed to be exercised in these districts. We use the term “allowed” because doubts
were entertained by the authorities whether any but diggers, storekeepers, or persons incidentally necessary to the
former occupation, had any right to locate themselves there at all. For instance, the first attempt to start a printing
business at Ballarat was objected to, and the enterprising proprietor warned off. Lawyers, again, were scarcely tolerated
in the local police court, and reporters for the press were asked what business they had there. Between these parties
there was a constantly increasing feeling of antagonism, and, on one side at least, of decided aversion towards the other.


It was not improbable that the two might come into collision, and the effect of their doing so can be judged of only by
careful consideration of their relative positions, and the moans of resistance possessed by each, which we shall now
proceed to describe. Of the Camp, it will be necessary first to describe the ground on which the Government had
encamped their forces. The Camp, as it was usually styled, occupied an area of ground of about 70 acres in extent,
the boundary lines of which faced a row of stores called Camp-street on the south-east; Commissioner’s Gully, now the
Upper Reserve, on the north-west; View-street, then merely a small gully, to the west; and the road passing the Bendigo
Hotel to Barnard-street to the east. The whole was enclosed by a two-rail fence, but the formation of the surface was
very different to what it is now. The present fence facing the Mall was about a chain further in towards the rising
ground, from thence to the upper walk from the View-street entrance the ground was flat, terminating with an abrupt
ledge of rock, a continuation of the same reef still existing near the court-house, running through the wood where the
master of the High School now has his residence, and continuing nearly to the western boundary. At the base of the
rook was the natural channel of the Bendigo Creek, a small portion of which, until quite recently, was enclosed within
the present fernery. The upper ground was reached by two paths, one at View-street and the other along the same
tracks by which the court-house is at present approached. The slope towards Commissioner’s Gully has been very little
changed, and an entry was practicable at any point. The surface consists of bare sandstone rock, on which a few
ironbark trees struggled for existence, and a few white gums occupied the more congenial soil of the flat. Within this
area was the lock-up, built of logs and roofed with bark. The remaining portion was occupied by the police court,
commissioner’s quarters, offices for issue of licenses, gold receiver, police quarters (mounted and foot), stables for horses,
etc., and, on the arrival of the troops’ tents, for them likewise ; the stables were only sheds formed of bark, the rest all
canvas. At the north-east corner, the present site of the gaol, was a considerable quantity of hay protected from the
weather by a covering partly of bark and part canvas. Within this space was encamped the whole force which the
Government had at its command to oppose some thousands who formed the league. The force numbered between four
amd five hundred men, of whom less than a third consisted of men of the 40th regiment of infantry, the police included
some old prisoners, the rest were raw levies, without either experience or discipline. No water was obtainable except
from that portion of the creek before mentioned, or by carting it from a distance; this supply could at any time be
easily intercepted. Stores there were none, except those furnished day by day by contractors, which could be with
equal facility stopped. Every point in the enclosure was within a range of three hundred yards either from
Commissioner’s Gully or the flat, through which the Mall or M'Crae-street now runs. Retreat from this cul de sac, for
it was nothing else, could be effected only along routes lined through with holes sunk in search for gold, but at the same
time formed a chain of rifle pits such as probably never was witnessed before. Not a single tenement within the
enclosure was ball proof, with the exception of the log hut before mentioned, consisting of two cells of some sixteen feet
square each. The only formidable portion of the forces holding this post were the military. The police, both horse and
foot, were a mere rabble. The value of the first had been proved only a month previously, when ten men in charge of
some £12,000 worth of gold had, on the road between MTvor and Elphinstone, abandoned the treasure on receiving a
volley from some ruffians lying in ambuscade, by which only one man was slightly injured in the shoulder and one horse
was killed. Whether attacked by two or twenty men they never stopped to ascertain, and probably it would have
remained unknown to the present time had the ruffians not betrayed themselves. Whether the horses or the men were
mostly to blame for the stampede is not material. They were at least a tolerably fair sample of the efficiency of that
branch of the service. Neither the men nor the horses they rode were trained to the work they had to do. Of the foot
police it need only be mentioned that the pay of the force was but 10s., when unskilled labour readily obtained £l, per
diem, and any skilled artisan in any of the handicrafts in request, either in the towns or on the diggings, twice that
amount. It was very clear, therefore, that the 10s. men were not, by any means, the cream of the population, added to
which, there existed a strong feeling of dislike between them and the soldiers who, although much more effective, were,
owing to a foolish parsimony, receiving but 4s. per day, which, at the cost of provisions at that time, barely sufficed for
the common necessaries of life. They were correspondingly discontented with the service. Further, the police were
thoroughly detested by the diggers, while the soldiers were invariably treated with respect when venturing beyond the
precincts of the Government enclosure, and had very little inclination for the work in which they were likely to be
employed should a collision with the people take place. This force was but very indifferently armed for the struggle in
which they seemed likely to be engaged. The weapon still in use by them was the clumsy smooth-bore muskets that
took many seconds to load. The English soldier had not, at that time, been trained to shoot at a mark, and, if he had,
the weapon in use was perfectly useless for the purpose. The flight of the projectile was never, except by remote
accident, twice in the same line of direction ; in fact, at a range of one hundred and fifty yards, it was comparatively
harmless. The only other weapon he had was the bayonet, equally clumsy, and of little use except when attached to
the barrel of the piece. Two light field pieces of artillery were also reported to form part of the armament, but to what
use they could be put, excepting to make a noise, frighten and render unmanageable the horses of the mounted men, it is
difficult to conjecture; at any rate, the intelligence of their being there was the source of much merriment to those who


had had experience of the utility of these weapons under similar circumstances. Against this force so situated, the
league could oppose a numerous, if undisciplined, body of men, to whom irregular warfare was no novelty. To describe
them correctly, however, it will be necessary to take a retrospective glance at the history of the five years preceding this
period. The year 1848 will ever be memorable in the annals of human history. At its opening, the world seemed to be
in the enjoyment of profound peace. Kings for a time seemed to have tired of their pastime—war. England had
recently achieved her long advocated free-trade policy, that was to prove a universal panacea for all the ills under
which humanity suffered. The high priest and apostle of the new faith had been entertained by the European
potentates, amongst whom he had been endeavouring to make proselytes. On his return to England, early in February,
his credulous adherents were informed that henceforth war was an impossibility, that national rivalries would no longer
find vent in cutting one another’s throats, but in the philanthropic effort to fill each others bellies and to clothe each
other ; in fact, the Millennium had come at last. The future mission of mankind was to produce cheap cottons and to
grow cheap corn. Louis Phillippe had been his last host, and was credited with possessing the firmest throne in Europe.
Alas for the vanity of human predictions! before the end of the month the French King was a fugitive, had crossed the
English Channel in an open boat to find a refuge in the land of his late guest, and, for convenience sake, had dropped
the name of Capet, and adopted the less pretentious one of William Smith. The Bourbon Dynasty came in on the
shoulders of a fool, and after more than eight centuries of mis-government, went out with the peajacket, in which the
most sagacious monarch in Europe found it convenient to disguise himself from his exasperated subjects. His
sagacity had been the theme of much eulogy, and, perhaps, not undeserved, but it appeared to have had as much
resemblance to true wisdom as pinchbeck has to gold. He failed to read the times, and he lost a throne. Before the end
of the year the revolutionary wave rolled in one long swell over Europe, from the Atlantic to the Danube. The storm
raged from Paris to Pesth ; France, Italy, Bohemia, and Austria were writhing in the throes of conflict. The Bourbons,
Hohenzollerns, and Hapsburgs fled to their capitals, the Pope was driven out of the Eternal City, and for a short period
it looked as if the Divine right of kings was at an end. The men, however, who had wrought these marvels seemed
possessed only of the ability to pull down, not of that to reconstruct. The tide ebbed as quickly as it had risen; the
thrones, the churches, and the money-changers rallied, and, after a fierce and bloody conflict, once again seated
themselves in their accustomed places. The actors who had thrown this desperate main against kings, priests, and
nobles had lost the game, and it now became their turn to fly. As the late bishop expressed it, “ gold was discovered in
the fulness of time.” The December month gave assurance to the world that Legitimacy had triumphed, and at the same
time that gold was discovered on the shores of the Pacific, within the territories of the American Republic. To be on the
losing side in any contest is bad enough ; in that of an internecine struggle, worst of all. Britons engaged in similar
pursuits when on the losing side enjoyed privileges long unknown to the less enlightened nations of the Continent. They
had the alternative of being cut down during the conflict, escaping, or being hung, drawn, and quartered if caught after
it was over. The foreigner had only that of escape or being shot, either during the conflict or afterwards. The confiscation
of properties followed alike in both instances. Those who could do so, elected to escape, and the mob before whom
crowned heads had trembled, crossed the Atlantic, traversed the vast plains lying to the west of the Mississippi, scaled the
heights of the Rocky Mountains, and descended the slopes of the Pacific in search of a new home in this modern El Dorado;
or, braving the rigors of the frigid zone, rounded the Horn or doubled the Cape, traversing the wide expanse of water of
the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, entered on the promised land by the way of the Golden Gate, where they built the
capital of a new state that far outrivals the cities built by Spain during a period of three centuries. The days of Cortes
and Pizarro were revived this time, not to destroy an old, but to build a new civilisation. This was the most eventful of
all the many scenes in the drama of this “ anno mirabilis,” 1848. Barely two years elapsed before the re-discovery that
gold abounded in these colonies was made. We use this expression because a very general error prevails that the
discovery of the precious metal in California preceded the finding of it here, which was not the case, as will be hereafter-
shown. The news, however, of Hargreaves having found it at Bathurst quickly turned the stream of emigration towards
these shores, and with it came many of those restless spirits who had played their parts in the European convulsions
previously narrated; with them, also, a large influx from the British Isles, who, though not satisfied with the institutions
they were leaving, had no experience of any that were better. Both found a state of society not only new to them,
but one in which the liberty of the subject was more restricted and less respected than in the worst governed state in
Europe. Gold-seeking was a new experience, and the seeker of that day bore no resemblance to the miner of the present.
Mining is now a pursuit requiring both skill and experience for its successful prosecution. Digging for gold required
neither. The metal was found on the surface, or at most, but a few feet beneath. A robust constitution to endure
exposure and a hardy frame capable of work were the only requisites. But he possessed what the miner has now no
occasion for: the knowledge of fire-arms and a constant familiarity with the use of them. Of such material was the
population of this district composed, numbering at the lowest computation fully 30,000 in number, and with them the
Government had to reckon. It had been the first that menaced the employment of an armed force to quell the discontent
which their own measures had created, and that was the sole answer to a constitutional remonstrance presented to


them. I hey had established their forces on the Camp, and an attack upon the people was expected to ensue. Those
who had to oppose them were free to choose the ground on which they would meet the encounter, and did so. They also
determined to have choice of time, and for this reason the instructions had been given for the dispersal of the crowd the
instant the troops were moved toward them. The troops most necessarily fall back on the Camp when they had no one
to confront them. The ground between holes in the gully and flat to their front and rear would have been immediately
occupied, and nothing allowed to pass those lines either in or out. The stores along Camp and Auction-streets, now
known as the Mall, would have been required to shift off the ground, or in remaining would do so at their own peril.
Those who planned the arrangments estimated that iive hundred men would be amply sufficient to hold these positions,
the broken nature of the ground precluding the possibility of their being attacked other than by men moving in single
files, and that only on foot. As before stated, both the soldiers and police were armed with obsolete smooth-bore
muskets. Many of their opponents had rifles sighted up to a range of 900 yards, and were expert in the handling of
them. They had no bayonets, it is true, but in place of them possessed revolvers, which could be used with deadly
effect at even considerable distances, and at close quarters were most formidable weapons, though much less effective
than those now in vogue. Notwithstanding these preparations, it was hoped that no collision would occur, but if it did
the insurgents would deserve their fate if they neglected any precautions requisite to secure a victory. Reference has
been made to the store of hay at the north-east angle of the ground held by the Government forces. This was considered
the weak point of their position. It could be readily fired from the gully, and for that purpose cartridges were prepared
by an adept, who undertook upon himself the accomplishment of it. Should he succeed, there was every prospect that
the frail little canvas dwellings on the ground would be included in the conflagration, should the wind at the time come
from the right quarter, and the garrison be left with neither shelter or provisions. To cope with the forces opposed to
them was the least of the difficulties foreseen by the more reflecting portion of those who had engaged in the movement.
Success or defeat was equally fraught with danger to them. The blockade of the Camp, and its probable surrender
through the failure of supplies, was only a prelude to the fate eventually to befall themselves. Every pound of
provisions consumed on the diggings, beef and mutton only excepted, had to be procured from Melbourne or Geelong, and
these places were themselves dependent on the vessels entering by way of the Heads. The diggers could in their turn be
blockaded. A very trifling force landed from the Pacific fleet, which would doubtless be ordered round for the purpose,
would have sufficed to effect that object. This danger was too apparent to escape notice, and none were more anxious to
avert it than those who apparently provoked it. Their only hope of doing so was to act with firmness and moderation.
If they forsook their posts as leaders their places would have been quickly filled by others with less discernment,
and they would have been equally liable for the consequences that ensued. As was proved by the results, their policy
was a sound one.
THE ARREST OF CAPTAIN BROWN.
Nothing connected with the agitation for the repeal of the goldfields license occasioned greater surprise than did the
arrest of Captain Brown and the little excitment resulting therefrom. Considerable indignation was expressed by some
hot-headed persons that the committee did not resort to violent measures to prevent it, so well prepared to meet any attack
on the part of the Government as they were believed to be. A short biographical sketch of the man will be necessary to
explain this inaction. The charge under which the warrant for his arrest was issued was in no way connected with
anything relating to the movement, the information being laid against him for personal threats used against a storekeeper
named Wildash, which he himself did not deny having made; but the folly of the man in doing so can only be understood
by a description of his character. He was by birth an Irishman, having been born at Bandon, near Cork, had
been fairly educated, and was a good Latin and tolerable Greek scholar. He had been thrown early in life upon society
without either trade of profession ; all pursuits of a steady character were distasteful to him. When quite a youth he
landed upon the American shores, where he filled the position of clerk to an auctioneer in New Orleans, slaves being
among the articles dealt in by the firm. Subsequently he drifted into Texas, at that time a wild region, still in the
occupation of the Indian tribes. He appeared to have led a kind of half savage existence for a time, according to his
own account, domiciled with the Comanche Indians, one of the native tribes occupying that territory. Subsequently he
became a recruit in a force organised to protect the white settlers against the natives, known as the Texas Rangers, a
body of men that appeared to have been half soldier, half banditti; there he acquired his title of captain. After a time
he again returned to the more settled states and engaged in the expedition organized by Lopez to seize on Cuba and wrest
that island from Spanish dominion. He missed his appointment, and the vessel sailed without him, and thus escaped
the fate of others who embarked in that ill-starred adventure. Ultimately the discovery of gold in Australia drew him
to these shores. He landed first in Sydney, and finding no congenial field for the exercise of his varied and peculiar
talents came on to Victoria, arriving on Bendigo during the first week in June, 1853, supplied with a number of handbills
setting forth the miseries likely to befall the colony by the sudden influx of such large numbers of people
expected to land on the shores within a very short period. He addressed a meeting on this subject on the 6th of June,
as previously narrated. It failed to produce the sensation he expected. But grievances existed of which he had no


experience, and the meeting assembled by his placards was utilised to discuss them. He was invited to form one of the
committee to draw up the remonstrance against the existing abuses. Brown, however, although a florid and to a certain
extent effective speaker, was of little use in that direction. In fact, he knew nothing of the goldfields grievances , but it
was enough for him that they could be made the basis of an agitation of which he hoped to be leader and director, which
position he expected in some vague manner to turn to his own advantage. He had no fixed principles of any kind, or
business capacity for organization of any kind. He was always declamatory, never logical; his speeches were appeals
to the passions of his auditors rather than to their reason. He affected to despise while he flattered them. He was
popular only with those who knew him least; with the crowd he had some influence, with the committee scarcely any.
His imperious and dictatorial manner disgusted the men who formed that body. Nothing annoyed him more than finding
that the funds collected for the movement were not at his disposal, that the expenditure was closely scrutinized, and
while a liberal provision was made for all necessary expenses incurred, the services of those engaged in the work were
considered as rendered gratuitously ; but one salaried officer was appointed, namely, a secretary, and his remuneration
was upon a very moderate scale. All the funds raised in the name of the association had to be strictly accounted for,
paid in to the treasurer, and could only be drawn upon by resolution authorizing the expenditure. Brown was greatly
dissatisfied with these arrangements, but they were absolutely indispensable ; the strictest economy could alone enable
the association to meet the many calls likely to be made upon their funds. Organizing this district, Castlemaine, and
MTvor, was done at considerable expense. The deputation that waited on Governor Latrobe was a very costly affair, and
entirely without any beneficial results. The delegate left in Melbourne and the one dispatched to Ballarat had both to be
supplied with funds, and it was impossible to calculate what expenditure might have to be incurred before the movement
became a success. Brown, after an absence of a month, spent in Melbourne and Ballarat, returned to Bendigo on
the eve of the meeting of the 28th of August. The time spent by him at Ballarat had been apparently to little purpose.
His mission to organize that field had failed, and its co-operation was not to be relied on. His expenses, however, had
been a drain on the funds of the association. The interval had been very differently employed here ; with or without
assistance from other quarters, it had been determined to bring matters to an issue. Brown, as usual, wanted to dictate ;
he desired to know what were the plans in case of a collision with the troops occurring. Information on this subject was
refused him. He was invited to wait until the occurence took place, and assured that the question had been
considered by men in whose competency the association had every confidence, but were themselves ignorant of the
details. With this explanation he had to remain satisfied. Shortly after the meeting, at which the tender of the 10s.
fee was made, the committee were notified that no licenses would be collected for the current month, and that the
ether matters contained in the petition formally presented would receive earnest attention at the hands of the
Government. The labors of the association were practically at an end. The committee stopped receiving
subscriptions, discontinued holding meetings, and set themselves about their ordinary occupations. No services being
required at the hands of any of the members, it was notified that in the future no one could have any claims on the
funds of the Association. Brown was dissatisfied with this arrangement, evidently looking upon a continuance of the
agitation as a source of revenue in the future. He very much overrated both his services and his influence, and finding
that nothing was to be gained from the committee, he roamed over the diggings, ventilating what he considerered his
grievances, which were, in fact, that the committee having attained the objects they had in view, declined to assist him in
keeping up a state of feverish excitement, there being no warranty for so doing. Other members of the Association had
their attention drawn to the matter of his complaint, and were sitting to consider them, when a number of the mounted
force appeared at the office of the Association, armed with the warrant for Brown’s arrest on the charge Wildash had
laid against him. The document, when exhibited, proved to be in the usual form in which such instruments were
required by law, and the officer entrusted with it was requested to withdraw while the members present deliberated
on the course they should pursue. This was agreed to, on an assurance being given that no communication should be
attempted with persons outside the tent. This was readily done. Brown was then interrogated by the committee, and
he admitted to them that some such expressions as those set out in the warrant had been used by him towards the
complainant, intended only as a joke. He was expostulated with on the folly of his proceedings, but as the affair was only a
question of finding bail if the charges were proved, it was better to do this than occasion any excitement over so foolish
a matter, and arrangements were at once come to that two members of the committee should accompany him to the
Camp for the purpose of meeting the charge, he being advised at the same time not to admit the fact, or to enter on any
attempt to justify it. The officer serving the warrant, who, if I remember rightly, was named Smith, was then called in,
and the determination arrived at, at once communicated to him, suggesting at the same time that to avoid any
excitement while passing to the Camp, it would be as well to make as little parade of the police accompanying him as
possible. This he acquiesced in, and, dismounting, two of the troopers tendered their horses that Brown and one of
the committee might ride with him, and the police could follow at a distance. This proposal was accepted, several
others proceeding to the court on foot. On arriving there the police magistrate proceeded at once to hear the charge,
which amounted, according to the evidence given for the prosecution, that Brown had talked of burning down the stores


and hanging the proprietors who sided with the Government against the diggers. There was no corroborative
testimony offered, but his propensity to talk induced him to supply the deficiency by admitting he had done so merely as
a joke, and was informed that peaceable men must be protected against the indulgence of that kind of jocularity,
and he would have to give security against a repetition of it for a period of six months in two sureties of £3OO each.
A number of the committee undertook that this should be done, but as freeholders were not to be had on the goldfield,
it was proposed to lodge money to that amount in the hands of the authorities instead. This being agreed to, it
was suggested that as this could not be accomplished until the next morning, the accused should be afforded decent
lodging in the interim, and his friends allowed to supply him with what he might require while detained, and also to
keep him company until bail was forthcoming. This was also conceded, and the tent of one of the officers placed
at his disposal. One of the committee stayed with him while the others went to procure the stipulated amount of bail.
Supper was ordered from one of the restaurants, and brandy and cigars supplied with it. All went on pleasantly until
eight o’clock, when the friend he had chosen to spend the afternoon and evening with him was informed that the sentinels
were about being relieved, and the guard set for the night, and he would be required to take his departure unless he
elected to stay until morning. He accordingly left the Camp, and proceeded on his way to his own quarters. On the
following morning two of the committee proceeded to the Camp to lodge the stipulated bail. But on arrival there they found
the whole face of affairs changed; a double line of sentries were posted throughout the ground, and the visitors experienced
great difficulty in gaining admission. On arriving at the tent where Brown had been lodged the previous evening they
found he had been shifted into the lock-up, and demanding an explanation of this unexpected difficulty were referred
to the P.M. for an explanation. On interviewing him, they ascertained that Brown had made disclosures that warranted
the course taken, and the bail tendered was refused. The parties requested to see Brown, which was acceded to, but
strong misgivings arose in their minds that the whole affair was a trap by the Government to get possession of the
persons of the more prominent actors in the late agitation. This, however, proved not to be the case. It appeared that
Brown was no sooner left to himself on the previous night than his propensity to gasconade led him to enter into
conversation with the officer whose tent he was occupying. What the precise nature of his remarks were could not
be ascertained from him. He, however, admitted having alluded to the plans of the Association for blockading the
Camp if the meeting of the 28th August had been interfered with, and that the consent to bail him instead of having
resort to more violent measures now was attributable to the desire on the part of the committee to avoid bloodshed. The
officer to whom this communication had been made deemed it advisable to apprise his superior of it, which resulted in
the precautions being taken for Brown’s safe custody and the effective defence of the Camp, should the committee have
changed their pacific policy respecting the bail. Great disgust was felt by the persons who had interested themselves on
his behalf, and an opinion arrived at that he was both a vain and dangerous fool whom it was perilous to associate
with. No further steps were therefore taken to get bail accepted, and Brown was conveyed to Melbourne for safer custody,
where he was detained until all danger from the previous excitement had passed away. He was himself solely to blame
for any inconvenience suffered by him. And had he been left alone by the authorities he would have proved quite
harmless, as he had ceased to have any influence with the association of the members of the committee, who were as
much disgusted with as the Government appeared afraid of him.
THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.
A very general impression prevails that California preceded Australia in this respect; such, however, was not the
fact. Gold had been found both in New South Wales and Victoria prior to the discoveries made of the metal in Suter’s
mill-race, in the neighbourhood of San Francisco. That the territory was a likely gold-bearing district had been predicted
by geologists, owing to the prevalence of the Silurian rocks, which everywhere characterised the surface of the country.
The first actual finder of the metal is believed to have been an unfortunate convict in the sister colony, who experienced
the irony of fortune in doing so. The mis-shapen mass, in the form of a nugget, offered for sale by him was assumed to
be the product of a robbery of jewellery, which had been melted down to avoid identification. The knowledge of metallurgy
existing at the time in the colony was not sufficient to distinguish native from manufactured gold, and although the man
persisted in his statement that he had picked it up on the surface, and no robbery was known to have taken place
which could account for his possession of it, he received a sentence of fifty lashes for having property which he could
not satisfactorily account for. Hargreaves was subsequently awarded £IO,OOO by the same community for repeating his
experience. As our national poet truly said, “ ’Tis a mad world, my masters.” New South Wales was not the only
place where gold had been found in Australia. The Britannia nugget, supposed to have been found by a shepherd in
the neighbourhood of the Pyrenees, long excited the curiosity of the early settlers. In 1847, fully twelve months
before the Californian discovery, some enterprising persons had attempted a systematic exploration of the country round
Daisy Hill—afterwards called Amherst —in search for gold, but were chased off the ground by the native police acting
under instructions from the authorities. The explanation of the riddle is this: —The precious metals, as they are termed,
both gold and silver, were in the times of high prerogative decreed by the servile judges of those days to be the


exclusive property of the Crown, even when found upon the private lands of the subject; and if associated with
baser metal, as it often is the case with silver, to the extent of five per cent, only of the ore, the Crown claimed
the lot. The reasons for this extraordinary doctrine are somewhat obscure, and the origin of the precedent very
uncertain, but probably derived, along with other absurdities, from Roman jurisprudence by our unreasoning
ancestors, who marvelled so much at the wisdom of the ancients. The only authority for the law which we can
lay hands on is an extract from Plowden, which is given in full, as an illustration of the logic of the period. In
Plowden’s report it is stated that this right was considered by the Solicitor-General of that day to exist in respect of the
excellency of the thing, that the common law appropriated everything to the persons whom it best suits as common and
trivial things to the common people, and because gold and silver were excellent things, the law had appointed them to
the person who is most excellent, and that was the king. In modern times we might be allowed to enquire if the term
excellent applied to their morals as well as their other attributes. However, the doctrine as to this right of the sovereign
seems to have been general throughout those countries where the feudal system prevailed, and the grant to work mines
in search of these metals could only be obtained from the sovereign, and on such conditions as it might please to
impose. Fortunately, for the progress of humanity, these were found to exist in a country that recognised no
sovereign but the people. The finder there became the owner. The merit due to Hargreaves lay in the fact that, having
witnessed the advantages accruing by this new interpretation of the voc vectis, gold for the finder, and not for the Crown,
he returned to New South Wales to put the rocker and Mexican bowl in motion, and gave it practical effect in a British
colony. Surprise is often expressed that the discovery of many of the richest deposits should have occurred in such
rapid succession, but very little reflection suffices to explain this seeming anomaly. On all earlier fields gold was found
scattered over the surface in grains more or less abundant, and varying in size from mere specks to lumps of an ounce
or more in weight. The surface quartz rock also carried it, and was broken up to obtain specimens, as they were termed. In
this colony, Buninyong, Ballarat, Clunes, Mount Alexander, Daisy Hill, and the Ovens, widely separated localities, were
all remarkable in this way, and almost simultaneously discovered. After heavy rains the glittering particles could
scarcely escape the notice of the least observant. The country, however, was so sparsely populated when devoted to
grazing purposes only, that many square miles in extent were occupied solely by a single shepherd and his hut-keeper.
These men were, for the most part, destitute of any knowledge beyond that of the merest animal instincts. They were
unlikely to know the value of the metal. Even when seen, much better educated men were in doubt whether
it was gold at all, and great uncertainty existed as to its real value until it had been assayed in England. The
voyage there and back then occupied the best part of a year. It is not surprising, therefore, that men were shy in
dealing with it. Added to which, the uncertainty as to the right of the subject to the possession of it greatly increased the
reluctance of would-be purchasers. Many of the station hands had been prisoners of the Crown, and doubtless knew
the tradition connected with the first unfortunate finder. Yet, in spite of all this, some small quantities are reported to have
been sold in Melbourne before Hargreaves returned from California, and even after that event, and the right to search
for it had been recognised as a lawful occupation, it failed for a considerable time to realise anything near its real
value, ranging from 455. to 705., instead, as it subsequently proved to be, worth 80s. per oz. It now becomes
interesting to trace the effect this new conception of the right to the Royal minerals had upon human progress. With
the possession of these either by the Greeks, Romans, or Jews, we have but little concern—that they all possessed and
highly esteemed them history informs me. Where or how obtained, and in what quantity, is a matter of great
uncertainty. With the discovery of the New World, id est America, a new page in history opens. Europe at the time
was in a semi-state of barbarism. Italy and Venice were enormously wealthy compared with the other portions of
Europe. They enjoyed a monopoly of the trade with Eastern Asia, which at that time was far in advance of the
civilization of Western Europe, and supposed to be enormously rich in the possession of what was then considered the
symbol of wealth —gold and silver. The trade between it and Europe was in the hands of these Mediterranean trading
republics, or, more properly, associations of merchants. Portugal and Spain were then both poor countries, although
not so poor as they have subsequently become. Both were enterprising, and desired to participate in the lucrative trade
monopolised by Venice and Genoa. Portugal, under the auspices of its then Crown Prince Henry, despatched numerous
adventurers southward, with the hope of reaching the rich countries to the east, opening a passage by sea round the
southern extremity of Africa. The Spaniard, no less enterprising, fitted out an expedition under Columbus, a Genoese by
birth, to accomplish the same object by sailing direct west. The Portuguese succeeded in his enterprise; opened up the
trade to India and China by a new route, and by this means wrought the ruin of both Genoa and Venice. The
Spaniard failed, but in failing opened out a new world, of which the ancients had no conception. The expeditions had
both been fitted out by Royalty, and it could be reasonably inferred they were entitled to the profits likely to acme from
the adventurers. Henry VII. at that time occupied the throne of England, rather an insecure seat, which he well knew.
He, therefore, like some of his European successors, went in to save money, and thus provide against a rainy day, and
was at the time of his death reputed the richest monarch in Europe. Not willing himself to risk anything, he gave
permission to a syndicate of British merchants, his subjects, to adventure on their own account and give him a share in


the profits or plunder, the latter being the more appropriate term. They equipped the “ Cabots,” father and son
successively, to see what gains might be netted by following the track Columbus had marked out. In every instance the
principal inducement appears to have been the hope of obtaining gold. The country on the eastern coast of the continent,
with the exception of Mexico, either north or south, did not prove to be a gold-bearing territory, and was inhabited by a
fierce race addicted to war. The western or Pacific side was rich in these and other minerals. The natives had obtained
them in considerable quantities, which tempted their conquerors to plunder. Spain drew enormous quantities of treasure
from both Mexico and Peru, and in doing so treated the unfortunate natives with great barbarity, destroying in fact the
civilization to which these unfortunate states had attained. But the treasure obtained seems in no way to have benefited
mankind generally, and although at first enriching, ultimately proved the ruin of the Spanish nation. The gold discoveries
of the nineteenth century have produced a far different result, besides giving an unprecedented impetus to the trade and
industry of the older European States. It opened up and colonized vast tracts of land which had previously been overrun
by wild animals, and abandoned to the scarcely less savage Indian. That the ore proved a curse to humanity in the one
instance, while the other afforded such beneficent results, may with confidence be ascribed to the fact that the absurd
ideas of our ancestors respecting the attributes and rights of sovereigns had undergone a change with the advancing
intelligence of mankind, and in this respect gold may be said to have been discovered in the fulness of time; and but for
the example set by the citizens of the United States, the enormus wealth unearthed both here and in America might have
remained undiscovered for ages yet to come. The extension of commerce and development of science and industry
achieved during the last forty years would have been postponed for future generations to accomplish. The gold of the
sixteenth century proved a curse to mankind. The greed to possess it destroyed the civilization of a people whose
advancements in some directions were far ahead of their conquerors. The gold of the nineteenth century in the hands of the
common people connected the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean by means of several lines of railway, opened out the southern
island continent, and laid the foundation of communities that bid fair to fill a space in the history of the future, and assisted
in the success of many projects for the advancement of mankind, too numerous for detail within the limits of an ordinary
article; while to Spain it proved equally disastrous. That country has been not inaptly compared to a sieve, that gained
nothing from the wealth so abundantly poured through it, but was itself worn out in the process. The first occupant of
that throne who inherited the extensive dominions of that power in the old and new world dominated both. The third
generation showed the first symptoms of decay, since which the ruin has been rapid and complete. The once powerful state
only now exists through the jealousy of its neighbours, who have not hitherto agreed as to how the partition of the
spoil shall be made. The deplorable fate of that empire is traceable to the doctrine of Plowden as to the right of the
sovereign to the precious metals. In such hands, none but the parasites, panders and bullies of a Court were likely to
obtain any portion of the golden shower, and therefore to be the one or the other was a surer road to fortune than
following any regular industrial occupation or employment. Thus the ill-gotten wealth circulated through the veins of
the nation like poison, corrupting alike the Court, the camp, and the citizen.
THE EARLY DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PASTORAL AND MINING INDUSTRIES.
The cause of the bitter feeling that in the early days of the diggings existed between the pastoral tenants, usually
known as squatters, and the inhabitants of the goldfield, is but very imperfectly understood, even by old colonists ; and
to the present generation it is a complete enigma. The facts, however, are sufficiently recent to admit of easy
explanation. Prior to the gold discoveries the whole of the land in the Australias, including both Tasmania and New
Zealand, were at the disposal of the English Government, and an act was passed by the Imperial Parliament,
empowering the Queen-in-council to frame regulations for their occupancy and disposal, in pursuance of which power the
Queen and Privy Council on the 9th March, 1847, passed a series of orders embodying the conditions under which these
vast territories might be occupied for pastoral and other purposes, the chief provisions of which were as follow The
whole of the lands were divided in three classes, “ settled, intermediate, and unsettled districts.” The first was defined,
so far as concerned this colony, to include a radius of twenty-five miles round Melbourne, fifteen round Geelong, and ten
round the towns of Warrnambool, Belfast, and Alberton. These areas might be alienated after survey and by auction.
The second, termed the intermediate, included the counties of Grant and Bourke in the neighborhood of Hobson’s Bay,
and Normanby in the Western district, with other counties, of which the boundaries might be fixed before the 31st
December, 1848, together with the whole of Gippsland within these areas. The term of lease was to be for eight years
with the right of purchase to the lessee during or at the expiration of the term, at the upset price. The third was
described as the unsettled districts, and comprised the whole lands of the colony not heretofore specified. The second
and third class were open to be taken up by purchase before survey in blocks of not less than twenty thousand acres
each, the purchase money being either payable here or at the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom. Under this, the
latter provision, many of the large landed estates in the colony were acquired, the price being £1 per acre. The term for
which the leases were offered for the unsettled districts was fourteen years, the rental being threepence per head of
sheep. The land was capable of grazing, with a right to purchase the whole or any portion in blocks of not less than


160 acres during the term at one pound per acre, but to secure this fixity of tenure the licensees in possession were
required to send in their application within six months of the gazetting of the orders in council. The squatter demurred
at the purchase price named for the land, with some show of reason at that time. As the territory was of very unequal
value, portions would carry four sheep to the acre, while others would require ten times that quantity to feed one,
and a very large proportion of the colony was of the latter description. A uniform price was therefore manifestly unjust,
the tenants averring that the poorer lands were dear at a farthing an acre. Fortunately for mankind they rejected the
terms. Had they accepted them the colony would have remained a sheep-walk to this day, as the right then to enter
on the land in search of gold could have only been exercised by the Crown. Neither the occupant nor the purchaser
would have had a right to mine for it, and the progress of civilisation would have been retarded for generations, perhaps
for centuries. The majority of the squatters held back with the hope of securing better terms. While negotiations were
pending, gold was discovered and their expectations blighted. They continued as annual licensees only, and thus
acquired no interest in the land itself. Their right was to the grass solely, hence the reason why they were unable to
obstruct the new arrivals in prospecting the country in search of gold. Between them and the mining community a
feeling of antagonism quickly developed. Grass and water were indispensable to the former; the latter destroyed the one
and spoiled the other. The finding of gold on a pastoral run meant the ruin of that industry. It was not to be wondered
at that they should throw every impediment in the way of the latter. This they did to the utmost of their power. They
were first in possession of the land. They were few in number, had a community of interest—and possessed a
preponderating influence in the Legislature. They were allied with the leading commercial houses in Melbourne and
Geelong, being before the gold discoveries the possessors of the only exportable products of the country, wool, tallow and
hides, added to which most of the merchant firms were more or less directly interested in station properties themselves.
The colonies at the time had not yet been separated. The statute law in force was such as was adapted for a penal
settlement. Two iniquitous laws existed, the one relating to the impounding of cattle, the other regulating the sale of
spirituous and fermented liquors. The Legislature speedily added a third, namely, the goldfield license. The whole
length of the tracks leading to the various diggings, when the distance of 25 miles from town was reached, lay over land
in the occupation of some one or another squatter who possessed the right to impound all cattle not his own found
trespassing on it, and as the turning loose of the bullocks and horses employed in the carriage of goods was inevitable,
the teamsters were annoyed by having their teams impounded, causing them both expense and delay, thus engendering
much ill-feeling towards the instigators of the annoyance. The liquor law, which had been passed to suppress an evil
that had grown up in the midst of a convict population, namely, the payment of wages of assigned servants by supplying
them with spirits instead of money, was doubtless intended to serve a good purpose, but its provisions were in no sense
suitable to the class of persons who came to the colony in thousands to search for gold. The goldfields license was an
atrocious piece of legislation from every point of view. It was alike an unjust, unequal, unprofitable and oppressive
method of raising revenue, and the mode of collecting it was irritating in the extreme; all the three obnoxious laws
emanated from a Legislature mainly composed of men directly or indirectly associated with the squatting interest. It
was, therefore, not much to be wondered at that the class were long held in utter detestation by the new arrivals. On
the other hand, the adventurers were regarded with equal aversion by the squatter. A discovery of gold on his run was
no trifling calamity, it meant the entire ruin of the station. An inroad of miners soon converted the hitherto richly
grassed land into a desert. Water for his flocks, never too abundant, was speedily absorbed, and the stock had either to
be sold or removed. Nor did the increased demand in the meat market and the price obtainable by any means
compensate him for the loss of feed and water. The runs for the most part had been but too recently occupied for any
very large accumulation of his not over numerous flocks, and the older stations in the sister colony shared the advantage
equally with him, without sustaining the losses to which he became subject. It is not surprising, therefore, that each
viewed the other with dislike. The one regarded the other as an unwelcome intruder, while the new arrival looked upon
the earlier settler as an obstructive monopolist in the possession of vast tracts of land of which he made but little
profitable use. A cry was soon raised for unlocking the lands, in other words to turn the sheep walks into farms. The
squatter stubbornly resisted the proposed innovation. The class, though not numerous, were wealthy, and a common
danger united them in a compact body. They collected large funds and employed the ablest legal talent at their
command, packed the Legislature with their friends and partisans, and clamoured loudly that compensation should be
awarded them for being refused their leases, forgetting that they themselves had refused to accept them when offered,
and only sought them when the labor of others had given enhanced value to the ground, which they had formerly
asserted was dear at a farthing an acre; and if now they were to be deprived of their squattages, why should they be
awarded compensation, which they modestly estimated at a sum of two millions sterling ? They were all-powerful in the
Legislative Council, and not without friends in the Assembly, and employed more money at their command to corrupt
others. The stiuggle was a protracted one, and the lands of the colony in the meantime were pretty well manipulated
to their advantage. They succeeded, either through the connivance or the stupidity of the Legislators, in evading the laws
from time to time passed with the view of establishing an agricultural population on the soil. The conflict was


maintained until the year ’62, at which period, had they taken their leases in ’4B as by the orders of Council upon
which they based their claim they were required to do, the term had run out by the effluxion of time. They, however,
hoped still to obtain renewals, but the popular party had been gaining strength in the Lower House. The press, too,
throughout the colony, had thoroughly ventilated the question, and the squatters’ stronghold, the Legislative Council,
had no supports to fall back on this time. The wealthy lower orders, as the present Chief Justice styled them, had to
give way, and the people at last gained access to the land which they had so long monopolized. But the corpus was
not thrown to them until the former occupants had had their opportunity to carve out the choice pieces for themselves.
And even then they tried every manoeuvre to evade the law by the employment of dummy selectors, and false and
fraudulent declarations to obtain possession of a portion of the remnants. The new generation that has grown up know
nothing of this long protracted struggle to open up the colony, and the time that has elapsed since these days has almost
driven out the memory of the squatters’ wrong-doings from the recollections of those who so strenuously opposed them.
Before quitting the subject, it will be interesting to consider the principle guiding the framers of the two Imperial statutes,
5 and 6 Viet., chap. 36, and 9 and 10 Viet., chap. 104. As the preambles in both statutes inform us, “ The Queen, by
the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and Commons in Parliament assembled,” undertook the
responsibility of dealing with a portion of the globe which not one of them had ever seen, equal in size to the whole of
Europe, and of which it may be safely asserted nine-tenths of them were as ignorant of its capabilities as if it had been
situated in another planet instead of another hemisphere. The perilous task was, nevertheless, undertaken by them, and
that the mischievous legislation proved less disastrous than it inevitably would have done but for the ignorance and
cupidity of the class of whom we have given a very imperfect description, was the mere matter of accident that gold was
discovered before the rights of private property within the territory had assumed the character of inalienable freeholds,
instead of being what in reality they were, terminable estates only by effluxion of time. Had it proved otherwise a few
gigantic properties would have been created ; but the immense impetus given to the world by means of the gold
discoveries would have been deferred for years. If the advocates of the nationalization of the soil require illustrations to
support their views they need go no further than these colonies for them. Here was witnessed the spectacle of a mere
handful of men, many of whom were too illiterate to fill in their cheques on the banks for the thousands of pounds that
stood to their credit in those institutions, amassing wealth through the energy, enterprise, and labors of the men who
flocked to these shores in the “fifties,” and without whose efforts the colonies must have remained a wilderness to the
present day. We quote the lines of a poet of democracy :
“ Allah! Allah ! the stranger cries,
The traveller wondrous visions sees,
The greatest and the latest is,
The drones controlled the bees.”
Never in the world’s history has the unearned increment assumed such proportions as it has done in this, the latest
settled portion of it, and that it has done so is attributable to the fact that wealth, and not intellect, controlled the
destinies of the mighty empire of which we boast, at the time when the before-quoted statutes became a portion of
our written laws.
FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE BENDIGO GOLDFIELDS DISTEICTS.
The first authentic account of the discovery of gold fixes the date as being early in December, 1851. The first
found was taken out of the dry bed of the Bandicoot Creek, a native name, which from the peculiar inflexion of the
syllables by the Aboriginals, is supposed to have been corrupted by the white adventurers into the name the district now
bears. The scarcity of water at the time prevented any extensive prospecting, and not until the following winter,
commencing about the middle of May, was there any considerable influx of population, and that consisted of men
principally from the neighbouring colonies, the exodus from Europe and America having then only recently
commenced. The winter of ’52 was the time of the first important rush to the field, during which an extensive area of
ground was opened up but very imperfectly worked, and the dry season intervening, the field was for the most part
abandoned for the more promising localities of Forest and Fryer’s Creeks, but enough gold had been obtained to ensure a
return of the diggers when the wet season should again set in. Towards the beginning of April, ’53, the population of the
various other mining centres of the colony commenced to move towards the locality, and by the end of May, numbered
little less than between fifty and sixty thousand persons. The district for miles around was dotted over with the white
tents, bark and log huts of the gold seekers, interspersed with the larger tenements of the like materials occupied as
stores. Supplies for the feeding of this numerous host were furnished from the seaport of Melbourne, the distance being
as nearly as possible one hundred miles. No stock of provisions had been accumulating during the dry season, in
anticipation of the “ rush,” nor did the frail and insecure nature of the canvas and slab stores admit of such being done.
The cost of carriage over unformed tracks during the winter season was, therefore, enormous, reaching as high as £l5O
per ton, and for a short period even exceeding that sum. Provisions of all kinds, clothing, tools and everything necessary
to sustain life while the miner is prosecuting his search for the much coveted mineral, were excessively costly. Flour


was from £l6 to £2O per bag, equivalent to between five and six ounces of gold; nothing sold by weight could be purchased
under 2s. per lb., beef and mutton only excepted ; fresh pork was 2s. 6d., ham 4s. to ss. Butter, chiefly Irish, salt, was 4s.
to ss. per lb., milk 4s. per quart, sardines, small tins, 3s. each; pickles, principally London manufacturers, 3s. 6d. per pint
bottle ; and other things in like proportions. Fresh vegetables of any kind were scarcely procurable; cabbages brought
from 3s. 6d. to 10s. apiece, onions 45., and potatoes Is. Bd. per lb.; other descriptions were not obtainable at any price.
Mining tools and implements equally dear, a cradle costing £6, puddling tub halt H.H.D. £4 10s. Horse feed shared in
the like fabulous prices; oats were from £2 10s. to £3 ss. per bushel, bush hay £7O per ton, English pressed sold to
2s. per lb., but very little was used at that price. Coined money or its equivalent in paper was excessively scarce;
purchases were thus very frequently effected by the interchange of gold for other commodities; the Government took it in
payment of revenue at the rate of £3 per oz. Copper money was for a long time unused, boxes of matches doing duty
for it when anything less than Is. had to be accounted for. The gold buyer escaped the necessity of small change by
having no lesser weight than half-pennyweight. It will thus be apparent that rich as the miners were, a very large
portion of the population had to endure great hardships and privation. Sickness was very prevalent, chiefly arising from want
of proper diet, and the use of brackish water. The principal forms of disease were dysentery, scurvy and ophthalmia. The
people clamoured loudly for reforms in the whole social structure of the colony. The Government and official staff under
it, were the most incompetent set of imbeciles that could possibly have been got together to deal with such an
unprecedented state of affairs. They were deaf to all remonstrance and ignored all suggestions made to them. They had
but one answer to both: —“ If you are not satisfied, why do you not leave the diggings?” The callous indifference of the
authorities culminated eventually, in what at one time threatened a serious collision with the people. They gave way
at last when the danger became imminent, and set to work surveying townships and agricultural lands, forming roads
and constructing bridges on the routes leading to the mining centres, and by the end of ’54 the nomadic hordes
wandering from place to place on the goldfields began to assume the character of settled communities, who have since
that period built towns, which, for architectural beauty and the possession of all the conveniences of civilized life,
successfully vie with many of the chief cities of Europe. The first buildings erected after the town was laid out,
principally consisted of wood or iron ; both materials, owing to the difficulties of carriage, were extremely costly. The
timber used in the first hotel opened is computed to have cost 2s. fid. per foot for every particle used. But the receipts
were almost fabulous in amount, as much as £7OO having been taken over the bar in a single day. Iron
and wood gradually gave place to stone and brick, and Sandhurst, now the chief town of the district, is
unquestionably a very fine city. Crime in the early days of the diggings, considering the heterogeneous and polyglot
character of the population, every civilized race and nationality being represented, the Hindoo, Persian and Japanese
only excepted, was but comparatively trifling. The time of the police was chiefly occupied in collecting revenue in the
form of a poll tax, known as the Goldfields License, which was assessed at 30s. per month for every inhabitant over the
age of fourteen years, and in the suppression of the sale of spirituous and fermented liquors, which constituted an offence
only because it was mala prohibita. The actual malum in se was confined principally to the robbery of tents and stores,
the stealing of horses and cattle, and robbery from the person accompanied with violence, the which latter offences were
principally perpetrated by the criminal classes who had come from the neighbouring penal settlements of Tasmania and
New South Wales.
Simultaneously with the improvement in the character of the business premises and dwellings of the inhabitants,
came the improvement in the appliances used for the extraction of gold from the alluvial soil, and the tub and cradle
were susperseded by the puddling mill and sluice. The alluvial mining attained its most productive period in ’56, at which
time some 2,000 machines were at work on the field, and it probably was the most generally prosperous period in the
history of Sandhurst; from this date the alluvial workings began to exhibit signs of exhaustion, and although quartz
mining had been engaged in to a considerable extent, it assumed nothing like the proportions it attained to some ten
years later, and which it continues to do to the present moment. The halcyon days of this latter branch of mining were
in ’7O and two or three following years, when the Garden Gully and the Hustlers’ lines were in full work, these lodes having
proved the richest among those at present in work. The streets of the city are wide and well formed, and lighted with
gas by a private company established nearly twenty years since. The Coliban water scheme furnishes the town and
neighbourhood with an abundant supply of this essential element. The public buildings, charitable, literary and
scientific institutions, public schools and banks, amounting to nearly a score in number, are mostly very fine buildings, and
those of a private character devoted either to business purposes or for residence are very creditable structures; irrespective
of these, the country for a radius of twenty miles has been dotted over with a number of less pretentious towns and villages,
where the public school is everywhere conspicuous. The early pioneers are rapidly giving place to the new generation,
grown or growing up, but a few of the old identities still survive, among whom may be numbered the Rev. James Nish,
Presbyterian minister; D. C. SterryandW. P. Simpson, members for the Province; John Mclntyre, the member for
Maldon; W. D. C. Denovan, the town clerk; E. J. White, of the Melbourne Observatory; Arthur Lloyd and Robert
Haverfield, the first proprietors and the editor of the oldest local newspaper; David Guthrie, the founder of the Epsom


Potteries; Dr. James Boyd, James Buick, Joseph Henry Abbott, Nelson Jones, conspicuous as successful professional
or business men ; Geo. Lansell, Jonathan Latham, G. E. Wells and J. B. Watson, among the pioneers of the mining
industry; and Geo. Edw. Thomson, solicitor, who was among the foremost men in the first goldfields agitation; all of these
have in turn rendered good service to the state in one capacity or another. Yield of gold during the period since its first
discovery:—This cannot be stated with any degree of accuracy. The official returns, as far as they have been kept,
place the amount at fifty-seven millions, but a considerable amount never went through that channel, and probably
the real quantity is nearer sixty millions of pounds sterling in value.
THE LAW INSTITUTE OF VICTORIA.
of the necessities arising out of the great advance made during this century in every department
||pl«|jH of human knowledge and activity, is that of the formation of a community, sharing the
T - same ideas professionally, and pursuing similar occupations. Every profession nowadays
has its association, as every trade has its union, the only difference being that the professions congregate
for the purpose of eliminating erroneous notions and with the object of enlarging their sphere of knowledge,
whereas the trades band together for the sake of a defence of their rights, and the resistance of the tyranny
of capital. It might be just as well, when speaking of the trades, to make an effort to correct what they erroneously
assume as their distinctive title, and on which they base a strong claim for sympathy to be extended towards them.
It is this—they call themselves working men. Why, there is not an artisan the wide world over, works as hard or earns
his bread more truly by the sweat of his brow than the professional man. He is the working man ; for that which has
command over him he must command and subdue to his will, so that it obey him, in the same abject manner as the
slave who falls down before an Eastern despot. The brain, which is the seat of all sensation, he must guide, and from
his inner consciousness evolve those ideas which modify, alter, improve, or destroy what at present exists. He produces
the model, and it only remains for manual skill with the expenditure of a disproportionately little thought to execute the
cast. That profound philosopher—Goethe—said “It is so easy to act, it is so hard to think ; ” in other words, it is a
very easy matter to employ your hands, but it is a very difficult matter to use your brains, which comes to the same
thing as saying that the professional man is a much harder working man than the so-called working man. Having
now, as we believe, demolished this absurd idea, let us return to our subject. Since it has been found necessary, and for
the mutual advantage of the individuals of a particular vocation, to establish an association, it could hardly be expected
that the legal profession would overlook the benefits arising therefrom. Hence, we have “ The Law Institute of
Victoria,” which was formed to create a body elected from amongst the practitioners themselves, for the purpose of
representing generally their views and wishes, and of affording greater opportunities for the continuous acquirement and
diffusion of legal knowledge. It has also for its object the preservation and maintenance of the integrity of the Attorney’s
branch of the profession. It undertakes to watch proposed changes, and aid reforms in the law likely to be beneficial,
and to suppress any illegal and dishonourable practice. These are its objects from a legal standpoint; but it does not
overlook moral and social considerations, for it endeavours to promote good feeling and encourage proper conduct amongst
the members of the professions, as well as to afford means of reference for the amiable settlement of professional
differences. In addition to these advantages, the Law Institute was established to consider and determine upon all
matters likely to affect the interests and prosperity of the profession generally.
Having stated the principles on which the Law Institute was founded, we shall now give a brief history of its
birth and early days. The origin of the proposal to form a Law Institute for Victoria was that about the beginning of
December, 1858, the Court (in banco) expressed regret that the Law Society was no longer in existence in the colony.
This sentiment caused, within a few days afterwards, a very active member, and one of the ex-officers of the late Law
Society, to take occasion to address the Court. In temperate and gentlemanly language he stated that one principal
cause of the failure of that Society was the position in which it had stood with reference to the Bench, and particularly
to the absence of all countenance by the Court. He was convinced that now that the profession had been made aware of


the desire of the Court for such a society, the solicitors would at once take action and form one. The Bench, although
the remarks of this gentleman were listened to with attention, made no observations thereon. Shortly afterwards,
several solicitors, who had been members of the late Society, and who were extremely anxious that another attempt be
made to establish an Institute such as the Bench would approve and the professions support, mentioned, in a
conversation with Mr. South, what had already transpired.
In consequence of this conversation, the preliminary meeting of January 24 was called, and attended, although
the weather was extremely oppressive, by sixteen attorneys, who formed themselves into a provisional committee for the
purpose of further considering the question, Mr. S. M. South acting as chairman, and Mr. E. Sandford as honoiaiy
secretary. The utter impossibility of withstanding the heat led to no more business being transacted at this meeting. At
the next meeting of the Provisional Committee, held on January 31, a unanimous resolution was passed as to the
desirability of the formation of a law association in Victoria, and that its objects should assimilate as nearly as practicable
with those of the Incorporated Law Society of London. At this meeting a sub-committee, consisting of Messrs. South,
Trenchard, Sandford, Bronckhorst, and Malleson, was appointed to draw up a prospectus and rules, which were submitted
by Mr. Trenchard, chairman of sub-committee, at the next meeting held on the 14th February. This gentleman was
complimented for having given a very great deal of attention to the subject, and for the able manner in which he had prepared
the draft, which was amended and passed by the provisional committee. A copy was forwarded by the honorary
secretary to every admitted attorney in the colony, 140 copies being transmitted to Melbourne attorneys, and 04 to those
in the country. Each of their Honours, the Judges, also received a copy, of which they acknowledged the receipt, and
fully approved of the movement. The letters from the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Molesworth contained suggestions
that solicitors practising in the country should be allowed to vote by proxy, and should be eligible as Members of
Council. At this meeting it was also stated that the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General heartily commended the
establishment of the proposed Institute. The provisional committee on March 8 having made the above statement, then
rendered up their trust to the meeting, which proceeded to the amendment of the rules. A ballot was taken on March
22, 1859, by black and white papers placed in a balloting-box, and resulted in the election of the following twenty-six
gentlemen, who were, consequently, the first members of the present thriving institute: Messrs. R. S. Anderson, W.
Attenborough, J. B. Bennett, K. E. Brodribb, H. J. Chambers, C. Cresswell, Thomas Crisp, R. Finlay, T. P. Fleetwood,
T. Hancock, G. A. Jeffery, J. Madden, Thomas Miles, F. G. Moule, J. Macgregor, J. J. McCormick, D. Ogilvy, P. A. C.
O’Farrell, E. Sandford, E. B. W. Sandwell, C. Shaw, S. M. South, C. Steadman, T. Hamlet Taylor, J. Trenchard, and
Thomas Wilson. At the first quarterly meeting held on April 26, 1859, the number of members was reported to have
increased to forty-six; while at the same time there was a list of twenty-four candidates awaiting election.
The receipts amounted up to the date of the meeting to £376 195., and the expenditure was £llß 3s. 9d., thus
leaving a balance to the credit of the Institute of £258 15s. 3d. At the same time the first Council was elected, and held
its first meeting on May sth. The following is a list of its members President, Mr. D. Ogilvy. Vice-Presidents, Mr.
J. B. Bennett, Mr. John Clarke. Committee, Mr. E. Sandford, Mr. J. Trenchard, Mr. F. G. Moule, Mr. R. S. Anderson,
Mr. Henry Jennings, Mr. T. Hamlet Taylor, Mr. E. Klingender, Mr. E. B. W. Sandwell, Mr. S. M. South. At the present
time the Law Institute has about 120 members, governed by a Council, consisting of President, Vice-President, and
Committee. President, F. Madden. Vice-President, J. G. Duffy, M.L.A. Committee, J. M. Davies ;F. G. Moule; W.

THE CHURCHES IN VICTORIA.
THE CHUECH OF ENGLAND.
great P ro £ ress a-nd prosperity of Great Britian is due, not only to the enterprise of her people, but is
a * so attributed to their strong attachment to the religion of their fathers. No country can enjoy that
happiness which is true greatness that does not bow down to the Almighty. The laxity of public morals in
the early history of the Australian settlements was very conspicious, but it was in the nature of things
when we consider to what class the majority of the first and many subsequent arrivals belonged. Although the
accessions to the populations of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land even in early times, were occasionally of a
more virtuous class, yet their influence was neutralized by forces then at work. During the past twenty-five years the
earnestness displayed by the clergy of the Old Country has been communicated to the colonies. Hence we see a marked
improvement in the religious attitude of the colonies. We propose to consider the history of the rise of successive
denominations, and first, we may mention that for years after the first ship reached New South Wales, that colony was
without a sacred edifice, but eventually succeeded in erecting a wretched structure at a cost of <£4o. Port Phillip in this
respect was somewhat better provided for, although a few only manifested any interest. At the formation of Batman’s
Association, a resolution was adopted to the effect that none but married servants be employed, and that a cat' chist be
appointed and supported. We have alluded in the historical part of Port Phillip, properly speaking, to the arrival of Dr.
Thomson in the capacity of surgeon to the company. This gentleman was nominated as Catechist, and subsequently
held service by the Yarra The first public religious service took place in Melbourne in April, 1836, when the Eev. Mr.
Orton, W esleyan minister, of Van Diemen’s Land, read the Church of England service to a congregation which occupied
seats placed under the she-oak trees on the eastern slope of Batman’s Hill. This hill—used by geographers for
the purpose of determining the latitude and longitude of Melbourne —was, in the year 1870, levelled to give increased
accommodation at the Spencer-street railway terminus.
Mr. Orton, together with Mr. James Simpson, late police magistrate of Campbolltown, Van Diemen’s Land, Major
Welman and his sou, were fellow passengers with Mr. Batman, who was returning to Port Phillip, accompanied by his
wife and family, and the governess. Miss Caroline Neweome, in the “ Caledonia.” The congregation consisted of this party,
and the shepherds and farm servants in the employ of Mr. Batman. The group must have been a very picturesque one,
a considerable number of the Port Phillip aborigines of both sexes being present, and watching with astonishment the
entire proceedings. Perhaps the most interesting feature in the scene was the entrance of the Sydney natives, who had
played no unimportant part in the discovery of the colony. These smart fellows, dressed in red shirts, clean white
jackets and white trousers, and black kerchiefs round their necks, afforded a striking and romantic background to this,
the first body in Port Phillip which w rshipped God in the tongue of the mother country. The mise en scene was
completed by the chief at the head of the Sydney natives, in a scarlet coat and military pantaloons, cocked hat and
feather, breastplate and gorget, the gift of Colonel Sir George Arthur, then Governor of Van Diemen’s Land. The service
commenced in the usual way, by Mr. Orton reading the sentences, the exhortation, the general confession, and so forth, Mr.
Simpson giving the responses, while the chants and hymns were pitched by Dr. Thomson. Mr. Orton preached from the
text— “ Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God,” and dwelt on the necessity of a thoroughly new life,
as the only means of seeing the spiritual kingdom. For some time after this. Captain Lonsdale, the police magistrate,
read the Church of England service every Sunday at the primitive court house, situated near the south-west corner of
William and Bourke-streets. At that period a sheepfold stood on the site of the present St, James’s Church, close to
which a building solely appropriated to religious services was erected. Among the subscriptions received for this object
was the sum of fifty pounds from Mr. Batman. This little wooden building, with its old ship’s bell to knoll to church,
though ostensibly for the Church of England, was occasionally used in the afternoons by other denominations. The
convicts, who had, according to law, to attend public worship, were stationed on one side; and in the opposite corner,
screened by a curtain, were placed the singers. On November 10, 1837, Messrs. James Backhouse and Geo. Washington
Walker, Quaker missionaries, arrived at Port Phillip, in the “ Edora,” and were offered the use of this first place of
worship. They preached also at the aboriginal station on the Yarra Yarra, then in charge of Mr. George Langhorne.


That important factor in the church’s increase, a Sunday-school, was, at an early period of our narrative, organised. At a
meeting held on July 30, 1838, it was resolved to raise .£2OO, with the hope of obtaining assistance from the Government,
for the purpose of procuring the services of a clergyman, Messrs. Welsh, Rucker, and Fawkner were appointed to receive
subscriptions. In November, 1838, tenders were called for repairs to the existing fabric, which, through the want of
interest displayed, were not completed until the end of February, and merely consisted of a cedar pulpit and eight cedar
pews. Many, willing to attend, could not be accommodated, but, in 1839, on the election of Messrs. Rucker and Welsh as
churchwardens, fresh life was imparted to the movement. The first Church of England clergyman, the Rev. J. C. Grylls,
licensed by Bishop Broughton for the Port Phillip Settlement, on September 10, 1838, arrived from Sydney on October
12 of the same year. The barque “Denmark Hill,” Dawberry, master, may be said to have carried the pulpit and the
press to the colony of Victoria, since by her came, at the same time, Mr, Grylls, and the printing establishment of Messrs.
Arden and Strode, for the first legalised newspaper in Victoria, the Gazette. The first sermon preached by Mr. Grylls in
his new charge was, “ I desire to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” This clergyman is said
to have been of a quiet and amiable disposition, and to have gained the good will of the people by his consistent behaviour.
On his obtaining twelve months' leave of absence, his congregation presented him with a handsome testimonial. Mr. James
Smith, who had acted as lay helper at the missionary establishment for the blacks upon the Yarra, after the departure of
Mr. George Langhome, was, in May, 1839, appointed by Bishop Broughton, as a lay-reader to conduct services at
Williamstown, which had not yet received any attention. The second large donation to the Church of England in Victoria,
was that of Mr. Campbell, of Sydney, who gave .£IOO and 50 acres of land for a glebe. The stipend paid to the minister
by Government at this time was £2OO. To discourage attempts to rely on the Government for pecuniary aid, and to
discountenance a number of small congregations springing up, regulations were issued in the month of February, 1839,
that no grant be allowed for a place of worship or pastor’s house, until the sum of £3OO had been subscribed and paid;
and that no allowance for a minister’s salary would be granted until at least one hundred adults attended his services.
In September, 1839, owing to the church building fund not being sufficiently large, it was decided not to attempt the
erection of the whole of St. James’s Church, according to the plan, but to begin the nave, the foundation-stone of which
was laid on November 9, 1839, by the Superintendent of Port Phillip, Mr. Latrobe, who had recently arrived.
About March, 1841, the division of Melbourne into two parishes was sanctioned by the Anglican Bishop of
Australia, who suggested that one parish should be under the pastoral superintendence of the Rev. Mr. Wilson, and the
other under that of the Rev. Mr. Thomson. These were the only Church of England clergymen in Melbourne in those
days. St. James’s Church was at the time of which we are writing in an unfinished condition. Having briefly indicated
the early history of the Anglican Church in Victoria, we must relegate to church historians the task of writing an extensive
account of the many important changes that have taken place since 1841 in her growth. We shall, therefore, content
ourselves by giving a summary of the salient points in her history from that date up to the end of the year 1887. The
bishop, first tie Right Rev. Dr. Perry, was consecrated for the diocese of Melbourne on June 29, 1847. He arrived in
the colony on January 23, 1848, and was installed on February 13, 1848.
The first ordination held in Melbourne took place on June 25, 1848, and the rite of confirmation was for the first
time celebrated on October 16 of the same year, when eighty-seven candidates were presented. The first church
consecrated in the colony vas that of St. Peter’s, East Melbourne, on March 29, 1853. The Right Rev. Dr. Samuel
Thornton was consecrated on May 1, 1875, in Westminster Abbey, as the first Bishop of Ballarat, and arrived in Melbourne
in August, 1875, to take charge of his diocese, which had been formed by dividing the original diocese into two portions.
On April 29, 1876, Dr. Perry, Bishop of Melbourne, resigned his see, to which the Right Rev. Dr. James Moorhouse
succeeded, and was installed at St. James's Cathedral on January 7, 1877. It was in November of the latter year that the
Church Assembly, after much discussion as to the suitability of the place to be selected, decided to erect an Anglican
cathedral on the site of St. Paul’s Church, Swanston-street, Melbourne. This noble building is gradually approaching
completion, sufficient to allow of its being used for public worship. Dr. Moorhouse resigned in March, 1886 his
successor, who arrived and was installed in March of 1887, being the Right Rev. Dr. Field Flowers Goe.
Special Thanksgiving Services, in connection with an important event—the Centenary of the Colonial Episcopate—
were held at Holy Trinity Church. Balaclava, in the morning, and at St. John’s, Melbourne, on the evening of August
12, 1887. The Bishop of Melbourne, Dr. Field Flowers Goe, preached on both occasions. This day was the anniversary
of the consecration of the first colonial bishop, as it was on August 12, 1787, that the Rev. Charles Inglis, incumbent of
St. Paul’s Church, New York, was consecrated the “first Bishop of Nova Scotia and the first Bishop of the Colonial
Empire.”
According to the latest returns which we could procure, it appears that in 1885 the number of clergy and lay
readers holding licences was 194, and the number of services performed, 44,785. " J
The Church of England used in the same year 841 churches and other buildings for public worship givin-
accommodation to 96,926 people, the average attendance at the principal service being 58,104.


THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
This is the name generally given to that numerous body of Christians who acknowledge the Pope, not as the
Encyclopedia Britannica puts it, as the head of their church —a phrase which is misleading and liable to be miscon-
strued —but as the temporal and spiritual head. The number of Roman Catholics throughout the world is variously
estimated, some statisticians placing it at 218,000,000. Prom the propaganda returns it would appear that in Europe
there are 150,584,050; in Asia 8,311,800; in Africa 2,656,205; in both Americas 51,422,566; in Australia and adjacent
islands 443,442. This gives a total of 213,518,063. This computation is based upon the returns of a few years ago, and
it is quite possible that the number at the present time exceeds by two millions the total as given by the tables. Of the
countries in Europe, according to Dr. Hugo Franz Brachelli, chief of the Austrian Statistical Department, France had,
in 1884, the largest number of Roman Cath01ic5—35,387,703, whilst Italy came next in the list with 26,658,679, and
Spain and Portugal out of a population of 21,164,380 claimed 21,148,880 adherents to the Roman Catholic Church. It
is to be regretted that, owing to the inability of the gentlemen on whom the writer called to give him details, that a
satisfactory account of this historic church cannot be given in these pages. We can only say that this church is well
represented in the colonies, and especially so in Victoria, its members here as elsewhere adhering to the tenets of their
faith with that remarkable and simple zeal for which they are distinguished throughout the world. On October 4, 1841,
the foundation stone of St. Francis’ Roman Catholic Church, Melbourne, was laid, and exactly four years afterwards, to
the day it was opened. In 1858 that noble structure which adorns Eastern Hill was commenced. Its extreme
length is 345 feet, its two towers are 226 feet in height, while the lantern tower and spire is 330 feet from the ground.
The width of the nave is 76 feet, and its transepts measure 160 feet.
A strange circumstance in the history of Roman Catholicism in Australia happened in New South Wales, where a
Government order appeared in the Sydney Gazette calling on all professing the Roman Catholic religion throughout
New South Wales to attend at Government House, Parramatta, on April 20, 1803, and on April 21 regulations for the
services were published. The first meeting for Roman Catholic worship in Australia was held in Sydney on May 15, 1803,
when the Rev. Father Dixon conducted divine service. At the present time the temporal head of the church in Victoria
is Archbishop Carr, the successor of the Rev. James Alipius Goold, who was consecrated in 1848 as the first archbishop,
Melbourne having been declared an archbishopric in May 4, 1874.
The former-named prelate arrived in Melbourne on Saturday, June 11, 1887, which was a day of rejoicing among
the Roman Catholic community in Melbourne, although to some extent it was a day of sorrow, as it was the anniversary
of the death of Archbishop Goold, which occurred on June 11,1886. Archbishop Goold’s work was of a different nature to
that to which the present prelate must give his attention, but although sowing the seed is difficult, yet we must also aver
that gathering in the harvest requires wisdom. Archbishop Goold planted the Church of Rome in Victoria, and Arch-
bishop Carr will, we have no doubt, look after the spiritual welfare of those, many of whom for forty years were under
the control of Dr. James Alipius Goold.
THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH,
The Presbyterian Church in the colony of Victoria has an honourable history, and the ministers have been noted
for their strict adherence to the doctrine of Presbyterianism. The Rev. James Clow, of the Honourable East India
Company’s service, was the first clergyman who preached that doctrine in Victoria, an event which occurred in 1838,
and which makes the Presbyterian Church of Victoria just fifty years old. For the observance of the Jubilee year,
<£35,000 have been already received. The fund was started at the General Assembly in 1885, when it was proposed to
endeavour to collect <£oo,ooo by November, 1888. Considering the depression existing in the squatting districts, the
amount already received is very gratifying, and it is fully believed that the total amount will be raised. The report of
the Jubilee Fund Committee states that—“ In resolving to invite the members and adherents of the Church to unite in
raising this fund, the Assembly had two things in view. First, it was thought that this was a fitting way in which to
testify our gratitude to God for His great goodness to us as a church and as individuals during these many years. And,
secondly, it was thought that the raising of such a fund would greatly help us in securing the more efficient and more
extensive preaching of that Gospel which ‘proclaims liberty to the captive, and the opening of the prison to them that
are bound.’ In this way the fiftieth year of our existence would be a year of Jubilee in the highest and best sense of
the word,” The sum when raised will strengthen the sustentation fund, and enable the assembly to extend the church
in destitute districts, and free new nd weak congregations from a burden of debt. Although the account of
Mrs. Hamilton, one of Mr. Clow’s daughters, is that her father preached his first sermon in Port Phillip on the last
Sunday of 1837 ; yet his regular work of preaching did not begin until 1838, and therefore it is correct to say that the
Presbyterian Church of Victoria will have completed the fiftieth year of her existence in the year 1888.


The names of the principal officers are as follow :—The Moderator, Rev. John G. Paton; Clerk of assembly, Rev.
Dr. Nish; Convener of Home Mission Committee, Rev. A. Yule ; Convener of the Heathen Missions Committee, Rev. A.
Hardy; and the Convener of the Ladies’ College and Scotch College, the Hon. Francis Ormond, M.L.C.
The professors at the Theological Hall are Rev. D. Mac Donald, D.D., and the Rev. J. Rentoul, D D.; while the
Convener of the Committee is the Rev. Dr. Campbell. Dr. A. Morrison acts as Convener of the Ormond College Council.
The Widows and Orphans’ Fund Committee is attended to by the Rev D. Mac Donald, D.D., and that of the Infirm
Ministers’ Fund by Rev. John Clark. The Jubilee Fund Committee has for its Convener Rev. D. S. McEachran, and the
Allan Bequest Fund, the Rev D. Mac Donald, D.D. This last-named fund is so called from the late Robert Allan, Esq., of
Buninyong, who died in 1878, having bequeathed the large sum of £, 11,000 to the Presbyterian Church on certain
conditions, one of which was the introduction of the shorter Catechism. If they would not accept the conditions, the
offer would be made to the Wesleyan Church, and if they also refused to carry out the scheme, the Ballarat charities
should bo the recipients. After much debate the Presbyterian Assembly decided on accepting the offer, and, in 1886, the
legacy was handed to the church We may mention here that Mr. A. L Pryde is general secretary of aU the committees
in connection with the Presbyterian Church, which is gradually on the increase throughout the colony, the members in
regular attendance being about 70,000, the Sunday-school scholars 22,000, and teachers 2350.
THE WESLEYAN METHODIST CHURCH.
Wesleyan Methodism dates back to the year 1739, a period not embracing quite a century and a half, but this
brief period of existence, in comparison with that of other denominations, enhances the value of the work accomplish* d
by this religious body, and renders its history most interesting. The Revs. John and Charles Wesley were the founders
of what is known as Wesleyan Methodism. The principal events in the Methodist calendar are the conversion of John
and Charles Wesley to that doctrine, known as justification by faith alone, which they preached so earnestly as to attract
numbers of hearers, the majority of whom formed themselves into societies. To have the oversight of these societies
the Methodist pastorate was organised and enrolled by the Deed of Declaration. Subsequently many agencies and
institutions, not altogether peculiar to Methodism, were called into existence, such as the local preacher, the leader, the
class meeting, tlie lovefeast, &c. The death of John Wesley and the formation of the Missionary Society in 1813, are also
two of the chief landmarks in the history of Methodism. The missionary spirit of Methodism does not, however, date
from that year, since from the first it had been characterised by a desire to exhibit to those outside the British Islands,
sitting in darkness, the lamp of salvation. Its Foreign Missions may be said to have begun in 1769, where the first
public collection in the Conference at Leeds took place, and its first agents, Messrs. Broadman and Pilmour, were sent
from British shores. Their missions were for a long time under the charge of Dr. Coke, but the period, just subsequent
to his decease and the immediate formation of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, may be said to be the birth
of Australian Methodism. The first authorised Methodist agent sent to Australia by the Missionary Society was the Rev.
Samuel Leigh, who landed in Sydney in 1815, to whose labours and those of his immediate fellow-helpers, is due the
planting of the early Methodism of New South Wales and Tasmania. The Methodism of Victoria must be regarded as the
offspring of these parents. Although the first religious service held on the shores of Port Phillip was conducted by the
Rev. Robert Knopwood, chaplain of Lieutenant-Colonel Collins’ expedition on the 23rd October, 1803, at Point Nepean,
now called Sorrento, yet since the settlement was abandoned, and removed to Hobart Town, it cannot be claimed that
the Church of England was the first to disseminate the facts of eternity to the residents of Australia Felix. On the
other hand it may be stated that the Rev. Joseph Orton, who came from Tasmania in company with Mr. Batman, in
April, 183G, when the latter gentleman was bringing over his family, conducted divine service on the 24th of that month,
according to the rites and ceremonies of the Anglican Church. That church can therefore say, “Granted we were not the
pioneers, still you must admit that from the lips of one of your own men, that method of worship to which we give our
adherence was the first practised in Australia.” However, dismissing all considerations of this nature—considerations which
should not be entertained in a book of this character, aiming as it does to give an impartial history of the colony—let us pass
on to the bare historical facts of Methodism in Victoria. Among the earliest settlers in Port Phillip were some Methodist
families. About the beginning of 1837, these formed themselves into a society, which consisted of Mr. George Lilly, Mr.
J. J. Peers, Mr. W. Witton, Mr. Thomas Jennings, and one or two others. In March, 1837, the society consisted of the
significant number of seven, cut of which Mr. Witton was chosen as leader. It may be interesting to give our readers
the memorandum concerning the rise of Wesleyan Methodism in Melbourne, which is entered in the minute book of the
Melbourne quarterly meeting and reads as follows “The nucleus of the Wesleyan Methodist Society was formed by a
few members who emigrated from Tasmania about the latter end of 1836 and the beginning of 1837, consisting of Mr.
George Lilly, Mr. J. J. Peers, Mr. W, Witton, and a few others who, after their landing on these shores, availed
themselves of the advantages of Christian Communion; for which purposes, as well as for holding prayer meetings and


other religious services, they met at stated periods in a wattle and daub hut. Soon after the arrival of Mr. W. Witton,
in March, 1837, by mutual consent, he was appointed to take charge of the members, then seven in number, of which he
became their recognised leader.” Mr. Peers, who was an enthusiast in music, led the singing at the first Wesleyan
Church erected in the colony, a small brick building 30 feet by 16 feet, at the corner of Swanston street and Flinders
lane, and at the same time bore the first outlay of expense, on the understanding that he should be reimbursed when
the congregation had increased to such numbers as to render it necessary to erect a more commodious place of worship.
It has been claimed that the brick church was the first place of worship erected in this colony, but this is not historically
accurate, since there was a wooden structure roared in 1837, near where St. James s Church now stands, for a similar
object. This latter building was not, however, exclusively used by one denomination, and although regarded as
belonging to the Church of England, was open in the afternoon to the ministry of other religious creeds.
When this denomination built a new and larger church in Collins-street, their first edifice was transformed into a
cottage, subsequently becoming the kitchen of the Queen’s Arms Hotel, and still forming a portion of those piemises. riiio
church also becoming too small, and the majority of the population being westward of Swanston-street, application was
made to the Sydney Government for the grant of half-an-acre of land at the north-west corner of Collins and Queen streets,
which had been bought by a gentleman in Sydney for <£4o, who forfeited his deposit of <£l in preference to completing
his purchase. On the refusal of the Sydney Government to secure this piece of land for the purpose of a chapel until
funds to the amount of ,£3OO had been actually raised and deposited in the bank, Messrs. Peers, Lilley, Jennings, Witton,
Thorpe, and Willoughby volunteered to raise, by the second Tuesday in January, 1840, ,£SO each. This having been
accomplished, no time was lost in commencing building operations, the foundation-stone being laid by the Eev. Benjamin
Hurst on May 11, 1840. The edifice was of brick, the dimensions were 47 x 57, and the design, which was Gothic, was
prepared by Mr. Peers. The church was opened on June 24, 1841, when services were held, the Eev. J. Waterfield,
of the Independent Church, and the Eev. S. Wilkinson officiating in the morning; and the Eev. Joseph Orton in the
evening. The services on Sunday, 27th, were entrusted to the Eev. P. Tuckfield in the morning, and the Eev. James
Forbes in the evening, the latter gentleman being the minister of the Scots’ Church. The collections at these services
amounted to ,£ll2 14s. The building was to cost, when completed, £3OOO, of which £IOOO was given by the
Government, £I2OO contributed, and £3OO promised, a deficit thereby of £SOO being left. This church which was, in
1849, lengthened 30 feet, according to the original design, was pulled down, and some of the materials were used in the
erection of the North Melbourne church. In 1857 the land was sold for £40,000, with a portion of which the Lonsdale-street
church and premises were built. The foundation-stone of this church was laid by Sir Henry Barkly on December 2, 1807,
and the church itself pulled down subsequently, some of the materials being used in the erection of the North Melbourne
(or Hotham) church. On the site of the church the Bank of Australasia now stands j on that of the parsonage is built
the Australian Alliance Company, and on that of the school in Queen-street the Eoyal Insurance Company have reared
their offices. At the first quarterly meeting, which was held on January 28, 1840, the number of members said to
represent the body was 1C 9. The first resident Wesleyan minister in Melbourne was the Eev. Samuel Wilkinson, who
arrived from Sydney in April, 1841, and was succeeded in 1842 by the Eev. W. Schofield, the latter gentleman s place,
on his removal to New South Wales, being supplied, in 1845, by the Eev. Edward Sweetman. At the end of this year
the number of members crept up to 359, with 17 on probation. The circuit plan of the period shows how rapidly the
population was spreading in various directions, as the names of Eichmond, St. Kilda, Brighton, Newtown (now
Collingwood,) Brunswick, Pentridge, and Williamstown appear thereon.
In 1850 Mr. Sweetman was succeeded by the Eev. W. Butters, who is now a supernumerary in London, Since the
population began to scatter, it was necessary to provide for the spiritual wants of the colonists a task which the
Wesleyan Church undertook with great success,by appointing the Eev. Samuel Waterhouse as a “Bush Missionary” to
preach the gospel to those outside the pale of what may be called by comparison—civilisation. The greatest strain on
their resources was felt when the gold era took place, but the peculiar organisation of Methodism proved itself equal to
the occasion. The young church was sixteen years old, and it had only five ministers, so that it was impossible to leave
the congregations in the settled towns, especially as almost all the local preachers had rushed off to the goldfields.
Occasional services were, however, held by the Eevs. W. Butters and J. Harcourt at Mount Alexander and the Eev. F.
Lewis at Mount Buninyong—these places being now known as Castlemaine and Ballarat respectively. The presence of
the local preachers, however, on the fields, proved a blessing, as they commenced and maintained regular services all
over the area then occupied by companies of gold-seekers, some of whom were gentlemen, and some most arrant
ruffians. The Eev. John C. Symonds was the first minister appointed to the goldfields, and preached his first sermon on
the first Sunday in March, 1852, at Forest Creek diggings. Mr. Draper took a tent with him, cooking utensils and other
necessary articles. Mr. Joshua Chapman was his colleague, through whose assistance, as well as that of the local
preachers, services could be held on Sundays in ten different places. When the population rushed to Sandhurst these
Evangelists followed them. The first building erected for public worship on any of the Victorian goldfields was that at
Wesley Hill, near Castlemaine. The edifice was of a very unpretentious character, being constructed of slabs and having


a canvas roof. The Wesleyans can claim, accordingly, to have sent the first resident minister to the goldfields, and have
built the first place of worship on the goldfields. There were ministers of other churches there at the time of which we
are writing, one of whom is the well-known J. H. Gregory, Incumbent of All Saints, St. Kilda, and who preached in
those roaring times at Old Post Office Hill, now Chewton. In connection with the history of Methodism in Victoria
we may mention that when it was impossible, owing to the great influx of population, in 1853, from all parts of the
world, to obtain dwellings, and that it was found necessary to convert schoolhouses,! vestries, and in some instances,
places of worship into dwellings, at the historic “Canvas Town,” the Wesleyan Church, ever to the fore, erected at a
cost of .£6,000, the largo wooden building, so long known in Carlton as “The Wesleyan Immigrants’ Home.”
Passing on rapidly, we can only glance at a few more particulars of this church in Victoria, as we only profess to
give a sketch and not a history of the various institutions of the colony. In 1855, when the first conference was held in
Victoria, it was reported that the Wesleyans had 31 churches, 40 other preaching places, 14 schools, used as churches;
15 ministers, 59 day-school teachers, 401 Sunday-school teachers, 151 class leaders, 1,955 church members, 84 on trial;
3,507 Sunday scholars, 3,007 day scholars, and 18,897 attendants on public worship—the population of the colony at the
time being 364,324. The statistics for 1886 show a wonderful record for half-a-century, as the Wesleyans possessed in
that year 480 churches, 123 schoolhouses, 82 parsonages, 109 ministers, 33 home missionaries, 16,095 church members,
751 local preachers, 4,691 Sunday-school teachers, 40,459 Sunday scholars, 94,223 attendants on public worship, and
two colleges.


THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS OP
VICTORIA.
THE BENEVOLENT ASYLUM.
institution, which is situated in Victoria-street, Hotham, has for its object the relief of the aged, infirm
disabled or destitute, of all creeds and nations, ar dto administer to them the comforts of religion. Such as
Infers? may be most benefited by being inmates of the Asylum are received and maintained therein. Out door relief
in kind is given to families and individuals in temporary distress, and medical assistance and medicine is afforded
through the establishment of a dispensary or otherwise. There are also facilities for religious instruction and consolation
to the inmates of the Asylum. The institution was founded on June 24, 1850, and the names of its promoters which are
inscribed on one of the two marble mural tablets in the home are as follows : —William Montgomery Bell, John Lush,
Robert Kerr, Timothy Lane. Michael Lynch, John Hood, John O’Shanassy, John Pascoe Fawkner, Rotert Balbirnie,
William O’Farrell, James Ballingall, Henry Langlands, John Thomas Smith; treasurer, Richard Grice; trustees, Chas.
Hotson Ebden, William M. Bell, and Edmund Westly; secretary, Joseph A. Marsden. Amongst the names of the donors
inscribed on these tablets is that of John Linay, a Scotchman and a bachelor, who gave the magnificent sum of £11,741
to this charity, at the same time bequeathing a similar amount to the Melbourne and Alfred Hospitals. This institution
is one of the earliest and most conspicuous landmarks of Melbourne, more especially to immigrants, who, on sailing up
the Yarra from the Bay, observe it in the distance standing out in bold relief.
An additional ward has lately been erected to accommodate fifteen males. The total number relieved during the
twelve months ending 31stDecember, 1886, was 686, comprised as follows: —Inmates on the books, 627; deaths, 84, and
departures, 75. At the end of July, 1887, there were 425 males and 217 females in the institution. About eight years
ago Mr. W. Berlin Simpson, of Collins-street, initiated a series of monthly concerts, which he personally superintends
and organises, for the inmates, and which help to cheer many a heart bowed down with woe. It is needless to state that
the gentleman’s philanthropic efforts are greatly appreciated, and to show their approval of his praiseworthy action, the
Board unanimously presented him with a life-governorship. The new site for the Benevolent Asylum at Cheltenham
contains 150 acres, and was granted by the Government. It is contemplated to commence building operations within
the next two or three years. The present site, a square block of ten acres, will either be sold or leased. It is expected
to realise between ,£BO,OOO and .£lOO,OOO, out of which the new asylum will be built, the surplus going to swell the
endowment fund, which already amounts to over ,£20,000. The superintendent and secretary at the present time is
Mr. David Grieve Stobie, to whom we are indebted for these facts. In addition to the above institution there are four
more in the colony of a kindred character distributed as follows throughout Victoria : —Beechworth, Sandhurst,
Castlemaine, and Ballarat, the last-named having a small maternity hospital attached to it.
THE HOME FOR NEGLECTED CHILDREN
In Melbourne is conducted under the auspices of the Scots’ Church Neglected Children’s Aid Society. It has been in
existence for the past six years, and during that period has, in an unobtrusive manner, carried out the admirable work of
the rescue of the little ones from lives of suffering and degradation. Four hundred children picked off the streets, or
taken out of the charge of parents incapable of bringing them up properly, have received the attention of this institution.
These children are all boarded out, for the most part, with farmers in the country. Children are received at from 2 to
14 years of age, and the cost to the society to board them out amounts to ss. weekly for each. They are first taken to
the receiving-house in Melbourne, where they are well looked after during their stay, and provided with a sufficient
putfit of clothing, which is supplied in abundance by the ladies of the committee and numerous friends,


THE HOSPITALS FOE THE INSANE,
According to the report of the inspector of asylums (Dr. T. T. Dick), presented to Parliament on August 9, 1887, show
that at the end of the year 1886 the total number of registered insane in the colony of Victoria was 3,380, the number at
the beginning of the year being 3,234, an increase of 146 having taken place during the twelve months. Of the 660
admitted in the year 1886, only 164 wore accompanied by their friends or relatives, 362 were brought by the police, and
the remainder came through the gaols, benevolent asylums, and other public institutions. From this it may be inferred
that the poorer class contribute a very large percentage to the insane asylum population. The whole number of patients
received into the insane asylums from the time they were first established in 1848 till the end of 1886, amounted to
17,016. On December 31, 1886, as previously stated, there were 3,380 registered insane persons in Victoria, out of an
estimated population of 1,033,005, or 3-27 insane persons to every 1000 of the population. The comparatively large ratio
of insanity in Victoria was accounted for in previous reports from the fact that in the early years of the colony the
exciting causes of insanity were more prevalent. If, however, Mr. J. Henniker Heaton, in his “ Australian Dictionary of
Dates,” published in 1879, is correct, a most extraordinary increase in the percentage has taken place since then, for he
calculates it at 1 in every 1,510 persons. Business worries and difficulties in securing a livelihood are distinct
provocatives to mental disease, and although a community of colonists ought to present a better record, Victoria not
only stands in a worse position than the other Australian colonies, but compares unfavourably with old and crowded
countries. There is more insanity in Victoria to the thousand than in any of the Group, while, if the comparison be
extended to some of the countries of continental Europe, an alarming disparity will be found to exist. Austria gives 1 in
1000; Italy, TO; Belgium and Holland, 1.2; whence it will be seen that Victoria, with an exhiliarating climate which
should be destructive to morbid feelings, nearly equals the four countries combined in the percentage of lunatics.
Dismissing the consideration of this question, we may state that the total expenditure of the asylums for the year was
<£101,504 3s. 5d., each patient’s maintenance rate being 10s. OJd. per week, an amount nearly approaching the rates of
the English borough and county asylums.


THE EXHIBITION BUILDING.
|B|o the remarkable diffusion of knowledge in this nineteenth century may be traced those prominent instruments
of civilisation —National and International Exhibitions. The Society of Arts originated National Exhibitions
in England, and, as far back as 1761, offered prizes for agricultural and other machines, of which an exhibition
was held in its apartments. Under the direction of the “ Little Corporal,” France, in 1748, began a series of national
expositions. The number of exhibitors at first was only 110, and a jury of nine was appointed to decide on their merits.
As an instance of the desire of Prance at the time to injure the trade of Britain, it may be stated that a gold medal
was offered to the manufacturer who should deal the heaviest blow to English commerce. The second exposition took
place in 1801, and, it proving successful, the third was fixed for 1802. Expositions were subsequently held in 18C6,
1819, 1823, 1827, 1834, 1839, 1844, and in 1849. These exhibitions, all of which were held in France, were national
displays, and it was not until 1851 that the first international exhibition was held in London. The project was the
conception of the mind of “ Albert the Good,” the late husband of our most virtuous queen, and the progenitor of a family
of admirable men and women. He is entitled to be named the Father of International Exhibitions. In 1820, a series of
exhibitions were opened in various cities in Austria, and national exhibitions were held at Vienna in 1835, 1839, and 1845.
Berlin ha.d national exhibitions in 1822, 1827, and 1824, the latter year calling together 3060 exhibitors. In 1815, 6013
exhibitors attended a national exhibition in Saxony. Between 1837 and 1848 exhibitions were held at Lausanne, Berne, St.
Gall, and Zurich in Switzerland ; between 1835 and 1850 at Brussels and Ghent in Belgium; between 1824 and 1844 at
Stockholm, in Sweden; between 1839 and 1849 at St. Petersburg, Moscow and Warsaw in Russsia. Between 1844 and 1849,
exhibitions were held at Lisbon in Portugal; between 1829 and 1855, in the kingdom of Sardinia; between 1829 and 1850
at Madrid; between 1828 and 1844, at New York and Washington in the United States. So great was the apathy and
prejudice against industrial displays in Great Britain, that when, in 1828, an exhibition was formed in London under the
patronage of George IV., it was found necessary to convert it into an unsuccessful bazaar. In Ireland, exhibitions of
native industry were held trienially, in the rooms of the Royal Dublin Society, commencing in 1829. In 1845, however,
an exhibition of manufactures held in Covent Garden, London, proved a great success, while an exposition held in
Birmingham eclipsed all attempts of that character hitherto hold in the country. It is owing, however, to the success of
the Great Exhibition—already referred to—of 1851, in London, which was held in the building erected for the purpose,
and known as the “ Crystal Palace.” that an attempt was made at a repetition of similar displays all over the world.
The estimated value of the articles exhibited, exclusive of the famous Koh-i-noor diamond, was £1,781,929. This
exhibition was opened on May 1, by Queen Victoria, in person, and closed on October 11 following, when it was found that
the receipts exceeded the expenditure by a sum of £213,305. Having traced the history of exhibitions in the nineteenth
century up to the first International Exhibition held in England, it may be interesting to retrace our steps to the earliest
date, as far as is known, when exhibitions were held. Probably the earliest mention of a local exhibition is that which
occurs in the first chapter of the Book of Esther, where Ahasuerus is described as showing the riches of his glorious
kingdom for a period of 180 days, after which all the visitors were treated to a feast, lasting for seven days. Annually
in ancient Greece, works of art and industry were exhibited, the workers in gold, silver, bronze, marble and ivory
bringing their choicest products. Specimens of the loveliest damascene work, helmets, cuirasses, shields, cuisses, and
greaves of ruddy gold, or of polished steel, inlaid with differently coloured metals, and as smooth and as bright as
silvered glass, were exposed to view.
The art of glassblowing must at that period have reached a high perfection, since it is said that the colouring of
the specimens vied in beauty and in lustre with the ruby, the amethyst, the turquoise, the emerald, the topaz, and other
precious stones, and that the vases were of such exquisite design as to reflect all the colours of the rainbow. Modern art
is content to imitate the ceramic ware, which the potters contributed, so perfect in design and ornamentation were
they. Pliny says that the textile fabrics from Patrae were sold for their weight in gold. Woollen and silk weaving,
lace-making and embroidery, were also of a very high order, as the specimens on exhibition were of the utmost fineness,
delicacy and value. The competitors did not receive medals, but he who had distinguished himself in any one branch of
industry, was maintained at the public expense in the Prytaneum. There he had for his associates the chief magistrates
of the commonwealth, and was allowed the honour of having a front seat or place at all great public spectacles
and popular assemblies. Industrial exhibitions were, not held by the Romans, who, as pointed out in our


article on the Melbourne Public Library, were of too warlike a nature to cultivate the intellectual side of their organism ;
for several centuries no vestige of any considerable manufacture can be discovered amongst them. Artisans were
kept by rich men, and kings were, even in the ninth century, content to have their clothes made by the women
upon their farms. “ The peasantry,” writes Hallam, “ must have been supplied with garments and implements of
labour by purchase ; and every town, it cannot be doubted, had its weaver, its smith, and its currier.” To the Venetians
belong the honour of having established the first great industrial exhibition of modern times. It was held on the
Island of Murano, famous for its glass manufactures, in the year 1268, and its opening was the occasion of a
magnificent pageant, at which all the trade guilds marched in procession. International fairs were held in Germany
from the thirteenth century downwards. Another exhibition of equal antiquity is held annually at Tantah, in
Lower Egypt, which outrivals in picturesqueness any international gathering in the world. Passing on to the
consideration of the Exhibition held in Melbourne in 1880, and opened to the public on October 1, we may state
that on that occasion the city appeared in the morning in holiday attire, and at an early hour the streets
presented a very busy appearance, throngs of people hastening hither and thither, flags unfurled on buildings
in all directions, while the vessels at the wharves were decorated with bunting ; volunteers rushing off to their
respective orderly-rooms, and fire brigade-men to their rendezvous on the Eastern Hill, whence they marched in
companies, preceded by bands, to the general muster at the Victoria Barracks. The Metropolitan and Southern
troops of Light Horse proceeded to Government House to act as an escort for the vice-regal party. The weather
looked threatening, but the day cleared up during the forenoon, and the “dust fiend” was not very troublesome,
as the corporation authorities gave him a good drenching That able body of men, the terror of wrong-doers,
and the admiration of respectable citizens, mustered early. Inspector Montford, with a strong body of constables
and troopers, proceeded to Victoria-street to superintend the procession of the associated trades. Inspector Green,
Sub-Inspector Lamer, and Sub-Inspector Drought, with other large contingents, took up positions round the gardens to
protect the approaches, and to prevent traffic on the adjoining streets. The naval forces, which arrived in the steamers
“Resolute,” “ Williams,” and “ Warhawk,” were met at the Queen’s Wharf by Sub-Inspector Toohey and a number of the
police. As early as 8 o’clock in the morning, large crowds had assembled in the streets, and every available spot whence the
procession could be viewed was soon occupied. The sailors, numbering 800, having been formed into battalion order,
marched by Market-street into Collins-street, and thence by Spring-street to the Exhibition. Their admirable precision
and regularity during the march evoked many congratulatory remarks. The “ Cerberus ” Brass Band led the way. Then
came the Victorian Naval Brigade, followed by detachments of sailors and marines from the Bdtish warships “ Wolverene,”
“ Cormorant,” and “ Emerald,” and of sailors from the French, German and Italian men-of-war, “ Finistere,” “ Nautilus ” and
“ Europa.” The effect of the picturesque appearance caused by the varied uniforms and soldierly bearing of all the men
in the battalion was heightened by the music contributed by a band of buglers which marched in the centre of the line.
The first Melbourne Exhibition was held in 1854, in anticipation of the Paris Exhibition of 1855. Amongst the
exhibits there was a collection of gold worth .£ 15,000. The number of entries was 428, and the site of the building was
William-street. In 1861 a second exhibition was opened in the same place, in order to prepare for the London
Exhibition of 1862. There was a marked increase in the number of entries, which amounted to 703, The first
Intercolonial Exhibition was held in 1866, preparatory to the Paris Exhibition of 1867. All the colonies, as well as
New Caledonia and Java, were represented. There were 2,956 entries, including 1,479 Victorian. The building used for
this Exhibition was afterwards converted into the Technological Museum. The number of entries at the Exhibition of
1872 was 900. Some of the goods exhibited were sent to the London Exhibition, and arrangements were made at the same
time for representing Victoria at Vienna in 1873. The second Intercolonial Exhibition was held in 1875, in order to make
preparations for the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876. New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and
Western Australia sent contributions, and Japan, for the first time, was represented in this part of the globe. The number
of exhibits was 4,289, and the space occupied 78,000 feet. The total spaces occupied in the Exhibition of 1880 are as
follows: —Ground floor, 590,614 square feet, or 13 acres, 2 roods, 2 perches; gallery floor, 44,590 square feet, equal to 1
acre; gallery wall, 62,222 square feet, equal to 1 acre, 1 rood; cellar, 5,608 square feet. The total number of square
feet occupied by Great Britain was 144,299, and that of Victoria, 135,758. The Exhibition Buildings, as they now stand,
consist of two naves or main hall, running east and west, and flanked by four picture galleries and courts underneath,
the latter being designed for the exhibition of articles of value, which did not occupy much space. The length of these
naves or main hall is 500 feet, which is the length of the building, and the width 160 feet. There are also two
permanent annexes, 460 feet long and 138 feet wide. The main hall, when not filled with exhibits, is capable of
accommodating thousands of persons. The floor galleries, which adorned the hall in 1880, were well adapted fur the
purpose for which they were designed—the exhibition of pictures, statues, and other works of art, as they were
commodious and well lighted. They were each 200 feet in length, by 30 feet in width, and 25 feet high. The total cost
of the permanent buildings was .£132,950 12s. Bd., the improvement and fencing of gardens cost j£ 18,481 4s. Bd., and the
organ was purchased and fitted up for the sum of 45560 9s. Mr. David Mitchell was the contractor for the erection of


the building, and Messrs. Reed and Barnes were the architects. The building is by far the largest in Australia, and its
massive dome now forms one of the great features of the city. The design is Italian renaissance ; its front faces
Victoria-street on the south, and in the centre is the dome, the height of which from the basement is 220 feet.
The foundation-stone was laid in Carlton Gardens on the 19th February, 1879, by His Excellency Sir George
Bowen, the then Governor of Victoria, and the building was completed on the Ist July, 1880, when the first exhibits were
admitted for the Melbourne International Exhibition, which was opened on the Ist October of the same year. Besides
the enormous quantities of bluestone used in the foundations and cellars the buildings absorbed nearly seven millions
of bricks. On Saturday, April 30, 1881, the last day of the seven months for which the Exhibition was to be open, the
attendance was satisfactoi’ily large, the returns being—single tickets, 11,014; season ticket-holders, 258: miscellaneous,
2,109; total, 13,381. The total number of those who attended the Exhibition was as follows Adults, 834,018 ; children,
(half-price) 114,986; season ticket-holders, 16,061; miscellaneous, 344,431 ; total, 1,309,496. From the official returns
supplied by Mr. Augustus Morris, Secretary of the Sydney Exhibition, the paid attendances there were as follows
Single tickets and season, 850,480; of these, 15,473 were at the rate of 2s. 6d. each. There were 16 half-crown days.
The Sydney Exhibition was open for 185 days, and the average number of paid admi-sions was 4,597 per diem. These
numb rs fall short of the attendance at the Melbourne Exhibition—the gross paid attendance amounting to 965,065,
and the daily average to 5,326. Again, the Sydney Exhibition was opened from September 17th to April 20th, or
for nearly the same number of days as the Melbourne Exhibition. For th first fortnight the rates of admission
were 2s. 6d. a day, whereas at the Melbourne Exhibition there were only three days on which the rate was above Is.
The dome of the Exhibition is the best vantage ground in Melbourne for obtaining a view of the city and its far-
extending suburbs. It is reached by a staircase, situated behind the large gilded statue of Victory, which was presented
by the German Government to the Trustees, who were the Hon. L. L. Smith, (Chairman) ; Hon. John Woods, M.L.A.,
J. R. Pincham, Esq., M.L.A., E. L. Zox, Esq., M.L.A., T. O’Grady, Esq., J.P., and His Worship the Mayor of Melbourne.
Mr. George Collins Levey, assisted by Mr. James E. Sherrard, proved a most efficient, and at the same time, courteous
secretary. The view from the dome on a clear day is not to be surpassed in any city of the Southern Hemisphere, and
visitors are often astounded at the extent of the ground seen to be occupied by habitations and factories.
The Exhibition organ is one of the great attractions in the buildings. It occupies the eastern end of the main hall,
and was built to the order of the Commissioners of the Melbourne International Exhibition by Mr. George Fincham in
1880. It has ten sounding stops and 722 pipes more than that of St. Paul’s, London, and four sounding stops and 353
pipes more than that of the Town Hall organ, Melbourne. Altogether it ranks well amongst the large organs of the
world —the largest being in Riga Cathedral, Russia, which has 124 sounding stops and 6826 pipes. In the Exhibition
organ, the organist has under his control four manuals, which comprise the grand, great swell, solo, and choir organ,
with independent pedal organ, the key action is supplied with pneumatic levers; the draw-stops are placed on either
side of the performer in circular steps, each rising step receding four inches. The draw-stop action is so constructed
that each stop can be pulled easily; and advantage has been taken to use brass squares with iron centres where necessary.
Passing over other details of this nature it may be stated that over fifty workmen were employed in its construction, and
among the woods used are those of the native blackwood, Queensland pine, Sydney pine, and the pines of Christiana,
St. John’s, the Baltic and various other places. The tone of the instrument has been pronounced by experts to be of
admirable quality, for which Mr. Fincham is to be complimented. When the building was handed over to the Trustees
on October 1, 1881, they determined to prepare a scheme for its utilisation, so that the public might have any benefit
flowing therefrom. In their first consideration of the matter, the Trustees were met with the great difficulty that the
main portion of the building had to be reserved for public purposes, such as periodical exhibitions, public ceremonials
and gatherings of the people; and the economic, technological, and fine-art collections had therefore to be relegated to the
galleries. In the eastern annexe and in a portion of the main hall space has been let to manufacturers to display their
wares and show the progress that has taken place in the development of the industries in this colony. By this means
an opportunity is afforded visitors of learning how rapidly the colony, formed only half a century ago, has advanced.
Every branch of engineering is represented—civil, electric, hydraulic, marine, and agricultural. The raw material of the
colony’s wealth —the cereals, wool, timber, mimrals, &c.—are collected in one of the galleries. Along with the grain is
shown, when obtainable, samples of the soil where it is grown, and the district where it is produced is mentioned on a
card placed with each specimen. Information of this character is invaluable to the immigrant desirous of entering into
agricultural pursuits, since he can in a few minutes obtain a knowledge of facts, which, otherwise, weeks of
investigation would fail to give him. In addition to the cereals are shown dried fruits, the preparation of which is
becoming a lucrative industry; wool from some of the best clips in the colony; prints and photographs of prize cattle
and sheep, equal to anything in the world, and a collection of all the timbers found in the colony. The botanic and
vernacular name are given in each instance, and the district whence obtained. A number of cases contain the nucleus
of an economic zoological museum. The destructive insects are preserved, with a note of the ravages they commit on
vegetation, and specimens of timbers testify to the enormous destruction constantly going on. The botanic collection is of


great interest, as in it are shown the various economic uses to which the indigenous botanic products are put. The
various kinds of timber are exhibited, made into articles of every-day use. The grazier can also learn much from the
prepared specimens which adorn the walls, while the marine architect and the enginee r will be very much benefited
by a study of the collections bearing on their respective callings. A collection of models of engineering, statuary
and works of art, the property of the Trustees, and pictures lent by a number of public-spirited gentlemen from their
private collections, are also on view. The Trustees have also established an aquarium—the first in the Southern
Hemisphere—which should prove highly instructive to even those who are not pisciculturists. Altogether in the
buildings there is much to afford pleasure, and for those seeking information on the various subjects which engage the
attention of man’s mind, a great deal to impart instruction. The Centennial International Exhibition which is to be
opened in Melbourne on August 1, 1888, for the purpose of celebrating the arrival at Port Jackson of the first white men
who remained in the country and whom many others followed, will be under the patronage of his Excellency Sir
Henry Brougham Loch, K.C.8., Governor of Victoria. The Executive Commissioners are as follows :

THE MELBOURNE HOSPITAL.
SHE word hospital, derived from the Latin ho spit alls, and to which the two French words hopital and hospice owe
S their origin, is used in the double sense of these words since there is no equivalent in English to hospice, which
means a place for permanent occupation by the poor, the infirm, the incurable or the insane; the word hopital
being usually restricted to establishments for temporary occupation by the sick and injured, for the purposes of undergoing
medical and surgical treatment. In ancient days even for sick and wounded soldiers but little provision seems to have
been made, although much is not known of the valetudinarium which appears to have existed in the Roman camp.
The monuments discovered in Great Britain, bear evidence of the Romans having a medical staff. Among the
earliest hospitals on record is that said to have been founded by Yalens in Caisarea, 370-80, A D., and the one built at
Rome by Fabiola, a Roman lady, although they were possibly, like most others of even later time, almshouses as well.
It is to the monastic arrangements for the sick and indigent that the origin of our present hospitals is traceable.
Attached to every monastry was an infirmaria, managed by an infirmarius, in which the aged, blind and weak were
housed, and the sick and convalescents treated. Perhaps the earliest distinct record of the building of an hospital occurred
in the time of tlm famous Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, who, in 1080, founded two ; one for leprosy and one for
ordinary diseases. When the Reformation took place some of the monasteries and church property were appropriated
and set apart for the use of the sick. No country in the world is so rich in charitable institutions of every description
as England and her Colonies, and there is very little doubt that hospitals were, if not the very oldest, at least among the
most ancient of English charitable institutions. The Crusaders returning from the East introduced many diseases,
which necessitated the founding of these establishments. For instance, the ravages made by leprosy alone were so great
and terrible that in France, in the year 1225, upwards of 2000 hospitals and called leprosaria were counted in France.
England also must have suffered considerably from the influx of their infectious maladies, but not to such an extent, as
the English Crusaders were less numerous. None of the leprosaria exist now in England or France, our present
hospitals being of more modern foundation.
The most ancient English hospital—St. Bartholomew —owes its origin to a priory of the same name founded about
1100 by Rahire, a minister of King Henry 11, A quarter-of-a-century later, Rahire obtained from the king the grant of a
piece of waste ground, adjoining the monastery, where he built and endowed a hospital “ for a master, brethren and sisters,
and for the entertainment of poor, diseased people till they are well.” This ancient hospital, so famous for its medical
staff, in the reign of Henry VIII., at the dissolution of the monasteries, contained 100 beds, with one physician and three
surgeons. It was refounded on a new basis in 1544, and incorporated by charter in 1546, and is one of the foremost of the
endowed charities of the mother-country, in one year affording relief to 179,153 persons.
The foregoing account of hospitals has been given in order to lead up to our subject. In 1835, when the white
occupation could be counted on one’s fingers, little or no need was felt for an institution of this kind, as the inhabitants of
Melbourne, which was then the only centre of population, were free from diseases which flesh is heir to, or the injuries
which are occasioned by accident. Dr. Cusseu, who was the first Colonial surgeon, had all cases requiring his skill
attended to at one or other licensed tavern. In Bourke-street west there was a Government Hospital, for which a small
cottage was used. Here the assigned and ticket-of-leave convicts, despatched from Sydney, were received, and
“ Old Cussen,” as he was familiarly styled, received without a murmur anyone suffering from illness in this asylum.
The population having increased in 1838-9 and 40, the mishaps inseparable from human life became more numerous,
and consequently the question arose as to the necessity of having a suitable institution for the reception of patients. In
March, 1840, an advertisement appeared in the newspapers, convening a meeting of the inhabitants to “take into
consideration the establishment of a public general hospital in Melbourne, and to adopt measures for tlm speedy erection
of the same.” Fourteen signatures were appended to the advertisement, five of which were magisterial, five medical,
three ecclesiastical, and one commercial. The meeting was held in what then was the police court, a wooden building at
the west intersection of William and Little Flinders-streets, on a corner of the Western Market Reserve. The chair was
taken by Mr. C. J. La Trobe. the Superintendent of Port Phillip. Resolutions were adopted, affirming the necessity for
the establishment of an hospital “for the purpose of affording to patients clean and comfortable accommodation, regular
medical attendance, and the means of attention to diet and regimen.” The hospital was to be named “The Melbourne
Hospital,” and was designed for the admission of contributing and non-contributing patients.


A provisional committee of nineteen members, with two honorary secretaries, to raise funds and to apply to the
Sydney Executive for a suitable building site and pecuniary aid, under certain Government regulations, promulgated on
March 1, 1839, was formed. A code of “ proposed principles,” seventeen in number, for the management of the
contemplated institution, was agreed to. It was determined to collect, if possible, .£BOO, by voluntary contributions, but
the greatest difficulty was experienced in raising even a small portion of that sum. Benevolent and amateur concerts,
theatrical performances, and house-to-house solicitations were resorted to, with but little success. Meantime cases of
exceptional necessity were admitted into a four-roomed cottage, which had to answer as an hospital, close to what
was then the General Post Office, in Chancery-lane. Notwithstanding the commercial depression that was
experienced in 1842, the hospital project was pushed on, and the subscriptions having been found to amount to .£BOO, it
was decided to apply to the Government for a subsidy and suitable site for the structure. Another public meeting was
held on April 1, when the Provisional Committee abdicated, and subscribers elected another similar body, whereupon an
appeal was made to the Government of New South Wales, to which Governor Sir George Gipps declined to accede.
This action on the part of the Governor, who not only refused to appropriate a small portion of the general revenue, but
also a single inch of unalienated Crown land, for a site to be used in the interests of so urgent and praiseworthy a
project, naturally raised a storm of indignation. The want of an hospital continuing to increase, the house in Chancery-
lane was abandoned in favour of a two storied house in Bourke-street, opposite where the St. Patrick’s Hall was
subsequently erected, but this was found inadequate to accommodate the number of patients, which was daily increasing.
In July, 1843, upon a renewed application having been made to the Government, the answer was received that no sum
larger than .£5OO could be granted by that body towards the erection of a Melbourne Hospital.
This announcement, together with many other incidents in the history of the New South Wales Government
dealings with the inhabitants of Port Phillip, served to increase the growing desire for separation. The funds received
by the collectors during 1843-4 were very small, owing to the colonies during these two years having experienced the
greatest depression known in our colonial history. Towards the close of 1844, it became so imperative to have sufficient
hospital accommodation, and knowing that an indignation public meeting would have no effect, a private convention,
including all the political and social influence of Melbourne and its vicinity, was held at the suburban residence of Dr.
J. F. Palmer. His villa was on the bank of the Yarra, then known as Burwood, but now named St. James’ Park. So
strongly did Dr. Palmer present the case of the applicants that Sir George Gipps in a few weeks afterwards intimated
through the Superintendent that the authorities would unlocse the strings of the public purse to the extent of £ 2000,
towards a hospital building fund, and that permission would be given for the selection of a suitable hospital site—
an announcement which, it cannot be doubted, nerved the collectors to make further efforts, and cheer those who were
desponding of obtaining any consideration at the hands of the Government. Much difficulty was experienced in finding a
suitable site for the Hospital, and the same number of sites as those now named for the future hospital were under
discussion. The area of land at the north-east corner of Swanston and Flinders-streets on which the Pro-Cathedral of
the Church of England now stands, and originally proclaimed as a “ Hay and Corn Market Reserve,” but abandoned for
market purposes in favour of a position at the iutersection of Elizabeth aud Yictoria-streets, was named as a fitting site.
The old reserve remained unused for several years notwithstanding the efforts of Dr. Palmer and others, who used their
utmost endeavours to have the hospital erected where the Church of England Cathedral is now in course of construction.
The other sights suggested were at the north-east corner of Latrobe and Queen-streets, the land now occupied by
the Model School on Victoria Parade, and the present site on Lonsdale-street, between Swanston and Russell-streets.
The medical commission nominated by Superintendent La Trobe, who acted on the advice of some prudent counsellors,
selected two sites, one being that on which the hospital now stands, but at the same time giving the preference to the
Hay and Corn Market Reserve. On February 5, 1845, a special meeting of contributors, including Mr. Henry Moor (the
Mayor) as chairman. Superintendent La Trobe, and the Hon. W. Jeffcott, the second resident Judge of Port Phillip, was
held in the Royal Hotel (now Union Bank), Collins-street. The committee submitted a progress report of a very
encouraging nature, and an announcement was made of the appointment of the Site-Selection Committee, and their
recommendation of the two localities best adapted for the institution. After a heated discussion as to which of the
sites should be taken, we find that on New Year’s day of 1846, there were sufficient funds in hand together with the
Government subsidy to warrant the commencement of the present erection. Tenders upon an estimate of .£1,300 were
called for, but this sum was considerably below the amount, the highest offer sent in being ,£2,021, and the lowest ,£1,797,
the latter being accepted subject to certain reductions and alterations. The original intention was to erect the building
in the cheapest style—the walls to be of plain brick, with a flooring and roofing of hardwood j but this scheme
subsequently underwent several modifications. On the 20th of March, the day on which the foundation-stone of the
Prince’s Bridge was laid, the first stone of the hospital was lowered into its proper place, according to the usage of
Freemasonry.


There is nothin" further to record in connection with the history of this building until June 16, 1847, when a
General Management Directory was appointed, consisting of those holding prominent positions in Melbourne 40 years ago.
It consisted of the following members President, His Honor Charles Joseph La Trobe; Vice-Presidents, His Honor
the Resident Judge (William A’Beckett), His Worship the Mayor (Henry Moor), Honorary Secretary, Mr. James
Montgomery; Trustees, Captain William Lonsdale, Mr. Edward Eyre Williams; Treasurers, the Rev. Adam Compton
Thomson, Mr, Edmund Westley; Committee : —Messrs. Edward Carr, Edward Eyre Williams, Robert William Pohlman,
James Frederick Palmer, George Annand, George Sinclair Brodie, John Duerdin, John Robert Murphy, Charles
Williamson, James Simpson. William Werge Howie, George Ward Cole. The election for the first Medical Staff came
off on July 15—Mr. Mayor Moor acting as returning officer. As physicians. Dr. Edmund C. Hobson was proposed by
Captain G. W. Cole, and seconded by Mr. E. Westley; Dr. Arthur O’Mullane was proposed by Captain W. J. W. Howey,
and seconded by Mr. William Kerr; Dr. Godfrey Howitt had for his proposer Mr. G. A. Gilbert, whilst Major Davidson
seconded him; all these gentlemen wore returned unopposed. The three surgeons, who were also elected without
opposition, were Mr. A. P. A. Greeves, Mr. David J. Thomas, and Mr. William Henry Campbell. Dr. Hobson, who died
on the 4th of March, 1848, and therefore had no opportunity of entering on his duties, was succeeded by Dr. W. B.
Wilmot. the first coroner of Melbourne. The resident staff consisted of a male and female—Mr. George Wilson,
dispenser, and Mrs. Jones, matron, at the annual stipend of =£Bo for the gentleman, and <£4o for the lady, including
board and lodging.
The opening day took place on March 15, 1848, when the following persons were admitted as in-patients :—Charles
Brown and William Jones; as out-patients:—Henry Johnston, Henry Thetford, Michael Jones, and John Coward. In
all, six was the number. A week afterwards the following women were admitted as in-patients :—Bridget Cole and
Eliza Price. So much for the early history of this hospital, which has now been in operation for thirty-nine years,
since when upwards of 474,000 men and 237,000 women have been received, of which number over 103,000 have been
treated as in-patients. In the year 1886, 3,791 in-patients, and 15,607 out-patients, or a total of 19,398, were treated in
the Melbourne Hospital.
In conclusion, as the name of Palmer is and will for ever be inseparably connected with the Melbourne Hospital and
its initiation, we give a copy of the two Palmer Memorial stones, one under, and the other over ground. In the hospital
foundation-stone is embedded a parchment scroll, with a Latin and English inscription, which reads as follows ;
The Foundation of the Melbourne Hospital
To be Raised and Maintained
Chiefly by the Donations and Offerings of
THE PUBLIC,
Was laid by
JAMES FREDERICK PALMER, ESQUIRE,
Mayor of the Town of Melbourne,
With the Assistance of the Ancient Fraternity of
Free and Accepted Masons,
On the 20th of March,
In the year of our Lord, 1846,
In the Ninth Year of the Reign of Victoria,
Queen of Great Britain and Ireland—
Sir George Gipps, Knight, being
Governor of New South Wales;
Charles Joseph Latrobe, Esq.,
Superintendent of Australia Felix ;
Samuel Jackson, Architect;
George Beaver, Builder.
A mural tablet, to the memory of Dr. Palmer, will be found on the right-hand side of the Entrance Hall, and
reads as follows : In
MEMORY OF
SIR JAMES FREDERICK PALMER, KNIGHT,
First President
of the
Legislative Council of Victoria.
As Mayor of Melbourne
he laid
The Foundation Stone of this Hospital,
On the 26th March, 1846.
From that time
He acted either as Member of Committee,
Vice-President, or President,
Discharging most earnestly and ably every
duty connected with the Charity, until
his death on the 23rd of April, 1871.
In Testimony of
Their high appreciation of his labours, and in
grateful remembrance of his worth,
the Contributors to the Hospital
have
Erected this Tablet.
It will be observed that the date on this mortuary tribute does not coincide with that mentioned in the body of our
sketch. The original intention was to have laid the foundation stone of the Hospital on the 26th of March, but the
Committee altered their mind, since they desired to have the inauguration of the Institution to take place on the same
day as that of the laying of the foundation stone of the Prince’s Bridge.


THE AUSTRALIAN NATIVES’ ASSOCIATION.
IWr ERn ArS the greatest characteristic of the present age, especially among civilised people, is the wonderful
PHH increase of societies or associations for all kinds of purposes. A society or association is the union of many in
one general interest, and it forms a community. Now wo speak of the association of ideas, and of the
community of ideas; accordingly we can speak of an association of men, or a community of men. In the latter case the
words are synonymous, in the former they are distinct. A community of ideas may mean ideas of a different nature, but
the association of ideas means ideas of a kindred nature. By this metaphysical phrase is meant that, were that
psychological phenomenon wanting in man, he could not produce new ideas. Where, then, many men meet together,
each of them having different notions or ideas of things, and also by the power of the association of ideas capable of
producing new ones, it follows that they will as one body, or better perhaps to say one brain, produce a better or worse
idea, but certainly an entirely different one to that which they could have done separately. We have gone thus far into
an abstruse question which it is impossible to convey in any clearer language to those who have never trod the paths of
Locke’s Intellectualism, or Kant’s Pure Reason, or Comte’s Philosophy, in order to show that societies may prove
advantageous or the reverse to their members individually and to the State at large. Societies have been formed, and
exist for nearly every variety of object. There are societies for objects scientific and literary; for objects religious and
moral, and for objects directly material, but in their results generally beneficial to mankind. There are, too, societies
detrimental to all law and order, to all progress and prosperity, to all peace and happiness. While the State cannot
prevent the latter class of societies, it at the same time refuses to countenance them, and it is only when their mischievous
doctrines are put into practical operation that an attempt is made to suppress them. The objects for which persons may
and do associate are accordingly as numerous as the objects which individuals may design to accomplish, but cannot
accomplish without uniting their efforts. The association whose name is at the head of this article has for its objects the
raising of a fund by voluntary subscriptions of members which will insure a sum of money to be paid on the death of a
member to the widow or children of the deceased, or to his executors, administrators, and assigns, for defraying the
expenses of his burial. It also insures a sum of money to be paid to a member on the death of his wife, for her burial
expenses, and for providing members with medical attendance and medicines. The latter benefits are obtainable after
payment of entrance fees. Sick pay is allowed twelve months after entrance, at the rate of J6l per week for the first six
months, ten shillings for the second six months, and five shillings for any succeeding period. Members are relieved in
sickness and old age, and temporary assistance is granted to the widows and children of deceased members. A funeral
donation of .£2O is payable at death to the nearest relative or assign, and a donation of £lO to a member on the death of
his wife (if registered,) is granted. In accordance with the laws, those belonging to the Association are assisted whilst in
distressed circumstances.
The Association consists of an unlimited number of male members who must be natives of some of the
Australasian colonies, and who are divided into three classes—Benefit, Honorary, and Life Honorary. It is governed by
a Board of Directors, which is the Board of Management, and consists of a President, the ex-President for the time being,
two Vice-presidents, Treasurer, Secretary, and five members, who have jurisdiction over all the branches. The Conference
which meets annually, in February, is presided over by the President of the Board of Directors, or in his absence, by one
of the Vice-presidents, and in the event of all three being absent, the members are empowered to elect a Chairman from
amongst themselves. The Board of Directors meets quarterly, in the months of February, May, August and November.
Every branch of the Association must hold a charter from the Board of Directors, and possess a seal, which is affixed to
all deeds and necessary documents in connection with the Branch. The objects of the several branches are identical with
those already stated. The Australian Natives’ Association devotes a large proportion of the time occupied at Branch
meetings to the mutual improvement of its members by means of debates, essays, discussions, lectures, &c.; and also
seeks to imbue members with loyal and patriotic sentiments in respect to their native land. Its general place of business is
at No. 142 Mair-street, Balia tat.


OHAPTEE I.
EARLY DAYS AND DISCOVERY OF PORT PHILLIP.
1601-1778.
ejjQw,
speaking, this history should be confined within the limits of one
hundred years, so as to bear out the title under which it goes forth to the
fllir public, as the Centennial Jubilee History; but it lias been deemed
advisable to take a brief retrospect of the period anterior to 1788, in order to show
that, while the country cannot lay claim to a history other than that of modern
times, it, nevertheless, was beginning to emerge from darkness about the same time
as the mother country was awakening to a new existence by renewed vigour being
imparted to the life-blood of England, in her desire to take rank among the nations
as a country of literature and science, of expansion and discovery. Periods of
action and reaction are experienced, eras of movement and stagnation occur; the
equinox of all departments with which the busy mind of man can occupy itself takes
place, but it is only momentary; there is the zenith and the nadir of all systems,
whether it be of religion, of art, of literature, of science, or of the discovery of
continents. The close of the fifteenth century witnessed the discoveries of America,
but much uncertainty exists as to the earliest period when the continent of Australia
was first discovered, nor is it until the beginning of the seventeenth century that the
historian can, with any degree of accuracy, fix even an approximate date of the
event, owing to the lack of authentic and reliable data. There is a strong probability,
according to Mr. Major, that the first discovery of this continent was made in or
before 1531; however, it is certain that the Portuguese reached these shores in the
year 1601, five years before the Hutch yacht “Huyfhen,” or “Hove” —the earliest
vessel whose name has been handed down —sailed into the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and passed half-way down along its eastern side. In addition to the suggestiveness
of the name, there is a significance and symbolism attached to it.
A landing was effected by the sailors, but owing to the antagonism of the
natives, who killed the majority of them, the captain abandoned any further attempts
to explore the coast, and having given to the scene of the disaster the appropriate


name of “ Turn Again,” embarked, and sailed for home. About this time De Quiros,
who is stated to have been a Spaniard, desired to set out on a voyage of discovery,
as he had a strong belief that there lay to the south of the East Indies a gieat
continent. Phillip, who was then King of Spain, for a long time would lend no ear
to the intrepid seaman’s entreaties for a ship and men wherewith he might be enabled
to confirm the veracity of his statements. He, however, eventually succeeded in
receiving an order from the King to the Governor of Peru, containing instructions
to provide the equipment necessary for this expedition. Two ships were immediately
fitted out, with a nobleman named Torres as chief in command, and De Quiros as
sailing captain. Many small islands were discovered in their voyage across the
Pacific, and in 1606 they reached a shore of such vast extent, that De Quiros thought
it must be the great continent of which he was in search. He was wrong in his
conjecture, as the place has since been proved to be one of the islands of the New
Hebrides group. After this an agreement was made with Torres, whereby De Quiros
should take charge of one of the vessels, and set out on a voyage of exploration for
himself; but his sailors mutinied, and forced him to sail for home, thus depriving him
of an opportunity to examine the shores he had discovered. The last tidings heard
of this poor fellow, and of whom the only authentic account remains as the earliest
Australian discoverer, is that he died in poverty and disappointment. Torres sailed
westward, and was the first European to pass through the straits between Australia
and New Guinea, now called in honour of him, Torres’ Straits. He saw Cape York
rising from the sea, but took it for one of the numerous smaller islands with which
he had already met. A long list of Dutch discoverers subsequently touched the
shores of Australia, among whom were the famous Captains Pelsart and Tasman. So
far the discoveries made were very imperfect; there were no correct surveys of the
coast, no account of the habits and manners of the natives, no description of the
peculiarities in the plants and animals, and nothing was known of the nature of the
interior. The first who took the trouble to go into these details was William
Dampier, an Englishman, renowned as a traveller, and famous for having rescued
the hero of Defoe’s immortal story from his lonely island. Dampier joined, in 1688,
a company of buccaneers, whose principal object was plunder. They remained in
the East Indies for a long time, and sailing thence, landed on the north-west coast of
Australia. They were the first Europeans to hold any communication with the
natives. Dampier returned to England, and until 1699 led a very retired life, when
his love of adventure forced him to go abroad again. The English Government, in
the same year, at his request, gave him a small vessel—the “Roebuck”—and with
this he explored a large tract of the west and north-west coast of Australia, publishing
a fairly accurate account of his discoveries. No further explorations were made until
1770, when on April 18th of that year, a small vessel, named “ The Endeavour,”
with Lieutenant James Cook, R.N., as her commander, sailing westward from New
Zealand, bore through an unknown ocean towards the continent of Australia. On
the same day land was sighted by Lieutenant Hicks, who received the honour of
having the spot named after him. Point Hicks lay westward of Cape Howe, and


consequently within the territory of Victoria. Standing to the north-east, our
navigator sailed along the coast until he reached Botany Bay, so called from the
splendid botanical specimens collected by the two scientists, Mr. Banks and
Dr. Solander.
Captain Cook’s first attempt to land was opposed by two natives, and all his
attempts then and subsequently to be friendly with the aborigines proved abortive.
It was here that he took possession of the country in the name of his Sovereign,
George 111., calling it New South Wales. He was so favourably impressed with the
beauty of the country, its salubrious climate, and the probability of it becoming a
mighty empire of the future, that he strongly urged the Government to form a
colony at Botany Bay. It may be a fortunate circumstance for Australia that at this
period England had lost the plantations of America, to which her convicts had
heretofore been shipped, as otherwise, in all probability, there would have been less
desire to undertake the government of a continent so little known, and so far
removed from the centre of authority. At least, she would not have listened so
readily to her intrepid voyager’s account. The reports brought home by Captain
Cook about Australia were so much at variance with those of Dampier, that a total
change of the public opinion then existing took place. Dampier’s description of
what he saw, no doubt, was fairly accurate, but it led to the assumption that the
whole continent was one vast and miserable desert; whereas Cook gave a glowing
report of the eastern coast, and represented it as a country which would repay
England for any attention she might bestow on it. Its great distance from the old
country caused it to be regarded as a most suitable place for the transportation of the
criminal classes with which the gaols in England were now crowded, as transportation
to Virginia had ceased through the declaration of American independence in 1776.
Viscount Sydney accordingly determined to form a penal settlement at Botany Bay,
and in May, 1787, a fleet, consisting of the “ Sirius” and the “ Supply,” together
with six transports for the convicts, and three ships for carrying the stores, set sail
and arrived on January 18th, 1788, with Captain Arthur Phillip as Governor of the
colony, Captain Hunter as second in command, and Mr. Collins as Judge-Advocate
to preside in the military courts, which it was intended should be for the
administration of justice. The first batch of convicts consisted of five hundred
and fifty-eight males and two hundred and twenty-eight female prisoners. There
were in addition twenty-eight free married women, and seventeen children, with two
hundred and twelve soldiers of the line. The convicts suffered greatly on their way
out, and several deaths occurred amongst them from diseases contracted through
long confinement. When it was discovered that Botany Bay was ill adapted for such
a settlement, chiefly owing to the shallowness of the waters, which caused the ships
to be near the Heads, Governor Phillip, in company with three boats’ crews, sailed
out in search of some more suitable harbour. An examination of the opening which
Cook named Port Jackson resulted in the discovery of a noble harbour, now famed for
its beauty and safe anchorage, and named after Viscount Sydney, of the Admiralty.
All the anxiety and fear which had been haunting the mind of the Governor as


to the successful formation of a penal settlement immediately disappeared, and in
a few days from their arrival in Botany Bay, the party removed to the small inlet
named Sydney Cove.
The Government was formally declared on February 7th, 1788, in an open
space on which a flagstaff was erected, and the colony of New South Wales
proclaimed to extend from Cape York to Cape Howe, and from the sea to the
135 th degree of east longitude. In 1702 Governor Phillip was forced to tender his
resignation on account of ill-health, occasioned by the cares and trials he had to
undergo. He is described as energetic, a man of great force of character, equal to any
emergency, as well as considerate and just. The British Government appreciated
so fully his valuable services that they presented him with a handsome pension.
In 1705, Captain Hunter, commander of the ship “ Sirius,” which had been
lost, succeeded to the Governorship—the colony during the interim being in charge
of Major Grose and Captain Patterson. The “ Sirius ” was wrecked on a
coral reef, near Norfolk Island, whither she had carried two hundred convicts, in
charge of about seventy soldiers, in the hope that the impending famine which
threatened the settlement might he averted. It was a providential step of
Governor Phillip’s, immediately after his arrival in New South Wales, to send
Lieutenant King, accompanied by twenty-seven convicts and soldiers, to take
possession of that island, for, owing to its fertility, the large crops which could he
raised left them with stores sufficient to feed their starving companions, and thus
enable those at the original settlement to hold out until the store ships should arrive.
Had this outlet not existed, it is impossible to say what would have happened in a
community of over a thousand starving people.
When Governor Hunter arrived to take charge of the colony, he brought with
him on board his ship, the “ Reliance,” Mr. George Bass as surgeon, and Mr.
Matthew Flinders, a young midshipman. These young men bore a very high
reputation; they were of amiable and unassuming disposition; they had a
deep affection for each other; and as they possessed a great love for discovery,
they were admirably fitted to undertake exploration. As soon as Mr. Bass
arrived at Sydney, he and his friend Flinders engaged a boat only eight
feet in length, which, from its diminutive size, they christened the “ Tom Thumb.”
This sea-witch was manned by our two heroes and a boy, and in this frail bark, in
November, 1795, they ventured out to do battle with the stormy waves of the Pacific.
After tossing about for a considerable time, they successfully entered Botany Bay,
which they thoroughly explored. They then returned to Sydney, and in March,
1796, they made a longer voyage to the south, reaching their head quarters once
more, after having experienced some thrilling adventures and dangers, with accurate
information of about forty miles of the coast. In December, 1797, Flinders sailed
in the “Reliance” for Norfolk Island, while Bass, who received from Governor
Hunter a whaleboat with six men and six weeks’ provisions, undertook the voyage
which connects his name so closely with Port Phillip history. On December 19th,
Twofold Bay was discovered, north of Cape Howe; and on the next day he landed on


the shores ot Victoria, at Ram’s Head, where he was detained for some time by had
weather. Sailing along the open beach, lie discovered the headland to which
Governor Hunter gave the name of Wilson’s Promontory, after a friend of Flinders’s,
at the request of Bass. Then on January 4th, 1798, followed the discovery of
Western Port, where he remained thirteen days. As his provisions were running
short, he very unwillingly made for Sydney, hut stress of weather caused him once
more to seek for shelter. His voyage lasted for eleven weeks, during which time he
explored six hundred miles of coast, and discovered the most important cape in
Australia. The generally accepted opinion at this time was that Van Hieman’s Land
was a part of New Holland, and that no strait existed, the truth of which he was very
anxious to ascertain. Flinders having returned from a trip to some islands north of
Van Dieman’s Land, Governor Hunter gave the two exploring heroes the ship
“Norfolk,” 25 tons, manned hy eight seamen, to decide the point. Setting sail,
they, towards the end of the year 1798, discovered the straits between New Holland
and Van Hieman’s Land (thus upsetting the existing theory), which were justly
named hy the Governor, at the request of Flinders, Bass’s Straits. The labours of
these two young men, their enthusiasm, and their careful surveys, may well entitle
their memory to he treasured hy all who take an interest in Australia. Henceforth
the name of Bass is dissociated with Port Phillip history, and his fate is more or less
a mystery. All that is known of him is that he went to South America, and that he
was unfortunate in trading with the Spaniards, who refused to have any transactions
with him, the authorities having issued a fiat forbidding commercial intercourse with
the English. It is said that he was seized hy them and sent to the silver mines,
where he may have succumbed to an illness contracted by working at that unhealthy
vocation. Thus passed away one of the noblest men that ever trod the land of
Australia, or sailed round her coasts, remarkable for his self-devotion to his high
calling, ‘ for his intrepidity, for his extreme humanity, and not by any means the
least virtue—it is a virtue —for his high order of intellect.
Lieutenant James Grant, E.N., who had command of Her Majesty’s 40-ton
brig the “ Lady Nelson,” in his voyage from London to Sydney, comes next under
notice as being identified with the history of Port Phillip discovery. He passed
through Bass’s Straits, and on December 3rd, 1800, sighted and named Cape Banks,
and then discovered Capes Northumberland, Bridgewater and Nelson; the Lawrence
Islands, Portland Bay, Point Nepean, Cape Otway, Cape Liptrap, the Rodondo Rock,
and other points from Western Port to longitude 141p° E. Lieutenant Grant
returned on March 21st, 1801, to Bass’s Straits, and made a survey of the coast from
Wilson’s Promontory, to, and including Western Port, and returned to Sydney,
having named Cape Paterson and Cape Schank. He obtained leave of absence to
go to England in October, 1801, and in 1803 published a sketch of his voyage. The
turning-point in the history of the colony of Victoria is now reached. At the end of
1801, Governor King, of New South Wales, desirous of ascertaining all particulars
concerning the inlet passed by Lieutenant Grant, sent Lieutenant John Murray, R.N.,
to examine the bay now called Port Phillip Bay. That gallant officer passed the


Heads in the government craft “ Lady Nelson,” on February 18th, 1802, and was
delighted with the spacious harbour that met his gaze. He named it Port King,
after the Governor in Sydney, but it was afterwards, at the request of the Governor,
changed to Port Phillip, in honour of the first Governor and founder of New South
Wales. Shortly after this discovery, Captain Nicholas Baudin, of the French
expedition sent out by Napoleon to make discoveries in Australia, passed the
entrance without being noticed, in the ship “ Geographe.” Although England and
France were then at war, this gentleman, while in Sydney, received attention, in
recognition of his distinguished calling, very much in contrast with the treatment
which poor Flinders subsequently suffered at his hands. Captain Baudin assumed
the honour of being the discoverer of the very bays which had already been mapped
out, gave to them French names, and sent home to France a report ignoring the claims
of Flinders, whom the French officers allowed to be deserving of credit for nearly all
the discoveries made. The injustice of this act is very much heightened when it is
borne in mind that the French sailors, many of whom were suffering with scurvy,
received the most humane treatment from the colonists, who had them tenderly cared
for at the Sydney Hospital, and who literally deprived themselves of the necessaries
of life for the sake of the invalids—living on salt meat in order to preserve their cattle,
but killing these very cattle so that the sailors might be provided with fresh meat.
Flinders left for London in 1800, where the publication of his charts so pleased the
Government that they determined to send out an expedition to survey all the coasts
of Australia in like manner. Sir John Franklin served as a midshipman in this
voyage. At the close of 1801 Flinders commenced his discoveries. He was the
first to behold the shores of South Australia. It was while he was sailing
down towards Bass’s Straits that he fell in with Baudin, the commander of the
French expedition, to whose conduct allusion has been already made. Flinders
entered Port Phillip Bay on April 26th, 1802, and from the representations he made
of the locality, the Governor recommended the British Government to form a penal
colony there. During this voyage he made an excellent chart of Torres’ Straits, and
had it not been owing to the rottenness of his vessel, which forced him to return to
Sydney, he would have contributed valuable additions to his already extensive
history of discovery. He then started for England with his charts and journals, but
when out a few days the vessel struck on a coral reef. After remaining for two
months on a small sandbank, which was reached with great difficulty, he was
released, and returned to Sydney with his documents, which he had contrived to
sa\e. Anothei attempt to reach England in a small schooner named the
“ Cumberland ” was destined to be as unsuccessful, for, the vessel being in a leakinre-
condition, he was forced to put into the Mauritius, which then belonged to France.
There he was seized, his papers were taken from him, and he was cast
into prison by De Caen, the Governor of the island, although the passport
given to him by the French Government (England and France being then at
war) should have been sufficient to protect him from obstruction and such
outrageous conduct.


The unscrupulous Baudin some time afterwards called at the Mauritius, and,
instead of procuring Flinders’s release (this would not have served his purpose),
persuaded the Governor to keep him under close confinement. With the copies he
had taken of Flinders’s chart he sailed for France, where the publication of the
materials caused him to he looked upon as the greatest discoverer of the age.
After undergoing six years’ continuous detention on a small island in one of lakes of
the Mauritius, Flinders was released and reached England, when, to his utter
astonishment, he found that people were already in possession of the information
which he thought it was only possible for him to supply. However, after six years’
labour, the three volumes of his book, written with the greatest care, and
containing all his maps, were ready for the Press; but he did not live to witness the
consummation of his work. His constitution was completely shattered by the
hardships and sufferings he was compelled to undergo, and as his book was leaving
the publisher’s hands his eyes ceased to behold the light of day. Strange end for
such a noble career! Like his friend Bass, he devoted his life and energies to
advance knowledge, and his discoveries have conferred incalculable benefits on
mankind. He has left behind him a name which shall every year grow more
honoured, and he has bequeathed to future generations an example of heroism and
courage worthy of imitation by every high-spirited man. The two friends were
“lovely and pleasant in their lives,” and in the circumstances attending “their
death they were not divided.”


CHAPTEE 11.
FIRST SETTLEMENT OF PORT PHILLIP.
1778-1810.
the reflection is somewhat distasteful that the first settlement
a co^ ias een attempted by the outcasts of society, sentenced to
?IS|p undergo various terms of exile and degrees of punishment, and that
criminals are to be the pioneers of civilisation, who, by some process of evolution,
shall work out the project to its realization. Such attempts have not proved
generally successful, as the history of Australia shows, hut experiments must be
made, and the knowledge derived from their success or failure can be the only
infallible guide.
Plantation and colonisation are synonymous, and plantations, as all history
shows, have only been an accomplished fact when inaugurated by the respectable
portion of society. England was not quite twenty years in possession of the land
known as New South Wales, and her people were new to the art of colonisation; but
she, being anxious to extend her influence as much as possible, and to maintain her
supremacy over her dependencies, naturally sought some means of initiating a
movement which might afterwards depend entirely on private enterprise. The
reports received about Port Phillip were so favourable that the British Cabinet
determined to form another settlement for their criminal exiles, and accordingly an
expedition was fitted out, with David Collins, Esq., Colonel of the Marines,
the Governor of the future colony, as its leader. None more fitting to occupy the
position could have been chosen, as he had previously been to Australia, having
accompanied the first fleet to Sydney; had been secretary to the first Governor; had
inaugurated the new settlement; and as Judge-Advocate, he must have gained a vast
amount of experience in the capacity of president of the first Australian law court.
Moreover, his account of New South Wales, which was highly interesting and
instructive, sufficiently indicated his knowledge of the country. He was born in
Ireland in 1756, and was present in the memorable conflict at Bunker’s Hill. The
expedition, consisting of the “Ocean,” transport, 500 tons, in charge of Captain


Matthews, accompanied by the “Calcutta ” man-of-war, having eighteen guns on the
upper deck, rigged as a fifty-six gun ship, with a complement of one hundred and
seventy men, under the command of Captain Daniel Woodriff, left in April, 1803,
and, after a voyage of six months, sighted New Holland on October Bth of the same
year, the following day making King’s Island.
In addition to the officers and men, there were on board three hundred and
sixty-seven prisoners, all males; seventeen of the most respectable among them
being granted permission to bring their wives, one of whom died on the voyage;
seven children, and a few free settlers. The paucity of the number of children was
owing to the authorities being of opinion that the perils of a long voyage, and the
hardships to be endured in a new and unsettled country, together with the associations
surrounding the daily life of such a community, would be injurious to those of
tender years. One of these seven children was John Pascoe Fawkner, then a lad of
eleven years of age, destined to play an important part in the early history of the
future colony of Victoria. The whole party landed on the shore on Sunday, October
16th, between Arthur’s Seat (so named by Lieutenant Murray, to whom reference has
already been made) and Point Nepean, the exact locality being a spot between the
two points, named The Sisters, near Sorrento.
Mr. J. H, Tuckey, first lieutenant of the “Calcutta,” and the historian of the
expedition, states that the uncertainty of their situation rendered an approach to the
shore a source of great perplexity. The Governor and Captain Woodriff landed on
Seal Island, near the mouth of Port Phillip, and returned with the disheartening
news that the total want of fresh water and the nature of the soil precluded any hope
of successfully forming a settlement.
After three distinct searches had been made for water, it was found that
it might be obtained by sinking in the sand near the sea, but it was out of the
question to remain in such an inhospitable region. The Governor, anxious to satisfy
himself as to the water problem, despatched Lieutenant Tuckey with two boats to
carefully survey the port, and ascertain the situation best calculated for the settlement
of the colony. He examined the Bay from Point Nepean to Mornington, but no suitable
spot for the settlement was obtainable, the shortness of time and the inclemency
of the weather preventing a more complete and satisfactory exploration. Moreover,
another circumstance compelled him to return. He was confronted at the spot
where Frankston now stands by a great crowd of blacks, with whom he had what
might have proved a very serious skirmish. Meanwhile, those at the settlement
were fully employed in clearing the land, cutting lanes for the carriage of timber,
and erecting huts beneath the branches of the lofty trees; but all their physical
efforts to overcome the natural defects of the site were neutralised, chiefly by the
want of water.
The sinking hopes of the little community were somewhat stayed in anticipation
of Lieutenant Tuckey succeeding in the discovery of a more eligible locality, but
when his gloomy report was announced utter despondency seized them. The heat,
the want of water, and the general wretchedness, called forth an unanimous appeal to


the Governor to remove elsewhere. Whereupon he sent letters to Governor King of
Sydney, calling his attention to the deplorable state of affairs, and the unsuitability of
the situation for a settlement. The result of the despatch was that permission was
granted to Collins to cross over to Tasmania.
Before an account of the re-emigration of the settlement is given, some
domestic news may prove of general interest to the reader.
On Sunday, October 23rd, divine service was held for the first time in the
Colony of Victoria, by the Bev. Robert Knopwood, Chaplain of the Colony. This
gentleman, who was profanely called “ Old Bobby,” was, if report is to be credited,
a kind-hearted but careless theologian.
An attempt, within a month of their arrival, had been made by eight of the
convicts to escape, five of whom were brought back and punished, but the other
three were never seen again. On November 14th the first kangaroo was killed,
weighing sixty-eight pounds. The first burial, that of the cook of the “ Calcutta,”
took place on November 16th, the date of the expiry of the “Ocean’s” (transport)
charter.
The first child born was a boy, and son of Sergeant Thomas, on
November 25th; and the first baptism took place on Christmas Day, when this
child received from his godfather, Governor Collins, the name of Hobart, after
Lord Hobart, Secretary of State; and the first marriage was solemnised on
November 27th, at Sullivan’s Bay Camp, Port Phillip, by the Rev. Robert
Knopwood, between Richard Garrett and Hannah Harvey.
It was not until November 17th that Colonel Collins was inaugurated as
Governor, he having up to this period acted in the capacity of Lieutenant-Governor.
The most successful settlements that England possesses are the result of
private enterprise, but, although that is the case, still it must be remembered that
success in such instances has not been entirely due to independent experiments;
rather have those who have embarked in undertakings in far-off lands benefited by
the discoveries of others as to the probabilities of failure or success. Its
Government establishments in colonies may not be the most successful, indeed they
may be failures, but Government townships in colonies outstrip private ones. With
very few exceptions, the most prosperous towns or cities are those situated on rivers
or at the seaboard, and it seems strange that the energy in searching for water, one
of Nature’s gifts which is so beneficial in sustaining life, creating commerce, and
producing the fruits of the earth, should have been wanting in the founders of the
new settlement, who were too easily disheartened, and beat a retreat to the Derwent,
where the same trials awaited them.
Before the Governor left, four convicts escaped into the bush on
December 27th, hoping to make their way to Sydney. One of these was Buckley,
who is described as being six feet six inches in height. He was prisoner-servant to
Governor Collins, and is said to be the only one of the many bolters from the camp
who lived to see the white man’s return, thirty years after. Another of the
quartette, who returned to the camp on January 24th in a very exhausted state, named


David Gibson, reported having seen the river now called Yarra Yarra. The
first embarkation of one hundred convicts for the new settlement took place on
January 24th, in the transport “ Ocean,” which was re-engaged for four months
longer, arriving at the Derwent as late as February 16th. The Governor and his
officers embarked in the “ Lady Nelson,” January 25th. Several trips were taken
before all were assembled at Risdon Cove, whither Lieutenant Bowen, a surgeon,
three soldiers, and sixteen of the worst criminals had been sent from Sydney, to
form a settlement. The Governor found the party on the verge of starvation, and in
danger of night attacks by the natives. He therefore removed the whole
settlement to a place on the opposite side of the Derwent, where there was more
security and better accommodation for vessels of large draft. In honour of Lord
Hobart, Secretary of State, the new settlement was called Hobart Town. Thus ends
the history of the first attempt of the settlement of Port Phillip, and eradication of
the convict element from its shores for ever. Lieutenant Tuckey, who was such
a prominent figure in the events of that period, it may be interesting to
state, left for England in the “Calcutta” in the year 1805. This vessel was
captured by the French while on a voyage out to St. Helena. The captain was soon
exchanged, but Lieutenant Tuckey was held as a prisoner until after the fall of
Napoleon. He was subsequently sent on an expedition to a malarious part of Africa,
where he and most of his party met with their end. Governor Collins ruled in
Hobart Town for six years, and fell dead in his chair on March 24, 1810, while
engaged in a cheerful conversation with a friend. The founder of two Australian
Colonies, he was a kind-hearted man, somewhat vain, given much to hospitality, and
possessed of fair abilities. His name will always be identified with the history of
the early colonisation of Australia, and, although he has had severe strictures passed
on some of his acts, yet unbiassed testimony goes to prove that his intentions were
well meant, and that the difficulties with which he had to cope were well-nigh
insuperable.


CHAPTER 111.
FROM THE DEATH OF GOVERNOR COLLINS UNTIL THE
SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT OF PORT PHILLIP.
1810-1836.
JvqirV ( )TWIT 1 ISTANI)L\G that the preceding chapter is understood to bring
the history of Port Phillip down to the year 1810, there, in reality,
I'Sflii' occurred but one event of sufficient importance to engage the serious
attention of the historian, from the date of the abandonment of the settlement in
1804 until 1824; but, as Governor Collins was such a prominent figure in its early
annals, it was considered justifiable to assign the date of his death as that which
would fitly conclude the narrative as related in the foregoing pages. It would be
well, standing, as we are, on the threshold of our history, to point out that very little
worthy of the name of history, as it is generally understood, is to be found existing
in the early annals of any colonial settlement. Indeed, these volumes do not aspire
to the dignity of telling the story of Victoria in the pretentious forms of historical
records, which are not useful to the general reader ; and so young is Victoria that a
few are still living who were instrumental in rearing her from infancy, and were
participators in the incidents connected with Port Phillip, which was a dependency
of New South Wales until July 1, 1861, when it was proclaimed a distinct colony.
Until 1824, or a period of twenty years, the colony is only known as the resort of
sealers and fowlers, who, in plying their vocation among the islands of Bass’s Straits,
were frequently driven, through stress of weather, to run for shelter into the harbour
of Port Phillip. These sea-rovers were, for the most part, run-away convicts, and
led an extremely hazardous life, visiting the regions of civilisation at long intervals
to dispose of their wares and procure provisions, and then disappearing again. It
could hardly be expected that such men, who never penetrated further than a few
miles inland, would have any desire to attempt exploration. There was another
cause for the interior remaining a sealed book. Many of these men had wrongfully
possessed themselves of wives from the native tribes; and the spirit of retaliation
which actuated the aborigines, kept this adventurous class at a distance. Consequently,
for nearly two decades, the country is a blank in the pages of history, so far, at least,


as the interior is concerned, and the kangaroo did “ reign undisturbed lord of the
soil” for a season, but he did not, according to Lieutenant Tuckey, “ retain ” his
dominion “for ages.” Next in order to those early explorers—particularly Flinders
and Bass —to whom all the colonies owe a debt, as the two men whose names must
be inseparably connected with Australia, comes an interesting class who likewise
have a claim on the gratitude of the colonies. While Flinders and Bass busied
themselves with discoveries along the colony’s coast line, these, to whom allusion is
now made, turned their attention to the interior. The names of Oxley, Grey, Eyre,
Sturt, Hume, Hovell, Mitchell, Leichhardt, and others may be mentioned as heroes
and patriots, who have rendered invaluable service to every part of the Australian
continent.
In 1817, Mr. Oxley was sent out by the Government of New South Wales on a
tour of discovery, and travelling westward of Sydney arrived at the Lachlan, whose
forbidding banks he traversed until the stream was lost in a number of vast marshes,
which he concluded must be the end of the river. He pronounced the country as
“uninhabitable,” and stated, as his conviction, that no opening for commerce was to
be found in this part of the territory. Oxley was afterwards sent to explore the course
of the Macquarie Eiver, but met with no greater success. The river flowed into a
wide marsh, some thirty or forty miles long, and he abandoned the project. The
history of exploration of the interior really owes its beginning to two gentlemen
who were fired with a thirst for distinction, and a desire to obtain more suitable
pastures for their flocks.
The difficulties which those who penetrate into an unknown country are
obliged to encounter are very imperfectly conjectured, and the courage required for
such undertakings is phenomenal. All the finer qualities must be brought into play
—coolness under the most adverse circumstances, and a candid, though cautious,
course of conduct towards the men accompanying an expedition needs to be
observed. Of all systems of exploration that have entered the human mind, perhaps
that devised by Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor, was the wildest, and, when
seriously considered, is sufficient to provoke a smile. His proposition was to land
a number of convicts on the southern coast, with provisions enough to last them
until they should have worked their way back to Sydney. The survivors, in addition
to being released from servitude, were to receive a grant of land. Reconsidering his
plan, he decided on securing the services of a capable leader to take charge of the
expedition, and Mr. Hamilton Hume, who was an experienced bushman, was invited
to act in that capacity. He was a native of New South Wales, was accustomed to a
roving life, and had accompanied Mr. Oxley on one of his journeys, and Mr. Meehan,
the surveyor, on another. He is described as energetic and determined, of a very
despotic spirit, and anxious to become a distinguished explorer. Sir Thomas
Brisbane’s plan did not meet with his approval, but he declared his willingness to
conduct a party of convicts from Sydney. The negotiations with the Government so
irritated Hume-that he resolved to start on his own responsibility. Captain Hovell,
who had been in the colony since 1813, and, like Hume, was a squatter, being desirous


of obtaining new and better pastures, asked permission to join the expedition.
These two gentlemen, who were a very ill-assorted pair, left themselves free,
although travelling together, to make their individual arrangements. With
packs, saddles, horses, tarpaulins, six prisoners of the Crown, and two carts
carrying the provisions and drawn by teams of oxen, the party (the first of Victoria’s
“overlanders”) left, on October 17th, 1824, Mr. Hume’s out-station at Lake George,
the outermost settlement on the Victoria side. On the second day they passed Yass,
and reached the banks of the Murrumbidgee, which was very much swollen by the
rains. At the place where they made an attempt to cross, the river was from thirty
to forty yards in breadth, with a current flowing at the rate of between five and six
knots an hour. They waited until the 22nd, but finding no appearance of the flood
subsiding, it was resolved that the passage of the river be essayed. The carts were
covered with tarpaulins and converted into punts. Hume swam across the river,
carrying the end of a rope between his teeth, and by means of this the punts
containing their goods were hauled over. Not being men of kindred spirit, they
quarrelled as to the course to be taken, one wishing to go in an easterly, the other in
a westerly direction. As neither would give way, they separated, but shortly after a
reconciliation was effected. But the country through which they travelled was so
rough and impassable, that their carts became such a nuisance as to force them to
abandon them in a creek. The journey over the ranges and ravines was long and
tedious, but the country in many parts was of a very superior character. Penetrating
this rough district for a distance of seventy miles, on November 14th they sighted
the Australian Alps, and climbed the summit of Mount Battery. The next obstacle
that barred their progress was a noble river, of much larger dimensions, which was
suddenly met with a few days after, and to which the name of Hume was given,
that gentleman being the first to see it. This was subsequently shown to be the head
of the Murray. The Hume, or what is now known as the Upper Murray, was eighty
yards in width, of great depth, and, with a current at the rate of three miles an hour,
was observed to have a course, like that of the Murrumbidgee, inland. Having
examined its course for some distance down its banks, in the hope of finding an easy
crossing place, they retraced their steps, and proceeding upwards for a considerable
distance, passing through beautiful country with grass breast high, they succeeded
in crossing above the junction of the Mitta Mitta, near Albury, by means of a
temporary boat, hastily constructed of wicker-work, and covered with tarpaulins.
The swamps and lagoons which skirted the river impeded their progress very much.
It may be observed in connection with this crossing, that the brink of that territory
of the Murray was the scene of fresh discord, Hume wishing to cross the river, and
Hovell refusing. This altercation led to another separation, which ended by Hovell,
as on the previous occasion, returning and proceeding with the expedition. Thirty
miles further and they reached another river (the eighth so far discovered), which was
easily crossed, it being only three feet in depth. It was named the Ovens, after the
deceased Major Ovens, private secretary to Sir Thomas Brisbane, and retains to this
day that name. The name of the Hume is scarcely ever seen on any of the later


maps, that of the Murray, which Sturt subsequently gave it, frequently being
substituted. Keeping on a southerly course for a distance of one hundred and ten
miles, the 3rd of December brought them to another river, abounding in beautiful
scenery and of considerable size, which was named in honour of Hovell, but is now
known as the Goulburn. Difficulties of a much more harassing nature than any hitherto
experienced now occurred, as the country which, according to their reckoning, lay in
37° 8' south latitude, was almost impenetrable. After much suffering and hardships
endured in endeavouring to make their way through long grass, known as cutting
grass, between four and five feet high, with a blade an inch and a-half broad, and
having very sharp edges, which tore their clothes and cut their flesh, they were
obliged to beat a retreat, although they attempted to scramble over the ranges on
their hands and knees. They made a long detour to the westward, to avoid this
forbidding region of the dividing chain, and, on December 7th, reached the
neighbourhood of a hill, which they named, in commemoration of their
failure, Mount Disappointment, better known as the “Big Hill.” It can
be seen distinctly from Port Phillip, and it still bears the name which the
explorers gave it. In addition to all their troubles a still more serious one
now overtook them —the want of water. From Mount Disappointment, as the
travellers turned their eyes westward, was discovered the noble mount which is
now the well-known Mount Macedon, and summer resort of the Governor of
Victoria. It was re-discovered and ascended by Major Mitchell a dozen years
afterwards, who changed its name from Wentworth, which had been given to it in
honour of the distinguished politician and orator of Sydney. Pushing on, they
found an easier passage lying to the north-west, and the crossing of the Dividing
Range, in the vicinity of the Big Hill, was effected on December 13th. On the next
clay they struck out in a westerly direction, and after travelling a distance of twenty
miles, they perceived from rising ground, for the first time, the blue waters of the
sea. Proceeding westwards along the shore, they met one of the natives, of whom
traces were found on the 15th, who told them that the waters before them were
called Geelong. The information elicited from the natives was of a very meagre
description. They seemed to have some recollection of the arrival of a ship, and
pointed out the spot where she lay, and endeavoured to explain that they had seen
men felling timber, which was probably during the time of the attempted settlement.
They are described as being curious and treacherous, very troublesome, and capable
of appropriating, with an irritating sang froid , property not belonging to them.
They evinced a very great horror of the bullocks which belonged to the expedition,
and became dreadfully alarmed if they noticed them, although a considerable
distance intervened, looking in their direction. So far the journey had been
successful. The territory of Port Phillip had for the first time been crossed, and
the southern waters reached, but another disagreement took place between the two
leaders, much to the disgust of their attendants. Hovell, although an old sailor,
seems to have been a most self-assertive man, and argued that the scene of their
latest discovery was Western Port; whereas Hume, who was the real head of the


expedition as far as sagacity and experience contributed to its success, maintained it
was a part of Port Phillip; and his reasons for this opinion were based on
instructions given to him by a former bush companion, Meehan, the Surveyor, prior
to his departure on this journey. That gentleman, in company with Mr. Charles
Grimes, the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, and Lieutenant Bobbins, E.N.,
were sent by Governor King, in 1803, to walk round and survey Port Phillip Bay; and,
in connection with this walking tour, it may be observed that it was from Mr. Grimes’s
plan Captain Flinders was enabled to complete his chart, Mr. Meehan explained to
Hume the means of identifying the two places—Western Port had two islands, Port
Phillip none. Hume saw no land as he gazed over the broad expanse before him,
and he was, therefore, convinced it could only be Port Phillip. Our explorers now
contemplated a return homewards, and, accordingly, on December 18th they began
the journey. Their stock of provisions, which at this time consisted of one
hundred and fifty pounds of flour and six pounds of tea, was soon consumed, but
they contrived to subsist by the way until they had regained their carts, which, with
part of the original supplies, it will be remembered, they were forced to leave behind
them in the creek. Crossing the Arndell, near the Werribee, they came upon their
old track, and, turning a little to the westward, they made hasty marches, and
arrived at Lake George station, after an absence of thirteen weeks, on January 18th,
1825, having reached the Hume on the 3rd, and the Murrumbidgee on the 17th of
the same month. This journey displayed remarkable judgment, energy and courage
on the part of the leaders, and resulted in a refutation of Oxley’s hastily-formed
opinion with reference to the district they had just explored, and the opening up of
the splendid country of Australia Felix to the enterprise of their fellow countrymen.
The Governor rewarded each of the leaders with a grant of twelve hundred acres of
land, and their convict attendants with a “ticket of leave.”
In 1826, in consequence of reports that the French had resolved to found penal
settlements on some parts of the Australian coast, and that King George’s Sound
and Western Port, or some other harbour in Bass’s Straits, were the places chosen
for that purpose, instructions were received from the Home Government, by Governor
Sir Ealph Darling, to take immediate possession of them. An expedition was
accordingly sent from Sydney with that object, consisting of H.M.S. “ Fly,”
Captain Wetherall, and the brigs “Dragon” and “Amity,” with detachments from
the 3rd Buffs and the 39th Eegiment, under Colonel Stewart. Captain S. Wright
and Lieutenant B. H. Burchell were to remain at Western Port, the former as
commandant of the settlement. The authorities in Sydney, leaning to Hovell’s
opinion that the harbour, over which the dispute arose between Hume and himself,
was Western Port, he was despatched with this expedition for the purpose of
carrying out further explorations. He made an extensive examination of the
country in the immediate vicinity, and passed between Bass and Wright’s Elvers,
where he found excellent land, and then tried to cross the immense swamp at the
north of the Port, but found it impassable; he, however, kept on his journey until
he arrived at that part of Port Phillip which he, in company with Hume, had


previously explored, when he was obliged to turn back. He, however, became
convinced of the mistake he had made. This expedition with its small party of
convicts reached Western Port, and, after disembarkation, a small fortification, at the
eastern end of Phillip Island, which is across the entrance, was erected. They
found a French expedition had been there before them, but that no attempt
had been made to form a settlement. The scare about French occupation
having subsided, and the shores of the harbour being scrubby and interior
to the land seen by Messrs. Hume and Hovell, the settlement near the
present township of Corinella was abandoned—(the official communication
announcing the fact is dated Jan. 23, 1828) —as the Home Government disapproved
of a system of scattered convict settlements. Hume published an account of his
expedition in the Sydney Herald newspaper in 1833, and felt justly proud of his
correctness. He claims that the information he gave had the effect of first
successfully settling Hobson’s Bay. Our history henceforth will increase in
interest and importance, but dark as the narrative has been hitherto, it should prove
highly instructive and suggestive to many more than those born in Australia, or who
selected the country for their adopted land. It is not a difficult matter to assign a
date to those events which command superiority in its records, but it may be safely
said that the discovery of the course and mouth of the Murray River, by Captain
Sturt, marks an epoch of great significance. The history of the colony for the
next few years is rather fugitive, and it is difficult to relate, in more than a
disjointed manner, the events preceding Batman’s arrival. But the obscurity
attaching to it may have a charm for those who delight in the mysterious. Captain
Sturt, who held a commission in the 39th Regiment in Sydney, was of a most
reflective disposition, and doubted the existence of the inland sea supposed to have
been seen by Mr. Oxley, the former Surveyor-General, in 1818. He obtained
permission from Governor Darling, when a season of long-continued drought presented
a favourable opportunity, to determine the question by attempting a passage through
the vast marsh to which reference has already been made. Accompanied by our
distinguished traveller, Hume, they left Sydney in November, 1828, reached the marshes
of the Macquarie, exploded the theory of the inland sea, and followed its stream
northwards, until they met with a river, which they named after Governor Darling.
In January, 1830, Captain Sturt become connected with Port Phillip history.
In company with Mr. Macleay, the naturalist, and six men, he started to
explore the Murrumbidgee. Finding the whaleboat with which he was provided
insufficient to answer all purposes, he constructed a skiff, which was attached to the
other boat, to carry some of the provisions. The snags in the river had caused
some accidents to the skiff (one upset spoiling all the salt provisions), and it was
therefore abandoned. Up at sunrise, and rowing till five o’clock every day, was his
rule, while at night the party slept on shore. Excepting the charm attending their
mission, nothing of a very exciting nature occurred, save that on one occasion they
lost an article similar to that over which Hume and Hovell once quarrelled—a
frying-pan —their cutlasses, and a few tomahawks, which had been stealthily carried


off by the blacks. The attractions of native beauty might, on another occasion, have
caused the failure of the expedition. Some women stood on the bank, and tempted,
by loving gestures and those fascinations so peculiar to the gentler sex, the party to
land. But if love bursts bolts and bars, it hesitates before it rushes on spear points;
and whatever emotions may have been awakened in the breasts of our travellers,
were very speedily stifled by the appearance, in the background, of some of the original
proprietors of the soil quite prepared to resist the intrusion. Leaving these fair (?)
syrens to their ways and wiles, the party passed through a flat country covered with
reeds, and reached a stream 300 feet wide, which was named the Murray, after Sir
George Murray, the Secretary for the Colonies. Captain Sturt was not aware that
this was the river crossed by Hume and Hovell on their journey to Port Phillip in
1824, and named by them the Hume; but he was perfectly justified in following
the usages of other travellers, and, as he writes, “ giving a name to that river, down
which and up which I have toiled more than two thousand miles.” An incident one
day occurred which fully demonstrated the effect of our explorer’s benevolence on
the dusky denizens of the Murray, who were not strangers to all the finer feelings of
the human breast. His reception of a number of aborigines was so gracious that
it immediately overcame their suspicions; and Mr. Macleay so completely won their
affections by singing them songs, that it was with difficulty he convinced them there
was no necessity to undress, as he was not their friend Rundi, who had died of a
wound in the side, but had now returned to them. It was very fortunate that four
of these good-natured visitors accompanied Sturt, as, shortly afterwards, their
intercession and representation of Sturt’s kindness saved the party from certain
death at the hands of hundreds of natives, who desired to dispute the invasion of
their territory, but at once relinquished their hostilities. Pursuing the course of
the waters, they discovered a large river from the north flowing into the Murray,
which turned out to be, according to Sturt’s conjecture, the mouth of the Darling.
Instead of continuing an upward course, which could only have been accomplished by
breaking a net that extended across the river, and thereby commit an act which would
have deprived the natives, who lined the rocky banks in hundreds, of their food for
that day, he unfurled the Union Jack to the echo of three cheers, such as Britishers
alone can give, and descended the stream, into which a small creek ran, named by
the leader Rufus, from the red hair of Mr. Macleay. Captain Sturt, from the general
appearance of the country, began to think he was nearing the coast, and was
informed to that effect by an old man, who, in reply to his enquiries, pointed to the
south. Seagulls began to appear and in a short time, the river was seen to expand
into the vast shallow lake named by him 'Alexandria, after our beloved
Queen-Empress. It was now a question of what was the most judicious course to
pursue. They walked to its entrance into the sea, but it was hopeless to expect, in
their present condition, that they could reach the nearest place of refuge,
Launceston, five hundred miles distant. Our leader was anxious to gain the
western hills by the Gulf of St. Vincent, but the probable danger arising from a
collision with the natives, whose friendship was not to be relied upon, showed there


was only one course open to him —to retrace his way homeward by the route he had
come. So, homeward was the prow pointed with one thousand miles to traverse. The
shortness of their rations, added to the fatigue already undergone, had considerably
weakened the explorers, but they bore up as manfully as they could; and, even
starvation staring them in the face did not cool their affectionate consideration for
the gallant captain. By his cheering words another effort would be made, while his
accounts of the dangers they had already passed through nerved them to a fresh
struggle to reach the depot, which was at length gained by the plucky little band.
In eleven weeks they had pulled two thousand miles, and achieved, in the words of
Napier, “ An intrepid enterprise! unanimated by the glory of battle, yet accompanied
by the hardships of a campaign—without splendour, and without reward.”
In the year 1836 the Sydney Government resolved to equip an expedition
under the command of Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, Surveyor-General of
New South Wales, to complete the survey of the Darling and the Murray, the
former being discovered about seven years previously by Captain Sturt. Instructions
were given to explore, as far as practicable, the left bank of the Murray, which now
forms the colony of Victoria. Preparations for this memorable journey were made
with great care, and the party was selected and organised by the distinguished
scholar and explorer who was to take charge of it. Major Mitchell, since his first
expedition in 1831 down the Namoi or Peel to the Karaula, has been recognised as the
most scientific Australian explorer. At this period (1836) the Port Phillip settlement,
to which we shall devote the succeeding chapter, assumed a degree of importance
through a cause that produced a great emigration wave from the mother country
and the adjoining colonies. This cause was the great expedition of the late Sir
T. L. Mitchell. The continent of Australia was beginning to attract attention as a
suitable home, and one of the conspicuous effects of emigration was the establishment
of the colony of South Australia. Its blue skies, and its fine wool which brought
such high prices, created a thirst for visiting this land of peace and plenty. No
wonder then, when the great explorer’s description of Australia Felix issued from the
press, that thousands were moved to emigrate to its shores.
In March, 1836, he left Sydney on his third expedition, with five and twenty
able-bodied men, most of whom were convicts. He preferred this class, as they were
more obedient, and behaved themselves with the hope of receiving indulgence. Mr.
Stapylton acted as assistant, and Piper and Barney were his aboriginal attendants.
He traced the Lachlan River through the marshes, and found that it united with the
Murrumbidgee. The party frequently passed a whole day without seeing water, and,
on one occasion, they travelled 110 miles before they fell in with any. Barney, who
was unable to restrain his admiration for a dark beauty belonging to a new tribe with
which the expedition had fallen in, allowed his heart to become irretrievably
vanquished by her winning smiles, and felt as enraptured, when she rewarded him with
a lover’s look, as Romeo when he saw Juliet lean her cheek jipon her hand; but the
narrative does not recount whether
Her eyes would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing, and think it were not night.


He was determined that he would carry off the object of his affections by force, if
necessary, and so far forgot himself as to propose to fire on the tribe, so that he
might frighten the men away and thus secure his dusky angel. The end of the story
is that Barney, in addition to losing his heart, lost his situation, and was sent back
by Major Mitchell to repent of his love adventure. They reached the Darling in the
month of May, and the Murray (which they found to be one hundred and sixty-five
yards wide) near the junction with the Murrumbidgee, in the month of June. On the
27th May, when at the Darling, near Bcnanee Lake, they were surrounded by numbers
of aborigines; but after keeping up a brisk fire for a quarter of an hour, they
succeeded in killing several, and drove the survivors to a place, named in
commemoration of the fight, Mount Dispersion. The season was so dry that
Mitchell was able to step, dry shod, over the Darling, the great river of New South
Wales, The party, after making the junction of the two rivers, then crossed the
Murray, and journeyed up the left, or southern bank. At last Port Phillip discovery
commences. Keeping to the southerly side of the river, a tributary fifty yards wide
was passed, which the Major took to be the Hovell, now the Goulburn. This was a
mistake : it was the lower part of the Loddon. He stood upon Mount Hope on
June 28th, and on the following day the party left the Murray in a southerly direction
at a part of its course between the Loddon and the Campaspe, where it was ninety-nine
yards wide. A most inviting country now lay before them, and the effect of the
scene was heightened by the favourable time of the year for viewing landscape, since
it was midwinter, when the country is clothed with verdure. He next discovered
the Yarraine, and a week afterwards the Loddon in lat. 36J°, both being the same
river. He constructed a bridge to cross over in the morning, but found that the flood
which came down in the night, completely submerged it. The Pyrenees Hills were
next passed, as well as the bold Grampians. They met with the Avoca on July 10th,
and the Avon on the following day. A creek was honoured with the name of
Eichardson, the botanist. On the eleventh of the month our hero first saw the
great mountain, Dividing Eange. The Wimmera brought him to the country of
circular salt lakes, which are very numerous in certain parts. The land
throughout the district is very fertile, and in some places better suited for
agricultural pursuits; although close to the South Australian border
§ood ciops, if the season be tolerably favourable, are obtained. As it was the
middle of winter, the party found their progress so much impeded by the deep
and adhesive mud—commonly called “glue-pot” in that district—that they sometimes
only covered three miles a-day. The first night spent upon Mount William, of the
Grampians, was not full of very pleasant reminiscences, as, at a height above sea-level
of 4500 feet, the cold was so intense that the sticks of the camp fire were alight at
the one end and covered with icicles at the other. On another occasion, when the
party was spending a night on those ranges, two of their number felt the cold so
keenly that they sustained permanent injury in consequence. From the Grampians
Major Mitchell returned to the river which Piper, the aboriginal, had discovered was
the Wimmera. It was on this garden of Victoria that the gallant chief conferred
the attractive title of AUSTEALIA FELIX. In the far west, on July 31, the party


came upon the Upper Glenelg, which was one hundred and twenty feet in width and
twenty deep, and it was resolved to follow it down. The mud of the Wannon proved
a fresh impediment. The Major’s enthusiasm was aroused when contemplating the
future that was in store for this fertile region, “with all its features new and
untouched, as they fell from the hands of the Creator.” Embarking on this river,
whose beauty charmed the travellers, they arrived at Discovery Bay, where the stream
joins with the ocean ; but, greatly to the disappointment of Mitchell, it was, owing
to the presence of a sandy bar, unnavigable. This river was named after the
Secretary to the Colonies, Lord Glenelg. Returning a little to the east of Glenelg,
Portland Bay was reached ; but, contrary to their expectations, no rivers of any
importance fell into it, and they only saw the Surrey, Fitzroy, and Shaw. Presently,
coming across shoe tracks and a tobacco pipe, Mitchell felt certain that these
unmistakable tokens of civilisation declared the presence of Englishmen, nor was he
mistaken, for before him lay the farming settlements of the Messrs. Henty, who had
already been in this remote region for two years. Whaling at this place was in a
flourishing state,"and flocks of sheep, the property of the Henty family, and imported
from Van Diemen’s Land, were to be seen scattered over the fine pastoral country.
This settlement at Portland Bay, effected by the late Mr. Thomas Henty, of
Launceston, as early as 1834, is the first instance of permanent colonisation made
within the colony of Victoria. Mr. Henty sent over several flocks of sheep and
several agricultural implements under the charge of a portion of his large family,
for he had seven sons, all of whom have since held prominent positions in both
colonies. So well adapted was the district around Portland Bay for pastoral and
agricultural pursuits that it was soon converted into a scene of thriving industry and
financial progress. Henty, like Batman and his company, of whom we shall treat
later on, claimed a grant of the country settled through his instrumentality, on the
ground that he had rendered valuable what was hitherto of no account. But Lord
Aberdeen, the Secretary of the Colonies, refused the claim, at the same time
intimating that there was a probability of considering an application for a
grant for land with proper improvements as a special case. But Mr. Henty
and his family acquired no advantage beyond others as compensation for
their enterprise and successful pioneering when the Colonial Government
were disposing of the lands in the locality. We must return to Mitchell. At
Messrs. Henty’s settlement they procured a little flour, and, setting out on the
homeward journey, which was much retarded by the moisture of the soil, they
repassed the Grampians. The precipitous south-western point of these ranges was
appropriately named Mount Abrupt. Keeping somewhat to the south of the route
taken on the outward journey, Mitchell ascended Mount Macedon, from whose
well-known summit a fine view of the country to the south, with Port Phillip in the
distance, was obtained. The leader, finding the delays through the heavy mud likely
to cause a break-down in the commissariat department, resolved to advance with a
small party of his men and one month’s provisions, leaving Mr. Stapylton behind
with two months’ supply. The natives mentioned to them the existence of a lake,


named by them Cadong, somewhere to the north-west of Cape Otway, which was the
receptacle of tributaries from the Dividing Range. The next stream touched by
them was named the Hopkins. Taking a more northerly course, he reached Mount
Cole, of the Pyrenees, on September 28rd, so called after an officer who had been
engaged with him in the campaign of the Pyrenees. A range of granite reposing
on Tarrengower, on the Campaspe, received the appellation ol Mount Byng.
Hastening on, he crossed the Goulburn, October Bth, and gained the Ovens in a
week. Reaching the Murray two days later, he arrived at the Murrumbidgee
three days after his provisions had given out. During this memorable journey many
natives were met with. Those on the Murray were very numerous, and in some
respects, superior to any of the other tribes. They could sail their canoes with great
dexterity, and it is said that the nets they used very nearly equalled those of
European manufacture. As Sir Thomas was a soldier, he bestowed military names
on some of the most conspicuous scenes of Victoria. For instance, when he ascended
the noble Mount Macedon, and viewed the Bay of Port Phillip before him and Mount
Byng behind him, he changed its name from Wentworth, as already mentioned, to
Macedon ; and to complete the historical associations which came into his mind, he
gave to Mount Byng the name of Alexander, after the conquering son of the great
King of Macedon. His designation of Australia Felix was a happy one and is an
acknowledgment of the pleasure he felt when viewing the beautiful, and, in some
instances, romantic scenery with which he met. Australia Felix, as a name, has had
no slight influence on the progress of the country, as nothing outweighs or
transcends a good name; and it was with pride that the colonists, who henceforth
began to pour into the country, could feel that, after all, although the world is very
matter of fact, now and again it is possible to dwell in the realms of poetic
imagination, or climb the heights of Parnassus.
In concluding this chapter of stirring incidents, we may mention that Piper,
the Bathurst aboriginal, was rewarded to his heart’s content. Clad in a red coat, and
presented with Governor Darling’s old cocked hat and feather, with a brass plate
suspended round his neck, on which was engraved the words “ The Conqueror of
the Interior,” he could assume an air of importance and pardonable pride in such a
gay and striking costume. The expenses of the expedition, which was absent some
eight months, amounted to T1550. Its results were incalculable. The natural
resources of an extensive region began to undergo development, and the consequent
rapid advance of the colony has taken place; townships where thriving industries
exist, homesteads where the cold, chill blast of pinching poverty is unfelt, the iron
horse in its onward track, assisting in the general work of reclaiming regions for
centuries the haunts and happy hunting grounds of the poor aboriginals,
disappearing, alas ! rapidly with the advance of the paleface. Again, the capital of
Australia Felix, one of the finest and most rapidly advancing cities in the world,
can point with pride to its literary and scientific institutions, its churches and public
buildings, its conveniences of travel, its men and women of aesthetic taste and
culture, its artists and authors, and that medium of knowledge—an ably conducted


Press. The fearless soldier, the perfect gentleman, the polished scholar, the
considerate parent, the philanthropic citizen, and the intrepid traveller, lived to
enjoy, for a period of nineteen years, the honour of knighthood conferred upon him
by his Sovereign; and for his splendid discovery he was well rewarded, the New
South Wales Council voting him one thousand pounds.
Exploration had now performed that part of the work which has given to
Victoria such great prosperity. It disclosed a long unknown region, and exposed a
country of so surpassing beauty and fertility as to gain for the colony the title, which
it would in all probability have retained, had not Her Majesty, on its separation from
New South Wales, signified the desire that it should receive her name. The next
step in the process of development was its colonisation. Residents of the old world
and of the adjoining colonies had ere this begun to turn their eyes towards Victoria
as a country in every way well adapted for occupation. Indeed, as early as 1824, some
gentlemen had contemplated running sheep at Western Port, and in 1827 Batman
and Gellibrand applied for a grant of land at the same place. In 1834, Colonel
Verner, one of the heroes of the Peninsular War, resident at Churchhill (a word well
known to Ulstermen) County Armagh, Ireland, with a few other gentlemen, formed a
project for establishing a settlement near Twofold Bay, by introducing a number of
families from the North of Ireland; but, owing to its reception by the Government,
the idea was abandoned. In those early days much apprehension existed in the
minds of some as to the advantages derivable from colonisation, and consequently
the Government exercised great caution in the examination of the various projects
bearing on the subject that were submitted for their approval. Such a course may,
for several reasons, have been justifiable then, but could not find any defenders now,
since the success which has attended the founding of so many colonies is plainly
manifest. Colonisation has, from early ages, attracted the attention of different
nations. The question as to whether the country was gained by conquest or ceded
is unimportant. Equally unimportant is the consideration of the motives which led
to its occupation, for, when traces of inactivity disappear, the conditions under
which it was taken possession of vanish. The first intimation we have of
an attempt to colonise is that recorded of Terah, who moved with his family from
Ur of the Chaldees into the land of Canaan; and as under a theocratic Government
it was customary to build an altar for sacrifice, so, likewise, it served to mark the
foundation of a colony, or the spot where one could be founded. The subjects of a
sovereign state, owning no allegiance to any foreign power, and depending more or
less upon the mother country, who comprise a settlement beyond the boundaries of
the state which is the seat and centre of authority, are termed colonists, and the
settlement is a colony. They do not found the colony ;it is the state whence they came is
the founder. It provides the necessary protection; enacts, in the first instance,
suitable laws ; and administers all the affairs of the community. The architect who
draws the plans of a house might as well be said to have laid its foundation.
Poetical license introduces into the practical matters of life many words which are
hopelessly confusing. The earliest great colonisers of secular history were the


Phoenicians, who were induced, with the hope ot extending their commerce, to plant
colonies upon the islands and along the southern coast of the Mediterannean, which
enabled them to maintain their maritime supremacy. Carthage was the chief of
Phoenician settlements, and she, in order to maintain possession of her conquests,
was in turn compelled to form colonies, which remained subject to her power, She
had a sea-line of one thousand four hundred miles, containing three hundred towns.
Greece was a great colonising power. The Greek colonies could not,
however, be termed integral portions of the Empire, as they asserted their
independence, but at the same time expressed their sympathy for the mother-city
by not taking a hostile share in any wars in which she was engaged. Greek
emigration was often caused by internal dissensions, or by the expulsion of the
inhabitants of conquered cities. Hence Greece never had an empire; it was a
number of scattered independencies. Rome and her colonies bore quite a different
relation. She had two kinds of colonies—the Colonia Romana and the Colonia Latina.
Although these colonies differed in many respects, yet both were started with the
sanction and under the direction of public authority —ex consensu publico, non ex
secessionc. The Spaniards were not colonisers in the true sense of the term, and
were only driven, by their thirst for wealth, to land on the shores of America.
Portuguese colonisation in America is similar in most respects to that of
Spain. The slave-trade owes its development to them, as the proximity of Brazil to
the coast of Africa enabled them to supply the want of native labour by importing
purchased or stolen Africans. The French, although gifted with a faculty for
conciliating the prejudices of native races, and even, through their powers of
adaptability, for assimilation with them have not hitherto been successful colonists.
Their colony in Algeria is of a military nature, and serves to strengthen the fighting
powers of the Republic.
Whether the Germans will prove successful in their colonial possessions
remains to be seen. The Dutch at an early period were the principal carriers of the
world’s trade, and still have extensive possessions in the East Indian Archipelago,
as well as a settlement at the Cape—a fact which is known by the British to
their cost.
There is no race that has equalled the Anglo-Saxon in unexampled energy
and capacity for colonisation. Throughout the globe are to be found numerous
dependencies or colonies owning allegiance to the sway of Great Britain, and
contributing to the supremacy of the Empire by their enterprise; and, whilst the
colonist looks on the land of his adoption as his permanent home, where he can found
a family, and rear it in physical, intellectual, and moral strength, yet ever regards with
a fervent love and a growing patriotism the interests of the country of his birth, as
inseparably connected with those of the community of which he forms a part.


CHAPTER IY.
THE THREE HEROES OF VICTORIAN COLONISATION.
1834-1838.
iff*# have carried ourselves in the history of Port Phillip up to the year
. ►l/l/ 1830, and the reason for doing so has been to complete the account of
exploration; but now it will be necessary to contemplate the dawn ot
colonisation in Victoria, which set in at the end of the year 1834. A brief allusion
has already been made to tire whaling, farming, and pastoral establishment of the
Messrs. Henty at Portland Bay. This was unavoidable, as otherwise the narrative of
Major Mitchell’s discoveries would have been incomplete. Henty, Batman, and
Fawkner have played a conspicuous and important part in the initiation of Victoria s
progressive development, and it is our intention to review the actions of each of
these men in chronological order. Mr. Thomas Henty was a landowner and bankei
at West Tarring, in Sussex. He was one of six gentlemen who kept flocks of merino
sheep, and raised his stock from purchases made at the sale of King George the
Third’s merinoes. That monarch was an enthusiastic farmer, and icceived, as a
special favour, from the King of Spain, a few of his celebrated flock. The Spaniaids,
anxious to keep the wool-growing industry to themselves, made it a capital offence
to export this superior class of sheep from their country. Mr. Henty was always
successful, when he competed with his stock at the Board of Trade Exhibitions, and
first became connected with the colonies through the sale of his carefully selected
rams for exportation to Australia. He determined on trying his fortune in Western
Australia, which at that time held out considerable inducements to settleis, and
accordingly sent out three of his sons with a well selected stock and outfit, and a
retinue of forty servants. In accordance with the land regulations, this small colony
was entitled to a grant of over 80,000 acres, but the quality of the soil was pioved to
be so indifferent that the settlement removed, in 1832, to Tasmania, hoping to obtain
land under the liberal regulations then in force, but which on their arrival they found
had been altered. Shortly afterwards Mr. Thomas Henty himself came to Tasmania,
and went from thence to inspect the land at Swan River, but which, like his sons, he


pronounced to be very inferior. Mr. Edward Henty, anxious to learn more of the
capabilities of Australia for settlement, sailed lor Spencer s Gull, and spent two
months in the examination of the surrounding country. He then secured a passage
in the “ Thistle,” for Launceston, but the schooner, owing to heavy weather, was
forced to run into Portland Bay. Taking into consideration the appearance ol the
country, which looked so promising, and the tact that no good land was to be
obtained in Tasmania, he resolved on making a trial in this part ol Port Phillip,
which was so far removed from any settlement, that in all probability many years
would elapse before it should be required by Government. At this time Buckley,
the run-away convict, was the only white man in Southern Australia nearer than
King George’s Sound on the west, and Twofold Bay on the east, kitted out by his
father with a plentiful supply of farm implements, fruit trees, and vegetable seeds,
and having a large number of cattle, sheep, and servants, Mr. Edward Henty,
accompanied by his brother Stephen, sailed lor Portland Bay, and landed there
on November 19th, 1834. He was the first white man who planted his loot on
Victorian soil with the intention of remaining in the country. Previous to his
arrival, Mr. William Dutton, in December, 1828, visited Portland Bay in the schooner
“ Madeira Packet,” on a sealing voyage, and lormed one ol a boat s crew that
landed at Blacknose Point. Mr. Dutton subsequently visited Portland Bay on
many occasions while engaged in the whaling trade, and erected some temporary
huts, which were used by his whalers when calling in there. To Mr. Henty,
however, is due the honour of having formed the first permanent settlement in
Victoria. The first building erected in Victoria was Richmond House, where
Richmond Henty, the first Victorian native citizen, was born. Edward Henty
turned the first furrow, planted the first vine, was the first squatter, and sheared the
first sheep in Victoria.
Had the Hentys established their first settlement at Port Phillip Bay, there
would be no difficulty in ascribing to them the honour of having been the pioneers
of the prosperity of Victoria; but since Portland Bay is so far removed from the
principal business centre of the colony, their claim is somewhat set aside. One
thing, however, is certain : the Hentys are the founders of the agricultural and
pastoral pursuits of Victoria, and therefore have an indisputable right to rank on a
level with Batman and Fawkner, both of whom have numerous friends to support, by
arguments, their respective claims. The late Mr. Edward Henty, who died in 1878,
may justly be regarded as the father of the colony, and the establishment at Portland
may fitly be termed the cradle of Victorian Industry. Mr. John Batman is the
second of our heroes to whom attention must be directed as a prominent and
conspicuous figure in the early colonisation of Port Phillip. He was the third son of
William Batman, of Parramatta, New South Wales. He was born in that town in the
year 1800, but, owing to a love affair, when about 20 years of age, was obliged to
remove to the adjoining colony of Van Diemen’s Land. His father, who left
England with the object of engaging in missionary work in the South Seas, died
on the 29th of February, 1834, at Parramatta, at the age of sixty-nine. He resided


iii the colony lor thirty-seven years, and won the respect and esteem of a large circle
of friends. Mrs. Batman, sen., who survived both her husband and son John —the
former by five years and the latter by three months—was comfortably maintained in
her widowhood by her affectionate lad. John was tall, well made, of prodigious
strength, marvellous energy, and had an unconquerable determination. Fond of
adventure and excitement, he was a true son of the chase, taking the greatest
pleasure in a good kangaroo hunt, or “ rounding up ” the wild cattle. Such a man
could hardly be expected to remain content with a monotonous life. He was,
moreover, an experienced bushman, and was, therefore, in every way well fitted
to undertake the opening up of new country. He made himself famous by his arrest
of Brady the bushranger, who was the leader of a corps of these marauders, numbers
of whom roamed through the country and harassed the remote districts of the
island. The severe punishment inflicted on them at times, and the love of plunder,
forced these adventurers to organise themselves in bands. Wherever they went they
spread terror. They changed their hiding places with marvellous rapidity; at one
time seeking refuge in the thick and almost impenetrable scrub, at another lying
concealed in a mountain cavern. Batman was anxious to put down these outrages,
and, accordingly, issuing forth from his mountain home, he went in pursuit of this
chief of the banditti, and succeeded in capturing him in a gully under the Western
Mountains, in 1825. For this brave act he received a grant of one thousand acres of
land. He was also remarkable for his success in dealing with the aborigines, who
had now become the foes of the colonists, and for his efforts in averting bloodshed
and inducing the blacks to submit themselves peacefully, a reward of 2000 acres was
granted him. Such a man was John Batman, who may be credited with the fame of
being the first coloniser of the shores of Port Phillip Bay. After a long and painful
illness he died on Monday, May 6th, 1839, at his residence, on the slope of Batman’s
Hill, and was buried in the Old Cemetery, on Flagstaff Hill. In 1882 an obelisk
of dressed Milestone, raised by public subscription, was placed over his remains.
Mr. John Batman and Mr. Joseph Tice Gellibrand were the first private
individuals to apply for a grant of land on our shores. Mr. Gellibrand was
ex-Attorney-General of Van Diemen’s Land, and seems to have been very zealous in
promoting emigration to Port Phillip, and to him may be attributed much of
the ultimate success in its colonisation. Indeed, he lost his life through his
enthusiasm for the new country; for in the year 1836, penetrating the western
interior, accompanied by his friend, Mr. Hesse, and tempted to go further, the
two travellers either perished from hunger or were speared by the aborigines.
In the year 1827 Batman and Gellibrand, after having carefully considered the
question of taking up land in Western Port, determined to address the Governor of
New South Wales on the subject. Since it was known that he desired to have that
place colonised, and that in 1826 an effort was made to form a settlement by
despatching some convicts and soldiers (who were subsequently recalled), there was
a hope for a favourable reply to their application. The letter stated that they wanted
permission to obtain a grant of land at Port Phillip, proportionate to the property


which they intended to embark; that they were in possession of some fine flocks
of sheep, fine herds of cattle and oxen, and some first-class horses. -they proposed
to send a portion of this stock, to the value of <£sooo, to Western Port, and that the
whole establishment should be under the personal direction of Mr. Batman, who
would constantly reside there. This request complied with all the conditions
necessary to ensure a grant, but, although so reasonable, nothing came of it, as the
Governor, it seems, had no power in the matter; and so we hear no more of Batman
in connection with Port Phillip history from this date until the year 1855. In 1834,
Mr. McKillop, acting on the advice of Mr. John Gardiner, an enthusiastic belies ei in
Port Phillip’s future, made an unsuccessful attempt to reach Western Port o\erland
with stock from Now South Wales. He had not gone far on his journey hefoie
he became greatly impeded by the scrub of the Alpine gullies. He journeyed
onward, notwithstanding, until he came to Lake Omeo, but the nature of the country
forbade the attempt to penetrate further.
Let us return to Batman. Disappointed, he was determined not to be baffled
in his scheme, and he therefore resolved on making another attempt. He had
already received in Tasmania large grants of land, which he stocked with great flocks
of sheep. He had married and had gathered round him a large family; but, although
in the enjoyment of peace and plenty, he still had a longing for Port Phillip, about
which from time to time so many glowing accounts reached his ears. He held
frequent conversations with the Governor at Hobart Town upon the project.
Colonel Arthur approved of the undertaking, and considered Batman in every way
suitable to form such a settlement. But how was the idea to be carried out ? It was
hopeless applying to the Governor of New South AY ales, yet something must be done !
It was eventually decided to form an association for the colonising of Port Phillip, and
accordingly the following fourteen members were enrolled: —Messrs. John Batman,
Joseph Tice Gellibrand, James and William Kobertson, Henry Arthur, John Sinclair,
Charles Swanston, James Simpson, John Thomas Collicott, Anthony Cotterell,
William George Sams, Michael Connolly, Thomas Bannister, and John Helder
Wedge.
A little vessel—the “ Rebecca ’’—was purchased in which to cross, for the
purpose of thoroughly examining “the general character and capabilities of Port
Phillip as a grazing and agricultural country.” Batman was to have charge of this
mission. The description of this visit to Port Phillip is drawn from two sources of
information —his own journal and his official report of June 25th, 1835, to Colonel
Arthur, Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, and the charts and deeds accompanying it.
The “Rebecca,” thirty tons, commanded by Captain Harwood, cleared on May 12th,
bound for Port Phillip Bay. Batman took the seven Sydney blacks, who had been with
him for years, and might now prove useful in opening up a communication with the
Port Phillip aborigines. There were also on board Robert Robson (mate), four
seamen, and three white men —James Gumm, William Dodd, and Alexander Thomson.
The vessel reached George Town, where she was detained by unfavourable weather.
She got off on the 18th, but, bad weather still prevailing, it was not until the 27th


that she got clear of the coast, when a favourable wind springing up, they made for
the shores of Australia, entered the caves of Hunter Island on the 29th, sailed some
twelve miles inside, and anchored in Port Phillip Bay by Indented Head. Batman
landed the same day, so great was his anxiety to see the country, and, as a result of
his inspection, was very much pleased Avith its appearance. After repeated visits and
journeys inland, he succeeded in coming to an agreement with the nati\ T es, avlio
appeared to understand that they agreed to grant six hundred thousand acres of land
“to him and his heirs for ever” in consideration of blankets, knives, looking-glasses,
tomahawks, beads, scissors, flour, &c. They signed tAvo deeds to that effect, which
Batman had already prepared, and “ a tree was marked in four different Avays to
define the boundaries.” This transaction, which Avas effected on the 6th of June,
1835, and by which Batman thought he Avas put in possession of all the land
extending from Merri Creek to Geelong, took place on the Northcote Hill. Batman
established his position upon the rising ground of Indented Head. Previous to
returning to Yan Diemen’s Land, he gave directions to the three white men as to
Avhat Avas to be done during his absence, and Avith James Gumm he left a written
authority to warn off all persons found trespassing on his property. He sailed from
Port Phillip on June 14th, and reached Launceston after a passage of thirty-six
hours. On June 25th he sent a communication to Governor Arthur, Avhich
contained a full account of his doings while at Port Phillip, and enclosed a copy of
each of the deeds executed by the natives. On July the 12th the celebrated
Buckley, one of the three prisoners aaJio had escaped in 1803 from Governor Collins,
came to Batman’s camp at Indented Head. On the Home Government having been
informed of the transaction, it Avas disalloAved, on the principle that the title to
Australian territory was parliamentary, and not derivable from the aborigines. Much
correspondence ensued and at length, it Avas adjudicated that a compensation in the
form of a remission of purchase money for land to the extent of T7,000 be granted.
At one of the colony’s land sales in Sydney on February 13th, 1838, an agent,
on behalf of the association, purchased a quantity of land to the westward of Geelong
for the sum of T7,919 75., from which T7,000 Avas remitted as the compensation
agreed upon.
Mr. John Pascoe Fawkner is the third of the heroes in order of time avlio
assisted materially in the colonisation of Port Phillip. He landed upon the shores
of Port Phillip in October, 1803, Avith the expedition sent out from England to form
a settlement in that portion of the Australian continent, and accompanied it to Yan
Diemen’s Land shortly afterwards, Avhen Governor Collins pronounced the country
unfit for human habitation. He Avas at that time a lad of eleven years of age. He
commenced life as a saAvyer, and used “the fringes of time” to advantage by improving
his mind, and thereby making up, to some extent, for the deficiencies of his early
education. His was a varied experience, for he afterwards turned his attention to
farming, acted as a bush laAvyer, kept an hotel, Avas a newspaper proprietor and
editor. In those early days of the colony persons of respectability and with a slight
knoAvledge of law, Avere alloAved to plead, and AA r ere known as “Agents.” Mr. Fawkner


was long an agent in the court at Launceston, and in the primitive times of Port
Phillip, held the same position in the police office at Melbourne. He, like Henty and
Batman, came from Launceston. For a long time he had been contemplating a visit
to Port Phillip, and was busily engaged in forming a colonising expedition at the
time of Batman’s first departure from Launceston for that place. He proposed to
accompany his rival, but the latter would not allow him.
Owing to not having secured the vessel which was intended to convey his
party to Port Phillip, some time elapsed before another, the “Enterprise,” was fitted
out for that purpose. Meanwhile, Batman had returned to Launceston, where he
created a great sensation by his accounts of the new country, and the large section
of territory he had purchased from the natives. Fawkner now, with redoubled energy,
hurried on preparations, and had the vessel ready for sea on July 27th, with a cargo
of blankets, tomahawks, knives, a whale boat, horses, ploughs, grain for farming,
garden seeds, plants, and a varied assortment of fruit trees, 2,500 in number. On
that date his party, which consisted of Captain J. Lancey, William Jackson, Robert
Hay Marr, George Evans, and his servant Evan Evans, James Gilbert (blacksmith)
and his wife Mary, and a ploughman named Wyse, sailed down the Tamar, and
reached Georgetown, where contrary winds and bad weather, as in Batman’s case,
detained them until the 4th of August. In the meantime Mr. Fawkner had become
so ill from sea-sickness that he landed, taking with him one of the horses that were
on board, and returned to Launceston. He gave Captain Lancey all necessary
instructions and placed him in charge of the expedition, which reached Western
Port on the Bth of August. She was followed by a small sloop named the
“Endeavour,” fitted out by the late Mr. J. Aitkin, which arrived almost at the same
time. This gentleman was a sheep farmer in Tasmania, and was one of the earliest
and most successful squatters in Victoria. This place was selected on the
recommendation of Hunter, the master of the “ Enterprise,” as the place of
disembarkation, and as suitable for a settlement, he having been acquainted with it
some years before, when engaged procuring wattle bark. The party landed, and
spent a few days in the examination of the country, which they found inferior in
quality. They accordingly sailed for Port Phillip Bay, which was entered on the
15th of August. As they were passing the Duck Ponds, near Shorthand Bluff, a
whaleboat, manned by some of Batman’s Sydney natives, came off and told the
voyagers that all trespassers must keep away, as John Batman had bought all the
land about there. The “Enterprise” proceeded up the Bay by the Southern
Channel, landing each day to examine the country, and arrived opposite Point
Ormond. There some of the party, including Mr. William Jackson, went ashore,
made their way through the bush, and crossed the YarraYarra River above the Falls.
“No eligible spot was found on the east side of Port Phillip Bay.” The directions
that were given to those on board the “Enterprise” were, not to settle down except on a
river; and they must have been aware of the existence of the Yarra Yarra, since
Robson, the mate of Batman’s vessel, on his return to Launceston, described it
to Captain Lancey. The vessel proceeded up the river, and anchored on the 20th


of August, 1835, clear of the bar in the channel of the river. On the 21st, four of the
new colonists, with two of the workmen, pushed off in the whaleboat to explore the
inlet. They pulled up the wrong arm, and after rowing many miles were obliged to
turn back on account ot the vast number of fallen trees lying in the stream,
and through the want of water; that in the river being salt and unfit for drinking.
Hence this stream was named the Saltwater. They returned to the vessel exhausted,
and on the next day went up the other branch. After pulling for about an hour and
a-half they reached the basin of the river, with which they were very much charmed.
This place, they all agreed, was to be the site of the new settlement, and they
resolved to have the vessel brought up. Batman, it is evident, must have noticed
this spot while on his tour in the month of June from Geelong to Merri Creek, since
he says in his journal, “This will be the place for a village.” They returned late
that night to the “Enterprise,” which was lying opposite to Williamstown; and on
the next day she was towed up the river, and moored to a tree on the spot where the
Custom House now stands.
On the 7th of August, Mr. John Holder Wedge, who had been requested by
some of the members of the syndicate to visit Port Phillip for the purpose of
investigating how far Batman’s glowing account of the country was correct, landed
at Indented Head. He proceeded at once to examine the country. On his second
tour of discovery, accompanied by Buckley, he found and named the Bar won.
During his third tour of discovery he was astonished to find an unexpected visitor
moored in the basin of the Yarra, which, on enquiries, he learned was the “Enterprise,”
belonging to Mr. Fawkner, of Launceston. Mr. Wedge states she crept into the
port unnoticed by Batman’s party at Indented Head, or by the tribe of natives
who were encamped with them. He lost no time in communicating to Captain
Lancey that the “ Enterprise” party were trespassers on land belonging to Mr. John
Batman’s association, and expressed a hope that there would be no interference with
the property; pointing out, at the same time, that the unoccupied land on the
opposite side of the river was equally suitable for Mr. Fawkner’s undertaking.
Captain Lancey replied to this notice by declaring that the purchase was illegal, and
that the whole transaction was valueless, whereupon a dispute arose, which, it may
safely be said, has not yet terminated.
It was upon this occasion that the name “Yarra Yarra” was given to the
river by Mr. Wedge, who understood that the exclamation uttered by his native boy,
when coming in sight of it, was the name by which it was known to the aborigines;
but he subsequently discovered that the words signified water in motion, as the boy
applied them to designate a waterfall.
To return to Fawkner. The spring season was already setting in, and
they were forthwith engaged in ploughing and planting. On Tuesday, the Bth
September, five acres of wheat were sown on the ground selected, close to Mr.
Langland’s foundry, and a garden was laid out between that and Batman’s Hill,
where the first hut of the party was pitched. Some of Fawkner’s party returned to
Launceston in the “Enterprise,” when it was decided that each member should be


left free to adopt his own course of action with respect to revisiting Port Phillip.
Captain Lanccy, Mr. George Evans and his servant, Charles Wyse, James Gilbert
and his wife, remained behind, and continued making improvements.
On the ‘2Gth of August Sir Richard Bourke, Governor of New South Wales,
issued a proclamation forbidding contracts for lands with the aboriginal natives,
declaring the possession of such lands within the limits of New South Wales, without
license or authority from Her Majesty’s Government, illegal. Meanwhile many
settlers from Tasmania crossed in search of new country, and the shores of Port
Phillip began to assume a busy aspect. Fawkner himself arrived in the “Enterprise”
on the 10th of October, the anniversary of his first visit in 1803, and formed a
cultivation paddock of 80 acres on the south side of the river, Batman’s party
having obliged him to remove from the original spot. The ground was marked out
eastwards and northwards into ten-acre sections, and after a little while “ The
Father of Melbourne ” removed further up the river, and just behind the Custom
House, in the present Market Square of the city, opened a public-house and hotel.
In these early days, and while busily engaged in his numerous duties, Mr. Fawkner
started, on the Ist of January, 1838, the first newspaper. It was called The
Melbourne Advertiser, and consisted of a written sheet, as press and types were not yet
amongst the indispensable wants of the growing community. But after this
quaint-looking document had given to the world of Melbourne all the news obtainable
in its nine issues, by the aid of a few types and a rude little printing press,
constructed chiefly of wood—which now forms one of the interesting memorials of
the past in our Public Library—the Advertiser appeared in a more journalistic-looking
dress. He had, however, been transgressing the press laws, which were then very
stringent, and a suspension of the publication was ordered until two sureties each in
the sum of X‘3oo were forthcoming. The necessary arrangements were very much
retarded by the state of the colonial law at that time, and it was not until the 16th
of February, 1839, that he was able to issue his paper, which came forth under the
new title of the Port Phillip Patriot. Meanwhile, a rival sheet, published by Messrs.
Arden and Strode, who had complied with the terms of the law, appeared on the
26th of October, 1838, as the Port Phillip Gazette. Nevertheless, Mr. Fawkner is in
all justice entitled to be considered the father of the Victorian press, as well as of
its metropolis.
Before he commenced the publication of the Advertiser he had begun to import
British books and periodicals, to which visitors to his house had free access. He
did not confine his energies to these matters, but took an active and conspicuous part
in Colonial politics. He was a member of the first Municipal Council in Melbourne,
and of the first Legislative body in Victoria. He died, after a short illness, on the
4th of September, 1869, and four days afterwards his remains were followed to their
resting place in the Melbourne Cemetery by the largest number of people that
ever attended a funeral in Victoria. Tens of thousands came to pay the last tribute
of respect to the man who had done so much for the colony, and who was so
universally known and esteemed.


CHAPTER Y.
MURRAGARK, THE WILD WHITE MAN OF AUSTRALIA.
1803-1835; 1835-1856,
it is but a half-souled life which cannot recount a romance, so would it be
but an insipid history not possessing a striking episode. When we
vlßlii consider that it is for sentiment’s sake many of those truly grand
occurrences which go to make up history have been brought about, we can easily
perceive how largely romance contributes to enrich the chronicles of a country.
Sentiment, romance, and faith constitute a trinity which has created the
politico-historical events of the world; just as it has produced, not only these events,
but also those ot every individual born into this world, and which we define by the
comprehensive word, the life of a man. Without romance there is no sentiment;
without sentiment there is no faith. A faithless country is an unsentimental country,
and an unsentimental country is an unromantic one.
The colony of Victoria furnishes an episode which, although it would require
a most elastic imagination to designate as a romance, yet might be employed to
advantage by the writers of such a tale, and which only needs a wider publicity to gain
an increased interest for the colonists of Victoria. Many of the youth of that colony
who are now qualifying themselves to step into the ranks which circumstances of
various descriptions and the march of time yearly thin, doubtless have not heard or
read much of William Buckley, who, as already stated, deserted from the settlement
near Point Nepean on 27th December, 1803. During the long interval which elapsed
between that event and the arrival of Batman, this extraordinary man had been
wandering with the natives in the vicinities of Port Phillip; and now, after thirty-two
years, presented himself to Batman’s party at Indented Head, not tar from the
entrance of Port Phillip. This party consisted of whites and blacks, and employed
their time in cultivating a small piece of ground. They would occasionally be
favoured with a visit from their “ sable” friends, and would consequently feel no surprise
at the arrival of fresh faces of “ ebony;” but were one of their own kinsmen to present
himself, their astonishment would become suddenly intensified. Early in July such
an apparition greeted them. This unexpected visitor, accompanied by dark men, of
greater stature than them, with frame erect, with long and shaggy beard and unkempt
locks, and sparsely clad in a rough sewn rug, a skin of lighter colour than that of his
companions, and a countenance suggestive of different blood -they gaze on him with
mute wonder. What did it all mean ?—this advent of a white man dressed as a
savage, and steeped in the dregs of barbarism ? Was he a shipwrecked seaman ?
Probably; and yet they had no knowledge of a shipwreck occurring on the coast.
Why should he prefer the customs of savages ? An uneasiness creeps over this


party of whites, for they were alone and were strangers; but they will interrogate
him. “Who are you?” The man was silent. Again the question was asked;
this time there was a visible effort made to reply.
That native tongue, which he had not used for a long time, must have sounded
strangely to his ears ; but notwithstanding this, he felt that he had fallen in with
men of another race, to which he himself must, at some distant period, have
belonged. Was it a dream ? No ! it could not be. What a strange conflict of
thoughts must have then taken place ! Always a man of reticence, and devoid of
clear perceptions, he became puzzled and confounded by such a situation. He was
unable to speak, but he will communicate by some means with these people, and,
after a momentary bewilderment, points to his arm. There were to be read two
letters —W. and B. The first might stand for William; but what did the second
represent ? Many guesses were made. All this time, the poor, stupid, and
disconsolate man’s brain was recovering from a lethargy of thirty-two years’ duration;
and now, aroused by the sound of his old familiar mother-tongue, he uttered slowly
“ William Buckley.” The next word which dropped from his lips was “ bread,” a piece
of which had been put into his hands. By degrees these new settlers learned his
history. He escaped from the settlement at Port Phillip in 1803. In bondage,
he fled from his own people, and wandered forth, no matter where, to enjoy
that which is the birthright of every human being—freedom. What mattered it to
him whither he strayed ? Better to he free in the solitude of the unexplored wilds
than a prisoner in the stateliest palace ! With these thoughts urging him to do and
dare, he, with three others, ran off. One was shot by the sentry, one was never
again heard of, and the third, named Gibson, returned to the camp on the
24th January, 1804, in a very exhausted condition. At last, truly alone, what
a prospect lay before him ! Free in one sense, and yet in bondage in another—the
feeling of dread —as much so as if the convict chains were at that moment chafing
his ankles and his wrists. Buckley was born at Macclesfield, Cheshire, in 1780. He
was first a bricklayer, and afterwards entered the Cheshire militia; but, owing to his
magnificent physique, was transferred to the fourth regiment of the line, known as
the King’s Own. There he committed some offence, for which he was sentenced to
transportation for life. He avers it was a trifling affair, but that can hardly be true,
as one account states he attempted to raise a mutiny at Gibraltar, and another
is that he had been found guilty of receiving stolen property. He, however, consoled
himself with the reflection that the heavy penalty he had to undergo was only
one of the many instances of severe punishment meted out, in those days, to soldiers
and sailors.
When the Government determined to form a penal settlement on the shores
of Port Phillip, he was selected as one of the prisoners to sail by the “ Calcutta,” and
was appointed to act as servant to Governor Collins. Doubtless this position would
allow him to enjoy a certain amount of freedom, and consequently, he would not
experience as much difficulty in deserting as his shipmates, who would be placed
under closer surveillance.


He must certainly have been long forgotten when he paid his visit to Batman’s
camp, and, in all probability, his history both before and after his desertion in 1803,
was unknown to any of those whom he now, for the first time, met. But if his
appearance provoked the astonishment of the white men, what effect must it have had
on the aborigines when they were brought to look at him by the three native women
who (according to his story given to Mr. Morgan) first discovered him. His gigantic
size and proportions must have impressed his “sable” visitors with that feeling of
regard which people in a primitive state are ever ready to evince, while his restless
disposition, together with his lack of intelligence and mental vigour corresponding
exactly to theirs, would, on the grounds of affinity, render him a suitable associate.
But perhaps what secured for him a friendly welcome to their hunting grounds was
his supposed resemblance to a deceased friend called “ Murragark,” and whose memory
they now sought to perpetuate by conferring on him that name. Had Buckley been
the possessor, even in a limited degree, of any of the higher attributes of mind, he
might have become the ruler of numerous tribes (a fortunate circumstance, no doubt,
for the new settlers that he was not); but as it chanced, his lack of ideas, his reserved
and sulky manner, together with his utter aversion to well-regulated action, made his
presence among his savage friends valueless. He could not impart what was unknown
to him; and as his association with the criminals on the voyage from England would
have the tendency to rid him of all moral sentiment, and his escape from the
settlement would foster a growing aversion to that civilisation, prepared to inflict on
the wrong-doer punishments from which he sought a release by flight, it is but natural
to expect that he would sink to the level of those in whose society he now found
himself. During his sojourn of thirty-two years among these savage inhabitants,
what scenes had he not witnessed ! Who could have told such a tale as he ? What
a revelation of savage life might he not have given ! Wandering from place to place
with these dusty denizens of the bush, admitted to their councils and their confidence,
what scenes might he have depicted, what adventures related, what exploits rehearsed,
what customs and habits recounted ! But no ! This first and only white man really
known to them does not aid us in drawing aside the veil. What assistance might he
not have given them ! He could have taught them how to build, he could have shown
them how to cultivate the soil, and he might have led them to a knowledge of and a
love for civilisation. There he was, though, a savage, in the last stage of barbarism,
his person betraying a want of cleanliness —strange for a soldier —subsisting on berries
and shell-fish, dwelling in the open air or in caves, one of which, known by the name
of Buckley’s Cave (near Queenscliffe), tradition marks out as his resting place. He
lived, he thought, he acted like his “ sable” friends. He was one of themselves. He
could not raise them to a higher standard, because he was on an equality with them,
and he passed an eventful but a useless life. It appears that he had all but despaired
of seeing his countrymen again, and he was ignorant of a generation having passed
since he laid eyes on those from whom he had parted. He was not without some
idea of many years having elapsed, as the marks of age and a sensation of failing
strength warned him of such being the case. In such a state of body and such a


frame of mind, the only prospect lie could hold out to himself was that of ending his
days among his savage friends, and hence we can readily conceive what must have
been his feelings when he once again saw his countrymen. He furnishes an instance
of the possibility of a man forgetting his mother tongue when not mingling for a long
time with those capable of conversing in it. Probably, in his case, as he was an
uneducated man, such an occurrence might have been brought about much more rapidly
and effectually than in the case of those who had a comprehensive knowledge of their
own language; while at the same time it would be highly interesting to have discovered
at what period he really felt it beginning to fail him. There is no doubt, however,
that when found by the whites he was unconscious of ever having spoken the English
language; and even after he had recovered the power —long unexercised —to express
himself, his replies to questions were very vague, and tended to increase the mystery
surrounding his past life and experience. Another incident of the same kind occurred
in a different part of Australia, but was brought to light in a similar manner. This was
the case of an English seaman named Morrill, the only survivor, at the end of three
years, of a crew which had been shipwrecked in 1846, in the vicinity of the newly
opened-up country of Port Denison, on the north-eastern coast of Queensland.
Morrill for seventeen years passed his life with the native tribes of that part of the
country, when at length, owing to the advance of colonisation in that direction, he
was discovered and released from his enforced life with the aborigines.
Buckley’s “Life,” edited by Mr. John Morgan, and published at Hobart Town in
1852, has been accepted as a tolerably reliable account of his long residence amongst
the aborigines, but it disagrees, in some respects, with the descriptions which have
been given of the man by the old settlers. But we must return to Buckley. When
the deserters started off into the unknown wilderness, they crossed the river Yarra,
and, rounding the head of the harbour, they travelled westward to the Yowang Hills.
From thence they went to the sea-coast of the Geelong harbour, and satiated their
hunger with shell-fish. Passing round Indented Head, they obtained a view of the
“Calcutta,” which fatigue and hunger tempted them to signal, but they failed
to attract the notice of those on board. It was at this juncture that his two
companions decided to return to the settlement—a course which Buckley could not be
induced to adopt, as the love of freedom and the dread of punishment forced him to
prefer remaining in his present melancholy and solitary position. So his two
companions left him, one of whom, Gibson, as previously stated, returned to the
settlement, no tidings of the other runaway having ever afterwards been heard. This
man Gibson acted wisely, as he lived to learn that by his subsequent good conduct
he had gained an excellent reputation. Buckley now followed the sea-coast in
a southerly direction, subsisting almost solely on shell-fish, but suffering very
severely from the want of fresh water to drink. Having at length reached a part of
the coast where a stream of fresh water, which was called by the natives the Karaaf,
ran into the sea, he determined on erecting a hut. Here he passed his first summer,
shortly afterwards being seen by the natives, and installed into the tribe. He
was always treated kindly by them, and, on the occasion of a tribal battle, was


carefully removed to some place, so as to be out of danger. Buckley states that these
battles were of frequent occurrence, and, while they lasted, were remarkable for the
ferocity displayed. Content to remain with the tribe which first received him,
he began, much to the delight of his native friends, to acquire a fair knowledge of
their language; and it is to be presumed that this circumstance enabled him to woo
and win a “fair” young widow of twenty, who, however, played him false by deserting
him for one of her own race. Nemesis, however, overtook his faithless fair one, her new
lover rewarding her with a spear thrust for some act of infidelity. For some time
past Buckley had withdrawn from the tribe, and resided at his Karaaf mansion,
where a young native female presented herself, and sat down as his wife ; but she,
too, like the previous partner, failing to find sufficient attraction in her new home,
also leaves him. In all probability, it was owing to his despair of hoping to find the
proverbial “ love in a cottage ” that he was induced to rejoin the tribe. At very
rare intervals, during these long years, vessels with white people on board
visited the Port Phillip waters. It is supposed that they were engaged in the
whaling trade, and came from Sydney and Yan Diemen’s Land ; or probably,
in some instances, they were escaped convicts from those settlements. These
colonies were now, after many years, beginning to attract considerable notice.
Whilst Buckley had all this time been wandering over parts of Port Phillip, now the
scene of great manufacturing industries, the country had been explored and settled
from south to north. Colonists from Yan Diemen’s Land, anxious to obtain, for the
use of their increasing flocks, more pasture land, turned their attention to those very
lands of which Buckley had hitherto been the solitary white occupant. At last the
white man arrives. Buckley is informed by two of the natives that three white
people and six blacks had landed from a ship off the coast of Indented Head.
Desirous of seeing his countrymen once more, he determines to visit them as soon as
possible, more especially as he had heard, in the meantime, that a plan was formed
by the natives to murder the new comers, the object being plunder. He, in addition
to a neighbouring tribe which is to be invited to assist them in this attempt, is
expected to lend his aid; but being resolved to overthrow their plot, sets out at once
in the direction indicated by the two natives who first informed him of the party’s
advent, and arrives at Batman’s encampment on the following day, the 12th of July,
1835. Two circumstances caused him to hesitate whilst he was nearing the spot; he
had forgotten that he was unable to use his native speech, and also that he was still
a prisoner of the Crown. The latter fact pressed heavily on his mind, and in a state
of despondency he sits down. Presently he is espied by some of the natives, who
point him out to his countrymen, and then the meeting which we have already
described takes place. He was surprised to learn, although he know that many
years had elapsed since the memorable day of his flight, that it was now the month
of July in the year 1835. Having been informed that the “ Rebecca ’ would return,
he went back to his old companions, and persuaded the natives to desist from their
attack until the return of the ship, which would repay them for waiting, as there
would be considerably more plunder on board.


This reported mediation on Buckley’s part is not credited by the founders of
the colony; Mr. Batman, however, ascribing their friendly behaviour to his good
offices. When Mr. Batman returned with his family from Launceston, Buckley
entered his service as interpreter, and subsequently went with the party to
the settlement at Batman’s Hill. His life here was not a very pleasant one, as
he was subject to many cares and worries, things always intolerable to a man of his
disposition, and more especially so, as he missed that freedom from all anxiety which
he had so long enjoyed. Moreover, he was continually haunted with the dread of
being re-arrested, but his fears on that point were soon set at rest, as Mr. Wedge, one
of Batman’s party, brought him a document giving him a free pardon, and granted
by Sir George Arthur, then Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen’s Land. Buckley
was thus, on the 25th of August, 1835, once more a free man. Why Batman did not
fall in with Buckley’s tribe was that it seems to have been located in an area south and
west of the Port Phillip entrance, but occasionally wandered as far as Indented Head,
which was distant about twenty miles from its head-quarters. Each tribe claimed a
certain area, out of which it was not customary to reside, only at intervals paying a
friendly visit to an adjoining tribe with which it was on good terms ; and so jealously
did they observe keeping within their own boundaries, that it was customary to send
notice of their intention of paying such a visit. Buckley, perhaps out of jealousy,
pronounced the transactions of transferring the land as a hoax. He says there are no
chiefs claiming or possessing any superior right to the soil, and whatever authority
they exercised consisted in being heads of families. This, however, does not
coincide with the writer’s experience, who distinctly remembers Jacky Tacky, the King
of Benyeo—pronounced Benaio —always asserting, when the question arose in
conversation, that the land in that part of the Western District belonged to him.
Could this man have been a Jagajaga ? Fawkner ridiculed the whole transaction, and
held the same views as Buckley as to its legality. Conspicuous among the native
chiefs who transferred the land to Batman were the three brothers Jagajaga, whom
he met at the Merri Creek. We have already briefly sketched the history of
the transaction, and now present to the reader this extraordinary document, the most
interesting in the archives of Port Phillip history.
“ Know all persons, that we, three brothers, Jagajaga, Jagajaga, Jagajaga, being
the three principal chiefs, and also Cooloolock, Bungarie, Yanyan, Moowhip,
Mommarmalar, being the chiefs of a certain native tribe called Dutigallar, situate at

Had this colossal purchase been ratified by the Government, a bargain would
have been made in excess of any that the world will ever witness. In an amazingly
short time the settlement became prosperous, and when the goldfields were
discovered, this territory, for which the natives were willing to accept a few blankets
and tomahawks, increased in value to more than T50,000,000. The three brothers
Jagajaga, who were the principal parties in the conveyance of the land, are described
as remarkable for the height of their stature and kindness of heart. Their favourable
reception of Batman may be ascribed to a belief (already referred to) held by the tribe
to which they belonged, and shared in common with other tribes in Australia, that
white people are persons belonging to their own race who have come to life again
after death. This theory of the transmigration of souls is doubtless an attempt to
account for the appearance of those of a different colour, rather than a belief which
some would describe as superstitious. Mr. Macleay, who accompanied Captain Sturt,
it will be remembered, owed his popularity with a tribe of the aborigines to them
believing he was their returned friend Eundi. These three men had recently lost a
brother, and Batman’s appearance bore such a striking resemblance to that of the
deceased, that they received him with open arms. Perhaps this circumstance may
have also weighed with them when they parted with the land on such easy terms.
Whatever right of ownership they possessed to enable them to transfer the half
million of acres lying between the Merri and Geelong could not be advanced in the
case of the additional conveyance of Indented Head, as it was a territory which lay
beyond their prescribed boundaries. Let us, however, return to Buckley.
We hardly think, notwithstanding the desire Victorians have of doing everything
on a large scale, that a shirt of the same huge dimensions as that made by
Mr. Batman’s eldest daughter for Buckley, and probably the first linen article of
wearing apparel turned out in the colony, would be found now-a-days adorning any
of the windows of the fashionable hosiery establishments in Melbourne. The
following description of this remarkable man is from the pen of Mr. Fawkner : —“ He
stood six feet five inches in his stockings, was not very bulky, nor over-burdened with
nous. He fell to the level of the blacks; he did not, by any means, elevate or raise
them, or instruct them in any manner. He ran from the settlement at Point Nepean,
on the 24th December, 1803, in company with three others. When Buckley first
joined the whites at Indented Head, he had totally forgotten his mother tongue ; and


the first words he spoke in it was a reply to a desire of one J. Green whether
he would have some bread to eat, and ho struggled some time, and then pronounced
the word ‘ bread.’ The Governor Arthur party, when news had arrived that this
runaway had been found, showered favours innumerable upon him —first, in order
to obtain all the information that he possessed, and also to prevail upon him
to refuse to give any part of his local knowledge to those persons not belonging
to the co-partners. Alas ! the hivip of matter was too mindless to yield any very
useful information. He had always loved his ease, had travelled but little, and was
cheerfully supported by his two gins ; or, in other words, by two of the female
aborigines. He refused or was unable to account for the fate of the two men that
left the camp in 1803 ; indeed, some persons entertained notions on this head that
rendered his appearance amongst the whites not very agreeable. And he very
soon displayed a spirit of antagonism to the whites; in fact, he stated, one day,
when hard pressed, that he should rejoice if the whites could be driven away ; he did
not care how, so that the aborigines could have the country to themselves again.”
When he left Mr. Batman’s service he was appointed constable; thus, for the
second time, serving under his superior officer, Captain Lonsdale, who was formerly
in Buckley’s regiment. He also accompanied Sir Richard Bourke and others in
tours about the country. He soon became discontented with his position as constable,
although he had succeeded in receiving an increase of pay of <£lo a year —namely,
from £SO a year, with rations, to £6O. He was continually harassed by disagreeable
occurrences, caused by the troubles always arising with the natives. Anxious that
there should exist a friendly feeling between them and the settlers, he undertook all
guidance in native affairs; which occasionally, not turning out as successfully as
anticipated, would bring down on him all the blame, together with accusations of
indifference or chicanery in the transaction.
Batman always warmly supported him in these quarrels, and Fawkner just as
vehemently opposed him. Tormented as he was by the conflicting opinions of these
two inveterate foes, he earnestly desired to betake himself to a quieter home. The
outrages between the natives and the new settlers were an additional source of
annoyance to him. He employed all the means at his command to prevent the
growth of these repeated atrocities that frequently occurred on either side, by
counselling the fresh arrivals to proceed with consideration in their dealings with the
natives. His advice was not heeded, and the result was that frequent reprisals took
place: the natives were shot down like dogs, while they in turn retaliated by theft of sheep
and the murder of shepherds. Seeing that he could no longer endure the distracted
life he had been leading for some time past, he went to Hobart Town, where he
resided for nearly twenty years. The Van Diemen’s Land Government gave him
employment for a time, and when he was unable, through failing strength, to work any
longer, allowed him a pension of £l2 a year in 1850, which the Legislature of Victoria
subsequently supplemented by £4O. In 1840 he married, and in January, 1856, he
was fatally injured by a fall out of a vehicle. On February 2nd of the same year he
was followed to the grave by his son-in-law and Mr. Morgan, the editor of his life, as
chief mourners.


GHAPTEE VI.
THE PORT PHILLIP SETTLEMENT.
1835.
||ii|E have already seen in the fourth chapter how the beginning of the
tSlvSiii co^on^sa^on °f what was to be the present colony of Victoria was
effected, and, in order to fix some specific date, we selected 1838, on
account of it being the year in which a final settlement was made over Batman’s
purchase of the extensive tract of land from the natives. It will be readily understood
that this was necessary, as Batman had been regarded as the first coloniser of the
shores of Port Phillip Bay, and, consequently, it would have caused a break in the
history if some mention of what interested his association and the country at large
had not been made. If Port Phillip sent the convicts destined for her shores to Van
Diemen’s Land, that island carried out the Christian precept to the letter of returning
good for evil, by giving to Port Phillip the first impetus to colonisation, and at the
same time spreading the germs of civilisation. Being the colonists who had founded
the Port Phillip settlement, it was natural for them to desire to have the closest
relations possible with the country from which they had emigrated. Without straining
the question of this desire to too great an extent, it may be said that if they were not
directly instrumental in effecting the separation of the settlement from New South
Wales, they were at least the promoters of an act which was consummated some years
afterwards, and of which this desire was the first faint trace. Governor Arthur,
having all along furthered by every means the colonising enterprise of his people, and
not being unwilling to have Port Phillip added to his jurisdiction, would therefore do
everything consistent with legitimate proceedings to promote their wishes. Mr.
Montague, the Colonial Secretary, in his reply of July 3rd to Batman’s letter addressed
to Governor Arthur, and dated Hobart Town, June 25th, 1835, declares that “ Port
Phillip is not within the jurisdiction of this colony.” The treaty made by Batman
was valueless, as the Crown had not, as in the case of the South Australian
Colonisation Society, given any authority for the proceeding. After warning Batman
not to rely on the Crown confirming the title to the land, allusion is made to the
action of the Home Government in refusing to comply with Mr. Henty’s application
for a grant of land. Governor Arthur, however, forwarded, on July 4th, a
communication on the subject to the Home Government, in which he gave a history


of Port Phillip, of it being first visited by the first Governor ot Van Diemen s Land,
that it was within easy distance of Van Diemen’s Land, and that it had been settled
by some of the colonists of that island. He asks that it be placed under the
Government of Van Diemen’s Land, but erred in his prediction that the settlement
would be productive of good results to that colony, inasmuch as the numbers who
left the island for Port Phillip caused a very marked depreciation in the value ol
property. He alludes to Batman’s conduct in his negotiations with the native tribe
as marked by a strong sense of justice, and as calculated to win their good opinions.
But his suggestion that Batman should be rewarded for his labours in the exploration
of the country by a liberal grant of land indicates the existence ol a suspicion in the
Governor’s mind that Batman’s transaction would not be sanctioned by the Home
authorities. Such was the case, for as soon as Governor Bourke heard of the
application for Port Phillip to be placed under the jurisdiction of Van Diemen s Land
he issued a proclamation, dated August 26th, 1835, in which it was stated that all
persons obtaining possession of land in the same manner as Batman had would be
considered as trespassers, at the same time defining the limits of the Government of
the Colony of New South Wales. The proximity of Van Diemen’s Land to Port
Phillip rendered it more easy of access than Sydney, which was much further removed
both by land and sea—the distance between the Tamar and Port Phillip Heads being
somewhat less than 200 miles of water; whereas to reach Sydney by sea 600 miles
had to be traversed, and by land the distance was very nearly as great, and
decidedly more troublesome.
It was in vain, then, for the association to hope for any favourable hearing of
their case from the Colonial Government, and they, therefore, appealed to the Home
authorities, with the result that Lord Glenelg’s reply to Governor Arthur, dated
January 23rd, 1836, sets forth that “All schemes for making settlements by private
individuals or companies in the unlocated districts of Australia have, of late years,
been discouraged by Her Majesty’s Government.” Major Mercer, who went home
to represent the association, met with very poor success. The Home Government
now advised the Port Phillip settlers that their country formed a part of New South
Wales; that it did not constitute a colony, but merely a settlement over which another
colony exercised full jurisdiction ; and that it was “ comprised within the limits laid
down in the commission of Governor Sir Richard Bourke.” The despatch
containing this announcement is dated February 15th, 1836, and came from Lord
Grey, assistant to Lord Glenelg at the Colonial Office. That is to say, it was a
portion of that vast area then forming New South Wales, which embraced all the
territory lying between 10° 37 south and 39° 30 south, and all the inland country
lying to the eastward of the 129 th degree of east longitude. Previous to these limits
having been fixed, the colony of South Australia had been established by Act
of Parliament in 1834, and a large section towards the western side had been allotted
to it. Some years later on, the Port Phillip settlement received a small slice on the
south side, and in 1859 a very much larger portion was bestowed on Queensland.
Thus New South Wales, after having presented each of her three daughters with a


handsome dowry, was divided into two parts—one, that of which Sydney is
the capital; the other, the northern and central tract explored by Stuart, and now
belonging to the colony of South Australia.
We must now glance briefly at the causes of emigration from Van Diemen’s
Land to Port Phillip. The reports of the rich pastoral country of the new settlement
which would reach the Van Diemen’s Land settlers, anxious to obtain, on easy terms,
some of that territory for their flocks of sheep, were perhaps the chief cause ; but
there were others equally as effective in urging them to cross over to Port Phillip.
As there was no necessity (unless choice prompted) for the New South Wales settlers
to reach Port Phillip by sea, it may seem reasonable to suppose that the first wave of
immigration would have set in from thence, as at this time the stations had been
extending westward and south-westward, that being the natural direction for them to
take. Doubtless, had the Western Port settlement been attended with success, and
the route chosen by Hume and Hovell been of a less difficult nature —which could
have been done, had they but known of it, by going a little more to the westward,
and keeping out of the Alpine country —there would have been a desire to try
the capabilities of the new country. The proximity of Port Phillip to Launceston
also favoured the influx of settlers, who were an enterprising class of men; but
however much these facts influenced numbers to rush across the Straits with sheep
and cattle, there was another circumstance which, although not the primary cause,
was nevertheless a potent factor in the desire to seek a new home. So has it ever
been. Small territory and numerous population caused Greece to colonise.
Internal dissensions also proved powerful motives, and hence that country had
numerous colonies. Abuses of a political and social character existed in \an
Diemen’s Land. It was a convict settlement, and to maintain order, stringent
measures had to be adopted ; but an inability to discriminate between what was due
to law-abiding gentlemen, attracted by the reports of Van Diemen’s Land as a field for
the investment of capital, and to the criminal class, which required the strictest
surveillance, produced entire dissatisfaction.
These gentlemen contended that their liberty was interfered with, and, after a
severe struggle, they succeeded in 1825 in securing freedom from the control of the
New South Wales Government. The liberty of the press, at this time, was very much
curtailed, and the abuses which it sought to expose could not receive a due publicity.
Henry Melville, one of the principal movers in the effort to have this state of things
remedied, was cast into prison. He was the proprietor and editor of the leading
paper in Hobart Town, and in his well-known pamphlet, A Voice from the Antipodes,
he sought to hold up to public scorn the evils of military juries, the severe punishment
meted out for theft, the iniquity of the quit-rent system, as well ' scandal of
land jobbing, and many other hardships which the community obliged to
undergo. In this struggle he spared neither means nor labour. s the state
of affairs in the island. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at tha 3to escape
from despotism would lend additional force to the determinatio settlers to
invest their capital in the newly-discovered territory of Port Phil! numbers


which left Van Diemen’s Land would have been much larger, in all probability, had
there existed a greater sense of security in the Port Phillip settlement. The case was
otherwise. The natives were mistrusted, and few of the early settlers escaped from
their predatory excursions. They confined their demonstrations of hostility, however,
to the murdering of shepherds and stealing of sheep, seldom advancing as far as the
home stations of the settlers. As a precaution against a pre-arranged attack, large
bells were suspended in trees to sound an alarm. In the neighbourhood of Geelong,
many of these were employed for this purpose. The settlement of Port Phillipj would
not have fallen so easily into the hands of the British Government, had the aborigines
equalled in numbers and courage the New Zealanders. There is a strong
probability that the enmity of the natives was frequently aroused by some foul play;
and as the Hocks of the settlers were, to a very great degree, exposed night and day,
their hostility could not have been lasting or deep-rooted. The dingo, which is
unknown in Van Diemen’s Land, was in those times an enemy which inspired more
dread than the blacks; and at the first public meeting of colonists in Port Phillip, it
was decided to offer a reward of five pounds per head for every wild dog that was
killed. Moreover, Governor Bourke’s proclamation paused the more prudent to hesitate
before risking their lives and property in a new settlement holding out no protection;
and the knowledge that, since they would be acting contrary to the terms of that
proclamation, they could not claim any redress for losses sustained, acted as a still
greater deterrent from crossing over to Port Phillip. But when the Government
acknowledged the settlement and undertook to guard the rights of the settlers, and
when, in addition, the report of the discovery of the fertile Western District reached
them, a trade between Port Phillip and Van Diemen’s Land rapidly sprung up. The
first live stock imported into Port Phillip came from that colony within six months
of Batman’s first visit. On October 26, 1835, five hundred sheep were landed at
Point Gellibrand (now Williamstown) by the “ Norval,” Coltish, master, for Batman’s
Association. This vessel also brought over at the same time fifty pure Hereford cows,
the property of Dr. Thomson. Among other passengers who came over in the
“ Norval” was Mr. B. Cotter, long known as a medical practitioner, who afterwards
removed to South Australia.
This importation of live stock was followed by many others of a similar nature;
but the number of settlers leaving Van Diemen’s Land, with the intention of settling
at Port Phillip, had the effect of depreciating the value of property in the former
colony, in some instances only half its previous value being realised. The reputation
of the new settlement having reached tiie colonists of New South Wales, and Major
Mitchell’s glowing account of the Western District having been made known,
“ overlanders” with live stock from the Murrumbidgee and Murray crossed over and
occupied the fertile country through which the Goulburn, Ovens, Campaspe, and Loddon
Livers fiowed. The first overlander was Mr. John Gardiner, formerly of the Van
Diemen’s Land Bank, who started from the Murrumbidgee towards the end of 1835,
accompanied by Hovell and Hepburn, many other well-known colonists following
soon after, and thus aiding in swelling the population and property of the hitherto


unknown Port Phillip. In three weeks Mr. Gardiner and Ids party travelled from the
Murrmnbidgee to the Yarra. One day, by an agreeable surprise, the monotony of their
journey was relieved by the unexpected meeting of Major Mitchell’s expedition on its
homeward-bound journey. On their way to Port Phillip numbers of natives were seen,
all of whom were in the best of spirits and perfectly harmless. Majors Eyrie and
Ebden followed soon after along this same route. Gardiner’s Creek was so called
from Mr. Gardiner having located his first head station there, from which he
subsequently removed to the rich pastures of the Upper Yarra. Hovell and Hepburn,
who accompanied him on the overland journey, returned to Sydney in a whale boat.
The spots selected as the most suitable for squatting were between Geelong and
Melbourne, and the country to the westward. Vessels plying between Williamstown
and Van Diemen’s Land conveyed such large quantities of stock destined for the
Western District of Port Phillip, that it was estimated 38,000 sheep had been imported
from Launceston up to the month of August, 1836. If we add to these figures the
number that reached the settlement from New South Wales up to the same date, we
should have quite a respectable total.
The “ Norval” in February, 1836, was again chartered to convey sheep to be
landed at Point Gellibrand as before, but, on this occasion, with a disastrous result.
Mr. Ferguson, Captain Swanston’s agent, was making arrangements for the reception
of 1000 per this vessel; but the vessel having been taken to Western Port, the sheep
were landed there, with orders from Mr. Bead, the owner of the “Norval,” to drive
them across to the Yarra, which was reached with seventy-five remaining out of the
original number.


CHAPTER YU.
PROGRESS OF THE PORT PHILLIP SETTLEMENT.
1836-1843.
the year 1835 marks the era when the colonisation of Port Phillip began
E in real earnest, it is no less true that the year 1836 determines the epoch
when the introduction of a few of the necessary aids to civilisation took
place. It was in the latter year that the settlement received the recognition of the
Sydney Government, that the first report on the condition of the settlement was
made, the first census taken, the first public meeting of colonists held, the first chief
magistrate and the first Custom house officer appointed, the first survey of the
harbour made, the first sheep were shorn, the first chief constable with thirty
prisoners arrived, the first commissariat officer appointed, the first case of arbitration
decided, the first survey of the site of the present city of Melbourne, with the
buildings standing thereon, made; the first military and police arrived, the first officers
of the Survey Department and the first Colonial Surgeon landed, the first extensive
loss of sheep happened, the first survey up the banks of the Yarra accomplished, the
first aboriginal mission established, and the first religious service conducted ; and
then, passing from the conditions of life to the contemplation of its end, the first
child (Goodman’s) was buried on the Flagstaff Hill, and what may by courtesy be
called the first public funeral took place. At first, then, the settlement had neither
magistrate nor policeman, and each one was obliged to act according to the best of
his lights. The first notification of an appeal to authority was in March, 1836, when
Dr. Thomson, a justice of the peace at Hobart Town, and the first Colonial Surgeon
in the settlement, was requested by Mr. Fawkner to adjudicate upon a disputed
question between Mr. Henry Batman and himself. There were many colonists in
Port Phillip at this time who had held the commission of the peace in Van Diemen’s
Land, and whose decisions the settlers were as willing to accept as if they had been
fully invested with authority to act in that capacity in the new settlement. Amongst
their number was the late Mr. James Simpson, a universally respected fellow-colonist
and gentleman of the highest character, who, at the earnest request of the
settlers, consented to act as arbitrator. He was for a long time afterwards a
magistrate in Port Phillip, and, by his general demeanour, gained the esteem which
he so much deserved. A public meeting of the residents in Melbourne was held, at


which seventy-seven persons were present, amongst whom were James Simpson
(chairman), D. R. Pitcairn, G. McKillop, T. Roadknight, W. Roadknight, W. J.
Sams, John Aitken, John Batman, Henry Batman, J. H, Wedge, J. P. Fawkner, J.
C. Darke, and J. Sutherland. A resolution was passed—“ That Mr. James Simpson
he appointed to arbitrate between individuals disputing on all questions excepting
those relating to land, with power to name two assistants when he may deem fit.”
At the same meeting, another resolution was passed—“ That a petition be
prepared to Governor Bourke, praying him to appoint a resident magistrate at Port
Phillip, as well as other magistrates from among the residents.”
Mr. Robert Sanders Webb had been clerk in the Sydney Custom House, and
rose ultimately to be Collector of Customs in Melbourne. He was afterwards
dismissed for some trivial affair by Mr. La Trobe, and, having appealed to the heads
of the department in England, received the appointment of chief clerk in the Sydney
Custom House, where he discharged his duties in a modest, amiable and unassuming
manner until his death. The first chief constable of the settlement was Mr. Joseph
William Hooson, a man well known to all the early colonists. He had been a soldier,
and received a wound in the head, which appeared to have caused a derangement of
his intellectual faculties. After some time, he obtained property in Melbourne,
which subsequently became valuable, and left the police, as he was becoming
an imbecile. He used to talk to himself for hours in the street in the most erratic
manner. Eventually he lost his property, and, out of charity, was appointed
street-keeper by the corporation. This poor fellow died in Melbourne in the year
1849. In this year, the harbour was surveyed by Lieutenant Hobson, R.N., in the
“Rattlesnake.” The inlet at the head of the bay is named from this officer, and Mounts
Martha and Eliza were named by one of the Lieutenants of the “ Rattlesnake,” in
compliment to Mrs. Lonsdale and Mrs. Batman respectively. The entrance to Port
Phillip is difficult to navigate, but, by the aid of surveys and skilled pilots, few marine
tracks are better known. A circumstance, however, which occurred in the month of
December, 1862, is apt to shake our confidence in even the best known tracks. The
ship “Lightning,” while sailing outfrom the Heads, in the usual course, struck against
a rock, near to the surface, which was merely one of two others quite adjacent, and
accounted dangerous, although further from the surface than the first. The depth
of water over these rocks, which have since been removed by blasting, was sixteen,
twenty-four, and twenty-nine feet respectively.
In this year, too, Mr. Russell and his assistants traced up the banks of the
Yarra, noting its breadth and depth at various points, the extent to which it
is navigable, and affected by the tide, observed the nature of its banks and bed, the
rapidity of its current, and the height to which it rises in flood time. This gentleman
also made the survey (already mentioned) of the site of Melbourne. This eventful
year also witnessed the murder of Mr. Charles Franks and his shepherd by the
blacks, at his station at Mount Cottrill, near the River Eau or Werribee. Their
remains were interred at the Flagstaff Hill, and the funeral, which was attended by
all the residents of Melbourne, may justly be termed a public one.


A second census was taken in Port Phillip on November Bth, which showed
the population to he one hundred and eighty-six males, and thirty-eight females, oi
an increase, in less than six months, of forty-four males, and three females. In
December, 1886, an aboriginal mission (the first) was established, at Port Phillip,
with Mr. George Langhorne as missionary to the aborigines, and Mr. John Thomas
Smith as his assistant. The station was on the banks of the Yarra, at a spot which
is the site of the present Botanical Gardens.
Previous to this meeting Governor Bourke directed Mr. Stewart, who w 7 as a
Territorial Magistrate, and also Police Magistrate at Goulburn, New South Wales, to
proceed to the settlement, to which, in spite of his proclamation, people persisted in
going, and report on the place and condition of its inhabitants. 1 hat gentleman, who
wa s the first to exercise magisterial authority in Port Phillip, arrived in the revenue
cutter “Prince George ” on June Ist, 1830, and on the same day convened a meeting of
the inhabitants, which was held in Mr. Batman’s parlour on the hill. A considerable
number of the principal settlers attended. Amongst other official matters laid before
the meeting, there came up for consideration the best means to be adopted for settling
the differences that had arisen upon the land question, and also what steps should be
taken to prevent new settlers from indulging themselves, by appropriating in a
wholesale manner the different parts of the rich country they had entered. Placards
were posted on the trees forbidding the acquisition of land from the aborigines in any
manner, and stating that it could only be obtained by purchase and grant from the
Crown. Arbitrators were appointed to adjudicate upon differences among the present
occupants, who were to have land sufficient for their flocks, until otherwise required.
At the same meeting it w 7 as announced that the first census of the colonists of Port
Phillip was taken on May 25th, 1836, and that the population numbered one hundred
and seventy-seven souls, and comprised 142 males and 35 females, and that the live
stock and other property, which they had imported, amounted in value to TllO,OOO.
Mr. Stewart also found that the settlers possessed 35,000 sheep, with a number of
cattle and horses ; the stock being spread over a large tract of country. The necessity
of recognising the settlement, and giving it some kind of local government, having at
length been deemed desirable, tw 7 o officials were sent from Sydney to act on behalf of
the Sydney Government —the first was Captain Lonsdale as chief magistrate, the
second was Mr. Bobert Sanders Webb as head of the Customs Department. Captain
Lonsdale came out to Sydney as an officer in the 4th Regiment, and entered the civil
service of the colony. He was a Police Magistrate in New 7 South Wales, and w r as
therefore fully qualified to undertake the care of the young community. He arrived
in Port Phillip Bay by Her Majesty’s ship “Rattlesnake” (Lieutenant Hobson, R.N.),
on September 29th, 1836, and brought with him a small military and police escort.
Mr. Batman received him in a very loyal manner, and immediately placed part of his
house at the disposal of Captain Lonsdale and his family. He was allowed to be a
high-minded gentleman, and unswerving in purity of motive, of a most equable
temper, gifted with good abilities and zealous in the discharge of his duties.


When he was superseded at the end ot‘ three years as local head of the
community by Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe, who nominated him as police magistrate
ol Melbourne, he was presented by his numerous friends with a testimonial. Mr.
Ilobt. Sanders Webb, Chief of the Customs Department, Mr. Skene Craig, commissariat
officer, Mr. Eobert Eussell, and his assistants, Mr. Fred. Eobert Darcy, and Mr.
William Wedge Drake of the Survey Department, Ensign King with a detachment of
the 4th Eegiment, thirty prisoners as labourers, and Mr. Joseph William Hooson as
chief constable, arrived in Port Phillip Bay by the brig “Stirlingshire,” on October
sth, 1836.
The aboriginal population at this time, within a circuit of about 30 miles
round Melbourne, numbered 700, including men, women, and children. Port Phillip
was now beginning to grow into importance, audit, therefore, behoved the Governor of
Sydney to visit this interesting and far-off region. In March, 1837, this distinguished
visitor, Sir Eichardßourke, arrived in Port Phillip Bay, by the “Battlesnake.” He was
accompanied by Captain Hunter, military secretary, George Kenyon Holden, Esq.,
his private secretary, Captain P. P. King, as his travelling companion, and Mr.
Eobert Hoddle, surveyor in charge. One morning, shortly after their arrival, the
shock of an earthquake was felt. Sir E. Bourke feared that it would be unsafe to
build a town on the spot, but no repetition of the shock occurring, the town of
Melbourne was laid out by Mr. Hoddle. The Governor objected, but subsequently
assented to the width marked out for the principal streets, which was 99 feet, and desired
that smaller streets, 33 feet wide, to be called mews, should be made. He named the
capital Melbourne, in honour of the British Premier of the day; Collins-street, after
Lieutenant Governor Collins ; Flinders-street, after Captain Flinders ; Bourke-street,
after himself; Lonsdale-street, after Captain Lonsdale; Swanston-street, after Captain
Sivanston; Eussell-street, after the late Lord John Eussell. At the mouth of the Yarra,
on the west side, Mr. Hoddle marked out the site of Williamstown, which was so named
after the reigning sovereign. An address was presented to Sir Eichard Bourke by
the inhabitants, to which he made a gracious reply. He then made a trip into the
interior, under the guidance of Mr. Wm. Jackson and Buckley. He visited Mount
Macedon and Geelong, the site of the latter having already been fixed upon, and
which he named after the native name of the hill on which it stands.
He was born at Thornville, Limerick, Ireland, in 1777, entered the Ist Foot
Guards in 1798, and received a wound in both jaws while serving in Holland. In
1806, he was at the siege of Monte Video, and afterwards saw service in the
Peninsula. He acted for some time as Lieutenant-Governor of the eastern district
of Cape Colony, and while there passed the ordinance for the emancipation ol the
Hottentots. In 1831 he was appointed Governor of New South M ales, and arrived
in Sydney on December 2nd of that year. He was a gentleman ol good ability, and
had acquired experience sufficient for the proper exercise ol such authority as
was now vested in him by a long course of training. His liberality in religion, and his
desire to place all religious sects upon an equal footing by a distribution amongst them
of whatever State aid was forthcoming in proportion to their numbers, gained lor him an


affectionate regard, which lias not yet been forgotten. He intensely abhorred anything
approaching meanness, and by refusing to have any connexion with local squabbles or
petty jealousies, he succeeded in securing the general respect of the colonists. When
he arrived in Sydney, the colony was in a very low state, occasioned by drought
and financial complications, as well as favouritism to one class of colonists. During
his government, he showed every desire to advance the welfare of the colony, which
rapidly recovered its former position, and enjoyed remarkably prosperous times. All
these circumstances justified the demonstration of satisfaction with which the
colonists welcomed his arrival among them, and his retirement from office in 1887
was universally regretted. It is singular, however, that his death, which occurred at
his native place in Ireland, in 1855, created so little interest in Victoria that not one
of the newspapers referred to it.
In the far west, on the shores of Portland Bay, and upon the site of the earliest
colonisation of Victoria, was laid out the township of Portland.
The Governor’s visit had the effect of increasing the fame of Port Phillip
on the Sydney merchants and speculators, who were pondering over the land
allotments soon to be placed in the market. The first sale of Melbourne
allotments took place in Melbourne, on June 1, 1837, and was conducted by
Robert Hoddle, Esq., who had been appointed Crown Lands Commissioner,
acting as auctioneer. The prices were very low, considering the reputation
the settlement had already acquired. This was, in a great measure, due to one of
the regulations of the sale, which operated favourably for the Sydney purchasers —all
purchases to be paid for in gold. At this time there was no money in the settlement,
and all transactions were consequently carried on by a system of orders upon
Sydney, Launceston, and Hobart Town houses. The prices of the first sale averaged
about T35 per acre per lot, and those of the second sale, which was held on November
1 of the same year, about T42, but within a few years some of these lots realised
several thousand pounds. A purchaser at one of these sales is reported to have
forfeited his deposit money for half-an-acre of grass sward in one of the principal
thoroughfares of the present city (Collins-street west), which afterwards was worth
thousands of pounds. A great number of the lots fell to the Sydney purchasers, and
a good many fortunes date from this opening of the Port Phillip land sales. The
Port Phillip settlement grew so rapidly into importance, and its distance from the
seat of government was so great, that it was necessary to make some provision for
local administration. Accordingly Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe was appointed under
the new title of Superintendent, and arrived at Melbourne in the “ Pyramus,” on
October 1, 1889.
He was the son of a Moravian missionary, and brother of an English clergyman.
He had, therefore, all the advantages of a judicious training, and was a gentleman of
taste and culture. For a time he was travelling tutor to a foreign Count, and in that
capacity had ample opportunities for observing persons and places. He was also an
author ol some merit. Having gained the confidence of the Home authorities while
in the discharge of his duties in a Government office in the West Indies, he was


nominated Superintendent of Port Phillip, under the Governor of New South Wales.
As a public man he cannot be regarded as a success, thus belying the effusive display
which heralded his advent to the settlement; but it must be remembered that he had
to deal with a state of things, especially in 1852, to which we of the present day are
fortunately strangers. His public policy was regarded as devoid of what is now-a-days
called “spirited,” and he was not resolute of purpose. He gave unpardonable offence
by opposing the wishes of the people for increased political privileges and
self-government. His appointment did not give him the position of an independent
administrator, as Port Phillip was still a district of New South Wales, and it was a
dependency of a dependency. Mr. La Trobe could, therefore, disavow any
responsibility, when anything was done amiss, as he was only the nominee of the
Governor and Executive Council of New South Wales.
On the other hand, it is argued that this disclaimer of all responsibility was a
mere subterfuge, as his opponents prove by the words of Sir George Gipps, who says:
—“He had great experience of the difficulty of governing Port Phillip at a distance of six
hundred miles, and it would be a subject of great congratulation to him to get rid of it.
He was glad when Mr. La Trobe arrived, and since then the administration of the affairs
of Port Phillip might be truly said to be the administration of Mr. La Trobe; he (the
Governor) had acceded to all his wishes as far as he could, and on no occasion had he
found it necessary to interfere with or censure any of his proceedings.” This assurance
was given by Sir George Gipps in the Legislative Council. It is further alleged
that during the extended period he administered the government as superintendent,
frequent opportunities were afforded him of showing his interest in the progress and
prosperity of the district, but that instead of assisting the colonists in the objects for
which they were striving, he maintained a neutral and disinterested attitude. Although
much abuse is heaped upon him for the imaginary or real delinquencies of which he
was deemed guilty, yet he was always accessible, and generally courteous. On the
whole, his feelings leaned more to the interests of New South Wales than to those
of the Port Phillip District, and although he made a feeble attempt to oppose the
squatters in their efforts to confiscate the lands and shut up the country, he was more
or less their friend. It is gratifying, however, to record that on his departure from
Victoria, after an unusually long administration of fifteen years, his numerous
colonial friends presented him with a handsome and substantial testimonial,
manufactured from that metal which has been one of the principal sources of A ictorian
prosperity. He was a man well known in religious circles, was a large contributor
to all pious and charitable objects, and, save in his political career, led an
unblemished and exemplary life. The jurisdiction of his government extended over
an area not more than half that of the present colony, and lay to the southward of the
36th degree of south latitude, and between the 141 st and 146 th degrees of longitude;
thus excluding Gippsland, which had not then been discovered, most of the Murray
District, and the northern and larger half of the Wimmera District. This tract of
country may be called the “Port Phillip Settlement,” as distinguished from the Port
Phillip District, or Southern district of New South AVales.


Closely connected with the history of Melbourne is the river Yarra Yarra. It
is one of the secondary streams of the colony, having the detect common to all
Australian rivers—a barred entrance —and being at the same time one ot the \ei}
few permanently running streams in the country. This name was given to it b} Mr.
Wedge from the fact that the native boy who accompanied him called out ‘ lana
Yarra ” —its native name is Bay-ray-rung —which is popularly held to be the
aboriginal equivalent for “ ever-flowing.” He, however, afterwards discovered that
the same word was used by the natives to designate a waterfall, ihe first discovery
or intelligence of this river was received from David Gibson, the returned runaway ot
Collins’s convict party, Mr. Westgarth says that, “In the lower course, the Yarra is
generally a deep canal-looking body of water, with a dark, silent, sluggish stream.
The scenery in parts is very charming. Mr. Hoddle, the Government Surveyor,
completely explored it in 1845, and in so doing experienced considerable fatigue and
difficulty in forcing his way through the dense vegetation, but, nevertheless, reached
its source, which lies in a direction E.N.E. of Melbourne, and at a distance ot about
ninety miles therefrom. Mr. Fawkner, as already mentioned, gave instructions to
his party, when they started for Port Phillip, to only settle where there was a supply
of fresh water. When, therefore, they reached the falls of the Yarra, the required
conditions were fulfilled, inasmuch as a plentiful supply could be obtained. Below
the falls the water was brackish, above them the water was fresh, and without any
consideration for what supply might be needed in the future, they immediately
selected a site for their settlement. After a few years the river was objected to as
comparatively unwholesome in quality, and Melbourne has since been supplied with
the pure water of the Yan Yean. This reservoir is situated about twenty miles from
Melbourne in a north-easterly direction. It occupies an area of 1300 acres, or rather
more than two square miles, and contains 0,400,000,000 gallons of water, the depth
of which varies from 18 to 25 feet. At the time it was considered the largest
artificial reservoir in the world. It was constructed by connecting two bluffs or
headlands together with an earthen embankment, 1,053 yards in length, and 30 feet
in height. A watercourse, about two miles long, connects the Aan Yean with the river
Plenty, and a few years ago the Morang and Preston reservoirs were added.
Notwithstanding this vast quantity of water, no later than the summer ot 1887, it
was found, on two or three occasions, inadequate to meet the demands made upon
it. The Yan Yean stands 600 feet above the level of the city, and, consequently, the
pressure of water is very great. It was opened on the 31st December, 1857, precisely
at one o’clock, by Major-General Macarthur, owing to the indisposition of Sir Henry
Barkly, who was to have let off the first jet d’eau. At the banquet which was Held to
celebrate the event, Mr. Justice Barry, in responding to the toast of the health ot the
Chancellor and of the University of Melbourne, said that “the same year that had given
birth to the Yan Yean waterworks, and which had that day become an accomplished fact,
signalised the inauguration of the University of Melbourne. ’ A bottleful ot the water
was forwarded, by request, to Mr. La Trobe, the late Governor, with the following
inscription :—“ Yan Yean Reservoir, commenced 26th November, 1853, by


G. J. La Trobe, Esq., breaking ground, and o])ened at Carlton Gardens, by
Major-General Edward Macartlmr, Commander of H.M. Forces, on 81st December,
1857. Steele and Martindale, contractors.”
To return to the history of the progress of the Settlement, during the period
of the intervening dates at the head of this chapter. On the 30th December, 1837,
a fortnightly mail was established between Sydney and Melbourne. Mr. Joseph
Hawdon contracted to convey it between Melbourne and Yass. It was carried on
horseback by his stockman, John Bourke, acting as mailman. This courageous
fellow, notwithstanding the attack on Mr. Faithful’s party in the course of the
following year, and the hostility of the blacks, continued to carry the mail by himself
through the uninhabited country, at the imminent risk of his life, crossing his horses
over the rivers in the best possible manner, and camping out at night whenever he
found it most convenient. On one occasion lie had a horse drowned in the
Murray River, and on another was surrounded by hostile blacks, from
whom lie contrived, by some means or other, to escape. On the same
date as the establishment of this mail service, a most daring murder and robbery took
place by a bushranger named Cummerford, who confessed at Sydney that he and two
other men had murdered, between Melbourne and Portland Bay, six bushrangers,
whilst asleep. Governor Sir Richard Bourke desiring to have the place pointed
out where the murder was committed, sent Cummerford for that purpose.
Upon Cummerford’s arrival in Melbourne, he was sent to execute his' mission
in charge of a sergeant, one soldier, and two constables. When the spot indicated was
reached, some 200 miles from Melbourne, the police found nearly two bushels of
calcined human bones, some human teeth and hair unburnt, and some shoe nails, and
buttons from the clothes of the murdered men. The bones of a horse’s head were also
found, which Cummerford stated to be the property of Mr. Ebden, and that he and
Dignum had shot it. One constable and the soldier turned back for some tea they
had left behind, while the sergeant, the remaining constable—Tompkins—and
Cummerford continued their journey. Having stopped to cook, the sergeant gave
his musket to Tompkins whilst he made a fire. Tompkins having left the firearms,
Cummerford seized a musket and shot him, from the effects of which he died after
lingering for three hours. The bushranger then plundered the packhorse and
escaped. Two days afterwards, while trying to steal a horse, he was arrested and
taken into custody by three of Mr. Wedge’s men. In the month of April, 1838,
another dreadful catastrophe happened to a party of men in charge of Mr. William
P. Faithful’s sheep, travelling from New South Wales, and as they were preparing
to proceed from the Broken River to the Goulburn River in the Port Phillip District,
where it was reported that it was possible to obtain good sheep stations. Whilst
the bullocks were being yoked, the men with the drays heard the shepherds calling
for help; these latter, who were a short distance from the encampment, herding the
sheep, were seen running towards the drays, pursued by a body of blacks, who were
hurling spears at them. Their companions at the encampment, three of them being
armed with guns, rushed to their assistance, hoping by this display to drive off the


blacks, who were then within three or four hundred yards ot the encampment. One
of these men, named Bentley, fired his gun into the air, thinking by this means to
terrify the blacks, who disregarded it, and, still pushing forward, sheltered themselves
in their advance behind the trees. Bentley shot one of them dead, while in the
act of deliberately poising his spear, but was immediately afterwards pierced with
three spears. The contest then became general, and Bentley was last seen, although
wounded, fighting desperately with the butt end of his musket. Owing to the blacks
availing themselves of the shelter of the trees, shots fired at them were harmless.
The blacks increased in numbers, and there now appeared every probability of a
complete massacre of the whites, as seven of the party of fifteen were killed, and one
mortally wounded. As a last resort, the survivors joined in a final rush for escape,
the blacks opening in two lines and spearing the whites as they fled between them.
Mr. Crossley, the overseer of the estate, and subsequently a butcher at Kilmore, was
one of those who escaped. The attacking party appeared to have numbered one
hundred and fifty fighting men. The whites in charge of the sheep and cattle had
been awaiting the arrival of Mr. George Faithful, who was only a day s stage behind,
and was momentarily expected. The sheep were dispersed, but with the
exception of 130 were all recovered, and some of the cattle were lost.
Mr. George Faithful and Colonel White were camped near the crossing place
of the Ovens River, where one of the men who had escaped from the affray arrived
some 28 hours after, reporting that he believed he was the sole survivor of
the party. In September of this year Mr. David Kelsh was appointed, by the
Governor, Postmaster of Melbourne. He opened a post-office in a small brick building
on the north side of Little Collins Street, a little to the westward of Temple Court.
On November 2nd, a general fast was kept in Port Phillip, on account of the long
continued drought. On June 17th, 1839, the barque “Midlothian,” George
Morrison, master, arrived from Leith. This was the first merchant vessel direct from
a British port to Hobson’s Bay. In August of this year, Mr. Edward Curr, afterwards
known as the “Father of Separation,” arrived from Circular Head, Van Diemen’s
Land, in the schooner “Eagle,” bringing with him for sale cattle from some of the
best herds in England. A public meeting of colonists on the all-absorbing question
of separation was held in Melbourne on December 30th, 1840. The chair was taken
by William Yerner, Esq., the first Commissioner of Insolvent Estates. The attendance
of the leading merchants of Melbourne, and the lawyers, physicians, stock and land
owners of the district, conclusively demonstrated the unanimity existing among the
colonists, and the unmistakable declaration of public opinion on the important question
of the independence of Port Phillip. A petition to Her Majesty, praying that a
separate Government be given to Port Phillip, and that the boundaries as appointed
by an Order-in-Council of May 23rd be allowed to exist, was adopted and numerously
signed. The colonists of Port Phillip at this time were imbued with a great deal of
public spirit, and made a vigorous effort to counteract the influence which had been
brought to bear on the Colonial Office by interested parties in Sydney, who had
already shewn their unwillingness to allow the fine lands of Port Phillip to slip out

of their hands. The Governor was somewhat influenced by this motive, and could
not altogether act according to his own judgment. At this time Sir George Gipps,
the successor of Sir Richard Bourke, anxious to gain the favour of the Council
of Sydney, and with their expressed wishes, discountenanced the movement.
The New South Wales Legislature (composed at the time of nominees of
the Crown) would not hear eveji of the territorial dismemberment of the colony.
Ecclesiasticism, also, in the person of the Bishop of Australia (Dr. Broughton),
thundered forth its denunciation of an attempt to alienate the revenues of Port
Phillip, which replenished the Sydney coffers, the land sales in six years, from 1837
to 1842, having enriched the Sydney Treasury by nearly half-a-million sterling.
The following return of revenue and expenditure from 1836 to 1842, will
illustrate the financial position of Port Phillip, with reference, more particularly, to
her standing account with the Treasury of New South Wales :
Revenue.
In this period the actual expenditure for the Government of the province of
Port Phillip, exclusive of immigration, was as follows :
Expendituee,
On March Ist, 1841, another meeting was held, and a memorandum was
unanimously adopted for distribution among members of Parliament. John Richardson,
Esq., M.P., who was entrusted with the petition for separation, did all in his power to
further the movement, but Lord John Russell and other prominent persons treated
the desires of the Port Phillippians in an indifferent manner. It was quite manifest,
therefore, that their cherished idea would not be realised without a long and
bitter struggle.
In the early part of 1841, the first resident judge in the Port Phillip District,
Mr. John Walpole Willis, one of the puisne judges of the Supreme Court of New
South Wales, was appointed. He was accounted an accomplished and most able
lawyer, but of a very eccentric character. Dr. Willis, his father, was the rector of
Wapping, England, and had the honor of attending George 111. in his illness. When
Judge Willis opened the Supreme Court in Port Phillip, he announced that it was
imperative for the justices of the peace to attend all future sittings of the Supreme
Court in its criminal jurisdiction. The magistrates paid no attention to the learned
judge’s announcement, whereupon he declared that it was within his power to inflict
a fine for non-attendance, and that if they were determined to disobey him, he would
have their names struck off the list of justices of the peace, and cause others to be
appointed in their stead. It is needless to say that this method of teaching the
magistrates their duties raised a strong feeling of animosity on their part towards
him, which did not subside until he was removed from the bench. Hie wiiter
has had the privilege of examining the signatures, numbering over 1300, of those


who subscribed to present Mr. Willis with a testimonial. They were collected
on a Sunday, and the documents are at the present time in the hands of
Mr. Budd, of Wallan, who has been in Victoria for fifty years. After the
Supreme Court was opened in Melbourne, Mr. Justice Willis was chiefly
occupied in hearing trials connected with the various collisions which were alleged to
have occurred between the whites and and the aborigines. One of these cases which
was heard in December, 1841, attracted the greatest attention, owing to the standing
of the accused, Sandford George Bolden, Esq., who was indicted for feloniously
shooting at an aboriginal named Takere with intent to kill him, on the 27th
October of that year. It appears that Takere attacked Mr. Bolden when mustering
his stock and was shot by that gentleman, whom, however, the jury acquitted of the
charge. The aboriginals in all parts of the colony were so aggressive at this period
as to cause the greatest consternation to the white population in Gippsland and the
outlying districts, who, owing to the paucity of their numbers, dreaded a general
attack. In connection with legal matters, as a curious instance of the manner in which
justice was administered may be mentioned the case of a woman against whom her
husband obtained a warrant for a breach of the peace. When she appeared to answer
the charge, the presiding magistrate, without giving her an opportunity of hearing
the charge preferred, or even stating that any had been made against her, immediately
said “ Oh ! here is this woman ; you (addressing her) must find bail to keep the peace
towards your husband, yourself in £SO, and two securities in £25 each.” The
prisoner was unable to find the necessary bail, and was accordingly lodged in the
watch-house. This was in the year 1842. The following particulars of the census of
the Port Phillip District, taken on 2nd March, 1841, will give a tolerably good picture
of the social condition of the people. The population of what is now Melbourne
was then 4,479; of County Bourke, 8,241; of the district of Western Port, 1,391 ;
of Geelong, 454 ; of County Grant, 336; of Portland, 597 ; and of County Normanby,
1,269 ; total, 11,758.
The number of houses in Melbourne was 769; in County Bourke, including
Newtown and Williamstown, 432, besides 67 huts; in the district of Western Port,
110 ;in Geelong, 81; and in the County and district of Portland, 100; total, 1559.
Portland Bay was at this time in a flourishing condition, and labour was in much
demand both in town and country. At the Government land sale which had been
recently held, the lowest price of half an acre of town land was T2OO per chain.
The condition of Port Phillip from a social point of view was as follows:—The
number of convicts employed by Government in Melbourne was 64; in County
Bourke, 34; in the district of Western Port, 5 ; in Geelong, 20; in County Grant,
17 ; in the district and County of Portland Bay, 6 ; total, 146. Those who were in
private assignment numbered 231, and were distributed as follows: —Melbourne, 10;
County of Bourke, 70 ; district of Western Port, 122 ; Geelong, 6 ; County of Grant,
0; County and district of Portland Bay, 23 ; total, 231. The total of convicts in
the district, exclusive of two women, holding tickets of leave, therefore numbered
377. Of the male free population there were 215 colonial born, 7960 free arrivals, 104
emancipists, and 124 holding tickets of leave. Of the female free population there were


811 born in the colony, 2908 arrived free, 104 emancipists (a number which must be
certainly erroneous), and two holding tickets of leave. The religion of this population
was as follows:—The Church of England claimed 7960; the Church of Scotland,
294; the Wesleyan Methodists, 651; other Protestant dissenters, 353 ; the Pioman
Catholics, 2431; the Jews, 59 ; and the Mohammedans and Pagans, 10. The station
in life of the population may be estimated as nearly as possible by representing the
employers, including professions and trades, as numbering 1767, and labourers of
every description as amounting to 8926; total, 10,693.
As an evidence of the growth of the settlement, the testimony of James
Backhouse, a Quaker missionary who visited Port Phillip in 1837, may be adduced:—
“ November 13th.—The Yarra Yarra is deep, but it is difficult to navigate for boats,
on account of the quantity of sunken timber ; it is about sixty feet wide, margined
with trees and scrub. The town of Melbourne, though scarcely more than fifteen
months old, consists of about 100 houses, amongst which are stores, inns, a jail, a
barrack, and a school-house. Some of the dwelling houses are tolerable structures
of brick. A few of the inhabitants are living in tents or in hovels till they can
provide themselves with better accommodation.” In 1842, the weatherboarded
hovels, which at first answered all purposes as the Melbourne Temples of Fashion,
began rapidly to disappear, and numerous handsome shops, notwithstanding the
depression then existing, were in course of erection in part of the town.
On January 2, 1841, a steamer named the “ Clonmel,” while on her voyage
from Sydney to Melbourne, was wrecked in the Shallow Inlet, near Corner Inlet. She
went ashore during a spring tide, and became embedded in the sand. This accident
had an important influence in opening up for settlement that fertile portion of the
colony now known as Gippsland. Captain Lewis, the Port Phillip Harbour Master,
on his expedition to the rescue of the shipwrecked crew and passengers, discovered
the large lake with a navigable passage from Corner Inlet—an honour which Captain
Mulhall, of the “Sisters,” also claims. A project was immediately set on foot for
getting up an expedition to Corner Inlet, with the view of ascertaining the practicability
of communication with Gippsland from the ocean. A company was formed, under
the designation of the Gippsland Company, and a vessel named the “ Singapore ”
was chartered. The passage to Corner Inlet in the “ Singapore ” proved a very
tedious one, a succession of calms and contrary winds preventing the vessel making
a quick voyage. On the 13th of February she entered the harbour, the lofty summits
of Wilson’s Promontory being observable on the left, which, though barren in the
extreme, present a striking feature in the outline. They failed in the first instance
to effect a landing in Gippsland on the north-west side of Corner Inlet, but after
considerable trouble and delay, succeeded in a different quarter. Tracing up the
communicating channel with Corner Inlet, the party discovered the entrance to two
large navigable rivers, the country on the banks of the rivers being described by them
as surpassingly rich. Horses, cattle, and stores being safely put ashore, operations
were immediately commenced for the erection in the locality of a store, huts, and
other buildings. This was the beginning of the fine district of Gippsland, now so
well known for its productive resources and prosperous settlers.


CHAPTER VIII.
THE PORT PHILLIP DISTRICT, OR
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
184=3—1851.
provisions in the Imperial Act for the Australian Colonies, passed in
the year 1842, were of great importance to the Port Phillip Settlement,
which, thenceforth until 1851, was styled the Southern District of New
South Wales. By this Act the boundaries of the Port Phillip District were assigned.
New South Wales was formed into three great divisions, namely, the Southern, or
Port Phillip District; the Middle, or Sydney District; and the Northern, or Moreton
Bay District. The boundaries which were on this occasion appointed are those of
what is now Victoria, and with which the Port Phillip colonists were entirely
dissatisfied. In a despatch dated May Ist, 1840, the Imperial Government settled
the division between the Middle and Southern Districts, and assigned to Port Phillip
the large country known as the Tumut and Murrumbidgee District, the Billibong
Creek being supposed to be the proper dividing line. The Bishop of Australia moved
an address to the Crown against this boundary, with the result that the Act of 1842
appointed the boundaries as they now exist. An attempt was made by the Port
Phillip members, assisted by Dr. Lang, to have some equitable arrangement made, but
this was opposed, and accordingly Victoria has been deprived of what is known as the
Riverina. This Act conferred upon the colony representative institutions, legislative
and municipal. The Council of Crown nominees that had existed at Sydney
previously was to be reduced by two-thirds, and superseded by a Legislative Assembly,
consisting of elective members to that amount, the remaining one-third being still
a nominee element. The franchise, legislative and municipal, was fixed at a <£2o
rental, and the Port Phillip District was to be represented by six out of the thirty-six
elective members to assemble at Sydney. The Act came into operation in the
following year, when the general election for the Legislative Council upon the
popular basis took place in June. The Mayor of Melbourne, Henry Condell, Esq.,
was returned for the town, and Messrs. Charles Hobson, Thomas Walker, Charles
Nicholson, Alexander Thomson, and the Rev. John Dunmore Lang, were returned


lor the Port Phillip District. Sir Thomas Mitchell, the discoverer of Australia
Felix, although having a considerable claim upon the people, was not returned; hut
this was partly owing to him not making any effort, and also that, being the
Surveyor-General at the time, he might have supported the Sydney Government,
which had become very unpopular. Very little political interest was manifested in
the elections by the Port Phillippians, as the province was bent on separating
entirely from New South Wales legislation and obtaining a Government of their own.
They had already let their voices be heard on the matter, as previously stated, of
“ Separation.” They, however, regarded municipal institutions more earnestly, as
in them they had local government of its own kind. There was considerable
religious excitement aroused in Melbourne through the rejection of Mr. Edward Curr,
a Roman Catholic, who opposed Mr. Condell. This gentleman might have been
elected, as he had considerable experience, and deserved the gratitude of the people
of Melbourne on account of his strong advocacy of separating from the parent colony;
but his unguarded remarks, which caused no small stir, lost him the election. The
mob became so frantic when his defeat was announced, that it was necessary to read
the “ Riot Act,” and a violent effort was made by the troopers to disperse an
assemblage which occupied the space of ground in front of the hustings, close to the
Mechanics’ Institution, where the Town Hall now stands.
After nightfall, numbers of those who supported Mr. Curr paraded the streets,
and were not dispersed until a detachment of the 80th Regiment appeared on the
scene. This was the beginning of that religious feud which has ever since been
experienced in the country. The colony received the benefit of municipal
representation at this time. On December 1, 1842, the Geelong and Melbourne
Corporations were inaugurated. Melbourne had been divided into four wards, and
the citizens were now called on to elect councillors. The following were the first
Mayor and Aldermen :—Mayor, Henry Condell, Esq.; aldermen for six years, Henry
Condell and Andrew Russell, Esqs.; aldermen for three years, H. W. Mortimer and
William Kerr, Esqs. On the 9th of the same month the new Town Council met,
and on the following day, which was named Lord Mayor’s Day, they walked in
procession from their chamber in Collins-street to the temporary Court House.
After an address by the President Judge, Mr. John Walpole Willis, they next
proceeded to wait upon the Superintendent at the Government office, then in Mr.
Batman’s house on Batman’s Hill. The first popular legislature for New South
Wales met at Sydney in August, 1843, and elected Mr. Macleay as Speaker, then in
his 77th year. No business of importance to Port Phillip was brought before the
Council in 1843, but early in the session of the following year Dr. Lang moved—
“ That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that she will be
graciously pleased to direct that the requisite steps may be taken for the speedy and
entire separation of the district of Port Phillip from the territory of New South
Wales, and its erection into a separate and independent colony.” This motion was
seconded by Joseph Phelps Robertson, who had, on the resignation of Mr. Condell,
been elected member for Melbourne, and supported by all the Port Phillip members.


The motion was lost by 19 to 6; all the members, with the exception of Robert Lowe,
Esq., then a Government nomineee, and those who represented Port Phillip, voting
against it. Robert Lowe, Esq. (now Lord Sherbrook), distinguished himself in the
Legislative Council of New South Wales as the opponent of the squatting system.
The Port Phillip colonists saw by the result that nothing was to be obtained from the
Sydney Legislature. Dr. Lang’s measure, although rejected, had some effect on the
Home authorities, for it not only was officially acknowledged, but brought about an
official enquiry at the Imperial instance. This step inspired fresh hope in the breasts
of the separatists. Dr. Lang was congratulated on his success, and was subsequently
entertained at a great separation banquet laid out in the Queen’s Theatre. He was a
colonist of old standing, ability and public usefulness, and was well-known in the
political and religious worlds of Australia, but somewhat minimised his influence by
anti-Papist leanings. Four years had passed since Dr. Lang’s step, but separation
seemed to be as far off as ever. However, the Melbourne electors were not going to be
worsted in the contest, so they proposed, on the first opportunity, as a member of
the Legislature, the Right Honourable Earl Grey, Her Majesty’s Secretary for the
colonies. His Lordship was duly elected, and on being jocularly questioned upon it
in the House of Lords, replied in a similar vein. The Superintendent and the
Governor were shocked at such liberties being taken with the Home authorities, and
they both attempted to show, in their despatches on the subject to the Imperial
Government, how unfit were people, capable of such conduct, for self-government.
This electioneering scheme may have been instrumental in producing the
desired effect, for separation came shortly afterwards. In the year 1849, the
colonists learned that their wishes were about to be complied with. It was not,
however, until August, 1850, that the Bill for conferring representative Government
on the Australian colonies, and separating Port Phillip from New South Wales, was
passed by the Imperial Parliament. The intelligence of Port Phillip’s freedom
reached the colony by the “Lysander,” from Adelaide, which arrived in Hobson’s Bay
on November 11. The New South Wales Legislature was summoned for the year
1851 by the Sydney authorities, and when the Electoral Acts and other necessary
arrangements had been passed, the old Legislative Council of the united colony was
dissolved, and thenceforward the Southern District ceased its connection with the
Middle District. The Port Phillip members and the Superintendent returned in the
steamer “ Shamrock” from Sydney during these important proceedings—the former to
find themselves henceforth members of an independent colony, and the latter in the
capacity of the first Lieutenant-Governor of the new territory. This gratifying state
of affairs was completed in the acceptable intimation that the Queen had expressly
wished the colony to be honoured by receiving her own name of Victoria. The
swearing in of the Governor and various other duties connected with the inauguration
took place on July 1, 1851. There was a general procession in honour of the day,
which is still a general holiday for Victoria, and which must recall to the minds of
many old colonists the struggles they endured to obtain their freedom. Everything
now looked cheering; the prospects of material welfare were a source of general


satisfaction; the colony compared favourably, considering its age and the
disadvantages under which it had hitherto laboured, with the other colonies of the
empire. The census, taken on March 2nd of this eventful year, gave a population of
77,345 colonists, and of 10,935 houses, Melbourne possessing over 23,000 of the
former; while the import and export commerce, collectively, for the preceding year
(1850) amounted to nearly two millions sterling. Before proceeding to consider the
history of the Port Phillip district, as the colony of Victoria, up to the time of self
government, some events occurred during the intervening dates of this chapter which
cannot be, with advantage, lost sight of. One of these is the flooding of the Yarra
River in October, 1844, to a greater height than had ever been known, even by the
aborigines. On the Ist of that month the waters rose very suddenly, and on the
night of the 2nd the flats around the city were inundated. A panic seized the
residents in the swamps on both sides of the river when they were cut off from
communication with the city and surrounding country. There was great destruction
among the settlers’ residences, which were swept away like corks by the rush of
water. The lower portions of Melbourne, adjoining the Yarra, were submerged, and
all communication had to be carried on by boats. Several persons were missing,
who were supposed to have been lost through this catastrophe. The Ovens and
many other rivers overflowed their banks, and several lives were lost.
The attempt of the Imperial Government to send prisoners to Port Phillip
about this time was frustrated by the colonists, who strongly protested against
such a class of visitors. The design was consequently abandoned, and the Home
authorities ordered the vessels to be sent to Van Diemen’s Land. On the fourth day
of August, 1845, a most disastrous shipwreck occurred to the only emigrant ship,
the “ Cataraqui,” despatched from Great Britain that season, and the whole of the
emigrants and the crew, amounting to 425, were lost, with the exception of nine, the
survivors consisting of one mate, six able seamen, one apprentice and one emigrant.
The ship struck on the rocks when steering for Cape Otway during a heavy mist of
rain at 4.30 a.m. on August 4. When day broke, after cutting away the masts, two
hundred people were yet alive. All that could not be brought from below were
drowned. The men that were saved had eaten nothing from the evening of August
3 until noon of the sth, were without fire or water, and were nearly naked. Mr. David
Howie came to their rescue, and together with Oakley (Howie’s associate) and a black,
relieved their wants, made them a fire, a hut, and gave each of them provisions. Mr.
Howie and his people supported the shipwrecked sufferers until September 7, when
the “ Midge ” hove in sight, and they were all, at great risk, brought off to her in
Mr. Howie’s boat. Of the 416 that were lost, 342 bodies were recovered, and buried
in five large and several small graves, by Mr. Howie, under a contract with the
Government, for TSO.
An interesting souvenir of this wreck is in the possession of the Hon. G. S.
Coppin, which the writer has had the privilege of inspecting —a sketch of the
“ Cataraqui,” and locality of the wreck, drawn by the apprentice. So disastrous a
wreck has seldom occurred, and as the emigrants were urgently required in the


district, the loss was incalculable, and the colonists were overpowered with the event.
On March 20, 1846, the bridge across the Yarra and the hospital were commenced.
The foundation-stone of Prince s Bridge was laid by the superintendent, Mr. La Trobe,
under the direction of the Freemasons, a suitable oration having been delivered by E.
J. Brewster, M.C., on behalf of the Craft. After the conclusion of this ceremony, the
foundation-stone of the hospital was laid by the Mayor, Dr. Palmer. A census, the
fifth since the first settlers arrived, taken on March 2, gave the population as 32,879.
On June 29, 1847, the Eight Kev. Charles Perry was consecrated as the first
Bishop for the Diocese of Melbourne; he arrived in the “Stag” on January 23, 1848,
and was installed on the 28th of the same month, in the cathedral church of St. James,
Melbourne. On whatever grounds Melbourne could hitherto have aspired to the title
of city, she could now, by falling in with an old English custom, have asserted her right
to be so distinguished. The custom referred to is that any town, no matter how
insignificant, which has been marked out as the selected see of a bishop of the
Anglican Church, gains the title of city. The first bishop of the Anglican Church in
Australia had been sent to Sydney, and bore the title of Bishop of Australia; but when
Melbourne received her bishop, Dr. Broughton had to assume the territorial title of
Bishop of Sydney. Sydney was the seat of supreme colonial authority, and, therefore,
both secularly and by episcopal right, was already a city. Melbourne, however, was
now the capital of a territory over which she was shortly to have the authority to
legislate, and, consequently, from the two stand-points alluded to, could claim a
similarly dignified distinction. Melbourne is now the Metropolitan city of the Southern
Hemisphere, both in point of population and of commerce. On August 8, 1849,
the captain of the ship “ Eandolph,” with convicts on board, received instructions, as
she was entering Port Phillip Heads, not to attempt to go any farther, but at once
proceed to Sydney. This he refused to do, on the plea that he was chartered for
Hobson’s Bay, and he was only insured to that port, and that there he asserted he
was determined to go. This caused so much excitement among the people that they
threatened to oppose by physical force the landing of the convicts on the shores of
Port Phillip. The Superintendent, foreseeing that a conflict would ensue should an
attempt to land be made, and in accordance with the promise given by the
Governor, ordered the “ Eandolph ” to proceed to Sydney. This incident caused
several public meetings to be held, at which resolutions strongly condemnatory of
designs to make Port Phillip a penal colony were passed. In August, 1850, the
question of transportation was once more brought before the Legislative Council
of New South Wales by Mr. Lamb, who moved resolutions to the effect that no more
convicts ought, under any circumstances, to be sent to the colony. An amendment
which was moved, that the debate stand adjourned for a month, was carried through
the Speaker giving his casting vote. In September a public meeting was held in
front of the police office, Melbourne, and resolutions were passed approving of Mr.
Lamb’s motion. At Sydney a public meeting was also held, and resolutions were
carried against transportation in toto. Mr. Lamb’s motion, when the adjourned
debate was resumed, was carried without a division, only two members, Messrs.
Wentworth and Martin, being in favour of transportation.


The Home authorities had no alternative but to try Van Diemen’s Land, and
there the colonists felt equally as determined as New South Wales and Port
Phillip to put an end to transportation to their shores. The cause of the Tasmanians
was warmly taken up by the neighbouring colonies, and in 1851 it was resolved that
all the Australian colonies should form an anti-transportation league. In Melbourne,
thirty-five of the leading colonists put down their names for subscriptions of one
hundred guineas each to the funds of the league. Subsequently the people of New
South Wales dissolved the Anti-transportation Association, and joined the Australian
League. This league had been formed none too soon, as we shall see in a secondary
chapter, where we come to the discovery of gold.
In March, 1849, Sir Charles Fitzroy, the Governor of New South Wales,
arrived at Port Phillip, in H.M.S. “ Havannah.” He was enthusiastically received, the
citizens turning out to meet him on his landing at Sandridge. Sir Charles remained
two days, during which time he received deputations from all the public bodies of Port
Phillip, and held levees in Melbourne and Geelong. His Excellency’s warm reception
was greatly owing to the promise he made to the colonists that no convicts should
be allowed to land contrary to their wishes. This promise gave great umbrage to
the people of Sydney; but Sir Charles doubtless saw that it would be dangerous
to attempt the landing of convicts, as it might be followed by bloodshed.
On Friday, November 15, 1850, Prince’s Bridge in Melbourne was opened by
Governor La Trobe. The weather was delightful, and the whole of the inhabitants
turned out to view the ceremony. The different bodies, which had taken an
active part in making the procession as imposing as possible, assembled in front
of the Public Offices. The Oddfellows, the Masons, the St. Patrick’s and Rechabite
Societies, each of them with their distinct emblems, banners, and regalia, walked
in the procession, which moved slowly down William-street, Collins-street, and
Swanston-street to the bridge. For four days the city was given up to all descriptions of
amusements, and it is said that even the newspapers ceased publication for nearly
a week. While still upon Melbourne and Melbourne topics, mention must be made
of its Corporation. In 1848 this body entered upon its duties, which were of no
trifling nature, considering that for seven years the streets of the city had received
no attention, except in a few instances by a small expenditure on the part of the
Sydney Government.
In 1841 the condition of Elizabeth-street was most wretched, as there was
an enormous ravine in it, forming, in wet weather, the bed of what was known as
the River Williams ; when it rained heavily this river coursed through the town, and
owing to the absence of drains, tore up for itself a bed of a considerable width and
depth ; this stream careered along the entire length of Elizabeth-street to the Parra.
Swine of all descriptions, shapes, and sizes were allowed to stray about the streets,
not only becoming a public nuisance, but also proving a source of great danger on
one occasion a child having been badly injured by a member of the porcine family.
Stumps of huge gum trees in the thoroughfares contributed to this inartistic coup
d’ceil , and were the cause of many accidents, both by day and night. The nearest


approach to a description of Melbourne streets at that time can be conveyed by
thinking of one of the worst crab-holey roads in the wettest of winters. The
Corporation, however, went to work, and fixed a rating from Gd. to Is. per pound on
the yearly value of town property. The amount thus raised, together with market
and other customary dues, enabled them, until the influx of population through the
discovery of gold, to meet all demands; then, with the increase of population and
business, these means were inadequate. The traffic of the streets increased rapidly,
the town was spreading out in every direction, and additional streets were formed, or
in course of formation. There was, to complete the difficulty, a scarcity of labour,
which, together with the riches of the mines, made money, even could it be obtained,
powerless to cope with the present condition of affairs. It was not until the year
1854, when things were at their worst with the Coloration, that the Government
stepped in to aid them, by negotiating a public loan of ,4500,000 on their behalf, and
at the same time a similar loan of 4200,000 was procured for Geelong. These large
sums were sufficient to enable the respective localities to effect great improvements.
Since that time great sums of money have been spent in order to place the city of
Melbourne in that condition of neatness and finish for which it ranks second to no
metropolis in the British Empire.


GHAPTEE IX.
THE COLONY OE VICTORIA
TO THE TIME OE SELE-GOVERNMENT.
1851-1855.
J«teNOEFORTH we shall call the Port Phillip district Victoria. By the
Mj Imperial Australian Colonies Act the electoral franchise had been reduced
1 from a ,£2O to a £lO rental, thus assimilating it to the Home franchise.
This reduction met the case of the squatting interest, and was the first step towards
the equality of all men as electors in the colonies. The Sydney Legislature, true to
its interests as supporter of the monied class, so arranged the electorates as to give to
Melbourne, which numbered one-third of the population of Victoria, but three out of
the twenty elective members, thus throwing into the thinly-peopled regions, where
the squatting interest predominated, an undue proportion of power. The total
number of members in the Victorian Assembly was thirty, and accordingly the
remaining ten were Crown nominees. The people of Victoria petitioned against the
measure, but with no effect. On the 22nd of April, 1851, when the consideration of
the Bill in committee was proceeding, an amendment of Mr. Ebden’s, to give
Melbourne four instead of three members, was lost by sixteen votes to eight. A
motion to give three members to Bourke, and another, to increase the members of
the Legislative Council to thirty-six, were both lost, and the Bill was passed without
any material alterations. The main basis of representation—population—it will be
seen, was not taken into account. Melbourne had only a member for every 8,000
people; North and South Bourke, with 6,540 and 5,256 respectively, had only
one member each; whereas Belfast and Warrnambool, Portland, Gippsland, and the
Loddon, each of them with a population under 2,000, had one member each. This
arrangement was highly prejudicial in the end to the squatters, who, as Crown
tenants, would do all in their power to protract the settlement of the Land Question,
but who were eventually defeated by a strong popular opposition. It would be a
matter of the highest conjecture to state that squatting interests would not have
suffered as they afterwards did, had there been a more proportionate distribution of
representation. Doubtless it was wiser not to place too much power in the hands of
the inhabitants of a young and growing city, as they probably would, after being so
long fettered with the legislative bonds of the Sydney Government, have abused their


newly-acquired liberties. In politics, as in all other affairs mundane, growth is
gradual. On the Ist of July His Excellency the Governor-General issued the writs
for the first election of members in the Legislative Council of Victoria, and on the
13th of November, 1851, His Excellency opened the session in due form, and
delivered his maiden speech, in which allusion was made to the great alterations
which would be effected by the discovery of gold, and the possible difficulties that
might arise in consequence. The Council promised that Bills on Education and the
judicial arrangements of the colony would be introduced by the Executive
Government. This has been regarded in some quarters as an insult to the good
sense of the people, inasmuch as the Governor had strongly endeavoured to force a
nominee Legislature on the colony.
The following are the names of the members of the Council of the colony :
Crown nominees: official, W. Lonsdale, Colonial Secretary; W. F. Stawell,
Attorney-General', E. Barry, Solicitor-General; C. H. Ebden, Auditor-General; E. W.
Pohlman, Chairman of Court of Bequests; non-official, A. C. W. Dunlop, C. J.
Griffiths, W. C. Haines, J. H. Koss, A. Russell; elected members for Normanhy, J. F.
Palmer; Wiminera, W. F. Splatt; Gippsland , E. Turnbull; Murray, F. Murphy;
Portland, T. Wilkinson; Loddon, W. Campbell; Ripon, A. Goldsmith; Melbourne, Vi.
Westgarth, J. O’Shanassy, and J. S. Johnston; Belfast and Warrnamhool, T. H.
Osborne; North Bourke, C. H. Bight and J. T. Smith; Geelong , E. Robinson and J.
F. Strachan; Kihnore, P. Snodgrass; South Bourke, H. Miller; Villiers, W. Rutledge;
Grant, J. H. Mercer ; Talbot, J. P. Fawkner. Doctor Palmer, afterwards Sir James,
was elected Speaker without opposition; and Doctor Murphy, afterwards Sir Francis,
Chairman of Committees. Sir James Palmer was subsequently President of the
Council, and Sir Francis Murphy Speaker of the Assembly, under self-government.
The colony had now arrived at an event in its history calculated to upset all its
budget arrangements. The gold excitement had seized hold of every person, and as
the young House was debating on the Official Estimates, the news of the arrival of a
ton weight of gold by the Mount Alexander escort reaches its ears. This announcement
led to a general stampede to the fields, and contributed in the largest degree to the
immense influx of population which had taken place, and which in the first instance
came from the adjacent colonies. The working classes had nearly all deserted their
usual employment in order to search for the precious metal. The effect can be easily
guessed. The towns were almost empty, trade was at a stand-still, and the
depreciation of houses and lands through the want of occupants was most marked.
A trying time must this have been for our legislators, when it is borne in mind that
they were young in statesmanship, that they had a number of the most unexpected
circumstances with which to deal, and that they were guiding the destinies of a
colony, figuratively speaking, only born into the world. To their credit, it may be
said, they realised the responsibility of the case, and consequently exercised a great
amount of caution. Tentatively they voted merely the first estimates —the chief
public officers receiving salaries of TOGO a year, while the Colonial Secretary’s and
the Speaker’s salaries were respectively TOGO and T4GG —modest sums, it must be


confessed. The votes were found, however, owing to the constantly rising prices
and rates of wages, to be totally insufficient long before the time had arrived for the
actual distribution of the funds, and it was found necessary to have recourse to large
supplementary votes. The expansion of the public revenues caused all anxiety, from
a financeering point of view, to cease, as it exceeded the anticipations of the most
sanguine. The estimates for 1852 were calculated on the results of 1850—the total
income of that year being T261,000. A slight increase for 1852 was allowed, since
the experience of the past progress of the colony and a belief in its steady
improvement sanctioned the step.
So rapidly had the prosperity of the colony advanced that in the year 1853
the income had jumped from T400,000 —what it was estimated as likely to be—to
T1,577,000. In another chapter will be found an account of the gold discoveries and
events connected therewith, and therefore it is only necessary to mention that within
two months after actual Separation Day the existence of gold-bearing districts in
Victoria became generally known. Glowing accounts of the wealth likely to fall to
the lot of those who would devote themselves to the pursuit of gold-digging soon
reached distant countries, and it is not a matter of surprise that this cheering
information of acquiring wealth by an easy method attracted the representatives of
various nationalities to Victoria. All sorts and conditions of men, too, were to be
met with, from the depraved convict “free by servitude,” or free by “French
leave,” or by “ conditional pardon,” to the respectable and well-educated citizen.
Tasmania and South Australia supplied the fields with a numerous and motley
crowd, and the believers in the tenets of Confucius helped to swell the tide. The
most serious matter of concern was the convict class, which Tasmania gladly
helped off to leave her shores, simply because they were becoming an intolerable
nuisance. Meanwhile, although many found themselves transferred from a state
of comparative poverty to one of wealth, much discomfort and inconvenience
was experienced. The prices of food and clothing, the wages of servants and
the rents of houses had gone up to almost fabulous rates; but on the other hand,
since a large percentage of the colonists could afford to meet this increase,
there was, generally speaking, a feeling of satisfaction experienced throughout the
colony. The transportation system, which had now become a very prominent
question, culminated in evils of a most harrowing description to the colonists, who,
no matter where they went, were in constant fear of attack by bushrangers. We
have previously alluded to the steps taken by the Australian League, which was
organised for the purpose of having an end put to the practice of Great Britain
sending out her criminal class to Australia. The apathy displayed by the mother
country in this matter was so great as at last to rouse the colonists ot Victoria to
vigorous action. With a view to arrest any influx of the desperadoes from Tasmania
and Botany Bay, the Legislature framed and passed the “ Convicts Prevention Act ”
of the year 1852. This measure was mainly due to the late Mr. W. Kerr, one of the
Aldermen, and afterwards the Town Clerk of Melbourne, who first conceived and
made the original draft of it.


After some slight alteration it received official sanction, which would even
then have been withheld had it not been that the criminal class was placing the colony
in a deplorable state. The provisions of the Act were most stringent. No admission
to Victoria was permitted to any person without a perfect free pardon, while persons
from Tasmania, unless they were able to prove themselves free, would be treated as
convicts, and, if not punished on arrival, would be returned to the colony whence
they came. This Act may be cited as the first instance in colonial history where the
circumstances of the colonies are not rightly understood by the Home Government.
The royal prerogative of pardon was deemed by this measure to have been interfered
with, and, until certain alterations were made, the royal sanction was advised to be
withheld. In the following year the Colonial Government made an effort to thrust
on the Victorians a measure with the objectionable parts left out, but the Legislature
succeeded in having the omissions restored. The Governor was unable to act
otherwise than he did, reserving the royal assent; but this did not deter the colonists,
for the law went on for the two years’ term provided in such cases, and has continued
in force ever since.
The Act to apprehend offenders at large had a very salutary effect. Amongst
the number was the notorious bushranger Dalton, who, accompanied by his associate,
Kelly, had crossed over from Bass’ Straits in an open boat, and succeeded in
entering Melbourne unobserved. In company with a boatman, he went into a
restaurant in Bourke-street, and stated to the person in charge that, as he intended
leaving the following morning, he would be obliged if he would change some Van
Diemen’s Land bank notes. The request being declined, the two men were about
to leave the place, when a gentleman present hinted that he could accommodate them,
but on looking at the quantity of cash in his possession, he found he had not
sufficient money for that purpose; he, however, said that he believed a friend of his
would be able to change their notes, and, accordingly, they accompanied the gentleman
up Swanston-street, who marched them into the station-house, whereupon the boatman,
guessing the position of affairs, decamped, his companion Dalton exhibiting a desire
to follow his example. In this attempt he was frustrated by two smart detectives,
who, arriving on the scene, were informed by Mr. Bryce, their chaperon, of his
suspicions as to the manner by which the notes in Dalton’s possession were
obtained. There being no evidence to prove his dishonesty, Dalton was
about to depart, when Murray, recognising in the man before him
the description of Dalton, rushed upon him. A desperate struggle ensued,
but Dalton was eventually overcome, and was brought before the Police
Bench of Melbourne, and, after examination, forwarded to Van Diemen’s Land, to
receive his deserts at the hands of the authorities of that colony. For this brilliant
capture the officers became entitled to £IOO, the amount which the Governor of Van
Diemen’s Land had offered for his apprehension.
The sixth day of February, 1851, will be long remembered as the most
disastrous day that has ever, up to present, befallen any of the colonies or dependencies
of the British Empire. It is acknowledged by all except those who are insane or


fools, 01 have made up their minds to be dissatisfied with everything and everybody
and every part of the globe, that Victoria has as salubrious and delightful a climate
as any country in the world. There is one material drawback (but what climate has
not a drawback ?) however, in the north winds which blow at intervals during the
summer months, and which are oppressive even to those of sturdy frame and vigorous
health. It we had not these hot winds, doubtless we might become acquainted
with something worse, since they are highly beneficial in destroying what would
produce the germs of disease, licking up like a flame all decayed matter. While
these winds blow the thermometer ranges as high as lOOdeg. as a general rule,
and sometimes, but rarely, it registers 105deg. in the shade. These winds occasion
a temporary inconvenience, but are not injurious to the physical frame; it is to the
sudden change by which they are invariably followed that we must refer the mischief
done to the general health. In the year 1851 the colonists experienced a very severe
season, through the long continued drought. The heat continued until June, and no
rain fell until July and August. Food and water became scarce in every district, and
great numbers of stock perished. For two months preceding Black Thursday, the
country had been under the influence of hot winds. Everything was in a manner
baked. The north wind set in early on the morning of the 6th of February, and by
noon increased to a hurricane, and bush fires swept across whole districts, crossing
roads and wide streams, destroying everything that stood in its way. From Gisborne
to Carlsruhe nothing could be seen but the blackened trunks of trees. The whole
country far and wide was filled with dense volumes of smoke, while the thermometer
is said to have reached llßdeg. in the shade. Many saved their lives by flying to
the creeks and water-holes. The wind suddenly changed at nightfall, and the
thermometer in consequence fell to BOdeg. This awful catastrophe produced a very
great amount of destitution, numbers were utterly ruined, having lost all they
possessed. Great exertions were made by the people to alleviate the distress, and a
public meeting was held in Melbourne, when a large sum was subscribed—in Geelong-
alone FI 100 being raised —and under the direction of a committee distributed
amongst the sufferers.
An invasion of another description took place through the discovery of gold,
and one which has ever since proved a great source of difficulty and diversity of
opinion. No later than September, 1887, the question of legislating on lines adverse
to the Chinese was touched upon by Sir Henry Parkes, at a banquet given in his
honour at Adelaide. “He had,” he said, “ joined in legislation adverse to the Chinese;
but it had not been from any low estimate of the Chinese character,” &c. His
conduct was influenced by “a desire to preserve the British type in all these
Australian colonies.” The news of the immense resources of the Ballarat and other
goldfields induced the Chinese to arrive by thousands. It is estimated that twenty-five
thousand Chinamen found their way to the gold-fields, and they reported that
others were expected to follow them. Such being the case, the Legislature, having-
determined to prevent an inundation of this character, which would have most
undoubtedly proved disastrous to the interests of the Anglo-Saxon population, passed


some very stringent and restrictive measures, which had the effect of causing the
wave of Chinese immigration to subside. One question which early occupied the
attention of the Assembly was that of the squatting interest. We have already
alluded to the unequal electoral arrangements then prevalent, whereby the nominee
element in the House acted so disadvantageously as to destroy the principle of
representative institutions. Consequently, the matter was discussed with great
ill-feeling, as the non-squatting public considered themselves imposed on. What
they demanded was that the colonial lands should be sold in such quantities as might
meet the position of affairs under which the colony was now placed, and afford to
those who were immigrating and those at present in Victoria a fair and reasonable
opportunity of obtaining land. Possession being nine-tenths of the law, the squatters
rested their defence on that principle, and the “ Orders in Council.” They, however,
were in possession for pastoral purposes only, and although much of the country was
unused, yet some difficulty was experienced in dealing with their privileges, conceded
at a time when it was not anticipated that it would be found necessary to curtail
them. While the discussion went on in the Council, much valuable time was lost,
and great quantities of money which might have gone to purchase the
waste land, and thereby have led to an extensive and permanent settlement of the
interior country, were spent in mad speculation over the comparatively small portions
of land offered for sale. In a great many instances, too, the money was squandered
in the public houses, of which there was a great number. Some of the people,
disgusted with affairs as they stood, and anxious to obtain a home, went elsewhere,
Victoria, as a consequence, losing many prudent settlers. The squatters, however,
had a very fair case. Whilst wishing the colony to become prosperous, they were
unwilling that a state of welfare should be attained at their expense. They had
obtained a few years before the discovery of the Victorian goldfields —an event which
had the effect of doubling the population in twelve months —certain privileges,
combined in what are known as “ The Orders in Council,” and so named because
“ The Queen in Council ” had issued the orders and regulations, which Parliament
had previously advised her to do. These privileges, issued in 1847, conferred upon
such of the squatters as were in occupation over all the unsettled territory, or the
part beyond the counties, which consisted of about half of the entire area, leases for
a term of fourteen years. They had, therefore, exclusive possession of the territory
for a long interval, and, moreover, the other half was tied up in such a way that the
several occupying squatters had “ pre-emptive rights ” to the “ intermediate ” as well
as to the “unsettled” districts —the “intermediate” districts being the country within
the counties, excepting a “ settled” area around the chief towns and along certain
rivers. The squatter, accordingly, in pastoral occupation, had a pre-emptive right for
fourteen years, in the case of a land sale within the above areas. Although certain
general phrases of “ the orders ” justify the view that neither the Home or Colonial
authorities intended that the country should be brought to a stand-still in its
development by squatting privileges, yet they were so indistinct as to enable the
squatters to assert that they were qualified, and that it was possible to prove that
other parts of the orders explained the nature of the phrases.


The orders were referred by Mr. La Trobe for the interpretation of the
Colonial Office at home, where the Duke ol Newcastle, by his action, completely
upset the case ol the squatters, who had confidently relied on winning.
The colonial authorities had from the first succeeded in bringing to some
practical bearing the case between the squatters and the gold miners. Having
threatened to withhold the depasturing license, they compelled the squatters to afford
the necessary space upon any auriferous areas which at the time they held as a
“ run >” an d also to grant free ingress and egress to the goldfields on the part of the
miners and their commerce. The squatter need not have grudged to do so, as he
was far from being a loser in the transaction, since he could dispose largely of his
live stock. The authorities, although professing to take what lands were really wanted
for sale, were more or less influenced by the squatting body, which shared with them
strong anti-democratic leanings. It was only, therefore, after the inauguration of
self-government, that the colonial public were more equally represented, and that the
land question was fairly discussed. The fourteen years’ leases were never actually
issued, but from a desire to avoid the charge of repudiating the probable intention of
the orders, no complete alteration of land policy occurred until the expiry of that
period in 1802, the land act of that year in its proper place receiving our consideration.
About the end of 1852 land had begun to increase considerably in value, although in
the beginning of this year any tenement in Melbourne might have been rented for a
“song.” The exaggerated rumors of the amount of wealth which was obtained on the
Ballarat and Mount Alexander goldfields induced many persons from the neighbouring
colonies to come to Victoria, and consequently the streets of Melbourne, which had
been erstwhile deserted, once more assumed an appearance of activity. The
demand for dwellings was so great that it was not long before every house in
Melbourne was let at a very high rent. What with the rallying of trade and
the increase of diggers, the bustle to be witnessed every day on the streets was a
source of astonishment to those of a contemplative mood, of whom there were very
few at the time.
Numbers of people, through the want of information as to the position of
affairs at this time, came to Victoria, and, as they would naturally make for the
centre, Melbourne was found to be overcrowded. The overflow poured into an
impromptu creation outside, named “ Canvastown,” where it is estimated that from
six to eight thousand persons congregated on the south side of the Yarra. It
commenced on the slope of the hill just beyond the approach to Prince’s Bridge, and
extended nearly to St. Kilda. The main streets were crowded with boarding houses
and stores, all of canvas. There were also two small canvas towns in the centre of
the city—the Corporation, in its desire for money, having leased out the two market
reserves for a similar purpose. The necessities of those extraordinary times also
brought into existence a singular institution, which was designated by the undignified
name of the “Bag Fair,” which was held daily on the line of Flinders-street,
opposite the Customs House.
Everything they stood in need of was remarkable for its scarcity and dearness,


and more especially those vegetable products which the soil was capable of producing.
The lack of these products is traceable to the conditions of the minds of the people,
who wore intoxicated with a desire for speculation. This state of affairs had the
effect of raising the price of a cabbage to two shillings and sixpence in Canvastown,
and double that amount on the goldfields. The Government of the day should have
at this crisis sold some of the unused acres of land, and “ if,” as Mr. Westgarth
writes, “ the money derived from this land had been held pendente lite for squatting
compensation, or even been thrown into the sea, the loss could have been as nothing
compared to the advantage of so wholesale a settlement of the territory.” But
nothing of the sort was done, and, owing to the hesitancy of the Governor, the
obstinacy of the squatters, and the outvoting of the party in the Assembly in favour
of the scheme, the colony lost a golden opportunity.
Here those immigrants who had not sufficient funds to start for the diggings,
or who desired to part with all clothing save what was necessary, could, by exposing
them for sale, receive a sum of money infinitesimally lower than what they were
worth. It was possible to purchase almost any article, from the proverbial “ needle
to an anchor.” The “Fair” at last became so considerable as to injure the
shopkeepers’ business, who presented a memorial to the City Council, whereupon
that body decided to take into custody all persons guilty of exposing goods for sale
on the ground where the rag fair was held. The inequalities of life were well
exemplified at this mart; the poor emigrant disposing of his clothing, and the
successful digger from Bendigo or Forest Creek, could be met there —the latter bent
on indulging in an orgy in some of the bars, parlors, and public rooms, which were
filled with people in every conceivable degree of intoxication. It will be appropriate
to refer here to the public-houses, which were rented at from =£looo to TSOOO per
annum. The Government decided to issue no licences for the sale of intoxicating
liquors on the goldfields, but “ sly grog selling” could not, of course, be altogether
prevented. It is noteworthy that the contrast between the streets of Melbourne,
which swarmed with drunken debauchees, and the goldfields, was most marked—
very few cases of intoxication during the first years of the gold mining occurring.
The publicans, however, succeeded in obtaining licenses subsequently on the fields,
but as money was less easily made at this time, people were more prudent as to
spending it. Consequently, although general licensing was resumed, the new
houses receiving licenses did not amass the fortunes of which their owners dreamt.
Pressure was brought to bear upon the licensing bench of magistrates, since their
restricted issue of licenses caused a public-house monoply, but the magistrates
considered it right to adopt the policy of restriction, as they saw the use of the hotel
and the abuse of the public house. As a result of this policy there was a great
increase in the prices of rents and goodwills. Fortunes were made in the
liquor traffic in an incredibly short time, one publican near the goldfields clearino-
.£4o,ooo a year.
The recklessness displayed by those who brought down gold from the diggings,
and actually threw it about, was astounding, but the more prudent of the citizens


who had gone to the goldfields, finding it better to adhere to the advice of Phidias,
the famous sculptor, came back and took to their usual avocations. With the gradual
development of the goldfields, every necessary and luxury of life was much in demand,
and advanced to a most exorbitant price. No rent, so high were the profits in
trade, was considered too great; and never before did sections of building land in the
neighbourhood of Melbourne fetch so high a figure. Land in parts of the city which
could hardly ever become valuable as a business stand, sold at from two to three
thousand pounds an acre. All kinds of mechanical labour advanced to the highest
price; bricks, which could have been bought before the gold mania at from fifteen to
twenty shillings a thousand, could not be purchased at this time for anything less
than from ten to fifteen pounds. It will, therefore, be readily understood that the
people became thoroughly intoxicated with the condition of things then existing.
The class which reaped the greatest harvest from the gold discovery was that of the
sheep and cattle farmers, who were at first inclined to believe that they would be
ruined by gold. From 1852 to 1857 the most profitable investments in the colony
were stations and stock. On the other hand, the agriculturists were sufferers, as the
produce of their farms could easily be imported from other lands; and owing to the
difficulty of obtaining a regular supply of labour, many hundreds of acres were by
their owners left untilled. The squatters did not at first feel the good effects of the
gold discovery, owing to the difficulty in procuring servants, but as has been pointed
out in another place, the demand for meat became so great that the cattle and sheep
realised a high price, and meat had advanced from IJd. to 7d. and Bd. per lb.
The squatters again had the advantage of the agriculturists, inasmuch as the
market for fresh meat was secure from foreign competition, and consequently they
could impose any rates they thought fit to exact.
On the 20th of July, 1853, the private escort from the Mclvor diggings to
Melbourne was attacked by a gang planted in an ambuscade near the road, and who
shot down the troopers without a moment’s warning. It was a considerable time
after the occurrence before they were captured, which was owing to one of the gang
having been arrested on board the “ Madagascar ” in the bay, on the eve of her
departure ; but he would, however, have had his doom sealed had he not been
arrested, as the vessel never reached home, it being supposed that she was
lost in the ice, or perished through fire. After having turned “ Queen’s evidence,”
he committed suicide; but his brother, who was engaged in the same manly sport
of shooting men from behind hedges, was apprehended, and therefore, to save his
neck, divulged the whole particulars of the plot. The evidence he gave was the
means of three of the gang —George Melville, George Watson, and William Atkins
—being convicted and executed. About the same time Patrick 0 Connor and Henry
Bradley, two felons from Van Diemen’s Land, who had escaped in a whaleboat,
arrived in Western Port. Their first act in the way of manliness was to walk up to
a ploughman of Mr. King, who lived near Brighton, and order him to deliver up his
team. The man’s refusal to comply with their request was answered by a bullet,
which killed him on the spot, and the immediate flight of the ruffians with the horses.


The numerous robberies they committed in Victoria excited the utmost terror amongst
the settlers, which was not allayed until their arrest by the police at Cain’s farm, near
Kilmore, where a desperate fight ensued, one of the mounted troopers being mortally
wounded. They were, however, overpowered, and conveyed to Melbourne, where
they were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Their behaviour during the trial
was characterised by a degree of bravadoism seldom, if ever, equalled, Bradley
remarking to the judge when sentence of death was passed on him, “ Thank you, my
lord; I’m very glad for your sentence —very glad, indeed.”
The position of the trade of the colony may at this period be noticed. The
resources of the branches of the two great Anglo-Australian banks as well as those of
the merchants were fairly able to grapple with the exports of the colony previous to the
discovery of gold, which amounted to ,£700,000 per annum, but it not is surprising
that when an amount of trade, ten times, or thereabouts, as great was thrown upon
them, they found the funds at their command taxed to the utmost. From the
establishment of the gold escort in October, 1851, until 1852, Victoria produced 173
tons 19 cwt. 1 quarter 12 lbs. 3 oz., valued at 70s. an ounce, worth £14,103,364.
A very small minority, who dug out large quantities of treasure, forwarded it at their
own risk to England, and the remainder wished to sell on the spot. The strain on
the banks can therefore be well guessed at, when it is stated that one great bank
could not have paid its depositors, by at least two millions, had there been a run
upon them at the time. In the early part of 1851 the value of the gold had not been
ascertained, and till a correct assay could be obtained from England, great caution
was exercised in its purchase. At Bendigo (now Sandhurst) gold sold as low as
fifty shillings an ounce in January, 1851, and at the same date in Melbourne it
realised from fifty-six to sixty-four shillings. In June, Ballarat gold brought as high
as eighty-four shillings, and the gold from Mount Alexander about eighty shillings
per ounce. Large fortunes were realised by those who bought at the rates prevailing
in 1851, and shipped their purchases to England. The money was obtained from
the banks, and it is hardly necessary to say that they saw a golden opportunity
slipping through their fingers, which they quickly remedied by entering the market,
and succeeded in monopolising the gold trade.
Gold being a royal metal, was regarded as claimable by the Crown, not only
on its sold land, but also on its own unalienated territory. The Government and
the nominee part of the Legislature generally took this view, while the rest of
the House opposed it. A conflict of the same nature had previously arisen at
Sydney from like causes. On the application of the Government for greater
amounts than usual, and for supplementary votes for the public service, the
Assembly reminded them that the gold was the cause of large sums coming into
the hands of the Executive, which were collected and distributed without reference
to the representatives. The natural inference was that if gold was yielding them
an ample sum, they were bound to supplement their wants from that sum, and
not throw the money, as seemed their disposition, into the ordinary revenue
under the Assembly’s control.


Again, it being found that a code of criminal legislation became necessary
lor the goldfields, the Assembly refused to discuss the proposed enactments unless
the mining licenses and other regulations which the Government deemed to be
exclusively their own, were submitted and received approval. There appears to
have been amongst our new legislators a happy temper and good-will, which is
conspicuous by its absence at the present time (1887) of writing, and one which
Mr. La Trobc helped to foster by agreeing to pay extra and supplementary
amounts out of the Crown’s goldfields revenue. The Imperial authorities having
been appealed to by the Legislature, Sir John Pakington, then at the head of affairs
in the Colonial Office, sent a reply surrendering to the Legislature, granting to
it the whole administration and revenues of the goldfields—a message which was
especially welcomed after the incessant preceding bickerings.
We shall now briefly consider the first serious misunderstanding which took
place between the diggers and the Executive Goverment. In 1853 the diggers
formed a society for the repeal of the license fee, which the Executive declined to
grant—a decision which stirred up a spirit of discontent culminating almost in
disaster. The La Trobe Government delegated arbitrary power into the hands of the
Gold Commissioners, who, by their illegal acts, aroused the hostility of the diggers,
a body of men generally law-abiding. Men were seized by these Commissioners and
chained to trees during the hottest part of the day, on the charge of digging for gold
without a license. This outrageous conduct caused even those who had paid the fee
to protest against such inhumanity. The Ovens was the scene of the first outbreak,
which occurred in January, 1853 —one Assistant-Commissioner, named Myers,
undergoing some rather rough handling. In the month of May, Forest Creek
witnessed a more serious outbreak. The police pursued the same arbitrary conduct
as their superiors, and whenever they discovered one of the numerous “sly-grog” tents,
on the Forest Creek diggings, simply burned it down. Had there been a trial
beforehand, no objection to the action of the police could be taken. It was not,
however, the burning of the “ sly-grog ” tents that gave so much dissatisfaction, but
rather the case of a respectable trader named Mahon. He kept a house for boarders
which was attacked and demolished—his family and lodgers receiving every kind of
insult. The public, believing him innocent, more especially as the informers were
one Mangan and a trooper named Christian —two men whom they looked upon as
perjurers—and fearing that any respectable person, under the pretext of selling
“ sly-grog,” might be deprived of his liberty, took action. Public indignation was
wrought up to such a pitch that it was found necessary to call out the military and
police ready to act. The following notice was posted about Forest Creek:—
MEN OF CASTLEMAINE.
Meet on the hill behind the Baptist Chapel, to discuss, relative to the proceedings of the Government
on Saturday night. Chair to be taken at four o’clock this day.
N.B.—The Sheriff has been invited to attend.
You are requested to attend the Police Court on Monday next, at half past nine o’clock, and
watch the proceedings,
Police v. Mahon.
Police v. Adams.


The magistrate acquitted Mahon, and gave the accusers into custody to
answer the charge of perjury; but no effort was made to reimburse Mahon for
the losses he had sustained. On the next morning a notice was posted about
the diggings in the following inflammatory terms
“Down with the trooper Christian, and shoot him !
“ Down with oppression, and the tyrant Berkeley.
“ Diggers, avenge your wrongs, and demand your rights, or otherwise you will live and die slaves.
“ Down with the camp ; up with Christian. Cry, ‘no quarter !’ and show no mercy !
Allusion has been already made to the remarkable increase of the prosperity
of the colony, and it will therefore be unnecessary to do more than state that absentee
colonists came rushing back from England in a state of wild distraction. The
earliest news about the effects of the goldfields caused them to expect that they would
be rendered paupers, as their properties would become tenantless, but they were
agreeably disappointed on reaching the Port Phillip Heads to learn that their gloomy
forebodings were incorrect. If a colonist of the shrewdest stamp was willing to give
seven hundred guineas a foot for a frontage on one of the chief streets, it must be
plain that the colony of Victoria was very far from retrograding.
“It is not all gold that glitters ” —a saying which would seem to show that the
colour and lustre of this metal possesses a magnetic influence over the minds of those
who gaze on it. From the earliest ages it has been valued, and allusions to gold
are not infrequent in the Old Testament. These go to show that the process of
refining metals by cupellation was known in the days of the Jewish Poets, who
employed the illustration to point a moral. Great perfection was obtained in
working gold in Egypt, at a period anterior to the selling of Joseph into that country,
and the jewellery and vessels found in Egyptian tombs as well as the drawings
thereon clearly indicate that the method of conducting the operations of washing,
fusing, and weighing the metal was known. The Etruscans wore beautiful ornaments
of gold, enriched with minute grains of the metal; the workmanship was unrivalled
until Castellani studied and revived the methods employed by the artists of Etruria.
It is not said that the supply of silver and gold was great, but it is probable, since their
commerce was such as to place the inhabitants in a position to make treaties with a
powerful nation like the Carthaginian, that much gold found its way to Etruria, and
was worked into their garments. No doubt the toga picta, tunica palmata, the praetexta ,
corona Etrusca, and the rich sandals which figured in Rome as insignia of office, and
were introduced from Etruria, were adorned with gold. Pliny states that in his
time mercury was employed both as a means of separating the precious metals, and
for the purpose of gilding; and Vitruvius, the famous architect, who wrote a work on
that subject in ten books, entitled “ l)i Architectural’ gives a detailed account of the
means of recovering gold, by amalgamation, from cloth into which it had been woven.
In the boudoirs of the Saracen sultanas, the furniture, which was of sandal and
citron wood, was relieved with gold and precious malachite, and their outer garments,
often of silk, were embroidered and decorated with gems and woven gold. Gold is
the only metal of a yellow colour which is, however, notably affected by small
quantities of other metals, silver lowering, and copper heightening, the tint.


When pure, gold is the most malleable of all metals. One grain may he
beaten into leaves which cover a surface of 5G square inches. A curious optical
phenomenon occurs when gold is very thin—the leaf appearing yellow by reflected
and green by transmitted light. Another peculiarity of gold is its ductility, since
one single grain can be drawn into a wire 500 feet in length, and an ounce of
gold covering a silver wire can be extended to a distance of over 1300 miles. As
this is not a scientific work, it is unnecessary to enter into the many results of
numerous discoveries as to its specific gravity and atomic weight, its conductivity for heat,
specific heat, tenacity, rigidity, &c., at melting point. Gold is found in nature chiefly
in the metallic state, and the distribution of gold-bearing deposits is world-wide. In
Europe the principal groups of veins are in slaty or crystalline schists, whose age,
when it can be determined, is generally Palaeozoic, Silurian, Devonian, or
Carboniferous, and, less commonly, in volcanic formations of the Tertiary age. In
the United Kingdom gold-bearing quartz veins were worked during the Koman
occupation at Ogofau, near Llanpumsant, in Carmarthenshire.
Some of the great rivers originating in the crystalline rocks of the Alpine
region are slightly auriferous in their alluvial deposits in several places, but of the
gold-producing countries of the Old World, the Russian empire has not only the
lion’s but the bear’s share, most of the gold, however, being derived from its Asiatic
territories. The gold deposits of the Caucasus, though immortalized in the most
famous of stories in Creek mythology, have been entirely abandoned since 1875. The
story alluded to is that of Jason and a band of heroes named the Argonauts, who sailed
in the ship “Argo” from lolaus in Thessaly to Aea in Colchis, on the further shore
of the Black Sea, to fetch the “Golden Fleece,” which was there guarded by a dragon
in a grove sacred to Mars.
Cold is found by native gold-washers in many parts of India and on the Atlantic-
side of North America; the chief gold-bearing localities are on the Chaudiere river,
near Quebec, and in Nova Scotia. On the Pacific side of America, extensive deposits
of gold are to be met with throughout the whole distance from Mexico to Alaska.
The chief gold-bearing localities in Africa are on the west coast, gold dust derived
from alluvial washings forming an article of export from many of the trading
stations along the Guinea coast. Brazil has also many gold mines. The gold
districts of Australia cover a very considerable area, extending from the east side of
the continent for about twenty degrees of latitude, the more important deposits being
those of Victoria, in which the principal districts are Ballarat, Castlemaine, Sandhurst,
and Beechworth. The industry comprises two principal classes : —Quartz and
alluvial gold-mining. The gold occurs in the quartz in many forms —as small specs,
as strings and ragged pieces, some of which are of large size, and rarely as crystals
or groups of crystals. Iron, copper, and arsenical pyrites, galena, and zinc blende
are the principal associated minerals, while a large proportion of gold is to be found
in mechanical combination with the iron pyrites. As to “ alluvial ” gold-mining,
there is what is known as “ surfacing,” where the gold is found in the thin soil and


rubble covering the surface of nearly-exposed Silurian rock. There is also the deep
lead ” mining, which is accomplished by sinking shafts through hundieds ol feet oi
volcanic and sedimentary layers over-lying the auriferous gravel-deposits of ancient
river beds. Having thus given a brief account of gold, we can proceed with our
narrative of gold discovery in Victoria, which brought about a social and industrial
revolution. At first some incredulity was manifested as to the reports in circulation
concerning the wonderful finds ; but when these were confirmed, Melbourne became
deserted by its male population, who soon after returned with masses of the
precious metal. Hundreds of persons came flocking in from the othei colonies,
and whole fleets of vessels from Europe and America were chartered for Port
Phillip. As many as 3000 immigrants landed in a single week in the month of
October, 1852. Ninety pounds weight of gold was taken out of one hole, and
a hundred thousand ounces were brought down by one escort. The amount
shipped up to that time was 1,250,000 oz., whilst 1,000,000 oz. were in various
hands. A party of gold-seekers arrived at Korong with a joint capital of 75., and
in six weeks afterwards returned to Melbourne with a quarter-hundredweight of gold.
Rents and prices went up with so fabulous a rapidity that a “ lean-to abutting on,
or a passage opening into, a main street, fetched from £4 to 15 a week. The
profits in business were enormous, flour selling in Melbourne for =£so a ton, and
other articles in proportion.
From TIOO to Tl6O per ton was charged for carriage to the diggings,
according to the distance and season of the year. Fortunes were made in a few
months, and sometimes in as many weeks. The facility with which money was
earned and the recklessness characterising its expenditure may be guessed when
a digger’s bride, on the occasion of her marriage, would be arrayed in satin and
festooned in chains of gold. The bridal procession consisted of as many carriages
as could be hired, and the celebration of the marriage terminated with a
boisterous orgy.
Melbourne at that time had few places of public amusement —the Queen’s
Theatre, Rowe’s Circus, Astley’s “Amphitheatre,” and the Salle de Valentine—
which were thronged nightly with visitors. There were no floral offerings bestowed
on a popular singer or dancer, but instead thereof a silver coin screwed up in a
bank note was cast to the favorite. A bunch of grapes cost eighteenpence, and
a very plain lunch in a very dirty eating-house could be had for from four to
five shillings. Artisans earned from twenty to twenty-five shillings per diem,
which, after all, was not so much, considering that a loaf of bread cost half-a-crown,
and butter, by the pound, sold for five shillings. The foregoing will afford the
reader a pretty fair picture of what the state of our great city then was, and
will enable him to understand the democratic sentiments existing amongst the
people —sentiments which led to the outbreak amongst the diggers that we are
now about to record. It was the third troublesome question of the time. The
Crown alleged its right to the gold and “to all its belongings in the way of


digging licenses and regulations.” In other words, the irresponsible Colonial
Government, and not the Colonial Legislature, held an almost unlimited control
over all the civil interests and the daily avocation of one-half of the population.*
A shepherd employed by Mr. J. Wood Beilby, who had a station on the
South Australian border, discovered as early as January, 1849, gold in a creek
near the Pyrenees, a mountain range in the west of the colony. This shepherd
sold his treasure to Mr. Charles Brentani, who followed the business of a
watchmaker and jeweller, in Collins-street, Melbourne. A great many questions
were asked, but he declined to give any information as to the locality in which
he picked up the gold, until, having been taken ill, he imparted to his master,,
out of gratitude for the nursing, the secret, and added that he knew where there
was plenty more to be procured. This information Mr. Beilby conveyed to
Governor La Trobe, who, with the Sydney authorities, desired to keep the people
in ignorance of the fact. The shepherd, who gave his name as Chapman, had,
however, disclosed the fact to Brentani, who had sent for him and fed and
clothed him. An expedition to the spot, to be led by the lucky shepherd, was
accordingly planned, and left Melbourne with the greatest secrecy. An idea of
the exaggerated anticipations they held may be formed from the fact that the
dray which they brought with them they expected to fill with gold. Their hopes
in this, as well as in everything else in the world, were blasted, as they only
succeeded in picking up two nuggets weighing twenty ounces each. A certain
mystery hangs round this affair through the disappearance of Chapman, of whom
nothing was ever heard again. His account as to the locality where the gold
was to be found appears certain, and it is to this strange individual that we are
indebted for the discovery of that which has had such a potent influence on the
world in general, and on Victoria in particular. The gold discovery in New
South Wales had the effect of causing the Victorian colonists to fear that the
population would be drawn off to that colony, and the value of property be
thereby very much reduced. It was not, however, until the latter end of May,
1851, that public attention in New South Wales had been seriously drawn to the
circumstance that a goldfield existed in the Wellington district of New South
Wales. A well-known character of those days, old McGreggor the “gold-finder,”
would occasionally, through his passing by mail on his way to Sydney, excite a
little temporary curiosity, since it was believed that he was laden with auriferous
treasure, of which he was about to dispose.
This curiosity subsiding, nothing more would be heard of the matter,
further than an occasional murmur that he had rejected some tempting offer, held out
by a Sydney jeweller or Wellington settler, as an inducement to disclose the secret of
the locality whence he derived his treasure. He, no doubt, found gold, as the progress
he made in life could not have been attained by shepherding, which vocation he
ostensibly followed. Thursday evening, the 15th of May, 1851, has been historically
famous, for it was on that date that Mr. Hargreaves disclosed the fact to a few
*Westgarth : The Colony of Victoria.


gentlemen, whom he invited to meet him at Mr. Arthur’s Inn, Bathurst, that he had
discovered that from the foot of the Big Hill to a considerable distance below
Wellington, the country was one vast goldfield. This man spent two years at
the California Diggings, and returned to New South Wales in January, 1851. Struck
by the similarity of the geological formation and external physical characteristics of
certain portions of New South Wales and the Californian goldfields, he, at his own
expense, and on his own responsibility, visited the Bathurst and neighbouring
districts for the purpose of making a personal examination. He rode about 300
miles and spent about three months in the prosecution of his object, which was at
length crowned with success, and to prove the veracity of his statement he
showed to the company present several samples of fine gold, weighing in all about
four ounces, which he stated was the produce of three days’ digging.
The Port Phillippians having resolved to counteract this powerful attraction, a
public meeting was summoned by the leading citizens, to be held on June 9, 1851,
when it was determined to offer a reward to any person who should disclose to the
committee appointed a gold mine capable of being profitably worked within a few
hundred miles of Melbourne. The first licenses to dig in Victoria were issued on
September 21, 1851, and in less than two months the value of all gold realised was
over T200,000. The diggings in New South Wales had been in active operation for
more than six months, and the total amount of gold shipped was, up to the 4th of
November, T218,940 6s. 3d. The following is a copy of the Gold License
issued in 1851 :
GOLD LICENSE.
No 1851.
The bearer, having paid to me the
sum of One Pound Ten Shillings on account of the Territorial Eevenue, I hereby License him to dig,
search for, and remove Gold on and from any such Crown Land within the County of Bathurst, as I
shall assign to him for that purpose during the month of , 185
This License must be produced whenever demanded by me or other person acting under
the authority of the Government.
(Signed) A. 8., Commissioner.
The general mismanagement of the authorities created much indignation
about the same time amongst the large population at Bendigo. Several public
meetings were held, at which sentiments were uttered plainly avowing the
determination to have the license' fee altered. At first the Executive regarded
these proceedings with a most irritating nonchalance, and took no steps whatever
to meet the views of the well-disposed portion of the diggers, or to silence those
of a dynamite temperament. The license-fee was thirty shillings per month,
and this being considered too high, the diggers told His Excellency in so many
words that they would not nor could not pay it. Mr. La Trobe had an
opportunity when a deputation waited on him of granting a concession without
doing anything derogatory to his Administration. He, however, not only absolutely
refused to reduce the fee, but said, on being informed that the diggers would
resist the payment of it, “if they did he was determined to do his duty.” This
determination he followed up—we dare say in the heat of the moment —by


wiiting in a despatch to the Governor-General at Sydney, that it was essentially
necessaiy to maintain the license-fee of thirty shillings a month. Shortly after
sending this despatch, as will be seen later on, he altered his mind, and consented
to abolish the tax, and at the same time sent a proposal to the Legislative Council
to that effect. The license-fee is admitted by all writers on the subject to have
been a most unjust tax, because “ as the chances of individual success diminished
the more annoying did it become. * Added to the feeling of injustice experienced
by the diggers, there was a growing disaffection manifested to the constituted
authorities. One exciting cause of this disaffection was Mr. La Trobe’s action
in nominating as one of the eight members, which the constitution of the colony
gave him the power to do, a gentleman from Bendigo to represent the diggers.
They declared that His Excellency could not nominate any man to represent them,
and demanded the right of enfranchisement. On the last day of August, a Bil] was
introduced to substitute for the license-fee of thirty shillings a month a fee of forty
shillings foi the remaining four months of 1853. The measure gave general
satisfaction. Previous to its introduction, the Bendigo diggers, on the 20th of
August, offered to pay a fee of ten shillings instead of thirty. They, at the same
time, lesolved to write on their tents, “ No license taken here,” and to appoint
a number of persons to pay, on August 27, the proposed fee to the Resident
Gold Commissioner. To the petition presented to Mr. La Trobe on August 1,
he replied on the 20th, by stating that he had no power to alter the law; but
seeing that the existing Goldfields Act would expire at the close of the year, the
subject would receive due consideration. On August 29, a trooper arrived from
Sandhurst with despatches of the 28th from the Chief Commissioner of the
Goldfields. One of these despatches contained the alarming information that
a monster procession had taken place on the 27th; that the processionists fired
shots in the air, and sent a deputation to offer ten shillings as the license-fee.
They also conveyed the news that on the following day another meeting was held
to denounce the appointment of any nominee to represent them, and that the
following resolution was passed : —“ That the meeting regarded with contempt
the appointment of any nominee to represent their rights in the Council, and
that if any nominee, so appointed, entered the Council, it would be in opposition to
the will of the people of Bendigo.” This information caused the utmost
consternation, and resulted in the ultimate triumph of the diggers. The Chief
Commissioner of Police, on his arrival in Melbourne from Sandhurst, on September
Ist, confirmed the truthfulness of the despatches. Such being the case, Mr.
La Trobe sent Colonel Valiant to Bendigo with 150 men of the 40th Regiment
known as “the Fighting Fortieth”—and the Commander of H.M.S. “Electra”
landed a force to jnotect the Melbourne Gaol. There was, therefore, at Bendigo
when the detachment arrived, 279 soldiers and 171 police, 66 of the latter being
mounted. At Ballarat, the ordinary license-fee was paid with but little murmuring,
and at Castlemaine, which showed a little sympathy with the Bendigo diggers,
* McCombie; History of Victoria.


700 licenses were taken out on September 1. One of the most riotous was a man
named Edward Brown, who, about this time, was charged by Mr. Adams, a
storekeeper, with having threatened to burn down his store on Bendigo because
he refused to subscribe funds to carry on the agitation. He was captured, tried, and
sent to Melbourne Gaol. The Government, by an act of theirs, proved to the
miners their vacillation. At the very moment that order had been restored, and
that the diggers were satisfied with the concessions made to them, the Executive, at
its wit’s end, stirred up discontent once more. The intention of the Government
not to enforce the license-fee had been announced by the following notice :
GOVERNMENT NOTICE.
His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to notify that, it having been decided to
propose, without delay, another mode of raising revenue, in lieu of that now derived from the
goldfields, this measure will at once be presented to the Legislative Council; but in the meantime
no compulsory means shall be adopted for the enforcement of the license for the month of September.
(Signed) W. R. WRIGHT.
Commissioner’s Camp, Sandhurst.
Scarcely had this conciliatory notice been issued, when another of a diametrically
opposite character appeared :
PUBLIC NOTICE.
Colonial Secretary’s Office, Melbourne.
His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor directs it to be notified that the proposed abolition
of the license-fee to gold-diggers in no way affects the obligation of anyone to pay the current
license-fee until a new act may be passed by the Legislature. In the meantime the law must be
observed. His Excellency relies or. the good sense and loyalty of the community, and the influence
of their example in supporting and maintaining the law.
By His Excellency’s Command.

HON. SIR HENRY PARSES, M.L.A., KC.M.G.
Mm times when each chief tenant, it is said, under the ,Crown, brought his
mm own tenants into the field, and led them, distinct war cries were common,
r -^ ie R°y a l. cry was, “ St. George for England;” while the French cried,
“ Montjoye St. Denis.” This cri de guerre, which was the watchword of the camp, came,
by degrees, to be adopted by the individual members, each selecting that cry which
harmonised with his own feelings and propensities. From this source is traceable
the numerous mottoes that obtain at the present day. Those were the days of
feudalism; we live not in such an age, and yet, although feudalism in the letter
is dead, feudalism in the spirit is alive. Mr. Matthew Arnold, speaking of a certain
institution, said, “We have the grand name, without having the grand thing.” But
we, here in Australia, could say with truth, “We have the grand thing, without
having the grand name.” Have we not our chief tenant ? Have we not our cries ?
In political warfare there are two cries, and only two —Liberalism or Conservatism,
Freetrade or Protection; all other questions assuming a comparative insignificance,
and occupying a secondary place. It is not within the province of a publication such
as this to criticise the actions of public men from a partisan point of view, but it may
be legitimate, it undoubtedly is, to present a man in a different light to that in which
he has been recognised by the public in times gone past. Every artist is at liberty
to select his own colours, and pourtray his subject as his taste or choice suggests,
provided he keeps within the limits of rationality, and does not seek to create effect
in his treatment of it. Especially is this the case when endeavouring to educate
public opinion; the finest faculties of precision and judgment must be called into
requisition, and exercised with the greatest skill. Public opinion is a shifting
sand-bank, and deft would be the steersman who could avoid, at some time or other
in his political career, running his barque on it. Political reputations are frequently
wrecked where there is no anticipation of such a mishap, while those who contribute
to it are the sufferers. He who rises to denounce or malign an opponent, supposed
or real, may for the nonce achieve victory and obtain revenge, but in the long
mn vengeance is meted out to him who struck the blow. Society ostracises, but
society has been the aider and abettor of the means that has reduced its victim
to the stage which renders ostracism compulsory. Hector is the embodiment of
a section of society, and the bully and swagger of Hector encounters a double
catastrophe, suffers a defeat of a twofold nature, little suspected by him. Achilles is
estranged from his comrades, it is true, and remains inexorable in his tent while


defeat attends the Greeks. An assemblage of his countrymen visit him, reveal
to him a direful state of affairs, implore his aid in this, their day of great distress,
hut he yields only so far as to allow Patroclus to take his chariot and to assume his
armour. The news of the fall of his friend Patroclus, whom Hector slew, at length
rouses Achilles; he rushes from his tent, equipped with new armour, fashioned by
Hephaestus; drives back the Trojans; slays Hector; ties the body to his chariot;
drags it round the tomb of Patroclus, and then thrice round the walls ot Troy.
“Last scene of all:” —his aged father intreats Achilles, by kissing the hand whicn
slew his son, to give back the mangled body. Truly then is Hector the embodiment
of a section of society. It finds itself frustrated, disgraced, defeated, and its deputy
must beg permission to receive its corpse, and, if possible, resuscitate it. This is
allegory, and yet any intelligent reader can fill in the details, and assign to each
character its fitting place.
It is our pleasing duty to record the career of one who is, of a truth, in many
respects, an antitype of the Homeric hero. Henry Parkes was born in Stoneleigh,
Warwickshire, on May 27, 1815, and lived in England until he was twenty-four
years of age. Although most of his time was spent in hard, manual labour, he
continued, by reading, to improve the elementary education he had received, first at
school in Kenilworth, and then at the Mechanics’ Institute, Gloucester. When
eleven years of age, he was obliged to earn his own living by working in one of the
large iron foundries near Birmingham. It is matter of surprise to many how it comes
that mechanics are such good politicians, but any one acquainted with the habits
prevalent in workshops readily understands that no better training school in politics
can be procured. Animated discussions are regularly held by the men while at work,
and on their way to and from their homes. An average mechanic is generally as
well versed in the history of politics and social topics as many ordinary legislators,
both in the Old Country and elsewhere. In such an atmosphere, Henry Parkes
must have been, more or less, seized with a desire to take his stand amongst his
fellow-workmen, and, doubtless, were any of them at present living, they might be
able to recount some of his early attempts in debate. He arrived in New South
Wales in 1839, and worked in the iron store of Mr. Burdekin, and afterwards in
Messrs. Bussells’ foundry. On leaving the latter establishment, he received an
appointment in the Customs, but after some time commenced business for himself
in Hunter Street. Mr. Parkes’s political era may date from 1848, being signalized
by the active support he gave Mr. Bobert Lowe, now Lord Sherbrook, who offered
himself in that year for election in Sydney. For some years previously the
anti-transportationists had been taking vigorous steps to suppress the abominable
system. In 1835, an association was formed, which gave birth to the Australian
League, having for its object co-operation with Members of the Imperial Parliament
in respect of the colony. Air. Parkes was one of the members of the league’s
council, formed to advocate the cessation of transportation, which, as is well
known, took place in 1840.


At the repeated meetings held to counteract the attempts made to revive the
system, Mr. Parkes became prominent as a public speaker. In 1850 Mr. Parkes
originated the Empire, which appeared at first as a tri-weekly paper, afterwards
coming out daily. It was an opponent of the Sydney Herald, then the only daily
paper in New South Wales, and the organ of the influential portion of the
community. The Empire rapidly gained popularity, as it advocated the formation of
a constitution on a more liberal scale, and its columns were filled with telling articles
by some of the ablest contributors of the day. The venture not proving a thorough
financial success, Mr. Parkes discontinued his connection, after having skilfully
conducted it for seven years. In 1853 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the
representation of Sydney, but in the following year defeated Mr. Kemp, under the
old system, by a large majority. In 1842 a meeting was held in Sydney to petition
the Imperial Parliament for an amendment of the Constitution, which was daily
becoming more urgent.
The Imperial Parliament in the following year passed an act, granting
responsible government to the colony, by the formation of a House, consisting of
fifty-four members, thirty-four of which were to be elected by the people ; the first
election taking place in June.
Dr. Lang writes, some years later, of the first Legislative Council of the
colony :—“ I question whether the first Legislative Council of New South Wales,
under the Constitution of 1842, has ever been surpassed by any Legislative Council
out of England in the British Empire.”
Owing to the loyal adherence of Mr. Parkes to his party, he was re-elected
as one of the four representatives of Sydney under the present Constitution Act,
which, in 1856, superseded the Imperial Act. In 1853 Mr. Parkes, in company with
several representative men of the day, attended a meeting at the Eoyal Hotel,
Sydney, to protest against some of the original principles of the Bill, which were
subsequently eliminated. Owing to business engagements, Mr. Parkes found it
necessary to retire for a brief period from politics, and when he again entered the
House, it was as representative for his old constituency of Kiama. He exerted all
his energies to aid in passing the Electoral Act in 1858. On his return from
England in 1863, whither he had gone in 1861, accompanied by Air. W. B. Dailey,
as Emigration Commissioner, he resumed his position in the political world.
Henceforth his name is closely identified with the Free-trade policy (he is a member
of the Cobden Club), and he made himself conspicuous by his antagonism to
Protection, which he lately described in the following vigorous language:—“ Protection
was as old as misgovernment, as cruelty, as starvation, or as the down-treading of a
free people.” The victory won in 1864 by the Free-trade party over the Cabinet of
Sir James Martin was, however, of short duration, as they returned to office before
the expiry of twelve months. Mr. Parkes, whose contempt for the Protectionist
theories of Sir James Martin was deep-rooted, sallied forth once more to the charge,
and on a motion by him the Ministry was thrown out.


On the principle that union is strength, a Coalition Government was formed,
with Mr. Martin as Premier, and Mr. Parkes as Colonial Secretary. The Ministry held
office for two years, and passed the Amended Municipalities Act, as well as the Public
Schools’ Act of 1800. Perhaps the latter measure is the one hy which Mr. Parkes
will ho host remembered. The principal features of the act arc a provision for
national and denominational education in State and Church Schools under the
control of a nominee council. Strenuous opposition was offered to the doctrine
that the funds of the State should he applied to assist schools in connection with
religious denominations, on the grounds that religious teaching ought not to be
entrusted to the care of the State, its sole duty being to see that every child received
a secular education. The measure, however, passed in 1807. When royalty, in the
person of the Duke of Edinburgh, graced the colony of New South Wales in 1808,
Mr. Parkes, in his capacity of Colonial Secretary, was one of the Cabinet which
tendered a reception to that noble personage. In September, 1808, Mr. Parkes
withdrew from the Ministry, owing to a disagreement with his colleagues over the
treatment which Mr. Duncan, Collector of Customs, received at their hands. Owing
to the pressure of commercial engagements, Mr. Parkes withdrew from political life
in 1870, but in the following .year Mudgee sent him back again as its representative.
Mr. Forster, whose motion defeated the Martin-Robertson Cabinet in 1872, failing to
form a Ministry, Mr. Parkes was sent for, and retained the Premiership until 1875,
when his Government was defeated by Sir John Robertson’s motion relating to their
release of Gardiner, the bushranger. Resuming the leadership of the Opposition,
which he had delegated to others, he defeated the Government in 1877, his Ministry
enjoying but a brief life, as it gave place to that of Sir John Robertson in August of
the same year. It was in this year that he had the honour of colonial knighthood
conferred on him. When the appeal to the constituencies took place in December, a
remarkable incident occurred ; both leaders were rejected by the electors. However,
it was not long ere a seat was found for Sir Henry, through Mr. Hill, member
for Canterbury and one of his faithful followers, giving way in his favour. A
harassing state of affairs now began to obtain, the entire proceedings in the House
appearing to be nothing short of a political duel between the two leaders —the defeat
of Sir John Robertson’s Ministry on the meeting of Parliament—the inability
of Sir Henry Parkes to collect from the various parts of the House a number
sufficient to form a strong Cabinet. Mr. Parnell, whose name is closely identified
with the Land Bill of 1884, was thereupon invited to guide the helm of State, and
succeeded in doing so until December, 1878, when his Land Bill was rejected, and
the Ministry, as a consequence, turned out of office. Sir Henry was again at the
wheel of the parliamentary ship, but as stormy weather was anticipated, he invited
Sir John Robertson to give him a hand. This act brought down on Mr. Parkes’s
head the indignation of his political opponents, who were not sparing in pouring out
their phials of wrath; but it is a certain sign of the weakness of a party’s cause when
they employ the weapons ol abuse and ridicule, instead of having recourse to sound


argument and rational criticism. The Coalition Ministry held the reins of
Government until the general election of 1880, when it was returned to office with
some changes in the Cabinet.
In 1881 the Public Instruction Act now in force was passed, having for its
basis secular and compulsory education, and entrusting its administration, which the
nominee council, according to the provisions of the measure of 18GG, controlled,
under the Minister for Public Instruction—Sir John Eobertson—who had hitherto
led the Ministry in the Upper House. This measure received the adverse
criticism of the late Archbishop Vaughan, who acted in a similar manner to his
brother prelate, the late Archbishop Goold, of Melbourne, when the Education
Act of 1877 was introduced, by issuing, in conjunction with his suffragans, a
pastoral letter against the new system of education. The Bill was drawn up
on the lines that State aid should no longer be granted to denominational schools,
as it was found from experience that the measure of 1866, which contained a clause
providing for such aid, was unworkable. The measure was the subject of
considerable discussion throughout the country, and roused the angry feelings of its
opponents, but, nevertheless, was passed with enthusiasm. In 1881 Sir Henry
Parkes took a trip to England for the purpose of recruiting his health, which
had completely broken down through his unremitting parliamentary labours, and the
abnormal scenes of political excitement he was called upon daily to witness. He
was well received both in the United States and in Europe. Most of the celebrated
men of the day hastened to recognise the great genius of the man who had made
himself so conspicuous. Several banquets were given in his honour, at all of
which he delivered most telling and characteristic speeches. Kings and princes
did him honour. Great literary men vied with each other in paying him the respect
due to one who was regarded as the representative man of Australia. European
and American statesmen conferred on him the high compliment of consulting with
him on some of the most important questions of the day. He visited Stoneleigh,
his birth-place, and was accorded a public reception. On returning to the colony he
was entertained at a public banquet. And now, after what may be described as a
triumphal march, the Premier returns to find that a strange current of feeling had
begun to set in. People were inquiring as to how the extraordinary prosperity
of the past few years could be maintained. There was uneasiness, and signs
of anxiety were beginning to show themselves. The political atmosphere was
charged. The thunder-clap might come at any time, and come it did, for
the question to which Sir Henry Parkes and Sir John Eobertson—Can we
abstain from the sale of our land and enjoy a continuance of the present
state of things?—declined to give a reply, was fully answered by the elections
of 1882. Shortly after his arrival in November, 1882, the Land Bill, which had
been introduced, was the rock on which the Parkes-Eobertson Ministry was wrecked,
Mr. Stuart leading the attack on the Government. An appeal was made to the
country, which resulted in a complete overthrow of Sir Henry Parkes and his


colleagues, and, on the 3rd of November, he found himself a defeated candidate;
whereas Mr. Stuart, who, in the late Parliament, had on several occasions stood
almost alone, was brought back into power by a two-thirds majority to support him;
Mr. Barton, the Speaker-designate, heading the poll, Mr. H. 11. Reid coming next,
with Mr. Neville Griffiths and Mr. John McElhone, were chosen as the representatives
of the Sydney constituencies. Fully seven thousand people assembled on the
evening of that day to hear the declaration of the poll made, and there and then
occurred what many public men must endure —an entire change ot attitude towards
them and their acts. When the successful candidates had returned thanks to the
electors, Sir Henry essayed to address the vast crowd, but was met by a storm ot
violent disapprobation. He kept perfectly calm, and looking them straight in the tace
with a great degree of confidence, he waited until an opportunity would be afforded
him of saying a few words. But the vox populi, vox Dei, was uncontrollable. He
said little, and yet that little had its fulfilment in the early part of the year 1887.
“Some of you,” he said, “will live to regret the votes you have given this day,
and all of you, I trust, to deplore the jeers and insults by which they have been
followed. The name of Wentworth has been mentioned by some of the candidates
who have been chosen by you. I also would speak to you of Wentworth, and bid you
remember these words he spoke— ‘ The prosperous breeze of to-day may be the
adverse gale of to-morrow.’ ” Sir Henry was elected to Parliament by Tenterfield,
a mining township on the Queensland border, but he was voiceless and powerless,
and, in 1883, he went to England on a financial mission, which did not prove successful.
He returned to the colony disappointed, disgusted, deserted of influence, disregarded,
mistrusted, and smarting under the irksomeness of his position in the House.
After the prorogation in 1884, he resigned his seat for Tenterfield, having sat in the
Opposition, under Sir John Robertson as leader. In his farewell address to the
electors, he seized the opportunity of referring to the Parliament, in language which
led the generally astute Premier to commit a most indiscreet action at a later period.
Next in sequence of events connected with Sir Henry Parkes’s career came the
Soudan expedition, which he, as a private citizen, opposed, but he had no hearing,
and although the columns of the Sydney Morning Herald were opened to him, his
opinions were disregarded; in short, he was “out of touch” with the people. Being
most anxious to condemn the policy of the Government in this matter, he sought
and obtained a seat for Argyle, and once more appeared in the House on September 8,
1885, when the Premier perpetrated the action, alreadv alluded to, of noticing
and demanding Parliamentary censure of the Tenterfield address, and tabling a
motion which declared it to be a libel on the House, and the conduct of Sir Henry
unworthy of a member of the House. The motion was agreed to, but the
Government would not proceed to accept the challenge thrown out by Sir Henry,
who dared them to push the matter to its proper ending—to move his expulsion
from the Plouse —with the result that Sir Henry, while declared unworthy of a
place in the House, was, nevertheless, permitted to occupy his seat, and by bis very


presence bring down on the Government the contempt of a disgusted country.
By degrees the old Stuart party faded away, and the following general election sent
Sir John Eohertson hack to power. His reign was brief, as his Ministry collapsed.
He sought a dissolution, which the Governor refused to grant; hut owing to injuries
received in the National Park rendering him unable to attend to Parliamentary
duties, his resignation was accepted, and the sum of TIO,OOO was voted to him as
a recompense for his services. Sir Patrick Jennings succeeded as Premier and leader
of the House. Henceforward events began to develop themselves in favour of Sir
Henry, hut the course was not yet quite cleared. The Jennings-cwm-Dibbs party,
though lacking the confidence of the country, clung tenaciously to office, but the
heavy deficit which they partly inherited and partly created hung like a mill-stone
round their neck and seriously handicapped them, while Sir Henry’s steadily
increasing following was forming itself into a solid phalanx. Then for months the
House was the witness of nothing but unseemly scenes, which annoyed and disgusted
the electors. However, a split in the Cabinet terminated its existence. Sir Patrick,
owing to the conduct of Mr. Dibbs, demanded his resignation, which he refused;
whereupon Sir Patrick placed his own resignation in the hands of the Governor,
and Sir Henry Parkes was summoned, with the result that he has been restored to
power, supported by a majority that no Premier of New South Wales ever had.
Never has there been so exciting a battle fought in the history of colonial politics as
that which terminated in February, 1887. The plain issue before the colony
was:—“ How shall the deficit of £2, 000,000 be reduced?” Sir Henry undertakes to
answer the question by performing the act. His promise to the electors was: —“I
will bring your affairs back to a sound condition, and without infringement of the
principles of Freetrade.”
If a manifest purpose in his actions, implicit confidence in his powers, the
courage of his opinions, and an unconquerable spirit can effect the process, no doubt
it will be an accomplished fact. He has the fulness of experience of mature years,
and to-day he is perhaps the most important personage in Australia.
Replying, at a dinner given to him in the Town-hall, Melbourne, to the
toast of his health, he said —“ The whole secret of my success consists in having-
stated the earnest convictions of my nature to a generous people.”
Sir Henry Parkes is a warm advocate of federation, and, twenty years ago,
in Melbourne, upheld the principle of federal action in the following words :
“ I think the time is ripe when these colonies should be united by some federal
bond; for it must be manifest to all thoughtful men that there are questions
projecting themselves upon our attention which cannot be satisfactorily dealt
with by any individual Government.” Altogether, Sir Henry is, and has been,
one of the most useful public men of the present century; he possesses signal
ability, and all the characteristics of a general. He can fight an up-hill battle
with as much courage and patience as he could lead an army, confident of
victory, into the field. He is at the present moment absolutely the indispensable


head of the Government in New South Wales, an office which he now holds for
the fourth time, and in that capacity he has acted longer than any other man
in that colony. He is truly deserving of the conquest he has achieved, as his
career has been one of unremitting attention to the duties which have from time
to time been imposed on him. In every political question which has engaged
the attention of the House or the public he has evinced the warmth of his
sympathy with the opinions he conceived as right and just. He has, like every
public man, been the object of assault, but his armour has hitherto proved
impenetrable; and although he inherits the weaknesses common to all mankind,
he has striven, by a system of self-control and self-denial, to suppress and
finally eradicate many of them.
The country has once more reposed her confidence in him, and if she
erstwhile showed little or no consideration for his feelings, she has amply
repented of the offence, and would consider his loss a national calamity to
the country.

THE HONOURABLE WILLIAM EDWARD HEARN, L.L.D.,
Dean of the Faculty of Law, Melbourne University.
t ri3i|T' fairest criterion of the character and condition of a country is the
J'Aj application of the test regarding its public institutions, and in this
respect the test, as applied to Victoria in one instance at least, has
proved not only satisfactory, but successful beyond all anticipation. It is universally
ceded that national institutions depend, in a great measure, for their characteristic
features on the attributes of their leading representatives; and this being the case,
the position held this day by the Melbourne University points to the fact, that its
guiding spirits—from its very foundation-—have been of a class excelling in those
special gifts and qualities which have served to give shape to the dream of 1854,
when the subject of this paper resolved to make this university the leading
educational institution in the Southern Hemisphere. A zealous and devoted service
extending over a period of 32 years, renders it impossible to dissociate the institution
from the professor; and, consequently, furnishes an opportunity for the recital of a few
facts in connection with what has now come to be acknowledged in contradistinction
to its maternal prototypes —a University not regarded as the private property
of a privileged sect, alma mater to a certain community, simply training young
gentlemen to the learned professions, and infelix noverca to the rest, but a University of
a national character, sheltering all under its cegis. In accordance with immutable
laws, the excitement incidental to the discovery of mineral deposits contributed
largely in blighting the cultivation of those elevated tastes and refined sentiments
which supply grace and usefulness and power to national structure, which is
materially based on wealth and population: and some few years subsequently to the
first settlement of Victoria a section of the community awoke to the fact that the
humanising influences of education became imperatively necessary day by day, and
it was then suggested that a useful institution, adapted to the circumstances of the
colony, having in view the training of youth in a knowledge of the useful arts, should
be established and endowed ; and the suggestion was brought into fruition when, on
the 3rd of July, 1854, Sir Charles Hotham, the then Governor of Victoria, laid the
foundation stone of the Melbourne University on the spot where, only seventeen
years previously, the savage aboriginal had sat by his camp fire. How far the
expectations of those who had assisted at this memorable ceremony in regard to
Melbourne at no distant date becoming the metropolis of the Southern Hemisphere,
and achieving gratifying results in science and learning, as well as in the extent of
her commerce, the development of her resources, and the freedom of her institutions
were justifiable, we will leave to the decision of those who have watched and are
now watching the gradual growth, not only of Victoria, but of her sister colonies as


well. It was not without that pessimistic opposition which, more or less, clods the
designs of prudent men looking hopefully in advance, and seeking to make sagacious
provision for generations yet to come, that, amidst the exasperating excitement of
the times, on the 22nd of January, 1853, the Legislature was prevailed upon to
acquiesce in the founding and endowing of a University, and this, despite the
strenuous denunciation of the scheme as an ambitious and premature undertaking
of a doubtful and costly enterprise. The Act of Incorporation being passed, and
the Institution endowed with an income of T9OOO a year, payable out of the general
revenue, a proclamation, dated the 11th April, 1853, appointed the Council, with
legislative and executive power. The institution was formally opened on the 13th
April, 1855, and the day appropriately commemorated by the first matriculation of
sixteen students. The first professorial board meeting was held on the 21st
February, 1855. Within the short period of twelve years the Council reported the
gratifying result to the Governor of the admission of more than a hundred graduates
to the degrees of Master of Arts, Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Laws, and Doctor
of Music, thus calling for the constitution of the Senate, which was accordingly
constituted by a proclamation, dated June, 1807, after which date vacancies in the
Council were filled up by election in the Senate of persons admitted to full degrees
in the University. In February, 1856, seven candidates presented themselves for
matriculation; in 1884-85, no less than 965 students faced the examination. In 1855,
the number who attended lectures was 17 ; in 1879, the number reached 263,
and since, the numbers have been yearly increasing. The number presenting
themselves for examination for degrees in 1855-56, was 10; in 1878-79, 275:
and in 1885, 91 degrees were conferred. The total number of degrees conferred
is 787 up to 1885. The Faculty of Law was created in 1873, and the Medical
School established in March, 1862. In the year 1860, the School of Civil
Engineering and Architecture was opened, and 1875 ushered in the School of
Mines. The University possesses a valuable library, containing some 6,000 volumes,
including many important donations received from Crowned Heads, Universities,
Literary and Scientific Societies, &c. It is needless to expatiate at any greater
length on the realisation of the buoyantly brilliant anticipations of 1853, since we
have only to turn to records to know that the various learned professions throughout
the English-speaking world are often recruited from the ranks of those who have
been, and are still being trained in an institution which sprung under conditions
when the fabric of social communion, instead of being the outcome of gradual
expansion and development, was the creation metaphorically of a moment, and
which, by compelling the recognition of its sons as the peers of graduates of British
Universities, as evidenced by the issue of the Eoyal Letters Patent of 14th
March, 1859, has justified the choice of its early confidently chosen motto —Fostera
crescam laude.
Dr. William Edward Hearn descended from an English family that has, for
many generations, been settled in Ireland, was born at Belturbet, in the County Cavan,
in 1826. His father, a clergyman of the then Established Church, filled, at the time,
the position of curate there, but shortly after was promoted to the vicarage of


Kill argue, in the County of Leitrim, on the borders of Sligo, where the subject of
this memoir passed his early years. His father, a scholar of Trinity College, Dublin,
carefully grounded him in the usual branches of elementary education, and then
consigned him to the care of the Rev. Dr. Grcham, who had the management of the
Royal School, of Enniskillen, which, at that time, was considered the most
successful school in Ireland. From the outset of his scholastic career, his
achievements and triumphs were of that brilliant character, which commencing with
a First at the Entrance examination, and a Royal scholarship from his school,
followed by an undergraduate course of uninterrupted success in classics, culminated
in his graduating as First Senior Moderator in Classics, and First Junior Moderator
in Logics and Ethics, a double distinction which was, at that time, very rare.
Having then studied law in the King’s Inn and Lincoln’s Inn, he was called to the
Irish Bar. A voluntary tribute to his scholarship was paid in 1849, when, at the
opening of the Queen’s Colleges, he was appointed, without any solicitation, to the
Professorship of Greek in the College at Galway. As an explanation to this
procedure, it was suggested that the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, had
spontaneously reported to the Lord Lieutenant the surpassing attainments of Mr.
Hearn, who was, by them, looked upon as the best classical scholar that had been known
in that institution for many years. In verification of the opinions of the said authorities
and a further meed of tribute, the committee, of which the late Sir John Herschel
was chairman, appointed to select professors in 1854, for the newly established
University of Melbourne, without hesitation fixed on Mr. Hearn to discharge the
duties of Professor of Modern History, Modern Literature, Logic, and Political
Economy. He arrived in Victoria early in 1855, and has ever since remained
attached to the institution, thus bearing a large share of the burden of organisation
and work. Shortly after his connection with the University, the Indian Civil Service
examination became, for the first time, open to public competition, and Mr. Stevens,
one of his foremost pupils, entered as a candidate and went to England. His
competition resulted in his securing not only a high place, but the maximum number
of marks in English, allowed at that examination. The extreme juvenility of the
University from which Mr. Stevens had entered, and its first success naturally
attracted attention in London and reflected credit on Mr. Hearn, who had prepared
the eminently successful candidate. Not long afterwards a redistribution of subjects
in the University was effected, under which, Dr. Hearn giving up the subjects of
Modern Literature and Logic, undertook the Professorship of History and Political
Economy. In 1871, the chair of Classics and Logic became vacant, and at the
request of the Council of the University, Dr. Hearn assumed, temporarily, the duties
of that Chair, in addition to those of his own. Some delays occurred in filling the
vacant office, and Dr. Hearn continued to perform the double duty for a year and a
half. The strain was, however, too great, and his health was permanently injured.
The growing popularity of legal studies in the University, leading to a reconstruction
of the system of law teaching, in 1873, the present school was organised, and Dr.
Hearn was pressed to exchange his professorship for the office of Dean of the Faculty
of Law. This office he still holds, taking, as his share, the lecturing on


Jurisprudence, Roman Law, Constitutional Law, and International Law. Soon after
his appointment as Dean, Dr. Hearn resigned the office of Warden of the Senate, to
which he had been annually elected for several successive years. From his arrival
in Victoria, Dr. Hearn steadfastly bore in mind the two main objects in life he had
resolved upon. The first was to make the University the leading educational
institution in the Southern Hemisphere, and the necessarily meagre sketch in the
first part of this article proves how extraordinarily he has succeeded in his resolve;
and the second, to found, as far as in him lay, an Australian Literature, and in this
also he has been crowned, so far at all events as he himself is concerned, with
hard-earned and well-merited success. Within seven years his proverbial industry
and capacity for research enabled him in 1803 to produce his first considerable work
—“Plutology, or the Theory of the Efforts to satisfy Human Wants,” universally
considered in Europe and America, as one of the most important and original
contributions made in recent times to economic literature. This, like all the rest of
Dr. Hearn’s works, was not only written, but printed and published in Melbourne.
An amusing incident in connection with the first appearance of this highly valued
work is extant, embodied in a criticism in one of the leading literary journals of
London, the writer of which could not refrain from expressing his surprise that the book,
although Australian, was, mirabile dictu , actually written in reasonably good English !
A lapse of five years having intervened, the second of Dr. Hearn’s publications
—“The Government of England, its Structure and Development” —was placed
before the public and commanded immediate attention. Dealing with the growth of
English institutions, it was quickly accepted as a standard authority upon the
subjects of which it treats, and no higher commendation could have been given than
its being placed in its list of text books by the University of Oxford. Those
who know the exclusive tendencies of that university will understand the compliment
implied, in the admission of a colonial book to such a position. As a flattering
proof of its standard and accuracy, it need only be stated that Mr. Herbert Spencer
has drawn upon its pages very largely for his illustrations of “ The Descriptive
Sociology of England,” published a few years back. Observing the Horatian maxim,
Dr. Hearn was silent for the following ten years, and then his “ Aryan Household,”
an introduction to comparative jurisprudence, was given to the world. It professed
to reconstruct from the scattered fragments of evidence that are extant, the nature of
the society in which the men of the Aryan race lived prior to their separation,
and which, under various modifications, they brought with them to their European
homes. The publication of this book was one of a series of curious, though casual
coincidences in the author’s life. The book was published on a Monday. On
the next Tuesday the author won a great contested election for a seat in the
Legislative Council. On the following Thursday he was married. It is not often
that so many important events in a man’s life are crowded into one week. The two
remaining works of Dr. Hearn are closely related. The herculean task of the
consolidation of the Statute Law of the colony had, for some time, claimed the
consideration of the Doctor, and to him and to Mr. Justice Higinbotham, who rendered
him great assistance, the legal profession and the public are indebted for the


compendious and symmetrical codification in which the written law of Victoria
appears in the statutes. When Dr. Hearn had concluded that too much had
been written and too little done in regard to the codification in question, lie became
painfully aware ol the futility of any attempt without the discovery of a proper basis
of classification, and even then, he opined that the utility of such a discovery could
only be proved by actual experience. So far back as 1870 his consideration of
the matter had evolved a principle which seemed likely to comply with the required
conditions. Other engagements, however, intervened, and ho did not then pursue
the subject. But when his labours on the “Aryan Household” were completed, and
he had, at the same time, secured the seat in Parliament, which was essential to the
successful prosecution of his purpose, he set himself in earnest to accomplish
this great work. In 1883 he had so far advanced that the publication of some
explanatory statement of his scheme had become desirable. He accordingly
published a book called “ Legal Duties and Rights, an introduction to Analytical
Jurisprudence.” This book was printed and published by the Government Printer ;
but from an unfortunate departmental mistake the proper measures for bringing
it before the public were not taken, and consequently it is little known beyond
Victoria. In due course the work, to which it was an introduction, was laid
before Parliament in the form of a bill, intituled “A Bill to declare, consolidate and
amend the Substantive General Law.” This code presumably contains the 'whole,
both of the Common Law, and of the Statute Law upon the matters dealt with
in it. It has already had, before its publication, one revision from a body of
lawyers, and it now awaits further examination before it is finally submitted to
Parliament.
Dr. Hearn has always evinced a lively interest in public affairs, and has,
at different times, played in them many parts. It suffices here to say, that in 1878
he was elected for the Central Province to the Legislative Council by an
overwhelming majority of more than 2,200, in opposition to Mr. Berry’s Ministry.
After the retirement of the late Sir Charles Sladen he was chosen to fill the place in
the Council which that gentleman had occupied, and to criticise, though not
in an unfriendly spirit, the measures that are brought before it. When, in 1880, an
Act of Parliament rendered a limited number of the teaching staff of the University
eligible as members of the of that institution, Dr. Hearn was unanimously
elected to the first vacant seat. In May, 188 C, upon the retirement of Bishop
Moorhouse, he was elected Chancellor of the University; and he has, since that
time, directed his attention almost exclusively to the duties of that office. In
the following August he was offered, and accepted, the rank of Queen’s Counsel.
He was twice married, and has a family of one son (Dr. W. E. L. Hearn, of
Hamilton) and three daughters, two of whom are undergraduates of the University.
Dr. Hearn has always been held in affectionate esteem by all classes of
students, and was, perhaps, the most popular, as ho certainly was the most widely
influential member of the whole University staff.


THOMAS ROWAN, J.P.
M.D., SYDNEY; M.D. Ch. 8., MELBOURNE; F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., and L.M., EDINBURGH.
®|||HE family of Rowan is of Scottish descent, and derives from John Rowan, of
Greenhead, in the parish of Govan, county of Lanark, Scotland. He left,
Sjjlpll at his death in 1614, two sons, John and Andrew, the latter subsequently
went to Ireland, and was rector of Donachy, in the diocese of Connor, county
Antrim, from 1661, to the time of his death in 1717. He left two sons, Captain
William Rowan, of Derry, and the Rev. John Rowan, of Ballinagapog, county Down.
John Rowan leaving seven sons, the eldest being rector of Mullan’s, county Antrim,
and chancellor of the diocese of Connor. His eldest son, John, was high sheriff of
the county Antrim, in 1754. It may here be stated that the Rowan family are
intimately related to the celebrated Archibald Hamilton Rowan, the Irish patriot,
whose story forms such an interesting episode in the history of Ireland, in the days
preceding the Union; this remarkable man was of the family of the Hamiltons of
Killyleagh Castle, from which sprung Lady Dufferin, wife of the present Governor
General of India.
The subject of our own present article is the sixth son of James Rowan, of
Fort Hill, in the county of Down, eldest survivor of the Ballinagapog House. Its
numerous members have served in the Army, the Navy, the Civil Service, and the
Church, and during the last and present centuries have turned out an unusually large
number of physicians. Dr. T. Rowan was born on the 22nd November, 1851, and
received his early education at a private school on his uncle Andrew Rowan’s estate,
and afterwards at Mr. Frank Annesley Potterton’s preparatory school, in Newry.
During his school days he resided with his uncle, the late Rev. John Dodd, of
Downshire road, where he enjoyed the advantage of his uncle’s extensive library, and
from him received much valuable assistance in the prosecution of his studies. He
soon got a grasp of every subject included in the matriculation curriculum of the
Queen’s University, and had no difficulty in passing the necessary examination,
within a year of the time that he first began to prepare for it, in the Queen’s College,
Belfast, one of the three colleges forming the old Queen’s University. The
matriculation was passed in November, 1867, and he then commenced his studies in
the medical school, under the late Sir Wyville Thompson, afterwards the scientific
director of the Challenger expedition, Professor Andrews, and Professor Redfern, all
men of profound knowledge, in their respective subjects. Professor Thompson took
a great interest in his pupil and showed him much kind attention throughout his
whole college career at the Queen’s. Years afterwards, when Sir Wyville Thompson
visited Port Phillip in the Challenger their acquaintance was renewed, and the


Troedel kC°Lilho.
D r Thomas Rowan,




former old world friendship was re-established at the Antipodes; of the other
professors and teachers of Dr. Rowan’s day, at the Queen’s College, many are still in
harness, working for the good of mankind.
It was Dr. Rowan’s good fortune to have very able teachers at the Belfast
General Hospital, some of whom have since gained the highest level of eminence in
the medical world. Professor Gordon, for example, to whom the majority of his
students were reverently attached, was always a warm friend, and so also was Sir
William MacCormack.
During his third year of study Dr. Rowan spent the summer term in
Edinburgh with the intention of studying under the late Sir J. Simpson and
Mr. Syme ; but he was sadly disappointed, finding soon after his arrival in the
Scottish capital that both those eminent men were through ill health unable
to teach. He therefore had to be satisfied with their substitutes. The following
winter session was spent in Belfast, where he almost completed his compulsory course
for the Queen’s University Degree in Medicine, but having proved the superior
excellence of the Edinburgh system, returned to that school for a special course of
study in pathology, surgery, and the diseases of women. At the end of the Edinburgh
winter session Dr. Rowan broke down through overwork, and was recommended by
his medical advisers to leave the United Kingdom for a milder climate. He was
therefore reluctantly compelled to abandon his long-cherished purpose of taking the
Queen’s University M.D. prior to going into the Imperial military service. But he was
enabled to present himself at the April examinations in the Colleges of Physicians
and Surgeons of Edinburgh, where he gained his original qualifications. In the
month of May following, Dr. Rowan sailed from London for Australia, whither his two
brothers, Andrew and James, had gone some years before. He arrived in Port Phillip
on the 22nd July, fully restored in health, and with somewhat altered ideas respecting
military life. At that period Victorian affairs seemed so bright and encouraging
that he decided to stay and try his fortune for a time in the colony, and was soon in
harness at the Bendigo Hospital, where he acted as assistant surgeon until June,
1873, when he was appointed Resident Physician to the Lying-in Hospital and
Infirmary for Diseases of Women and Children, in Melbourne, under the late
Drs. Tracey and Martin. Here he remained, and with the latter eminent physician,
worked earnestly for the good of the hospital until July 1876, when he left the
institution. In 1875 he took the M.B. degree of the Melbourne University, and was
made a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. On leaving the
hospital he had the honour of being appointed Honorary Physician to fill the
vacancy created by the resignation of the late Dr. Joseph Black. It was in the
Melbourne Lying-in Hospital that Dr. Rowan first became acquainted with the
best and truest friend of his life, and certainly the ablest man Victoria has yet seen
in the special branch of the profession to which he devoted the best years of
his life. The late Dr. L. J. Martin, to whom Dr. Rowan chiefly owes his success in
life as an accoucheur, and from whom he gained much of the knowledge he possesses
on the subject of diseases of women, was, unfortunately for the Victorian community,
compelled to retire from practice for a time on account of broken health. He took


a trip to Europe in the hope of finding what he had lost; but too late, as he
died within the year. During Dr. Martin’s absence Dr. Rowan took charge of
his practice, and finished his course of lectures on Midwifery and Diseases of Women
and Children, at the Melbourne University. The Council of the University declined
to grant an extension of leave to Dr. Martin, but it was intimated to Dr. Rowan that
he might have the appointment for himself. He declined to make his application,
on the ground that he had first accepted the position in order to relieve his old and
esteemed friend at a time when he most required help—in fact, as a trustee —
and must therefore refuse to take the position. This was in 1878.
A few months later came the sad news of Dr. Martin’s death, and matters
became unsettled with reference to his house and practice. In June, 1879,
Dr. Rowan removed from Dr. Martin’s house, and began practice on his own account,
at 105 Collins Street East. In 1880 he was appointed a member of the Medical
Board of Victoria, to fill the vacancy created by the death of the late Dr. John Day,
of Geelong; in 1882 he was made a Justice of the Peace, and the same year
graduated as Doctor of Medicine in the Sydney and Melbourne Universities, and
he also took the degree of Bachelor in Surgery in the latter. Up to this time
the feeling which existed at the Melbourne School of Medicine against recognising
Sydney degrees in medicine ran very strong, but owing to the forcible arguments
brought to bear upon the Council of the Melbourne University by Dr. Rowan,
the vexatious barrier was removed for all time, and complete reciprocity established.
In 1885 Dr. Rowan established, in Melbourne, the first private hospital for
women, at 119 Collins Street East, where he proved, to his own satisfaction, that an
institution of the kind could be worked with success. Finding the premises too
small for his requirements, he removed to his present house, in Collins Place.

HON. MATTHEW HENRY DAVIES, J.P., M.L.A.
W 1880 Parliament expired by effluxion of time, and at the General Election
ES which took place soon after, the question of Reform was submitted to the
country, Mr. Service representing the Conservative side, and Mr. Berry the
Liberal. Mr. Service propounded an elaborate scheme of constitutional reform, and,
owing to a variety of distracting causes, the general election resulted in the practical
defeat of Mr. Berry, who resigned. Mr. Service as a matter of course took the reins
of Government, and calling the members together, made the Reform Question the first
business to be transacted. His Bill, it was contended at the time, did not embody
the principles on which he had been elected, and the House for that and other
reasons rejected his scheme. He then asked for and obtained a dissolution, and
Parliament, after having been in session only nine weeks, was sent back to the country.
The constituencies returned a House adverse to Mr. Service, and in favour of Mr.
Berry. That Parliament, which was elected in July, 1880, existed till the 2nd of
February, 1883, when it was dissolved by proclamation. During its continuance a
coalition was formed between the Conservative Opposition and the O’Loghlen party.
The compact was more implied than openly avowed. The two parties, under the
leadership of Mr. R. M. Smith and Mr. Francis on the one hand, and Sir Bryan
O’Loghlen on the other, opposed the Government while the Reform Bill was passing
through the House, and virtually destroyed the Government after it had passed.
When the Government were ousted, Sir Bryan O’Loghlen was sent for, and, after some
trouble, succeeded in forming a Cabinet, which did not include either Mr. Francis
or Mr. Murray Smith. After the formation of his Government, Sir Bryan unfolded
his policy at Lancefield, and this policy may be summarised as one of Peace, Progress,
and Prosperity. The policy as shadowed forth on the opening day—the 4th August,
1881 included a consideration of the following measures :—Land Bill, Railway Bill,
Water Supply Bill, Education Commission, Tariff Commission, Loan Conversion
Bill, Loans Bill, Harbor Trust Bill, Mining on Private Property Bill, Local
Government Act Amendment, Chinese Influx Bill, Land Tax Amendment Bill, Law
Reform Bill, School of Agriculture Bill, Public Reserves Bill, Public Health Act
Amendment, Rabbit Suppression Act, Vines Eradication Act, and Married Women’s
Property Act. When Parliament went to the country in February, 1883, Sir Bryan,
at Lancefield, claimed that his Government had at least erased the old party lines
which wracked the country two or three years prior, and engendered a bitter and
protracted struggle, when Constitutionalism and Liberalism were pitched against each
other in regular battle array; and for years the country had been kept in a turmoil,


pretty evenly balanced, over the question of the Eeform Bill. As a matter of fact, the
Government had totally failed to carry into effect the programme enunciated by their
chief at Lancefield.
At a time then, when the dissolution found both parties in Parliament in an
utter state of disorganisation, a majority of the thinking community came to the
conclusion that an infusion of new blood into the Assembly would prove salutary and
beneficial, and to this end upwards of a thousand electors in the constituency of St.
Kilda requisitioned Mr. M. H. Davies to contest one of the seats for the representation
of that district in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. In allowing himself to be
nominated, he gave his friends and supporters distinctly to understand that he would
run entirely alone. In referring to the waste of time that had taken place in the
House, he compared the business transacted in the House of Commons in a session
of six months with the business compassed in Victoria in a session of eight months,
wdien, though a host of practical bills had been promised, only two really useful
measures were carried into law. He animadverted rather severely on the neglect of
Sir Bryan O’Loghlen in the matter of the fiasco in regard to the floating of the loan,
and also on the summary manner in which he had caused Parliament to be dissolved.
It was not indicative of peace that the Government should have dissolved the House
without consulting the gentlemen who had supported them; nor was it indicative of
progress that when the country was crying out for practical legislation the outcome
was nil; nor was it indicative of prosperity that the English public had refused to
subscribe more than one-eighth of the money the colony had required. He w r ent to
the hustings not as a supporter of either party, but as an independent candidate, and
expressed himself in favour of placing the railways under the control of an independent
board ; of making no alterations in the tariff duties that would have an injurious effect
on any manufacturer in the colony; and of maintaining the principles of the
Education Act. The result of the polling placed Mr. Davies second on the list, and
secured him a seat in the Assembly for the representation of an important
constituency.
Matthew Henry Davies, Solicitor and Notary, Executive Councillor, and
Member of the Government of Victoria, son of the late Ebenezer Davies, Esq., and
Ruth, daughter of Mark Bartlett, Esq., of Bracknell, Berks, England, and grandson
of the Rev. John Davies, of Trevecca College, South Wales, Congregational Minister,
was born in 1850, at Geelong, Victoria, and was educated at the Church of England
Grammar School, Geelong, and at the Geelong College. He matriculated at the
Melbourne University in 1869, and was articled as a student-at-law to his brother,
John Mark Davies, in 1870. He was admitted by the Supreme Court of Victoria in
1875 as an Attorney-at-law, Solicitor, and Proctor; and in the same year married
Elizabeth Locke, eldest daughter of the Rev. Peter Mercer, D.D., of Melbourne. In
August, 1880, Mr. Davies offered himself as a candidate for the Prahran City
Council and was returned at the top of the poll, securing several hundred votes more
than any other candidate. In August, 1881, he was unanimously elected Mayor of
Prahran,

Mr. Davies lias always been very energetic in political matters. In February,
1883, he was elected a member ot the Legislative Assembly for the district of St.
Kilda in conjunction with Mr. Joseph Harris, and during that Parliament drafted several
bills, some ot which were passed into law. Upon the formation of the Gillies-Deakin
Ministry in February, 1886, Mr. Davies was offered a portfolio, but owing to his
intention of visiting Europe he was able only to accept a seat in the Cabinet as a
Minister without responsible office. In March following, the general election took
place, and Mr. Davies was re-elected for St. Kilda in conjunction with his old
colleague, Mr. Harris. Shortly after the election M r * Davies, while a member of the
Government, visited England, and joined the Commissioners of the Indian and
Colonial Exhibition, During his visit to England he was presented at Court by the
Secretary of State tor the Colonies, and enjoyed the hospitality which the Prince and
Princess ot Wales and many noblemen and gentlemen so freely gave, in connection with
the Exhibition, to representative Colonial visitors. Mr. Davies is a member of the
Council of the Law Institute of Victoria, and for four years occupied the position of
Honorary Secretary. He was the founder and first Secretary of the Society of
Notaries of Victoria. He was one of the founders of the Young Men’s Christian
Association ot Melbourne, and, for the first few years, one of its Secretaries. He is
connected with several financial institutions, all of which have been successful. He
is a director of the Mercantile Bank of Australia Limited, the Freehold Investment
and Banking Company of Australia, the Colonial Investment and Agency Company,
the Victorian Land Company, Henry Arnold and Company, and the National Mutual Life
Association ot Australasia. In January, 1887, Mr. Deakin left the Colony for a visit
to England, and his duties as Chief Secretary were undertaken by Professor Pearson
and Mr. Davies.


JUSTICE KERFERD.
tendency of the age, with its carping cynics, is to discount a successful
career hy attributing to good fortune what really is due to the persistence,
energy, and ability of the man. Thus it is that when in Austiaha we see
something analogous to the change “ From the Log Cabin to the White House, or
“ From the Tan-yard to the Presidency,” exemplifying that there never is a result
without an adequate cause, and that success in life is due more to individual qualities
than merely to fortuitous circumstances, we will yet find those who assert that such
changes are essentially due to good fortune, and that the individuals thus achieving
distinction are purely ordinary mortals with extraordinary luck. This explanation
may be very soothing to the amour propre of self-appointed critics, but egregiously
fails to account for a steady and gradual advancement of the individual in public
estimation. The public undoubtedly is rather a shrewd judge, and, though liable to
be hoodwinked temporarily —to take the spurious for the genuine—is not to be beguiled
into accepting definitely incompetency as a desirable or acceptable substitute for
ability. No doubt, much of the success that attends public characters is being
brought about by a rigid adherence and appreciation of seizing that “ tide in the
affairs of man which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortunebut then the very attribute
of recognising the truth of the aphorism and acting on the inculcation, especially in
the case of a politician, is indication of ability.
George Briscoe Kerferd was born in Liverpool in 1831, and is therefore now in
his fifty-seventh year. Of his youth little is known. Relying on Wordsworths
statement that the child is father to the man, and arguing by analogy, it may be
assumed that George Briscoe Kerferd was one of the plodding, methodical boys who,
while not figuring brilliantly in the prize lists, still bring away from school more
practical knowledge than those who outshone them in the class contests. He was
educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, and had for schoolfellows, among
others, Mr. W. H. Greene, Victorian Railway Commissioner, and Mr. Murray Ross.
As evidencing the tenacity of purpose which has characterised him throughout life, it
might be mentioned that his thoughts were directed originally towards the bar; and
though, in deference to parental wishes, he entered into mercantile pursuits, he reverted
in after life to his first love. His father had commercial relations with Mexico, and
it was intended the son should join him there. But the aphorism in regard to the
inutility of man proposing was once more verified when the discovery of gold in
Victoria took the world by storm, and attracted Mr. Kerferd, among others, to
that colony.

In November, 1852, lie left Liverpool, and arrived in Hobson’s Bay in 1853.
On arrival, lie abandoned the idea of starting a branch business of his father’s house
in Melbourne, and devoted himself to searching for the precious metal. Nine months
of hard labour and disappointment disenchanted him, and he returned to Melbourne
to pursue commerce. For a time he became a partner in the well-established firm
of W. M. Bell and Co., but subsequently he went to Beechworth, and commenced
business as a brewer and a wine and spirit merchant. Having secured a fair
competency through his brewing business, he relinquished it in favour of a more
congenial pursuit. His connection with the capital of the North-Eastern district
paved the way and furnished the opportunity for the cementing of so strong a bond
of friendship and esteem with the people of the Ovens electorate that, notwithstanding
the vicissitudes of a political career extending over a period of twenty-two years, he
has retained the confidence that he early acquired. Reverting to his early desire for
the learning and making of laws, he entered himself as a pupil of Mr. Fellowes, the
then leader of the Common Law Bar, and devoted the same perseverance to the
accomplishment of this design as had secured for him success in his previous career.
After a study of two years, he was called to the Bar in 1867. In adverting to Mr.
Kerferd’s professional career, it is to be deplored that politics prevented him from
achieving earlier in life that position which his sterling qualities would have gained
for him had he not elected to serve two masters. There can be no doubt that had
he devoted his energies solely to law, though he might not have worked his way to
the Bench, he would certainly have gained a standing at the Bar equal to that ol
many other eminent Victorian barristers. Although his was a form not constantly
seen in the Equity or Nisi Prius Courts, his legal experience was gained in the
chambers of the Attorney-General, where he became the Chief Law Officer of the
Crown. He utilised his leisure in compiling, in conjunction with Mr. Box, a “ Digest
of Law Cases,” which has been accepted as an authority. When, owing to a short
exclusion from office, he did devote himself to law practice, he obtained a practice
almost unparalleled in the Land Tax Court.
Mr. Kerferd’s right to a niche in the temple of fame has, however, been
secured as a politician. He entered the Legislative Assembly in 1864 as a member
for the Ovens district, and he continued to represent that constituency uninterruptedly
until compelled to retire from his representation on his elevation to the Bench early
in 1886. During his parliamentary career, with a few others, he bore the shock of the
Darling Grant Controversy, and, under Mr. Sladen, joined in the forlorn hope of
forming a Ministry to carry on the Queen’s Government in the teeth of an
overwhelming and bitterly hostile majority. He held, though for a brief period, the
position of Minister for Mines. His next Ministerial experience was in 1872, when
the Francis Ministry, after a severe struggle, ousted the Duffy party. In the Francis
Administration he was allotted the office of Solicitor-General, which was exchanged
for that of Attorney-General, on the translation of Mr. J. W. Stephen to the
Bench. From that date, he may be said to have had almost a claim to the
Attorney-Generalship of Victoria, irrespective of changes in the constitutions of


Ministries formed from the Conservative element. When Mr. Francis retired
from office in 1874, Mr. Kerferd was called upon to reconstruct the Cabinet, and
undertook the offices of Premier and Attorney-General until the defeat of his
Ministry in 1875. He next occupied the position of Attorney-General in the
McCulloch Administration from October, 1875, to May, 1877; in the Service
Government from March, 1880, to August, 1880; and in the Coalition Ministry
Irom March, 1883, to December, 1885. As Law Officer of the Crown, he held office
altogether lor a period of more than eight years.
For nearly two decades Mr. Kerferd has been prominently before the public,
and has established his claim to being recognised as a thoroughly representative man
by the steady growth of his reputation, which reached its zenith at the time when he
exchanged his political life lor the ermine of the Bench. In proof of his consistency
and the possession ol the attribute of common sense in a high degree, it may be said
that so great was the reliance placed on him by Premiers, that it was always looked
upon as an advantage to include him in a “ skittish team.” Placed in contrast to more
versatile and brilliant colleagues, he was yet unrivalled in his power of defence.
Speaking with vigor and conciseness, he scrupulously avoided personalities, and by
his imperturbable good humour often turned the edge of attacks. When introducing
a Bill, his promise to consider an objection always silenced cavil, and he gained the
reputation ol passing measures through committee on the shortest time on record.
It is noteworthy that the Bill authorising the appointment of a sixth judge,
and which was known to further the translation of the then Attorney-General (Mr.
Kerlerd) to the Bench, was carried through, amidst the hearty acclamations of both
Houses. Those who have carefully watched the career of Mr. Kerferd unite in
replying to the cry of a “job,” in regard to his elevation, which emanated from party
oigans “ And a good job too.” That veteran politician, Mr. Service, when speaking
on the matter, declared that Mr. Kerferd would bring to the Bench of Victoria “ a
judicial mind, honesty of purpose, intelligence, and patience.” That he will prove an
acquisition is evidenced in the opinion of one of his new colleagues—“ We know
more case law than he does, but he knows far more Statute law than we do.” This
very admixture ought to prove beneficial, and impart confidence to the public.


REV. GEORGE T. WALTERS.
IT ASIAN ISM was recently characterised by a writer as one of the vagrant
orces ro^es^ theology; but, recurring to James Martineau, a writer
to whom lew could revert without an assurance of consulting a more
highly spiritual and deeply intellectual thinker, the sarcasm, if such, loses its point,
and merely deteriorates into a bitter and decidedly illiberal expression. Though, as
} et, Unitarianism meets with but scant courtesy at the hands of the majority of
professing Christians, it is obvious that the dawn is at hand when the various sects
will unite more closely than they have ever done in the past, and work harmoniously
together for the general welfare; and as a testimony to the better feeling that is steadily
gaining ground, the following utterance of Canon Freernantle lately given at Oxford
is worthy of consideration, because of the high position and influence he holds in the
Established drench . It will be admitted that at conferences in which Christians of
"various denominations take part, the Unitarian members always produce a strong
impression by the Christian spirit of their utterances, even upon subjects which would
naturally provoke vigilance and criticism My own belief is that the
Unitarian controversy, like those which divide other denominations of Christians from
each other, is, to a great extent, a thing of the past, and that we can now, without
compromise and with a good conscience, cease from the imputation of unfaithfulness
on the one side and of superstition on the other, and receive one another as Christians
whose differences may supplement and aid each other. If we take the Unitarians
according to that which they confess rather than that which they deny (and I believe
this is always the best and truest way of judging in such matters), we may easily
find our way to union. In the great confession of the Divine Unity we are wholly
agreed, and its special assertion could only cease to be needed when all danger should
have ceased of debasing the image of God. Nor, as to the position assigned to our
Lord, is it clear that the fundamental difference which is usually assumed, exists
For what is the practical meaning of the confession of the divinity of Christ? It
is this, that we accept Him as morally supremej that our consciences acknowledge
the absolute dominion of His nature and spirit. We shall find none who make the
confession more heartily than do many of the Unitarians, and none who translate
this confession into practice more sincerely. What has been said has been limited
to the demand for mutual tolerance and recognition as brother Christians. But the
hope cannot be suppressed that a relation which begins with trustfulness will go on
to a deeper sense of unity in spirit and in principles, and lead eventually to a common
expression of our union in faith and life.”
The Christian Denominations generally are manifesting a much more tolerant
tone and spirit towards the body in question than formerly, and towards this,
Unitarian influence in the pulpit and in current literature has largely conduced. In


Melbourne, the ministrations of Mr. Walters have fully sustained his reputation as an
extremely able, earnest, and scholarly preacher, and one to whom it is always
a genuine pleasure to listen.
George Walters was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, on the 23rd
October, 1853. His uncle—Samuel Walters—was the well-known marine artist, and
several of his relations have, in some degree, identified themselves with the Fine Arts,
his cousin, George Stanfield Walters, at the present time being thoroughly known in
London circles. His mother was, prior to marriage, a Miss Jelketon, a member of a
representative Irish family.
Mr. Walters received a thorough commercial education, and spent some little
time with the firm of Nettlefold and Chamberlain, of Birmingham. During this
period, he pursued his studies privately in early morning and late evening. With
strong recommendation from the Midland Baptist Association, he entered the Baptist
College, but before his course was completed he embraced Unitarian views, and
resigned his position. After some time spent at a Unitarian College, he was
appointed to a Mission Church in Burnley, where he was successful in adding to the
numbers of the congregation. In January, 1878, Mr. Walters commenced his
Ministry at the Unitarian Church in Aberdeen, North of Scotland. At first the
attendance was very sparse, and for a period of six years he laboured earnestly in the
cause, with the result that during the last two years the evening congregations were
generally large enough to crowd the building. During his Ministry at Aberdeen the
church was renovated throughout, and beautifully decorated inside. It was mainly
owing to his persistent efforts in the cause that at this time the Unitarians succeeded
in overcoming, to a certain extent, the prejudice that existed against them j insomuch
so, that clergymen of the Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Congregational and other
churches, assisted them at one time or another with lectures and addresses.
Mr. Walters had always taken a lively interest in political matters, and during
his stay in Aberdeen was instrumental, in conjunction with Professor Minto, in
brimhno- into existence the Junior Liberal Association. He was a prominent member
O O
of the Parliamentary Debating Society, which numbered nearly two hundred members,
and often held discussions in the presence of several hundred persons. When he
left Aberdeen, Mr. Walters was presented with elegant illuminated addresses from his
congregation and the members of the Junior Liberal Association. Early in 1884,
upon the recommendation of a committee of the British and Foreign Unitarian
Association, he was chosen to fill the pulpit of the Melbourne Unitarian Chnrch.
Since his arrival in Melbourne the cause has been advancing. The old church has
been pulled down, and a new church with a lecture-hall is in course of erection.
His brother, Eev. Frank Walters, was for four years a Baptist minister, but has since
then been minister of the Unitarian Churches in Preston, Glasgow, and Newcastle.
In 1876 Mr. George Walters was married to Marian Eadcliffe, daughter of Mr.
M. Wylde Eadcliffe of Wolverhampton, by whom he was presented with four
children, two of whom are living. On the death of his first wife Mr. Walters married
in 1886 Myra, daughter of the late Mr. George Tuckett, of Ballarat.




Fergus son & Mitchell. Li th.
Sir Samuel W. Griffith.


BON. SIR SAMUEL WALTER GRIFFITH, M.A., Q.C., K.C.M.G.
Premier and Chief Secretary of Queensland.
the rickety politics and rockety statesmanship which is frequently
SSlilH encountered, it must be as cheering to the bewildered explorer of truth
mm to meet with a man of pure conviction, and that experience which tempers
energy, as it is refreshing to the wearied traveller in the desert to catch the first
glimpse of the oasis. The simile may not be inaptly applied to the subject of this
memoir, one of the most prominent of the public men of Australia. Time was when
the politicians and statesmen of this continent were regarded by those in other parts
of the world as mere place-hunters and adventurers, but a more intimate acquaintance
with Australia’s really Representative Men has sufficed to dispel that illusion. True
it is that the modes of procedure at times are not quite in harmony with those of
countries more matured by age, and equally true is it that the measures passed by
the several Legislatures may appear subversive of what is considered essential
amongst nations rendered conservative from many circumstances; but it must be
borne in mind that specific cases require specific treatment, and the vigour with
which measures may be attacked and defended are indicative of a health-throbbing
vitality. Australia is still a young country, and perhaps will continue so in another
sense of the word, owing to the fresh blood which is ever infused into her public
men, not only by the advent of rising and self-reliant men to her public councils, not
only by the introduction of new ideas originated by these men, but by the enthusiasm
which fires the patriot to see his country prosper. Such men leave their impress on
the national life of a country, and although, when they have passed the boundary of
time, it matters nought to them of posthumous fame, yet the desire that their good
deeds live after them must urge them to tread the paths of duty, to do the right, and
denounce the wrong. It cannot, however, be said that Sir Samuel need console
himself with such a prospect, for already, and for some time past, has his work as a
politician and statesman received a due and deserved recognition. It is without the
limits of a short biographical sketch to pronounce how or when —the duty of a
biographer being merely that of a chronicler of facts with a due regard foi truth.
Sir°Samuel was born at Merthyr Tydvil, Wales, on June 21, 1845; and as ins father,
the Rev. Edward Griffith, a Nonconformist Minister of that town, emigrated in
1853, he was but eight years of age when he reached the shores of Australia.
Coming here in his boyhood and growing up amongst colonial institutions, he is
thoroughly Australian in ideas, sympathy, and genius. His father, immediately


after his arrival, was inducted to the charge of the Congregational Church, Ipswich.
After remaining there for some time he removed to Maitland, and afterwards to the
capital city of Queensland, where by his energy, his love, his sympathy and
earnestness, displayed for more than a quarter of a century, he has gained the loving
esteem and respect of one of the most intelligent and largest congregations in
Brisbane. Sir Samuel's preliminary education was received at the academy of Mr.
R. Harriman, Sydney, from which he passed in 1856 to the High School, West
Maitland, where, under the then head-mastership of the Rev. W. MTntyre, ho
received an admirable training, which has, in a large measure, contributed to his
mental superiority. In 1860 he entered the University of Sydney, and there justified
the anticipations of his friends and previous masters. He was a severe student, but
could, nevertheless, enjoy that life which is inseparable from a University, and he
may be cited as one of those few who distinguish themselves alike in Classics and
Mathematics, gaining special scholarships in both subjects, and going out in the B.A.
Examination as a double first in Classics and Mathematics, subsequently in the year
1870 taking his M.A. degree. Sir Samuel’s great college chum was Charles Stuart
Mein, who was elevated in 1885 to the Bench of the Supreme Court of Queensland.
Sir Samuel returned to Queensland in 1863, and having chosen the profession of the
law, became articled to Mr. Macalister, then a leading solicitor in Brisbane, and
subsequently Premier and Agent-General for the Colony in London. In 1865,
while yet an articled clerk, he gained the Mort Travelling Fellowship from Sydney
University; and in fulfilment of the conditions of the foundation, he travelled to
Europe, studying with much profit the institutions of the Old World, and acquiring
a comprehensive view of the various social and political phenomena of life. Having-
completed his articles, Sir Samuel did not proceed with the profession of a solicitor,
but in October, 1867, joined the Queensland Bar, and speedily acquired a large
practice as a barrister. Nor is this a source of wonder, since Sir Samuel possesses
all those qualities which ensure pre-eminence in the legal profession—knowledge of
human nature, clearness of perception, facility of discrimination, and readiness of
speech, combined with a perfect acquaintance with the principles of Jurisprudence,
and an intimate familiarity with the Common Law. His faculties —analytical and
synthetical —are equally balanced, and accordingly he could, without faltering or
imperilling his client, present his case forcibly to the Bench. His abilities standing
in no need of the aid of oratory, or the assistance of verbosity, gained for him the
distinction of Queen’s Counsel in the year 1876. Not unlike many advocates of the
bar, Sir Samuel is also recognised as a politician of great worth, and as a statesman
of indisputable foresight —a very essential qualification for those who may be called
upon to take the helm of government. He first entered Parliament in March, 1872,
where he represented in the Legislative Assembly the electorate of East Moreton,
sustaining his previous reputation as a ready and powerful speaker. In that year he
succeeded in bringing to a close the Parliamentary deadlock which had continued for
months. In the same session he introduced and passed the Telegraph Messages
Act, which enables all legal process to be transmitted by telegraph, and which has


been adopted in South Australia. On the dissolution of Parliament in 1873 he was
elected for the newly-created seat of Oxley. In the session of 1874, being still a
private member, he introduced and succeeded in passing the Insolvency Act of 1874,
which is admittedly one of the best laws on the subject in force in Her Majesty’s
dominions. In August of that year he was appointed to the distinguished position of
Attorney-General in the Macalister Administration, and while holding that office
exhibited his accustomed skill in guiding the course of several measures in the
Legislative Assembly, amongst which was the State Education Act of 1875, which
embodies the principles of free, secular, and compulsory education. Upon this Act
coming into operation on Ist January, 1870, Sir Samuel was appointed the first
Secretary for Public Instruction, which office he held for three years, during which the
department was organised on a basis which has proved most satisfactory. In 1876,
Mr. Macalister having retired from the Premiership, Sir Samuel accepted under his
successor, the Hon. George Thorn, his former offices of Attorney-General and
Secretary for Public Instruction. During that year the Judicature Act was adopted,
as well as the Oaths Amendment Act, by which a declaration made in a court of
law should have the same validity as an oath.
In Mr. Douglas’s Administration, formed in February, 1877, on Mr. Thorn’s
retirement, Sir Samuel retained his former offices until the end of 1878, when he
accepted the office of Secretary for Public Works, Mr. J. F. Garrick succeeding him
as Attorney-General. The session of 1878 was signalised by Sir Samuel introducing
and passing a complete measure for Local Government, one of the most valuable
measures to be found on the statute books of the Australian colonies. Then followed
the usual appeal to the electorates, when Sir Samuel, who had by this time got well
to the front as a leading politician, was returned at the head of the poll for the
metropolitan constituency, the Hon. A. H. (now Sir Arthur) Palmer being second.
On the meeting of the new Parliament in January, 1879, the Douglas Administration
resigned, having been defeated by thirty-two votes to twenty on a vote of want ol
confidence moved by Mr. (now Sir Thomas) MTlwraith. Sir Samuel was then
chosen as leader of the Opposition. During his leadership of the Liberal minority
for the space of nearly five years he exercised the utmost vigilance in the interests
of the colony, omitting no opportunity of detecting and exposing every weak point
in the Government’s armour, as well as striving earnestly to, as Mr. Gladstone puts
it, “ elevate parliamentary manners,” so that the stigma of faction might not attach
to the Assembly.
Sir Samuel Griffith proceeded to England at his own expense to be present
at a meeting of a Commission appointed to inquire into certain alleged irregularities
in connection with contracts for the purchase ot steel rails lor the Government ol
Queensland. The facts elicited were mainly obtained by the cross-examination of
Sir Samuel, and, although the Commission finally exonerated the persons implicated,
public opinion since has rather been based upon the facts disclosed than upon the
formal conclusions of the Commission. It is now generally admitted that the action
of Sir Samuel in this matter has had a most salutary effect. In 1882 and 1883 Sir


Samuel buckled on all his armour to defeat two schemes formulated and developed
by the M‘llwraith Administration —one the Trans-Continental Land-Grant Railway,
the other a proposal to introduce coolie labour from British India for the sugai
plantations of Northern Queensland. So powerfully did he oppose these plans that
he caused the House to hesitate, and the country to reject them. Nothing remained
for Sir Thomas but to appeal to the constituencies, with the result that the decision
was against him. Sir Thomas, being defeated on some preliminary motions,
resigned without waiting for the discussion of the Governor’s speech; whereupon Sir
Samuel, who had been re-elected for North Brisbane by an immense majority, was,
in November, 1883, called on to form a Ministry. This he did, undertaking himself
the arduous offices of Premier, Colonial Secretary, and Secretary for Public
Instruction. At the convention of representatives of the Australasian Colonies, held
at Sydney in December, 1883, Sir Samuel was one of the representatives of
Queensland, when he gave still further evidence of his powers by the practical manner
in which he handled the important subjects considered by the Convention. The
resolutions which were adopted by the Convention were, to a large extent, drafted by
him, and it is understood that the Federal Council Bill was mainly the work of
his hand.
Agitation is at present proceeding for separation of the north part of
Queensland, which is generally believed to be the outcome of the labour difficulty,
although it may be that other causes have given a fillip to the movement. Besides the
many beneficial measures introduced and passed during Sir Samuel’s administration
there are several having reference to the domestic policy of the colony —all the
Defence Act, an admirable measure, making adequate provision for raising a
disciplined force for the defence of the colony; the Health Act; the Licensing Act,
which embodied a complete system of local option; and the Loan Act of 1884, which
authorises the construction of a comprehensive system of public works in all parts of
the colony.
The Russian scare of 1885 created an amount of fuss and bungling in
at least one of the colonies, which was happily unknown in Queensland, as the
provisions of the Defence Act then recently passed enabled the necessary steps
for the protection of the colony from foreign invasion to be taken quickly and
effectively. The land in almost every country is more or less a source of trouble
and anxiety to legislators. The Land Act introduced and passed by Sir Samuel’s
Government in 1884 —laid down on the lines of preserving the public estate to the
community, of encouraging the Crown tenants to improve their holdings, of securing
an adequate return to the State from its land, and of facilitating to the greatest
extent bond fide settlement, and discouraging the mere speculative acquisition of
land —answered all requirements.
In 1885, Sir Samuel resigned the Secretaryship for Public Instruction,
retaining the offices of Premier and Colonial Secretary. In 1886, he resigned the
latter office, assuming the newly-created office of Chief Secretary, to which
comparatively little departmental work is attached. At the meeting of the


Federal Council of Australasia, which began its sittings in Hobart on January 25,
1886, Sir Samuel proposed and Mr. Douglas seconded Mr. Service for the position
of President. At this council Sir Samuel took a prominent part. In moving
the adoption of the address in reply to Sir George Strachan’s opening speech
he said, “There were no more loyal subjects than the members of the Federal
Council; and instead of weakening the empire, the union of the colonies was more
likely to tend to the maintenance and consolidation of the empire; because
Australasia, being united, would he listened to when it spoke through the Federal
Council.” He pointed out the necessity of proceeding carefully, and doing nothing
that might have a deterrent effect on the colonies which were standing aloof from
joining the union. He touched briefly on the recidivistc question by advocating
a policy of vigilance.
Alluding to the Queensland separation movement, he said that there should
he a general expression of public opinion upon the labour question throughout
Australasia; and he considered it very undesirable that New Guinea should be
annexed to Queensland, although he had offered on behalf of Queensland to
undertake the supervision of its government. At the close of the sitting of the
Federal Council, Sir Samuel was appointed chairman of the Standing Committee
of the council. Amongst parliamentary orators, Sir Samuel would rank with the late
Mr. Koebuck of the House of Commons, who always spoke from the heart, being
first an Englishman and then a party man. Substituting colonist for Englishman,
we have a definition of Sir Samuel as a patriotic legislator, who at times has
electrified the House by speeches remarkable for close reasoning and lucid illustration.
His manner is unconstrained and devoid of the adventitious aid of affectation,
which so many employ to hide their defects. His utterance is quiet, and his
enunciation rapid and clear; at all times he has control of his voice, modulating it
at will, and causing it to act with the promptitude of a slave who carries out
the commands of his master. He is acknowledged to be a parliamentary tactician
of the first rank, and his skill in carrying measures in the face of determined
opposition has won for him the admiration, not only of his followers, but of his
opponents. His administrative capabilities are admitted to be unsurpassable, for
he can not only generalise but particularise, sifting to the bottom every detail,
nothing escaping his attention. It is said of Prince Bismarck by those who have
had the honour of his society, that he is all business in his office and all geniality in
his house. The simile may fittingly and respectfully be applied to the gentleman
whose merits have been so thoroughly appreciated that it pleased Her Gracious
Majesty, in July, 1886, to create him K.C.M.G.
In 1870, Sir Samuel married Julia Janet, third daughter of James Thomson,
Esq., of Maitland, New South Wales. True to his traditions as a Welshman, he
embalms his birthplace by naming his residence at Brisbane “Merthyr.” In
concluding this memoir, it may be remarked that the name of Griffith is one
of the most ancient in the Principality appearing throughout Welsh History. One
of them was the last King of Wales.


AR r r 11 u R GARX E R .
Mn* IRTHUR GARNER, of the firm of Messrs. Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove, was born in 1851, at Bath, Somersetshire, England, and is
r'ilfllil the eldest surviving son of the late Dr. Jonathan Garner, a well-known
physician in his time, a noted chess player, and an acknowledged authority on
the game.
The subject of this sketch is related on the maternal side to the late Sir
Richard Cobden, and was originally intended for the profession of an architect, and
received his education principally at the Hermitage School, Bath, then under the
direction of the founder, Mr. William Horner. This school was mainly composed
of youths intended for the profession of arms, and every half-year Sandhurst
and Woolwich received a batch of Arthur Garner’s schoolmates as embryo
Majors-General and Commanders-in-Chief, many of whom have since “bitten the
dust” in the service of their country during the disastrous wars of Zululand
and Afghanistan.
Upon completing his education in 1806, the future Australian theatrical
manager was articled for four years to Air. C. J. Phipps, then a struggling and
comparatively unknown provincial architect, but who has since achieved notoriety as
the designer of some thirty-five theatres in London and other parts of the United
Kingdom. It is a somewhat curious coincidence that on the day of his first
attendance at the office, the youthful Garner should have met for the first time the
artist —George Gordon—whose name is a household word amongst Australian
playgoers, and the following record will detail some interesting circumstances
in connection with the uninterrupted friendship that has existed between the scenic
artist and the actor-manager for more than twenty years.
The dull routine of an office life soon became distasteful to Mr. Garner. In
the early part of 1867, Phipps was commissioned to build the new Queen’s Theatre,
in Longacre, London, and the new theatre in Park Row, Bristol, both to be opened
in the following October. This necessitated the establishment of a London office,
and the removal of the master and his two senior articled pupils to the metropolis,
leaving our friend, at the age of sixteen, in sole charge of the Bath branch of the
business. This was too great a temptation for a youth only a few months set free
from the trammels of the school desk. [The office soon became the rendezvous
of the friends and companions of his schooldays, and boxing gloves, foils, and pipes
and tobacco, took the place of compasses, T squares, and other necessary implements
of the architectural profession. It was, of course, impossible that such a state of

Arthur Garner.




things could exist for any length of time—the crash came—the blow-up took place—
the articled pupil was suspended and his conduct investigated—a series of interviews
took place between the parent and the principal, and in the summer of 1868 we find
the pupil established as a boarder in the family of C. J. Phipps, F.S.A., and
apparently settled in the London office for the remainder of his articled term.
George Gordon, a provincial artist of some reputation, was then working as a
draughtsman in the same office, and the friendship then commenced between the tw r o
young men which has since proved so beneficial to both.
Things were not allowed to remain long in this smooth and easy-going state.
A most ludicrous incident occurred in connection with the commissariat department
of the Phipps’s family, and our young friend, taking advantage of the circumstances
to play a rather severe practical joke at the expense of his principals, was politely
requested to find board and lodging elsewhere. He then took up his quarters with
his friend George Gordon, sharing rooms in Liverpool Street, King’s Cross, but his
days in the architectural profession were numbered. The principal took no interest
in his pupil—the pupil evinced no respect for his principal, and could not refrain
from displaying it. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that in the first half of
1869, the articles were cancelled by mutual consent. He then followed the occupation
of a scene painter, and worked for some time with his friend Gordon, till October,
1870, when he made his debut as an actor in a minor part in Farnie’s burlesque, “The
Idle ’Prentice,” at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Liverpool. Here he remained for
some months making steady progress, and after fulfilling several provincial
engagements of varied importance, he set sail, in company with his young wife, for
Australia; and after an enjoyable passage of fifty-eight days in the old “Great Britain,”
arrived in Melbourne at the end of May, 1873, and made his first appearance at the
Theatre Pioyal, Melbourne (then under the management of Messrs. Harwood, Stewart,
Hennings and Coppin), four weeks afterwards, as “Frank Goldsworthy,” in Brough’s
comedy, “Kind to a Fault.” He remained in Australia till 1876, principally at the
Theatre Royal, Melbourne, where he became a great favourite, and received most
flattering criticisms of his performances from the local press. Returning to England,
success followed him, and after several profitable London and Provincial engagements
he returned to Australia in June, 1879, bringing with him the now historical
London Comedy Company, and his old friend George Gordon. The sensation
created by both actors and artist at the initiatory performance at the Opera House,
Melbourne, is within the recollection of most playgoers. A new era of the drama in
Australia had begun. The press unanimously rung out its praises, and hearty
congratulations were poured in on every side to the youthful manager. After a five
months’ season in Melbourne, the company proceeded to Adelaide, and the enthusiasm
created in the smaller city was even greater; but upon the appearance of the company
at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, in March, 1880, the climax was reached. The eulogy
of the press and public was unbounded, and for nine months without a break, high
class comedies were performed, giving pleasure to thousands, and bringing a fortune
to the management.


In July, 1881, Mr. Garner and his family sailed for California, and proceeded
on a holiday trip through the United States. In 1882, the firm of AYilliamson,
Garner and Musgrove, was established, and is undoubtedly at the present time the
largest theatrical enterprise in the world. The doings of this firm during the past
five years are too well known to need any comment here. The elegant new Princess s
Theatre, recently erected by this firm, at a cost of nearly fifty thousand pounds, is
not surpassed in artistic taste and convenience by any in Her Majesty’s dominions.
George Gordon is and has been the head of the scenic department ever since the
establishment of the firm, and often enjoys a hearty laugh in recounting to his
colonial friends the schoolboy pranks of his manager in bygone days. Mr. Garner
has been twice married, and resides with his young family in one of the fashionable
suburbs of Melbourne, where he loves to gather his friends round the festive board,
or indulge in a healthy game of tennis or skittles, or a friendly discussion on
the incline or the decline of the drama.


CAPTAIN JAMES McMEOKAN.
we judge of men by results, there are few amongst his compeers whose
lllill name carries more honour and commands more respect than does that of
the gentleman who for many years was the senior partner of the world-famed
shipping firm, Messrs. McMeckan, Blackwood and Co., of Melbourne. As one of
our objects in sketching these biographies is to pourtray character as an educating
factor, in order that the present and coming generations may know something of
the men who have been instrumental in founding and building up these magnificent
colonies, we have not, amidst all our liberal selection of material, one more
conspicuously suitable for the purpose than Captain James McMeckan. As an
exemplar of commercial enterprise and unchallengeable integrity, his name has been
more or less prominently before the world for the last half-century; and he who has
successfully carved, out of the raw material of honest labour, realistic images of
golden wealth, is afforded the comforting reflection of his declining years that the
records of his fame will live after him, and, we trust, be the means of encouraging
others who begin a struggling life in the colonies to go and do likewise.
It is needless to state that Captain James McMeckan is a Scotchman, and
one, too, of the practical, hard-headed, self-reliant type. A phrenologist would
probably say that such a man would scorn help from outside, unless he worked for
it in return, and that he would rather trust to the elastic circumstances of the world,
and what he could make of them, than be an unprofitable burden to anyone. His
father, James McMeckan, was a farmer in the north of Wigtonshire, Scotland,
where the McMeckans —who have owned a greater portion of the parish of
Kirkcolm for the last 300 years —still reside. But his son, the subject of this
sketch, having no liking for a bucolic life, was educated for the sea, a pursuit he
actively entered upon at the age of fourteen years. In the year 1829 he entered the
service of the celebrated shipping firm of Brocklebank and Robb, of London, joining
the ship “Waterloo,” Captain Addison, as an apprentice. Long before this, our
youthful James gave signs of the quality of the stuff of which he was made. Resolution,
a bold, adventurous spirit, and a determination to make headway, nerved him for
the conflict of the coming years. He had set his heart on being a sailor, but not a
conventional sailor —a fact which demonstrated itself in his farewell expression to
his mother, whose solicitude for her son’s welfare caused her to nervously oppose the
project, that before he returned to his own home he would be “captain of a ship.”
He kept his word, and thirteen years after, his maternal parent congratulated him on
his good fortune, adding that he was a “ lucky boy not to have met with an


accident.” Poor lady! ignorance was bliss with her. Little did she realise the
dangers and the hardships of a young sailor’s life on board a merchantman of those
days. Doubtless she thought of him as being comfortably “ rocked in the cradle of
the deep.” Assuredly she prayed that it should be so, and belief being strengthened
by the prayer, she regarded his safety and success as a direct answer to it. And
who shall say it was not so ? But if young McMeckan had a hard head, he possessed
a soft heart. He knew that a recital of even a tithe of what he had experienced
would disturb his mother’s mind unnecessarily, so he wisely kept to himself that
which was calculated to dim the pleasure of his return.
The good ship “Waterloo” sailed in February, 1829, from London,
under charter to the Government, with convicts sentenced to transportation
to Botany Bay. Young McMeckan was in charge of the commissariat
supplies of the convicts, and this afforded him an opportunity to observe the
character of that phase of criminal life. This cargo of condemned rascality
being safely landed, the “Waterloo ’’was re-chartered to convey a similar lot
of “ doubly-convicted ” felons from Sydney to Moreton Bay (of which Brisbane is
now the capital town), with the not unexpected episode of’ an incipient insurrection.
There were 280 men and 50 women on board, with a guard of 48 marines ; and
on the passage the convicts, relying on their superior numbers, attempted to
take possession of the ship; but though they did not succeed, much relief was
experienced when they were safely landed, and handed over to the tender mercies of
the Commandant of the Penal Establishment, Captain Logan, an old Peninsular
military disciplinarian. A tender-hearted man would never do for such places, and
the convicts knew that they had one to rule over them who would rigidly adhere to
the traditions of his class. Hence, disregard of authority was surely followed by
severe punishment, in which flogging held chief place. Of course, this only the more
brutalised the already brutal amongst the prisoners, whilst it failed as a deterrent.
Attempts to run away, sometimes successful, were most frequent. But it was out of
the pan into the fire with them. There were but few “free” settlers there at that
time, but they objected to escaped convicts being at large. The natives also had their
dislikes, and when they caught any of the escapees, they invariably stripped them of
their clothes, sending them off in an Adam-like state to shift for themselves. This,
in such a climate, augmented their punishment with a savage vengeance, for the
authorities issued clothing supplies to prisoners once in every three months only;
consequently, the poor wretches had to wait the usual time, no matter under what
circumstances they were dispossessed of their garments. Hence it was nothing
unusual for them to be exposed to the fierce rays of the sun for days and weeks
together, and in a state bordering on nudity: a practice extremely inhuman, causing
big scales to appear on the body, and giving them the appearance of an alligator.
A third charter from London to New South Wales, also with convicts, shipped
at Kingstown in Ireland, convinced young McMeckan that, so far, he had spent his
time in rather bad company; but by being brought into close contact with the
prisoners, he watched their “ innocent little ways” with a deep suspicion of distrust,
that undoubtedly sharpened and developed the characteristic canniness of his nature.


Alter leaving the “ Waterloo” Mr. McMeckan joined the ship “ Mangles,” under
command ot Captain Carr. At this time an incident occurred that would have altered
his career as a merchant sailor, but for the prompt assertion of his independent spirit.
A trivial dispute arose between the chief officer and himself; but, conscious of no
wrong, and still being blamed, he volunteered into the Royal Navy, joining the 24-gun
corvette “ Magicienne,” under Post-Captain Han way Plumridge. Three years in
Her Majesty’s service, however, did not afford him the gratification of his ambition.
No prospect of promotion offered, beyond the possibility of becoming a petty officer;
and, as he had conceived no very great affection for the navy, he returned to the
merchant service, rejoining his old ship “ Mangles,” at Captain Carr’s earnest
solicitation. On his first voyage to Lumbuck, one of the Malay Islands, for a cargo
of rice, the ship visited Murray Island in Torres Straits, where a large quantity of
tortoise-shell was secured by barter of “unconsidered trifles” with the natives —an
article which fetched 20s. a pound in the London market at that time. There is no
situation in life but hath its cares. Vicissitude and change are convertible terms for
progress and improvement, or the reverse, according as advantage is taken of
opportunity. Mr. McMeckan gave every satisfaction as a smart sailor, but he would
not stoop to be made a mere tool of. Captain Carr was desirous of placing his son
in the position of second officer in the “ Mangles,” and over the head of Mr.
McMeckan, who was to “ coach” his rival in his duties, but was to rank as third
officer with the pay of a second officer, Mr. Carr taking the empty title only.
This attempt at nepotism was indignantly declined, and Mr. McMeckan and
Captain Carr parted company, though accompanied by excellent testimonials from
the latter.
Mr. McMeckan’s first visit to the Port Phillip of those days was in the capacity
of chief officer on board the “Endora,” hailing from Hobart Town. This was in
the year 1836. Land selling had not begun, and the few settlers who had previously
arrived were encountering hard times—so hard, indeed, as to be unable to make the
proverbial “two ends meet.” The Williamstown of that time comprised “No houses
and one tent ” —a cheerful state of primitiveness truly ! Mr. W. J. T. Clarke, the late
Mr. Weir, Mr. Thornton, Mr. Watson, and other intending squatters were passengers.
Several horses were owned by the party, and an early start was made for the present
site of Melbourne. But the Saltwater Creek was an insurmountable obstacle; and
not caring to undertake experimental soundings without a pilot, they procured fodder
for the animals and made snug till next morning. With a little assistance and much
difficulty, Melbourne was at length reached, where only a few tents were to be seen.
The road, or rather the direction of the road, in those days was a little more difficult
to travel, but ccetcris paribus , not more unpleasant than now. “To be lost in the
bush ” between Sandridge and Melbourne has a smatter of early colonialism about it
that sounds strange to the traveller of to-day, who may have forgotten his own
experiences of bush life, or, on the other hand, never knew what bush life was. But
Mr. McMeckan and his friends had to rely on his knowledge of “Scotch navigation”
as to which way the land lay. However, the River Yarra was “ struck,” opposite to
the site of the present Custom House, and a friendly tent afforded to the weary


travellers tlie customary rough but kindly hospitality of tea and damper. The
proverb says that a “prophet is of no account in his own country.” An exception,
however, which proves the proverb’s truth, was made by one of the new arrivals, who,
while prospecting Flagstaff Hill on the following day, mounted a tree, and in
perorating an enthusiastic speech on the natural facilities and beauties around him,
predicted that in some time 50 years’ time, Port Phillip would he the grandest of the
Australian colonies. Five decades have come and gone since those words were
uttered, but it is not our province now to testify to their realisation. Something must be
left for the reader to decide. The native inhabitants were “wild” then, and as they were
“about,” the orator’s exultation was shortened by the sudden appearance of several
of them, causing the “white men” to beat a hasty retreat to the tents of their more
civilised friends.
Adelaide, or rather the Gulf of St. Vincent, King George’s Sound, and Swan
Eiver were in turn visited, but Captain McMeckan’s recollections of these places are
only pleasing in that they help to depict the contrast between the past and present
in deeper tints. The Adelaide of half a century ago was in its pre-adolescent stage.
The “establishment” of the colony by Act of Parliament, in the reign of William IV.,
had only occurred a year or two (1834) before the visit now recorded. But the
wilderness has been transformed, through the mighty agency of free-born men, into
the garden of the Sunny South. Much difficulty was experienced in obtaining
water, none being found nearer than the Torrens Elver; and even then it had to be
carted seven miles, and rolled through the mud in casks for another mile. Some
of Mr. McMeckan’s passengers went round with the ship to “ spy out the land,” but
they regretted having done so. At the Sound and Swan Eiver matters were no better,
while at the latter place the few settlers there were sadly in want of the
necessaries of life, and endeavoring to leave.
At the comparatively early age of 27 years, Mr. James McMeckan arrived at
the goal of his ambition, and redeemed the promise he made to his mother 13 years
before. In 1840 he succeeded to the command of his old ship, the “ Endora,” and
for the next ten years visited many parts of the world.
A sailor’s life, like many others, doubtless has its charms of novelty and
attractiveness ; whilst change of scene rarely fails to please and store the mind with
fruits of travel, that enlarge that field of instruction and knowledge. But it is only
human nature for one to desire a release from the incessant toil and anxiety for
others which a nomadic “ life on the ocean wave” entails. So it was with Captain
McMeckan. Probably with the prophecy of his friend uttered on Flagstaff Hill, many
years before, in his memory, or exercising its mystic though latent influence over
him, Melbourne was selected as the field of future operations on shore. Accordingly,
the year of grace 1852 saw the beginning of the (since gigantic and wealthy) firm of
McMeckan, Blackwood and Co. as general merchants, or, as Captain McMeckan more
modestly puts it, “in a general way.” Trade appellations were more easily definable
then than now. One of the chief factors in the arithmetic of success that attended
the firm was the strict line of demarcation that divided the duties of the partners.
With the instinct of early training, each member had his allotted task. Neither of


them usurped the function of the other. Thus a fair division of labour resulted in
freedom from clashing and inharmonious action, the presence of which so wrecks the
best hopes of business men. Captain McMeckan attended exclusively to that part of
the business which he knew most about—the shipping—whilst Mr. Blackwood
conducted the remainder. The extensive carrying trade in which they were engaged,
of which wheat and flour formed large items, necessitated the possession of “ bottoms”
of their own; and in this connection the senior partner’s nautical experience proved
invaluable, in laying the foundation of a large water-borne communication with
Adelaide and other ports.
The laying of the Port Darwin cable was a matter of national importance with
which Messrs. McMeckan, Blackwood and Co. were largely identified, their steamer
“ Omeo” being the pioneer boat carrying a large number of men and horses. The
successful result of this cable is well-known, and redounds much to the credit of the
sister colony of South Australia. The goldfields of New Zealand also found this
cosmopolitan firm keenly alive to the requirements of the public, and, of course, its
own interests as well. The initial attempt was made by despatching the steamer
“Oscar” to Dunedin on the 20th August, 1861. The almost instantaneous
submarine method of communication between the colonies which we possess at the
present day was unknown then, therefore the tedium of delay had to be somewhat
impatiently borne until course of post; but when it was known that the “ Oscar” on
her return to Melbourne was the bearer of a large quantity of gold, the product
of successful diggers, so great a demand was made for passenger accommodation that
several additional steamers were laid on to meet the requirements of the rush. This
was another starting point—an additional means which gave an enormous fillip to the
commercial notoriety of the firm, and established one more branch of their already
extensive intercolonial trade. What old traveller by sea does not look back with
feelings of pleasurable recollection to the “ good old times ” of sea-boat voyaging,
when the “ Omeo, ” “ Aldinga,” “ Claude Hamilton,” “ Gothenberg,” “ Alhambra,”
and others made the running from port to port, if not “fast and furious,” at least
accompanied by a kind of social “ order of disorder ” fraught with agreeable
reminiscences of a by-past freedom as between passengers and officers, which the
sterner regulations of later companies have (possibly judiciously) removed ?
It is only necessary now to add that the firm continued increasing its sphere
of operations till 1878, when, after 26 years in the “ public service,” the shipping
business was closed, and the fleet dispersed between that phenomenally successful
combination of capitalists—the Union Company of New Zealand, and the Adelaide
and Mount Gambier Companies—Captain McMeckan retaining large shareholding
interests in the two former. The latter is now defunct, and, as he says, no wonder,
for his own maritime predilections could not comprehend the anomaly of a shipping
company having its steering apparatus placed on the top of a hill! The head-quarters
of the company were at Mount Gambier, whence its name.
Though not a political man in even a limited sense, Captain McMeckan was a
representative man in each capacity he filled. He is one amongst a number (of
whom several remain) of the thoroughly practical school of seamen—men who, in the


earlier clays of the colony, before the luxury of yellow bands and uniforms was known,
were as much “at home” in the engine room as on the “ bridge men who lived and
moved among their passengers, winning their regard from personal contact and the
possession of inherent qualities which, in these latter days of a necessary though
severe discipline, command little more than cold respect. We do not imply that the
marine service has suffered thereby. Our duty is rather to chronicle facts than
institute comparisons. But there is no doubt that the personal popularity of
steamship captains is much less now than formerly, and the affection with which
they were once regarded is necessarily decreasing in the ratio of their enforced
seclusion from the common pleasures and social pastimes of those committed to their
care. As on the sea, so on the shore, Captain McMeckan has upheld his representative
character. In this truly he had an able coadjutor in his partner, Mr, J. H.
Blackwood, and the plougher and the sower alike are entitled to the profits of the
harvest. Captain McMeckan had his opportunity to be representative in other
directions, but the undeviating principle that held him to his business prevented him
from engaging in any other pursuit to the detriment of the former, and which he
conscientiously thought he could not satisfactorily perform without loss to either or
both. Some may accuse such a man of want of patriotism, but of them a tu quoque
enquiry maybe made—What is patriotism ? Where are our patriots ? Nor can it be
said that Captain McMeckan inclined to idleness. He refused many offers of public
positions which he might have held with honour, principally from an infirmity of
deafness, and that he felt he could not serve two masters successfully; and when the
time came for a disconnection from the more active business of his life, he naturally
felt a disinclination to enter into party strife (from which he had been so long free),
leaving that to younger and more ambitious spirits.
Captain McMeckan never married, and is now enjoying the evening repose of
his well-spent years in single blessedness; but, retaining all his faculties clear and
unclouded, he has not subsided into a “ masterly inactivity.” From his princely
house at “ Corsewall,” Hawthorn, he directs the operations of his station properties
in Riverina, New South Wales, and Charlton, Victoria. An extensive correspondence
with England also necessitates that the mental lamp should be kept brightly burning.
Captain McMeckan recognises that “ order is Heaven’s first law,” and it is to the
strict observance of a methodical system, and a scrupulous punctiliousness in all
matters, great and small, that may be ascribed a large measure of his successes.
Naturally of an active, sanguine temperament, he dislikes having done by deputy that
which he can do for himself; therefore,
A man lie seems of cheerful yesterdays and confident to-morrows.
Bacon says : —“ I hold every man a debtor to his profession ; from the which,
as men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit, so ought they of duty to
endeavour themselves, by way of amends, to be a help and ornament thereto.” Of
such have been the life and guiding principles of Captain James McMeckan ; and he
may well, at the end of an industrious career, exclaim also with that author :—“ My
name and memory I leave to men’s charitable speeches.”


HENRY BURROWS.
shall venture to predict the extent of Victorian advancement, or to
SSmSltiii es thnate the magnitude of the resources which science and industry will
combine to develop during the next decades ? The two great factors of
wealth in any country—agriculture and manufactures—must be combined to achieve
the greatest possibilities. Working in unison, they offer illimitable opportunities
for enterprise, and stimulate the business man to renewed -exertions, that he may
keep pace with the magnitude and importance of the markets whose demands he is
called upon to supply.
From the first permanent settlement made in this colony in 1834 by Mr.
Edward Henty down to the present moment, the wonderful development has been
primarily due, not to the magnitude of its territory or exceptional advantages, but to
the untiring industry and invincible enterprise of her leading men. Cities have been
built, towns and villages founded, harbours constructed, railways established, and all
the complex appliances of modern civilisation brought to bear upon the solitudes,
which fifty years since were the haunts of a few scattered aborigines. In the incessant
battle for advancement, few men have played a more active part than the subject of
this sketch, Mr. Henry Burrows. Every industry which contributes to the employment
of the operative masses must raise the social scale of the workers, who in time become
employers of labour themselves. A hopeful and prosperous career is thus not only
opened to the emigrant but to his children. Such men as Mr. Burrows make
room for all, opening the opportunity for men with brains, who by the practice of
industry, sobriety, frugality and perseverance, are certain to rise in life and materially
assist in making Victoria the premier Australian colony.
The subject of this sketch, the present head of the firm of Dillon, Burrows and
Co., was horn in the island of Jersey, and arrived in Victoria in 1851. He was naturally
attracted to the goldfields, where he experienced all the vicissitudes which fell to the
lot of the early pioneers who attempted to wrest fortune from the bowels of the
earth. Mr. Burrows was moderately successful on the fields, but the natural bent of
his mind was in the direction of manufacturing and commercial pursuits. He was
one of the few who clearly foresaw the wonderful development which was to follow
the impetus given to all branches of business by the influx of tens of thousands of
gold-seekers. Pieturning to Melbourne in 1853, he commenced business in Victoria
Street, but subsequently became a member of the firm of Dillon and Barfoot,
commencing manufacturing in Brunswick. Mr. Barfoot retired, and the firm, finding
their business constantly expanding, removed to Latrobe Street West, Melbourne.
To meet the demands of their customers, the works of the Excelsior Company, owned
by Messrs. Wittingham Bros., were purchased, and the foundation of an immense
business laid. In 1878 Mr. Dillon died, when his only son, Mr. W. H. Dillon, became


a member of the firm. The next important step was the purchase of the business
carried on by Mr. Walter Lucas. Orders accumulated so rapidly that Mr. A. K.
Warden and Mr. G. H. Burrows were admitted as partners, and a far-seeing venture was
carried out successfully by the purchase of the factory, plant, and trade of the only
great rival, namely, the Victorian Confectionery Company, at Prince’s Bridge. The
rate at which the business has grown is most clearly indicated by a survey of their
factories. A glance at their premises will convey to the intelligent mind the idea
that the operations conducted within their walls must be large indeed, and compare
favourably with the largest manufactories engaged in the same business in America or
in England. The public will be surprised to learn that in wages alone the annual
outlay exceeds £ 12,000, the number of employes varying from 250 to 300, while forty
tons of sugar are used weekly, exclusive of gums, almonds and dried fruits. Such
facts not only demonstrate the commercial capacity of the head of the house of
Dillon, Burrows and Co., but they furnish incontrovertible evidence that Melbourne
is rapidly extending her commercial supremacy through the enterprise of her
public-spirited men. The facility and ease with which large financial transactions are
consummated speaks volumes for the ability of the men who have created her vast
warehouses and manufactories. Her proudest aim is to become the mart of the
Australasian colonies. During the present year, Mr. Burrows was appointed one of
the Commissioners for Victoria for the Indian and Colonial Exhibition, and proceeded
to London, where he took a leading part in that gathering, which must prove a
forerunner of the federation of the Empire, thus joining the children to the parent in
an indissoluble tie. The especial fitness of Mr. Burrows for the task assigned was
promptly recognised by the Victorian people, who placed implicit confidence in his
judgment and ability. Certain it is that the Australian colonies must be especially
benefited by their leading men coming in contact with English statesmen, who will
thus be enabled to obtain a correct and faithful picture of colonial greatness, which
will shadow forth future prospects, furnishing a dim fore-cast of the enormous strides
which Australia is bound to make in the near future. Personal contact is more
potent than the most eloquent words ; it reveals the unnoticed, pictures the possible,
convinces the doubting, and marshals an array of economic facts which brings
conviction. In the future, the mother country must more fully appreciate the
advantages which will accrue from a reciprocity of benefits, and we may hope
that the multiplication of the ties arising out of mutual intercourse and the influence
of a common interest will prolong such profitable relations. The life of Mr.
Burrows demonstrates that the stern realities of life develop latent powers, and in
these colonies tend to produce self-made men, who introduce into all their
undertakings a perseverance and energy which is invaluable. This produces a
healthy emulation, which contributes in a very large degree to the moral, the social,
and the national welfare of the people.
That the success which has heretofore crowned his efforts has only served to
stimulate his activity is evinced by the fact that, during his visit to London, he has
made extensive purchases of machinery for starting a new factory in Sydney, which
will rival in magnitude those already established in Melbourne.


JAMES FARRELL,
son of Brian Farrell, was born in the year 1829 at Clonclara,
County Longford, Ireland, receiving his education at the school of Mr.
C. Creed, in the town of Longford. In 1846 he was placed with Mr.
John Ennis, of Dublin, as clerk, in whose employment he subsequently rose to
be manager. Attracted by the successes achieved by the gold-diggers in Australia,
he decided to try his fortune amongst them. Landing in Melbourne in November,
1853, he proceeded to Forest Creek (Castlemaine), then in its palmiest days, having
for his mate a fellow-passenger from home named Edward Shaw, a sterling man
and honest friend. The result of six months’ rough work did not satisfy his
expectations, although it would be considered a good one now. Employment was
both abundant and remunerative, sufficiently so to satisfy the most exigeant;
consequently, he did not remain idle, while maturing plans on which to stait a
business of his own. How fickle Fortune is in the bestowal of her favours ! No
sooner had our plucky young colonist “cut the painter, so to speak, from the
Old World, than he received an offer to return to it. This was from Mi. Ennis
(his former employer), who offered him his business on most favourable terms,
but not quite attractive enough to tempt a withdrawal from the adopted land that
he had already learned to love so well. No alternative remained but to decline
the generous proposal of his friend, with a grateful acknowledgment of its worth.
Of the early diggers, Mr. Farrell adds his testimony to otheis, in that the}
were the right sort of people to pioneer and help to form a colony. Imbued
with a spirit of fair play to all, they permitted no racial, or political, oi religious
antipathies to intrude themselves, and that they have done something to extend
“ the bounds of Freedom ” is evidenced in the statutes of Victoria. Most men have
read of palaces of gold, and Mr. Farrell can boast of having once possessed an edifice
built of auriferous bricks. In 1855 he became proprietor of the Commercial Hotel
in Castlemaine, but the decadence of that town necessitated its demolition. It was
proposed to “crush” the bricks to obtain the gold they contained, but they were
removed in gloho to distant parts. On quitting with his interest in this property,
Mr. Farrell turned his attention to Queensland, but a residence of six months there
satisfied him that Victoria was superior as a field of investment, to say nothing of its
more agreeable surroundings. He therefore returned to this colony, and, in 1864-5,
was elected Mayor of Castlemaine. The records of that time, and those of his
compatriots, are witnesses of the public spirit Mr. Farrell displayed m municipal
affairs in aiding the development of the mines, and generally promoting the welfare


of the district. Political feeling ran high at this time, through the rejection of the
Tariff and the Appropriation-cmn-Tariff Bills by the Legislative Council. One of the
Castlemaine members of the Legislative Assembly, Mr. T. Carpenter, an ardent
Freetrader, fell into disfavour with his constituents, whereupon a requisition was
made to Mr. Farrell in 18G6 to stand for election, his political creed having found
acceptance with a constituency, many of whom had been at home during the
stirring times of 1848, amongst the Chartists in England, or amongst the Repealers
in Ireland. It may be here stated that Mr. Farrell’s politics were in accord
with those of the bulk of his countrymen in their desire to obtain a Repeal of the
Union. In the colony he advocated an advanced Liberal policy, the right of the
Legislative Assembly to control finance, and the imposition of protective duties.
The usual excitement prevailed at the pre-election meetings, which were largely
attended by the miners (the term “digger” was changed to that of miner about
1860), who, as a rule, favoured the Freetrade Shibboleth of the party they
sympathised with in the old country years before. They have since seen the errors
of their faith, for they were early converts to the policy of the majority in the
Assembly. Mr. Farrell was returned, with two other Ministerialists, the general
elections giving Ministers fifty-eight supporters in a House of seventy-eight
members. He supported the tariff including the repeal of the export duty on gold—
the question on which an appeal had been made to the country—and which now
passed the Assembly by a large majority. The Legislative Council having rejected
a Supply Bill and the Tariff Bill, Ministers resigned, and Mr. Fellowes stated his
ability to form a Government on the condition that a dissolution should be granted
in the event of certain contingencies arising. This the Governor refused,
Mr. McCulloch was recalled, and Parliament prorogued to the sth April. A
conference was held between [the Houses, and the Supply Bill passed with some
trifling alterations, thus ending a dead-lock which had continued for nine months.
The recall of Sir C. Darling was announced on the 27th April, 1866, and caused
intense excitement. The Legislative Assembly presented him with an address, expressive
of its admiration of his steadfast adherence to constitutional principles, and passed
a vote of <£20,000 to Lady Darling. Crowded meetings were held in the principal
towns of the colony, at which resolutions were carried approving of the actions
of His Excellency. Mr. Farrell held the position of whip from 1867 to 1869,
excepting the two months the Sladen Ministry were in office. The duties of that
functionary then were something more than “ making a house, keeping a house, and
cheering the Ministry; ” for, beyond what may be termed constitutional usage,
the whip had to try to secure the return of the ministerial candidate whenever an
election took place, and to be acquainted with any political movement in the
constituencies, so as to take such action as would best serve the interests of
his party.
The session of 1867 was remarkable for an effort to secure payment to
members, by an amendment on the Address in Reply; an attempt to upset the
Border Customs Treaty; the failure of the Quieting of Titles Bill; some questions


of privilege, and the rejection by the Council of the Appropriation Bill, owing
to the inclusion of the T20,000 vote to Lady Darling. Parliament was dissolved in
December of that year, in order that the constituencies might express their opinions
on the policy of the Darling Grant. At the ensuing election for Castlemaine
in February, 1868, Mr. Farrell was placed at the head of the poll, his colleagues in
the late Parliament being also elected. At this juncture the Governor received
instructions from the Secretary of State to send down the Message for the vote
to Lady Darling, and if the Bill containing that vote were rejected by the Council, he
was not to send the Message down a second time. Upon this the Government
resigned on the eve of the assembling of Parliament, notwithstanding the large majority
at their back. Mr. Sladen then undertook the task of forming a Ministry. During
the numerous adjournments that took place pending such formation, a question
as to the right of the House to proceed to business, before being formally opened by
the Crown, was decided by the Speaker in the negative.
A somewhat similar circumstance arose when, in 1880, Mr. Berry was
returned with a majority supporting him. Determined not to allow his opponents
time to demoralise his followers, he led them into action at once, by submitting
a motion that Ministers did not possess the confidence of Parliament. This was
carried before the Governor’s speech was delivered, and in the amendment carried
on the address, the Governor was informed of the fact. His Excellency rebuked the
Assembly, stating that Parliament was not in a position to consider questions
of public policy until it had been formally opened, and the Crown had declared
the reasons for which it had assembled. Yet precedents can be found for the course
taken by Mr. Berry. On the 25th July, 1667, the Speaker informed the House that
His Majesty had deferred his coming to acquaint them with what he had to
say till Monday next, and that the House should adjourn till that day,
when it was resolved —nemine contradicente —“ That His Majesty be humbly desired
that when a peace is concluded the new raised forces be disbanded.” Here
was important business transacted before the King’s speech was delivered, and after
the King had sent word to the House to adjourn—that is, not to proceed with
business that day. From this it would appear that the Legislative Assembly
can proceed to business on the day on which it is summoned for the despatch of
business, and before the Governor’s speech is delivered, if it deems it advisable
to do so.
Owing to an adverse vote on going into Committee of Supply, the Sladen
Ministry resigned, and was succeeded by the McCulloch Administration. During
the session of 1869, great dissatisfaction was evinced by Ministerial supporters
at the appointment of Mr. G. Rolfe as a Minister of the Crown, because he had not a
seat in either House. A motion condemnatory of this proceeding was submitted
by Mr. Pi. Byrne, and supported by Mr. Farrell; but this so much displeased his
constituents that a petition signed by a thousand of the Castlemaine electors was
presented to him, calling on him to resign. This Mr. Farrell declined to do, and
so far justified his vote that at the next election he was triumphantly returned to


his old seat, showing that his constituency, as a whole, approved his action,
although a section of it did not.
Mr. McPherson succeeded, after some trouble, in forming a Ministry, but
a suspicion got abroad that favoritism was to be shown to the pastoral tenants
in connection with the public lands, and Mr. Farrell joined in voting against the
Government, although it would have the effect of once more placing Mr. McCulloch
at the head of affairs. Mr. McPherson was selected to fill the Lands Poitfolio
in the new Ministry, which gave his old colleagues much umbrage, and they openly
accused him of having had “an understanding” with the leader of the old Opposition
on the subject. The “Earth Hunger” and the “Payment of Members questions
engaged the attention of the House, and the latter having become law, caused a large
number of candidates to come forward at the general election of 1871. Ten
competed for the three Castlemaine seats, but although most of them were local men,
Mr. Farrell was re-elected. Party lines in the new Assembly were less clearly defined
than in the previous Parliaments of 1865-8. But change of politics was moie
noticeable in the Ministry than in the rank and file of the Liberal Party. Mr.
McCulloch, who sought democratic aid to assist him in defeating the Legislative
Council in its attempts to disturb the financial measures of the Government,
now showed a desire to wean himself from his more democratic colleagues. The
Property Tax proposals caused the defeat of the McCulloch Ministry on the 15th
June by a majority of two to one, Mr. Farrell voting with the majority. Mr.
Farrell became whip to the succeeding Huffy Government. During this session,
which lasted from the 25th April to the 23rd November, a Tariff, imposing 20 per
cent, duty on certain articles, was passed. During the ensuing recess, the Ministry
were banqueted at many provincial towns, with evidences of much satisfaction at
their political conduct, and at no place with more enthusiasm than at Maryborough;
but in order to show the unreliableness of such demonstrations as indications of
public opinion, when Mr. Gillies, who assisted to oust the Duffy Ministry, a few
weeks after contested that district, consequent on taking office, he was re-elected by
the very constituency that had so recently done honor to his opponents.
During the existence of the Francis Ministry, 1872-3, some practical
measures were passed, but the Electoral Bill was rejected by the Council, whereupon
the Premier introduced his Norwegian scheme, which Mr. Farrell supported, not
because it was the best, but because it would be a means of settling disputes
between the two Chambers. In June, 1874, Mr. Farrell undertook the duties
of whip to this Government also, as there was no difference in their political
views at that period. In addition to the usual understanding between the
Ministry and the whip, Mr. Farrell made a certain agreement with the Premier,
quite unconnected with that office, but its fulfilment was subsequently evaded on a
hollow pretence. The Norwegian Bill being defeated on the 21st July, Mr. Francis
resigned, but the Ministry was reconstructed, with Mr. Kerferd as Premier, who, in
turn, was defeated on his financial proposals in July, 1875. After the Ministerial
elections, the House met again in September following, Mr. Berry having assumed


the reins of office. His Budget included the historic Land Tax proposals, which
were rejected on an amendment by Sir J. McCulloch, after an eight nights’
debate, Mr. Farrell voting for the imposition of the tax. The Acting Governor,
Sir William Stawell, refused a dissolution, which so exasperated Mr. Berry that
he determined to arouse the country to a sense of the political situation. A
“stumping” campaign was resolved on, and the political bread thus cast upon
the electoral waters returned after many days at the 1877 elections. Early in
1876 the celebrated “ stone-walling ” tactics were resorted to, so that Sir J.
McCulloch’s taxing proposals should not become law, and in hope of forcing on a
dissolution. It was during these debates that Sir Jas. McCulloch’s “ gag” or “iron
hand ” standing order was introduced, giving power to the House to resolve, after
a resolution had been proposed by a member —“ That the motion be now put.”
The debate on this proposed new order arrested the progress of business, and,
after a protracted sitting of the House from 5 p.m. on the Bth February to 11 p.m.
on the 10th, it was carried on a division by 41 to 20, Mr. Farrell voting with
the Noes. On the 23rd March the Government withdrew the Land, Property, and
Income Tax Bill, there being a majority of three only for the second reading. In
the following Session of 1876 an amending Electoral Act was passed, increasing the
number of members from seventy-eight to eighty-six, but taking one from Castlemaine,
notwithstanding which Mr. Farrell was returned for the fifth time in twelve years.
In the new House he was a candidate for the Chairmanship of Committees, but
meeting with a serious accident whilst driving, he was incapacitated from sustaining
the nomination, and taking part in public affairs for some time. Mr. Farrell now
sought an appointment in the Public Service, but, at the earnest solicitation of Mr.
Berry, he consented to act as whip for the remainder of the Session, and then
resign his seat, which he did on the following 23rd May.
During his parliamentary career, Mr. Farrell supported the Tariff of 1866,
which afforded “incidental” protection; the right of the Legislative Assembly to the
exclusive control of finance; the Darling grant; an extension of the area of
land which a selector may take up to 640 acres; Payment of Members, the 20
per cent, duties in the Tariff of 1871, the Norwegian Scheme, the Land Tax proposals
of Mr. Berry in 1875, and the Land Tax Act of 1877.
The statement persistently made at the time, that he resigned in order to
provide a seat for Professor Pearson, was totally unfounded. It was only on the
22nd of May, when Mr. Berry no longer objected to his resignation being sent in,
that the question of who was to succeed him in the seat for Castlemaine arose.
Mr. Berry favoured a gentleman who had been in Parliament, but Mr. Patterson, one
of the members for Castlemaine, objected to him, and suggested that Professor
Pearson should be asked to contest the seat. This being done, Professor Pearson
signified his willingness to become a candidate, and was elected. Had Mr. Patterson
not objected, the ministerial support would have been given to the gentleman
named by Mr. Berry, instead of to Professor Pearson. On the Ist January, 1879,
Mr. Farrell was appointed Parliamentary Librarian, because of his special fitness and


possession of exceptional experience in Parliamentary Literature, gathered during
the many years he was a Member of Parliament. No sooner was it announced that
he had been appointed Librarian than his qualifications for the post were assailed
with great bitterness by a section of the press. The attack was renewed when
the Berry Ministry was defeated in March, 1880, and, in consequence, Mr. Farrell’s
services were dispensed with by the Service Ministry, on the 30th June, 1880.
Another dissolution and general election having taken place in July, at which Mr.
Berry again had a majority, he reinstated Mr, Farrell as Librarian. When the vote
for the salary of the Librarian came on for discussion, the Opposition fell on
Mr. Farrell with much rancour. They supported an amendment to strike out the
vote, when a long, acrimonious, and personal debate followed; but a large majority
being against them, they withdrew the amendment and the vote was passed.
Admitting that those opposed to Mr. Farrell being appointed Librarian did “ nought
in hate, but all in honour,” there were others who could not see that a sum of
<£7s, the amount of compensation to which he was entitled, under the Act No. 160,
was a satisfactory equivalent for having given up a seat in Parliament and T7OO
a year; the latter amount consisting of T3OO honorarium as a Member of
Parliament, and T4OO allowance as whip.
Mr. Farrell ultimately had the satisfaction of knowing that the Assembly did
not consider the proposed method of dealing with him a just one, and refused to
sanction it.
Justice requires us to add that, under Mr. Farrell’s rule, the conspicuous
completeness of the Parliamentary Library amply testifies to his fitness for the post.
Mr. Farrell married Mary, daughter of Mr. Thomas Keogh, of Talbot
Lodge, Kiltegan, County Wicklow, the only issue of their marriage being a
daughter, Mary, who died in 1859.




Troedel&C-Lllho.
Robert Simson JPexMLC.


EGBERT SIMSOIST, EX-M.L.C,
such names as the one that heads this biography, when perseverance and
6nergy were 1G Actors in developing one of the richest and most
productive resources of Australia, must we attribute the fact that
Melbourne ranks as the principal wool mart of Australia. To men like Mr. Robert
Simson must the honor be paid for the present commercial prosperity of the colony,
which prosperity has been principally the outcome of the development of the pastoral
interests ot the country. With a strong love tor animal life, Mr. Simson’s pursuits
facilitated his devoting entire attention to the breeding of high-class stock, and the
prizes that have hitherto fallen to his share, both for sheep and exhibits of wool, have
been deservedly won.
Born at Coalfarm in Fifeshire, Scotland, on the 4th October, 1819, he, at the
age of 23, decided to woo fortune in the newly colonised continent of Australia, and to
that end departed for Tasmania, arriving in Hobart in November, 1842. Tasmania
offering no inducements for any lengthened stay, Mr. Simson crossed over to Port
Phillip in February, 1843, and in April of that year purchased, in conjunction with
Mr. Philip Russell, who accompanied him from Scotland, the station known as
Carngham, in the Western district of Victoria. In December, 1847, he revisited
England, returning to Carngham in 1850. In 1851 Mr. Simson revisited Tasmania,
and there, in April of that year, married Catherine, the second daughter of Dr. Officer,
returning immediately after to Carngham, where he remained till April, 1853, when
the partnership with Mr. Russell was dissolved. In July of that year Mr. Simson
purchased Langi Ival Ival, an adjoining station, from Mr. W. B. Hamilton, which he
still possesses, and which has since been converted into a freehold, where he devoted
himself to the breeding of high-class merino sheep. His success as a breeder is
attested by his having on several occasions secured Champion Prizes for rams and
ewes at Skipton, Ballarat and Melbourne, and by his having obtained several medals
and diplomas for his exhibits of wool in various parts of the world.
In 1861 Mr. Simson again visited England in company with Mrs. Simson, and
made a tour through the continent, returning to Langi Kal Kal in 1863, where he
remained until January, 1865. About this time, the magnificent property now known
as “ Leura” in Toorak having been offered to him by Mr. James Murphy, the owner,
Mr. Simson purchased it, and took up his residence there, improving and beautifying
the extensive grounds, and in other ways adding to the value of the property by
building a new house, which certainly cannot be surpassed for the grand view it
commands of the Bay and surrounding country.
In October, 1868, a vacancy having occurred for the representation of one of
the seats for the Western Province in the Legislative Council, Mr. Simson offered
himself as a candidate, and was returned without opposition, He held this seat for


ten years, when he retired through effluxion of time. He offered himself to the
constituency, and was opposed by Mr. William Ross, of “ The Gums. Some time prior
to the polling day, Mr. Simson was suddenly struck down with illness, and was in
consequence prevented from visiting the electorate, when, acting on the representation
of his medical adviser and the requests of his immediate friends, he retired from
the contest.
On the death of the Honourable Neil Black on the 14th May, 1880, one of the
representatives in the Council for the Western Province, Mr. Simson again became a
candidate, and addressed the electors at Ararat, Hamilton, Portland, Belfast, Koroit,
Warrnambool, Mortlake, Terang, and Camperdown. In all parts of the extensive
Province he met with a hearty welcome, and was returned to the House unopposed.
Throughout his political career he evinced a desire for a reform of the Upper
House by the extension of the basis of representation, an increase in the number ol
members, and a shortening of the term of office. He was bitterly opposed to the
Council being made a mere “ registration office ” for the Assembly. He alwa}S gave
it as his opinion that the electors of the Legislative Council had not only a gieat
stake in the country, but also an important responsibility in moulding its destinies.
The shallow opinion then prevailing that the Council was a body lemoved from
control had no convert in him, for he expressed the opinion that the eloctois had the
dealing with at least one-fifth part of the whole body periodically, and they
availed themselves largely of their powers, inasmuch as a large proportion ol ne\\
members were chosen at the elections to serve them in the Council. He favoured
the extension of railways in such directions as were likely to prove remunerative and
to advance the general prosperity of the colony. He advocated mining on pm ate
property, and supported the Bill that was passed in the Council in 1878. Mi. Simson
is a Freetrader by conviction, but as the bias was in favour of Protection, he warned
his constituents that they were bound to learn the error of their ways by obsei\ing
how heavily the mining and agricultural interests in Victoria were handicapped undei
existing circumstances, as compared with those in the neighbouring colonies. The
payment of members found no favour with him. During his tenure of office Mi.
Simson identified himself with the Coroners Statute Amendment Bill, the Local
Government Act Amendment Bill ? the Land Laws Amendment Bill, the Municipal
Corporations Law Amendment Bill, and the Education Bill.
On the expiry of the term for which Mr. Simson was elected in 1880, he, on
the 30th November,' 1882, at the urgent solicitations of friends and the representation
of his medical advisers, decided to withdraw from political life, and the Western
District was thereby deprived of a conscientious, painstaking and honourable
representative. He was on three different occasions elected Piesidentof the National
Agricultural Society of Melbourne, and also occupied the liesident s chair for two
different years in the Sheep Breeders’ Association of Melbourne; he was once elected
President of the Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria, and is still a
member of all these societies. He is a trustee of the Melbourne Scotch College, ot
the Melbourne Scots’ Church, and of the Asylum and School for the Blind.


G. W. GRIFFIN, UNITED STATES CONSUL, SYDNEY.
“ The heights by great men reached and kept
Were not obtained by sudden flight,
But they, while their companions slept,
Were toiling upward in the night.”
|| N “ Cnlture and An archy” Matthew Arnold strongly insists on the necessity
111 °f two virtues—“ Sweetness and Light”—receiving the utmost cultivation,
assault made by the Philistines, and, whilst preserving the stronghold from serious
injury (save that, at very long intervals, an unsuccessful fusilade must be encountered),
they may, from time to time, send forth their emissaries on a literary pilgrimage
through the wilderness of bitterness and dark. There always has been, and,
doubtless, there always will be, such a wilderness, and it therefore follows that
these emissaries must act as heralds proclaiming the day of the shining of
“ Sweetness and Light” unto the people, of their hardships in a dry and barren
land, the mode of their reception, the efficacy of the cures they shall accomplish,
the means necessary to enter into the glories of a literary paradise, the scepticism
they shall encounter, the persecutions they shall undergo, their death and burial for
a brief period, and their final triumph, by the establishment of a Literary Republic
on earth. Such in detail may be the dream treasured up by that accomplished
gentleman, whose enthusiastic views are frequently challenged, but who,
nevertheless, has many followers, not, perhaps, prepared to go so far, although
willing to admit the beneficent effects of “ Sweetness and Light.” It is no
uncommon thing to hear clap-trappers decry men of “ belles-lettres ,” on the ground
that they are not practical—mere visionaries, suffering from the effects of a diseased
imagination, and that they only see men through books ; but, granting such to be
the case, when it is pointed out that the most practical and greatest of all men is
chiefly seen through a book—the Bible —their statement has the stability of a house
of cards, and is a mirage on the ocean of their ice-bound prejudices. Rather may
it be said that literary men are the most practical, their “ Sweetness and Light ”
having, in many cases, accomplished what the sword has failed to effect.
To what can be attributed the present friendly relations existing between the
United States and England ? relations which were, unhappily, not much more than
a decade ago, very strained. Has it been owing to transactions in commerce? No ;
commerce may be a slightly civilising, but certainly not a conciliatory agent. Bid
it arise out of the historic Geneva award ? No ; money may purchase a temporary
acquiescence but not an enduring amity. To what, then ? Not to these influences,


or those that are similar, but to the followers of “ Sweetness and Light!” On the
one side we have our Spencers, our Arnolds, our Tennysons, our Huxleys, our
Coleridges, our Tyndalls; on the other side there are our Longfellows, our Holmeses,
our Bryants, our Emersons, our Howells, and many more of the noble band of
literary and scientific men and women, delighting the audiences assembled to hear
them, and charming those who sip the honey of their words. Nor is it alone by the
agency of what for distinction may be termed the Higher Literature that goodwill
now exists, but the present friendship is likewise traceable to the Press —that
potent agent for good or ill. Literary men are, therefore, practical men in the
highest sense of the word, and of this class it affords us much pleasure to introduce
Mr. Griffin to our readers, and trace briefly his career, as one worthy of having a
place amongst those of “Australian Kepresentative Men.” It is but fitting that
such a distinguished and unassuming man should receive a hearty, though brief,
recognition of his life and labours up to the present time. It is fitting, too, although
he is not an Australian, that his name should appear amongst those who have
identified themselves for years with the growth and development of the country, for
the good impression he has already produced, and the anticipated results which are
sure to flow from his hitherto successful efforts to place Australia in its true light
before his country. These considerations entitle him to the rank of a benefactor,
and, consequently, a Kepresentative Man of the Australian Continent.
Mr. Gilderoy Wells Griffin was born on March 6, 1840, in the city of
Louisville, Kentucky, a State of the Union, familiar to us from our childhood, for
which of us have not heard from the lips of the negro minstrels of the “ Old
Kentucky Home ?” whilst to those acquainted with the contemporary history of the
States, it is known as having had the honour of being the native State of the late
President Lincoln. Mr. Griffin obtained his education at various private schools in
his native city, and graduated at the Law Department of the University there in
1861. He practised law with the Hon. Bland Ballard, of Kentucky, but his
preference for literary pursuits caused him to devote his attention to subjects specially
connected therewith, and accordingly, in 1863, we find him beginning his literary
career by writing musical and dramatic criticisms for the Louisville Courier , and
subsequently becoming associated with Colonel Charles S. Todd in the editorial conduct
of the Louisville Commercial and Industrial Gazette, a paper which, under their able
management, soon became one of the most influential organs in the State. At that
time —1868 —the Louisville Journal had its editorial chair filled by one of the most
popular and gifted newspaper writers of America, Mr. George D. Prentice, a
politician who, in a Southern State, had the courage to advocate the cause of the
North—an undertaking not unattended with serious risk whilst the “stars and bars”
were floating all around him. American journalism differs in some respects from
that of English, and an incident which was the means of commencing and
cementing a friendship between Mr. Prentice and Mr. Griffin affords an illustration.
Mr. Griffin indited a paragraph caricaturing Mr. Prentice, and unhesitatingly named
the subject of his humorous flight. In England such conduct would call forth great


indignation on the part of the several organs of the Press, and it is not improbable
that the caricaturist would find himself called upon to apologise publicly. Not so in
America; nor was it so with Mr. Prentice, who, after recovering from an outburst of
laughter consequent on reading the paragraph, immediately penned a note of
invitation to the young writer.
The scene that ensued upon the meeting of Mr. Griffin (who did not hesitate
to accept the invitation) with Mr. Prentice was highly interesting. Appearing at the
office of the Journal, he enquired for Mr. Prentice, and, much to his astonishment,
received a reply from a gentleman claiming to be the object of his search, who was so
utterly regardless of all that is deemed necessary for an appearance in genteel society,
that he again put the question more forcibly by asking for Mr. George D. Prentice,
the editor of the Journal. We can imagine the alternate sensations of confusion and
shame experienced by the youthful litterateur, when he was informed again in the
affirmative by the greasy-coated, ragged-sleeved man that it was he who had the
honor to be that personage. The real state of the situation, which had begun to
dawn on Mr. Griffin, reached its climax when he was made familiar with the fact that
he was in the presence of the man about whom he wrote the “ funny paragraph.”
His embarrassment, however, was short-lived, for his shame was covered and his
heart was cheered by the forgiving and encouraging words of Mr. Prentice, who said,
“If you go to school, my boy, you will be an editor yourself some day.” Intricate
and past finding out are the paths which lead to friendship or to enmity. Here
was the man and the youth—the master and the pupil—the one soon to quit the scenes
of his earthly labours, the other about to enter on the arduous duties of life—the
Elijah and the Elisha of literature—destined but for a short time to enjoy the closest
of friendships, springing from an incident which, in ordinary cases, would have
caused, if not a total estrangement, at least a temporary coolness. Might not the
whole current of Mr. Griffin’s life have been changed had not the great Republican
editor with his kindly heart welcomed the advent of his visitor, and cheered him with
words of enthusiastic approval ? Upon the death of Mr. Prentice, in 1869, Mr.
Griffin wrote the life of that gentleman, and edited a volume entitled “ Prenticiana,
or Wit and Wisdom,” in paragraphs, which was published by Claxton and
Haffelfinger, of Philadelphia. In 1871, Mr. Griffin published a volume entitled
“ Studies in Literature,” a work consisting of a series of essays upon modern English,
French, and German Literature, and a number of Shakesperian and dramatic studies.
This book was well received, not only having a large sale, but gaining for the author
many friends.
Shortly afterwards followed a memoir of Colonel Chas. S. Todd, a fellow
journalist of Louisville, which is regarded as a most able and scholarly production.
Mr. Griffin’s literary ability was now fairly acknowleged, and the honesty of purpose
displayed in his writings brought him under the notice of no less a personage than
the great Soldier-President, General Grant. General Grant, quick in discovering
ability and ready to recognise it, offered Mr. Griffin the distinguished honour of his
country’s representative at Geneva. Mr. Griffin, however, who had consented to go,


and was about to leave for Switzerland, was appointed in that capacity at Copenhagen,
owing to the President altering his purpose, principally that he might be in the city
in which his (Grant’s) sister resided. During his stay in Copenhagen, from 1871 to
1876, Mr Griffin had ample opportunities of studying the Danish character, and as a
result speaks of the Danes in eulogistic terms, having but one complaint to make
about bis residence in Copenhagen, which was that the literary attractions were so
great, he found it difficult to cultivate social and friendly relations with his colleagues
as much as he could have wished. While in Denmark he published a volume
entitled “ My Danish Days,” which sufficiently reflects the kindly sentiments he feels
for all that is Danish. But, although he could not devote much time to social
relations for the reason just mentioned, yet he succeeded in winning the friendship
of two of the most interesting of the Danish writers of the period. He had the
great fortune (to a literary man at least) of forming the acquaintance of Professor
Stephen by the poet Longfellow—whose lines we quote at the head of this
biography—from whom he received a letter of introduction. Professor Stephen,
who is known chiefly by his discovery of the Runic alphabet, delighted him with his
vast antiquarian knowledge, and allowed him the great privilege of using his vast
library, the largest private collection in the world, of 120,000 volumes.
Two such congenial minds could hardly fail in becoming deeply attached to
each other, and so much was the Professor pleased with him on their first meeting
that Mr. Griffin was paid the compliment of being asked to spend every Sunday
evening during his stay in Copenhagen at his house. The Professor, desirous of
showing his esteem for Mr. Griffin, and, at the same time, laying upon him a pleasant
task, offered to give him a copy of his “ Runic Monuments,” an immense book that
sells for T2O, on the condition that, unaided, he would carry it away. We may feel quite
sure that, Herculean as it was, Mr. Griffin accomplished it on the conditions laid
down, since a prize such as that to a literary man is a second Koh-i-nor. Literary
men, by whom they are unknown personally, are considered all head, no heart;
but if a contradiction of that opinion is required, we cannot do better than relate the
following noble and generous act. By some means the stipend of the Consulate of
Copenhagen had been temporarily stopped, and Mr. Griffin was preparing to leave
for America his pleasant haunts and kindly friends, when the Professor exclaimed
in astonishment: “ Why, Consul, what do you mean by going home without visiting
Berlin and seeing the statue of Frederick the Great? Won’t you go to Cologne and
sail up the Rhine, to Geneva and visit the Castle of Chillon, to Rome and gaze
upon St. Peter’s, to Paris and to London?” “With all my heart, my Lord,”
replied the Consul, quoting from “ Richelieu,” “ but where am I to get the money?”
Mr. Griffin’s reply so pleased the translator of “Richelieu,” which was at the time
being played on the Danish stage, that when he awoke next morning his suspicions
of having given any offence were dissipated, for he discovered an envelope on his
desk containing T6O in rix dollars, which the Professor begged him to accept as a
loan for an indefinite period. Mr, Griffin hastened to visit the several capitals of
Europe, and, through the generosity of his friend, gained much information, which
has since stood him in good stead.


It is almost needless to say that most literary men, or men ot genius in
any sphere, have felt at times the pangs of pinching poverty, and when on one
occasion Mr. Griffin underwent such an experience, his friend and counsellor
supported him by his sympathetic words. No wonder, then, that his days among
the Danes form one of the brightest periods ot his life, and that he can say,
“My lot has never been cast among a kinder, a nobler, or a more charmingly
hospitable people.”
The other great friend that charmed the intellect ot Mr. Gritfm was one
whose labours in literature took a different course, and who can lay claim to the
honour of being one of the foremost men in the republic of letters—Hans Christian
Andersen, the famous Danish story-teller. How often have his stories delighted us
and our little folks ? To whom are his writings unfamiliar ? those beautiful fairy
tales, causing us to wander in Wonderland, and making us enjoy an “Arabian Night s
Entertainment.” Ever a lover of children, he entertained a deep affection for Mr.
Griffin’s baby daughter, and, it is said, would shake by the hand the little nurse-girls
whom he met in the street. Mr. Griffin’s unmixed pleasure in witnessing this great
man’s affection for his child must have been immeasurably increased by having the
enviable privilege of hearing the melodious voice of the author utter the words of
his fairy tales before they went to press.
As an illustration of the world-wide fame of this wonderful man, Mr. Griffin
relates that on his return to America he called upon a lady at Washington who had
once been associated with him in literary work, and when he told her he had
recently returned from Copenhagen her pleasurable surprise knew no bounds. Ihis
lady, with that elegance born of letters, gave Mr. Griffin as agreeable a surprise
when she introduced him into an apartment where her three children were romping,
he having expected to find some gentlemen who had met Andersen during their stay
at Copenhagen, as the lady told him some of his friends were in an adjoining room.
Mr. Griffin had the satisfaction of witnessing the magic spell of the story-teller’s
name when she requested her children to observe silence, as the gentleman “is from
Denmark, and knows Hans Christian Andersen.” All play ceased, and round Mr.
Griffin the children crowded, struck with that mute wonder peculiar to little folk.
On his taking leave, one of them said “ When you see him again, give my best love
to him, and tell him how much we like his beautiful stories.”
Previous to concluding our account of Mr. Griffin’s residence in Copenhagen,
we may mention that, in 1874, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
Northern Antiquaries of Copenhagen, an honour which has been conferred upon two
other Americans —Professor Longfellow, the poet, and George Lancroft, the historian.
In 1875, Mr. Griffin had the degree of Doctor of Philology conferred upon him by
Forest Academy, Anchorage, Kentucky, and, in the same year, received the Republican
nomination for Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Kentucky. In
1876, Mr. Griffin was sent, as United States Consul, to the Samoan Islands, to settle
the difficulties occasioned by the arrest of Colonel Steinberger, late I render of the
Samoan Government.


It his lite, in an official capacity at Copenhagen, was comparatively a sinecure,
it assumed, in the Samoan Islands, quite a different complexion, as a perfect hornet’s
nest had been stirred up. The conflicting interests of the English, the Germans,
and the natives, were singularly perplexing, and, on finding it impossible to gain the
support of his colleagues, he returned to America.
The Taimua and Faipula—the Samoan House of Lords and House of
Commons—-came to his residence in a body one morning, and insisted on his
becoming their ambassador to Washington, and, as a matter of fact, they armed him
with a remarkable document, which was to guarantee him immunity from any
annoyance in his own country, or at the hands of his own people. Though not
accepting this office, he subsequently succeeded in securing treaty relations between
the two countries, by which the harbour of Pago-Pago was ceded to the United
States for a period of ten years. Upon Mr. Griffin’s return to Samoa, he underwent
some decidedly strange experiences. The “Canterbury” arrived from Auckland
fitted out for desperate service, the expedition being under the command of Captain
Mair and Walter J. Hunt.
The fillibusters surrounded the United States Consulate one night about nine
o’clock, and upon Mr. Griffin’s refusal to leave, they pulled down the American flag,
levelled a pistol at his head, and wound up by ejecting him without either hat or coat
and throwing the archives of the Consulate out after him. In this condition he
wandered about the streets for nearly twenty-four hours, being unable to
communicate with the Native Government, as the fillibusters had stationed a guard at
each end of the road. He was, however, rescued from his distressing condition by
the timely arrival of the French man-of-war “Le Signelay,” commanded by Captain
Aube, who received him on board of his ship—to which he had paddled out in a
canoe. The Captain, after vainly endeavouring to persuade Mr. Griffin to proceed
with him to America, succeeded in reinstating him in authority. Mr. Griffin then
took up his residence at Mulinu, the native capital, for a period of seven months of
the most dreary existence, as he saw but one white face during that time. The
French Captain who assisted him is now Admiral Aube, Secretary of the French navy.
For the part this officer took in Samoan affairs, he was placed under arrest by the
Governor-General at Tahiti, and sent to Paris for trial by court-martial; but, instead
of being tried, the American nation presented him with their thanks, and his
Government promoted him to the rank of Commodore. When Mr. Griffin returned
to the United States, he received the congratulation and recommendation of
President Hayes, for standing at the post of duty and declining the offer of safety by
flight, even when his life stood in imminent danger. In 1870, Mr. Griffin was
promoted to the Consulate at Auckland, New Zealand, and during his term of office
there, supplied his Government with a series of carefully prepared and valuable
reports on the colony, its resources, and the prospects of trade with America. Since
receiving still further promotion by being appointed to the Consulate at Sydney,
he has supplemented his reports on New Zealand by furnishing his Government
with several upon the commerce and general resources of the Australian colonies.


Mr. Griffin is not only identified with literary and diplomatic triumphs, but
he may, through his niece, Miss Mary Anderson, one of the most beautiful and
accomplished actresses of the day, claim kinship with the dramatic world. From
early childhood she showed symptoms of dramatic talent, and, as the Consul relates,
when bordering on her teens she made her “first appearance” in the “tent scene” in
“ King Richard III,” in the presence of the family circle, with such success as to
justify the precocious statement of the child, who announced that she could play “the
part of the King better than Edwin Booth.”
In our opening remarks we stated that Mr. Griffin succeeded in favourably
impressing all those with whom he has come in contact on the Australian continent,
and, in concluding, we should think it strange were it otherwise, as he is a man of
studious, diffident, retiring, and generous disposition, possessing strength and
truthfulness of purpose, courting not publicity, but striving to discharge his duty in
a conscientious manner, first to the citizens of his country, and then to those of that
country where his office calls him.


THOMAS ELLISON.
subject of this notice was horn at Adelaide on the 7th March, 1850.
His father, John Ellison, was the son of a Church of England clergyman
in Ireland, and his mother the daughter of Mr. John McCann, a Belfast
business man. The gold fever of Victoria having extended its influence throughout
the Australian continent, the Ellison family left Adelaide for the Bendigo diggings.
Mr. John Ellison died in 1805. Young Ellison was educated at one of the
Denominational Schools at Sandhurst; and, though the educational facilities which
then prevailed were vastly inferior to those of the present lavish system, he obtained
a sound, common education. For a few years subsequently he was sent to a private
grammar school, and later on in life passed the Civil Service examination. He first
entered the office of Mr. Douglas, a solicitor, practising at Sandhurst. While there
Mr. Ellison made rapid progress, and, although Mr. Douglas proffered him his articles,
he relinquished the study of the law for a commercial life, and entered the employment
of Mr. Robert Moorhead, wine and spirit merchant, with whom he remained till
October, 1869, when he received his first appointment in the Commercial Bank of
Australia, then under the management of Mr. George Yallentine. Through the
various grades of junior clerkship, Mr. Ellison was fortunate in obtaining rapid
promotion; and his success was due no less to his early legal and commercial
training than to the personal supervision of the present manager, Mr. H. G. Turner.
In 1873 Mr. Ellison was appointed manager of the Ballan branch, and in the year
following was selected to open a new branch of the same bank at Echuca, after the
successful establishment of which he was appointed to the charge of the Sandhurst
office, where many financial complications had arisen between the banks and the
mining companies during the excitement of the year 1871. The liability of
shareholders under the Mining Act—then recently passed —was extremely doubtful,
and to determine this point the banks conjointly agreed to bring a test case before
the courts. The preparation of this case was confided to Mr. Ellison, who had the
gratification of seeing his efforts eminently successful. His success in the control of
this case made him the object, for a short time, of retaliatory attacks; but reflection
soon convinced the angry shareholders of their unjustifiable resentment, and he has
since become very popular amongst them. Upon the failure of the Australian and
European Bank, and its subsequent absorption by the Commercial Bank, Mr. Ellison
was despatched to Sydney to wind up its affairs there, and succeeded in accomplishing
this onerous and somewhat delicate task to the complete satisfaction of his employers.
In 1883 Mr. Ellison was promoted to the rank of Assistant Inspector at
Sandhurst, and still occupies that position. He has shown an earnest desire as a
private citizen to promote the prosperity of the city and district of Sandhurst. He is
City Treasurer, and, until his recent retirement, was chairman of the Sandhurst Pioneer
Co-operative Company, the most successful venture of its kind in the colony, as it
has a reserve fund equal to its capital, and returns 25 per cent, dividends, in addition
to 5 per cent, bonuses to the purchasers.

Sir James Mac Bam.


THE HON. SIR JAMES MACS AIN, KB, M.L.C.
HE ves the public men of Victoria, presenting an ever
111316 varying kaleidoscope of stern personal struggle and brilliant success,
of humiliating defeat and signal victory, of irretrievable disaster and
intoxicating triumph, in themselves delineate the history of the colony; and the life
story of those who, possessing marked original talent, combined with the cruder
qualities of strength and endurance, with thrift, integrity and enterprise added
thereto, have forced themselves to the front despite insuperable obstacles and
surroundings, contains chapters which recall to the mind prominent figures and
startling incidents which have become interwoven with the rapid rise, growth, and
prosperity of the Australian Continent. It is true that most of such stories
legitimately belong to the political sphere, yet there are some identified with the
achievement of the highest positions of honour and dignity which the political world
can offer that do not portray pre-eminently political life, but rather stand in broad
relief as exemplifications of the success attendant on perseverance and true worth.
Prior to the passing of Sir Graham Berry’s Eeform Bill, the attitude of the two
branches of the Legislature was one of latent or avowed hostility. Like an ill-matched
team, they put forth all their energies in pulling in opposite directions, thus bringing
about a contest, and then agreeing to a truce in order to gather their forces preparatory
to a renewal of measurement of strength. The Council in its unregenerate era was
redolent of wool. Elected on a very limited franchise, the members, ex vi terminorem,
sacrificed the whole to a part, and considered their duty to their constituents of far
greater moment than their responsibility to the country at large. They seemed
enamoured of the idea that they were entrusted with the special mission of protecting
the interests of the moneyed classes to the utter annihilation of democratic
legislation. The engrossing subject of their thoughts was Property, and as a
consequence, a tendency was manifested to view all measures submitted for their
consideration from one particular standpoint. This was not to be wondered at,
seeing that three-fourths of the members of that chamber were connected with the
pastoral interests, a fact which effectually tipped the arrows of radical humorists of
that day, and brought about the stigmatising of the Upper House as the “ bulwark
of property ” and the “stronghold of obstruction.” The present changed character
of the Chamber, under its reformed constitution, no longer admits of the reproach
being hurled at it that it represents a class ; and in this respect, at least, the
opprobriums, which fell thick and fast, can no more appropriately be launched
against it. The Council at present, broad-based upon the people’s will, may well
claim to be as representative as the more popular Assembly. The alteration of its


constitution lias been productive of one salutary result at least, and that is, that it
lias engendered a feeling of sympathy between the two Houses, which have learnt to
work more in unison for the common weal. The widening of the franchise has also
produced its natural effect on the composition and characteristics of the Lower
House, and hence the causes of difference have been reduced to an almost
vanishing point, and the overwhelming prominence given to one section of the
community under the old constitution, is now hut a memory of the past. The
representation, which at one time was monopolised by the pastoral interests, is now
fairly divided by agriculture, commerce, and the learned professions. Under the
new order of things, the Legislative Council might, with justice, claim to be
recognised as the business chamber, and, as a business man presiding over a business
chamber, there can be no question that Sir James Macßain is eminently the right
man in the right place.
Sir James is the youngest son of the late Mr. Smith Macßain, of Invergorden,
Scotland, and was born on the 19th April, 1828, at Kinrives, a small farm on the
estate of Kindeace in Boss Shire. His mother, Christina Taylor, a native of Moray
Shire, was sister of the late Alexander Taylor, a farmer, of Teaninich, on the Novar
Estate. When an infant his family removed from Kinrives to Scotsburn, and, after a
short residence there, settled at Invergorden, where our subject spent his early life
and received his education. Between the ages of six and thirteen Sir James was not
in a robust state of health, and this was aggravated by severe sufferings through
an accident—a fall from a horse. In after-life he very much deplored these
circumstances which precluded his taking any material advantage of the opportunities
offered him for a really good education. In 1845, he became indentured to Andrew
Smith, warehouseman, of 22 High Street, Inverness, in whose service he continued for
five years, and from whom he received generous attention and substantial kindness.
In 1852, Sir James connected himself with the firm of John Milligan, Son, and Co.,
of Bradford, and represented it in Scotland and the North of Ireland, but the life of
a commercial traveller proving uncongenial after a twelve month’s experience, during
which he laid the basis of many lasting friendships, particularly that of Mr. Harrison
Milligan and family, he reluctantly severed his connection with the firm, having in
view a visit to Australia. On the 13th July, 1853, he married Jessie, the youngest
daughter of the late William Smith, of Forres, and sister to Andrew Smith, of
Inverness, his former employer. On the 12th August following, accompanied by his
wife, he left his native land, taking passage in the steam ship “ Great Britain,” and
arrived in Melbourne on the 14th October, 1853. On arrival, he found commercial
matters so very unsettled that, on the advice of Mr. Charles Stewart (then accountant)
he was induced to enter into the service of the Bank of New South Wales as bill clerk.
In a short time he was made ledger-keeper, from which he passed on to the position
of receiving teller; thus gaining a new experience which proved of the utmost value
to him in after life. In 1857-58, he re-visited the Old Country, and, on his return, took
up the position of junior partner in the Melbourne branch of the firm of Gibbs,
Bonald and Co., general merchants and squatting agents, of Melbourne and Geelong;


their London firm being Richard Gibbs and Co. The business in Geelong was
managed by Mr. R. B. Ronald, and that in Melbourne by Sir James, whilst Messrs.
Richard Gibbs, and Byron L. Ronald superintended the London affairs. In 1863,
he was made a partner in the Geelong and London business. Such was the success of
the firm that in 1865 the partners disposed of the business to the Australian Mortgage,
Land and Finance Company, Limited, receiving for the goodwill the sum of T70,000.
The company’s business continued to be managed by the proprietors of the original
firm for some years, and now the subject of this memoir is chairman of the board
of directors in Australia, and his late partners occupy the positions of directors on
the London board of the company. This company, it might be mentioned en passant,
has been one of the most successful established under the Limited Liability Act, and
at present occupies a foremost position on the Stock Exchange.
Sir James being a Presbyterian, identified himself on his arrival in Melbourne
with the Rev. Dr. Cairns and the Chalmers Church congregation, and continued his
connection with that body until the resignation of the doctor, after which occurrence
he initiated the proceedings which led to the establishment of the Toorak
Presbyterian Church, by presenting the site for the building and contributing
towards the erection of the church and manse. He has always taken a deep interest
in educational matters, and now holds the position of trustee to the Scotch College
and the Ladies’ College—two very successful institutions. A fitting recognition of his
endeavours to advance the education of the youth of the colony is evidenced in the
fact of his having been appointed' a trustee and member of council of the Ormond
College, now affiliated with the Melbourne University. Sir James was a member of the
Board for the Protection of the Aborigines for some time, and at different periods
occupied the positions of president and vice-president in connection with it. He
was appointed one of the trustees of the Working-men’s College, and recently had the
appointment of a trustee of the Public Library and National Gallery bestowed upon
him. He also occupies a seat on the Melbourne board of directors of the Australian
Mutual Provident Society, and was identified with the Colonial Bank of Australasia
and the London Chartered Bank as director. In 1864, Sir James, who hitherto had
eschewed the political arena, was induced, through much solicitation, to enter the
Legislative Assembly, and represented the Electoral District of the Wimmera
continuously for 16 years. During his representation in this Chamber he obtained
the reputation of a thorough, honest, straightforward, and painstaking member.
His district was at first a purely squatting one, and as a squatter he thoroughly
understood its demands and desires. Although the squatting cause at the time was
a very unpopular one, such was the force of conviction with regard to his honesty
and desire for the public welfare, that he was always accorded a respectful hearing, even
from the most determined and rabid opponents of squatterdom. Although Sir James
was directly identified with pastoral pursuits, he at once recognised it to be his duty
to adapt himself to the altered circumstances of the electorate, brought about under
the operation of the Land Act of 1860, by which a very large area was selected for
agricultural and grazing purposes. The large increase of electors placed their


representative under new and increased obligations, all ol which he discharged to
the advantage of his constituents. His multifarious business engagements impelled
him on more than one occasion to refuse all offers of office, until the coming into
power of the O’Loghlcn Ministry, when he was persuaded into accepting a portfolio
without office, and heartily assisted Hr. Hobson in representing that Ministry in the
Upper House. As a political!, he adhered to the Constitutional party throughout,
and devoted considerable attention to the land laws of the colony. Huring the
“tack” and “Harling Grant” struggles, Sir James, though having a personal
sympathy with Sir James M‘Culloch, steadily adhered to his party. In 1872, he
vigorously opposed the second reading of the Education Amendment Bill introduced
by Mr. Stephen, pointing out then the defects which have now come to be recognised
as the blots upon the system. In opposing this measure, Sir James gave it as his
opinion that the Bill then introduced proposed to give teachers salaries, and abandon,
according to a prevalent idea, the reasonable and sensible suggestion of a capitation
allowance, and made no step whatever towards the removal of religious difficulties.
An adoption of the principle of the New Scotch Bill, which neither prescribed nor
proscribed Bible-reading in the schools, but left the question to the decision of the
parents, was advocated by him with the conviction that it would render the
new law almost irreproachable. His views will be better understood by the following
quotation from his speech on the third reading of the Bill, given as a protest;—
With regard to the Bill itself, having on a previous occasion moved, “ That the Bill be read a
second time this day six months,” and having in Committee proposed several amendments, without
being able to induce the Government to accept any one of them, I am not desirous of asking for a
division on the third reading. I shall content myself with simply entering my protest against the Bill,
for reasons which I shall state briefly. The Bill professes to be purely secular ; and yet we are assured
that the same religious instruction that is imparted in the existing schools will continue to be imparted.
A statement to that effect was made by a member of the Government, and has never been contradicted.
I asked the Government for a definition of the term “secular,” and it has never been given ; but we
have been told that while religion will be taught under the Bill, the simple reading of the Bible will be
prohibited. It was said that the Bill would do away with all class differences in the State schools—
that the children of the rich, of the middle class, and of the poor would all meet together without
distinction —and yet this distinction is provided for. There will be a free education up to a certain
standard, and the education beyond that will be paid for. Another reason why I protest against the
third reading of the Bill is that it unnecessarily prohibits the teaching of religion by the school-teachers
within the school buildings at any time. I think this a tyranny which ought not to be countenanced.
If the parents of the children and the teachers themselves could agree as to the imparting of religious
instruction during any hour of the day outside the four hours set apart for secular instruction, I think
the law should not interfere, as it will unnecessarily interfere with the liberty of the teacher, and deprive
him of his privilege as a member of the community. A further objection I have to the Bill is that it
gives the Government absolute control over the management of the schools. It vests in them the
appointment and removal of teachers—the nomination and dismissal of local Boards, and the power to
prescribe the instruction that is to be taught, and to proscribe everything that is not to be taught in the
schools. It leaves no power to the parents ; they cannot interfere in any matter concerning the
education of their offspring. Lastly, lam opposed to the Bill because it deprives all the districts in the
colony of local self-government so far as public instruction is concerned ; and because it deprives parents
of their rights as citizens of a free country, and relieves them from the obligation which rests upon
them in connection with the education of their children. I content myself with stating these objections.
I shall not call for a division.


He materially assisted in abolishing State aid to religion, and in defeating the
amendment ol the constitution in the direction of the Norwegian system introduced
by the late Mr. J. G. Francis. The Land Tax Bill met with a serious and
determined opposition from him on the ground of its being a “penal class tax,” and
in the Council afterwards he helped in throwing out the amending Land Tax Bill
forwarded to the Upper House by the Berry Administration. It was at his suggestion
of a conciliatory course that the “ Payment of Members Bill” did not place the two
chambers at “ daggers drawn” as it at one time threatened to do. The payment of
Members of the Council was included in the Bill for the Payment of Members of the
Assembly. The Council expressed its determination to throw out the measure for
the payment of its members, but was willing to agree to that part of the measure
embracing the payment of Members of the Assembly. To give effect to this
determination it was found necessary to embody the measure in two separate and
distinct bills dealing with each Chamber respectively. At first the Lower House
refused to separate the two Chambers, and it was not until Sir James had, by
finessing, induced the two Houses to meet and confer on the subject that the Bill was
framed in two parts, and that dealing with the Assembly passed, whilst the other
dealing with the Council was rejected.
His general aim has been practicality, and on financial and other subjects with
which he is acknowledged to be thoroughly au fait, he is listened to with the
deference which denotes an authority.
In 1883 Sir James paid a visit to England, when the opportunity was availed
of for his appointment as Chairman of the Victorian Commissioners at the Amsterdam
Exhibition, and while there he had the honour of chaperoning their Majesties the
King and Queen of the Netherlands through the Victorian Court. It is only fair to
mention that the expenses incidental to the position of Chairman of Commissioners,
together with all outlay for travelling, &c., were entirely borne by Sir James
himself. At the end of 1884, on the demise of the Hon. Sir W. F. Mitchell, the
President of the Legislative Council, Sir James (then Mr.) Macßain was elected to
fill the vacancy. To the present there has been no occasion for regretting the
confidence placed in him by his fellow-members, a confidence of which he expresses
himself deeply sensible. It being understood that the position of President of the
Upper Chamber carries with it the favour of Her Majesty the Queen, Mr. Macßain,
on the 24th May, 1886, had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him.
Sir James is largely interested in squatting pursuits, in the adjoining
colonies, and his prominence in commercial circles has caused his name to
be held in high esteem on ’Change. His career has been one of steady and
continuous progress. He has not woo’d Fortune by any brilliant coup, nor has he
ever staked his all on the hazard of the die. He has not sued for the smiles of the
fickle goddess, but has rather forced her favours by an unremitting persistency and a
knowledge of retaining what he had acquired. It need not be inferred that Sir James
has ever evinced an apathy towards the wants and requirements of the needy, for
his hands are aye pady and willing to hold out help to the deserving unfortunate.


GODWIN GEORGE ORE SPIN
N these democratic and liberal days, revolutionising all the old-time ideas of
mm humiliation and disgrace in connection with business and trade, how many
scores of names that were once closely allied to strawberry leaves and
coronets, are we called upon to note in conjunction with growing industries or
manufactures, and in gazing upon these we are insensibly led to conjure up the picture
of Cincinnatus relinquishing his plough to lead the armies of Rome. The horror and
loathing which, in the mediaeval times, attached themselves to business have how
been superseded by the maxim, that it is not the work or trade that ennobles the
man, but vice versa. As there are instances in olden times of nations having become
powerful, in an aggressive sense, though inexperienced in industrial pursuits, and
unaccustomed to the sheen of the precious metals, so now-a-days do we see, in the
cases of individuals, wealth and position secured mainly through industry,
perseverance, and integrity. Money employed in merchandising, says Lord Bacon,
is the vena porta of wealth in a State, and the customs of Kings or States ebb or tall
in merchandising. Look in whatever direction we may, we see the busy industrial
enterprise characteristic of the age; and a retrospective glance at the rise, extension
and decline of families, communities, and nations, shows the important position
always occupied by commerce in those events. Through all the varying vicissitudes
of civilised countries, Commerce has been in constant attendance, serving as a
pioneer in infancy, giving strength in maturity, while their inevitable dissolution has
invariably been prefigured by its waning prosperity. The field opened up for
enterprise, and the re-building of shattered fortunes, in the newly-discovered and
colonised continent of Australia, by various modes, more particularly by those of
delving for that precious metal which some thirty years ago exercised so potent a
charm over the destinies of thousands, and by the more legitimate, if slower, process
of trade, offered exciting opportunities to innumerable men who, having been
brought up in the lap of luxury, through unavoidable circumstances were compelled
to begin life afresh, and become the architects of their future. Such men, by the
very force of circumstances, and an unwillingness to descend from the pride of
position, in the places of their birth, emigrated to these colonies to follow each his
bent in’the object nearest to his heart. These, in the majority of cases, brought
with them that dogged determination to succeed, which bore them successfully
through all the trying and enervating conditions of pioneer life. Of such characters,
the father of our present subject was one.
Godwin George Crespin, a native of Victoria, was born in Melbourne, on the
19th September, 1842. He is a scion of the old ducal family of the Crespins, which


is mentioned in a late publication ol ancient families, compiled by a French
nobleman, as one of the oldest in Europe, being traceable to the Empress Crespina
of Rome. Through his father he is related to Baldwin Crespin, late Earl of Devon
and Earl Mareschal ol Normanby. His father’s uncle was Admiral Gidion, who
commanded the lorhay in 1782, in the action against France. Mr. Crespin is a
lineal descendant ol Sir AYalter Raleigh, and evinces a certain pride in having had
lor an ancestor, the man who introduced into England the two articles of subsistence
and luxury—the potatoe and tobacco. Through family differences, his father, who
was disinherited, came to Australia in 1841, and shortly after his arrival, Godwin
George made his appearance on the sublunary stage. On his arrival in Melbourne,
Crespin pere was fortunate enough to purchase some land in Little Collins Street,
between Elizabeth and Swanston Streets, at twenty-live shillings per foot, and this
judicious investment, in the course of a few years, proved of vital importance to his
family, yielding them a competence, when he, the bread-winner, was carried to his
last bourne. Mr. Crespin had the great misfortune to lose his father when he was
but live years old. Owing to this calamity and the vicissitudes of early colonial life,
he was prevented from obtaining a thoroughly good education, his schooling having
further been interfered with by his travels through South Australia and on the River
Murray, where about six years of his life were spent. His love of acquiring
knowledge was however so great, that notwithstanding all obstacles, whenever an
opportunity offered, he diligently availed himself of it and stored up much useful
information, which benefited him in after life. He returned to Melbourne in 1858,
and devoted as much of his time as was practicable to study, and at the age of 17
was enabled to place his foot on the first rung of the commercial ladder. During his
younger days he witnessed and now vividly remembers many scenes associated with
the early history of the colony. The Orange riots in Queen Street, in 1840; the
intensely suffocating heat, and the bush fires of what has since been known as “Black
Thursday;” the opening of Princes Bridge; the corroborees held by the Aborogines
in New Town, now known as Fitzroy, are all fresh in his memory. He recalls with
amusement the time, not so very far back, when the Melbourne shipping trade with
New South Wales was confined to one steamer, the “ Shamrock,” and comparing at
the present day its wharves, streets, immense buildings and storehouses, its incredible
shipping, water supply, its ramified railway system, and the pre-eminently proud
position it holds amongst the cities of the world, ho expresses his pride in that he can
call himself a Victorian. No Frenchman was ever prouder of Paris than is Mr.
Crespin of Melbourne.
In 1859, he commenced his career as office boy in the well-known firm of
Messrs. Fanning, Nankivell and Co., Eastern merchants'. Here his perseverance,
energy, and suavity soon caused him to be noticed by his superiors, who rewarded his
diligence and integrity by gradual promotion. In 18G4, shortly after his mother’s
death, he married an amiable lady, who bore him a large family. Ho continued in
the employ of Messrs. Fanning and Nankivell for a period of seventeen years,
attaining the position of manager. During these years, Mr. Crespin was a member


of the Young Men’s Christian Association, and in 18G5 was elected vice-president
of its Eiclnnond branch, and delivered many able and interesting lectures in
that institution. In February, 18G7, he was elected unopposed as a member
of the Collingwood Town Council, and while a councillor acted as secretary
to the “Prince Alfred Kcception Committee,” and handed the Prince the silver
trowel at the laying of the foundation stone of the Mechanics’ Institute, in Smith
Street. When residing at Abbotsford he took an active part in Church matters, and
was treasurer of St. Philip’s Church for three years, at the same time fulfilling the
duties of superintendent of the Sunday School. In 187G, Mr. E. D. Greig, the
surviving partner of Messrs. Greig and Murray, auctioneers, being desirous of
relinquishing business through ill health, offered his business to Mr. Crespin,
whom he had known so long and favorably, in his connection with Messrs.
Fanning, Nankivell and Co. Mr. Crespin hesitated to accept of such a responsibility
and even at first declined it, but Mr. Greig whose business qualifications and
experience rendered him almost an unerring judge of merit, eventually prevailed
upon him to acquiesce in his views of having what was then and is now a very
flourishing concern transferred to him. A bargain was finally struck, and in January,
1877, Mr. Crespin, in conjunction with Mr. W. G. Cramer, who was then in the
employ of Greig and Murray, essayed the role of a “knight of the hammer.”
While with Messrs. Fanning, Nankivell and Co., who were then the largest
importers of sugar, Mr. Crespin devoted considerable time and attention to the sugar
trade, which he has followed up ever since, and his position with regard to, and
knowledge of this commodity is defined by his frequently being alluded to as “ the
King of the Sugar Market.” The members of his firm are now the largest sugar
brokers in Australia. In addition to its extensive dealings in the above, the firm does
a heavy business in tea, besides conducting weekly sales of oilmen’s stores, Ac. As
an auctioneer, Mr. Crespin is vigorous and active. His voice is clear and distinct,
and such is the estimation he is held in, by the commercial section, that his word is
accounted as valuable as his bond. His genial manner and straightforwardness has
secured him the respect, support and goodwill of all traders in the colony. Though
his business is of a harassing nature, he preserves an evenness of temper which
carries him through many difficulties. He has twice served Kew in the capacity of
councillor, but resigned his seat late in 188G, through pressure of business. He
still occupies the position of chairman of the Mercantile Finance and Guarantee Co.,
which is an important institution. Mr. Crespin has been frequently importuned to
enter the political lists, but has hitherto declined. For the past five years he has
been energetic as one of the board of management of the Homoeopathic Hospital,
and is a firm believer in that system of treatment.
The question of Federation has been seriously considered by Mr. Crespin, who
concludes that the consolidation of the colonies into a Federal State, would be a
benefit, although the results would depend on a variety of conditions material
political, geographical, and social. As a first step towards the realisation of his
dream, he solicitously advocates intercolonial reciprocity.


COL. THE HON. W. G SMITH, M.L.A.
J«»HE subject of this sketch was born at Ballington, in Cheshire, England, in
large cotton manufactory there. He left England for Victoria in 1852 in the
ship “ Birmingham,” and on arrival started for Sandhurst. Meeting with no success
there, he returned to Melbourne, and thence made his way to Creswick, eventually in
1855 going to Ballarat, where he settled down. With that energy characteristic of
him, he soon identified himself with the mining interest of the district, and took an
active part in promoting many of the great enterprises of those and after times.
Within a year of his arrival in Ballarat he was elected a member of the City Council,
and was made chairman shortly after. In 1864, having served as a councillor for
eight years, he retired. In 1870 he was re-elected, and made Mayor of the city in 1875.
In 1869 Col. Smith acted as chairman at the Municipal Conference, held in the
Melbourne Town Hall, at the end of which a public meeting was convened to
consider the questions of Water Supply and Goldfields. Of this public meeting Mr.
Smith was again chairman. This was the first step towards the inauguration of the
present water system, and he might fairly claim to be the originator of the scheme.
His dehut in the Legislative Assembly was made in company with Mr. Duncan
Gillies for Ballarat West. He entered eight months prior to the expiry of that
Parliament. In 1871 he again offered himself to the same constituency, and was
elected by an overwhelming majority, the Hon. Joseph Jones being the second member.
In this contest Mr. Smith beat Messrs. C. E. Jones and John Gray. During his
representation he obtained the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into
the working of the Local Government Act, with a view to amending it. This
committee was converted into a Eoyal Commission, with Mr. E. P. S. Sturt as
chairman, to inquire into and report upon municipal and charitable institutions.
The outcome of the commission was a report laid on the table within three
months, and the Act subsequently passed was framed on this report. In 1871 he
moved for the appointment of a Select Committee for the purpose of inquiring into
the working of local governing bodies, with a view of extending their powers. 01
this committee he was appointed chairman. Failing to bring in a report by the end
of that session of Parliament, the committee was converted into a Royal Commission,
and after travelling through the colony, within three months furnished a report,
which formed the basis of the Local Government Act. About this time, becoming
Mayor of Ballarat, he succeeded in floating a loan, which freed the City Council from
all its financial difficulties. In 1874 Mr. Smith was again returned to Parliament for
Ballarat West; and in 1875, Mr. Berry coming for the first time into power, he


accepted the portfolio of Minister of Mines, and on appealing to his constituents,
was returned unopposed. At the general elections in May, 1877, lie was again
returned to the Assembly, and supported the Liberals zealously, reaping a reward for
his labours and consistency in the portfolio for the Mines, on Mr. Berry securing the
Treasury Benches for the second time. He now filled a dual position, the
office of Minister of Public Instruction being also conferred upon him. During
the term of office of the McCulloch Ministry, on the amending of the Electoral
Act, Mr. Smith succeeded in securing an additional member for the representation
of Ballarat West.
In 1880 he moved for leave to introduce a bill to give greater security of title
to the holders of claims and mining tenements efficiently working the same under
miners’ rights. At the same time he seconded a motion of Mr. Williams’ for the
abolition of mining boards.
In the matter of the Reform Bill, which was introduced during the session
1880-81, Mr. Smith, who in all preceding debates on the question of reform had
uniformly been in favour of broadening the basis of the Legislative Council, spoke to
the effect that he believed the best and most popular direction for amendment of the
Constitution lay in the broadening of the basis of the Council. When the majority of
his colleagues decided upon a different line of policy, he loyally assisted them as far as
he could in carrying out their scheme. He fought the question with them in the
House, on the platform, and at several general elections. In expressing his opinion
on reform, he virtually repeated the opinion formed many years prior in the district
of Ballarat, which has always stood in the forefront of Liberalism. In denying that
the bill introduced by the Government of the day was based on the principles of the
Service Reform Bill, he produced a document—■“ Liberal Reform Programme of
Ballarat West and Ballarat East for 18C9 ” —which had been made to do duty in
several schemes of reform proposed both by the Conservatives and the Liberals.
The items in this programme were: Secular and compulsory education; a Land Bill,
the leading feature of which should be the settlement of the people; a bill to
regulate mining on private property; payment of members; mining reform, including
the reduction of rent of mining leases; a Workman’s Lien Bill; protection to native
industry; the revision and redistribution of electoral districts; the extension of local
government, including the supervision of the public charities; the abolition of State
aid to immigration (a principle which Mr. Smith recommended to the Minister of
Railways); and the establishment of a National Bank.
Four of the above measures had been in the interim carried into law by the
Liberals, and the others had been partially adopted. Notwithstanding the Liberals
had been able to carry so much of what they had set their hearts upon, they yet
wanted reform in order that the people might, without the country being thrown into
a state of turmoil, and without the bitterness attendant on two general elections
within a few months, have their opinion, when fairly ascertained, carried into law.
The people wanted the Constitution so amended that a fair and reasonable reflex of
their views might be found in the Upper Chamber. He was quite decided in his


opinion of the necessity of creating single electorates, and asserted that, no matter if
qualification ol electors were made simply the ratepayers’ roll with manhood
suffiagc added, reform would have no effect in liberalising the Council if the
provinces were allowed to remain of the same extent as they then were. They were
each as large as a small European kingdom; so large that a man of moderate
means could not venture on contesting one. The result of this was that the
members of the Legislative Council were elected according as they were nominated
in the Melbourne Club, the Chamber of Commerce, or some counting-house
in Collins Street.
With regard to that question of magnitude, affecting, as it doubtless will, not
only Victoria, but the neighbouring colonies—the Federal Council of Australasia
-Bill Colonel Smith submitted that the passing of the Bill would virtually alter the
Constitution of Victoria. He urged that the Parliament was handing over very large
powers to what he really considered another Board—a Board something like the Public
Senice Board. He objected to the proposed representation of Victoria by two votes
only in the Council. He was of opinion that the Acts of the Federal Council would
be something like the laws of the Medes and Persians. The Chamber which really
represented the people was asked by that Act to hand over its power to a Council, in
which it would have but two votes against eight. He warned the House that the
manufacturers and employes of Victoria, in which such vast industries were springing
up, would condemn all the members who allowed that measure to pass without
consulting them.
He has been a member of the Volunteer Force for about the past twenty-three
years, entering in 1861 as a private, and gaining his successive steps by passing
all his examinations, until the attainment of his present position. In 1868, when the
Winter’s Freehold Gold Mining Company—which purchased for T50,000 about 1,300
acres of freehold land, that cost the proprietor originally T1 per acre—wished to
float a company, Mr. Smith was entrusted with the task; and with that object
visited England, where he succeeded in inducing capitalists to merge T25,000 in
the undertaking. He has always been a great speculator in mining ventures, making
considerable hits and often losing as considerably. His foresight and great knowledge
of mining, however, have secured his recognition as a shrewd investor, and
he is looked upon as an undoubted authority on all matters pertaining to mines
and mining.


REV. G. It. COLE.
Ji^KATK I) amid the ruins of the Capitol, on an October evening, Gibbon, the
famous historian, deeply buried in thought, had his attention aroused by
the sound of music, which was wafted towards him from the Church of
St. Mary, in Eome, at one time the Temple of Jupiter. The sun had set, the stars
were beginning to pierce their way through the still remaining haze created by his
sultry splendour, a stray passer-by might be occasionally noticed, and from the
Eternal City might be heard that peculiarly mysterious murmur of voices indicative of
throbbing life. The air was still, and were it not for a faint breath of wind, which
ever and anon kissed the cheek, fancy could have led the contemplative man to
believe he was in another world ; but, no ! for he heard “ My soul doth magnify the
Lord ; ” he listens, and then the verse containing the words which allude to the
scattering of the proud, and the raising of the meek, suggest to him the thought
“ Who are these proud ? The mighty Caesars ? Yes, it may be that these are they;”
but stay, the chant is continued, and he hears the words “ The rich He hath sent
empty away.” Who are these “ rich ? ” Those who overran the world to fill the
Imperial coffers with treasure ? Yes ; and then he forms the plan of writing the
decline and fall of thee, 0, Eome! once mistress of the world. Such a monument
of genius was suggested by that chant, and to write such was well-nigh a
superhuman task. But who could write the decline and fall of the evil within man ?
Who could describe, in a degree approaching fidelity and accuracy, the dethronement
of the proud imaginations of the heart of man, the rise and progress of religious
feeling, the conflicts of the inner and the outer man. From the cradle to the grave
life is a contest: here a difficulty, there an obstacle, elsewhere a blunder; especially is
this the case with many who have struggled forth from darkness to light, from impurity
to purity, from death to life. The room is heated, the sky looks threatening, the
wind is murmuring, relentlessly time rolls on, the ticking of the clock tells of so
many more seconds gone, never to be recalled, buried in the tomb of eternity, and
the man is alone battling with his own evil nature, wrestling with his own wayward
character, grappling with his own vicious habits. Such is the encounter some are
required to undergo, while to others religion comes in a quiet, calm manner. Some
men are ever feeling out into the abyss of the illimitable, others are content to accept


tlio mysterious without question. Judging from what the Rev. G. H. Cole has
experienced in ascending the ladder of holiness, it may be said that his was an
eventful life.
He is a native of Victoria, and was born at Mickleham, 20 miles distant from
Melbourne, on 7th December, 1859. His parents, who are English, landed in
Melbourne in 1849. His father was fairly successful in life, although bitter times
were occasionally experienced in bringing up a large family ol two sons and nine
daughters, three of the latter being now dead. He had but a limited education
during his boyhood, as for a few years he was not within easy distance ol a school.
He was quick at learning, had wonderfully imaginative powers during his early life,
but lacked application. Like many boys, he had recourse to many devices in order
to avoid going to school, amongst others pretending lameness. Removing to
Dungaree, he lived on a farm some twelve miles distant from Ballarat, where he
endured a hard and rough life for nine years, going to school about three days a
week for six years of that time, and working the remainder of the time on the
selection. He became an expert at agricultural work, and could plough and reap
with dexterity. He hated school at this time, and associating with the men, whose
company he preferred, he soon acquired the habit ol using rough language. Mr.
Cole’s first religious impressions were made by his mother when he was about nine
years of age. He used to pray at cottage prayer meetings, and would gather all
the children he could into his father’s stable, where he would preach to them ; but
he soon got tired of this mode of procedure, and seems to have retrograded. It
was at this time that he went to work on the farm at nine shillings per week, and
had to sleep in the stable. He next went to a sheep station, two hundred miles
from home, as boundary rider, and stayed there about eighteen months, during
which time he had many narrow escapes from death, on one occasion being lost in
the mallee, where he wandered about all night. He was of a mischievous turn of
mind, and used to play all sorts of tricks on the poor Chinamen, but while in the
roughest company was never addicted to the habit ol open blasphemy. After a time he
had contrived to save a little money, and having left the station, he, with his father’s
assistance, purchased a team of bullocks, with which he went carting wool, timber,
and other articles. He remained at this work for about two years, and received
charge of the team, at fifteen years of age. He had begun to drink, and was
rapidly descending the social scale; but the turning point in his career was now
about to take place, for having sold the bullocks, and removed to the farm at
Mickleham, his birth-place, he had the opportunity of going to church every Sunday.
Here, to use Mr. Cole’s own words, “ under the preaching of the Rev. W. H.
Walton, my sins began to roll up before me. I fancied some one had been telling
him all about me. Yes, every word was for me.” So the prodigal returned home at
seventeen years of age under the truth preached by the Rev. W. H. W. Feet.
After undergoing a great conflict with doubt, he was appointed as a prayer leader ;
but his mother feared that he would fail on account of lack of education, which he
now seems to have felt most keenly.


However, taking courage, he began to study earnestly, although he had a very
up-hill light; indeed, so much so, that when he was announcing a hymn or reading
a chapter in public, he was obliged to learn beforehand how to pronounce the words
correctly.
Perseverance in the end had its reward, for between studying while others
slept and working on the farm, he became a duly appointed lay preacher in the
Primitive Methodist Church. He now selected land on his own account, and for
lour years, while continuing to pursue his custom of working with his hands by day
and his head by night, he still experienced a temptation to abandon the spiritual
life. He felt, nevertheless, that he was intended for the work ; but how was he to
act ? To take to the ministry meant the loss of two hundred acres of first-class
land. He determined, however, to follow up the calling; and leaving his farm,
placed himself under a teacher where, by dint of devouring greedily one book after
another, he succeeded in gaining a tolerably good knowledge. Offering himself for
the ministry, he was sent to Hamilton, in the Western district, where he laboured
lor two years very successfully. He then went to Tasmania, where he was equally
successful in gathering a good congregation, and, in 1885, removed to Ballarat, where
his efforts were much appreciated. Having completed his probation, he was
ordained at the Conference at Geelong, and accepted an invitation to Sale, Gippsland
where he is at present engaged accomplishing useful work. Mr. Cole has always
been one of the leading men in the Temperance cause, and was appointed, in
conjunction with Hr. Roshy, as a speaker at some of the large “Blue Ribbon” meetings
ol Ballarat, the newspapers alluding to the speeches, of which very full reports
have been given, in flattering terms, and describing that of Mr. Cole’s as a masterly
and excellent address. It may truly be said that the life of the Rev. G. H. Cole is one
of the most eventful; but the foregoing sketch plainly shows that a steady adherence
to right will in the end overcome the greatest obstacles, and that the most successfu
men in dealing with human nature are those who have been schooled in its
weaknesses. His consistent conduct, his earnestness and his zeal, have gained for
him and his amiable partner, whom he married in 1886, and has proved a true
helpmate in his career, the respect and esteem of the people of Sale.


WILLIAM HOBBS.
the various industries which have rivalled each other in
mm contributing to raise the colony of Victoria to the prominent position
pISiVP it now enjoys in the commercial world, that of mining has undoubtedly
been one of the foremost. It was the discovery of gold, and the glowing reports of
the success attending its search, that prompted many to leave their native shores
in 1852 to seek their fortunes here. So great was the excitement created that
trades and professions were cast aside and loving friends were left behind, in order
to acquire a little of the precious metal. Moreover, the dangers of the deep, the
discomforts of a life on board ship in those days, and unforeseen hardships were
endured in anticipation of being able to gain an independency—hope, that
mysterious agent which cheers the ambitious youth and supports old age tottering-
on crutches, beckoning to the grand Bonanza in store for all. Good old times were
these, over which memory loves to hover, as it wanders back to conjure up the
scenes that are now buried in the depths of the past. Then it was that much of
the bone and muscle of Great Britain reached these shores, to be spent in
“ unearthing the yellow,” and to make a new era in the advancement of Australia.
Since that period numerous have been the fluctuations and changes of fortune, and
many bright golden crossthreads have been woven into the warp of colonial history.
But in scanning the lives of the thousands who flocked thither in quest of an
increased prosperity, the majority, after thirty-five years of unceasing toil, have not
realised their object, and it is only the fortunate few to whom the rich prizes have
fallen. The blood that then coursed so vigorously through the stalwart frames now
moves less quickly, the pulse beats slower and more feebly; while one by one in
quick succession the pioneer diggers are rapidly disappearing, leaving faint
footprints on the golden sands. Of those who achieved success in mining, mention
must be made of the late William Hobbs, whose perseverance and industry assisted
in developing some of the deepest quartz mines in Victoria.
He was born in Bristol, July 8, 1831. After receiving an elementary
education, learned the trade of a joiner, which he followed up until he determined
to go to Australia. Previous to leaving home he was married to Miss Windmill, of
Glastonbury; and on November 23, 1852, in company with that courageous young
partner (then only seventeen years of age), bade adieu to his friends, and sailed
from the port of Bristol in the ship “ Mary Ann.” After a long voyage of five


months, Port Phillip Bay was reached, and the passengers landed in the then
infant city of Melbourne. Here Mr. Hobbs and his wife remained lor two years,
he following his trade, and usually receiving about thirty shillings per day. Such
wages may seem high, but they are not out of proportion to the cost of living at
that time, when a small cabbage, for example, could not be purchased for less than
half-a-crown. When he had worked for some time at his trade he undertook
contracts, and built many of the houses in Melbourne, but relinquished the business,
having determined to try his luck on the diggings. Coining to Castlemaine, he
followed the “rushes” from one place to another with little success. In November,
1856, he went to Stawell, where he industriously set to work, and soon earned
money enough to purchase a team of bullocks and a dray.
He next obtained teams of horses, with which he carted quartz and timber
from and for the mines, which were then yielding rich stone. By this means he
acquired a little money, which he invested in mining ventures, his foresight enabling
him to judge which would, in several instances at least, prove remunerative. In this
manner he slowly but surely worked his way up. He also was fortunate in obtaining
a large quantity of gold from No. 8 Scotchman’s claim, and received for some years
dividends with great regularity from the Pleasant Creek Cross Reef Company.
Many other speculations into which he entered turned out so favourably that he
rapidly advanced to a position of wealth.
Mr. Hobbs was the largest shareholder in the Newington Company, and his
untiring energy in prospecting will never be forgotten. The announcement of his
sudden death from heart disease, which took place at Avalon Park, Longerenong,
on October 17, 1881, while busily engaged in superintending shearing operations,
cast quite a sombre gloom over the town of Stawell; in fact, its unexpectedness
rendered it for a time incredible, as he had been so lately in the enjoyment ol good
health, and mingling among his numerous friends. Mr. Hobbs evinced the deep
interest he took in the town, with which he had been so long and honourably
connected, by readily expending his wealth on its improvement. He was largely
associated with Messrs. Kinsella in a mining venture, known as the Moonlight
Company, including crushing battery and plant, which his estimable widow has
retained since his death, she having bought the largest interest in the Magdala mine,
now known as the Magd al a-c? m -Moo nligh t. This claim, at present, is the most
productive of its description in Stawell, and is also the deepest quartz mine in
Australia. Mrs. Hobbs is a most enterprising lady, and takes a great deal of interest
in mining. It is our pleasing duty, in concluding this memoir, to express the hope
that she and her family, consisting of four sons and four daughters, may be spared
to see the toil and capital expended in mining in Stawell receive its fitting reward.


RESUME OF THE FIRST FEDERAL COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA,
( l lies ' tion °f Colonial Federation lias become an important political topic
Sim in Australia, and the very little headway that federal policy had made up
to the end of 1885 may be attributed to the need for the education of the
public mind, and the creation of an enlightened public opinion on the subject. The
chief factor, up to a recent date, in the adverse causes operating against the federal
policy, was the shaping of Australian policy by men born and trained in the mother
country. So long as the governing classes were composed of men not Australian in
sentiment, it could not have been expected that any very strenuous efforts would
have been essayed to make Australia a great country, prepared to take its place
among the family of nations. An Australian party was wanted as a first step
towards Australian federation, and, notwithstanding the fiasco of 1881, when the
proposition for a Federal Council collapsed, in consequence of the opposition of the
Radical Premier of Victoria at the Intercolonial Conference held in Sydney, a
concrete party now exists, which, looking upon the motto Unitas prosvaluit, as the one
for adoption, and bearing in mind that greatest political unity ensures greatest
national prosperity, seeks to place Australia fiacih princeps amongst the other nations
of the world. This party, the very head and front of which is the Hon. James
Service, by dint of perseverance, caused such measures to be compassed as brought
into existence a Federal Council, which held its first session at Hobart, the capital of
Tasmania, in January, 1886. The first day’s proceedings in connection with the
inaugural meeting, on the 25th January, 1886, were necessarily of a quiet, formal,
and judicial character, forming a fitting prelude to the imposing ceremony which was
to follow the next day. The members assembled quietly, and, in the presence of a
scanty audience, transacted the few matters of routine in that manner savoring of the
presence and equanimity of veterans who had faced the ordeals of far greater political
arenas. The building, in one of the chambers of which the Council was held, had a
history of its own, apart from the lustre shed upon it by the holding of the first
Federal Council within its walls. It dates back to the times of Sir George Arthur
and Sir John Franklin, in which it was used as a customs house, a survey office, and
other Government organisations. Shortly before eleven o’clock the delegates arrived
from the Chief Secretary’s office, where they had assisted at a meeting in camera.
The outside public included the Acting Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Kerferd (of Victoria),
Hr. Agncw, Messrs. James Grant and J. W. Syme and the private secretaries of the
delegates, and the representatives of the Intercolonial Press. Mr. Douglas took up
his position at the head of the benches to the right of the chair with Mr. Griffith as


his next supporter, and Dr. MacGregor next, while the Attorney-General ol Tasmania,
Mr. Dodds, occupied the other bench on the same side all to himself. On the front
left-hand bench sat Mr. Service with Mr. Dickson next to him, while Mr. Lee Steere
and Mr. Berry were vis a vis on the other seat. The preliminaries being despatched
and the lengthy proclamation read, Mr. Griffith in a graceful speech, expatiatory
of the foremost rank Mr. Service had always held in the cause of Federation,
proposed that gentleman as president, and Mr. Douglas seconding the proposition,
Mr. Service submitted himself to the feeling of the delegates and took the chair,
reading his inaugural address. The officers of the Council were then formally
appointed, and the formal announcement of the next day’s proceedings being made,
the meeting terminated.
The formal ceremony of opening the first session of the First Federal Council
of Australia was performed at noon on the 26th January, 1886, by His Excellency
Sir George Cummie Strahan, Governor of Tasmania. The sympathy which was
felt with the high aims and objects of the Council was testified by the crowded
state of the approaches to the Chamber where the Council was held.
The President (Hon. James Service) took the chair at 12 o’clock. All the
members were present as follows :—Victoria—Hon. Graham Berry ; Queensland —
Hon. S. W. Griffith, Q.C., Hon. J. E. Dickson; Tasmania—Hon. Adye Douglas,
Hon. J. S. Dodds; Western Australia —Hon. J. G. Lee Steere ; Fiji —Hon. Dr. W.
Macgregor, C.M.G. Shortly after, His Excellency having entered the Chamber and
congratulated Mr. Service on the high honour devolving upon him as president, read
his speech dealing with the fact that that Council had been convened owing to the
action of the colonies of Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, Fiji, and Western Australia
in having passed acts pursuant to the 30th section of “ the Imperial Enabling Act”
bringing the Imperial Act into force in those colonies, and expressing his regret at
the non-representation r of the important colonies of New South AVales, South
Australia, and New Zealand at that Council. The Council was then adjourned till
3 p.m. On re-assembling, in accordance with practice, prior to the proceeding with
constitutional functions, a bill pro forma was presented, entitled “A Bill to regulate
the Fisheries in Torres Straits,” subject to the jurisdiction of the Council. The
address in reply to the Governor was then framed and read. Mr. Griffith, in
moving the adoption of the address in reply, descanted on the importance of the
constitution and the consideration of the future action of the Federal Council. He
advocated the despatch of business with a wisdom, moderation, and perspicacity that
should not only justify the faith reposed in the Council by the colonies represented,
but prove to the others that had held aloof that the Federal Council could be trusted
not to usurp the functions of the local legislatures and undertake matters that the
local legislatures themselves would not undertake if they were allowed a free voice, or
to commit them to expenditure and a course of policy with which they might
disagree. He thoroughly concurred in the opinion that the time had not arrived for
an entire and complete legislative union of the Australasian colonies, but it was also
his opinion that such a time would be bound to arrive, and that at no distant date.
RESUME OE THE FIRST FEDERAL COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA.


The Act under which the Council was constituted particularly and unmistakably set
forth that undue interference with the internal economy of the several colonies was
not to be exercised, and it behoved the Council to be extremely cautious without being
abnormally timid in the action taken by it. His understanding of the functions and
position of the Council was, that it was a Parliament with extended powers and
jurisdiction, a jurisdiction beyond the merely territorial limits of the colony in which
it sat. The necessity of some such Parliament became obvious when it was
considered that occasion might arise for the enforcement of any common agreement
between colonies on matters relating to common action. The absurdity was
apparent of the inability of three or four colonies which had agreed on the
desirability of some action mutually beneficial, giving legal effect to their agreement
without soliciting the sanction of the Imperial Parliament, which was not always in
a position, amidst the multitude of its operations, to devote the time and attention
requisite for a speedy enactment. The formalities which had been observed at the
inauguration of the Federal Council, placed it beyond doubt that it was to be
considered a complete Parliament, and as such it would have the power vested in it to
act in many cases without waiting for the leisure of the Imperial Parliament,
or the convenience of Her Majesty’s Ministers. It was doubtless owing to the
misapprehension of the provisions of the Federal Council Bill as to the powers and
functions conferred on the Council that had raised much opposition, but the clear
definition of such functions in the 15th section of the Act, would materially allay any
scruples in that direction.
Specific conditions were laid down under which the Council had legislative
authority of its own, without the authority of delegates, and other conditions under
which it had no power to deal, save when asked to do so by the legislatures of the
other colonies. Deliberations on such matters as “the relations of Australia to the
islands of the Pacific,” “the treatment of escapees from New Caledonia,” and “fisheries
in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits,” would naturally have to be made
with a thorough regard to the desires and opinions of all the colonies concerned. It
could not for a moment be gainsaid that some amendment in the direction of the
service of civil process in colonies other than that in which it is issued, would be
mutually beneficial. It was questions of this description that would be dealt with by
the Federal Council. It would soon be found that the provisions of the Imperial Act
dealing with criminal process beyond the limits of the colony where issued were
insufficient, and, if so, the aid of the Federal Council would be invoked in dealing
with the whole subject. The other questions that would, as a matter of course, come
within the province of the Council were general defence, quarantine, patents for
inventions, copyright, bills of exchange, uniformity of weights and measures,
recognition of marriages and divorces, naturalisation of aliens, joint stock companies,
and any matters of general importance that might be required to be adjusted. The
imperative necessity for united action for general defence needed no dilation upon,
yet it would have to be borne in mind that the Council having no power over finance,
any general plan for defence would have to be considered by each separate colony, and


provision made for tlic defence maintenance by the legislature of such colonies. The
only point on which the Federal Council would act in that matter would be the
framing ol the law to which the military and naval forces would be amenable. The
entrustment of responsibility to any man or body, gave birth to an unreasonable
action now and again, but it was generally found that men or bodies, weighed down
with responsibility, did not make it a rule to act continuously in a reprehensible
manner, so that the advancement of that theory on the part of the oppositionists
would not hold water. The chief, or rather one of the chief difficulties that the
Federal Council would have to face would be the consideration of the naturalisation
ol aliens, and it would become all the more difficult in the face of the encouragement
in the introduction of the Chinese into one part of her territory by one of the
colonies. It would certainly be a mistake if, with the divergence of opinion that
existed with reference to colonisation by Chinese, the question was left to be dealt
with by the Council. Although the probability was that there would be no danger of
legislation on this point adverse to the views of the majority of the colonies, yet a
law passed by the Council if not in accord with one or more of them would entitle
them, under the 31st clause of the Act, to withdraw from the Federation. It was
sincerely to be trusted that South Australia, in view of the advantages to be gained
by her, would not defer her union with the federation much longer, and, as for New
South Wales, that colony would no doubt arrive at the conclusion that the advantages
to be gained by union would manifestly outweigh all disadvantages, and that her fears
on certain points were totally groundless. New Zealand was not altogether
unmindful ol the beneficial results of union, but had vouchsafed no reason lor holding
aloof. It should be one of the principal duties, not only of every member of the
Council, but of every one who had the interest of the further union of the Australasian
dominions at heart, to do all in his power to induce these colonies to join in the
movement. The Council’s line of action should be such as to prove that instead of
being a possible power for evil, it had great power for good, and that the probabilities
of its exercise of those for good would preponderate over the probabilities of the
exercise of its powers for evil.
Dr. MacGregor commended the restriction of an interference with the
management of the internal affairs of each colony. The independence and
advancement of the Australasian Colonies had been wholly stimulated by the
independence of the local legislatures. By the agency of the local legislatures a
greater number of able and competent men than could otherwise have been the case,
had been brought forward to take part in the administration of political affairs, and to
aid in those interests and industries which had been originated, fostered, and
developed by means of different political opinions. The greater Australasian colonies
had had representative institutions and local autonomy conferred on them at an
earlier period in their existence than had been the case in regard to any other
colonies, and it must be said that they had proved to be one of the greatest political
successes of ancient or modern times. Until the true functions and sphere of the
Federal Council had been more fully stated and understood, there would be a certain


number of people who, for some time, would look upon the Council with suspicion,
hut it would be seen before long that the Council was merely a cementing medium
connecting the legislatures of the colonies, and in combining the whole together,
'would ghe them a spirit of solidity and unity. Looking at the constitution of the
Council, ho could only express the very greatest regret that the important colonies
of New South A\ ales, South Australia, and New Zealand were not there represented.
He disputed the idea that the Council as then sitting represented less than one-half
the population and revenue of Australasia. Considering also that the majority of a
quorum would necessarily be very small, he expressed the advisability of the work
undertaken being of an unambitious character. He deprecated the idea being
entertained that his position, lie being a representative of a Crown colony, would be
an irresponsible one, since, although all his actions would be subjected to a close
scrutiny by the Colonial Office, he had been instructed by the representative of
Her Majesty in Fiji to further in every way any measure that seemed calculated to
conduce to the general welfare. In fact, his judgment had been left entirely
unfettered. He trusted that, notwithstanding the absence of representatives of the
colonies which had not joined the federation, the Council would be enabled to pass
some measures of such obvious and recognised usefulness that would be acknowledged
by all concerned, as useful to the colonies forming the federation, and yet
unobstructive or unobjectionable to the others. Fiji would regard with gratitude the
passing of the two bills prepared for submission, viz., the Extradition of Criminals
Bill and the Enforcement of Judgments Bill. In accordance with the previous
histories of the Australasian colonies, supplying unparalelled examples of grand
results from small beginnings, he felt convinced that with prudence and careful
management, that assembly, susceptible of development, would take its place
amongst the other great federated assemblies of the other parts of the world. Air.
Berry dealt at some length with the difficulties which usually stand in the way of
communities which, having a common interest, but also having local self-government,
agree to meet together in a form of federation. History had taught the lesson, that
in all similar institutions the federation of such communities had been brought about
when some disadvantage, some outside pressure, or some national danger had
exercised men’s minds, and taught them that union was the best means of self-
defence. Every historic incident taught that lesson, and it was probable that the
success attendant on the movement of Australian federation was not altogether free
from, or without that element. It had occurred to him that if anything was wanting
it was in the realisation of what might be regarded as the coming foreign relations
of this part of the world, the dealings with other countries, and matters dealing
with the future progress of Australasia as a whole. The policy of England, so far
as Australia was concerned, had been one of uniform kindness and generosity. It
was excusable to assume that whilst they were not perfect by the inclusion of all the
colonies, they represented the true Australian sentiment. Air. Dickson considered
that Council as the inauguration of the Greater Parliament of Greater Britain, and
the nucleus of the Federal Parliament of the future sent by all the colonies to


legislate on questions of general concern. That the Federal Council was the outcome
of no external menace or pressure was gratifying in the extreme.
The Address-in-Reply was unanimously adopted, and a message to the Queen,
as follows:—“ The Federal Council of Australia, at the inauguration of their
proceeding, desire to express their loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty’s throne and
person,” was agreed to. The President (Mr. Service) then acknowledged
congratulations which he had received, notably from the Australian Natives
Association, the Marriage Law Reform Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.
A committee, consisting of the President, Dodds, Lee Steere, MacGregor and Griffith,
was appointed for the preparing of standing rules and orders for the conducting of
business of the Council, and the Council adjourned to half-past eleven the next day.
When members assembled the next day, the President, accompanied by several
of the members and attended by the clerk and sergeant-at-arms, proceeded to
Government House, and presented to His Excellency the address of the Chamber in
reply to the Yice-Regal address on the previous day. His Excellency made a brief
reply, and stated also that he had communicated the loyal address of the Council to
Her Majesty by cablegram. Mr. Adye Douglas was elected Chairman of Committees.
It was agreed that the Council should meet daily at eleven o’clock except on Sundays.
A motion for an address to the Governor requesting the production of all despatches
and papers relating to the Council was agreed to. The following bills were introduced
and passed through their early stages, the second reading being fixed for the 29th: —
Definition of Terms used in Council, Civil Process Extension, and Proof of Acts
Facilitation. Mr. Berry gave notice to call attention to the position of the islands of
Samoa and Raiatea. The Council adjourned at 1 o’clock till next day. On the evening
of the 27th January, a dinner of a semi-private character was given by the President
(Mr. Service) at Hadley’s Rooms, at which about forty guests were present. The toast—
The Federal Council of Australia —furnished an opportunity to the Hon. N. J.
Brown, Minister of Lands, for a recapitulation of the functions of the Council, the
onerous responsibilities surrounding it, and the difficulties which weighed it down.
Mr. Douglas, on being asked to respond to the above toast in lieu of Mr. Service,
who was suffering from severe indisposition, gladly availed himself of the request,
inasmuch as he could then ventilate his views on the subject of federation, he not
having done so at the inaugural meeting. During the time that the subject of
Federation had been before the Parliament of Tasmania, he had not taken an
active part in it, and would much rather have had some one else represent Tasmania
in the Federal Council. His own views were not entirely the views of those who had
spoken in the Council on the previous day, and, perhaps, if he were guided entirely
by his own opinions, he would not altogether declare what his ideas were as to the
probable results of that Federal Union. He was convinced that in time the Council
would assume the importance and phase of the “United States,” and desire to become
independent of the mother country. Being the oldest colonist in Tasmania, and,
probably, the oldest colonist in the room, he would state that he had watched the
growth of the colonies for over fifty years. “Melbourne, when he arrived, was merely a


small village without a street, and without a decent house in it. The same could bo
said of Sydney, and, as for Brisbane and Adelaide, there were no such places. Now
they had become a great empire, which, at no distant period, would not be satisfied
with being under a hit of an island in the Northern Hemisphere, called Great
Britain.” He had not the scintilla of a doubt that separation from the mother
country must eventuate, as soon as a European war forced the colonies to consider
the question of their position. On being reminded by Mr. Service that the colonies
had had such a consideration thrust on them during the Soudan War, Mr. Douglas
continued: The Soudan had been all humbug, an ignis fatuus, a piece of bunkum,
which was not deserving of consideration. Forty years prior to that occasion he had
proposed the toast of “The Australasian Republic,” and he believed that he would
yet have the pleasure of repeating the sentiment. He quite agreed with many of the
views which had been expressed in the Council.
On the 28th January a debate ensued on Mr. Berry’s motion for further
information in regard to the present position of affairs in the islands of Samoa and
Eaiatea. On the 29th the Australasian Corporations Bill and the Federal Judgments
Bill were introduced and passed through their early stages. Mr. Griffith’s motion
for an address to the Governor on the subject of the deportation of relapsed criminals
to the French possessions in the Pacific was postponed. The adjourned debate on
the motion of Mr. Berry—“ That in the opinion of this Council it is desirable that
further information be obtained from official sources with respect to the present
position of affairs in the islands of Raiatea and Samoa,” to which the following
amendment had been moved by Mr. Griffith: —“ That an address be presented to the
Governor of Tasmania praying that His Excellency will be pleased to communicate
the foregoing resolution by telegraph to Her Majesty, and to cause to be laid on the
table of this Council such information as may be received by His Excellency,” was
next taken, and, after debate, the motion was agreed to. The Federal Council
Interpretation Bill and the Service of Process Bill were read a second time. The
Council adjourned at 12.30 till February Ist.
In discussing the means of communication with the Imperial authorities,
some doubts as to what the channel of such communication should be, were expressed,
but with one dissentient (Mr. Lee Steere), the Council decided that the making the
Governor of the colony where the Council was being held the channel, would not
only evince cautious action, but be in keeping with those beaten ways of
constitutional procedure with which the Council set out, and the value of which had
been so conclusively set forth by various members.
On February the Ist, the President brought down messages from the
Governor intimating his receipt of a cablegram from the Queen, acknowledging the
Council’s address of loyalty, and that he had telegraphed for further official
information with respect to the present position of affairs in the islands of Eaiatea
and Samoa. Mr. Griffith brought up the report of the Standing Orders Committee,
which was ordered to be printed. Mr. Griffith’s motion in regard to the production
of information on the subject of the proposed deportation of relapsed criminals to the


French possessions in the Pacific was discussed and agreed to. The Federal
Judgments Bill was read a second time, and referred to a select committee. The
Federal Council Interpretation Bill and Service of Civil Process Bill were considered
in Committee. The Federal Evidence Bill was read a second time and the Council
adjourned. On the 2nd, Mr. Dickson gave notice to move next day for the
appointment of a Finance Committee. Mr. Griffith tabled certain correspondence
with respect to the proposed separation from the colony of Queensland of a portion
ot the Northern District, which was ordered to be printed. The amendments in the
Federal Council Interpretation Bill were agreed to. The Australasian Civil Process
Bill was further considered in committee, and several amendments made. The
Federal Evidence Bill was passed through Committee with amendments, which were
ordered to be taken into consideration next day. A message was received from the
Governor transmitting in answer to the request of the Council the Blue Books
having reference to the action taken by the Imperial Government in regard to the
deportation of relapsed criminals to the French possessions in the Pacific. Mr.
Griffith moved the second reading of the Australasian Corporations Bill in a lengthy
speech, and the debate was then, on the motion of Mr. Dodds, adjourned till next
day. A lengthy debate took place at the afternoon sitting on the subject of the
defences of the colonies generally, on a motion of Mr. Lee Steere, in reference to
the protection of King George’s Sound and Princess Royal Harbour. The motion
was eventually carried. On the 3rd the Report of the Standing Orders Committee
was discussed and adopted. A Finance Committee was appointed. The Federal
Council Interpretation Bill and the Service of Civil Process Bill were read a third
time and passed. The amendments in the Federal Evidence Bill were agreed to,
and the third reading fixed for next day. The Australasian Corporations Bill was
read a second time, and the committee fixed pro forma for the sth. The Federal
Judgment Bill was passed through Committee. The New Guinea Question was
partly discussed, on a motion by Mr. Dickson, for the production of despatches and
papers, and eventually, on the motion of Mr. Berry, adjourned till next morning.
On the 4th, a message was received from the Governor stating that the resolution of
the Council in reference to the defence of King George’s Sound and Thursday Island
would be forwarded to the Secretary of State for the colonies for transmission to the
Queen. The President read a telegram he had received from the Agent-General for
Victoria in reference to an agreement between Germany and France on the subject of
their respective possessions in Africa and the South Seas, and it was referred to a
Select Committee to draw up an address to the Queen on the matter. The official
roll was laid on the table and signed by Hon. Members in alphabetical order, according
to the colonies represented. The Federal Evidence Bill and the Federal Judgments
Bill were read a third time and passed. Motions in reference to New Guinea
(adjourned debate) and Intercolonial Indemnification for losses in time of war were
agreed to after discussion. On the sth the reports of the Select Committee, appointed
to consider the annexation of the New Hebrides, and of the Finance Committee, were
brought up and adopted. A motion by Dr. MacGregor that the next meeting of the


Council be held at Hobart was agreed to, A standing committee, consisting of
Messrs. Griffith (chairman), Service and Douglas, was appointed. Mr. Dodds’
motion in regard to the establishment of an Australasian Court of Appeal and the
Committee on the Australasian Corporations’ Bill (the latter on the motion of Mr.
Griffith) were discharged from the paper. Mr. Douglas’ motion in regard to the
establishment of an Australasian Arsenal was discussed and withdrawn. A motion
by the same Hon. Member in regard to the rccidiviste question being remitted to
the standing committee to deal with, was agreed to. Messages were received from
the Governor forwarding papers on the New Guinea question, in connection with the
Council’s resolutions in regard to war indemnities, forwarding despatches in regard
to the first meeting of the Council and its constitution, and giving the Royal assent to
lour Bills passed during the session. Valedictory speeches were made by the
President and Mr. Griffith, and on Monday, the Bth February the first session of the
first Federal Council was prorogued by proclamation.
Although the first Council began and concluded its sittings unrepresented by
the three colonies of New South Wales, South Australia, and New Zealand, not one
of which stood out for any reason that really affected the principle of federation, it
is not at all improbable that long ere the second session shall have been held, the
problem of the precise manner in which federation shall be worked out will have
been solved by those colonies which, agreeing as to the necessity of federation, have
differed in their opinion as to the way in which it shall be effected. The objections
that were urged against the smallness of the number of members which constituted
the Council, are overborne by the fact that it can be increased at any time so as to
render it a thoroughly representative and weighty body. Having the procedure of
America as an example, when the Articles of Confederation were drawn up,
Australasia could elect to send a large number of representatives from
each colony, equalising the voting power so as to place all the colonies
on a level footing. The need for a Federated Council is put beyond
the shadow of doubt when it is considered that matters are daily arising
of such moment, involving the peculiar interests of each separate colony, and
still bearing on the whole, that they could not possibly be dealt with save by a
body representing them all, which would deal with them irrespective of local
considerations. This has been exemplified by the debates in the Council on
matters contained in this sketch. The great value of having general questions
discussed by men of unqualified experience, alive to the necessity of freeness
from the trammels of political pledges, and able to rise to the occasion by a
thorough setting aside of party warfare, has been indisputably determined by the
manner in which the subjects were debated. The desirability of such a Council is
further rendered necessary by the fact that the mere accretion of interests around it
renders it imperative for the securing of the safety and position of the colonies.
