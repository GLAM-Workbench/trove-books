ALSO A
CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT FROM A PRE-HISTORIC NEWSPAPER.
When the excavations for the new Law Courts were being made, the entrance to a
tunnel was discovered, running towards the West Melbourne swamp. An expert
workman entering the gloomy vault, hearing a rumbling noise, he rushed out,
dragging after him a curiously shaped bundle ; immediately after, with a crash the
tunnel collapsed, destroying every vestige of the entrance. The bundle was com-
posed of newspapers, strangely printed in an unknown language, but was easily
translated by the late Processor Fib. The advertisements in these pre-historic prints
ate similar to those now in the daily papers of this city, such as Time Payments for
Furniture, Pictures, Books, Pills, Heaping Machines, Medicine, Clothes,Printing, etc.
The publisher of the ?Bee?s Wing? series took the liberty of selecting (altering
only a few particulars) the following notice to the Public generally : [ P. T. O.

?UNIQUE? PRINTING OFFICE, POET?S CORNER,
Antiquarian, AEsthetic and Fine Art Repository, Lonsdale Street, W.
Established to supply a want long felt by the aesthetic
mind of this beautiful city, through which medium, (the
poet?s corner,) the poetic faculty in our foot-balling and
cricketing youth, may be encouraged and developed, and the
public get the benefit, by the gratuitous perusal in a neatly
printed form, effusions containing hosts of brilliant ideas
which would otherwise be lost to the world. It is true, the
newspaper press admit poetic trash to fill up space in their
columns, but no genuine, modest poet can stand the sight of
his rhymes stuck in the corner of a penny rag, to be used by
the butchers the same day to hold a paltry pound of sausages.
The poems and songs contributed, will be exhibited at the
?Corner,? and when of merit, sold at a nominal price, or dis-
tributed gratis for the enlightenment of mankind. As it is
acknowledged throughout the civilized world, the Melbourne
ladies are talented, pretty, clever and witty, it is expected
they will take a lively interest in, and send contributions to
the Poet?s Corner. Now then Ladies and Gentlemen, wake
up! wake up!! this is an opportunity never before offered to
the proprietors of eyes having a tendency to be in a state of
?fine frenzy rolling,? Here you will be listened to and
appreciated when you invoke the shining spheres of heaven,
the murmuring fountains, and the rushing streams, and when
you call upon the earth to hearken, and bid the wild sea
listen to your song, a secret chord will be touched within the
breasts of free-traders and protectionists alike, and slumber-
ing sympathy awakened in their lives, and the impulse of
hatred felt no more.
Professional and Amateur Artists supplied at the Poet?s Comer with works
on, and Materials necessary for the noble art of Painting. Their pictures
Exhibited and Sold on Commission if required. The Antiquarian , may
collect by exchange or purchase, curious old China, old Coins, old Snuff-
boxes, old Buttons, old Medals, old Postage Stamps, Autographs of eminent
men of pre-historic and historic times, old Swords, and ?Rusty aim caps and
jinglin? jackets,? and it may be ?a broomstick o?the witch of Endor weel
shod wi' brass,? and other curios too numerous to catalogue. The Aesthetic,
at the Poet?s Corner may languish over the curios and works of art, find
relief and surcease of sorrow from the agonies of composition and research
into ?quaint and curious volumes of Tong forgotten lore,? and on his return
to the forest glade, will enjoy all the more the seat on his favourite stump, a
wiser aesthetic, if not a better man.
The Critic and the Witty Man can have their Political and Social Squibs fired
from the Poet?s Corner, without paying-for the Powder?the expense for the Lead
only expected. The Public Generally can get new books for old, and old books for
new, or sell their old and buy the new. New philosophical lamps for old ones,facts
and fancies exchanged for other facts and fancies, bits of wisdom printed in small
space. Tracts and facts and picture scraps, for scrapbook and for album. Senti-
mental youth and lusty manhood, much given to burning the midnight oil over their
love letters, supplied with the requisite Stationery. The enterprising Manufacturer,
Merchant, and Trader will get Printing and Stationery cheap at the Poet?s Corner.


To Young Women.
"Man?s love is of man?s life a thing- apart, ?Tis woman?s whole existence.?
?Let still the woman take an elder than herself.?
In the spring of thy youth, in the morning of thy days, when the eyes of
men gaze on thee with delight?Ah! hear with caution their alluring words ;
guard well thy heart, nor listen to their soft seducements. Remember thou
art made man?s reasonable companion, not the slave of his passion; the end
of thy being is to assist him in the toils of life, to soothe him with thy tender-
ness, and recompense his care with soft endearments.
Who is she that winneth the heart of man, that subdueth
him to love, and reigneth in his breast? Lo! yonder she
walketh in maiden sweetness, with innocence in her mind,
and modesty on her cheek. Her hand seeketh employment;
her feet delighteth not in rambling abroad. She is clothed
with neatness; humility and meekness are as a crown of
glory circling her head. On her tongue dwelleth music; the
sweetness of honey floweth from her lips. Decency is in all
her words; in her answers are mildness and truth. Before
her steps walketh Prudence; and Virtue attendeth at her
right hand. Her eyes speaketh softness and love ; but
Discretion with a sceptre sitteth on her brow. The tongue
of the licentious is dumb in her presence; the awe of her
virtue keepeth him silent.
When scandal is busy, and the fame of her neighbour is
tossed from tongue to tongue, if charity and good nature
open not her mouth, the finger of silence resteth on her lip.
Her breast is the mansion of goodness; and therefore she
suspecteth no evil in others. She presideth in the house, and
there is peace; she commandeth with judgment, and is obeyed.
? The reason firm, the temperate will,
Endurance, foresight, strength and skill;
A perfect Woman, nobly planned,
To warm, to comfort, and command.?
The care of her family is her whole delight; to that alone
she applieth her studj ; and elegance with frugality is seen
in her house. The prudence of her management is an honour
to her husband; and he heareth her praise with silent delight.
She informeth the minds of her children with wisdom; she
fashioneth their manners from the example of her own good-
ness. In prosperity she is not puffed up; in adversity she
healeth the wounds of fortune with patience. The troubles
of her husband are alleviated by her counsels, and sweetened
by her endearments; he putteth his heart in her bosom, and
receiveth comfort. Happy is the man who has made her his
wife; happy is the child that calleth her mother ; but remem-
ber sweet lady, all that glitters is not gold.


To Young lien.
? Love is heaven, and heaven is love,? ?Married in haste, we may repent at leisure.?
Take unto thyself a wife and become a faithful member of society. But
examine with care, and fix not suddenly; on thy present choice depends the
future happiness of thee and thy posterity. If much of her time is destroyed
in dress and adornments, if she is enamoured with her own beauty, and de-
lighted with her own praise, if she laughed much, and talketh aloud, if her
foot abideth not in her father?s house, and her eyes with boldness rove over
the faces of men; though her beauty were as the sun in the firmament of
heaven, turn thy eyes from her charms, turn thy feet from her paths, and
suffer not thy soul to be ensnared by the allurements of thy imagination.
But when thou Andes t sensibility of heart joined with
softness of manners, an accomplished mind with a form agree-
able to thy fancy, take her home to thy house; she is worthy
to be thy friend, thy companion in life, the wife of thy bosom.
Oh! cherish her as a blessing sent thee by heaven! let the
kindness of thy behaviour endear thee to her heart. She is
the mistress of thy house; treat her therefore with respect.
Oppose not her inclination without cause ; she is the partner
of thy cares?make her also the companion of thy pleasures.
Reproye her faults with gentleness; exact not her obedience
with rigour. Trust thy secrets in her breast; her counsels
are sincere?thou shalt not be deceived.
When pain and sickness assault her, let thy tenderness
soothe her affliction ; a look from thee of pity and love shall
alleviate her grief, or mitigate her pain, and be of more avail
than ten physicians. Consider the delicacy of her sex, the
tenderness of her frame ; and be not severe to her weakness,
but thine own imperfection ; nevertheless forget
not ? Ihe ringlets of fair maids are chains for the feet of
reason, and a snare for the bird of wisdom.? A bad woman
in the house of a good man is hell even in this world. Take
care how you connect yourself with a bad woman. May the
Lord save you from the fiery trial.
Do not readily marry a hard-featured and dowerless
maiden. A Lawyer who could not persuade anyone to wed
his ugly daughter even with a considerable dower. At length
in despair of a better match, he married her to a blind man.
A few months afterwards, there came to the city a physician
from Melbourne, famed for his skill in restoring sight to the
blind. The lawyer?s friends advised him to have his son-in-
law operated upon by this celebrated doctor, but the prudent
father declined, saying??lf he should recover his sight he
would divorce his wife; the husband of an ugly woman
should be blind.? But who ever saw an ugly woman?

��&o&oa?s.
On Barwon?s flowery meadows and mazy, ferny groves,
For countless joyous summers our tribe has humm?d and roved;
Sipping the sweet nectar from the daisies and the fronds.
Contented in their hollow trees the dreary winter long.
While they enjoyed their liberty and hummed their lives away,
Without envy or ambition to spoil the glorious day,
But since the introduction of the sounding Xellehum,
Eestlessness and discontent has come from sun to sun.
By humming and with murmurings from the shades of Erceldoune.
The tribes in these sweet rustic dells having discovered and were practising
a new style of Cell architecture known only to themselves, and taught in
hidden hives and secret places under the name of free and accepted Mason
Bees. Our tribe anxious to get a knowledge of these secrets and hidden
mysteries, I rvas deputated to find them out at all risks. It was not with-
out fear and trembling ! presented myself at the door of the hive or lodge
Erceldoune, P. Q. No. 1882; over the entrance was written in great
antique letters 5
?Here enter not, religious boobies, sots,
Impostors, sniveling hypocrites, bigots ;
Dark-brain distorted owls, worse than the Huns
Or Ostrogots ; fore-runners of baboons ;
Curs d snakes, dissembling varlets, seeming sancts.
Slipshod caffards, beggars pretending wants;
Fomentors of divisions and debates,
Elsewhere, not here, make sale of your deceits.
Your filthy trumperies,
Stuff?d with pernicious lies.
(Not worth a bubble)
Would only trouble
Our earthly Paradise.
Your filthy trumperies,?
accepting this as an invitation to enter,l was refused permission, by a rusty
winged old bumble bee armed with a wasp?s sting, the scale of a herring
shining on his breast, and smelling strongly of the bitter herb Tobac. At
length a lively Bee came up, shaking his wingsYrom the dew, he hung them
on a peg in the porch, or entrance, and kindly offered there and then, to
make of me a mason. My initiation commenced with ;


THE INITIATION :
One of my legs being dipped into the white of a
locust?s egg, my wings tied, a gossamer thread with a
running noose slipped over my head, blindfolded with
a cobweb and my wallet emptied of its treasure, I
was then led to the door, which opened after the rusty
old bumble bee had made three backward movements
against it, then I was admitted with the point of the
wasp?s sting held to my now empty sweet bag, the
friendly Bee acting as my conductor, led me into what
seemed a large hive, the inmates appeared to be in, or
going to bed from the suppressed hummings I heard,
but on my entrance they at once wakened up, when a
number of sharp raps or taps were heard, as if by
stonebreakers commencing their days labor, I was
about to fly in terror, but my wings being tied and the
cobweb over my eyes, my conductor giving me a
kindly pat on the head I resigned myself to my fate
whatever it might be. I was commanded to bow three
times in honor of Harry-a-bif, Jackin-a-box, and
Boas-jes-man, the three head bummers of the Lodge,
I was then hauled up by three mason bees, to what I
afterwards discovered to be the throne of the Arch
Mason, one of them holding a red-hot darning needle
at a most uncomfortable distance from the locality
under my tail, I was then turned heels over head and
the red-hot instrument used handsomely in the brand-
ing operation in a manner I will not attempt to des-
cribe, my agony however was soothed by the application
of a drop of balmy dew from a cowslip; the cobweb
was then removed from my eyes, the thread from my
neck, and my poor wings set free, then decorated with
a white bib made from the skin of a mosquito which
I was to look upon as more honorable than a garter or
a pair of leather gaiters.
My sight being restored, my astonishment and
terror was renewed on beholding the Arch Mason
enthroned on an inverted tulip, with the wing of a
dragon-fly stuck on his head and spectacles on his
trunk, giving him the appearance of an ancient
Cockatoo, above his head, on an orange lily bracket lay
a glow worm throwing out a ?dim religious light.?


The second bummer was seated on a dodo, with a
snail?s horn in his paw, on which sat a fire-fly sending
out a spark now and then making the darkness visible,
at the other end of the lodge was the third bummer
sitting on a sprig of acacia, and beside him burned a
rushlight, stuck in the skull of a skeleton blow-fly,
while the pale moon glimmered through the dorma
disclosing the skull, back-bone and legs of a defunct
Phylloxera laying on henbane straw in a corner,
emblematical of the paradoxical.
At the Grand Master?s command I was ordered to
smell the three greater lights, and if I could not touch
the moon I might be moon-struck, not being able to
spring so high, but as a reward for my laudable attempt,
the leg of a newly slaughtered house-fly, the bleeding
flesh still quivering on the stump, was tied to my tail
and the attention of a hungry spider with a cable tow
tied to his leg held by a fellow craft, was directed to
the tempting bait, while I was being pulled round the
lodge by my conductor, the spider was let slip and
started in hot pursuit, in the second round he caught
hold of his prey, but left my poor tail ? scarce a
stump.? Once more by command I was prepared for
what was termed the heroic or equestrian ordeal, a
powerful cockroach was brought forth without saddle
or bridle, on which I was mounted, and had to gallop
round the lodge till we were both in a lather of sweat,
this was a hard task, in consequence of the raw marks
left by the red-hot darner on my seat of honor, I
managed however to keep up my pecker until both
cockroach and rider plunged into the half shell of an
hen?s egg filled with colonial beer, from which I was
dragged nearly drowned, with the nasty stuff, the chief
bummer, rising from his tulip throne, then advanced
with a ? gay and festive air? and declared me a duly
elected Bee mason, I was then asked if I firmly
believed in the jolly darning needle and the test of
beer and of fire, being instructed to answer in the
affirmative, in a plaintive voice I hummed out yes! I
was then lectured to on the chess board, and instructed
in the signs, tokens, and words that pass with Bee-
masons. Having adjusted my wings and paper collar.
I was then instructed to follow my leader into the


inner Temple, which I was now prepared to enter and
to participate in the secrets only divulged to the
iniatiated, and on my return my ability to respond to
a social test would be offered. Turning to the right
we went down one marble step underground, where
there was a landing place, there we were stopped
by the ghost of Rabelais, answering his sign, with a
merry twinkle in his left eye, he kindly requested us to
follow, then turning to the left, we went down two other
steps, where there was a resting-place: after that we
came to three other steps turning about, and met a
third; and the like at four steps which we met after-
wards. ?How many steps have you told?? asked our
merry tho? ghostly guide. ?One, two, three, four,? ans-
wered I. ?How much is that??asked he. ?Ten,? retur-
ed I. ?Multiply that,? said he, ?according to the same
pythagoricaltetrad? ?That is ten, twenty,thirty,forty,?
cried I. ?How much is the whole?? said he. ?One
hundred,? answered I. ?Add,? continued he, ?the first
cube, that is eight: at the end of the fatal number you
will find the temple-gate: and observe, this is the true
psychogony of Plato, so celebrated by the Royal-arch,
and by them only understood: one moiety of which
consists of the two first numbers full of two square
and two cubic numbers,? We then went down those
numerical stairs, all underground, and came to a portal
of fine jasper, of Doric order, on whose front we read
this sentence in the finest gold, ?Bee know thyself,? The
two folding doors of the gate were of Corinthian-like
brass, massy, wrought with little vine-branches, finely
embossed and engraven, and were equally joined and
closed together in their mortaise without any padlock,
key chain, or tie whatsoever. Where they joined, there
hanged an Indian loadstone as big as an Egyptian
bean, set in gold, having two points, hexagonal, in a
right line ; and on each side, towards the wall, hanged a
handful of scordium. There our illustrious ghost de-
sired us not to take it amiss? that he went no further
with us : for he himself was not allowed to go in, unless
in ghostly company, for certain causes rather to be con-
cealed than revealed to mortals, He would be there at
60, p.m. to-morrow, as the ghost of Hamlet?s Father
was engaged to wash and polish the floors of the Tern-


pie, as his term of night walking had not yet expired,
he is much cut up about his son Hamlet, Junior,
but the poor lad?s nose is sadly out of joint, and
says t?was curs?d spite, that he was ever born to
make it straight. One of your tribe is always in his
bonnet, and when his poor ghostly father lived in a
cellar, if he did not fork out enough to treat Ophelia
he would call the old ghost Bo;/! true-penny, old mole,
and other hard names. Tho? the ghost himself is well
known and highly respected, on and under the boards,
yet he prefers these odd jobs rather than the idle gossip
and silly mummeries of night seances. He then,
pulled the loadstone that hanged at the folding of the
gates, and throwed it into a silver box hung there for
the purpose : which done, from the threshold of each
gate he drew a twine of crimson silk about nine foot,
by which the scordium hanged, and having fastened it
to two gold buckles that hanged at the sides, vanished.
Immediately the gates flew open without being touch-
ed ; not with a creaking or loud harsh noise, like that
made by heavy brazen gates ; but with a soft pleasing
murmur that resounded through the arches of the
temple. We soon knew the cause of it, having dis-
covered a small cylinder or roller that joined the gates
over the threshold, and, turning like them towards the
wall on a hard well-polished ophites stone, with rub-
bing and rolling, caused that harmonious murmur.
I wondered how the gates thus opened of themselves
to the right and left, and after we got in, I cast my
eye between the gates and the wall, to endeavour to
know how this happened: for one would have thought
there had been put between the gates the herb sethiopis,
which they say open some things that are shut: but I
perceived that the parts of the gates that joined on the
inside were covered with steel; and just where the
said gates touched when they were opened, I saw two
square Indian loadstones, of a blueish hue, well
polished, and half a span broad, mortaised in the
temple wall. Now, by the hidden and admirable
power of the loadstones, the steel plates were put into
motion, and consequently the gates were slowly
drawn : however, not always, but when the said load-


stone on the outside was removed, after which the
steel was freed from its power, the two bunches of
scordium being at the same time put at some distance,
because it deadens the magnet, and robs it of its
attractive virtue.
On the loadstone that was placed on the right side,
the following iambic verse was curiously engraven in
ancient Roman characters:
? Ducunt volentem fata, nolentum trahunt.?
?Fate leads the willing, and th? unwilling draws.?
The following sentence was neatly cut in the load-
stone that was on the left:
?ALL THINGS TEND TO THEIR END.?
When I had read these inscriptions, I admired
the beauty of the temple, and particularly the dis-
position ot its pavement, with which no work that is
now, or has been under the cope of heaven, can justly
be compared: not that of the temple of fortune at
Praeneste in Sylla?s time; or the pavement of the
Greeks called asarotum, laid by Sosistratus in Perga-
mus. For this here was wholly in compartments of
precious stones, all in their natural colours, One of
red jasper, most charmingly spotted. Another of
ophites. A third of porphyry. A fourth of lycoph-
talmy, a stone of four different colours powdered with
sparks of gold, as small as atoms. A fifth of agate,
streaked here and there with small milk-coloured
waves. A sixth of costly chalcedony. And another
of green jasper, with certain red and yellowish veins.
And all these were disposed in a diagonal line.
At the portico, some small stones were inlaid, and
evenly jointed on the floor, all in their native colours,
to embellish the design of the figures ; and they were
ordered in such a manner, that you would have thought
some vine-leaves and branches had been carelessly
strewed on the pavement: for in some places they
were thick, and thin in others. That inlaying was
very wonderful everywhere: here were seen, as it were
in the shade, some snails, crawling on the grapes;
theie, little lizards running on the branches: on this
side were seen grapes that seemed yet greenish; on


another, some clusters that seemed full ripe, so like the
true, that they could as easily have deceived starlings,
and other birds, as those which Zeuxis drew.
I then cast my eyes on the roof and walls of the
temple, that were all pargetted with porphyry and
mosaic work; feeling giddy at the glorious sight, I
withdrew my eyes, and found myself face to face with
the Grand Master, who congratulated me on my newly
acquired knowledge.
I was then requested to stand treat, which I agreed to do, hut re-
membering at the door I had been deprived of my wallet of nectar, I
was unable till we got outside, when I poured the precious fluid on
a gum leaf which was very soon devoured; in return for my liber-
ality , I was told that at any time when I was short of the needful,
and met a brother, I had only to dip my trunk into his bag, help
m yself, and welcome; a sun or two after, having flown far and fared
hut poorly, I met on the wing, a fellow mason returning to his hive
m high glee, giving him the sign and password, I was about to pass
my thirsty neb into his bag of nectarine, but instead of a hearty
welcome and his asking as a brother how much I would require, he
?w as in such a hurry he could not tarry, darted off, telling me to
a PPIy to the lodge of Tribulation for the help he could not give.
This is what I have gained as yet by being a mason; nevertheless,
the principles of the craft are good, and its objects better; but Oh!
the red-hot darner is a caution.
?All the world?s a stage??Will we laugh or cry?

?Tis chill to stand in shirt and gaze,

WS?T cold up there ? But there I?m wrong,
M In nature there?s no up, nor down, circumference
Nor centre; just as there cannot be
A greatest number. Any number
However great, when added to, becomes a greater,
And any heighth, however high, above is higher.
And any depth, however deep, below is deeper.
Circumference, however wide, without is wider.
And consequently, there is no up, nor down.
Nor can there be a centre, where there is no
Circumference.
But as I said ? is?t cold ? where thou art.
How many marks in thy thermometer
Is zero under ours ?
Art thou a cold. Magnetic ray, or streak
Of icy vapor. Or art thou, a company
Of travelling aerolites ?
?Tis wrong to call thee visitor, or stranger.
For thou art of the Solar Commune like ourselves.
Nor dost thou wander, but faithfully
Traverse thy beat. Say, dost thou collar
Strayed Meteors, and drag them to the station house
The Sun. Or doth thy luminous pageant
Them draw along attached unto thy train.
As a parading Circus doth a crowd ?
Thou know?st a thing or two. Canst tell
Which end thy journey lies the Sun?
Thou know?st thy land-or star-marks.
And keep?st thy course, and time too.
Thou art not dull, as many think thee.
But up to business.
Say, do?st ever think to give up travelling.
And enter planetary life ? Thou might?st one day
Instead of ever rushing round, adjust an axis.
Revolve, thy tail wrap round thine head.
And so become another Saturn.
And settle into quiet work.
Thy tail would soon become a ring.
Tails often do, and rings are helps in business.
Ho think on?t. But tell me, how is?t
That when thou leav?st the Sun, thy tail?s ahead, [ling.
And head?s atail. Tail first is surely awkward travel-
How is?t not blown about? It may be calm
Where thou art, but the pace thou mov?st at.
Would make wind plenty, perhaps ti?s etiquette
In thy society, as ?tis here, to back out as thou dost.
From Royal presence.
So-long?l?m sleepy, make an entry
To call and chat when round next cent?ry.

SAINT ANDREW S DAY
IN YE EVENING
ljl 11 yy iinvj jx
?"�vvw
1. It came to pass, in the year one thousand eight hundred
and four score and two, in the merry City of Melbourne,
dwelt certain wise pien from a far country beyond the great
sea ; a ? land of brown heath and shaggy wood.?
2. (In that year the rulers of the city did not do that
which was right in the people?s eyes?open the library and
museum, nor water the streets on Sunday; nevertheless, our
Boss Comet, like a peacock, spreads his tail as usual, and
takes an airing on that morning, without asking leave).
3. Now* these wise men assembled themselves together,
and they said one to another, Go to, let us remember our
brethren whom we have left in the land of Scott and Burns.
4. For, behold, we be in a far country, and it shall come
to pass that men shall say of us, Ye be nameless on the earth;
ye have fled from the land of your nativity, because the land
of your nativity is poor in soil, though fertile in genius.
5. ??This thing, therefore, will we do, we will make a great
feast, so that the nose of whomsoever smelleth it shall tingle,
and we will call to mind the ancient days and the mighty
deeds of our fathers; before, and since the flood.
6. So they appointed a day, and many were gathered to-
gether?a mixed multitude from the Land of Cakes and of
Thistles, from the West and from the North, and from the
Isles of the Sea, also from the lands of the Shamrock and
the Rose, all stout upholders of the Education act.
7. And, behold, a great feast was prepared, and men in
black coats and cravats sae white ministered unto them, and
a ruler of the feast was appointed, and set in the midst.
8. And forthwith to each man was given a writing of the
good things of the feast, and the writing was in a tongue no
man could understand, for the, language was the language of
the Crapaud , which signifieth in the heathen tongue, either
a kult or a kangaroo.


9. And some there were who pretended to know the
writing and the interpretation thereof; now these were
hypocrites ; for they knew but six letters of the writing, and
these letters were HAGGIS, and even this much was as
great a mystery, as a timer ashet foo o? Cock-a-leeky.
10. And the dishes no man could number ; the people ate
mightily, as it were the space of one hour. And no man
spoke to his neighbour till his inner man was comforted.
11. And while they ate, behold, there drew near three
mighty men of valour, clothed in scant, but many coloured
garments; and in their arms ancient musical instruments.
12. And they blew mightily upon the pipes thereof, then
?Wild and hig-h the ?Cameron?s gathering? rose!
The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn?s hills
Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes; ?
How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills.
Savage*and shrill! But with the breath which fills
Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers
With the fierce native da ing which instils
The stirring memory of a thousanl ye irs,
And Evan?s, Donald?s fame rings in each clansman?s ears ! ?
13. And the hearts of the people were comforted, for in
music, much of their great strength lieth.
14. And wine was brought in vessels, but the children of
the North would none of these; for they quenched their
thirst with the cup that cheers?wi? a cinder in t � ult.
15. then spake the wise men of the congregation unto
them, and called to mind the ancient days and the mighty
deeds of their fathers, who rushed upon their country?s foes
?a bag o? oatmeal on their backs t?make brose,? with the
same energy and fearlessness, their descendants now control
the lightning, and the mighty steamship fabricate and guide.
16. Now it came to pass when they had eaten and drunken
greatly, even to the full, that the hinges of their tongues
were loosened?yea, even to the joints of their knees.
17. And the ruler of the feast fled to his home, and a third
part of the multitude followed, and a third part remained,
saying, ?We thirst;? and a third part rose up to play.
18. And they played and danced after the fashion of their
country, and their movements resembled the peregrinations
of a hen upon a griddle which is hot. Yet they seemed to
think it pleasant, for they shouted for joy.
19- Now, as for them that were athirst, behold their drink-
ing was steady, but their limbs were not so; yea, they also
shouted for joy and sang amazingly.


20. And they answered one to another and said, that not-
withstanding the crowing of the cock or the dawning of the
day, they should still partake of the juice of the barley. So
they encouraged one another with these words.
Now, it came to pass that, as they sat, one came and
said that he had seen a strange light in the sky, a protect-
ionist, said it was the k k K o m e t entering free of duty.
22. And some said. It is the moon; and others said, It is
the sun; and some said, Doth the sun rise in the west? and
others said, This is not the west, but the east; and some said,
Which is it? for we perceive two in the sky.
23. And one said I see nothing. Now the name of that
man was Blin Foo. He was the son of Fill Foo, and his
mothei s name was Haud Foo; and his brethren, Bung Foo,
Sing Foo, Greet 100, and lam Foo, were speechless.
24. Then each man bade his neighbour farewell, embracing
and vowing eternal friendship, a fierce freetrader was dragged
to the cave of Adullam by men in blue raiment, and some
were borne home in traps which jingled as they went; and
others drove their own chariots, and saw many strange sights
?for they found grass growing, and ditches in the midst of
the way where they had not perceived them before.
25. And it came to pass that in the morning many lament-
ed and took no breakfast that day; and the men in black
coats, and cravats sae white, and in some few cases, their
wives, brought unto them many cunningly-devised drinks,
yea, pick-me-ups, for their tongues clove to the roofs of their
mouths, and the spittle on their beard was like unto a small
silver coin, even a sixpence.
But when they thought of the previous day, they rejoiced
again, for the} said, Our brethren whom we have left will
hear of it at the feast of the New Year, and they will re-
member us and bless us, and our hearts and hands shall be
strengthened for our labour here, in this glorious country.

AND WHAT THEY SAID ANENT
SPIRITISM.
A PHARISEE
The parents had had the children?s beds removed into their bed-room, and
strictly enjoined them not to talk of noises even if they heard them. But
scarcely had the mother .seen them safely in bed, and was retiring to rest her-
self, when the children cried out. ?Here they are again!? The mother chid
them, and lay down. Thereupon the noises became louder and more start-
ling. The children sat up in bod. Mrs. Fox called in her husband. The
night being windy, it suggested itself to him that it might be the rattling 0 f
the sashes. He tried several, shaking them to see if thev were loose. Kate,
the youngest girl, happened to remark that as often as" her father shook a
window-sash the noises seemed to reply. Being a lively child, and in a
measure accustomed to what was going on, she turned to where the noise
was, snapped her fingers, and called out, ?Here, old Splitfoot, do as I do!?
The knocking instantly responded.
That was the very commencement and origin of Modern Spiritualism.

Scene : The Star Sirius in the Constellation Can us.
The Spirits of Lycurgus, Mahomet , and Adam Smith dis-
covered reclining on couches of ether.
Smith ??Letus talk. What do you think of this subject?
How are the conflicting claims of capital and labour to be
adjusted??
Lycurgus. ??By law.?
Mahomet ?? By the rulers. But what think ye of this
subject? Is the number of a man?s wives regulated by
climatic influences ??
Smith. ? � O, ye auld heathen, are ye thinking on that yet ??
Lycurgus. ??l have a question for debate. How far
should individual liberty be limited by the State ??
Smith. ?? Just as far as is beneficial to the nation.?
Mahomet. ?? The duty of the people is to believe, obey,
and?what a twinge in my left great toe! lam rapped for
at Constantinople by the Sultan.?
Lycurgus ?? There is a pricking in my right ear. Wilfred
Lawson wants me in London.?
Smith ?? What a dunt at my elbow! The Premier of the
Victorian Government wants me in Melbourne. We?ll meet
here when this hurry is over. (Exeunt omnes.)
Re-enter Smith ??Hech! if I was in the flesh, I would
say lam tired. I have been to the auld earth and back
again in fifteen minutes by Horologium. I could not have
done it sooner had I been on the broomstick of the Witch
of Endor. It?s quick travelling and no expense. Just think,
astronomers say it takes light, travelling at 192,000 miles a
second, twelve } ears to do the distance, and I have been
there and back in fifteen minutes. They?ve got telegraphs
round the earth since I was in the flesh, and brag of being
able, by and by, to put a girdle round the globe in forty
minutes, but that is standing still compared to my travel.
But here come auld Mahomet and Lycurgus. Weel, what?s
the news??
Mahomet. ??O, the Sultan?s in debt and trouble, since
his war with the Russian Bear, and wanted advice.?
Lycurgus ?? Wilfred Lawson wanted the best form of
law to prevent the consumption of exhilarating drinks.?
Smith. ?? And the Premier in Melbourne wanted my
opinion on another Land Bill. I told him to read my Wealth
of Nations.?


Lycurgus. ?? I advised Lawson to study the Roman laws.?
Mahomet. ??l said you have the Alcoran.?
Smith. ??We did quite right. It would be a gross breach
of the etiquette of the spirit spheres to interfere and advise
in human affairs. We, while in the flesh, thought, and wrote,
and left records of our conclusions; let them consult them
and also use their brains as we did ours.?
Lycurgus. ?? True, Adam, and if we allow this intrusion
on our retirement to go on, every merchant who wants to
speculate, and every politician who wants to draft a law will
order you and I to be in attendance at their elbows to give
advice, and it is the opinion of these mortals that if they
call we must go. It seems we are as much slaves at their
bidding as the devil?s imps are at his.?
Smith ?? You speak but truth, Lycurgus ; and Mahomet
here, who is considered a good judge of female flesh, will
shortly be called on by every man who wants to marry to
advise in choosing the bride. In fact,, there will neither be
rest nor peace for us. We shall not be able to call our time
our own. The boasted liberty and freedom of the spirit
sphere is being invaded, and will be crushed if we tolerate
the invasion. We may be called to London the one moment,
to Sydney the next, or to both places at the same time; and,
though it is not impossible for spirits on an emergency to
attend in two places at one time, still this work will come to
be harassing. But the impertinence of the creatures under
their new-fangled ideas annoys me most. They want to
know how we spirits employ ourselves. Just think of that
for curiosity. As if their puny minds had exhausted all
mundane subjects, and must, for mental employment, invade
these spheres. Mahomet, are you asleep ??
Mahomet ?1 was dozing; I feel tired.?
Smith. ?? Well listen. These mortals below asked me
how many houris you have to wait on you.?
Mahomet. ?? They did,by Allah ! The inquisitive slaves.
Curse them. We will foil the knaves. Let us separate, I
will ,go to Dubhe in Ursa; the Sultan will never think to
seek for me in the Great Bear.?
Lycurgus. ??Agreed; I?ll repair to Norma. I have some
laws to stud} r .?
Smith. ?? I?ll flee to Libra; I have some economic questions
I want to balance, and we?ll meet here every revolution of
Horologium, and compare notes.?? (. Exeunt omnes.)


Scene the Same.
Enter Mahomet. ?? By the Crescent! no one here.?
Enter Lycurgus and Smith.
Smith ?? You here first, auld Ma. Did the Bear turn
you out??
Mahomet ??No; but I was anxious not to miss this meet-
ing. Things are getting unendurable through these Spiritists ;
I?ve had no rest since I saw you. There are said to be thirty
millions of these Spiritists, and nine out of ten of them
wanted to talk with me about the war in Egypt?Moslems
don?t bother me about it. My right wing got so worn I
had to have it repaired, and it is not as it should be yet.
Something will have to be done to protect our peaceful enjoy-
ments from interruption and wrong by these scurvy mortals.?
Lycurgus ?? I have been harassed in the same manner.
Hunted up at all hours to advise on questions of international
law, and on legal points in the Turkish reforms, that I have
often wished I had nev�r died.?
Smith ?? And I have been pestered. This bit of dis-
turbance between the Czar and the Nihilists and the state of
Turkey is making many anxious about consuls and bonds,
and stocks, on which they all wanted my advice. In fact,
one fellow wanted to know on which horse he should bet for
the next Derby. Hang his impudence! Of course I en-
lightened none of them.?
Lycurgus and Mahomet ?? Nor did we.?
Smith. ??l knew you would not. But what think ye I
learned when I was down. This Spiritism is turning the
brains of many so topsy-turvy that in America alone there
are 10,000 lunatics through it. Now, when these die, and
their spirits come to these spheres, there will be no peace,
even in this retirement, with these lunies rambling about, and
peaceable, sensible spirits like ourselves will have no quiet
for meditation. We must have some protection, and, failing
that, I have been studying another remedy, namely, the
transmigration of souls, and intend returning to earth, where
again in the flesh I shall at least have the protection of the
law and police against annoyance.?
Mahomet ?? Not a bad idea. I fancy I would feel young
again were I in Turkey now.?
Lycurgus ??There is an inexorable law against it.?
Smith. ?? Well, we?ll see about that at our next meeting.?
{Exeunt omnes.)

DEBTORS AND BORROWERS.

? My poverty, but not my will consents."
? If only poverty keep from my door.
Unlovely poverty, I ask no more.
The ship I sail in may be large or small,
?Twill carry me, and that is all in all.
Fair winds we may not have, nor swelling sails.
Yet neither have we always adverse gales.
In strength, in worth, in influence, powers of mind.
In rank or fortune though I come behind
The very foremost, many yet there be
That in their turn come lagging after me.?
? Labour conquers debt and poverty."
But, ? when will you be out of debt ? ? At the ensuing term
of the Greek calends, (that is, never.) when all the world shall
be content. The lord forbid that I should be out of debt,
as if, indeed, I could not be trusted. Who leaves not some
leaven over night, will hardly have dough the next morning.
Be still indebted to somebody, that they may be always pray-
ing for you; that the giver of all good things may grant unto
you a blessed,long, and prosperous life: fearing if fortune
should deal crossly with you, it might be his chance to come
short of being paid by you; he will always speak good of you
in every company, ever and anon purchase new creditors unto
you; to the end that through their means you may make a
shift by borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, and with other
folks? earth fill up his ditch. Believe me, your creditors with
fervent devotion will wish to prolong your life, they being of
nothing more afraid than that you should die: for that they
are more concerned for the sleeve than the arm, and love the
penny better than their own lives. In this only respect and
consideration of being a debtor, esteem myself worshipful,
reverend and formidable. For, against the opinion of most
philosophers, that of nothing ariseth nothing ; yet out of no-
thing become such a maker and creator, that I have created,
what ? a gay number of merry creditors. Nay, creditors, I
will maintain it, are fair and goodly creatures. Who lendeth
nothing is an ugly and wicked creature, an imp of auld Clootie.
And there is made, ?what; Debts, a thing most precious and
dainty, of great use and antiquity. Debts, I say, surmounting
the number of syllables which may result from the combin-
ation of all the consonants with each of the vowels, heretofore
projected, reckoned and calculated. To judge of the perfect-


3
iou of debtors by the numerosity of their creditors, is the
readiest way for entering into the mysteries of arithmetic.
You can hardly imagine how glad I am, when every
morning I perceive myself environed and surrounded with
brigades of creditors; humble, fawning and full of their
reverences : and whilst I remark, that as I look more favour-
ably upon, and give a more cheerful countenance to one than
another, the fellow thereupon buildeth a conceit that he shall
be the first despatched, and the foremost in the date of pay-
ment; and he valueth my smiles at the rate of ready money.
These are my flatterers, my soothers, my clawbacks, my
smoothers, my parasites, my saluters, my givers of good
morrows, and perpetual orators; which makes me verily think,
that the supremest height of heroic virtue consisteth in being
a debtor. Which dignity, though all human creatures seem
to aim at, and aspire thereto, few nevertheless, because of the
difficulties in the way, and incumbrances of hard passages, are
able to reach it; as is easily perceivable by the ardent desire
and vehement longing harboured in the breast of every one,
the Victorian Government equally with others, to be still
creating more debts, and more creditors. Yet it doth not lie
in the power of every one to be a debtor. To acquire
Creditors is not at the disposure of each man?s arbitrament.
I have all my life-time held debt to be as a union or con-
junction of the heavens with the earth, and the whole cement
whereby the race of mankind is kept together ; yea, of such
virtue and efficacy, that, I say, the whole progeny of Adam
would very suddenly perish without it. Therefore, perhaps,
I do not think amiss, when I repute it to be the great soul of
the universe. In conformation whereof, that you may the
better believe it to be so, represent unto yourself, without any
prejudice of spirit, in a clear and serene fancy, the idea and
form of some other world than this ; wherein it is to be
supposed there is no debtor or creditor, that is to say, a world
without debts. There amongst the planets will be no regular
course. All will be in disorder. Jupiter reckoning himself
to be nothing indebted unto Saturn, will go near to detrude
him out of his sphere. Saturn no doubt, combining with
Mars, will reduce the world into a chaos of confusion.
Mercury then would be no more subjected to the other
planets; he would scorn to be any longer their Camillus, as
he was of old termed in the Hetruian tongue : for it is to be
imagined that he is in no way a debtor to them. Venus will
be no more venerable, because she shall have lent nothing.


The moon will remain bloody and obscure: for to what end
should the sun impart unto her any of his light ? He owed
her nothing. Nor yet will the sun shine upon the earth, nor
the stars send down any good influence; because the terres-
trial globe hath desisteth from sending up their wonted
nourishment by vapours and exhalations, wherewith they were
cherished and alimented. There would likewise be in such
a world no manner of symbolization, alternation, nor trans-
mutation amongst the elements; for the one will not esteem
itself obliged to the other, as having borrowed nothing at all
from it. Earth then will not become water; water will not
be changed into air; of air will be made no fire, and fire will
afford no heat unto the earth; the earth will produce nothing
but monsters, Titians, giants; no rain will descend upon it,
nor light shine thereon ; no wind will blow there, nor will
there be in it any summer or autumn. Lucifer will break
loose, and issuing forth accompanied with his furies, fiends,
and horned imps, will go about to unnestle and drive the
money lenders out of their dens. Such a world without
lending, will be no better than a dog-kennel, a place of
contention and wrangling, unruly and irregular, a devil of a
hurly-burly. Men will not then salute one another; it will be
but lost labour to expect aid or succour from any, or to cry,
?Fire, water, murder;? for none will put to their helping hand.
Why? He lent no money; there is nothing due to him.
Nobody is concerned in his burning, in his shipwreck, in his
ruin, or his death ; and that because he hitherto had lent no-
thirig, and would never thereafter have lent anything. In
short, faith, hope and charity would be quite banished from
such a world; for men are born to relieve and assist one
another: and in their stead would succeed and be introduced
defiance, disdain and rancour, with the most execrable troop
of all evils, all imprecations and all miseries. Men unto men
will be wolves, hobthrushers and goblins, plunderers, highway-
robbers, cut-throats, rapperees, murderers, poisoners, assassin-
ators, lew r d, wicked, malevolent, pernicious haters, set against
everybody, like to Ismael, Metabus, or Timon the Athenian,
who for that cause was named Misanthropos; in such sort,
that it would prove much more easy in nature to have fish
entertained in the air, and bullocks fed in the bottom of the
ocean, than to support or tolerate a rascally rabble of people
that will not lend. These fellows, I vow, do I hate with a
perfect hatred; and if, conformable to the pattern of this
grievous, peevish and perverse w'orld, which lendeth nothing,


you figure and liken the little world, which is man, you will
find in him a terrible jostling coyle and clutter. The head
will not lend the sight of his eyes to guide the feet and
hands; the legs will refuse to bear up the body; the hands
will leave off working any more for the rest of the members;
the heart will be weary of its continual motion for the beat-
ing of the pulse, and will no longer lend his assistance; the
lungs will withdraw the use of their bellows; the liver will
desist from conveying any more blood through the veins, for
the good of the whole; the bladder will not be indebted to
the kidneys, so that the urine thereby will be totally stopped.
The brains, in the interim, considering this unnatural course,
will fall into a raving dotage, and withold all feeling from the
sinews, and motion from the muscles. Briefly, in such a
world, without order and array, owing nothing, lending no-
thing, and borrowing nothing, you would see a more danger-
ous conspiration than that which TSsop exposed in his apologue.
Such a world would perish undoubtedly; and not only perish,
but perish very quickly.
BORROWERS AND LENDERS.
? To thy friend be kind,
And with thy neighbours gladly lend and borrow:
His chance to-night, it may be thine to-morrow."
On the contrary, be pleased to represent unto your fancy
another world, wherein every one lendeth, and every one
oweth, all are debtors, and all creditors. O how great will
that harmony be, which shall thereby result from the regular
motions of the heavens ! Methinks I hear it every whit as
well as ever Plato did. What sympathy will there be
amongst the elements ! O how delectable then unto nature
will be her own works and productions! Whilst Ceres
appeareth loaden with corn, Bacchus with wines, Flora with
flowers, Pomona with fruits, and Juno fair in a clear air,
wholesome and pleasant. Then will among the race of man-
kind peace, love, benevolence, fidelity, tranquillity, rest,
banquets, feastings, joy, gladness, gold, silver, small money,
chains, rings, with other ware, and chaffer of that nature be
found to trot from hand to hand; no suits at law, no wars, no
strife, debate, nor wrangling: none will be there an usurer,
none will be there a pinch-penny, a scrape-good wretch, or
churlish-hearted refuser. Will not this be the golden age,
wherein, all other virtues ceasing, charity alone ruleth,
governeth, domineereth and triumpheth ? All will be fair and


goodly people there, all just and virtuous. O happy world !
O people of that world most happy! Yea, thrice and four
times blessed is that people; I think in very deed that lam
amongst them. Consider, I pray you, how the noble Patelin,
having a mind to deify, and extol even to the third heavens,
the father of William Johnson, said no more but this: ?And
he did lend his goods to those who were desirous of them.?
O the fine saying! Now let our microcosm be fancied
conformable to this model in all its members; lending,
borrowing and owing, that is to say, according to its own
nature: for nature hath not to any other end created
man, but to borrow and lend: no greater is the
harmony amongst the heavenly spheres, than that which shall
be found in its well-ordered policy. The intention of the
founder of this microcosm is, to have a soul therein to be
entertained, which is lodged there, as a guest with its host,
that it may live there for a while. Life consisteth in blood;
blood is the seat of the soul: therefore the chiefest work of
the microcosm, is, to be making blood continually. At this
forge are exercised all the members of the body: none is
exempted from labour; each operates apart and doth its
proper office. And such is their hierarchy, that perpetually
the one borrows from the other, the one lends the other, and
the one is the other?s debtor. The stuff and matter conven-
ient, which nature giveth to be turned into blood, is bread
and wine. All kind of nourishing victuals is understood to
be comprehended in these two, and from hence in the Langue
Goth is called the coampanage. To find out this meat and
drink, to prepare and boil it, the hands are put to work, the
feet do walk and bear up the whole bulk of the corporal mass ;
the eyes guide and conduct all; the appetite, in the orifice of
the stomach, by means of a little sourish black humour,
called melancholy, which is transmitted thereto from the milt,
giveth warning to shut in the food. The tongue doth make
the first essay, and tastes it; the teeth do chew it, and the
stomach doth receive, digest and chilify it; the meseraic
veins suck out of it what is good and fit, leaving behind the
excrements, which are, through special conduits for that
purpose, voided by an expulsive faculty: thereafter it is
carried to the liver, where it being changed again, it, by the
virtue of that new transmutation, becomes blood.
What joy, conjecture you. will then be found amongst those
officers, when they see this rivulet of gold, which is their
No greater is the joy of alchymists, when,


after long travel, toil and expense, they see in their furnaces
the transmutation. Then is it that every member doth pre-
pare itself, and strive anew to purify and refine this treasure.
The kidneys, through the emulgent veins, draw that aquosity
from thence which you call urine, and there send it away
through the ureters to be slipt downwards ; where, in a lower
receptacle, and proper for it, to wit, the bladder, it is kept, and
stayeth there until an opportunity to void it out in his due
time. The spleen draweth from the blood its terrestrial part
viz., the grounds, lees, or thick substance settled in the bottom
thereof, which you term melancholy. The bottle of the gall
subtracts from thence all the superfluous choler; whence it
is brought to another shop or workhouse to be yet better
purified and fined, that is the heart, which, by its agitation of
diastolic and systolic motions, so neatly subtilizeth and
inflames it, that in- the right side ventricle it is brought to
perfection, and through the veins is sent to all the members:
each parcel of the body draws it then unto itself, and after its
own fashion is cherished and alimented by it : feet, hands,
thighs, arms, eyes, ears, back, breast, yea, all; and then it is
that who before were lenders, now become debtors. The
heart doth in its left-side ventricle so thinnify the blood, that
it thereby obtains the name of spiritual 5 which being sent
through the arteries to all the members of the body, serveth
to warm, and winnow, or fan the other blood which runneth
through the veins. The lights never cease with its lappets
and bellows to cool and refresh it; in acknowledgment of
which good the heart, through the arterial vein, imparts unto
it the choicest of its blood. At last it is made so fine and
subtle within the rete mirable, that thereafter those animal
spirits are framed and composed of it 3 by means whereof
the imagination, discourse, judgment, resolution, deliberation,
ratiocination and memory have their rise, actings, and oper-
ations.
Goodness gracious ! I sink, I drown, I perish, I wander
astray, and quite fly out of myself, when I enter into the con-
sideration of the profound abyss of this world, thus lending,
thus owing. Believe me, it is a divine thing to lend sto owe,
an heroic virtue. Yet is not this all; this little world thus
lending, owing, and borrowing, is so good and charitable,
that no sooner is the above-specified alimentation finished, but
that it forthwith projecteth, and hath already forecast, how it
shall lend to those who are not as yet born, and by that loan
endeavour, what it may, to eternize itself, and multiply in


images like the pattern, that is, children. All this is done by
loans and debts of the one unto the other ; and hence have
we this word, the debt of marriage. Nature doth reckon
pain to the refuser, with a most grievous vexation to his
members, and an outrageous fury amidst his senses. But on
the other part, to the lender, a set reward, accompanied with
pleasure, joy, solace, mirth and merry glee.
? Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry .?
I UNDERSTAND you very well,?? quoth the industrious
man ? and take you to be very good at topics, and thoroughly
affectioned to your own cause : but preach it up, and patrocin-
ate it 5 prattle on it, and defend it as much as you will, even
from hence to the next Cup day, if you please so to do; yet
in the end will you be astonished to find how you shall have
gained no ground at all upon me, nor persuaded me by your
lair speeches and smooth talk to enter ever so little into the
thraldom of debt. ? You shall owe to none,? saith the apostle,
1 anything save love, friendship, and a mutual benevolence.
You serve me here, I confess, with fine graphides and diaty-
poses, descriptions and figures, which truly please me very
well : but 1 am fully confirmed in the opinion, that the
Persians erred not when they said, ? That the second vice was
to lie,?the first being that of owing money. For in very
truth, debts and lying are ordinarily joined together. I will
nevertheless not from hence infer, that none must owe any-
thing, or lend anything. For who so rich can be, that some-
times he may not owe ? or who can be so poor, that sometimes
he may not lend ? Let the occasion notwithstanding in that
case, as Plato very wisely saith, and ordaineth in his laws, be
such, that none be permitted to draw any water out of his
neighbour?s well until first, they by continual digging and
delving into their own proper ground, and there had found no
Source or drop of water. In good sooth, it is a great shame
to chuse rather to be still borrowing in all places from every
one, than to work and win. Then only in my judgment
should one lend, when the diligent, toiling and industrious
person is no longer by his labour to make any purchase unto
himself; or otherwise, when by mischance he hath suddenly
fallen into an unexpected loss of his goods. Howsoever let
us leave this discourse, and from benceforwards do not hang
upon creditors, nor tie yourself to them.

HEPSIDAM!
A SERMON.
TEXT?They shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the mountains of
Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth , and the wang-doodle
mourneth for its first-horn."
My Beluved Brethering ?l?m an unlarnt Hard-shell
Baptist preacher of whom you?ve no doubt hearn afore ; and
now I appear here to expound the Scriptures, and pint out
the narrow way which leads from a vain world to the streets
of Jeroosalem ; and my tex, which I shall choose for this
occasion, is in the leds of the Bible somewhar between the
second Chronik-ills and the last chapter of Timothy Titus;
and when you find it you?ll find it in these words; ?And
they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the mountains of
Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth, and the wang-doodle
mourneth for its first-born.?
Now, my Brethering, as I have before told you I am an
oneddicated man and know nothing about grammar talk and
collidge hi-faluting, but I am a plane, unlarnt preacher of
the Gospil,'what?s been foreordained and called to prepare a
pervarse generation for the day of wrath?ah ! ?For they
shall gnaw a file and flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam,
whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for its
first-born.? ?ah!
My beluved Brethering, the tex says they shall gnaw a file.
It does not say they may, but shall. Now there is more
than one kind of file. There?s the handsaw file, the rat tail


2
file, the single file, the double file, and profile; but the kind
spoken of here isn?t one of them kind nayther, bekaws it?s a
figger of speech, and means going it alone and getting
ukered :??For they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the
mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-
doodle mourneth for its first-born ??
And now there be some here with fine close on thar backs,
brass rings on thar fingers, and lard on thar har what goes it
while they?re young ; and thar be others here what as long
as their constitooshins or forty cent whisky last, goes it blind.
Thar be sisters here what, when they get sixteen years old,
cut thar tiller ropes and goes it with a rush. But I say my
dere brethering, take care you don?t find, when Gabriel blows
his last trump, your hands played out and you?ve got ukered.
?ah ! ?For they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the
mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-
doodle mourneth for its first-born.?
Now my Brethering, ? they shall flee unto the mountains
of Hepsidam,? but thar?s more dams than Hepsidam. Thar?s
Rotter-dam, Had-dam, Amster-dam and Don?t care-a-dam?
the last of which, my Brethering, is the worst of all, and re-
minds meof a sirkumstans I onstknowed in the state of Illen-
oy. Thar was a man which built him a mill on the north fork
of the Ager Crick, and was a good mill and ground a sight
of grain, but the man which built it was a miserable sinner,
and never gave anything to the church 5 and, my dere
Brethering, one night thar cum a dredful storm of wind and
rain, the mountains of the great deep was broke up, and the
waters rushed down and swept that man?s mill-dam to
kingdam-cum, and when he woke up he found he wasn?t
worth a dam ?ah ! ?For they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto
the mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth, and the
wang-doodle mourneth for its first-born?? ?ah !
I hope I don?t hear anybody larfin ; do I ? Now, ?whar
the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for its first-
born ? ?ah ! This part of ray tex, my beseaching brethrering,
is not to be taken as it says. It don?t mean the howling
wilderness whar John the hardshell Baptist fed on locusts
and wild asses 3 but it means my Brethering, the city of
New Y?Orleans, the mother of harlots and hard lots, whar
corn is wuth six bits a bushel one day and nary a red the nex;
whar niggers are as thick as black bugs in spiled bacon ham,
and gamblers, thieves and pickpockets goes skitting about the


streets like weasels in a barn-yard ; whar honest men are
scarcer than hen?s teeth : and whar a strange woman once
took in your beluved teacher, and bamboozled him out of
two hundred and twenty seven dollars in the twinkling of a
lamb?s tail; but she can?t do it again ! Hallelujah ?ah ! ?For
they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the mountains of
Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle
mourneth for its first-born???ah !
My brethering, 1 am captain of that flat-boat you see tied
up thar, and have got aboard of her flour, bacon, taters, and as
good Monongahela whisky as ever drunk, and am mighty
apt to get a big price for them all; but what, my dere
Brethering, would it all be wuth, if I hadn?t got religion ?
Thar?s nothing like religion, my Brethering : its better nor
silver or gold gimcracks, and you can no more get to heaven
without it, than a jaybird can fly without a tail?ah ! Thank
the Lord ! I?m an oneddicated man, my Brethering ! but I?ve
sarched the Scriptcrs from Dan to Beersheba, and found Zion
right side up and hard-shell religion the best kind of religion?
ah ! ?Tis not like the Methodists, what spects to get to
heaven by hollerin' hell-fire ; not like the Universalists, that
get on the broad gage and goes the hull hog?ah ! not like
Yewnited Brethering, that takes each other by the slack of
thar breeches and hiscs themselves in ; nor like the Kather-
licks, that buys threw tickets from their priests ; but it may
be likened unto a man what has to cross the river?ah !?and
the ferry boat was gone; so he tucked up his breeches ?and
waded across ?ah ! ?For they shall gnaw a file, and flee
unto the mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and
the wang-doodle mourneth for its first born.?
Pass the hat, Brother Flint, and let every Hard shell
Baptist fork out.
THE THREE-FOOT RULE.
When I was bound apprentice, and learned to use my hands,
Folk never talked of measures that came from foreign lands;
Now Fm a British workman, too old to go to school;
So whether the chisel or file I hold, I?ll stick to my three-foot rule.
Some talk of millimeters, and some of kilogrammes,
And some of deciliters, to measure beer and drams.
But Fm a British workman, too old to go to school;
So by pounds I?ll eat, and by quarts I?ll drink, and I?ll work by my
three-foot rule.
A party of astronomers went measuring, the earth,
And forty million meters they took to be its girth;


Five hundred million inches, though, go through from pole to pole;
So let us stick to inches, feet, and yards, and the good old three-foot rule.
The great Egyptian pyramid?s a thousand yards about,
And when the masons finished it they raised a joyful shout;
The chap that planned that building, I?m bound he was no fool,
And now ?tis proved beyond a doubt he used a three-foot rule.
Here?s a hint to every learned man that goes by common sense,
And would not plague the working man on any vain pretence;
But as for those philanthropists which sends us back to school,
Oh bless their eyes, if ever they tries to put down the three-foot rule.
MISS HARPER?S TROUBLES Ah Men.
I am a Christian woman, I wish you all to know
That every Sunday, morn and eve, to church I always go ;
I love to listen to the singing, the praise, the lovely prayer,
But there's one thing I do not like, and that I always hear:
When the minister is praying for the salvation of each soul,
That each one may go to heaven with hearts so pure and whole j
Just when he is praying, ?Lord deliver us from sin,?
That stupid, stupid man breaks in, ?Ah men ! Ah men !?
Ah men ! Ah men ! I fancy I can hear it now.
The same as when o?er the pew our heads in prayer we bow.
Although I am past thirty, to you I?ll own, [son.
Once I wouldn?t mind if I?d said yes, to old Will Thornbey?s
Ah men ! this is reversing the stories we?ve been told, [old,
That Eve was the cause of all sin, when tempted by Satan of
But now, thank the Lord, she is cleared of this sin,
For do they not say when sin is mentioned, Ah men! Ah men!
The reason why I do not like this man, to you I?ll tell,
When the minister is praying, ?Lord, may we kept from hell,
And that we always may be good, and do not any sin,?
This man in deep, solemn tones breaks in,?Ah men! Ah men!?
Now, although I say it myself, I am a virtuous spinster.
And listen attentively to all that is said by the minister - y
But I do not believe when they come to the word sin,
That they should blame it on to the men, Ah men !
People often ask me how ?tis I never got married,
That why till the Autumn of life I have tarried ;
The reason, I assure you, was not for the want of beaux,
For of them, at one time I had plenty, as everyone knows ;
But in the bible I had read, ?Man?s heart above all things,
Was desperately wicked 3 that loving him often sadness brings.?
Foolishly then I believed to love one would be a sin.
But alas ! since then 1 have sighed for the men. Ah men,

GOODWIN SANDS:
BY BISHOP LATIMER,
BORN, 1475, BURNT, 15.5.5.
We be many preachers here in England, and we preach many
long sermons, yet the people will not repent nor convert.
This was the fruit, the effect, and the good, that his (Jonas?s)
sermon did, that all the ?tfhole city at his preaching converted,
and amended their loose living, and did penance in sackcloth.
And yet here in this sermon of Jonas is no great curiousness,
no great clerkliness, no great affectation of words, nor painted
eloquence: it was none other but, adhuc quadraginta dies et
Nineve suhvertetur : Yet forty days, Nineve suhvertetur, and
Ninevy shall be destroyed 5 it was no more. This was no
great curious sermon, but this was a nipping sermon, a pinch-
ing sermon, a biting sermon; it had a full bite, it was a
nipping sermon, a rough sermon, and a sharp biting sermon.
Do you not here marvel that these Ninevites cast not
Jonas in prison, that they did not revile him, nor rebuke him.
But God gave them grace to hear him, and to convert and
amend at his preaching, A strange matter, so noble a city,
to give place to one man?s sermon. Now, England cannot
abide this (stuff, matter,) they cannot be content to hear
God's minister, and his threatening for their sins, though the
sermon be never so good, though it be never &o true. It is a
naughty fellow, a seditious fellow 5 he maketh trouble and
rebellion in the realm, he lacketh discretion.
Here is now an argument to prove the matter against the
preachers. Here was preaching against covetousness all (he
last year in Lent, and the next summer followed rebellion :
Ergo preaching against covetousness was the cause of the
rebellion ?a goodly argument. Here now I remember an
argument of master Moore?s, which he bringeth in a book
that he made against Bilney; and here by the way I will tell
you a merry toy. Master Moore was once sent in commission
into Kent, to help to try out fif it might be) what was the
cause of Goodwin Sands, and the shelf that stopped up Sand-


wich haven. Thither cometh master Moore, and calleth the
country afore him, such as were thought to be men of exper-
ience, and men that could of likelihood best certify him of
that matter concerning the stopping of Sandwich haven.
Among others came in before him an old man, with a white
head, and one that was thought to be little less than a hun-
dred years old. When master Moore saw this aged man, he
thought it expedient to hear him say his mind in this matter
(for being so old a man, it was likely that he knew most of
any man in that presence and company). So master Moore
called this old aged man unto him, and said; Father, (said he,)
tell me if you can, what is the cause of this great arising of
the sands and shelves here about this haven, the which stop
it up, that no ships can arrive here ? Ye are the eldest man
I can espy in all this company, so that if any man can tell
any cause of it, ye of likelihood can say most to it, or to
leastwise, more than any man here assembled. Yea forsooth,
good master, (quoth this old man,) for I am well nigh a hun-
dred years old, and no man here in this company anything
near unto mine age. Well then, (quoth master Moore,) how
say you in this matter ? What think you to be the cause of
these shelves and flats that stop up Sandwich haven ? For-
sooth sir, (quoth he,) I am an old man; I think that Tenterton-
steeple is the cause of Goodwin Sands. For I am an old
man, sir, (quoth he,) and I may remember the building of
Tenterton-steeple, and I may remember when there was no
steeple at all there. And before that Tenterton-steeple was
in building, there was no manner of speaking of any flats or
sands that stopped the haven ; and therefore I think tha<
Tenterton-steeple is the cause of the destroying and decay of
Sandwich haven. And so to my purpose, is preaching oi
God?s word the cause of rebellion, as Tenterton-steeple was
cause that Sandwich haven is decayed.
WOMAN?S LOVE : A TALE,
JEREMY TAYLOR, BISHOP OF DOWN.
BORN, r606, DIED, 1667.
A young Verona widow was the talk of all the town, and the
rarest example of a dear affection to her husband. She de-
scended with the corpse into the vault, and there being
attended with her maiden, resolved to weep to death, or die
with famine or a distempered sorrow: from which resolution,


. . . ?
nor his, nor her friends, nor the reverence of the principal
citizens, who used the entreaties of their charity and their
power, could dissuade her. But a soldier that watched a
dead body hanging upon a tree just over against this monu-
ment, crept in, and a while stared upon the silent and comely
disorders of their sorrow ; and having let the wonder awhile
breathe out of each others? eyes, at last he fetched his supper
and a bottle of wine, with purpose to eat and drink, and still
to feed himself with that sad prettiness. His pity and first
draught of wine made him bold and curious to try if the
maid would drink : who, having many hours since felt her
resolution faint as her wearied body, took his kindness ; and
the light returned into her eyes, and danced like boys in a
festival; and fearing lest the pertinaciousness of her mistress?
sorrows should cause her evil to revert, or her shame to
approach, assayed whether she would endure to hear an
argument to persuade her to drink and live. The violent
passion had laid all her spirits in wildness and dissolution,
and the maid found them willing to be gathered into order at
the arrest of any new object, being weary of the first, of
which like leeches they had sucked their fill till they fell down
and burst. The weeping woman took her cordial, and was
not angry with her maid, and heard the soldier talk. And he
was so pleased with the change, that he, who first loved the
silence of the sorrow, was more in love with the music of
her returning voice, especially which himself had strung and
put in tune. And the man began to talk amorously, and the
woman?s weak head and heart was soon possessed with a
little wine, and grew gay, and talked and fell in love ; and
that very night, in the morning of her passion, in the grave
of her husband, in the pomps of mourning, and in her
funeral garments, married her new and stranger guest. For
so the wild foragers of Lybia, being spent with heat, and
dissolved by the two fond kisses of the sun, do melt with
their common fires, and die with faintness, and descend with
motions slow and unable to the little brooks that descend
from heaven in the wilderness; and when they drink, they
return into tbe vigour of a new life, and contract strange
marriages; and the lioness is courted by a panther, and she
listens to his love, and conceives a monster that all men call
unnatural, and the daughter of an equivocal passion and of a
sudden refreshment. And so also was it in the cave of
Verona : for by this time the soldier began to think it was fit


he should return to his watch, and observe the dead body he
had in charge; but when he ascended from his mourning
bridal chamber, he found the body had been stolen by the
friends of the dead, and he was fallen into an evil condition,
because by the laws of Verona, his body was to be fixed in
the place of it. The poor man returns to his woman, cries
out bitterly, and in her presence resolves to die to prevent his
death, and in secret to prevent his shame. But now the
woman?s love was raging like her former sadness, and grew
witty, and she comforted her soldier, and persuaded him to
live, lest by losing him, who had brought her from death and
a far more grievous sorrow, she should return to her old
solemnities of dying, and lose her honour for a dream, or the
reputation of her constancy without the change and satisfaction
of an enjoyed love. The man would fain have lived, if it
had been possible, and she found out this way for him ; that
he should take the body of her first husband, whose funeral
she had so strangely mourned, and put it upon the gallows in
place of the stolen thief. He did so, and escaped the present
danger, to possess a love which might change as violently as
her grief had done.
I was never yet once, and commend their resolutions, who
never marry twice. Not that I disallow of second marriage j
as neither in all cases of polygamy, which considering some
times, and the unequal number of both sexes, may be also
necessary. The world was made for the twelfth
part of man for woman. Man is the whole world, and the
breath of God; woman the rib, and crooked piece of man.
I speak not in prejudice, nor am averse from that sweet sex,
but naturally amorous of all that is beautiful. I can look a
whole day with delight upon a handsome picture, though it
be but of a horse. It is my temper, and I like it the better,
to affect all harmony ; and sure there is music even in the
beauty, and the silent note which Cupid strikes, far sweeter
than the sound of an instrument. Sir Thomas Brown, 1605.
Simonides the Greek Poet, (Born b. c. 566,} Says, ? The slattern has in
her composition something of the swine; the cunning woman something of the
fox; the chatterbox something of the dog; the stupid woman something of
the ass; the headstrong something of the weasel; the vain something of the
horse ; and the malicious something of the monkey.? There is a naivetd, a
good nature, and simplicity about this satire, which quite disarms ill-temper,
and renders it a very general favourite.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT WIVES.
A Wife is the gift of heaven ?there?s no doubt of it.
Every other kind of gift, such as lands, rents, furniture, right


of pasture or common ?these are all mere gifts of fortune,
that pass away like shadows on a wall; but you have to
apprehend no such misfortune with a wife. Your wife will
last longer, perhaps, even than you may desire. A wife !
Why, how can a man have any adversity that has a wife ?
Answer me that. Tongue cannot tell nor heart think of the
felicity there is between a man and his wife. If be is poor
she helps him to work. She takes care of his money for
him, and never wastes anything. She never says ?Yes? when
he says ?No.? ?Do this,? says he. ?Directly? says she. Oh,
blessed institution ! Oh, precious wedlock ! thou art so joy-
ous, and at the same time so virtuous, and so recommended
to us all, and so approved by us all, that every man who is
worth a farthing should go down on his bare knees, every day
of his existence, and be thankful for having such a wife 5 or,
if he hasn?t got one, he ought to pray for one, and beg that
she may last him to his life?s end, for his life is in that case
set in security. He has only to act by his wife?s advice, and
he may hold up his head with the best. A wife is so true
and so wise. Oh, ever while you live take your wife?s advice
if you would be thought a wise man !? Chaucer , modernized
hy Leigh Hunt.
A REVIEWED PAMPHLET*
Copied from a crumpled manuscript found in the Editor?s waste basket by our
Printer?s devil.
This morning we found on our table a pamphlet entitled
? Jesus who is called Christ ,? which has been issued from an
obscure press in Lonsdale-street, west, and we have seldom
been so pained with the audacity of any writer. He strikes
at the very foundation of our faith by declaring it doubtful
whether Jesus ever existed, and refers to the obstinate rejec-
tion of our holy religion by the Jews as a triumphant proof
that Jesus did not come of the Jews. He calls Jesus a mere
idol representing a sentimental something he calls Human
Sympathy. He attempts in a most miserable manner to
prove from the Gospels that Jesus was an undutiful son, and
void of affection for his father, mother, brothers and sisters.
He says he was soft and effeminate, and refers irreverently to
that beautiful instance of womanly affection and tenderness,
when the woman bathed the feet of Jesus with her tears, and
wiped them with her hair. He says the dirty habits of the
disciples of Jesus in not washing their hands before eating
was the cause of quarrels with the Pharisees, whom he says


were cleanly ; and that fishermen require much washing after
handling fish. He says Jesus was evasive in argument, and
sometimes silently sullen. He refuses to credit Jesus with
any miracle, and says, ?Life-boat men and fire brigade men do
more good without miracle than Jesus did with miracle. He
says Jesus had no fortitude, and that his last death-cry on the
cross is worse than any infidel death-bed ever reported. In
fact this pamphlet is simply awful, and shows how easily the
gloried liberty of the press may degenerate into licentiousness.
We piously hope both author and publisher will meet with
their just deserts and be ostracised by a just and discerning
public. On second thoughts we will not print these remarks,
it would be advertising the pestilential pamphlet. No, we
will consign remarks and pamphlet to the stove. But this
weather is too warm. ? well to another place where they shall
be hid from the light of day. ?Star of the East.

we have seen of the unknown God.? Melbourne, J. M. Smith.
A SERMON ON THE NATIVITY, BY
BISHOP LATIMER, 1500.
I warrant you there was many a jolly damsel at that time
in Bethlem, yet amongst them all there was not one found
that would humble herself so much, as once to go see poor
Mary in the stable, and to comfort her. No, no j they were
too fine to take such pains. I warrant you they had their
braclets, and verdingals, and were trimmed with all manner
of fine and costly raiment, like as there be many now a-days
amongst us, which study nothing else but how they may de-
vise fine raiment, and in the mean season they suffer poor
Mary to lie in the stable; that is to say, the poor people of
God they suffer to perish for lack of necessaries. But
what was her swaddling clothes wherein she laid the King
of Heaven and Earth ? No doubt it was poor gear ; perad-
venture it was her kercher which she took from her head; or
such like gear : for I think Mary had not much fine linen ;
she was not trimmed up as our women be now a-days. I
think indeed Mary never had a verdingal, for she used no such
superfluities as our fine damsels do now a-days : for in the
old time women were content with honest and simple gar-
ments. Now they have found out these roundabouts ; they
were not invented then ; the devil was not so cunning to


make such gear; he found it out afterward. Therefore Mary-
had it not. I will say this, and yet not judge other folk?s
hearts, but only speak after daily appearance : no doubt it is
nothing but a token of pride to wear such verdingals, and
therefore I think that every godly woman should set them
aside. It was not for nought that St. Paul advertised all
women to give a good example of sadness, soberness, and
godliness, in setting aside all wantonness and pride. And he
speaketh of such manner of pride as was used in his time :
non tortis crinibus, not with laying out the hair artificially':
non plicatura capillorum, not with laying out the tussockes.
I doubt not but if verdingals had been used at that time, St.
Paul would have spoken against them too, like as he spake
against other things which women used at that time, to shew
their wantonness and foolishness. Therefore, as I said before,
seeing that God abhorreth all pride (and verdingals are no-
thing else but an instrument of pride,) I would wish that
women would follow the counsel of St. Paul, and set aside
such gorgeous apparel, and rather study to please God, than
to set their mind upon pride : or else, when they will not
follow the counsel of St, Paul, let them scrape out those
words wherewith he forbiddeth them their proudness, other-
wise the words of St. Paul will condemn them at the last
day. 1 say no more ; wise folks will do wisely. The words
of St. Paul are not written for nothing ; if they will do after
his mind, they must set aside their foolish verdingals: but if
they will go forward in their foolishness and pride, the reward
which they shall have at the end, shall not be taken from them.
MORALITY NOT A PRODUCT OF RELIGION.
The moral sentiment which manifested itself in the life of
the Jewish patriarchs was not the result of a positive religion
or of a political legislation. No, for amongst the early Jews
there existed neither a religious doctrine nor a political law :
both were called into existence in a later age. I think we
may therefore assert that morality is independent alike of
dogma and of legislation, that it is a pure product of the
healthy human instinct, and that true morality?the reason of
the heart ?will always continue to exist though Church and
State should perish. He who fears to venture as far as his
heart urges and his reason permits, is a coward : he who
ventures further than he intended to go, is a slave. ? Heine.

THE GOD WE KNOW.^fe
�S^ : # /VA ' v ' v '? vvw ?
The writer of the following Essay and Hymn, evidently intended them for
publication in the Melbourne Review , Southern Cross , or the Church Magazine;
but the MS. having unexpectedly come into the possession of the Publisher
of the ?Bees? Wing? series, he has taken the liberty of introducing both to
to the Public in the se pages; meantime the papers mentioned may quote the
Essay or Hymn, or both, as it suits them, without the fear of infringing the
Copyright act.
To the Editor of the
Dear Sir,
I send you some verses under the heading ? The God we
know.?? I have long been an admirer of several of the tunes
in the Sankey Collection, for their sweet, plaintive Melodies.
One I have so admired is No. 45. Both music and words are
old ; the words are by Cowper and are in common measure.
The subject is bathing in blood. The first line is ? There
is a fountain filled with blood,? and that is enough to
quote. I have often found myself humming over this air,
to the words of the hymn, and as these words, are quite out
of harmony with my feelings and reason, I thought I would
try and fit to the air, other and more pleasing words.
Is it not a very strange phenomenon; delicate, timid,
gentle girls and tender-hearted women, many of whom
become faintish at heart, at the sight of a bleeding nose or a
cut finger, singing jubilantly about plunging into a bath, filled
with the blood of their Dear Saviour. Language seems to
convey no meaning to their minds, for they evidently ? know
not what they do? when they sing such words.
I think the one cause of all motion, in the inorganic
and organic worlds, may with perfect aptness be called Love.
For the convenience of communicating particular ideas, we
speak of that cause as attraction, polarity, gravitation, affinity,
cohesion,capillary attraction,self-preservation,selfishness, love,
love of offspring, friendship, patriotism, philanthropy, individ-
ualism, centralisation, assimilation, and under many other
terms; but all are homogeneous and indicate that the motion
observed in each of the departments referred to by any of


these terms, is caused by feeling, sympathy, love. Even the
explosive, scattering results of repulsion, prove the intensity
of the desire so to speak, for expansion, for liberty, for dis-
ruption ; and the most intense hate, which individuals and
sections of our race, often exhibit towards each other, is
always caused, and fed, by an equally intense love for some
other person or object. Love! Love ! under whatever name
disguised and though in almost impenetrable intricacies in-
volved, is the prime mover.
Some persons appear to deny, at least ignore, the presence
of knowledge and intelligence in the inorganic and vegetable
worlds; but the action within these worlds proves they have
intelligence. When two dew-drops approach each other to
coalesce, it is plain each knows of the presence of the other.
When a plant sends its roots in that direction in soil in which
there is moisture, it is evident the plant knows ?feels, there
is moisture in that direction ; and when it sends forth its
leaves and blossoms towards the light, it is plain it knows
feels the light is there.
It is an astronomical fact, that the course of planets in
their orbits, and their velocity of travel is affected by the
presence of other planets; that in approaching conjunction,
speed is accelerated, and in retiring from conjunction, slacken-
ed, Observed perturbrations in the course of the planet
Uranus, led Le Verries and Adams to conclude that an un-
known body outside Uranius, disturbed it, and through the
simultaneous calculations of these two astronomers, the
planet Neptune was discovered. So Uranus felt the presence
of Neptune ?plants feel the presence of moisture and light,
and can any one inform me of any kind of knowledge or
intelligence more positive than feeling. We talk thoughtlessly
of inanimate nature and insensible matter, and fail to perceive,
or perhaps forget, that the pulse of sympathy, throbs eter-
nally throughout the entire universe.
It may sound heretical to say Love is God, but it should
be remembered, Saint John wrote " God is Love,? which is
the same thing; so if lam guilty of heresy, I sin in saintly
company, though only
A Pharisee.


T3BE3S GOT> W3S KNOW.
1. 1 HERE is a yearning, drawing power,
JL Diffused all Nature through j
In ev?ry place, in ev?ry hour,
In things both old and new.
2. The starry worlds, in systems join,
The dew-drops meet and mate.
The rills unite, the streams combine,
And all things gravitate.
3 The trees extend their giant arms
In love, towards the sun.
The flowers unfold their beaut?ous charms
To him, till day is done.
4 And heart seeks heart, with anxious beat.
In bird, and beast, and man ;
They cling together, life repeat.
Since e?er the world began.
3 Love draws, love binds, and love creates.
Commands us to preserve.
Rules happy homes, and prosp?rous states,
Gives life, and health, and nerve.
6 And ever thus, throughout all time.
Throughout th? eternal whole,
The universal force of Love,
Remains the moving soul.
7 Then come adore this God of gods ;
The God no one denies.
Who governs without fear or rods.
And heeds our wants_and cries.
A LOGICAL GHOST.
There is nothing more uncanny than for to see one?s own
face by moonlight in a looking-glass. At the same moment
the heavy-striking yawning clock gave forth the hour, and so
slowly that I thought it took twelve hours to strike, and that
at the twelfth stroke it must begin again to strike twelve.
Between the first and last stroke of the hammer, another
clock had struck, very quickly, almost chiding, sharp, and


perhaps vexed at the slowness of its big cousin. When the
two iron tongues were silent, and a stillness deep as death
ruled in the whole house, it seemed suddenly as though I
heard in the corridor of my room something come waddling
and flapping along, like the shambling gait of an old man.
At last the door opens, and slowly stepped in the deceased Dr.
Saul Ascher. A cold fever drizzled through marrow and bone.
I trembled like an aspen leaf, and hardly dared to look on the
apparition. He looked just as he used to ?the same transcen-
dental grey surtout ; the same abstract legs ; the same math-
ematical face, only something more yellow than formerly; and
the mouth, which used to form two corner angles of 22\
degrees, was knit together, and the eye-orbits were of greater
radius. Tottering, and leaning, just as he was wont, on his
Spanish cane, he approached my bed, and in his ordinarily
disagreeable speech he said in a friendly way, ?Do not be
afraid, or think that lam an apparition. This is a deception
of your fancy, if you see me in the light of a ghost. What
is a ghost ? Give me a definition. In what rational relation
does such an appearance stand to the reason ? The reason, I
say the reason ? And now the apparition proceeded to
analyse the reason, quoting ?Kant?s Critique of Pure Reason,?
second part, first division, second book, third chapter;
the distinction between phenomena and noumena. He thus
constructed the belief in ghosts, as if he were working out a
problem ; set one syllogism on another, and concluded with
the logical proof that there were no ghosts at all. All this
time the cold sweat ran down off - my back; my teeth chat-
tered like castanets in anguish of soul. I nodded approval
to every proposition wherewith the ghostly Doctor
proved to me the absurdity of all ghostly fear; and my
visitor was so zealous in his demonstration that he once, in
absence of mind, pulled a handful of worms out of his watch-
pocket in mistake for his watch, and, immediately aware of
his error, with ridiculous haste and fear put them back again,
saying, ? Reason is the highest principle ; ? but here the
clock struck one, and the vision disappeared.? Heine.
The Fenian Irishman makes a scowling face at you some
morning because, he has dreamt that you once insulted him,
or that his great, great-grandfather once received a kick from
your saxon or french great, great-grandmother.? Fideli.
