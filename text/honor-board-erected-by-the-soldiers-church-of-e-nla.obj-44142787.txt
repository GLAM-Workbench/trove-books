HYMN FOR THE ABSENT.
Holy Father, in Thy mercy,
Hoar our anxious prayer,
Keep our loved ones, now far absent,
’Neath Thy care.
Jesus, Saviour, let Thy presence
Be their light and guide;
Keep, 0 keep them in their weakness,
At Thy side.
When in sorrow, when in danger,
When in loneliness,
In Thy love look down and comfort
Their distress.
May the joy of Thy salvation
Be their strength and stay;
May they love and may they praise
Thee
Day by day.
Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
Sanctify their life;
Send Thy grace that they may conquer
In the strife.
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
God the One in Three,
Bless them, guide them, save them,
keep them
Near to Thee.
Amen.
PSALM XX.
(To be said with intention for an
absent friend).
1. The Lord hear thee in the day of
trouble; the Name of the God of Jacob
defend thee;
2. Send thee help from the sanctu-
ary; and strengthen thee out of Sion;
3. Remember all thy offerings; and
accept thy burnt sacrifice;
4. Grant thee thy heart’s desire;
and fulfil all thy mind.
5. We will rejoice in thy salvation,
and triumph in the name of the Lord
our God; the Lord perform all thy pe-
titions.
6. Now know I, that the Lord help-
eth His Anointed, and will hear him
from his holy Heaven; even with the
wholesome strength of His right hand.
7. Some put their trust in chariots,
and some in horses; but we will re-
member the name of the Lord our God.
8. They are brought down and fal-
len; but we are risen, and stand up-
right.
9. Save, Lord, and hear us, O King
of Heaven; when we call upon Thee.
Glory be, etej.

To dwell within Thy city bright,
The heavenly Jerusalem.

THE Archbishop desires to raise a sum of (not less than)
£l,OOO to provide Church buildings on the soldier
settlements, particularly at Stanthorpe and Beerburrum,
and has asked the Society to promote this appeal for that
purpose.
At Stanthorpe there are on the settlements about
1,417 souls, and at Beerburrum about 1,473 souls, the
majority of whom are members of the Church of England.
There are many “ Boys ” who during camp life and
during the war came into closer touch with the Church,
and with whom it is desirable that link should not be broken,
especially now that they are married and are forming homes
of their own. There are numbers of young children, some
of them growing out of infancy, the State schools being
well attended. There are English brides w r ho have come
from the Homeland, wdrere they were closely in touch with
the Church, and have been deprived since their arrival —
in some cases running into several years—not only of Church
services but also of the Sacraments which they had been
accustomed to frequent.
On the Stanthorpe Settlements within a week of his
enthronement the Archbishop placed a priest, who until the
other day w r as living in a tent, but lately has obtained the
use of a room to sleep in. Regular services are being pro-
vided at Beerburrum, and at present are held in a dancing
hall. At Enoggera a hut has been opened for services and
social purposes, and regular services are now being provided.
It is quite essential that the Archbishop’s care, thus
shown immediately on his assuming office, for the soldier
settlers and their families, should be supported, and build-
Soldiers' Church of England
Help Society.


ings provided which will allow services being held and
social gatherings taking place, as well as providing humble
rooms for the use of the clergy. Those who appreciate the
Archbishop’s prompt action for the soldiers direct benefit,
will ensure by their donations, that action becoming
effective.
The Society recognises that there are many appeals
before Church people at present, and that there are some
Diocesan funds which particularly need support, but not-
withstanding this the Society is confident that this appeal
for the direct spiritual and social benefit of the soldiers who
fought for us and of their wives and children will receive
a generous response.
The influence of religion will at the least strengthen and
encourage those who, after the war, are now making a
struggle to establish themselves and their families on the
land. The response to this appeal will prove that the work
of the Church done in the camps and at the front was not
a flash in the pan, to die out with the war, but was a lasting
appreciation of those who gave up and risked so much for us.
The Society asks that 100 people each make themselves
responsible for raising £lO in any fashion they choose,
provided there is no gambling method adopted.
In addition, donations are asked from those who still
remember how much we owe our soldiers, and who would
wish to see the ministrations of religion amongst them and
their families.
Contributions may be sent to the Archbishop (Bishops-
bourne, Milton), or the Director of the Society (Canon
Garland, Box 47, Brisbane), who as Treasurers will
administer the Fund.


I wish most fully to associate myself with you in this
appeal which you, or I would rather say we, are making
for the providing of Churches and Church Huts for the
Soldiers Settlements. As you know, I have visited one of
the settlements near Stanthorpe, and found that there was
a real desire on the part of many of the soldiers to have in
some of'the large settlements, buildings which they can use
as churches. It is altogether inadequate that the Chaplain
should only have rooms in private houses in which to hold
services and to celebrate the Holy Communion. The least
we can do for returned soldiers who are pluckily battling
for a living on the fruit farms near Stanthorpe, and in other
places, is to provide for the proper conduct of services,
especially as so many of them desire it. I am most anxious
that the £l,OOO for which we are appealing should he raised
as quickly as possible, in order that the work may be begun,
and the soldiers and their families may feel that their Church
has not forgotten them and is not neglecting them.

In Flanders’ Fields.
In Flanders’ fields the Poppies blow
Between the crosses row on row:
They mark our place and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders’ fields.
Take up our work for as we go
To you, from failing hands, we throw
The torch. Be yours to lift it high !
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though Poppies
blow
In Flanders' fields. —Col. Macrae.
