THE MANDATE.
1. The “ Mandate for the German Possessions in the Pacific Ocean
situated south of the Equator, other than German Samoa and Nauru,”
issued by the Council of the League of Nations on 17th December,
1920, gave to the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia full
powers of administration and legislation over the Territory, subject
to the Mandate, as an integral portion of the Commonwealth, and per-
mitted the Government of the Commonwealth to apply the laws of the
Commonwealth to the Territory, subject to such local modifications as
circumstances might require.
THE NEW GUINEA ACT.
2. The New Guinea Act 1920, passed by the Parliament of the
Commonwealth, came into force on 9th May, 1921, the day on which
civil government was established in the Territory of New l Guinea, and
declared that the territories and islands specified in the Act, being the
former German possessions described in the Mandate, should be a
Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth by the name of
the Territory of New Guinea.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
3. Area and Geographical Position. — The Territory of New 7
Guinea comprises that portion of the former German New Guinea
Protectorate which is situated south of the equator (excepting only the
island of Nauru). The principal islands (with their German names, if
such differ from those now in use), and their approximate areas, are as
follow 7 ;


COCO-NUT PLANTATIONS,


CLIMATE.
4. General. — The Territory has a tropical climate, with small
differences between daily and seasonal extremes of temperature. It is
outside the area of typhoons, but strong winds are not uncommon.
5. Temperature. —The mean annual temperature on the coast is
26 degrees to 27.5 degrees C. (79 degrees to 81 degrees F.) —a moderate
temperature for the latitude —and the difference between the mean of
the coldest and that of the warmest months is not more than 2 degrees F.
6. .Rainfall. —There is no dry season. At Rabaul the period of
the north-west monsoon, November to April, is wetter than that of
the south-east trade from May to September or October; but in some
other places, especially the south coast of New Britain and in the
vicinity of Finseh Harbour, the south-east trade brings the principal
rains. The position of the coasts with regard to the direction of the
prevailing winds is the decisive factor in the rainfall. At nearly all
the stations at which observations have been made the annual rainfall
amounts to over 80 inches. In Bougainville, southern New Britain,
and the island of New Guinea, the yearly average is from 100 to over
250 inches; but amounts as low as 66 inches have been reported from
some stations on the coast of the island of New Guinea. The average
rainfall at stations in the Gazelle Peninsula is about 95 inches. A
region of high rainfall, reaching over 250 inches, is in the vicinity of
Finseh Harbour.
GOVERNMENT.
7. Establishment of Civil Government. —On the 9th May, 1921,
a proclamation was issued in Rabaul that the military occupation had
that day terminated. On the same day the first Ordinances made by
the Governor-General under the New Guinea Act 1920 came into force.
The most important of these w 7 as the Laws Repeal and Adopting Ordi-
nance 1921, which provided that German laws should cease to apply to
the Territory, and substituted other statute laws, together with the
principles and rules of common law and equity in force in England,
as the basis of the law of the Territory, subject to modification by
Ordinance made by the Governor-General.
The Ordinance named also preserved the rights of natives in land,
and the existing rights, privileges, and customs of the natives in regard
to cultivation, barter, hunting, and fishing; and it provided that tribal
institutions, customs, and usages should continue, so far as they were
not repugnant to the general principles of humanity.
Other Ordinances which came into force on the same day provided
for the establishment of courts of law, and for the prohibition of the
supply to natives of firearms, ammunition, intoxicating liquor, and
opium.

Guinea) —Morobe, Madang, and Aitape; in New Ireland and Lavongai
(New Hanover) —Kavieng and Namatanai; in Admiralty Islands and
adjoining islands—Manus; in Solomon Islands—Kieta. Each district
is under a district officer, assisted by a small staff.

1,288, of whom about 250 were missionaries, and 262 were troops
engaged in administration; 715 were British subjects, and nearly all
of the remainder were nationals of former enemy countries. At the
present time the number of Europeans is about 1,500.

materially increased since 1921.
11. Chinese and Japanese Population.—The numbers of Chinese
and Japanese at 30th June, 1924, were as follow; —Chinese, 1,330;
Japanese, 59. The Chinese provide the skilled artisans of the Terri-
tory, and many of them are small traders. Most of the Japanese
are employed in the plantations, shipyards, and stores.
The Commonwealth Immigration Act 1901-1920 is in force in
New Guinea.
12. Native Population.—The native population, exclusive of
indentured labourers, was estimated in 1924 to be 380,000.


KILN DRYER.
Kiln dryer on a plantation ; capacity 10 cwt of dry copra every 24 hours.
SMOKE DRYER
Typical smoke dryer ; capacity 10 cwt. of dry copra every 24 hours.
Fires of coco-nut husks are made inside the drying house, and the copra rests on a bed 8 feet above the fires.


PRODUCTION.
13. General.— New Guinea possesses great natural resources, the
development of which has barely been commenced.
Copra. —The mainstay of the Territory is the coco-nut palm.
Indigenous in most of the islands, the coco-nut palm has yielded copra
to traders from the beginning of European trade.
Formerly, the uses of copra were limited to soap-making and the
production of oil, but in recent years chemists have devised means of
transforming the vegetable fats into valuable food products, which are
in demand in Great Britain and on the Continent of Europe.
The principal markets for copra are in Australia, United States,
Great Britain, and Europe.
The plantations, commenced in 1883, have been extended steadily,
and their product now comprises 98 per cent, in value of the total ex-
ports of the Territory. The quantity of copra exported in 1913 was
14,000 tons; in 1919, it was over 20,000 tons; in 1922-23, it was
32,648 tons, an increase of 6,754 tons over the figures for the previous
year; and in 1923-24, it was 34,974 tons, an increase of 2,326 tons over
1922-23. The area under coco-nuts increased during the military
occupation from 76,845 acres in 1914 to 133,960 acres at the end of
1918; on 30th June, 1923, the planted area was 167,428 acres, of which
78,660 acres were in bearing, and on 30th June, 1924, there were
172,373 acres planted, 95,009 of which were in bearing. The price of
copra in 1922-23, f.o.b. Eabaul, averaged £lB 19s. per ton; in 1923-24,
£2O 10s. per ton; and in September, 1925, it was £23 15s. per ton.
Rubber.—A. limited area is planted with rubber, mostly of the Ficus
elastica variety.
Cocoa. Cocoa is grown successfully, principally at Yitu (French
Islands).
Other Crops.— The climate and soil of the Territory are also suitable
for the cultivation of rice, Manila hemp, cinchona, nutmeg, vanilla,
maize, tobacco, cotton, sisal hemp, and coffee, but hitherto the cultiva-
tion of these products either has not advanced beyond the experimental
stage, or has been attempted on a small scale only. Sugar-cane of
many varieties flourishes, and the natives cultivate extensive areas for
their own use; other indigenous food-producing plants include the sago
palm, and the cassava plant (which yields arrowroot and tapioca, and
is used in the making of glucose).

14. Live Stock. —There is little natural pasture in the Territory,
but the coco-nut plantations maintain numerous live stock, which, in
1924, comprised 705 horses, 8,789 cattle, 3,276 sheep, 5,814 goats, 5,480
pigs (exclusive of the large number of pigs kept by the natives), 13
mules, and 15 donkeys.
15. Timber. —The timber resources of the Territory are not yet fully
known. Both hardwood and softwood are found in several varieties
some of which are of excellent quality. At Henry Reid Bay, Hew
Britain, a considerable quantity of hardwood (eucalyptus) is obtainable.
Most of the timber required for house and ship building and for other
purposes is obtained locally. In Horth-cast Hew Guinea the Missions
possess up-to-date saw-milling plants, while timber required in the
archipelago is supplied by the Sacred Heart Mission’s saw-mill, and by
a privately-owned mill, both at the eastern end of Hew Britain.
TRADE.
16. Total Trade. —The value of the imports, exports, and total
trade at various periods since 1887, and during each of the last five
years, is given in the table hereunder: —
The import values for the last five years are exclusive of money and
Government stores, excepting those for the year 1921-22, in which the value
of stores is included.

SHIPPING AND COMMUNICATION.
17. General. —A subsidized mail service between the Territory and
Australia is maintained by Burns, Philp, and Co. Ltd. In addition to
arrangements for transhipment of copra in Sydney, cargo steamers
take shipments of copra direct to European and American markets.
Inter-island communication is provided by the ships of the subsidized
company referred to, as well as by Expropriation Board and privately-
owned schooners.
18. Land Communication. —There are no railways. Roads lead
from Eabaul to places within 30 or 40 miles, and there is a road 170
miles long in New Ireland.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
19. There is a high-power wireless station at Bita Paka, near
Rabaul, and low-power stations at Kavieng, Kieta, Manus, Madang,
Aitape, and Morobe. All these stations are under the control of Amal-
gamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited.
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has a branch at Rabaul,
and agencies throughout the Group.

steamer going to Brisbane and from there direct to Rabaul is eight
days. At present there are two steamers in the service, which is a
three-weekly one.
The present itinerary of the Mataram is—
Sydney, Brisbane, Rabaul, Kavieng, Manus, Maron, Longon,
Matty, Seleo, Potsdamhafen, Alexishafen, Madang, Yitu,
Rabaul, Sydney.
The present itinerary of the Marsina is—

Gazelle peninsula, showing the relative positions of the properties in the
Rabaul area, is included, and will be found facing page 34.


TITLES.
1. After the annexation by Germany in 1884, land laws and
regulations were introduced which eventually developed into the
‘‘German Land Regulations of Ist January, 1914.” The policy of the
German Government showed a preference for freehold tenure. Under
their law a system of registration in a groundbook (Grundbuch) was
introduced, but registration did not confer an indefeasible title. The
German system of registration has been replaced by one closely modelled
on the Torrens system, consequent upon the introduction of the Lands
Registration Ordinance 1924-25.
2. The titles conferred under the Lands Registration Ordinance
1924-25 are much more desirable from the view-point of definiteness and
indefeasibility than those based upon the German Groundbook entries.
3. All land registered in the Groundbook must be brought under
the Lands Registration Ordinance by the Registrar of Titles without
application from any person interested, and, although expropriated
property has not yet been brought under this Ordinance, preliminary
action has been taken in that direction.
4. In this series of properties offered, investigations have been so far
completed as to enable it to be stated under what conditions the title
under the Lands Registration Ordinance will issue to the buyer, and
the attention of tenderers is invited to the particulars given in this
connexion in a special paragraph embodied in the description of each
property.
5. From particulars contained in the Groundbook it would appear
that some properties advertised in this catalogue were granted to the
late German owners subject to a Government improvement condition to
the effect that the property will revert to the Crown “ if not properly
taken in hand, cultivated, or properly used.”
The Government improvement condition referred to usually provides
for one-fifth of the land to be cleared and planted within five years,
and three-fourths within fifteen years. If the purchaser cannot prove
that this condition has been fulfilled, or that circumstances prevented
the fulfilment of such condition, the uncleared portion of the land
reverts to the Crown.
It is not the intention of the present Administration of the Terri-
tory of Hew Guinea to waive such improvement condition, but the
Administration has indicated that the condition will not commence to

operate against a purchaser until the land is registered under the Lands
Registration Ordinance. The effect of this is to give ample time to
purchasers to make such further improvements as may be necessary.
6. All existing rights of natives or others, whether disclosed by the
Oroundbook or not, must be settled before registration may be effected
under the Ordinance.
As the determination of such rights may affect a property, provision
has been made in the conditions of sale for the payment of compensa-
tion on a defined basis where land is excised to satisfy an encumbrance
undisclosed at the time of sale.
Where such encumbrance reduces the value of a property in some
way other than by the excision of land, the purchase price may be
varied by agreement between the Custodian and the purchaser, or by
arbitration.
7. The catalogue definitely states what known encumbrances affect
each property now offered for tender, whether the property has been sur-
veyed, and whether such survey has been accepted by the Administration.
Whore the survey has been accepted, the Custodian undertakes, subject
to the conditions of sale, that the purchaser will receive a title to the
property on the completion of the purchase, and the payment of the
registration fees for the registration of the property under the Lands
Registration Ordinance.
The registration fees at present payable to the Registrar, in accord-
ance with the existing Ordinance, over and above the cost of all adver-
tisements authorized or directed to be published, are as follow: —

tration, or if for any other reason a property requires re-surveying, the
purchaser must bear the cost of the re-survey. Ho scale of survey fees

Note.—One hectare is equivalent to 2'4711 acres.
In addition to the above fees there may be charged travelling ex-
penses to the site of survey and other expenses connected therewith.
9. Most of the properties described in this catalogue are of freehold
tenure, and are registered in the Groundbook; but there are some which
have not been so registered. In such cases it will be necessary for—
(a) the properties to be surveyed;
( b ) improvement conditions, if any, to be complied with;
(c) native rights and other encumbrances, if any, to be defined.
The purchasers of such properties will be required to bear the cost of
survey, and to comply with the improvement conditions. They will
receive compensation, as outlined in the conditions of sale, for any land
which may be excised from the properties to satisfy native rights. .
10. Where it has been the custom of the Custodian to pass through
a plantation having a frontage to the sea, for the purpose of conveying
stores to, or shipping produce from, another plantation, the conditions
of sale provide for the granting of a right of way over the foreshore
plantation in favour of the Custodian or the purchaser of the other
plantation concerned, for the purpose mentioned.

a portion of the land over which native rights exist or
which is found to be vested in scn.e other person,


tile purchaser shall be entitled to have the amount of purchase money
in respect of the land reduced in accordance with the provisions of
these Regulations.
51c. (1.) The amount by which the purchase money shall be

tion arises by reason of the exclusion from transfer to the purchaser
of portion of the land sold or purporting to be sold, shall be determined

(2.) The amount by which the purchase money shall be reduced by
reason of the exclusion from transfer to the purchaser of portion of the
land sold, or purporting to be sold, shall be determined as follows:
(a) In respect of each hectare of unplanted land so excluded
a reduction of Rive shillings shall be made; and
( b ) In respect of planted land so excluded a reduction shall be
made in accordance with the following provisions:—
(i) The value of the whole of the planted land pur-
porting to be sold to the purchaser shall be
determined by deducting the value of the
whole of the unplanted land purporting to be
sold to the purchaser from the total purchase
price payable in respect of the whole of the
property;
(ii) For the purposes of the last preceding sub-para-
graph, the value of the unplanted land shall
be calculated at the rate of five shillings per
hectare.
(iii) The value determined in accordance with sub-
paragraph (i) of this paragraph shall be
deemed to be the value of the coco-nut palms
and cocoa trees growing on the planted land;
(iv) Each coco-nut palm and each cocoa tree
which is ten or more years old shall be
reckoned as one unit, and each coco-nut palm
and each cocoa tree less than ten years old
shall be reckoned as a fraction of a unit, each
full year of age being reckoned as one-tenth
of a unit;


(v) The value of the planted land determined in
accordance with sub-paragraph (i) of this
paragraph shall be divided by the total
number of units of coco-nut palms and cocoa
trees on the planted land; and
(vi) The amount ascertained in pursuance of the last
preceding sub-paragraph shall be multiplied
by the number of units of coco-nut palms and
cocoa trees on the planted land excluded from
transfer to the purchaser, and the amount
resulting shall bo the amount by which the
purchase money shall be reduced.
52. Upon payment by the purchaser of the full amount of the
purchase money, a proper transfer and title to the property will be
executed to the purchaser at the expense of the purchaser.
53. (1.) The title that shall issue to the purchaser of a property
shall be the best title vested in the Custodian from the former owner
of the property. Provided that gold, silver, copper, tin, antimony, and
metals of every description, opals, gems, precious stones, and coal, shale
and mineral oils, on, in, or under all lands, shall not become the pro-
perty of the purchaser.
(2.) Where the title to any property purchased from the Custodian
is incomplete, the purchaser may complete the title by fulfilment of the
conditions thereof, or, in the case of any leaseholds offered by the Custo-
dian with the right to convert to conditional freehold, may, with the
consent of the Administrator, convert to a conditional freehold, but
any such completion or conversion shall be at the purchaser’s expense.
(3.) Every title shall be subject to any laws or ordinances of the
Territory of New Guinea from time to time in force relating to land.
54. Until payment of the full amount of the purchase money, the
purchaser shall covenant with the Custodian that the purchaser will,
to the satisfaction of the Custodian, or his duly authorized agent, keep
and maintain plantations well planted and cultivated, and reasonably
clean and free from weeds, pests and diseases, and will maintain all
other property in good order and condition, fair wear and tear alone
excepted.
55. (1.) Unless the Custodian otherwise determines the purchaser
shall, within fourteen days after he becomes entitled to possession of
the property, insure with a company approved by the Custodian, and
shall, until the full amount of the purchase money has been paid, keep
so insured from fire, to the full insurable value thereof, all dwellings,
offices, and other permanent buildings, jetties, vehicles, vessels, boats,
and copra-drying kilns included in the property purchased.


(2.) If the purchaser fails to insure the property in accordance
with the provisions of this regulation or, having insured the property,
fails for any period of fourteen days or more to keep it so insured,
the Custodian or his duly authorized agent may cancel the contract

NOTES FOR THE INFORMATION OF TENDERERS.
AUSTRALIAN SOLDIER.
The term “ Australian soldier,” as used in this catalogue, means a
person who is an Australian soldier within the meaning of the Austra-
lian Soldiers’ Repatriation Act 1920-1922, and includes a person, being
a British subject, who served with the Naval or Military Forces of any
Australian Colony or any State of the Commonwealth of Australia in
the South African War, which commenced on the eleventh day of
October, One thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine, and terminated
on the thirty-first day of May, One thousand nine hundred and two.
ALTERNATIVE TENDERS.
Tenderers may submit separate tenders for several properties,
lodging one deposit to cover all tenders.
Under this provision, however, only one of the tenders lodged can be
accepted. Tenderers must indicate, by numbering the tenders, the
order in which they wish the tenders considered, and deposit a sum
representing 5 per centum of the highest price tendered for any property.
As an illustration of this system, let it be supposed there are three
properties, designated A, B, and G. A tenderer wishes to purchase A,
but, if his tender for that property w r as not accepted, “would tender for
C. Similarly he would tender for B should he be unsuccessful in his
offers for A and C.
Under the alternative system of tendering he would submit three
tenders, one for A marked No. 1, another for C marked No. 2, and
another for B marked No. 3, and cover them with a deposit of 5 per
centum of the highest tender.
If his tender for A was accepted, the other tenders would not be
considered. If the tender for A was not accepted, his tender for C
would be dealt with, and so on, until either a tender had been accepted,
or all rejected.
PAYMENTS OF PURCHASE MONEY,
Payments of purchase money may be made at Canberra, Sydney,
Melbourne, Ilabaul, or such other place as may be determined by the
Custodian.
MATURITY OP PALMS.
The age at which a coco-nut palm generally reaches the fully-
bearing stage is about ten years.
TRADING ACCOUNTS OP PLANTATIONS.

B. 14. UPPER SEEBERG PLANTATION.
General Description of Property.
An uncultivated plantation, with an area of 260 hectares, situated on
the north coast of Hew Britain, in the Baining district, approximately
50 miles from Babaul.
Title.
This property, with the exception of 60 hectares, is entered in the
Groundbook, and has been surveyed. The portion of the property not
entered in the Groundbook will have to be surveyed. On completion of
the survey of the 60 hectares the survey of the whole property (260
hectares) will be acceptable to the Administration.
The cost of the survey, and all other expenses incurred in connexion
with the registration of the 60 hectares, must be borne by the purchaser.
The Groundbook does not show the existence of native rights over
the property.
Government improvement conditions are set out in the Groundbook
as follow:-
“Provision is made that (a) the said land shall revert to the
Crown if it is not properly taken in hand; and that ( b ) parts or
portions shall revert to the Crown, if required for the purpose of
extracting mineral wealth, or for public works, having reference
to approval dated 10th October, 1907.”
The Government improvement condition relating to the reversion
of the property to the Crown provides for one-fifth of the land to be
cleared and planted within five years, and three-fourths within fifteen
years. If the purchaser cannot prove that this condition has been
fulfilled, or that circumstances prevented the fulfilment of such condi-
tion, the uncleared portion of the land reverts to the Crown.
It is not the intention of the present Administration of the Terri-
tory of Hew Guinea to waive such improvement condition, but the
Administration has indicated that it will not commence to operate
against a purchaser until the land is registered under the Lands
Registration Ordinance. The effect of this is to give ample time to
a purchaser to make such further improvements as may be necessary.
The Custodian considers a freehold title will issue for this property,
subject to the above, and to the conditions of sale as set out on
pages 21-28.
Further information may be obtained on application to the Custodian.

C.A. 1. RAULAWAT PLANTATION.
General Description.
A coco-nut plantation situated on the north coast of Hew Britain,
24 miles by road from Eabaul. It has an area of 651.32 hectares, of
which 225 hectares are planted with coco-nut palms, leaving available
426.32 hectares for further planting. The palms number 28,386, but
as about 300 are on land unsuitable for coco-nuts, the number of palms
may be taken as 28,086. There is a good “ south-east ” anchorage.

Portion of Plantation.
Title.
The property is entered in the Groundbook, with the exception of
382.36 hectares. The portion not so entered, however, has been sur-
veyed.
The survey is acceptable to the Administration.
The records do not show the existence of any native rights over the
property.
Government improvement conditions are set out in the Groundbook
as follows: —
“ Caution for the preservation of the right to re-transfer in case
the land is not properly taken in hand, and to re-transfer of por-
tions of land which are required in connexion with the exploitation
of minerals or for public purposes. Reference is made to the con-
sent of 21st May, 1909.”


(This condition is applicable to an area of about 134 hectares in the
northern part of the plantation.)
“ (a) Caution for the preservation of the right to re-transfer in
case of improper usage of the land, and to re-transfer of portions of
land which are required in connexion with the exploitation of
minerals, or for public purposes; and
(b) An obligation on the part of the owner for the time being
to maintain the public roads which intersect or touch the property,
and to suffer the drainage of rain-water over the property.”
(These conditions apply to an area of about 134 hectares south of
the Tabaule River.)
It will be noted that the portions of the land already entered in the
Groundbook are subject to re-transfer in case the land is not taken in
hand, or in case of improper usage of the land.
The Government improvement condition in question provides for
one-fifth of the land to be cleared and planted within five years, and
three-fourths within fifteen years. If the purchaser cannot prove
that this condition has been fulfilled, or that circumstances prevented
the fulfilment of such condition, the uncleared portion of the land
reverts to the Crown.
It is not the intention of the present Administration of the Terri-
tory of Hew Guinea to waive such improvement condition, but the
Administration has indicated that it will not commence to operate
against a purchaser until the land is registered under the Lauds Regis-
tration Ordinance. The effect of this is to give ample time to a
purchaser to make such further improvements as may be necessary.
The Custodian guarantees a freehold title, subject to the above, and
to the conditions of sale as set out on pages 21-28.

(Kanaka) coco-nut palms in bearing.
Title. .
Title. —This property is entered in the Groundbook, and has been
surveyed. The survey is acceptable to the Administration.
The records do not show the existence of any native rights over the
property.
The Government improvement conditions, as set out in the Ground-
book, are: —
“ Provision is made by the Crown Lands Department of the Protec-
torate of German New Guinea to secure the following claims: —
(a) The said land to revert to the Crown if same is not taken
in hand, or not properly taken in hand and cultivated.
( b ) Parts or portions of the said land to revert to the Crown
if required for roads, public works, &c.
(c) To permit rain water being drained on to or through the
said property, and to keep the boundaries of the property
clear.”
The Government improvement condition relating to the reversion
of the property to the Crown provides for one-fifth of the land to be
cleared and planted within five years, and three-fourths within fifteen
years. If the purchaser cannot prove that this condition has been
fulfilled, or that circumstances prevented the fulfilment of such condi-
tion, the uncleared portion of the land reverts to the Crown.


It is not the intention of the present Administration of the Terri-
tory of Hew Guinea to waive such improvement condition, but the
Administration has indicated that it will not commence to operate
against a purchaser until the land is registered under the Lands
Registration Ordinance. The effect of this is to give ample time to
a purchaser to make such further improvements as may be necessary.
It is anticipated that a freehold title will be given subject to the
encumbrances stated and the conditions of sale as set out on pages 21-28.


D. 6. WEBERHAFEN AND TAPALIK (VIRGIN LAND).

Tapalik . . . . . . 884 hectares
Title. —Weberhafen. Groundbook Eeference, Vol. 1, Folio 98
(Gazelle Peninsula). To determine the native rights on this property
five subdivisions were effected, and an area of 2,584.37 hectares deleted
from the title. With these subdivisions all encumbrances “ reserving
rights to natives ” were cancelled.
Title. —Tapalik. Groundbook Eeference, Yol. 2, Folio 145 (Gazelle
Peninsula). The records do not show the existence of any native rights
over the property.
These properties are entered in the Groundbook, and have been
surveyed. The surveys will be accepted by the Administration.
The Groundbook does not show any record of Government im-
provement conditions over these properties.
The Custodian guarantees a freehold title, subject to the above and
to the conditions of sale as set out on pages 21-28.


D. 7. MORTLOCK’S GROUP PLANTATION.
General Description.
The Custodian’s half interest in a coco-nut plantation consisting of a
group of 20 small islands, situated 120 miles north-east of Bougainville
by sea. There is a good anchorage.
The islands have an estimated area of 90 hectares, of which 81.1
hectares are planted with coco-nut palms, numbering 20,191, leaving
8.9 hectares available for further planting.
The planted area, viz., 81.1 hectares is in full bearing, producing
10 tons of copra monthly.
The soil is sandy.
Two bungalows (No. 1, built of lime and stone, with galvanized
iron roof, 4 rooms; No. 2, built of sawn timber and galvanized iron
roof, 3 rooms), together with store, dryer, and equipment in fair con-
dition are on the property.
The plantation carries about 57 labourers.
Tenderers should carefully note that the Custodian is selling only
his half-interest in this plantation. The other half interest is held by
Mrs. Calder, of Kieta, Territory of New Guinea.
Title.
This property is entered in the Groundbook, and has been sur-
veyed, showing an area of 690 hectares. The area should be approxi-
mately 90 hectares. It would seem the German Government, when
surveying these islands, did so at low water, and included the surround-
ing reefs. That would have the effect of making the area much greater
than is actually available for habitation, and accounts for the dis-
crepancy between the Groundbook survey of 690 hectares and the
approximate area of 90 hectares mentioned above.
The records do not show the existence of any native rights over the
property.
The Groundbook does not show any record of Government improve-
ment conditions.
The Custodian guarantees a freehold title, subject to the above and
to the conditions of sale as set out on pages 21-28.
