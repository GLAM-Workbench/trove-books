CHRONOLOGICAL NOTES FOR 1868.
Golden Number 7 I Solar Cycle 1 j Roman ludiction 11
Enact 6 | Dominical Letter ED | Julian Period 6581
EXPLANATIONS OF CHRONOLOGICAL NOTES.
Gregorian Calendar, or New Style.—Previous to 1582 the length of the year had been
reckoned at 365 days and 6 hours, as computed by Julius Csesar(B.c. 45); but as the true length of a
solar vear is only 365 days, s'hours, and about 49 minutes, an error had arisen from this computation,
amounting in 1582 to 10 days in advance. To rectify the Calendar, and to prevent future irregu-
larities, it was decreed as follows by Pope Gregory XIII:
The year 1582 to consist of 355 days
The ordinary year to consist of 365 „
The year 1584, and every fourth year afterwards (termed leap year) to consist of.. 366 ~
The years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, and so on—three out of every four centuries
afterwards, to be reckoned not as leap years, but as ordinary years of 365 ~
This mode of computation, termed the Gregorian Calendar, or New Style, has been gradually
adopted in all the countries of Europe, except Russia and Greece, where the Old Style still prevails.
' The New Style was adopted in Great Britain in 1752, when it was enacted that September 3
of that year should be reckoned as September 14 (the difference of time then amounting to 11 days).
During the present century the difference between the Old and New Styles is 12 days; this time
must therefore be allowed for in Russian and Greek bills. Thus a Russian bill dated March 2, must
be reckoned as dated March 14.
Leap year may be readily ascertained by dividing any given year—for instance, 1850 —by 4;
if there is no remainder, it is leap year. If there be a remainder, as in dividing 1855, the number
over shows how many years it is after leap year.
Golden Number.—Golden Number in chronology is that number which indicates the year
of the lunar cycle, for any given time. It was called the Gctden Number, because in the ancient
calendar it was written in letters of gold, on account of its great usefulness in ecclesiastical compu-
tations, especially in fixing the time of Easter. It was likewise called the Prime, because it pointed
out the first day of the new moon, primum lunee. To find the Golden Number, add 1 to the year
of our Lord, divide the sum by 19, and the remainder is the Golden Number, the quotient at the
same time expressing the number of cycles which have revolved from the beginning of the year pre-
ceding the birth of Christ.
Solar Cycle, or Cycle of the Sun.—A period of 28 years.
Dominical Letter.—Dominical Letter, in chronology, is that letter of the alphabet which points
out in the calendar the Sundays throughout the year, thence also called the Sunday Letter or Dies
Domini. The Dominical Letter may be found universally, for any year of any century, thus: Divide
the centuries by 4, and take twice what remains from 6, then add the remainder to the odd years,
above the even centuries, and their 4th. Divide their sum by 7, and the remainder, taken from 7,
will leave the number answering to the Letter required.
Roman Indiction. —Indiction (Cycle of); in chronology, a mode of computing time by the space
of fifteen years, instituted by Constantine the Great; originally the period for the payment of certain
taxes. The popes since the time of Charlemagne have dated their acts by the year of the Indiction,
wliich was fixed on the first of January. At the time of the reformation of the calendar, the year
1582 was reckoned the tenth year of the Indiction. Now this date, when divided by 15, leaves a
remainder 7, that is, 3 less than the Indiction, and the same must necessarily be the case in all-eub-
sequent cases; so that, in order to find the Indiction for any year, divide the date by 15, and add 3
to the remainder. It has no connection with the motions of the heavenly bodies.
Julian Period.—Julian Period, in chronology, signifies a revolution of 7980 years, which arises
from multiplying the Solar cycle, the cycle of the moon, and the cycle of indiction into one another.
This period is of great use, as the standard and general receptacle of ail other epoclias, periods, and
cycles: into this, as into a large ocean, all the streams of time discharge themselves, yet so as not to
lose their peculiar characters; and had historians-remarked the number of each cycle in each year
respectively, there could have been no dispute about the time of any action or event in past age*.
When the Christian Era commenced, 4713 years of the Julian Period were elapsed, 4713 therefore
being added to the year of our Lord, will give the year of the Julian Period

Almanacs, the Arabic from Ahnana, to count.—Among the first almanacs ever issued was John
Sorner’a calendar, written in Oxford in 1380. The first printed one was published at Buda, 1472 ;
and the first printed one in England by Richard Pynson, in 1497. Of the English Moore’s almanac,
(under the management of the able computer of the Nautical Ephemeris—Henry Andrews) at one
time upwards of 430,000 copies were annually sold. It was during the existence of the Stamp Duty
on almanacs that this one had this enormous sale. Since its abolition in 1834 competitors have
become almost innumerable.
ANY MORE ROOM IN GREAT BRITAIN 1
The third report of the Emigration Committee quotes a table drawn up by William Couling,
C.E., in 1827, in which it was stated three-quarters of the entire profitable land in Great Britain
■was then under cultivation. Between that time and 1854 the remaining quarter was brought into
use ; so that we may reckon that there is no room for extension of agriculture or pastoral pursuits,
and consequently that her rapidly accumulating thousands of human beings must find elbow-room
outside her boundaries. Let us lay ourselves out for them at oi
outside her boundaries. Let us lay ourselves out for them at once. s • yf s,/

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING
WILL.
A Will made in language too simple or concise ; it must be written with ink on paper or
parchment, and if contained on one sheet must be signed at the end by the testator in the presence of
two or more witnesses; and, if written on more than one sheet, the testator and the witnesses had
better sign each sheet.
The witnesses (0) must rigidly comply with every particular required by the Attestation Clause, at
the end of which clause they must sign their names (t).
The signature of the testator must be acknowledged by him in the presence of the witnesses ; and
in order that this be properly done he must (after having signed the Will) take it in his hand and
say, “ I acknowledge this to be my last Will and Testament and request you to witness it." To avoid
the evils of intestacy, the following form may suffice as a general guide ; but others, properly pre-
pared for filling up and signing, with the various conditions hereinafter described, can generally be
procured from respectable stationers.
WILL.
This is the last Will and Testament of me, of near in the county of
. After payment of my just debts, funeral, and Testamentary expenses, I give, devise,
and bequeath unto (c) also to (b) . And to the residue and remainder (d) of
all my real and personal Estate, I give, devise, and bequeath the same unto (c) And I
hereby appoint (c y c), or the survivor of them, and (c) Executors of this my Will, as wit-
ness my band this day of 18 ■
m These must be parties not interested in the Will, or their claim to such interest becomes forfeited,
(c) In all cases where a name is given, it is essential to describe fully and clearly the Christian
nanD'. Surname, Residence, and Trade or Profession. .
id - The residue becomes the property of the next of kin, unless otherwise provided for.

ATTESTATION.
Signed and acknowledged by the said the Testator, as and for his last Will and
I
Testament,
in the presence of us, being present at the same time, who at his request,
in his
presence, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as Witnesses. )
A Codicil to a.Will is to be made with the same regulations
as the Will itself,
and may bo written
thus :
♦
11th Month.
NOVEMBER.
30 Days.
This is a Codicil to my last Will and Testament, bearing date the day of IS ,
and which I direct to be taken as part thereof. I give, devise, and bequeath, <fcc. As witness my
hand tins day of
Marriage after making a Will renders the Will void.
If a person wish to dispose of all his property In one gift, the words “all my real and personal
estate ” may be used.
It is not indispensable for a Witness to know tlie contents of a Will, which may be so folded as to
prevent any other part than the Signature and Attestation Clause being road.
It may be useful to remark that Personal* Property left without a Will is divisible as under —
If the deceased leave Children and no Widow, the whole Property is to be divided equally amongst
ly amongst
the Children.
If he leave a Widow and Child or Children, the former is entitled to one-third,t and the latter to
the remaining two-thirds,
If he leave a Widow auono Child, the former is entitled to half and the next of kin to the remain-
der, as under
A Father, the whole amount.
If no Father,- a Mother, Brothers, and Sisters, or their issue, equal portions.
If none, Uncles,' Aunts, Nephews' and Nieces, equal portions, l:c.

Leap-Year or Bissextile, originated with the astronomers of Julius Caesar, 45 b.c. They fixed
the solar years at 365 days 6 hours, comprising, as they thought, the period from one vernal equinox
to another ; the six hours were set aside, and at the end of four years, forming a day, the fourth year
was made to consist of 366 days. The day thus added was called intercalary, and was placed a day
before the 24th of February, the sixth of the calends, which was reckoned twice, hence called
or twice sixth. This added day with us is February 29th. See Calendar. The difference
between 365 days 6 hours, and 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 51 seconds and 6 decimals, which last is
the true date of the astronomical year, in the course of years causes 1700, 1800, and 1900« not to be
leap-years ; but the year 2000 will be one.
Biting the Nails.—This is a habit that should be immediately corrected in children, as, if per-
sisted in for any length of time it permanently deforms the nails. Dipping the some
ibitter tincture will generally prevent children from putting them to the mouth; but -if this fails, as
it sometimes will, each finger-end ought to be encased in a stall until the propensity is eradicated. ’

in a tea-cup of hot water ; rub the stained part well with the solution.

* To Soften the Skin and Improve the Complexion.—lf flowers of sul-
phur "be mixed in a little milk, and after standing an hour or two the milk
(without disturbing the sulphur) be rubbed into the skin, it will keep it soft, and
make the c mplexion clear. It is to be used before washing.’ A. lady of our
acquaintance adopted the above suggestion. In about a fortnight she wrote to ns
to say that the mixture became so disagreeable after it had been made a few days
that she could not use it. We should have wondered if she could—the milk be-
came putrid The mixture being prepared over night should only be used in the
me riling : about a wine-glass-ful made for each occasion would suffice.

Fruits for Children. — That fruits are naturally healthy in their season, if
rightly taken, no one who believes that the Creator is a kind and beneficent Being
can doubt. And yet the use of summer fruits appears often to cause most fatal
diseases, especially in children. Why is this ? Because we do not conform to the
natural laws in using this kind of diet. These laws are very simple and easy to
understand. Let the fruit be ripe when you eat it; and eat when you require
food. Fruits that have seeds are much healthier than the stone fruits But all

fruits are better, for very young children, if baked or
cooked in
some manner,
and
eaten with bread
The French always
eat bread with raw fruit
Apples and
winter pears are very excellent food for children-
—indeed, for almost anv person in
health ; but best when eaten for breakfast or dinner.
If taken late in the evem
ing fruit often proves injurious. The old saying,
that apples are gold
in the morn-
inq, silver. at noon, and lead at night, is
pretty near the truth.
Both apples
and
pears are often good and nutritious when baked or
stewed
for those delicate
constitutions that cannot bear raw fruit
Much of the fruit when gathered
un-
ripe might be rendered lit for food by preserving in sugar.

Impressions from Prints. —
The print is soaked first in a
solution of potash,
and then
in one oi
tartaric acid.
This produces a perfect diffusion of crystals in
bi-tartrate of potash through the texture of the unprmted part of the paper.
As this salt repels oil, the ink-roller may now be passed over the surface, without
transferring any of its contents to the paper, except in those parts to which the
ink had been originally applied.
The ink of the print prevents the saline matter
from penetrating wherever it is
present, and wherever there is no
saline matter
present the ink adheres, so that many impressions may be
taken as in

Hints about Making Preserves. —It is not generally known that boiling
iruit a long time, and shimming it well, without the sugar , and without a cover to
the preserving-pan, is a very economical and excellent way — economical, because
the bulk of the scum rises from the fruit, and not from the sugar, if the latter is
good ; and boiling it without a cover, allows the evaporation of all the watery
particles therefrom ; the preserves keep firm and well flavoured. The propor-
tions are, three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Jam made in
this way, of currants, strawberries, raspberries, or gooseberries, is excellent.

GARDENING.
[We are indebted to Messrs. Law, Somner, and Co., £or permission to extract
the following from their “ Handbook to the Garden.”]
JANUARY.
Kitchen Garden. —When this month proves hot and dry, very little sowing
or transplanting can be done excepting where facilities for irrigation exist. In
private gardens, a succession of crops may be raised by a liberal and judicious use
of the water-pot. On the occurrence of suitable weather, or with an artificial
supply of moisture, the following may be sown successfully, viz., peas, early kinds;
kidney beans, of the earlier varieties; lettuce, in drills where intended to stand ;
a few early-horn carrots ; onions, for salads; celery, a good sowing; turnips, both
white and yellow; and round spinach, in small quantity. Seed of quick-headinw
sorts of cabbage and cauliflower may be sown to provide for autumn planting. A
few marrows may be sown for late use. Thin former sowings of spinach, carrots,
turnips, and lettuce ; and in doing this, single them out at once to the full distance
at which the plants are intended to stand. Plant out cabbages and cauliflowers,
choosing none but strong plants. Celery may be planted in trenches if water be
available, care being taken to leave as much earth as possible about the roots.
Tomatoes and capsicums, if any still remain in pots, may be planted out early in the
month. Cucumbers, melons, marrows, pumpkins, &c., will need attention in
thinning out the shoots, stopping, and watering. Plant early varieties of potatoes.
Fruit Garden. —For disbudding with the finger and thumb, the season is
almost too far advanced, but a partial thinning of superfluous shoots may be given
with the pruning knife to peach trees and to some varieties of plums. Apricots,
when inclined to throw long naked shoots, should be stopped. The British Queen
Strawberry may be kept in bearing by copious waterings "during dry weather, and
by mulching the bed with spent tan. This is a fine flavoured and prolific variety,
and can be obtained in quantity in the colony. Budding may be proceeded with
when the shoots are in proper condition, which is when the bark separates freely
from the wood. In dry weather a heavy soaking for a night or two previously
will put them in order, and mulching will serve to keep them so. Prepare com-
post for planting and dressing fruit trees. All fruit trees maybe budded now, in-
including oranges, lemons, shaddocks, &c.
Flower Garden. —The dryness of the weather usually prevents the sowing of
flower seeds. As a fine autumn show is desirable, weather permitting, vacant
spaces should be sown with annuals, or planted with such as have been raised in
beds in shady places. Roses may be budded, regard being had to the sorts which
do best when budded, for some kinds succeed best when thus grown, and others
upon their own roots. Dahlias, chrysanthemums, phloxes, and all tall-growing
plants should be carefully staked and tied. Finish taking up bulbs that may
r quire to be parted, but every other year is often enough if the bulbs were pro-
perly planted in the first instance. Pot plants will require shading during the
heat of the day, and water morning and evening.
FEBRUARY.
Kitchen Garden.—On the occurrence of moist weather, the ground, it is pre-
sumed, having been previously well prepared, the following may be sown largely,
viz., cabbages, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, turnips, and swedes. On a limited
scale, sow early-horn carrots, onions, spinach, and peas of early varieties. Plant
out largely of cauliflowers and cabbages. Sow brocoli, Brussel’s sprouts, and
other winter greens. A few kidney beans may be sown upon chance for a late
crop. If the ground be too dry to sow or plant, all spare time should be employed
in preparing land for future crops. Plant out celery in trenches. Radishes and


small salads may be sown as required at any time if a supply of water be at com-
mand ; little, however, can be done in that way during the hottest season of the
year. Leeks may now be planted out.
Fruit Garden. —The work of this department consists chiefly of gathering and
storing fruits, many of which are ripe at this season. Budding fruit trees generally,
and the orange tribe, as directed for last month, may be continued. Look over
the early budded plants, and let those that have failed be worked again. Prepare
ground for planting,
Flower Garden. —Take advantage of moist weather to sow hardy annuals.
By this we do not mean such only as are usually termed hardy, but all except the
very tenderest. By sowing early in autumn, most annuals get strong enough
before winter to stand well, and give the finest bloom in spring. Those who wait
until August or September to sow rarely see them in perfection. Dry lying ground
should be chosen for annuals at this season. Stake and tie dahlias, chrysanthe-
mums, and other tall growers, and, if needed, supply them with water or liquid
manure. Continue to bud roses, perpetuals, hybrid chinas, noisettes or bourbons,
which were budded early and have become firmly set, may be headed back to a
joint beyond the bud; they will then make a fine autumn growth. Prune back
slightly the autumn-blooming kinds, and give them a good soaking of liquid
manure. Cut back fuchsias to within one or two eyes of the stem as they cease
flowering. If the weather be dry, a little liquid manure will be of service to
chrysanthemums. If the weather be dry, gladioli, tigridias, and liliums will need
watering occasionally ; gladioli should also be staked. It is now time to make an
early planting of bulbs, such as anemone, ranunculus, crocus, tulip, hyacinth,
narcissus, iris, sparaxis, ixia, watsonia, tritonia, and the spring blooming kinds
of gladiolus.
MAECH,
Kitchen Garden. —Most of the hardy vegetables may be sown this month to a
considerable extent. Turnips, both white and yellow, peas, of early varieties,
broad beans, and spinach, lettuce, cabbage and cauliflower; carrots of the early-
horn variety, onions, and red beet, in limited quantity for use. As soon as large
enough plant out cabbage and cauliflower, also a full crop of celery, and draw a
little earth to any former plantings that may be large enough. Thin advancing
crops of spinach, lettuce, onions, turnips, &c. Radishes and small salads will
now do well. Plant out any leeks that may remain in the seed bed. Those who
wish to grow water cress may plant them in a trench, in the bottom of which a
layer of thoroughly rotten dung should be placed. A little water until they have
fairly rooted is indispensable, after which they will produce very well through the
winter by the aid of casual showers. Either seed or cuttings may be used in
forming the bed.
Fruit Garden. —Now is the best time to make strawberry plantations, using
for the purpose runners of the present season. Prepare for planting fruit trees by
trenching the land. Trees always succeed better on land that has been worked a
couple of months previously than upon newly turned soil; and, we may add, there
is always work enough to be done at the planting season without having also that
of trenching to perform.
Flower Garden. —The first work of the month should be bulb planting. The
kinds suitable for planting are those mentioned in the last month’s calendar, to
which, therefore, we refer. A few hyacinths and early varieties of tulips, of
which the double kinds are best, may be planted in pots, for indoor decoration
when in bloom. The soil for pots should be tolerably rich and have a fair admix-
ture of sand; there should also be plenty of drainage. If the weather prove
moist, evergreens of many kinds may be planted more advantageously than later
in the season, to which end trenching and otherwise preparing the land should be
proceeded with as above recofnmended. Sow annuals as directed in the February
calendar. Plant cuttings of pinks, carnations, and the hybrid varieties of dianthus.
Propagate pansies, sweet-williams, and other perennial plants by divisions or by
cuttings. Towards the end of the month rose cuttings may be planted. Summer
blooming bulbs may be taken up stored sms soon as the foliage turns yellow,.


Now is the time to plant the tuberous kinds of Tropceolum. Chrysanthemums,,
see last month.
APRIL.
Kitchen Garden. —Sow peas of early varieties, broad beans, spinach, parsnip,
carrot, and radishes ; sow and transplant largely of lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower,
and brocoli. Plant rhubarb and seakale in ground deeply trenched and -well
manured. Earth up celery, and make a further planting. Turnips may be sown
largely, and former sowings be singled out to suitable distances. It is now time
to plant potato-onions, garlick, and shallots. Earth up advancing crops of
potatos, and let late crops of peas be staked, as they do not pod well in winter
when trailing on the ground. Keep down slugs among cabbage and cauliflower.
Fruit Garden. —The work of trenching and digging is the chief work of this
department; draining also should be attended to where requisite. The gathering
and storing of late fruit should now be completed at once. Begin planting goose-
berries, currants, raspberries, almonds, plums; anything, in fact, which has gone
to rest, which may be known by their having shed their leaves. The date of this
occurrence varies greatly, according to the character of the season. Strawberries
may still be planted, or indeed at any time during autumn and winter. This is
the best month for planting out the orange tribe, provided the weather be favour-
able. Fruit pips and stones should now be sown for raising stocks.
Flower Garden.— Pot plants are the proper kind of stock with which to
commence the season’s planting, and next, a great variety of evergreens. Tie up
chrysanthemums and secure against winds. The division of perennials recom-
mended last month may still be carried out. Poses and rose-cuttings may be
planted, and when pot culture is intended, now is a very good season to begin.
Pemove all suckers from the root and stem of budded roses. Sow a few hardy
annuals and perennials, especially stocks and wallflowers on vacant spots, or plant
out a few from the seed beds. Carnations, &c., may still be piped or struck from
cuttings ; it is a certain mode of propagation and far better than layering. Make
a further planting of bulbs. Pot hyacinths in good rich soil in six inch pots. As
rain may be expected this month look well to drains.
Kitchen Garden. —To get early peas and beans, May is the best month for
sowing. At first sow 7 the earlier varieties of peas, but towards the close of the
month, some of the finer kinds, such as climax, will do well. Sow moderately of
quick-heading kinds of cabbage and cauliflower, and plant out further from the
seed beds; but be sure that the plants are young and in free growth, for old plants
will be very liable to run when they ought to head. A few brocoli may be planted;
also spinach, radish, and lettuce. Onions may be sown for transplanting or for
use green. Plant garlick, shallots, and potato-onions. Clear the haulm off
asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale beds, and make new beds of the two last. Apply
a good dressing of manure to the old beds, and to asparagus a dressing of salt in
addition. Perennial herbs may be divided and replanted. Prepare a hot-bed
on which to raise cucumbers and melons. Commence to force rhubarb, asparagus,
and sea-kale, for which hot dung, duly prepared, will be required. Continue to
transplant celery. Clear away all decayed plants, weeds, and other rubbish.
Fruit Garden. —The work of planting and preparing land will be the same as
for last month, except that planting should now proceed in earnest. Oranges,
lemons, and this tribe in general, if planted this month, should be w'ell protected
from prevailing winds. Pruning may commence on trees that have fully shed their
leaves, but to prune them before that has happened would be highly injurious.
Flower Garden. —The planting of ornamental shrubs and trees may proceed,
remembering that early planted ones have by far the best chance of succeeding.
Alteration in the plan of grounds, or the work of laying out new ones, should be
completed forthwith. Continue last month’s work amongst roses. Dahlias may
be lifted and stored. Annuals may be sown, care being taken that the ground
does not want for drainage. Chrysanthemums being now in full bloom, advantage
should be taken to mark the colours, with a view to proper regulations, where this


desirable object bas been previously neglected. Bulbs may be planted, and very
late ones lifted. The directions for the last two months are equally applicable to
the present one. Tropceolums, tricolor , Jarrattii, &c., may now be planted.
JUNE.
Kitchen Garden. —Sow largely of peas, both early and late varieties. Broad
beans also may be sown largely. Sow cabbage and cauliflower; also plant out.
Sow Brussels sprouts, carrots, and spinach. Plant out lettuce, and sow again.
Earth up celery. Thin onions and transplant. Turnips may be sown, but not to
any great extent, for the success of this crop will depend upon the character of
the season. When forced sea-kale and rhubarb are required, the plants must be
covered with pots or boxes, and over and around these a bed of hot dung, pre-
pared as for a hot-bed. Those who wish to grow early cucumbers and melons
should now sow them on a hot-bed. A one-light frame will serve to raise the seed
in pots, and whilst the plants are getting ready the permanent bed must be pre-
pared. Make a hot-bed towards the end of the month, on which to sow capsicums,
tomatoes, and tender herbs early in July. Prepare ground and plant asparagus.
Fruit Garden. —Where the cuttings from vines are intended to be planted,
let them be gathered up on the day they are cut, and be laid in the ground in
rows; let each sort also be kept separate, and carefully labelled. All kinds of
fruit trees may be planted, and new strawberry beds made, but these will not
bear the first season as good a crop as will the earlier planted ones. Pruning
should be prosecuted with vigour.
Flower Garden. —Transplanting is still the chief work of this department,
and whilst this is extensively proceeding it is a difficult matter to keep the garden
perfectly neat, still this point should never be lost sight of altogether. Grass plots
may now be made, and edgings and hedges planted. Plant out annuals and
biennials from the seed beds ; prime and plant cuttings of roses early in the
month, and attend to last month’s directions generally. Bulbs may still be
planted, but the Dutch kinds, which are natives of a cool climate, should be
planted at once.
JULY.
Kitchen Garden. —lf the season promises to be early and dry, the sowing of
main crops of carrots, parsnips, scorzonera, salsify, beet, onions, and leeks, should
be proceeded with earlier than would otherwise be advisable. If sown too early,
and the season prove a growing one, these crops are very liable to run to seed ;
from the end of this month, therefore, to the middle of next, is generally regarded
as the safest time. This, however, will be modified by local conditions, such as
soil, exposure, &c. Carrots, onions, and leeks, may, at any rate, be sown to a
moderate extent early in the month. Former sowings of onions, thin and trans-
plant. Sow small salading. Peas and broad beans may be sown to any extent;
advancing crops may be earthed up a little. A few potatos of early varieties
may be planted on a piece of well-worked dry-lying ground ; and the new dung-
heap may be utilized by covering with soil and planting upon it some early potatos.
Cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce may be sown and transplanted as required.
Spinach may be sown, and former sowings may be thinned; sow parsley and
other herbs, and divide the perennial kinds if more plants are needed. Any
garlick, shallots, or potato-onions still out of ground should be planted at once.
Attend to forcing of sea-kale, asparagus, and rhubarb, as recommended last
month. New beds may also be made; old ones should be forked lightly over,
and put in order for the growing season. Sustain the heat of cucumber beds by
occasional linings of hot dung. Sow capsicums, chillies, and other peppers,
tomatoes, and tender herbs on a gentle hot-bed. Globe artichokes may be planted,
and old beds be dug over. Jerusalem artichokes may also be planted at convenience.
Fruit Garden. —Continue and finish pruning generally, taking the kinds in
the order of their earliness. Trim off the dead leaves of strawberries, and fork
over the beds, giving at the same time a light dressing of well-rotted dung, if the
soil stands in need of it. All kinds of fruit trees may be planted, but this wou’i
have been better done earlier. Grafting may also now be done.


Flower Garden. —Prune and plant roses ; if a succession of bloom be required,
prune at various times, say, first one-fourtb, and ten days later another batch,
and so on; they will thus bloom in succession. A few tender annuals may be
sown on a hot-bed for future transplanting, and hardy ones to be sown as required
in the open ground. Phloxes, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks, and many other
perennials may be divided. Shrubs of various kinds may be transplanted. Some
of the late kinds of Cape bulbs, such as amaryllis and alstroemeria, should now be
planted, and a few of the choice kinds of gladioli, the bulk of these last being
retained until later in the season.
AUGUST.
Kitchen Garden. —Complete the sowing of main crops in the following order :
onions, leeks, carrots, parsnips, salsify, scorzonera, and beet (both red and
silver.) Sow largely of peas and broad beans, but more sparingly than before.
Still sow and transplant cabbages and cauliflower. Plant the principal crop of
potatos as soon as possible. Sow spinach, lettuce, radishes, and salads generally.
Carry out last month’s directions with regard to asparagus, llhubarb and sea-kale
may be forced by simply covering with dung. Forward potatos should be earthed
up as they grow, and a few fern branches stuck over them will help to protect
them from frost. On a warm border, and in early situations, a few vegetable
marrows and dwarf French beans may be sown on the chance of an early crop.
Cucumbers on hot-beds must be kept growing by a liberal supply of bottom heat.
More may be sown in pots for planting out. Sweet potatos may be started into
growth upon a hot-bed. Sow also capsicums and tomatoes in heat, and a few of
the latter on a warm border.
Fruit Garden. —This is a very favourable month for planting the orange tribe,
and the planting of other fruit trees should not be delayed ; indeed, in a forward
season it is now almost too late for early peaches, almonds, &c. Strawberries and
raspberries may still be planted, as also vines and vine-cuttings. Oranges may
be grafted; the grafting of apples and pears should be brought to a close early in
the month.
Flower Garden. —Seeds of all kinds may now be sown, the tenderest kinds,
such as balsams and cockscombs, on a hot-bed, or towards the end of the month
a few may be tried in the open ground. Thin and transplant annuals and biennials.
Dahlias may be planted, but reserve some for November, in order to insure a fine
autumn bloom. Propagate fuchsias, heliotropes, and other soft-wooded plants as
required. Roses may still be planted as directed last month ; also early and late
blooming varieties of Cape bulbs, including tigridias. Divide and transplant
phloxes, &c., and sow the annual kinds. Plants in pots will now require a good
deal of attention ; they must be shifted into larger pots as they grow, and water-
ing must be closely looked after. Azaleas and rhododendrons in pots should receive
now and then a little weak guano water when coming into bloom. Japan lilies
may be planted. Digging and cleaning in all department should be brought to a
close.
SEPTEMBER.
Kitchen Garden.— lf the sowing of main crops be not completed, it should
take precedence of all other work. Onions, leeks, carrots, parsnips, beet, and
other roots, are the kinds to which we allude. Potato planting also should be
finished early in the month. Peas, sow largely ; broad beans may still be tried.
The main crop of kidney beans may be sown this month. Lettuce should be sown
where they are intended to stand, as the weather may not be suitable for trans-
planting. The forcing of rhubarb and asparagus may be discontinued, but sea-kale
must be attended to as before directed. Plant Jerusalem artichokes if not already
done. Cabbages may still be sown and planted out largely; cauliflowers also may
be planted, but sowing should be done upon a limited scale, as they do not succeed
well during summer. Turnips may be sown now, but as they will have to be
used as soon as ready the area should be proportionate to demand. Asparagus
beds, if not already put in order, should be done at once, as the shoots begin to
show early in the month. A light sprinkling of salt and guano during showery


weather would prove beneficial. Clear away the dung that has been used in
forcing rhubarb and sea-kale, excepting sufficient to dig in, which should be done
at once. Sow and plant out capsicums, chillies, tomatoes ; sow also vegetable
marrows, cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, gourds, and squashes, being guided as to
date by the appearance of the weather. Protection at night may be required for
the tenderest of these. Cucumbers on hot-beds may be more freely supplied with
air as the season advances. Leeks may be planted out; and now is the time to
sow sugar maize.
Fruit Garden.— No deciduous trees can safely be planted unless the season
be backward, but loquats, oranges, lemons, shaddocks, citrons, and guavas, may
be, and will succeed better than when planted during winter. Newly-planted
trees may need watering should the season prove dry, and the evergreen kinds
above mentioned would be the better for protection from wind, such as a flour
barrel without top or bottom would afford. All newly planted trees should be
securely staked if not already done. Oranges and lemons may now be grafted.
Head down trees budded last season. When vines have begun to grow freely,
*.c., when the first leaf or two on each shoot are fully developed, they may be
grafted if required, the scions for the purpose having been kept back by being
plunged in a border on the south side of the house. Underground grafting is the
best, and usually the most successful. Be particularly careful to destroy weeds
amongst vines at this season, the damage from spring frosts being always greatest
when weeds are present.
Flower Garden. —Shrubs and flowering plants may be planted out of pots
with every prospect of success, choosing fine settled weather for those that have
been kept under glass. Plant out the rooted cuttings of carnations, pinks, and
hybrid dianthus. Sow balsams, cockscombs, phloxes, thunbergias, petunias, and
all kinds of annuals, both hardy and tender. Thin and transplant former sowings.
Dahlias may be planted; and let the planting of roses be finished. Plant bulbs,
such as gladiolus, amaryllis, tuberoses, tigridias, Japan lilies, &c. Let climbing
plants be trained as they grow. The present is a good time to plant tritoma
uvaria, perennial phloxes, and other perennials. Loosen the soil either with fork
or hoe, which will not only benefit the plants, but add to the neat appearance of
the garden. Keep down weeds.
OCTOBER.
Kitchen Garden.—lf the season has become dry, little can be done in sowing
or planting; otherwise, the following may be sown:—onions, leeks, carrots,
parsnips, beet, salsify, peas, kidney beans, lettuce, spinach, turnips, and radishes,
the remarks in the preceding month being still applicable. Sow and transplant
cabbages largely, for summer crop. Sow the clasp-knife and other climbing beans;
afford sufficient room for stakes or other support. Plant potatos and earth up
the forward crops. All the above work should have been previously done unless
the weather was unfavourable. Early thinning of root crops is essential; this
and hoeing being the principal work of the month. Sow and plant out marrows,
squashes, gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, the varieties of peppers, and
tomatoes. Celery may be sown largely and planted out as convenience for water-
ing may dictate. Rhubarb will be improved by liquid manuring. Sugar maize
may still be sown.
Fruit Garden.— The chief work of the month should be thinning fruit and
disbudding or rubbing off with the finger and thumb the superfluous and misplaced
shoots, chiefly of peach trees, but of other trees also would time permit of it.
Vine shoots also will need thinning to the permanent number when danger of
frost has passed away. The shoots should be tied to prevent damage from wind
as soon as they are long enough to reach the stake or trellis. Strawberries should
now be mulched with tan or short grass, or straw, which is better. Continue to
plant out from pots well established oranges and other evergreen fruits, using the
precautions suggested last month.
Flower Garden. —lf the weather of the previous month has been unfavour-
able, the work of sowing tender annuals will still remain to be done. The chief
work, however, will be attention to newly-planted stock, in watering, staking, and


tying. The same kinds of bulbs and tubers may be planted as last month. Roses
may need syringing for the green fly, and picking for the leaf-rolling caterpillars ;
newly planted ones will require water should the weather prove dry, and all
suckers removed as they appear. Cinerarias and calceolarias will require shading
when the sun becomes too bright. Geraniums, fuchsias, and all pot plants will
require a free use of the syringe to keep down red spider and maintain a healthy
growth.
NOVEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —The raising of seeds, if the weather proves dry, demands a
little ingenuity on the part of the gardener. Few need be sown this month. All
the cucumber tribe will require special attention in stopping, watering, &c. ; they
may still be sown, but melons sown now will hardly ripen in ordinary seasons.
Tomatoes and peppers of sorts may still be sown and planted ; thin and stop the
shoots of tomatoes occasionally, and let the plants be supported off the ground, or
the fruit will be damaged. A few peas may be sown in low moist situations, also
kidney beans. Sow largely of Brussels sprouts, savoys, brocoli, cabbages, and
cauliflowers, the two last towards the end of the month. Lettuces may be sown
as the weather suits, and the same may be said of spinach, radishes, and small
salads. Sow largely of celery, and plant out former sowings. Towards the close
of the month the cutting of asparagus should cease ; let the beds be weeded, and
receive a dressing of salt. If weather suits, potatoes may be planted, carrots and
red beet sown. Sugar maize may still be sown. This crop will come in when
much ■wanted. Rhubarb will require a good supply of liquid manure. Clear
-away old crops as they become exhausted. Attend to neatness and cleanliness.
Fruit Garden. —For mulching strawberries, nothing is better than tan, short
grass, or straw; this should have been done last month, or even earlier. In the
absence of these hay bands may be used to keep the berries from coming into
contact with the ground. Remove all runners except those required for furnishing
plants for new plantations. Disbudding may still be practised on fruit trees; the
thinning of fruit should be finished early in the month. Vines will need a great
deal of work in thinning, tying, and stopping the shoots, weeding, &c. In trelised
vines the upper or stronger shoots should be stopped first, and subsequently the
others.
Flower Garden. —Early bulbs, whose tops have become yellow, may be taken
up and stored, or else their position in the ground should be marked by a tally, so
as to prevent disturbing them in digging the beds. Plant out the rest of the
dahlias, as well as the gladioli, tigridias, and other bulbs that have been kept for
late autumn blooming. Vacant spaces may be filled by sowing or transplanting
annuals. Roses may now be budded when it is desired to have more plants of
certain sorts. Hybrid perpetuals that have done blooming for the present may be
cut back a little, but unless bloom be urgently required it will be better not to
force them into growth by watering at this season. Azaleas and camelias that
have set their flower-buds may be plunged in a cool sheltered border, where they
must not however be neglected as regards water. Plant out chrysanthemums, and
thin out the shoots of established plants. Mow lawns, and keep verges, walks,
and gutters clean.
DECEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —lf the sowing of the cabbage tribe directed last month has
not been done, it should at once be attended to. As the weather suits, sow peas
and spinach. A few French beans and marrows may be sown for the late autumn
crop. Let the ground between root crops be kept well stirred and free from weeds.
Swedish turnips may be sown, or the Aberdeen yellow. Cucumbers and melons
may still be planted out of pots at the beginning of the month, and the tribe
generally will require stopping, thinning, and watering with liquid manure. Celery
may be planted out, and more may be sown. Early planted crops may be earthed
up as they require it, a little at a time. Keep weeds down, and on no account
allow the seed to ripen, as one year’s seed gives seven years weeding.
Fruit Garden. —Vines will now demand the chief share of attention; the
thinning both of shoots and bunches may be fully proceeded with. Top them and


Bccoffe them tft stakes or -trellises. Peaches, plums, apricots, and fruit trees
generally may be budded at any time during this month or the next. Strawberries
will require a thorough soaking twice a week during dry weather, and this will
sustain them in bearing, if of the right sort. The British Queen is an excellent
late bearer. Look carefully over orange trees for the caterpillar of the emperor
butterfly. _ .
Flower Garden. —If anything in the way of bulbs, dahlias, &c., remain
implanted, let them have precedence of everything else. Continue to lift bulbs as
they ripen, or else mark them as previously directed. Roses may be budded
whenever the stocks may be in proper order, which may be known by the bark
separating easily from the wood. Carnations, picotees, &c., should be propagated
by layers and pipings. Let dahlias, hollyhocks, chrysanthemums, phloxes, and
all tall growing plants be neatly staked as they throw up their flower stalks. Pot
plants will require much attention in syringing, watering, shading, &c., and all
pots out of doors should be plunged in sand, tan, or in the soil; in either case they
should be turned round once a week to prevent their rooting through the bottom
of the pot.’"'Mow, hoe, rake, and let cleanliness be the order of the day.
MISCELLANEOUS REM AUKS.
The Ground and its Treatment.—On this, of course, rests the success or failure
of the gardener ; and as we rarely have a choice of ground, but have to make the
best of what we have or can get, the first thing to be done is to drain it properly*
without which all manure and labour will be wasted.
First note the lowest point on the ground, and be careful that the"eye is not
deceived Then cut drains leading in that direction into an open ditch dug along
the lowest end of the ground. The depth, distance apart, and size of the drains,
will depend altogether upon the extent and slope of the land, but as a rule, you
cannot overdrain naturally damp, clay land, and at all times the depth of drain
should be well below that to which it is probable you may go in the process of
trenching. Where the land is flat or has but little inclination, the drains should
be cut about twenty feet apart. They may either be filled in with sticks or broken
bricks, rubbish, or which is better, they may be built-in by laying flat stones or bricks
on top of miniature walls running down the sides of the drain. Better than all such
contrivances, however, are pipe-drains, formed of common It-ineh pipes laid on a
hard bed, and covered with a layer of rough stones, over which the ordinary soil
may be placed to the general level.
Having thus secured your soil against stagnant water, the next process is that
of trenching, which consists in the efficient breaking up of the soil to a proper
depth, in o.der that the roots of plants and trees may strike deeply, without the
natural obstruction offered by the substratum of hard clay or rock. It is customary
in trenching to place the first spit in the bottom, and bring the lower subsoil to the
surface, but it will usually be found better to keep the surface soil on the top, and
to merely remove it for the purpose of breaking up the subsoil. Proceed as
follows:—On commencing, dig a trench, a full spade deep and Wo feet wide, across
the piece of land you propose to work, and wheel the soil so removed to the other
end of the patch; then turn the whole of the subsoil in the trench over, to the
depth of 12 inches. In this operation you may find a pickaxe necessary, but see
that it is thoroughly done. Now take the first spit next the trench and turn it
over, as in the ordinary digging, taking care to preserve the general level. On
returning to the point at which you commenced, you will find it again necessary
to break-up the subsoil as in the first trench. Repeat this until your ground is all
finished A.s trenching has to serve for all time it is important that it be well clone*
and as it cannot be done after permanently planting the ground, it is, of course,
more economical that it be the very first step on forming a garden or vineyard.
For all subsequent purposes simple digging will be all that is necessary -This
is very simple, yet may be badly done ; be careful, then, to observe that in digging
you do not work your ground into hills and valleys. Preserve your ground of even
surface ; carefully cover all weeds or manure ; dig deeply and pulverise the clods.
On commencing to dig a patch of ground, remove the soil from the first trench to
that part you propose to finish on as in trenching.


Your ground may be fertile and require little or no manure, or it may be poor or
sterile and need enriching. The following fertilisers are easily obtainable.
Not a leaf or stem but should be taken to the heap or pit ind there be-
allowed to decay. Sheep, horse, cow, and fowl droppings are especially valuable ;
night soil, soot, bones, guano, and chemical manures, such as nitrate of soda, sul-
phate of ammonia, &c., road scrapings, the parings of hedge banks, and bog-earth.
Much will depend upon the shape and inclination of tne ground, but, witn a view
to the future economy of management, avoid all intricate shapes of beds The
main paths should be sufficiently wide to admit of the passage of a dray or
hand-cart, and they should be well gravelled. Border edgings may be formed of
chamomile, privet, rosemary, box, or of any dwarf plant the' fancy may suggest.
Of whatever nature, they should be kept well-trimmed and clipped. The portion
reserved for kitchen vegetables should be easily approachable, without walking
over borders devoted to flowering plants; and fruit trees should be planted
sufficiently far from the paths as not to overhang them when grown to a large size.
The various tools used in a garden are the spade, hoe, rake, fork, line,
pickaxe wheelbarrow, sheers, and stout clasp-knife. The five first will be
essential, and should be selected of the best steel. The American tools are the
lightest and best in the Australian market.
Hoeing.—The hoe is used for clearing the surface of weeds; to form drills for
sowing seeds in ; to lighten the soil, when baked by heat or caked with heavy rain;
to thin such crops as turnips, carrots, and parsnips; and to draw the earth to ad-
vancing peas, beans, potatoes, &c. It is generally used among growing crops, and is
very effiacacious in keeping the surface loose, and thus preventing evaporation.
Raking.—The rake is intended for smoothing the surface of soil on its
reception of seed; to remove weeds after hoeing ; and generally to give a uniform
and neat appearance to the surface. They may be had of various widths, from
2 feet to 6 inches ; the former are used for seed-beds, and the latter for flower-
borders, and for raking among growing plants.
Forking.—The fork is used in preference to the spade in heavy, clayey land,
for loosening the soil about the roots of trees, and for taking such crops as
potatoes. It is used with greater advantage to the soil than that conferred by the
spade, as the clods and lumps are better broken or pulverised. The spade should
never be used in taking up tubers, such as dahlias, and the many flowering bulbs.
Sowing or Cropping.—Seeds may be sown broadcast or in drills. Tne latter
is by far the most economical, though requiring a little more time and patience.
When sown broadcast, many of the seeds are left on the surface, to be picked up
by birds, or if germinating, to be scorched by sun ; but when sown in drills, the
seed is covered; and when grown, may be weeded and thinned with ease and
safety. Amateurs invariably err in sowing too thickly. Such crops as peas and
beans especially should be sown thinly, as the seed is tolerably certain to
germinate; and where onions, turnips, carrots, parsnips, &c., are coming up
thickly, weed them out to a distance of from four to six inches apart, or you will have
no crop worth the gathering. Young beginners frequently show an indisposition
to either thin their crops or prune their trees sufficiently, and this is frequently
the cause of so many failures. Plants must have room to grow, and without, they
become weak and wiry—room not merely for their branches, but for their roots.
The time of sowing will vary with the season. A good guide will be found in
our monthly calendar of operations. But where practicable select mild, fine
weather, when the ground is in fine, light condition for receiving the seed. For
summer crops, select dull weather, when rain is expected. As a general rule, the
plants used as garden vegetables are annuals, or occupy the ground but a few
months, as peas, beans, the brasslca or cabbage-tribe, onions, parsnips, beet,
spinach, &c. There are others, however, of a more permanent character, such as
asparagus, rhubarb, and seakale; and it is necessary to plant such on beds
well enriched and prepared for them, and in some position not likely to be required
for other purposes. In forming seed-beds, of whatever kind, be careful that they
are not made too wide. If about four feet, they may be weeded with facility; if
wider, it is very fatiguing to have to lean over either for the purpose of thinning
or weeding, and it becomes necessary to tread on the beds, to the manifest
injury of the young plants and to the general appearance of the ground.
Transplanting.—For this select fine weather in winter, and dull weather in
summer. Fruit trees should be selected from a nursery, and planted well apart on


ground fully prepared for their reception. Their roots should he laid evenly
and naturally out in the hole, which should be just sufficiently deep to allow the
tree’s roots to be covered to the depth of 3 inches at the base of the stem.
Much injury is done to trees by deep planting, and particularly on wet, undrained
soils \Ve cannot recommend the planting of fruit trees on such land, but
when done, no hole will be necessary; the surface soil should be well dug, and the
tree planted thereon, covering the roots to the depth of 6 inches, driving a stake
down, whereby to secure the tree against high winds Early planting (June or
July) is to be recommended for all fruit trees, for, usually, new rootlets are formed
in abundance during. July and August; and when the tree can have the support of
such root growth, it will the better be able to withstand a season of drought.
All failures in young orchards arise from late planting, or want of drainage; though
there may be some excuse for the latter on account of the expense, for the former
there can be none. There is no pursuit wherein so much depends upon the
right thing being done at the right time as in gardening; and, as in all other
pursuits, the man of close observation and systematic habits—who is not too
conceited to learn from sources, however humiliating—is the man who will best
succeed. In the tansplanting of vegetables, such as cauliflowers, cabbages, &e., it
is important that they be taken up carefully from the seed-bed, or purchased fresh
from the gardener ; and that dull weather be selected. Evergreen shrubs should be
transplanted when they carry but little young growth, for if taken up when
making rapid growth, the young shoots droop and seldom recover, completely
destroying the beauty of the shrub. Deciduous trees, or those which shed their
leaves during the winter, should be planted only at such times. The smaller
flowering plants should be carefully pricked out from the seed patches into the
desired positions, without disturbing the soil from their tiny roots.
Hedges—We should have spoken earlier of the necessity of surrounding a
garden with a good live-hedge. Many plants have been recommended for this
purpose; we have the thorn, brier, pittosporum, privet, Cape-broom, acacia, and
Osage orange. Of the last we desire especially to speak. It is a plant largely used
in America, and is found to answer admirably here. It rapidly forms a hedge
which will keep out cattle and horses, is highly ornamental, and has the quality of
quick growth. The seeds and plants may be obtained of Messrs. Law,
Somner and Co., of Melbourne, Sydney, and Dunedin. When the hedge is
planted, the efficiency of the fence depends upon after management; and
at no stage is more care required than during the first year, for neglect or
mismanagement at the commencement will be manifest in all after years ; we,
therefore, advise strict attention to the following directions, premising that the
Osage orange will bear cutting at all seasons of the year At the commencement
of the second year, or one year from the period of transplanting, cut the shoots back
to within 3 inches of the ground. These shoots having grown from the first
cutting made at the time of transplanting, will now number three or four. A
second cutting, 2 inches above the last, or 5 inches from the ground, may be made
in December. During these processes it is of importance that weeds be kept
down. The third year the pruning should leave the shoots 4 inches long, making
the hedge now 9 inches high. A sharp splasher or switching hook is preferable to
hedge shears for the purpose of pruning, although either may answer the purpose.
At the commencement of the fourth year (April and May) the next pruning should
leave the cutting from last season’s shoots 7 inches long, or 21 inches from the
ground; and another pruning in December will leave the fence 9 inches higher, or
30 inches high. In April following a most formidable, perfect, and ornamental
fence will be the result It is needless, perhaps, to add that the plants during the
first years must be protected from stock, or they would be injured by being
trampled upon. To wait four years for a good fence may to some appear objection-
able, yet no fence can be properly made in less time The mere height may be
gained in one season, but the effect of leaving the hedge unpruned or just topped
would be to render it naked at bottom and useless as a fence against the smaller
animals; whereas it is stated by Americans that, when due care has been taken to
thicken it below, it becomes so close as to be impervious even to a rat; but the
accuracy of this statement we take leave to discredit, though it is possible, we
think, that a rabbit might apply in vain for admission, and it would be something
T farmer to feel that his fences were both sheep and pig proof.

Registered on the 7(li November, 1866, in pursuance of Act 16 Viet., No. 24, see. 2.
The principle of this invention is the application of earth
instead of water to closets and commodes in such a
manner that the soil is immediately and completely
deodorised.
The result produced is a scentless manure, easily
removed, and of the greatest value to agriculture.
It is more particularly useful in hot climates for the
prevention of noxious gases, also of choleraic and other
diseases, and the increase of mosquitoes and other trouble-
some insects which breed in such quantities in the common
cesspit.

DE. EEEDEEICK BEER
BEGS to announce that he has resumed practice in Sydney, and, in doing so,
thinks it incumbent on him at present only to call public attention to an
extract from the report of a Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly, and
the opinions of Sir Benjamin Brodie, on his case. Dr. Beer thinks these extracts,
in addition to being completely vindicatory of his character and conduct, will
demonstrate his superiority in medical knowledge over all those who were
esteemed the elite of the medical profession in Sydney at the time Dr. Beer was
victimised. The extract from the report is as follows:
“It is established incontrovertibly that many persons, whose evidence most
probably would have seriously affected the decision of the trial, were either in
Court or waiting to be examined, whom Dr, Beer was not permitted to produce ;
and that evidence has since been procured which would further tend to exculpate
him from the crime for which he was convicted, viz., that of Sir Benjamin Brodie,
and the evidence of some of the other witnesses examined by your committee.”
* * * * “Your committee have no hesitation in reporting, from the
evidence laid before them, that the use of belladonna, in the mode prescribed,
could not have procured abortion, and on that ground they absolve Dr. Beer
altogether from the charge on which he was found guilty.”
Sir Benjamin Brodie writes:—“l cannot have the smallest hesitation in
saying that both the charge and the verdict are utterly absurd. I can under-
stand that Dr. Beer might have prescribed the use of belladonna with a view to
prevent premature labour, but I cannot suppose that either he or anyone else
would dream of prescribing it for the purpose of procuring abortion. ”
Dr. BEER will shortly deal, in a proper way, with the precise conduct of Drg.
Macfarlane, Roberts, M‘Kay, Bland, Nathan, Bennett, Catlett, Elliott, and others.
Dr. BEES can be consulted on all the ailments that human nature is subjected to at

“We, the undersigned inhabitants of the town and district of Braidwood, embrace the oppor-

charity that you have performed during your sojourn in Braidwood, and of expressing our satisfaction
in bearing witness to your uniform courtesy of demeanour, your unremitting attention and skilful

and friend of a large majority of the population could impose upon you.
“ With the most ardent aspirations for your future welfare, we beg you to accept the accompany-

The Chairman handed to Dr. Beer the Testimonial, and expressed, in doing so, his hearty wishes
for his future welfare. The Testimonial comprised a patent gold keyless Chronometer Watch by
Dent, of London, with chain, and a Diamond Ring.
Address to Dr. Beer, from the Committee of the Braidwood Hospital.
“To Dr. Frederick Beer, Braidwood.—Dear Sir, —Hearing that you are about to leave Braidwood,
we the undersigned members of the Committee of the above Hospital, beg to convey to you our
regret at the loss which the district generally will experience at your departure, and also to testify to
the medical skill, unremitting attention, and kindness with which you attended the patients of the
Hospital during the time you acted as medical officer—a period of more than four years; and we
trust that, wherever you may go, you may well enjoy that success which your skill and generosity so
richly deserve ; and we beg to remain, dear Sir, your obliged and faithful servants—B. O'Brien,

THE FIRST AND HIGHEST PRIZE MEDAL,
IN COMPETITION WITH 87 OTHERS,
Was awarded, at the PARIS EXHIBITION of 1867,
to the
WANZER SEWING MACHINES.
Prize Medal at the “ Centenary Agricultural Show, Manchester," August, 1867.
THE most important qualities to be desired in a machine are, simplicity of construction,
rapidity and ease of motion, greatest variety or range of work, and durability of stitch ;
these qualities arecombined in the “ Wanzer Lock-Stitch Sewing Machine.” f
Of the various stitches made by Sewing Machines, that best adapted to the ordinary purposei
of sewing is known as the “ Lock-Stitch.” It is the only stitch that cannot be raveled, and
that presents the same appearance upon each side of the spam. It is made with two threads,
one upon, each side of the fabric, and interlocked in the centre.- From two-and-a-half to three
yards of thread are required for each yard of seam. This is the only stitch that has commended
itself fully to public favour, forming, as it does, a beautiful, firm, and lasting seam.
The double thread “loop" or chain stitch, partiallyin use at the present day, is objectionable,
from its liability to ravel, and from their being a heavy ridge of thread upon one side of the
seam. This accumulation of thread causes the seam to pucker when the work is wetted—tha
ridge exposed to tha action of the smoothing iron, or any other friction, is broken and the
seam destroyed. >-JEaoh yard of seam requires on an average six-and-a-half yards of thread,
being nearly thrice the quantity required for the lock-stitch.
Ihe lock-stitch when first invented was formed by the use of the shuttle; and although
many attempts have been made for the sake of novelty, to produce it by some other means,
they have rarely succeeded, and then only by the introduction of intricate and delicate
that became easily disarranged, and much reduced the value of the machines for
.amily use.
The “lockstitch” formed by a “ Rotating Hook ” is open to many serious objections, the
principal one being the entire want of command of the tension of the lower thread, and there-
fore the extreme difficulty of passing over seams, or of proceeding, where any increase in
thickness of material occurs, without stopping the work and re-arranging the upper tenison :
again, the small loop-check brush being so rapidly worn, and requiring to be so frequently
adjusted or renewed, renders it necessary to obtain a thorough mechanical knowledge of the
machine, which calls for more time and patience than ladies can. well afford.
The invenors of tha “Wanzer Machine” were enabled, by a close examination of the
principles of the Sewing Machines heretofore introduced, to avoid those points that had been
found objectional, and to combine the two necessary and principal qualities —simplicity and
extensive range of work. They adopted the shuttle as the first and best means of forming the
proper stitch, and by the introduction of new principles of motion they were able to discard
the complexity and heaviness of others.
The “ Warmer Machine” has all the improvements introduced into other Machines, such as
the crystal cloth presser, binder, braider, corder, marker, friller, &o. The crystal presser is
included in the price of the Machine, but the other's are charged for extra, as the Machines are
put at the lowest price, exclusive of these, in order not to compel such purchasers who may
nave no use for one or the other of them, to unnecessarily increase the cost. The Company
guarantee, for one year, every Machine purchased from them ; they are also desirous to render
any aid or information, other than given in the Instruction Book, for the proper and easy
working of the Machine.
These. Machines being capable of so large a variety of work, beginning at the finest gauze or
muslin, and progressing, step by step, to the heaviest moleskin and leather, arc all made of one
size, so that for families or manufacturers, tailors or dressmakers, they will be found equal to
any work required of them. This is important—as, in all other Machines before the public,
it will bo found there is one-priced Machine for one purpose, another for another pur-pose, so
that a purchaser is confused by the variety and uncertainty as to which will suit the work for
which it is required.
The Company have patented a new “ Hemmer and Feller,” which accomplishes with ease
and precision the difficult task of hemming and felling tlannels, cloths, and other thick material;
it is the exclusive property of the Company, and cannot be used by any other machine; the
price is 10s.
As instruction in the use of the Machine is so necessary, the Company have paid special care
and attention to the subject; every Machine is sent from the office threaded, with work under
the needle ready for operation, and with such explicit printed instructions as to enable persons
wiro may never have seen a Machine to teach themselves.
Should the Machine at any time require important changes or repairs, it may be detached
from the table and sent from any part of the country to the office, and be returned by the
same course. The Company warrant every Machine to be perfect at time of sale, and in
addition to giving all instructions that may be required for their management, keep them in
order for twelve months free of charge. Should any part by accident be broken, another can
be obtained and easily fitted at a small expense, as all the parts are mails similar and fit each
of the machines. To insure ease of motions and durability, it is absolutely necessary that the
best of oil should be used; any vegetable oil is objectionable. The Company have had prepared
a quality best suited for the pui'iMise; it is put up in bottles and sold at Is. each.
Cottons, silks, and needles are kept in stock, and can be supplied by the Agents.
