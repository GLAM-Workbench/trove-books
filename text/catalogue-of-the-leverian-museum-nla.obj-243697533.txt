120 A capital, and for beauty and magnitude unique, specimen of
the true Avanturine, weighing near slb. This curious
article was found in the ruins of the triumphal arch of
Julius Cassar, in the valley of Suse in Piedmont, in 1788,
by the Sieur Francis Ludwig, of Mayence. It takes a
very high polish, and is much harder and infinitely more
beautiful than the stone commonly known by the same
name.* *
* The artificial Avanturine has been known for ages, speci-
mens of it being frequently found among the antient ruins
of Rome. Some eminent mineralogists have questioned the
existence of suck a beautiful stone as the natural Avantu-
rine; but the following respectable authorities put the
matter beyond a doubt. They are translated from the
originals and addressed to Mans. Ludwig of Mayence,
from whom the specimen ivas purchased for two hundred
guineas.
SIR, — <c The Quartz Avanturine that you have been so
<e obliging as to let me see, merits, by its beauty, the utmost
(C attention of the amateurs. I have never seen one yet which
“ more resembles the artificial glass, known by the name of
“ Avanturine, I am. Sir,
Your very obedient Servant,
Vienna, 12th May, 1 790* J* Borne.’
“ I perfectly coincide with the sentiments of my
ce friend Mr. le Chevalier Borne, that it is a laminated ferrugi-
“ nous quartz, of the carnelion colour, abundantly impregnated
f with copper-coloured mica, which, by the intimate mixture






“ and the different position'of the particles, appears to have pro-
ff duced the natural Avanturine,
Frey I erg, 4th June, 1790. De Charfentier.”
“ I have seen with the greatest pleasure the large
“ specimen of red-coloured quartz, mixed with mica,
“ to Mr. Ludwig, which throws great light on the true origin of
“ the Avanturine. It is an unique piece, both on account of
“ its size and beauty. j(
Cologne on the Rhine, Bth Aug. 1/90. Baron de Hupsch.
“ The under-signed attests never to have seen a
<f quartz mixed with mica, of such size and beauty. It is usually
“ called Avanturine. Dr. Charles Henri T-Itius,
Inspector of his S. H. the Elector of Saxony s
Dresden, Qth July, 1790. Cabinet of Natural History .”
“ As a zealous amateur of lithology* and possessor
“ of a sufficiently compleat collection, I think it incumbent
“ upon me to declare that I never have seen an Avanturine of a
ei beauty so perfect, and size so uncommon, as that belonging to
Mr. Ludwig, of Mayence. Joseph Frederick,
Dresden, 12 th July, 1 790. Baron of Racknitz.
*• The under-signed acknowledges never to have
“ seen so large and clear a quartz mixed with glimmer, which
<< so compleatly represents the composition known by the name
of Avanturine. Vosmaer,
Hague, 13 Sept. 1790. Director of the Cabinet of Nat. Hist.
of the Prince Sladtholder .
“ In addition to the foregoing testimonies of the
great judges in natural history, I must confess never to have
“ seen a production in the mineral kingdom which has so much
“ excited my admiration, as this wonderful specimen, which I
“ had the pleasure of seeing through ray acquaintance with its
<c proprietor, and which will be of great use, as adding to the
“ discoveries in natural history. Francis William,
Cologne , Aug. 5, 1790. Count of Otting, Baldern, &Portern.

100 Superb Ivory Cup, presumed to be one of the most exquisite

Testimonial relative to the cup, given by Professor
Thorkelin. “ The ivory cup in the Museum, late Sir
Ashton Lever’s is an undoubted work of Magnus Berg, a
Danish artist, who having been engaged in France, during
the reign of Louis XIV. as Medailleur, returned home to
Denmark, where he painted on the walls of Friedricks-
berg, the history of Christian V. and carved in ivory
several cups, part of which still remain in the Royal Mu-
- scum at Copenhagen ; and others were made presents of
to foreign princes, by his royal master. Ihe life of this
truly extraordinary genius, is inserted in the Danish ma-
gazine of historic knowledge, 1/47 •
Magnus Berg died in the reign of Friedrick IV. who
was succeeded by Christum VI. in the year ll'iO.
G. T. Thohkelin.”
107 Aqua marine, a very fine and perfect crystal
103 Opal in its matrix, a remarkably brilliant specimen
lOQ A magnificent Laver, of the curious old Raphaels wore,
the form an elegant oval, with a recurved edge, and






pointed bottom, which, as well as a raised zone or belt,
which encircles the middle of the outside, is wrought in
fluted or 'gadrooned work. Each side is ornamented with
a laughing cornuted satyr’s head. Two grotesque sphinx-
like figures, half satyr, half dragon, with each a double
tail, serve as supporters ; their arms are extended to the
edge, and their hind parts, with wings expanded, under-
neath, resting on an oval base, which has a hollow
gadrooned edge. The whole is painted in the most
lively colours, and glazed. On the inside, within a
broad grotesque border, is represented a Roman naval
engagement; the boarding of two ships by a numhei of
soldiers in boats, sword and shield in hand ; sailors fixing
their grappling hooks to facilitate the entrance of the
assailants, who are opposed by soldiers on board the ships
armed in like manner. The outside is enriched with
grotesque figures, supporting festoons of flowers, inter-
spersed, among which are birds, military achievements,
foliage, &c. This capital and masterly performance be-
speaks It the work of first rate genius, and renders it the
deserved object of general admiration. It was originally
in the Medicean Collection, and, at the time of the Duke
of Tuscany's taking possession of that valuable repository,
was, by mistake, put out, with other ai tides, foi sale, and
purchased by the late Admiral Broderick, 101 a consi-
derable sum, on whose demise it came into the possession
of the late Sir Ashton Lever. .

1144 Leverian Museum. —Catalogue of the Levenan Museum (complete).
The Sale of the Entire Collection (by Messrs. King and Lochee) will commence on Monday,
the sth of May, 1806, at Twelve o’ Clock, in the Building now occupied by the Museum,
Bvo., 296, 17 pp., interleaved throughout, University Library, Cambridge, duplicate, with
stamp, half crimson morocco, gilt top, exceedingly rake, £8 10s 1806
Throughout the catalogue are several hundred! curiosities from the Sandwich Islands and South
Seas brought home by Capt. Cook and his officers.
The museum was formed by Sir Ashton Lever, an undertaking which nearly brought him to ruin.
After unsuccessfully offering the collection to the nation, Lever obtained, in 1788, an act to
hold a lottery, but only a quarter of the sixty thousand tickets were sold. He took the risk
and held the lottery with the hope of drawing the lucky ticket out of those unsold, i he prize
fell to a ticket which was held by a Mr. Parkinson, who moved the collection to a building,
afterwards famous as the Kotunda, in Albion Street at the Surrey end of Blackfnars Bridge.
In later years it fell into neglect and was sold by Parkinson. This is the catalogue of the sale
which lasted sixty days, it was compiled bv Edward Donovan.
