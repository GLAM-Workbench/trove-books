Wunderlich Art Metal Ceilings
TrriEAUTY in every room —beauty that
Y endures as long as the home lasts—
that is what a Wunderlich Art Metal
Ceiling treatment means in the home.
It makes rooms more artistic, more inviting,
more steadfast against the depreciation and
impoverishment that tend to impair the
attractiveness of the home as time goes on.
As an inspection of this catalogue will reveal,
Wunderlich Art Metal Ceilings are manu-
factured in an extensive range of designs,
making possible a suitable treatment for
every occasion. There are rich, dignified
panellings and panels for important rooms ;
lightly ornate patterns for bedrooms ; and
plain, simple diaper designs for kitchen and
bathroom. All are chastely modelled, and
embossed crisply in Wunderlich paint-pro-
tected steel sheets, of special quality. Cor-
nices and mouldings, in a pleasing and
generous variety, are available, so that
ceiling treatments complete in detail, with
each unit in harmony, can be assembled from
Wunderlich designs.
An outstanding reason for the popularity of
Wunderlich Ceilings is the fact that they are
as readily available to the homebuilder in
the remote out-back, as to the suburban
dweller. Being light in weight, the material
travels at low cost; and there is no risk
of breakage. Then, again, it is easily
erected. A series of beads, stamped along
the sides and edges of the sheets, enables
each sheet to be fitted accurately and
mechanically into position. The joints fit
tightly, one beaded edge being lapped over
another, so there is no necessity for such
devices as cover battens.
In initial cost, Wunderlich Art Metal
Ceilings compare favourably with other
materials ; while, measured by ultimate cost,
they are unquestionably the most economical
medium available for the purpose. Once
erected, and painted with genuine oil paint,
Wunderlich Ceilings seldom need attention
for ten to twenty years. They remain flaw-
less and attractive, never flaking, cracking or
sagging. Unlike brittle materials which are
liable to fall and endanger the lives of the
home-folk, they are positively safe. Should
fire menace the rooms, Wunderlich Ceilings
will prove an effective barrier against the
spread of flames. As the joints, being tight-
fitting, cannot open up like timber, they offer
no encouragement to vermin.
For old rooms as well as new, Wunderlich
Art Metal Ceilings are the popular choice
of architects, builders and home-investors.
They can be nailed direct to old lining-
boards, or fixed over cracked or damaged
plaster, without any disturbance of the
existing materials. Work of this nature may
be carried out in a clean and tidy manner,
with entire absence of the damage and litter
usually experienced with repair jobs.
Think, therefore, of the advantages these
Ceilings offer you. At really low ultimate
cost, they provide a treatment that enhances
the beauty of rooms, and adds decidedly to
the value of the home. Alike in city and
country, these Ceilings have proven the most
practical, most adaptable and most per-
manent medium for their purpose, fulfilling
their function long after substitute materials
would have fallen into disrepair or decay.
Forty years of constant development and
improvement have evolved a product that
is to-day more artistic, more durable and
more economical than ever before. Its
adaptability to modern construction is
evidenced by the fact that Wunderlich
Ceilings have just been installed in the
Banking Chamber and eight floors of the
most imposing commercial building in the
Commonwealth —the Head Office of the
Government Savings Bank of New South
Wales, Martin Place, Sydney. Virtually
every architect of prominence in Australia —
some of whom were amongst our earliest
clients —freely specifies our material. It is
therefore with complete confidence in our
ability to meet all requirements, and to give
lasting satisfaction, that we commend
Wunderlich Metal Ceilings to your favour-
able consideration.


Modern Ceilings in Modern Homes
The wide variety of Wunderlich patterns renders possible an individual treatment for each
room. There are light floral designs for the bedrooms; dignified effects for the living room
and plain, simple patterns for kitchen or bathroom.


In choosing Wunderlich
Art Metal, you not only
obtain Ceilings of un-
usual artistic merit, but
you also provide a treat-
ment that is permanent.
Cracks, stains, and the
usual ceiling troubles that
mar the beauty of rooms
involving. as well,
periodical repairs are
avoided when Wunder-
lich Art Metal Ceilings
are installed.
For old rooms, as well
as new, Wunderlich
Ceilings are recom-
mended, as they can
be applied over old
lining boards or cracked
plaster, with virtually
no disturbance of the
existing materials. This
work can be carried out
with a minimum of
trouble, and without the
usual dirt and litter.
In the past 40 years, Wunderlich Ceilings have been installed in more than a million rooms
in Australasia. For country homes particularly, these Ceilings are highly appropriate, as they
travel without risk of breakage and can be erected by local tradesmen.

Ho w to Order
cyri UNDERLICH Art Metal Ceilings may be
ordered in either of two ways, viz.: (a) in
Stock Sizes, or (b) To Design. The former
method is availed of by those who possess
sufficient confidence or experience to estimate
accurately the quantities of various units, such as
Diapers, Panellings, Cornices, Mouldings, Borders,
Mitre Leaves, etc., which the Ceilings or Wall Linings
involve. On the other hand, clients desiring to save
themselves this trouble prefer to order "To Design,’’
which means that they simply send us sizes and, if
possible, plans of the rooms to be treated, at the
same time specifying the designs preferred, following
which we prepare a drawing showing the arrangement
of the patterns in the various rooms. When this
drawing is returned to us, approved, we ourselves
estimate the quantities of material required for each
room. Before such quantities reach their destination
the client receives a working drawing, on which are
indicated the correct arrangement of the patterns.
battens, etc., and full size sections of the cornices and
mouldings.
ORDERING IN “STOCK SlZES."— Clients
ordering in this manner should forward a list showing
the quantity, catalogue number, and size of each
pattern required. Such list should include the neces-
sary number of mitre leaves for cornices, bosses for
mouldings, and, if needed, ceiling nails and wood
brackets.
ORDERING " TO DESIGN." —As previously men-
tioned, this method of ordering involves the
forwarding to us of a plan, or, at least, full particulars
as to the sizes of rooms. If our client so desires, we
await the approval of our drawing and acceptance
of our quotation before despatching the materials. On
the other hand, unless we experience difficulty in
adapting the client’s choice of patterns to the sizes of
the rooms, or unless we are asked to await acceptance
of our quotation, we deal promptly with urgent orders,
effecting shipment as soon as possible after their
receipt.
Measurements
To ensqre accuracy in the execution of orders and in
the preparation of estimates, we ask our clients to
provide us with the fullest possible information as to
their requirements.
In every instance we like to have a plan—even if only
a rough one —of the work in view. This plan should
show:—
The dimensions of each wall.
The face measurement and the depth of each pro-
jection, such as a chimney breast.
One diagonal measurement, should the room not be
perfectly rectangular.
The distance between the underside of ceiling joists
and top of window architraves.
Sometimes beams occur, in which case we should be
advised as to the depth (from underside of joists)
and width of the beams, and whether of timber or a
rolled steel section.
Terms and Conditions
DESPATCH. —Deliveries are charged for at current
rates.
CASES. —We invoice cases at cost price, but make
no charge for packing. Empty cases cannot be
accepted, if returned to us, as invariably they are
valueless.
INSURANCE AND FREIGHT. —When goods are
sent by sea route, they will be insured by us, failing
specific instructions regarding insurance; and the pre-
mium will be charged at current rates. We do not
prepay freight unless under buyers' instructions.
RESPONSIBILITY.— When we have delivered
goods on to rail or boat our responsibility ceases. Any
claim for damage occurring in transit should be made
against the railway or shipping authorities concerned.
PAYMENT. —To avoid delay and misunderstand-
ings, new clients are advised to furnish business
references, or else to forward cash, with their first
order. In the case of overseas clients, we prefer to
forward a draft through our Bank, accompanied by
documents.

Wunderlich Complete Ceiling Design


COMPLETE CEILING DESIGN, No. 6061
This Ceiling is composed of Panel No. 1595, measuring 3ft. x 3ft. (four panels being assembled to form the
centre-feature); Corner Panel No. 1593 (2ft. 10in. square); Border Sheeting No. 1594 (6ft, lengths x 2ft. 10in.
wide); Cornice No. 1563 (6ft. lengths, 6in. projection, 4in. deep, 8½in. girth); Border No. 1406 (6ft. long by
any width up to 24in). The complete Ceiling, as illustrated, measures 14ft. square; but exclusive of the cornice
and border filling, the size of the design is 11ft. 8in. square. Allowing for the employment of a cornice of mini-
mum size, the smallest room for which the above design is appropriate, measures 12ft. 6in. along its narrowest side.
SUBSTITUTION OF CORNICE DESIGNS.
It is not absolutely essential that the cornices shown on our illustrations of complete ceilings should be rigidly
adhered to. Numerous cornices of pleasing design are displayed on pages 33 to 35, and if clients, when selecting
their requirements in accordance with our complete ceiling suggestions, desire to substitute another cornice
design, they should specify “complete ceiling No —with cornice No in lieu of the design illustrated."
Wunderlich Complete Ceiling Design


The Use of Steel Diaper Sheetings
T" === HE simplest form of Ceiling available in
Wunderlich Art Metal is one composed of a
Diaper Sheeting, with a cornice to complete
—“ a satisfactory finish where the ceiling and the
walls conjoin.
The above drawing illustrates such a Ceiling in a
room measuring 14 feet by 10 feet. Diaper Sheeting
No. 1074, shown on page 25, and Cornice No.
1076, shown on page 33, are the patterns chosen.
Reference to page 33 discloses that the Cornice, No.
1076, projects 3 inches from the walls, so there
remains an area of 13 feet 6 inches by 9 feet 6 inches
to be covered by Diaper Sheeting No. 1074.
The latter pattern is made in a stock size of 6 feet
by 2 feet, and it will be seen that, along the length
of 13 feet 6 inches, it is possible to arrange two full
sheets each 6 feet long ; while, across the width of
9 feet 6 inches four full sheets each 2 feet wide can
be fixed.
Arranging the sheets in this manner, an area 12 feet
long by 8 feet wide is covered, leaving a balance of
1 foot 6 inches still to be treated in the length and
width of the room.
This balance is treated by cutting off and fixing 9-inch
strips of Diaper Sheeting No. 1074 along each side
and end of the Ceiling.
It will be seen that a Diaper Sheeting is appropriate
for covering the entire ceiling area between cornice
projections. Although, in most cases, this involves
the cutting of the pattern, quite a presentable effect is
created, as the unit of such patterns is small and the
shallow embossing permits of cutting without dis-
figuring the design.
Practically all the Diaper Sheetings illustrated on
pages 23 to 26 may be used in the same way as No.
1074. If the cutting of a pattern is not desirable,
a border and moulding should be used, as explained on
page 27. This, of course, adds somewhat to the cost
of the Ceiling.

Wunderlich Steel Diapers


The Use of Steel Panellings
HNLIKE Diaper Sheetings, Steel Panellings are
seldom so designed as to permit of the pattern
being cut without in some measure detracting
from the appearance of the design. Accord-
ingly, where the Ceiling measurements between cor-
nice projections are not an exact multiple of 24in. (the
usual repeat of the Panelling) it is customary to
employ a moulding and border. The former serves
as a " framing " for the panelled area, while the latter,
used in the necessary widths, covers the margin
between the moulding and the cornice.
In the above drawing we depict an area measuring
14 feet 6 inches by 10 feet 9 inches. The cornice
chosen, No. 1130 (see page 34) has a projection of
6 inches from the wall, thus absorbing 12 inches along
the length and across the width of the Ceiling, leaving
an area 13 feet 6 inches by 9 feet 9 inches still to be
covered.
As Panelling No. 1351 (page 28), which is a pattern
of 24in, repeats, should not be cut, it is impossible to
arrange more than six units or repeats along the length
and four across the width of the Ceiling. This
makes up an area of 12 feet by 8 feet. Moulding No.
201 (page 32) and Border No. 1406 (page 30) are
selected to cover the remaining space, which comprises
a strip 9 inches wide (half of 13 feet 6 inches minus
12 feet) at each end of the room, and a strip 10J inches
wide (half of 9 feet 9 inches minus 8 feet) along
each side.
Moulding No. 201 is If inches wide ; therefore the
respective widths of the Border, No. 1406, will be
7 k inches and 8| inches. In practice, it is usual to
order an inch or so more than the bare widths of
border, as walls are not always perfectly parallel ;
and, in any case, the surplus of border finishes under
the moulding, trimming to correct widths being quite
unnecessary.

Wunderlich Steel Panels


Wunderlich Steel Border Sheetings
Wunderlich Steel Border Sheetings are usually employed as “fillers” in rooms where
the ceiling is composed of Wunderlich Panelling or Panels. As the repeat of
the pattern is small, a border can be cut without detriment to its appearance,
whereas Panellings and Panels are so designed that cutting of the pattern generally
impairs its attractiveness.
EXAMPLE OF USE : A practical example of the use of a border sheeting will be
found on page 27 of this catalogue. It will be noted that as many repeats as
possible of panelling No. 1351 have been arranged along the length and across
the width of the ceiling, and that after allowance is made for the area occupied
by the moulding and cornice, there still remains an untreated margin along each
side and end of the ceiling. This margin calls for the employment of a border sheet-
ing, and No. 1406 is the pattern chosen.
USE OF BORDER No. 1616, AS A “ GROUND ” ; Ceilings composed of a plain
ground, broken up with an arrangement of mouldings, are sometimes preferred to the
more ornate Wunderlich treatments, and in such instances the use of Pattern No.
1616 provides an ideal ground. Unlike other Borders, No. 1616 is available in
a width of 3 feet.
BEADED EDGE ON No. 1406 : We supply Border No. 1406 with a bead along
one edge, which makes possible a neat finish where the border is fixed against
a cornice.

How to Fix Wunderlich Ceilings
SECTIONS OF CEILINGS SHOWING METHODS OF FIXING
Having fixed battens, first fix scotia to the ceiling battens. Wood brackets are used at the joints of the scotia.
On account of the depth of this scotia being less than 2in. no batten is necessary on the wall.
Being in one piece, the cornice border and moulding is easily fixed. As the border is of a standard width, the
ceiling pattern must be cut up to the moulding.
The use of separate border and moulding enables the pattern in the ceiling to work out with a full ornament.
The border can be cut to make up irregularities in the size of the room.
GENERAL REMARKS
Where our Metal Ceiling Materials are used, light
timbers only are required for ceiling joists.
For fixing, the tools required are : Hammer, Bradawl,
Punch, Pair of Snips, and Saw.
Procedure. —In case of New Buildings having plaster
walls, a bevelled ground should be fixed, to which is
secured the batten for the bottom of cornice; and
the walls floated before the Metal Material is fixed.
For old Brick Buildings plugs should be inserted and
battens fixed thereto.
For the body of the ceilings mark on the ends of the
outside joists the distance which the cornice will pro-
ject from the walls. These marks denote the centre of
METAL FIXING
Cornice. —For mitring, allow one length of the Cornice
to butt on to the wall, scribing the opposite length
to it, covering the joint with a mitre leaf, using a
little putty on the edge of the leaf before pressing it
into the angle. Then nail to battens and brackets.
Sheeting.—Our sheets are trimmed true, and always
lap at the joint. When the Cornice is fixed, start

the batten carrying the top of cornice and the ends
of the ceiling sheets. Space out 1 I'm. x lin. Oregon
ceiling battens at 12in. centre to centre, starting from
centre of the room, if it is desired that the ceiling
pattern should be equal at the sides of the room.
With many of our smaller pattern diaper sheetings it
is sufficient to start with a pattern from one side and
end of the room, in which case the battens can be
spaced 12in. centre to centre from the centre of the
cornice batten. Cut in cross battens to take the ends
of metal sheets. Also, on two sides of the room fix
trimmers level with under side of joist, to which nail
the cornice batten.
Fix wood brackets behind angles and cornice joints.
A batten must be fixed under all joints.
fixing the sheets from the centre or side of the room,
according to the spacing of the battens. To ensure
a first-class job, temporarily tack the ceiling sheets in
position, ascertaining if the lines are correct before
completing the nailing. When all the sheets are
nailed home, go over the joints with a small blunt
tool, and tuck edges so that they lie close and even.

Enlarged section through portion of the Ceiling, showing the diaper cut up to the Border Finish.
As the latter is only 1½ inches deep, there is no necessity for a batten on the wall.
How to Decorate Wunderlich Ceilings
Our Steel Ceiling Material is supplied already primed
on both surfaces with a film of oil paint. When fixed,
the Ceilings should be given three coats of OIL
PAINT, although two coats may be found sufficient in
some instances.
Do not use distemper or water paints.
COAT No. I.—This should consist of pure white lead
or zinc white, brought to the required consistency
with a mixture consisting of three parts of raw oil and
one part of turps. A small quantity of goldsize should
be added, for drying purposes.
COAT No. 2.—Similar to Coat No. 1, with the
addition of a mixture of tints, as required. To obtain
a flatted finish, which we recommend, use only a small
quantity of oil (say three parts of turps, and one part
of oil, added to the white lead).
COAT No. 3.—Should a third coat be used, it would
be similar to Coat No. 2.
Where necessary, the best oil putty should be used,
for stopping joints, mitre leaves, bosses, etc.
If the final finish is to be white, it will be found that
the intensity of the white can be maintained longer,
by the addition of a small quantity of ultramarine blue
in the various coats of paint.

How to Fix Dados and Wall Linings
Dado and Wall Lining Materials are attached to
battens fixed to plugs in the wall, or nailed to
wood studs, but it is advisable that the lower three
feet of the Metal Sheeting be attached to wood lining
boards in lieu of battens. If the Ceilings are also
to be of metal, they should be fixed first.
Obtain the height of dado, and strike a perfectly
horizontal line for top of dado panels, allowing for
height of wood skirting.
Now fix the battens for Metal Sheetings in a similar
manner as for Ceilings, bearing in mind that it is
essential to get an equal amount of the pattern on
each side of the room. A batten should be placed
under each joint, and one under the centre of the
sheet.
When all battens are in position, fix dado moulding
and angle strips. (See Nos. 1368, 69, 70.)
Dado Panels and Metal Sheeting should now be fixed.
Place the lower bead of the wall sheet along the flange
on the dado moulding, and cut the pattern up to
the bottom flange of the Cornice. To make a good
joint where the sheets are cut against the Cornice, an
extra flange piece should be used under the Cornice.
This piece (No. 1370) should be fixed at the same
time as the Cornice.

Wunderlich Galvanised Ceilings and Wall Linings
Wunderlich Galvanised Ceilings and Wall Linings are manufactured for situations
which warrant the use of a highly durable and weather-resisting material. Although
slightly more expensive than our standard paint-primed steel, they should be used at
all times for the Ceilings and Linings of bathrooms, and the Ceilings of exposed
verandahs. Moreover, all Wunderlich Ceilings to awnings must be galvanised steel.

Wunderlich Window Hoods
No. 1422
Stock Length, 6ft.
Projection of Bracket, 28in.
Height of Bracket, 31in.
These Window Hoods are
fixed by means of screws
through lugs which we
attach to the rear flange
of the brackets.
It will be noticed that the
flshscale has a plain,
turned-up flange at the
back, which forms a
flashing against the wall.
Extreme rigidity is given
the flshscale sheet, by the
rolled front edge.
No. 1330
Stock Length, 6ft.
Projection of Bracket,
Height of Bracket, 30in.
Window Hoods are always forwarded in parts, and are easily
assembled on the job by means of the bolts and nuts which
we provide, and for which the necessary holes are punched in
brackets and flshscale sheets before despatch.
Unless otherwise ordered, we forward hoods in lengths of 6
feet. If clients require hoods of shorter length, they will find
it quite a simple matter to snip off the surplus flshscale sheeting
and to re-drill holes for bolts ; or, on receipt of particulars, we
will cut to correct size.
Hoods longer than 6 feet may be obtained, to order ; an extra
charge being made for these, based on the additional length
required.
When ordering sizes other than the stock length (viz., 6 ft.) it
is necessary to mention the width of the window opening, if
hoods are to be fixed to a brick building. In the case of
weatherboard buildings, it is best to let us know the measure-
ment over architraves.
Wunderlich Window Hoods are
manufactured from Galvanised
Steel, and are available in three
designs as follows: —
No. 1422 : Consisting of two
brackets and a flshscale pattern
hood ; with the addition of a
frieze (as illustrated) where
desired.
No. 1330; Comprising two
brackets and a flshscale pattern
hood.

No. 1330, and with the same
depth of bracket ; but with a
projection of 23 inches. Note ;
The Bracket only of this Hood,
is shown below.

structed very strongly, of galvanised steel,
and will last a lifetime. Being light in weight,
thoroughly weatherproof, and easy to fix and
glaze, they offer an inexpensive yet effective
means of providing light and, if needed,
ventilation in the roof. They require no paint
or putty, and as ample provision is made for
expansion and contraction, the likelihood of
the glass breaking is reduced to a minimum.

tions where light
is permanently re-
quired, and ventil-
ation in the roof is
sometimes a neces-
sity. The glazed
portion is hinged,

DESIGN RATES
The following Design Rates for complete steel ceiling treatments, illustrated
on pages B to 21, will enable clients to calculate readily the total price for similar
designs in rooms of any size. It will be noticed that we quote a rate per square
yard for the ceiling, exclusive of cornice, and an extra price per lineal foot for
the cornice; so permitting our clients to reckon out the alteration in price if a
cornice other than that illustrated is desired. The rates per square yard of
ceilings, and per lineal foot of cornice, hold good for ceilings of ANY AREA.
These Design Rates cover the Wunderlich Steel Ceiling Material necessary,
including sufficient Jin. x 16 gauge nails for fixing the metal, and ample material
to provide for the waste that is at times involved.
In addition, we supply a working drawing, showing the correct arrangement
of the various patterns in the room to be ceiled.
