LEST WE FORGET!
Our Obligations to the Returned
Sailors and Soldiers.
THE half-hearted response which was noticeable on
France?s Day to the appeal for funds for our gallant friends,
can be taken as a fair indication cf the interest thr general
public takes in matters resulting from the War now that the
conflict is over. Not only was the response to the appeals
poorer than was expected, but from what can be heard, the
few loyal and big hearted women who did their best to create
a spirit of giving, found it very hard to obtain the same
enthusiastic assistance from their fellow-workers which was
so much in evidence before the war terminated.
No one can deny that there are many who deserve a well
earned rest after their arduous labours in the soldiers? interests
during the war years, but now that our men are returning,
it is no less incumbent on us to see that our enthusiasm and
interest in their welfare, and in re-establishing them in civil
life is as keen as it was when we encouraged them to enlist
for ?Active Service.?
Our worthy and distinguished visitor, Sir Harry Lauder,
and others, have told us that to shake him by the hand and
give him a job is a much grander way of showing our appreci-
ation of the soldier than waving flags from the kerbstone on
his return, and forgetting all about him afterwards.
Surely we will allow it to be said that we en-
couraged the boys to go away, and gave them a warm hand-
grasp and a God-speed, but now that they have returned,
having completed their work, the y find the atmosphere cold
and uncongenial. Not only is it up to us to see that he gets
a job, but returned soldiers who have commenced business
on their own should have the goodwill and the assistance of
every member of the community.
It is inconceivable that any employer would not take a
returned man back to the job he left, unless for some specially
good and well-considered reason. This is the very least that
a soldier has the right to expect. We must not lose sight of
the fact that although he may to some extent be a bit rusty
in his work for a start after his exceptional war experiences,
he has returned with a broadness of mind and vision and a
high conception of citizenship which will be a tremendous
asset to Australia.
Much has been done and is being done by the Federal
Government through the Repatriation Department, and


also by the State Government, which has the Soldiers? Prefer-
ence Bill in hand, and which makes it obligatory on employers
to re-establish returned men in their old positions. The
Returned Sailors? and Soldiers? League are also doing what
they can for their members.
These bodies, however, have a definite obligation to the
returned men which is apparent to all. What is not so
apparent is the definite and clear individual obligation of
every man, woman and child to show in a practical manner
that they are prepared to meet their obligations to the returned
men. It is not sufficient to leave this obligation to the
Government.
The great commercial bodies of employers, and individual
employers have, almost without exception, taken the matter
up, with creditable results, but whilst the great majority
are enthusiastic in their desire to help the returned man,
there are a few, it is feared, who are only interested so far as
the carrying out of any such policy does not clash with their
business interests. This, to an extent, can be understood,
as it is obviously impossible and undesirable to place a
returned man in a position for which he is quite unfitted.
A further effort, however, which could well be made, is
the creation of general interest in the returned man, and a
sympathetic atmosphere in which he may be assisted to obtain
employment, and a helping hand after he has been settled,
by those of us who did not go to the war, keeping the fact
uppermost in our minds that the liberty we enjoy has been
bought for us by those who have given their lives and those
who have returned.
It can be safely taken for granted that those closely in-
terested through family and friendly relationship are doing
all they can to assist their men returning from the war.
There are, however, thousands of men who were unable to go
to the war, and to whom the four and a half years of war has
been a veritable nightmare, owing to their inability on account
of family and other reasons to get away tc do their bii ; such
men have the utmost sympathy for the returned soldier and
sailor, and it is to these men, and others with like obligations,
which necessitated their remaining at home, that an appeal
to keep their obligations to the returned men fresh in their
minds, would receive ready response, so that it may be said
? they were not forgotten.?
The necessity for such an appeal should be apparent to
all. We have only to compare the many hundreds of able
and ingenious cartoons which were so much in evidence
during the years of war to induce our young manhood to don
khaki, with the lack of any such suggestion of a similar nature
to make us remember continually our obligations to these
men now that the war is over and they have returned


It should not be necessary for the returned men them-
selves to take the initiative in such a matter, which is so
obviously the duty of others, but we know that had it not
been for the Soldiers? and Sailors? League things would be
much worse than they are to-day for the returned men.
It is considered that there is a pressing need for the
establishment of a central body to correspond and generally
keep in touch with other city, suburban, and country or-
ganizations at present in existence, or which may be formed
with a view to launching a campaign for the purpose indicated,
and on the following lines :
1 Let us make up our minds to find out quietly in our
own intimate circle of friends (private and business)
if there are any returned men whom we can help
along.
2 If there is a vacancy let us see that no suitable returned
man is passed over when endeavouring to fill it.
3 Instil into the minds of our friends the obligations
we owe to the returned men.
4 Ask or tell our friends of any returned men in business
who require a helping hand.
5 Talk about the returned men of our acquaintance
amongst our business friends so that they can help
in finding him a job.
6 Think of the hundreds of returned men who sacrificed
thriving businesses and sold up their homes to go
to the and Who, having come back, are spending
their hard-earned savings in trying to re-establish
themselves again.
7. If we put our business in other hands when he went
to the war, let us be sure he gets it back on his return.
8. If we have any
the returned man.
9. Work as enthusiastically in the returned men?s
interests as you did to assist recruiting.
10. Do all these things and as many more as you can to
assist the returned men, arid help repatriation.
The period we are passing through is a difficult one for
all business men and workers, what must it be for those who
have been out of touch for four and a half years, and are trying
to re-establish themselves again ?
The Minister in charge of Repatriation, Senator Millen,
has stated that the maximum strain on the Department will
be reached about the end of this year, and will continue for
six months, so it will be seen that there is plenty of scope for
an organization of the kind suggested, and that such an
organization will be necessary for upwards of a year.
The whole position can be summed up in a few words :
These men have done their bit, it is now up to us.
