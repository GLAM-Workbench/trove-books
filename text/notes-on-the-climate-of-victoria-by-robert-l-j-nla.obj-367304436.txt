NOTES
THE CLIMATE OF VICTORIA.

GOVERNMENT ASTRONOMER OP VICTORIA.




NOTES
THE CLIMATE OF VICTORIA.
A general idea of the climate of any country may sometimes be
derived simply from its geographical position, especially when its
isothermal, isotheral, and isocheimonal lines have been established.
There are nevertheless conditions peculiar to every locality or
every position of a country, dependent on the conformation of the
coast lines, the relation of oceanic currents therewith, the trend
and altitude of mountain ranges, which give rise to variations,
within whose limits may be comprised climates of very different
latitudes; so that some acquaintance with the physical aspect of
a country becomes almost essential to a clear comprehension of
the character of its climate. It will be well, therefore, to preface
the following brief notes on the climate of Victoria with a rough
sketch of the more prominent physical features which characterise
that portion of Australia.
The colony of Victoria, which has an area of about fifty-six
millions of acres, occupies the south-east portion of Australia, and
may be said to be included between the parallels 30° and 39°
south latitude, and the 141st and 148th meridians. The whole
southern boundary is formed by the waters of Bass’s Straits,
which separate Tasmania from Australia; the northern boundary
consists of the River Murray; on the west it is limited by a
marked line approximately coinciding with the 141st meridian;
while on the east it is separated from the adjacent colony of New
South Wales by a line running N. 64° W. from Cape Howe to the,
nearest waters of the Murray. Its sea-board, lying generally east
and west, extends over about 500 miles.


By an examination of a contoured plan of the colony, we find
that the most prominent feature is an extensive mountain range
running approximately east and west, rising somewhat abruptly
about lat. 87° 30' and long. 141° 40', varying in altitude from
1000 to 5000 feet, and culminating in the N.E. in lat. 36° 30',
long. 148° 20', at Mount Kosciusko, the highest part of the Aus-
tralian Alps, where it attains an altitude of over 7000 feet. The
higher parts of this range are covered with snow for several
months in the year. The mountain country is for the most part
densely wooded with fine timber, even to the very summits; at
some of the higher elevations, however, especially in the N.E.,
many of the peaks are quite bare, or only partially covered with
dwarfed trees or shrubs. The country north and south of this
great dividing range is moderately undulating or flat, consisting
often of large plains, in some parts quite destitute of trees, but
closely wooded in others. Along some parts of # the coast line,
however, especially in the Cape Otway, Western Port, and
Wilson’s Promontory districts, the land rises to considerable
altitudes (from 2000 to 3000 feet) by ranges generally well covered
by timber to their summits. On the whole, the country is not
well watered; the rivers are few and insignificant, and are often
nearly dry in summer; there are several lakes, both salt and
fresh, in different parts, but not of sufficient extent to have any
marked influence on the climate. The coast line itself is for the
most part comparatively flat, with a moderate elevation; although,
as just stated, at some places lofty ranges abut on the sea, and
the coast becomes precipitous and rugged.
An extensive sea-board, open to polar winds and oceanic
currents, modified, no doubt, by the presence of the island of
Tasmania; an extensive and wooded mountain range running
across the whole breadth of the colony, the higher portions of
which are often clothed in snow; and the generally arid sub-
tropical Australian interior, dominating on its northern and
western boundary, must each necessarily exercise considerable
influence in producing conditions of climate varying with the
locality.
For many years past the Colonial Government has maintained
a system of Meteorological Stations in various parts of the colony,
of which the Melbourne Observatory forms the centre; and
regular observations of temperature, pressure of air, humidity,
radiation, rain, &c., have been obtained for longer or shorter
intervals at each. These stations are distributed so that nearly
all districts possessing any climatic peculiarity are represented,
with the exception, perhaps, of the higher altitudes in our
mountain districts, and the arid plains in the north-west. They
are here enumerated :

In Melbourne, observations have been systematically recorded
for the last fourteen years; in Ballarat, Sandhurst, and Portland
complete records have been made since 1858, with some interrup-
tions in the two last-named stations ; at other stations observa-
tions for shorter periods have as yet only been obtained. The
results of these, however, are sufficient to establish many of the
most prominent characteristics of our > climate, and are now
annexed in order.
TEMPERATURE.
As temperature is undoubtedly the chief meteorological element
upon which climate depends, it will first engage our attention.
Appended are tables giving the mean monthly and annual tem-
peratures for the various stations, as well as tables of maxima,
minima, and range, both of air and soil, and of solar and terres-
trial radiation.

Table IV.— Temperature of Solar and Terrestrial Radiation
at Melbourne during a period of Thirteen Years (1859-1871).
Greatest difference during the above period .. .. 1380
From these tables the following facts may be derived;—The
mean annual temperature of Melbourne is 57°.0, which approxi-
mately represents that of the colony generally, namely, 56°.8.
The highest mean occurs at Portland, Gabo Island, and Sandhurst
(the two former being coast stations), while the lowest occurs at
Daylesford and Ballarat. There can be little doubt that the high
means at Portland and Gabo Island are caused by the neighbour-
hood of warm ocean currents, for although the annual mean
temperature of most stations on the coast are high, these, and
more especially Portland, appear above the average, while at
Sandhurst the temperatures range higher during the summer
months than at any other inland station. The low mean at
Daylesford and Ballarat is also due to the altitude of the stations
on the dividing range, the former being 2090, and the latter 1438
feet above the sea.
The annual mean temperature which obtains at Melbourne places
it within the same isotherms in the Southern Hemisphere as Lisbon,
Madrid, Marseilles, Florence, &c., in the Northern Hemisphere.
The ranges of temperature between summer and winter months,
however, appear to be much less than at most of these places, and
a more equable temperature may be assumed to exist in Mel-
bourne than at similar isotherms in the south of Europe. As
regards the extremes and range of temperature at the various
localities. Table 11. informs us that the highest temperatures in

the shade occur at Sandhurst in January, namely, 117°, while
Melbourne reaches I.ll°. There are, however, localities in which
even higher temperatures rule in the same month, especially on
the plains north of the Dividing Range and along the banks of the
Murray, between latitudes 34" and 36° 30', in which localities
the temperature has often been as high as 123° to 125° for several
days together. It is during the hot winds to which this climate
is subject in summer that our highest temperatures occur, but
they seldom last many hours, and are usually rapidly followed by
a change in direction of the wind, and by a comparatively low
thermometer, when a fall of 20° to 25° often occurs in as many
minutes.
The minimum temperatures occur in June, July, and August,
the lowest yet known in Melbourne being 27°'0, or 5° below
freezing point; at Portland, 27°; at Sandhurst, 27 0, 5; and at
Ballarat, 22°, or 10° below freezing.
Table IV. exhibits results of observations on terrestrial and
solar radiation obtained in Melbourne, the only station at which
they have been systematically made. The observations of solar
radiation are made with a thermometer whose bulb is made of
black glass, and also covered with a coating of very fine lamp-
black; the thermometer is enclosed in an outer exhausted and
hermetically-sealed glass tube. From the results of a series of
experiments with black-bulb thermometers, it appears that at
high temperatures such as are reached in this colony, no two black-
bulb thermometers agree; even when obtained from the best
makers, a difference of as much as 10° or 12° is often seen between
thermometers, which will register alike in ordinary temperatures,
when exposed to the sun’s rays at a temperature of 130° to 140°,
The temperature of the soil has been obtained at Melbourne
only. The results are given in Table 111,, from whence it will be
found that the greatest yearly ranges for the several depths are—
for 14 inches, 45° - 9; three feet, 29°; six feet, 22°.9; and eight feet,
20° - 4; while the mean temperatures in the same order are 59° 5,
59°’5, 60 o- 3, and 59 0, 9. N
The following table or Thermic Wind-rose will show the mean
temperatures for the various directions of the wind in winter and
summer:—

HUMIDITY.
Next in importance among the meteorological elements as
regards climate is probably that of humidity. The results obtained
from hygrometrical observations at the various stations are here
given in Table V.

Giving a mean annual temperature of the dew-point of 47 0, 6.
The humidity of the air is subject to very great and rapid
variations, especially during the summer months, when it is not
at all unusual that it is reduced from 60 to 24 per cent, in a few
hours; and frequently during the occurrence of hot winds, with a
daily mean of 30 or 40 per cent., it has been reduced as low as 13
or 15 per cent. In such cases of minimum humidity, however,
the daily mean or even an excessive humidity immediately follows
the change of wind.
PRESSURE OF AIR.
The mean pressure of air in Melbourne from discussion of four-
teen years’ observation appears to be 29 931 inches; this, reduced
to the sea level, becomes 30*022 inches. Tables VI. and VII.,
appended, give the mean monthly and annual pressure, and
monthly and annual range for the several meteorological stations
in the colony.

STATIONS.
The barometer is subject to very considerable oscillations, and
sometimes in very short periods —the greatest occurring during
storms from the W., S.W., and S.S.W. The greatest range yet
observed, amounting to 1719 inches, took place in 1863; the
maximum, 30 - 587, occurring in September, and the minimum,
28-868, in December in the same year, during a violent storm from
the west. The pressure, as influenced by the direction of wind,
will be seen by the following table of mean pressures observed at
Melbourne during winds from the various points of the
compass: —

The mean daily range in pressure of air for Melbourne, 120 feet„
and for Ballarat, 1437 feet, above the level of the sea, is given in
the table below: —
Year 0166 0-096
The mean daily range is greatest for Melbourne in September,
and least in February, from which Ballarat seems to differ, in so
far as there the greatest range occurs in August, the differences
for these months being 0 056 and 0 032 inches respectively.
As a rule, the greatest pressure occurs with the wind from S.
to S.E., and the lowest from N, to W. From discussion of many
years’ observation, there appears to be a maximum of mean
pressure in the early part of August.
RAINFALL.
Although Victoria has generally been considered a dry climate,
we find that the rainfall usually attains to the average of similar
latitudes in other parts of the world; but it is doubtless to the
large amount of spontaneous evaporation, as well as perhaps to the
immense tracts of unbroken surface soil, that the frequent
inadequacy of our rainfall is due. In some localities, however,
not only does the fall of rain reach a larger average, but, owing to
sheltered and most frequently submontane positions, the evapora-
tion is almost reduced to a minimum. This is particularly the
case in the valleys and gullies at the foot of our mountain ranges,
where the character of the vegetation is considerably modified
thereby.
From observations of the rainfall carried on since 1840, but
unfortunately with a break in the years 1851, ’52,’ 53, and ’54,
we may assume the annual average to be 25’66. From Professor
Neumayer’s observations of spontaneous evaporation it appears
that it amounts to 42 inches per annum, and occurs principally
during the spring and summer months; in winter and autumn
the rainfall generally exceeds the evaporation by a considerable
amount. It would thus appear that spontaneous evaporation
exceeds the rainfall by 164 inches. The conditions that generally
affect spontaneous evaporation can scarcely be brought to bear
upon any of the methods of observation usuually adopted, and
determinations made from a small surface of water in an open

/
position will, doubtless, give a result in excess of the average
evaporation, and such, I think, we may assume to be the case in
this instance; nevertheless, spontaneous evaporation in most parts
of Victoria is greatly in excess of the rainfall.
In the tables appended, the annual rainfall in Melbourne, and
other localities in which reliable observations have been made, is
given for each year, as well as the number of days’ rain and
amount of rainfall for every month and each year in Melbourne
from 1858 to 1865.

By selecting Melbourne as the locality in which the most ex-
tended series of observations have been obtained, we remark that
in the years 1848,1849, and in 1863, the rainfall was far above
the average ; in 1864, 1865, 1866, and 1870 it fell below the
average, especially 1865, when it only reached 15 9 inches. In
1848 and 1849 extensive and destructive floods occurred, and
again in 1863 ; in 1865 and 1866 the country suffered from a
severe drought; and the year 1851, following the heavy rains of
1849, was also a dry one, although the amount of rainfall, if ever
observed, cannot yet be ascertained. An opinion has often been
expressed that there is a periodicity in the excessive rainfalls and
droughts in Australia generally; but although the above results
may give some slight grounds for this supposition, a far greater
number of years’ observations will be necessary -from which to
deduce any law of this kind.
WINDS.
The alternation of the polar and equatorial currents of air con-
stitutes the main feature of the prevalent winds, modified, of
course, in the various localities by the physical features, and by
their situation with regard to the, mountain system. From dis-
cussion of the Melbourne observations, it seems evident the
northerly winds have the ascendancy both in frequency and force,
more especially during the winter months. S. and S.W. winds
come next in force, and, generally speaking, in frequency also.
The following tables give the results of frequency and velocity
of the different winds for each month, as deduced from the records
of the self-registering anemometer, and also -the percentage of
hours during which the wind has blown from different points of
the compass.

CLOUD.
Table XII. shows the mean amount of cloud present for each
month, at the several Meteorological Stations.
From discussion of the Melbourne observations respecting cloud,
a minimum seems to occur at 9 p.m., and a maximum at 7 aim.,
the averages being respectively for these periods 5T3 and 6 51.
It further appears that the amount in day-time exceeds that in
night-time.

As regards the presence of ozone, or of ozonic reaction, it is now
well established that this particular condition of the atmosphere
is always at its maximum during strong south-west and south
winds, and at its minimum during easterly and north-easterly
winds; and, further, that its presence is evinced to a greater
extent during the night -than during the day.
The electric condition of the air seems, so far as observations


have yet been made, to follow approximately the same variations
as have been observed in other countries. During the hot, dry
winds prevalent here in summer months, and the dust storms that
often accompany them, negative electricity prevails; this is also
generally the case during heavy rains, frequently to a large degree.
Positive electricity is usually observed as the wind springs up and
increases after calm weather, and especially when the wind comes
from the S. or S.W.
Although a moderately precise conception of. the climate of this
colony may be obtained from the foregoing remarks, there will yet
remain much that modifies a climate, even to a large extent, which
cannot be expressed in tables, or directly deduced from discussion
of the various meteorological elements. A brief description, there-
fore, of a cycle of the seasons will, in connection with the tables
already given, enable the reader to form a moderately correct idea
of the climate of Victoria.
The spring season, which may be said to include September,
October, and November, generally sets in about the beginning of
September; during which month, although slight frosts sometimes.
occur, the weather is usually mild and often quite warm. Rather
above the monthly average of rain also frequently falls. Strong
northerly and westerly winds are prevalent in September and
October, but the currents of air, both as regards frequency and
velocity, seem to be more equally distributed during these months
than at other parts of the year. The northerly winds begin to
assume the dry and warm condition which characterises them
throughout the summer months, and it is not at all unfrequent
that quite a hot wind may prevail for a short period even in
October; the weather generally, however, in September and
October, is genial and pleasant. November, also representing
the height of spring, is usually characterised by fine, warm, and
sometimes even hot weather. It is not at all unusual to get a large
rainfall in October or November, sometimes giving rise to exten-
sive floods; in some seasons, however, the rainfall after the com-
mencement of October diminishes considerably, and frequent
dry, and even hot, northerly winds in November parch the grass
and other herbage, giving to the plains and hills a sand-like
appearance; but in others the pastures remain green till January,
and in many parts of the colony throughout the year.
The summer season includes the months of December, January,
and February. December is often marked by very changeable
weather, and although generally hot and dry, it is not unfrequently
broken up by cold and stormy intervals, with heavy rains, and
gales of wind. The northerly winds become more or less hot ac-
cording to the amount and distribution of the rainfall throughout
the interior during spring. Very great changes of temperature


often take place in a few hours; for instance, a warm north wind
prevails in the morning, with a temperature reaching as high as
9(k to 100°; a lull in the afternoon is quickly followed by a strong
breeze from the S.W., and the temperature becomes reduced to
65° or 60° in fifteen or twenty minutes.
The highest mean temperature occurs in January; February
also is often characterised by great heat and dryness. It is during
these months that the northerly winds become perfect siroccos
for short periods, and if the spring hasjbeen dry, extensive bush-
fires occur on the plains and in the forests, giving rise to a con-
siderable increase of temperature, and superadding to the already
unpleasant state of things a smoky and lurid atmosphere over
considerable areas in the vicinity. Although unpleasantly hot
weather very frequently intervenes throughout the summer
months, yet a large and often the largest portion of the weather
is fine and pleasant, with cool southerly or south-westerly winds.
The autumn season, including the months of March, April, and
May, although subject to stormy weather, gales of wind, and large
rainfall—especially in its earlier part, and following the equinoxes
—may nevertheless be called the most genial and beautiful portion
of the year. It constitutes a second spring, for so soon as vege-
tation receives the moisture it has thirsted for through the
summer, the indigenous plants and trees put forth a growth that
often exceeds that of spring. The temperature on the whole
maintains a moderate mean; the northerly winds now become
cooler, and solar radiation is considerably reduced; heavy dews
fall at night, and sometimes towards the end of this season fog
occurs during the night and early morning in very calm weather.
In April the mean temperature becomes 59°, and in May 53°.
Winter includes June, July, and August. This season, though
usually marked by frequent rain and strong winds, especially from
the north, is in some years remarkably dry, witli a small rainfall;
the temperature does not reach its minimum till the middle of
July and the beginning of August, and seldom in Melbourne falls
much below freezing point. Ice and hoar-frost occur generally
only on a very few occasions during the winter in the neighbour-
hood of Melbourne, the former sometimes attaining a quarter of
an inch in thickness. At higher levels, however, frost and ice
have been observed as early as May, and forms much more fre-
quently during the winter months than at the lower levels; the
highest mountain sunynits too are in most seasons seen to be
clothed in snow by June, and sometimes even as early as the
beginning of May. The strongest winds in winter are usually
from the north, from which quarter it often blows with great
violence; wind from this direction is dry, and usually very cold
at this season.


The worst vicissitude to which the climate of Victoria is subject,
in common with Australia generally, is the occasional droughts;
these as already stated appear to follow those years characterised
by unusual rainfall; a fact that has given rise to a conjecture that
both the excessively wet and the excessively dry seasons are
periodical. The last drought to which the colony was subject
extended from the summer of 1865 till almost the winter of 1866,
and was doubtless due to the small rainfall in the autumn and
spring months.
