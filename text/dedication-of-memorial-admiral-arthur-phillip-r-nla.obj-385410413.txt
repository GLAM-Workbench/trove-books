Orbet of Service
HYMN
ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice
Him serve with fear, His praise forth
Come ye before Him, and rejoice.
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make ;
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
0 enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto ;
Praise, laud, and bless His Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why ? the Lord our God is good ;
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom Heav’n and earth adore,
From men and from the Angel-host
Be praise and glory evermore. Amen.
THE LORD’S PRAYER


Prayer for the British Empire
ALMIGHTY God, who rulest in the kingdom of men,
and hast given to our Sovereign Lord, King George,
a great dominion in all parts of the earth : Draw
together, we pray thee, in true fellowship the men of divers
races, languages, and customs, who dwell therein, that,
bearing one another's burdens, and working together in
brotherly concord, they may fulfil the purpose of thy
providence, and set forward thy everlasting kingdom.
Pardon, we beseech thee, our sins and shortcomings ; keep
far from us all selfishness and pride : and give us grace to
employ thy good gifts of order and freedom to thy glory
and the welfare of mankind ; through Jesus Christ thy
Son our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be
all glory and dominion, world without end. Amen.
Prayer for the Peace of the World
ALMIGHTY God, from whom all thoughts of truth and
peace proceed : Kindle, we pray thee, in the hearts
of all men the true love of peace ; and guide with
thy pure and peaceable wisdom those who take counsel
for the nations of the earth ; that in tranquility thy
kingdom may go forward, till the earth is filled with the
knowledge of thy love ; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Prayer for Industrial Peace
OGOD, the Father of all mankind, we beseech thee
to inspire us with such love, truth, and equity, that
in all our dealings one with another we may shew
forth our brotherhood in thee ; for the sake of Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

Prayer for Australia and the Homeland
O ALMIGHTY God, whose Divine Providence ordereth
all things and guides and rules the destinies of
Nations and Peoples : We thank Thee that out of
much toil and heroic struggles our beloved and honoured
Australia has become a great and distinguished Member of
the British Empire and Commonwealth.
We honour Australia, always loyal and in times of
danger ever ready to give her full offering of Life, Strength,
Means and Resources to serve and help the Motherland in
the day of trial. We pray that every blessing spiritual and
material, may by Thy Divine Grace, follow her in the path
of Honour, Loyalty, Peace, Fidelity and manly enterprise.
Bless 0 Lord and strengthen for their high duties the
Ministers and Governments of the Commonwealth of
Australia and grant that all therein may be united in the
bond of brotherhood, in prosperity and peace and in the
Fellowship of the Faith.
Forgive, 0 Lord, the faults, neglects and errors of
the past in the course of our Empire development and
grant us wisdom to fulfil Thy laws of Eternal righteousness,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


HYMN
OGOD, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home ;
Beneath the shadow of Thy Throne
Thy Saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine Arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone ;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream.
Bears all its suns away ;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
O God, our help in ages past.
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home. Amen.
