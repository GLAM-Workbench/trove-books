PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
Some Natural History Problems
of the Countryside.
BY
Professor Sir J. ARTHUR THOMSON, M.A., LL.D.
(Edin., Mc.Gill, Calif., et Aberd.).
Delivered June 10th , 1931.
On a holiday in southern Austria some years ago we stopped for
lunch at a simple wayside Gasthaus, and while we were waiting
entered into conversation with the friendly girl-waitress who had
lately finished her schooling. Among other things, being very
ignorant, we asked her the name of the fine river that hurried past.
Her eyes became bigger still at our stupid question, and she
answered; “Why, it is just the river” (Es ist halt der Fluss). Now
we knew well enough that hearing the river’s name would probably
not have made us much wiser, and we did not share the old lady's
(it is always an old lady) view that the cleverest thing the
astronomers have done has been finding out the names of the
stars, yet we could not but feel that the naive remark: “Why, it is
just the river,” was symptomatic of a too common human attitude
to the familiar. It is not yet easy for the average man to appreciate
the significance of the commonplace, for instance the biological
suggestiveness of the countryside, which we wish to illustrate.
Just as with the appreciation of beauty, so with scientific interest,
it does not usually begin at home.


We must remember that, prodigious as it it, Science is still
relatively young. It is only some two thousand years since Aristotle
laid the foundations of Biology, and apart from a few exceptional
enquirers, like Galen, there were few who built on them till the
Scientific Renaissance, which we may associate with the date 1548
when Copernicus published his book on the Heliocentric Revolution
of the earth and other planets, and Yesalius returned to Aristotelian
observation in his book on the structure of the human body. But
even after that dawn, which ended the Bark Ages, the interest in
Botany and Zoology was awakened and stimulated not by the plants
and animals at man’s door, but by rarities and exotics from other
lands or by strange treasures discovered in the sea. To cut a long
story short, it was but gradually that even those of enquiring spirit
realised that every countryside is a scientific El Dorado, every
hedgerow a jungle, every stream an Amazon. First of all the
taxonomists, like Ray and Linnaeus, showed that all the problems
of classification may be studied within the parish. Then the
naturalists whom we now call ecologists, men like Reaumur (pointing
on to Fabre), or like Gilbert White (pointing on to Darwin),
discovered the fascinating intricacy of the intimate life of everyday
creatures. Then the early microscopists revealed a new world of the
invisible, that makes the visible more intelligible. Thus one
observer, Leeuwenhoek, discovered Infusorians, Bacteria, and
spermatozoa. Then the entomologists in particular showed that
the deep problems of development were raised by the life-histories
of common animals like blue-bottles and butterflies. Huxley proved,
perhaps too convincingly, that all the discipline of biological
analysis—from organism to organs, from organs to tissues, from
tissues to cells and protoplasm—might be obtained from the study
of familiar types, like yeast-plant and amoeba, bean-plant and
frog.
It is a commonplace nowadays, but it took a long time for
naturalists to realise that all the problems of anatomy and physiology
and the other sub-sciences are abundantly illustrated at our doors,
though everyone must admit that the sea has a manifold biological
suggestiveness unparalleled on land, and that there are lessons from
the Tropics that cannot be readily learned in Temperate countries.
For some kinds of biological study it may be said that stay-at-
home conditions are best, as may be illustrated by Fabre’s observa-
tions of the intimate life of the insects of an apparently unpromising
corner, or by MialTs investigations of common water-insects, or by


Trombley’s story of the freshwater Hydra, or by Gilbert White’s
appreciation of earthworms or by Tregartben’s descriptions of the
home-life of otter and badger, or by Miss Frances Pitt’s field natural
history,—perhaps the finest of its kind.
It is undesirable to exaggerate a point like this, for how impover-
ished our Zoology would be without Peripatus and the King-Crab,
without the Pearly Nautilus and the Lancelot, and so on in many
directions, but it will be generally agreed that for the study of habits
and inter-relations (ecology) and for the study of life-histories
(embryology) there are unsurpassed opportunities in the countryside
around us, including, of course, such streams and lakes as the parti-
cular locality may include. What a lot Darwin got out of by no
means unusual hedgerows (with their climbing plants), meadows
(with their bee-visited orchises), marshes (with their sundews),
grass-fields (with their earthworms) and copses with their struggle
for existence.
What we wish to do is to illustrate from the common sights and
ongoings of any countryside, that even the very deepest problems
of Biology are there to be studied. Nature bristles with marks of
interrogation if we could only see them—translucent question-marks
among the leaves of grass and the petals of the flowers, among the
feathers of birds and the hairs of mammals, —everywhere.
Cuckoo- Spit.
In some parts of the country nothing is more familiar in May
and June than the little bunches of froth on the wayside grasses
and herbs, the so-called cuckoo-spit, whose name recalls the facile
Natural History of old times. The froth is made by the young stages
of the common frog-hopper, Aphrophora spumaria or some related
insect, which we find in the middle of the mass and can without
difficulty observe. It pierces the skin of the plant; it sucks up
sap ;it overflows with sweetness; it moves its posterior body up
and down rhythmically ; it entangles air in a groove on the under-
surface ; it whips four things together —the sugary sap, the air, a
little digestive ferment from the food-canal, and a trace of a waxy
secretion from its skin ; and makes what may almost be called a
soap. This lasts during the heat of the day ; it conceals the froth-
blower ; it is rarely interfered with unless by an occasional wasp.
How many half-solved problems we have here in this insect that
saves its life by blowing soap-bubbles.


Hibernation.
How many ways animals have of meeting the winter—how few
of them we really understand. The hedgehog hibernates and we
know many details about the slowing down or even cessation of the
bodily functions and of the subtle changes in the tissues, including
the blood. The heart beats slowly and feebly; the breathing
movements are slight; digestion and excretion have stopped ; the
reflexes are dulled ; the body-temperature is low; there is no income
save a little oxygen and no expenditure save in internal movements
and the consumption of some stored fatty substances. One would
like to know about the production of hormones.
What a strange state is that of the hibernating hedgehog, so far
away from ordinary sleep, though perhaps with some illuminating
resemblance. A flash of light comes from the idea that hibernators
are mammals that have not quite freed themselves from the legacy
of their cold-blooded reptilian ancestors. When the warmth of
summer wanes and supplies.of food become scarcer, it is no longer
possible for these imperfectly warm-blooded mammals («.//., hedge-
hog, dormouse, marmot, and bat) to balance their heat-accounts.
They are losing more heat than their muscles are making; they
relapse towards reptiledom, towards cold-bloodedness. But if they
fell asleep, so to speak, in the open country, they would perish, for
their body-temperature would sink to that of the outside world,
which would be fatal. So their peculiarity has become linked to
the self-preservative instinct of seeking out a retreat within the
thickly curtained recesses of the hedge or in the hollow of an old
tree, where in a confined space the temperature rises above that
outside, and the hibernator is safe. Their weakness has been
turned into a source of strength. But it is only a sketchy account
that can as yet be given of the physiology and evolution of hiberna-
tion. And even when we know much more, there will loom before
us the very attractive problem of arranging in some scientific order
all the different phases of lying low and saying nothing—cold-coma,
fatigue-collapse, auto-intoxication, winter-lethargy, normal sleep,
animal hypnosis, catalepsy, human hypnosis, de-differentiation and
the final sleep of death.
The Bee Language.
Bee-keepers and bee-experts have nourished a justifiable pride in
the thoroughness of their knowledge of that admirable insect. And
yet how much this knowledge has deepened within recent years.


How interesting are the observations of von Frisch on the honey-
dance in which the successful worker indulges when she returns to
the hive well-laden with treasure-trove. She pirouettes for a minute
on the honeycomb, dancing round in a peculiar way, which is oven
different from that which is seen when her load is not nectar but
pollen. Then she shifts her position a little and repeats the
performance. This happens several times, and the resting
bystanders become interested, they crowd on her and get the scent
of the flower she burgled. With this olfactory clue they issue
forth and find the patch of white clover, or whatever it was, that
the original worker discovered. After a while that particular
supply is exhausted ; the workers that return empty show no dance ;
the bystanders are unexcited and thus fruitless expeditions
automatically cease. The details of this olfactory and visual bee-
language are very convincing ; and so are the observations of
Rosch on the gradual promotion of the young worker-bee from one
duty to another within the hive —until she eventually undertakes
her short-lived industry of foraging. Rdsch’s observations offer a
useful corrective of exaggerated views of the tyranny of instinct.
The Problem of Homing.
A very interesting problem, to which those who live in the less
sophisticated parts of the country might readily contribute, is the
puzzle of orientation from a distance. It is well-known that a
worker-bee taken from the hive in a little box and liberated at a
distance of half a mile or so, usually ascends in the air, swings
round in a circle, and then makes a bee-line for home. Out of
thirteen marked bees which Professor Yung took from Geneva
into the surrounding country, eleven were back at the hive before
the experimenter, whereas of those taken out in a boat on the lake
none found their way home. Very numerous experiments of a
similar nature seem to prove for bees and ants that in the majority
of cases the homing may be reasonably referred to the experience
which these insects build up of the region round about their home.
They acquire an individual knowledge of the topography of the
region within a limited radius. They utilise cues which are mostly
visual, but may also be olfactory and tactile. Occasionally there
may be a registration of slope, illumination, and muscular
movements, but the gist of the matter is that in the majority of
cases the success in homing may be attributed to previous
apprenticeship. The residual puzzles are very interesting, but in


most cases, and for the lower animals in general, the homing is
due to individual learning. This seems to be true also of those
varied animals, e.<j., tortoise, pigeon, guinea-pig, and rat, which
learn more or less rapidly to find their way in or out of a Hampton
Court maze, although in these cases we do not as yet know of what
the process of learning precisely consists. A rat can learn blind-
folded and without any detectable olfactory cues.
While some investigators like Roubaud incline to the conclusion
that all homing from a distance depends on previous individual
apprenticeship; it is difficult at present to accept this theory. It
does not cover all the facts. Thus we know that a percentage of
the Sooty and Noddy terms transported in closed baskets on board
ship from the Tortugas Islands, where they nest, to places like Cape
Ilatteras, which is outside their migratory range, manage to return
to their nests. We also know of many cases where young birds
born in Britain, seem to migrate alone from their summer quarters
to an unknown goal in the south. Moreover there are suggestive
cases like the young Loggerhead Turtles, where there is effective
orientation without any individual experience at all. The newly-
hatched Loggerheads, having wriggled out of the sand, make
straight for the sea, which is their future home, and in experimental
conditions they will creep uphill and overcome difficulties in
obedience to this seaward impulse. On the floor of a deep tub they
move in all directions tentatively, but if they are placed on a tub
turned upside down they move persistently to the shore side. Here
we have evidently to do with an inborn compulsion, prior to
experience, and Prof. G. H. Parker has proved that what pulls the
trigger of the tropism is the opener horizon. Their constitution is
hereditarily wound up to respond to the more illumined field, which
is usually the seaward side.
Thus the question may well be raised whether there is not in
some creatures, such as the migrant birds, somewhat more than the
enregistered outcome of individual experience, namely an inherited
“sense of direction,” which may mean a racially enregistered
predisposition to respond to stimuli coming in a certain direction
by movements in definite relation thereto.
Now our present point is that those living in the quieter parts of
the country may have opportunity to make careful experiments on
the alleged homing powers of mammals, such as cats and dogs,
horses and even sheep. There seems to be no doubt that a cat
taken in a basket by rail from Fife to Ayrshire lost no time in


re-appearing at its old home, but no precise dates are forthcoming,
no detective methods were applied, and the chance was lost of
taking the cat back to Ayrshire and keeping a watch on her
movements. Quick return home after a transport of three miles
has been proved, but orientation from a distance, or for a long
distance, remains a moot question, and a very interesting one.
The Cat and the Dog.
Many everyday phenomena pass unappreciated ; we look at them
with mole’s eyes whose lenses are so imperfectly finished that they
cannot form more than a blurred image. As the pace of life
quickens, we tend to lose our power of scrutinising, as Fabre called
it, that is to say, of peering into things with a resolutely inquisitive
eye. “A poor life this, if full of care, we have no time to stand
and stare,”
Everyone is familiar with the behaviour of a cat surprised by an
obtrusive dog—how it arches up its back and shows its canines, how
the tail stiffens and the hair stands on end. But how few have
scrutinised this familiar scene. The cat experiences an emotional
storm—not of fear so much as of anger ; the excitement, becoming
physiological, affects the nervous system and thence the suprarenal
bodies which produce the powerful hormone known as adrenalin.
There is an increased production of adrenalin and this is distributed
by the blood throughout the body. It increases the heart-beat, the
efficiency of the muscles, the supply of sugar from the liver, and has
other even subtler influences. Thus it is said to increase the
coagulability of the blood, so that the body of the cat is not only
spoiling for a fight, it is even being prepared for wounds. Even
subtler, however, is the effect of the hormone on the minute smooth
muscle-cells which lie at the base of the hairs—the arrectores
pilorum. It is the contraction of these that makes the hairs stand
on end, with the result that the cat looks much larger than usual,
and its assailant finds it convenient to remember an engagement
somewhere else. Now our understanding of this familiar sight is a
long way from being complete, and while the chain of events can
only be followed by the expert physiologist, there is much for the
ordinary observer still to do. Thus there is a lack of unanimity in
regard to the cat’s emotional storm,


Ways of Earthworms,
In 1777 Gilbert White wrote his famous letter on earthworms,
one of the best illustrations of the harvest of a countryman’s patient
eye. We should go back to that remarkable letter to appreciate
afresh its thoroughness, for in his picture of the work of earthworms
Gilbert White anticipated most of the points which Darwin with
his supreme carefulness proved up to the hilt. In his terse and
prescient letter Gilbert White said that “ a good monograph of
worms would afford much entertainment and information at the
same time, and would open a large and new field in natural history,”
and none of us who have made our pilgrimage to the Down House
can have missed the thrill of seeing on the lawn the flat stone which
Darwin used in his famous experiments which proved that earth-
worms are the most humanly useful animals in the whole world.
In his letter of 1777 Gilbert White said: “These hints we think
proper to throw out, in order to set the inquisitive and discerning
at work,” and Darwin’s ecological masterpiece was published in
1881, the year before he died, the outcome of over forty years of
observation, begun when he was a truant student of medicine in
Edinburgh University.
Now we must be clear that in spite of the perfection of Darwin’s
study of earthworms, there is still room for “ the inquisitive and
discerning ”to keep working. Some years ago we noticed thirteen
long tough midribs, radiating like the spokes of a wheel, round the
mouth of an earthworm’s burrow'. They were too tough to be of use
and had been left outside, w'hile their leaflets had been buried. A
glance round showed that the midribs belonged to a Mountain Ash or
Rowan Tree, growing close by ; and as each leaf has seven leaflets,
there had evidently been a burial of 91, some of which wore readily
visible. Now there was nothing novel or startling here, but the
fact that 91 leaflets had been taken in a short time into one burrow
would have pleased Darwin, and was, as it were a picturesque post-
script to his great book on The Formation of Vegetable Mould by
the Agency of Earthworms.
Similar, but of greater importance, is the fact, which many must
have noticed, the earthworms take irrelevant objects such as pieces
of string and entire feathers into their holes. These are possibly
of use in making the burrows more comfortable, but the interest of
the observations is in showing that it is instinctive on the earth-
worms part to grip objects that are superficially like leaf-stalks.
They do not exhibit intelligent selection, and yet the question rises why


they should leave midribs on the surface, while taking some-
what stiff feathers underground. More observations are needed.
Earthworms have been kept in a Y-shaped tube so arranged that
if they climb up through one of the arms of the Y they reach a
pleasant surface, while if they try the other they find themselves
in a blind alley with a mild electric shock. They soon learn the
lesson, profiting by experience. But headless earthworms are
almost as quick in keeping to the right side, so that we are warned
once more, as Spinoza said, that we must not be too sure about
what the body as body may not learn.
Gossamer Spiders.
The problem of gossamer was more than half solved by a boy of
fourteen—Jonathan Edwards, who afterwards wrote the famous
Freedom of the Will. On a breezy morning, especially in autumn,
small light-loving spiders of several species, are in the habit of
ascending gateposts and tall herbs, obeying an inborn negative
geotropism. They stand with their head to the wind and pay out
threads of silk, usually, we believe, four in number in British spiders.
As these become longer the wind tugs at them ; with a vault the
spinner lets go and turns upside down ; it is supported by its silken
parachutes and carried far afield. It is credited with adding to the
length of the threads if the wind falls, and of furling its sails if
the breeze becomes too strong. Eventually, and partly by coiling
up the threads, hundreds of the aeronauts sink to the earth, and
the fields and hedgerows, links and meadows are covered with
gossamer. Now we have to link this interesting custom with the
spider’s instinctive paying out of a drag-line in critical situations
and also to the tropism of climbing upwards. We have to connect
it with Blackwall’s neat observation that spiders imprisoned on a
plant in a moat-surrounded flower-pot made their escape by this
sort of ballooning, but never made the gossamber threads unless
there were appreciable air-currents in the room—this stimulus being
apparently necessary to activate the instinct. But surely there is
need for repeated critical observations. Is it all quite certain ?
What do the gossamer spiders gain by their passive migration ?
Why do hundreds and thousands balloon on the same morning?
And other questions arise ?
Colour-Blind Animals.
Sometimes what is needed is an extension of conclusions that are
probably correct but require corroboration. Thus, apart from the


microscopic study of the eye, which must be left for the experts, it
should not be difficult to extend our observational knowledge of the
degree to which various types of animals appreciate differences of
colour, which must, of course, be carefully distinguished from
differences in brilliance or reflecting capacity. If hens are given a
mixture of grey grains and blue grains, they are said to ignore the
blue ones—at least till all the others have been picked up. This
may mean that they do not readily see blue, or that they are more
attracted by grey. Most diurnal birds are said to be relatively
colour-blind to blues, and most nocturnal birds are said to be
relatively colour blind to reds, as is inferred partly from experiment
and partly from the abundance of brightly coloured oil-globules in
the cones in the retina—oil-globules supposed to interfere with
colour-discrimination.
If this conclusion is substantiated, it is not only of physiological
interest, but of biological importance, for the Darwinian theory of
Sexual Selection will be weakened if it can be shown that the female
birds are indifferent to the males’ decorative blueness.
Many of us will probably remember the story of Madame Theophile,
a clever cat which was cherished by the French poet Gautier.
According to the story the poet had bought a green parrot which he
set free on the floor of the breakfast-room. The cat came in and
seeing the newcomer said to herself: Why this must be a chicken,
a green chicken to be sure, but none the less a chicken and therefore
good to eat. But as she sprang at the parrot, she was met by the
question ; “ Have you had your breakfast ? ” The cat fell back, her
thoughts were apparent. “ This is not a bird ; it speaks ; it is a
gentleman.” Now one should not too scientifically criticise good
stories of this type, but the question rises whether cats can distin-
guish colour, io the best of my knowledge all cats are colour-
blind ; but is this quite certain ? And what about other creatures ?
In Conclusion.
No one will suppose for a moment that I am upbraiding the
country naturalists for neglecting the opportunities at their doors.
The fact is that the British record of Field Natural History or
Ecology is one to be proud of. But it is for us not only to keep
up the standard, but to realise that our inquiries may be much
deeper than is often regarded as practicable. To substantiate the
novel occurrence of a bird or a flower is well enough in its way,
but it is more important to contribute to the deeper biological


problems which crowd us at our doors. How much, for instance,
we have still to learn about the Cuckoo’s strange ways.
Therefore I would conclude by mentioning a few problems in
regard to which every precisely observed fact is useful. (1) Why
do we find in some parts of the country so many dead shrews in
the fall of the year ? Is it possible that the shrew is not much
more than an annual ?
(2) How is it that partridges and some other close-sitting birds
are practically devoid of their usual odour when they are brooding?
(3) How many birds have a sense of smell besides owls, night
hawks, magpies, ravens, blackbirds, woodcock, pigeons and a few
others in which it has been experimentally proved ?
(4) Do adult salmon never feed in fresh water, as the state of
their food-canal seems plainly to indicate? And if they do not,
how is it that they take the fly and other lures ? Are they like
children who have no appetite for their porridge, but cannot resist
a bit of bacon ? Or is it that an unusual bait pulls the gulping
instinct irresistibly ?
(5) If you put the tentacle of a Sun-dew under the microscope
and stimulate the tip with the faintest trace of ammonium phosphate
you see a remarkable change passing from cell to cell from the tip
downwards. The coloured cell-contents take curious shapes,—the
phenomenon is called aggregation —and some message travels.
Darwin noticed it, of course, and anyone can see, but does anyone
understand it ? Possibly, of course, this problem of aggregation
has been well-worked out—no one can keep abreast of biological
research—but if it has not been seriously tackled, it should be ; and
the material is at hand. There is a great deal still to do in studying
the animal hidden in the plant.
(6) How many thousands of people lift a lady-bird on their fingers
every year, and have watched its motionlessness until it suddenly flies
away. A slight jar suffices to send death-watch beetles and many
others into a more markedly inert—almost cataleptic—state. Though
the problem has been studied, there is a long way yet to go with
the puzzle of death-feigning in its various grades.
(7) Why does a hen advertise her egg-laying so loudly, surely in
wild conditions thereby attracting the attention of hungry ears ?
Why do owls hoot when there is no question of courting ? Is not
their noisiness, often more than vocal, apt to defeat their own
predatory ends ?
(8) Do voles ever grow old or do they continue growing and


youthful until they come to a violent end ? In wild animals are
there any senile changes apart from accidentally broken teeth and
the like ? Do guinea-pigs ever go to sleep ? How many mammals
show any trace of dieaming?
(9) Whether we like it or not we are peripatetic breweries, and
the number of fermentations that go on in the bodies of plants and
animals is past counting. In the sprouting seeds, in the sugar-
factories of the green leaves, in the food-canal of every animal, in
the winking of an eye, there is fermentation ; and here we enter
deep waters. But our point at present is that it was no coincidence
that Pasteur, who was one of the first to recognise the fundamental
importance of fermentations in life, was in his boyhood familiar
with his countryside and its wine-making.
(10) The green Hydra in the pond and the freshwater sponge in
the river have their partner green Algae. The grub of the death-
watch beetle flourishes on a dryasdust diet of old wood, but it does
so because of the fermenting yeasts in its food-canal. All Legum-
inous plants have partner Bacteria in their root-tubercles by means
of which they are able to fix the free nitrogen in the soil-water or
the soil-air, though we do not quite know how. Many trees, like
Conifers, seem unable to thrive without the mycorhiza root-fungus
which is normally found in intimate association with their roots.
According to Miss Rayner the heather succeeds on the unready soil
of the moorland because it is penetrated through and through with
a partner-fungus; but this view has still to meet some severe
criticism. To these and a hundred similar problems the biologists
of the country should be able to make useful contributions.
This then is our proposition, that the sound work which is done
by naturalists who have the good fortune to live in the country, or
to be often there, might be profitably deepened by considering some
of the countless marks of biological interrogation which are every-
where to be discerned. One must remember that while the greatest
of all naturalists had his Beagle voyage, he spent most of his life
at Down.
