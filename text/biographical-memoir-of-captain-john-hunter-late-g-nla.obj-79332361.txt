BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS OP
CAPTAIN JOHN HUNTER,
tATK COVIRNOR OF NEW SOUTH WALES*
Perseverance keep* honour bright; to have done,
I* to hang quite out of fashion, like rusty mail
In monumental mockery : take the instant way,
? For Honour travels in a strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast; keep then the path.
For Emulation hath a thousand sons,
That one by one pursue; if you give way.
Or edge aside from the diredt forthright,
Like to an entered tide, they all rush by,
And leave you hindmost. Shaksfbaxs.
''J'HERE are few individuals whose exertions are more
beneficial to society, or whose labours are more arduous,
than those who devote their time and attention to the
painful task of reclaiming the unprofitable waste; and by
dint of persevering industry convert the inhospitable wild,
the haunt of the shivering savage, into rich fields crowned
with smiling harvests, the chearful abode of social man, and
the busy mart of commerce and plenty.
The subjeft of this memoir was born at Leith, in Sep-
tember 1738; his father commanded a ship in the merchant
service for many years ; his mother was the only daughter of
J. Drummond, Esq. eldest brother of the late Provost Drum-
mond, of Edinburgh. Mr, Hunter having observed in his
son a desire for a maritime life, did not discourage these early
propensities to his entering into this dangerous though
honourable profession j and being about undertaking a
voyage to the coast of Norway, he carried his son with him,
although at too early an age to acquire much knowledge of
maritime affairs, yet he thought it would serve to try how
far a sea life might, after a short voyage, be really his choice*
On this first essay they had the misfortune of being ship-
wrecked on the coast of Norway, near a small fishing town,
the inhabitants of which flocked to the scene of distress ;
amongst them was a group of women, who, when our young

biographical memoirs
sailor was landed from the wreck, being then a small delicate
boy, took him up in their arms, and carried him home to
the house of an honest fisherman, where he was taKen great
care of, and put to bed between two of the good man s
daughters, whose care and caresses he long remembered with
gratitude ; his father until next day could not learn any in-
telligence of him-, although he knew he had been saved from
the wrecks our youngster found himself so very comfortable
in his present quarters, that he did not express any impatience
to see his father.
Soon after their return to Scotland our juvenile adventurer
was sent to his uncle, Robert Hunter, then a merchant in
tynn Regis, who, considering his nephew too young for any
particular profession, very prudently sent him again to
school in the town of Lynn. Here he became acquaint*!
with the celebrated Charles Burney, Doflor of Music, who
was then organist to the principal church in that town, and
from being much in bis family, began to testify a desire
of being educated for the profession of music, but his unc e
would not consent to his following'this propensity, although
much the nephew?s wish ; he, however, so far indulged the
youth?s inclination as to permit his becoming a scholar for
a short time. He was at one period intended for the church,
having gone so far through his education at the schools in
Edinburgh as to have read the best Latin authors, and was
sent to the University of Aberdeen, but could not be pre-
vailed on to remain there. The early misfortune of ship-
wreck, so incident to a maritime life, did not abate his
ardour for naval pursuits, and finding the desire he enter-
tained for becoming an apprentice to Dr. Burney, was not
to be indulged, be expressed to his uncle a wish to embark
attain on a sea life t he was, therefore, recommended to
Captain Thomas Knackston, commanding Ins Majesty s
sloop Grampus, upon the Lynn station, and was received
on board that ship as a Captain?s servant m May, 1754-
Being now sixteen years old, and having acqu.red some ex-
perience in his former voyage to Norway, he was capable of

occasionally doing duty before the mast as a topraan, in
which station he was placed, on the Grampus being appointed
one of the convoy to attend his Majesty, King George 11,
the last time he went to the Continent.
During his continuance in this ship, Mr. Hunter became a
very great favourite with a most capable seaman and Officer,
one of the Midshipmen, a Mr. Alien, who pointed out to him
the necessity of learning the art of na\igation, and that this
being an essential part of the duties of a Sea Officer, if
ever he expected to arrive at the rank of one, he ought to
apply himself with great assiduity to the study he had recom-
mended. Our young seaman, at all times eager in the
pursuit of knowledge, availed himself of this excellent advice,
and profiting by the kind promises of assistance which his
friend offered him, instantly set about this useful and im-
portant study, and in a very short lime had completely gone
through all the common rules of navigation, and soon con-
vinced his teacher that he was desirous of going much
deeper in mathematical pursuits than it was in his power to
lead him ; this Mr. Allen candidly confessed, but he recom-
mended to him the perusal of books on that subject j in his
present situation, however, he had no opportunity of ac-
quiring books on. that science, it was a period at which the
study pf mathematics was not much attended to. In 1755, Mr.
Hunter was removed from the Grampus to the Centaur, of
24 guns, commanded by Captain William Brown *, in which
ship, although young, he was in the capacity of an able
seaman, and did his duty before the mast, in one of the tops,
being light, aftive, and zealous ; after having served in this
station about fifteen months, his Captain called him from
the mast-head one day, from whence he had just sent down
the foretop gallant-yard, and inquired if he had any other
clothes than his jacket and trowsers, to which he replied he
had ; then, said the Captain, ? you will take off your jacket
? Thi* was previous to the capture of the French ship of that name, of 74
guns,

and trowscrs, put on your other clothes, and do your dutv
as a Midshipman *; I have taken notice of your diligent and
aflive conduft some time past, and I will serve you if you
continue to deserve my notice.? This change of situation,
in the same ship in which he had so long lived amongst the
seamen, our young mariner did not relish ; he had no ob-
jection to being promoted to the rank of Midshipman in any
other ship, but he feared that in the Centaur his intimacy
with the rest of the crew might in some degree affeft his
authority ; he, however, took his station on the quarter*
deck as a Midshipman, and soon got the better of his fears
respecting a due obedience in the men to his authority ; his
situation now gave him more frequent opportunities of
following up his favourite studies of mathematics and draw-
ing, and we find him employing himself in construct-
ing an instrument for measuring inaccessible heights, for
he could not afford to purchase a quadrant, and amusing
himself in trying its truth, by ascertaining the length of the
ship?s masts above the deck, and in proving its correaness
r , . . �.7 1.1 -.'v- I
by real measurement.
In 1757, he was recommended to Admiral Knowles, who
received him as a Midshipman on board the Union, of go
guns, then fitting at Chatham for his flag; that ship pro-
ceeded to the Downs, where she continued some time as
flag-ship to Admiral Smith, and the Neptune being ap-
pointed at Spithead to carry the flag of Admiral Knowles,
Mt. Hunter was ordered to join her, and in this ship he
served as a Midshipman on the expedition against Rochefort,
when Admiral Knowles being the second in command, his
division was sent in against the batteries on the island of
Aix. After this service was terminated, Admiral Knowles
having struck his flag, our young Officer had new friends to
look for; but having no interest he continued in the Neptune
as Midshipman. This ship for some time bore the flag
of Admiral Holmes, and was afterwards a private ship, com-
? Uniforms were not at that time very common in the service.

manned by Captain Galbraithe, and employed in the fleet
under Lord Anson, cruising off Brest. In 1759* the flag
of Admiral Saunders was hoisted in the Neptune, and his
Officers and followers were received on board ; Capt. B. Hart-
well, as the Admiral?s Captain, succeeded Capt. Galbraithe.
The vast numbers of young men who on this occasion
came upon the quarter-deck of the Neptune with views of
promotion, left little hope of advancement to Mr. Hunter j
he, however, continued in the ship, and served at the
memorable reduction of Quebec in that year. In this ship
Mr. Jervis, now Earl St. Vincent, was the Admiral?s First
Lieutenant } to him our sailor looked up, and hoped to have
made by his diligence a friend of, but promotion to the com-
mand of a sloop of war removed Mr. Jervis from the Neptune.
In February 1760, Mr. Hunter passed his examination at the
Navy Office for a Lieutenant, but not having any interest with
Adm, Saunders, who was now ordered to the Mediterranean,
Mr. Hunter was removed, at his own request, before she sailed,
into the Royal Ann at Bpithead, in which was the flag of
Admiral Durell, to whom he was a little known ; and as the
Princess Amelia was the Admiral?s proper ship, Mr, Hunter
was sent to Plymouth to join her. Mr. Hunter was not, from
his want of interest, deterred from perseverance} he had now
acquired as great a share of professional knowledge as was
to be found in the generality of young men at his time of
life, and trusted that by a diligcn)t attention to the im-
provement of the share he now possessed, and to the increase
of it on all the different duties of the profession, he might
hope in time to raise some friend sufficiently powerful
to serve him. Mr. Hunter now assiduously applied to the
study of every thing which appeared to be connected with the
duties of a Sea Officer, and soon made himself master of
the theory of maritime surveying, and of practical astronomy
as connefted with navigation, Mr. Hunter also by dint
of diligent application became tolerably expert in drawing
views, either on the land or water j in short he attained that


354 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR!
degree of professional skill, which, joined ?to a steady and
unremitting attention to duty, obtained at length the great
objea of his hopes ; but we shall trace his progress from
his present situation until he attained the rank which he
now holds.
When the Princess Amelia ceased to be a flag-ship in the
fleet commanded by Sir Edward Hawke in Quibcron Bay, in
1760, Mr. Hunter obtained a recommendation to that Ad-
miral, and was taken into the Royal George as a Midship-
man, where he continued until peace was restored. Here for
the present his hopes of gaining promotion in the Navy
were at an end, and he began to consider how he was in
future to employ himself so as to provide a temporary sub-
sistence. He wished to enter into the merchant service, but
in that as well as the Navy, interest was found necessary, and
he was so unfortunate as not to possess any. It is true he
had some promises of interest in that service, but they were
so faint and uncertain, that after having remained in Lon-
don, depending on them until his slender finances were
nearly exhausted, he pushed off for Portsmouth, in hopes he
might be received into some of the ships in commission at
that port. In this attempt he succeeded, and got on board
the Tweed frigate, commanded by the Hon. Captain T.
Percival, on the Newfoundland station ; on this service he
became Master?s Mate, and continued during the years 1764
and 1765. In 1766, his old Commander, Admiral DurelJ,
being appointed to the command of the fleet in North Ame-
rica, Mr. Hunter embarked again with him in the Launceston,
as Master?s Mate ; as this Admiral was his particular friend,
his prospers of advancement brightened, and he had at pre-
sent some cause to be a little sanguine; his hopes were, how-
ever, but of short duration, they were clouded by the deatk
of the Admiral, which melancholy event took place three
days after his arrival at Halifax. Immediately after this
unfortunate circumstance Mr. Hunter was ordered into a
small schooner of twenty-two tons burthen, and directed


OF CAPTAIN JOHN HUNTER.
to carry Lord Colvill's dispatches to the Gulph of St. Law-
rence, in search of the senior Captain, the health of his
Lordship being such as would not admit of his remaining in
his command until another successor should arrive from
England. On his return, the Launceston was ready for sea
and proceeded to the Virginia station. Mr. Hunter con-
tinued in that ship with Captain Cell, as Master?s Mate, till
1767, when the situation of Master falling vacant, he was
direded by his Captain to do the duty, and in 1768, he
was confirmed in that appointment by a warrant from Com-
modore Hood, who was then Commander in Chief of the
fleet in North America.
1 he Launceston returned to England in 1769, and was put
out ot commission; Mr. Hunter thought it proper now to un-
deigo an examination at the Trinity House, where he gaveso
much satisfaction to the Examiners, that they gave him a
qualification for a fourth-rate at once. He was soon after
this appointed to the Carysfort frigate, Captain William
Hay, ordered on the Jamaica station. In 1771, that ship
sailed from Port Royal for Pensacola, where she continued
about three months, during which time Mr. Hunter made
himself well acquainted with the pilotage of that harbour,
of which he made a chart; when they left this port they
sailed for the Havannah, and entered that harbour, but were
not permitted to land; the Spaniards were at this time
carrying on some very extensive works on the high ground
called the Cavannos : a circumstance pf such consequence
did not escape the inquiring mind of Mr. Hunter; from the
mast head, dressed as a common seaman, he made drawings
of every thing to be seen from that station, which drawings
he afterwards presented to Sir H. Falliser, then Comptroller
of the Navy, who during his life- time duly appreciated Mr.
Hunter's talents.
The Carysfort having a pilot from Jamaica for the Gulph
of Florida on board, the ship was on her way through the
-Gulph, and owing to the perverseness, obstinacy, and igno-
rance of this pilot, run ashore in the"night upon the Martyr


Reefs, in that passage, where her situation was such,as pro*
snised little chance of being able to save the ship, and on its
first appearance not much hope of preserving the lives of
the crew; here all the exertion which could be made by
every experienced seaman in the ship became necessary, and
on this, as on every occasion where personal efforts or pro-
fessional skill could aid the public service, we find Mr.
Hunter very conspicuous ; for nine days and nights Captain
Hay was not in a bed, nor Mr. Hunter off the deck; the
masts were cut away, an anchor was carried out astern, and
in letting it go, the night being extremely dark, Mr.
Hunter?s leg was caught in the bite of the cable, and brought
the anchor up, but the bone was not broke, and he was
still able to walk ; in cutting the main-mast away, his right
hand was lamed in such a manner as to deprive him of its
use for some time; but these misfortunes did not relax his
ardour for the preservation of his Majesty?s ship, a circum-
stance which, we believe, his Commander, who is still alive,
will readily acknowledge *. The ninth day after this acci-
dent the ship was got out from amongst those dangerous
reefs, through a very difficult and intricate passage, which
Mr. Hunter had buoyed, and was carried to sea under jury-
masts, with the loss of her guns, &c. they were no sooner
out of this danger than Mr. Hunter?s great exertions occa-
sioned the rupture of a blood vessel in his lungs, which
discharged so great a quantity of blood as to induce the
surgeon to think he could not live more than two days;
being, however, naturally of a good constitution, he sur-
mounted all these misfortunes.
The ship was carried to Charleston, South Carolina, re-
fitted, and thence went back to Jamaica; in 1772, she
returned to England, when the drawings of the Havannah,
and a view of the Bocha Chica, or entrance of the harbour
of Carthagena on the Main, having been sent to the

of captain john hunter, 3^7
Comptroller of the Navy, Mr, Hunter was removed to the
Intrepid, under the command of Captain James Cranston,
then fitting at Plymouth for the East Indies, for which she
sailed in April, This distant voyage gave Mr. Hunter an
opportunity of extending his knowledge of pra&ical astro-
nomy, in the pursuit of which he was indefatigable, and
became a very useful assistant to his Captain, who was an
expert observer in the lunar method of ascertaining the
longitude; during his leisure- time on this service he con-
tinued to follow a rule which he had long laid down for.
himself, and which he considered an essential part of every
Sea Officer?s duty, viz. that of making himself thoroughly
acquainted with the pilotage into every port or anchorage to
which he had access.
In 1775, the Intrepid returned to England and was paid
off, in the same year he was appointed Master of the Kent, of
74 guns, at the particular desire of Captain Jervis (now Earl
St. Vincent), who was then appointed to the command of
that ship, and who heard of and recollefled his old ship-
mate. Ihe Kent proving defective, was soon put out of
commission, and in her stead the Foudroyant was com-
missioned for Captain Jervis, into which ship Mr. Hunter
was removed, where he continued until Lord Howe; was
appointed to command the fleet in America, in 1776; at this
period an event took place which strongly indicates how
high the subjeft of our memoir stood in general estimation :
some unknown friend having mentioned to his Lordship
that he considered Mr. Hunter as the most fit and proper
person he knew to accompany him as Master of . the Eagle,
the ship intended for the Admiral?s flag ; in consequence of
the charadler Lord Howe had received of Mr. Hunter, the
latter was favoured with a lettenfrom his Lordship, inviting
Jnm to sail in the Eagle, to which he replied, he should be
happy to have the honour of serving under his Lordship-?s
command. Believing at this time, that as Captain Jervis was
in London, he owed this recommendation to his kindness,
�aoU VI. 3 A


BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS
he wrote to him, expressing his obligation for the favom,
but was assured that he was unacquainted with the circum-
stance until he received the information from Mr. Hunter;
Captain Jervis, however, with his usual attention to men of
merit, did not fail to wait on Lord Howe, and added his
friendly offices to those of Mr. Hunter?s unknown patron.
During his employment in North America the field for the
exertion of every class of Officers was extensive, and in Mr.
Hunter?s line so various, that to be minute would far
exceed the limits we can allow for this memoir. The
variety of duties he had to attend, were executed in a man-
ner so creditable to his zeal and abilities, that they were
highly approved, not only by the Admiral and his Captain,
but his merit was acknowledged by all the Officers m the
fleet employed on that difficult and fatiguing service. At
the attack of Philadelphia, when the army got possession
of that place, it became necessary to open the communication
with the fleet, which could not then approach higher into
the river Delaware than Chester; such was the strength of
the different fortified banks of this river > the great key to
this communication was the island called Mud Island,
very strongly fortified, and so situated that ships of great
draught of water could not come near enough to ad with
advantage. In order to surmount this obstacle a ship
was cut down, and fourteen twenty-four pounders mounted
upon her. Mr. Hunter was employed in examining a
channel through which the Americans had never ventured
any thing but pilot boats; to this passage there was a bar j
Mr. Hunter?s skill, however, triumphed overall obstacles,
and although this perilous and difficult enterprize was
executed within musket shot of the enemy?s centinels, who
continually annoyed them, he succeeded in buoying the
Channel, carried the ship through, and on the day of
the attack of this island, she was laid within half a cable?s
length of the fort, and enfiladed the whole line of guns.
The result of this sanguinary and obstinate contest, during
which Mr. Hunter received a severe contusion on bis


OF CAPTAIN JOHN HUNTER, 3^9
shoulder that kept him lame for some time, Is sufficiently
known from the history of those times. Although this
objed was attained, there were many difficulties to contend
with before the desired jundion between the fleet and army
could be effeded. Mr. Hunter was now employed in
sounding and examining for a passage through the Cheveaux
de Frise, which had been sunk to obstrud the navigation of
the river ; he succeeded, and buoyed it in so able a manner
that Captain Hammond (now Sir A. S. Hammond, Comp-
troller of the Navy), in the Roebuck, and seventy sail of
transports, went through and up to Philadelphia in one
flood tide. Previous to this service Mr. Hunter was equally
useful and successful in his exertions while the fleet was
sailing up the Chesapeak to the River Elk; in short, the
services which Mr. Hunter performed in the fleet on the
American station so firmly fixed him in the good opinion
of Lord Howe, that he always, until the death of that
great and good man, enjoyed the honour of his friend,
ship and patronage. It was Mr. Hunter?s misfortune
his Lordship had always believed his objed was to become
the Master Attendant of a dock-yard, but his ambition was
promotion in the service ; his modesty, however, was such,
that conceiving the Admiral knew his wishes, he never
ventured to mention them himself, otherwise Lord Howe
was heard often to declare he would have promoted him
whilst the power was in his own hands. He returned to
England with his Lordship, and as the Eagle was soon
after ordered for the East Indies, he got superseded from her.
His patron, having struck his flag, retired to the country, and
Mr. Hunter applied to the Admiralty to be made a Lieu-
tenant, in which he could not succeed, although he pro-
duced a certificate from Lord Howe, which he might
reasonably have supposed would, without any other interest,
have procured promotion to a higher rank than that of
Lieutenant; such a testimony from so able a judge of
nautical merit, it was expeded would have carried much
weight with it. This certificate, after enumerating a variety


of particular services, amongst which was an account of
several of his Majesty?s ships which had been ran ashore
from either the ignorance or design of the different pilots ;
they were all, however, got off again by the judgment and
ability of Mr. Hunter ; some had their bottoms greatly
damaged 5 this is a part of his public services at that particular
period, which will be in the recolle&ion of most of the Captains
serving in America under Lord Howe. The certificate also
mentions that those, although some of the most conspicuous,
are not the only essential services performed by Mr. John
Hunter during the time he was under his command in
North America, a very considerable saving in the public
expences by a judicious management, conversion, and issue
of the condemned stores intrusted to his care, deserve
particular notice ; after some other observations, it concludes
by saying, ? that from his knowledge and experience in
all the branches of his profession, he is justly entitled to the
character of a distinguished Officer.? All this, though highly
flattering to Mr. Hunter, was of no other use to him at that
time. Several old Captains now applied to have him made
a Lieutenant into their respective ships, but ineffectually.
The Hon. Keith Stuart then invited him to embark as a
volunteer under his command in the Berwick ; to this gen-
tleman he was no otherwise known than by character ; he
accepted this obliging invitation, and was, during the cruise,
appointed, by Sir Charles Hardy, sixth Lieutenant of the
Union, and Captain Dalrymple wrote to the Admiralty for
his confirmation. Upon the return of the fleet to Spithead,
all whom the Admiral had appointed during the cruise were
confirmed, except Mr. Hunter. This circumstance appeared
so marked, that it was supposed to have proceeded from some
misunderstanding between the First Lord and Mr. Hunter?s
patron. His friend Captain Stuart was much vexed and
disappointed at this treatment, and desired that he would
continue as a volunteer with him, and that he had no doubt
of being able to obtain promotion for him. The Berwick
being soon after ordered as one of a squadron under the
4


or CAPTAIN JOHN HUNTER. 361
command of the Hon. Boyle Walsingham *, to reinforce the
fleet under Sir George Rodney in the West Indies ; he pro-
ceeded in that ship, and from this Admiral received a
Lieutenant?s commission for the Berwick ; when he went
to return his thanks to the Commander in Chief, Sir George
put him in mind that he had wished him to accept the
appointment of Master of the Sandwich with him when he
was ordered upon his present command (the Admiral did
before he left London send for Mr. Hunter and offered him
this appointment, which he declined, wishing to reserve him-
self for his patron Lord Howe), and that if he had accepted
it, he would probably have been a Captain at that time,
instead of now desiring a Lieutenant?s commission, but that
he much approved his reasons for having declined his offer,
and that he admired him for his attachment to his Admiral.
Mr. Hunter continued with his friend Captain Stuart,
during his stay in the West Indies, and was in that dread-
ful hurricane in 1780, when the squadron commanded
by Admiral Rowley suffered so severely ; the Thunderer
foundered, and the Stirling Castle was cast away; by the loss
of the Thunderer Mr. Hunter had to regret a very warm
friend, in Commodore Walsingham, with whom lie had
but lately made an acquaintance, and who took a par-
ticular interest in his advancement and welfare. In 1781,
the Berwick, from her sufferings in this hurricane, having
returned to England, Captain Stuart hoisted a broad
pendant, and commanded a small squadron cruising off the
islands of Shetland ; but was afterward direfted to join the
fleet under the orders of Admiral Hyde Parker, in the North
* It may not be improper here to mention, that such was the opinion Com-
modore Walsingham had of Mr. Hunter?s judgment, that whilst he lay wind-
bound in Torbay, Mr. Smeaton, the Civil Engineer, was sent by the Admiralty
to fix on a place for creating the means of watering a fleet here with expedition,
and the Commodore was instructed to furnish him with an Officer capable of
affording Mr. Smeaton the necessary information relative to what part of this
bay was most proper for such purpose. The Commodore immediately ordered Mr.
Hunter on this duty; and Mr. Smeaton, when he had finished his plan, thanked
the Commodore for the able assistant he had given him on that service.


.BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS
Sea, and who on the sth of August fell in with and engaged
the Dutch fleet on the Dogger Bank.
When Lord Howe hoisted his flag and took command
of the Grand Fleet in 1782, Mr. Hunter was appointed the
Admiral?s third Lieutenant; and at the time his Lordship
sailed to the relief of Gibraltar he had risen to be his First
Lieutenant, in the Viaory. Soon after this event an
took place between the combined fleets of France and Spam,
and the British squadron under the command of Lord Howe,
at the close of which, Lieutenant Hunter was promoted to
the rank of Master and Commander, and appointed to com-
mand the Spitfire fire-ship ; and on the arrival of the fleet
at Portsmouth, he was appointed by the Admiralty to the
command of the Marquis de Signally sloop of war. The
peace which took place shortly after this period, precluded
Captain Hunter from the attainment of further promotion;
but we find his friend and patron did not lose sight of him,
for in 1786, when ships were preparing to carry out coli-
cs and to establish a colony on the east coast of New
Holland (New South Wales), Captain Hunter was con-
sidered by Lord Howe, who then presided at the Admiralty
Board, as an Officer properly qualified for this distant and
difficult service ?, and he was appointed Second Captain
of the Sirius, under the command of Captain Arthur
Phillip, who was First Captain, and Governor of the
intended settlement. On this appointment Captain Hunter
received, by his Majesty?s command, the rank of Post
Captain Hunter had now accomplished the long wished-
forobiea of his ambition, and whoever will cast an eye
over the many and eventful scenes of his life, must acknow-
ledge, it was the just though long-protrafted reward due to
no ordinary talents, and no common perseverance; few
Officers who have attained the rank of Post Captain, have
had the opportunity of rendering so many and such im-
portant services to their country, and seldom has an mdi-

vtdual displayed greater zeal or more ability. Perhaps there
never was a more striking example of the utility of Sir
R. Estrange s maxim, IP'ait the seasons of Providence with
patience and perseverance in the duties of your calling , what
difficulties soever you may encounter , than in the ultimate suc-
cess of Captain Hunter after the various disappointments he
had to encounter.
As the history of the colony of New South Wales has
long been made public, it is not necessary to detail,any part
of it here, we shall only observe, that whilst Governor
Phillip was busily employed, on their landing in that
country, in establishing rules and regulations for that order
and discipline so necessary to be kept amongst such a set
of charaders as the settlement was composed of, Captain
Hunter employed himself in examining and taking a survey
of the extensive harbour of Port Jackson, in which Captain
Phillip had established the seat of government; and in
determining its exa& situation in latitude and longitude,
by a regular series of observations. On this service, the
distance from the mother country being so great, Govern-
ment had considered it proper to provide against accident,
from death or other cause, by sending out a dormant com-
mission, signed by his Majesty, in case of the government
falling vacant, and this commission was made out in the
name of Captain Hunter.
They landed at Port Jackson in January, 1788, and the
Governor ordered Captain Hunter to sail for the Cape of
Good Hope in the beginning of Oftober; this voyage he
performed round Cape Horn, returned from the Cape of
Good Hope with the ship full of such supplies as he had
been direded to purchase, and arrived on the Bth of May,
1789, at New South Wales: in this vovage he had com*

ing the voyage during the summer ; the pumps were, there-
fore, set to work, he persevered, and continued pumping
during the whole voyage. On their arrival at Port Jack-
son the ship underwent the necessary repairs, and in con-
quence of a probability of scarcity before supplies could
be obtained from England, the Governor came to the
resolution of sending a part of the inhabitants and military
to Norfolk Island * } thereby dividing, in case of any distress,
the natural resources of both places amongst the whole
inhabitants ; for this purpose the Sirius was immediately
prepared} in her were embarked a part of the military, and
as many convifts as she could take on board; she made her
passage to that island in one week, and immediately landed
the people, although, from the surf breaking upon the shore,
with much difficulty. Captain Hunter had no sooner ac-
complished the disembarkation of the people, than bad
weather came on, and before he could get the provisions
landed, he was blown from the island, but recovered it again
in three days, ran close into the bay, and began to send
provisions on shore by the ship?s boats ; at this unfortunate
jundure, the wind shifted and blew dead into the bay, the
Sirius could not weather either extremity, and the sea rifing
on this change of wind, occafioned the ship constantly to
miss stays, and it being a bed of rocks of very unequal
depths, she was forced nearer every tack, and was at length,
after every means for her safety had been used, driven on the
covered reefs, where her bottom was soon beat out. None
of the crew were lost, although all were dragged on shore
through a tremendous surf, and a few were landed ap-
parently dead, but were recovered by the surgeons. The
Supply brig being off the island at the time, carried part
of the crew to Port Jackson, and Captain Hunter, the
First Lieutenant, Master, and a few of the Midshipmen, with
about ninety seamen, were left on Norfolk Island, where
they remained eleven months, part of the time in great

?distress for want of food; as soon as the Governor had a
vessel in his power, he sent for them. The Supply had
ccn dispatched to Batavia to charter a vessel, and load
her with provisions for the colony; she arrived, and was
again chartered by the Governor to carry Captain Hunter,
his Officers, and crew to Europe, He sailed on his return
lome in this vessel in March, 1791, having on board what
was considered a sufficient stock of provisions for a run to
Batavia of sixteen weeks, and 125 people. He took his route
northward, it being the commencement of the winter, and
passed through the channel that was discovered by Captain
Carteret, in the Swallow, and which divides New Britain from
New Ireland; went through the Strait of Macassar, and
after a passage of twenty-six weeks, reached Batavia. The
vessel being foul sailed very ill, and they were unfortunately
troubled with tedious calms near the Line, and strong
easterly currents, which, with the shortness of their provi-
sions, occasioned their suffering much; they were compelled
to stop at two different islands in search of water, where
they were seriously attacked by the natives *. After receiving
such supplies as he required at Batavia, Captain Hunter
sailed through the Strait of Sunda, and touched at the Cape
of Good Hope and St. Helena ; he arrived at Portsmouth
in April, 1792, where the usual Court-Martial was held to
inquire into the cause of the loss of the si*ip.-Captain
Hunter, his Officers, and crew, were honourably acquitted.
In his Historical Journal of the proceedings in that "
Colony, published by Stockdale, in the beginning of 1793,
he, from his own observation in passing along a particular
part of that coast, has anticipated the existence of a strait
separating Vandieman?s Land from New Holland; during
his command in that colony he fitted out a small deckcd-
boat, put two very intelligent Officers on board her, gave
them written instruaions for their proceedings, and sent
them to explore this unknown part ; and they proved the.

truth of his conjeftures, by passing through this strait, and
completely circumnavigated Vandieman?s Land.
Soon after this, his friend and patron having taken the
command of the fleet, and hoisted his flag on board the
Queen Charlotte, Captain Hunter solicited permission to
serve in that ship as a volunteer ; in which situation he
continued until Governor Phillip?s ill-health occasioned
his resignation of the Government of New South Wales,
when Captain Hunter was appointed to succeed to the
Government of that distant colony, and sailed from England
in the beginning of 1795 > services there cannot be
detailed in this place, but we learn from those who have
lately visited the settlement, that its advancement to the
state of perfe&ion which it now exhibits, has been chiefly
owing to his endeavours. He was succeeded in the Govern-
ment of New South Wales by Captain King, and re-
turned to England in i�or.
Capt. Hunter?s travels into the interior of that immense
country, were, during his government, extensive and repeated ;
he considered it a material part of his duty to learn as much
as possible of the face of it, and to what extent it might be
possible to carry the cultivation of the land with advantage.
The Governor communicated from time to time his observa-
tions to the Secretary of State, and suggested many useful
regulations for reforming the various abuses and monopolies,
which were gaining ground in the colony, to its great
prejudice. We understand that it is the Governor?s inten-
tion to publish these useful observations, together with his
remarks on the causes of the colonial ex pence of the estab-
lishment of New South Wales, and the remedies proposed.
His suggestions for improving the police, the necessity
of revising and altering the legislative code, and appointing
a judge and council, changing the forms in the courts of
law, admitting the trial by jury, and establishing the
bankrupt laws, &c.: topics equally interesting and important,
which, while they pourtray the urbanity of Governor Hunter?s

ftund, they no lessdevelope the soundest principles of justice
and policy; and as such they will, no doubt, be duly
appreciated by the public.
The man whose comprehensive mind pervades and dire&s
the efforts of a rising colony, has a task to accomplish of
uncommon difficulty ; added to the perils and privations he
participates in common with others, he has a thousand
Vexations and anxieties, incident alone to his elevated station ;
Ins plans for the general good, perhaps, thwarted by the
avaricious views of individuals, and his mind harassed by
the perverseness of the unhappy beings whom he vainly
endeavours to render useful members of society ; nor when
his unremitting exertions have been crowned with success,
and the desert shore is changed into a flourishing settlement,
does the world always pay due acknowledgment to his efforts :
all are charmed with the beauties of the cultivated landscape,
. k ut few justly appreciate the merits, genius, and perseverance,
of him, who has converted the howling wilderness into the
scene they view with delight and admiration.
If in reviewing the life of Captain Hunter, we meet with
none of those dazzling achievements, which, like passing
meteors, astonish an admiring world, his persevering efforts,
more useful than brilliant, will command the? applause of
those best judges of naval merit, his brother Officers; and
a careful perusal of the events recorded in these me-
moirs, will excite emulation, and give encouragement to
those who are entering on their career.
To modest merit, struggling under similar difficulties, it
will afford matter of consolation to reflea, that men of equal
abilities have met with the same obstruaions, for, with
professional skill inferior to none, and acquired knowledge
which few Officers possess, Mr. Hunter, was twenty years
before he attained the rank of Lieutenant. And those who
are inclined to despond after a few years trial, may here find
an instance of the rewards that attend diligence and per-
severance.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF NAVAL HISTORY.
HAVING been favoured by a correspondent, with a
copy of the original Instructions for the regulation of
the Navy Board, issued by the Duke of York in 1661, we
presume so interesting a document will not be unacceptable
to our readers. Some general observations on the state of
the Navy at that period we have also inserted, from the same
authority, and propose adding to it the alterations in the
Administration of that department, lately introduced by
order of the King in Council.
IMMEDIATELY after the restoration. King Charles the Second
turned his attention to the Naval power, committing the charge of it
to his Royal Brother, James Duke of York, as Lord High Admiral
of England, who then caused the regulations after mentioned to be
drawn up, which have ever since been a standing rule to that office ;
and so perfect in themselves, that it has not been thought requisite
to alter them until very lately.
King Charles the Second soon advanced it to a much better con-
dition Ihan It had been in during the Usurpation; and in the two
]>utch wars sufficiently made It appear that those people could not
look the English in the face at sea, if these would but be true to
themselves: for, had not some men been more fond of that nation
than of their own, Holland would never have been able to lift up Its
head again. # .
the said wars the naval affairs were stdl so well carried on,
that in the year 1678 the Royal Navy was In a better state than had
ever before been known in England, for in four months time the king
could have fitted out eighty-three of his own ships of war and fire-
ships, completely furnished with six months sea stores ; and there
were adually in 1679, seventy-six of them in pay carrying 12,00 a
men. Besides, there were at that time thirty capital ships building,
which, if things could have been earned on in the same manner, would
have rendered the British marine power invincible.
But the confusions which ensued soon after that flourishing prospeft
put a stop to its progress. The Admiralty was put into the hands of
Commissioners, who, during their five years administration, suffered
all things to run to ruin, till the year 1684, King Charles having becu
made sensible of the behaviour of those Commissioners, took upon

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LXXVI.
r J ,HIS engraving is from an original drawing by Go-
vernor Hunter, and represents a quarrel that took
place between the natives of an island situated off the south
point of Mindanao, and the crew of the Waaksamkeyd trans-
port, on board of which were embarked the Officers and
company of his Majesty?s late ship Sirius. The vessel wore
Dutch colours, because the natives were known to be in the
interest of the Dutch, as appeared by the Rajah?s boat wear-
ing tne flag of that nation. Captain Hunter, who was on
board the Waaksamkeyd, describes the attack in the follow-
ing words
T.IE next day the Rajah again came on board, but, to our very
great disappointment, instead of the expefted supply, he produced
four small baskets of sago powder, and one bag of paddy * ; this return
for the civilities he received the day before was by no means a proper
one, particularly as I was told he had been given to understand, that
we were much in want of provisions, and he had been greatly pressed
for a quantity of paddy sufficient to serve two hundred men until we
reached Batavia, to which place he was told we were going, and
was also informed it should be paid for in bar iron. Our demand was
peu aps more that might have been necessary, but it was made large
rora an opinion that we might not get near the quantity applied for.
We had every reason to believe, that the island could well furnish the
supply we had demanded, without any inconvenience to the inhabit-
ants; for eight hundred weight of paddy had been purchased out of
a common boat the day before for a few pieces of bar iron, and the
natives appeared to make more use of sago and fruit than of paddy ;
the master of the vessel showed some displeasure, and I own (if he
iac made our wants well understood the day before, which I had my

time we had a boat and several people on shore; I recommended li
to him to endeavour to convince the Rajah, that unless the supp y
we asked, and which he had promised, was sent for, that a complaint
would be made to the Governor and Council at Batavia, who won
certainly take notice of it; I thought a threat of this sort would
answer our purpose better than the means he proposed ; for we wcie
in no respeft prepared for a quarrel with these people, who were all
armed, and the decks were at this time full of them; many of om
people were also upon deck, but wholly unarmed and off then
gU The master of the ship again entered into conversation with the
Rajah, who was on the after-part of the quarter-deck, what ne said 1
did not understand; however I joined them, and again recommen e
prudence and moderation to the master of the ship, and desired ie
would recoiled that we were not prepared for such violent measmes
as he seemed inconsiderately disposed to , that, as there were a fc*
stands of arms in the ship, and a few pan of pistol, among the Officers,
they should have been upon deck and people stationed with ammuni-
tion for them ; instead of which we had not one armed man upon
deck, nor a single necessary for using the carnage-guns, ah wo,eh
rested with him, such articles being in his care, notwithatai. mg
which, the violence and perverseness of his temper was such as to dis-
pose him (probably because he was advised to the contrary), to create
a disagreement between the people of the island, who were all armed,
and our crew, who were defenceless. Some of the islanders paid much
attention to the nature and extent of our force, and shrewdly ob-
served, that the great guns were very good at a distance, but of no
use when boats got alongside of the ship; if they had any fear of us,
it proceeded from our numbers, which amounted to one hundred and
twenty, and when all upon deck in this small vessel, appeared still
more numerous. _
During the conversation between the Rajah and the master or the
ship, our people were employed in hoisting the long-boat in, at which
the Rajah seemed much agitated, and at this juncture the master
having ordered some cutlasses upon deck, they were Imprudently laid
down upon the quarter-deck. In the presence of the Rajah and his
attendants; this conduct confirmed me in the opinion I already enter-
tained, that he had made use of some threats, which rendered such
preparations necessary ; be that as it might, the Rajah was alarmed
for his liberty, his people also took the alarm, and called their com j
panions from their boats, who boarded us with drawn daggers ; an
old man, about seventy years of age, who stood near the Rajah, and

keld him by the sleeve, drew his dagger, and in a great rage endea-
voured to reach and stab the master of the ship, but was held back
by the Rajah ; on this the master snatched up a hanger to defend him-
self, and with great vehemence called for the small arms.
I was close to him at the time, and however much I disapproved
of his general conduct (which was certainly, in our unguarded situa-
tion, destitute of thought, common sense, or discretion, and was the
effed of one of the most perverse and diabolical tempers 1 ever met
with), I judged it necessary to draw my sword and defend him ; he
continued to call for small arms with much agitation, which should
have been previously prepared. A number of the Sirius?s people
being on the forepart of the deck, trading with the natives (a con-
siderable number of whom were on board, and who all drew their
cresses upon the alarm given by their countrymen), armed themselves
with handspikes, billets of wood, or whatever came' to hafid, while
the petty officers got up the small arms, and kept up a smart fire on
the natives, who were in a short time driven overboard, some into
their boats, and others were obliged to take to the water ; the Rajah,
during the scufile, tumbled himself from the gunwale into his boat, ac-
companied by his faithful attendants, who certainly did themselves much
honour by their exertions in his defence. If I had been prepared
with my loaded pistols, as I was on the Rajah?s first visit, I should
certainly have shot the old man before mentioned, although I am sure,
that upon a little serious cefledion, and consideration of the motive of
Ins condud, I should have exceedingly regretted having done so ; he
certainly in some respeds occasioned the disturbance (although it
ongmated with the master of the shfp), but it was in consequence of
an indignity offered to the person of his sovereign in his presence :
we should, therefore, be more disposed to commend than condemn
bis condud ; the insult was too much for a loyal and affedionate
subjed to bear, he therefore preferred certain death in his defence, to
seeing him so degraded.
As soon as the Rajah and his people were in the boat they cut the
rope wuic.i held them, and pulled from the ship with the greatest
pi capital:on ; many were killed in their boats, which (now this affair
had arrived at such height), became really necessary, to prevent their
rallying and reboardmg the ship; for after they had got into their
boats, many lances were thrown into the ship, which occasioned the
fire of musquetry to be kept up sometime longer than , it otherwise
would have been.
I saw the Rajah pulling at an oar himself, and did every thing in
power to pi event his being shot; for as every person knew him

by his dress, It was probable that he might be particularly marked ; I
much fear he was wounded, perhaps mortally, notwithstanding my
endeavours to save him, as he dropped his oar several times. During
the short time which I had been in his company, I was much pleased
with him ; there was a certain graceful ease and affability In his man-
mer that was highly prepossessing, and a degree of dignity which
bespoke him of superior rank : he appeared to be about forty-three
or forty-four years of age.
In this unlucky rencontre, we were so fortunate as not to have a man
wounded, which was rather extraordinary, and, I believe, must have
been owing to the panic occasioned by so sudden and unexpe&ed an
alarm.
