GENIUS, LUNACY, AND KNAVERY.
CHAPTER I.
4 ? Of learned and accomplished Jews he took it for granted that they had dropped their
religion, and wished to be merged in the people of their native lands; but the
indiscriminate scorn of a race will often strike a specimen who has well earned it
on his own account, and might fairly be gibbeted as a rascally son of Adam."
George Eliot : Daniel Dercnda.
In the eventful year 1814, in a small town in Russia,
the wife of an orthodox Jew gave birth to a male child,
who received, eight days after, the name of David. At
three years of age the boy could already read Hebrew
with fluency, and translate the Pentateuch into the
German j'argon spoken by the Jews of Poland, and was
a good scholar long before he had reached his twelfth
year. However, Hebrew was the only language which
he knew thoroughly. He could translate any part of
the 24 books of the Old Testament, and his father, con-
sidering that he had made sufficient progress in that
ancient language, thought it desirable for him to devote
himself to other studies. The study of the classics,
modern languages, or science was considered a profane


pursuit, and therefore sinful. But he was to make him-
self conversant with the Talmud?a compendium of
reports of the proceedings of the renowned literary
assemblies of Pum-Beditha, Sura, and other places, and
as in those days Pitman was unknown, the reports are
necessarily somewhat confused. Theology, philosophy,
astronomy, medicine, mathematics, physics, historical
facts and fiction are all mixed up together. He was to
make himself acquainted with the disputes of Hillcl and
Shaviai; whether an egg laid on a Jewish festival might
be used for food that day? whether a woman?s spoiling
her husband?s soup was a sufficient reason for divorcing
her? and other similar questions, the knowledge of which
is considered amongst the Jews, of great importance to
their spiritual well-being.
When David had reached his fourteenth year, his fame
as a Talmudical scholar was widely circulated, and he
was considered a paragon of learning for his years ?in
short, a perfect genius. Though of obscure origin?his
father being very poor and ignorant, and having nothing
else to entitle him to be called an orthodox Jew except
his unkempt locks and dirty S/tuberse, which looked as
if all the dust in the valley of Jehoshaphat had been
gathered on it; yet Mr. Kocheloeffel, the professional
matchmaker, thought it worth his trouble to negotiate
with the father about an advantageous marriage for the
learned youth?stipulating to receive a commission of
5 per cent, from the bride?s dowry.
Mr. Hailprin?for such was the man?s patronymic.


since the Emperor of all the Russias had issued an
ukase that all the Jews in his dominions should in future
not call themselves, as David's father did, Mordecai the
son of Nehcmiah, but adopt some family name?kept
Mr. Kochclocffel?s proposal secret even from his own
wife; it just having been made during that period in
which all communication between husband and wife is
suspended.
There was no difficulty for Kochelocffel to discover
a rich Jew with a marriageable daughter willing to give
a goodly sum of money, and several years of board and
lodging to a youth well-versed in the Talmud; for he
had heard that Mosheh Goldstein, who had amassed an
immense fortune by lending money at the rate of cent,
per cent, to officers in the army and members of the
civil service, offered 10,000 roubles and three years?
maintenance, besides a magnificent trousseau , as the
dowry of his eldest daughter Rachel, who had just
reached her 13th year. Kochelocffel brought the fathers
together, and arrangements were made for testing David s
knowledge; the examination to be held at the Beth-
Hamidrash , adjoining the chief Rabbi?s house.
All the shining lights in Rabbinical lore, the Hebrew
literati of Revel?for that was the name of the town
where David was born?were assembled at the house
of learning. All who were present, each in his turn
endeavoured to puzzle the youth, who maintained his
position and came out creditably from an examination
which lasted eight hours. The people were astonished


at the boy?s intellect, and satisfied with his proficiency
in the Talmud. They congratulated both fathers;
Goldstein on his extraordinary piece of luck in securing
such a husband for his daughter, a youth who at the
age of 14 could not be puzzled by the greatest scholars
of the town, and who promised to be the greatest man
of the age; perhaps another Gaon ! and Hailprin they?
congratulated on the pecuniary advantages of the match.
The party then adjourned to the Rabbi?s house, where
a splendid repast awaited them, and the first contract
was drawn up and signed by both parents, in the
presence of witnesses, and in accordance with the law
of the Jews. The conditions were enumerated, and the
parties bound themselves to pay a certain fine in case of
one of them withdrawing from the agreement without
mutual consent. Hailprin, of course, made his son
acquainted with the fact, that he was going to get the
rich Goldstein?s daughter for his wife, and gave him the
document to peruse, to the provisions of which he gave
his full consent without a moment?s deliberation, without
even asking what his intended was like. The youth
thought women were created for a certain purpose?
they were all God?s creatures, and therefore all alike.
He knew nothing of Goethe?s or Byron?s women, and
had not, as yet, formed for himself any standard of
beauty.
Three weeks after the signing of the first agreement,
a party was given at the house of the bride?s father, to
which all the friends and relatives of the Goldsteins and


Hailprins were invited. The men, with the bridegroom,
enjoyed themselves in the large front room ; listening,
whilst over their bottle, to a dissertation prepared by
David for the occasion on ? a needle that was found in
the gizzard of a goose, ? a matter of great dispute
amongst the Rabbis.
And it may as well be advisable to inform the reader
that the dispute was not whether the goose was Kosher ,
for that had been settled long before by the Chief Rabbi,
who forbade it to be eaten. But the dispute now was,
whether the pot in which the forbidden fowl had been
boiled, and the plates in which it was served, were defiled,
and therefore not to be used ; the needle having been
discovered after the first course.
In another room, the door of which opened into the
parlour, were crowded together the female relatives and
friends of the bride, passing their time tracing the
genealogical tree of their families, sipping brandy, and
dilating on the qualities of the bridegroom, of whom
they now and then caught a glimpse through the open
door.
The second agreement was drawn up, fixing the day
of marriage on the first Wednesday after the new moon ,
and Kocheloeflfel, the matchmaker, whose ingenuity had
wedded wealth .to learning, received his commission
before the document was signed.
The trousseau was ready, the cakes baked, hundreds
of geese and turkeys killed by Rabbi Shochet, who took
great pains in examining their gizzards. The wedding


day arrived, on which solemn occasion David and
Rachel fasted, like so many millions of other Jewish
couples had done before them, and no doubt will con-
tinue to do so until ?
The Jewish inhabitants of Revel said shorter prayers
than on other days ; the affair being? considered one of
general moment to the community, for everyone, rich
and poor, was invited to the wedding. The rich were to
feast with the rich, and the poor were invited to a repast
which was to take place a day after.
In the afternoon, the friends of the bride attended her,
helping her to dress and prepare for the important
ceremony which was about to take place. She was
attired in a beautiful white satin dress, which contrasted
with her long trailing tresses, and set off to advantage
her exquisitely formed figure, that an artist might have
envied as a model of Hebrew grace and beauty. She
was seated on a footstool in the middle of a large room,
and Rabbi Marshcleck the town jester?accompanied by
a band of music, conducted by Mr. Klesmer, who had
arrived by that time?commenced the preliminary
business. The band struck up a Mazurka, whilst the
jester was thinking out some extempore rhymes, which
he was soon to recite before the audience.
There, standing over the beautiful girl, who, with her
hands over her face, sat surrounded by all her friends
and relatives, he poured forth some rude strains hastily
strung together, which he sang, accompanied by the
music, on the change in her condition, reminding her of


innumerable laws and ceremonies, and the duties of a
wife. His language was couched in ambiguous phrases,
with a mixture of jest and earnest, very often bordering
on the indecent, which threw the bride into hysterics,
and the spectators into convulsive fits of laughter. In
the intervals the Schnapps bottle replenished the ex-
hausted intellect of the jester, and when in full steam,
his jokes were such as would not be tolerated in the
presence of any modest woman, but were greatly appre-
ciated on this occasion, as -it always is at Jewish weddings
in Russia and Poland, when even virtuous women of
Israel listen, with the greatest delight, to language con-
demned by polite society outside the dominions of the
Czar.
However, all that had taken place till now was
nothing compared with the second act of the serio-
comic performance which followed, when the barber
arrived on the scene with scissors and razor to cut off
the girl?s beautiful black tresses and shave her head.
Her hair, with which perhaps some French or English
lady of fashion ornamented her head dress a few months
after, the jester took as part of the remuneration for his
services, and sold it the next day to a Leipzig merchant.
The poor girl cried bitterly till she was quite exhausted,
and knew little what was going on round her. And no
wonder she did cry! What would an Australian maiden
do if she had her hair ?woman?s chief ornament ?forcibly
cut off on her wedding day ? There is only one scene
in history which might have been as pitiful to behold?


the cutting of Marie Antoinette?s hair at the scaffold
before she was beheaded. However, it was the law (?)
of Moses which ordained it, and it had to be done.
? Woman?s hair (like her voice) is an abomination,? say
the Rabbis, and therefore it must be cut off, and the
head covered with a silk or velvet band.
It was now seven o?clock in the evening, and the male
relatives of the bride moved in procession through the
streets, in the direction of the residence of the bride-
groom, who had passed the day in conversing with his
friends, and receiving hints from elderly persons how to
behave in his married state. The procession was headed
by a band of music, the beadles of the Synagogue and
other paid assistants, who carried coloured paper lan-
terns, and the jester dancing and singing all the way
before them.
Arrived at the bridegroom?s house, the jester delivered
an oration, which consisted of Talmudical subtleties,
bans mots , anecdotes, familiar sayings and proverbs in-
geniously strung together, bearing on the subject of
marriage. The bridegroom was taken under the arms
by both fathers, accompanied by the ecclesiastical
dignitaries, and was led to the bride?s house. The mag-
nificent silk canopy, under which for generations past
the Jews of Revel had been married, was in readiness,
borne by four youths, waiting to conduct David and
Rachel under it on their way to the Synagogue, where
the marriage ceremony was to take place.
After a great deal of crying and lamenting, the jester


(who, be it known, is the factotum on such occasions)
succeeded in tearing away the bride from her female
friends, and the procession commenced to move in the
direction of the Synagugue.
The bridegroom was dressed in a beautiful silk
Shuberze which reached down to his ancles, a large
woollen Talith , ornamented with stripes of silver lace of
splendid workmanship, which had specially been im-
ported from Leipzig, over which he wore a Kittcl of
snow white linen, a garment in which Jews are married
and buried, and which serves as a kind of reminder on
that solemn occasion, that in the midst of life we are in
death.
The bride?s costume, which we have already described,
was supplemented by a long and thick veil, and, so the
pair, with heads hanging down, looking more like con-
demned criminals led to the scaffold, than a couple
about to enter matrimonial bonds, were conducted
through the streets, surrounded by their merry friends
and relatives.
At the synagogue the crowd of spectators, which had
been waiting for some time, was so great that the
procession had to elbow its way up to the ark of the
law.
Every Polish Jew is, more or less, a practical joker;
and on such occasions the most unbounded license is
extended to them. David had to submit to the usual
torture which bridegrooms undergo on the celebration of
the nuptial rites?of having needles and pins thrust into


the softest portion of their bodies, a joke on which
Theodore Hook could scarcely have improved.
At last, the ceremony began; the Rabbi read the
Kcthubah , or marriage contract, in which the husband
binds himself to feed and clothe his wife, and bestow
on her his conjugal affections, according to his social
standing, as specified in the Talmud; and in case of a
divorce to give her 200 silverlings (about The
bridegroom then passed the wedding ring on the middle
finger of the bride?s left hand, and pronounced in a loud
voice the usual formula, ?You arc made sacred to me by
this ring, according to the law of Moses and the people
of Israel.? A glass was broken, and the precentor pro-
nounced, over a goblet of wine made by Jewish hands,
the usual seven blessings; after which came the congra-
tulations, and the whole party betook themselves to the
house of the bride?s father, where the newly-married
couple were shown into a private room, and left alone,
to partake of a special repast prepared for them.
Readers of the Talmud will remember that, through a
cock and a hen, Tur Malka , a wealthy Jewish city was
destroyed. And this ought to have been a lesson to
Israel. Nevertheless, the custom of boiling a cock and
a hen together in one pot, as a sign of unity, was
observed on this occasion, the broth of which, termed
the ?golden soup? was served to them. During the
meal, not a single word passed between them; and as
soon as it was over, the males brought away the bride-
groom, and the females took the bride to the ladies?


room. There was dancing, but only amongst the ladies,
as it is considered a great sin to dance with the opposite
sex. The men, in rooms from which the women were
excluded, enjoyed themselves with eating choice morsels,
and drinking excellent liquors.
Thus the hours of the night passed, and it was not till
four o?clock in the morning that the chief Rabbi, fol-
lowed by his faithful guard of saints, made his appear-
ance in the ball-room, to go through with the bride the
?compulsory dance.? T.he bride holding one end of a
pocket-handkerchief, the Rabbi the other, and going
through some steps, whilst the bystanders clapped their
hands, and sang, in Hebrew, ? Beautiful and virtuous
bride.? And immediately after the sudden disappearance
of the couple, the rejoicings were brought to an end ;
and so, also, must the writer of this true story baulk the
reader of that which followed, by dropping the curtain
of modesty over it.


CHAPTER 11.
? There had sprung up almost innumerable modes of * searching the Scriptures.? In the
quaintly ingenious manner of the times, four of the chief methods were found in the
Persian word Paradise, spelt in vowelless Semitic fashion P.R.D.S. Each one of
these mysterious letters was taken, mnemonically, as the initial of some technical
word that indicated one of these four methods. The one called P. (peshat) aimed
at the simple understanding of words and things, in accordance with the primary
exegetical law of the Talmud, ?That no verse of the Scripture ever practically
travelled beyond its literal meaning,? though it might be explained, homiletically
and otherwise, in innumerable new ways. The second, R. <ramas), means hint,
i.t., the discoveries of the indications contained in certain seemingly superfluous
letters and signs in Scripture. These were taken to refer to laws not distinctly
mentioned, but either existing traditionally or newly promulgated. This method,
when more generally applied, begot a kind of memoria teehnica , a stenography
akin to the ?Notarikon? of the Romans. Hints and notes were added to the
margin of Scriptural MSS., and the foundation of the Massorah, or diplomatic
preservation of the text, was thus laid. The third, D. (derush), was homiletic
application of that which had been to that which was and would be, of prophetical
and historical dicta to the actual conditions of things. It was a peculiar kind of
sermon, with all the aids of dialectics and poetry, cf parable, gnoma, proverb,
legend, and the rest, exactly as we find it in the New Testament. The fourth,
S., stoodfor sod, secret, mystery. This was the secret science into which but few
were initiated. It was theosophy, metaphysics, angelology, a host of wild and
glowing visions of things beyond earth. Faint echoes of this science survive in
neoplatonism, in gnosticism, in (he Cabalah, in ? Hermes Trismegistus.'**
Emanuel Deutsch : Literary Remains.
The seven days? festivities were over, and David, the
married man, had taken up his residence with his father-
in-law, where he passed his time in study, making him-
self a proficient scholar ; and after spending his thirty-six
honeymoons he received an appointment as successor to
the late Chief Rabbi of Revel, a very enviable position,
especially for a youth of seventeen. In his official
capacity he acquired a great knowledge of human


nature, and showed great judgment and remarkable
skill in the administration of justice and the settling of
disputes amongst his co-religionists, who very seldom
avail themselves of the law of the country.
His mind, which had now expanded, could scarcely
fail to think for itself about religion. He turned his
thoughts upon the great problems of life and futurity.
In his leisure hours the Cabalah was his favoured study,
and he became a great believer in it, as being the means
by which to solve those problems.
He hoped, on reaching the forty-ninth degree of that
science, to have the esoteric workings of the cosmos
laid open to him; when he would be enabled, by using
cabalistic signs, to converse with angels, and order them
to perform at his will any service he might require ; for
instance, such as the bringing of messages from the other
world, curing the sick, the performing of miracles, and,
above all, to compel the Messiah to come and deliver
Israel from bondage and lead them back to Jerusalem.
The Messiah and Jerusalem now became the dream
of his life. He wedded himself heart and soul to the
Cabalah, neglected his official duties, and resigned his
office ; making preparations to leave his native place.
His wife, who preferred staying at home with an affec-
tionate mother to following a husband for whom she
had not as yet conceived any real love, he divorced, and
sought consolation in his new mistress, the Cabalah.
On his way to the East he was well received by the
Rabbis of Germany and Austria, and the elect in Jeru-


salem hailed him as the deliverer of Israel, and in a
very short time his fame was spread throughout the
whole of Jewdcndom.
After several years? residence in Palestine, his divorced
wife?s dowry having been nearly spent, and being as
yet in the Cabalah many degrees below the 49th, he
decided to return to Europe to accept at Bucharest the
very lucrative position of chief Rabbi of the Danubian
Principalities.


CHAPTER 111.
*' The Jews, the leading intellects of the world, were, under the Saracen rule, treated
with the highest consideration. They became distinguished for their wealth and
their learning. For the most part they were Aristotelians. They founded many
schools and colleges. Their mercantile interests led them to travel all over the
world. They particularly studied the science of medicine. Throughout the
middle ages they were the physicians and bankers of Europe. Of all men they
saw the course of human affairs from the most elevated point of view. Among the
special sciences, they became proficient in mathematics and astronomy ; they
composed the tables of Alfonso, and were the cause of the voyage of De Gama.
They distinguished themselves greatly in light literature. From the tenth to the
fourteenth century their literature was the first in Europe. They were to be found
in the courts of princes as physicians, or as treasurers, managing the public
finances.?
Prof. Draper : The conflict hetxueen Religion and Science.
WHILST at Jerusalem Hailprin had mastered the Arabic
language, and studied the works of Averrhocs and other
Arabic philosophers. Maimonides, however, was his
favourite author. He had made himself acquainted
with the life of this extraordinary man ; one of those
Jews, as Professor Draper tells us, ?who replenished
and kept the lamp of philosophy burning during the
dark ages, which they handed down to us, and without
whom it would have been extinguished.?
He formed a great desire to follow the footsteps oi
the great Maimonides, ? the Eagle of the Doctors, the
Great Sage, the Glory of the West, the Light of the
East, second only to Moses,? and strove to imitate his
career. Moses Maimonides was a Jew, so was he.
Hebrew, the Talmud, the Cabalah and Arabic philo-


Sophy, he also had mastered, like his prototype. But
Maimonides was a physician, and commenced the study
of medicine very early in life, whilst he had already
reached his 23rd year, without having acquired so much
as the Alpha Beth of that science. But what cannot a
man achieve if he set to work with a strong will? Not
knowing any of the European languages, he studied the
works of Avicenna, Abulcasis, Avenzoar, Avcrrhoes,
and translations from Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen,
Paracelsus and others, and in the 29th year of his life
he graduated, and received his diploma as doctor of
medicine from the Turkish University of Galatascrai.
The chief Rabbi of Bucharest now applied himself to
cure the maladies of suffering humanity, and was proud
of his calling. But the Moldavian Jews, a bigoted and
superstitious race, who knew nothing of the many years
of hard study, were greatly surprised to hear that he
suddenly became a physician, and was effecting marvel-
lous cures. There was only one explanation for it. It
was known that the Rabbi was a diligent student of the
Cabalah, and that was sufficient to account for it; and
as he no more wished to be styled Rabbi, but delighted
in the modern appellation of Doctor, it was evident that
he practised the black art. There were murmurs and
conspiracies against him in the camp of Israel. They
were afraid to dismiss him, lest he should revenge
himself on them, but they shunned his company and
absented themselves from the Synagogue, and on a
certain Sabbath morning he found himself alone, and


*
had not, like the Dean of St. Patrick, even a dearly
beloved Roger with him.
The Doctor soon discovered the cause of his flock?s
desertion, and knowing the character of the orthodox
Jews, that argument would be useless with them, he
resigned his position and went to Jerusalem, where he
intended to practise as a physician. However, bad
report preceded him, and like a Nemesis followed him
even unto the wall of the Temple, where he was
anathematized by the Rabbis. He left Jerusalem, and
reached Vienna, thinking to find there rest for his weary
soul, but was again prevented from following his
profession. This time, however, not by his persecuting
brethren, but by the authorities of the State and the
medical faculty, who held a degree from the University
of Galataserai, in no higher esteem than the English
that of Salamanca in the times of Titus Oates. And it
would have been a disgrace indeed to the medical
profession to allow such a man to practise in the capital
of Austria, putting him on an equality with the greatest
physicians of the age. They knew that the means of
acquiring an adequate knowledge of modern medical
science are altogether wanting in the East, yet this docs
not prevent any individual, high or low, rich or poor,
learned or unlearned, from setting up as a practitioner
at any moment.


CHAPTER IV.
Question not, but live and labour.
Till yon goal be won,
Helping every feeble neighbour,
Seeking help from none.?
A. L. Gordon : Ve Wrarit Wayfarer.
Bv this time his exchequer was in no flourishing con-
dition. Shunned by the Jews, without friends, lie found
himself suddenly in a strange land, without even the
barest means of subsistence, yet proud, and scorning
the idea of receiving charity. In the days when fortune
smiled on him, his hand was always open to those who
applied for relief. And people who are used to give,
will rather starve than receive alms. Yet, live he
must! and what could he do ? There was one source
left to him, of which he might avail himself, and drive
away the wolf from the door. He had a name for
being deeply read in the art of magic, of which the
Jews in Vienna had been informed by some messen-
gers from Jerusalem, who visit their Western brethren
regularly to collect alms for the poor in Palestine.
Numerous applications, with good fees, poured in from
superstitious Jews and Christians. Some asked the
Doctor to reveal to them future events; others wished
him to cure their mad relatives, whom they believed
to be possessed by evil spirits, and hundreds of other
odd and whimsical demands were made of him.


For a time he refused to listen to their solicitations,
and sent back the tempting fees; but, pressed hard by
necessity one day, he accepted a fee of 50 gulden, forced
on him by a rich lady for a cure which he had per-
formed?not by magic, but by medicine. However, s/u'
would not believe that her recovery was due to medical
skill, but spread the report that she had been cured by
supernatural means.
Ce u'cst que Ic premier pas qui cotlte! Many were
those who now consulted him, and to whose solicitations
he no longer was deaf, especially as they were accom-
panied by large fees. Money showered in on him from
all directions. Besides that, he now won, regularly
every week, small sums in the Austrian Lotto. He
took from the rich, and gave away to the poor, and his
fame as a benevolent and powerful magician became
established; and, by the halo of mystery with which he
surrounded himself, together with his liberality towards
the poor, he exacted respect even from the orthodox
who might have been inclined to injure him.
However, this prosperity was only transient. At that
time, the ? Judcn Bureau" existed in Vienna, at which
office all Jew?s had to report themselves, once a week,
like ticket-of-leave men in England, and were, according
to the police regulations, not allowed to remain in the
capital longer than a certain time, and he, like the rest of
his co-religionists, was obliged, after a sojourn of tw'elve
months, to leave the town. He travelled through Ger-
many, ett grand seigneur, and finally took up his residence


in Hamburg, where he chanced to win the highest lot
(250,000 marks) in the Lottery. It is said that he fore-
told the winning number, which he secured for himself;
and this was, to the credulous, another proof of his
magic powers.
Whether he won by witchcraft or good luck, anyhow
he was now a rich and independent man. He bought a
magnificent mansion, which he always kept open to the
poor foreigners who pass Hamburg on their way to
England or America. He especially delighted in con-
versing with Poles and Russians who had received a
Talmudical education, and as a rule they? obtained more
attention and charity from him than the uneducated who
sought his assistance.
Those who have known him in Hamburg describe him
as having been a very? handsome man. He was of tall
stature, a figure as the father of Frederick the Great
would have coveted for his chosen regiment of grenadiers;
with a high and intelligent forehead, beautifully-shaped
features, a pure Grecian nose, and a beard which was
considered the finest in Hamburg. He exercised great
influence on all with whom he came in contact, and
exacted a show of respect even from his co-religionists.
The man had money; he was charitable, and was
learned, and so became a favourite with the people.
The Jews of Hamburg were always better educated
than their brethren in other parts of Europe, and so
they took a liberal view of his case, though they were
well acquainted with his antecedents.


For some time he lived on his capital, which gradually
melted down to one-half the sum he had so luckily won
in the Lottery. Accustomed to live surrounded by
splendour, he wished to secure it for the rest of his
days. He accordingly commenced business, took large
premises, and insured the fictitious stock for enormous
sums in different English Fire Insurance Companies, A
fire broke out in his store soon after, which spread
quickly, and laid the half of Hamburg in ashes. Was
he an incendiary ? No one could tell. However the
English Insurance Companies disputed his claims;
suspecting, no doubt, that he himself set fire to his store.
He went to London and instituted a law suit against
the companies which lasted many years, and which at
length was decided against him. Many a man thus
begins the voyage of life with scrupulous sensibilities,
and ends it a rogue.


CHAPTER V.
For a man to be looked upon as a good Jew, he must conform to the ritual of hi
people. *
/*. M . G. : The yctvisk Liturgy.
The English Jews are not Talmudical scholars, and at
that time even the knowledge of Biblical Hebrew was
confined to a few foreigners who settled down in England.
from the time that the Jews were re-admitted into
England down to the present day, they had not even
one native chief Rabbi. And it is only within the last
25 years that a few Englishmen have been called to the
ministry. Consequently any foreigner who came to
England, and possessed some knowledge of Hebrew,
was sure of being well received. Besides, as a rule,
England was always favoured with the visits of poor
foreign scholars, and never with an independent man
like Hailprin, His reception was therefore more cordial
than usual, and even the chief Rabbi, Dr. Adler, paid
him great respect, before his antecedents were known.
He was spoken of as the greatest living Hebrew scholar,
and made a great figure in the English metropolis.
He was charitable to the last. On Fridays hundreds
of poor Jews were thronging at his door, of whom not
one went away without receiving something.
One of the rooms in his house, in Berry-street, he had
converted into a Synagogue, which was daily visited by


Polish Jews. He himself acted as precentor, and pleased
his audience with the strains of his melodious voice. He
read the Law to them on Sabbaths and festivals, and
lectured on his favourite topic?the Messiah.
The dream of his early life?the coming of the
Messiah and the deliverance of Jerusalem ?seem to have
outlived all his troubles. If the manuscripts found after
his death, in which he set forth his wild theory, are at
all an indication of the man?s mind, he was no doubt an
enthusiast about the return of the Jews to Palestine. In
his Synagogue he proved to the satisfaction of his
audiences, from numerous passages in the Bible, that
the English people would be the means of restoring
Jerusalem to the Jews ?an idea which was entertained by
many great men of the time.
It was during the Crimean war, that he gathered
round him all the foreign Jews in London to whom he
lectured on the restoration of Israel, and organized a
? Messiah Society,? whose members paid a weekly
subscription, according to their means, and not less than
sixpence. This, together with the fees which he received
for fortune telling, and the curing of diseases, was a
source of good income to him, and enabled him to keep
up his position.
If anything was stolen, the victim, instead of giving
information to the police, would rather consult the
omniscient Doctor. Was anyone afflicted with insanity,
instead of sending the patient to Bedlam, the magician
was implored to exorcise the evil spirit ; and many are


the stories told of the wonders wrought by' his magical
powers. A coat was once stolen from the shop of a
second-hand clothes dealer. The owner went to the
Doctor to inquire who the thief was. Hailprin told him
to hang another coat on the same place from which the
first was taken and watch until it should be stolen, and
whoever turned out to be the thief of the second coat,
also stole the first. A week after, a well-known shop-
lifter was caught by' the dealer in the act of stealing the
second coat. The effect which it produced on the cre-
dulous may be easily' imagined. Even amongst the
non-Jewish population of the East end of London the
fame of Hailprin as a magician was well-known, and he
received many a Christian guinea for services rendered
by him.
A butcher?s wife in Whitechapel, who had some
jewellery stolen, applied to him for information, after the
detectives had failed to discover the thief. The Doctor
took great pains to restore to the beautiful daughter of
Erin her stolen jewels which she prized so much. It is
said that he showed her by means of a magic mirror in
a room from which all light was excluded, the guilty?
person, who was just about to sell them to a dealer,
whom she recognized as one of her late servants, and
had her arrested. Hundreds of similar strange and
even stranger stories arc related of him during his stay
in London.
An old man living in Melbourne at present, who
knew him in London, told me that he was once at the


Doctor?s house, and, having expressed some doubt as to
his magical powers, was told by Hailprin that he would
soon convince him ; and helving indicated his willingness,
the Rabbi commenced operations. Ihe man was nearly
frightened out of his wits by the strange noise and the
appearance of hands a la Davenport, although nobody
else was in the room besides himself and the Doctor.
Up to that time (i860) Hailprin was orthodox. He
dressed in the Polish costume, wore a long beard and
locks, which according to the law of Moses must neither
be cut nor shaven ; ate food only prepared by Jews ?in
short, conformed to the rites and ceremonies as laid
down by the Rabbis.
Suddenly the Jews lost sight of him, and did not
know his whereabouts. One Fridayin the year
iB6O, one of his former greatest admirers had some
business on board of a vessel which was to sail that day
for Australia. He thought he knew the fine tall gentle-
man seated on the deck, near a beautiful lady. It was
Dr. Hailprin ! He had exchanged his shuberze for the
fashionable London cut. His beard and locks he had
trusted to the scissors and razor of a Gentile barber,
who had no religious scruples. He was altogether
a changed man, both in religion and appearance!
But who was the lady ? Ah, well! Credula res amor
est, it was the butcher?s wife?she believed in him and,
like Ruth, would go whither he went.
He landed in Melbourne, and for a time was greatly
respected by the Jews for his learning. In the Hourke-


street synagogue he preached a sermon, in broken
Lnglish, and made use of strange metaphors and
curious similies. And as one of his similies was about
apples, the lecture is still known as Dr. Hailprin?s
? Apple Sermon.?
The Rev. Moses Rintel, Senior Jewish Minister of
Melbourne, and Chief Rabbi of Australia, and New
Zealand, who with great justice recognized him as a
brother professional, thought highly of him, and recom-
mended him to the Sydney congregation as their Chief
Rabbi; but, unfortunately, they did not elect him as
their spiritual guide.
Not having any means of support, and not finding
it profitable to practise magic among the incredulous
Australians?though he told many people the spots
where they would find large nuggets ?and being hard
pressed for money, he pawned to a certain philanthropic
Melbourne pawnbroker, for the sum of his magni-
ficent collection of Hebrew books, which was subse-
quently sold to the trustees of the Melbourne Public
Library for the person by whom the �9O profit
were made, not deeming it proper to spend a few
pounds in erecting a tombstone to mark the grave
of this remarkable man. With this small amount,
and a little credit, he opened a chemist?s shop
in Russell Street, where he also practised as a
physician.
However, his career in Australia was short. In the
archives of the Medical Board, I find that he was


registered a qualified medical practitioner on the sth of
March, 1860; and a notice of his death appeared in
the Argus of the 2nd August the same year.
Dr. Ncild, who knew him well, told me that he once
saw him prescribe dog?s fat to be put in some mixture.
He remarked to him that any other fat would be just as
good, as it consists chemically of the same ingredients.
But the Doctor of Galataserai knew better. The dog
was to be killed at midnight, and in a peculiar manner,
and the fat obtained would effect a magic cure of
which Dr. Neild knew nothing. Many other stories are
told of him. However, I hesitate to record them all, as
they rest upon the statements of people not altogether
unprejudiced.
He afterwards went to Sandhurst, where he got a good
practice. One morning, as he was just leaving home to
visit a patient in Inglewood, the woman he had eloped
with asked him for some money, which he refused to give
her, knowing she would spend it in drink. She cursed
him, telling him that he would break his neck that day.
He did not break his neck. However, he fell out of his
buggy, and broke his thigh. No assistance was rendered
to him on the spot, inflammation set in, and he died.
Four days he lay in Inglewood, until the inquest was
held by Dr. Crossland. He was then buried without
any religious ceremony, in the Jewish portion of the
Sandhurst cemetery. And thus ended the life of a
man, who was a compound of GENIUS, LUNACY, AND
KNAVERY.


Heinrich Heine, the great German satirist, says some-
where, in estimating the difference between Christian
and Jewish character, ?So zvie es sick christdt so jiidclt
cs sic/i," which may be translated into English, ? Six to
one. and half-a-dozen to the other.? Human nature is
intrinsically the same throughout the world, and all
variations of character owe their origin to extraneous
circumstances that influence different nations and
individuals, and not to any innate difference between
man and man. ? Hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew
hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions ?
. . . If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble
you in that.? For what has the Jew not had in
common with other nations? The Jews had their
lawgivers, statesmen, founders of sects, saints, poets,
philosophers, atheists, and also their charlatans. Had
they not in the Baal Shem, an Ignatius de Loyola;
a Luther in Moses Mendelssohn; a Rousseau in Solomon
Maimon ; and a John Law in Dr. Strousberg ??and so
in the person of Dr. Hailprin they had their Joseph
Balsamo, the king of charlatans.
