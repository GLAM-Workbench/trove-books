COMPARISON OF STEAM AND DIESEL LOCOMOTIVE TRACTION.
INTRODUCTION.
Diesel locomotives were first introduced onto the Commonwealth
Railways in 1951 and in dealing with steam traction the position as it applied
on the Trans-Australian Railway during the period July 1950 to June 1951 will
be considered in this comparison.
WATER;
Not any surface water exists within some hundreds of miles along
the T.A.R. During 1950/51 137 million gallons of water was used on this
(T.A.R.) railway for locomotive purposes at an average cost of 23.58 6
pence per locomotive unit/mile including the cost of distribution by special
water trains. By comparison water requirements for diesel traction cost
only 0.004 pence per locomotive unit/mile.
FUEL:
Under steam, coal was the standard fuel used. Experience with
various oils for furnace use showed that coal was the cheapest steam
locomotive fuel. The closest source of suitable coal was in N.S. W. In
1950/51 34,100 tons of coal was issued for locomotive use on the T.A.R.,
and the cost was 8 7.4 pence per locomotive unit/mile including the cost of
distributing it throughout the length of the T.A.R.
Distillate for diesel locomotives is taken from ships at Port Pirie
and stored in the Department's 1 million gallon bulk storage at Port Pirie.
The cost for 1960/61 including distribution was 17. 722 pence per locomotive
unit/mile.
LOCOMOTIVE POWER:
Typical examples of both steam and diesel locomotive power are
given. In 1950/51, 1, 156, 657 miles of standard gauge locomotive running
was performed with 41 steam locomotives of various classes whereas with
21 main line diesel electric locomotives, 2, 623,225 miles of running was
achieved during the year 1960/61.
A similar trend in savings was effected on the Central Australia
Railway following the introduction of diesel-electric locomotives on that
railway in 1954/55.
TRAIN RUNNING:
Train running graphs (Diagrams I, II) illustrate the advantages of
diesel-electric over steam locomotive traction in actual train operations.
For passenger trains, the total elapsed time between Port Pirie and
Kalgoorlie under steam operation was 43 hours 35 minutes whereas


with diesel locomotive power the elapsed time for the journey was reduced to
28 hrs. 30 mins. Similar figures for goods train operation were 44 hrs. 33
mins, and 38 hrs. 45 mins, respectively. Although maximum permitted
speeds were the same for both means of traction the average running speed
for passenger trains over various sections increased from between 14% and
46%, with a mean of approx. 30%.
Other significant savings derived from the introduction of diesel
traction are ; the increase in permissable train length (from 40 bogie
equivalent vehicles to 50 in length in the case of the T. A.R.) and the reduced
number of locomotive crews required.
LOCOMOTIVE MAINTENANCE :
Steam locomotive maintenance was done at the main depot at Port
Augusta (major overhauls) and at running sheds at five other locations on the
T.A.R. Approximately 250 employees were engaged full time on the
servicing and maintenance of steam locomotives.
For diesel traction all servicing maintenance and overhaul of
standard gauge locos and the heavy overhaul of the narrow gauge locomotives
is carried out exclusively at the Port Augusta workshops. This is done with
a staff of approximately 55 employees.
The Port Augusta diesel locomotive and rail car maintenance and
servicing shop is designed to provide the latest developments in servicing
facilities and the adoption of modern trade practices. Features include
special lighting for night servicing; all floors and platforms sealed to prevent
oil penetration; axial flow exhaust fans installed to remove engine fumes;
pressurising fans installed for the quick cooling of the engine room, and before
admission to the servicing pit locomotives are cleaned and washed down at
the entrance to the shop on concrete aprons provided for the purpose.
Special test and repair equipment is installed for the maintenance of
injectors, fuel pumps, governors and speed recorders. Special attention is
also given to the cleaning of the locomotive air filters.
LABORATORY ;
Laboratory testing of fuels, lubricants and coolants is an important
feature in maintenance and assures the best mechanical results in the operation
of diesel engines. This work constitutes a substantial portion of the work of


the laboratory, and as a result of this close control it has been possible to
extend the intervals between oil changes of GM diesel locomotives beyond
the recommendation of the engine manufacturers, and at the same time
maintain a lower liner wear rate.
STATISTICS :
Statistics given in the attached Tables illustrate the effect of
diesel locomotives in the operation of the railway. The component of
working expenses accounted for by locomotive power is less in 1960/61
than in 1950/51 despite the rising trend in costs and the increased traffic
requirements.

COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS
The branch administration of Commonwealth Railways and the main
workshops are located at Port Augusta at the head of Spencer Gulf in South
Australia. The Commissioner's office is in Melbourne.
RAILWAYS OPERATED.
Trans Australian Railway.
1108 Miles of standard gauge (4'B|") track from Port Pirie Junction
in South Australia to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
Central Australia Railway.
217 Miles of standard gauge (4* 8-|")track from Stirling North (52
Miles from Port Pirie and 4 Miles from Port Augusta) to Marree in the North
of South Australia, 540 Miles of narrow gauge (3'6") track Marree to Alice
Springs in the Northern Territory and 65 Miles of narrow gauge (3'6") line
Port Augusta to Hawker.
North Australia Railway.
316 Miles of narrow gauge track (3'6") from Darwin south to Birdum
the Northern Territory of Australia.
Australian Capital Territory Railway.
5 Miles from Queanbeyan in New South Wales to Canberra- standard
gauge (4’B^"). The New South Wales Government Railways provide the
rolling stock, locomotive power and train crews for the operation of this
railway.
For the purpose of this review, it will suffice to deal only with
the Trans-Australian Railway as the disadvantages of steam locomotion
and the advantages and savings which accrue from diesel traction also exist
on the Central Australia Railway and North Australia Railway and follow the
same trend.
Ruling Grades.
Trans Australian Railway - 1 in 80 in both directions.
Stirling North to Marree ~ 1 in 120 in Down direction.
1 in 180 in Up direction.
Marree to Alice Springs - linBo in both directions.


Boiler Feed Water.
Steam Traction.
The Trans-Australian and Central Australia Railways traverse
desert and semi-desert country having an average rainfall of from 5 to 12
inches per annum dependent upon the particular area, and evaporation of
17 to 100 inches using Waite formula.
Not any surface water exists within a radius of hundreds of
miles of either railway and whilst sub-artesian water is procurable from
bores and wells, the quality is such that it must be treated before being used
for boiler feed water. However, in some areas the quantity of sub-artesian
water is not sufficient to justify the expenditure on treatment facilities whilst
in other cases the total dissolved solids in the water render it unsuitable for
treatment. Consequently, treated boiler feed water is only available at
irregular locations, considerable distances apart.
Numerous reservoirs were constructed but owing to the low
rainfall and high evaporation, the benefit derived from them was limited
but they did however, have a beneficial effect on water haulage in good
seasons.
It was necessary to haul boiler feed water in railway tankers
up to 300 miles.
During the year 1950/51, an estimated quantity of 137, 000, 000
gallons of water was used for locomotive purposes on the Trans-Australian
Railway at an average cost of production of 8.572 pence per locomotive
unit mile. In addition, 49, 034 train miles were run in the working of water
trains at a cost of 354. 16 pence per train mile. Relating this latter cost to
the total of 1, 156, 657 steam locomotive unit miles for the year, we find that
it cost 15 pence per locomotive unit mile to distribute water by special water
trains.
Circulating Water.
Diesel Traction.
Diesel engine cooling water is treated by a base exchange
softening plant. The cost of such water including anl;i-corrosive additive
was only .004 pence per locomotive unit mile for the financial year 1960/61.
Fuel.
Steam Traction.
Coal was the standard fuel in use for steam locomotives although
from time to time owing to the uncertainty of supply and unsatisfactory quality


of the coal, it was necessary to temporarily convert some steam locomotives
to oil burners. However experience proved that coal was the cheapest steam
locomotive fuel based on experiments with various oils such as heavy marine
furnace oil, mixed diesel and marine furnace oil, etc.
The closest source of suitable coal was from the Newcastle area
in New South Wales and over the years immediately preceding ' the cessation
of steam traction, this coal gradually deteriorated in quality.
This Newcastle coal was shipped by sea - the cheapest means
of transport - to Port Augusta where it was stockpiled for despatch by rail
throughout the System. It was, therefore, necessary to rail coal as far as
the western terminal of the Trans-Australian Railway, 1049 Miles.
In addition to the fuelling facilities at the terminals and Port
Augusta - the main locomotive servicing depot- it was necessary to provide
for regular fuelling at seven other locations throughout the Trans-Australian
Railway, together with four emergency fuelling depots. These facilities
comprise coal stages through which the coal was handled manually or by
mechanical Grabs for filling overhead bins from railway trucks.
During the year 1950/51, approximately 34, 100 tons of coal was
issued to locomotives on the Trans-Australian Railway at an average purchase
price of 77 pence per locomotive unit mile. In addition, 33, 902 train miles
were worked by special trains in the distribution of coal on the Trans
Australian Railway at a cost of 354.164 pence per train mile. Relating this
latter cost to the total of 1, 156, 657 steam locomotive unit miles for the year,
it cost 10.4 pence per locomotive unit mile to distribute coal plus the average
purchase price of 77 pence per locomotive unit mile.
Fuel.
Diesel Traction.
Distillate for Diesel Electric Locomotives is discharged in bulk
from ships at Port Pirie to storage tanks from whence it is distributed in
9, 750 gallon rail tankers to Diesel Locomotive fuelling installations at Port
Augusta, Cook- approximately half way between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie-
and Parkeston, the Locomotive Depot 2 Miles east of Kalgoorlie.

storage of 20, 000 gallons is provided at Port Augusta, 88, 000 gallons at Cook
and 20,000 gallons at Parkeston.
It is not necessary to work special trains for fuel for Diesel Electric
Locomotives as adequate delivery can conveniently be arranged by normal train
services.
On the west bound trip, locomotive fuel tanks are replenished to
capacity at Cook but at Parkeston on the east bound trip, only sufficient fuel
is taken to ensure passage to Cook where supplies are replenished for the
journey to Port Pirie Junction.

It should be noted in making a comparison of locomotive and railcar
mileage that in 1950/51, standard gauge track extended from Port Pirie Junction
to Kalgoorlie whereas with the opening to traffic of the 217 Mile standard gauge
section Stirling North to Marree in 195 7, this section became an integral part
of standard gauge for locomotive and rollingstock working.
To achieve the locomotive unit mileage quoted above, 21 No. Main
Line Diesel Electric Locomotives and 6 No. Diesel Hydraulic and 2 No. Diesel
Electric Shunt Locomotives were utilised. These locomotives averaged
93, 876 miles per unit whereas the 41 Steam Locomotives in use in 1950/51
only averaged 28, 211 locomotive unit/miles.
It is not possible to differentiate between steam locomotives
Utilised for main line work and shunting operations during or prior to 1950/51
and the above comparison has been based on both main line and shunting
locomotive mileage. However, notice must be drawn to the fact that the 2.1 No.
Main Line Diesel Electric Locomotives averaged 124, 915 locomotive unit
miles during the financial year 1960/61.
This improvement in diesel as against steam in locomotive
availability is quite obviously due to greater reliability and time saved in shed
duty and servicing and better average train running time.
Whilst it is not the purpose of this report to particularly examine
the position in relation to railcars, it is of interest to note an increase in
mileage in this category for the financial year 1960/61 (172, 862 Miles) for
three Diesel Hydraulic Budd Railcars and two DH. Class Diesel Hydraulic
Railcars as against 128, 258 Miles for the three Budd Railcars during 1951/52,
this period being the first complete year of operation for the Budd Railcars
which were acquired in March 1951.
Railcars are utilised on services between Port Pirie Junction,
Port Augusta, Pimba and Marree.
Whilst dealing with standard gauge locomotive power, it would
perhaps be appropriate to make passing mention of the narrow gauge locomotives
The narrow gauge steam locomotive fleet comprised 22 NM. class
locomotives and dependent upon traffic offering additional power was provided
by the hire of steam locomotives from the neighbouring South Australian
Railways. With the completion of the standard gauge railway from Stirling

North to Marree in 1957, the narrow gauge section of the Central Australia
Railway was reduced to 605 Miles (540 Miles Marree to Alice Springs and
65 Miles Port Augusta to Hawker.) It was then possible to handle all narrow
gauge traffic with 12 No, NSU Class Diesel Electric Locomotives which had
been placed in service during 1954/55.
Train Services.
Diagram I shows the normal train service which applied with
steam traction during the financial year 1950/51 between Port Pirie and
Kalgoorlie and this service varied only to the extent of one or perhaps
two additional passenger trains during approximately three months of the
year.
Diagrams II and 111 depict the train service operated during the
year 1960/61 between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie also. Diagram II showing
what can be regarded as normal service whilst Diagram 111 includes peak
period traffic applying during Christmas and Easter Holiday periods.
The maximum permissible speeds for passenger and fast goods
trains hauled by either Steam or Diesel Electric Locomotives are 60 M.P.H,
and 50 M.P.H. respectively.
However, the statistics hereunder adequately reveal the
advantages of Diesel Electric over Steam Locomotive traction in actual
train operations.
Whilst there has not been any substantial saving in other than
actual running time with goods trains hauled by Diesel Electric Locomotives,
this is explained by the facts that under steam traction, special efforts were
made to effect train crossings at stations where steam locomotive servicing
operations were being performed at the same time and the steam locomotive
consequently bore the debit for the standing time of the train. Further, with
the considerable increase in train services, more standing time is incurred
by the consequent increase in train crossings.

Details of a passenger and goods train trip between Port Pirie and
Kalgoorlie hauled by steam locomotive during 1950/51 as compared with
Diesel Electric Locomotive during 1960/61.
The relative merits of Diesel Electric Locomotives as against steam
are further amplified in Diagrams IV and V.
The maximum permissible length of a steam powered train on the
Trans-Australian Railway was the equivalent of 40 bogie vehicles whilst with
the introduction of diesel traction, the limit has been raised to 50 bogies. It
is also worthy of mention that trains conveying coal from the Leigh Creek
Coalfields at Telford on the Stirling North-Marree Standard Gauge Railway,
to the Power Station adjacent to Stirling North, have a limit of 81 bogies in
length. These trains are hauled by double unit type Co-Co 1750 H P. G.M.
Diesel Electric Locomotives, the gross trailing tonnage being 5,220 tons.
Another significant saving derived from the introduction of diesel
traction is in the number of enginemen required, as apart from the fact that
the Diesel Electric Locomotives can be worked in multiple, thus saving a
locomotive crew for double headed trains, greater distances are covered within
the engineman's recognised shift by reason of increased average speed and
locomotive servicing time not being required enroute. This is illustrated
by the following in relation to the Trans-Australian Railway.

Locomotive Maintenance.
Steam Traction.
The principal Maintenance and Servicing Depot was located at Port
Augusta whilst Running Sheds were established at Port Pirie Junction, Tarcoola,
Cook, Rawlinna and Parkeston on the Trans Australian Railway.
Major overhauls were carried out in the Port Augusta Workshops.
Whilst accurate figures are not available, it is estimated that a
total of 250 employees in the category of Tradesmen, their Helpers and other
classifications employed full time on Steam Locomotive Servicing and
Maintenance.
Locomotive Maintenance
Diesel Traction.
All servicing, maintenance and overhaul of standard gauge Diesel
Electric Locomotives and Railcars and the heavy overhaul of the fleet of 12 No.
narrow gauge Diesel Electric Locomotives is carried out exclusively at the
Diesel Servicing Depot at the Port Augusta Workshops by a Staff of only
approximately 55 employees - Tradesmen, Helpers, Cleaners, etc.
The Port Augusta Diesel Electric Locomotive and Rail-car
Maintenance and Servicing Shop has been designed to provide for the latest
servicing facilities and adoption of modern trade practices.
The shop has three pits, each 12 5 feet in length, two of which are of
the elevated rail type with inside pits four feet deep. The floor surfaces
outside the rail being three feet below rail level thus eliminating the necessity
for workmen to work in a cramped position. This also enables work being
undertaken speedily and permits of maximum inspection of undergear. Concrete
platforms afford easy access to cab and engineroom of locomotives stabled on
roads each side of the elevated platform.
Four locomotives can be accommodated for servicing and overhaul
at the one time.

the concrete servicing platform.


The lifting of locomotives required for replacing bogies and other
heavy lifts such as traction motors etc., is performed by two 60-ton overhead
travelling cranes.
Special lighting is provided for night servicing Enclosed light
fittings are mounted on the track studs to illuminate the space between the
rails and locomotive undergear as also is lighting provided beneath the
platforms. High bay incandescent lighting is installed for general shop
illumination and low voltage outlets are available for extension and inspection
lamps.
All floors and platforms are sealed to prevent oil penetration
and surfaces painted with grey sealing paint giving maximum light reflection.
Floors are regularly cleaned with detergent solutions and ramps are treated
with a ’non-skid' compound.
Engine fumes are removed from the shop by six 36" axial flow
exhaust fans installed in roof sections immediately above the stabled
locomotives.
A 30 K. V, A. step down transformer together with contactor,
protective equipment, and extension leads is employed for locomotive
pressurising fans for quick cooling of the engineroom to provide improved
working conditions.
Before admission to the servicing pits, locomotive car bodies
are cleaned with detergent solution and washed down on a concrete apron at
the entrance to the shop. Bogies are cleaned with de-greasing oil to prevent
accumulation of oil soaked debris which could present a fire hazard.
At the rear of the servicing roads an area is set aside for
repair of shunting locomotive and railcar diesel engines and power generating
sets whilst in an adjacent section, heavy engine and component parts are
dis-assembled for easy transport and handling to the parts cleaning shed in
the immediate vicinity.
The shop layout also provides for a section in which repair and
assembly of cylinder heads, piston and liner assemblies, blowers and other
components is undertaken as well as the overhaul and testing of air compressor
and air brake equipment whilst space is set aside for the overhaul of mechanics
and hydraulic transmissions.
Space is also available for locomotive bogie, main generator,
traction motor and heavy engine overhaul and assembly.


Test Bench, Injector Room.
"Merlin" Servicemaster Injector Servicing Machine.
"Hartridge" Fuel Pump Test Stand and "Woodward" Governor
Test Stand.


The repair, overhaul and testing of injectors, fuel pumps,
governors and speed recording instruments is carried out in an enclosed room,
this room being supplied with filtered air to eliminate dust.
In addition to the injector test stands for the various types
of injectors in use, a "Merlin Servicemaster" is utilised for the reconditioning
of injector nozzle valves and grinding of valve tips.
A Hartbridge" fuel pump test stand and "Woodward" governor
test stand are also available.
Attachments are provided to permit the use of the variable speed
take off drive, of the fuel pump tester for the testing and adjustment of lock
up governors and speed recorders.
In the parts cleaning shed mechanical and air operated agitated
tanks are available for cleaning with the use of chemical solutions together
with steam spraying equipment. A hand operated gantry chain pulley block
is available for easy placement of components into the tanks.
Locomotive air filters are cleaned by means of a Paxton-Mitchell
Filter washing machine. The machine is fitted with a basket into which the
filters are loaded and then rotated. Whilst in motion, the filters are sprayed with
jets of hot water following which a detergent solution is used then recirculated
back to its reservoir. The filters are finally sprayed with hot water, blown
with air and then a mist of oil containing a tackiness compound is deposited
on the filter medium.
A Clayton 30 H.P, steam generator provides steam for filter
cleaning, steam cleaning of locomotive bogies, engine components and the
heating of a caustic tank for cleaning axle boxes and brake rigging.
Three 1, 000 gallon elevated tanks are utilised for the storage
of engine lubricating oil, used sump oil and treated diesel engine cooling
water. Electric pumps are employed for the addition to or removal from
the locomotive of oil and water, Two of the storage tanks referred to can
be seen in the background of the photo depicting the Clayton Steam Generator.
In addition to machine tools which include a No. 6 Black and Decker
valve and tool grinder, drill stands, grinding and buffing wheels, etc., a shock
absorber test stand for checking shock absorbers and stabilisers fitted to
locomotive bogies, a 300 Amp. welding machine and a multi-range battery
charger capable of handling all types of engine starting batteries, are installed.

Atlas Wheel Profile Truing Machine


Within the Diesel Shop, a small store is provided for the safe
custody of all hand tools and special application tools required for servicing
which include a large range of electric measuring and test equipment as well
as electric and air operated impact wrenches which have assisted in reducing
'down-time' on engines.
A material store is established adjacent to the Diesel Shop and
accommodates all materials and component parts required for main line and
shunting locomotives and railcars. Transport of the heavier components to
and from the Store is effected with a 1-ton mobile hydraulic crane.
To assist with the speedy, efficient and accurate repair and
overhaul of locomotives and railcars, other modern equipment available
includes :-
An Atlas Wheel Profile Truing Machine which is capable of
profiling the wheels in situ on a Co-Co diesel electric locomotive in
approximately 8 hours as compared with having the locomotive out of
service for approximately 5 days should it be necessary to remove the
wheels from the bogies for turning.
A Hegenscheidt" Model 161. H Semi-automatic Heavy Duty
Wheel Lathe is available for quick and accurate work should wheel turns
be undertaken during bogie overhaul.
A General Electric" Model 17 EMSSD2 engine loading resistor
capable of testing outputs from 380 H.P. to 2500 H.P. greatly facilitates
testing of engine - generator sets for Diesel Electric Locomotives after
overhaul.
Oil Sleuth.
Testing of fuels, lubricants and coolants assures best mechanical
results in operation of Diesel Engines.
The analysis of Diesel engine fuel, crankcase oil and coolant
of locomotives and other units has constituted a substantial portion of the
work in the Departmental Laboratory.
Photo-electric absorptiometric methods are being used for the
determination of wear elements in used Diesel Locomotive crankcase oils.
The actual evaluation of analytical results from crankcase oil analyses
is of greatest importance and is quite involved. Correct interpretation of
these data has greatly assisted maintenance operations by giving indications
of approaching troubles. Operating costs can be reduced if excessive wear

can be determined at its inception before breakdown occurs. A systematic
and continuous record of oil conditions is maintained, thus any significant
change is noted.
The sole criterion of oil drain on this system is based on oil
conditions as indicated by Laboratory analyses.
Resulting from this work it has been possible to extend the
intervals between oil changes of the G.M. Diesel Locomotives beyond the
recommendation of the engine makers viz. from 27, 000 miles to over
400, 000 miles and at the same time maintaining a low liner wear rate of
0.0002 inches per Ij 000 hours of operation.
The photographs show Laboratory Assistants conducting the
vital tests that pay off in better performance and minimum wear of
Diesel Engines.


Viscosity tests being run on samples of lubricating oils.
Photo-electric absorptiometric methods are being used for
the determination of wear metals in Diesel engine crankcase oils.
