The Place of the
Red Triangle.
Its Sphere Defined.
During the war three big voluntary organisations
followed the Australian troops with three distinct
objects in view. The function of the Australian
branch of the British Red Cross Society was the care
of the sick and wounded. The Australian Comforts
Fund undertook the free distribution of comforts to
the A.I.F. TO THE AUSTRALIAN Y.M.C.A. WAS
ALLOTTED THE TASK OF CATERING FOR THE
RECREATIONAL, SOCIAL, AND MORAL WEL-
FARE OF THE SOLDIER. Within its respective
fields of work each organisation has performed great
service to the A.I.F.
The Soldiers' Social Welfare.
The aim of the Australian Y.M.C.A. throughout the
war was to promote the social welfare of the soldier,
and to provide him with huts and other rendezvous
where, beneath the sign of the Red Triangle, he was
enabled temporarily to put aside military duties, pro-
fitably spend his leisure hours, and receive such en-
tertainment as would relieve his mind from the stress
of war. THE WORK OF THE Y.M.C.A. WAS
STATED IN A SHORT SENTENCE BEFORE BUL-
LECOURT, WHEN, AFTER LISTENING WITH HIS
BATTALION TO A RED TRIANGLE ENTERTAIN-
MENT, A COLONEL SHOOK THE HAND OF A
Y.M.C.A. REPRESENTATIVE, AND SAID, “YOU
HAVE PREVENTED MY MEN FROM THINKING
OF TO-MORROW’S BATTLE.” Every soldier who
has been beneath the roof of a Red Triangle hut, who
has sat in its chairs, who has used its writing paper,
attended its cinema shows, concerts or lectures, and
who found something pleasant for his soul In the
“home from home” atmosphere, has received some
benefit from the Australian Y.M.C.A. This service
was free.


Cost of Free Concerts.
Quite a number of soldiers think that the giving: of
free concerts cost the Australian Y.M.C.A. nothing.
As a matter of fact, the Red Triangle expenditure
in this direction has been large. The minutes of a
meeting of the Central Recreation Committee, A.I.F.
Depots in the United Kingdom, held at Tidworth on
7/10/1918, show, for instance, that the expenditure
on the six months’ (programme submitted by the
Y.M.C.A. to that meeting totalled £3,600, or £6OO
per month. THE AUSTRALIAN Y.M.C.A.’S FREE
ENTERTAINMENTS PROVIDED FOR SOLDIERS
IN GREAT BRITAIN DURING THE SIX MONTHS
ENDED 30th SEPTEMBER, 1918, COST £7,128/16/0
I.H.L. and Street Patrols.
Many soldiers came into contact in some way or
other with the activities of the International Y.M.C.A.
Hospitality League. There is, therefore, interest in
the following figures, which cover the two four-
weekly periods ending 28th September and 26th
October, 1918 —just before the signing of the Armis-
tice :
Number of enquiries re-
ceived Sept., 72,387; Oct,, 84,229

hon guides ~ 4,021 ~ 5,882

tainment 10,679 ~ 13,230

Free teas provided for .... •• 30,580 ~ 27,702


Christmas Gifts.
Troops who were in France during the last Christ-
mas season will recollect the gift wallets received
from the Australian Y.M.C.A. The number of wallets
distributed was as follows:
First Australian Division .... . . 13,770
Second „ „ 13,307
Third „ „ 13,094
Fourth „ „ 14,032
Fifth „ „ 13,763
Corps Troops ~ 8,435
Other military details at Headquar-
ters, Hospitals, etc 7,820
84,221
Wallets were also given at the same time to the
Australian troops in Palestine. Soldiers in Egypt
and Palestine received the following additional com-
forts from the Australian Y.M.C.A. at that period:—
9,792 packets of chocolate; 10,224 boxes of matches;
5,000 packets of cigarettes; 4,792 cakes: 13,000 cigars;
4,506 packets of butter-scotch; and 4,748 tins of meat
paste. The units concerned were, —Australian Di-
visional Headquarters, Australian Divisional Train,
and 3rd, 4th, and sth Light Horse Brigades.
Canteen Finance.
Some soldiers regard the canteen counter as the
bulwark of Red Triangle service. They declare, that
since articles handed across that counter are charged
for, the man in khaki gets “nothing for nothing from
the Y.M.C.A.” This is a criticism which no thinking
soldier with knowledge of the real facts of the case
would voice What are the facts of the case? Early
in the war, the Australian Y.M.C.A. set about exe-
cuting its charter of social service to the A.I.F.
The Army’s need for canteens, however, became in-
sistent. The Military Authorities invited the Y.M.C.A.
to run dry canteens with the A.I.F. abroad. The
task of the Y.M.C.A. in the war was to serve the
troops. Canteens in the huts were declared necessary
for the troops. It was decided to provide them as a
department of service. In England and France the
military authorities fix the prices charged. THE
GROSS PROFITS EARNED ON THE SALE OF
ARTICLES TO THE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN RE-
TURNED TO THE SOLDIERS IN THE FORM
OF FREE DISTRIBUTIONS TO TROOPS ENTER


ING AND LEAVING BATTLE, AT POINTS OF
EMBARKATION AND DISEMBARKATION, AND
TO THE WALKING WOUNDED, AND TO
PRISONERS OF WAR. IT SHOULD BE EMPHA-
SISED, HOWEVER, THAT THE POLICY OF THE
Y.M.C.A. IS TO GIVE FREE SERVICE AND NOT
PRIMARILY FREE SUPPLIES. THE LATTER IS
THE PROVINCE OF THE COMFORTS FUND. The
audited accounts of the Australian Y.M.C.A. prove
that the free service of the Y.M.C.A. has always cost
more than the gross canteen profits, which merged in
the free service expenditure. Take, for instance, the
following extracts from the audited accounts of the
Australian Y.M.C.A. in England and France during
the (period between April, 1916, and 30th September,
1918:—The gross profit on canteen sales totalled
£36,175/1/4. Against that amount was set the follow-
ing expenditure on free service:—
Free distributions—
Food, drinks and smokes
and Christmas wallets £31,830 1 1
Prisoners of war alloca-
tion .... io,poo 0 0
£41,830 I 1
Free entertainments 22,216 16 9
Free equipment and sports material . . 70,527 9 4
Free stationery 10,805 17 5
Free literature and magazines 5,950 1 2
Buildings for free use of troops . . . . 40,675 10 8
£192,005 16 5
IT WILL, THEREFORE, BE SEEN THAT THE
FREE DISTRIBUTIONS EXCEEDED THE GROSS
CANTEEN PROFITS BY £5,654/19/9, WHILE THE
TOTAL AMOUNT EXPENDED ON FREE SERVICE
TO THE TROOPS BY THE Y.M.C.A. WAS NEARLY
450 PER CENT GREATER THAN THOSE PROFITS.
Financial Facts.
Equally illuminating are the following financial
facts taken from the audited accounts of the Aus-
tralian Y.M.C.A. in Great Britain and France for the
six months ending 30th September, 1918: —
Cost of free entertainments. Great
Britain £7,128 16 0
Free trophies provided. Great Britain
and France . . ■ 425 10 5
Free refreshments, etc., —Great Britain 1,414 10 3
~ ~ ~ —France . . . . 7,140 8 8


Stationery, literature and magazines—
Great Britain 52,199 18 11
France 4,662 11 10
Dry canteen profits. Great Britain
and France, for the six months . . . . 7,446 4 3
Equipment and games provided in
Great Britain for the six months . . 9,382 16 0
Equipment and games (provided in
France for the six months 15,072 15 4
IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THE TOTAL
AMOUNT OF FREE REFRESHMENTS ALONE,
AS ABOVE SET OUT, EXCEEDS THE CANTEEN
PROFITS BY £l,lOB/14/8.
Money Used for War Work Only.
Covering the twelve months ending 31st December,
1918, the balance sheet of the National Committee,
Y.M.C.A.s of Australasia (Army and Navy Depart-
ment), was published in every morning daily news-
paper in the Commonwealth on or about 24th March,
1919. Prior to that, annual balance sheets covering
the war (period have been regularly published. NOT
ONE PENNY OF THE MONEYS CONTRIBUTED
BY THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC TOWARDS THE
AUSTRALIAN Y.M.C.A.’S WAR WORK, AND AC-
COUNTED FOR IN THESE BALANCE SHEETS,
HAS BEEN, IS BEING, OR WILL BE USED FOR
ANY OTHER OBJECT THAN MILITARY SERVICE.
Free Distributions.
Attention is directed to a few instances given
hereunder of free distributions by the Australian
Y.M.C.A.:—
“The Divisional Commander desires to acknowledge
with thanks the following free distribution of goods
by the Australian Y.M.C.A. during recent operations
of the Division:—Distributed direct to units and
through free centres at Bayonvillers and Harbon-
nieres:—Cigarettes, 187,000; cocoa, 84 lbs.; biscuits,
2,330 packets: milk, 7 cases; matches, 7 gross. Dis-
tributed between 7th and 11th August:—Biscuits,
1,600 packets; cigarettes, 45,000; cocoa, 182 lbs.;
matches, 2 gross: milk, 12 cases.” (Major-General
Sir J. Talbot Hobbs, K.C.8., V.D., Commanding sth
Australian Division, 4/9/18.)


“Just after the great attack on the Bullecourt line
on 11th April, 1917, on the night of the 12th, the
4th Brigade trained back for a little distance, and as
the men came in that night my own canteen was not
ready, but the AUSTRALIAN Y.M.C.A. WAS
THERE. AND ALL THROUGH THAT NIGHT
THESE MEN WHO WERE JUST OUT OF HELL
WERE SERVED WITH THE Y.M.C.A. .GOODS,
AND NEVER PAID ONE PENNY FOR THEM."
(Brigadier-General C. H. Brand, C.M.G., C. 8., D. 5.0.,
State Commandant of Victoria.)
“If it had not been for the piano, gramaphones,
boxing gloves, medicine and punch balls, kites,
various games and amusements, stationery, excellent
and varied reading matter (which were all supplied
gratis by the Y.M.C.A.) one must admit that our five
weeks’ trip would have been very monotonous.” (A
Hudson, Naval Rating, H.M.A.T. “Port Darwin.”)
“To-day (10/8/18), after having been seven days
without cigarettes owing to our big advance, our
Y.M.C.A. friend came to light with cigarettes for all
hands. He also visited us in the front line at Villers-
Bretonneux, where he supplied us with cigarettes,
writing paper and reading books, while we were out
of touch with shops and canteens.” (J. W. Allitt,
3 Platoon, “A” Company, 38th Battalion.)
“Received from Australian Y.M.C.A. for distribu-
tion to units of the Camel Brigade:—Matches, 2
gross; chocolate, 3.45 G packets; cigarettes, 6,000:
writing paper, 4,000 sheets; envelopes, 1,500;
“Palestine News,” 250 copies.” (J. H. Hall, Lieut.
Staff Captain, Imperial Camel Brigade, 17/4/18.)
“The Y.M.C.A. have very kindly arranged to supply
sufficient ingredients for our reinforcements arriving
from the Base and other places to receive one cup
of cocoa on arrival in this area. The Y.M.C.A. will
deliver a sufficient supply each week to Headquarters
Supply Depot, where it will be drawn hy each unit
and made available for the troops on arrival.” (Ex-
tract from Routine Orders by Lt. Col. H. J. H.
Clayton, Commandant, Australian Corps Reinforce-
ment Camp, 22/6/18.)
“The Australian Y.M.C.A. did excellent work during
the battle of Messines and established a canteen and
coffee stall in Prowse, a locality subjected to heavy
and constant shell fire.” (Brig. General C. Rosenthal,
G.0.C., 9th Brigade A.1.P., 28/12/17.)
“We were fully dead broke in that line and have
been doing a starve for smokes for the last week, so


you can just picture the welcome smile on each
digger’s face when your cigarettes were handed
round.” (Bombardier E. J. Hayward, 38th Battery,
A.F.A., 18/8/18.)

Demobilisation.
As an entertainment agency alone, the task of the
Australian Y.M.C.A. during demobilisation is colossal.
Its programme is fourfold—recreational, educational,
hospitality, and troopship service. THE DIRECTOR-
GENERAL OF DEMOBILISATION, LIEUT. GENE-
RAL SIR JOHN MONASH, HAS TOLD THE
AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC THAT “DURING DEMO-
BILISATION THE AUSTRALIAN Y.M.C.A. IS
NEEDED MORE URGENTLY THAN EVER.” IT
REMAINS FOR THE RETURNED SOLDIERS TO
SUPPORT HIS WORDS.
A Returned Soldier’s Judgment.
A retimed soldier recently expressed his view re-
garding the Australian Y.M.C.A.’s war work in the
following terms:—“Now that I dm back here I have
got a better chance of seeing things whole. If I
liked I could quote in public some of the mistakes
which the Australian Y.M.C.A. has made. But the
service which that Association is giving the soldiers
is dependent upon public subscriptions. Therefore I
say nothing except to the Australian Y.M.C.A. au-
thorities themselves concerning any reason for com-
plaint I may have against the Red Triangle. I SAY
NOTHING, BECAUSE I KNOW, AFTER YEARS OF
CAMPAIGNING, THAT ONE PER CENT. OR TWO
PER CENT. INEFFICIENCY ON THE PART OF
THE AUSTRALIAN Y.M.C.A. IS BALANCED BY
98 OR 99 PER CENT. EFFICIENCY, AND THAT
THE RED TRIANGLE MUST BE JUDGED ON THE
GENERAL RECORD OF ITS SERVICE. Looking at
the thing in that way, I say to myself,—‘ Did the
Australian Y.M.C.A. make things any more comfort-
able and decent for me over there than would have
been the case had no soldiers’ huts been placarded
with the Red Triangle?’ I can find only one answer —
that the Australian Y.M.C.A. did bring a big measure
of comfort and pleasure to the digger, and, in my
judgment, did a remarkably fine bit of work.”
