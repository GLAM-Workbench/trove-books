THE HISTORY OF AH EMINENT lAH.
SIR DANIEL COOPER, Bart., C.C.B.G.
BIRTH AND EDUCATION.
f'toifO
Sir Daniel Cooper was born at Bolton, Lancashire, on
the Ist of July, 1821. When very young he made the then
tedious passage to New South Wales, remaining at colonial
schools until nearly fourteen years old. For the completion
of his education it was then deemed desirable that he should
return to England, and having again crossed the wide ocean
he entered University College, London ; he remained here
for four years, going through class after class with honours.
It was intended that he should study law at the termi-
nation of his school life, but his health was not sufficiently
strong, and the idea had to be abandoned. A mercantile
career was therefore planned, and Daniel Cooper, after
travelling through the English manufacturing districts,
entered a house of business at Havre in the year 1841. He


remained here a very short time, and then, returning to
England, was employed in the counting-house of his uncle.
His health, which had improved during his nine months’
residence in France, again gave way, so Mr. Cooper sailed
a second time for the brighter southern land.
ARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA.
Immediately upon his arrival he was connected with his
uncle’s firm, at that time one of the most extensive mer-
cantile houses in Australia. Upon the dissolution of the
firm in 1848 the business was carried on by himself and his
elder brother. In its turn this partnership was dissolved in
1852, since which time the business has been conducted under
the name of D. Cooper and Co. Upon the discovery of gold
this firm was among the first to undertake the shipment of
the precious metal, a series of transactions which proved
very remunerative.
In the year 1847 Mr. Cooper was appointed a Director of
the Bank of New South Wales, and in 1855 he was made
the President, and he has continued his connection with
this institution to the present day. In 1849 his name was
entered on the Commission of the Peace.
POLITICAL CAREER.
Turning now to Sir Daniel’s political career, which is cer-
tainly what he will be most remembered for, we find him
taking an interest in public matters soon after his return
to the colony. In 1849 he was elected a member of the


Legislative Council of New South Wales, which was at that
time the only representative body, and which then included
the colonies of Victoria and Queensland. The Council was
dissolved, and Mr. Cooper did not then offer himself for
re-election, on account of ill-health and pressure of private
business.
In 1853 he was in a manner forced again into public life.
Dr, Osborne, who had followed Mr. Cooper, resigned his
seat on leaving the colony for England, and he was again
nominated by his old constituents, and elected, without
his being present at the nomination or taking any part in
the proceedings. It would be difficult to conceive a more
thorough expression of confidence on the part of a consti-
tuency than was shown by this act. Two years later the
Act was passed which gave to the colony a Constitution
modelled on the English Parliament Provision was made
for a responsible Ministry, and two deliberative bodies, the
Assembly, or Lower House, to consist of fifty-four members,
the Council, or Upper House, of twenty-one members. The
utmost duration of Parliament was fixed at five years. The
new Act received much adverse criticism, the nomination of
the Upper House by the Crown being one of the principles
which met with the strongest opposition.
SPEAKER OF THE NEW ASSEMBLY.
In 1856 the first election was held under the new Consti-
tution, when Mr. Cooper was again returned. The high
reputation he had already attained was very forcibly evinced
by the proposition at once made that he should be chosen


to fill the office of Speaker in the new Assembly. Sir H.
Watson Parker, who had been chairman of committees for
nine years in the old Council, was nominated in opposition,
but was defeated. The duties of this office were of the most
delicate nature. In our House of Commons, it is difficult
to restrain turbulent members even when the feeling of the
whole House has turned against them ; in a newly-formed
Parliament in a newly-populated country the difficulty must
have been increased tenfold ; with no precedent to guide
action, great individual strength was required to check
defiance or opposition, and much judgment to decide
constantly-recurring matters of doubt. While Speaker of
the House Mr, Cooper at all times commanded the deference
and respect of members.
CREATED A KNIGHT.
In 1857 his public serviceswere rewarded with knighthood.
He resigned his office as Speaker in iB6O, and on his
retirement he received the thanks of the House for his
impartial ruling. A further mark of esteem was shown by
a grand banquet given in his honour by the members of both
Houses. 111-health alone was the cause of his retirement,
but so valuable were his services deemed that immediately
afterwards he was requested to form a Ministry on the
resignation of the Forster Government. The position thus
offered—which might be deemed the summit of colonial
ambition—he was compelled to decline. His health was
completely broken down, and after a year’s rest he resolved
to return to his native country.


In a letter subsequently published, he wrote ; “ My health
was entirely broken down at the age of forty, and it was
only with great care for six or seven years that I recovered
my strength of body and mind. When I resigned the
Speakership my medical attendants declared that my health
was almost gone beyond recovery ; I only, therefore, gave
up the work when necessity compelled me to do so”
During his career in the colonies he contributed liberally to
the Sydney University and other deserving objects, and was
especially liberal in the support he gave to the Patriotic Fund
organised during the Crimean War.
RETURN TO ENGLAND.
Coming to England in 1861, Sir Daniel soon discovered
that his presence in this country might be turned to the
advantage of the colony. For many years the wool-growers
of the colonies had complained that their interests were
greatly neglected by the London merchants, who charged
excessive commissions, allowed their wool-bales to be
plundered, and suffered the warehouse-keepers, brokers,
and others to charge and do pretty well what they liked with
the wool. The annual value of wool sent home by the
colonies was about ;£i 5,000,000, and the irregularities com-
plained of amounted to a large sum, if represented by money,
and the loss was serious to a comparatively small body of
men, who were prevented by distance from defending their
own interests. Sir Daniel’s endeavour to remedy this brought
him into collision with some of the London merchants, who
were unwilling that any change should be made ; but in the


end he was successful, and a saving to the colonies of some
hundreds of thousands of pounds was effected.
SERVICES RENDERED.
During the cotton famine in Lancashire he not only con-
tributed liberally, but affected colonial opinion in favour of
the organisation for alleviating the distress. The sum so
raised was devoted to educational purposes —that is to say,
in that time of misery educated persons in distress were
enabled to earn a living by teaching others more ignorant,
who were forced into a state of idleness, and thus their
minds were kept occupied. Emigration, the San Francisco
mail contracts, and the duplication of the telegraph service
are matters which have also engaged Sir Daniel’s attention.
HONOURS CONFERRED.
A further recognition of Sir Daniel’s services was made
in 1863, when Her Majesty conferred on him the order of a
baronetcy. A reward bestowed upon a colonist for services
rendered to his colony is an act that is appreciated by every
one in that country, and no course could be adopted more
calculated to strengthen the alliance and mutual good feel-
ing between the mother country and her dependencies.
Although the reward is only given to one man, a compli-
ment is paid to the thousands with whom he has been
associated, and in the most graceful way a regard shown for
the welfare of the weaker power, which cannot fail to
strengthen the mutual goodwill. The undoubted merit of
the recipient heightens the value of the compliment.


Sir Daniel Cooper was not only raised to a baronetcy for
services rendered through the colony to England, but for
work done directly for the benefit of the land in which he
lived, and which was also of benefit to the mother country,
inasmuch as it strengthened a province under her charge.
There may have been isolated cases, but of late years
the title of baronet has seldom been bestowed upon any
man who has not proved himself thoroughly worthy of the
dignity, and it is therefore not a valueless reward that has
been conferred upon the subject of this sketch. In honour-
ing their greatest men England honours her colonies, and
her colonies never fail to return the good opinion thus
expressed.
Sir Daniel has been a representative of the colonies at all
the International Exhibitions in Great Britain, on the Con-
tinent, aud the United States, and during the Colonial
and Indian Exhibition of 1887 he was particularly active.
Sir Daniel was made a K.C.M.G. in 1880, and G.C.M.G.
in 1888. He was married in 1846 and has numerous
descendants.
THE SUGAR CONVENTION BILL.
During the last few years Sir Daniel Cooper has taken
considerable interest in the abolition of “Foreign Bounties.’
His great personal influence with various parties, induced
him to throw all his efforts to support the Government in
carrying the “ International Sugar Convention Bill ” during
the present Session of Parliament.
The object of the Bill introduced in the House of Commons
on April 12th, was to enable her Majesty to carry into effect a con-


vention with foreign powers, in relation to bounties on the expor-
tation of sugar. Where the fact of the in any country
out of the United Kingdom, of a system involving open or
disguisedbounties on sugar is established by decision of the majority
of the signatory powers of the Convention, by this Bill it would
be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to direct that all
sugar coming from that country shall be prohibited from importa-
tion into the Kingdom, and to make regulations requiring the origin
of all sugar imported, whether in transit or otherwise, or to be
proved by certificate or by such further evidence as the Customs
may require. While an Order in Council under the Act is in force,
the laws relating to the Customs will apply to all sugar coming
from the country named in the Order that is not in transit, and to
all sugar, whether in transit or not, the origin of which is not
proved.
Owing to the strenuous opposition from supporters of
“ Free Trade ” and pressure of other business, the Govern-
ment decided to withdraw the Bill for this Session, but have
given their pledge to carry it early next Session,
In the meantime, Sir Daniel Cooper and others have
decided to render all the help they can to continue the
“Agitation Against Foreign Bounties,” which they believe
to be so detrimental to the welfare of the Working Classes
of this country.
