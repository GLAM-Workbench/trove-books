PREFACE.
More than three years have elapsed since the publisher issued his former Ballarat and Ballarat East
Directory. So numerous have been the town improvements, alterations, and additions; the population so
greatly increased; the changes of residence so many; and Ballarat and District have become so important;
that it now renders the old publication comparatively useless as a book of reference.
The want of a New Directory has been felt. The present compilation was contemplated about six
months since; but, owing to the difficulty of securing advertisements at that time, it was shelved for a month
or two. Complaints were uttered that it was useless to put a lot of advertisements together at the end of the
book, where few would care to look at or have occasion to refer to. This grievance has been remedied by
placing the advertisements in the margin of those pages to which the public must constantly refer, and
where they cannot fail to be noticed. This arrangement made it necessary to choose an unusual size page.
The placing of the advertisements in the margin will not interfere with the dictionary-like readiness with
which any portion may be referred to. It may not please the eye of some, but our advertisers must be
accommodated, as it would be impossible to publish a Local Directory, with a prospect of it proving
remunerative, without their extensive support. Even now, it will require a very large sale of the present
work, which the publisher fully anticipates, to re-emburse the large outlay already sustained.
There are more than 20,000 names herein, besides a large amount of local, general, and useful
intelligence, and on reference to various pages it may be seen that the whole compilation is the most recent,
and the information brought down to the present date.

The Brunswick Hotel,
STURT STREET, SOUTH,
Thb above Hotel has been built in such a manner as to ensure the
greatest possible comfort and convenience to its frequenters.
The rooms are very lofty and thoroughly ventilated, and the walls so
substantial that, in the summer months, the great luxury of coolness is
always obtainable.
Mining Directors are especially invited to inspect the up-stairs
parlors, which are unsurpassed by any in Ballarat. This, added to the
central situation of the Brunswick Hotel —the heart of the corner—
makes these rooms particularly well adapted for mining and other
meetings.
THE DINING ROOM
Is supplied with all that the taste and experience of one of the best
cooks in Australia can suggest. Gentlemen who like their meals served
in the style which first made the Cafe de Paris famous will find its

f. A. VBMit,
Surgeon Dentist
STURT STREET, BALLARAT.
Mr. Wilson constructs and fixes Artificial Teeth
either on Gold or Vulcanized India-rubber, and guarantees
a good fit, so as to be used with ease and comfort in mas-,
tication and at the same time presenting a perfectly natural
appearance.
Mr. W. strongly urges the importance of having Teeth
Stopped either with Gold or Amalgam Cement as soon
as they show any signs of decay, €s thus they may be
rendered as serviceable as sound teeth, and may be preserved
for many years.

As a medium for profitably investing the savings of those who
possess fixed incomes, this Society offers advantages unsur-
passed by any institution of a kindred character in the
colony.
The Progressive investing share, subject to a monthly
subscription of 10s., matures in 77 months, when ,£5O is
guaranteed to the investor, besides his share of the surplus
profits of the Society.
The Capital, or paid-up investing share of £5O, is guar-
anteed an annual dividend of 8 per cent., irrespective of a
share of the surplus profits of the Society, payable every
third year, computed to yield a handsome per centage on
the amount invested.
The Advantages offered to Borrowers are liberal, and far
in excess of any to be secured in negotiating loans through
ordinary channels.
Shares can be taken up at any monthly meeting, and
parties desirous of becoming shareholders, can obtain
Prospectuses or Rules, upon application to the Secretary.

In thanking their friends and the public generally for past favors,
beg to intimate to them that their stock of Wines consists of the

pure juice of the grapes. In soliciting their friends and the
public generally for their patronage, they wish to inform them
that they will be happy to deliver any order to any place in Bal-
larat. Their prices are from 13s. to £,l per dozen for either red
or white wine. Fresh fruits of the season always on hand. Any
order from fruit merchants or from private families will be
promptly attended to. The proof of such statement is that their
wines have always obtained first prizes at the exhibitions where
they exhibited any.

Water Supply.
The affairs of the Water Supply are con-
ducted by a committee of the two Councils,
known as the Rallarat and Eallarat East
Water Supply Committee, consisting of five
members from each Council. This body was
established in 1862. Previously the Water
Supply was conducted separately by the
Borough Councils, the only source of supply
at that time being the Wendouree Swamp.
The Government handed over Kirk’s dam,
with a grant of £IO,OOO, to the Water Supply
Committee on its being constituted, together
with certain water reserves in Rullarook on
which the Committee have constructed two
additional dams known as Harry Reale’s and
Pincott,s dams. The gross storage capacity
of the three reservoirs is 272,000,000 gallons.
The revenue, during the first year of the estab-
lishment of the Committee, was £3032; for
the year 3868 it amounted to £12,000. The
services laid in 1862 were 24 in number, they
are now 2500. The Government have agreed
to advance, by way of loan at 6 per cent., a
sum of £IOO,OOO out of the Water Supply Loan,
£15,000 of which has been received. It is in-
tended to construct a large storage basin, on
the present site of the Fellmongers village, to
be called the Gong Gong Reservoir, with a
capacity of 1000,000,000 (one thousand millions)
of gallons. This is the only water supply in
the colony which has been so largely contri-
buted to by the ratepayers, £60,000 of their
money having been expended on the works,
£20,000 of which were raised by a loan equally
between the two fioroughs, and the balance
from the profits of the water supply since its
establishment.
The present members of the Water Supply
Committee are —Councillors Davey, Duncan,
McDowall, Hunt, and Cowan of the Western
Council; Councillors Steinfeld, Anderson,
Clendinning, and Dodds from the Eastern
Council. Councillor Anderson is the_chairman
(now his third year of office). The other officers
are—Wm. Thomson, secretary and treasurer;
D. H. Ohlfsen Ragge, engineer; H. H. Peake,
collector; J. R. Cathcart, assistant; M. fiarlow,
ranger; Peter Love, foreman of works. The
offices are in Lewis Street, near the Gas Works:
open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.

Buninyong
Is an ancient township, and for years previous
to the gold discovery and the introduction of
police it had its district constable, the same as
Melbourne and Geelong. It is prettily and
healthily situated, and in the driest season
has always an abundance of that inestimable
luxury “ pure spring water,” the want of which
is often severely felt; whilst its rich volcanic
soil has been largely utilized by farmers, gar-
deners and others. The population of Bunin-
yong may be computed at 2000 persons. They
have a Theatre, Mechanics’ Institute, and
Temperance Hall, and also a bi-weekly news-
paper. The following gentlemen form the
Borough Council: —

This Borough embraces within its boundary
the richest mining claims in the district, and
contains a population of nearly 7000 persons.
It it well furnished with places of worship,
and the different temperance and other
societies are well represented although there
are forty-five temples devoted to the worship
of “ Bacchus.” The number of assessments
for this year are 1635, of the estimated value
of £22,440. The streets are lighted with gas
and kerosine, and the mains are laid for the
water supply. The public buildings consist of
Town Hall, Police Court, Mechanics’ Institute,
Post-office, &c. There is also a recreation
ground and cricket club.
The election of the first Council was on the
12th December, 1864, with the following result.

Gold Discoveries.
In 1851, there was quite an exodus of persons
from Melbourne to Sydney, where gold had
been discovered at the Turin byxMr. Hargreaves.
Almost immediately after gold was discovered
at Anderson’s Creek, in this colony, by Louis
John Michell and party, Jand for which dis-
covery a reward of ,£IOOO was paid by Govern-


ment. Previous to these discoveries gold had
been several times brought into Geelong and
Melbourne from the Pyrenees and Mt. William.
In chronological order, gold was next dis-
covered at Chines by a party fitted out by
Mr. John Jackson, then of Geelong, but more
recently known as the builder and occupier of
the hotel at the corner of Lydiard and Mair
Streets, at present occupied by Mrs. Dent.
The next public discovery was by Hiscock,
Edmunds, and party, near Buninyong, in June
1851, and then the far famed Golden Point, at
Ballarat, was marked out in the middle of
August following. There were some fourteen
persons present on that great occasion, among
whom were Hiscock, Edmunds, J. Oddie,
J.P., Dana st., H. B. Chalmers, M.8.8.C.; A.
Clark, editor of the Evening Mail; Turner,
painter, Victoria st.; —Woodward, french pol-
isher, offLydiardst; —Bray, draper, Sebastopol
(qy.), and others now living in Geelong. Al-
most simultaneously with Ballarat came Fryer’s
and Forest Creeks, which were discovered by a
party from Kyneton, who had spent some con-
siderable time in prospecting the Black Forest
and the famous gullies of Fryer’s Creek.
Among these were Joseph Davis and his partner
Stead—the former a surveyor and the latter a
fellmonger and wool sorter. After the dis-
covery of these two great gold fields came
others innumerable, withdrawing the popula-
tion from Ballarat, which during 1852 was
nearly deserted. In 1853 the diggers began to
return to their old quarters, and from that
time to the present a glance at the pages of
this Directory will show the rapid progress
made through the discovery of gold and the
indomitable perseverance of its inhabitants in
its development.
Miscellaneous.
Miner’s rights, ss. per annum, may be ob-
tained from the Sub-Treasury. In October
1851 the same license was first issued at 30s.
per month.
In September 1855 Messrs. J. B. Humffray
and P. Lalor were returned as the first gold-
fields parliamentary representatives.
Ballarat contains one centre of population,
computed as follows:
Ballarat 22,000
Ballarat East 16,000
Sebastopol 7000
Total 45,000
Rubicon Street divides the Borough of
Ballarat from that of Sebastopol, so that in
the three boroughs we have a population of
45,000 persons, where eighteen years ago one
solitary shepherd’s hut stood alone in its glory.
The growth of Ballarat has not only been rapid,
but solid, substantial, and permanent. Our
well made and lighted streets; our water
supply ; our religious, social, and public insti-
tutions ; our markets and places of commerce ;
together with our subterranean city bear
ample testimony to this. A period of sixteen
years has accomplished more for Ballarat than
as many centuries have done for places in
Europe; and its present proud position is in a
great measure attributable to the public spirit
and enterprize of its leading men: conspicuous
among whom, as one always forward in every
good work, is the first chairman of the Muni-
cipality, whose name will ever be associated
with our religious and charitable institutions.

How to become Registered as a
Voter.
The Registrar mates out a new “ General
List ” of voters during the first week of August
in every year, and “ Supplementary Lists ” on
the first day of November, February, and May.

whose name is not already on the Electoral
should take out an Elector’s Right on or before
the 31st of July, 31st of October, 31st of January,
or 30th April respectively; and having done so
he should ascertain whether his name has been
properly inserted in the printed list, which he
can do by applying at the office of the Regis-
trar for the district in which he claims to vote,
where the list is open for inspection, or may be
purchased, between the 21st of August and
18th September, the 21st of November and 18th
December, the 21st February and 18th March,
and the 21st May and 18th June respectively.
If his name be not in such list he must then
attend the Revision Court, which is held at ten
o’clock on the 18th September, 18th December,
18th March, and 18th June respectively, and
produce his Elector’s Right, and claim to have
his name inserted in the Roll.
No person can vote for members of Council
unless he hold an Elector’s Right.
