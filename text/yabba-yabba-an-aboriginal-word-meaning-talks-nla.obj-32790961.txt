In these days when life changes so rapidly, and the landmarks of yesterday
are the memories of to-day, it is good to find that there are some who stop
and remember, some, too, who do something more than that —who enshrine
their memories in words for the delight of the children who know not the
past.
Mrs. Marion James has called upon the rich store of her own childhood
experiences, and mixing fact with fancy, has in this little book bequeathed
to the children of Australia, poems, stories, legends which are truly Australian
in spirit. These will not only bring the children delight because of their
human interest, but will also picture for them an age that is gone, and I hope,
will create a deeper love for this sunny land of ours.
I wish Mrs. James every success with this little book.

May I express my commendation of the very Australian book, “Yabba
Yabba.” It is a good thing to base at least a part of our literature
for the young on our indigenous people and their lore. Every country in
the world owes a debt to its people-of-the-past, and most have
acknowledged it. In America, North and South, there are whole libraries
written on Aurancanian and Red Indian mythology, and ten times the number
based on their lore and adventure and on the Indian methods of hunting,
trapping, scouting, adventure, and even battle. Australia alone has been
neglectful in this way; or at least, till in these belated years when the living
source of subject has been destroyed in three-quarters of the continent. Even
the islands of the Pacific have been written by Australians to the exclusion
of their own land.
Tradition is a part of national defence. It has a psychological effect.
Without this, national force is merely compulsion, mere physical impulse—
consequently. every magpie made real to a child, every wombat or wallaby
looking in individuality at us from a page, every story that gives them
movement and identity, is building a national morale, and this is especally so
in regard to children. Even if no more than an airy structure is built on a
small fact, or a fraction of native lore, it is ours, and not of alien or otherwise
imported origin. More than this, all recollection is valuable, as it is history,
and history that every day is slipping farther from us, and soon will be lost
if not gathered now. Consequently, I welcome all books embodying these
things, and especially when they are for children. The illustrations in this
book are just what we want for the untrained young eyes of this country.

I feel sure that a warm welcome awaits YABBA YABBA. Reading it
should give rise to much “yabba-yabba,” many interesting and delightful
talks about Australia’s birds and beasts, her trees and flowers and all her
natural beauty, not excluding (for it is part of it) the folk-lore of her
aboriginal children.
It is excellent that these things should be shown to Australian children
through Australian eyes and talked about in accents that are racy of her
soil. Love of the good and beautiful things that God has given us through
nature ought, like Charity, to begin at home, though, again like Charity,
it must not end there.
1 very heartily recommend YABBA YABBA as a book well suited to
promote that love.

I was very pleased to receive the copy of ‘Yabba Yabba,” and congratulate
the boys on the excellence of the set-up and the printing, which would do
credit to an adult craftsman. The book itself should have a wide appeal;
both stories and articles are doing a work in making more widely known our
Australian legends of native life and customs. I trust the sales of the book
will materially assist the good work being carried on at the Home.
\ DOROTHY TANGNEY
(Senator D. M. Tangney).
"If a book come from the heart.” wrote Carlisle, “it will contrive to
reach other hearts—all Art and author-craft are of small amount to that.”
When 1 broadcast portion of Marion James’ book, ”Yabba Yabba,” there
was ample evidence in my mail that her stories had reached the hearts of my
listeners. ' Yabba Yabba” also measures up to Emerson’s idea of a good
book. He said that ‘‘the virtue of a book is to be readable.”
1 think Yabba \ abba should be in every Australian home. lam sure
tt wilt find a ready reception in all other parts of the British Empire. It
will carry with it the scent of the gum leaves.

AUSTRALIA
EARLY DAYS
"BALMERINGA" HOMESTEAD.


AUSTRALIA OUR COUNTRY
Australia with an emblem,
A sprig of wattle gold,
Where Waratahs of crimson,
In stateliness unfold,
The birth-place of the Emu,
The home of “Laughing Jack/’
Where Kangaroos go bounding
Upon unbeaten track,
We love you,—dear Australia,
Our Country rich and fair,
We pray that God will bless you
And keep you free from care.
Australia, land of sunshine,
A country great and free,
Where fringe of golden beaches
Links fertile land and sea,
With range of rugged mountains
That hold a beauty rare,
Where tall and slender gum-trees
Breathe fragrance on the air.
We love you, dear Australia,
Your Starry Cross and sky:
And we, your sons and daughters,
For you will proudly die.


CAPTAIN JAMES COOK
James Cook was born in England,
A Captain brave was he,
Who sailed the ship “Endeavour”
Across a trackless sea.
He visited New Zealand,
And then the wind with force
The little ship “Endeavour”
Set on another course.
His gallant crew of sailors,
Though some were sick and sore,
Were overjoyed one morning
To see a stretch of shore.
The sailing ship “Endeavour”
He anchored in a Bay,
While from the beach, some black-men
Threw spears in wild dismay.
With rank and file he landed,
Unfurled a flag from tree,
And claimed this land, Australia,
For England, you, and me.
Captain James Cook—the Columbus of Great Britain—
took possession of Australian Territory in the year 1770.
Botany Bay, where he first landed, was so called at the sug-
gestion of Sir Joseph Banks, a botanist, who accompanied


Captain Cook. The name was chosen because of the abund-
ance of native trees, flowers and shrubs which were found
there, and which, of course, were all new to Sir Joseph
Banks.
Years later, England used Botany Bay as a depot for
convicts, unfortunate people sent out for small offences.
They were so cruelly treated that Botany Bay, named for
its beauty, became known as “Botany Hell.”
Some free settlers arrived and they resided at Sydney
Cove, where Captain Phillip had moved his freight of poor
convicts. The settlers demanded that the country be no
longer known as, or used as, a dumping ground for the out-
casts of Britain. Thus, a great change took place—squatters,
farmers, explorers, wise and learned men came to the new
land. Scores of rich goldfields were discovered. Mines of
coal, silver, copper, iron, tin—in fact, nearly all the metals
of the world —were held in the lap of Australia, and the
country, like a young and virile mother—rich, healthy and
beautiful —awaited the birth of her sons, and you—you are
the children of Australia.

STORIES
MY GRANDPARENTS TOLD ME
My Grandfather told me some wonderful tales,
Of England and Ireland and Scotland and Wales,
Of Europe, America, and Asia too,
Where people are strange, and of queer things they do;
Of Africa’s jungles and Old River Nile;
The great sandy Desert and Pyramid pile;
Of Greenland, the home of the poor Eskimo,
Who lives in a house made of ice and of snow.
But tales of Australia I love best to hear,
Our land full of sunshine and brimful of cheer.
My Grandmamma told me some wonderful things
Of peasants and soldiers, of Queens and of Kings,
She said that Magellan, a sailor so brave,
The name of “Pacific” to vast ocean gave;
Columbus—who said that the world must be round,
How he sailed from Spain, and America found.
And Drake—a bold Englishman, knighted he
For chasing the Spaniards away from the sea.
But tales of Australia I love best to hear,
Our land full of sunshine and brimful of cheer.
My Grandfather said that he followed the track
Of Kangaroo, Emu and old Laughing Jack;
That Magpies for him sang a sweet morning song,
And wise Boobook Owls hooted loudly and long.
With weapons of Boomerang, Nullah and Spear,
A tribe of wild blackfellows filled him with fear.
He told me of these, and of many things more,
Of how Captain Cook came to land on our shore.
For tales of Australia I love best to hear,
Our land full of sunshine and brimful of cheer.
My Grandmamma said some who blazened the track,
Like Burke, Wills, and Kennedy never came back
That Farrar worked hard that the wheat here might grow.
(Macarthur it was brought some sheep here, you know).
That Sii Henry Parkes when in power made a rule
That parents must send all their children to school.
J^ n Edward Eyre found and named a great lake,
While Wentworth fought hard that our own laws we make
the tales of Australia I love best to hear,
Of early explorer and old pioneer.

THREE
AUSTRALIAN LEGENDS


THE SPOILS OF AN EMU CHASE
[An Aboriginal Legend]
ANY years ago there dwelt in this beautiful
country a race of people, tall, dark-skinned,
brave and warlike. Punkalla, the Chief of one of
the tribes, whose fine long beard was now snow-
white, knew he would soon join the Spirit World
beyond the hills. He was the proud possessor of three sons,
and as they were worthy youths he found it difficult to
appoint his successor, as he must do before he died.
Standing near his gunyah of bark, he called upon the
Spirit of the Ranges to help him; and, as a breeze began to
stir the trees gently, he heard the Spirit say:
“Red, Red is for thy son Waralla, who fights so well
and who is brave and strong.
“White, White is for thy son Murra, who is gentle,
good and kind.
“Blue, Blue is for thy son Kulnura, who is passionate,
wise and learned.
“Go! Take the counsel of aged Mother Earth concerning
these colours. The one she first reveals to thee will indicate
the son worthy to take thy place.”
“Nay, nay, Great Spirit!” cried Punkalla, “my limbs
are feeble and my hair is white. I may not be able to return
here should I journey to the valleys of Mother Earth, where
she displays her floral bunting.”
“Send thy sons!” said the Spirit. “Let the one who
first returns to thee with the colour in quest of which he
was sent, be appointed chief of thy tribe.”
Next morning Punkalla arose with the first laugh of
the Kookaburra and seated himself under the great red gum
that sheltered the gunyah, to await the return of his sons,
who had just set out on their morning chase. He, now old
and feeble, and no longer able to accompany them, knew
they would not return empty-handed. Had he not trained
them from their infancy to become skilled and mighty
hunters? Fleet would be the speed of the Kangaroo, swift
the flight of the feathered denizen of the bush, that escaped
the boomerang or spear of these stalwart youths.




When the shadows told him that the sun was getting
higher in the heavens, he roused himself from his reverie
and prepared to light a fire with sticks in aboriginal fashion.
He had it ready just as the hunters returned.
“Sons,” he said, “I journey soon to the Spirit World.
When you have eaten of your nardoo and your meats, you
shall return to the valleys of Mother Earth, who holds the
secrets of the future. From
there bring to me the
flowers I now bid you seek:
Waralla, a red flower that
will speak of strength, blood
and boldness; Murra, a
flower soft-natured in tex-
ture, white, pure and ten-
der; Kulnura, a flower that
is blue, containing the azure
of the skies and the cobalt
of the seas, since you know
whence come the storm
clouds that darken the
skies, and the winds that
lash the seas with their
fury. Now go, and may
the Spirit of the Great
Bush guide you.”
Having finished their
meal, the sons started out
on their mission, with their
father’s blessing. They
journeyed for days over
the steep ridges, through
the long winding valleys
where the tall kangaroo
grasses nodded their shin-
ing heads as if to welcome their approach. Now and
then a reptile, just emerging from its long winter
sleep, would uncoil itself from the tussocks, and. with its
deadly fangs, threaten their advance, but Waralla gloried
in killing such creatures. Discarding his weapons, he would
quickly seize a snake by its tail, whirl it in the air, then,


with a swift movement of his powerful wrist, break its back
and render it incapable of doing harm. Snake steak formed
a tasty meal, and they, knowing the snake had been killed
in this manner, were not afraid it had injected the poison
from its fangs into its own body, as snakes so often do
when hurt.
Murra, always kind-hearted, watched the nesting birds
and protected them. He often refrained from using both
boomerang and nullah lest they kill the mother of the young
and helpless.
The brothers looked to Kulnura for guidance to the
floral field of this wonderful land. His wisdom enabled them
to find their way by night, as well as by day. Often when
the clear moon and silvery cross of stars made the heavens
gleam, he would carve a picture or design on rock or tree
trunk, while his brothers looked on in silent admiration at
his wonderful skill. Sometimes he would disappear for a
time, to return later to tell of something new and strange
that he had discovered in this land of mystery. How proud
he was when he discovered the first Wattle trees of the
season, with their fluffy golden balls—little balls that
nodded their heads in welcome to him, each speaking of a
golden product that this land would one day send forth.
It was in the shade of one of these trees of wealth that
he met the beautiful Atah, the gold shining round her in a
halo of glory. She was the only daughter of the chief of a
tribe that dwelt amongst the hills. She, too, was fond of
birds and flowers and loved to deck herself with the glowing
colours of the bush. Though she belonged to a strange tribe,
Atah had no dread of this young warrior. Encouraged by
her smile, he approached her, and in soft melodious accents
he chanted a lay, telling of himself, his brothers, his people
and the quest that had brought them to these valleys. He
told her she was the beautiful flower he would like to trans-
plant to his father’s garden.
“That cannot be,” she said, “for my father has pro-
mised the youths who have been through the Bora ceremony
and know the sacred mysteries and the history of the tribe,
that he will give me in marriage to-morrow, when the sun
sinks in the west, to the one who shall return from the hunt
with the greatest number of Emu skins. Fearing it will be


the great Bulga, who excels in throwing the spear, but
whom I hate, I came to the Spirit of the Trees for comfort.
If I disobey my father’s wish, the Spirit of the Hills will let
his curse fall upon me and my people. You are pleasing in
my sight and resemble the warrior of my dreams the
warrior whom the waving plumes of the tree ferns beckoned
from over the hills. Your wavy ringlets, so like their curly
fronds, betoken that your thoughts are good and wise.”
“Atah, you must come with me to my brothers, who
rest by the Billabong,” said Kulnura. “They will return with
us to your father. To-morrow we will join in the hunt that
gives you as the prize.”
Full of confidence in his wisdom and goodness, she fol-
lowed him until they arrived at the billabong where his
brothers were awaiting his return. When they beheld the
maiden of this unknown tribe they could not conceal their
astonishment and admiration; but fearing some hidden foe,
they quickly seized their weapons, which were resting
against a tree, and took up a position ready to repel an
attack. A sign from Kulnura made them lower their spears.
He told of his meeting with the maiden, and, thus reassured,
they bade her welcome. She then invited them to visit the
gunyah of her father, Mulgoa. The brothers, in token of
peace, broke small green branches from a gum tree, and,
holding them aloft, followed her.
Mulgoa welcomed the strangers, for they had whiter
teeth and more shapely limbs than the youths of his tribe,
and as they danced at a corroboree given in their honour he
noticed their suppleness and graceful swaying. After the
corroboree the brothers made music, sweet and wonderful,
by placing gum leaves between their lips, music such as the
old chief and his warriors had never heard before.
He was willing to give his daughter to one of them,
provided he fulfilled the conditions, and he called upon the
Spirit of the Hills to assist them in the chase.
With the first trill of the Magpies before the dawn the
warriors marched out. The men of Mulgoa’s tribe, carrying
spears, stone axes, nullahs and boomerangs, looked disdain-
fully at the strangers. They thought that those who were
so skilled in gentler ways could not possibly be their equal
on the hunting grounds. But alas! When they saw the first


bird brought to the earth by Waralla, who had so cleverly
struck with his boomerang when Bulga’s had missed, their
look of disdain changed to one of astonishment.
Waralla, with the first skin and blood upon his hands,
rushed forward. Hostility was now roused in his heart, and
he longed to kill and destroy.
Murra followed, fearing for his brother, and feeling
sorry for the little birds and nestlings which would that
day be deprived of parental care. He knew that Kulnura
loved Atah and that it w r ould break his heart if Waralla
should win her. He wondered if he could help him in any
way. Could he add his skins to those of Kulnura?
Just then an emu came in sight with two baby birds at
her feet. Alas! He could not kill her; but even as he hesi-
tated a boomerang whizzed past him and the mother bird
fell. With a wild cry he rushed forward and caught up the
little chicks in his arms and defied the slayer, Waralla, to
touch them.
“They are too small,” said Waralla with contempt, ‘T
have left many such as they among the trees and grasses.”
“Then I will give to them what you have taken from
them,” said Murra, “care and protection until they are able
to provide for themselves.”
He placed the little chicks amongst a clump of tussocks
and commenced to look for others that had been left helpless.
It was then that a little flow r er seemed to raise its head and
nod at him from the earth—a little flower on fragile stem
with petals soft and white. He cried for joy. Surely this
was the flower his aged father had asked him to obtain.
To-morrow he would dig it up, pack its roots in soft damp
earth, and return with it to his father. How the beautiful
Atah would admire it! Of the flowers he could make a daisy
chain for her neck, and Kulnura could give it to her and
win her love.
“Take the little flower to our father at once,” said
Kulnura, “for I have many skins and hope to win Atah.”
“All I have,” said Murra, “are the little emu chicks.”
“Coo-ee! Coo-ee!” came a wild cry from Waralla He
stood some distance away; his hands were still red with
blood, and he flourished a stately red flower:


Coo-ee! —a crimson bloom I’ve
found,
With war blood for a crest,
Oh! Waratah you are my prize,
The Spirits have me blest.
Behold the flower, slender, tall,
With mighty head held high;
Reflecting rays of warmest light
From Sun-god in the sky.
Now show, great flow’r, your
heart to me,
And show me all your world,
The outline of a land I see
Where you were first un-
furled.
Heroic sons, I now behold
Who spill their blood for
Thee,
And with them, too, explorers’
graves,
Beneath an old gum tree.
The men I see have faces
white,
That fill my soul with fear,
While we, your sons, as dark as
night,
Hold boomerang and spear.
“To-morrow I will hasten to my father, taking with me
this great war flower and Atah, my bride, for I have goodly
skins as many as my fingers. The great Bulga cannot
outnumber these.”
So the hunters returned from the chase, Kulnura sad
at heart, for his skins numbered only eight; Murra sad at
heart, for he carried in a kangaroo skin twenty motherless
chicks; Bulga sad at heart, for Tilba of his own tribe had
one more skin than he.
They found Mulgoa squatting near a fire. His face and
legs were painted in weird designs with red and yellow
ochre. Each of the competitors in turn laid his emu skins


before the chief. “Waralla’s ten have won my daughter,
Atah,” said Mulgoa, as he sat admiring the spoils of the
chase.
Atah, who feared Waralla in his strength, stole from
amongst the women to Kulnura, who, with bowed head,
stood alone. He knew Waralla had won her and he felt his
heart would break. He begged her to come with him to
new lands.
“Come, come with me. Fear neither Waralla’s anger
nor the curse of the Spirits. Come with me, my beloved
Atah, and with you I will find the flower of blue for my
father.”
“Look!” cried Atah in amazement, “your brother tends
the little birds; he is good and I will help him.” She hastened
across to Murra and the chicks, and, picking up a baby bird,
held it gently to her face.
“Dear little bird,” she said, “your mother’s skin lies at
my father’s feet,” and her beautiful eyes filled with tears.
“Do let me help you tend them,” she begged of Murra, “I
cannot feel kindly towards the slayers of their parents.”
Mulgoa, watching them, demanded loudly of Murra
whether his daughter’s hand was not worth an emu skin.
Murra, looking up sadly, replied, “Chief, I grieve to say
I have twenty baby birds deprived of a mother’s wing.”
“Twenty baby birds have twenty emu skins; then it
is you who will wed Atah,” cried Mulgoa.
Hearing this, Kulnura stepped among them, and Atah,
surrounded by little emus, looked up into Murra’s face. Her
heart was filled with love for this man who cared for the
weak and helpless. Murra’s heart beat wildly as he saw her
lovely face, for he loved the maid. He had loved her all along.
Kulnura’s searching eyes seemed to read his inmost
thoughts, and Murra hung his head as if in shame.
Atah gently placed her hand in his and said: “Murra!
My chief, I gladly give my heart to you. May the Spirits
bless me that I may become a worthy wife.”


“Atah, ray Queen of flowers,” said Murra, taking her
in his arms.
Waralla’s eyes flashed with the desire to hurt, and he
called mockingly to Kulnura: “You! You could not win the
maid and you have not found the flower of blue. 0, wise and
clever fool, your learning seems a failure; I will take the
Red Flower of grandeur, blood and w r ar, to my father. I
will tell him the flower is my beloved Waratah.” The sound
of his wild laughter echoed back from the hills.
A terrible frenzy seized Kulnura. He raised his hands
above his head and called upon the Spirits of the Storm
Clouds. “Curse! Curse Waralla and the tribes,” he cried,
“let the white-faced men of whom his flower spoke come
and make their home upon this land. Let them be the worthy
sons of this country, and you, my brothers,” he hissed, “you
will be known as the laziest race upon the earth.”
Murra still held Atah closely in his arms, as if to shield
her from his brother’s curses.
Clouds gathered overhead, the thunder rumbled, the
storm crashed in anger. The wind, howling in its fury, lifted
trees and gunyahs from the ground. The mighty Spirit of
the Sky hurled to earth a spear of fire.
A great fear possessed the tribe. The men prostrated
themselves upon the ground. The women commenced to
wail in anguish—for lo! that shaft of fire had struck Murra
and Atah. They both lay dead, Atah still clasped in Murra’s
arms.
Waralla looked at the still forms, and yelling “Look
what your curse has done,” drove his spear into Kulnura’s
heart.
The Spirit of the Sky, relenting, let fall to earth a deluge
of tears.
Waralla mourned for several moons; he then wended his
way to the hillside to gather the blood-red bloom. The flower


had faded —the stem alone remained. Dejected, he returned
without it to the gunyah of his people, ambition gone and
spirit crushed.
Punkalla awaited the return of his sons with super-
stitious fear, for had not the shriek of the black Cockatoo
prepared him for evil tidings? After receiving Waralla and
his tidings, he bowed his venerable head and his soul passed
to the great Elysium beyond the hills, where the Spirits of
his ancestors awaited him.
Waralla thus became the chief of a race devoid of
ambition. But over the land of Sunshine, Wealth and
Beauty, of Gum Tree, Flannel Flower, Waratah and Wattle,
of Emu, Kangaroo and Laughing Jack, little blue flowers
of many shapes and shades are now seen mingling with the
red and white of myriad blooms.

Red, White and Blue.




FEATHERED WIT AND WISDOM
[A Legend of the Australian Coat of Arms]
ORE than a century ago one of our earliest Gov
ernors stood at the door of his humble residence
of state gazing intently at the tiny settlement
on the shores of Sydney Cove. As he looked at
the scattered huts and the few care-wom settlers
who had endured with him the many hardships and priva-
tions of the early days in this, their new home, a mental
picture arose before him.
He saw the small settlement of huts change to a great
city of beautiful and stately buildings of granite, marble
and stone, won from this fair land. Then looking towards
the distant mountains he saw them give forth their
treasures of copper, coal, silver and gold. He saw the plains
and tablelands with their sheep and wheat. He saw the
future people of this land of sunshine and plenty, a race of
stalwart, sun-tanned men whose fame would reach the four
corners of the earth. It was then that he decided that this
island continent should be represented by a Coat of Arms
symbolical of our glorious southern land with its natural
wealth and beauty.
“Bring me King Murrabrine,” said the Governor, “that
he may tell me what will best represent the virtues of this
nation that is to be.”
King Murrabrine was a tall, strong-limbed aboriginal
with a head of woolly black hair, flat nose and thick lips.
A small copper shield, a half moon, hung from his neck to
denote his rank, and a ’possum skin girded about his loins
was his only garment. In his hand he carried a boomerang.
He was pleased that the white Governor had sent for him,
and he willingly strode beside the messenger to the Gov-
ernor’s dwelling.
The Governor told Murrabrine that he thought the
country would one day be great and prosperous, and should
be represented by some distinguishing sign of its own.
“Let us have an emblem in which the animals and
birds of this wonderful land will have place of honour,” said
the Governor.




07
“Very well,” said the King, “I shall call the animals
and birds together and let them select the two most suitable
to do honour to the nation that is to be.”
Bidding the Governor good-bye, he hastened to the
foot of the mountain range, and standing under a large
gum tree called loudly “Yerura! Yerura!” Presently from
all directions birds and animals flocked to the tree. Even
snakes, goannas and lizards came to answer the call of
“Yerura.” It was the black King’s cry, and they knew a
gift was asked of them.
When they had gathered together, in and around the
tree, he told them what he wanted.
“Australia,” he said, “is the name given to our country
by a strange white people, who have come here from the
Motherland many miles across the sea. I have called you
together to select two worthy representatives to grace a
Coat of Arms, by which this land will be known all over
the world.”
“Ha Ha! Ho Ho! Ha Ha!” laughed the Kookaburra,
“an excellent idea, but we must have something suitable to

uphold the dignity of Australia. So let our small feathered
friends who are making such a noise with their ‘Chirrup,
Chirrup’ return to their homes, for they will never do.”
“It’s Tom Tit who is making the row,” said little Willie
Wagtail. “I’ll peck him on the beak if he doesn’t stop teas-
ing the Wrens and little Jacky Winter.”
“You little rascal, Willie Wagtail,” said Tom Tit, “you
were teasing the other birds; I heard you call the Diamond
Sparrow ‘Uncle’ and ask him ‘how was business.’ ”
“Yes,” said the Wren, “and you told the Silver Eye
there was ‘green in his eye.’ ”
“That will do, that will
do,” said the Kookaburra.
“Where is the Whip Bird?
Let him take you all home
and keep you in order with
that whip call of his. Little
birds should be seen and
not heard; and mind, there
is not to be any pecking of
beaks or pulling of feath-
ers—so take heed Tom
Tit and Willie Wagtail.
Now home you go, all of
you.”
Being obedient, as all
little people should be, they
shook their feathers and
flew away home.
“Now for the Coat of Arms,” continued the Kooka-
burra. “I am modest, but I confess I am the most suitable
person to represent this sunny land. I begin the day with a
laugh and end it with a laugh. I laugh often through the
day at my own old jokes. I make all Australia happy.
“To laugh, to laugh
I always try,
But never, never will I cry.
Ha Ha! Ho Ho! Ha Ha!”


“You old feathered poet,” said the Magpie.
“Gold crown, indeed!” said a chorus of little parrots.


“You old feathered poet,” said the Magpie. “We all
know you are a happy old man, but if I may say so, Mr.
Kookaburra, you laugh too much. Those silly old jokes of
yours make my head ache. Why, everybody calls you a
Jackass. A Jackass could not possibly represent Australia.
Indeed, it is I who should be chosen. Just glance at me, my
friends —black and white for both races. Australia, the land
of the black and the white man.”
“Nonsense!” said the White Cockatoo from his perch
in the tree. “I am a much more suitable person. Observe
my majestic appearance. Am I not a born King with a
golden crown, and a coat so beautifully white that I would
represent a ‘White Australia?’ ”
“Gold crown, indeed!” said a chorus of little parrots.
“We always call those yellow feathers on the top of your
head a topknot.”
“Oh, do you?” said the Cockatoo, and he flew
into a rage. “You over-dressed creatures”—s-c-r-e-e-c-h!
s-c-r-e-e-c-h!
“Don’t lose your temper, my friend. You look exceed-
ingly well,” said the Kookaburra, “but your voice upsets
our nerves.”
“The Cockatoo called us over-dressed creatures,” said
the Mountain Parrot from his corner of the tree, “but I
think our rich colourings of green, blue, yellow and red, and
those of our cousins, the King, Alory and Rosella parrots,
are most suited to represent this bright country.”
“Just so,” said the Kookaburra,
“Green for the pasture and green for the field,
Blue is the colour our sea and sky yield.
Yellow the sheen of our product’s regalia.
Red for the blood to be shed for Australia.”

“That sounds very well,” quoth a pretty Silver Grey
Native Companion, “but Australia will also produce won-
derful dancers, and as I dance beautifully, I should be
chosen. Now, all look at me.” He then began the funniest
dance ever seen. He bowed his head almost to the ground,
then jumped into the air, paused, bowed, and began to
execute a number of pretty steps.
“Stop him! Stop him!” cried a Black Swan excitedly,
“can’t you see he has changed his two-step into a
goose-step?”
“So he has,” said the Rifle Bird; “we never want to see
Australia goose-stepping, do we, Kookaburra?”
“No, no; I must put a stop to that. We are very for-
tunate in having a Rifle Bird,” said the Kookaburra—
“A Silver Grey Brolga once started a dance
That made the Black Swan with fear look askance.
A Rifle Bird, calling, declared, ‘We are free;
Australia goose-stepping will never do me.’
Ha Ha! Ho Ho! Ha! Ha!”

“I am a big strong bird,”
said the Swan, “and consider
myself most suitable to repre-
sent the country. I am very
fond of the water and look
quite graceful floating along a
stream.”
“I always admire you,” said
the Pelican, “but, like the Wild
Duck, you spend too much time
in the water.”
“He sails along so gracefully
And spends his time most
wastefully,”
said the Kookaburra. “As for
you, Mr. Water-Waggon, you
spend a lot of time in the
water yourself, and that old
boathouse bill of yours:
“Entices fish and frogs,
When coming home from
school,
To leap into your bill
Instead of in the pool;
And Mr, Frog serene,
In garb of bottle green,
Will give a final croak
When sliding down your
throat.
Ha Ha! Ho Ho! Ha Ha!”
“Silence!” said the
Wedge-tailed Eagle. “Am
I not the King of the air?
Are not eagles chosen as
symbols of justice, courage
strength and bravery? I
am one of the most beau-
tiful Eagles in the world,
and it is I who should
represent the land.”

“S-i-s, S-i-s,” said the Black Snake who had curled him-
self snugly at the foot of the tree. “What a lot you birds
have to say. I think it absurd to choose any of you when
lam in the land. lam the possessor of a deadly weapon
which all have cause to fear. I crawl along so silently and
can stab before friend or foe is aware that I am near,”
“Oh, dear Mr. Kookaburra, I feel ready to drop,” cried the
Magpie, as she trembled violently and looked at the snake.
“I am so glad you eat snakes; couldn’t you take a little
lunch now?”
“Fancy that dreadful creature upholding the dignity of
Australia,” said a
smart-looking Bee-
eater. “I can eat all
kipds of insects, and
I only wish I knew
how to eat a snake;
I’d soon get rid of
that fellow.”
“S-c-r-e-e-c-h! S-c-r-e-e-c-h!” cried a number of Galahs
and Cockatoos in alarm, and the little Parakeets gazing at
the snake nearly fell from the tree with fright.


“Don’t be alarmed, little friends,” said the Emu, as she
stood erect, “we all know the snake is a crawler. Australia
will never be represented by one. I believe in trying to win
over our enemies with
kindness, if possible. If
not, then let us have a
clean and open fight. Be-
sides, I have heard dreadful
tales of the Snake. I be-
lieve he crawled into a
garden called Eden once
and upset the lives of two
people, and, in fact, the
lives of all poor human
beings. He did tremendous
damage by persuading
them to eat forbidden fruit.
I think you should choose
someone strong, upright,
honest and industrious to uphold Australia. That is what
an Australian should be.”
“Hurrah! Hurrah! Ho Ho! Ha Ha! The Emu herself
shall represent us,” cried the Kookaburra joyously—
“The Emu is so big and strong,
Her neck is tall, her legs are long,
The grandest Bird our eyes have seen,
She walks as stately as a Queen.”
“Yes! Yes! she is upright, gentle and industrious,”
cried the birds in chorus, as they flapped their wings with
glee. “She is a true specimen of her native land. King Mur-
rabrine, we have selected and given you our Emu.”
“Thank you, my little feathered friends. You have
chosen wisely,” said the King. “I hope the animals will
select a companion worthy of her.”


“Well,” said the Dingo, or Native Dog, “the birds have
taken a long time to make their choice, so let us hurry.
Now I have heard it said these strange new people, like all
other people, love a dog. They look on him as a faithful
and helpful companion and have written of the deeds of
their brave dogs. So Australia could not be better repre-
sented than by her Native Dog.”
“Dingo!” hissed the Native Cat, “you are not an Aus-
tralian, you sly, horrid fellow. I have often listened on a
cold winter night to that dismal howl of yours echoing back


from the hills. Men love a dog, but never you. You will be
hated, and they will put a price on your scalp.”
“Only a spiteful cat would say those unkind things,”
said the Dingo, who looked quite sad.
“Friends! it is the cat who is welcomed in every man’s
home,” said the Native Cat. “Pussy she is called by little
children, who say and sing such beautiful things about her.”
“Cats!” said the Kookaburra, “Cats! I can’t imagine
this country represented by Native Cats.”
“Little Kookaburra, we are
glad of your help,” said a
Kangaroo. “You are such a wise
bird. Of course we know the
Native Cat is out of question.
It would take the
Devil himself to watch
her, and he is at pre-
sent in Tasmania with
the Tasmanian Wolf.”
“What about me?”
said a Platypus; “I
should be chosen as
the animal who is to
represent Australia, as I’m very like a bird in appearance.
Look at my duck bill—and my babies come from an egg,
too.”

near him—such a lovely ’possum, too —rather large,
with a dark grey coat of fur, touched in places with brown,
and a dear chubby little face. “I think the Opossum would
look well, don’t you?”
“Yes, I do, but I know someone else who would look
much better,” said the Kookaburra, and he smiled such a
nice smile at the Bear.
“So do I,” said a Rock Wallaby. “There are many kinds

companion for the Emu, so upstanding with his smooth coat
of fur and gentle eyes that can look anyone in the face. He
has a lovely disposition and is a brave fighter.”
“The Kangaroo! The Kangaroo!” the animals cried in
a chorus. “King Murrabrine, we give you the Kangaroo.”

GUM-LEAF MUSIC
[An Aboriginal Legend]
ANDALLA was a cave man, a warrior whose
strength secured him good shelter for his wife
and family. His time was spent in hunting for
meat and skins, and, as he was a good hunter,
his family had never felt the pangs of hunger
nor the cold of a severe winter as the others did
His cave dwelling, which he preferred to the bark
gunyah that the winds so easily disturbed, was at the foot
of the “Great Hills” on the east side of Australia, hills whose
magnificent rugged walls almost touched the sea.
His son, Wilgo, was now big and strong, and his daugh-
ter, Willa, was protected by her mother until her father
should find some brave man as husband for her. Wilgo was
very useful to his father. He sharpened the flint by rubbing
two stones together to make axes, he planed the boomerang
to its elbow curve, and cut spear tips with his sharp teeth.
He knew his father looked on him as a man now, for his
father had told him of the secrets and laws of the tribes.
He knew that after the next full moon he was to be sent
out into the world to hunt, to fight, to find a wife and make
a home for himself. His father had told him so; and his
mother had wept when his father said he was not to return
again to his father’s shelter.
As the moon grew bigger, he prepared for the time
when he would be alone in the great bush. He secured a
strong stone blade and made it extra sharp. At last the
moon was full, and at sunrise he would have to go out, and
perhaps be killed, or lost, as others of whom his father had
told him. He was frightened and could not sleep, and he
knew that his mother was awake and that her wet eyes
constantly rested upon him.
When morning came his mother gave him a special
piece of Kangaroo meat. Then his father took him to the
entrance of the cave, pushed aside a boulder that almost
filled the opening, and, pointing to the glowing sun, said:
“Wilgo, the man! Go out into the world and do the things
that men should do.”


And Wilgo set out, with one hand firmly holding the
stone blade that rested in the waistband of his small skin
covering.
He rambled on; the day
was beautiful and the things
that he saw filled him with
wonder and admiration. The
coolest of water tumbled
gracefully over the face of a
jagged cliff. Beautiful delicate
butterflies flitted unharmed
among thorny shrubs, and
birds chirped and called to
their mates from great tree
W tops, while lazy lizards sunned
and wriggled over lichen-cov-
ered rocks. He had nothing to
fear, and found an abundance
of sweet wild berries which
he ate. He looked at the sky
—it was vast and grand, and
the sun had passed over his
head, leaving a trail of prim-
rose, purple and gold.
Presently from somewhere
he heard a long, dismal howl.
He started, terrified. He
knew what the howl meant —
Dingoes creatures that
seemed not to belong to the
wonderful country. The Kan-
garoos, the Opossums, the
Koalas and the Wombats were all his friends. He had
known and loved them from babyhood. As children, he and

his sister Willa had played among the Emus, danced with
the Brolgas, and laughed with the Kookaburras; but he had
heard many strange stories from the old men of the tribe
about dingoes.
He heard the cry again and the noisy sniffing of
nostrils. Suddenly he saw glaring at him from among some
young trees, this strange dog-like creature, covered with a
coat of thick, shaggy yellow-brown hair. He had seen skins
like this before. He had worn one during a cold winter, so
he knew that his father must have met and killed these
savage animals.
The dingo moved slowly towards him, so with a wild
cry he commenced to climb a tree, and was quite out of
breath when he reached a limb and felt safe. He sat pa-
tiently watching every movement of the animal. He thought
the long howl might bring others and that he would be sur-
rounded by a pack of them. When night came and he could
not see through the darkness, he knew by the beast’s heavy
breathing that it was still there. With daylight, he found it
to be awake and still watching him.
Wilgo was tired and hungry; it was difficult for him
to keep awake. He thought the creature might yet attack
him, and he firmly pressed the stone blade. When .noon
came he was exhausted and feared he might fall from the
tree, but he knew the animal was also weary with watching,
and he was pleased when he saw the beast stretching itself
on the ground and resting its head on its paws. Surely it
was going to sleep, and he yet might escape.
The Dingo fell asleep, and Wilgo, gripping the stone
blade firmly in his hand, sprang through the air on to the
creature’s back, and quickly winding his arms tightly
around its thick neck squeezed and squeezed with all his
might, while the animal rolled and lurched, until, choking,
it lay helpless. Then Wilgo struck with the stone blade
several times until he felt the great body grow limp beneath
him. He sprang up, saw the blood upon the stone and realised
he had killed. He struck his chest with joy and called loudly
of his victory, hoping his voice would carry on the wind to
his father’s cave.
Wilgo skinned the animal and was pleased with its
quality. Then he covered the flesh with small bushes and


wandered on, looking for shelter that he might rest. He
found an opening in the side of a cliff where the water
tumbled, but he was too tired to notice the clumps of velvet
mosses and tender ferns that decorated it. He threw the
skin upon the ground, and stretching himself upon it, slept
for hours. When he awakened he began to prepare a shelter.
He gathered dried bushes and spread them for a bed, rolled
many stones to fill in the entrance, and after hours of toil
felt satisfied.
Thus he lived for some time and became a successful
hunter, and the proud possessor of a cave to shelter him.
He tended the ferns and flowering shrubs that grew there,
for it pleased him to see them adding beauty to his dwelling.
His companions were the birds, and he loved to see them
nesting, and watched for hours the parent birds caring for
their young.
One day he wandered far and was startled by the soft
thud of many feet approaching, but was delighted to see a
number of emus being driven by a young girl.
The girl was like his sister, Willa, tall and dark, with
masses of thick brown hair. Wilgo did not bother about the
emus but stood gazing at the girl, who presently turned in
his direction and stared at him. Wilgo thought she was
beautiful, much lovelier than his sister, and he decided she
should be his wife and share his cave home. So he ran
towards the girl, who seemed to realise suddenly that she
was in danger and bounded away like a young wallaby,
clearing shrubs and stones. She knew the way quite well
and was sure-footed. Wilgo, however, often stumbled, so
the girl was soon out of sight.
Wilgo returned to his shelter, disappointed, but deter-
mined to capture her; so he watched and waited for many,
many days. Sometimes he saw her in the distance with the
emus, but the girl was always alert and on the watch. Once
he saw her go to a clump of thick shrubs, place her hands
among the twigs and bring something to the surface which
she seemed to caress and then replace. Wilgo knew he could
not catch her, so he gazed with admiration until he saw her
drive the emus away. Then he went to the thicket to see
what had attracted the girl, and was surprised to hear the
sweetest of trills and chirps coming from a tiny bird which


had a nest there. He was charmed and thought that if he
could imitate the bird he could hide among the foliage and
capture the girl.
The little bird chirped and trilled, and when Wilgo tried
to imitate it, his voice was so harsh that the startled bird
flew from the nest. He tried again and again without
success, then he placed a tender gum leaf between his lips,
hoping the leaf would muffle the harsh sounds from his
throat. He was delighted with the result; the sounds became
much sweeter and softer. Smooth crescendo came, gentle
diminuendo accents, legato and staccato. He became an
expert with the gum leaf, and each morning before he left
his shelter he sang his leaf songs and the birds answered
him.
He now realised that the cave dwelling was pleasing,
that the mosses were soft and green and the ferns were
gracefully waving their fronds. He saw that beautiful
scarlet Illawarra Lilies, as tall as himself, and slender Cab-
bage Palms were growing in abundance near the entrance.
So he hastened to the clump of shrubs, and, crouching there,
waited and listened. Presently he heard the thud, thud, of
the emu feet that he knew so well, and the sweet voice of
the girl calling to them.
His heart beat fast, and bending his head he placed the
gum leaf to his mouth. He commenced to chirp and trill,
and peeping through the entwining leaves he could see the
girl coming nearer and nearer. She was more beautiful than
he had at first thought, so he sang his bird songs louder
and yet louder.
She made a graceful bound to the shrub, and while she
was extending her slender arm he sprang from his hiding-
place and seized her firmly with his strong hands. The girl
screamed and struggled, and with her sharp, even teeth
brought the blood from his hands and arms. He tried to
make her understand that he was Wilgo, the son of Wan-
dalla, that he would not hurt her, that he would protect her,
hunt and gather food for her, but the girl fought desper-
ately, and Wilgo picked her up and carried her to his cave
shelter. He placed her gently on the kangaroo skin, and the
girl looked at him with fear and anger in her eyes.
He left her alone for some time, and she was quick to


notice the natural beauty of his dwelling and the happy
chirping of the many birds which came in answer to the
gum-leaf song he indulged in. They did not fear him, he
was strong and looked good, yet she hated him and would
not eat the food he provided. She would await her chance
to escape and bring her father and brothers to kill him.
When Wilgo re-entered the cave, placing a bunch of
beautiful clematis flowers near her, he told her again that
his name was Wilgo and that he loved her. He then offered
her choice wild fruit, which she cast aside. Suddenly he
thought of something that might please her, a wonderful
nest of Blue Wrens, almost ready to fly, that he had found
near the face of the cliff where the water tumbled. So he
asked the girl to wait until he returned, and told her that
she could then go back to her people and he would not
attempt to recapture her.
He hurried out, and climbed over the jagged face of the
cliff, until he came to the nest where the birds chirped mer-
rily in answer to his bird song, for he had often brought
them food and they knew him well. He was leaning forward
and breaking the twigs that held the nest, when a loosened
stone suddenly gave way and he fell heavily to the ground
below, still holding the little birds so firmly in his hand that
they were unharmed. He could not move. He was hurt; so he
lay there, waiting until he could gather enough strength to
return to his cave shelter. He thought of the girl and sup-
posed she would return to her people.
Then from somewhere above him came the girl’s voice
calling, calling his name, “Wilgo, Wilgo!” Listening in-
tently, he could hear her footsteps getting nearer. When
she saw him she climbed quickly down cliff to his side.
He was so still that she feared he might be dead; and, seeing
the little frightened birds, she knew he had fallen while
trying to get them for her. “Wilgo!” she cried again, look-
ing at his still form, while big tears from her lovely eyes
splashed upon his face. Wilgo slowly raised himself, and,
smiling at the girl, placed his hand in hers.
“Wilgo,” she said, “I will stay with you and be your
wife and the mother of your sons,” and she helped Wilgo
back to their cave home.
To-day the aborigines throughout Australia use the gum leaf
as a musical instrument.

VERSES
AUSTRALIAN SEASONS


SPRING
September breezes pipe a tune,
To welcome Spring,
And running waters gurgle with
A merry ring.
The grass is pearled with gleaming drops
From passing show’rs;
And stately gums are freshly gowned
With scented flow’rs.
The Waratah with crimson crest
In Spring we see;
And wealth of pretty golden blooms
On Wattle tree.
Clematis, Bell and Native Rose,
With colours bright,
Are sparkling like the rarest gems
Beneath the light.
And other blooms of brilliant hues
Deck fairy bow’rs,
As Nature gives to us in Spring,
Her choicest flow’rs.
The feathered songsters greet it too,
With merry notes.
A sweet and mingling chorus comes
From bush birds’ throats.
The animals their best garbs don
When birdlets sing,
And frolic ’neath a clear blue sky
To welcome Spring.
The human heart with joy doth beat,
To happy tune.
The soul of man thanks God for Spring,
Morn, eve and noon.


SUMMER
Tis Summer-time, the sun is high,
And blazing in an azure sky,_
With scorching rays that quickly take
The ripples from the creek and lake.
Through miles of bush with burning hand,
A fiery demon sweeps the land,
And birds now send from parching throat,
To greet the sun, a languid note.
Hot days and nights tempt men away—
To hills or beaches cool they stray;
While animals await the breeze
And pant beneath the shady trees.
The whirr and buzz of insect band
In summer passes through the land,
And reptiles too, who seek the cool,
Will hide in grasses near the pool.
We hear a rumble from the skies,
And to the heavens raise our eyes;
For there a dark grey thunder cloud
With cooling drops the earth doth shroud.
These stormy drops will bathe the cheek
Of flowers, wilting, bent and meek;
And streamlets catch the rainy tear,
To gurgle fresh a note of cheer.
But Summer-time is passing now,
And man, with moisture on his brow,
Will harvest from the golden fields
The products that our Summer yields


AUTUMN
When Summer passes, Autumn comes,
And few the flow’rs we see,
But glows of colour rich now grace
The leaf of vine and tree.
The leaves are tinted red and bronze,
Some gold and purple too;
And many seeds now leave their pods
To bathe in Autumn dew.
An Autumn pilot—“WandTing Wind”
Will carry round and round
The seeds, to drop in fertile spots
Of soft and cooling ground.
The little birds that will migrate,
In Autumn wing their way;
And silent is the bushland that
Once echoed sweet their lay.
The sun, too, gleams with softened rays
And Autumn, near its close,
Has left to wait for Winter’s hand
Dame Nature in repose.
AUTUMN LEAVES
Oh! lovely Autumn leaves
That cling to branches fast,
Not anxious yet for sleep,
You let the sun drift past.
I saw you on a tree,
And heard the wood doves call,
When cold, disturbing winds
Began to make you fall.
So, sleep ’mid dewy grass,
You tinted gems of earth,
And fading colours blend
For Nature and rebirth.


WINTER
Winter, you are with us!
Through veils of mists I gaze,
Till wild and whirling west winds
Uplift your foggy haze.
Winter, you are with us!
So fickle, cold and chill,
You turn to hail and snowflakes
The vapour on the hill.
Winter, you are with us!
With floods and heavy rain,
Yet wearing cloak of sunshine
When passing hill and plain.
Winter, you are with us!
Warm breezes wait awhile,
But soon they’ll go a-dancing,
And thaw your frozen smile.
Winter, you are with us!
The Spring babe is unborn,
But lo! a star has fallen,
And buds break on the thorn.
A WINTER SONG
A Winter song, I once tried to set
While an owl in the dusk was hooting;
But a simple tune I could not beget,
For a magpie started luting.
This lone bird song filled the damp, cold air,
And my notes I could not gather,
For the crotchets and quavers slipped everywhere
In the chill of the Winter weather.




THREE BIRD STORIES


THE FROGS DID THE TRICK
OB PELICAN was in distress—he was in love
with a beautiful lady pelican who lived near
him, and the lady would have nothing whatever
to do with him.
Bob waited for her each morning beside Pelican
Creek, where he preened his feathers to attract her atten-
tion, winked one eye, then the other eye, but she refused to
even smile at him. At last, feeling desperate, he commenced
to sing, and the lady, with a disgusted stare, tossed her
head and walked away.
Bob thought he would consult his friend, Jack Kooka-
burra, the bush Lawyer, and ask his advice about the whole
affair. So one morning he strutted off, wending his way
for miles through unbeaten country until he arrived in
Gum-tree Parade, where Jack was to be found.
Jack, who usually keeps his weather eye open, saw Bob
approaching and knew he was in trouble, so he called out
loudly:
“Hello, Bob, old man, anything wrong? Ha Ha! Ho Ho!
Ha Ha!”
“Everything, everything!” sighed Bob as he sat down,
looking sad and dejected. “Jack, I’m in love with a beauti-
ful lady pelican and she’ll have nothing to do with me—
nothing. I’ve done everything to win her affection, but all
without success.”

“I’m sorry to hear that, Bob; tell me what you really
did,” said Jack.
“Did!” said Bob; “everything—strutted, preened, somer-
saulted, winked, and sang for her.”
“Bob! Surely
you did not sing
for her,” said
Jack. “You
should not have
done that. Have
you ever listened
to your own
voice ? It would
frighten your
best friend away.
You should take
singing lessons
before you try to
sing again,”
“I will, I will,”
said Bob; “I’ll
join the Magpies’
Choral Society at once; then, when my voice has improved,
I’ll sing for her again.”
“No! No! Bob, old fellow, you must not do that. You
were never meant to sing. Now, the way to please her is to
catch a couple of plump frogs, carry them to her in your
bill, and show her what a smart fellow you are. Most lady
pelicans are partial to frogs,” said Jack.
“Thanks, Jack,
my friend,” said
Bob; “I will try it
and let you know
how I get on.”
Some weeks
later Jack Kooka-
burra received a
piece of wedding
cake wrapped
neatly in tea-tree
bark and tied with


silken cobweb. A gum-leaf card was enclosed, and written
across it in red-gum ink was; “With Mr. and Mrs. Bob
Pelican’s compliments.”
There was a P.S. on the other side from Bob, saying:
“The frogs did the trick!”


THE NEGLECTED MAGPIE
.. OOD MORNING, Mr. Kookaburra,” said a Magpie
f __ sweetly as she alighted beside him on an old
fence.
“Good morning to you, Miss Magpie,” said he
laughingly and with a merry twinkle in his eye.
They chatted together about the weather, suitable sites
for building, the difficulty in procuring sites and material
for homes owing to the wholesale slaughter of trees, the
general depression and the high cost of living.
“It cost a dear friend of mine her freedom,” said the
Magpie sadly. “While trying to get a few early worms for
her nestlings, she was trapped by a man, locked up in a
horrid cage, and the little birds were left to starve and die.”
“Ah!” sighed the Kookaburra, “not only did it cost my
poor brother his freedom, but half his wing, trying to pro-
cure a grub breakfast from a human’s garden.”
“How ungrateful,” said the Magpie.
“Ungrateful,” said the Kookaburra indignantly, “I
would like you to fly with me to see my unfortunate brother.
There is a tall gum tree near the house. I visit it often and
try to cheer him with a few old jokes and a jolly laugh.
Poor fellow! He’s a brave Digger now (he digs for worms
daily in that man’s garden) and he always tries to answer


me with a merry Ha Ha! Ho Ho! I know he’s sad, his heart
is breaking, and it’s not his fault if he shows a ‘White
Feather’ now and then.”
“I am sure, Mr. Kookaburra,” said the Magpie, “you
are a family of happy Australians—good fellows—and do
your best for the country. You are not a pest or an annoy-
ance to anyone.”
“Thank you! Thank you! my friend,” said the Kooka-
burra. “I cannot refrain from blushing, and if my feathers
show a crimson tinge, don’t class me a ‘Red Ragger.’ ”
“Never, never!” cried the Magpie. “Why, your feathered
uniform of brown and khaki shades should remind Australia
of deeds done by her brave sons.”
“Say no more, my friend, you flatter me,” said the
Kookaburra. “If you ask any old Snake what he thinks of
me he’ll tell you I’m the worry of his life. Do you know my
poor brother hasn’t eaten a snake steak since he was cap-
tured. Little pieces of raw meat are given to him, and, of
course, he gathers the garden grubs. But what is that com-
pared to a tender fillet of snake? Besides, snake-catching
is such a fine sport.”
“If you continue to talk of snakes you will make me
quite ill,” said the Magpie. “I hate them and would never
eat one.”
“How would you like to be called Jacko? That’s the
name given to my brother by the creature that captured
him,” said the Kookaburra.
“Well,” said the Magpie, “I have heard you called a
Jackass.”
“Oh, that’s nothing,” said the Kookaburra. “While
I’ve been flying around and taking notes of the habits and
ways of the humans, I’ve heard the same fellow called Wil-
liam, Willie and Bill. So you see I’m entitled to be called
Kookaburra, Goburra and Laughing Jackass. I don’t care
much about the sound of the last name, but ‘A grub by any
other name will taste as sweet.’ By the way, which of my
names do you like best?”
“Now, if I were a Lady Kookaburra I might tell you,”
said the Magpie coyly. “Suppose we fly to the tree and see
your brother.”
“Come!” said the Kookaburra. They started off and


did not rest until they found themselves safely in the arms
of a tall spotted gum that stood near a large country home-
stead, that was surrounded by a garden. “Ha Ha! Ho Ho!
Ha Ha!” laughed the Kookaburra as loudly as he could, and
the Magpie, watching, sat silently beside him.
“Ha Ha! Ho Ho! Ha Ha!” came an answer, not from
the garden but from a
branch in the same tree.
“Hurrah ! Hurrah ! ”
cried the Kookaburra as
he suddenly left the Mag-
pie and flew to a lower
limb, where sat his broth-
er. What chatterings of
Ho’s ! and Ha’s! and
He’s! came from the two
birds—Jacko, telling how
that morning he discov-
ered his wing had grown
long enough for him to
fly, and how he hurriedly
made his escape, and sat
waiting for his brother
that they might journey
together back to their
home in the bush.
The other Kookaburra
was telling Jacko of the
little mate who mourned
the loss of her sweet-
heart, but who was wait-
ing patiently for his re-
turn, and was now busy
preparing a nest in the
old Red Gum. The two
birds then commenced their toilet. What brushing and
preening of feathers! When Jacko had finished there was
not a feather out of place. The Magpie, still watching,
forgave him because he was going to see the little sweet-
heart who waited for his return.
Presently, to her astonishment, they joined together in


a peal of laughter, directed at the man who had captureo
Jacko and who now stood gazing from his garden at the
tree. Then, without any warning, or a word of farewell to
her, both birds spread wing and flew in the direction of the
old red gum. .
“What Jackasses!” muttered the Magpie indignantly.
“They have evidently forgotten all about me. Spreading
her wings, she also flew—but in another direction.


/ ' /
TIT FOR TAT
“Ha Ha! Ho Ho! Ha Ha!” came a merry laugh from
the topmost branches of a tall gum tree. It was a beautiful
day, full of Australian sunshine. The scent of the Gum,
Wattle and Boronia blossoms made the air sweet and re-
freshing.
A lad, a fine specimen of an Australian youth, with
catapult in hand, stood gazing at the tree from which the
laughter came. Then creeping silently along and aiming at
the bird, he stumbled and
fell heavily to the ground,
giving his head a nasty bump.
“He He! Ha Ha!” came
the same laugh, as the Kooka-
burra looked down at him.
This Kookaburra seemed to
think the boy’s fall was a
great joke, and the tree fairly shook with his ringing
laughter. The very leaves of the tree seemed to be rustling
and bumping together with glee, and the gentle breeze had
a merry note in the “whirr! whirr!” of its song.
“Oh,” thought the boy, “I wonder why everything
seems to be laughing at me!” He tried to brush his coat
with his hands and discov-
ered with horror he was
only the size of a little
mouse. How tiny his hands
had grown. His feet, too,
how small they were. The
Kookaburra, with a wild,
mocking laugh, flew down
and seized him in its
claws. Oh, what dreadful
claws they were, and how
high he was lifted. Up and
up till at last he found
himself amongst the high-
est branches of the tree.
' &
The Kookaburra sat him on a limb and ordered him to
remain quite still.


He felt very dizzy after his quick trip through the air,
and had to rub his eyes to make sure he saw aright. For
there, sitting beside him, was his pet magpie, the very one
he had wounded with his catapult and taken home six weeks
ago. He had cut its wing, too. How did it get there?
The Magpie suddenly flew at him and commenced to
beat him about the face and head with the cut wing. How
the jagged ends of those feathers hurt him. “Don’t, don’t!”
he cried.
“You rascal,” screeched the Magpie, “you are the boy
who took me from my home in Gumtree Avenue, Bushland.
You made me a prisoner by cutting my wing. I will beat
you to death with what you have left of it.”
“Do not kill him yet,” said two little Redheads, “let us
pinch his legs and fingers with our beaks first. Remember,
he trapped us and locked us up in a horrid cage. We could
not even exercise our wings, but we tried to keep our beaks
in good order, hoping some day to punish him for his cruelty
to the feathered folk.”
“Ugh!” cried the boy, “however did the Redheads get
out of their cage?”
“Come along!” called the Kookaburra, “you can each
take a leg,” and he commenced to laugh again, “Ho Ho!
Ha Ha!”
The Magpie beat him about the face. The Redheads
pecked his hands and legs, while the Kookaburra laughed
and danced with joy to see him so punished. Oh, how he
ached; he felt he could not live much longer.
“Let me treat him as I would a snake,” said the Kooka-
burra, and, catching the boy again in his claws, carried him
higher in the tree. Then, without a word of warning, he let
him drop. Down! down! down! he went.
Oh, the nasty sensation of that fall he will never forget!
The sudden bump when he reached the earth seemed to
arouse him. He sat up, rubbed his eyes and looked for that
dreadful Kookaburra. There he was still sitting in the tree,
as if nothing had happened. The boy glanced quickly at his
hands. Thank goodness they were quite large again. So
were his feet. But there on his knees were spots of blood.


W I
Surely he must have been
pecked by the Redheads.
How his head ached! He
jumped up, grabbed his hat
and began to run home as
fast as he could. When he
arrived there, to his surprise, the
first thing he saw in the garden was
the Magpie. It did not even look at
him. How did it get back, he won-
dered. He rushed to see the cage
where the Redheads were, and there
they were both sitting on the perch.
“Oh,” he sighed, “I must have
had a dreadful dream when I
bumped my head, but I suppose the
birds would be happier away in the
trees. I’ll let them go.” He opened
the cage; after hesitating for a
moment, the little Redheads flew
out and were soon among the green
foliage of the trees. He then returned
to the Magpie.
“Poor little Maggie,” he said, “I
won’t cut your wing any more. When
• it grows big enough, you, too, can return
I to your bush home and friends. To-
morrow I will join the Gould League of
> Bird Lovers and never, never hurt or
catch a bird again.”
“Caw! Caw!” answered
the Magpie, with a happy
gurgle in her throat, as if
she were laughing, and her
little wings flapped her sides.
I think, in bird language,
she was saying “Hear,
hear!” or “Hurrah! Hur-
rah !”


A SPRING SONG
A lovely sight—a gladsome thing,
To see the trees, red-tipped in Spring.
The butterflies, that flit and play,
To watch them while the hours away.
A joy to hear a bumble bee
Go booming round an apple tree;
To listen to the thrush’s song,
Whose dulcet notes are sweet and long.
So join with me and let us sing,
A song of them, and of the Spring.


THREE WONDER WHYS


WHY THE BEARS CRY
Two little black babies once started to roam,
From gunyah of bark that they had as a home;
They rambled and scrambled and tumbled all day
In search of a place where the kangaroos play.
They sat ’neath a tree, picked a fern and a flow’r.
And rested awhile in a lyre-bird’s bow’r.
They climbed little hillocks, crossed valley and plain—
But kangaroo playgrounds they looked for in vain.
Then hungry they felt,
when from out of a
tree fork,
A greedy old fellow kept
calling “More Pork!”
And blinking at them
from the top of a tree
An old Boobook Owl sat
devouring his tea.
The poor little things,
they just shivered
with fright,
They saw the dark
shadows that come
with the night,
And snuggling together
they started to cry,
For there was the big
silver moon in the sky.
Now watching and listening a bear saw their plight,
He knew that the babes were afraid of the night.
Their mothers to find he decided to try,
This little Koala who heard the babes cry.
He heard from the children a sad little wail,
And sobbed to their mothers a pitiful tale.
With him they returned, and imagine their glee,
At finding their babies safe under a tree.
So bears learned to cry on the very first day
That little black babies went wand’ring away,
(And though I’m not certain that this is quite true,
I heard it was then that they lost their tails too).




WHY THE
KANGAROO
When I was quite little (a long time ago)
My home was a place where the Kangaroos grow.
Fve seen them at play, when they bounded with ease,
And made them my friends, with the birds and the trees.
Just now I am resting upon an old couch
Inventing a story called “Kangaroo pouch”;
For Kangaroos (I am pretending, you know)
Were all without pouches a long time ago.
The Kangaroo baby then sat on the back
Of Kangaroo Mother when on the bush track,
And clung to its Mother with little brown hand
When bounding about on this wonderful land.
But one day a Mother’s kind heart filled with fear—
Her baby, she thought, might be hit with a spear—
So, searching, she found on a shrub a sharp thorn,
And with it, so neatly, her soft skin was torn.
A pocket she’d fashioned, of comfort and grace,
That made for her baby a safe little place,
And little pouch pockets were placed in the fur,
Of Kangaroo Mothers who came after her.


Now here’s a story that I
know
The Ibises told long ago,
When once these birds had
chanced to stray
To other countries far
away.
They said, in Africa they’d
seen,
A grander bird than Emu
Queen,
An Ostrich that was larger
far
Than any of our Emus are.
WHY THE EMU’S
EGGS ARE GREEN
They also said the plumes it shed
Could decorate a Prince’s liead,
And that its eggs, large, white and round,
Made hillocks on the desert ground.
Now, they declared that
this was true,
That Emu eggs were then
white too—
But when they told the
Emu Queen,
With envy, all her eggs
turned green.

SIX
TRUE BUSH STORIES

I 1
NERRIGUNDAH
N the little South Coast village of Nerrigundah,
about fourteen miles by service car from
Narooma, stands a monument, which bears the
following inscription:
Erected by the Government
of New South Wales
in honour of
CONSTABLE
MILES O’GRADY
■
who on the 9th April, 1866,
while suffering
from severe illness,
single-handed, .
attacked
five armed bushrangers
and lost his life
in the encounter,
thus
setting a noble example
of
bravery in the
discharge of Public Duty
Travellers, their curiosity aroused, seek out an old iden-
tity to tell them the story of O’Grady’s heroism. But few
except Barney can remember that day in 1866.
Barney (my dad) is a very old man now, but at the
time when Nerrigundah was a prosperous gold-mining town,


he was just a small boy. Visions of riches in gold brought
many miners to the district. But unfortunately there were
others —outlaws, rogues and bushrangers—who wanted
gold, but did not relish the hard work of digging for it. The
police were kept very busy protecting the miners from
being robbed.
Young Barney liked to visit the Police camp and talk
to the men, particularly to Constable O’Grady, whose duties
had kept him at the camp most of the time. O’Grady was a
likeable young fellow T , and, like most of his Irish ancestors,
was a grand story-teller. His stories of bushrangers inter-
ested the boy, even more than his fairy tales of Ireland. So
it was natural that as soon as Barney heard the Clarke
Gang was on its w r ay to town he should think of O’Grady.
The boy was playing on the verandah of his home when
he heard the new T s. His sister called to him, telling him the
bushrangers were coming and that he must stay inside.
“There is a miner in the kitchen, and his leg is badly
hurt,” said his sister. “The bushrangers saw him riding
along the road near Deep Creek and when he would not stop
for them, they shot at him as he galloped away. A bullet
hit him in the leg. He spurred his horse and rode quickly on
to warn us.”
“Bushrangers!” said the boy, looking wide-eyed at his
sister. “Constable O’Grady told me they are dangerous
fellows. They steal cattle and horses, rob banks and men,
and sometimes kill people. I know a good place where father
can hide his money,” continued the boy in an undertone.
“Father has already given to Jock (the rouse-about)
money and some gold to put in a bucket down the well, and
mother is hiding her jewellery and father’s watch in the
tea chest,” said his sister.
Not to be outdone, the boy raced outside wdth his new
pocket knife, intending to conceal it under the old broody
hen. Broody hens, however, are apt to resent the attentions
of small boys, and Barney w*as getting the worst of the
encounter when he heard his father telling Jock to go
quickly and warn the people at Pollock’s Store.
Pollock’s Store was the post office, bank and main shop
in Nerrigundah, and gold from the diggings would be stored


in Mr. Pollock’s safe. Jock hurried away, but had not gone
far when he found that he was being followed by the boy.
Not realising the dangers ahead, he gave way to the child’s
pleadings to be allowed to accompany him.
It was almost dusk when they reached the store, and
they were too late to warn the storekeeper, for in front of
the little building were five men on horses, each wearing a
black mask over his face and holding a gun. Two of the
men left their horses and walked into the store, where the
storekeeper and his young wife stood at the counter.
“Put your hands well up!” said one of the bushrangers
to the storekeeper; “and you,” he said, turning to the wife,
“hand over the keys of your safe, or whatever money and
gold you have here.”
She took the keys from a pocket in her dress, looked
first at the armed men and then on through the open door,
where the light from the store lit the roadway. Here she
saw the little boy and Jock standing in the shadows.
Quickly she threw the keys out almost at the feet of the
boy, who jumped forward pressing his foot firmly on them
to bury them in the mud.
In an instant Jock was surrounded by armed men. One
of them, however, remained in the store, pointing his gun at
the storekeeper and calling loudly to the other bushrangers:
“If you cannot find the keys, I will shoot this man and his
wife.” The boy watched the bushrangers search for the
keys, which he knew were still under his feet in the mud.
“Here,” said one of them, handing a lantern to Jock,
“hold this well up and keep still.”
The outlaws, searching desperately for the lost keys,
were not concerned about a little boy who seemed very much
afraid and bewildered, so he was not missed when he edged
away from the store out of sight. Barney was really very
scared, but felt quite confident that if he could find his
friend, the policeman, everything would be all right, as it
always was at the end of O’Grady’s stories. His feet sank
into the soft mud as he commenced to run as hard as his
little legs could carry him. He was making for the Police
camp, and it seemed a long way to the clearing where he
could see the camp tents. He started to shout, “Mr.


O’Grady! Mr. O’Grady! Quick! Mr. O’Grady!” He was so
puffed after his long run that his voice was very weak, and
he was among the tents before he was heard.
“Here, sonny! I’m in bed,” called O’Grady. The other
policemen had gone to Eurobodalla to investigate a black-
fellow’s story that the bushrangers were camped in that
locality. O’Grady, who was very ill with typhoid fever, had
to remain at the Police camp.
Barney peeped through the tent opening and saw his
friend, looking very sick, lying on a stretcher. Excitedly he
told the young policeman what had happened.
“Help me with my clothes, son!” he said. “I must get
there as quickly as I can.” Hurriedly O’Grady dressed,
and telling the boy he had better make for home, started off
for the store. However, Barney was curious and hastened
after his friend, keeping, like the policeman, well among the
trees. The boy was soon near enough to see that the out-
laws were still in front of the store, searching for the keys,
and were now* forcing the storekeeper and his wife to help
look for them.
O’Grady, who had now arrived, stood partly hidden
near an old fence post. He lifted his gun and fired at the
bushrangers. One of them fell dead beside old Jock, who
still held the lantern. The others turned, and before O’Grady
could lift his gun again they each fired in his direction.
The bullets found their mark, and gallant Miles O’Grady
staggered and fell mortally wounded near the terrified child.
The bushrangers, thinking that other policemen were
near, mounted their horses and galloped off. Their escape
was short-lived, however, for soon afterwards they were
caught and punished for their misdeeds.
Barney and the people of the little town mourned
O’Grady, for he was well known and well liked. Even as an
old man Barney never forgot his friend and hero, and regu-
larly attended to the monument.
Since writing this story Barney has crossed the “Great
Divide” to join O’Grady. I like to think of them up there,
perhaps riding together, or sitting on a sliprail, telling each
other stories, or swopping reminiscences of Nerrigundah
and the Gulf Diggings in 1866.


“BALMERINGA”
WOULD like to tell you this story because it is
true, though I hesitated about writing it. The
part I want you to remember is that our Blacks
were a harmless, inoffensive people, anxious to
please the strange white man, whom they found
difficult to understand. As a people they never forgot those
who showed them the slightest kindness.
One of the Pioneer Settlers in the Eurobodalla District
of New South Wales was allotted by the Government ten
ticket-of-leave men (convicts who, because of good be-
haviour, were allowed to work for settlers), and one of them,
a tall red-headed fellow, had “gone bush,” as the blacks say.
The settler was responsible for them all and was very wor-
ried when he found that one had disappeared. He and some
of the other men at “Balmeringa”—the homestead—rode
miles and could find no trace of him. So the Settler spoke to
the blackfellows, who frequently came to the house with
gifts of fish and skins for “Him Boss” (the Settler) and
“My Dear” (his wife). The Settler always addressed his
wife as “My Dear,” and the blacks were quick to catch the
name.
“Now, Bingo Bingo, you go get me fellow like this chap
and bring him back,” said the Settler as he placed his hand
on the red head of a tall ex-convict. Bingo nodded, and
making queer noises to let the Settler know that he under-
stood, darted off into the bush.
The blacks were away two weeks and returned with
their women and children. They squatted close together
near the wood-heap, waiting for “Him Boss,” who presently
came out to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine his
horror when Bingo let fall from a wallaby skin the head of
the escaped man. The Settler hastened inside and told his
wife what had happened. He realised that he had made a
mistake in touching the head of the convict who resembled
the escaped man.
“Oh,” he said, “they thought I wanted only his head. I


must make them understand that it is wrong to kill. When
I call you, you will have to come out and beg me to let them
go. He returned to the blacks and beckoned the men aside.
“Bermagui! Bermagui!” called Bingo, trying to make
the Settler understand that they had caught the escaped
man miles away at Bermagui.
“No! No! No!” shouted the Settler, shaking his head
and looking angry. “You kill, you die! See,” he said, holding
a piece of rope in his hand and placing it around Bingo’s
neck. He pulled it tightly so that Bingo’s eyes bulged and
his mouth opened wide. “See!” he said again, taking Bingo
under the gallows that were used when cattle were killed.
The blackfellows had seen a beast hang from the gallows
and knew at once what he meant. They all began to wail
and cry—men, women and children.
“My Dear!” called the Settler, and his wife came
hurrying from the house. She walked up to Bingo and acted
as if she were begging her husband to let him go. She took
the rope from his neck and pointed to the bush. What a
rush and a scamper! The blacks took to their heels and
quickly disappeared into a forest of gum trees.
Some time later, the Settler’s daughter, then a little
girl of five, following some wallabies, wandered away from
the house and was lost (an easy thing to happen in the
Australian bush). Her father, mother and the people at
the homestead searched for her without success for nearly
a, week. Her mother became ill with anxiety, and her father
fiad to remain with his wife while the others continued the
search.
Hearing peculiar sounds one morning, the Settler was
surprised to see the tribe of blacks again enter the yard.
He hunied out, and Bingo stepped toward him, shouting
“My Dear! My Dear!” He then pointed to his wife, a young
lubra, who nursed the little white girl in her arms. They
had found the child, hungry and exhausted, miles away.
They knew she belonged to “My Dear,” and they had fed
and kept her warm until they plucked up enough courage
to return to the home of “Him Boss” and restore the child
to her mother—their friend, “My Dear.”


BELOWRA
HOW excited we were. My father had promised to
take my brother and me with him to Belowra,
where he had some hundreds of acres of rich
grazing land. To-morrow he and two stock-riders
were going to Belowra to muster about six hundred head of
cattle to send to Moruya to be sold.
My mother did not like the idea of us going. She
thought we were too young for the long, rough ride. But
my father assured her the weather was good, that my
brother Cyril had often been with him all day in the saddle,
and that I, though only ten, was quite a good horsewoman.
(I know he said this to please me because I really wanted
to go.)
“Pat will be delighted to see the children. You will
have to take him something special,” said mother, looking
at my father, who nodded his head and smiled.
Old Pat was an Irishman who had been employed by
my father for years as a boundary rider. We loved him and
loved his visits to “Balmeringa,” our homestead, when he
rode there from Belowra, twenty-eight miles away, with the
pack-horses for fresh supplies. He always carried pets for
us in the saddle bags—a koala, a little w r allaby or an opos-
sum, bright-coloured parrots, white cockatoos, magpies,
jackasses—all were brought in turn. The parrots and cocka-
toos were sometimes taught to whistle and to talk. To hear
a bird imitate Pat’s soft Irish brogue singing lines from
‘ The Dear Little Shamrock” amused us, but I am sorry to
say his talking birds usually knew some words that dis-
pleased my mother.
We were all up bright and early, had a good breakfast,
saw that our horses were ready, that the two pack-horses
were well laden with specials for Pat, and with things
necessary for our own comfort. The two men had breakfast
earlier and started ahead of us, each leading a pack-horse.
After fond good-byes to my mother and three younger
brothers we set off. I rode on a side saddle, as in those days
even little girls thought it vulgar to ride astride, and riding
skirts w’ere rather long and had to cover the stirrup foot.


The day was beautiful. We soon left the road for a
bridle track and went miles along the Yowrie River. Here
we saw large goannas climbing trees. Some were nearly
four feet in length. They peeped at us inquisitively as we
rode along. We went up the great Barren Jumbo Mountain,
where “Rowdy,” our dog, seemed to take pleasure in dis-
turbing wallabies and kangaroos. He made some of them
almost keep pace with us as we rode on. At times Rowdy
would leave us, to return later with some strange thing in
his mouth. He once brought a large black snake held firmly
near its head between his sharp teeth. My father dis-
mounted, as he thought the dog might have been bitten, but
after inspection saw he was all right.
We came down the “Jumbo” to the beautiful Tuross
River, where the startled plovers called loudly, warning the
bush life of the approach of strangers. Here we rested,
boiled the billy and had our lunch, listening to the music of
the river and the soft sighing songs of the oaks. On the
bank quite near us my father killed a large brown tiger
snake which my brother had seen raising its head from a
tussock. When Cyril and I examined the head of this deadly
creature we saw the resemblance to a tiger.
I asked my father to coo-ee, as I could hear someone
chopping wood. But as he listened the sound changed to the
cracking of a stockwhip, and then changed again to bird
calls of the bush—the sweet note of a bell bird, the warble
of a magpie, and the chuckle of a kookaburra.
“Lyre birds!” said my father, as he followed the dog to
a clump of foliage some distance along the bank. He called
to us to follow, and with him we discovered a lyre bird’s
nest. It was on a high mound, built upon the ground and
well hidden among low foliage and bracken. One tiny bird
was in the nest. We moved away and were presently de-
lighted to see the parent birds return timidly to the young
one. The father bird had his lovely lyre-shaped tail well
•spread and extended.
It was time to move on, so remounting, we started off
again across country to the Mullion Creek. We passed an
old stump where sat two kookaburras.
“Feeding their young,” said my father, and we rode to
the stump to see them. There in a hollow were two baby


Jacks. They looked all beak and head, and as we inspected
the young ones, the mother and father birds flew into a tree
nearby and laughed and chuckled and laughed again and
again, as if to send us about our business. We rode off and
a little later a number of magpies flew at us and began to
peck at our hats and heads. They were nesting in a tall
dead gum, and they were trying to drive us away.
On we went to Mullion Creek. While we were giving
our horses a drink, a platypus darted under water past their
heads. He is a strange creature with a bill like a duck’s and
beautiful fur skin—half animal, half bird.
We were nearing Belowra when I heard something
crying, and looking up saw a koala squatting in the
branches of a gum. Near the foot of the tree was one not
long dead. “Some disease has spread among the koalas,
causing blindness, and they die,” said my father.
“How dreadful,” I said, feeling very sad as I looked at
the dear little bears.
“What’s Rowdy making the noise about?” said my
brother Cyril, trying to draw my attention to the dog so
that I might forget the koalas, and he rode to where the
dog was barking.
“Here is a wombat,” he called, and we went to look
at it—a big fellow with black hair and a little tail. It
reminded me of a pig, yet its head and long claws were like
those of a bear. Father got off his horse, sent the dog away,
and had a look at the wombat, which made no attempt to
go into a burrow. “Poor old chap,” he said, “the ticks are
giving him a bad time. We must do something for him.”
Father and Cyril went back to the creek and filled their hats
with soft dry sand. They rubbed it well into the skin of the
wombat, so that the ticks would then fall off.
We had not gone.very far when we saw the smoke from
Belowra house, and we were pleased to see it. We went
through several sliprails and at last caught sight of Pat
standing outside, waiting for us.
“Do you know, the curlews told me last night you
were coming,” said Pat as he helped us dismount.
I felt very stiff and tired. I peeped shyly at my


brother, who stood rubbing his thighs and swinging his legs
from the knees. I knew then it was quite all right for me
to be stiff and that Pat would not tease me.
We went into the house, which was built of big, rough
slabs and logs cut from the trees. The walls inside were lined
with hessian and were papered with clean newspapers—
Town & Country Journals, Sydney Mails, Bulletins, Heralds,
Telegraphs—they were all there, right side up. We could
stand anywhere and read a page or study an illustration.
The table, st«: o.s and shelves were made of bush timber;
even a couple of stretcher beds in another room consisted of
saplings and sheets of strong, stringy bark, similar to the
bark used to cover over the roof. The trees, an axe, a
hammer and a few old nails supplied everything that was
necessary in that bush dwelling.
The fireplace, where burnt a great log, was very large
and had been built from the clay of an ant mound, with a
few stones placed here and there. Hanging from an iron
bar across the fireplace were a camp oven and a small black
boiler. The camp oven was round and the lid was heaped
v/ith red coals from the fire. Pat was roasting a piece of
fiesh meat which the stockmen, who had arrived earlier,
had bi ought. In the oval-shaped boiler he was cooking what
he called “dumplings.” I think they were made of flour,
salt, suet and water. Among some very white ashes in the
fireplace were potatoes roasting in their jackets.
Having washed in a tin basin outside the door, I
changed my riding skirt and wanted to help Pat with the
tea. We set the table, using a newspaper as a cloth.
Including the stockmen there were six of us, and what a
wonderful tea we had. Potatoes roasted in the ashes, and
the dumplings, eaten with wild honey, were delicious. Pat
promised on the morrow he would bake us a damper, as
Cyril and I were to be left in his care, while father and the
men were away mustering and branding the cattle.
Next morning we were up early, and Pat let us gather
some young cobs from the corn that he had growing. We
stripped the husks and beards away and roasted them on
the hearth in front of the fire. We spread butter, pepper
and salt on them and ate the corn from the cob. They were
very tasty, and to this day I am still fond of a “roaster. v


We went for a walk in the bush with Pat, who had
quaint stories and answers about everything we saw and
inquired about. I asked why it was that some of the gum
trees had great round lumps on their trunks.
“Ah!” he said, “I’ll tell ye now. They are the trees that
sit down in the night when there is not a soul about and it
is dark. Some of them get very tired standing so long, and
sit down.”
“Why are the roots of this old tree coming out of the
ground?” I asked.
“Now that fellow 7 wanted to walk off to another spot,
so he just began to pull and pull his feet out of the ground,
but he could not get all his toes out so he has to stop there.”
“Why are the gum trees so lovely and white in places ?”
I asked.
“Hush,” he said, “that’s where the angels touch them
with their wings. The angels love the gum trees.”
“Why are the leaves of this gum tree blue?” I asked.
“Now, that’s a blue gum. The painting angel—l think
his name was Michael Angelo—didn’t clean his brushes
after painting the sky.”
Goblins, fairies, elves, will-o’-the-wisps—Pat had them
all there in the heart of the great bush.
We returned to the house, and Pat prepared to make
a damper, explaining everything to us as he mixed it.
“Now get the flour, about four handfuls,” said he, “sieve
well through your fingers into a dish and add one teaspoon-
ful of salt. Now, if you have it, a teaspoon of baking soda,
and two of cream of tartar. Mix them well through the
flour and moisten with water. Knead into a dough, then
form into a flat loaf and place on the hearth among hot
white ashes. Cover well with clean ashes and leave it there
for one hour. Then take it out and brush with bracken fern
or a towel to remove the ashes, and there is the damper.”
We had the damper for tea that night, when my father
and the men returned after mustering the cattle that were
to be taken to Moruya next morning. With the damper we
ate a piece of corned beef that Pat selected from a brine
cask where he kept the meat he had salted. He boiled
potatoes in their skins and young corn in with the meat.
After tea the men sat around the fire talking and smoking-


while my brother and I played with some cards. We went to
bed early, as the men and cattle would have to make an
early start, and we were to leave for home after breakfast.
Pat was sorry to say good-bye to us and made my
father promise to bring us out again. He made a special
damper for us to take away, and gave us a jar of wild honey.
We rode back along the Belowra Creek to the Tuross
River, and passed a camp where two men were distilling
eucalyptus oil from the leaves of a gum tree. My father
stopped, spoke to the men, and explained the process to us.
We remained there some time, and when we started
again I noticed some storm-clouds in the sky. Father said
we must hurry the horses and keep ahead of the storm.
However, we had not gone very far when big raindrops
began to fall. Thunder rumbled, with occasional lightning
flashes. My father saw a huge yellow clay ant-hill and we
rode to it. He had a look inside and saw that it was quite
hollow and had been burnt out. We left the horses tied
together under a large box tree with the dog. Then we
made for the shelter of the ant nest, an earth mound built
by termites. We could stand up quite easily inside and we
were kept dry. Father entertained us by telling us how
strong these mounds were, and what a long time they took
to build. He told us something of all the ants he knew—
bulldog ants, big fellows that hurt cruelly when they stung,
soldier ants, red ants, black ants and white ants. We did not
notice the time flying and were surprised when he said, ‘The
rain has stopped; we must move on.”
On we went until we came to the Tuross. Here we
found, instead of the clear running stream, thick muddy
water where the edges left clumps of foam clinging to the
bankg. Father stopped suddenly, looked at us both, then
said, “They have evidently had rain higher up, and the fresh
water coming down has made the river a banker. We are
going through, and you must do as I tell you.
“You sit quite still and let your horse have its head,”
he said to my brother. Then turning to me, he said, “I shall
take your bridle and you can hold the horse’s mane and the
pommel of your saddle. Don’t be frightened.”
We took our boots off and father rolled his trousers
above his knees. I folded my skirt up, then down the bank


we went into that horrid dark water, I did as I was told, but
when I saw that my brother’s horse seemed to be going side-
ways downstream I screamed. Father called to my brother:
“Let your horse swim. Don’t pull the bridle. He is making
for the bank; you are all right,”
“Oh!” I cried as I felt the feet of my horse leave the
ground, and had the dreadful sensation of a horse swimming
under me. “Oh! Oh!” I cried again as the water came up
around my waist and I could see only the head of my horse;
then all at once his feet seemed to touch something firm and
the water went down and down. We were all safe across the
river. Father dismounted, lifted us from our horses, and
kissed us both.
We boiled the billy and prepared for the road again.
Rowdy seemed anxious for us to move on; he kept running
from the horses to us. We started off and father decided
to take a short cut over the Barren Jumbo. We had gone
some miles when I thought he seemed uneasy, and I could
see no sign of Rowdy.
Presently the dog came from somewhere and ran in
front of the horses’ heads, barking and jumping at them.
Father scolded him and told him to “go behind,” which he
did, and we lost sight of him again. Suddenly we were
startled to hear him howling some distance away—long,
plaintive howls. We stopped and father said: “We are on the
wrong track and must turn back.” This we did until we
came to Rowdy sitting on the road where a track branched
off in another direction. He bounded with joy at seeing us,
and ran ahead as if to keep us on the right road.
The rest of the journey did not take so long. Once
over the Mountain, we knew the way quite well, and we
were soon home again to “Balmeringa” and to mother.


THE FINDING OF THE OPAL
Australia’s National Gem
EFORE telling my story, I would like to introduce
you to the most important person in it—Alfred
Richardson —a young boundary rider employed
on a station, out west near Wilcannia, New South
Wales. He was of a kind often met with in the
wide open spaces of Australia—a true son of the land, tall,
lean, strong-limbed. He belonged to the “Cornstalk” type,
now so often spoken of affectionately by people in
Britain. He had the clear grey eyes of Scotland, the bright
brown hair of Wales, and a skin, burnt to a healthy bronze
by the sun of the land of his birth. His cheery manner,
his generous and kind-hearted nature endeared him to
“all hands and the cook” at the station. He could sing
quite a number of songs learnt from his Scottish and Welsh
ancestors. His fiddle, brought to Australia by his grand-
father, was a much-prized possession. His concertina had
once belonged to his father, and had many a time provided
the music for the dances, held in the big barns and sheds,
“out-back.” Alfred delighted to play one, or other of these
instruments on a clear still night, when the curlews filled
the air with their mournful notes, and the voices of the
night-owls joined in duet. For Alfred loved to sit in the
moonlight and listen to those sounds and then join them
in an “Out-back Nocturne,” by “scraping a tune” on the
fiddle, or by squeezing a song from the concertina. Now
that I think you know Alfred quite well, I shall tell you the
story of the finding of the opal.
One day, Alfred Richardson, who had been out since
early morning doing the rounds of the fences, repairing
places where the kangaroos had broken through, and
gathering the stray sheep that had wandered out, was glad
to be making his way back to his hut out of the heat of the
sun. Suddenly he saw a big kangaroo make straight for
the fence, and with one great bound bring down a panel.
Alf, knowing that the sheep would make for the opening,
shouted, “Whoops! Woo-hoos!” at the top of his voice.
The startled kangaroo turned and made off again, as Alf


~ 1 '’
quickly raised his gun, took aim and fired. He saw the
kangaroo stop abruptly, and after a second, bound slowly
on. He knew that he had wounded the animal, and as he
thought the poor creature might linger for days in pain, he
left his horse to follow it and put it out of its
misery, if it were bady hurt. Seeing blood spots oh the
ground he began to follow the trail. On he went, still
gazing at the ground, until he came to what appeared to be
a dry creek bed. Here, he was surprised to see, at his feet,
something solid like a stone, containing a collection of very
beautiful colours. He picked it up. Admiring it as it
lay in his hand, he noticed that the colours seemed to be
continually changing, for brilliant crimsons, bright blues,
rich purples, lovely greens, even shades almost black were
massed together in this wonderful specimen. He discovered
several other beautiful pieces, in the shape of fossilised
shells, small bones and stones. As he filled his pockets,
wondering what he had found, his thoughts turned again
to the wounded kangaroo. He saw it some distance away
in a clump of saltbush. By moving quietly he was
able to get near enough to see that the injury was not
serious, and did not warrant his destroying the animal. He
knew that these creatures were guided by Nature, which had
a way of healing their wounds and curing their ailments.
So he left the kangaroo in peace amongst the shrubs and
returned to the damaged fence, which he repaired before
making for the homestead.
Great excitement prevailed there when he showed his
specimens. The station owner, who was on the point of
visiting Sydney, took the specimens with him when he went


to the city. The stones were shown to many people, in-
cluding gem experts and geologists, w r ho declared them to
be precious stones, containing the most beautiful colours in
the world, and on account of their opalescense, the gems
were given the name of opal.
Scientists accounted for the formation of the opal in this
way: At one time in the centre of Australia there was an
inland sea, which dried up so quickly that the sun’s rays
became imprisoned in objects that were rapidly fossilised—
hence the opal.
As in the “Gold Rushes” of earlier days in Australia,
men, hearing of the opals, journeyed out in hundreds to
Wilcannia and White Cliffs, to gather them. The opals were
in great demand and were quickly sold, until some unscrup-
ulous buyers for foreign markets arrived. These men said
that the stones were of little value—that similar stones were
plentiful in parts of Europe. So, by sheer bluff, they per-
suaded men to sell their opals at twenty-one shillings a
kerosene tin full. The opals were sent to Europe, with the
result that the continent became glutted with our beautiful
gem.
Some diamond merchants, seeing that the opal was be-
coming a fashionable and popular jewel, and fearing that
the diamond might lose some of its value, spread a rumour
that the opal was a very unlucky stone, and that
misfortune befell those who wore it. Many people in
those days had strange, superstitious fears and fancies, so
it was easy to make them believe this. Why! even to-day,
some people believe that an old horse-shoe is a token of
good luck. To see a four-leafed clover, a ■white horse, or a
black cat, to wear a garment by chance inside out, these are
just a few of the good luck omens that I remember.
You can understand how’ easy it was fifty years ago,
for unscrupulous men to spread their rumours and play
upon the fancies of people, by insisting that the opal was
a very unlucky stone. But let me assure you, there is not
a more beautiful gem in the world than the opal, nor one
that can reflect better the changing moods, the wealth, the
delights, the 'warmth, the depths of our wonderful country.
It is a gem formed and worn in the very heart of Australia.
As for luck—well, I consider that we, who like the opal,
belong to Australia, are the luckiest people in the world.


THE BUSH FIRE
HAVE you even seen a bush fire? Have you even
taken your place with the fire-fighters and out-
fought this demon of the bush?
I well remember the bush fire in January, 1906.
I was not long home from school in Sydney, The season
had been exceptionally good; great paddocks of potatoes, of
com and of fodder for stock were almost ready to harvest;
there was grass in plenty; there were well filled bams. The
motor car and the motion picture were in their infancy.
The radio was then an unheard of invention. We, “of the
bush,” in the early days of this century were unable to re-
ceive warning messages, as the people do to-day.
One hot sultry morning, my father received word that
bush fires were endangering the well stocked grazing land
he owned at Belowra. So, taking with him all the available
men and my eldest brother, he set out to fight the fire which
threatened to destroy his property.
Some hours later, we at home received a “bushman’s
warning” that a fire was nearing us. The scent of burnt
eucalyptus leaves and a thick smoke haze in the sky were
the first S.O.S. signals, and my mother, who had been tend-
ing some plants in the garden, instantly recognised these
danger signs.
My grandmother, a gentle old lady, who had just cele-
brated her eightieth birthday, sat in an easy chair darning;
Mary was preparing dinner. Mother told us that the fire
was getting closer. She carefully instructed us all about
what we must do. My grandmother was to take my small
brothers down to the river and, if necessary, to keep them
in the water. She was to use wet blankets to cover their
heads in case the flames leapt across the river. Soon my
grandmother set off, while mother bade me help her let
the stock loose.
We went first to the pig paddocks and sties, and with
an axe, mother quickly loosened rails and panels, letting the
pigs out. Instinctively they made straight for the river.
We then opened gates, cut wires, removed rails and set every
living thing free—fowls, geese, turkeys, cows and horses.


Some workmen, who were building a new road nearby,
knowing my father had ridden away and realising that we
were a household of women and children, came quickly to
help us. They set to work immediately to prepare a “fire-
break” (a chipped clearing, two or three yards wide) near
barns and other places to which they thought the fire was
likely to spread.
My next task was to collect buckets, and drinking
utensils from the house. When I entered the kitchen I was
amazed to see there parrots, magpies, and a number of
strange birds which were perched upon articles of furniture.
In the garden outside was a mob of wallabies. Instinct
seemed to drive them to the abode of man for protection.
The fire travelled quickly and we could see it on the
other side of the river. Great flames reached the tops of
the tall trees. The scorching wind carried hot cinders and
burning leaves to us. Clouds of rolling, suffocating smoke
enveloped us as the fire came with a leap, bounding across
to our side of the Tuross River.
I ran with my buckets and cups as the men, mother
and Mary went to meet the flames that were sweeping along
the grass and leaping from tree to tree. They beat the fire


with wet bags and thick green bushes that had been cut
earlier in case of an emergency. When I was not giving a
drink or throwing water over someone’s head I, too, had to
beat with a bush and watch for sparks that might set some-
thing else alight.
The flames, the heat, and the smoke were unbearable.
Mother was my main thought and worry. Her face was
smeared and blackened with ashes. Her eyes were swollen
and red. Her hair w r as singed, and holes were burnt in her
clothing. A look at mother made me beat the harder with
my bush and run the quicker to refill my buckets.
How those men worked! The great spirit of “mate-
ship” that exists in Australia was there. They fought the
fire until they knew that our home—“Balmeringa”—was
safe. A forty-acre paddock of ripe corn and acres of
potatoes had been destroyed.
Mary, grimy and ash-smeared, went to the house to
make tea for everybody, while the men watched the fire.
I ran to my mother, who was making her way over* the
burnt and scorched ground to the river. She called,
“Gran! Where are you?”
We found her—in the river with my small brothers and
the damp blankets. The lovely lace cap which she always
wore was very wet and was still pinned to her hair, though
it had slipped somewhat to one side of her head. Sharing
their “safety zone,” the river, was a strange collection of
live stock, dogs, pigs, cattle, horses, some turkeys, and a
few stray fowls. Gran, was distressed because the geese
and ducks had sailed off down stream.
When Gran, came from the water with her charges, her
dear old eyes filled with tears and looking heavenward, she
said, “Thanks be to God for His care and protection.” That
night, while the trees still smouldered and the bush had the
appearance of a well-lit city, Gran, led our quiet and grateful
home circle in family prayers.


THE FLOOD
S a young girl, I saw the three menaces to bush
life—fire, drought, and flood. The bush fire
filled me with a terrible fear, the drought, with
a silent sadness. But the flood, as it surged
along, excited me, for it was something grand.
It was difficult to realise the aftermath or the havoc so often
caused by it.
When only a little girl, I remember once standing with
my brothers watching a flood. The ugly dark waters, and
the great masses of soiled lathery foam, caused me to
believe that all the people, for miles and miles higher up the
river, were doing their washing—a very grubby washing,
needing large quantities of soap. I could not find any other
reason to explain how a river, like the Tuross, usually so
clean and clear, became so soiled and soapy.
We watched the waters creep higher and higher, gradu-
ally covering the cultivation flats. We shouted with excite-
ment when we saw trees, huge logs, parts of fences and
bridges floating by. We became quiet and anxious when a
roof, a shed, part of a house, a table and some chairs in


various positions sailed past. He clapped our hands when
we saw some geese and ducks glide gracefully by, as if
nothing were amiss. We cried when we saw fowls, poor
frightened creatures, vainly trying to get a perch-hold on
to something, as they were being carried away. When we
saw a horse swimming desperately and battling against the
current, we called for father. He quickly recognised the
animal, for the men of the bush know, not only their
neighbours, but their neighbours’ horses and dogs. .
The horse belonged to Willie Murphy, living higher up
the river. Father, fearing some accident had happened (as
it is a very unusual thing for a horse to be caught in a
stream, unless ridden there by someone), hurried out in
the heavy rain. After some hours he returned with Willie
Murphy, whom he had rescued. Willie had been caught
in the fork of a dislodged tree and his life had been saved
by the continual whimpering and barking of his dog,
“Rusty,” which attracted father’s attention. My father,
with the aid of his “Bush Medical Outfit,” dressed and set
Willie’s leg. The nearest doctor lived forty miles away,
and in the old “horse and buggy” days such a journey to
attend a patient was not possible.
Laddie, Willie’s horse, found his way home, cut, bruised
and scratched, without saddle or bridle. How he managed
to escape from the flood waters he alone knew. He could
never be induced to enter the water again.
NATURE’S BOOK
Go! brood awhile with Nature’s book,
In some secluded lovely nook,
And thinking, feel the gentle breeze,
That stirs the flowers and leafy trees.
Let mind and feelings wander wide
Where God in Nature doth abide,
And then in thought, just range afar
In Fancy’s unrestricted car.
When Nature has so much to give
It is indeed a joy to live;
And Nature, holding nothing back,
Should spur us onward—up the track.


I
THREE POEMS OF
AUSTRALIAN TREES


y


TREES—OUR TREES
The trees —our trees, I dreamt that I
Was midst the trees last night;
I saw them all, our lovely trees,
In rays of silver light.
A WATTLE, like a regal dame
Upon a mossy throne,
Wore crown of golden fluffy blooms,
And queen-like, reigned alone.
Quite near her stood the BUSHLAND KING
A BLUE GUM, stately, tall;
From tips of red, round royal head,
I saw the dewdrops fall.
THE CHRISTMAS BUSH was well adorned
With tiny crimson flow’rs.
A SHADY BOX wore his gems too—
The gleaming drops from show’rs.
THE CEDAR, TURPENTINE and PINE,
Each beautiful to see,
Were standing near a KURRAJONG
(A very useful tree).
THE CORAL, FLAME, and SILKY OAK
Their gayest blooms revealed.
THE MOUNTAIN ASH and BUNYA TREES
In shadows were concealed.
THE SHE-OAK with her pretty cones
Was swaying in the air;
Her mirrored form in crystal pool
Displayed her beauty rare.
The LILLIPILLI and GEEBUNG
Held ripe and tasty fruits.
A SHADY FlG—the MORETON BAY,
Had stout and hoary roots.
A SANDALWOOD, a QUONDONG TREE
Held berries ripe and red;
The NATIVE CHERRY with her fruits
The little birds had fed.


The MULGA, MYALL and MALLEE,
I knew, without a doubt,
Were trees that fed and quenched the thirst
Of stock in time of drought.
The DWARF—a pretty APPLE TREE,
Was standing firmly there;
And with his arms entwining hers
I saw the NATIVE PEAR.
A MANGROVE from the river shore
(A sage from tidal bed)
Was stretching out his twisted limbs
And lifting frowsy head.
A TREE FERN small and rather shy
Held out a leafy arm;
And waved it gently to and fro
To greet a CABBAGE PALM.
The BLACKBUTT and OLD IRON BARK,
Two fellows tough and strong,
Invited all the other trees
To join them in a song.
The TI-TREE in a paper coat
Prepared to take a rest;
With red drops oozing from his bark
A BLOODWOOD puffed his chest.
The BANKSIA in glad array,
Cried, “Friends! sing if you can,
The wood-wind music of the trees
Has given joy to man.”
The blossoms lifted sleepy heads
And formed a fairy ring,
When to the music of the breeze
The trees began to sing.
On little mushroom tables white,
They spread refreshments, nice;
Sweet manna, gum and honey fell
With dew as cold as ice.
And when I went to taste their fare,
A merry little beam,
Sent by the Man Who’s in the Moon,
Aroused me from my dream.


THE OLD BLUE GUM
Near my old home there is a tree,
One I have known since I was three,
And when I thought I’d grown quite big,
My height was measured with its twig.
The ’possums, furr’d in grey and brown.
Have made a pathway, up and down;
And hidden ’neath a curly root,
There dwells a little bandicoot.
From out its branches in the Spring
The baby birds are taught to sing;
And from the boughs, the blossoms rare
With fragrance sweet perfume the air.
There is a place, just near the butt,
Where years ago my name was cut;
In scrawling letters on that tree
A sweetheart chiselled M and G.
And now that I am apt to roam,
That dear old tree still stands at home,
Protecting, caring, useful, strong,
A tree that fills my heart with song.


THE GUM TREE’S STORY
While dozing ’neath an old Gum Tree,
I fancied that it said to me,
“Bird, beast and man, and insect small,
I give them life and love them all.”
On little twigs this Spring I grew
Some fluffy blooms of tender hue,
And when they fell came cups so rare,
With fragrance sweet to fill the air.
An oil my leaves doth hold in store,
That giveth health (who asketh more?)
While those that fall enrich the mould,
Where Flora’s beauteous blooms unfold.
Grey Kangaroos steal from the glade
To frolic in my welcome shade;
Pert ’Possums round my branches roam
In hollow limbs to find a home.
On moonlight nights the Native Bears
On branches squat beside their lairs;
And Wombats, Moles and Bandicoots
Are wont to burrow ’midst my roots.
The birds I call from far away,
My strong arms wait their nesting day,
In unison or one by one,
With me the songsters greet the sun.
From topmost branches, hailing dawn,
The Kookaburra’s laugh is borne,
And with it too, there gently floats,
A Magpie’s sweet melodious notes.
At evening when the night shades fall,
Bright insects to my shelter crawl.
A gay Cicada, shrill of song,
Doth hug my bark the summer long.
And with him sings a busy Bee
That gathers honey sweet from me.
The tiny Ant in gravel bed,
Is often with my manna fed.


w
The Black Man found in me a friend,
His many wants I did attend;
With bark he sheltered from the breeze,
In modest gunyah ’neath the trees.
His boomerang, so made to swerve,
From out my timbers took its curve;
In life I do what good I can,
In death supply the needs of man.
A summer moon’s enchanted beam
Aroused me gently from my dream;
And revTently I kissed the tree
That meant so much to God and me.


WORTH LOVING
I love a rugged hillside,
Where cliffs are gaunt and steep,
The tousled shrubs that grow there,
The vines that twine and creep.
A clump of mossy carpet
On rocky stair to see,
The young and tender leaves, that
Adorn a broken tree.
I love a tangled gully,
To hear the wild birds call,
To watch a surging river,
Or tumbling water fall.
To hear the booming music
Resounding from a cave,
When lashing in its fury,
Imprison’d is a wave.
I love a golden sunset,
That gilds the barren plain,
The pretty patch of blue sky
That follows storm and rain,
The stars that faintly glimmer,
The moon when old or new,
The mists, the evening shadows,
All these I love—and you.

BY AM AH AND HIS MOUNTAIN
How the Fish Came Into Our Seas
YAM AH —the Great Spirit of the Ranges, lived on
AtJL the highest of the mountain peaks in the Southern
Alps, on the mountain known as Kosciusko, one of
the oldest mountains in the world.
Byamah gloried in his dwelling place. He loved to
lift his head from the summit (his “look-out”) and gaze in
every direction upon the beautiful country surrounding him.
At his feet flowed a winding river, like a silver ribbon, on
and on through rich country, until it reached the sea—a
river fed by the snow blankets that covered him during the
winter months. He bathed in the gentle spring showers.
He dried and warmed himself in the summer sun, and in the
autumn his hair was trimmed and combed by the winds.
He was indeed happy and contented.
For part of the year his mountain home was covered
by a thick blue-green carpet of snow grass. The splashes
of brilliant colour, made by the many shapes and shades of


beautiful wild flowers, formed lovely patterns. He was
very proud of this magnificent carpet. It pleased him to
see the emus, kangaroos and other bird and animal friends
play upon it.
At the foot of the hills, not far from Byamah, in the
seclusion of wonderful lime-stone caves, lived another
Spirit, called Yarrango. His home was like a magician’s,
containing the riches and beauties of Aladdin’s Palace.
Furniture, fittings, drapery, statuary and jewels were all
there, in shades of delicate pink and in glistening white.
He was protected from the snow, the rain, the sun and the
wind. But he was jealous of Byamah—jealous of his beau-
tiful carpet, so he schemed how to destroy it. With a
churinga (a sacred stick, which when swung in the air
makes a loud noise like a human voice), he called the tribes
from the valleys and the plains. He told them to go to the
mountain of Byamah and play and dance upon the carpet
spread for them there. They w r ere to enjoy a great feast of
yams, sweet grass-roots and stalk juices that Byamah had
planted for them beneath the carpet.
The tribes, coming from all directions, were delighted
when they heard this, and made their way to the great
mountain. They frolicked, and danced and tumbled. They
destroyed the floral patches; and while looking for yams,
sweet-roots and syrup plants they tore up the grassy
threads, so that the carpet was completely destroyed. When
they had finished eating and were tired of playing, they re-
turned to their homes.
Byamah, as he lifted his head from the summit, saw
what had happened and he was angry—so angry that
a dark cloud settled upon his brow. He wept tears that did
not fall upon the torn and bruised sides of the mountain,
but into a hollow near the top and made a Blue Lake. He
vowed that if the tribes ever returned and destroyed his
carpet he would punish them, so that they would not come
back again.
With the aid of the wind, the rain and the sun, he began
to repair the great carpet. After months and months of
hard toil it looked very beautiful, and Byamah was satisfied
and happy.
Yarrango, knowing the carpet had been destroyed,


chuckled, quite pleased with himself within his magic cave.
But when he heard that it had been repaired and was more
beautiful than ever, he again became jealous and decided
to call the tribes once more to the mountain. The tribes,
pleased to hear again the call of the sacred stick, churinga,
set out from their homes, thinking of the feast and the fun
in store for them.
They all arrived—men, women and children—and they
acted as they had done before, tearing, destroying, uproot-
ing everything in their way as they played and feasted.
Byamah, hearing the laughter and shrieks of joy, peered


from the mountain-top and was horrified to see the destruc-
tion wrought again upon his beautiful carpet.
He became furious and trembled with rage. He filled
his lungs with air and began to breathe with all his might,
until the winds came, uprooting trees and loosening stones.
As he shook himself, the thunder rumbled and crashed;
as he blinked his eyes, the lightning flashed across the sky,
sometimes touching the earth. As he tossed his head the
dark cloud fell from his brow and the rain came down in
torrents, accompanied by bullet-like hail, that beat as it fell.
Down, down, down, the great sides of the mountain
rushed a mighty stream, taking the tribes with it—men,
women and children. They screamed and tried to save
themselves, clutching, and grabbing at anything, or anyone,
for help. But they were swept on and on into the surging
river. They were jostled, bumped, battered and crushed.
Stones, tree-trunks and roots tumbled after them and over
them, and still they were carried on. At last the roar of
the sea could be heard and the “boom! boom!” of the waves,
waiting to collect them.
When they reached the sea, the great foaming waves
fought for them and they were wrapped and rolled
and carried far out, well below the surface. They could not
breathe and the salt of the sea made them feel very strange.
As they looked at each other they realised that they had
changed, that their bodies were of queer shapes and of
different sizes, and that they were no longer human beings,
but fish! One little fellow, whom a great rock had rolled
on and flattened, was now a poor little sole; another whose
nose had been broken, became a schnapper; and another,
whose head had been flattened by a tree-root, was a flathead.
A plump fellow became a porpoise; a greedy fellow a shark.
They were all there—fish of every kind, corresponding to
the battered shape of their bodies when they reached the
sea. They would never walk or breathe on land again, they
must live forever in the sea.
Yarrango, the Spirit of the Cave, realised that when
the tribes did not return to their homes he was guilty of a
great crime. He asked Byamah to forgive him. This
Byamah did.
Byamah also grieved for what he himself had done,


t f * fH» " - ' fm

[' r Sjs&S | ff :
and by way of atonement, he decided that his great moun-
tain home should become for man one of Nature’s play-
grounds. It is now named Mount Koscuisko. Yarrango
opened his cave-heart, that man may now go to see, and
marvel at the wonders of Nature in his Lime-stone
Mansions—the Yarrangobilly Caves.

WYAMEE AND THE MEDICINE MAN
GOOD and wise old lubra, named Wyamee,
whose back was bent and mis-shapen through
age and years of toil, loved Narelle, the young
wife of the great chief, Narooma. Wyamee
knew that Narooma was disappointed and
angry because Narelle had given birth to a daughter instead
of the son that Cobargo, the medicine man, had promised.
She feared some harm might befall the child, so, hiding
amongst some tree ferns, she listened to the conversation
carried on between
Narooma and the
medicine man,
whom he had sum-
moned to explain
the event.
She heard Co-
bargo, the oldest
man in the tribe,
chant a few words,
and she saw him
dance around in a
circle, holding a
medicine stick
firmly in his hands,
and then squat
upon the ground.
She heard him wail
plaintively like a
curlew, saying,
“The Spirit of the
Trees did not send
you a son. No! he
did not send you a
Cobargo, the Medicine Man.
son because Narelle had displeased him. The Evil
Mistletoe, an enemy of the trees, sent you a daughter. This
child must be taken from the tribe, when the moon is but
an infant and cannot give her protection.”
She heard Narooma say, “It shall be so; then I may
have a son.”


Now, old Wyamee, hearing this, hastened to the gunyah
where Narelle rested, to tell her what she had heard.
Narelle, fearing for the safety of the child, besought
Wyamee to help her, by seeking the protection of the Spirit
of the Hills for the infant.
That evening old Wyamee, gazing at the moon, spoke
softly to her in the tones of a lullaby, as she nursed the
baby in her arms. “Great Mother of the Night,” she said,
“whose children are the myriad stars, this child who has
come to earth needs your protection.”
She heard the whispered answer from the moon when
an air breath stirred the leaves of the trees, “Fear not; she
shall have protection.” The faithful old Wyamee smiled,
and holding the child closer in her arms, bowed her head
nine times to the moon.
Next morning, Wyamee, who had stripped a soft shawl
of paper bark from the trunk of a ti-tree, wrapped it around
the infant, and accompanied by Narelle, took it to the river
to bathe. They let the gentle stream ripple over the tiny
body. Then, having spread the bark shawl on a sandbank
under some shady trees, they placed the sleeping child upon
it. Wyamee, seeing two kookaburras sitting in a tree,
said to them, “You of the bird-world, watch and give warn-
ing of danger should I not be near.”
With Narelle she returned to the river, where the
stream was narrow. She set a reed trap to try to catch a
fish or an eel, while Narelle gathered the edible roots of
water plants. Suddenly a call came from the kookaburras.
Old Wyamee, hastening from the water, saw Narooma, the
chief, standing among the trees, gazing at the child. As
she approached, he called to her, “Woman, whose child is
this?”
“If you do not know, then I will tell you,” she said.
“The child is the first born of a great family—a woman
child sent that she may care for the brothers who come
after her. She is blessed by the mighty ones, by the Spirit
of the Hills, where the rivers begin to flow; by the Spirit of
the Sun-god, whose ray-arms collect the moisture to build
the cloud banks; by the Spirit of the Great-night-light, the
moon, who sometimes plays at hide and seek behind a
cloudy veil.”


*
mm \
“The child is indeed blessed,” said Narooma; “bring the
mother to me that I may see her.”
Wyamee hastened to Narelle, who, though she was
afraid, returned with her. Narooma, surprised to see his
wife, asked what she was doing there. Narelle explained
that he had sent for her, as she was the mother of the child.
Hearing this, he became angry and told Wyamee to take
the baby away. Then he turned to Narelle and said, “Be-
cause you, my wife, have displeased the Spirit of the Trees,
I have no son. This girl-
child must go, the Wise
One has said so ”
“The trees are not angry
with me, for I love them,
and I know that we could
not live without them,”
said Narelle. “The wicked
medicine man would have
you harm my baby. The
Great Spirits have joined
together to protect her, and
all those who love her; so,
I warn you—her father.”
“Take heed, Narelle!”
said Narooma. “When the
moon is new, I shall send a
warrior for the child, and
she must be delivered to
me.”
Narelle returned with
Wyamee and the child to
the gunyah beneath the
Narooma. the Great Chief.
shady trees. Wyamee
knew that the moon was waning and that it was time for her
to consult the Spirit of the Hills; so, she went to a secret-
hiding place and began to paint her body in weird designs
with ochre and white clay. With a fine reed she bound her
hair till she looked like a warrior. She collected a
boomerang, a spear and a shield that had once, long ago,
belonged to her father. Then she set forth, chanting a
song to the Spirit of the Hills.

Some of Narooma’s warriors, who were hunting for
opossums in the moonlight, as there was a drought and food
was scarce, seeing old Wyamee, called out, “Who goes
there? Who speaks with the Spirit of the Hills?”
Wyamee stood still for a few seconds, and then quickly
decided that she must act if she wished to save the child
and, perhaps, herself, “I am an old one,” she answered, dis-
guising her voice and partly hiding herself behind the shield.
“I shall soon journey beyond the hills, so I speak to them.
What would you with me, for I have much knowledge?”
“Wise old one! you must indeed be a medicine man.
Tell us, are you older and greater than Cobargo?” asked
one of the warriors, as they stood and raised their arms in
salutation.
“I am much older, and I will tell you many things,”
answered Wyamee. “Long has the land been dry; to-
morrow rain will fall and the earth, well watered, will again
provide good food for the tribe. The moon will veil her
face for several nights as a warning, that men must not
wage war against the weak and the young. Cobargo would
have the Spirits believe that Narooma and his warriors are
such men—cow T ards, who attack the defenceless.”


“Great old one! what you say is true. Come with Us
to Narooma, our chief,” said one of the warriors; “we shall
tell him of your wise sayings.”
“No; not now! for I still have much to learn from the
hills, but you will see me again, when the moon shines clear
and calm in the Heavens. Go! tell your chief to fill his
mind with noble thoughts and his heart with love and
kindness.”
Wyamee continued her chant to the hills, as she
watched the men disappear. Then she hurried back to her
hiding-place, removed the paint, unbound her hair and
waited until dawn before she returned to the gunyah.
When morning came, she was delighted to hear the patter
of rain and the voice of a warrior shouting, “Coo-ee!
Coo-ee! The rain! The rain has come! as the wise old
one has said.”
It rained for several days and at night the moon and
stars remained hidden by the heavy grey clouds. The
warriors went to Cobargo, the medicine man, and told him
that they had found a man older and wiser than he. They
declared that he was a wisher of evil, a bringer of trouble
to the tribe and that he must journey on. Cobargo became
alarmed and said that he must first see the wise man.
The rain stopped and upon the refreshed earth the sun
shone in all his glory. Wyamee, fearing the night would be
cloudless, went long before dusk to her hiding-place. She
again painted and decorated her body and head, collected
her weapons and shield, and waited for the moon to appear.
Then she set out to meet the warriors. She was surprised
to find Narooma and Cobargo, the medicine man, with them,'
and hoped they would not recognise her through her
disguise.
The warriors threw their weapons on the ground and
began a ceremonial dance in honour of the Wise Old Man.
Narooma stood watching, while Cobargo squatted on the
ground. When the dance ended, Narooma said, “Old one!
through you the Spirits gave us the long wanted rain. My
warriors tell me that your sayings are good and wise.”
“Great Chief! wisdom and truth come mostly from the
mouths of the young and the innocent,” said Wyamee. “We
the old ones, who are climbing the last lap of life’s roadway,

fear the young and the strong. A child has been sent to
you, who will possess beauty and wisdom, because she is the
daughter of a good mother and a brave father. Through
her blessings will fall upon the land and its people, and she
will be much loved.”
“Foolish one!” cried Cobargo; “that child was sent by a
mistletoe parasite, which feeds upon the arms of the trees,
therefore, this child, unwanted by her father, must be sent

ceremonial dance in honour of the Wise Old Man.
out, that she, like the mistletoe, may become a parasite of
a strange family, or die. As for me, I fear not the young,
for age alone brings wisdom.”
“Wicked one!” said Wyamee, “age has filled you with
unkind thoughts and wishes. I, who am much older, have
only love in my heart for all. You wish harm to the child
and you will surely die.”


Cobargo, moving nearer to a clump of tussocks, began
to cry plaintively like the curlew, “The child must go! The
child must go! The child shall die!”
Wyamee, watching him, was suddenly startled to see
a brown snake lifting its head slowly from a tussock quite
near him. “See!” she cried; “a snake has come to kill you.
I am very old, but the Spirits have given strength to my
arms. I will destroy the snake before it strikes you with
its deadly fangs.”
Cobargo, seeing the snake, was almost paralysed with
fear and could not move, while Wyamee staring at it, began
to use her fingers and hands to attract its attention as she
moved towards it. Narooma, stepping forward quickly,
seized her arms and held them, saying, “No! old one, if
Cobargo is good and wise, he fears not a snake.”
Wyamee, breaking away from Narooma, sprang at the
snake, seized it firmly in her hands, just below the head, and
with her long, lean fingers, pressed hard, until she knew the
snake was dead. Then, swinging it by the tail, she broke
its back and threw it away.
The warriors gave a cheer for such bravery; but Co-
bargo, feeling jealous and angry, began to laugh loudly,
saying, “Foolish old one! the snake would not harm me. I
feared not; you had no need to kill it on my account.”
Wyamee quickly retorted, as she saw another snake
rise from the tussocks, “Protect yourself from its mate.
See! she is now poised behind you ready to strike. She has
a nest amongst the tussocks.”
Old Cobargo, terrified, began to wave his arms about
to frighten the snake, but, standing almost on the tip of its
tail, as snakes do when angry, it struck at him several times
with its deadly fangs.
As he lay dying with the snake stretched across his
body, old Wyamee bowed her head and said, “It is thus, that
an evil one claims the wicked even in death.”
“Good old one,” said Narooma, “you, whose back is bent
and whose arms are withered like those of an old woman,
you have saved us from doing a great wrong; you must
come with me to my wife, Narelle, and my little daughter.”
“Not so, great Chief, I must return to the hills,”
said Wyamee. “Go to Narelle and tell her that you thank


+ **** ***** ' * Vf *’&rmm€d**Y. 7 Hfcd’TS/t*
the Great Spirit for the child He has given you, and that
you will receive with love and gratitude any children He
may send you in the future. The Spirits have blessed you.
The tribe will live in peace and happiness in a land of plenty.
I must journey on.”
Old Wyamee walked on alone. She would not turn
back, for her work was finished. On, on she went, until one
evening, looking at the sky, she saw that the moon was new.
She was not afraid, she knew that all was well with the
tribe, so she settled herself amongst the tall grasses to
sleep; and she slept the long, long sleep from which she did
not waken. The leaves that fell and the wind-blown soil
eventually covered her body with a massive mound.
The birds and the winds carried seeds thither, and to-
day her grave, where grows an abundance of beautiful trees,
ferns and wild flowers, is the great Hill, standing alone at
Tilba Tilba, on the South Coast of New South Wales. This
Hill, known as Mount Dromedary, was named so on account
of its shape; but the hump on the hill, so like that of a
Dromedary, was caused by the age-old bend in the humped
back of the good old Wyamee.

BOOMERANG
URRADOO, the medicine man, greatly feared by the
dim lZ tribe, gave a call on the sacred sound-stick, the
* Pp| churinga or bull-roarer as it is now called. He
ordered that the boys of fourteen summers should
accompany him to go through the
trials and hardships of the Bora
ceremony. Formerly, only boys
of sixteen years had been taken;
so the tribe assembled wondering
why much younger boys were
called upon to go. They knew that
the tests were severe, and that
many boys did not return from
them; those who did, lived in con-
stant fear of the medicine man and
his magic death-stick. But a
whispered word here and there
convinced them of the reason—
Burradoo wanted to get
rid of the twin sons of
Bombala, the chief of
the tribe.
These boys, named
Garra and Godarra, were
happy, laughing fellows and they were well liked.
They loved to play tricks on old Burradoo, and, by
making fun of his magic, they were often the means
of saving a victim, whom Burradoo, with his magic
stick had pointed out for death. So Burradoo
made up his mind to get rid of the twins, and
as the Bora ceremony was looked upon as a sacred one, he
knew that the parents could not refuse to allow their sons
to go with him. The boys assembled and waited, while
their mothers, in tears, begged old Burradoo to bring them
safely back.
Now Garra and Godarra, who were very much alike,
thought that the old fellow was planning some mischief, so
they agreed that one of them should act for both. Garra


was to move quickly and, changing his position, was to act
for his brother. Godarra was to follow and watch, giving
warning and help, unseen by Burradoo.
Having made sure that the twins were there, Burradoo
gave the following instructions to the boys, “You must not
eat, drink, rest, or sleep, unless I give you permission.
You must collect food for me, the medicine man; wait on
me, and obey me. You must be prepared for special tests
of endurance. You must not break the law of the Bora
ceremony. Anyone who breaks that law will die.”
Garra, seeing that the boys were somewhat alarmed
at this speech, whispered to them not to fear, for he and
Godarra were going to see that they came safely back to
their homes.
It was a hot day when they set out, and after walking
many miles, Burradoo decided to rest and eat. Finding a
shady tree, he squatted beneath it and asked for the food
that the boys had collected. He enjoyed a feast of sweet
berries, flour stalks of the nardoo plant, wood-grubs, birds’
eggs and a bandicoot. While he was eating the boys had
to stand out in the sun, and they were bidden to remain
there until he gave them permission to move. Feeling
satisfied after his meal, he curled himself up in the shade
and went to sleep.
Now, Godarra, who had been following, told the boys
he would watch and give a whip-bird call as a warning when
Burradoo showed signs of waking. They were to go to the
creek nearby, find food, eat, drink, bathe and rest, but they
were to hurry back directly they heard the bird call. The
boys crept off silently while Burradoo slept on.
Godarra had seen a hive of wild honey high up in the
tree, so he made a folded pocket of paper bark from a ti-
tree, wet his head and body and climbed the tree. With
a sharp stick, he broke part of the hive and collected some
honey. Unfortunately, he disturbed the bees. The swarm
left the hive and flew round and round the tree. Godarra
hurried to the water, knowing that bees dislike getting
wet and would not attack him there. As he saw them
descend upon old Burradoo, he gave the whip-bird call, and
the boys came hurrying back to resume their places in the
sun.


The buzz of the bees disturbed the old man and
his restlessness caused the bees to attack him. They stung
him all over the body, especially about the head and face.
He jumped, rolled, moaned and yelled with pain until the
bees left him. Then, feeling very miserable, he looked at
the boys—strange to say, they all seemed quite well and
happy, while he, who had feasted and slept, felt ill and
suffered dreadful pain.
Next morning his head and face were so swollen that
he could scarcely see out of his eyes, but he was determined
to move on. He told the boys to continue to collect food
for him, but to refrain from eating, drinking or resting.
Late in the afternoon he decided to rest, selecting a
clump of shrubs as his shelter. He took the food that the
boys had collected, though he did not feel inclined to eat;
then, telling them to remain standing away from the bushes,
he tried to sleep. Eventually he dozed off.
Again Godarra told the boys to find food and water and
to rest while he watched. But Burradoo slept throughout
the night, and, when morning came, Godarra had the boys
up ready and waiting for him. The old fellow looked
at them, and was surprised to see them still fit and well. He
ate some of the food given him the evening before and then
set out for the sacred ground of the Bora ceremony.
After walking for some distance, he felt ill and uncom-


fortable, for hard lumps appeared under his chin, behind
his ears, and on several parts of his body. He soon dis-
covered that these painful lumps were ticks—small insects
that bury their heads under the skin and inject poison into
the person or animal they settle on. Burradoo now realised
that the shrubs which he had rested under were tick
bushes. The old fellow was suffering, yet he wanted
to get to the sacred grounds. He felt very ill, for
an overdose of bee-sting poison and an additional dose
of tick-poison were nearly too much for him. So, to
calm him, gave him the pocket of honey that
Godarra had collected. He decided to rest this time
under an overhanging rock and to let the boys dis-
lodge the ticks from his body. He kept the bag of
honey beside him, as he knew after tasting it that it was
good to eat. After a while he w T ent to sleep. Godarra
again relieved the boys that they might find food and water
for themselves.
Now, near that rock were many ant-nests, and the ants,
scenting the honey, came from all directions. Soldier ants,
red ants, black ants, bulldog ants; they all made straight
* for the honey and Burradoo. At first they fought
amongst themselves, then suddenly turned and attacked
the old man. Covered with ants, he woke up screaming
with pain. He was still very swollen from the bee-stings;
he still had painful lumps on his body caused by the
ticks, and now the ants added to his miseries. This was
more than he could bear. He thought he was going to die.
He thought he was being punished by small insects for
taking small boys away; so he told the boys to carry him
back to the tribe, as he could not continue the journey. He
ordered them to eat and drink, saying that he could not
understand how they all remained well and strong after
nearly three days without food or rest. He was sure that
some brave Spirit must be helping them.
Godarra, seeing his distress, came to the rescue and,
with a sharp, stone blade, cut a sheet of bark from the
trunk of an iron-bark tree, and with the help of the boys,
made a kind of stretcher out of it. The boys, under the
direction of Godarra, carried the old man in relays.
On they went, resting often and caring for the old


man. Garra killed a large goanna to collect the fat and
gall from it. With this he and Godarra rubbed Burradoo
to relieve his pain and to heal the bites and stings.
They journeyed on and, as they were getting nearer the
camp, Garra swung the churinga or bull-roarer. The tribe,
led by Bombala, hurried out to learn why the call was given.
They were surprised to see the boys carrying old Burradoo
on a bark stretcher and they were delighted to see their sons
well and happy.
The old man, now feeling much better, told Bombala
that all these boys would make good warriors, and that in
future boys under sixteen would not be taken from their
homes to go through any of the initiation ceremonies, and
that even then the boys would not have to endure extreme
hardships and privations.
Burradoo, seeing the churinga in Garra’s hand, told
him to keep it, as it would always be the sacred call-stick
of the tribe. Then, turning to Godarra, he handed him the
magic death-stick. He told him to bend or break it, for he
would never use it again.
Godarra was pleased to hear this, and placed the hated
stick across his knee. He
tried hard to break it, but
without success, and only
with great difficulty did he
make it bend. It curved
like an elbow, but would
not break, so, lifting his
arms high in the air, he
threw the bent stick far
away, but strange to say,
the stick, after travelling
some distance, swerved in
the air and returned to
him, landing at his feet.
Bombala, seeing this,
was greatly impressed, and called out, “Boomerang!
Boomerang!”—which means “Come back! Come back!”
To-day the Come-back Stick—the Boomerang—is the prin-
cipal weapon of the Australian aborigines.


DON’T WANDER, OR RAMBLE, OR ROAM
The Pelican’s bill is a wonderful size,-
He holds lots of things in it—fishes and flies
And froggies, who don’t go home straight after school
But play in the grasses surrounding a pool.
The poor mother froggies, slim, slick and serene,
Who dwell in a dell of a deep dapple green, »
Mid weeds, reeds and rushes, so slender and strong,
Sit crying, and crooning and croaking a song.
The Pelican, waiting near lumbering logs,
With bill open wide will devour all the frogs
Who draggle and dawdle and dwindle from school,
Instead of returning with speed to the pool.
Now! poor little froggies and queer little tads,
Why don’t you take heed of your croaking old Dads?
Your teacher—the tortoise, has told you all too,
Of Safety First and the right thing to do.
But froggies, like children, wise warnings won’t take,
So, so many there are who will share the same fate
As those who will wander and ramble and roam
Through marsh, mead or meadow away from their home.


A SONG OF AUSTRALIA
Australia! our dear Country,
A homeland young and free,
Our heritage of beauty,
Of health and liberty;
The sons of early settlers
Who fought the flood and drought,
The children of explorers,
Who blazed the way far out,
Swear by your starry banner,
The Cross in dome of blue,
To love and serve you always
With loyal hearts and true.
Australia! land of progress,
A Motherland we claim
Through pioneering fathers
Who gave us home and name.
A land of wealth and sunshine,
That gives a harvest fair,
The youngest of the Nations
That grew ’neath Britain’s care.
We swear again, by banner
The Cross in dome of blue
That we, your sons —Australians
Will live and die for you.
