ADMIRAL ARTHUR PHILLIP, R.N.
THE FOUNDER OF AUSTRALIA
HE Memorial which has to-day been unveiled by His Royal
Highness The Prince George makes some amends to the
name and fame of one of the greatest of our Empire builders.
Admiral Arthur Phillip was a citizen of London, born in the
Ward of Bread Street, on October 11th, 1738, and it is
therefore a fitting act of recognition that the founder of what was destined
to become the Commonwealth of Australia should be honoured and his
memory perpetuated in the City of his birth.
At the age of 17 Arthur Phillip entered the Royal Navy, where he
served in various vessels until he was retired on half-pay in 1761, with the
rank of Captain. For twelve years after this he lived at Lyndhurst in
Hampshire, and it is probable that it was during this time that he acquired
that practical knowledge of farming and building which did so much to
ensure the success of the first settlement in Australia. In 1773 he accepted
a position as Post-Captain in the Portuguese Navy, in which he served with
distinction for about three years. At the age of 49, Captain (afterwards
Admiral) Arthur Phillip was appointed as the leader of an expedition which
was to be sent out with the object of establishing a settlement in New
South Wales, and in May, 1787, he left England as first Governor of the
new Colony. His fleet consisted of eleven vessels, ranging from the
H.M.S. " Sirius,” of 610 tons and to the " Supply ” of 170 tons, having a
total tonnage of under 4,000 tons. Captain Phillip arrived at Botany Bay
on January 18th in the following year, after a voyage of nearly 9 months,
in the course of which he had experienced what, considering the over-
crowded conditions of the vessels and the inadequate food supplies, was
an extraordinarily small loss of life. (The second fleet which followed a
year later lost 400 souls during the voyage.) Being dissatisfied with


Botany Bay, Captain Phillip, on the 21st, set out in three boats, taking with
him Captain John Hunter, R.N., who afterwards succeeded Phillip as
Governor of the Colony ; Captain David Collins, first Judge-Advocate of
the Colony and later Founder and first Governor of the Colony of
Tasmania in 1804 ; Principal-Surgeon J. White, R.N. ; Lieutenant P. G.
King, R.N., subsequently third Governor of New South Wales ; and
Lieutenant George Johnston, A.D.C. (Acting Governor of New South
Wales in 1808), in command of a Guard of Marines. He explored Port
Jackson and decided upon Sydney Cove for the site of the settlement which
is now the City of Sydney (with a population of 1,250,000) on Wednesday,
23rd January, 1788, as is depicted on one of the pictures on the Memorial.
Three days later he disembarked from H.M.S. " Supply ” (the rest of the
fleet were at Botany Bay, and did not arrive until later in the afternoon),
with Lieutenant King and Lieutenant Johnston, A.D.C., and began the
founding of Sydney on Saturday, 26th January. The remaining pictorial
panel on the Memorial illustrates this event.
Captain Phillip remained as Governor until April, 1792, when he was
compelled by ill-health to return to England after four years. In the face
of appalling difficulties he had been responsible for the largest territorial
addition ever made to the British Empire at one time. The Expedition
was poorly equipped in almost every particular, and indeed it might be
said that it lacked everything save —a leader. Fortunately, Phillip proved
himself to be a genius at improvisation, and his resourcefulness was equal
to the task of dealing effectively with the administrative, legal, naval,
military, engineering, town-planning and other problems which on all
sides so urgently called for decision and action. The enterprise received
little or no encouragement from the Home Government, which for nearly
two years sent him no official instructions nor any supplies. Tools and
equipment of even the most rudimentary kind were what Phillip so
urgently required and these he improvised on the spot by one means or
another. Until such time as the earliest farming and stock-breeding
activities of the colonists became productive there was a shortage of the
necessities of life and the Colony was reduced to the verge of starvation
by the end of 1790. It was characteristic of the man that during this
period the Governor shared exactly the same ration as that distributed to
those in his charge, which was a weekly allowance of 2\ pounds of flour,
2 pounds of rice and 2 pounds of pork—the latter being four years old and
practically uneatable.
Phillip’s instructions at the outset were to found the settlement at
Botany Bay and his first great service to Australia was his courage and


sound judgment in choosing instead the site which afterwards became
Sydney. Had he remained at Botany Bay there can be little doubt that
the expedition would have resulted in a tragic failure, and Australia might
have been lost to the Empire. Phillip possessed the ideal qualities for his
task and he quickly established amicable relations with the Aboriginal
inhabitants as far as their savage way of life permitted. From the very
first he had a profound and prophetic faith in the future of the Colony.
Within a few months of the landing he wrote to Lord Sydney affirming
his confidence that " this country will prove the most valuable acquisition
Great Britain ever made.” He foresaw the Sydney of the future and his
plans provided for avenues 200 feet wide at a time when it was but a
struggling settlement of one-storey huts.
Captain Phillip returned to England in May, 1793, and was promoted
successively to the rank of Rear-Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and in 1814,
Admiral of the Blue. He retired eventually to Bath in 1806, where he
died on August 31st, 1814, and lies buried with his wife in the church of
St. Nicholas at Bathampton, nearby. The position of his grave was
unknown for 80 years. The name of Arthur Phillip—so long forgotten
and neglected—is to-day added to our City’s roll of fame and he takes his
rightful place amongst those immortals of our race whose courage and
vision have left their mark upon the history of the Empire. By the
National Historical Memorial that has to-day been unveiled by His Royal
Highness the Prince George, London now joins with the people of New
South Wales and of the Commonwealth in honouring one of her greatest
citizens. We rejoice with our kinsmen in this enduring bond between
the Motherland and the great Commonwealth of whose achievements we
are so proud.
" What do they know of England
Who only England know.”


THE MEMORIAL
E owe the conception of this National Historical Memorial
to Mr. Douglas Hope Johnston, M.A. (Cantab), F.R.Hist.S.,
Barrister-at-Law (Inner Temple), the great grandson of
Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston, who was A.D.C. to
i Governor Phillip at the first landing in Sydney in 1788,
where his descendants have since lived without a break: he is thus
the head of the oldest family in Australia and New Zealand. He is also the
Founder and ex-President of the Australasian Pioneers’ Club of Sydney
(membership of which is limited to the direct descendants of the Founders
of Australia and New Zealand), the official representative of the Families
of the Founders of Australia and a recognized authority on their history.
It should be added that the project of this Memorial has had the advantage
of the hearty support and co-operation of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment and the Australian Minister in London.
The Memorial —the gift of Lord Wakefield of Hythe—is the only
one of its kind and the largest bronze Memorial fixed to the outside
of a Church in London. Its height is sixteen feet with an additional
inscription tablet below of four feet by six ; its width is twelve feet and its
total weight one and three-quarters of a ton. The metal used is monumental
bronze, a particular copper alloy ; the lettering on the upper panels and
the decorative " rising sun ” are finished with the process of mercurial
gilding which is absolutely impervious to weather conditions.
The central feature of the Memorial is naturally the portrait bust of
Governor Phillip. This was modelled by Mr. Charles L. Hartwell, R.A.,
from the painting in the National Portrait Gallery, with reference also to
that in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. Every effort has been made as
regards this and other portions of the Memorial to secure absolute
accuracy, and the correctness of the historical data was confirmed in every
possible direction, thanks being due to the various authorities consulted
at the Admiralty, Royal United Services Museum, Greenwich Hospital,
The Science Museum and Australia House, for valuable advice and
assistance. The two pictures which appear one on each flank of the
Memorial are from a series of pictures of scenes taken from Australian
history, of which Mr. Hope Johnston is the author. The portions of the
work other than the portrait bust already alluded to were modelled and
prepared for the foundry by Mr. W. Hamilton Buchan, the general design
being interpreted by Mr. George Johnson, of Messrs. G. Johnson Bros.,


the founders and erectors of the monument, from rough notes and sketches
supplied by Mr. Hope Johnston, the entire work of preparation and
erection being under the supervision of the Architect, Mr. J. Reeve Young,
A.R.1.8.A. All the work has been carried out in London by British
craftsmen with British materials, the casting in Bronze of the intricate
relief portions calling for the highest skill in the various handicrafts
employed.
THE CHURCH
HE Church of St. Mildred, Bread Street, is one of the five
surviving Churches built by Sir Christopher Wren while
St. Paul’s Cathedral was building, its domical covering being in
some measure an essay in miniature for the larger work in hand
nearby. The interior of the Church is beautified by two stained glass
windows—one being a Memorial to men of the Ward of Bread Street
who fell in the Great War—and also by a pulpit by Grinling Gibbons.
The Church is the only building left that was certainly in Bread Street at
the time when Admiral Phillip lived in the Ward and is its official Church,
and is thus doubly appropriate as the site of this Memorial to a son of the
Ward.
THE WARD OF BREAD STREET
SI modern times known as a centre of the textile trade, the
Ward was originally, as the name of its principal street
suggests, the quarter of the bakers. In Friday Street and part
of Knightrider Street (formerly Old Fish Street), the sale of
fish was carried on, the market being served from Queenhithe Dock. In
Bread Street, prior to 1555, stood the Compter, a debtors’ prison. Several
Churches formerly within the Ward were not rebuilt after the Great Fire,
while the Church of St. Matthew, in Friday Street, was pulled down in
1885, and that of Allhallows, in Bread Street, was destroyed earlier in the
century. In this Church, John Milton, the Ward’s most famous son,
whose father was a scrivener, was baptized. The birth of Admiral Arthur
Phillip was also recorded in the Register of this Parish. The comparatively
modern western section of Cannon Street contains the Hall of the
Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, a new building upon a site which
has for several hundred years been held by the Company.


Lord Wakefield wishes to place on record his deep gratitude to The Rt. Hon .
the Lord Mayor of London (Alderman Sir Percy Greenaway), for his kindness
in granting him the use of the Mansion House on the occasion of the Luncheon
following the Unveiling of the National Historical Memorial to Admiral
Arthur Phillip, R.N., thus emphasising the National and Imperial value of
this permanent link between the Mother City of the Empire and the Common-
wealth newly provided by the City of London’s tribute to her worthy son, the
Founder of Australia .
