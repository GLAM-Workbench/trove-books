The Choir, proceeding from the Vestry
to the Gallery, will sing Hymn 242
“We Love the Place, O God “
“Lord, I have loved the habitation of Thy House
and the place where Thine honour dwelleth.”
We love the place, O God,
Wherein Thine honour dwells.
The joy of Thine abode
All earthly joy excels.
It is the house of prayer
Wherein Thy servants meet,
And Thou, O Lord, art there,
Thy chosen flock to greet.
We love the word of life,
The word that tells of peace,
Of comfort in the strife,
And joys that never cease.
We love to sing below
For mercies freely given,
But O, we long to know
The triumph song of heaven.
Lord Jesus give us grace
On earth to love Thee more,
In heaven to see Thy face
And with Thy Saints adore.
gntljems;
“ From the Rising of the Sun.
“ From the rising of the sun, unto the going down
of the same My Name shall be great among the
peoples, and in every place incense shall be offered
unto My Name, and a pure offering for My Name
shall be great among the nations.”
(Sir F. A. Gore-Ouseley, Bart.)
2 Cor. v. 20.—“ Now we are ambassadors in the
Name of Christ.” Romans x. 15.—“ How lovely
are the messengers that preach us the gospel of
peace.” (Mendelssohn.)


“ Land of Hope and Glory ” Elgar
Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crowned,
God make thee mightier yet!
On Sov’ran brows, beloved, renowned,
Once more thy crown is set.
Thine equal laws, by Freedom gained,
Have ruled thee well and long;
By Freedom gained, by Truth maintained,
Thine Empire shall be strong.
Refrain.
Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,
How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee ?
Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set;
God who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet.
Thy fame is ancient as the days,
As ocean large and wide;
A pride that dares, and heeds not praise,
A stern and silent pride;
Not that false joy that dreams content
With what our sires have won;
The blood a hero sire hath spent
Still nerves a hero son.
Land of Hope and Glory, etc.
A. C. Benson.
‘ Jerusalem ”
Sir Hubert Parry
(To be sung by all)
And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England’s mountain green?
And was the Holy Lamb of God
On England’s pleasant pastures seen?
And did the countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among those dark Satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire !
Bring me my spear ! O clouds unfold !
Bring me my Chariot of Fire !
I will not cease from mental fight;
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England’s green and pleasant land.
William Blake.


“ Now Praise We Great and Famous Men ”
Now praise we great and famous men,
The fathers named in story;
And praise the Lord Who now as then
Reveals in man His glory.
Praise we the wise and brave and strong,
Who graced their generation;
Who helped the right, and fought the wrong.
And made our folk a nation.
Praise we the great of heart and mind,
The singers sweetly gifted,
Whose music like a mighty wind
The souls of men uplifted.
Praise we the peaceful men of skill
Who builded homes of beauty.
And, rich in art, made richer still
The brotherhood of duty.
Praise we the glorious names we know;
And they—whose names have perished,
Lost in the haze of long ago—
In silent love be cherished.
In peace their sacred ashes rest.
Fulfilled their day’s endeavour;
They blessed the earth, and they are blessed
Of God and man for ever.
So praise we great and famous men.
The fathers, named in story;
And praise the Lord Who now as then
Reveals in man His glory.
William George Tarrant.
