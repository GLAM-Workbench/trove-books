tury, when he became a man in the form of the Khalifeh of Egypt, and the Uni-
versal Intelligence in the form of his great vizir. After reigning for some time
he suddenly vanished, and rose to heaven, and the Universal Intelligence still
remained on earth, and visited the faithful Druzes, to whom he revealed many
important facts in connection with the future.
His next appearance will be at the end of all things, and the good Druzes will be
established again in the land of their ancestors ?China.
However, even now, they have a conviction that the good Druzes, at their death,
go to China, while the souls of the wicked occupy the bodies of camels, or even of
dogs.
They frequently asked me about China, which is indeed their Celestial empire.
This religion, which will be seen to resemble in many respects the Buddhist
religion, is again in favour of the far East having been the origin of these people.
That they were visited by the vizir, who preached about his mad master, ? el
Hakem Bi Amr Allah,? is matter of history. This khalifeh imagined himself the
Almighty, and commanded all the Egyptians to worship him on pain of death.
He was a cruel tyrant, who persecuted all people. His end was mysterious ; he
was probably murdered ; but the vizir took advantage of this to spread the report
that he had ascended to heaven. When, however, it appeared that the khalifeh
was dead, the people no longer made a secret of their own religion, and the vizir,
finding his position dangerous in Egypt, escaped to Lebanon, where he found
these Druzes, whose religion already prepared them to receive without doubt the
words of this man. The Druzes have twelve chief priests, who are the initiated,
and called ? Akkal.? They do not drink coffee or smoke; and to them the
secrets of the religion are entrusted. When one dies, his place is filled up from
among the most discreet and learned of the race. The great priest, or Imdm, lives
at Kunawdt. He told me they had many very ancient books, but what they con-
tained of course he would not say. Perhaps some day we may get possession of
these manuscripts, and then we may hope for some real knowledge about this
remarkable people.* Their present number is, I believe, as follows: ?
In the Lebanon .. .. .. .. 60,000 men
About Hermon 4,000 ?
About el Merj Ibn ?Amer and the ?Akka country.. 4,000 ~
In the Hauran 7,000 ~
which gives a total of 75,000 men , without women and children.f
The Druz women are more carefully secluded than even the Muslem women.
They are rarely seen, except they be veiled. The married women wear a remark-
able head-dress, very much like a sugar-loaf, made of wood, or, amongst the
richer class, of silver : it is two feet in length sometimes, and from it falls a white
veil, which completely hides the face. This head-dress is called ?tantur,? and
is supposed by some to be the ? horn? sometimes referred to in Scripture^
On the whole, there is no people in the East who give so much hope for the
future as these Druzes. If energetic measures were taken at once, and a well-
organised mission established among them, I believe there would be really a great
hope of making them Christians. With the Muslems you have not only prejudice
to contend with, but what is as bad, effeminacy and inactivity. The sensual and
degraded follower of Mohammed will, only after a long struggle, be rescued from
his long-contracted and, one may say, hereditary habits of self-indulgence; and
until the ruler of the empire be himself a Christian, such a result can never be
hoped for, and will never be attained.
* The seven standard theological works of the Druzes are now in the posses-
sion of Mr. Porter, who succeeded in purchasing them a few months before he
left Damascus. ? Ed.
f Mr. Porter places the total Druz population at about 78,000 souls. ? Ed.

Vll. ?Contributions to the Knowledge of New Guinea. By
Dr. Salomon Muller.
Translated from the Dutch by John Yeats, Esq., f.r.g.s.
Bead, March 22, 1858.
There are few islands of any extent or importance between the
tropics and the temperate zones that have been so seldom visited
and scientifically examined by Europeans as Papua or New
Guinea. This is the more remarkable when we remember that
the place was early discovered, and is, moreover, situated close
to the Moluccas, which, on account of their valuable products,
have attracted the attention of every maritime power.
Our knowledge of the south and south-west coasts in particular
is very limited; any approach to the former of these being dan-
gerous in the highest degree from the numerous coral reefs and
sandbanks that obstruct the northern shores of Australia.
In 1826 the Dutch brig Dourga , under command of Lieutenant
Kolff, was sent thither to investigate part of the coast, and also to
make inquiry into the condition of the inhabitants. Steering from
Amboyna to the south-westerly promontory of New Guinea, Heer
Kolff discovered, about 24 geographical miles north of False
Cape, a wide opening which appeared to be the mouth of a river,
and to which he gave the name of his vessel; he afterwards kept
a north-west course until he came to the small island of Lokahia,
134� 50' e. of Greenwich. From Lokahia he departed to the
Tenimber Islands, after having lost one of his crew in an affray
with the natives.
In the beginning of 1828 two new war-ships were sent out to
the south-west coast of New Guinea by the Dutch administration
of India, namely, the corvette Triton , and the colonial schooner
Iris. Five scientific men accompanied the expedition, and from
their reports collectively, the sole survivor, Dr. S. Muller, has
drawn up his narrative.
? Despatched to examine the coast and select a place suitable
for a settlement, we came at the end of the month of May before
the broad opening of the so-named Dourga River. After pro-
ceeding up it for some days in an easterly direction, the uncer-
tainty of this course, together with a threatened scarcity of fresh
water, induced us to prefer the sea again and view the shore
more northwards. We found some opportunities for intercourse
with the inhabitants, and also for examination of the country.
The discovery of a deep and spacious bay, lat. 3� 45' 5., and long.
134� 15' e., with lofty picturesque coasts, determined our choice
Of a site for the little fort which was built here, and named Fort
Du Bus, in honour of the Dutch Commissary-General for India.


? The death of twenty of the ships? crews, and the sickness of
upwards of sixty others, made further research impracticable, but
the vessels which afterwards carried provisions to the fort once or
twice a year made additional discoveries. In April, 1835, Heer
Langenberg Kool, commander of the war-schooner Postilion ,
sailed through the supposed river Dourga, and proved it to be a
strait; it was named by him Princess Marianne Strait, and the
island to the west of it Prince Frederic Henry Island.
? The physical condition of the coast on the south and south-
west sides of New Guinea, investigated by the Triton and Iris ,
is very varied. From east longitude 132� 30', or perhaps a little
less east, to about 135� 30', there are high cliffs. Only here and
there are levels to be seen, principally within the numerous bays,
while in other places the rocks rise perpendicularly from the sea,
particularly about the headlands. Near the last-mentioned
degree of longitude the rocks retire gradually southwards from
the shore, so that in this direction an extensive level border is
visible, which stretches away in one vast wilderness to Forres
Straits. As far as the eye can reach there is not the slightest
trace of elevation in the ground between the two most southerly
degrees of latitude ; but in latitude s�� about, in clear weather,
and far inland, there rises a lofty mountain-chain which opens out
the farther we go north (about 4|�) and then presents an uncom-
monly bold aspect. Some of the summits seem to be raised above
the limits even of perpetual snow ; at least we are at a loss how
otherwise to account for the shining white layers that covered the
highest peaks and surfaces. During the day little, was to be seen
of the chain, as thick clouds commonly shrouded it; but early in
the morning, just before or after sunrise, it displayed itself in all its
immensity along a vast extent of country. Its chief direction
appeared to be nearly east and west, so that between the 135 th
and 136 th degrees of east longitude it comes very near to the
smaller chains which thence hem the coast-line northwards.
These last, therefore, follow the south-easterly and north-westerly
direction of the island. Very remarkable, however, is the differ-
ence that exists between these distinct mountain-ranges. The
chain lying far inland exhibits in general softly-swelling outlines.
Among the high projecting summits a number of broad flat
crowns particularly arrest attention : extensive plateaux probably,
which, judging from their situation, must be surrounded partly by
a temperate, partly by a cold climate. The more northerly coast
elevations, on the contrary, are almost everywhere rude and craggy
in form, not unfrequently resembling tall turrets and fractured
battlements. In general the chain on this part of the coast is only
of moderate elevation. That which stretches along the shore
seems nowhere to exceed a thousand metres (3280?89 feet) in


height; in most places where we saw it, it does not rise above two
or three hundred metres (600 to 1000 feet). But the mountain
Lamantsjieri, one of the principal crowns of the chain, is accord-
ing to trigonometrical measurement 750 39 metres high (2460'67
feet). This lies in the background of the bend Oeroe Langoeroe,
or Triton Bay, in 3?39 south latitude.
? The islands along the coast we examined are in general of the
same nature as the solid wall in the neighbourhood of which they
are found : where it is low, they are so too ; where it is high, they
are equally so. We found the greatest number of islands under
the high coast. On the whole they agreed with this latter both
in external form and internal constitution, and were separated
from it by straits or channels more or less broad. Their banks
are mostly steep as unbroken walls, and, where damaged by the
heavy current, are commonly much undermined, and perforated
above water. Within the bays and coves that are found along
the coast at intervals are small sandy patches peopled by the
half-nomadic Papuans.
? In the straits alluded to, also along the remaining part of the
high coast, the navigable water, as far as known to us, is pure
and very deep ; so much so that on board the Triton , while cruis-
ing in these straits, ground was seldom reached at a depth of
from fifty to ninety fathoms, even when we were not more than a
cable?s length from shore.
? Farther to the south, on the contrary, where the coast is low
and flat, a ship of moderate dimensions cannot approach within a
mile, or even two, without the greatest precaution and constant
use of the lead. It is only in a few places that the bottom
exhibits a marked declivity. Islands are seldom seen along that
southern part, but sandbanks are observed both above and below
the surface.
? Among the numerous river-mouths on the coast, some are of
considerable breadth. Of course the origin of several of the
streams must be sought for far inland, as in the southern portion
of New Guinea the waterparting lies at a great distance from the
west coast. The only river examined by us in these parts, the
Oetanata, is about one-fifth of a mile broad at its outlet, while its
depth varies from four and five to six and seven fathoms. Not
very far up it splits into three small arms, named Toega, Wakia,
and Baai. By the sea-side its banks are dry and sandy, but
inland the above-named sections wind through a marshy soil, con-
sisting of clay mixed with loam. As far as we know, the Triton
and the Iris were the first ships that ever sailed into the Princess
Marianne Strait from the north; their failure led to the later expedi-
tion of Heer Langenberg Kool, which was entirely successful. The
strait is upwards of two geographical miles wide at its northerly


entrance, but becomes gradually narrower inland, so that about
the middle it is only a quarter, and a little farther south but a
sixth of a mile broad; farther in towards the opening on the
south it widens again to the breadth of about half a mile. Its depth,
reckoning from low-water level, is from four to upwards of ten
fathoms : at the southern outlet only Heer Langenberar Kool found
y O O
it diminished to scarcely two fathoms; within the strait it commonly
increased from the shores towards the middle. Along the whole
of the passage the banks are low and mostly marshy, though here
and there slips of land appear above water drier in their nature.
One uniform forest is seen everywhere, containing no very heavy
timber on the coasts, but inland many thick trees. Here and
there this wilderness is skirted by a slip of soft clay-land ; along the
whole strait the bottom is generally soft, except at the southern
outlet, where the ground is hard.
? This mouth is probably the same that is marked on some maps as
? Bartholomew ? River. The banks of the strait may be approached
closely almost anywhere, and with the more safety as the depth
increases and decreases regularly with but very few exceptions.
? There are mouths of small streams to be met with in abundance
on both banks, some of which during the ebb tide yield good
drinking water, but as the flood rises they become brackish.. Those
which were closely examined by Heer Langenberg Kool were found
deep enough at low water to allow a laden bark to pass in and out.
The schooners Postilion and Sireen filled their tanks from the
most northerly of the two creeks that empty themselves at but a
short distance apart, not far to the south-west of the only little
island that there is in the strait. Anchorage for this purpose
may be found close under the wall. This finding of soft water is
under all circumstances important to navigation ; it would have
relieved the corvette Triton from great embarrassment, and might
have contributed much towards the attainment of the objects of
the expedition. From this point of view especially, and also for
facilities in refitting, the discovery of this strait is valuable ; though
its situation, the strong currents running through it, the narrow-
ness of the passage, and the inhospitality of the whole region, will
never allow it to be of general or wide-spread utility.
? The ground in the flat district comprising the south-western
promontory of New Guinea, as far as the coast-chain which may be
said to end at 135� 30' E, of the meridian of Greenwich, consists
of a bluish-gray clay, that is mixed, according to the observations
of M. Macklot, in some places with pieces of quartz, in others
with limestone. Where the land is not laid under water by the
tide, this clay is firm and covered with a thin crust of loam; but
where it is daily washed by the sea-water, it is soft and muddy.
There also occur in the first-named drier part which stretches ?*


eastward from 135� 30' to 138� 30', in many places along the
coast, strips of white sand mixed with much quartz. The moun-
tains that form the more northern shore are characterised, as we
have already stated, by their rude outlines, in which angular
sharp-edged crags with steep declivities alternate with deep and
narrow clefts and caverns, or naked walls of rock ; while the rest,
where the situation is not unfavourable to accumulations of matter,
are covered with a layer more or less thick of vegetable earth.
According to Professor von Leonhard of Heidelberg, who has
inspected some of the specimens from our collections of stones, the
mountains consist of a Jurassic limestone formation (oolitic series of
English geologists), and their higher parts of a very characteristic
dolomite of the same age. This last exhibits in many places
naked walls of a glistening white colour. In the subjacent brownish-
gray dull-looking limestone, fossil shells are frequently enclosed;
and in one place M. Macklot found a fossil vertebra, probably
belonging to a great saurian. Farther inland there must he
mountains which contain extensive layers of clay, because not only
the beds of the rivers, but also the bottom of the sea in the
neighbourhood of the mouths of the rivers, consist of clay. Hard
pieces of this substance, from the river Timbona, which flows
through the valley between the mountains Lamantsjieri and Oriori,
have great resemblance, in the opinion of Professor von Leonhard,
to certain strata of the tertiary formation called Tegel, which
occurs at Vienna. The small bands which are met with here and
there in the clefts, and within the curves and bays along the sea-
coast, consist either of quartz or limestone, or of a sand of
powdered white and red coral.
? To add to this geological sketch of the south-west coast of New
Guinea, all that is known to us of the mineral kingdom, we remark
that we found amongst the natives on the river Oetanata, large
cylindrical pieces of light gray sandstone: fragments which,
according to the report of the natives, had been brought from the
interior. They use them as well for grindstones as for ballast in
their canoes.
? Further, we obtained by barter a few clubs having their upper
extremities furnished with an artistically-wrought stone, consisting
of a ringing, hard, and very fine granular hornstone of a greenish-
blue colour. These stones were partly of the common hatchet
shape, like many of those found in the South-Sea Islands; others
were of an angular star-shaped figure. In the Princess Marianne
Strait were found at intervals along the banks volcanic matter of a
light and porous nature. It had probably been transported from
a distance and deposited by the stream. We saw sand washed
up in a few places only, but where the banks of the strait are ele-
vated beyond the ordinary level of the tide, and therefore have a


less marshy nature, we obtained pieces of the German Rasen-
Eisenstein or Sumpferz (clay iron-stone), together with the iron-
ore Bohnerz, or bog-iron.
?With regard to the growth of plants on the west coast of New
Guinea, it may be said first, that in general, as far as we have
seen the country, it is everywhere a wilderness, and overrun with
wood. The flat parts particularly exhibit an unbroken green
carpet, which does not appear to have a single unfruitful or
bare place in it. Alternations of this last-named character are
perceived first on the high mountainous coast, along the declivities
of which groups of lofty trees luxuriate by steep precipices, and
where the rude crag with its naked sides obtrudes amongst shrubs
and bushes and creeping plants. To give an idea of the pre-
vailing characteristics of the vegetable kingdom, according to the
reports of my colleague Zippelius, and the kind assistance rendered
by Professor Blume, ?the woods along the coasts of the Princess
Marianne Strait consist chiefly of Rhizophora?, Bruguierse, Avi-
cenniae, Petalomae, Sonneratise, Heritierae, ACgicereae, Meme-
cyleae, and similar ones. In places where the ground is a little
higher and less marshy, figs show themselves, Mimosae, and repre-
sentatives of the classes Fagraea, Clerodendrum, Carissa, Aralia,
Melanthesa, and other Euphorbiaceae ; while in a few more open
spots along the sides partly covered with Saccharum Koenigii,
the fan palm may be seen, and a number of the low, crooked
stems of Paritium Tiliaceum. From the tough bark-fibres of
these last, the natives, like the islanders of the great Pacific
Ocean, and of the Indian Archipelago, prepare thin cords and
all sorts of bands, which, plaited or worked into nets, serve for
ornaments and other purposes. In the neighbourhood of the river
Oetanata are to be observed along the white sandy shore, whole
woods of the club-tree (Casuarina equisetifolia), besides fig-trees,
and not a few species from the genera Aigiceras, Xylocarpus,
Salacia, Olax, Canthium, Scyphiphora, &c.
? Let us now glance at the animal kingdom of the country we
are considering. Very remarkable is the want of mammalia in
New Guinea. Not more than six species of this class were
noticed by us, which all belonged to the family of the Marsupialia.
Three of these were unknown, and consisted of a little carnivorous
pouched animal of the race Phascogale, and two kangaroos, which
differ very characteristically from all others of the class hitherto
described, in that they live upon trees. For this reason, as well
as for other physical distinctions, we have formed them into a new
group, under the name Dendrolagus. The other sorts obtained
by us were the species already mentioned by Valentyn, Pelandok
(Dorcopsis Brunii), a young specimen of Petaurus sciureus, and a
few of the Phalangista maculata.


? Less poor is New Guinea in birds : indeed in this point it may
vie with the most favourably situated of the Indian islands. At
the end of the voyage, and of a three months? stay on the coast,
our collection was composed of 119 varieties, belonging to 60
different kinds. The great groups of the Passerini, Scansores, and
Gallinacei, were most numerously represented by the so-termed
insect-eaters, the parrots, and the pigeons. Next to these came
a few species out of the families Conirostres, Tenuirostres, Byn-
dactyli, Amphiboli, and Hiantes. Of the water-birds we had the
Natatores and the Grallatores chiefly. As to those met with in
the Princess Marianne Strait, only the Columba Mulleri and
the Humeralis deserve especial mention.
? A very large duck, quite strange to me, was shot with ball,
and rather roughly used, so that it was thrown aside as unservice-
able, under the firm expectation that we should soon secure
another specimen. To my great regret, however, we were dis-
appointed, for we never saw the species again. In the wood
along the banks of this strait, and also in the neighbourhood of the
outlets of the river Oetanata, we often found great heaps made of
earth and dry leaves, which, in the opinion of our Ambonian
guides, were the nests of the Maleo (Megapodii). Some of these
heaps excited our amazement, considered as the nests of gallina-
ceous birds, on account of their prodigious size. One of them,
by my own measurement, was at the base 8 metres (26 ft.) in
circumference, and 2� in height. The form was that of a cone
flattened at the extremities. No trace of an opening could be
perceived to this or to others that came under my notice.
? Of the Amphibia we obtained on the west coast of New Guinea
26 sorts : 15 of the Lizard family, 5 of the Serpent, 1 of the Tor-
toise, and the remaining 5 of the Frog tribe. Nearly all are
unknown, or but newly described from our specimens.
? The fishes that we obtained at different places along the south-
west coast of New Guinea were principally of the genera Squalus,
Pristis, Raja, Scomber, Spams, Mugil, Polynemus, Clupea,
Trichi urns, Triacanthus, Belone, and others. Of the Trichiurus
haumela there were more taken than of any other kind. In the
Princess Marianne Strait, at low water, we saw the dry muddy
shores strewed with Periopthalmus Schlosseri. Objects from two
inches to nearly a foot in length crept, sprang, or displayed them-
selves?the body raised somewhat in front ?as if in a sedate,
almost sitting posture; the eyes like little horns or ears pricking
up, stiffly standing out above the head, and looking round with
earnestness and attention. Nothing so curious, one might say so
comical, as the positions and movements, the peeping and staring,
of this mud-loving fish. Observed at a distance it is commonly
stealing away over the soft ground, but no sooner is it aware of


danger than it stops, pricks up its head high in the air, and, should
any one approach, takes flight by jumping or hopping into the water.
? The Mollusca we pass by to give a little more attention to
climate, &c. The following is the result of our observations
from May to September, on the south-west coast of New Guinea.
During that time the weather was in general more windy and
rainy than still and dry, particularly during the last months of
our stay. The air was mostly heavy and misty, and therefore
disagreeably damp. The mountains were almost always covered
with clouds, and but seldom distinctly visible. A few fine days,
with a pure serene atmosphere, were only to be regarded as
exceptional. The consequence was, that the temperature during
the day was generally moderate, and by night cool, at times sen-
sibly cold. The warmth was inconvenient and oppressive only
when for a time no clouds at all had intercepted the sunbeams.
? On the river Oetanata the centigrade thermometer stood in the
middle of the month of June, in the morning just before sunrise,
at 25�, = 77� F., at noon at 29� and 29�?5, =B4� F., and towards
evening, at sunset, at 26� to 26 0, 7, = 78 0, 4 F. Of thirty observa-
tions with the same thermometer made during July and August,
in the bay of Oeroe Langoeroe, the mean temperature appears to
have been ?in the mornings, 27�*4, = 81 0, 3 F. ;in the afternoon,
28�, = 82� F. ;in the evenings after sunset, 26 0, 6, = 79�'3 F.: the
highest and lowest ranges of the thermometer were observed on
the 14th August at 1 o?clock at noon, when the mercury stood at
31�?2, = 88�T F.; and on the 3rd August, at 12 o?clock at noon,
when it stood at 25�, = 77� F. During our stay in this bay fright-
ful tempests more than once burst over the neighbourhood, dis-
charging torrents of water, and being accompanied by heavy
thunder and lightning.
? Lightning was indeed a very common phenomenon, occurring
almost every evening in the northern as well as the southern dis-
tricts. Earthquakes, according to the report of the natives, are
seldom observed in the places inhabited near the shore, and never
very severe. We experienced nothing of the kind during our
cruise along the coast; once only, on the last of August, a few
sailors of the corvette out in the woods thought they had perceived
two slight shocks, and on the Ist of September, too, while we lay
at anchor near a small island at the entrance of Triton Bay,
there was an unusual shaking in the ship about four o?clock in
the morning, without any one being able to account for it. The
officers ascribed it to a marine convulsion.
? From our record of the winds it appears in general that along
the south-west coast of New Guinea, with a waning moon, the
south-east monsoon blows more southerly, even to south-west, and
sometimes west; but with a moon waxing, on the contrary, it


turns more to the north, north-east, and north. When the heavy
and long-continued rains that we had during the cruise are taken
into account, the testimony of the natives seems to be confirmed,
that along this part of the coast of New Guinea, just as in the
Archipelago of the Moluccas, the south-east monsoon must be
held to be the bad or rainy monsoon ; the north-west, on the con-
trary, for the good or the dry monsoon. This state of the weather
is thus the reverse of that which obtains on the great western isles
of Sunda.
? The observations taken on board the Triton respecting the rise
and fall of the tide, and the currents along the coast and from the
land, furnish the following results: ?In the Princess Marianne
Strait a regular rising and falling of the water occurred, though
once only in twenty-four hours, and making a difference generally
of from to If fathoms. From a series of careful observations
made in the bay Oeroe Langoeroe, we learn that at full moon and
new moon it is high-water there at 8 minutes past I at noon, and
low-water at 21 minutes past 7in the evening. The fall is then
2 metres.
? This is, however, not the greatest difference between the rising
and falling, for when the moon is in her quarters the difference
amounts to 2?24. There is ebb twice in twenty-four hours, and flood
twice ; some irregularity may however be noticed, for occasionally
high-water lasts an hour longer than low-water, and the reverse.
The current observed along the coast took the same direction as
the then prevailing wind ; thus north-west, with a rate of about
f mile, excepting where interrupted by water flowing from the
land, or by bends, banks, or islands. In the Princess Marianne
Strait, where the course of the stream depends upon the curves
in the banks, its speed was twice as great as in the sea, and there-
fore 1J miles.?
