The following Lines were the
RESULT OF MUCH PLEASURABLE THOUGH
LABORIOUS THOUGHT TO THE WRITER,
AND HE HOPES READERS WILL NOT FIND
THEM ALTOGETHER DEVOID OF INTEREST.
















And do less sterling graces show
In those compelled ’mid want to grow ?
The steady patience of their lives
Sufficiently this thought denies.
Could we the various reasons scan
That prompt to toil laborious man,
His self-denying life when seen
Would show him in a nobler mien,
And bare the worth doth underlie
The plodder for the day’s supply,
And prove there lives within our gaze
Those living worthy human praise—
Who help to make old England great
And give her sons to guard the State,
Who ne’er are trained to serve or woo
A thought or principle untrue :
And what though troubles round them loom.
From theirs they hide the transient gloom ;
Thus England’s children, bold and free,
Depict in looks the warmth they see,




lUcb and If’oar.
And point’st the road and mak’st it clear
As the true path for him to steer;
And wise is lie who doth attend
To seek aright thy use and end.
On him will peace perpetual smile
And health’s bright vigor time beguile.
With views but fashioned in the rough,
Though deemdd serviceable enough,
He looks around in search of scenes
To win by toil increased means,
And soon the wished-for work obtains
Demanding constant care and pains,
And steers through all that doth perplex
Or can the mind or body vex,
And by the exercise of will
Acquires proficiency of skill.
As all thus fill a useful groove
Societies in order move,
Its needs by Industry are fed
To which her sons are early bred.
