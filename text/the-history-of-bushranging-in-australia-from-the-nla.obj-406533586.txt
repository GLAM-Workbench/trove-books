THE HISTORY OF BUSHRANGING.
t PECULIAR interest is taken all over the world in the predatory exploits
of banditti, whether their depredations are carried on in daring single-
handed fashion, or in numbers. It is of no use that moralists, such as
ourselves for instance, clearly point out and prove by arguments logical
and incontestible that highwaymen are simply vermin, whom we are in
1 duty bound to assist in exterminating. The fascinations attaching to
the wild, roving, albeit rascally life of the freebooter, often touch a sym-
pathetic cord in the bosom of ardent youth, and so strongly is this misplaced
sympathy at times implanted that young men, of previously good general conduct,
have been known to be so greatly excited on a perusal of such literature as the
lives of Dick Turpin, Tom King, Claude Duval, Paul Clifford, Jack Shephard and
other noted scapegraces, as to suddenly abandon the peaceful avocations in which
they had been trained and nurtured and take to the road, where for a period, at
least they have preyed with more or less success on unarmed or timorous individ-
uals 'though in nearly every case coming under our cognizance, the arm of justice
has at last overtaken them, when, of course, they have been dealt with in the rigor-
ous and remorseless fashion which such misguided persons undoubtedly merit.
With these few prefatory remarks and precautionary hints, we proceed to give to
our readers a brief historical resume of the career of the most noted bushrangers
who have from time to time infested these colonies.
From the earliest period up to the present, lawless men have arisen to strike
terror to the hearts of order-loving and peaceful colonists, setting laws at defiance,
and ultimately reaching the untimely end which overtakes evil-doers. Glancing
over the annals of the past we find the largest number, and most daring bushrang-
ing exploits are recorded from New South Wales and Victoria. This is probably
accounted for by those colonies affording greater facilities than the rest, in moun-
tains and inaccessible country for hiding places for criminals fleeing from the
mvrmidons of the law. In the days when convictism was rife, and fleet after fleet
of prison ships landed their living freight on the shores of Botany Bay ; when
cruel taskmasters used the cat unsparingly, and rations were so scarce that food
which now would hardly be given to dogs was greedily devoured ; when men were
forced to toil in a half-nude state under the burning sun, exposed to severe discipline
and hardships of the direst kind, there was at least some excuse for their taking
to the bush” to escape such, and entering on a career more congenial to their tastes.
Hundreds of bushrangers were then extant at one time, many of them quite
as daring as those of the latter days, but never so bloodthirsty or dastardly in the
means taken to accomplish their ends. Every year since the foundation of the
colonies some new bushranger has arisen, and every succeeding year has witnessed
either his downfall or the gang connected with him ; and so will it be to the end,
till the appropriation of other men’s goods by violent means is no longer attempted
and a resume of the dark scenes we are called on to record have been utterly
stamped out and obliterated.
Michael Howe,
Who had been a seamen in the Royal Navy, and was afterwards owner of a small
coasting craft, in which he acquired some notion of command, arrived in Van
Dieman’s Land in 1811, and was sent as an assigned servant to Mr. Ingle, He,
however declared he would be no man’s slave, and escaping to the bush, joined a
gang of' marauders, commanded by one Whitehead, The gang numbered about
twenty outlaws, amongst whom was a deserter from the 73rd regiment ; and at-
tached to the band were two native women. Soon after Howe’s joining them they
attacked the settlement of New Norfolk, and there procured a good supply of arms
and ammunition. Thence they marched to Pittwater, committing many depre-
dations, and sacking and burning the houses and stacks of those who had made
themselves obnoxious to them. Again, they attacked. New Norfolk, and had a fight

with the settlers, in which the latter were worsted. But in the engagement White-
head was seriously wounded. Finding he could not recover he appealed to Howe to
finish him and cut his head off, to prevent the reward offered for his capture being
obtained by any of the settlers. This request Howe complied with, and then
assumed command of the gang. It was subsequently asserted by Howe (and there
is good reason to believe his statements) that some of the police, presumably
most active in the pursuit of him and his gang at this time, were actually in com-
munication with him, and received a share of the profits accruing from the men's
crimes. Howe at this time was accustomed to leave his gang for short periods,
and retire to some mountain fastness with a native girl to whom he was much
attached. Subsequently she was captured, and became useful tc the soldiery in
discovering his favourite haunts to them. At last Howe sent through the medium
of a Yankee sailor, a proposal to the Governor of surrender. The Governor (Sorrell)
sent Captain Nairne to the rendezvous to meet him and give him an assurance of
present safety and promise of intercession for his pardon if he would come in.
This offer Howe accepted, and placed himself in custody. But when, some little
time after, he on a plea of ill-health, was allowed to take exercise under charge of
a constable, he contrived to give his guard the slip, and again took to the bush.
He found his gang nearly broken up, only two men (Watts and Browne)
remaining. Soon after his return Watts conspired with a stock-keeper named
Drew against Howe, and taking him unawares, they threw him down, disarmed
him, and tied one of his hands behind his back, leaving him thus lying on the
ground, they ate their breakfast, and then started with him to Hobart Town, in
hope of obtaining a munificent reward. Watts walked in front of the prisoner,
Drew followed behind. On the road Howe managed to get his hand loose un-
perceived by his guard, and springing suddenly on Watts, he seized his knife
and stabbed him with fatal effect, and then taking his gun shot Drew dead on the
spot. Watts managed to reach Hobart town, but subsequently died of his wounds.
A large reward was now offered for the capture or destruction of Howe together
with freedom and a passage home should his captor be a convict.
But for a long time he escaped all snares, though the temptation of the big
reward, liberty, and a passage home constituted a bait not easy to withstand. At
last a transported sailor, named Jack Worral, conspired with one of Howe’s mates,
named Warburton, to effect his capture. Major Bell gave them the assistance of a
soldier of the 18th regiment, named Pugh, these two secreting themselves in War-
burton’s hut, while Warburton engaged to inveigle Howe into it. Warburton suc-
ceeded in so inveigling him, but Howe discovered his danger, and managed to
break away, the shots fired at him not taking effect. In running, however, he
received a nasty fall, which partly stunned him, and then he turned to fight.
Whilst engaged with one assailant, the other crept up, and knocked him down
with the butt end of his musket, and then with the same weapon dashed his brains
out. This occurrence took place on the 21st October, 1818. In a kangaroo-skin
pouch or knapsack which he carried was found a record of his crimes, and the
names of many of his accomplices, and those of the receivers of stolen property,
persons hitherto unsuspected of being capable of such malpractices.
Mosquito.
This bushranger was a Sydney aboriginal, who had been transported to Van
Dieman’s Land for the murder of a woman. First he was employed bv the au-
thorities as a tracker to hunt up the haunts of bush angers but he effected his
escape, and headed the Oyster Bay tribe of natives, ver whom he exercised un-
bounded sway. They numbered two hundred, and, under Mosquito's commands,
committed many foul and treacherous murders on isolated settlers and their
families. He became a pest and a terror, and a large reward was off -red for his
capture. At last a native and two constables tracked him to his lair at Oyster
Bay. They captured him, and conveyed him to Hobart Town, where he and
another native, named Black Tom, and six Europeans were executed together,
February, 1825.
John Donohoe,
A native of Dublin, arrived a prisoner, in the colonies by the Ann and Amelia, in
1825. Not long afterwards he escaped, and took to the bush, where he committed
sundry depredations, chiefly in the vicinity of Liverpool, Penrith, and Windsor.
He was joined by ten or more others, forming a band that created terror through
all the populous parts of the interior during 1828-9. But John was at length shot
dead, in a skirmish, by a soldier named Maggleton, at Raby, on September 1, 1830.


Several of his comrade banditti were afterwards caught and executed. Donohoe
was only sft. 4in. in height, and we learn from the records of the period that he
had flaxen hair and blue eyes.
Walmsley,
One of Donohoe’s gang, was captured after a slight resistance, and was comdemned
to death. He was, however pardoned by the Government in consequence of dis-
closures he made as to the receivers of the booty taken by his gang. It was chiefly
on his evidence that several convictions of receivers subsequently took place, Jan.
5, 1831.
Francis Gardiner,
Commonly known as “ Frank Gardiner,” alias Christie, alias Clarke, was born at
Boro Creek near Goulburn, N, S. W., in 1830. When he attained to years of
maturity his height was sft. He had brown hair, and sallow complexion, and
hazel eyes. He was first tried on October 21 and 22, 1850, at the Geelong Circuit
Court, Victoria, on a charge of horsestealing, receiving a sentence of five years
with hard labour ; but on March the 26th of the year following he escaped from
Pentridge prison. He was convicted, however at the Goulburn Circuit Court,
N. S. W., on March 17, 1854, on two charges of horsestealing for which he received
two sentences of seven years each on the roads. He obtained a ticket-of-leave for
Carcoaron December 31, 1859, but it was cancelled on May 5, 1861, for absence
from district, and being suspected of cattle stealing. For several years he kept a
great part of the country in terror by his lawless deeds, aided as he was by a gang
of ruffians that he got together, the principal of whom were Gilbert, O’Malley,
Hall, and Dunn. No fewer than six mail robberies under arms were committed by
him, and scores of persons were bailed up and plundered. The most memorable
of the crimes perpetrated by Gardiner’s gang were the robbery of the gold escort
from the Lachlan, at Bngowra, in 1862, when the three policemen were overpowered
by a large number of ruffians, and several thousands of ounces of gold stolen ; and the
shooting of Troopers Middleton and Hosie in a desperate encounter with the gang.
Notwithstanding the efforts of the N. 8. W. police, Gardiner escaped out of the
country into the neighbouring colony of Queensland, where he set up business as a
storekeeper, successfully carrying it on for two years at a place called Apis Greek,
on the road between Rockhampton and Peak Downs, where he was captured by
Constables Pye, M’Glone, and Wells, in Feb., 1864. He was brought to Sydney,
and tried and convicted before Sir Alfred Stephen, on the Bth of July of that year,
for the wounding of Trooper Hosie and the robbery of Messrs. Hewett and
Horsington. For these offences he received sentenced amounting to 32 years’ hard
labour. In consequence, however, of strong pressure being brought to bear upon
the Executive and the Governor, Gardiner was released from prison in July, 1874,
on condition of his leaving the colony. He accordingly went to America, and at
San Francisco carried on the business of hotelkeeper, at which place, he died
sometime during the eighties. Mrs. Brown, Gardiner s paramour, was the wife of a
respectable settler. Having been seduced by Gardiner, she left her husband and
family, breaking up a comfortable home, and lived with the outlaw until he was
captured. Subsequently she went to New Zealand, and died a violent death by her
own hands, on the Thames goldfields, in 1868.
Captain Melville.
This notorious scoundrel was born at sea, and strange to say, he gained much
misplaced sympathy from a few persons possessing strangely-constituted minds ;
their only apparent reason being the fact that he was the most daring of Victorian
bushrangers. He was undergoing a sentence of 32 two years’ hard labour when he
headed the first outbreak of convicts at Williamstown, which resulted in the death
of a boatman named Owen Owens, whom he was accused of having killed with a
hammer, and for which he was sentenced to death at Melbourne, November 21,1856,
He was respited, but before the intelligence of that circumstance could reach him,
he had strangled himself in the Melbourne Gaol. This event occured on August
12, 1859, when the “ Captain ” was 35 years of age.
Macgregor,
Otherwise known as the “ Wild Scotchman,” was the most notorious bushranger in
Queensland. He came originally from New South Wales, and for some time
carried on his depredations single-handed. As there was but little gold at that
time discovered in the colony, his raids were principally on stations and travellers.
He was captured once, but managed to effect his escape on his way to Rockhamp-


Incidents in the careers of Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn’s Gang.

ton Gaol. At last he was (1863) after a chase of eighty miles, captured by two
magistrates, who managed to obtain fresh horses at various stations on the road,
while Macgregor had but the one. He was safely conveyed to Brisbane where he
was sentenced to twenty years’ hard labour.
Daniel Morgan.
This fellow carried the palm over all bushrangers for cool audacity and blood-
thirstiness. His murderous exploits at the Bound Hill Station were never equalled
in Australia. £5OO reward was offered by the New South Wales Government for
his apprehension, on Jan. 5, 1864. In June of that year he shot Sergeant
M’Ginnity dead, and went off with deceased’s horse and firearms. A verdict of
the wilful murder of John M’Lean was returned against him on June 23, 1864,
and a reward of £lOOO was offefed for his arrest by the N. S. W. Government on
June 27. In the following September he shot Sergeant Smith, who died a few
days afterwards. The reward offered by Government was now increased to £1,500
the intimation bearing date March 8, 1865. On April 6, 1865, he put in force a
threat often attributed to him, of making a raid on Victorian territory, and stuck
up the station of Mr. Evans, at Whitefield. Several carriers were also bailed up on
the road near Wilton. On April 9, following, he reached Mr. M’Pherson’s house,
at the Feechelba Station, some 20 miles from Wangaratta. He immediately
bailed-up all whom he found on the station, save a servant girl, who ran to the
house of Mr. Rutherford, a partner of Mr. M’Pherson’a. situated at a distance of
400 yards. A man was dispatched to Wangaratta, and the police force arrived,
which, combined with Rutherford’s men, made a party of about 28. The high-
wayman meanwhile unsuspectingly spent the evening in a free and easy manner,
Mrs. M’Pherson playing for his delectation on the piano. In the morning, after
reconnoitring in front of the house, he prepared to start. The force had been
carefully posted in ambush all round the place. After having duly breakfasted,
Morgan left, Mr, M’Pherson and three others going with him to the paddock to
get a mare. On his way he approached to within 100 yards of the ambush of
John Quinlan, a laboring man, who jumped from behind a tree and shot the bush-
ranger through the back. He died a few hours after without confessing anything.
Next day an inquest was held on the body, and the jury returned a verdict of jus-
tifiable homicide.
Benjamin Hall,
Was for some years a squatter in a small way in the Lachlan district, where he
made the acquaintance of Francis Gardiner, then a ticket-of-leave man in the
occupation of a butcher. Ben was for a long time suspected by the police of
being an accomplice of Frank and his gang, and the close surveillance held over
all his movements, together with the alleged misconduct of his wife, at length
drove him to desperation, and he openly joined “ the gang,” On the retirement
of Gardiner fiom his lawless career, Hall assumed command, and in company with
Gilbert and Dunn, soon became the terror of the Goulburn and Lachlan districts.
But Hall didn’t relish his new mode of life and determined to relinquish it; and
so, leaving Dunn and Gilbert, he applied to a connection, in whose hands he had
placed some money for safe-keeping, for the amount. This man, under pretence
of going into Forbes to obtain the money from the bank, revealed to the police
Hall’s hiding place, which they, under Sub-Inspector Davidson, closely surrounded
at night, and, as Hall arose next morning (May 5, 1865), his body was literally
riddled with slugs ; as many as 34 wounds being found on it. £l,OOO reward had
been offered for the capture of this unfortunate freebooter, £5OO of which his be-
trayer received, the other half of the blood-money been divided amongst the mem-
bers of the police present at his death.
John Gilbert.
This man, who was a native of Canada, and son of an old soldier, came, when
a boy, to New South Wales with his father. He was engaged as a stockman on a
station, near Marengo, from which place, lured by the false colouring given to
bushranging in the neighbourhood, he, in 1862, joined Gardiner’s He was
present at the sticking-up of the gold escort, in June of that year, and subsequently,
when Gardiner had left the gang, he, in company with Ben Hall and Dunn, made
his name a terror to the country. With his own hand he shot Sergeant Parry, who
deserted by his comrades, attempted to defend the Gundagai mail, on November
16, 1863. On May 13, 1865, being betrayed by the farmer in whose house he and


Dunn had got shelter for the night, he was shot in an encounter by Constable John
Bright, who, along with Constables Hales and King, had been brought to the spot
by the informer. John died at the early age of 22, or at most, 23.
John Dunn,
One of the Gardiner gang of bushrangers, was captured on the Marthaguy
Creek, below Dubbo, by Constable James A. G. M’Hale, assisted by Senior-Con-
stable Elliott and Constable Hawthorn. Dunn shot M’Hale in the leg, and was
himself wounded. He was tried, and hanged at Darlinghurst on Dec. 24, 1865.
Thomas Clarke.
This notorious scoundrel escaped from Braidwood Gaol, whilst under com-
mittal for robbery, being armed, October 3,1865. Then he stole a horse from
C. B. Dransfield, at Jembaicumbene, on Oct. 27. He stole one from Mulligan, at
the same place, on Dec. 1 ; one from John Mallon. of Mericumbene on Dec. 13 ;
robbed Mr. Hoskings, at Foxlow, on Dec. 29 ; Summer’s store, at Jembaicumbene,
on Jan. 13, 1866 ; he robbed Frazer and Matthinson on Major’s Creek Mountain,
on Jan. 13 ; the Araluen and Braidwood mail, on Jan. 15 ; John M’Elroy, at
Manar, on Feb, 10 ; the Michelago post office, on Feb. 14 ; Edward Eaton, at Crown
Flat, on Feb. 23 ; Cullen and Harnett, near Oooma, on March 22 ; the Nerrigun-
dah mail, on April 9, on which occasion Mr, John Emmett was wounded. He
murdered Miles O’Grady, at Nerrigundah, on April 9, and for so doing was out-
lawed. He it was too that robbed Morris’s store, at Mudmelong, on Feb. 23 ;
Armstrong’s store, at Araluen, on May 22 ; Levy and others, at Michelago, on
June 1: Thomas Wall, at Jindera, July 4; the Moruya mail—(mailboy’s horse
taken) on July 16; fired at the Ballalaba police on July 17 ; robbed the Yass
mail on July 27 ; the Queenbeyan Mail on July 30; F. H. Wilson, on Manar
Station, on July 24 ; Hoskings and Foxlow, on July 22, and also on September 10 ;
Myers and Badgery, at Jembaicumbene, on Aug. 27 ; a Chinaman, on the Araluen
Mountain, on Oct. 9 ; Joseph Taylor ar, Little Bombay, on Oct. 20 ; R. Smith and
T. Dawson, on Braidwood Road on Oct, 22 ; a number of Chinamen on the Araluen
Mountain, on Oct. 28 ; a Chinaman, at Jembaicumbene, on Nov. 20 ; a number
of Chinamen at Major’s Creek, on same day ; the Yass mail, at Razorback, on Dec. 7 ;
and a Chinaman at Mudmelong, on Dec. 31. He made an abortive attempt to rob
James Hyland, at Crown Flat, on Dec. 31. He was also suspected of murdering
the four special constables at Jindera, on Jan. 9,1867 : of robbing John Hornby,
on the Araluen Mountain, on Jan. 15 ; and Chowry and Lamb, at Mongarlo, on the
day previous ; of robbing James Myers, at Jembaienmbene, on Jan. 26 ; the Yass
mail, on Jan. 22 ; the Goulburn mail, on Feb. 22 ; and of being concerned in
feloniously wounding Constable Walsh and “ Sir Watkin,” the black tracker, when
being captured at Jindera, on April 27. He was tried at the Central Criminal
Court, Sydney, on May 29, and executed at Darlinghurst on June 25, 1867,
John Clarke.
This man’s career in the capacity of a bushranger did not extend beyond a

at Darlinghurst, June 25, 1867.


Captain Mooplite.


Capture of Captain Moonlite and Gang.


John William Westwood,
Better known as Jackey Jackey, was not, as from his soubriquet one would
naturally suppose, an aboriginal. He was born in County Kent, and transported
to N. S. W. in 1837, when he was assigned to Mr. Phillip King, at Gidleigh, 1840.
He absconded, and joined a scoundrel and a murderer named Paddy Curran who
was hanged at Berriraa in 1841. This Curran attempted to ill-treat a married
woman, when Jackey Jackey defended her, and threatened Curran’s life. He then
left, taking with him Curran’s horse, arms and ammunition, and hereafter
carried on his “ profession ” single-handed. He was arrested near Goulburn, and
when being escorted thence in June, 1841, escaped from the Bargo lock-up taking
with him the arms and accoutrements of one of the police. Two days after he
stuck up Mr. Francis M’Arthur, taking from his carriage a fine horse, and then
proceeded to Gray’s Inn, called the “ Black Horse,” some ten miles from Berrima,
where he was set upon by Mr. Gray, Mrs. Gray and Miss Gray (the latter showing,
extraordinary bravery), and a carpenter named Waters, who hit him on the head
with a shingling axe. Thus was he captured. The reward of £3O offered for his
apprehension was paid to Gray, and the convict, Waters, received a free pardon.
Jackey was sentenced to imprisonment for life, and sent to Cockatoo Island, N. S. W.,
from which he and 25 other desperadoes succeeded in swimming the Paramatta
to the mainland. But they were followed by the police in their boat, and all
re-captured. At a subsequent rising the convicts murdered the overseers, and then,
some hundreds in number, marched on Government House, under Jackey’s
command. They were, however, charged by the soldiery and made prisoners.
Eighteen of them were hanged, and amongst them the unfortunate Jackey
Jackey.
Frederick Ward,
Far better known as Captain Thunderbolt , was a stockman on Barney Downs
Station, in the New England district. He was a splendid horseman, and
possessed cool determined courage. Whilst serving a sentence he escaped from
Cockatoo Island. For some years he set at defiance the authorities in New
England. He once stuck up a German band in the Goonoo Goonoo gap, and, as
they pleaded hard for their money, he promised that if he should succeed in
robbing the principal winner at the Tenterfield races, for whom he was on the
look-out, he would return their money. This promise he faithfully kept by
sending them, much to their astonishment, to the Post Office at Warwick, the £2O
he had°taken from them. Subsequently when at a public house at Uralla, he was
surprised by two policemen. Instead of mounting his own horse, he jumped on
one belonging to a hawker, which turned out to be a bad one. A chase ensued.
One constable’s horse ran away with his rider ; the other (Alex. B. Walker) a
brave young fellow (afterwards Sub-Inspector) rode down Thunderbolt to a water-
hole, when a desperate duel ensued, resulting in the death of Thunderbolt.
May 25, 1870.
Henry Power,
Stuck up the mail coach near Porejauka, in the Ovens District, on May 7, 1869.
He also stuck up the Buckland mail coach within five miles of Beechworth. The
Government of Victoria offered £5OO lor his arrest on August 28, 1869. He was
captured on June 5, 1870, by Superintendents Nicholson and Hare and Sergeant
Montford while asleep in a hut on the Glenmore ranges, at the head of the King
River, Victoria. There was a revolver by his side, and a gun close to his head.
He was under the belief that he had been betrayed by Edward Kelly, who sub-
sequently became such a noted freebooter in the same locality. He was found guilty
at the Beechworth Assizes on three charges of robbery, and sentenced on August
2, 1870, to five years’ imprisonment on each charge, sentences to be cumulative. He
evinced bravado in Court, and on been sentenced requested the Judge to “draw
it mild.” This desperado was, a few years ago, in Adelaide, boasting of his exploits.
Andrew George Scott,
Better known as Captain Moonlite, was born in 1842 in the north of Ireland, and
brought up as a civil engineer. While still young he went to New Zealand,
joined the volunteers, saw some service against the Maoris, and got some slight
wounds. Arriving at Victoria, he entered the church, occupying the position of
lay reader to the Church of England at Bacchus Marsh, While in this position,
and quite friendly with the manager of the Egerton Bank, he went at night and


stuck up that establishment. This he did alone, masked and armed, taking
upwards of £2,000 in notes, coin, and gold. Though he was recognized afterwards
by the manager, he contrived to ward off suspicion from himself, and prove an
alibi; so the manager was arrested for the robbery, though eventually discharged.
Scott lived in Sydney afterwards in good style on his ill-gotten gains, but when
his funds got low, he engaged a yacht and crew and set sail for Fiji. He did not,
however, get far before he was arrested for passing a valueless cheque for £l5O, and
on this charge he was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. The cake of gold he
had stolen from the Bgerton Bank was found, and he had no sooner completed his
sentence than he was taken to Victoria and committed for trial for the robbery.
On this occasion he succeeded in cutting a hole through the cell wall at Ballarat
Gaol into that occupied by another prisoner, and the two gagged the warder and
tied him up. By means of the warder’s keys they liberated four other prisoners,
and, having torn a blanket into strips, all successfully got over the high wall of the
prison and escaped. Subsequently he was re-captured, and re-sentenced, but was
discharged in March, 1879, and then followed a variety of callings, he pretending to
lead an honest life whilst in reality plundering the public. He and several others
perpetrated some very heinous acta as bushrangers at a place called Wantabadgery
Station, situated about midway between Wagga Wagga and Gundagai, which was
stuck up on Sunday morning Nov. 16, 1879, by a gang of six men fully armed, the
manager was forced to supply them with food, and was subjected to some ill-treat-
ment. A boy carrying the mail was stopped and locked up. After a time,
however, information was conveyed to the Wagga police, and on Sunday night
four mounted troopers started for the scene. They arrived at the station about 4
o’clock on Monday morning, and came upon the bushrangers, who showed
resistance. Shots were exchanged, and the police dismounted to obtain cover.
The two parties were firing at each other for over two hours, the bushrangers
trying to surround them, and succeeding in cutting them off from their horses. The
constables had to retreat, but at Beveridge’s station were met by reinforcements
from Gundagai, raising their number to nine. They returned and again attacked
the bushrangers, and after a desperate engagement killed two of them and wounded
another in the arm. Two were captured, and the sixth made his
escape, but was afterwards caught. Constable Bowen, belonging to the Gun-
dagai detachment, was unfortunately dangerously wounded in the neck, and died
within a few days. The leader of the gang stated he was Captain Moonlite, the
notorious convict Scott. Another was identified as Nesbitt, a dangerous Victorian
criminal, who some time previously attempted to effect his escape from Pentridge.
The New South Wales police deserved great credit for the determined manner in
which they both in this instance and a few months previously in the case of the
Balranald bushrangers summarily put a stop to these attempts to revive the bush-
ranging exploits of years gone by. The courage and tenacity shown by them on
both these occasions reflect the highest honor on the force. The New South Wales
Government awarded Senior-Sergeant Carroll, £100; Sergeant Cassion, £75; and
£6O to each of the constables engaged in the encounter. Constable Bowen was in
his 28th year, the son of a minister, and a thorough plucky fellow. His untimely
end was therefore the more regretted. Moonlite and Bogan were hanged in Sydney on
Jan. 20, 1880. Nesbitt, and another was shot dead in the encounter, and Williams
and Bennett were sentenced to imprisonment for life on account of their youth.
At the trial after receiving sentence of death, Scott made a long speech ; he
said that though he was aware that he had already wasted the time of the jury in
speaking, he felt he must waste the time of the Court a little longer. When he was
arrested upon this charge he was brought to Gundagai, and every place he went to he
saw that public opinion was against him. He came on to Sydney, and saw the same
feeling roll on and gather strength. He did not mean to say that the gentlemen
of the jury had wilfully been influenced. He believed they had fairly tried to do
what was considered justice ; but he would say he felt that the Crown had unduly
hastened the trial. Had public opinion gone down, he did not think the verdict
would have been the same. The Press of the colony had commented upon his
prior life, and on every little incident since then. All those remarks had been
thrown into the scale, and had helped to bring him there that day. He was
perfectly aware that the gentlemen of the jury did not know that they were
influenced, but he believed it, and hp might say knew it ; and sad as the fact
was they could not possibly help being influenced. He Bad already
spoken at great length upon the evidence, but he must say a word
or two more, and speak of that evidence again. A number of the
witnesses who had appeared there had not spoken the truth. He was aware that

hia Honor would do hia duty and aentencehim to death, and standing there aa he
did with the warm blood pouring through every vein in hia body, he was to be
sentenced to death ; and he knew it was coming, and did not fear it, though he did
not say this from braggadocio, but aa one standing in that position he told them
that a great deal of that evidence waa perjury ; that perjury had been used
against Hogan and the other two boys in reference to the Colt’a revolvers, and that
the perjurers knew it. He went to hia fate on the scaffold and believed he waa a
happier man than the man who would go into that box and swear a lie. He knew
that his case would be discussed before the Executive, and that the Attorney-
General would be the principal person to deal with it, and yet he could not pass
over his conduct in conducting the prosecution without reprobating it. He
stood there as a Crown Prosecutor, and called him (Scott) ruffian and scoundrel
when he had spoken more truth and as much common sense as he (the Attorney-
General) had ever spoken in his life. Now that he was about to appear before a
God, fearing none of them, he said he spoke the truth in every word he uttered.
He was going to join his friend Nesbitt, who was a brave man, and it was because
he was a brave and humane man that they stood there that day. Nesbitt was as
true-hearted a man as ever lived. He had told Mrs. McGlede to go into the
chimney for safety because it was built of stone —he would have scorned to put a
woman in a position of danger to save himself. He (Nesbitt) was not afraid but
had a feeling he waa about to die. Nesbitt had been early and well trained, being
brought up by the Christian Brothers in Melbourne, and that early training was
not without its influence. He (Scott) had that double-barrelled gun, and he knew
how to use it. Had it not been for Nesbitt it would not have been constable Bowen
only that they would have had to mourn, for he could have shot every one of the
police. He thanked them for the recommendation to mercy of his friends, because
he thought that some mistake he had made in his defence might have brought
them in some degree to that sad position, and if that recommendation to mercy
was attended to, he would say “ Do not let them remain so long in gaol—in a
living tomb—that when they come out they have no hope for the future ” He had
been for years in Pentridge. The friend he loved most in the world was Nesbitt,
but they had been hunted down by the police—hunted round Melbourne and
through the colony, and had been hunted to death -to the death that his Honor
now doomed him to. He had never felt more weary of life, and more willing to die
than he did that day, for had not the Attorney-General raised the sledge of Erskine,
Brougham, Curran and Grattan, as he stood in his place on the floor of the Court,
and called him a hypocritical scoundrel. He had said that he knew who fired the
shot that killed Bowen, but since he said that, it had become a subject of very
grave doubt whether he was not mistaken, for the man who he had believed fired
the shot knew nothing about firearms, and Bowen was shot at a distance at which
it would have been impossible for him to have done it. It must have been a stray
shot and there was, therefore, no intention of shooting him, and he could say for
his own part that he had no intention of committing murder nor had he committed
murder. He had heard of men in the position in which he was placed forgiving
the witnesses against them, shaking hands with the hangman and so on. He
never could forgive these witnesses, for he had a great contempt for them. He
stood there as a truthful man in that position and in that dock, to look down with
pride upon the witnesses he could see around him. In the future it would be
known that he had stood there and had spoken the truth. The question had been
asked why, if they had no object, did they waste their money in buying the arms ;
but they did not buy any ; all the arms they had were his property, and had been
for years. They had not much money, and what they had they spent in the bare
necessaries of life. The Attorney-General had said they had crossed the Murray
with the intention of committing a raid on the colony, but there was not a blood-
thirsty man amongst them—not one. The police came to Wantabadgery, and
never cried “ Surrender 1 ” until they fired. He then fired the bulldog Hill’s
Extractor, and the five police—as he believed them to be then—ran away from the
two men, Nesbitt and himself. Nesbitt was afterwards a martyr to his wish to
shed no blood, and he (Scott) would rather lie alongside him than be one of the
witnesses sending him there. They had lost one brave man, Bowen, and were
going to send him to his death to pay the penalty. Now he asked them if he paid
the penalty was his blood not sufficient ? He repeated his former statements
respecting the penal establishment at Pentridge, and said that he would ask them,
in this colony to make their penal establishments what they ought to be ; and
continued ; —Mr, Want had spoken hardly of him, but as that gentleman had so ably
defended the boys who stood in the dock with him, he thanked him. If he had been


unjust to the Attorney-General—if that gentleman thought he could justify in his own
mind his own conduct, he would withdraw what he had said if it were impertinent.
He believed that the jury, in coming to a decision, had been labouring under a
prejudice—a prejudice that he did not think they could have avoided ; but he
believed they had received as fair a trial as possible, and he thanked his Honor.
He believed his wish was to do justice, and he believed the jury had come to what
they believed to be a right conclusion. If it were a fact that a gentleman was on
the jury who could not understand English he was not a fit person to be in the
jury box. Supposing he (Scott) escaped from the death penalty, his Honor would
give him fourteen to twenty-eight years in a penal establishment, and what hope
would he then have for the future. Could he look anywhere to make a home for
his old age ? No. Now he could follow a brave and true spirit to eternity. He
was approaching eternity, and as the veil hiding eternity became clearer, a person
could, he believed, see with clearer eyes. He believed there was an Almighty God,
who judged us all by the broad page of his life ; and he believed that God would
show him more mercy than his fellow-men would show him ; and he could look
forward with hope beyond the grave, and stand on the gallows without one
trembling limb and meet his fate. When he was gone do not load him with
infamy. He had a father and a mother in another land —do not harrow their souls
by abusing him. Now, he asked the Press, he asked public opinion, that had
hunted him down and run him to the gallows, to let him rest. Let them write
what they would on his stained grave now, and leave the rest to time. Write it
again in years to come, and then it would be said he had gone down to the grave under
remarkable circumstances, he was wrecked by the cruelty and hardness of those
who call themselves Christians. Your church bells toll on Sundays, and you all
preach charity ; but, tell me, where does the charity exist ? Do you not all
disgrace the name of Jesus Christ. Show mfe the number of {homeless children in
your streets, and the number of prisoners that pass from Darlinghurst and meet
with no charity 1 You may give your sixpence, and your names are in the papers,
but go and speak one kindly word, and tell them to look up with hope. Don’t run
them to misery and the gallows. Don’t issue tickets when human beings, with
immortal souls in danger, are being tried for their lives, as if they were an exhibi-
tion. Pass a law that when a prisoner is charged before a criminal court no
evidence be published, that no remarks be published. Brand as a murderer any
person who in print will put a slander about a man in the dock. That young
fellow there (Rogan, whom Scott indicated by patting him on the back) he saw
once in Melbourne, and not having a farthing in his pocket he took his coat off his
back, went and pledged it, and gave him (Scott) the money. He followed him
(Scott), would have worked for him and have come to the dock and perhaps to
the grave with him. He regretted that he had broken the laws of the country,
but he regretted far more the fact that poor Nesbitt lay in his grave than that the
brave Bowen lay in his. He was sorry for Bowen, but more sorry for Nesbitt and
Wreneckie, and far more for these boys (the younger prisoners) beside him. He
was not mad, and never was mad. You have all brought me to the gallows (he
continued), and left me there, and I will die a man looking to my God, and fear-
less of my fate, I would not like to be branded as this great scoundrel and
notorious criminal, and if it is not wrong for me to make the request, I should
like my body to be given to my friends. Is that right your Honor ?
. Honor : I have nothing whatever to say to that.
should be buried within the precincts of the gaol ?
His Honor ; It is not part of the sentence.
Scott; Would such a request as I make be illegal ?
His Honor : This is a matter that in no way comes before me ; it rests
entirely with the executive.
Scott : I should like to make the request, because I should like my body to be
buried in Gundagai. I think I have some friends who will send it up there, if it is
not much expense. He knew he was about to leave this world, and he could look
forward with a perfect faith in the future. He was not going to make any
profession of religion or any penitence with reference to the things he had done.
The only thing he could do now was to die as a man. He did not know whether
he would be allowed to see his fellow-prisoners, but he would like to see
these boys again before he died. Treat them leniently, and when they went back
to their living tomb, shorten their time ; if they were to be sent long to gaol let
them die with him and go to God Almighty, where they might receive the mercy
denied them here,

Remarkable Career of Morgan. (See page 10.)


The Kelly Gang sticking up the Police Station at Jerilderie.


John Joseph Sullivan,
The New Zealand bushranger, was one of the most cruel. With Thomas Kelly
alias Noon, Richard Burgess alias Hill, and Philip Levy, he was for some time the
terror of the Maungatapu Mountains. When captured by the police Sullivan
turned Queen’s evidence and proved how they planned the murder of Mathieu,
Kempthorn, Dudley (storekeeper), and De Pontius (a miner), who. on June 12,
1866, left Deep Greek for Nelson, and were murdered the following day whilst
crossing the Maungatapu Mountain. Three of the party were shot by the murder-
ers, and the fourth was strangled with Sullivan’s scarf. They also murdered poor
“ Old Jamie ” in a manner even more horrible than that of the above four men,
and took from him £3. Besides Mr. G. Dobson, surveyor, whom they strangled,
and left at the foot of a tree in a sitting position (g,s if he had died from exhaustion),
but whom they afterwards buried, these fiends are supposed to have committed
more than thirty murders in New Zealand alone. They carried with them a
bottle containing strychnine, having resolved that if any party they encountered
were too strong for them, they would make friends, and whilst drinking with them
administer the poison, and then rob them, Burgess stated that he began his
criminal career at the age of eight. He had been a lawyer’s clerk, and was the
chief of the band.
Mr. R, Rae, a contribute!' to the West Coast Times of New Zealand, gives
an account of an interview he had some years ago with the bushranger Joseph
Sullivan, when living near Wedderburn, in Victoria. Sullivan was one of the
four blood-stained criminals who waylaid and murdered a party of storekeepers
on the road between Wakamarina and Nelson. This happened in 1866. Three
were hanged, Sullivan saving his life by turning Queen’s evidence. After the
trial he came over to Victoria, where he had great difficulty in obtaining a living,
Eventually he went to England, Mr. Rae’s narrative of his talk with Sullivan is
as follows ;
In the winter of 1871, one wet and dreary evening of that period, 1 was on
my way from Inglewood to Sandhurst. The coach stayed for a couple of hours at
a small mining village called Wedderburn. It was here that Sullivan at that
time resided, having not long previously returned to the Sandhurst district after a
visit to England. It occurred to me, as I was waiting in the township, that I might
visit thp notorious and champion murderer of the world. I mentioned my in-
tention to the landlord of the hotel at which I stayed. “ Landlord,’’ I said, I
believe Sullivan lives hereabouts; I think I will call and see him. Can you
direct me to his dwelling ? ” The landlord was struck with amazement. He did
not know me, and he viewed me from head to foot very carefully. Then the
truth seemed to flash across his mind. “Ah I see now,” he said “ you are the
press. Very well. If the press chooses to run into danger, and associate
with the very devil himself in human form, that’s no affair of mine.
Sullivan lives down the road in a bark mia-mia ; the hut is beside the highway,
it’s the first one you meet, and you will get to it in ten minutes. Everybody here,
except the larrikins, are different to you. They think they cannot get out of
sight of the murderer’s den quick enough.”
The hut was scarcely a quarter of a mile distant, and presently I stood opposite
the pieces of wood which did duty as a door. It was quite dark, and a drenching
rain fell. I knocked. An angry voice asked “ Who’s there, and what do you
want ? ” 1 answered both questions unreservedly, and immediately Sullivan
opened the door, and invited me inside. He scrutinized me with anxious and
restless glances at first, but soon he got more at ease, and he asked me to sit down
on the only seat in the hut —a log by the fire, Sullivan, was I understood, some-
what of a dandy in his day, but now he was ragged and dirty, and a more
desolate and utterly broken and starved villian it would be hard to find on this earth.
The only light in the place was that afforded by a piece of rag in a sardine tin con-
taining a little fat, and the flickering of a fire made at the end of a stump of a tree,
which stretched from one end of the hut to the other. There was no table, and the only
bed consisted of a few rags and newspapers thrown on some saplings. Another tin did
duty as a tea kettle; a smaller one was Sullivan’s cup ; while his plate was a
piece of delf —the segment of a circular willow pattern plate. I asked Sullivan
why he did not cut some wood so as to make a proper fire, and this question led to
a full narrative of his woes.
“No one here,” he said, “ will lend me an axe. They all hate me, and try to
drive me mad, and they have nearly done so. They won’t sell me anything or


lend me anything, or buy anything from me. They won’t speak to me, not a soul
of them. If Igo into a public-house I can’t get a drink, or a look at the paper, or
a civil word." He took a wooden match-box from his pocket, and showed me in it
a couple of pennyweights or so of gold. “ I have a tin dish,” he said, “ and I
fossick about in the gullies, getting a few grains now and then. I cannot sell the
gold here; I have to go to Inglewood to sell it. No one at Wedderburn would
buy this gold from me if I were dying with hunger, and I am hungry half my time.”
I could not see how, under these circumstances, he lived at all, and I asked
how then he got food. He told me that there was a very poor Irishwoman, whom
he never spoke to, in the township, who left some bread, meat, tea, and sugar oc-
casionally, and by stealth in the night, outside for him, and for the rest he had to
go to Inglewood for supplies, when he had a bit of gold to sell. “ Most likely she
thinks me a Catholic, because my name is Sullivan,’ he said : “ but at all events
she is the only one here who has the slightest mercy, or pity, or compassion for
me. But ” he said “ for God’s sake don’t mention this woman to any one in the
township, for they would find her out, and lead her the life of a dog ever after if
they knew she was kind to me. They would hunt her and hoot her down, and cut
her off from human intercourse, as they have hunted and hooted and cut me. They
would either drive her away altogether, or lead her the misery they lead me a
life worse than the life of hell 1 ” And now the wretched scoundrel’s anger was
raised, and his countenance glared with a strange, half insane, half diabolical
expression. He paced up and down the miserable hut in violent agitation. It
struck me that he was consumed, often perhaps, but certainly now with a terrible
remorse. I asked him to calm himself ; to sit down beside me on the log by the fire,
and tell me exactly what part he took in the awful business that brought him
to such infamy. It was then that the cleverness of the man of which I had prev-
iously heard much—revealed itself. He sat down for a while, but presently he
rose again as he grew warm with the tale of horrors he was revealing, and for an
hour or more he entered into a history and a defence with singular, if untutored,
eloquence. I need not relate what he said, for I knew that his account of the
fearful transactions he was describing with such apparent truth was a tissue of lies.
Outside the hut the wind was howling, and the rain was descending in torrents,
and he caught at these facts, and made use of them in his account, introducing the
raging wind and the teeming rain that blew and fell as the work of death went
on. He then told of his departure from New Zealand, and how whispers and
murmurs, threats, scorn, obloquy, pursued him everywhere. Day and night he
heard voices saying, “ That’s Sullivan the murderer.’ At Liverpool, when he
landed there, he was not ten minutes on the wharves'before he was pointed out,
and he heard the people mutter “ That’s him ! ” as he went along, until at length a
crowd gathered around him, and he had some trouble to escape from their growing
rage. It was the same no matter where he went. At Sandhurst, on the way up to
Wedderburn, 3,000 people awaited his arrival at the railway station, and jeered and
hooted him out of the town. At night, as he laid in his hut, voices disturbed and
woke him with the same cry, “ That’s Sullivan the murderer 1 Visions made him
get up and light fires in the dead of the night, and human voices were ever
whispering in his ears, as he turned and tossed and struggled to get oblivion and
sleep. Now he heard the voice of one victim—now of another ; and now they were
all assembled together and driving him mad with a chorus of howls, demanding
his instant death. And yet he said he was innocent of the actual crime of wilful
murder.
I thought Sullivan was not altogether an arrant coward, for if he was he would
surely have sought relief from his tortures by death long ago, and I told him this.
But he said that it was cowardice that made him live. His horror of death was
even greater than his horror of life. He dreaded to live, but he dreaded more to
die. He would like to get away in the night unknown to the detectives and the
police and the people, and go to some distant country where he would not be
known. But he could not do it. He was watched and followed everywhere, and
if it were possible to be a thousand miles away, in the morning there the police
would be waiting ; there would the people be congregated to howl at him ; there
would be again the voices dinning, “ That’s Sullivan the murderer 1 ” in his ears.
That was how it was he remained at Wedderburn. He was as well there, perhaps even
better, than he could be anywhere else. As I was leaving Sullivan, he went to the
head of his bed, and from a small bundle there he produced a set of gold sleeve-
links. He told me he had come by them honestly, but he could make no use of
them, and as I was the first person who had spoken a friendly word to him for
years, he begged me to accept them as a gift. I declined the honour. Shortly




Nod Kelly.


after my visit to Wedderburn the life of the man became so unbearable, and it
was, besides, so evident that his health and strength were utterly wrecked, and that
he was henceforth powerless of harm, that the Government of Victoria helped him
to get out of the country, and gave directions which prevented either the police or
the people learning his destination. And so he escaped. One morning the hut
was found deserted, and the great gaol bird had flown—no one knew whither.
The Kelly Gang.
Prior to the year 1878 the Kellys were not known beyond the neighbourhood of
Greta, a small township on the King River, near Beech worth, Victoria, where they
had long resided, and followed the pursuit of stock-breeding, or rather “ cattle
duffing,” as the appropriation of animals from the herds of one’s neighbour is
designated. They were several times in prison for this offence, and though young
in years gradually grew old in crime. No outrages like those which have since
marked their career could then be charged against them, and the family were even
regarded by some as persecuted by the police. The first crime of any magnitude
and which developed the latent evil propensities of the Kellys, was their brutal
conduct towards Constable Fitzpatrick, who. in April. 1878, attempted to arrest
Daniel Kelly, then about 17 years of age, at the house of his mother, at Greta, on a
charge of horse-stealing. The officer was attacked by the other members of the
family beaten unmercifully, and then allowed to depart. He had scarcely mounted
his horse than the whole party pursued him, and he had to gallop for his life. The
mother (Mrs. Kelly), with her sons Ned and Dan, were subsequently convicted of
the assault at the Beech worth Sessions, but the two men absconded, and a reward
of £IOO was thereupon offered by the Government for their apprehension. Nothing
was heard of their whereabouts till October, when intelligence was received at
Mansfield that the Kellys had been seen in company with two others named Hart
and Byrne, near the Stringybark Creek, in the Wombat Ranges, about twenty
miles from Mansfield. Hearing this Sub-Inspector Pewtress dispatched a party
of four, comprising Sergeant Kennedy and Constables Lanigan, Scanlon, and
Mclntyre to arrest the brothers. Arrived at the scene of operations, in a thickly-
timbered country, the police party camped for the night, and on the following
morning were attacked by four armed men, of whom two were recognized as the
brothers Kelly. The intention of the police to effect the capture of these two
ruffians must have been known by the murderers ; who were thus enabled to attack
the constables at a disadvantage. Lanigan and Mclntyre were in charge of the
camp, the other two officers been engaged in searching for the Stringybark Creek.
The four suddenly made their appearance, and ordered Lanigan and Mclntyre to
deliver up their arras. Mclntyre was unarmed, but Lanigan bravely attempted to
draw his revolver from behind his back, and was shot dead by the ruffianly band.
Soon afterwards Kennedy and Scanlon approached the camp, and on their arrival
were confronted by the murderers. Scanlon, on been ordered to deliver up his
arms, rushed for the shelter of a tree, attempting to draw his revolver as he ran,
but he, too, was shot dead, Mclntyre caught a horse, and dashing off at full speed
managed to escape. As he left Sergeant Kennedy was exchanging shots with the
bushrangers. Mclntyre reached Mansfield on foot, and communicated the start-
ling intelligence of the terrible tragedy. A strong and well-armed search party
instantly accompanied Sub-Inspector Pewtress to the scene of the murders, and
found the bodies of Scanlon and Lanigan, pierced with bullets and their pockets
rifled. About ten days supply of provisions, ammunition, and horses also fell into
the bands of the robbers. The body of Sergeant Kennedy was not discovered for
several days after, and when found was observed to be riddled with bullets. It
was strongly suspected that the gang kept him a prisoner as long as it suited their
caprice, and then blew out his brains. This is a popular opinion, notwithstanding
Ned Kelly’s statement that Sergeant Kennedy was killed by him in a fair fight,
A handsome monument has been erected in the main thoroughfare at Mans-
field, Victoria, to commemorate this tragic event, and was unveiled by Captain
Standish, Chief Commissioner of Police, on 21st April, 1880. It stands 25 feet
high, is ornamental and artistic, and bears the following inscription.—
On the east side—“ In memoriam, Michael Kennedy, born at Westmeath,
Ireland, aged 36 years ; Thomas Lanigan, born at Sligo, Ireland, aged 34 years ;
Michael Scanlon, born at Kerry, Ireland, aged 35 years. This monument is
erected by subscriptions from the inhabitants of Victoria and New South Wales
A. D. 1880." On the west side —“ To the memory of three brave men, who lost their
lives while endeavouring to capture a band of armed criminals in the Wombat


Kanges near Mansfield, 26th October, 1878.” On the north and south sides the
inscriptions detail the number of years which the murdered men served in the
police force.
Public excitement in Melbourne and all the towns throughout Victoria reached
its height when the tidings of these terrible murders were fully known, and it was
felt that stringent measures were necessary to cheek the career of the bloodthirsty
villains who had so successfully escaped their deserts. All sections and grades of
society were strongly interested, and consequently on the qui-vive in anticipation
of hearing of the arrest or death of the Kellys.
The Victorian Parliament, feeling it imperative to take prompt steps to bring
the murderers of the police to justice, in November, 1878, passed an Outlawry Bill,
the provisions of which declared the Kelly gang outlaws, and permitted any one
to shoot them wherever they might be found. A reward of £SOO each for
their capture was considered sufficient stimulus to effect it, but this sum was after
a few months increased to double the amount, and later on to £2,000 or £B,OOO
in all, for the whole of the gang—dead or alive.
It was not till December 9, 1878, that any reliable information as to the
movements of the Kellys could be obtained. They were supposed to have reached
shelter in the inaccessible ranges which stretch far away in the background past
Longwood, Euroa, Violet Town, and with a few intermissions of level country unite
with the mountainous region of Gippsland. From these vast and beetling heights
every movement or advance of hostile parties along the verdant valleys below can
be observed, and an army, however brave, could be successfully routed or
slaughtered by a handful of men. No wonder the Kellys with the knowledge they
possessed of this locality, were able so long to elude pursuit and capture, or that
their friends were able to convey provisions and necessaries to them without
detection.
On the date just mentioned two daring and skilfully-planned robberies were
perpetrated by the outlaws at Mr. Younghusband’s Faithful Creek Station, and at
the branch of the National Bank of Australasia, Euroa, The particulars are as
follows :
At about half past 12 in the day a man went to the homestead at Mr. Young-
husband’s Faithful Creek Station, about four miles from Euroa. Accosting a
stationhand (Fitzpatrick) he learned that the manager, Mr. Macauley, was from
home, and then signalled to three companions, who had remained at some distance.
When they came up he announced himself as Ned Kelly and demanded refresh-
ments for the four, and fodder for their horses. After enquiring about thenumber of
hands on the station, Kel'y locked Fitzpatrick and a lad who was present up in
a storeroom, and three other men who came in soon after to dinner were added
to them. Mr. Macauley next arrived, and had to surrender, and then the outlaws
sat down to dinner, two at a time, but refused to eat or drink anything that some
of the others did not first partake of. Their horses were stabled and fed, and when
Kelly and his gang had had enough the imprisoned men were allowed some food.
Towards evening a hawker drove to the outskirts of the station and prepared to
encamp for the night. He and his boy were also secured in a like manner, and
placed with the other prisoners. The contents of the hawker’s cart were next
taken out and strewn about the ground, and the outlaws treated themselves to an
entirely new outfit from head to foot, with soaps and perfumery. They kept one
of their number constantly on guard, and by the time all had completed
their toilet it was nearly dark. Shortly afterwards they went to sleep, two at a
time, the other two keeping watch. Those who were awake conversed freely with
the prisoners even respecting the murder of the constables near Mansfield ; thu? the
night passed away.
In the morning they broke down all the line of telegraph on both sides of
the North-Eastern railway, which was near to and in sight of the homestead. This
prevented communications with Benalla, where there was a large force of police.
Breakfast was had, and then a spring cart drove up to the station containing
two neighbouring selectors and two visitors from Melbourne, who had been
kangarooing. These four were also bailed up, and placed with the other captives
in the storeroom. A cheque bearing Mr. Macauley’s signature was next taken
from the desk, and between 3 and 4 o’clock p. m. the two Kellys and Hart started
for Euroa, leaving Byrne to guard the prisoners. They took two carts with them,
the hawker’s boy driving a vehicle, and Hart riding a horse. It was scarcely
4 o’clock p. m. when they drove to the door of the bank, and Ned Kelly obtained
entrance from the bank clerk on the pretence of wanting cash for a cheque. When
inside he and Hart made the clerks surrender by presenting revolvers, and they

all went into the room of Mr. Scott, the manager, and placed him under arrest.
They next obtained the keys by intimidation, and bundled all the notes and specie
into a sack, the amount being about £2,f 00, an ingot of about 31 ozs. of smelted
gold, 268 ozs. of gold, and a number of securities. They drank whisky with Mr,
Scott, and made Mrs. Scott, with her children, and two maid servants, get ready
to ride out. The horse was put into Mr. Scott’s buggy, which his wife had to drive,
the occupants being herself, her mother, and some children. The clerks, servants,
Mr. Scott, and other children were placed in carts, and the cavalcade started for
Faithful Creek Station, the hawker’s cart being first with Ned Kelly.in charge,
then the buggy, followed by the selector’s spring cart, driven by Dan Kelly, the
rear brought up by Steve Hart on horseback. Passing out of the place they had
to go close to the one policeman who kept order in the town, the railway officials,
and a number of men employed in building a new station, but they were unheeded,
and went on, and reached Mr. Younghusband’s station in time to take tea. Byrne
had increased the number of his prisoners by capturing a line-repairer, who had
been sent to put the wires in order, and who on arrival found them in such a state
that he had to seek aid, and went to the homestead for that purpose. The outlaws
did not hurry themselves, but waited until 9 o’clock p. m., when they took their
departure. Previous to doing so they liberated Mr. Macauley, and directed him
to keep the other men shut up till they had gone three hours, but he let them out
a quarter of an hour after they left. Information was conveyed to the police, and
efforts made to follow the gang, who made off to the Strathbogie Ranges.
After this successful exploit the Kellys remained quiet in their lair, doubtless
carousing over their ill-gotten gains, and laughing at the inability of their pursuers
to reach them. A month, however, of idleness, if spent among romantic scenery,
with conversation relative to dark deeds only, would be more than sufficient even
for a bushranger ; and it is not surprising that we hear of their entrance once
more into public life, and another step towards notoriety on February 8. 1879.
About midnight on that date, having crossed the border from Victoria, to
New South Wales, they stuck up the township of Jerilderie, thirty miles from the
Murray, made prisoners of two constables (Devine and Richards) at the Police
Station, put on police uniforms, and went round the town boldly, and reconnoitred.
Next day they had their horses shod at the local blacksmith’s shop, took possession
of the Royal Hotel, bailed up the Bank of New South Wales officials, and obtained
from them £2,000. Jerilderie contains upwards of 200 inhabitants, and it seems
astounding that four men could so completely paralyze their efforts as to prevent
their making the least resistance.
The constables and their families were kept under strict surveillance from
Saturday night till Monday at noon, without anyone in the township supposing
for a moment that dangerous individuals were in the locality. The sticking up of the
bank proved a simple matter. Mr. Tarleton, the manager, had just returned from a
long ride, and was enjoying a cold bath. Mr. Lyving heard the noise of approach-
ing footsteps, from the rear, but thinking it was the manager paid no attention
until roused by the entrance of Byrne, who immediately ordered him to bail up,
stating, at the time, that he was Ned Kelly, and presenting a revolver. Mr,
Lyving and his fellow-assistant saw resistance was useless, and surrendered.
They then marched to the Royal Hotel, where they found the Kellys had placed
a number of persons in a room, whom they threatened to shoot if they offered the
least resistance. Kelly enquired for Mr. Tarleton, and brought back Mr. Lyving
to the bank to find him. The manager was surprised in his bath, and bailed up af t.er
the usual fashion. He was utterly incapable of doing anything other than directed.
The bushrangers proceeded to rob the safe, and after some little trouble succeeded
in securing over £2,000 principally in gold. The money was placed in a sack and
conveyed away, the bank officials being brought back to the hotel. While in the
bank two men named Rankine and Gill entered, and Kelly ordered them to bail
up, whereupon they turned and fled precipitately, Ned Kelly following in close
pursuit. Gill contrived to escape, and remained hidden, in a creek adjacent, until
danger had passed ; but Rankine was not so fortunate. He was overtaken by the
outlaws, and roughly handled. Indeed, his chances for life were not worth much,
as Kelly seemed in a terrible rage, and desirous of shooting him. His life
was only saved by the intercesssion of those in the hotel. Constable Richards
seemed a special object of revenge to the desperadoes, Ned Kelly resolutely
declared he should die, as he had been engaged in pursuing him. However Mr.
Tarleton’s good offices saved the man’s life, as the outlaw gradually relented and
did not carry his threat into execution. The telegraph operator and his
assistant were next waited on ; the wires cut and the insulators destroyed. These


officials were also conveyed to the hotel, where there was about twenty-five persons
expecting every moment something might occur to cause bloodshed. The men
were so desposed that in the event of resistance, and one being overcome, another
stood ready with a loaded rifle ready to fire. Ned Kelly “shouted” for several
persons, and became quite conversational. He expressed a desire to have a docu-
ment printed giving a sketch of his life, and sought Mr. Gill, publisher of a local
paper, for that purpose. But Mr. Gill remained nonest , and his wife wasconsulted.
She expressed her unwillingness to comply with the request and the document
was given to Mr. Lyving, who undertook to have it published. In the meantime
Byrne had mounted his horse, and with the money taken from the bank in his
possession took his departure in the direction of the Murray. To facilitate his
escape with the plunder, the Kellys and Hart remained about the hotel for several
hours. Before leaving they directed the telegraph station-master not to connect
the wires before morning, or he might expect condign punishment. Towards dusk
the remainder of the gang followed Byrne stating that they were going to stick up
the bank at Urana. They had no sooner left the township than steps were taken
to restore telegraphic communication, and in the course of a few hours Sydney
and Melbourne were in possession of the startling intelligence.
After this daring outrage the search for the Kellys became hotter than ever,
and native police well-known for their skill in tracking, were brought from
Queensland to trace their hiding places. These men, however, having no com-
mencing clue to guide them, failed in accomplishing the desired end, and admitted
their inability to find the slightest trace of aught indicating the spot in which the
outlaws lay perdu. From February, 1879 up to June, 1880, they were never seen or
heard of, and so impressed were many persons with the belief they had got safely
out of the colonies that the police force was reduced in the suspected district, and
the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria decided to withdraw the large
reward promised for their capture.
The first tidings of the reappearance of the Kellys was telegraphed to the
metropolis of each of the colonies on the 27th June, 1880. and the tale of crime
revealed in a few words, created a profound sensation. In Adelaide especially,
the history of the past, in which these bloodthirsty villains figured so prominently,
was unforgotten, and the direful tidings added thereto only served to swell the
catalogue of horrors with which memory was laden. A police watch-party
headed by Constable Sherritt, were located in a slab house at Sebastopol, seven miles
from Beechworth, and near the residence of the mother of one of the outlaws, their
orders being to watch the communication between her and the gang. On Saturday
evening, June 26, the four outlaws having surrounded the hut under cover of
darkness, and having a Herman named Antonio Weeks with them as decoy, made him
go to the door and call out “ Sherritt.” The constable, naturally concluding it
to be a friend, opened the door, when Byrne, who was close to it, shot him dead,
exclaiming as he did so. “ You’ll not blow any more what you’ll do with us.” The
other police were then asked to surrender, but refused to do so, and the hut was
in a state of seige for hours, during which shots were fired into it, and threats of
burning it down and committing other atrocities were uttered by the gang. At
early morn the villains withdrew to perform sanguinary exploits in a new
direction, and the besieged constables were enabled to reach Beechworth and relate
their experiences and the death of their comrade.
Glenrowan, on the north-Eastern railway line, 139 miles from Melbourne,
was the next and final scene in their desperate career, and the tragedy there
enacted equals all conjectured by the wildest imagination in the sphere of
romance. There has been nothing to compare with it in the annals of Australia,
and nothing approaching it will, we trust, ever again be chronicled. The doings
of bushrangers in the olden time fade into insignificance before those of the demoniac
Kellys which are on a par only with the violent acts of the madman Morgan.
Arrived at Glenrowan, the door of the station-master’s house was burst open
and Mr. Stanistreet, who was in bed with his wife and children, was subjected to
the indignity of having to rise immediately and dress. Ned Kelly then bade
him accompany him and take up the rails on the line as a special train was ex-
pected ; but the station-master having stated his inability to assist in the bush-
ranger’s request, was left in charge of Steve Hart, whilst the rest went down towards
Wangaratta to obtain assistance to demolish the rails. During their absence
Hart broke open the chest in which were some workmen’s tools. The rails were
eventually taken up by the gang, assisted by Keardon, the line repairer, for fully
a mile ; and but for the precaution of a pilot-engine being sent ahead of the

special train, a serious accident would have occurred, and the latter wrecked by
these miscreants.
Having completed their work they went to Jones’s Hotel to wait results, and
passed the time in driuking and making prisoners, adding to their number at
intervals, every person who came in their way. It may be considered a merciful
interposition of Providence that the police, under Superintendent Hare and Sub-
Inspector O’Connor, reached Glenrowan safe, and were, on arrival, informed by
Mr. Curnow, the local schoolmaster, of the true state of affairs. He is certainly
deserving of the highest praise for his prompt action and courage in stopping the
train and preventing a fatal catastrophe. The local constable had been made
prisoner, but had escaped, and the information he gave showed there was
no time to lose. Jones’s Hotel was instantly surrounded, and fighting promptly
commenced, the police acting with considerable coolness and decision, and the
outlaws showing a determined defiant front. Within the house at this time there
were over thirty prisoners, who at a latter period succeeded in effecting their escape
by the front door whilst Hart and Dan Kelly were firing from the verandah at the
back. Bullets whizzed on all sides, and the fight waxed long and furious, the only
spot for safety for the besiegers being found behind some trees, from which shelter
the least movement exposed them to danger. In the early part of the fray Super-
intendent Hare was shot in the left wrist, and though desirous to stay, was
ultimately compelled, from the serious character of his wound to quit the spot and
return to Benalla. Mr. Rawlings, a volunteer is highly spoken of, and his conduct
is characterized as brave in the extreme.
After Superintendent Hare’s departure, Sub-Inspector O'Connor and Senior-
Constable Kelly continued the attack, in which they were ably assisted by the
Queensland trackers. The fighting went on all night, and at daylight police rein-
forcements arrived, under Superintendent Sadlier and Sergeant Steele.
Shortly after day-dawn the women and children were allowed to quit the
hotel, and Mrs, Jones, the landlady, with her son and daughter (both shot in the
melee} were removed. The son was sent down to Benalla Hospital, and died of
his wounds on 29th June. The girl recovered, but a lad named Reardon, who
was wounded severely, died soon after.
How Ned Kelly succeeded in leaving the hotel unobserved is unknown, but at
early morn be appeared at the rear of the police, and attacked them with a revolver.
After some brief skirmishing he was brought to the earth by a well-aimed shot
from Sergeant Steele, who had discovered that the outlaw wore armour, and fired
at a vulnerable part of his body. The result was that Ned was at once placed hors
de combat s and fell, exclaiming. * I’m done 1 I’m done I’, A rush towards him was
instantly made by Sergeant Steele and others, and notwithstanding his struggles
for freedom he was firmly secured. On examination it was found he had received
several wounds the most important being one in the region of the groin. He was
clad in a complete suit of armour of a most substantial kind, as will be understood
when it is stated that it comprised breast-plates, shoulder-plates, helmet, See.,
weighing no less than 97 lbs. The other members of the gang also wore armour
of the same sort, and as it was bullet-proof doubtless they had nothing to fear from
the accuracy of the weapons used by the police.
The sanguinary fray lasted till near three o’clock in the afternoon of Monday,
June 28th. A cannon was dispatched to the battlefield, and would have been used
to blow down the hotel in which the outlaws were if necessary, but such
extreme measures were not requisite. As the last volley from the police-party
was fired, Senior-Constable Johnston having stealthily approached, set fire to a
bundle of straw near the house, and succeeded in reaching shelter unhurt. At
this moment Mrs. Skillion, sister of the Kellys, appeared, and stated she wished to
induce her relatives to surrender, but she was not permitted to approach the burning
building, which from its combustible character was soon in flames. No sign of
life being visible within, the Rev. M. Gibney, R C., of Perth, W. A,, who had
accidentally reached the spot, rushed forward and entered the now fiercely blazing
struefure, where he found the bodies of the bushrangers, life extinct. Hart and
Dan Kelly lay on the ground side by side, and Byrne was found lifeless near the
bar-room. It is reported that the latter received a fatal wound, which caused his
death, by a random shot during the contest ; the others are supposed to have com-
mitted suicide and died together. In the kitchen at the rear, Cherry Martin, an old
man in bis 60th year of age, was discovered in a dying condition. He had been a
prisoner of the gang, and was fatally wounded. Shortly after receiving the last offices
of religion from Father Gibney, he expired. After the hotel had been burnt to
the ground, amid the ruins the charred remains of the outlaws were found, and


near them the armour they wore. Byrne’s body was the least injured, but presented
nevertheless a horrid spectacle to all beholders. On one of the fingers of the right
hand was a ring once owned by the unfortunate Constable Scanlon, whose fate we
have already recounted.
Inquests on the body of Sherritt, the Constable, the boy Jones, and Byrne
were held but it was considered that no inquest was necessary on the remains of
Dan Kelly and Hart, Byrne was buried quietly at night in the Benalla Cemetery.
After the bodies of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were given up to their relatives,
they were removed to Mrs. Skillion’s hut, which was rushed by a crowd, and a
drunken orgie or wake ensued.
The constables in Sherritt’s hut at the time he was shot were named Armstrong
Alexander, Ducross, and Dowling. Sherritt was an ex-policeman, an athlete, and
only in his 24th year. For some time he supplied information as to the movements
of the gang, of which they eventually became aware, hence their shooting him for
revenge.
Dick Hart, Wild Wright, and other of the Kelly fraternity have often since
used threats of vengeance.
On Saturday, July 31st, Mr. Call the Police Magistrate, of Melbourne visited
the Gaol and formally remanded Ned Kelly to appear at Beechworth on the Satur-
day following. He was accordingly forwarded thither by special train'on Monday,
August Ist, in custody of Sergeant Steele and three armed troopers. On the way
he was somewhat noisy, sang bushranging songs, boasted of bis exploits, and
conducted himself with great bravado. On arrival at Beechworth Gaol his wounds
were dressed by Dr. O’Brien. The operation took some time as there were twenty-
three in all. Constable Mclntyre with another policeman slept in the cell with
the prisoner that night.
THE TRIAL OF NED KELLY
Was commenced on Friday, August 6th, 1880, at the Beechworth Court-House,
which was besieged at an early hour by a crowd of persons eager to gain admittance.
The building though large was unable to hold the half, and every part was densely
packed. Mr. Gaunson, who bad come from Melbourne to take charge of the
defence, applied at the usual time of opening for a brief adjournment in order
that he might make himself thoroughly conversant with its various aspects. This
was granted, and the proceedings did not commence till 2 o’clock p. m,, when Kelly
was placed at the bar, and after some preliminary dilly-dallying on the part of
Mr. Gaunson, the following evidence was taken.
Mr. Foster said Mr. Gaunson had expressed a desire to do his duty, and had
admitted that the counsel on the other side were actuated by a similar desire. He
(Mr. Foster) hoped Mr. Gaunson would concede to him a like desire to do his duty
to the Crown and prisoner. As regarded application made for further adjournment,
he did not think that this concession would prejudice the interests of the prisoner ;
personally he was willing to grant it, but he could not see what good would be
served by delay, and in the meantime the case must go on.
Mr. C. A. Smythe on behalf of the Crown, said he would treat the case in a
general manner, and gave a short outline of the outrages alleged to have been
committed by the gang from 2oth October 1878, up to the time of the tragedy at
Glenrowan. Witnesses were then called, the first placed in the box being
Thos. Mclntyre, who deposed—l am a mounted constable of police. Remember
the morning of the 25th of October 1878. I left Mansfield that morning with
Constables Lanigan, Scanlon, and Sergeant Kennedy at 5 o’clock. We were going
to search for Edward and Daniel Kelly. The prisoner now in the dock is the man
I refer to as Edward Kelly. We camped at Stringybark Creek, twenty miles from
Mansfield. We were all on horseback, and were armed. It was thickly timbered
country. The photograph produced shows the character of the country. There
was an old hut there. We camped behind the old hut in a tent, and stopped there
that night, but nothing occurred. We were up at daylight on the morning of the
26th. After breakfast Sergeant Kennedy and Constable Scanlon left, leaving me
and Lanigan at the hut. They were each armed with a revolver, and Sergeant
Kennedy had a repeating rifle. Lanigan and myself had each a revolver and
double-barreled fowling piece. I was baking bread during a portion of the day,
while Lanigan looked after the horses, which were hobbled. We had two horses
and a pack horse. Kennedy and Scanlon left us about 6 o’clock in the morning.
Between 12 and 1 o’clock Lanigan told me he beard a noise in the creek, Mr. Smythe
—You cannot say what he told you. Witness—l heard the noise myself, and

with Lanigan went to the creek, but could see nothing. We returned to the tent,
and I fired two shots at some parrots ; I reloaded the gun with small shot. About
4 o’clock in the afternoon Lanigan and myself built a large fire. We did so in
order that Kennedy and Scanlon might see it to guide them to our tent in the
event of their being bushed. The fire was 20 yards from the tent. There were
two logs close to it. It was nearly 5 o’clock when we built the fire —about 10
minutes to 5. I went to the tent to get a billy to make tea I had to make, and Lan-
igan was standing on the opposite side of the fire. I was standing, and suddenly
I heard a voice crying out “ Bail up ; hold up your hands.” I quickly turned
round and saw four men, each armed with a gun, and pointing their weapons at
us. I noticed the man on the right of the party particularly. He was aiming his
weapon at my chest, and I held out my arms because I was unarmed. When I
did so the same man moved his gun and fired at Lanigan who started to run.
Lanigan was about 12 feet from me. The outlaw was about 40 yards from Lanigan
when he fired. Lanigan fell, having run only four or five yards when he was hit.
I heard Lanigan breathing in a heavy and stentorious manner. The man at the
right of the party to whom I refer was Ned Kelly, the prisoner, the other men
were close to us, and about two or three yards separated them. When Kelly fired
he changed the gun which he had fired with his left hand, and putting his hand
behind his back he drew his revolver. I told him I was unarmed, and he said,
“ Keep your hands up.” At this time my revolver and fowling piece were in the
tent. The prisoner and his mates ran towards me and stood a distance of three
yards from me. They covered my chest with their firearms, three of them having
guns and the prisoner a revolver. Prisoner said “ have you got any firearms 1” I
said “ I have not.” Lanigan up to this time had been struggling, but he then
ceased to struggle and breathe. Lanigan was about ten yards from me, and I
heard him say, “Oh Christ, I am shot.” That was about two seconds after the
shot was fired. He only staggered for half a minute and a few minutes afterwards
I saw that he w r as stretched out on his back and motionless. I concluded that
he was dead. Kelly asked me, “ Where is your revolver 1 ” I replied, “at the tent.”
He said to his mates, “Keep him covered, lads,” and they kept me covered whilst
the prisoner himself searched me by putting his hands over my body. He found
no firearms on me, and then jumped across the log going in the direction of Lan-
igan. Almost immediately he came back with Lanigan’s revolver. I was under
cover all the time. Prisoner said, “Oh dear, what a pity this man tried to get
away,” One of the others said, “ What a plucky fellow I ” Did you see how he caught
at his revolver! ” At the same time he indicated by moving his hand how Lanigan
had acted. That was Dan Kelly the prisoner’s brother. Prisoner went up to the
tent, the other three remaining with me. When he came back he had my revolver,
which I had left hanging in the hut. He told his mates to let me go. and they
did so, and then walked in the direction of the tent, and one of them, Dan Kelly,
came back with a pair of handcuffs. He said “We will put them on the b ”
I appealed to prisoner, saying, “ Why put these on me ? What can I do when you
are all armed ? ” He said, “ All right, don’t put them on. This said Dan” tapping
his rifle, “is better than handcuffs.” Then, speaking directly to me, he said,
“ Mind, don’t try to go away, for if I had to follow you to the police station I
would shoot you.” They then went to the tent. I knew Dan and Ned Kelly by
description. I did not know who the other two were. I saw a photograph of
prisoner previously—but not of Dan Kelly. When they went to the tent they
called me. Prisoner sat with a gun across his knees. It was the same with which
he shot Lanigan. He remarked, “ This is a curious weapon with which to travel,
the country.” I replied, “It is, but nerhaps it is better than it looks. He replied
“ You might well say that; I can shoot a kangaroo with it at 100 yards.” From
its appearance I took it to be a short-barreled rifle with wax string near to the
trigger. He said, nodding his head towards Lanigan’s body, “Who is that man
there ? ” I said, “ That is Lanigan.” He replied, “I am glad of that; the b
gave it to me in Benalla one day.” Dan laughingly remarked, “He will lock no
more poor b s up.” I have since learned that the other two men were Joseph
Byrne and Steve Hart. I indentified Byrne’s body at Glenrowan. After Kelly
had been speaking to me in the Wombat Ranges, Byrne came to me and ordered
me to drink some tea, none of them had previously done so, and after they had
seen me take the tea they also drank it, with the exception of the prisoner, who
remarked, “Is there any poison about here 1 ’ I said, “No ! why should we have
poison 1 ” Whilst Hart, Dan Kelly, and Byrne were having some tea, the prisoner
drew the charges out of my fowling-piece. He pricked the end of the cartridges
and threw away the shot which he replaced with bullets, that is one bullet for


each cartridge. Having so reloaded the gnn, he handed it to Byrne.saying, ‘‘You
take that, give me yours.” Byrne gave him his, which was an old-fashioned one
with a large bore. He held both guns in his hand, and said to Byrne, “ One of
them is for you, if you don’t obey me.” Byrne asked me if I smoked, and I said
‘ Yes.” He said, “ Well, fill your pipe and have a smoke.” I filled my pipe, and
Byrne asked me for tobacco, which I supplied to him. The prisoner also asked
me for tobacco and I gave him some. All this transpired in ten or fifteen minutes.
During this time they, the gang, kept possession of their guns At the end of this
time I heard prisoner say, “ That will do ; go to your places boys.” Prisoner
went over to the fire and took the guns with him, Byrne and Dan Kelly went
over to the speargrass ground in the open. It was about five feet high. When
they got over there I lost sight of them in the speargrass. The prisoner concealed
himself behind a large log near the fire. He had the two guns with him.
Where were yon at this time ? —Outside the tent.
Did he call you over ? —Yes he called me over to him.
After concealing himself; what occurred then ? —He pointed to a place on the
opposite side of the log:, and said, “ You stand there.”
Did you do it ?—Yes.
Then the log was between you and him ?—Yes.
Was it big ? How high was it ? —Close on three feet high.
He was completely concealed on the other side?—Yes ; and I was standing up
on the other. Had he the two guns ? Yes, and a revolver.
When there had he a conversation ?—He said at first, “ Who showed you this
place ? ” I said, “No person showed it. We were on beat about Mansfield.” He
said, “ How did you come here ? ” I said, “ We crossed Collin’s Creek and followed
the base line,” He said, “ Who are you, and what brought you here,” I said, “ You
know very well who we are.”
You were not in your uniform then ?—No, in day clothes.
“ Well,” he said, “ I suppose you came after me ? ” I said, “ No, I don’t know
that we came after you.” He said, “ Well, you came after Ned Kelly?” I said,
“ Yes, we came after Ned.” He said, “ Yes, and you b s would shoot us I
suppose ?” I said, “ No, we came to apprehend you.” He then said, “ Why did
you bring so much firearms and ammunition ? ” 1 said, “We only brought powder
to shoot kangaroos.” He asked, “ Who was that shooting down the creek to-day 7”
I said, “ I was shooting at parrots.” He said, “ This is very strange. Did not you
know that we were here ? ” And I said, “ No, we did not know you were within
ten miles. We thought you were over there,” and I .pointed in the direction of
Greta. He said, 11 When do you expect these men home ?’, I said, “ I don't think
they will be home to-night;'l think they must have got bushed.” He had
previously asked me where the others were, and I said, “ They are out.” He said
D—m them I In which direction did they go ? ” I pointed north-west, in the
direction of Benalla, and said, “ Over there.” He said, “ That is very strange
for perhaps they will never come back again, for there are good men down the
creek, and if they fall in with them you will never see them.” He said, what is
their name and station ? I said, “ Sergeant Kennedy and Constable Scanlon.”
He said, “ 1 never heard of Kennedy and Scanlon.” 1 said, “ What do you intend
doing ? Surely you don’t intend shooting them down in cold blood, because I
would rather be shot a thousand times myself than tell you anything about them.”
He said, “ I like to see a good man, but it depends on their surrendering. I will
shoot no man who holds up his hands and surrenders,” I said, “What do you
intend doing with me. Are you going to shoot me ? ” He said, “ What would I
shoot you for ? I could have shot you half-an-hour ago when you were on the log
if I had wanted to do so,” and he pointed to a log on which I sat. He said, “At
first I thought you were Flood, and it is a good job for you that you are not,
because if you had been I would not have shot you, but I would have roasted you
on that fire.” He said, “ There are men in the force if ever I lay my hands on
them I will roast them. They are Fitzpatrick, Flood, Steele, Strachan, and Strong,
who have been blowing that they would take me single-handed.” He continued,
“ How are these men armed ? ” I said, “In the usual way.” He said, “ What do
you mean “ Have they revolvers? ” I said, “ Yes, they have got revolvers.” He
said, “ Have not they got a rifle with them 7 ” I hesitated to reply. He said,
“ Now, come, tell me the truth. If you tell a lie I will put a hole in you.” I said,
“ Yes, they have got a rifle.” He said, “Is it a breech-loader? ” I said, “ Yes it
is.” He said, “I think it looks like if they had been out shooting.” I said, You
cannot blame them ; you know they have got their duty to do." He said, “ They
are not ordered to go about the country shooting people.” Prisoner said, “ What

became of the Sydney man? ” I knew prisoner referred to Sergeant Willin. I
said, “ He was shot by the police.
Did he make any remark ?—He said, “If the police shot him, they shot the
wrong man. I suppose some of you will shoot me some of these days.”
At this stage the Court adjourned till next day, and Mr. Gaunson sent the
following telegram to Mr. Berry :
“ The Chief Secretary, Melbourne —I have specially to urge that the order
issued by your predecessor respecting Kelly’s right to see his relations and friends
may be cancelled as illegal arbitrary, and unjust to a man standing on his trial
Jor his life,— Gaunson.”
The reply was unfavourable to the prisoner, and the application was not
entertained.
On the reassembling of the Court on the 7th August.
Thos. Mclntyre, examined by C. A. Smythe, deposed—Ned Kelly said to me,
“ Why I broke out was that b y Fitzpatrick ; he was the cause of all this. The
people lagged at Beechworth no more had revolvers in their hands than you have
at present. In fact, they were not there. These were the men who were there ”
( nodding towards his own mates). I said, “ You cannot blame us for what Fitz-
patrick did to you.” He almost swore he would not let another one go, and said,
“If I let you go now you will have to leave the police force.” I said, I will do
so. My health is bad. I have been thinking of going some time. If 1 make
these men surrender what will you do with us ? ” He said, “ You had better. If
they get away I will shoot you. We do not want their lives ; we only want their
horses and firearms.” During this time the prisoner wss looking down the creek. He
had the two guns resting on a log in front of him. I thought it might be
possible to get one of the guns in the event of one of the other men coming up. I
took a short step ready for a spring, when Hart who was in the tent, sang out
“ Look out Ned, or that b will be on top of you.” The prisoner coolly looked
up and said “ You had better not, mate, because if you do you will soon find
a match for you. I know there are not three men in the force a match for me.”
He asked, “ Are there any others out 1 ” I said, “ Yes, there is another party at
Greta.” He asked me who they were, and I said I did not know, but they were
under the command of Sergeant Steele. At this time it was getting late, being
between half-past 5 and 6 o'clock, I thought the men would come home shortly.
I said 1 would try and get them to surrender if he would promise not to shoot
them. He said he would promise. A moment afterwards Kennedy and Scanlon
came in sight. Kelly said, “ Hist, lads, here they are 1 You go and stand at the
log, and you can get no harm.” I went to the log he pointed out. about ten or
twelve yards off, and immediately afterwards the men came in sight. They were
riding, and walking their horses about 50 yards off. Sergeant Kennedy came in
first, about 12 yards ahead. I do not remember if Kelly said anything then. I
stepped towards Kennedy and said out aloud, so that the prisoner could hear me,
“ Sergeant I think you had better dismount and surrender.” At the same time
the prisoner cried out, “ Bail up ; hold up your hands.” Kennedy smiled, and
put his hand out for his revolver, which was in the case. Immediately he did so
prisoner fired at him, and missed him. Kennedy assumed a serious aspect, and I
turned to look back at the prisoner’s face. I saw him and the other three advanc-
ing from the hut and speargrass. They had their guns, and as they advanced they
said, “ Bail up ; hold up your hands.” When 1 looked round on the firing of the
first shot, the prisoner was behind the log, resting on his right knee. Kennedy
must have seen him, for he was head and shoulders above the log before he fired.
At the time the others were advancing Kelly (prisoner) threw down his discharged
gun and picked up the one that was loaded, which he pointed in the direction of
Scanlon. Then I looked at Kennedy, and saw him throw himself on his face on
the horse’s neck, and roll off on the off-side of his horse. At the time he fell there
were four shots fired, and Scanlon who had pulled up about thirty yards from the
prisoner, was in the act of dismounting. When he first heard the words “ Bail up ”
he fell on his knees and caught at hig rifle, and then endeavoured to get upon his
feet. He again fell upon his hands and knees, and in this position was shot under
the right arm. The prisoner covered and fired at him. Scarcely any time elapsed
between the cry to “ Bail up.” and the firing of the shots. Seeing Scanlon fall
I expected no mercy to anyone, and I caught and mounted Kennedy’s horse
which was close to me. Before I mounted the horse was restive, in consequence
of the firing, and turned its head north and moved about two lengths while I was
struggling to mount.


Mr. Smythe —Did Kennedy say anything to you when you was mounted ?
He said nothing. While I was riding away I heard two shots fired, but by whom
I could not say. I saw a blood spot on Scanlon’s right arm when the shot was
fired, and he rolled over on his back, I rode away. I rode northerly for about
twenty yards, and then turned westerly. In riding along I was torn off my horse
by the timber. I was in the bush all night. I got to Mansfield at 3 p.m. on the
following day (Sunday), and I reported what I had seen to the Inspector. Some
police and others made a search party, and I went with them. I started on my
return journey about two hours after reaching Mansfield. We got back to the scene
of the murder about lor 2 o’clock on Monday morning, That was in the middle
of the night. We found the bodies of Lanigan and Scanlon where I had last seen
them. They were both dead. We searched for Kennedy, but did not succeed in
finding him. Our tent was burnt down, and what was not burnt was taken away,
all I found left was a tin plate. Sergeant Pewtress came in charge of that party.
Dr. Reynolds afterwards examined the bodies The bodies were taken on pack-
horses, and we reached Mansfield next day. We took them to Mr. Monk’s at the
Wombat sawmills, on packhorses, and from there in a cart. I was at the magis-
terial inquiry. I saw some bullets taken from Lanigan’s body. Dr. Reynolds
pointed them out tome. I saw three bullets altogether. I was not one of the
party that found the body of Kennedy. I saw the body when it was brought into
Mansfield, and on the following Thursday there was a magisterial inquiry on the
body. Kennedy had a valuable gold watch when we started first from Mansfield.
I never saw the prisoner again until [ saw him at Glenrowan on the 22nd of June.
Since the Mansfield murders I have been attached to the detective department.
Prisoner had been arrested when I arrived at Glenrowan.
Mr. Smythe—Had you any conversation with him ?
Mr. Gaunson objected to this question. He said at the time the man was
arrested he was suffering from his wounds, and not only that, his mind was not in a
fit state to enable him to undergo a series of questions. The man was prostrate
and the police ought not to have questioned him.
Mr. Smythe argued that according to the law of evidence the question could
be put.
The objection was overruled.
Mr. Smythe—Did you see him on Tuesday ?—Yes. I was not requested by
prisoner to go in and see him. Constable Kelly was present during the whole
time I was with prisoner. Senior-Constable Kelly said, “ Ned, do you know
this man I ” '
Mr. Gaunson again protested against these questions being put at a time when
the prisoner was prostrate and wounded. These men fastened themselves on him
to get information out of him that would criminate him. It was a blackguard
proceeding to go in uninvited at such a time for such a purpose of extracting
evidence.
Mr. Smythe objected to such language.
Mr. Gaunson—l say advisedly it was a blackguard proceeding.
The objection was overruled.
Witness proceeded-The prisoner said, “ No, it’s Flood, is it not?” I said,
“ No, you took me for Flood the last time we met.” He said, “ Oh, no, it is not
Flood.” I said, “Do you remember the last time we met? He said, “ Yes I do.”
I said. “ Did I not tell you then that I would much rather be shot than tell you
anything that would lead to the death of these men ? ” He said, “ Yes.” I said,
« When I turned round 1 saw you had my chest covered.’, He said, “ Yes I had.”
I continued —“ And when 1 held up my hands you shot Lanigan.” 9e said, “ No,
Lanigan got behind some logs and pointed his revolver at me. Did you not see
that ?" 1 said, “ No, that is only nonsense.” I then said, “ Kennedy fired a good
many shots at you.” He said, “ Yes, he fired a lot. He must have fired nearly two
rounds with his revolver.” I said, “ Why did you come near us at all? When
you knew where we were you could have kept out of the way.” He said, “ You
could have soon found us out, and if we had not shot you, you would have shot us.”
He also said, “ Our horses were poor and our firearms were bad. and we wanted
to make a rise.” I asked him if I showed any cowardice, and he said, “ No.”
That is all that occurred.
Cross-examined by Mr, Gaunson—l am an Irishman, and about 35 years old,
Since the Wombat affair I have been in Melbourne in the detective department.
I remember when I arrived at the Richmond depot. It was on the first of November.
X volunteered to go to Glenrowan, I asked the Chief Commissioner to let me go


A STRANGE APPARITION.—NED KELLY’S FIGHT AND CAPTURE.
“ His head, chest, and sides were all protected with heavy plates of quar-
ter-inch iron. Many shots hit him, yet he always recovered himself, and
tapping his breast laughed derisively, as he returned their fire-. It appeared
as if he were a fiend with a charmed life.” —The Age report.




up. The Chief Commissioner asked me at Glenrowan if I could identify prisoner,
and I said, “ Yes ”
Mr. Gaunson—Was it after some men had been roasted ? It was after I saw
two bodies taken from the fire. They might have been women. I could not tell,
they were so mutilated.
Mr. Gaunson—Did the Chief ask, is Kelly much changed, or anything
further ? I don’t remember anything further. That was on Monday or Tuesday.
I went into the lock-up at Benalla. Sergeant Whelan was in charge of the lock-up.
Senior-Constable Kelly may have been in charge at the time, I suppose he was,
for he had the key. I never heard one of the constables say that Kelly had been
talking about me. I went to Constable Kelly, I said, “ I want to see the prisoner.’’
I saw him in the bedroom at the barracks. He was not in the lock-up at the time.
I do not remember Kelly asking for the key.
Mr. Gaunson—So you idly visited this man? Witness—l need not have gone
if I had not liked. When I got in I put the questions to which I have already
deposed. Kelly was wounded, and was lying down. I knew he was wounded in
the arm. To my mind he was sane. Senior-Constable Kelly did not take notes
of our conversation in the cell nor in my sight. I did not speak to Senior-Constable
Kelly afterwards about the conversation. I did not say to him, “ I hope you have
taken notes.” I slept at the police-station last night. I did not report to the Com-
missioner, but prepared a written statement of the whole case, which I gave to
Sub-Inspector Kennedy. I have not been talked to concerning my evidence. I
have not compared notes with Senior-Constable Kelly about the conveisation. I
told him what my evidence would be and asked him if it was correct, and he said
i- Yes.” I believe there was a third constable present in the cell at the Benalla
lock-up when I spoke to Kelly. I know I am the principal witness against the
prisoner. I have made statements to reporters about what occurred at the Wombat
Ranges. I made my first report either to Sub-Inspector Pewtress or Superintendent
Sadlier. It was a written report. I wrote it in the Mansfield Police-station, I
know a Senior-Constable named Maud. I read the Age principally. I cannot say
if I read Maud’s report in the Argus. I believe it was wrong.
Mr. Gaunson—Did you say in your first report that Edward Kelly was the
man who shot the police ? Witness—l cannot say what I wrote two years ago. I
should have done so. My report did not reach Benalla for some days. I had
never seen the prisoner or any of his gang before that morning. I read Ned Kelly’s
description in the Argus. I did not tell him I believed litzpatrick had perjured
himself. I saw his photo, with Sergeant; Kennedy. It had been taken in Pentridge
seven or eight years ago. He was described in the Police Gazette as having been
bom in 1856. Kelly had hair on his face at the Wombat When his photo, was
taken in gaol he was clean shaved. I could see a resemblance between the photo,
and Ned Kelly. I could not swear that it was a good photo. 1 recollect seeing
a reporter from the Argus in the Richmond Barracks.
Mr. Gaunson—Did you tell him that the likeness was a good one of Ned Kelly?
Witness—l can’t recollect what I said four years ago. The report of the interview
may be correct, The only photo, which I saw of Kelly was that shown to me by
Sergeant Kennedy. We went into the Wombat Ranges to arrest Daniel and
Edward Kelly for attempting to murder Constable Fitzpatrick. We were all
armed with the regular revolvers. Sergeant Kennedy borrowed a gun. We ex-
pected resistance. Kennedy may have had the warrant. I did not say in mv
examination-in-chief that we had no warrant, I had no warrant.
Mr. Gaunson said, in his direct examination the witness said there were
warrants issued. , . _ . . ~ ,
Witness —On Friday night after we camped in the ranges, I went to look for
kangaroos. I heard part of the evidence of Constable t itzpatrick, Iwo men named
Skillion and Williamson were tried with Mi s, Kelly. I heard that the three
prisoners weie sentenced—Williamson and Skillion to 6 years, and Mrs. Kelly
to three years. I knew Mrs. Kelly had an infant at her breast. The infant was
in gaol for one year. I believe it was on the 15th of April that the attempt to
murder Fitzpatrick was made. A reward of a £IOO was offered for Kelly’s ap-
prehension I would not have shot Kelly if we had met him if he had not resisted
with firearms. I believe Constable Fitzpatrick has been discharged. I saw the
notification in the Oantte.
Mr. Gaunson —Do you believe he was dismissed because he was an honest,
upright' and truthful man ? Witness—lf he possessed these qualities I think he
would not have been dismissed, but he might have been dismissed for some in-
discretion. I know that the question was asked by Mr. Graves in the House about


Fitzpatrick. It was upon the evidence of Constable Fitzpatrick that Mrs. Kelly,
Skillion, and Williamson were convicted.
Mr. Gaunson—Upon the evidence of a man who is not good enough for the
force? Witness —I never saw anything wrong with Fitzpatrick. The reward
was offered by the Government. We frequently searched for Edward and Dan
Kelly before the 28th October. I did not know why the particular locality should
have been searched. We were not in uniform ;we were in plain clothes. We
were not disguised like diggers.
Mr. Gaunson—l would like to know by what authority you scoured the
country in plain clothes, armed, and without warrants ? Witness—l was acting
under the instructions of Sergeant Kennedy. When we were told to “ bail up,”
nothing was said to the effect that they (the Kellys) did not want to take life, they
only wanted the arms. Kelly said Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this. I replied,
“ You cannot blame us.” I cannot remember saying “ I know that,” in answer to
Kelly, but I will not swear I did not say so. If anything was said about Sergeant
Steele having giving evidence to back up Fitzpatrick Ido not remember it. I was
quite cool after having been stuck up. When Kennedy and Scanlon were returning
Kelly said, “ Look out lads ; here they come.” I walked towards Kennedy,
Edward Kelly being about ten or twelve yards from me.
Mr. Gaunson—ls it not true that the instant Kennedy got off the horse you
seized it and left him in the lurch ? Witness—l took the horse when it had been
abandoned.
Mr. Gaunson —You have, in your direct examination, said, Kennedy smiled.
Did he smile at you when you ran away with the horse 1 Witness—l did not swear
that. Kennedy was not deed at the time when I got on the horse. I did not look
round because the timber was thick, and if I had done so I would probably have
been knocked off. I have sworn that when the prisoner fired at Kennedy he
missed him.
Mr. Gaunson —How long after that was it that you seized the horse ? Witness—
At once. I cannot say what the feeling of the police with regard to Kelly is. I
have spoken to them, and have spoken to Dwyer and Steele about him.
Mr. Gaunson —Is the general feeling against him ? Is it their wish that he
should escape ? Witness—l can't say. Many of the men have said that he should be
hanged. I can’t say what the feelings of others are. Ido not know whether
Steele wishes Kelly to be hanged.
Mr. Gaunson —I will have you in the hands of a man better able to deal with
you, and turn you inside out in the Supreme Court. Just*.one more question. How
did you distinguish between prisoner and his brother 1 Witness —from description.
Mr. Gaunson having read the depositions, asked why he had said to Ned
Kelly, “ No,” when he asked if he and the others had come out in the Wombat
Ranges for him ? Witness —When I said “No, I did not know we were coming
after you,” I considered that I was giving Kelly an evasive answer. Kelly said in
the Wombat, “ What brings you out here at all ? It is a shame to see fine strapping
fellows like you in the lazy loafing billet of policeman.” He also said, “If you
get the others to surrender we will handcuff them, but we will let you go in the
morning ; we will let you go away on foot as we want your horses and firearms.”
I was very close to Kennedy’s horse when he dismounted, He threw himself off
the horse in order to avoid the shots. Scanlon was on the ground when he was
shot. I do not think I ever said that Scanlon was shot whilst running for a
tree. I was annoyed with the reporters. They would suggest questions and
answers. In my opinion there was too much publicity about the whole of the
affair. There was not too much published to prevent the fair trial of the Kelly gang,
I think 1 have mentioned everything I recollect. The conversation between me
and the prisoner lasted for about a quarter of an hour. The party had four guns
when they came up ; and my fowling piece which they took made five guns. I
believe Hart carried a double-barreled gun, Daniel Kelly carried a single barreled
fowling-piece. It was a cheap gun with a common bore. I heard him discharge
it, but I can’t say if there was anything in it but powder. I swear positively that
I saw smoke issuing from the barrels of all the guns. I heard a dozen discharges
at least. I could not say at what object Dan Kelly was firing. I believe he was
firing at Kennedy. Hart’s gun was also a common one. I heard him firing. Do not
know if Hart’s gun was loaded with ball. Byrne’s gun was an old-fashioned one,
having a very large bore. That gun was also discharged. Kelly gave my fowling-
piece to Byrne. After Kelly missed Kennedy I saw him point in the direction
of Scanlon. 1 will not swear he fired at Scanlon. I did not resolve to escape
till I saw Scanlon shot. The moment I saw Scanlcn shot 1 beard three shot*

fired at once, and then I heard another shot. When Scanlon was shot lat once
made up my mind to escape if I could. I heard another shot fired after that, but
I don’t know by whom. I have not seen any of the guns with which the gang
were armed since.
Samuel Reynolds, examined by Mr. Chomley, deposed—l am a legally
qualified medical practitioner, residing at Mansfield. I recollect seeing the body
of Constable Lanigan on the Stringybark Creek on the 30th October. It was
lying on the ground. I also saw the body of Scanlon. Un the following day I
made a post mortem examination of Lanigan’s body in Melbourne. I found four
wounds —one through the left arm, one on the left thigh, one on the right temple, and
one in the inner side of the right eyeball. I looked upon them as bullet wounds.
The one on the thigh travelled round the thigh under the skin, and I extracted it.
The wound on the temple I might describe as a graze. I did not find the bullet
that caused the wound through the eyeball. It entered the eyeball, and must
have caused death in a few seconds. Mclntyre pointed out the body as that of
Lanigan. I also examined the bodies of Scanlon and Kennedy. The wound in
the temple might not have been caused by a bullet. The wound in the left arm
or in the thigh would not have caused death.
The evidence of Mclntyre was then read over to him, and signed as correct.
It occupied the clerk more than an hour to read the depositions, and whilst be was
engaged in doing so Mrs Skillion, Lloyd, and Hart left the Court with their friends.
Mr. Foster said to Mclntyre—l think it only right that I should inform you
that it is my opinion that you have given your evidence in an intelligent and
honest manner.
Mr. Gaunson said—l need say that it is very unusual to make such a statement
before a prisoner is dealt with. I don’t think he has given his evidence properly,
Mr. Foster said he considered it to be his duty to make the remarks, or he
would not have done so,
Mr. Smythe remarked —I think Mclntyre has given his evidence properly, and
I believe that opinion is shared by all in Court.
The further bearing of the case was postponed until 10 o’clook on Monday,
August 9, when it was resumed before Mr. Foster, P. M. The Court was crowded
as before, and the following witnesses examined :
George Stephens said—l am a groom at present out of employment. In 1878
I was employed at Mr. Younghusband’s station Faithful Creek, as groom. The
station is about four miles from Euroa, On the 9th December, about 1 o’clock in
the afternoon the prisoner and three other men, stuck up the station. I first saw
the prisoner at the kitchen, about 1 o’clock. He asked me “ where is Mr. Mc-
Cauley, the overseer ? ” A man named Fitzgerald, who was present, said, “He is
not in.” Mr. Fitzgerald was in the kitchen then. No one else was present.
Kelly went away then, and I left the kitchen and went down to the stables. John
Carson was there. I heard some talking, and looked round to the door, and saw
prisoner coming down with Fitzgerald. The latter put his head in at the door and
said to prisoner, “There are the other two men,” pointing tome and Carson.
Prisoner said, “ All right,” and addressing me, said, “ I suppose you do not know
who I am.” I said, “ Perhaps you are Kelly,” and he replied, “ You are ad d
good guesser.” I turned my head, and when I looked round again he had me
covered with a revolver. I said, “ I beg your pardon ; I thought you were joking,
and not Kelly.” He said. “ All right; I like to see you take it in such good part.
Which is the groom 1 ” I said, “ I am.” He then said, “ I want some feed for
my horses.” I said, “All right; there is plenty here.” He held up his hand
while inside the stable, and the other two men came down leading four horses. I
did not know the names of the men at that time, but I have heard their names since.
Mr. Gaunson—Have you seen them since ? Witness—l have not.
Mr. Gaunson—Then how can you state what their names are? Witness —I
was in the company of the three men all night and part of next day, when they left,
one of them saying they were going to the bank. It was prisoner who said they
were going to the bank. It was between 2 and 3 o’clock in the afternoon when
they left. When the men came up to, the stables with the horses they put them in
the stalls, I was standing with Kelly in an empty stall. I said, “ How about the
police murders ? ” He said, “We were behind a log, I told Dan to cover Lanigan ;
I would cover the other man. I then called out, ‘Throw up your hands.’
Mclntyre did so, and Lanigan made off towards a log, trying to draw his revolver,
As he ran he (Lanigan) got behind a log and rested his revolver on the top of it.
I took my rifle off Mclntyre and fired at Lanigan. The ball grazed on the temple.
He disappeared behind the log. Lanigan raised his hands up in front of the log.


and when his head appeared I fired again and shot him through the head. I then
sent two men back to our hut, fearing a surprise there. I also sent Dan over the
green rise to watch the police coming while I was talking to Mclntyre. They
appeared in the open. I had just time to fall on my knees and fire. I very nearly
burned my knees. Mclntyre then walked to Kennedy and spoke to him. Kennedy
smiled. I then called out, ‘You wretch, throw up your hands.’ Scanlon swung
his rifle round and fired at me. I then fired'at Scanlon, and he fell forward. 1
still kept him covered, thinking he was only shamming, when his horse moved and
he rolled off. During this time Kennedy had dismounted on the off-side of
his horse, and laid his revolver over the horse’s rump. He fired at Dan Kelly
as he came running up, grazing him on the top of the shoulder. Mclntyre then
jumped on Kennedy’s horse and rode away. Kennedy made for a tree, still firing.
He then made from that to another tree still firing.” Prisoner said the reason
Kennedy got so far is—‘ I took up Scanlon’s rifle, but had to throw it away again,
as I did not know how to use it. I still followed Kennedy up, when he stepped
from behind a tree. I thought I was done for then, as he fired and the ball grazed
my ribs, Kennedy then ran and I immediately fired and hit him on the shoulder.
As he was getting back behind the tree Kennedy ran again, and I followed. When
he wheeled round and rose his hands, I fired, and shot him through the chest.
When I hit him on the shoulder he must have dropped his revolver, and the blood
running down his arm formed into a clot, which I to.'k for his revolver. Knowing
he had one shot left when he wheeled round, I thought he was going to fire, but I
knew afterwards he was throwing up his hands.” That is all Kelly said during
that night. I was locked up in the store at Faithful Creek. There was a number
of other persons locked up with me. The prisoner was there, and one of the
other men. _
Cross-examined—l left Mr. Younghusband’s employ in 1879. I told Detective
Ward what I have said, and he wrote something in his book. I did not have any
conversation with any of the other men who came with Kelly. I have read the
reports in the newspapers. I read Saturday’s newspaper, I read the Age, I did
not read the whole of Mclntyre’s evidence, and did not see how much my evidence
and that of Mclntyre might clash. I spoke to Mclntyre on Friday in the barrack-
yard, Mclntyre asked me how did Ned make his statement to me the first time.
I saw Mclntyre at Glenrowan. I did not speak to him there. I was summoned
here as a witness on Thursday, and stopped in the barrack-yard.
Mr. Gaunson —Practically in the custody of the police. Witness \es, sir;
I might leave if I liked. I went straight to the barracks, and did not leave the
barracks that night. The next day I stopped in the witness-room. I saw Ward
standing in the passage. I did not have any conversation with the police about
my evidence.
Mr. Gaunson—Then what was your conversation with Mclntyre on Inday
about ? Witness —He asked me what I had to say, and I told him that Ned had
told me Lanigan when bailed up ran behind a log. That is all I told him.
Mclntyre said that is not the way it happened ; that when he wheeled round he
saw four men standing armed with guns, and Lanigan never got behind the log at
all ; that immediately Lanigan started to run Kelly moved the gun and shot him.
I told Ward of the conversation with Kelly two or three days after I saw Kelly.
I made a statement to Sergeant Dacy in Melbourne after the Glenrowan affair, and
he found me in Abbot’s saleroom in Bourke-street. He called me into Abbot a
saleyards, and took down what I had to say. Constable Boys served the subpoena
upon me. He did not say anything to me about the great anxiety of the police to
see Kelly acquitttd. He did not say that Kelly would be hanged. He said that
Kelly, in his opinion, would be hanged, and that he ought to be hanged. I have
no opinion with regard to Kelly. I do not think he will be acquitted. I think he
will be hanged. (On hearing this Kelly laughed.) If all is true that Kelly told
me, my opinion is he ought to be banged. I believe all he told me. I have not
been promised any situation under Government. I was at Glenrowan in the
beginning of June on private business. I saw Kelly at Benalla. I was employed
as a detective. , ,
Mr. Gaunson—l will drag out of you what you were doing at Glenrowan.
Witness—l was employed there as a detective. .
Mr. Gaunson—This is your disinterestedness. You have purposely deceived
me by saying that you did not expect a situation from Government. What have
you been doing since you left Younghusband’s ? Witness I entered into the
employ of the Government at the end of the month after I left Younghusband s.
I saw Mr, Nicholson in Benalla, and he got me on about the end of January, The

agreement was that I was to go out and try to come across the Kellys. I was told
by Mr. Nicholson that he would give me 6s. per day ; any expenses I was out he
said would be refunded. I drew my last pay on the Tuesday, the day after they
were taken. Ido not think I am entitled to any of the reward. I worked hard
to earn it. I expect to get into some Government business at the end of this trial,
at least I intend to try. It was on Government business that I went to Glenrowan.
It was business connected with the case. I sent in reports to Mr. Nicholson, from
time to time of my doings. It was in the middle of March I went to Glenrowan.
I remained there until about a fortnight before the arrest of the prisoner. I left to
go to another part of the district —to a farmer's place. I was in Benalla the day
on which I heard of the capture of the prisoner. I saw the prisoner that night
when he was brought to Benalla. I saw him in the trap which brought him from
the station. I was at Glenrowan for about three months.
Mr. Gaunson —In whose employ were you 1
Mr. Smythe objected to the question, as in the present state of the country to
have the names of people disclosed, from whom the police got information, was
positively dangerous.
Mr. Gaunson—l do not ask from whom the witness got information, I ask him
by whom he was employed. As to the dangerous state of the country, that is a
mere scare. To the witness—Were you in the employ of Patrick Hennessy, of
Glenrowan ?
Witness—l was not. I saw Ned Kelly in the police barracks. I went there
to find the officer to get some money. The officer was a travelling bank under the
circumstances. I did not hear anyone say, “ There is Ned Kelly.” I was not
paying attention. The only occasions upon which I saw the prisoner were when
he was arrested and at Faithful Creek. I did not see Superintendent Sadlier on
Monday night. On the next day I saw him, and he paid me off until that date.
1 don’t remember him saying anything. All that took place was my taking my
money. I did not say anything about the shooting of Sherritt,
James Gloster deposed—l am a draper, living at Seymour. I occasionally
hawk drapery goods about the country. I remember the evening of the 9th of
December, 1878. A man named Frank Beecroft, who was in my employ was
with me. We were going to camp at Faithful Creek Station that night. About
7 o’clock I unharnessed the horses. Previously I was told that the Kellys were at
the station hut. 1 did not believe it. I was told to come back by a man, but I did
not obey. I got into my waggon with the purpose of getting my pistol, when two
men came up, each holding a pistol, and told me to get down. The prisoner
was the man who spoke. I got down and saw that prisoner had a revolver in one
hand and a pair of handcuffs in the other. He said he had a good mind to put a
bullet through me, because I did not obey. He also said, “itis a very easy
matter for me to pull the trigger if you do not keep a civil tongue in your head.”
I had been vexed with them, and asked. “Who and what are you?” Prisoner
said, “ I am Ned Kelly, the son of Red Kelly, and a better man never stood in two
shoes.” I said, “If you are, there is no use in resisting you.” He said, “If you
keep a civil tongue in your head you will take no harm. You were nearer
being shot than any man here.” He asked me if I had any firearms. I said,
“ I don’t carry firearms for sale.” He said, “ I know you have a pistol. If you
don’t give it to me I will burn your waggon.” I gave him the pistol, and he
remained there until we finished He then told me to go to the kitchen, and there
I saw two more men, each of whom had a gun and a revolver. There were a
number of men locked up there, and during that night Ned Kelly remained on
guard over us. He told us to make ourselves comfortable. He talked to me most
of the night with reference to the murder of the police on the Wombat. He said,
“ I did all the shooting on the ranges. The people and the papers call me a
murderer, but I have never murdered anyone in my life.” I said, “ How about
Sergeant Kennedy ? ” He said, “ I killed him in a fair stand-up fight.” He argued
then, that that was not murder ; that a man killing his enemy did not commit
murder. He also said that the police were his natural enemies. Prisoner said,
with regard to the death of Kennedy—“ After the conflict with Scanlon, Kennedy
and I were firing at each other. Kennedy retreated from tree to tree. One of his
shots went through my whiskers, and the other through the sleeve of my coat.
Kennedy was a very good shot. I followed him, and he (Kennedy) turned to fire
again, I thought ”
Mr. Gaunson objected to this evidence, as it had nothing to do with the
murder of Lanigan.
Mr. Foster ruled that the Crown Prosecutor had a right to proceed.


Witness—Se continued, “ I fired at Kennedy, and he fell. At another period
of the night he said, “ I had a long conversation with Kennedy when he was
wounded. We wanted to leave the ground, but I did not like to leave him in a
dying state, so I shot him. I respected Kennedy and I covered him up with his
cloak.” With regard to the death of Lanigan, he said Mclntyre surrendered, but
Lanigan ran to a log from which he fired at him, and hit him in the He
also said, “Itis a pity he did not surrender ; I only wished to take his arms.” At
another time he said, “ Since I commenced business I have stolen 280 horses, and
if the police had taken me for anything of that sort I would not have cared ; but
if a man once did anything wrong the police would not leave him alone.” The
value of the revolver prisoner took from me was £3 10s. He also took some
clothing. I was twice stuck-up before this time, once by a man named Daly, and
once by a man unknown. I was shot in the shoulder and face by Daly. When
stuck up by Kelly I asked him if Daly was there. I did not say this when under
direct examination, because I forgot to do so, I have not used the exact words
that Kelly used, but as near as possible. Stephens could have heard the
conversation I had with Kelly if he had not been asleep. Prisoner threatened
violence to me by threatening to shoot me; otherwise I was treated with the
greatest kindness. I had £lO in my pocket and valuable property in the cart. He
did not offer to take any portion of my money, nor did any of the other men.
Some of the other prisoners offered him money—some of them half a sovereign,
but he would not take it, but returned it to them. I was told at the station that
the Kellys were there. I paid no heed. I thought the people were joking. I got
into the waggon. McCauley followed me up and told me that I was a very foolish
man, that another man under similar circumstances would have been shot. When
prisoner asked me if I had any firearms I made an evasive answer. I gave up the
revolver to Kelly. I put it down on a box. I suffered no inconvenience beyond
non-payment for the revolver and the few articles of clothing. I was allowed to
go on Wednesday morning.—On Monday night I killed time with Ned Kelly by
conversing about newspaper reports and other subjects. The prisoner, I presume,
wanted to keep awake. When speaking of the affray in the Wombat Ranges, the
expression used by me was, “ The shooting of the police,” not “ the murder. I
did not care about calling it murder. The prisoner took all the talking about the
shooting of the police upon himself, so as to screen the other members of the gang.
The whole of the conversation that night showed that the prisoner intended to
convey the impression thrt the police intended to shoot him. I cannot say that
Kelly impressed me with the belief that he was under that impression, or that he
was not under that impression. There was no drink taken that night. Kelly said
he was sorry he fired at Kennedy, and would not have done so if he had thought
he was going to surrender. I have not made any mistake in regard to Kennedy s
death. As to his having shot him, rather than leave him to die, I think he made some
remark about his being sorry that he did not give Kennedy a chance to live. I
know the remark was made ; but I don’t know if it was made by Kelly,
not the chief witness in the prosecution of Daly ; I could not identify him. Kelly
told us some of the long conversation with Kennedy, but I forgot it. I put down
in writing my experience on that occasion a fortnight afterwards, I gave it to
Detective Ward ; I have not seen that statement since. I arrived here on Thurs-
day night by the 11 o’clock train. I had an interview with Sub-Inspector Kennedy
with regard to this case on Friday night. I had previously applied to Detective
Ward for the statement I had given him. 1 did not get it, I can t recollect if,
in the communication with Ward, I stated Kelly told me he had shot Kennedy
after he had been wounded and was in a dying state. Prisoner told me his whole
history, and it was taken up with complaints about the police. He said if a man
once did wrong, the police would not afterwards leave him alone. I understood
him to mean that having done a sentence the police would not afterwards leave
him alone. He also complained of the conduct of Constable Fitzpatrick towards
his mother. He said she had been convicted on his testimony, and that he had
committed perjury. He said, “My mother has seen better days ; she struggled up
with a large family, and I feel keenly her been convicted upon the perjured
statements of Fitzpatrick,” That was the effect of the language. Kelly also told
me that he was not within 200 miles of the place where the attempt to murder
Fitzpatrick took place. He also said that whilst he was away Fitzpatrick swore
that he was the man who had shot him. The complaint is that I have lost four
suits of clothes and revolvers. , „ ,
By Mr. Smythe—lt is eight or nine years ago since Daly stuck me up. He is
now out of gaol. The impression upon ray mind was that Kelly shot the police out

of a revengeful feeling. He also said that if his mother did not get justice he
might possibly upset a train. I did not state to Ward that the prisoner told me
he shot Kennedy, I have no doubt he did tell me so.
Frederick Beecroft deposed—On the 9th December, 1878, I was in the em-
ployment of Mr. Gloster. On the evening of that day we were stuck up by the
Kelly gang. We were made prisoners, and were put into the storeroom. The
prisoner kept guard over us. He remained in the room, but there were others out-
side. Prisoner talked to the people in the room, and I heard him. He told us he
came upon the police. There were two of them in the camp, and he called upon
them to surrender. The names of the police were Mclntyre and Lanigan.
Mclntyre threw up his arms, and Lanigan ran towards a log. He got behind the
log and fired at him. Kelly said he then shot Lanigan in the head. He
also stated that he was a fool to get shot by trying to get away. Whilst talking
to Mclntyre two other constables came riding up. He called on them to
surrender. Scanlon made a motion to his rifle, and he fired at him. He fell
forward on his horse, and whilst watching him and Kennedy, Mclntyre rode off.
He thought that Scanlon was shamming. Kennnedy was on the ground when
Scanlon fell, he having dismounted. Kennedy fired, shifting from tree to tree.
When he got to an open space of ground he turned round and held up his hands.
The prisoner fired at him, as he thought Kennedy had turned round to fire at them.
Kennedy fell, and prisoner talked to him. He told him he could not leave him
in a dying state, and as he wanted to go he would have to shoot him. Kennedy
asked him to let him live, but he put his gun to him to shoot him. Kelly had a
Spencer rifle at the station, and shewed us howto load and reload it. Kelly talked
most of the night. I fell asleep towards the morning.
Cross-examined —I am 20 years of age, My parents reside at Longwood. I
am rtill in Mr. Gloster’s employment. Mr. Gloster told me he had written a state-
ment about the affair, but he did not show it to me. Constable McQuirk saw me at
Euroa since Kelly's arrest in reference to the evidence I should give. I wrote a
statement of the affair. I wrote the first part in Nagambie, and finished at Sey-
mour. Mr. Gloster did not see what I wrote. I told Mr. Gloster what I would
say, and he told me what he would say. I did not agree with Mr. Gloster
about anything. When Gloster told me what he had to say I did not say anything.
We might have talked over the matter a dozen times. I seat the statement to Mr.
Ward. He saw me at Seymour. Gloster has asked me to remember
the way in which Kennedy was shot. He did not ask particularly. We have
spoken of the affairs at the station when Kelly's name was mentioned.
Mr. Gaunson —And a story never loses in the telling. Did you ever compare
recollections with Gloster 1 Witness—What do you mean by compare,
Mr. Gaunson —I want to compare the evidence with that of your master on
one point. Is this giving the prisoner a fair trial 1 You might as well take him
out in the back yard and shoot him there without a trial at once.
Witness—l did not check my statement with Mr. Gloster; I do not recollect
if he asked me if it was correct. Kelly had told me he had shot Kennedy after
he was wounded. I don’t recollect if any one ever told me anything about the
conduct of Mclntyre, I do not remember it being said that Mclntyre had a
revolver in his belt when he was stuck up. When I made a statement to Sub-
Inspector Kennedy of the evidence I would give Mr. Gloster was present.
The Court at this stage adjourned until the next day at 10 o’clock. On resuming,
Robert Scott deposed—l was manager of the National Bank at Euroa. On
December 10th, 1878, I saw the prisoner. About, four minutes to 4 o’clock that day
he was followed into the bank by Hart. The prisoner had a revolver in each hand,
and asked me to bail up, 1 said, “ There is no hurry, I suppose ?” He pointed
his revolver at me, and I put up my bands He robbed the bank, and ordered me,
with my servant, into a spring cart. We drove to Euroa; and spoke of the murder
in the Wombat Ranges I asked him who shot Lanigan. He said, “ I shot him.”
Robert McDougall, bookbinder, said—l was in Euroa on the 10th of December,
1878. On that day I was returning from a shooting excursion in the Strathbogie
Ranges. Messrs. Dudley, Casey, and Tennant were with me. We were going
through Younghusband’s Station to Mr. Casey’s when prisoner came up on horse-
back and, covering me with a revolver said, *• Turn round, the station is stuck up.”
I stopped, and Dudley asked by what authority he stuck us up. I got out of the
cart, and Casey, the owner, was about to get into it again, when Kelly said, “ You
are Ned Kelly ; you have stolen that spring cart.” Dudley said, “We have not ;
we are all honest men.” Prisoner produced a pair of handcuffs and said to Dudley,
" I will put them on you." Dudley replied, “ I will report you to your superior


officer.” We all thought he was a policeman. Just then Mr. Tennant came up and
asked, “ What is the matter ?” Tennant had been riding on horseback. Dudley-
said, “ The station is stuck up.” Tennant said, “ Let us get in the cart and load
the guns.” Kelly told him not to do so. We were told to go to the station, we
saw Byrne bring other men there from the railway. Stephens, one of the station
hands, introduced Ned Kelly to us. He said, “ This is Mr. Ned Kelly.” We were
put into the storeroom with other prisoners. Some time after 2 o’clock Mr. Dudley
and I were standing apart from the prisoners. Kelly said to Dudley, “Is it not
bad enough to be called a proscribed outlaw than to be taking cheek from the likes
of you 7" Dudley had been giving him cheek when we were first taken. He was
outrageous ; I could see it. Prisoner took out a gold watch and said to Dudley,
“ This is a nice watch.” Dudley said, “Yes.” Prisoner said, “This was poor
Kennedy’s watch. Was it not better for me that I shot the police than have them
carry my body into Mansfield as a mangled corpse ?” He had a rifle ; but Ido not
recollect his stating where he got it. I would not swear it was a policeman’s rifle.
When we were stuck up I had a double-barreled fowling piece, a rifle, with about
eighty or ninety bullets. We were kangarooing in -the Stratbbogie Ranges, and
not Kelly-hunting. When Tennant proposed to load the guns, he said to Kelly,
“ Will we help you.” We thought that Kelly was a policeman. When he told us
that the station was stuck up, we did not know who it was by. I can’t swear that
the gold watch produced by Mr. Gaunson was the watch Kelly had. It might be
the watch for all I know. Tennant has a hasty temper, and was going to have a
fight with prisoner, but he thought better of it. Kelly treated us very well for all
that. The rifle, gun, and ammunition were also taken. I last saw the gun in the
hands of Byrne.
Henry Dudley deposed—l am a ledgermaker, employed at the Government
Printing Office. I was in the last witness’s company on the 10th of December ;
1878, in a spring-cart at Younghusband’s Station. Tennant was on horseback, and
had gone to open the railway gates. Kelly rode up and presented a revolver at us,
saying, “ The station is stuck up.” I felt irritated, because he said, “ Where did
you ‘ shake ’ that horse and trap ?” I thought he was a policeman, and said, “ How
dare you charge honest gentlemen with stealing my horse and cart. I will report
you to your superior officer.” He said, “ Hold your tongue, or I will blow your
brains out.” He then ordered us to the station, where we were locked up in the
storeroom. Kelly, on one occasion, came in. produced a gold watch, and said to
me, “ That is a fine watch ; it belonged to Kennedy. Was it not better for me to
shoot the police than to let them carry my body a mangled corpse into Mansfield 7”
He did not name any of the police. Directly I got back to Melbourne I gave a
version of the affair to a reporter. Was subpoenaed as a witness by Sub-Inspector
Kennedy, who took my statement in pencil.
Dudley Edward Richard Gyving deposed—l was teller in the Bank of New
South Wales in February, 1879. Remember the lOthof that month. Soon after 12
o’clock prisoner came into the bank. There were three other men with him armed
with revolvers. He said, “ I want money,” and he robbed the bank. We were
taken into the hotel adjourning. I heard him speaking there of the murder of the
police in the Wombat Ranges. He showed a revolver which he said had been taken
from the police. Other people were asking him questions with reference to the
shooting of the police. He said, “ The gun I shot the police with was old, but it
was a good one. The stock was bound up with wire, but I could shoot round
a corner with it.” I said something about the bank’s books, and the prisoner told
me to follow him. He asked Richards, the constable, who was with us, “ Where
is the newspaper man, Gill ?” We went to Gill’s place, but he was away some-
where. Kelly told Mrs. Gill that he wanted her husband to print something for
him, and produced a roll of manuscript. Gill not being there I told him that I
would take charge of it. After some hesitation he gave it to me saying, “ Get it
printed. I had not time to finish it, but will finish it another time, a bit of my
life.” I put the manuscript in my pocket, and said, “ All right, I will see to it.”
Only part of it was published. The part I refer to refers to the murder of the
police in the Wombat Ranges. I handed the document to Sub-Inspector Kennedy
a few days ago. Recognise ihe prisoner as the leader of the gang at Jerilderie.
I was in the company of that gang for several hours. Byrne was a tall man, about
5 feet 10| inches high, with fair hair and moustache. Hart looked like a boundary-
rider, and appeared about 20 years of age. Dan Kelly was a short man. Never
made a written statement to the bank authorities or the press. Made a statement
to several reporters, which was taken down, Sub-Inspector Kennedy saw me in
Melbourne, and he took down a few particulars from me, and referred to some*

thing which he had taken out of the newspapers, and asked me if it was correct.
I told him it was. Asked Byrne if the prisoner was Ned Kelly. I forgot his reply,
but I took him to mean that he was Ned Kelly. When I went into the bar with
the police Ban Kelly was in the bar. I have spoken to the police about the Glen-
rowan affair.
John Kelly said—l am a senior constable of police at Benalla. I was at the
Glenrowan station on the 25th of June. About 7 o’clock on the morning of that
day prisoner came out of the bush. He appeared a tremendous size, and wore an
oilskin coat and something like a helmet. Some one called on him to go back,
but he still walked on. Several police challenged him, but he took no notice.
The police fired, and the prisoner fired. One of my shots hit him on the hand, I
think. Prisoner then got behind a log. Steele ran from the hotel side at him,
When about ten yards away he fell. I ran up to him with others, and took some
of the armour off Several revolvers were pointed at him. I said to the others,
“No one will touch this man.” Bracken said something to the same effect. When
he saw Bracken he said to him, “ Save me Bracken, I once saved you.” I said
“You did not show poor Scanlon and Kennedy much mercy.” He said, “I
had to shoot them or they would have shot me.” I said to him, “ What have you
done with Kennedy’s watch ?” He said, “ Can’t tell you.” The armour was
made out of the mouldboards of a plough. When he was fighting the police, he
struck his helmet with bis revolver, and it rang like a bell. We took him to
Benalla. I was in charge of the lock-up from 2 o’clock in the morning until 7
o’clock at night. Mclntyre said to me, “ I would like to see Kelly.” I replied
“ All right,” and went to the cell in the lock-up, and told Constable Ryan, who was
there, to go to the stable. I said to Kelly, “ Do you know this man, Ned ?” He replied,
“No ; Is it Flood ?” Mclntyre said, “ The last time I saw you, you took me to be
the same man.” Prisoner said, “ I know you now ; you are Mclntyre.” Mclntyre
said, “ I have suffered a great deal over this. Is my statement correct ?” Prisoner
said, “Yes.” Mclntyre continued, “ Did I not tell you that I would sooner be
shot than betray my mates?” Prisoner said, “ You did.” Mclntyre said, *• Why
did you come near us at all ?” He replied, “ You would soon have* found us, and
you would have shot us if you did. Oar horses were poor, we had no money, and
we wanted to make a rise.” Mclntyre also remarked, “ You had me covered, and
then you shot Lanigan as he was running to a log.” Kelly said, “ Lanigan got
behind a log and was pointing his revolver at me when I fired.” Mclntyre
said, “ That is all nonsense. He was not behind a log.” About 2 o'clock that
same morning I gave Ned Kelly a drink, I was supposed to visit him. I said,
“ How about Fitzpatrick ?—is his statement correct ?” He replied, “ Yes ;it was
I who shot him ”
Cross-examined—l have been nineteen years in the force. When I went into
the cell in the first instance it was for the purpose of giving Kelly a drink
Ryan was close to me when I gave Kelly the drink. Kelly was lying upon a bed*
-and his wounds had been dressed. It is usual for mounted police to carry their
revolvers, even if in plain clothes. I have read the accounts of the Wombat affair.
If I had been in the same business as Mclntyre I would have slept in my clothes
with a revolver by my side. I cannot give an opinion as to whether Mclntyre was
to blame in failing to carry his revolver. Lanigan had his,revolver on him when
shot. I arrived at Glenrowan about 3 o'clock in the morning, Sergeant Hare
being in charge of the party. We the railway line had been torn up. The
special train in which we were in stopped in Benalla. I heard Bracken say, “ The
Kellys are up at Jones’s Hotel. Have the house surrounded. They are all
inside.” I have read Mr. Hare’s statement. I did not hear Bracken mention,
anything to Mr. Hare about the prisoner in the hotel. The first thing I saw was a
volley fired at us from Jones’s verandah. It was moonlight. The station was only
about 70 yards from Jones’s. After Mr. Hare was wounded he went to where
Mr. O’Connor was lying in a ditch. The fire was kept up for five minutes con-
tinuously. Screams were heard, and Mr. Hare called out, “ Cease firing,’’ and
then he said to me, “ For God’s sake, Kelly, surround the house, and prevent them
escaping.” The blacks were more active in their firing than the white men. They
were told to stop several times. The reinforcements did not arrive till 5 o’clock,
when Sergeant Steele’s party came from Wangaratta. Shortly afterwards a train
came from Benalla and Wangaratta. By 6 o’clock in the morning the hotel was
surrounded, and, unless the police failed in their duty, they were bound to see
anyone coming out of the hotel. I fired into the house at the back when I saw
the shooting coming from there. I had a Martini-Henry rifle. Up to the taking
of Ned Kelly I fired into the house about ten shots. The prisoners inside were


told to lie down. When Ned Kelly was captured I did not pull out a large
quantity of his beard. I saw Constable D wyer kick the prisoner, but heard Con-
stable Bracken say, taking up his gun, that he would shoot any one who touched
the prisoner. I remained at Glenrowan till the house was set on fire. I saw the
body of Byrne and the charred remains of what were supposed to be Dan Kelly
and Stephen Hart. Senior-Constable Johnson set the building on fire. I believe
that was done by order of Superintendent Sadher. I could not say if Edward
Kelly was under the influence of drink. Father Gibney was the first man to enter
the burning building. I did not see him bring anybody out.
This closed the case for the Crown, and ihe prisoner was committed to take
his trial at the Beechworth Assizes, which were held on October llth.
Ned Kelly was then charged with having wilfully murdered Michael Scanlon
on the Wombat Ranges on the 28t.h of October, 1878. Constable Mclntyre was
called and examined. He repeated the evidence narrated by him on the previous
day, after which the prisoner was fully committed on this charge.
On Thursday, 10th, of August, Kelly was forwarded by special train to
Melbourne, under armed escort, and safely lodged in the gaol of the metropolis,
which he never left alive
The trial of Edward Kelly for the murder of Constable Lanigan took place at
the Central Criminal Court, Melbourne, before Mr. Justice Barry, on the 28th and 29th
of October, 1880. The prisoner was defended by Mr. Bindon, instructed by Mr.
Gaunson, and Messrs. C. JA. Smyth and Chomley prosecuted on behalf of the
Crown, Throughout both days the Court was densely crowded, and the trial watched
with great interest. Kate Kelly and Mrs. Skillion were present, and an unusually
large contingent of constables was stationed in the Court to guard all means of
exit. The evidence was similar to that given by witnesses examined at the pre-
liminary investigation at the Beechworth Police Court. No evidence was called
for the defence, the prisoner’s counsel merely addressing the jury, and contending
that the statements of Constable Mclntyre were unsupported and could not be
accepted as reliable. The Judge, in summing up, pointed out that the demeanour
and conduct of Constable Mclntyre in the witness-box was not of a man who
wished to deceive. After brief deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of guilty,
and the prisoner was asked if he had anything to say After a few desultory
remarks, Kelly said he had not expected such a verdict, and that if he had ex-
amined the witnesses himself the complexion of the case would have been altered.
He did not fear death, but regretted that he was placed in that position on account
of his mother then in prison.
In closing what had almost amounted to an argument between the prisoner
and the Judge, His Honor passed sentence of death, and concluded with the usual
formula, (i May the Lord have mercy on your soul ? ’ Yes I will meet you there,”
was the reply from this hardened off mder, as they removed him to bis cell.
Kelly denied the statement made by Constable Fitzpatrick in October, 1878,
and stated that he was not within 200 miles of Greta, but earning a living by
digging, at the time the supposed outrage on that constable took place. He did not
justify his conduct, though his confession was an ingenious attempt to fix the blame
on others. He said : “I do not pretend that I have led a blameless life, or that one
fault justifies another, but the public judging a case like mine should remember
that the darkest life may have a blight side, and afier the worst has been said
against a man he may, if he is heard, tell a story in his own rough way, that will
lead them to soften the harshness of their thoughts against him. and find as many
excuses for him as he would plead for himself. For my own part I do not care
one straw about my life, nor for the result of the trial, and 1 know very well from
the stories I have been told of how I am spoken of, that the public at large execrate
my name. The newspapers cannot speak of me with that patient tolerance
generally extended to men awaiting trial, and who are assumed, according to the
boast of British justice, to be innocent until they are proved to be guilty ; but I
don’t mind, for I am the last that curries public favour or dreads the public frown.
Let the hand of the law strike me down if it will, but I ask that my story may be heard
and considered, not that I wish to avert any decree the law may deem necessary
to vindicate justice, or win a word of pity from anyone. If my lips teach the
public that men are made mad by bad treatment, and if the police are taught
that they may exasperate to madness men they persecute and illtreat, my life will
not be entirely thrown away. People who live in large towns have no idea of the
tyrannical conduct of the police in country places far removed from Court. They
have no idea of the harsh, overbearing manner in which they execute their duty,
how they neglect their duty and abuse their powers,”

It is the unanimous opinion of the police authorities that the Kellys were
never as was supposed, in the Strath bogie Ranges. Their principal haunts were
between Glenrowan, Greta, and Sebastopol, and they never travelled on horseback
except when on some exploit. Their general custom was to carry a small tent
with provisions in fine weather, and camp in the middle of some large scrubby
paddock. They would shift their tents for a short distance every night, but would
not make a great change unless they had reason to suppose they had been seen.
JOE BYRNE (from a photo, taken after death).
When their provisions became exhausted they would have resort
When their provisions became exhausted they would have resort to their friends,
and in wet and stormy weather generally sought friendly shelter. It is known for
certainty that Byrne often slept on the premises of a man who lives within two
miles of Beechworth. This man. on hearing of the destruction of the gang and
the death of Byrne absolutely shed tears, A singular story is told by one of the
constables who was present in Sherritt’s hut on the night of the murder. He states
that a conversation was being carried on between Sherritt, Mrs. Sherritt, Mrs.
Barry, and himself, and that the subject of their remarks was Joe Byrne. Sherritt
then proceeded to tell a yarn about Byrne and himself having once been arrested


on a serious charge. He said they assaulted a Chinaman and nearly killed him.
The Celestial, indeed, was so near death’s door that he had to be fed with a silver
tube. He himself was arrested some time after, but Byrne succeeded in evading
the police. Whilst he was lying in the Beech worth lockup one night he heard
some one knocking outside, and on asking who it was heard Joe Byrne reply, It
is me ; lam going to help you escape.” Sherritt said he replied, “ The Chinaman
is getting better, so you had better give yourself up, and do not be a fool.” Byrne
took his advice, surrendered, secured legal assistance, and was acquitted. Just
when Sherritt finished his story a knock came to the door, and, as it is now well-
known, it proved to be the intimation of the final visit Sherritt was to receive from
Joe Byrne.
The maker of the armour which the Kelly gang wore was not discovered, but,
according to some reports, it is believed it was manufactured by the gang them-
selves, whilst experts deny the truth of this statement, and assert it is the
handiwork of an experienced blacksmith. This much is known, the manufacture
of the four suits occupied four or five months, and a good deal of time was wasted
in experimenting with different material. Circular saws were first tried and found
wanting in resistance to bullets ; iron tanks were also tried and found to be not
bullet proof ; and the moulds of ploughs were ultimately adopted. It has likewise
transpired that the first suit made was defective, and was thrown aside. The
armour was used for the first time at Glenrowan, and was carried to that place
on pack-horses.
On the night of the burning of Jones’s hotel, at Glenrowan, a large number
of Kelly sympathizers, well armed, were in the vicinity, and it was only from fear of
shooting a man named Ward, who was in the hotel, that they refrained from firing.
Remarkable to state His Honor Mr. Justice Barry died at his residence, East
Melbourne, on November 28, 1881, after a brief illness, and in less than one month
from the date on which he had passed sentence on Kelly. Superstitious persons
might attach significant meaning to the final words of the prisoner on that occasion ;
but we do not believe for an instant that the culprit was so far gifted with super-
natural powers as to be able to predict the death of the worthy Judge. His vaunt
“ I will meet you there,” was evidently prompted by a heart which had lost all
hope in this world.
After the sentence of death had been passed the most strenuous efforts were
made on Kelly’s behalf by sympathizers to obtain a reprieve, and the brothers
Gaunson obtained an unenviable notoriety for the prominent part they took at
several meetings for that object. His Excellency the Governor and Chief Secretary
were petitioned, but all in vain, the Executive was unmoved, and Kelly finding
there was no hope surrendered himself to his fate. Some days before his execution he
busied himself in dictating to a fellow prisoner various particulars respecting his
career, and which were only remarkable as indicating the utter depravity of the
man’s mind, who though he had with his own hand shot three constables and been
instrumental in causing the death of many innocent persons, could still assert he
in no way charged his conscience with the guilt of any crime for which he should
suffer death.
THE EXECUTION.
The final act in the career of Edward Kelly closed on the morning of November
11, 1880, when he paid the last dread penalty of the law. At the time appointed
for the execution an immense crowd assembled in the road fronting the gaol
stared vacantly at the walls, conversed on the fate of the prisoner, but made no
demonstration. The comdemned man, who had slumbered soundly for a few hours,
and had been prepared by his spiritual advisers, Deans Donnelly and O’Hea, for the
dread event comported himself with firmness, when at 10 o’clock a.m. the Sheriff,
Colonel Rede, having demanded the body of Edward Kelly, he was led by Mr.
Castieau, the Governor of the gaol, from his cell. The condemned cell in which
he was confined is on the eastern side of the central tower, from which the corridors
radiate, and the drop fronts the main entrance The spectators, including officials,
were about fifty in number. Before being led to the scaffold Kelly remarked to
Upjohn, the executioner, “ You needn’t pinion me, I will go quietly.” But the
usual course of fastening the prisoner’s arms was nevertheless observed. Shortly
after ten he stood on the drop, and though apparently firm, seemed visibly im-
pressed with the awful nature of his position, displaying neither levity nor bravado.
He had intended to make a speech, but evidently changed his mind and said
nothing. His spiritual advisers remained near him to the last, repeating the
prayers for the dying, and while they were so doing the criminal looked his last
on the world, the cap was drawn over his face and he was launched into eternity.


The spinal column was dislocated and death must have been instantaneous, though
muscular action continued for many seconds after the bolt was drawn. An
inquest was subsequently held, and a formal verdict according with the facts
returned.
With the death of Ned Kelly, Australia has seen the last of this desperate
gang of bushrangers ; and in the future we believe it will be impossible for any
body of robbers, however daring, to set the law for months at defiance, as did those
whose exploits we have related. Their history contains a moral, which the rising
generation of the colonies will do well to observe.
APPENDIX.
The report of the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, and bearing
on this matter, may be briefly summarized as follows :
“ Sixty-six meetings were held, and sixty-two witnesses examined, and the
Commissioners visited several centres of population in the disturbed districts,
including Benalla, Greta, Glenrowan, Beechworth, Sebastopol, and Wangaratta.
They recommended that a thorough system of police patrol should be established
throughout the colony ; that immediate steps should be taken to arm the police
with the regulation pattern Martini-Henry carbine ; and that black trackers should
be permanently employed as an auxiliary to the police service.
“ They considered that prior to the Kelly outbreak the administration of the
police in the North-Eastern District was not satisfactory, and that a grave error was
committed in abolishing the police-station at Glenmore, and reducing the number
of men stationed at Stanley and other places.
“ That the conduct of Captain Standish, Chief Commissioner of Police, was
not characterized by good judgment or zeal for the interests of the public service
which should have distinguished such an officer, and that much bad feeling existing
amongst the officers was due to his want of impartiality, temper, tact, and judgment
in dealing with his subordinates.
“ That Mr. Nicholson, Assistant Commissioner, had shown himself a capable
and zealous officer, but that he laboured under great difficulties through undue
interference on the part of Captain Standish, and the jealousy occasioned by that
officer’s favouritism towards Superintendent Hare. In consequence of this, the
Commissioners recommend that in consequence of his impaired constitution, caused
by hardships on the late Kelly pursuit, he be allowed to retire on his superan-
nuation allowance as if he had attained the age of 55 years.
“ That whilst Superintendent Hare’s services in the police force have been
praiseworthy, nothing special has been shown in his actions to warrant his retention
in the force, and he is recommended to be allowed to retire on his superannuation
allowance ; and, owing to the wound he received at Glenrowan, to receive an
additional allowance of £lOO per annum.
“ That Superintendent Sadlier having been guilty of several errors of judgment
whilst assisting in the pursuit of the Kelly gang, and his treatment of Senior-
Constables Kelly and Johnson being harsb and unmerited, he is recommended to
be placed at the bottom of the list of Superintendents,
“ That Inspector Brock Smith lost a favourable opportunity of capturing the
outlaws at an early period of their career, viz., 4th November, 1878, and is
therefore called upon to retire on a pension of £lOO per annum.
“That Detective Ward, though having rendered active and efficient service
during the pursuit of the gang, was guilty of misleading his superior officers on
several occasions, the Commission therefore recommend that he be censured and
reduced one grade.
“ That the conduct of Sergeant Steele was deserving of censure in neglecting
to take action on his arrival at Wangaratta on November 4th, 1878, on the reliable
information be had received. His want of judgment and promptitude prevented
the capture of the gang and the loss of life. The Commissioners therefore recom-
mend that he be reduced to the ranks.
“ That Constables Ducross, Dowling, and Alexander, who were in the hut at
the time Sherritt was murdered, having been guilty of disobedience of orders and
cowardice, be dismissed from the service.
“ That Senior-Constables Kelly and Johnson be recommended for promotion
by the Government.
“ That Constable Bracken, for his action when imprisoned by the Kelly gang
in Jones’s hotel at Glenrowan, be recommended for promotion.
“ That Mr. James Wallace, State school teacher, of Hurdle Creek, having been
a sympathizer with the outlaws, be immediately dismissed from the Education
Department.


“ That Mr. T. Curnow, State school teacher, by warning the special train and
preventing a terrible disaster and loss of life, deserves the highest praise, and his
services special recognition by the Government.
“ That Mr. C. H. Rawlings rendered important services during the attack upon
the outlaws, which deserve consideration at the hands of the Government.
THE KELLY FAMILY.
The history and antecedents of this notorious family, being derived by the
Commission from the most reliable sources, will be perused with interest :
“ Amongst the many predisposing causes which operated to bring about the
Kelly outbreak must be included the unchecked aggregation of a large class of
criminals in the North-Eastern District of Victoria, all of whom, either by the ties
of consanguinity or sympathy, were identified with the outlaws. The origin and
NED KELLY (from a photo, taken soon after his first arrest).
settlement in the colony of the Kelly family therefore deserves some passing notice
at the hands of your Commissioners. James Quin, grandfather of Edward and
Dan Kelly, the outlaws, was a native of the County of Antrim, Ireland. With his
wife and family, consisting of six children, he arrived in Victoria in 1839. He, in
the first instance, resided in Pascoe Vale, and earned a subsistence by the cartage
and sale of firewood in Melbourne. In 1845 he settled in Wallan Wallan, in the
Kilmore District, where he rented a small farm, and was enabled in the course of
a few years to purchase the freehold of 700 acres of land in that locality. In 1863,
by which time his family had increased to ten children, four sons and six daughters,
he realized the landed property which he possessed, and with the proceeds,
amounting to about £2,000, took up the Glenmore run, situate in a remote part of
the North-Eastern District. The precise object of this migration has not been
ascertained ; but it is believed that Quin, having become notorious as a cattle
stealer in the Kilmore District, was desirous of escaping from the police surveil-
lance ; and, by removing back to the borders of settlement and civilization, to
secure for himself and his associates a safer and more extended field of operations.
The sons of old Quin were named respectfully —Patrick, John, James, and William ;
the daughters were—Mary Anne ; Catherine married to John Lloyd ; Ellen,
married to John Kelly, the father of the outlaws ; Jane, married to Tom Lloyd ;
Margaret, married to Pat Quin; and Grace. Numerous progeny was the result of


the marriages contracted by the children of the elder Quin, which accounts for the
Kelly family being described as the most prolific in the district. James, the third
son of old Quin, became an object of interest to the police so far back as 1856 ;
and from that date down to 1879, when he was incarcerated under the Felons
Apprehension Act as a Kelly sympathizer, there were recorded against him no less
than 16 arrests, and ten convictions for various offences, many of them of a serious
nature, involving terms of imprisonment amounting to about nine years. John
Quin, though frequently before the courts, has escaped conviction but when residing
at Wallan Wall an he was regarded by the authorities as the organizer of many of
the depredations in which the members of his family were concerned. John
Kelly, who married Ellen, the third daughter of the elder Quin, and who was the
father of the outlaws, was a convict, having been transported from Tipperary,
Ireland, to Tasmania, in 1841, for an agarian outrage, stated to have been shooting
at a landlord with intent to murder. He worked as a bush carpenter for a time
after arriving in Wallan Wallan, and subsequently turned his attention to gold
digging, at which he was successful, and was enabled to purchase a small freehold
at Beveridge. Here he became notorious as an expert cattle stealer, and his house
was known as the rendezvous of theives and suspected persons. In 1865 he was
convicted of cattle stealing, and sentenced to six month’s imprisonment in Kilmore
gaol. He died shortly after his release. At his death he left seven children,
namely—Edward and Dan (the outlaws), James, Mrs. Gunn, Mrs. Skillion, Kate,
and Grace. Mrs, Kelly, upon the death of her husband, settled at Eleven-mile
Creek, near Greta, where, with the younger portion of her family, she at present
resides. Her place was regarded for years as the resort of lawless and desperate
characters, including Power, who is said to have given Ned Kelly his first lesson
in bushranging. Edward Kelly the leader of the outlaws, was born in 1854, at
Wallan Wallan, and from an early age was regarded by the police as an
incorrigible thief. In company with Power, the bushranger, he, on the 16th of
March, 1870, robbed Mr. Mcßean ; and on the 25th of April stuck up Mr. John
Murray, of Lauriston. Kelly was arrested for the latter offence on the 4th of May
following, but escaped conviction owing to the want of identification. He was
implicated in several outrages ; and at Beech worth, in 1871, he received a sentence
of three years for receiving a stolen horse. He led a wild and reckless life, and
was always associated with the dangerons characters who infested the neigh-
bourhood of Greta until the shooting of Constable Fitzpatrick, on the 25th of
April, 1878, when he took to the bush. Daniel Kelly was born in 1861, and from
the age of 16 years was, with his elder brother Ned, a noted criminal. Joseph Byrne,
the third outlaw, was born in 1857, and lived with his parents who were of Irish
extraction and respectable antecedents, at the Woolshed, about seven miles from
Beech worth. When but 16 years of age he was in trouble and from the first
appears to have developed vicious and cruel propensities. In 1876, along with
Aaron Sherritt, who figures so prominently throughout the Kelly campaign, so to
speak, and with whom he was on terms of the closest intimacy, he was arrested
and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for having stolen meat in his possession ;
and he was also believed to have been connected with numerous cases of horse-
stealing in the North-Eastern district, which ultimately led to his joining the
Kelly gang. Steve Hart, the fourth member of the gang, was born in 1860, and
was the second son of Richard Hart, of Three-mile Creek, near Wangaratta.
Stephen, at an early age, became the associate of disreputable persons, and carried
on a system of stealing horses and planting them until such time as rewards were
offered by the owners for their recovery. He received a sentence of imprisonment
in July, 1877, and subsequently was sent to gaol for ten months for horsestealing.
On his release he returned to Wangaratta, and fora time appeared disposed to lead
a more honest and reputable life. One day, however, while at work cutting timber
he suddenly threw down his axe exclaiming to his mate, “A short life and a
merry one.” He then rode off, stating that he was going to New South Wales.
Nothing further was heard of him until the murders of the police at the Wombat,
when it was reported that a man answering his description was seen near Greta ;
but it was not until the Euroa bank robbery that his indentity was established as
one of the accomplices of the murderers, Ned and Dan Kelly.”
Capture of Fisher and Smith.
Not warned by Power’s unhappy fate, these ruffians, who, like Power, were
fond of good horseflesh, entered into business on the Yarra track, in September,
1871, and for a few days prospered exceedingly, in that the house of Mr. Symons,
Audit Commissioner, Yaucluse, was broken into, and several articles of plate and two


double-barrelled guns carried off by the thieves. The detective police arrested four
men for the robbery, but only two of them were tried, and though the evidence
against them was very strong, they were acquitted by the jury. Fredk. Smith and
John Fisher two of them known to be connected with the robbery, stayed in town
for some days, closely watched by the detectives, who thought by keeping them in
sight it would be discovered where the property was hidden. They, however, foiled
the police, and in a day or two afterwards it was reported that the stables of Mr.
Walker, Royal Hotel, Caulfield, had been broken into, and two valuable racehorses,
with saddles and bridles, stolen. In a very few hours afterwards it was flashed to
Melbourne that two armed men, superbly mounted and armed with double-barrelled
guns were sticking people up right and left on the Wood’s Point Road ; and, from
the description given, there could be but little doubt that the highwaymen were
Fisher and Smith, the horses Mr. Walker’s, and the guns Mr, Symons’s. Constable
Mays, stationed at Marysville, learned on the Ist December, that a farmhouse near
Lillydale had been placed under contribution of two armed men, who then made
their escape. They next attempted to rob a man named Frankham, who, however,
eluded them by escaping into the bush. Nothing more was heard of them until
night, when they camped about a mile from Fisher’s Creek. Next morning they
robbed the house of a man named Kenney, and took away a rifle and 10s. Their
coolness were admirable, for they galloped through Marysville and camped a mile
outside the township. By some mischance for the men, the horses broke away,
and galloped at full speed into Marysville, where the sight of two magnificent
thoroughbreds bathed in sweat attracted considerable attention, and amongst
others, Constable Mays, who placed them in livery and went in search of the losers,
who he had no doubt were the bushrangers. Mays and two residents of the town
went into the bush, which they searched all night, but without any success, until
Mays, who was by himself, came upon them between nine and ten o’clock in the
morning, camped about 25 miles from Wood’s Point, Mays, who was in plain
clothes, rode towards Fisher, who was alone. He was immediately seen by Fisher,
who said, “ Hallo, what do you want here ?” Mays said, “I am a constable.”
Fisher swore that he would blow his brains out. Mays said, “Do you mean
shooting?” Fisher replied, “Yes Ido; don’t move a peg.” Mays replied, “I
can do a little at the same time.” Fisher picked up a gun and ran behind a tree.
Frank Smith alias Roland Leigh, here came up carrying a bundle of firewood,
and Mays placed his foot on a double-barrelled gun, at 4 the same time presenting a
revolver at Smith, and telling him he would shoot him if he moved. Fisher cried
out, “ Are you going to let a log of wood like that collar you ; mo\ e away and I’ll
do for him.” Mays said, “Go on, I’ll have one of you any way.” Smith immed-
iately dropped down, and the constable felt the whirr of a shot over his left
shoulder. Mays then backed Smith with his revolver towards Fisher, who, however
made his escape into the bush. After dodging about from tree to tree, a groom of
Messrs. Robertson and Wagner’s and a hawker named Sheldrick came up, and
Mays secured Smith, who said, “ I’m glad you didn't shoot me, for I know you
meant it.” He was then conveyed to Melbourne gaol, and Superintendent Furnell,
accompanied by Mounted-constables Mays, Costello, Chisholm, and a black-tracker,
started in pursuit of Fisher, who had been seen making in the direction of Darling-
ford and the Big River. He was traced to a hut on the Big River, where he stuck
up the inmates, taking a shirt and a pair of boots, and then started off towards
the Upper Goulburn. By means of the tracker he was followed until reaching the
junction of the Acheron and Goulburn rivers. Thinking it was possible he would
here turn back towards the Yarra track, Superintendent Furnell divided his forces.
Together with constable Mays and the tracker, he started towards Fisher’s Creek.
Costello and Chisholm being sent down the Acheron River in the same direction.
Upon striking the Fisher’s Creek road about nine o’clock on the Bth December,
they discovered traces of the man they were in search of, and resolutely followed
the tracks until about three o’clock, when they lost them among some brushwood.
After some consultation it was decided that Chisholm should follow along the
Yarra Track in search of the man, while Costello, in company with a bullock
driver they had met, should turn back towards the Acheron River. Having traced
the footsteps back a short distance, constable Costello caught sight of a man
carrying a swag making through the brushwood towards some dense scrub. The
c mstable drew his revolver, and called upon him to surrender himself prisoner,
which after a short parley he did. Without dismounting the policeman ordered
him to open his swag, thinking that perhaps he had his firearms concealed inside,
but such was not the case. Costello then dismounted from his horse, which he
suffered to go at large, and proceeded to take a sheath knife from Fisher, who,


preceiving a chance of escape, made a dash for the scrub. A smart chase ensue ,
in the course of which Fisher was seen to throw a watch and chain into some
brushwood, but fortunately before reaching the scrub he was headed by the bul oc
driver and secured. Upon reaching Fisher’s Creek he was at once identified by
constable Mays as the man who fired at him, and he was then broug in 0
Melbourne. The career of these miscreants happily was a short one, and the
conduct of constable Mays was deserving not only of the highest praise, but o a
substantial recognition at the hands of the authorities.
Thomas Hughes,
The Western Australian bushranger was the latest addition to the lists of those who
have from some fancied wrong inflicted upon them, defied the laws, and defended
themselves from arrest by the free use of firearms. This man, although only 21
years of age, had shown himself possessed of considerable courage and perseverance,
qualities, which, had they been rightly used could not have failed to secure or
him advancement and prosperitv in his native land. With his parents and brothers
and sisters he lived for years in Fremantle, and began his career of wrong doings,
early in 1886, when he was tried and acquitted on the charge of burglary,
a few months later he was again arrested and once more acquitted^on a similar
charge, results entirely due to the able defence of his counsel, xtarly in 88
Hughes was again “ wanted ” by the police, and it was whilst he was being arres ed
on this charge that he shot Police-constable O’Connell, who died of his wound a
few days afterwards. Hughes had been long suspected, but no defini e in-
formation could be obtained until the burglary at the 1 reemasons Hote , er ,
when about £2O in silver was abstracted from a drawer. The Perth Inquirer saysi.
“Last evening, April 17, 1887, between Sand 9 o’clock, Police-constables
Franklin and O’Connell left the Fremantle Police Station to walk along the river
side, and after passing the East Fremantle Railway Station at a short distance
they met a man resembling Thomas Hughes, who it will be remembered was accused
of robbing Dearden’s hotel, coming from the direction of the North Freman e
Bridge. When the constables were passing him they remarked to each other mat
is Hughes.’ He immediately quickened his pace and went along between some
cottages and passed the house occupied by Rubury, and then crossed tne Can on-
ment-road where there are some palings, through which people pass to the Asy um.
When reaching the opening the constables were close upon the man, and as ne
was getting through the fence they both caught him by the leg, whereupon y a
quick movement he put his hand into his trousers pocket and drew out a revo ver,
and without any notice fired it off, the ball striking Q, Connell on the le s ou ei
and entering his body. It was very dark at the time and Hughes imme la e y
made off. A number of persons were quickly on the spot and conveye e
wounded man to Dr. Barnett’s surgery, when it was discovered the ball had
entered, but not passed through O’Connell’s body. In the meantime Police-constable
Franklin went along the road blowing his whistle and proceeded to the police-
station to report the occurrence. Sub-Inspector Back, Sergeant Peacoc e, an(
several constables were on the spot within 15 minutes after the outrage, an searc
was immediately made in the vicinity for the runaway, but no trace o im cou
be discovered. Father O’Reily kindly offered his apartments for the accommodation
of the wounded constable. His state was considered so critical that a magis ra e
took his depositions. When Police-constable O’Connell was first taken to Hr.
Barnett he was asked where he was shot and he pointed to his forehead it was
supposed that that was the only wound that had to be dressed. The man, however*
complained of having lost the use of his legs, which at the time was accounted for by
his having fallen on the handcuffs which he had held behind him. On mug a en
in by Father O’Reily he was undressed for the purpose of being put to bed, wnen
it was discovered that the constable had been shot through the shoulder, and a
the mark or wound on his forehead had been caused by coming in contact wi
some hard substance when he fell. Dr. Barnett was at once sent for, and he made
ever effort by probing to discover the direction of the ball, which he ultimately
concluded was lodged in the thorax.” , , . .
The poor fellow lingered until April 28, when death ended his sufferings.
The news of the fatal termination spread like wildfire, and the public excitement
became intense. Hughes was still at large, and no one knew when, where, or how
soon he would be heard of again. Meanwhile a close search was made, black-
trackers employed, and no stone left unturned to effect a capture. Hughes was an
experienced bushman, and knew the country well, so that there is reason to suppose
that he managed to elude the police by biding during the day and only venturing out


at night. Vague rumours were freely circulated as to his whereabouts, but it was not
nntil May 11th that he was actually encountered by the police on the Canning-road
about 1 £ miles from the Fremantle Police-station. He first fired at the police, who
returned the fire, but were unable to arrest him. They secured his swag. Hughes
fired five shots. Hughes first made his position known by firing at the police.
They did not see him, but had tracked him to Moore’s paddock. The first shot he
fired passed close to Corporal Hogan’s shoulder. Two other consecutive shots were
more at random. The police returned the fire. Hughes appeared surprised and
dropped his bundle, which the police secured and put in a place of safety. Some time
elapsed before Hughes fired again. He then fired two more shots. The police
returned fired again. Hughes did not reply, but decamped through the bush, which
being thick he eluded the trackers. The swag contained the following articles :
1 bunch (about 40 or 50) skeleton keys, 1 mortice chisel, 1 file, 50 or 60 revolver
cartridges, 1 revolver, 1 billy, 1 coat, 2 singlets, 1 belt, 1 hat, 1 woman’s apron, 1
shirt, 1 bridle, 3 empty brandy flasks, 1 flask brandy (partly used), 1 loaf of bread,
2 provisions bags, 50 or 60 cigars, 1 copy Western Mail, of 7th May, 1 copy of Daily
News, of 9th May, remains of a joint of beef, some small pieces of pork, 2 sacks
which had been used as blankets. When it was found that the swag contained
copies of Perth newspapers of recent date ; that there were also a number of
cartridges in it; that the brothers and sisters of Hughes had regularly purchased
these newspapers and that they had also purchased cartridges, Sub-Inspector
Back decided to arrest the whole family on a charge of harbouring. A warrant
was accordingly issued for their arrest, and they were taken to the Fremantle
lockup. Whilst in the Roundhouse the mother indulged herself in making a dis-
turbance, and boasted that her boy Tom had seen O’Connell’s funeral. Hughes
was again discovered, and a number of shots exchanged, but once more eluded
capture, and the work of tracking continued until Saturday, July 2, when he was
tracked from Canning to three miles south of Fremantle. The police party con-
sisted of Constables Gee, Leary, and Hogan, and a black-tracker. Gee was the
first to see Hughes running at full speed and gave chase. Shots were exchanged
several times. The other constables then rode up, and after further firing Gee
wounded Hughes in the left thigh. Hughes surrendered quietly, and was then
taken into Fremantle, where the inhabitants turned out en masse to see the prisoner.
The police behaved with commendable coolness, Gee especially being praised for
his courage. Brought to trial at the criminal sessions of the Supreme Court for
the murder of Constable O’Connell, the jury—in the face of the clearest possible
evidence, and to the profound amazement of the public —declined to convict the
accused of murder, but returned a verdict of manslaughter. Then Hughes was
charged with shooting Police-constable Carroll with intent to kill; but the second
jury also took the criminal’s part, and found him guilty upon a less serious count
of “ unlawfully wounding.” For the first offence the Acting Chief Justice sen-
tenced the prisoner to penal servitude for the term of his natural life. And upon
the second charge his Honor passed upon him a merely formal sentence of two
years' imprisonment.
He was confined in the Fremantle gaol, where, with other prisoners, he was
engaged in sinking a dam. It was whilst so employed that he effected his escape.
It was only some few weeks previously that he was sentenced, and it was still later
when, knowing that his sentence meant but a short period of about 5 £ years, he ex-
pressed his intention of serving his sentence as orderly as possible and of turning
over a new leaf when liberated. If Hughes ever meant what he said previously
something must have occurred to alter his intention. A day previous a desperate
criminal, named Thompson had effected his escape from gaol, and this fact was
evidently in Hughes mind, for the time chosen for his own escape was at an hour
when the police must have neccessarily been on the move after Thompson. At the
Fremantle prison, the inmates breakfast between the hours of 6 and 7 a. m., and by
the latter hour all were at their work. Hughes, Jarvis, Green, and 6or 7 other
men were employed at quarrying out a tank which was to be used for the Fre-
mantle water supply. In the excavation was a warder named Craik, whose duty
it was to see that the work was properly done - Being constantly close to the pri-
soners, Craik had no arms—a precaution taken to prevent prisoners at any time
overpowering him and seizing his weapons. On the level ground, above the
tank, was guard Rogers, who carried a double-barrelled fowling piece, the cartridges
for which contain large shot and slugs. And again, as a precautionary measure,
no prisoner is allowed within 15 yards of the guard. This prevents any attempts
being made by prisoners to wrest the arms from the guard. At about nine in tbe
morning, the prisoner Jarvis left the excavation and proceeded to the tool house,


which is situated on the level ground. Having only about another month of his
sentence to do, Jarvis was treated with greater laxity than the other prisoners, on the
supposition that a man who is shortly to receive his liberty will not do anything to
risk being given his freedom when his time expires. Having got some tools from
the tool house, he returned and passed quite close to the guard, who had himself
gone towards the tool house to see what Jarvis was doing. Seeing that there was
nothing suspicious about the prisoner’s manner, he took little further notice of him
and allowed him to pass within a couple of yards from him. No sooner had Jarvis
got past then he turned round and clutched the guard, who was holding his gun in
his hand. The seizure was made right round the waist, with guard Roger’s hands
and arms by his side. There was a bit of a scuffle, but Jarvis maintained his hold.
Seeing his opportunity, Hughes rushed up from the tank and twisted the gun from
the guard’s hand. Having command of the situation then Jarvis released the
guard, and pointing the gun at him demanded his cartridges and keys. Being ab-
solutely powerless Rogers surrendered four cartridges (there being also two in the
gun) and his keys. After stating that he had nothing further about him he was
escorted by Hughes to an adjacent watercloset and there locked up. Returning to
the tank Hughes bade warder Craik come up, and having no means of defence he
was obliged to obey. He too was locked in the watercloset with Rogers. Two
prisoners, one of whom was named Green, then made an attempt to prevent
Hughes’s and Jarvis’s escape. They were, however, soon quieted, for Hughes
immediately levelled the gun and discharged one barrel at Green. The pair then
got a plank, which they placed alongside the wall. This they climbed to the top
and then jumped. It is stated that Hughes, in jumping, hurt his ankle, for when
seen afterwards he was going somewhat lame. The firing of the shot attracted the
attention of warder Hawkins, who at once ran to the tank. The other prisoners
in the gang gave the alarm, and Rogers and Craik were at once released by Haw-
kins. On getting particulars of what had happened, Hawkins at once gave chase
with a revolver in hand. When last seen he was 200 or 300 yards behind Hughes
and Jarvis, and if he could have kept up until the police got on the scent, there
was some little chance of a capture.
Hughes and Jarvis were at large until the 19th, when they were caught a mile
this side of Guildford. Constables O’Hara and Hackett and two natives, while
riding through the bush, came suddenly upon the two escapees, who were sitting
by a camp fire preparing tea. The police sprang upon them, and before any resis-
tance could be offered had secured them. On the previous night Padbury, Loton,
*&. Co’s store, at Guildford, had been broken into, and a rifle, ammunition, pro-
visions, and other things stolen. Some of the articles were found in a very large
swag, which, was .carried by Hughes. When arrested the two prisoners were
brought into Perth on horseback. Both were dressed in civilian’s clothes. The
news of their arrest spread like wildfire through the city, and by the time they reached
the Central Police Station a vast concourse of people assembled in the street and
closely pressed one another to obtain a view of the prisoners. After the escapees
were placed in the prison van to be conveyed to the Perth Gaol, an attempt was
made to raise a cheer for Hughes, but it was not very successful. The capture
formed a staple subject of conversation, and the ease with which it was effected,
went far to destroy that sympathy which had previously been manifested on his
behalf by a large number of people amongst the lower classes.
Hughes was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in irons, and to receive 36
lashes of the cat-o’-nine-tails, for escaping from the Fremantle Gaol.
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN BUSHRANGERS
Have been few in number, and even these cannot claim to have been so blood-
thirsty as those of the adjoining colonies. Indeed, nearly all the bushrangers who
infested this colony in the early days were escapees from Botany Bay and Tasmania.
Amongst these may be mentioned Hughes, Curran, and Fox. the two former of
whom were hanged outside the Adelaide Gaol on March 16, 1840, whilst Fox was
reprieved and sent back to Sydney. In “ Tolmer’s Reminiscences’’ particulars of
the execution of Curran and Hughes are fully given :
“ Since their condemnation the conduct of the two men had been anything
but what could be expected from persons conscious of the awful fate which was
awaiting them. They ate, drank, smoked, and slept quite unconcernedly ; nor did
the sight of the scaffold, and the multitude assembled, to witness them receive the
reward of their crimes, seem to have much effect. In one of them at least—Hughes
—bis conduct to the last moment evinced a most perfect indifference to his fate
and to everything. He seemed actually to have gone beyond the line of demarca-


tion which subsists between the human and brute' creation. Whilst they were
pinioning him he begged of me to let him have a whiff of a pipe. Not thinking
any harm in granting him this slight indulgence, I told one of the constables to
fill him a pipe of tobacco, with which, immediately upon its being lit and placed
in his mouth, he rushed outside and ran up the scaffold, to my utter horror and
astonishment. I was severely censured by the public press atthe time for permitting
such a revolting exhibition; but I was perfectly helpless under the circumstances, and
consequently the blame was unmerited. On the scaffold he was attended by the
Rev. Mr. Stow, who used his every endeavour to bring the unfortunate wretch to a
sense of his situation, but apparently without effect. When the executioner ap-
proached to put the fatal noose round his neck, he rushed on him, and would have
struck him had not his arms been pinioned behind. Several times the executioner
attempted to get the rope round his neck, but Hughes kicked, and the executioner
was obliged to get two men to hold him. When the noose was got round his neck,
and the cap drawn over his face, he then stood quiet, being either stupefied or
finding that it was of no use to resist.”
“ Both the criminals were Irishmen. Curran was a Roman Catholic, and was
attended, while in prison and on the scaffold, by Mr. Phillips, The Rev. Mr.
Howard and the Rev, Mr. Stow were also unremitting in their attendance on Hughes,
but their exertions appeared to have no effect on him ; indeed, such a hardened
wretch as he was has seldom been brought to the gallows. Even at the last
moment, when the bolt was withdrawn and the scaffold trap fell, he made a
desperate spring, caught the side opening with one of his feet, and whilst in that
position the Rev. Mr. Howard went forward and kicked his foot off.”
The first execution in the colony was that of Magee, for shooting at Mr. Samuel
Smart, the sheriff of the colony. An eye-witness (“ Tolmer’s Reminiscences ”) thus
describes the scene at the execution :
“ Magee was an Irish Catholic, about 24 years of age, and had been found guilty
on the clearest evidence of forcibly entering the sitting-room of Mr. Samuel Smart,
the sheriff of the colony, and maliciously snooting at him with an intent to kill,
&c. ; he failed in his object, the ball having merely grazed Mr. Smart’s ear, and
done him providentially no further injury than a few gunpowder marks on his left
cheek.
“ I must do the good people of Adelaide the justice to say that in their hearts
they lamented the necessity of such an awful and severe example.
“ Execution was ordered to be done on the body of Michael Magee on Wed-
nesday the 2nd May, six days only from passing sentence. In the absence of any
clergyman of the Romish Church, the convict made application to be allowed the
attendance of a respectable tradesman of that persuasion occasionally while he
was in gaol; and, as he was thought not ill-adapted to afford Magee the usual
consolation of religion, the authorities immediately complied with bis request.
But it was not so easy a matter to find an executioner as it was a priest, and to
the honour of Adelaide be it spoken this difficulty became every hour of a more
serious and pressing urgency. 4 Who was to be Jack Ketch V was the first question
in the morning and the last at night. Five pounds were offered, and then ten, so
the report spread ; but it was all in vain, for though sensible of the benefits that
would accrue to society by the extreme example that was going to be made, yet no
man would accept the proffered reward, and they one and all spurned with an
honest and virtuous indignation any amount of remuneration which could pos-
sibly be offered for the detestable office. The difficulty of course as Wednesday
approached was getting greater and greater. What was to be done ? One sug-
gested that it ought to have been made a condition in commuting the sentence of
Magee’s companion in crime, one Morgan, that he should act asexecutioner ; whilst
some suggested this plan and some the other. At all events, it was agreed on all
hands that it would not be seemly or decorous for the sheriff himself to perform the
melancholy office, because he it was who had been fired at, and to atone for which
it was that an executioner was required. Of course these were merely rumours,
but it will probably never be known who the individual was who hanged the first
capital convict in South Australia. Wednesday morning had now arrived, and
nearly the whole population of the colony was on the move by an early hour. At
least a thousand persons, one half of them females, were seen hastening to a wide-
spreading gumtree on the north bank of the little brook, that gurgles in the ravine,
’yclept the Torrens, and close to the iron stores of the Colonization Commissioners,
to see the ceremony. It was the only sutiable tree on Government land adjacent
to the town, and was selected as being furnished with a large projecting horizontal
bough, that will long he remembered, on the left band of the public road from the


Port to the town. At nine o’clock the procession was discovered coming through
the trees ; there were about ten of the newly-mounted police, besides the sixteen
marines forming the whole military force of the colony, and then followed a
common cart drawn by two horses, one before the other, in which was seated the
culprit on a common deal coffin, with his arms loosely tied behind him. With him
was seated on the coffin a man in a horrid mask, grotesquely daubed beneath the
eyes with white paint, having one hump on his back, and another on his breast,
and so frightfully disfigured that he seemed like an imp of Erebus ready for his
prey, while all the spectators seemed to feel a thrill of horror creeping through
their veins. It was a moment of the most intense and exciting interest ; many
wished they had not come ; and as the procession advanced the well-known service
for the burial of the dead was heard from the mouth of that excellent man, the
Rev. Mr. Howard, the colonial chaplin, bringing up the rear : ‘ I am the resurrec-
tion and the life ; ’ and all hats were instinctively oil in an instant on hearing the
solemn words. The police on horseback with their drawn cutlasses, and the detach-
ment of marines with fixed bayonets, now drew in along with the cart to a tem-
porary enclosure something like a sheep-pen underneath the tree, surrounding the
prisoner, while the hempen noose was dangling from the bough on which the law
had destined him to die. His nerve was truly astonishing ; he behaved with a
fortitude and coolness deserving a better fate, and appeared the only person un-
flurried in the crowd. Whilst the last finisher of the law was busied in adjusting
the rope and greasing it up and down with his filthy fist, Magee addressed the
sheriff and the assembled multitude in a firm and audible voice, confessing the
crime of which the jury had found him guilty, and addmitting the justice of his
sentence for which he was about to suffer, but adding that the evidence which had
been so industriously sought out against him and brought forward at the trial,
attempting to prove that he was a runaway convict from the other colonies, was as
false as God was true. As soon as the cap had been drawn over his face and the
prayers were concluded, a motion was made that all was ready, and with a whip or
two of the leading horse the cart was drawn away, and many shut their eyes
whilst the poor sufferer was launched into eternity. But here commenced one of
the most frightful and appalling sights that never perhaps will be again witnessed
in the colony. The noose had been so badly managed that the knot came right
under the chin instead of the ear of the dying man, and as the cart was very
slowly drawn from under him, he did not fall, but merely slid gradually off ; and
there he was hanging in the air, uttering the most excruciating ‘ Oh, God !
Oh, Chirst! save me 1’ and, to make it worse, he had been so badly pinioned that
he got both his hands up to the lope above his head to-prevent his choking, and to
ease the strain upon his neck. What was to be done? Jack Ketch was gone I
where was he ? He had been seen to gallop off, amidst the bootings of the people,
on a horse that had been previously provided for the purpose, immediately the
cart had been driven away. ‘ Fetch him back 1 ’ was voiciferated by the crowd,
and one of the mounted police was dispatched after him at fall gallop, All this
while the poor hanging man was uttering the same piercing cries that might have
been heard for a quarter of a mile — 1 Lord save me ? Chirst have mercy upon me !
and nobody knew what to do. Some compassionating his sufferings, cried 1 Cut
him down 1’ whilst others, with a different kind of commiseration, urged the
marines to shoot him with their muskets to put an end to his misery, whilst the
poor wretch was making the most powerful efforts with his hands up to the rope
to prevent his suffocation. It was a horrid sight to witness the twisting of the
rope, and the man turning round like a joint of meat before the fire, whilst women
were fainting, and the sheriff attempting to address the multitude amidst the fierce
cries of ‘ Shame 1 Shame 1’ Jack Ketch was now seen riding back in his diabolical
disguise, with the policeman at his side ; and amidst one universal shriek of exe-
cration the horrid monster began again his work of death. At one bound he made
a fiendish leap upon the body of the dying man, and all was comparatively hushed
—the strong man’s hands could cling no longer to the rope, and his agonizing cries
were heard no more. We left the executioner hanging on by the legs of the dying
culprit, who, after the lapse of thirteen minutes by the watch, was still alive, for
now and then there was heard a few faint murmurs, and the body even yet
exhibited some strong contortions; but it was enough ; the crowd was seen dis-
persing here and there amidst a pensive silence through the forest, all hearts
sickening and sad at the melancholy spectacle, and all of them having engraved on
their memories to their own dying days the first execution in South Australia ”
The most noticeable of the early bushrangers in the colony were John Gofton,
Fenton, and Stagg, who, including a number of others, were engaged in cattle*


stealing—the animals being then slaughtered and the meat sold. The haunts of
this gang was the Black Forest, on the road to Glenelg, and near where the Halfway
House now stands. Inspectors Tolmer and Alford, with several of the police force,
were instrumental in dispersing the band, of whom Stagg was hung, Gofton shot
by one of his mates, and Fenton made good his escape from the colony.
Another gang, under the leadership of one Gilkes, for some time existed on
Kangaroo Island. The gang consisted of escapees from Norfolk Island ; but,
thanks to the wonderful ability of Inspector Tolmer, they were nltimately cap-
tured and sent back to Tasmania in 1844.
Another Tasmanian gang consisting of convicts named Rodgers, Reilly, Lynch,
and Reynolds, were captured by Inspector Tolmer on Yorke’s Peninsula in 1848
under the most difficult circumstances, which are graphically described in the
pages of the Inspector’s “ Reminiscences.” They were a most blood-thirsty lot,
and the thanks of the early settlers, as well as ourselves of the present day, are
due to the police under Inspector Tolmer for ridding the colony of these pests
before they had time to commit such terrible crimes as they were guilty of previous
to their escape from Tasmania.
ENCOUNTER WITH BUSHRANGERS AT BENDEMEER, N.S.W.
The shooting of a bushranger named Cranley by Constable Bowen, at Avery’s
hotel, Bendemeer, near Tamworth New South Wales, on the 14th July, 1887,
created considerable excitement at the time. It appears Cranley, in company
with another bushranger named Wonnocott, had been staying at Avery’s hotel for
two days. Avery went to Tamworth on the morning of the 14th July, and the
bushrangers finding out where he had gone, about 4 p.m., one of them came into
the bar, locked the door, and, presenting a revolver, bailed two men up. One of
the desperadoes then ordered Mrs. Avery into the bedroom, but she declined to go.
He then said, “ I want your money,” She ran round to the front of the house, and
the man with the revolver went through the house to the front door. He then
covered Mrs. Avery with a six-barrelled revolver, asking for her money, and also
ordered her into the bedroom. He said, “ You are a woman,” Mrs. Avery replied,
“ Yes, and you are no gentleman.” He then counted twelve and three, and fired
at her. The bullet struck the wall about half a foot from her, and when the man
fired he was about eight paces from her. She then ran away and the ruffian
attempted to fire at her again, but the cap snapped. Meanwhile Constable Bowen
arrived, tying his horse up against the post, and stood about nine paces from the
bar door, on the footpath. With that Cranley came outside the bar door, and
covering Bowen, said to him, “ Who are you ?” The ruffian then fired, just as the
officer was “ pulling together.” Bowen called on him to surrender, but the reply
he got was the man firing at him. He missed Bowen, who was only about seven
to eight yards from the desperado. Bowen stood firm as a rock, and fired with
partial effect, shooting the robber in the breast, a very little from the right nipple.
The man then fired at Bowen at about the same distance, but fortunately the cap
snapped, and as he attempted to fire again for the third time, Bowen replied with
the second shot, shooting him in or near the right hip, just as the man was falling
from loss of power. He died in less than five minutes after the second bullet
was delivered. His mate meanwhile went into his bedroom, pretending to be asleep,
and Bowen arrested him. Some crape and about thirty-two rounds of ammuni-
tion were found on him and in his swag. When Cranley’s body was searched a
photograph of a young woman was found. An inquest was held on Cranley, the
jury returned a verdict that the deceased came to his death by a gunshot wound,
inflicted by Constable Bowen whilst in the execution of his duty ; that no blame
attached to the officer, and they recommend him for promotion in the police force.
The deceased was identified by Mr. Robson, a farmer, of Cockburn River, twelve
miles from Tamworth, in whose employ he had been from the 27th April to 12th
July.
THE LANCEFIELD BANK ROBBERY.
The raids of the Kelly gang upon the Euroa (Victoria) and Jerilderie (New
South Wales) banks had prepared the public mind to some extent for the perpe-
tration of any similar outrage. Nevertheless the greatest sensation was caused on
Friday, the 15th August, 1879, when it was announced that the Commercial Branch
Bank, at Lancefield, Victoria, had been entered about 10 o’clock in the morning
and robbed of over £BOO. Lancefield is a small township with only about 400
inhabitants, the houses being comparatively few and far between, a fact which
accounts for the impunity with which the perpetrators of the robbery were enabled
to carry out their object so successfully. The town is fourteen miles from the Lance-


field-road station on the north-eastern line, and forty-four miles from Melbourne.
On the morning of the day mentioned, the bank was opened by Mr. Morrison, the
accountant, at the usual hour. A few minutes afterwards two men entered, who
apparently came to transact business. One of them presenting a revolver at the
astonished official, exclaimed, “ We are the Kellys, put up your hands; we have
secured the police. Mr. Morrison felt that he was powerless, and had no other
alternative than to comply with their command. The taller man then went round
to the back of the counter, and while his companion stood, revolver in hand, he
proceeded to pinion the hands of Mr. Morrison behind his back. At this time Mr.
Carlisle, the manager, was in the garden attached to the bank at the rear digging
potatoes, having not the least suspicion of what was occurring inside. The robbers
then proceeded to rifle the drawers and safe, but apprehensive of being disturbed
in their operations they gagged Mr. Morrison, and threatened to shoot him if he
gave the alarm, Having possessed themselves of notes and gold to the extent
stated above, they asked if there was any more, to which Morrison accorded a
negative reply. He also contrived to intimate that £lO of the money taken from
the drawers belonged to him, and this the robbers returned. Having secured the
plunder they were about taking their departure when a Mr. Charles Musty, a butcher,
living in the locality, entered. The thieves seemed at first nonplussed, but, re-
covering themselves, they told Musty to “ bail up.” This was regarded by the new
comer as a good joke, and he thereupon laughed heartily, and said, “ What a lark.”
The close proximity of a revolver to his head changed the aspect of affairs. Musty
at once grasped the situation, and became most accommodating. He marched into
the manager’s room and took a seat, assuring the robbers he would not make the
least noise, and suggesting that the blind of the window in the room should be
pulled down, so that nothing could be seen of what was going on from outside.
He then sat down, and the door was locked upon him. He had in his pocket at
the time £2OO, which he had intended to lodge in the bank. This he carefully
drew out of his pocket and planted under the hearthrug in the room, thinking he
might.be subjected to search. He remained in the room for some minutes awaiting
the course of events, until he heard his name called outside, and was informed
that the robbers had cleared off. They had left Mr. Morrison bound and gagged,
threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm before they bad time to clear out of
the township. With some difficulty Morrison freed his hands and removed the
gag, and ran to inform the manager. The police and Mr. turner, of the head
office of the Commercial Bank, were immediately communicated with, but unfor-
tunately sufficient time elapsed to enable the robbers to walk leisurely and make
for the scrub in a northerly direction. They were known to be on foot, and their
tracks, owing to the recent rains, were easily discernible. The people of the town-
ship were prevented from distinguishing themselves in the pursuit owing to a
telegram from Superintendent Winch directing that the tracks should not, by being
followed up in a promiscuous manner, be obliterated. The Queensland black
trackers were sent for, and arrived at the scene of the outrage the following
morning, accompanied by a large posse of police and mounted troopers. In the
meantime, however, the two robbers—whose names turned out to be Robert Bray,
a young man born in the colonies, and Samuel Lowe, an old hand, and wanted for
some time by the police for attempted murder—had secured a seat in a farmer’s
cart, and were enabled to make their way to Bendigo, where they arrived the
day following the robbery. Here they commenced, like diggers in the early days,
to knock down the money. They afterwards reached Eaglehawk, and with an
infatuation and recklessness that seemed surprising, they renewed their debauch,
remaining in one of the local hotels until evening, when they secured a vehicle
and drove over again to Bendigo. Information reached the police shortly after
this of the presence of the men in the city, and a clue having been obtained, the
hotel where they had been was visited. The birds had flown, but sufficient was
gleaned to enable the police to follow up the scent. About midnight Constable
Fox observed a suspicious-looking individual with a carpet bag in his hand, and
answering the description of one of the men wanted, proceeding along one of the
leading thoroughfares. , He at once accosted him, and desired his company to the
watch-house. The stranger without a word consented. On arrival he was searched
and questioned, when his identity could no longer be concealed. He admitted that
his name was Samuel Lowe, that a warrant was out for his arrest for attempted
murder of an Italian at Goornong, and that he was one of those who robbed the
Lancefield bank. The police soon afterwards found Bray sleeping in an hotel at
Bendigo, and arrested him with a large amount of the money stolen in his pos-
session. The whole of the money, with the exception of a few pounds, was


recovered. At the following Criminal Sittings of the Supreme Court the prisoners
were sentenced to four years each on the roads.
