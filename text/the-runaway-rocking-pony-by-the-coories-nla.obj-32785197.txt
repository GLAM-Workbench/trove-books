the Runaway ( T{pcking Cpony
ONCE upon a time there
lived in a little back street
in Collingwood, a carpenter and
woodturner named Jim Smith,
and at the back of his cottage
there was a big shed where he worked at his trade of
making toys for girls and boys. He liked best to make a
toy which would do for a girl or a boy— amongst these he
liked best to be making a rocking pony, and he was very
clever at the work—he was so clever that all the rocking
ponies which he made were so like real ponies that when
you looked at any of them you would think that they
could gallop away by themselves.

OW this carpenter had a lovely
little daughter named Elsie, who
liked all the rocking ponies, and she used
to go to the shed after tea and watch her
father as he worked away at his bench.
There was one pony in particular on
which he spent a great deal of time, and
both Elsie and her father used to say
that it was so lovely that they thought it
surely would one day be able to gallop
bv itself.
Elsie used to help her father and do
lots of little jobs in the shed, for she
liked helping her Dad, but one job in
particular was all hers, and it was this:
as each pony was nearly finished she had
to find a name for it. This very special
lovely pony she named “Dapple,” so, of
course, he had to be painted dapple grey.
Jim Smith and Elsie grew so fond of
Dapple that they could not bear to send
him off to the big shop in Smith Street
or Bourke Street, so they kept him in the
shed, where he became a model for them
to copy for more ponies, and Elsie, when
she grew tired, would sit on Dapple’s
back and watch her father at work—or
often, when she came home from school,
she would sit on Dapple and rock away,
thinking she was galloping out beyond
Heidelberg, past the lovely grass pad-
docks and trees. She nearly always chose

Heidelberg for her gallops because those
were the roads she used to travel along
sometimes on a Sunday with her father
and mother when they drove with the real
pony and piano-box buggy. There were
times, too, when as a very special favour,
she would bring a schoolmate home after
school, and let her have a rocking gallop
on Dapple.
After some years had passed, Elsie
grew up and left school. It was then that
Mr. and Mrs. Smith decided to go and
live in South Africa to be near M rs.
Smith s favourite sister. Of course, they
could not take all the things they loved
with them, and every time Elsie thought
of parting with Dapple tears used to start
into her eyes. She thought she saw a
tear in her father s eye, too, when he
said one night, “Of course we can’t take
Dapple with us on the ship. You see
they had said so many nice
Dapple for ten years that they nearly
believed he could gallop by himself, so
in the end the carrier took him off to a
big emporium in Bourke Street to be
sold.
It’s all very fine to be in a magnifi-
cent emporium with bright lights, pretty
saleswomen, plenty of advertising, and
thousands of little boys and girls with
their mummies and aunties flocking
things about

around and patting you, pulling your
bridle, jumping on your back, pulling
your tail and mane, and wanting to own
you, but it was not nearly so intimate and
lovely as being stroked by Jim Smith and
Elsie; but such is life. One day a lady
said, “I would like to buy that one.”
Fancy saying ‘‘that one” about Dapple,
but buy him she did, and that evening a
carrier called and Dapple went out to
Balaclava. Poor Dapple kept on wonder-
ing where Elsie was, and what was going
to happen to him. It so happened he was
put into a back room to wait for a birth-
day that was just around the corner. It
did not matter to Dapple how beautiful
and grand the emporium had been, nor
this back room at Balaclava; neither of
them measured up to the shed where he
had lived for ten years, and where he
had been loved by all the family.
However, things were not too bad
after all, for a few days later he was
brought out on to the back lawn, where
a party was being held, and introduced
to his new owner. He even had his
photograph taken with his new owner,
who seemed to have a hand like Elsie’s,
not a hand that tugged and pulled, but
a hand which smoothed and patted, so
that life once more seemed really worth
while.

While Elsie was .growing up in
Rhodesia, South Africa, Dapple was
making new friends each time his little
owners changed their place of residence.
He moved with them to Hampton,
Kangaroo Ground, Rosanna, Heidelberg,
and all the time his new owner was
growing up. Later, her little girls owned
Dapple, then her nieces and nephews, and
he lived at Nagambie, Malvern, Haw-
thorn, then Sunshine, and off to the
country again at Tarrawarra. So you see
if the Rocking Pony had lived in a shed
in Collingwood for the first ten years of his
life, he made up for it by becoming a great
traveller afterwards, and made many
friends and companions, some with brown
eyes and some with blue.
Now you must soon find out how he
became known as the Runaway Rocking
Pony. It happened in this manner: Elsie,
his first owner, married after she had lived
in Rhodesia a number of years, and her
husband was a farmer. They lived away
out on the wide veldt, or country side,
near some lovely mountains. It is a very
beautiful country where the Brown’s live
—that is Elsie’s name now, Mrs. Brown—
and sometimes on summer nights when
there was a beautiful full moon they used
to sit out in the garden. Elsie used to
close her eyes and dream about old times
Very often her thoughts were of Dapple,

and it was on these occasions that the
wonderful thing used to happen. The
magic in the moon used to bring magical
thoughts into Elsie s mind. “1 wonder if
Dapple ever did really gallop,’ ’ thought
Elsie, T wonder what he is doing to-night,
I wonder if he has a nice owner who pats
him and strokes him like I did,’ and so
on and those were the nights which
acted like strange magic on Dapple.
When everybody was asleep he used to
slip off his stand and run away by himself,
galloping around to all the homes where
loving hands had patted and petted him.
The very first gallop took him to the shed
in the little street in Collingwood looking
for Elsie. Each other magical night he
galloped to one home or another, no
matter how long the distance, but he was
always back on his stand before the sun
rose the next morning.
One night he would go galloping,
galloping gaily, gaily over the Christmas
Hills down to Kangaroo Ground. Of
course, it was always on a magical
moonlight night when Elsie was thinking
of him that he really galloped, and
although people might hear his little
hoofs drumming over the ground, they
could not see him, that is unless they had
fairies eyes. You know that is is only
the fairies who can really see magical


things happening. Then another night
off he would go running away down the
roads to Rosanna and Heidelberg; an-
other night to Balaclava and Hampton;
another Hawthorn and Malvern; and
sometimes right away up to the Goul-
burn Valley near the weir at Nagambie.
Some of his little owners he would
never see again, because they had gone
a long, long way away, but he always
remembered them, especially the ones
who had loved him. Yet on these very,
very special nights when he got off his
stand and went in a running, skimming
gallop through the moonlight, he always
hoped to see them.
On those very special nights when
Elsie Brown used to sit so quietly in her
garden, her husband often used to won-
der what she was thinking of. He noticed
on these particular occasions that she
always had a very happy smile on her
face, but he never ever spoke to her about
it, though he did hear her say to herself
one night when she thought she was by
herself, “I wonder what you are doing
to-night, Dapple, my darling Runaway
Rocking Pony.”
