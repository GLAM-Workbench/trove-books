PRESBYTERIAL VISITATIONS.
“The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an
elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also
a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed; feed the
flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over
God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And
when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a
crown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewise, ye
younger submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of
you be subject one to another, and be clothed with
humility.”—l Pet., 5: 1-5.
The presbytery of Maitland, having resolved to adopt
the wholesome practice of Presbyterial Visitation
agreeably to the ancient usage of the Church of Scot-
land, directed the following Statement of its nature
and design to be published for the information of the
people.
The object of the presbyterial visitation of a con-
gregation is to ascertain the state of such congregation
in every respect, and particularly the character main-
tained by its minister, elders, and other office bearers,
and the manner in which they discharge their respective
duties.
With this view, after sermon, on the day appointed
for the visitation, the elders are examined respecting
the minister, the heads of families and minister re-
specting the elders, and the minister and elders re-
specting the congregation generally.

nister are such as the following :
Hath your minister a gospel walk and conversation
before the people? Doth he keep family worship? Is
he strictly temperate in his habits? Is he greedy or
worldly? Doth he keep familiar company with pro-
fane or scandalous persons? How spends he the
Sabbath after sermon? Is he at variance with any?
Or, is he well beloved of all? Doth he keep closely
at his ministerial work? Or, doth he occasion to
himself distractions and unnecessary diversions there-
from? Doth he preach sound doctrine so far as you
can understand? Doth he preach plainly or is he
hard to be understood? Doth he faithfully reprove
sin, especially such as most prevails among the people?
Doth he read a large portion of Scripture in public
and expound the same? Doth he seek to preach
Christ, his beauty and excellency, and to open up the
power and life of godliness? Is his preaching search-
ing, and calculated to discover to you your spiritual
state? Doth he ascribe conversion and sanctification
wholly to the grace of the Spirit, and not (like Papists
and Puseyites) to any efficacy inherent in religious
ordinances, or any power attached to the ministerial
office? Doth he visit the people, at least once a year,
in a ministerial way, teaching and admonishing from
house to house? Doth he administer the sacrament
of baptism in an orderly way, when the congregation
is convened, or doth he it at any time privately? How
often is the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper adminis-
tered? Doth he catechise the people? Doth he con-
vene the session frequently for prayer? Doth he
catechise the young, and how censures he contemners
of catechising? Is he careful to compose differences?
The heads of families are next examined, generally,


respecting the Elders—after which more particular
inquiries, such as the following, are addressed to the
minister:
Do all your elders attend gospel ordinances and the
meetings of the session? Are they grave, pious, and
exemplary in their lives and conversation? Do they
worship God in their families? Are they strictly
temperate in their habits? Are they “an example of
the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in
spirit, in faith, in purity?” Are they diligent and
impartial in the exercise of their office? Do they
visit the families within the bounds assigned to them
respectively; and are they careful to have the worship
of God set up in them ?
The following extracts in regard to the duties of
elders are from the Second Book of Discipline, Chap,
vi.:—
“It is not necessary that all elders be also teachers
of the word, albeit the chief should be such. Their
office is, as well severally as conjunctly, to watch
diligently over the flock committed to their charge,
both publicly and privately, that no corruption of
religion or manners enter therein.
“As the pastors and doctors should be diligent in
teaching and sowing the seed of the word, so the
elders should be careful in seeking the fruit of the
same in the people.
“ They should be diligent in admonishing all men of
their duty according to the rule of the gospel.”
After these inquiries have been made the minister and
elders are severally encouraged or admonished as the
presbytery sees cause, and are then examined respecting
the people:
Do the people attend ordinimes duly and timeously?
Are they diligent in improving the means of know-


wholly to the grace of the Spirit, and not (like Papists
and Puseyites) to any efficacy inherent in religious
ordinances, or any power attached to the ministerial
office? Doth he visit the people, at least once a year,
in a ministerial way, teaching and admonishing from
house to house? Doth he administer the sacrament
of baptism in an orderly way, when the congregation
is convened, or doth he it at any time privately? How
often is the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper adminis-
tered? Doth he catechise the people? Doth he con-
vene the session frequently for prayer? Doth he
catechise the young, and how censures he contemners
of catechising? Is he careful to compose differences?

Are they diligent in improving the means of know-


ledge? Do they encourage sabbath schools? Are
there any meetings for prayer and religious conference
among them, and are such meetings well attended'
Do they, by their words and actions, manifest suitable
respect for their minister and elders, “esteeming them
highly in love for their work’s sake?” What success
hath the gospel among them? Do any of them live
in open sin? Are any of them drunkards or tipplers !
Do they “remember the sabbath day to keep it holy”
according to the commandment? Are there any of
them that do not worship God in their families? Are
they careful to bring up their children in the knowledge
and fear of God, and to instruct their servants in
divine things?
