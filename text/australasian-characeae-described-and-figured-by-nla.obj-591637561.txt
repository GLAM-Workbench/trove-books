introduction.
Baron Ferd. yon Mueller, who is the author of several illustrated works on the
Australian Flora, has invited me to issue a similar work dealing with the Characece.
It is with his help that I begin this undertaking, the continuation of which must
largely depend upon such circumstances as the receipt of adequate material, and the
necessary time being available. I hope it may be the means of inducing other bota-
nists in Australia to study these plants, and thus arrive at better results than is now
possible.
Of the Characege, as of many other plants, it is essential that living specimens
should be examined, and their growth should be observed in all stages, from germination
to the ripening of the fruit. The best condition for determination is when the plant
is in ripe fruit, but younger specimens ought also when possible to be preserved. Of
dioecious species both male and female plants are necessary. The Australasian spe-
cimens of Characege which I have examined are for the most part badly preserved.
When collecting these plants care should be taken not to crush them, and, if carried in
a vasculum, they should be protected by other water plants, or be wrapped in damp
paper to prevent their drying up. In preparing for the herbarium, the plant should
be laid out while still wet, in a natural form, on good firm paper, or if necessary
floated out in water in the same way as seaweeds, and then dried under considerable
pressure. For microscopical examination portions of the plant should be kept in spirit
or other preservative fluid.
I would recommend "The Characege of America” by T. F. Allen, Part I (New
York, 1888) as the best introduction, in English, to the anatomy, morphology and
classification of the order.
The following are the principal works containing descriptions, figures, or particulars
of the distribution of the Australasian Characege:

In the present work each plate is numbered in the order in which it is issued,
for the sake of reference, but the plate and description of each species will be com-
plete in itself, so that they can eventually be arranged in any order that may be
preferred.
The diagnosis of each species is intended to include all its forms, whereas the
description refers only to the Australasian specimens I have examined.




Nordstedt, Australasian Characeae.
Mtella partita Nordst.
\
LittiE.Laue, Berlin. 18 9l


Nitella partita Nordst., nov. spec.
N. diarthrodactyla, homoeopliylla dioica, (gymnocarpa), cellulis ultimis foliorum
bi-trip artitis.
Diagnosis. Dioecious. Leaves 4 times divided, ultimate segments 2-celled.
Ultimate cell 2—3-partite. (Fruit not enveloped in mucus).
Description. Plant probably more than 1 dc high. Stem 0,6 mm thick. Leaves
about 6 in a whorl, about 10 mm long, 300 p thick at the base, 4 times divided.
Segments at the first forking 4—6, at the second 3—5 of which 2—4 are again
divided, ultimate segments 150—180 p thick, ultimate cell 100—150 p long, 40—
52 p thick at the base, bi-tripartite with cuspidate diverging points, like a Neptune’s
trident. Oogonia solitary, or rarely 2 together, the upper parts of the enveloping cells
elongating, with spaces between them for fertilization. Coronula short.
Of this new and very interesting species only one small specimen with unripe
fruit has been seen by me. At first sight it looks like Nitella tricuspis but on a
closer examination the forked apices of the leaf are seen to consist of only one bi-
tripartite cell and not as in N. tricuspis of 2—3 I—3-celled segments. Such a for-
ked terminal cell does not occur in any other known species of Nitella.
Habitat. Queensland. Georgina River. Alfr. Henry (comm. F. yon Muller).

or at least to a variety of N. suUihssima , distinguished by the thinner cell-walls and
the shorter mucrones. This requires further examination.

einige extraeurop. Charac.) ibid. vol. 25 pp. 11 & 25.
N. diarthrodactyla, homceophylla , monoica, gloeocarpa, foliis duplicato divisis,
verticillis superioribus eximie brachyphyllis, nucleo oogonii castaneo atro, 8-gyrato,
300—350 p longo.
Diagnosis. Monoecious. All the leaves of a whorl nearly equal, twice divided.
Fertile whorls with short leaves in interrupted spikes, enveloped in mucus. Oospore
dark brown with 7—B striae.
Description. Plant slender, pale green, (100 —200 mm high). Stem about
350—455 p thick. Lower whorls with comparatively long leaves (10 —18 mm), the
upper small, only 4—5 mm in diameter, usually in interrupted spikes. Leaves 6—B
in a whorl, once, or partly twice, divided, with 3—5 segments in each forking, the
basal segment of the sterile leaves s—lo mm long, 100 —125 /u thick, the ultimate
segments 50—100 p thick, 2-celled, the inferior cell nearly of an equal thickness
throughout, but narrowed at the top into the acute mucro-cell, which is 30—35 p
thick and 76 —lOO p long. Oogonia at all the forkings, upper part of the enveloping
cells but little elongated, with spaces for the fertilization. Oospore dark brown,
310—350 p long, 300—320 p broad with 7—B but slightly prominent ridges, the
coloured membrane thickly dotted with small acute elongated spines, (about 3 p long),
the ridges sometimes more persistent and winglike (fig. 5) when they are also
dotted with spines, but less thickly than the intermediate membrane. Antheridium
170—200 p in diameter
In appearance this species resembles N. gracilis f. heteromorpha. From N.
mucronata and N. gracilis it differs by the presence of mucus, the more numerous
striae on the oospore, the twice divided leaves with 3 —5 segments, and from the
latter species also by the larger oospore, by the ultimate segments being only 2-celled
and from the former species by the thinner stem. From N. batrachosperma it differs
by its larger size, thicker stem, larger oospores and antheridia, and by the more
numerous striae on the oospore; from N. intermedia by the short only twice divided
leaves of the upper whorls and the form of the end segments; and from all the
above species by the structure of the membrane of the oospore. From N. minuta
Allen it is distinguished by the larger size, more numerous striae on the oospore, and
by the form of the end segments.
Habitat. New Zealand, in bogs at Omatangi, near Taupo, 600 —900 metr,
above sea level.
In Alg. et Charac.” part 4 1. c. p. 25 I have mentioned a doubtful variety
of this species from Queensland, (still water near Brisbane, leg. T. Bailey, comm.
Arthur Bennett no. 2884 —5), and said that its determination was not certain, as the
oospores were not ripe and the specimens in some respects different from the type.
This form requires further observation; probably it will prove to be a distinct species.

Nitella tumida Nordst.
Lith. E.Laufe, Berlin. 16.^91.


Nitella tumida Nordst., nov. spec.
N. diarthrodactyla, lieteropliylla, dioica , foliis I — 2-plicato divisis, minoribus
interjectis pancioribus, segmentis ultimis infiatis.
Diagnosis. Dioecious, ordinary leaves 6, once or twice divided, smaller
(adventitious) leaves I—B, end segments 2-celled, ultimate cell mucronate, basal cell
much inflated.
Description. A minute plant only V 2 dc high, csespitose, stem about
1 / 2 mm thick. Lower internodes long, fertile whorls in small globular heads, 2 —6 mm
in diameter. Normal leaves usually 6 in a whorl, once or twice divided, with I—B
smaller once-divided, adventitious leaves between, the sterile 230 to 250 fi thick at the
base, none over 6 mm long, with long basal segment. Segments at the first division
4—7 all simple or 1 (seldom 2—4) again divided, end-segments swollen, usually
obovate mucronate, the mucro consisting of a small acuminate cell, the swollen basal-
cells about 450 —600 /m long and 300—400 fi thick, mucro 70 —100 p long, 25—35 p
thick. Oogonia I—s (perhaps even 6) together, broadly ovoid about 430 ju long,
330 ju broad, coronula small, the cells of the lower circle with projections inwards,
oospore 270—280 ju long, 230 /u broad, showing 7—B not very prominent striae, the
yellowish-brown under layer of the membrane with small projections, 4 —6 ju in diameter,
and corresponding excavations within, sometimes 2—3 confluent. Over the coloured
part of the membrane is a colourless perforated lamina. Antheridium 500 /li thick. In
some cases the adventitious leaves are very few or (in the fertile whorls) entirely
absent. The central segment of the leaves in the male plant is replaced by an
antheridium but, so far as I have seen, in the female plant it is never transformed
into an oogonium. This differs from all known species by its inflated 2-celled end-
segments. The only similar form is N. clavata, var. infiata, but the end-segments,
in that species, are unicellular.

N. tricellularis Nordst. De Alg. et Charac. 4, in Act. Univ. Lund. vol. 25 (1889) p. 9, t. 1 f. 13.
N. polyarthrodactyla, monoica, capitulis fertilibus minoribus in muco non
involutis, foliis simpliciter furcatis, foliolis brevibus tricellularibus , rarissime bi~
cellularibiis.
Diagnosis. Monoecious. Leaves once divided, leaflets usually short, of 3
(rarely 2) cells. Fertile whorls in small heads, without mucus.
Description. Ceespitose, bright green. Stem moderately stout (500—725 /a
thick), % —1 dc high. Leaves 6 (or often fewer) in a whorl (400 —600 p thick), once
divided, the sterile often only 15 mm long, end-segments 1 —3( —s) very short
(rarely longer), their length often not equalling the diameter of the primary segment,
3-(or 2-)celled. Fertile whorls forming small dense heads. Ultimate cells of the
leaflets short, acute, 60—137 long and 40—60 /a thick, the penultimate cell also
short, the basal cell longer. Oogonia often 2 together; eoronula small, oospore dark
brown 400—470 /a long, thick strongly 7 —B-striate, striee broad, coloured
part of the membrane between the strise of 3 laminae (and many lamellae), innermost
lamina lightish brown with very small irregular projections, 1— 3 a in diameter, the
intermediate brown with small excavations on the inner side corresponding with the
projections on the inner lamina, outer lamina dark brown with very small acute points.
Antheridium 270 /a in diameter.
The position of this species is doubtful. Yery few specimens have been examined,
those distributed under this name in Allen’s Charac. Americ. Exsicc. (Ease. 4 no. 40a)
probably belong to another species. As the . ultimate segments are sometimes, though
rarely 2-celled N. tricellularis may be referred to the section diarthrodactylm with
as much reason as many forms of N. gracilis and I had so placed it at first regarding
it as a subspecies of N. translucens the smaller forms of which it much resembles,
but I now think it better to include it as a species of the section polyartlirodactylce,
which section is well represented among the Australasian Nitellce. The nearest species
in this section are N. Zeyheri and N. Hookeri from which it is separated by the
once-divided leaves and short end-segments.
Habitat. New Zealand. Lake Pearson, prov. Canterbury, about 750 m above
sea-level.

N. diarthrodactyla, lieterophylla, dioica, ( glceocarpa), foliis minoribus interjectis
numerosissimis, majoribus partim 4-plicato divisis.
Diagnosis. Dioecious. (Young whorls with a mucous covering). The larger
leaves partly four times divided, the smaller (adventitious) leaves very numerous, ultimate
segments of the leaves two-celled.
Description. Stem rigid, stout, ( 3 / 4 —1 mm thick), moderately branched, lower
internodes long, upper shorter. Whorls very dense, spherical, 5—10( —30) mm in
diameter. Leaves short, rigid, the larger 7—B, three times, sometimes partly four
times divided, segments usually 5 —7 seldom, at the first division 11, smaller leaves
about 40, 1— 3 times divided, segments 3—7. Ultimate segments gradually tapering,
2-celled, the ultimate cell tapering to a sharp point. Fertile leaves about 280 g thick
at the base; ultimate segment at the base 80—100 g thick, at the middle 75—90 g,
near the apex 60—80 g\ ultimate cell 30—66 g thick at the base, 110—250 g
long. Sterile leaves of the plant from Lake Lewen 250—280 g thick at the base,
end-segments 800—1000 g long, 150—200 g thick at the base, 100—125 g thick
nearer the apex, the mucro 47—125 g long, about 45 g thick. Oogonia aggregated
(often 3 together) at the first and second forkings, not seen at the third or fourth,
rarely at the node of the stem in place of a small leaf, broadly ovoid; upper part of
the enveloping cells elongated, with narrow spaces for fertilization. Oospore dark
brown, 400—450 g long, somewhat flattened, its greater diameter 350—400 g, its
lesser 250 g, strise about 9, very broad, surface of the membrane slightly spongy.
From the other species of the ’’lieterophylloe” , it is distinguished by the rigidity
of the whole plant and the dense whorls; from N. conglobata, N. tumida and the
doubtful species N. lieterophylla and cemula by the more numerous small adventitious
leaves; from N. hyalina by being dioecious.

Gh. haplostephana, ecorticata, monoica genuina, nec antheridis, nec oogoniis in
in fundo verticilli, foliolis ad omnia geniculi folii.
Diagnosis. Stipulodes in a single circle, alternating with the leaves. Stem and
leaves without cortical cells; antheridia and oogonia (1 or more) together at the nodes
of the leaves; leaflets at all the nodes, (longer or shorter than the oogonia).
Description. Annual. A Nitella-like plant, usually but slightly incrusted. The
Australian specimens about 1 dcm high, stem 1 / 2 —1 mm thick. Whorls of B—lo
straight or much incurved leaves. Leaves of 4—5 segments, the ultimate very short,
scarcely exceeding the I—3( —4) leaflets at the uppermost node. Leaflets at the
I—21 —2( —3) fruiting nodes 4 —7, shorter than the oogonia, often unilateral, the posterior
leaflets not being developed. Oogonia single, coronula 150 — high and thick.
Oospore black, with 9 broad striae, 500—550 /a long, 350—370 ja thick.
This speeies is very variable. Al. Bkaun divided his Gh. coronata into a Braunii
(Gmel.) A. Be., f) Schiveinitzii, y Perrottetii, d Goromandelina. s leptosperma (inch
Oahuensis). Allen, who has seen many more forms, says *): ’’These varying characters
with their numerous combinations seem to us to render a division of the species into
definite varieties well nigh impossible”; —, ”it seems to us proper to describe
them as forms peculiar in many cases to certain localities.” ’’The variations of this
plant may be tabulated as follows, giving prominence to the size of the nucleus and
length of the bracts, allowing also for variation in the habit of growth, et cetera:
I. Microcarpa, nucleus less than 500 ju. in length.
1. Macroptila, bracts longer than the sporangia, verticillate or unilateral.
a, Condensata, verticils approximate, the leaves longer than the internodes.
b. Laxior, leaves loose, spreading.
c. Clausa, leaves compact, incurved.
A. Pachygyra, nucleus with thick prominent angles.
B. Leiopyrena, nucleus smooth, or with but slightly prominent angles.
2. Microptila, bracts shorter than the sporangium, verticillate or unilateral
a, Condensata.
b. Laxior.
c. Clausa.

Chara Braunii.
Habitat. Victoria. Near the Grampian Mts. (Forma meiocarpa, microptila,
unilateralis, pachygyra, laxior, coronula sporangii non multum divergenti).
South Australia. Pidinga. (No ripe fruit seen. Posterior leaflets sometimes developed).
Near Macdonald Range. Rev. W. F. Schwartz (comm. F. v. Mueller) (F. meiocarpa,
microptila unilateralis, incrustata, brachyphylla, clausa).
Queensland, Richmond River (F. meiocarpa, microptila,, subpachygyra, unilate-
ralis, clausa).
New South Wales. Darling River.
Geographical distribution. Europe, Africa, Asia, North and South America.
On Oahu one of the Hawaian Islands there occurs the following form, which may
probably be found in Australia. I have therefore copied two of Kiitzing’s figures. It
may be described as forma macrocarpa, meioptila, leptoptila, gracilior, cellulis coronulee
elongatis divergentibus.

Haplostephana, caule diplostiche corticate, tylacantha , dioica , antheridiis et oogoniis
quoque ad basin foliorum ecorticorum .
Diagnosis. Stipulodes in a single circle, one, or sometimes 2, at the base of
each leaf. Primary cortical-cells of the stem rather more prominent than the se-
condary. Leaves without cortex. Dioecious. Antheridia and oogonia also at the basal
node of the leaves.
Description. Stem slender, moderately branched, about 1 / 3 — 2 / 3 mm thick,
cortical cells twice (or sometimes irregularly three times) as many as the leaves, the
primary often but little the more prominent; spines very few, shorter, or a little longer
than the diameter of the stem, acute, solitary. Stipulodes often long, acute, directed
downwards, or some upwards. Whorls of 7—9 straight or slightly incurved leaves.
Leaves of 4—6 (rarely 7) joints, the ultimate acute, commonly exceeding the leaflets
at the uppermost node. Leaflets whorled, spreading, acute, 5—6 (seldom more) at the
fruiting node, I—4(—s)1 —4(—5) at the sterile, as long or twice as long as the oogonia, the
bract (= the leaflet under the oogonium) shorter than the others. Sometimes a small
bracteole is developed (fig. 18). On the male plant the leaflets shorter than the
antheridia. Antheridia 700 —900 ju in diameter, often 2( —3) together at the I—21 —2
lower nodes, or sometimes also at the outside of the basal node of the leaf. Oogonia
single or 2 or more together, at the 1— 2 lower nodes of the leaves, also at the out-
side of the basal node. Coronula with connivent or erect (or, teste Braun, divergent)
cells, 80—150 // high, 150—180 // thick. Oospore black, 330—430// long, 210—310//
thick, with 7—B but slightly prominent striae.
From 67/. mollusca it differs by the more acute stipulodes and leaflets, and by
the occurrence of oogonia and antheridia at the base of the leaves.
In the subspecies, subebracteata Nordst. (see tab. IX) the bract (under the
oogonium) is very small or more commonly wanting.
Habitat. Victoria. Near Port Phillip. (The only locality from whieli I have
examined specimens). Tasmania. Georgetown, near the sea, in places dry in summer.

Diagnosis. [Stipulodes in a single circle, one or sometimes 2 at the base of
each leaf, primary cortical cells of the stem a little the more prominent. Leaves
without cortex. Dioecious.] Antheridia also at the nodes of the stem. Bract (the
leaflet under the oogonium) very short or more usually not developed. Oogonia also
at the base of the leaves sometimes even on the inner side.
Description. Stem moderately branched, 250—700 p thick, series of cortical
cells (of the upper internodes) twice, or sometimes partly three times as many as the
leaves, the primary usually more prominent than the secondary, spines solitary, acute,
shorter, or sometimes a little longer than the diameter of the stem. Whorls of 6—9
straight or incurved leaves. Leaves of 4—6 joints, the ultimate joint acute, usually
exceeding the leaflets of the uppermost node. Leaflets whorled, spreading, acute, 6 at the
lower, 4—5 (or fewer) at the upper nodes. Instead of one or three leaflets on the inner
side of the I—2 lower fruiting nodes, there are oogonia and antheridia, rarely with a
very short bract under the oogonium. Leaflets longer or shorter than the oogonia.
Antheridia and oogonia also at the basal node of the leaf, antheridia on the outer side
only, oogonia on both the inner and outer sides. One leaflet is often replaced by
2—4 oogonia, the 1— 3 later from the base of the first (fig. 14); perhaps some of
them have taken the place of the bract or of the bracteoles of other Charm. Oospore
black, 280—350 p long, 180—300 p thick, with 6—7 but slightly prominent striae.
Coronula truncate, with connivent obtuse cells, 60 —180 high, 100—180 thick.
Antheridium 700—900 p in diameter.
Dr W. Migula, of Carlsruhe, to whom I sent specimens from AVimmera, found
in one instance a small bract under the oogonium. I have since seen similar cases,
especially where the oogonium was single. In the almost constant absence of the bract
(although perhaps a corresponding non-elongated cell may exist) this very interesting
plant shows a resemblance in the mode of fructification to the genus Lychnothamnus ,
in which the oogonium takes the place of a leaflet. I have therefore regarded it as
a subspecies rather than a variety of C. Leptopitys.
I have seen oogonia on the outer side only of the base of the leaves (although
they may also occur on the inner-side). The cortex of the stem is variable in both
this and the type, although perhaps more often 2 rows of secondary cells occur in
subebracteata. The coronula is more connivent in subebracteata , but this often varies
in different forms of the same species. The real affinity of these two forms can only
be ascertained by the examination of a larger number of living specimens, from different
localities, and in various stages of growth.
Habitat. Western Australia. Base of Stirling Range (f. macrocarpa, gracilior.
Oospore 400—430 p, 300 —320 p, thick, coronula 150—180 p high, 130 — thick).

Ch. haplostephana (unistipulata, alter nans) caule triplostiche cortieato , glabro ,
tylacantha , gymnophylla, monoica, foliis posterioribus deficientibus.
Diagnosis. Stipulodes in a single series alternating with the leaves (very rarely
2 together) Stem corticate. Series of cortical cells 3 times as many as the leaves.
Primary cortical cells a little more prominent than the secondary, without spines. Leaves
without cortex. Posterior leaflets very small or wanting. Monoecious.
Description. Often of a bright Nitella like green, rarely somewhat incrusted,
1 / 2 —2 dcm high. Stem rather stout, about 1 mm in diameter, but little branched or with
many branches from one of the lower nodes. The lower internodes naked, the upper
with 3 times as many series of cortical cells as leaves, the primary very little larger
than the secondary, without spines; and apparently without any undeveloped spine-cells.
Whorls of 7 —lO, slightly incurved leaves. Stipulodes acuminate, about Imm long
and 200—400 // thick, usually but one to each leaf (rarely 2), alternating with the
leaves. Leaves 10—30 mm long, of 3—5 segments, but slightly contracted at the
nodes, of which 2 3 are fruiting; ultimate segment very short, scarcely exceeding
the leaflets. Leaflets on the inner-side of the leaf, 4, seldom 6, acuminate, in length
about equalling the oogonium, 400—500 jti thick, very seldom a cell on the outerside
of the node is elongated into a very short spine. Oogonium single (so far as I have
seen), ovoid. Coronula 500 // high, 400 g thick, with erect or somewhat divergent,
acuminate or mucronate cells. Oospore ovoid 800—920 // long, 500—600 g thick,
Avith 9—lo rather sharp striae. Antheridium about 400 g in diameter.
From the rare European variety Baueri Al. Br. it is distinguished by the absence
of spines on the stem and of posterior leaflets, also by the larger fruit, and ought
perhaps to be regarded as a proper species.
Habitat. South Australia. ”In lacu Alexandrinae nec non in stagnis ad lacum
Yictorire.”
