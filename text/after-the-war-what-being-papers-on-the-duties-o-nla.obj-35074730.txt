After the War-What ?
The Duties of Labor.
ADELA PANKHURST.
A CAUSE OF WONDERMENT,
It will, no doubt, be a cause of wonder-
ment to future generations that the people
of our age, highly developed as they were
in some directions, tolerated so meekly the
shameless robbery of the masses by per-
sons who appeared to have no qualities of
mind or body which might account for
the mesmerism they exercised over the mil-
lions of their fellow-men.
POWER OF PRIESTHOODS.
The power of priesthoods in ancient civi-
lisations is more comprehensible, in that
the people who supported them were im-
pressed with the belief that the wrath of
God or of Nature was appeased, and His
favor propitiated, by the efforts of these
parasitic groups, who surrounded them-
selves with a veil of superstition, and
through it appeared to the masses as
beings who had attained an awful height
of moral superiority.
SUBJECTION TO CAPITALISTS
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
The subjugation of the people by great
fighting men in an age when the security


depended upon military prowess, as in the
rude struggles between tribes, and when
the civilised empires withstood the waves
of barbarian invasion, or by a class pos-
sessed of superior culture, ability, or learn-
ing, as in ancient Greece, is comprehen-
sible; but the control of our modern lab-
oring classes by the capitalists of to-day is
without any such reason or excuse.
THE RICH AND THE ARTS.
Our ?leisured class,? for the most part,
completely fails to fulfil the ?service to
humanity which is the best its defenders
claim for its justification?-namely, the de-
votion of persons freed from manual toil
for the cultivation of the arts and sci-
ences. The best artistic production is
not by any means the outcome of the
efforts of the wealthy; in fact, almost
every picture, book, or musical composition
of value has been produced by persons who
are under the necessity of earning a living.
Appreciation of art is very weak
amongst the wealthy. The Press and the
Stage, which cater for them, are a sure
indication of that fact. It is principally
in Continental countries, especially Ger-
many, where art is cheap enough for the
populace to patronise it, that the works of
great musicians and of great playwrights
can be produced on a commercial basis.
ART-CULTURE OF THE PROLETARIAT.
A much higher artistic level is reached
in the North of England, and in K the great
industrial centres of Scotland, where the
cultural needs of a more prosperous pro-
letariat is catered for by classical concerts


in the great halls at popular prices, and
where repertory theatres have grown up in
cities like Manchester, Liverpool, and
Glasgow, than in the south and west,
where the masses have been kept ignorant
and poor.
A COMPARISON OF SCHOOLS.
As far as refinement or morality is
concerned, the reverend centres of learn-
ing at Oxford and Cambridge, pre-emi-
nently the preserves of the rich and aris-
tocratic, have earned for,themselves a re-
putation for vulgar rowdiness of which a
camp of private soldiers would be ashamed.
State schools where the children of the
workers are educated are not the breeding
grounds of unnameable vices such as the
schools for the sons of the wealthy are well
known to be, and the adult life of the men
of the wealthy classes is best understood
by the existence of a traffic in women, so
lucrative that no legal penalties can sup-
press it.
THE REAL ?WHITE SLAVES.?
The owners of the means of life and of
capital are concerned in the terrible social
evil which poisons the human race, not
only as the clients of the procurers and im-
moral women, but as landlords drawing
high rents from brothels, dance halls,
hotels, and other places of assignation; as
bankers and bank shareholders earning a
percentage upon this, as upon any other
business; as lawyers earning fees in the
mass of legal business to which the exist-
ence of prostitution gives rise; and as the
purveyors, direct and indirect, of pictures.


books, films, liquor, drugs, and spurious
remedies which all contribute to debauch
the people.
INDIVIDUAL VIRTUES MUST
NOT BLIND.
The philanthropic efforts of a minority
of the leisured class ought not to blind us
to the evils of its existence as a class, any
more than the individual virtues of slave-
owners justified slavery. Tile endowment
of charities or the nlore enlightened
efforts towards social reform of Rockefel-
ler, Carnegie, or Cadbury ought not to
blind us to the fact that the surplus capi-
tal they control is earned by men, women
and children deprived of the means to be-
come complete human beings.
BOURN VILLE.
Cadbury's settlement at Bournville, with
its much-lauded means to improve the lot
of the workers, is perhaps the best of these
experiments. The conditions are as favor-
able as possible to such an enterprise, as,
to begin with, the manufacture of choco-
late and cocoa is an occupation harmless
to the workers and beneficial to the world.
Bm, a*oui first to last, our question must
be: Have the workers concerned been ade-
quately rewarded for their labor before
their employers abstracted the profits they
devote to themselves or their philanthropic
enterprises? In respect to the colored
labor of the cocoa plantations, the answer
must be emphatically: No! Shameless
as the exploitation of white labor is, the
robbery of the black man is infinitely more
iniquitous. Conditions approximating to


slavery still exist, and the tribal life and
the natural development of backward races
is broken up in a cruel and dangerous
manner. The whole transport of the raw
material by sea and overland is productive
of a profit made at the expense of the well-
being of the workers, and, within the ac-
tual scope of the Cadburys themselves, the
exploitation is just as flagrant, though pal-
liated by a sensible and profitable kindness.
The girls at Bournville are certainly well
fed and healthy, their lives brightened by
social intercourse in the shape of lectures,
swimming, and games. This, however,
gives them no security of employment, no
means by which they could develop excep-
tional talents, find the means to travel, or
provide adequately for sickness and old
age. The work of earning profits to sup-
port the Cadbury family and their social
efforts (no halo of credit for which sur-
rounds the girl workers) takes the best
energies of their youth, and little remains
for themselves after their services to their
employers are rendered.
The married employes, accommodated
though they may be with cheap and ...plea-
sant houses in the Bournville model vil-
lage, are not by any means able to live up
to the standard which members of the Cad-
bury family would think necessary for
themselves. Nor can these men and.
women, however humbly they may be con-
tent to live, prevent their children from
entering employment which presents the
worst features of exploitation and oppres-
sion.


CAPITALIST CHARITIES.
The imposing charities of multi-million-
aires are nothing but a small return, at the
arbitrary will of an individual, generally
very ignorant of the problems he has to
tackle, of wealth created by the commu-
nity. While society leaves the power of
providing it with art, literature, education
and amusement to individuals, it is likely
to be ill-served in that respect, for the
people have no safeguard that the descen-
dants of , the philanthropic Carnegies,
Rockefellers, Cadburys, and Rowntrees
may not be as parsimonious as their pro-
genitors were charitable, or may not spend
their substance as injuriously as a Stan-
ford White or a Harry Thaw.
MISERY NOT SET-OFF BY LIBRARIES.
The value of libraries and other great
gifts to the nation is more than cancelled
by the abject misery for which the system
of profiteering is responsible. Religious
philanthropists distribute Bibles which
have been manufactured by sweated
Englishwomen who are subsidised by the
earnings of shame. Thus a famous
leader in the Sunday school movement was
once proved to draw the money he spent
upon his projects from a hideous chemical
process which blasted the bodies of the
men and women he employed, and whom
he did not protect from the ravages of their
ghastly employment, even as the law pre-
scribed.
PROFITS BEFORE PURITY.
Property owners who collect the rents
of brothels and places of assignation,


shareholders who derive their incomes
from the sale of drink and drugs, or from
businesses where the starvation rate of
wages forces women on the streets, are
powerful members of councils of social
purity, just as anti-gamblers are often
financially interested in sporting papers, or
temperance advocates are shareholders in
breweries.
PROFITEERING ?PATRIOTISMS
When this terrible European
broke out, violent Imperialists were dis-
covered to have been drawing dividends
from German army and navy contracts,
and to have facilitated Austrian, Turkish,
and Bulgarian military and naval offence
and defence. It was revealed, too, that
French and German business men had
mutually armed the ?enemy? against
their own compatriots, and even now Ger-
man-Americans, with pronounced German
sympathies, are making fortunes by selling
munitions to the Allies, whom they de-
clare intend to use them for the destruc-
tion of the Fatherland.
POSITION OF THE WORKERS,
The workers of the world are in this extra-
ordinary position: They create all capital,
and provide the whole of humanity with the
needs of war and peace. Yet they have no
control whatever over the production or dis-
tribution of the world 5 s wealth. While bread
is so scarce and dear that millions of the
proletarian classes are in dire want of it,
the energies of Labor are misdirected to pro-
ducing useless and injurious material. We
have, for instance, lands suitable for wheat-
growing devoted to the cultivation of opium,


tobacco and hops, and still other great areas
of fruitful earth lying fallow, awaiting the
investment of capital, which is diverted-into
wrong channels, in the production, let us
instance, of gin, tawdry jewellery, adul-
terated and injurious drugs, indecent post-
cards and books, hideous prints, ornaments,
picture palaces, adulterated food and cloth-
ing, gunpowder, and the munitions of war.
Labor is locked up in these harmful, anti-
social activities, and the community lives, to
a certain extent, upon its own destruction.
RESULTS OF THE SYSTEM.
The hideous results of this system are
plainly apparent. We can trace to the weak-
ness of the masses and the ruthless cupidity
of the few ages of human misery. When the
English peasantry were driven from the soil,
which was theirs by right, to make place for
the more profitable sheep* they plunged their
posterity into the conditions which have been
described with much passion and eloquence
by contemporary writers. This passage by
Disraeli indicates something of the truth:
?They come forth: the mine delivers its
gang and the pit its bondsmen; the forge is
silent and the engine is still. The plain is
covered with the swarming multitude: bands
of stalwart men, broad-chested and mus-
cular, wet with toil, and black as the children
of the tropics; troops of youth, alas I of both
sexes, though neither their raiment nor their
language indicates the difference; all are
dad in male attire; and oaths that men
might, shudder, at issue from lips born to
breathe words of , sweetness. Yet these are
to be, some are, the mothers of England!
But'can we wonder at the hideous
ness of their language when we remember


the savage rudeness of their lives? Naked
to the waist, ; an iron chain fastened to a
belt of leather runs between their legs, clad
in canvas trousers, while on hands and feet
an English girl, for twelve, sometimes for
sixteen, hours a day, hauls and hurries tubs
of coals up subterranean roads, dark, pre-
cipitous and plashy; circumstances that
seem to have escaped 'the notice of the So-
ciety for the Abolition of Negro Slavery.
Those worthy gentlemen, too, appear to have
been singularly unconscious of the suffer-
ings of the little trappers. See, too, these
emerge from the bowels of the earth! In-
fants of four and five years of age, many of
them girls, ; pretty and 'still : soft and ; timid,
entrusted' with the"fulfilment- of responsible
duties, and the nature of which entails on
them the necessity of being the earliest to
enter the mine and the latest to leave it.
Their labor indeed is not severe, for that
would be impossible, but it is passed in
darkness and in solitude. . . . Hour
after hour elapses, and all that reminds the
infant trappers of the world they have
quitted, and that which they have joined, is
the passage of the coal waggons for which
they open the air doors of the galleries, and
on keeping which doors constantly closed,
except at this moment of passage, the -safety
of the mines and the lives of the persons
employed in them entirely depends!? From
?Sybil, or The Two Nations,? 5 by the Earl
of Beaconsfieid, K.G.
THE MASTERS? HARVEST.
By the lives of strong men, suffering
women and hapless children stores of capi-
tal were at that time harvested for the mas-
ters, who employed it in purchasing the con-


trol of vaster and vaster holdings in the
earth?s raw material and in the lives of
human beings whose capacity for labor they
could exploit. The sweated girls and women
of Lancashire bought their masters not only
the ugly, pretentious mansions and expen-
sive equipages, the huge banquets and the
sports and the pleasures of idleness, but
cotton fields and slaves, cocoa and rubber
plantations, and rich stores of ivory, spices,
oil, herds of cattle, ships and railways.
In our own day the half-starved girls in
the Potteries, who practise prostitution to
eke out their wages; the nail and chain
makers of the Midlands, with their sunken
cheeks and flattened breasts, whose sickly
children play among the embers of their
mothers? forge; the pallid tailoresses and
shirt makers, the poor rag-pickers, sack-
sewers and matchmakers, the tiny child
workers, carding hooks and eyes and but-
tons, who earn their living betore they are
old enough to go to school, all purchase for
those who employ them the imposing mer-
cantile marine, the railways which are inter-
secting the globe, the new mills springing
up in distant Eastern lands, where the fac-
tory whistle now awakens the Japanese.
Chinese and Indian families, and calls
mothers and little children, young men and
maidens to the slavery of the machine.
THE WORKERS 5 HANDIWORK.
The workers?men, women and children ?
are feeding and clothing millions of fight-
ing men, and furnishing them with the
poison shells, the noxious gases, the bombs,
bayonets and hand grenades with which
they are destroying themselves ?for the
greater glory of God and the Empire. The


guns and the ships, from the time that the
quick timber stood in the forests and the
metals lay undisturbed in the earth to the
moment when the last screw was fixed, are
their handiwork. Wives toil from morning
till night to enable their husbands to accom-
plish this work, and mothers bear their chil-
dren to continue it. And all this they do
without understanding or regulating their
mighty power.
CONCRETE EXAMPLES.
Concrete examples are needed to drive
this meaning home. The Belgian people,
living industrious lives, have created wealth
for their employers, who were thus given the
means to secure and control rubber planta-
tions in the Congo and a vast supply of
helpless and ignorant laborers. Now the
terrible truth can be no longer hidden. The
wretched slaves are being murdered, muti-
lated and tortured. Women are compelled
to work on pain of seeing their children's
limbs struck off, their husbands 5 entrails
ripped out, or their daughters outraged and
mutilated before their eyes. In a few years
millions of these poor creatures have been
wiped out. The Belgian workers, by their
weakness, give this power into the hands of
those in whose interests such deeds are
done.
Again, the German workers, content to
blindly use their industry and skill at the
bidding* of others, have forged a dreadful
military machine. They made the poison
gases and the tremendous guns that have
shattered thousands of peasant homes, driv-
ing out the mothers and children to die of
cold and hunger; they constructed the tor-
pedoes which sent the passengers on the


4 ?Lusitania? to their watery graves, and both
the Zeppelins and the bombs which have
slaughtered innocent non-combatants.
The English workers, lovers of Democracy
and humanity as they profess to be, have
made by ?their own hands engines of death
no less terrible, which have been used for
purposes as- evil. It was they who enabled
British financiers to supply the Czar with
the means to drown the Russian agitation
for Constitutional Reform in blood; it was
they who enabled the Government to pursue
with so much cruelty, and for such base pur-
poses, the war in South Africa, and who
assist in holding in the grip of militarism,
that servant of greed, India and Egypt.
The American workers, too, pay for the
guns and the soldiers who mow down the
desperate, starving strikers, even to the little
girl machinists whose innate morality im-
pels them to seek a wage sufficient to live
upon without selling their bodies as well as
their labor.
The workers made the sickening carnage
in Europe possible, as they do the mas-
sacres of the Jews, the police tortures and
the famines in India, the conscription and
unspeakable atrocities of the military ma-
chines of France and Germany, the degrada-
tion of womanhood for profit?s sake?in
short, the slavery and exploitation of the
people all over the world.
THE WORKERS? DUTY.
It surely is the duty of the workers to
realise that they are not mere cogs in a
machine, but men and women capable of
reason, with a moral sense implanted in them
by God. In the past they have been used
by others for their own hurt, and to inflict


the crudest suffering- upon their fellows.
The war alone has destroyed the prospect of
all happiness for countless millions of the
human race, and for their posterity for
generations to come. Yet the united strength
of Labor could forbid wars, for ever, wipe
out poverty, raise womanhood from degrada-
tion, purify men, and flood the world with
beautiful and noble creations of the genius
of mankind.
WHAT OF THE FUTURE?
There is no prospect of any improvement
while conditions remain as they are. The
workers, blindly- controlled by commercial
agencies, will not be permitted to grow food
for the millions of hungry mouths, nor
to manufacture clothing for rag-covered
bodies, nor to build houses to accommodate
prosperous families, nor to make pleasant
and useful things for ,a happy and intelligent
humanity.
INURE A SED ? ARMAMENTS.
The price of metals is high, and it will
rise higher. High prices' stimulate produc-
tion, and work is most plentiful where good
profits can be obtained. Therefore, men
will descend into the bowels of the earth for
metals, which other men and women will
presently work up into armaments. New
guns, bigger and more destructive than the
old ones; new ships, more terrible than the
Dreadnoughts and super-Dreadnoughts of
our day; aeroplanes, bullets, shells, bombs,
with a power incalculably stronger and more
deadly than those which have broken so
many mothers? hearts in this great war, will
be stored up for the next.
The poor miner will do his part, and end
by tearing up his lungs with miners?


phthisis; the mother, rushing- to the small
arms factory, will leave her wailing", sickly
children to be poisoned by the purveyors of
tinned milk and adulterated food; the girls
whose sweethearts* bones are bleaching- on
the battlefields will make the bullets to ren-
der some other girls forlorn ? and all the
while the disinherited men will be drilling-
waiting to fall upon one another when the
word to spring is given.
THE ?INEVITABLE.?
Once the price of metals threatens to fall
through the accumulation of unused pro-
ducts, then the. Press, owned and controlled
by corporations of metal firms, financiers,
and other speculators in blood and iron, will
work up war scares, start hatreds, and in-
toxicate the people with a spurious patriot-
ism; then ambitious rulers and military
nabobs panting for martial glory and poli-
ticians plunging for popularity and the
sweets of office will let loose upon us, once
again, the horrors of war.
Democratic institutions and Courts of
Arbitration will fail us in that supreme hour.
If we starve ourselves, degrade women and
enslave children to make the means of deal-
ing death, and give the power of life and
death into the hands of soulless organisa
tions of financial and business men, there
is no fact on earth or in heaven so certain
as that death will be our portion.
LABOR'S IMPERATIVE DUTY.
Can we doubt, then, what are the rights
and duties of Labor? To gain control over
the wealth they create, and to employ their
mighty productive power only for the -welfare
and happiness of their human comrades is
not. only the right, but the imperative ?duty,'
of working men and women.


The Unity and Morality of
the Nation after the
Wan
ADELA PANKHURST.
The European war has been raging l for
more than two years, and the woe which
has engulfed mankind during those months
is beyond human imagination.
We dare not look into the future and try
to picture the world in which we shall be
living when the carnage is over.
We only listen to the prophets who tell us
what we wish to think, such as Mr. tt. G.
Wells, who believes that the mingling of the
blood of rich and poor on the battlefield will
teach men of the different nations true
brotherhood, and the Bishop of London,
who sees in this vast massacre of human
beings the one force that could call the
gilded youth of the British Empire from the
racecourse to the solemn business of wager-
ing men?s lives.
Against Mr. Wells we have, alas ! the sol-
diers? separation allowance and the widows?
and orphans?pensions granted by the richest
but most ungrateful country in the civilised
world to those whose dearest have fallen in
her service, and the spectacle of the weary
little children in poor, dirty garments,
crowding through the factory gates, and
dragging their wasted limbs to poverty-
stricken homes, and of those who strain


their young* muscles in the arduous labor of
the fields* ?-
' The Y Bishop?s : words - are .worth quot-
ing here, so strangely do they sound on the
lips of one devdted to the service of Him
who taught that by the power of LOVE
ALONE can men be; born again into the
life of the Spirit,
?Look first,Y says the Bishop, ?at the
new spirit in the nation. What has inspired
these rich young men who were spending
their lives on the golf links, the racecourse,
or the polo field to fling their lives and their
fortunes without a moment?s hesitation into
a cause which brings them nothing but in-
finite discomfort in any case, probably
wounds, often death? ?/. . With such
testimony on all sides, can we deny that
there is a bright side to war??
THE HEAVY TOLL.
It has been estimated that the war has
cost tfie human race already some 10 to 12
millions of men by death, wounds or dis-
ease, and at least three times that number
of women, children and old people have
been plunged into destitution, which, if it
can be credited, has reached in Germany a
stage where sheer starvation has caused
riots amongst the mothers who see their
babes dying for the food held up by the
ships of the British Navy.,
Our armies are to the extent of at least
90 per cent, drawn, not from the golf links,
the racecourse or the polo field, but from
the workman?s bench, the factory, the farm,
the mine or the office. They are armies of
men who "in times of peace work from morn-
ing till night, with hardly any remission,
'from early boyhood till the grave claims


them; whose wives are ill-clad, anaemic and
weary; and whose half-starved children
must all too soon for their undeveloped
brains and bodies fill their parents? places
as producers. Such men do not need the
spur of war to turn them from idle luxury;
their paramount needs are education, com-
forts, and leisure to enjoy the beautiful
things of life which their labor creates and
brings to the doors of the few who monopo-
lise them.
. Surely the Bishop . 'misinterprets ' his
Master when he says that -the spiritual re-
generation ?of the, idle-is, well bought at the
cost of death and misery to the masses who
toil.
A young man from the golf course, re-
sponsible for the activities of a , machine-
gun, might well, during a campaign, cause
the death of 100 common soldiers in the
enemy:forces?all .of whom were : .probably
skilled workmen and excellent husbands and
fathers.
It would seem that the young men of
great possessions, yearning for the fellow-
ship of the Lord, need no longer turn sadly
away because the command to ?Sell all thou
hast? 5 is too hard a one to obey. Our
Bishop has received a New Revelation. If
he brings to the Lord only these hundred
men turned to cold clay, and causes His
Heaven to be rent with the lamentations of
German widows, grief-stricken mothers and
fatherless little ones, the young soldier shall
enter into the company of the Redeemed.
WARS AND THEIR AFTERMATH,
But if we are to look for the bright side
of war, to the effect upon the personal char-
acter of the soldiers, judging by- past


experience, we shall find but a fitful gleam,
and then return again to unrelieved dark-
ness.
Never was our country more cruelly op-
pressed than after the Napoleonic wars, in
which so many young men learned the higher
virtues at the cannon?s mouth. Every form
of greed was practised by the rich upon the
poor, until parents were driven by sheer
starvation to sell their young children into
the slavery of the factories and the mines,
where many were beaten or worked to
death, or became, both boys and girls, the
victims of the unnatural lusts of their
brutal overseers, while on their labor men
grew rich and rose to positions of honor in
the State.
Wherever hunger and misery drove men
and women to revolt, they were violently
repressed by the soldiers, who charged the
wretched, unarmed crowds, and sabred
women and children as readily as they
faced the French in Europe. Pressed by
hireling gangs, half-starved, beaten and tor-
tured themselves, led by officers to whom
the common people seemed scarcely human,
the soldiers had ceased to be men with
hearts and brains, and were but hired cut-
throats, to whom bloodshed was a natural
business.
Sooner or later this war, too, will end,
and when it does the full effects will gradu-
ally make themselves felt. Materially they
will be terrible.
Thousands of men will flock back from
the battlefields to find their places in indus-
try filled by women or children at lower
wages. Scarcity of production will make
prices high, ruined territories will destroy


export trade and cause unemployment, the
interest on the war loans, will necessitate
heavy taxes. These are but cold words; in
human terms they mean homeless families
driven to the workhouse, where even the
holy tie between a mother and her children
is broken; they mean the herding of boys
and girls' into cheap factories and- sweat
shops, where every form of vice is rampant ;
they mean the slow murder of mothers and
babes by cold and hunger and the diseases
which privation and foetid slums must
breed ; they mean the sale of young girls
into prostitution and the luring of young
men into? careers of violence and crime;
they mean the watering with blood and
tears of the seeds of racial decay which have
choked and destroyed every nation which
lives by the sword. Most terrible of all is
the moral effect which hostilities on such a
scale will inflict upon all whom the war
touches. Immorality of the basest kind
flourishes On the soil of poverty, and when
millions are plunged into destitution, to
whom are added hundreds of thousands of
refugees from the invaded districts, the vir-
tue of women, on which depends the sanc-
tity of the home and the family, cannot fail
to break down to a deplorable extent.
These facts do not find their way into our
history books, but they are as potent to the
nations which war with one another as de-
feats or victories, and their effects are
deeper and more lasting. Where masses of
people are herded together, where young
girls and children are wandering without
guardians in a strange country, the white
slave traders find their best opportunity?
especially when millions of troops, quartered


in foreign countries and far from the civil-
ising influences of their homes and families,
provide an unparalleled market for their
human wares.
PLAGUE SPOTS.
If we take Cairo as the typical centre of
military occupation, and try to realise that
Europe and the Near East swarm with such
plague spots, we can only tremble for the
future of our race. Every vice and bestiality
known to human beings flourishes, in, that
ill-fated Egyptian city, and to dens of in-
famy, before which the imagination reels,
startled lads are lured, where, drugged by
doctored drinks and tobacco, they wake
to find ruin staring them, in the face.
Happy, then, are those whom a mer-
ciful bullet sends out of the hard
world of men who first drag the in-
nocent to ruin and then punish them with
cruel vengeance. For in disgraceful imprison-
ment, cut off from, friends, bereft even of
their mothers, who could forgive everything,
and in whose faithful love their torn souls
would find rest, these unhappy boys endure
the slow progress of their dread disease,
until death sets them free. These wretched
children sit with idle hands, and in their
eyes the agony of hell itself is reflected.
They are bruised, broken wrecks of man-
hood, starting at a voice, and weeping
when a few kind words pierce their poor
dulled hearts, that are sick with longing for
their, mothers? arms and the dear shelter of
their loving breasts.
The girls imprisoned in the public
brothels, or smuggled in unlicensed places,
are more wretched and far more numerous
than the wronged lads. Most of them have


been lured by false pretences, many have
been seized with violence and, carried away
into the terrible hells in which they now
live. If they have become reconciled to the
life, they can be no longer human, but lower
than the beasts; if they suffer shame and
pain, it should break our hearts to think of
them. What a commentary it is upon our
claim to be fighting for the honor of France
and Belgium!
These things are unutterably dreadful,
and our faces burn with shame when we
think of them; but still the full tale is not
told. r , '
MAN AND THE BEAST.
We have yet to remember the wicked
words of certain wealthy women and minis-r
ters of the gospel, for these people have
attempted, by covert praise of the ?war
babies,? whose fathers are fighting at the
front, to subvert that precious gift to hu-
manity, the morality of young women
(which teaches them that parentage
should be based on mutual love), and
they have confused the minds of lads who
enlisted with a respect for their own man-
hood and a sense of chivalry towards
women. They have gone so far as to form
societies to persuade young girls and sol-
diers into loveless marriages.
The very recruiting posters, which call
upon women to sacrifice their children to
save their own skins from possible danger,
show that women have already made a
moral descent. The war is calling out only
our worst and most animal passions, and
therein the danger lies.
In what does man differ from the beast ?
Is his body not built of like material, and


do his organs not function in the same
way? The brain of man, it is true, is im-
measurably above that of . an animal in
cunning and wisdom; but, were the lion ana
the tiger endowed with man?s intelligence,
they would be an awful scourge upon the
earth. But man has not intelligence only;
he has also a belief in love and justice as
everywhere stronger than hatred and ruth-
less self-seeking. Just in so far as men
and women obey the law of. love do they
rise above the beasts that perish. We see
now how the wonderful intelligence of man,
used for the construction of death-dealing
weapons, has. brought us to outrival the
jungle in its ruthless warfare. We can go
further along this road, until our own
wickedness and folly destroy us. That is
the present danger for the glorification of
bloodshed and the elevation of what is
called Patriotism, meaning not love of our
own people and a desire to see them happy,
but a restless craving to know that our flag
waves over the widest possible area, and
that the ?foreigner? has to bend before our
might.
A NEW COMMONWEALTH.
The pulpit teaching, that all sins are for-
given to a soldier who dies for country, is
an attempt to place servile obedience to the
Government under whose sway an individual
has been born or brought by force higher
than the better canons of morality
which guide the life of man. It is
an attempt to make greed, selfishness
and violence seem virtues when prac-
tised for the benefit of the group
of individuals to which we belong by acci-
dent. If once the different divisions of the


human race accept this, and men and
women plunge willingly into wars for
supremacy, and shed one another?s blood
without the compulsion of a master or a
combination of masters, the European
races will mutually destroy one another,
for hatred is deathly, as lovs is the regenera-
tion of life.
The door of life, is open, and
love beckons us to enter hand in hand
with our brother-men. We must begin
again, and let those who believe in justice
and love lay the foundations of a new world-
wide Commonwealth, in which the service of
all humanity is held to be the highest good.
So we shall have gained to us the happiness
which, since the dawn of human history,
every generation has sought with unnum-
bered tears, for it will be ours when, in the
loving service of others, we lose ourselves
and find that real self which can know no
sorrow.
To the Stranger.
The Socialist Party of Victoria was
founded in Melbourne in 1905 as the Social
Questions Committee, and later given its
present name. It stands for the Socialisa-
tion of Ownership and the Abolition of
Wage Slavery. These things accomplished,
the emancipation of the working-class will
be fact Instead of ideal.
The Socialist Party is affiliated with the
International Socialist Bureau at Brussels.
The Party is ?revolutionary? in the sense
that it seeks a New Economic Order and the


destruction of Capitalism. It is Capitalism
which holds the workers in bondage.
The Party advocates Industrial Unionism,
or the organising of the working-class in
harmony with industrial development rather
than by crafts or trades, and with the goal
of Working-Class Supremacy upon the basis
of the Class Struggle.
If you are ready to hear more about these
things the opportunity is at hand.
The Socialist Party owns and issues the
?Socialist.? You can purchase it.
The Socialist Party holds meetings every
Sunday Night at the Socialist Hall, 184 Exhibition
Street. You can attend them.
The Socialist Party runs propaganda meet-
ings on week nights and Sunday afternoons.
You can be in the crowd at them.
The Socialist Party conducts a Sunday
School at its hall every Sunday afternoon,
under an efficient corps of teache *s, whose
speciality is child culture, and who compre-
hend the message of science for childhood.
The Socialist Party has a library and
literature depot, and sells the world?s best
printed matter in the arena of sociology.
The Party has paid officers, but its proce-
dure is essentially Democratic. Monthly
general meetings are held, and an executive
committee meets once a week at least.
The membership is one shilling monthly
for gentlemen, and sixpence for ladies.
If you are interested, you can gain any
further information at the Party?s hall.
If you would be a factor in promoting
thought, in educational activity, in winning
better conditions, we shall be glad of your
co-operation.


The Claim of Socialism.
* I have looked at this claim by
the light of history and my own
conscience, and it seems to me so
looked at to be a most just claim,
and that resistance to it means noth-
ing short of a denial of the hope of
civilisation.
? This then is the claim :
?It is right and necessary that all
men should have work to do which
shall be worth doing, and be of itself
pleasant to do; and which should be
done under such conditions as would
make it neither over wearisome nor
over anxious.
?Turn the claim about as I may,
think of it as long as I can, I cannot
find that it is an exorbitant claim;
yet if society would or could admit
it, the face of the world would be
changed; discontent and strife and
dishonesty would be ended. To feel
that we are doing work useful to
others and pleasant to ourselves, and
that such work and its due reward
COULD not fail us! What serious
harm could happen to us then ? And
the price to be paid for so making
the world happy is revolution.?
?William Morris.

% The Socialist Party of Victoria looks forward J
Sg to the establishment of the Co-operative Com- ��
monwcalth, in which land and capital shall be
managed by those who use them in the interests
3* of the whole community, to the end that the pro- ja�

I & OBJECTS. J* I I
The Socialist Party of Victoria seeks to show
the people, and especially the workers, that this
Co-operative Commonwealth Is not only a beau-
tiful ideal, but that it is practically possible and
inevitably necessary. The Socialist Party of
Victoria also seeks to show the workers that the
present stage of industrial development compels
the workers,,,, to organise in unions according to
the industries In which they work, and the things
they produce, or the services they render, instead
of, as at present, organising only according to the
crafts or branches of industry in which they are
engaged and the tools which they use. By this
means they will prepare themselves for the man.
agcmeut of industry, and will concentrate their
strength for the struggle with the Capitalist class,
which can never cease till Socialism shall super-
sede Capitalism.

TEN COMMANDMENTS OF SOCIALISM
(Taught in Socialist Sunday School.)
1. Love your schoolfellows, who will
be your fellow-workmen in life,
2. Love learning, which is the food
of the mind; be as grateful to your
teacher as to your parents.
3. Make every day holy by good and
useful deeds and kindly actions.
4. Honour good men, be courteous to
all men, bow down to none.
5. Do not hate or speak evil of any-

up for your rights, and resist oppres-
sion.
6. Do not be cowardly, be a frienu to
the weak, and love justice.
7. Remember that all the good things
of the earth are produced by labour;
whoever enjoys them without worivhig

workers.
8. Observe and think in order to dis-
cover the truth; do not believe what is
contrary to reason, and deceive
yourself or others.
9. Do not think that he who loves
his own country must hate or despise
other nations, or wish for war, which is
a remnant of barbarism.

men will be free citizens of one father-
land, and live together as brothers in
peace and righteousness.
