YOUNG VICTORIA,
No. 2.
forking ot the (Ebimttien JUt,
John Carmichael, M.A.
Their Education Act was the best piece of good fortune, that
fell to the lot of the Francis Ministry. Under one designa-
tion and then another, their tenure of office was?as Govern-
ments fare jn this country ?unusually long, and tolerably
easy. During very nearly the whole of this period, when-
ever their coveted possession of the Treasury benches was
assailed, the piece de resistance , which stood them in time of
need, was generally the Education Act. The Education
question did right good service for the late Government. It
cannot surely, then, be impertinent to inquire?what signal
services have -they rendered to, what special benefits have
they conferred upon, a cause the adopting of which, at a
fortunate conjunction of circumstances, carried them into
power, and for a long time mainly helped to keep them in
possession 1
The country has now had nearly three years? experience of
the Act with which the name of Mr. Wilberforce Stephen has
the honour of being associated. In trying to estimate the
merit due to Mr. Stephen and his colleagues for their action
in this matter, it is right that we should not lose sight of
the fact that the Education Act of 1872 was, after all,
essentially of the nature of an outline ; and that its framers
scarcely ventured (being modest men) to claim the merit of
having given: form and substance to the wishes of the
country either with completeness or exactness. In certain
cases a Government may find it highly convenient to adopt
such a course; and when Parliament gives its sanction to a
Ministerial measure so incomplete in details, the fact may
be assumed as an indication of the confidence reposed by the
majority of the Legislative body in the administrative
capacity and political integrity of the Government. At
least this would be a creditable view for both parties to take
of such a case ?although, unfortunately, it is not always the
true solution. A plain and obvious question then is at once
suggested?has the sequel justified this confidence, or how
far 1 No Government was ever more patiently and con-


siderately dealt with by the public in a matter of great
national concern, than the late Government was treated in
regard to the administration of the Education Act by the
great body of the people of this country. It is true there
has been from the first honest and intelligent criticism of a
more or less unfavourable character; and that, too, emanating
from many of the true and tried friends of Education.
Still more is it unquestionable that the teachers, as a
body, have not been conciliated. The case here is very
much worse; and, in fact, the State schoolmasters of
Victoria may be described generally as having arrived at
a stage dangerously near to chronic disaffection. To
all objections to the Education Act, and especially
to the manner in which it has been administered, the
Government and their advocates relied chiefly on the
stock argument, that ??Time must be allowed ?o give the
Act a fair trial,? This is a very useful and plausible argu-
ment, and has always been a favourite resource of shifty
politicians. The time has arrived, however, when the Act
and the policy of its administrators must be examined, and
judged on their merits.
I laboured as assiduously as any man in this country in
preparing the way for a change upon the system, that had
been in force for several years at the time that Mr. Francis
formed his Ministry. Those of us, who had through good
and through evil report fought the good fight of Educational
Reform, were gladdened to observe that public feeling had
gradually, but surely, been brought round so as to demand a
change. Under these circumstances, it was the manifest
policy of any Government who would swim with the tide
to affect great zeal on the Education question. Mr. Francis,
Mr. Stephen, and their party did so, and they reaped the
reward of place and popularity. I have watched the whole
course of their Educational policy with solicitous and it
has been with much pain, that the conviction has foi?ced
itself, that that policy has resulted in comparative failure.
The reason for this I will now endeavour to set forth. For
this purpose it may be better to take the bull boldly by the
horns, and, without further preface, to lay down the three
following propositions, which I will then endeavour to estab-
lish in detail:?
1. That the Education question was taken up by the
Francis-cxm-Stephen party mainly as a political move, while
playing a hard game for office.
2. That the Education Act was, in form and substance,
copy-work, fragmentary, and incomplete.
3. That the manner in which the Education Act was
launched afforded the friends of Education grave cause for


apprehending that the Francis Ministry were unequal to the
task they had assumed, and that the subsequent manage-
ment of the Department of Education has been characterised
by lack of administrative capacity.
It is not my intention to discuss the question involved in
the first of these propositions at any length. How the
?party happened to take up the Education question, and how,
as the necessary sequence, they were obliged to bring in an
Education Bill, must, however, be briefly narrated, because
of the light thus thrown upon the rest of our subject. In
1867 the Royal Commission on Education published their
report. The practical outcome of this inquiry was Mr.
Higinbotham?s Education Bill, which was read in the
Legislative Assembly the same year. As the Government,
of which he was a member, declined to share the responsi-
bility of his patriotic efforts, Mr. Higinbotham?s Bill was
numbered among the sacrificed innocents of the session.
Mr. Higinbotham?s labours, however, materially helped to
excite public interest in the question; so, when the third
M?Culloch Ministry was formed, Educational talk was very
much the fashion, and, on the eve of the dissolution of
Parliament at the end of 1870, the Government favoured
the country by the publication of a projected Education Bill.
When the newly-elected House met four months afterwards,
the Yice-regal Speech declared?? The subject of Public
Instruction stands foremost in importance,? &c., &c. The
head of that Government expressed good views on the
question, but it happened that his zeal for the diffusion of
knowledge was of a neutral tint. His Ministry lacked the
courage of their opinions ; they would risk nothing for the
cause, and so they gained nothing. They elected to quit
office before their views were put to a practical test, leaving
to the country and to their successors, as a legacy, their good
intentions. Meanwhile, the question was working its way,
and, in the public mind, was daily assuming a more definite
and tangible form. The current of public opinion now set
in strongly in a direction which the Duffy Ministry were
unable to avail themselves of in navigating the ship of
State. The pilot owed his position to a party that is sup-
posed to be very much guided by shepherds; and the shep-
herds have not yet adopted the nineteenth century pro-
gramme of social progress. It is but fair, however, to add,
that a moiety of the Government were quite as advanced in
their views on Education as their opponents. In the case of
the pilot there was this real difficulty, and the Opposition
availed themselves of it to the fullest in the course of their
strenuous efforts to regain the blissful seats. Ten months
after the Duffy Ministry had gained these seats the Parlia-


mentary session of 1872 opened, on the last day of April.
It soon became apparent that a large proportion of members
felt sorely aggrieved on account of some impolitic utterances
in which the head of the Government had indulged during
the recess. Now was the time to play the game of the Outs
and the Ins. The hour had arrived, and Mr. Francis and
Mr. Stephen deemed themselves to be the men. Sir James
M?Culloch was not in the country, and Mr. Higinbotham
was not in the House. So no time was to be lost. The next
day Mr. Francis moved as an amendment upon the Yice-regal
speech?? We regret that the subject of Public Instruction
is not included among the matters which
your Excellency?s advisers propose to submit for the
consideration of Parliament.? The debate on this amend-
ment extended over a fortnight, and it may be safely asserted
that a more inconsequential style of debating an important
question was never indulged in, even in a Victorian
Parliament?and that is saying a great deal. Now, after a
lapse of more than three years, I have been reviving my
impressions of this debate by a perusal of Hansard , and
confess that the impression one gets by so doing is chiefly of
a ludicrous sort. Member after member rise in tiresome
succession, to give vent to their over-bui'dened feelings. Most
of those who rise, ostensibly to support the amendment,
generally harp on one elegiac refrain?? Oh that ,he
stumped the country, and told the people he would look over
our heads to them !? To some extent the storm had spent
itself in this manner, for, after the division, the Outs were
still the Outs. Many no doubt felt, when it came to a vote,
that the matter of the amendment ought to serve a higher
purpose than the mover had in view, and also were conscious of
the want of relevancy of the arguments adduced. The loss of
the amendment was a gain to the cause 6f Education. The
Cashel Hoey appointment case enabled Mr. Francis to make
a more successful move. The firing of the blunderbuss from
the hands of Mr. Ramsay, after being loaded and primed by
Francis & Co., dislodged Mr. Duffy and his following?not
without a desperate and undignified stniggle on the part of
the defeated Ministry, before relinquishing the position.
The merits of this special case of the exercise of Government
patronage are quite apart from the purpose of the present
inquiry; but if the reader will be pleased to note this as an
illustration of the jealous care with which members watch
over the distribution of the loaves and the fishes, I shall
have occasion to adduce the fact by-and-bye.
Mr. Francis had now attained the object of his ambition,
just at the time when the question, that excited the greatest
public attention, was Education. There was no occasion here


of drifting about in search of a policy. An important
question upon which to initiate legislation was ready-made
to the hands of Mr, Duffy?s successor. The question, too,
was one which Mr. Francis and his party were completely
committed to attempt a solution of. In the new Ministry
there was no one who could be pointed out as distinguished by
special study or knowledge of the subject. Some of the more
prominent members of the new Cabinet had hitherto been
distinguished by their opposition to the principles of the
measure which they were now going to adopt. But now
eight gentlemen had agreed for a time to maintain the out-
ward semblance to a happy family, and to avail themselves
of the popular tide, as well as to redeem their pledge by
dealing with the Education question. When the Francis
Ministry had been three months in office, Mr. Stephen
introduced the promised Education Bill. The members of
the Government professed to have devoted much earnest
thought and labour upon this measure. As it came before
the House, however, the internal evidence of laborious days
and midnight vigils would be rather difficult to detect. For
five preceding years much time, labour, and ability had been
directed to the work of drafting Education Bills. There
had been Mr. Higinbotham?s Bill, singularly clear and com-
prehensive, as Victorian Acts of Parliament go. There was
the Bill of the M?Culloch Ministry, which had been left as
a legacy to their successors. Mr. Stephen had a chief and
some colleagues, who would naturally be presumed to claim a
family interest in these projected Bills. But while availing
himself of the labours of predecessors in the same effort, he
hit upon an easier expedient, or?what was perhaps nearer
the truth?he chanced to stumble upon a track, which some
pioneers had lately been opening up. I presume the reader
has heard something of the Birmingham Education League,
and of the energetic labours of Mr. Dixon, M.P., in con-
nexion with the same. The League had worked, in clear
and practical arguments, the theoretic principles of free,
secular, and compulsory Education. These views having to
a considerable extent permeated England, reached our shores
in time to affect public opinion, when the Ministry were
essaying to frame a scheme. I think Ballarat was the first
place that at a public meeting adopted the three leading
principles of the Birmingham platform. In colloquial phrase,
the thing took. This was a happy relief to Mr. Stephen,
who, there is too much evidence, had but a slender and
superficial grasp of his subject. The essential elements of
a Bill were tacked together, and rigged-out with the adopted
three cardinal points of Free, Secular, and Compulsory Edu-
cation. A Minister of Public Instruction was substituted


for the Board of Education. When these four points had
been embodied in the circumlocutory language, in which
Parliamentary lawyers delight to involve legislative enact-
ments, and two or three additional clauses distributed here
and there to impart a little bulk, Mr. Stephen?s Bill was
completed.
A dangerous custom had recently been introduced in con-
nexion with Land legislation of passing half-measures, and
leaving the remainder to be provided for, according to the
Minister?s judgment, by Regulations. Mr. Stephen?as it
was not his nature to impose upon himself any burden that
he could find an expedient for avoiding?readily adopted
this device. He therefore got over much trouble and
difficulty by inserting a clause, giving power to deal after-
wards with some very important matters in the form of
Regulations.
This clause did not commit the Minister or the Goveim-
ment to any policy. This greatly simplified the task of
carrying an important measure through the Legislature.
Such a device may, in some sort, argue the adroitness of the
politician; but it as certainly offers a presumption of the
absence of statesmanship. However, when it comes to a
man?s turn to be called upon to initiate legislation on a
subject, the details of which he neither knows nor feels any
strong personal interest in, is it not a mark of discreet
judgment to cover his weak points by a Regulations
Clause, when he meets with a facile Parliament 1
With one important exception the conspicuous faults of
the Bill lay in the omissions. The teachers, and everything
that affected them personally, were utterly overlooked, except
that one clause conveyed them over absolutely to the Minister,
just as the serfs in the Middle Ages passed with a landed
estate. It was true, that Clause 20 held out a prospect to
teachers more or less tempting; but the pleasing perspective
is still in the unsubstantial region of promises; so that the
clause now appears too much in the light of a sop, that had
been thrown down to disarm opposition.
Here I may be permitted to submit one or two con-
clusions, to which much study has conducted me. In
Education the most important matter to deal with is the
teaching; the most important matter involved in the
teaching is?the teachers. The character and status of its
schoolmasters may generally be taken as the measure of a
nation?s enlightenment. I beg the reader?s special attention
to these premises, for if their position be granted, the
progress of this investigation will present ample matter for
their application.
To resume our comments on the Bill, its treatment of


the teachers was both contemptuous and shabby. The sub-
sequent conduct of the Government, and the administration
of the Education Department, serve only to augment the
force of this impression. The teachers did make some move-
ment to secure a tangible recognition of their interests, and
Mr. Stephen was always ready to meet all demands with an
abundant supply of fair promises. No teacher would be a loser
financially by the new arrangements. No man had a higher
appreciation of the value of their services. He and Mr.
Francis, and, in short, all his colleagues, were animated with
the one wish of securing the comfort and happiness of that
highly meritorious class. No profession was more honour-
able, no sphere of action more exalted, than that of the
public schoolmaster. The position would be made so
attractive that the profession would absorb the pick of the
rising talent of the country. He and his colleagues were
most anxious to secure the lasting gratitude of the teachers,
and it would, in every sense, be for the interest of the latter
to support and second the efforts of the Government. Let
them only have confidence in the honourable and liberal
intentions of the Government, and they would not be dis-
appointed. In such dulcet strains as these the Attorney-
General piped, and the schoolmasters were fooled. Half the
fault was their own ; but on that hereafter. The teachers
have now been taught, at the cost of great sacrifice both
of liberty and incomes, to be chary of promises and fair
speeches made under pressure of political exigencies. Having
regard to the interests of Education, no policy can be more
short-sighted than to depress the teachers. There are
analogous cases in most professions illustrative of this. No
mere system of rules and regulations, however good, can
produce an efficient system of Education, any more than rules
and regulations make efficient armies or navies. In the
former, as in the latter, the first and most important con-
sideration is the men ?not merely the chiefs, but the com-
mon body. Take the greatest names among men who have
attained success in war, and it will be generally found that
they were masters of the art of conciliating their soldiers,
and that that was mainly the secret of their successes. In
the practice of war and in the arts of peace, in the case of
soldiers and in the case of schoolmasters?get hold of the
right material in the first place, then handle it well, and
treat it generously.
Of the three propositions which I laid down at the begin-
ning of this inquiry, I trust two of them?if not yet in
every point established?have gained force and clearness as
the discussion has advanced. The discussion of the third
question, from the nature of the case, is fitted to throw so


much light on the other two, that, in order to avoid repe-
tition, much that is pertinent to the matter of what has
preceded I prefer to adduce in my comments on the
administi?ation of the new Act.
That the Act was so far a great step, no one can have
greater pleasure in acknowledging; for what I fought for
and suffered for during years then became law. The bonds
that had so long and so disastrously held Education in thral-
dom to ecclesiasticism were cut asunder. Let that be a work
done for all time. Victoria led the way in a manner that
has stirred other colonies to follow her example. Already
Queensland and South Australia have quite recently taken
a leaf from our Act. It was also a remarkable coincidence,
that the same year, that witnessed the passing of the
Victorian Act, was fruitful in Educational reforms in other
countries. Prussia and Scotland had their Educational
systems reorganised the same year. In both countries the
leading feature of the new schemes was the complete sever-
ance of the schools from the churches. We have been
moving on in what may be termed?Educationally?very
good company. The Victorian Government, whose good
fortune it was to gather the ripe fruit, have not yet ceased
singing paeans in celebration of their services. They cer-
tainly reaped where they did not sow; and this was their
chief merit in connexion with that business.
In contemplating the various phases of human nature
which the observation and study of men?s actions present
for reflection, a close observer will frequently be struck by
many instances of strong analogy that are to be found in the
behaviour of some of the lower animals and his own species.
In the course of my bush adventures I acquired some curious
information about the habits of that singular variety of the
canine species, the dingo. The dingo is not remarkable for
fleetness, courage, or sagacity. Though claiming kindred
with a family that can boast of several noble branches, the
dingo is not a noble brute?very much otherwise. He is
endowed, however, with great powers of consumption, and
has a rare faculty of availing himself of the agency of nobler
animals for his own ends. He is fully alive to the fact that
greyhounds and deerhounds far surpass him in running down
kangaroo. When the hounds?as frequently happens ?go
out on a run to do a little hunting on their own account, the
dingoes see their chance, and following in great numbers, as
soon as the hounds have killed, the dingoes appropriate the
lion?s share of the booty. These shrewd self-seekers have
been known to prowl about stations at night, and to wheedle
out the hounds to join in hunting expeditions in quest of
kangaroos. But when the game is run down, the dingoes


seize the quarry, without any regard to the claims of their
swift-footed ally. In the course of historical investigations
I find?alas for human nature !?this picture of the dingo
continually suggested, some way or other. I find the image
of the dingo, also, always called up, and mixing with the
gentlemen who reaped the honours that resulted from the
agitation for an Education Act. I should be sorry to fix on
Mr. Francis the imputation of being more of a dingo chief
than some of his contemporaries; for dingoes are a numer-
ous lot among Victorian bipeds. The history of dingoism
is a very old and a very long one. The noblest literary
monument of the genius of antiquity has for its subject-
matter the wrath of the swift-footed Achilles, because
of the conduct of dingo Agamemnon. The story of the
Iliad of Homer is, the resentment of the fleetest and bravest
hound of his time at the greed of a dingo, that clutched
the prey, which the former had run down. I hope that Mr.
Francis and his friends, who sacrificed themselves for the
public good, and the charge of the money-chest, will not feel
very much hurt, because I have associated them with Aga-
memnon, king of men, the chief of the renowned confederate
host that beleaguered Troy,
Having so far narrated the history of the passing of the
Act, it now devolves upon me to make the best attempt I
can at an investigation of the manner in which the Act has
been administered. ?Is the honourable member prepared
to take the responsibility of his action V? This has become a
favourite expression within the last few years in the
Assembly; and this year it has been the stock text in the
composition of homilies for the conversion of the member
for East Bourke Boroughs. When the member for the
Wimmera opposed the Government Education Bill, Mr.
Francis lectured him down with the same text. Suppose
we put it to Mr. Francis himself, and to his friends, with
another application?Did they take the responsbility of their
action, and in what sense h Were they fully prepared to
carry out a new polity in harmony with the new Act ? As
I have already shown, a dingo Ministry could then pass an
Act. To establish a new and improved system, on a sound
and workable plan, that was the responsibility of their action.
If the Government of Mr, Francis and Mr. Kerferd were
successful in this respect, they established their claim to
public confidence and support; if they failed, then their case
looks very like that of persons who are convicted on the
charge of obtaining goods under false pretences.
Whenever it is proposed to pass a law for the abolition
of an existing institution, it is necessary to establish reasons
that are adequate to the proposed change. One heavy in-


dictment against the old system was, not that it had failed
in providing the means, such as they were, for educating the
youth of the country, but that it was powerless to compel
parents to give their children the benefits of the Education
that was provided. We insisted that, in our country at all
events, every youth should have a certain modicum of school
instruction, before he was allowed to take his share in the
battle of life. In a community where every male adult had,
presumably, a direct voice in determining the polity and the
laws to which all would be subjected, the phrase?? We must
educate our masters,? was no mere figure of speech, but it
assumed the reality of stern necessity. So there was no
avoiding the inclusion of a Compulsory clause in the Bill. To
Mr. Stephen, moreover, it was a very helpful clause, so far
as the labour of getting the Bill through the House was
concerned. For political reasons, at least, it was resolved to
make the Education to be given in the public schools free and
secular. Then, in support of the free and secular clause, it was
argued that, if a law was passed compelling a man to send
his children to school, it would not be equitable to make a
call upon him for school fees, and that it would be a violation
of our notions of toleration to teach religion by compulsion.
The Compulsory clause did yeoman service in pulling through
the two others. When the Bill became the Act, the services
of the Compulsory clause was no longer required by the
Minister. When the Act came in force, this clause de-
manded the best services of a good administrator. Such
services it did not receive. It had served a purpose; and
what was before so serviceable was now on the hands of the
Government?a white elephant. When the Act came into
force, it was very pleasant work for the Government to have
the charge of a new Department, which commenced opera-
tions by giving people for nothing, what they had before to
pay for. Politicians, when in office, like such work. The
enforcing of the Compulsory clause, on the other hand, was
not a pleasant duty, but was, on the contrary, a very
difficult task, and one demanding energy, judgment, and
firmness, not to say knowledge. Mr. Stephen never made
the slightest effort to grapple with the difficulty at all.
That gentleman?s dexterity in evading a difficult under-
taking was surpassed only by his facility of explaining away
inconvenient statements. With his usual fluency, he was
always ready, with some reason or other, for allowing this
part of the Act to exist only on paper. There would not
be sufficient accommodation for all that were voluntarily
flocking to the State-schools, if the Act were enforced. It
was desirable to wait until it might be seen whether there
would be any need of resorting to coercive measures; per-


haps such a course might not be required at all. It was
necessary to make the schools as attractive as possible, in
order to attract a better class of children, as it would be good
policy to crush the majority of private schools. For this
reason, it would be as well to let the neglected children alone
for a little. By shallow subterfuges of this sort the diffi-
culty was pushed aside as much as possible.
After much cogitation, let us suppose, the Department
concocted a scheme for grappling with the gutter-children
difficulty. The Gospel Mission Hall, situated in a lane off
Little Bourke-street, was rented, in order to form the State-
school of that exceptional locality. A gentleman with
special qualifications for such work was put in charge of the
school, at a salary double the rate of that of the teachers of
other schools. There was also an assistant and two pupil-
teachers, making, in all, a staff of four teachers. Some of the
leading features of the Ragged School system were also copied;
and contributions, in the shape of substantial cheques, were
obtained from generous citizens. With all this liberality, the
scheme has not yet been a success. The first head-master lately
resigned on account of his health, and at that time the average
attendance had fallen below fifty. From personal examination
and visits to this school, one of which was made to-day,
I have made myself practically conversant with its working.
I was glad to find the numbers showing a steady increase.
The new master is a young man, possessed of zeal, energy,
and judgment; and all he requires, to make the school a
success, is the enforcement of the Compulsory clause. The
establishment of this school, as it now turns out, has served
a purpose quite different from what it was intended. Its
history proves most conclusively the absolute necessity of
rigidly enforcing the Compulsory clause. It was also found
that an attempt to enforce the clause in the interest of this
school only tended to diminish its numbers, because the
same action had not been taken in the adjoining school
districts.
It seems a very extraordinary proceeding, that when an
Act was passed with a great flourish of trumpets, the leading
feature of which was to be Compulsory Education, the
Department in its helplessness should have recourse to a
clumsy and very expensive imitation of the Ragged Schools.
Moreover, the Department was acting on the assumption,
that there were no parents, who neglected the Education of
their children, to be found anywhere but in the lanes of
Little Bourke-street. To be consistent, the Government would
require to establish similar schools in nearly every school dis-
trict in the colony; and then they could be filled, with the class
for which they were intended, only by the enforcement of the


law. In regard to the class under discussion, the truth is,
the Educational Administration has been a complete failure.
I have been at great pains to arrive at the facts regarding
the conditions and requirements of the locality, that has been
favoured with the crude experiments of the Department of
Education. The results of my investigations leave no doubt
in my mind, that the proper enforcement of the law would
increase the attendance at this school by something like 100
per cent. The experiment has been useful, but not in the
manner Mr. Stephen intended ; even if he had any serious
intention in the matter : I am rather in doubt that he had.
As the Government had no serious intention of dealing in
earnest with the negligent parents by the only effectual
method, it was necessary to take up an evasive policy; and
this policy has now no positive results to offer, but the
Gospel Hall School. The principle of Education being free
has its value; the principle of Education being unsectarian
has its value; the principle, that no children should be
suffered to grow up illiterate, has its value. Are these three
principles essentially co-ordinate, and each of equal value 1 I
would venture to submit that the first and second can be
resolved into questions of expediency simply ; and that the
circumstances of one country may render their adoption in a
general system of Education practicable ; and in another,
unnecessary, or even impracticable. I have already noticed
that Prussia and Scotland got new Education Acts the same
year, that Mr. Stephen passed his Act. In Prussia and Scot-
land fees exist in all the public schools. In Scotland, as in
Prussia, though the schools have now no connexion with sects
or churches, a certain amount of religious teaching is still
maintained. But in the matter of compulsory attendance,
the law is strictly enforced, and not, as with us, allowed to
remain a dead-letter. Take the following cases reported in
the Scottish newspapers lately; ??In the Sheriff Court,
Glasgow, 12th May, 1875, Patrick Hanlon was sentenced to
14 days? imprisonment for failing to send his children to
school.? ?Glasgow Herald. I glean from the Scotsman , 7th
June, that, in the Sheriff Court, Edinburgh, Catherine Gal-
hoolie received a sentence of 14 days for a like offence. Our
successive Governments would appear to be afraid of dealing
with the Pat Hanlons and Kate Galhoolies of this colony.
whose number is legion.
In Scotland, in 1874, 6339 summonses were issued to
parents who had neglected their children?s Education. In
the great majority of cases this was sufficient, as only 155
had to be proceeded against, of whom 109 were convicted.
The knowledge that the law will be enforced has already
produced the most happy results.


The cheerfulness with which the public has responded to
the call made upon its tax-bearing patience in support of
Education is, to my mind, a very encouraging symptom. I
rejoiced to observe the general readiness with which the
novel experiment of Free Education was accepted, especially
as those, who were responsible for the change, maintained that
that was the price at which a compulsory system could be
secured. The country received the Government proposal as a
kind of quid pro quo settlement. The quid has been regu-
larly paid, but the Government, as yet, has utterly neglected
to secure the pro quo. What a curious contrast, the conduct
of public business frequently offers, to the method pursued
by our public men in the conduct of their private affairs!
Most of us will be glad to see Mr. Francis among us again.
If those acting for him were found, upon his return, to have
managed some of his numerous interests after the manner
in which his Government managed this matter, don?t you
think, my reader, that some very forcible language would be
made use of in a certain office in King-street 1
For the State to relieve parents of their responsibilities, and
for the State to see that parents discharge their responsibili-
ties, are two distinct and essentially different things. Free
Education is embraced in the former, and Compulsory Educa-
tion in the latter of these State functions. I would not, at
present , raise a finger against our free system ; indeed, much
could be said in favour of its extension, until it embraced all
grades of Education. No logical reason can be advanced for
drawing an arbitrary line, as at present, and saying, ? Thus
far, and no further.? Strong arguments can be advanced
both in support of free instruction, and also in favour of
making parents contribute to the expense of Education.
In support of free instruction, it was argued, with much
force, that as many of the children must, if they attend
school at all, be on the free list, there would be an
invidious distinction in every school between two classes
of children. The abolition of fees is a practical way of
meeting this difficulty. The argument on the other side,
so far as I know, has not yet been set forth in a complete
form, fully developed?as least, so far as the popular treat-
ment of a public question is concerned. In the order of
nature, we find that the rearing of offspring exerts a power-
fully beneficial influence upon the parents. This is a fact in
nature, which operates as effectually in the history of the
lower animals, as in man. The lower animals have had their
faculties educated in a gre&t measure by the necessity of
providing for their young. It is the same with human
beings; the parental relation brings out prudence, cultivates
habits of self-control and frugal industry, and frequently


brings into play a fertility of resources, in encountering
difficulties, that otherwise might have remained dormant.
Then the question arises?ls it desirable that the State, by
its action, should take away or diminish parental responsi-
bility 1 It is just possible that, after this argument has been
fairly set forth and allowed time to work, our present
partiality for free instruction will be considerably modified. It
is also to be hoped that it will be more clearly seen, that it is
more the function of Government to take care that there shall
be no neglect of their responsibilities on the part of parents.
Let me now endeavour to lay before the reader a short
statement of the teachers? case. I have already described
the manner in which their position and prospects were treated
by Mr. Stephen, when he was piloting the Government
scheme through Parliament. It was always represented to the
teachers,-that the change would not entail any pecuniary loss
upon them ] but that, in addition to suffering no loss in this
respect, many contingent advantages to them would result.
The other advantages have not yet been realised. The
teachers are now paid much worse than in 1872. The
Education Department has repeatedly tried to twist and
torture facts, so as to harmonise with a contrary assertion.
I will present a short summary of facts, and leave the reader
to decide on the merits of the dispute between the teachers
and the Department. I will make an analysis of ?Report
of the Minister of Public Instruction for the year 1873-4? ?
the ground-work for furnishing data. This report contains
tabulated statements of incomes of all teachers in schools
connected with the Department, These tabulated columns
are constructed on such a beautifully complicated system,
that the general reader requires the services of an expert to
guide him through the maze of figures, &c. Let us take all
those who were head teachers in 1872, and also in 1874. In
Appendices I. and 11. these are found to be 1097. No less
_ rr i * PQI *7A .
than 676 have been losers, the average loss being �3l 9s. 7d.;
421 have acquired a slight advantage, but that has resulted
chiefly from having their labours greatly increased. The
following table presents a summary view of losses and gains:

It will be observed, that with the class under �lOO only
there is a clear gain. The Regulations fix the salary, for an
attendance under 20, at �BO, and, with an average under 30
at �lOO. This is the whole extent of the improvement
effected by the new system. A favourite expression of Mr,
Stephen was ?To level-up those who were meritorious, but
badly paid, and to level down those who were overpaid and
not meritorious.? As the levelling-up of the meritorious
stopped at �lOO, surely Mr. Stephen must have pencilled
since under the above?? This was a goak.? The table
above does not show the great additional labours, that have
been imposed upon the teachers, and hence, but a part of
t ieii losses is here exhibited. To make the case clear to
the leadei, take the case of a teacher whose numbers were
in 1872, 100, and in 1874, 150, and his loss of income �2O
i.e., he is paid �2O less for teaching 150 children than
formerly for teaching 100. This sum is not a fair estimate
ot his loss. A more equitable estimate would be the excess
of the calculated value of 150 pupils at the former rate
o\ei his present income. I find, as a general rule, that,
every 50 formerly paid the teachers as well as every 90 or
100 does now. By the general suppression of private
schools, by the amalgamation of two or more schools into
one, and by an increase in the total attendance, the
low remuneration of teachers is not so apparent to the
public; but probably the amount of money distributed
among the teachers of Victoria last year, fell short of
what was received in 1872, by �100,000! I hardly
think, however, that this result is a subject for much con-
giatulation, or a matter for Victorian blowing. It was a
sorry affair to make political capital out of a change, that
brought straitened circumstances to many a fireside. To
illustrate what has been said above about the altered rate of
remuneration, I will take the tables appended to the report,,
oi a few cases. At page 4, we come upon the first school in
the Melbourne circuit. This school had 611 in 1874, and
267 in 1872. This extraordinary increase brought the
master �2O. In page 6 two head-masters show a gain, but
very far from being in proportion to the increase of their
schools. The one at Clunes shows a rise to 442 from 152, or
threefold. The gain to the master for an increase of 200 per
cent, is 30 per cent. The Echuca school (p. 7), with 187 pupils,
was just worth �l7 more than when the numbers were 78,
�l7 for an increase of 240 per cent.! The Heathcote master
teaches 265 children for �l4 less than he was formerly called
upon to instruct 130 for. The Pleasant Creek school had
douole work imposed upon it, and with a loss to the teacher.
Ihe master of the Seymour school was called upon ta


instruct 114 children for �l3 less than he derived in 1872
for the instruction of 44. The good Christian doctrine, that
the labourer is worthy of his hire, is surely violated in cases
like these. Instead of exhausting the 90 pages of tables,
I have confined myself, in the cases just now cited, to a few
consecutive pages; but they tell a similar story to the end.
Cases of still greater hardship remain to be noticed. Of the
seven classes into which the teachers are arranged, a page or
two back, it will be observed that all the teachers in the
two highest classes are, without a single exception, losers.
The average loss to the masters of the seventh class is �202.
Take a case with which lam familiar, that of Mr. S. This
gentleman?s school in 1874 yielded him an income that was
less by �5l than a half of his salary in 1872. His former
income, which might be termed high, but deservedly so, was
the result of uutiring industry, and eminent professional
ability. To take away from such a man considerably more
than a half of what he justly earned, is neither more nor
less than committing robbery by a Departmental regulation.
It would be some satisfaction, if we were to find, that
the serious losses of the head-masters were, even in part,
balanced by an increase in the salaries of their assistants. It
will be found, however, that the latter have generally suffered
as severely under the process of cutting down, as the former
have. For illustrative cases, I will take the nearest school
to where lam just now writing. In this school, I find the
senior male assistant?s salary was cut down from �376 to
�lB3. This was a young man of eminent promise, and his
name is familiar to candidates for matriculation by his excel-
lent little manuals. I have said was; he is now no more.
He sunk under the hopeless efforts to raise himself, and
maintain an aged father and his mother. The next to him
was deprived of �lB2 a-year, and left with barely enough to
find food and clothes for himself alone. One of the ladies in
this school suffered a loss of �126 a-year, and another lady?s
salary was cut down from �lB9 a-year to 325. a week. I
hope she is grateful for small mercies. This is pretty good
pruning for one school. But what need to multiply
examples 1 It?s a shabby business throughout.
In spite of the explanations of Mr. Stephen and his suc-
cessor Mr. Mackay, people came to believe that the Govern-
ment were not dealing justly with the teachers. The reader
will remember that Mr. Higinbotham, last year, brought the
subject of the teachers? losses under the notice of the House,
in the form of a resolution. As there were indications that
a majority of the House would support the views of the
mover of the resolution, the Government took steps to
obviate a vote, which would be tantamount to a censure on
their policy.


The Minister of Education, Mr. Mackay, promised that a
vote of �25,000 would be placed on the estimates, in order
to give teachers some compensation for their losses. It
is more than a year since the Government came to this
arrangement with the House ; but, as yet, it has been only a
promise without a fulfilment. This is very much of a piece
with the manner in which the same class have been treated
during the last three years. The action, that had been taken
in their behalf, seemed only to animate Mr. Mackay with
resentment against the much-enduring schoolmasters. He
took a mighty?(l was going to say, oath,) well, pledge?that
he would be even with some of them. Residences, for the
most part of a very humble character, constituted a part of
the emoluments of many of the country teachers. One of the
last acts of Mr. Mackay?s administration was to impose a good
rack rent upon as many of the teachers as were in the enjoyment
of scholastic cots. Here was another instance of putting a
hand in a man?s pocket by a Departmental regulation. On
many of these residences the teachers had laid out consider-
able sums of money, and now (after the very worst examples of
the middle-men system in Ireland) they were asked a rent
enhanced by their own improvements. In the matter of the
compensations, the Educational Department has simply
laughed at the Legislative Assembly, Have a majority of
that body any spirit left in them 1 The question may be
put at the present time for other reasons than this.
I have now, after much careful inquiry, and, I trust, with
fairness, stated the teachers? case in regard to one of their
grievances : some other grievances, that have been detailed
to me, I propose to discuss on a future occasion. Here I
would take leave to impress upon, and remind teachers, how
much their case depends upon themselves. Let them
reflect, as the members of a profession that implies a less or
greater proficiency in historical research, that a nation has
mainly to depend upon itself, for the position it attains to;
that everything, that is really most valuable in the way
of political rights, and civil or religious liberties, is
always the result of a struggle. Much the same is the case
with the several classes into which a nation resolves
itself: each class, rank, or profession occupies the
position its members have made for it. Hence it is, that
one man frequently occupies a position of social con-
sideration beyond his own merits, by the accident of the
guild into which he has gained admission, that is, by
entering a certain profession; while another man, every way
superior to the former, enjoys small social consideration,
because he belongs to a profession, or class, that is depressed.
The history of the profession, that is held in high esteem,


will show, that the position was gained at first by its
members fighting for it. In such cases, it has been found
that one or two men, however competent, can effect but
little, unless their efforts are seconded and supported by the
members of the class, in whose behalf the struggle is carried
on. Both the positions, I have just now advanced, will be
found illustrated by the history of most champions for an
order or class, how diverse soever the conditions and periods
might be; whether our instance be that of Hildebrand, of
John Hampden, or even of Joseph Arch. Like the rest of
the world, teachers must learn to fight for their own rights
themselves : they must learn to act in disciplined array ;
and in action, like good soldiers, to follow their leaders, not
to the breach only, but through the breach, until the fortress
be in their possession. Well may the bravest quail at the
prospect of leading, or sharing in, a forlorn hope, with
comrades, who at the decisive moment are pretty sure to run
away. I take the liberty of putting forward these views for
the consideration of the members of the scholastic profession,
because, in so addressing them, I have earned the right by a
dearly bought experience.
I have already ventured to express the opinion regarding
Mr. Stephen?s Bill that, with one important exception,
the conspicuous faults of the Bill lay in its omissions.
Independently of the very important matters that were
overlooked by the framers of the Bill, the clause about Boards-
of Advice was a very clumsy piece of legislation. It were
well, if this was the worst that could be said about it. The
Boards of Advice, as at present constituted, when they would
wish to set themselves to any useful work, can do little more
than beating the air. The creation of such an imposing
piece of machinery, without any executive functions, is?for
the present time, and side by side with Constitutional and
Democratical institutions, an anomaly?a thing out of
season. The duties and powers of the Boards of Advice are
exactly such, as they might be called upon to exercise in a
country entirely under despotic rule, where every form of
local government is assumed to be reduced to a minimum of
effective action, or to a merely empty formality. The only
liberal features about these Boards, they owe to the Legisla-
tive Council. As clause 15 originally stood, the members
of the Boards were to be appointed by the Minister. The
Council conferred the right of election upon the ratepayers,
thus giving the parents and the districts some voice in the
management of .Education. The Boards had also n power
conferred upon them, but a very mitigated one. The inten-
tion of the Government was, that everything down to the
minutest details should be entirely and exclusively controlled


by central authority, and that there should be no local
authority whatever to give effect to local requirements ; and
this is practically how the matter stands at present.
In this respect the case of this country, so far as I know,
is unique. In no other country, with constitutional form
of Government, and having a national, or public system of
schools, are the public schools exclusively in the hands of
Government officials. Local committees, elected by the
people of the several districts, constitute the life and soul,
the patrons and principal managers, of the public schools of
every other country possessing free and enlightened institu-
tions. Even in despotic Russia, where Education has lately
been making rapid strides, the innumerable communes, into
which the country is divided for purposes of local govern-
ment, elect their own school committees, for providing
school accommodation and teachers. In England and in
Scotland under the new Educational systems, every district,
whether city, borough, or even parish, elects a board, which
has nearly the whole management of erecting schools and
choosing teachers. In British India, however, the Victorian
system of Educational administration prevails; there the
Government takes the entire control of the public schools
into its own hands. That is proper enough in India. The
wisdom of men has not yet arrived at any one system of
Government, that would be equally, or at all fitted for every
country. A polity, that aptly fits itself to European condi-
tions, would be found unworkable among Asiatic nations.
This important induction in the history of the human race
was, no doubt, present in the mind of Mr. Stephen, and his
colleagues in legislating upon, and still more in administering
a new system of Education. It seems at first a little strange,
that the people of this country should be deemed unfit to be
entrusted with the exercise of any power in the manage-
ment of such purely local interests as their schools, while in
Britain and in America every district is called upon to
assume nearly the entire responsibility in the management
of its schools. That the Government and their supporters
pay a very poor compliment to the people of this country, is
a conclusion that cannot fairly be avoided. The Govern-
ment and their supporters were resolved to get all the power,
and especially all the patronage into their own hands; and
to effect this they did not scruple to soil the good name of
their own constituents. Both in the House, and outside the
House, this party was endeavouring to show, that the people
were incapable of electing School Boards qualified to exercise
important trusts. A reference to Hansard only will be
sufficient to show this:?
a some of the less affluent communities where the current
morality is not always to be rated high, the schoolmaster without


any fault of his own, may find his office anything but enviable, and
his possession of it the incentive to active persecution by a clique of
villagers. The origin of such hostilities is frequently traceable to an
abrupt?but possibly truthful ?remark affecting the quality of some
committeeman?s beer or groceries, or perhaps sermons. The object of
the strife is definite, to starve out the offending teacher. This is
silently and gradually brought about by withdrawing a sufficient
number of children, whose parents sympathise with the reformer, to
reduce the average below the limit fixed by the Act. The period
required for maturing this philanthropic purpose varies from two to
six months.?
This was quoted, with other extracts of a similar import,
in the discussion on the Bill, from the published reports of
the Inspectors of Schools, as a justification for reducing
School Boards to so many nullities. The Inspector, who
penned this brilliant fancy sketch, is rather to be commended
than otherwise, for relieving the monotony of our Education
Office literature, and I rejoice to find that the managers of
our University have given him a scope for the exercise of
his talents?for where has fancy found a more excursive field
than in history? Whether or not cases might be found
approaching in many of their features the above sketch,
which on more occasions than one was quoted and referred
to at that time, is not material. Such exceptional aggregates
of society are quite as likely to be found in England as in
Victoria. Did space permit, I should be prepared to show
that the great body of our population are quite as qualified
for the duties of self-government as the bulk of their brethren
in England ?perhaps a shade or two more so.
A close study of our Parliamentary history will show
that the members of the Assembly were regarding their own
ends and interests, rather than the general welfare of society,
when they so readily supported a measure for centralising
all power and patronage in the hands of the Government.
To look at the matter from the patronage point of view; it
is a well-known fact, that, generally speaking, a member
looks upon a vacancy in a Government situation within the
bounds of his constituency, as something in which he has a
vested interest. He looks upon himself, especially if he
votes with the Ministry, as in a manner the patron of all
the Government livings in the district he represents. To
increase or diminish the list of appointments made by the
Government, becomes too often a personal question with a
portion of our Legislative Assembly. The trading patriot,
when he transfers his energies to the arena of politics, has
bright visions of many good things, in addition to �3OO
a-year. I dare say the reader will remember a scene, in
that once highly popular farce ?The Irish Tutor , which the
study of Victorian politics has kept fresh in my memory.
The situation of tutor to the son of an Irish squire is applied


for and obtained by a queer specimen of the Irish flunkey,
who assumes the disguise of a university graduate. The
would-be tutor is informed of the salary, which is not large,
attached to the office, and that, to compensate for the
moderate allowance in money, he is to have the; run of the
kitchen. The footman-tutor is in ecstasy at the intelligence,
that to his new office is attached the valuable perquisite of?the
run of the kitchen. Sweet and precious to the soul of many
a Victorian politician is The Run of the Kitchen. What-
ever members have come to look upon by the most liberal
construction as coming within the range of their Perquisites,
they religiously guard from profane handling. The cry, that
?The Perquisites are being infringed ! rallies the Opposition,
and Government hangers-on round one common standard!
When Sir James M'Culloch in the plentitude of his power,
took my worthy friend, the late Hon. George Rolfe, into his
Cabinet, the members? perquisites were considered to be
invaded, and the bold innovator was ignominiously turned
out of office. When Mr. Francis? suddenly awakened zeal
in the cause of Education could not displace Mr. Duffy, he
found in the latter?s invasion of the perquisites, a ready
weapon to dislodge him. A vote of half a million, or three-
quarters of a million may be frittered uselessly away in
playing at Water Supply. What does it matter, so long as
the Government allows the nominees of the members the
Run of the Kitchen, in the expenditure of the money 1 To
pass over members, or their friends, in appointing to an office
in London, may endanger the security of a Ministry. This
is a great and sore evil in our Legislature ? and, until a
remedy is found, the progress of this country will be sadly
hampered.
As far as the Government is concerned, this truth ought
to be noted that it is of the very nature of Governments
in all countries, to endeavour to get as much power and
patronage into their own hands as they can. These tenden-
cies are always to be looked for in every Government \ and
the proper checks against encroachments by the governing
power are to be found, in the spirit and intelligence of the
people, and of the people?s representatives. In this country
the G-oyernments begin their encroachments by first nobbling
a sufficient number of the representatives.
I always regret that School Boards were not established
in this country, upon the same principle as they are now in
Scotland, and permissively in England, and in fact in every
other community of European race, with a national system of
Education. I regret our failure in this not only because, with-
out proper Boards, the schools will be badly managed, but
also because Local Government educates and trains for the


exercise of political rights. The education of the children
will in this manner be best provided for, and by the same
machinery the political education of the parents will be
carried on. The Council did a great service to the cause of
political Education, when they conferred upon the ratepayers
the right of electing the Boards of Advice. It now remains
to give the Boards their legitimate executive functions,
which the Assembly allowed the Government to usurp. I
watched with great interest the first election of Boards,
under the new Act. and I think it most gratifying to
find, that the electors polled in such numbers and made
such an excellent selection. It also gave one good hope
of the great possibilities of local government, to find that
generally the best men in each district offered themselves
as candidates for the new office. The position and character
of these gentlemen afford a good confutation of the sneering
predictions of some of the people?s representatives, made in
Assembly. The kind of argument employed by the latter is
a sword that cuts both ways; for, if popular election cannot
secure proper men for managing the local schools, and other
matters of local concern, popular election is still less fitted to
secure the proper men to sit in Parliament. The candidates
for School Boards are always well known to the electors ;
candidates for Parliament are frequently heard of for the
first time, when they begin to solicit the votes of a consti-
tuency : the voters for School Boards are more select than
the voters for a member of the Assembly. Considering
that the Boards of Advice constitute in the aggregate a body
of gentlemen so numerous, and so influential, it is surely not
to be expected, that they will patiently submit, for any
length of time, to occupy their present false position. In
dealing with the question of elementary Education, it would
be an anomaly, and an abuse of language, to call a Govern-
ment constitutional, liberal, and adapted to democratical
conditions of society, that does not make, as much as
possible, the control and management of elementary schools
local, in order to meet the different requirements of different
localities.
I have ventured to give so much prominence to this
question, because the more I study the conduct of our public
men, the more I am convinced that there is at present an
urgent need, that the people of this country should take
the control of their public interests into their own hands, to
a much greater extent than has hitherto satisfied them.
The policy of centralisation which is growing to such an
alarming extent, can only be counteracted by an extension of
the principle of local government. The exercise of local
government is the best political education of citizens, who


?
aie fit for free institutions. So long as nearly every
public office in the country is at the disposal of the Minis-
try, so long will the possession of the Treasury benches
be, to a great extent, a scramble for the Parliamentary
loaves and fishes. So long as every district is in the habit
of looking continually to Government, for supplies of money
to develope its local resources, questions of national policy
will be in danger of being narrowed down to a parochial
point of view, and some constituencies will be represented in
Parliament by beadles. The advocates for an extension of
the system of local government, and especially the gentlemen
of the School Boards, must bestir themselves, to weed out as
many as possible of the beadles and trading politicians from
Parliament, before the needed reforms can be effected.
By this leview of the absence of local control and manage-
ment of the State-schools, we are conducted by a natural
transition once more to examine how the Minister of Educa-
tion did the work himself, which he was so jealous of sharing
with any local authority. This, however, calls for an exami-
nation, to some extent, of the whole plan of Educational
administration. The comity of discussion, in treating of the
action of our highest executive officers, will justify my use in
the last sentence of the term, plan. I must confess, however,
that even a close study of Mr. Stephen?s, and his successor,
Mr. Mackay s, conduct of the Education Department disclose
but very imperfect indications of systematic plan, unless a
political plan. After the Bill, such as it was, had been
carried, it would appear as if Mr. Stephen and his colleagues
took a very easy view of the labour that devolved upon
them, when the Act came into operation. To make a
partial concession to the expressed wish of the country by
getting a statute enacted was so far well; but to establish,
and carry out a policy entirely new in its leading features
demanded no ordinary degree of organising faculty, special
aptitude, and knowledge of the business in hand. It is only
fail to Mr, Stephen to say, that, I believe, he made no pre-
tensions to the possession of any special qualifications for the,
to him, novel and not congenial duties, which his colleagues
imposed upon him. Perhaps, they imagined, they had dis-
covered in their Attorney-General some of the qualities, for
undertaking extra-professional services, however difficult,
that Sidney Smith had described of Lord John Bussell. One
of the first duties that devolved upon the new Minister, was
the formation of the new Department of Education. So much
fault had been found with the administration of the Board,
and also with the machinery by which the Board had
managed the schools, that one would have supposed, the
Minister would inaugurate the new regime by an attempt at


an improvement upon the staff of the defunct Board?that
the machinery which under the Board had received so much
condemnation, would now undergo a thorough overhaul,
implying important additions.
It so happened, and in the present case it was rather
unfortunate, that Educationists were scarcely within the
circle of Mr. Stephen?s acquaintance. Yet he had calculated
upon getting out of, what appeared?even to him?a rather
awkward position, if he could secure the services of a first-
rate man, who would be the real Minister, under the title of
Secretary, For this onerous office he had marked out a par-
ticular friend, Professor Irving, the head master of Wesley
College. The trustees of this school, however, would not
release their head-master from his engagement, and so Mr.
Irving was unable to come to the aid of his patron. Whether
Mr. Irving was in this case ? The man for Galway,? we
cannot say, seeing that his sphere of activity had always
been outside the circle of primary schools, Mr. Irving holds
a position so high, and deservedly so, in his own line, that
any speculation, as to how he might succeed in a new sphere,
cannot affect his acquired reputation. One cannot help
reflecting upon some of the strange anomalies, to which a
teacher?s career is subject in this colony. Had Mr. Irving,
in beginning the career of life, devoted his great energies to
Popular Education, the probabilities are small that he would
be the first man called upon to re-organise the primary
schools. Such contradictions are too prevalent, in England
also, to excite, perhaps, much surprise here.
Having failed in securing the services of Mr. Irving, and
knowing next to nothing of Educational men generally, Mr.
Stephen had to fall back upon the old staff of the
Education Office. This staff had claimed the posses-
sion of one man of some administrative ability, Mr. Ben-
jamin Kane; and he died just before Mr. Stephen
took the reins. Among the indoor workers at the Edu-
cation Office, was one of the oldest of the professional
staff, and who rejoiced in the title of Examining Inspector,
whatever that may mean. This gentleman, whose duties
brought him very little into direct intercourse with the
outside world, was believed to go through little routine work
of some kind or another very diligently. Mr. Venables had
been Mr. Kane?s factotum, and as he was supposed to be well
versed in the traditions of the Office, he was called to the
post that had been designed for Mr. Irving, partly, it was
said, by the latter?s recommendation. Nothing can be a
greater mistake, than to act on the assumption, that promo-
tion to the head of an executive department can be carried
out by the rule of seniority.


Stowed away among piles of papers, Mr. Venables may,
in years past, have rendered excellent clerical services ;
here he had attained to the measure of his capacity !
Instead of Education, if a reorganisation of the Law
Department had fallen to the province of Mr. Stephen,
where he could exercise an intelligent and independent
judgment, a man of the Venables type might answer
his purpose very fairly. Something new had to be
created; and there was no creative faculty immediately
available just then about the Education Office?so far as can
be judged from results. A work of reconstruction was the
logical sequence of the Act?s becoming not a dead, but a
living letter; but where are the evidences of the architects?
designs, for almost all that is visible to us is routine and
laissez faire ? I ask the reader?s attention to consider with
me for a little, what is implied, when we speak of a new
scheme, plan or method, which professes to deal with national
requirements. Every scheme proper is an idea; and as such
can have its source only in an intelligent mind : according
as a scheme is more or less new, an idea more or less original
is implied. A method, that succeeds, is a proof by experi-
ment, that a thought, or a group of thoughts or ideas, was
true. In every successful enterprise, the end must be
clearly perceived in thought, antecedent to the execution
of the plan; and the degree of success of a plan, when carried
out, is an exact measure of the clearness with which the
factors, conditions and results were imagined. This facultv
of vivid conception must be possessed by every man, who
would originate, and carry into successful execution any
important plan or scheme whatever; without it, the most
laborious efforts to advance result in a treadmill round, if
not worse.
Even in the humblest walks of life, daily observation
will supply illustrations of the important part, that imagina-
tion plays, in the performance of any description of work,
that implies design. Such of my readers, as have studied
Hugh Miller?s sketches of his earlier years ?My Schools and
My Schoolmasters? may remember that author?s very
interesting account of the mason, old John Frazer. Miller
relates that John Frazer, and his two brothers, who were
also masons, were such proficients in their craft, that each
could do the work of three ordinary masons. As John
Frazer had no physical advantages over his fellow-workers,
Miller?s account of such extraordinary powers, presents so
clear and graphic a specimen of mental analysis, that I give
it here entire :
? -^ or did his mallet deal more or heavier blows than that
of the common workman. He had, however, an extraordi-


nary power of conceiving of the finished piece of work, as lying
within the rude stone from which it was his business to disinter
it; and ivhile ordinary stonecutters had to repeat and re-repeat
their lines and draughts, and had in this way virtually to give
their work several surfaces in detail ere they reached the true
one, old John cut upon the true figure at once, and made one
surface serve for all. In building too, he exercised a similar
power; he hammer-dressed his stones with fewer strokes
than other workmen, and fitting the interspaces between
stones already laid, always picked from out of the heap at
his feet the stone that exactly fitted the place; while the
other operators busied themselves in picking up stones that
were too small or too large; or, if they set them to reduce
the too large ones, reduced them too little or too much, and
had to fit and fit again. Whether building or hewing John
never seemed in a hurry.?
The change into italics is mine, and the intelligent reader
will recognise their import.
My courteous reader, in case these observations may
appear to you to trench upon ground too extended for my
present limits, please consider my position. Granting that
the improvement of our State-schools and Educational
Administration forms our theme ; yet, to this end, I am
deeply impressed by the conviction, that an educating of the
public sentiment must, in a great measure, be accepted as a
prior condition; and nowhere is the application of this
educating process more urgently required than among our
Legislators, with all due deference be it said. To resume
our criticism on the manner in which the Department of
Education has managed the important trust committed to
it; the more the history of this Department for the last
three years is studied, the more clearly we arrive at the
conclusion, that, whatever were the administrative short-
comings of the late Board, no material improvement could
be looked for in this respect, considering the manner in
which the Minister organised the staff. If the Board?s
management failed to inspire public confidence, when the
official head of the executive staff was Mr. Benjamin Kane,
one hardly sees what increase of public confidence was
likely to accrue, from merely continuing the administration
with the same staff, and with only such improvements
as the substitution of Mr. Venables for Mr. Kane?
very questionable improvements indeed. True, there was
Mr. Stephen, succeeded by Mr. Mackay, in place of the Board.
It so happened, however, that both these gentlemen were,
all the time they presided over this Department, saddled
with other, and, there is reason to believe, more congenial
business. The actual amount, therefore, of efficient services,


which they rendered at the Education Office, was meagre in
the extreme. As to conceiving, maturing and carrying into
operation any plan, the conditions, under which that could
happenn, ever existed, so far as depended upon the political
head of the new Department; and it is equally clear that
the permanent head possessed but little of the extraordinary
power of conceiving, that old John Frazer had. I cannot
see how we can avoid coming to the conclusion, that neither
Messrs. Stephen nor Mackay, nor their colleagues, had formed
a true idea of what was implied, in the term, Minister of
Education; and?that they had very imperfectly realised
the true nature of the work they undertook, or else con-
sciously shut their eyes to the responsibility of the position
they had taken before the country, and for which they
claimed, and received public support and confidence?when
they asked and obtained the sanction of the Legislature, for
dealing with the National schools on an entirely new and
altered basis. Instead of a clearly conceived and definite
plan, in which the conditions and factors were correctly
ascertained, and calculated with sufficient intelligence to
afford a result in each case, that corresponded, more or less,
with the end proposed, we find a condition of things, under
which matters have been allowed to adjust themselves by
routine, by rule of thumb, or by blind chance. Those, whose
duties to the public have brought them much in contact
with the Education Office, during the last three years, can
be successfully appealed to in confirmation of this. It
cannot be denied that the head of the Office toils
laboriously after his own style; but dealing with men,
and finding his way without a groove are tasks, that
never ought to have been imposed upon him. I believe it
will be very generally found, that Government offices have
a strong tendency to beget in the permanent officials
a mental habitude, which regards the public as existing
for their benefit primarily; and not them for the public.
I am not aware, that this particular form of belief has
yet received a designation ; and so we may call it, pro-
visionally?the Bureaucratic Religion. In the Education
Office, at the close of the Board?s regime, the Bureaucratic
Religion was more firmly established, than in any of the
other public offices. The time of the change was a period
of grave anxiety to the priests; but, when Mr. Stephen
called the High Priest of the sect to the head of the Office,
the apprehensions of the other priests were very much
allayed. The Minister?s subsequent policy also haply fell
in with their views. A main tenet of these priests was,
that new appointments to the stall' and the office should be
made within such a limit, as to age and inexperience , as


?would guarantee a supply of recruits, with ideas still plastic
and unformed. Nothing would be more distasteful at the
Office, than a vigorous policy, which would admit to all parts
of the Department men of pronounced views and large
experience. Such men are tabulated there as ? dangerous
outsiders?; and, to exclude their admission, most base
expedients have, when deemed necessary, been resorted to.
The way, in which the Minister?s exercise of patronage came
to harmonise with the views of the Office, was in this wise.
Among the young men who every year finish their course at
our University, there are always some, who, after taking a
degree, find a start in life rather difficult. A majority of
this class will be found qualifying for the bar; but are
always open for Government appointments. Young men of
this class, with good connexions in East St. Kilda, were
usually successful suitors with Mr. Stephen. The appoint-
ment of a young man, whose mind, on the economy of
common schools, was a tabula rasa, fitted nicely with the
traditions of the Office.
Nothing is more essential to the successful working of a
national system of Education, than a well-organised plan of
special education and training for teachers. There is nothing
that puts in a clearer light the weakness of our Educa-
tional Administration, than its failure to organise a properly
planned system of Normal Training Colleges. After much
talking and vaunting, the question of a Normal College is
practically in the position, in which it stood three years ago.
Something had been done by the Board in the way of
establishing a training institution for teachers, but not
much; for the notions of the Board in such matters were
rather cloudy. Moreover, an enterprise of this kind would
hardly be expected to be carried out by the Board, without
partaking more or less of the nature of a job. Under the
new order, all that was to be changed. In one direction
only there has been a change, but there has been no improve-
ment. The change, which was ushered in with such a
flourish of trumpets by Mr. Mackay, consisted in reducing
the period of attendance by students at the institution in
Spring-street from two years to one ; and in naming about
twenty of the State-schools at which candidates for the
office of teacher will spend a year, before they begin their
studies at the central institution. These twenty schools
receive the distinction of being called, Associated Training
Institutions; but, beyond the name, no change was made in
the economy of the schools themselves. That the master of
one of these schools can supply for students the educational
advantages of a properly organised Normal School, is the
merest delusion ; and the most intelligent, among these


masters, frankly acknowledge this. Such a scheme could
emanate only from a political educationist, prompted by
the inspiration of a Venables. Upon this very slender
ground, the Minister went through the country palavering
about the twenty training institutions, which the Govern-
ment was establishing, thus trying to tide over another
year with a little patchwork. It must, however, be admitted
that the educational loss to the students, from having their
attendance at the central institution reduced to a year, is not
very great, for the simple reason that the system pursued at
that institution is not greatly calculated to promote sound
learning. I took some pains this season to learn how it fared
with students there. I found that the mode of carrying out
the literary instruction was the crudest specimen of cram,
that ever came under my observation. Every branch of study
in the programme of a Normal College ought to be conducted
in such a manner that the style of teaching at every lesson,
or?as they are pleased to call it?lecture, might serve as a
model to the student, as far as possible, when he should after-
wards be called upon to take the charge of a school. The
method pursued at the institution in Spring-street very
nearly ignores these conditions.
The whole question of the professional education of teachers
is very imperfectly understood in this country; nor is that
to be wondered at, seeing that in England also the subject
is only beginning to excite proper attention. For every
important sphere in life, for every profession or employment
but the humblest, special training is deemed indispensable.
The only marked exception to this rule is the profession of
teaching. In other professions a man must not only possess
the tools of his craft, but he must also give a guarantee of
efficiency in handling them.
With the schoolmaster alone it has hitherto been deemed
sufficient that he possessed the scholastic weapon, whether
or not he knew how to use it.
Education is both a science and an art. Regarded as a
body of organised knowledge, whose phenomena are arranged,
so that the causes by which they are influenced can be traced,
and their relations estimated, education is a science. As the
practical application of a body of principles, reduced to rules
for the performance of work, such as implies the application
of means to an end, Education is an art. Education is an
art, in the same sense in which the practice of medicine is
an art. Though both are practised as arts, yet as medicine
is necessarily based on general principles, so also is Educa-
tion. Candidates for the scholastic profession?a profession
that almost requires to be created here?require to be taught
general principles, as a science, in a manner analogous to


the scientific instructing of students in medicine. In Europe
they do this. Among the better educated nations of the
Continent, Paidentics, or the science of teaching, has its
chairs at the universities, and forms a distinct branch of
university study, quite as much as the ?ologies. The
reference to medical studies has suggested a feasible plan
for the professional education of teachers, which could be
adopted, and carried out at very little additional expense.
At the University the student in medicine acquires science
and general principles. At our hospitals he is initiated into
the practice of his future profession. Melbourne can supply
excellent facilities in its schools, for giving students a prac-
tical knowledge of teaching. I believe the following plan
would best meet present conditions :
1. A Chair of Education or Paidentics should be established
at the University, as soon as a suitable man could be found.
2. Three or four extra-academical lectui?ers and instruc-
tors could be provided by re-organising the present staff of
the Central Training Institution.
3. One or more of the best State-schools would be set apart
for practice in teaching ; and arrangements would be made
for studying the systems pursued at hospital schools, and
also schools for the higher education.
4. There would necessarily be at least two classes of
students ?(a) those who had qualified themselves for the
Arts course, in the usual manner by matriculation ; (6) those
whose literary attainments would be below the University
standard, although in other respects they might become
eligible students.
The lecturers would give instruction in such subjects as
are outside the University courses, as geography, grammar,
&c., besides conducting the studies of class h, who would
attend the University for the course of lectures on Education.
The only additional outlay, for starting such a scheme, is
the new Professor?s salary?say �IOOO a-year. This is
about a half-penny in the pound upon the annual cost of the
State schools. The public which pays the pound so cheer-
fully will hardly grudge the half-penny, that will put a
crown on the edifice. Such a plan would offer facilities
for the improvement of our higher education, as well as the
primary schools. Of the masters in our grammar-schools
those, who do in time attain to proficiency in teaching,
generally learn the art at the expense of their pupils.
On this point I will quote from a speech delivered
two years ago by Dr. Abbott, Head-master of the City of
London School? Personally, I feel that, by some kind of
professional training, I should have been saved from many
mistakes that I deeply regret; for I gained much valuable


experience of teaching in a room at yonder corner, at the expense
of my pupils. And I think many other teachers entertain
with myself a feeling of regret, approaching to something keen,
at the mischief they have done their pupils from inefficiency.?
It would almost appear as if professional training rendered a
man unfashionable as a teacher in this country. Our higher
class of schools, socially regarded, now almost invariably
recruit their staffs with young men, who have either entered,
or have just graduated at the University ; and, as many of
them have an eye to another career, a slend w amount of
teaching power is in time gained at the expense of their pupils.
May not this account for the small proportion of youths at
these schools, who contract a taste for books ? A good illus-
tration of the backward state of general opinion in such
matters is afforded by the case of the new ladies? college,
which was inaugurated, at the commencement of the school
season this year, with such a flourish of trumpets and beating
of the Drum Ecclesiastic. The gentlemen selected for posts
at this institution, were all exceedingly respectable; but not
one among them was a professional teacher.
In correcting ? proof ? of the foregoing, I am reminded
that �he limits proposed on this occasion, are now attained.
The next issue of Young Victoria will resume the criticism
upon the Administration of the Education Department. In
this Essay it was necessary to clear up our ground, by treat-
ing the question of Education in a great measure from a
political point of view. In my next, the work done in the
schools will receive attention. But alas ! much yet remains
to be done, before Parliament can be brought to deal with
these questions in a proper spirit.
Those, versed in the ways of Goyernment in this country,
know very well, how successive Ministers have made a con-
venience of the Lands Office; and that a stool could always
be found, or made there for a friend?s friend. The Education
since it became a Ministerial Department, has been
used, in a great measure, for relieving the Lands Office of a
portion of this kind of business. By the official mind the
change has been regarded, mainly, as an accession of lubri-
cating power.
