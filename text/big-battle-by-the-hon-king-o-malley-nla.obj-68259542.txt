the POLITICAL TOOLS of
CAPITALISTIC MONOPOLISM
INTRODUCTION
To the Sovereign Thinkers of the Commonwealth Democracy declares
certain fundamental principles which are self-evident and indefeasible.
That all individuals are created equal, that all are endowed with rights
which only the possessors can alienate, that among these rights are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That Governments are established
among people to safeguard these rights, that Governments derive their
just powers to govern from the consent of the governed. Upon
these democratic, rock-embedded principles must forever rest the
foundation of all truly free, responsible government. Democracy is the
government of the people, by the people, for the people. I know as the
Commonwealth grows older, new political issues will arise of time and
progress. But the fundamental principles of democracy will always
remain as the only palladium of free government. The maintenance of
even-handed justice, the equality of all citizens before the law, the
reserved rights of the States and the supremacy of the Commonwealth
within the bounds of the constitution must constitute the basis of our
liberty and must never be abandoned, isolated or surrendered without
wrecking that parity of rights and powers which will enable the Common-
wealth to advance. In order to help the producers and small traders, to
prevent the political megaphones of the big money monopolies and
banking trusts of the world from gradually bleeding the citizens to death.
The Bank that financed the war and saved Australia from a universal bank
smash on the outbreak of war, no bank can stand a big run. I am
publishing at mv own expense the real Banking Powers for the benefit
of all the people who had no opportunity to learn and furnish
knowledge to the rising young politicians.

FUNCTIONS OF BANKING.
Hie function of progressive banking is to facilitate the production,
transportation, and distribution of commodities of general utility through
all tlie stages that lie between the original producers and the ultimate
consumers.
The medium of exchange is the most potent force in the progress
of production, trade, and commerce as distinguished from common barter,
fhe ultimate object of all trade and commerce is to exchange commodities
for commodities. W hen commodities are exchanged for money the process
of production, trade and commerce is only halt completed. Whatever is
satisfactorily accepted to facilitate production and trade during the process
of interrupted exchange becomes a temporary medium of exenange. The
perpetual declaration that money is the medium of exchange is only a
traction of the tact. The Word money is continually being misapplied.
In common parlance, money is synonymous with wealth and power.
People say certain persons have plenty of money, meaning they possess
great wealth and power. Again, that some financial magnates own large
amounts of money, meaning that they command big capital, while the fact
is wealthy men and great financial magnates possess very little money,
ft is no exaggeration to say that the average wealthy man possesses less
money than the average poor man. In reply they will say that the wealthy
do not carry their money in their pockets, but have it on deposit in the
banks. This declaration illustrates another popular misuse of the word
?money?. No person has money in the bank. A credit on a bank ledger
is not money; it is simply legal evidence of the bank?s indebtedness, which
may, or may not be paid like any other debts. Whatever money a bank
holds belongs to the bank, which is always less than the deposits. The
most that can be said of money as a medium of exchange is that it can
be used as such, but it is rarely ever utilised as a medium of exchange
except in petty transactions. The medium of exchange in all the petty
transactions is money, but in all the great commercial and financial
transactions it is not money but fortified credit.
Fortified credit for utility as a medium of exchange is created by
purchasing for the purpose of selling and is liquidated by selling for the
purpose of consumption. Such credits expand in proportion to the
expansion of production, trade and commerce, and contract in proportion
to the contraction of production, trade and, commerce. The producer
or trader who evolves an exchangeable credit deposits it in his bank,
and utilizes it first, then it is transferred time out of number by cheque,
effecting exchange after exchange until it is finally redeemed. The
intervening exchanges are made with money. Therefore, while all the
great financial commercial transactions are effected by fortified credit
as the medium of exchange, all producers and traders do not go in debt
for .commodities. Those who do not utilize credits which have been
created by others. Sympathetic banking is essential to agricultural,
industrial, and commercial developmental progress. But unfortunately
the existing Australian country branch banks possess no independent
functions, as they are indirectly managed from the large cities and purely
in the interests of the shareholders. The banks should be sympathetic
co-workers with the producers and traders. While the banking function
is only secondary the producing function is primary.
Production, trade and commerce are the basis, and without the
producers and traders there could be no banking function. The producers
and traders generate the business credits, the banks certify to their value,
making them available as a financial medium of exchange. The banks are
only the clearing houses of producers and traders. They clear their
customers? transactions by offsetting indebtedness, utilizing little money.
Banks are institutions of indebtedness instead of repositories for money.
BANKS ARE DEALERS IN DEBTS.
(They are traders in debts.) Their assets principally consist of legal
evidence of indebtedness. The banks are the biggest debitors of all
communities. They are in debt to nearly all the oeople, and most of
the people are in debt to them. In fact, banking is a profound exhibition
of the monumental power of skilfully manipulated indebtedness. Many
financial misconceptions exist owing to the imp rooer use of the words
deposits and loans ?. When the public is informed by the newspapers
that bank deposits have increased by many millions during the year it is
believed to be an increase of actual money. However, it simply means
that producers and traders have expanded their indebtedness, which has
been exchanged for fortified bank credits, thus also increasing the banks
indebtedness. It is the increase of indebtedness which can be utilized as
a financial medium of exchange, and not the increase of actual money.
The increase of real money cuts no ice. Considering the banks as money
institutions in conjunction with the utility of the words ?deposits? anil
loans , it is the universal belief that the sequence of banking is first
deposits, then loans, and therefore the bank?s loans must be limited by the
amount of the deposits. Let us investigate these apparently self-evident,
but in fact false propositions. Supposing 1 borrow *lO,OOO from the bank
on a mortgage and immediately deposit it in my own name. That
transaction would increase both the bank s loans and deposits by �lO,OOO.
Although it would increase the bank?s deposits �lO,OOO, it would not be
evidence of an increase of real wealth. After 1 had secured the �lO,OOO,
the bank would possess no less real money, and I no more real money.
1 would have only a credit of �lO,OOO on the bank ledger. It was not
a borrowing of money, but an exchange of fortified credit. I have
exchanged my securities as legal evidence of my indebtedness to the bank
in return for a book entry as legal evidence of the bank?s indebtedness to
me. I can transfer the bank?s indebtedness to me by cheque, which is
miscalled drawing the money from the bank, but as my cheque will be
deposited in the same or some other bank and the �lO,OOO security would
remain a portion of the aggregate depo.-ils of the banks, either in the
original or some other bank until cancelle ?' by redemption.
lo my transaction, the bank increased us deposits by increasing its loan
and if alt the bank?s deposits be regarded in the aggregate it is evident
that the deposits increase in proportion to the increase ot the loans. The
principal deposits are produced by the principal loans. The truth is, in
all the principal banking transactions there is no borrowing, lending, or
depositing, they are purely debt transactions ?an interchange of forti-
fied credits, which, in the matter of bookkeeping, swells both the deposits
and loans in equal amount at the same time. In the main, the whole of
the deposits are produced by exchanging the bank?s fortified credits, in
the form of promissory notes, cheques, drafts, bills of exchange, etc. True,
small streams of actual money liow in and out, but they are so nearly
equal that the difference plays no part. A bank?s cash resembles a column
ot metal with a slight ripple on the surface. In the Commonwealth the
biggest ripple on the surface of the reserve is created by the daily
clearances. With a systematically organized National Banking Scheme no
money whatever, except for petty transactions would be required.
Ihe daily balances at the London Clearing House amounting to
untold mil Hops annually are settled without the use of money. Inter-
changing fortified credits should be the chief function of modern banking
institutions. Their business should consist in investigating individual and
co-operation credits, and extending their own fortified credits in exchange
for such individual co-operation credits as are acceptable, thus always
supplying a reasonable commercial medium of exchange. To consider
banking as merely money lending is to demean its main function.
PRODUCTION, TRADE AND COMMERCE CREDITS.
The development of trade credits has relation to production and their
extinction to consumption. There is always an indettnite period of time
between production and consumption. As consumption cannot be
definitely accelerated, and the commercial mediums of exchange once issued
cannot ue redeemed until cominouiuts aie demanded for consumption,
a vast volume of such floating capital must be always outstanding, and as
production and consumption are perpetual processes the function of bank-
ing is also perpetual, the Banking System which misses perpetually to
exercise the function of exchanging fortitted credits neglected to perform
its sacred duly, and does irreparable injury to the community because
the standard value ot products can be maintained only by the business
people with the help of the banks unflinchingly sustaining them at reason-
able rates of interest until they are required tor consumption. When the
banks refuse to exchange fortified credits with the producers and traders,
they are forced to discontinue purchasing, and sacrifice their goods below
cost price in order to secure sutficient money to meet maturing obligations.
Such attempts must always prove abortive, because the consumption
which generates the ultimate redemption of fortified credits is essentially
a uniform hand-to-mouth process, 'ihe producers and traders who unload
on other producers and traders do not reduce the volume of debts; it
only affects these producers, traders, and perhaps their bankers by trans-
ferring the burdens to other producers, traders, and other banks. But this
method only reduces values lower and lower, until many of the honest
producers and traders are ruined, and compelled to join the unemployed.
IDLE WORKERS AND CAPITAL.
The ruination ot these employers deprives workers of employment. The
ability of these unemployed workers to consume is limited, which curtails
the demand still further lowering values, ruins still other traders and
producers, depriving more workers of employment, still further reducing
values and consumption, bankrupting producers and traders, and finally
bursting many of the banking corporations, and this evil is the result of
bad banking. Most banks limit loans when some customers withdraw
balances, only intensifying financial crises. Yet in 1823 during the bank
smashes when the deposits had decreased by millions owing to the
contracting of credit, tne banks possessed far more real money than ever
before. This is clear evidence that the cause; of the panic was not a shortage
of money in the banks. The stupendous decrease in deposits was
equalized by the decrease of the loans, and was due to the refusal of
the banks to continue exchanging fortified credits with the producers and
traders.
The difference between the decrease o � deposits and the decrease of
loans was trifling. The reason of the enormous shrinkage of the available
medium of exchange or the vast decrease in deposits and the consequent
destruction of normal values followed by bankruptcy of producers and
traders and distress of workers was the direct action of the banks in
contracting their loans. That th- te banking corporations should
stumble at every panic and stoj tanging of fortified credits is
inevitable, and the only remedy successful functioning of the
Comm -? ealth Bank, which, as i onstituted, is impossible.
Each corporation must depend on itself, without the co-operation of
the others it cannot maintain the required credits of a debitor Common-
wealth. Each scrambles to increase cash reserves at the expense of others.
Where else is cash to come from to reduce the liabilities? Their isolated
weakness forces each to prey on the others, and adopt David Hamm?s
version of the golden rule ?Do unto the other banks what you know they
will do unto you, but do it fust??. This unnatural scramble after money to
maintain reserves will never again effect the commerce of the Common-
wealth when a National Banking System is in proper operation, so
connected through numerous branches throughout the Commonwealth
that each branch will constitute a mutual help to all.
fhe only banking law in England is that restricting the issue of
bank-notes. In all other respects the banks are as free as other corpora-
tions. I here is no English law requiring any reserve whatever to be held
against deposits. But the Bank Act of 1844 names a minimum reserve
to be held by the Bank of England against its outstanding notes. This
minimum reserve requirement was expected to correct all financial evils,
it was forever to prevent speculation, bank failures, and commercial
panics. It required the banks when the limit was reached to stop
loaning, yet within three years the law, instead of stopping, produced
every economic explosion which it was expected to prevent, including a
currency panic. When the legal minimum of the reserve was reached, and
in obedience to the law the bank discontinued discounting loaning, and
called in all overdrafts without renewals. The greatest distress followed;
producers and traders could not liquidate even at the sacrifice of all their
property. London producers and traders walked the streets at midnight,
offering their commodities at any sacrifice, values disappeared, Jonsols
and exchequer biiis were ottered at fabulous discounts, hut could no: be
sold. Extravagant rates of interest were offered in vain for the use of
money. Finally, in the midst of universal panic, on petition signed by
tens of thousands the very Government which had procured the passage of
the law was forced to request the banks to disregard the law. The banks
resumed exchanging bank credits, and in a short time after it was known
the panic was ended.
Producers and traders who had been clamouring for loans refused
them when offered, the smarties? who withdrew gold at high rates returned
it and begged the banks to accept and cancel interest. Again in the panic
of 1857 the total gold reserve in the Bank of England and its branches
was reduced to only �358,208. This was practically the total aggregate
teserve of all the banks of England. At the close of business on
November 12th, 1857, the Government allowed the Banks to disregard the
law. The Bank of England made new loans, that is, interchanged credits,
besides renewals, in the sixteen days remaining of November amounting
to �0,000,000. That is to say, with only �358,208 of reserve, the Bank
of England expanded its loans in eighteen days by �8,000,000, and its
reserves increased day by day. Following the example, the other banks
expanded their credits. These are facts well worth deep reflection. When
the bank stopped discounting in order to protect the reserve, the reserve
decreased; as soon as they resumed loaning the gold reserve increased.
This great panic of 1857 far exceeding in intensity that of 1847, added
another proof that in a great panic the restrictive practice will bring only
universal failure, and that the expansive practice is the only one which
can defend the Banking System.
1893 BANK SMASH.
In the Australian bank bursting panic of 1893 through the action
of the banks contracting the medium of exchange by millions, many
producers and traders were driven to insolvency. Ihe classes of property
which possess intrinsic value, the homes which furnish shelter, tlic larms
which produce food and clothing, tiie manufacturing plants and warehouse
and buildings necessary lor trade and commerce, yet these classes of
property had practically no market value during the panic. Those who
invested in equities were ruined. Labour, the basis of all wealth, was in a
state of starvation. More than a quarter of a million aide-bodied workers
were in the ranks of the unemployed. Boodliers said the cause was over-
production; more like under-consumption, there was no time during
the panic in which all the homes of the Commonwealth would not have
been in demand for occupation, and the products of the farms and factories
for consumption if all the workers possessed the imans of purchasing
them. These unemployed had the capacity to consume all their labour
would produce, had they been working, and thus the normal equilibrium
between supply and demand would be maintained. The cause of the panic
was the extinction of millions oft the medium of exchange, resulting from
unduly restricting the function of supplying credits. There are no
classes of the people so deeply interested in tne successful operations of
the Commonwealth Bank and its capacity or perpetually exercising the
banking function as the debitors and workers.
PERMANENT WEALTH.
Permanent wealth is produced by the slow process of industry,
combined with skill and tfie manipulation of capital. Fog wealth is
produced by the rapid process of placing one piece of paper in the
possession of a bank as a collateral security for two pieces of paper.
Some of the enormous quantity of fog wealth which is being created
will sooner or later collapse. But with the Commonwealth Bank cajiable
of sustaining legitimate credits there can come no panic which will again
destroy the market value of intrinsic values, ruin debitors, deprive workers
of work, and produce general distress.
Oh! would that 1 possessed the power to arouse the Australian people
to the imperative importance of revitalising the Commonwealth Bank. In
financial crises they have suffered, but their minds seemed to be possessed
with the fatalism of the Turks ?it is the will of Allah. But 1 say it is
not the will of God which produces panics, but a want of an intelligent
Banking System.
In 11(25 a parliamentary Commission proved the fact that in the panic
of 1793 upward of 100 English banks had failed. In 7 years 1810 to
600 banks failed, and in the panic of 1825 up to date of the
inquiry, 26 banks failed. The banks which failed paid but a small
percentage of their indebtedness.
In the great panic of 1837-8, more than 1,000 banks, practically all
the banks in America, failed. In 1856, nearly every bank in America
put up i( s shutters, and abandoned business, and but few of them ever


-f/fr
resumed. In 1893, most of the Australian hanks got sick, hung out signs
?Suspended pending Reconstruction?, causing the ruin of thousands of
producers and traders.
In times of panics the people distrust the solvency of the private
banking corporations.
BANKING FUNDAMENTAL FINANCE.
Banking is the fundamental essence of finance and finance is a
governmental function. The banks should be co-workers with the pro-
ducers and traders.
The Commonwealth Bank should possess the capacity to continue exer-
cising the banking function, and thereby sustaining normal values during
the fiercest commercial crisis.
A system possessing potential financial power such a capacity in
connection with the talent for production, trade and commerce possessed
by the people of Australia and the boundless wealth of its natural
resources may make Melbourne instead of London the principal exchange
city of the world, and Australia instead of England the creditor nation
of the world; without it, never.
The creditor nation fact is not a matter of superior wealth or capital.
To-day England is the creditor nation, but it is not claimed that it has the
wealth of America. It is a matter of organisation. Let me illustrate.
If I possess �lOO,OOO of capital as an individual I can loan only �lOO,OOO.
But if I organise a bank with ray capital, and exercise the banking
function of exchanging fructified indebtedness or credits. I may collect
interest on many millions, just as our banks with a million of capital,
loan five, ten or twenty, and even more millions.
At present England is the banker of the world, and collected tribute
from all the nations of the world, in the form of interest, not for the use of
money or capital, but for the use of her fructified indebtedness or credits.
Through the fact that the Bank of England is operated as if a
government Bank, England collects interests on millions of its own
indebtedness to other nations. It is a profitable calling to collect interest
on what one owes and it is this which makes England the creditor nation.
Australia as it is now can only utilise actual capital, and cannot compete
with countries which can loan all they dare to owe. It is not more capital,
more wealth or more money which the Commonwealth requires in order
to become a great financial centre, but a progressive Commonwealth
Bank policy. The capital engaged in banking in America is larger than
the capital engaged in banking in Great Britain.
The paid up aggregate capital of all the joint stock banks of England,
Scotland and Wales including the Bank of England, was only �70,000,000
while the capital of the National Banks of America at the same date was
�130,000,000. The medium of exchange produced by the banks of Great
Britain was �775,000,000 while the medium of exchange produced by
the American National banks was �530,000,000. On account of the
leadership of the Bank of England the banks of Great Britain, with
approximately one-half the capital of the American banks produced nearly
twice the amount of the medium of exchange.
We have been told by our greatest statesman that the nation com-
manding the seas will control the trade and commerce of the world, and
those who control the trade and commerce will command the wealth of
the world, and therefore the world itself. But I believe you can own
ships to sail the oceans over and armies to plant the national symbol on
the highest peaks of the loftiest mountains and navies to carry the flag to
the remotest Island of the Oceans. But you will never command the trade
and commerce of the world nor the wealth of the world nor the world
itself until you create a National Financial System, which will regulate
the Exchanges of the Commonwealth during world?s panics, and
maintain at all times a fairly low uniform rate of interest.
I would like the wise men who believe that fastening a flag at the
stern of ships changes the course of production, trade, and commerce, at
what price a banker in Boston, New York, Berlin, Paris, or Hong Kong
will purchase Bills of Exchange or Time Drafts on Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Perth, or Burnie, against consignments as long as they believe
that by the time these instruments reach these cities, for re-discount. The
current rate of interest may be any rate between 5/- and 1/- per day or
what the banks like to charge, or they may then refuse to re-discount at
any rate because they are frightened, and on what terms could the bankers
of those foreign cities reimburse themselves by selling to importers
instruments on frightened Banks? I should like to know what they
propose to do in the next financial crisis? Perhaps the producers and
traders will get the Prime Minister to issue a proclamation to all nations
that there is a financial crisis, and that most of the banks are suspended
pending reconstruction and the balance are so paralyzed from fear that they
will be unable to do business for some time, but he trusts foreign
producers and traders will consign their commodities to Australia, and
make their Drafts or Bills of Exchange on Japan. The commodities
of production, trade, and commerce follow the drafts and bills of
exchange, and not flags, and the principal reason for a country to become
the market place of the world?s trade and commerce is not because any
particular flag flies at the stern of many ships, but because every banker,
merchant, broker, and seller of exchange in every part of the world knows
at all times within one or two per cent, per annum the intrinsic value of a
draft or Bill of Exchange for re-discount at its banks.
Production, Trade, and Commerce follows the Boodle. I think I
have proved that the periodical financial crises which occur in the
Commonwealth are preventable. I claim that the Commonwealth Bank
should possess the financial power to maintain legitimate credits during
world?s panics as to uphold normal valuations of property, and thereby
preserve the honest business people, and keep the wheels of industry in
motion, and the workers fully employed at living wages. I also claim
that such governmental system of banking is necessary to enable the
Commonwealth to compete in the world?s markets, finance its
obligations, liquidate its debts, stop borrowing, increase national
production and exportation by lower rates of interest to producers and
traders. Besides loss of a life?s saving by the insolvency of banks,
bankruptcy of solvent debtors, distress of families reduced from affluence
to beggary, lack of employment, a bed on the bare ground in summer, and
the plank of a police station in winter, soup kitchens and other incidents
of the panic are no part of the freedom of the people. Contraction and
falling prices oppress the poor, ruin the middle classes, and increase the
power and affluence of the wealthy. Those who control large amounts of
money are able to take advantage of the distress of others to accumulate
vast property for themselves. The power of the sovereign and its
possessor is increased, the congestion of wealth in the hands of a few
materially favored and the industrial interests of the nation in every way
disastrously affected.
Contraction and its sister failure of due expansion are among the
most powerful, insidious, and ?to the masses of the people unrecog-
nizable causes of evil that exist in this world of misery and mischief.
The high rate of interest on money determines what percentage of
value created by the producers and traders shall be paid to the financiers
for the use of their manufactured capital, and the percentage to be
retained by the producers and traders for their yearly operations.
It is most important to ascertain what percentage the producers and
traders can afford to pay for the use of artificial capital and still have a
few shillings left for their own families at the year?s end.
A reasonable rate of interest not more than 3% on O/D and V/>'/o
on 5 years mortgages, with right of renewal at 3%, would have a great
beneficial effect on production, trade and commerce in Australia.
If interest were reduced by law to 3% useful production would
increase by 50%. Wealth instead of accumulating in vaults of the big
city monopolies, would be more equitably distributed among the producers
and traders.
BIG CITIES.
A large percentage of the labor now employed in building up a few
big cities in the Commonwealth would be employed in beautifying the
country. Internal improvements would be made to an extent unparalleled
in Australia?s history. Agriculture, manufactures and the arts would
flourish in every section of the Commonwealth. The producers and
traders must create a new standard of distribution based on the golden
rules. _
As wealth gradually concentrates in a few hands owing to high rates
of interest, employment grows less and less, more men are thrown out of
work, and with no wages are unable to purchase the produce of jhe farms.
In all ages of the world?s history, high rates of interest have enabled
the monopolies to gather the accumulations of the many without work.
When a few wealthy men control the nation?s capital the many ;? oducers
and traders who have lost then n are compelled to borrow
credit and rent property at hig , , . rest rates. Then every few
years there is a general breaking up. Property and products fall in price.
No demand. Various financiers declare over-production, over-trading,
but never a word about the real cause which is high interest over a few
years, which has absorbed all the capital borrowed and land rented.
MONEY POWER.
If a few monopolies owned all the property of Victoria the rest of
the people would have to rent from them. Rent based on 6 or 7% per
annum would keep 90% of them in perpetual poverty. Money possesses
four, powers power to measure value, power to accumulate value by
interest, power to represent value, and power to exchange value. The
material of money is a legalised agent utilised to express these powers
and make them available for the use of production, trade and commerce.
The powers possessed by money are created by legislation. That?s
why money possesses legal value. Legal value depends on actual value.
Money must represent actual value based on property or labor.
Money produces no intrinsic value, but the land does. Agricultural
people must battle hard to master their economic troubles. While high
rates of interest prevail capital will continue to grab their surplus
earnings, and keep the struggling people poor. The rate of interest
determines the percentage of products that the producers and traders
must pay for the use of capital. The value of money is determined by
the interest it will accumulate and the value of property by its
rental powers. The market value of property must conform to the legal
standard. If the rent of property is insufficient to produce the value of
the property in the same time as the money value accumulates with
interest, the property will fall in value until the rent and interest are
equal. The interest on monej governs by percentage the rent of all
property. Money is the legal representative of all property and the
standard by which its value is ascertained. The interest is of the same
value as the money loaned, and the percentage on property must be made
conformable. The value of property falls in proportion to the rise of
the value of the pound that measures it. Whenever the value of money
increases by a rise of interest there is a corresponding reduction in the
value of all property. Money gathers for its owners by an accumulative
power to secure things already produced and not by a natural power of
growth like the germ of grain. Where the accumulating power of
interest is greater and quicker than the natural power of production, by
toil, this law of interest is a gigantic engine of evil gathering the nation?s
wealth into the banks of the big city capitalists. The interest rate decides
what proportions of the value produced by labor shall be awarded to the
money-lenders for the use of capital and the proportion demanded of
labor for production. A small amount of capital will liquidate big debts,
the same sum may pay off 50 bunches of debts the same day. The interest
on capital is a governing power, which compels all to contribute a
percentage of the products required to maintain all the non-producers in
Australia and many of the world?s money kings. A big percentage is
taken from the price of all products by the buyers and the same is added
to the price of everything produced by toil.

Many people think money is a producer of value. Wrong money
possesses no power to produce. The earth produces by the growth of
additional crops, but money possesses no natural productive quality.
It only gathers the things already produced. When a �lO,OOO loan is paid
at tin end of a year, bearing ini> rest at 1%, the �7OO interest did not grow
i'ii llic mortgage. The ordinary people working for a living think they
have no interest in banking operations. Their daily wages are paid from
bank loans to their employers. Cash plays a very small part in the
financial transactions of the Commonwealth. Big business is settled by
cheque on demand. When a banker lends a customer �20,000, that loan
when utilised, puts more than �20,000 in business circulation, and creates
�20,000 of purchasing power and continues operating until liquidated, as
circulating medium. No accumulation of property by work can ever equal
the accumulation of money at 7% per annum. To show that interest at
7% will accumulate property more rapidly than by toil.
THE ACCUMULATING POWER OF INTEREST.
Say that 2,000 people settle in a new country and form a young
colony. The 2,000 people follow various occupations. At the start of the
colony all are worth an equal amount of property, so that one shall
possess no superiority over another. Each follows a useful calling,
without speculation whereby a fortune may be secured without work. No
one has any means of support, only actual production, except the legal
interest rate of 7% on money loaned or rent at the same rate invested in
property all are diligent, in their several callings, and thus each
contributes to the general well-being. Four of them are 21, and only
think of getting rich. They are good tradesmen, and each is able to earn
10 shillings a day over expenses. Every six months they loan the money thus
saved at 7% interest, the interest payable half-yearly, and re-loaned. Their
minds are set on wealth, and do not burden themselves with a wife, house
or family. These men save 10/- a day, three hundred days in each
year, during 40 years. Each saves �l5O a year for 40 years, or for the
whole period �6,000 together �24,000; at 7% paid and re-loaned half-
yearly accumulates a sum equal to the principal in ten years. In 40 years
the 4 saved �24,000 by labor, in the next 20 years at 7% the �24,000
accumulated to �lOO,OOO, making �76,000 clear with interest in 20 years,
and only �24,000 in 20 years by toil of 4 men. Every shilling of the
�76,000 had to be earned by the labour of the rest of the population.
These 4 men at 82 die and leave the settlement mortgaged to their 1 eirs.
That shows the rate of accumulation at 7%. If that rat was
31/2% the amount of accumulation would have only been �38,000,
BANKING POWER.
We will examine the wond?s banking system of loans and deposits.
Suppose Horsham never had a bank, and I opened one with a �1,000,000
cash and within a few days I have loaned �1,000,000 on double security
at 7% 3-6 months maturity, and before the Bank closes next day the
�1,000,000 is re-deposited by transferred demand cheques. So I have only
loaned by cash capital of a �1,000,000. The Bank customers call it their
money. The bank then has a �1,000,000 of deposits liabilities due to the
depositors and assets of a �1,000,000 deposited cash and �2,000,000
lodged securities. The cash is the assets of the depositors. The lodged
security is the property of the bank. Legally the �2,000,000 belongs to
the Bank. So we march on and another �1,000,000 is loaned and in a
few hours is all back on deposit in my bank. Then the Bank?s liabilities
are �2,000,000 and the assets �2,000,000 double security. Namely
�1,000,000 cash and �3,000,000 of lodged covering.
The depositors now think they own �2,000,000 cash at the bank.
This �2,000,000 is circulated by cheque just as if it was real money. Now
as a banker I must furnish what I do not possess. Well by good luck,
good management and chance to secure that cash when wanted legally.
The �2,000,000 cash and all the assets belong to the bank. The depositors
�2,000,000 cash in the bank is a legal fiction. It is not there in trust, all
they possess is the right to demand cash. So week after week the
�1,000,000 is loaned and re-loaned until �20,000,000 of debts is due to
the Bank, all resting on the original �1,000,000 cash, and the securities
lodged by the borrowers, chequeing money, or deposits are created out
of securities lodged with the Bank with the help of the borrowers and
bankers of course, the bank \\ ill possess investments in bonds, inscribed
stock, Treasury issues, farm mortgages and industrial shares. The Bank
is now earning on the �20,000,000 loaned at 7% �1,400,000 per annum,
and this wonderful financial transformation has been done on �1,000,000
cash, lodged securities, increased loans and deposits.
The Commonwealth national income yearly is the total of the wages,
salary or income that all the people produce. When a man secures a loan
of �20,000 that creates �20,000 > basing power, and continues circu-
lating until cancelled by rede
From 9th May, 1901 to the slh October, 1911 ?lO years and 5
months, I fought single-handed to create the Commonwealth Bank. During
all that time, not one Member of Parliament, Labor, Liberal or
Conservative, could be persuaded to second the resolution for its creation,
and the only way I succeeded in getting my prepared Commonwealth
Bank scheme before the House was on the advise of the late Hon. Alfred
Deakin, then Prime Minister and prince of orators. I moved that it be
printed as a publfi document, and he accepted it. That?s how the Common-
wealth Bank scheme got before Parliament.
BRISBANE CONFERENCE, 1908.
In 1908 at Labor?s greatest conference, Brisbane, I got the scheme on
the fighting platform, and a Life Insurance Co. on the general platform.
In 1904 the Watson Labor Government opposed the Commonwealth Bank
scheme in its policy. In 1908 the first Fisher Government then founded
immediately after the Brisbane Labor Conference, would have no bank in
its policy. In 1910 the 2nd Fisher Government in which I was Minister
of Home Affairs, refused to put the banking' scheme in its policy.
FORCED COMMONWEALTH BANK POLICY, 1911.
Referring to the efforts of King O?Malley to establish a national
bank immediately after the formation of the Labor Government in 1910,
a bankers? conference was /held in Melbourne, which was attended by the
then Prime Minister and Attorney-General, Messrs. Fisher and H aghes.
Neither possessed any technical, financial hanking knowledge, an d were
easily convinced that there was no profit in banking. So the Treasurer
informed us that the note issue would be withdrawn from the trading
banks and placed in the Commonwealth Treasury. As the note issue is
the fundamental capital of a national bank, this meant the death of th>?
bank.
In accordance with this program, the Fisher Government in July,
1910, placed the note issue in the Treasury. Leaders of the Government
dropped the bank from their policy.
As the leaders of the Labor Government opposed the establishment of
a national bank, King O?Malley began to organise the rank and file of the
Party to force the Leaders to act in the matter. If King O?Malley had not
been a Minister, it would have been impossible for him to organise
successfully the rank and file of the Party for the bank.
TORPEDO BRIGADE.
It was at this stage that the ?Torpedo-Brigade? came into being.
The purpose of this group was to force the Labor Government to establish
a Commonwealth Bank. As leaders of the Government threatened to force
King O?Malley out of the Ministry if he persisted in his advocacy of the
Bank, the founder of the Commonwealth Bank was compelled to work in
secret. It was necessary, therefore, to give this secret organisation a name
that would give no hint of its purpose, hence the designation ?Torpedo-
Brigade?. Members of the Torpedo-Brigade did not intend to ?blow up?
the Labor Government as some politicians believed.
They were interested solely in forcing the Government to bring down
a Bill for a bank. King O?Malley Was the moving spirit of this group, but
he was actively supported by Dr. William Maloney, Chairman of the
Torpedo Brigade. After 15 months of secret organising among the Labor
Caucus, itself a secret group, enough members of the Labor Party had
promised support to make it reasonably safe to bring up the question of
a bank in Caucus. Members of the Torpedo Brigade decided that at
the meeting of the Caucus on October sth, 1911, whoever was called upon
by the Prime Minister for new business would move the adoption of s
hank bill by the Government. The honor fell on Hon. J. M. Chanter, and
Dr. Maloney seconded the motion. After a vigorous fight advocates of
the bank defeated the leaders of the Government and forced them to bring
down a bill for the bank. A few favoured the establishment of a
Commonwealth Bank because of the facilities it would give for taking over
the State debts. Since federation the question of the Commonwealth
Government taking over State debts had been under consideration. All
agreed that some time the Commonwealth Government would take over
State debts, but the particular time was undecided. Some people felt that
a Coinmonweallh Bank would facilitate the transference of Slate debts to
the Commonwealth, and thereby hasten the transaction. It was not until
1928 however, through the efforts of Dr. Earl Page, Commonwealth
Treasurer, at the time that the Commonwealth actually assumed the burden
of the State Debts. The following men in the Labor Party supported
King O?Malley in the Caucus ?W. G. Higgs, J. K. McDougall, G. Can,
Tom Brown, Dr. W. Maloney, J. M. Chanter, W. F. Finlayson, J. M.
Fowler, Frank Brennan, J. Matthews, F. J. Foster, J. A. Jensen, A. T.
Ozanne, W. Webster, E. Riley, Parker Maloney, J. H. Scullin, W. G.
Spence, F. W. Bamford, Frank Anstey, J. E. Fenton, L. Smith, Hugh De
Largie, Arthur Rae, R. K. Ready, Allen McDougall, D. J. O?Keefe and
Steven Barker. Among the opposition a few favoured setting up a
Commonwealth Bank. Agar Wynne, Sydney Sampson, John Livingston,
Hon. Sir Josiah Symon. The opposition in general strongly opposed a
Government Bank. One fact of the campaign for a Commonwealth Bank
merits attention. If King O?Malley had continued publicly advocating
a national bank, banks would have naturally prepared to block the
proposal from going into effect. As it was however, bankers, after the
conference with Government leaders in 1910, thought the matter settled.
The prolonged silence of King O?Malley seemed to confirm this view,
consequently when Caucus on October sth, 1911 voted for the Bank,
leaders of private banks were caught unprepared. It is very doubtful
if King O?Malley would have succeeded if he had not been silent.
From Dr. L. C. Jauncey?s (Harvard University) Australia?s Government Bank
Book, quoted in the House of Representatives on October 19, 1927, by Sir Earl Page,
the Commonwealth?s greatest constructive Treasurer.
SEPARATING THE GENERAL FROM THE
SAVINGS BANK.
In 1927 the Bruce Government on the advice of Sir Ernest Harvey, Bank
of England, separated the general bank from the savings bank. In
September, 1927, Dr. Earl Page, Commonwealth Treasurer, introduced a Bill
in the Commonwealth Parliament to separate the savings bank business
from the Commonwealth general bank.?
In 1927 Mr. Bruce?s Government became desirous of complet-
ing the work begun by the Act 1924 and it was announced that Sir
Ernest Harvey, Controller of the Bank of England, has been invited to
Australia to advise on the subject. Mr. Bruce at the same time reiterating
the oft-expressed wish of his Government that Australia should have a fully
operative Central Bank. But the proposal raised considerable criticism
in Labor quarters. Mr. Theodore, the Labor leader, said: ?If the institu-
tion became a mere reserve bank it would be a useful convenience to the
private banks and would cease to be a competitor. Indeed, the change
would enormously ?strengthen the political and strategic power of the
Associated Banks but it would lessen the independence of the Government
in monetary matters.? Sir Ernest Harvey?s most important desideratum of
the ideal Central Bank that ?it should not ordinarily compete with the trading
banks for general banking business? was unacceptable to the Australian
Labor Party and his other suggestions, that the Commonwealth Bank should
not engage in a general exchange business on its own account, for the
purpose of earning profits was equally irreconcilable with the Labor
view of the Bank?s functions. The relevance of the results of the recent
election will now be apparent.
If the Bruce Government had been returned it would have had to face
the problem of ?decommercialising? the Commonwealth Bank or erecting
a separate Reserve Bank. But now that the Government has been unseated,
it is clear that the whole Central Bank project may be shelved indefinitely,
and the Commonwealth Bank confirmed in its position as a competitive
institution. This, in most unbiassed minds, would be regarded as a
retrograde step. The reversal of a policy hesitatingly but consistently
pursued during the last five years would be regrettable from the point of
view not only of Australia but of other countries struggling with the same
problems in a similar environment, and it is to be hoped therefore that
the new Government will consider well the implications of its banking
proposals before casting to the winds the fruits of Australia?s recent and
valuable experience.
MONEY SHOULD NOT BE A PROMISE TO PAY.
Money should not be a promise to pay, but to receive. The most
vital point of monetary science is the operation of the credit money volume
Through these prices may be controlled a rise or fall produced or a rise or fall
from other reasons prevented. Power to control the credit and money volume


is power to do justice or injustice between debitor and creditor, worker and
employer, purchaser and seller, tenant and landlord, power to increase the
weight and value of every debt, private or public, power to produce pros-
perity or depressions, power to regulate industry and determine the distribu-
tions of wealth. Such power is an attribute to Sovereignty and should only
be exercised by the Sovereign people. The credit and money volume
should no longer be operated by blind chance and private financial
manipulation but under control of the Commonwealth Bank in the interest
of the public.
The moment people desert simple barter, the power to inflate begins.
Ibis power must always reside in civilised states which have ceased to use
barter. The big question is where shall it be trusted now this power rests
in the hands of untrained bank directors. Ricardo and all great economic
writers admit that those who increase and diminish at their will, the
currency, not alone note currency, but discount O/D. Cheques, credits
and coins possess the power to change prices at their pleasure. Today
pmate bank directors have this power. Mr. Bruce thinks in ordinary
matters the people can look after themselves, but on questions of finance
they must he kept under perpetual guardianship and be the wards of rich
Englishmen as in his opinion they are only babies.
Where industry creates and justice protects, prosperity dwells. A high
interest rate mortgage casts a dark cloud on the sunniest paddock. There
is no business under the sun that can pay 7% and prosper. Interest eats
day and night and the more it eats the hungrier it grows. The farmer
paying 7% on a mortgage debt lying awake at night can, if he listens,
hear it gnaw. If he is free he can hear the crops grow. Free yourselves
from debt as soon as possible, you have helped to keep idle avarice and
lazy economy long enough.
The Victorian Labor Party should follow the example of the
progressive party in Tasmania and do away with pre-selections and let
all candidates go to the poll. Thus they would secure scores of University
Graduates and the best trained brains in the country. Big talkers are never
deep thinkers or big ?doers?.
The Tobacco Trust profits for the year were �911,479 ?of this
amount the retailer does not receive 4 per cent. The Sugar Trust

THE COMMONWEALTH BANK.
After the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank started operations on
15th July, 1912, first Savings Bank accounts were:
(1) Andrew, Fisher, Prime Minister;
(2) C. W. Wren, Victorian Chairman, Associated Banks;
(3) King O?Malley, M.P.; Minister of State for Home Affairs.
When 1 asked Sir Dennison Miller why the General Commonwealth
Bank hadn?t been opened he said, ?iNo Capital!? 1 went to Tasmania, talked
to the Premier, brother Solomon (Liberal) and urged him to give tlic
Commonwealth Bank the Tasmanian Savings Bank Deposits (�1,250,000).
He consulted the Treasurer, brother Payne?later Commonwealth Senator,
Sir Dennison Miller got the Bank and on January 20th, 1913, the Com-
monwealth Bank General Bank opened. Little ?I'assy?s? Savings Bank
did trie job. What a mighty financial river has sprung from a little
mountain spring. A Tasmanian M.P., King O?Malley, created the Com-
monwealth Bank. ?Tassy?s? money started it. Although past my
?eightieth? year, 1 shall be a candidate for Corio next Election and 1
promise that before the Campaign ends the Treasurer will learn more
auout the financial power of the Commonwealth Bank to finance this
debitor nation than he ever did while in London from ?old man
Montague?. 1 believe God has kept me alive and healthy to save the
Commonwealth Bank. The Parliamentary House of Representatives
opposition has become so timid through association with these self-made
Nabobs that it reminds me of a Rocky Mountain bear who hibernates all
the Winter.
On the slh October, 1911, after a mighty
Caucus Battle, we defeated the Conservative section of the Labor Party
headed by Fisher, Hughes and all the Ministry except myself by one vote.
Then all the Ministers had to carry out the caucus orders and create the
Commonwealth Bank or leave the Party. On the creation of the Common-
wealth Bank the Prime Minister tried to secure a Governor in Melbourne
but no banker would bite. I tried a tew of these egotists and was urged
to secure a public servant from the Treasury, as it was staled that the
Bank would only be a branch of the Public Service. Now after 27
years of the Commonwealth Bank?s operations under guidance of highly
trained Bankers, the Commonwealth Government, in obedience to the
wishes of the Creditor Nations? Banking Monopoly, has appointed a
Public Treasury Servant Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who is as
free from banking training, banking knowledge and banking experience
as the Government is from ideas. That which the Trading Bankers wanted
us to do 27 years ago the Government of today has done for them and the
Commonwealth Bank is now merely a receiving agency. No doubt the
Government will have a sign hung on the Commonwealth Bank to that
effect shortly.
Surely the Government must know that the Commonwealth Bank
should be operated by the ablest Bankers in its service? As Governor, how
can a public servant tell his banking staff what to do in banking
operations? A public servant can no more speak for bankers than a
bank clerk can speak for lawyers or a journalist can speak for doctors. Think
of all the great Bankers on the Commonwealth Bank staff, trained to
finance a debitor nation, passed over. The late Sir Dennison Miller, our
greatest Banker, told me that brother Armitage, now Deputy Governor
of the Commonwealth Bank was the greatest banker in the Commonwealth
and his right hand bower. Why was he turned down? Oh, Why ? Ask
old man Montague why do all our political financial Lilipulians toady to
the banking monopoly bosses of the creditor nations, whose only object is
to collect their interest and dividends? If the Commonwealth or the
Argentine wanted �20,000,000 next week, the Agentine �20,000,000 would
be quickly taken by these bankers while the Commonwealth could wait.
Money knows no country or flag ?only security. If the Government, before
ere mation in 18 months, sells transfers or delivers the Commonwealth
BanK to Debenture buyers, the next Government will smash all laws
created and return the Commonwealth Bank to the people. If the Deben-
ture buyers appeal to the High Court and win, the Court must be
democratised by a few more modern judges and the decision will be
reversed. A Bank Bill will repeal Bruce?s Act, dividing the Common-
wealth Bank into general and savings banks, abolishing the present
~Bolu. ey? Bank Board, as it is: frequently described, and replacing
it with six bankers of the Commonwealth Bank Staff with the Under
Treasurer representing the Governmentand Professor Melvill as banking
economist. The new Bank Board shall
have no connection with any business, but the Commonwealth Bank, nor
the Directors of any private trustee companies (similar to the position of
two of its present members), and shall encourage the Commonwealth Bank
to finance small producers and traders. It must do business with all who
possess security, irrespective of what bank the applicant does business with.
Fhe people own the Commonwealth Bank and should not be prevented
from domg business with their own Bank by an outside Board. The Act
will transtcr from the Government to the Commonwealth Bank Board the
power to select the Governor and Deputy Governor, thus doing away with
rotten politics in the Commonwealth Bank life. Only a banker of the
staff can be appointed. Branches will be opened throughout the Common-
wealth and business done with its Shareholders. The Commonwealth
Bank will operate trusts for charitable and public purposes (Clause 62a).
The bank shall have power to accept any trust for charitable or public
purposes only and to perform and discharge all the accounts and duties of
a trustee for charitable or public purposes only as fully and effectively as
a private individual may when appointed such a trustee. Why should the
financiers of a debitor Dominion like the Commonwealth be guided by the
advice of the banking monopolies of creditor nations. Lambs in the care of
wolves, sucking calves in the care of lions. What a comparison like
a singed rat to a Bengal tiger. Hon. Mitchell Hepburn, Premier of
Ontario, Canada, a debitor Dominion, came here to study how the
Commonwealth Bank financed this debitor Dominion (Canada and the
Commonwealth are Debitor Nations).
Brother Hepburn came not to learn from our political financiers, but
to examine the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet the institution
that attracted him would not now be in existence if these creatures could
strangle it. I fought ten years and six months single handed to create
the Commonwealth Bank. Not one Member, Labor, Liberal nor Conser-
vative would second the Creation Resolution on all the Budgets of
ten years. Men moving on big ideas like a Commonwealth Bank could
not have waited from May 9th, 1901 (the opening of Commonwealth
Parliament) to October sth, 1911, without speaking on its prospective
merits. I will pay �lO charity you may r, ame if Hansard shows
one speech made in favor of the creation of the Commonwealth Bank by
any of my Ministerial colleagues, Fisher, Hughes, Pearce, Thomas and
the rest between 9th May, 1901 and October sth, 1911 ?Caucus Battle
Day. If the Commonwealth Bank had been a failure the ?Damned
Yankie?, as they called me, would have got all the blame. The late Hon.
Agar Wynn decided to put �50,000 in Trust and allow it to accumulate
for twenty-one years (when it would amount to about �125,000) for
University Scholarships (half for boys and half for girls). He phoned
one of the ?Baloney? Directors of the Commonwealth Bank who assured
him the Commonwealth Bank would not operate the Trust, though for
public purposes, he objected to private Trustee Companies making divi-
dends for shareholders by operating charitable funds and the fund was not
established.
In order to convince the owners of the Commonwealth Bank how the
people will benefit by turning the Commonwealth Bank into a Bank of
Bankers, will the Board publish how much of the �763,000 profit made by
the Commonwealth Bank in the last six months of 1938 came from business
done with the Trading Banks. I venture to state not 5 per cent. The
Trading Banks? business to the Commonwealth Bank is not worth thinking
over. Where there is any possible profit the Banks hold on for the
shareholders. How can the Commonwealth Bank advance the people?s
interest when the ?Boloney? Bank Board will not allow it to accept any
customers doing business with the Trading Banks, no matter how tangible
the security may be?
Monpoly is just as much a tax on the people as are the Govern-
ment taxes. If high taxes have checked business, so have high monopoly
While travelling in another country I met with bankers on their
way to a Bankers? Conference. While they knew little about Australia,
they knew much about the Commonwealth lank and asked many questions
about the Commonwealth Bank?s creation and how many Labor men
attended the Caucus. I told them 71. One Banker said what were the
Australian Bankers thinking about when 71 thousand dollars would have
killed the Commonwealth Bank. I assured him 71 million dollars
on that day could not stop the creation of the Commonwealth Bank.
The Commonwealth Board should be composed of Bankers from the
staff of the Bank itself, trained in the complex' operation of scientific
banking. There is not one trained banker on the present ?Bolony? Bank
Board, most of whose members were unsympathetic with its creation.
A Board of Commomvealth Bank bankers would finally organise and
base the Commonwealth credit on the financial operations of the producing,
trading and consuming interests of the Commonwealth. The Common-
wealth Bank would furnish the need for more modern banking methods
by a general regulation of the movement of the credit and money volume.
Such provisions will mean, in effect, that for the future there cannot
be a credit famine or financial crisis again so long as people have good
exchangeable securities. If the demand for nationally-guaranteed credits
becomes acute the Commonwealth Bank would meet it by exercising its
reserved financial powers. The Commonwealth Bank must be made the
custodian of all Trustee reserves. It could meet emergencies by re-
discounting for Trading Banks and private corporations and the amount
of such re-discounts would be placed to their credit in the deposit account.
When I created the Commonwealth Bank, its essential function was to
watch and encourage the agricultural, industrial, pastoral, mineral and
commercial development of the Commonwealth by constantly supplying
fortified credits for legitimate uses. The Commonwealth Bank must
possess legal power to regulate the rate of interest on all loans and
discounts. The Commonwealth Bank must have exclusive financial power
to expand financial operations.
One of the chief obligations of the Commonwealth Bank Governor
should be to study the financial condition of foreign markets, watch the
ebb and flow of fortified credits between the cities and the country
requirements and, if necessary, face the demand of credits and thus the
Commonwealth Bank could keep the Commonwealth from financial and
commercial troubles.
COMMONWEALTH BANK MUST OPERATE
CHARITABLE TRUSTS.
While the late Sir Ernest Riddle was Governor of the Commonwealth
Bank, 1 wrote to him offering to put �3O,QJO in a Trust for charitable and
public purposes, to accumulate tor 21 years and �20,000 more just before
starting on my immortal flight. 80 per cent, of the accumulations was
to be in annual prizes of �5/5/- each tor girls under 25 years who proved
themselves the best all-round home-makers, young women who could make
a home so charming and attractive that it would be hard to leave. The
world?s great women are the good housewives the home providers. The
difference between civilisation and savagery is the civilised wife prepares
breakfast the night before while the savage wife next morning hunts for
a lizard or snake, and if she misses?no breakfast! The ?Boloney? Bank
Board turned my proposals down and if I pass on before the next election,
ray estate will pass over to the New Zealand Government, where there is a
Public Trustee. Waste no time and stamps telling how 1 can spend
my ?bit? ?my mind on this question is settled.
Experience is the only school in the world where the students have
no vacations.
BRUCE AND THE BANK.
Had the Bruce Government won the Election 1929 according to the
?Economist?, of England, October 20lh, 1929 the Commonwealth
Bank would have been decommercialised and all the customers
of the Commonwealth Bank would have had to transfer to the Trading
Banks on their terms at a rate of at least �2O a thousand more interest
per annum.
1 i t r, i i ii. a rt n
The Commonwealth Bank would have been reduced to a ?one-floor?
financial skeleton to supply the peoples savings to the Trading Banks? great
Bank ot Bankers. Only financial mental ?crack-pots? talk of making the
Commonwealth Bank a bank of bankers. What kind of business could a
bank of bankers nnd to do in the Commonwealth where there are no
acceptance houses, no bill markets, no re-discounting establishments and
no living active operating bank finance. Our political nincoompoops
should be mentally examined. What a great favour the Governments think
they are doing for the farmers in paying a few pounds of their debts.
If laws had been passed making it a crime to charge over 4 per cent, per
annum instead ot the high rates, the farmers would not owe a penny.
Read the wills in the daily papers to see how little the average farmer
leaves after years of hard work with the assistance of his family �2,000
to �5,000 while the city ?interest gatherer? leaves behind him �50,000
or �lOO,OOO.
AGRICULTURAL, PASTORaL AND MINERAL
INDUSTRIES.
The big question to the agricultural, pastoral, mineral, industrial
and commercial operators of Australia is: Can the Commonwealth
voters elect any men courageous, capable and financially trained to put
elect any men courageous and capable and financially trained to put
the Commonwealth Bank by law where it can do the people?s economic
job producing benefits visible and tangible and to facilitate the nation?s
financial progress?
When the Commonwealth Bank is allowed, after the next election, to'
do business with its shareholders, the people:
(1) The Commonwealth Bank must enable the small producers and
traders to borrow at low rates of interest on good security.
(2) It will enable the small producers and traders to rely with
assurance on a rate interest uniformly about 4%.
(3) The Commonwealth Bank must always protect the small pro-
ducers and traders against the sudden demand for the reduction
of overdrafts by private banking combinations at the very time
when they need it most, subjecting them to the inconveniences
and worries of financial crises conditions.
(4) It must enable the Commonwealth manufacturers to purchase
raw material, convert it into finished products, and transport
those goods to foreign markets on terms as favourable in respect
to credit as those obtained by their foreign competitors.
BANK OF FRANCE?S LOW INTEREST.
It will prove both instructive and interesting to review the history
of the rate of interest of the Bank of France during recent years as an
emphatic illustration of the id." ' vhich the Commonwealth Bank
should be compelled to oper r
At the Bank of Frar erest fixed on 19th May, 1892
was 2V 2 % for commen emained unchanged for nearly
three years. It was tl March, 1895 to 2%. The rate
of interest during the South African War rose as high as 4Vi*% for brief
intervals but on 25th May, 1900, the rate of interest was fixed at 3% and
remained unchanged for 7 years until the approach of the 1907 American
Financial Crisis led to some gradual advances to 4%.
The Commonwealth Bank has kept 4%% as its rate for years and
when it is managed by a Staff Bank Board it will be less. The Common-
wealth Bank will be able to prevent financial slumps owing to its opera-
tion of the note issue. The Commonwealth Bank will enable the borrowers
to demand more fortified credits at a yearly rate of low interest. It will
prevent paralysing financial crises which only bring ruin and starvation
to thousands. Commonwealth producers and traders will be relieved from
many of the impediments which they suffer through the want of a
Government Banking System.
If they create better economical methods of production, more efficient
machinery, mor.e modern transportation methods and a well-organised
system of distribution these advantages would no longer be neutralised by
the defects of high rates of interest. The Commonwealth Bank will
substitute Production, Trade and Commerce Banking for Stock-Gambling
Banking. In all foreign nations, changes in the discount rate of interest
are determined by the demand for legitimate business credits. In
Australia, on the contrary, it is the demand for money for speculation
enterprises which determines the rate of interest to borrowers. It is the
London rate of interest for call loans which is the governing factor in the
Australian rate of interest and which settles whether the demand be
granted or refused. This harmful system of finance must be abolished
by the Commonwealth Bank, principally by the exclusion of Gambling
Loans from business and partly by giving greater negotiability to Produc-
tion, Trade and Commerce Security. The Commonwealth Bank must
never be a competitor in the loaning market for the encouragement of
speculators. Its great financial powers must be confined to the services
of Production, Trade and Commerce and the distribution of the wealth
of the Commonwealth. In some cities; Bills of Exchange drawn by
creditors on debitors, when accepted or endorsed by acceptance houses
are quickly saleable to other investors, thus continually keeping the
purchasing currency circulating.
When the Commonwealth Bank System is free from the present
?Boloney? Board it will adopt a progressive policy of re-discounts and
encourage the universal use of Acceptance Bills, regulate the Foreign
Exchange and sell Foreign Bills of Exchange, and create a
volume of Fortified Exchangeable Organised Commercial Securities which
would enable the Australian credit money market to stop being the
reflection of the whims and follies of Stock Exchange Gambling all over
the world but instead be the index of the demand for funds by honest
producing constructive business interests. The ?Bolony? Bank Board is
gradually crippling the general Commonwealth Bank. The Common-
wealth Bank system must be made a real financial democracy.
The direct function of the Commonwealth Bank should be restricted
to assisting in the production, transportation and distribution of com-
modities of general utility. It will then produce greater stability of
financial conditions on the investments of capital in fixed forms. The
Bank?s funds must be restricted to the Producing, Trading and Consuming
Interests of the Commonwealth, which transform raw material into finished
products.
The operations of the Commonwealth Bank scheme must extend to
the principle of pure democracy from political science to the national
financial system. It would no longer be under the baneful influences of
the present ?Boloney Bank Board?. It will be a fighting financial
democracy which comes to the Commonwealth Bank through the
representative system by which the influence of the humblest citizen
in Australia measures up through his power of ownership in the
Commonwealth Bank to the highest aviator of finance. Through the
substitution of Production, Trade and Commerce Banking for the present
Speculative Banking System the tendency of such a banking system would
be to limit the power of the money monopoly.
DEBITOR AND CREDITOR NATIONS.
Unless there are more debitor nations than creditor nations to whom
will the creditor nations lend the stacked-up capital, gathered from the
sweat of the world?s producers and small traders. Britain, America, France
and Holland are the great creditor nations. All these nations want to
keep Australia a debitor nation but not so high as to endanger their
securities nor reduce the value of the British mortgage on the Common-
wealth people of over �500,000,000.
?OLD MAN MONTAGUE.?
Why do all those Boloney Bankers keep in touch with ?old man
Montague?, and if he smiles on any of them they return to Australia,
self-made bankers with swelled heads. They are not aware that Australia?s
Trading Banking System was founded on agricultural technique the
bullock dray and the stage coach and is still operated on these ancient
lines. Since the coming of the Commonwealth Bank they became slightly
more modernised.
THE COMMONWEALTH BANK SEES AUSTRALIA
THROUGH THE GREAT WAR.
When Britain entered the War in 1914, there was a run on the banks
but next day Sir Dennison Miller announced that the Commonwealth
Bank would stand behind the Trading Banks no more runs!
If I had failed to create the Commonwealth Bank, where could the
people have found a bank to finance the War from 1914 to 1919? ?1 he
Commonwealth Bank floated �350,000,000 to finance the War at J /4 of 1%.
Without the Commonwealth Bank Flotation the interest rate would have
been 3% and the extra cost in the interest bill �10,000,000. The World
War sent 65,000,000 men into mobilization. It resulted in the killing of
8,543,000 soldiers. It piled up total casualities of 37,500,000. It toppled
thrones and remade the map of the globe. It filled many countries with
widows and orphans and cripples. It laid waste proud cities and sweet
hamlets, ft cost directly, so the experts say, in the neighborhood of three
hundred billion dollars.
Surely our great soldiers will not allow the Government to transfer
the People?s Bank to private monopolies.
The Commonweatlh Bank protected the Commonwealth Producers
from financial ruin by financing all the war time pools, wheat, wool, meat,
butter and others. It paid Hughes? Ships (costing �8,000,000), met the
soldiers in the battle-fields of the war and helped them jn every way.
Since the War closed the Commonwealth Bank has provided
�1,500,000 for fruit pools, �4,000,000 for building homes, �9,000,000 for
municipal government bodies, �3,000,000 to consolidated revenue and
�4,500,000 to the redemption of debts. Sir Dennison Miller provided
over �400,000,000 during war troubles and often said he could do the same
for production, trade and commerce.
WORLD DEPRESSION.
Since the foundation of the Commonwealth Bank it has made
�32,000,000 net profit. Had the Commonwealth Bank not made this sum
it would have had to borrow it from the Capitalistic Combine at 5%.
In 1920 a conference of World?s Banking Monopolies, among them
being ?Old Man Montague,? met in Brussels. Later in the same
year the Banking Monopolies started their policy of restricted credits or
deflation in order to raise the value of currency of all kinds high enough
to give their monopoly control of it, and thus enable them to secure the
real wealth of the nations for themselves. In the winter of 1920-21 the
price levels were falling alarmingly.
Price levels are governed by bank policy and not by the so-called law
of supply and demand, for the simple reason that both demand and supply
are themselves controlled by financial considerations. The Australian
Trading Banks commenced to follow the example set by the banks abroad,
but Sir Denison Miller brought the Commonwealth Bank quickly to
the rescue of the threatened people. Partly by purchasing Commonwealth
and other Government Securities and partly by increasing advances, he
released between, June and December, 1920, �23,000,000 of additional
currency as a slight hint as to what he would do if necessary and deflation
was deferred. In other words, the Commonwealth Bank prevented a
depression hi 1920 and gave the clearest proof that Australia is not bound
to follow the banking policy of creditor nations. There is no doubt that
had Sir Denison Miller lived there would have been no depression in
1929 and 1931 either, and it is easy to see why the Trading Banks watched
the progress of the Commonwealth Bank with ill-conceived rage and fear.
1938 CONVERSION LOAN.
The Commonwealth Bank is now carrying nearly �12,000,000 of
the 1938 Conversion Loan in addition to New Money in 1939. Where
would the present Government have found this money without the
assistance of the Commonwealth Bank?


Broadside 513
A ?SAVING? v. A ?LIVING? WAGE
As the rise of the human race depends on the workers, I favour a
saving instead of a living wage, as the workers are the great purchasing
power.
Business can be prosperous only as its employees, who are the living
buyers, are themselves prosperous. If business pays good wages it
automatically pays itself good dividends; and it pays for more work, as it
has peace in industry by paying the wages of contentment. And it
positively swells the total credits in the Savings Banks.
In paying a saving wage, business wastes no capital. It is attracting
fresh brains in the use of capital. The workers? savings are loaned by the
Banks to men of business vision who create gre at industrial activities.
Good wages are not charity, it is putting the workers brains into business.
It is recruiting new investing intelligence in the nation?s business. How
much less ocial unrest would worry the world if all the workers were
made capitalists or small partners in business corporations, paying annual
dividends. The saving wage is a mighty social advance and a supreme
business investment. The function of fortified credit is to store surplus
wealth, as water is stored in reservoirs or electric current in a battery, to
be drawn as required. The joint function of money and credit is to ensure
a rapid and continuous exchange of wealth, keep it flowing simultaneously
in all directions at a uniform pressure, as water in a system of supply
pipes. Yet here surplus wealth cannot immediately be either converted
or stored under government supervision as collateral for negotiable
certificates.
The Commonwealth Bank employs over five thousand people. Surely
they possess the same right to earning their living as the employees of the
Trading Banks. Rest assured that the ?Boloney? Bank Board will walk
out on their pink ear after the next election. I am not trying to reason
with the three ?B?s? because reasoning with men who have renounced their
reason is like administering medicine to a dead Indian.
Australia possesses no national warehouse but draws from a high
wealth main and possesses no reservoirs. After a time of scarcity in some
products there comes a season when wealth overflows the bushel basket,
the goods car, cellar bin and the shopkeepers? shelves. Then the work of
creating wealth is checked, nobody knows what anything is worth and all
want to sell before prices fall. Yet this is an opportunity to forestal the
future. There are now labopr and materials to spare for the work of
creating in suitable producing localities great warehouses and reservoirs
where surplus wealth may be stored and valued. Australia needs silos
for storing surplus grain at low cost for indeterminate periods. Why not
construct them? The branch railroads are years behind in upkeep. Idle
labour utilised to these ends would be surplus labour stored in the same
way as wool in warehouses and grain in silos. As soon as these things
are done the sooner the normal flow of commodities would be resumed.
ORIGINAL PROPOSALS IN FIRST FEDERAL
PARLIAMENT.
On May 9th, 1901, the First Federal Parliament opened and I gave the
Old Age Pensions notice of motion and later moved it the first ever
moved in the Commonwealth Parliament; also the Commonwealth Bank
and National Note Issue motion. On July 19th, 1901, I moved in
Parliament that the Government must secure not less than 1,000 square
miles of land as Federal Territory (the freehold of which shall for ever
remain the property of all the people). Hon. Hume Cook, Victoria,
seconded it, Hon. W. Wilks, N.S.W., and the Hon. Austin Chapman,
N.S.W., .spoke for the motion. The Right Hon. Edmond 'Barton, Prime
Minister thanked me for moving so important a resolution at the beginning
of the Commonwealth Parliament, which forever stopped all greedy specu-
lation in land made available by the expenditure of money contributed by
the taxpayers of Australia. He accepted the motion in a modified form.
That?s why the people control 593,000 acres at Canberra to-day land
which can never be sold without an Act of Parliament.
No doubt before long some financial and political barbarians in the
service will move to sell. When Canberra?s population reaches 50,000
the ground rent will be sufficient to pay the annual cost of Parliament
without having to call on the Australian taxpayers for a penny. I called
for the designs, laid the city out, purchased most of the property (secured
at less than �4 an acre) as Minister of State for Horae Affairs Administer-
ing the Territory.
High Taxation is the Boomerang the Workers Are at the Wealthy,
and in the rebound the Wealthy spread it over the Workers.
RURAL CREDITS
In 1917 I moved the creation of the Rural Credits as a branch of
the Commonwealth Bank. (See Hansard, Page 11,096.)
NAMING THE FEDERAL CAPITAL.
Despite continued efforts to claim the honour of opening the
Federal Capilal, that honour rightly belongs to the Fisher Government.
On Wednesday, ,12th March, 1913 the members of that Government
were: Hon. Andrew Fisher, Prime Minister; Hon. W. M. Hughes, Attor-
ney-General; Hon. Josiah Thomas, Minister of External Affairs; Hon.
George Pearce, Minister of Defence; Hon. King 0 Malley, Minister of
State for Home Affairs; Hon. Edward Findley, Honorary Minister and
Colonel David Miller, Administrator of Federal Territory.
The naming of the Federal Capital was performed by Her Excellency
Lady Denman, following the laying of the foundation stones. fhe
greatest interest was manifested as Mrs. King O?Malley, wife of the
Minister of State for Home Affairs, ascended the dais and handed Lady
Denman a gold case containing the official name of the Capital and
said: ??Your Excellency, permit me to present to you on behalf of the
Commonwealth Government this gold case containing the official name of
Australia?s Capilal, which you will now honor us by christening.? With
due ceremony and with a clear resonant voice Her Ladyship said: ?I
officially name the capital Canberra.? Loud cheers following the an-
nouncement. His Excellency Lord Denman, Australia?s Governor-General,
then publicly declared Canberra the official Capital.
Fourteen years later the Bruce Government officially opened Parlia-
ment (which occurs every year), but owing to timidity, the Labor
opposition in the House of Representatives seem really afraid to claim
the honor of having officially opened the last Capital of the great Com-
monwealth Dominion by a Labor Government in 1913. Now we see the
continual announcement in the papers that the Bruce Government officially
opened Canberra in 1927, without a word of protest from the House
of Representatives Dumb-bells. I have great hopes of the three new
Senators from Victoria, Brothers Keane, Cameron and Sheehan, born
fighters, both in and out. These Australians may save the situation. I
trust that good and patriotic Australians will swear by the altars of their
gods, the tombs of their ancestors, and the cradles of their children, that
they will never vote for Parli sentt *andidates men whose secret mission
is to destroy the Commonwealth Bank and whose brains if extracted, dried
and placed in the quill of a cock-sparrow and blown into the eye of a flea
would not even make him wink.
?SCOTS WAH HAE!?
One of Wallace?s lineal descendants is the ?Roosevelt of Queensland,?
champion of the struggling masses rights and Premier of the Northern
State since 1932 (Hon. Forgan Smith). While conversing with a number
of patriotic Australian Irishmen, who appreciated his sterling qualities,
one of them said to me that ?as a leader to any Party, a Scotchman was
worth 30 per cent, more than an Irishman and under the leadership of
Forgan Smith a sweeping victory awaits the Party in the next Federal
Elections.
CONCLUSION.
In conclusion 1 want to thank the great Parliamentary Journalists,
who helped me with their reports to create a Bank atmosphere and change
public opinion to its favour Brothers B. S. B. Cook, F. J. Whitehead,
Rae (editor, Melbourne ?Herald? )G. Cockrell, W. J. Buchanan, R. Austin,
C. Borland, Keith Murdoch, L. E. Sweet (Melbourne ?Age?), C. P. Smith
and W. Hurst (Melbourne ?Argus?), H. W. Peters and J. Tinning (Sydney
?baily Telegraph?), A. S. Whyle and J. E. Davenport (Sydney ?Morning
Herald? and J. V. Biggs, of ?The Age.?
I want to congratulate the ?New Times?, Melbourne, for their noble
effort to preserve the Bank and make it what its founders intended it to be.
While Minister of State for Home Affairs the following officials
rendered me great service in creating the Commonwealth Bank. Sir
George Knibbs, Statistician; H. A. Hunt, Meteorologist; W. D. Bingle,
Clerk; Colonel P. T. Owen, Director-General of Works; J. S. Murdoch,
Architect; J. T. H. Goodwin, Land and Property Officer; H. L. Walters,
Accountant; W. A. Newman, Senior Clerk (afterwards Naru Administra-
tor) ; R. C. Oldham (Chief Electoral Officer), and W. A. Wadsworth,
Librarian; Wickens (Statistician). Brothers Newman and Wadsworth
were specialists in hunting up authorities on Banking. To all who helped
me create the Commonwealth Bank I am deeply grateful. Many have
passed on, but they left behind Australia?s most world-renowned institution
and were benefactors of humanity.

An examination of these figures will show that while the trading banks are
increasing their profits annually the Commonwealth Bank is either at a standstill or
falling back.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank for the half-year December, 1938, earned
as net profits �155,342 and the deposits were �145,462,974. The Commonwealth
Bank earned �763,600, the net profit being �170,947. The Rural Credits made
�141,180 and the Note Issue �423,131.

NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY INSURANCE
Reprinted from ?The Age.?
History, so it is said, repeats itself. It is apparent that Brothers
Menzies and Stewart have parted company over the establishment of a
national social security scheme. On the 4th October, 1911, I submitted
to my Federal colleagues the draft of a proposed bill to establish a
national insurance department. My friends immediately became seized
with a mental and spiritual paralysis, and Caucus developed such an
attack of political shivers that I was forced to abandon my proposal rather
than risk the loss of the Commonwealth Bank proposals which were then
being discussed. Some of the Labor men who opposed my scheme have
since ended their days in very straitened circumstances, and no doubt
regretted too late their ill-advised action. When Minister of State for
Home Affairs in the Fisher Ministry I held many consultations with the
late Sir George Knibbs, a great scholar and administrator, about my
Insurance Bill. We called in leading insurance actuaries and decided that
it was most desirable to create a social security scheme based upon
compulsory contributions from the wages of the small, from the salary of
the big, and from the incomes of the rich, collected in the same way and
manner as our present unemployment taxes are collected by Brother
Chenoweth, who treats taxpayers impartially. Provision was made for
people to contribute above the amount of their legal obligations so as to
derive greater benefits upon retiring.
Australia?s population to-day of 6,800,000 is increasing at the rate
of 80,000 per year. Assuming that it was decided to fix contributions at
sixpence per head per week, this would represent a weekly return of
�170,000, or �8,840,000 per year. Let us increase the compulsory
contribution to 1/- per head per week by proportionate increases in the
higher salaries, and we secure an annual income of �17,680,000, with an
extra �707,200 for interest thereon at 4 per cent. If we only paid out on
unemployment and sickness for the first few years we would then have
established such a strong reserve fund that we could start paying pensions
at sixty years of age. Reserve and rotary funds would be created to
provide for unemployment, sickness and widows and orphans. I figured
on a minimum pension of �3 per week upon reaching the age of sixty years
with, of course, higher rates in accordance with the compulsory contribu-
tions made to the fund. My scheme is the only one that makes it
impossible for any human being, after a few years, to he poor.
Out of our present population of 6,800,000 how many are in a
position to exist without work? How many thousands of hard workers
have no earthly hope of providing anything for old age or education
for their family? How many thousand clerks, men and women? How
many school teachers, professors of universities, public schools and
colleges ever make enough to provide for old age? These people do not
belong to the money-making class, yet they are the leaders of our educa-
tional and cultural atmosphere. How many rich men to-day will be poor
twenty years hence? All would be provided for under my scheme which,
at the end of one generation, would banish poverty in Australia and make
capital the servant of man and humanity the master and not the reverse
as at present. If the Government to-day were as well organised as I
organised my Home Affairs department whilst Minister there would be
no difficulty in placing all of those seeking honest labor. Unfortunately
twenty-six years ago my Ministerial colleagues lacked vision, and the
prophet Isaiah said, ?Where there is no vision the people perish.? I found
them as hopeless on the insurance scheme as on the creation of the
Commonwealth Bank. The Scriptures declare that ?he who is greatest
shall be the servant of all? so the Commonwealth being the greatest must
indeed become our servant and see that there is no such thing as poverty
and hunger in the land.?KlNG O?MALLEY, founder of the Common-
wealth Bank.
Hon. Sir earl Page & the C. B.
(Letter to Sir Earle Page by the Hon. King O?Malley 6/10/27.)
Hon. Dr. Earle Page, M.P. 6/10/27.
Treasurer,
Commonwealth of Australia,
CANBERRA. N.S.W.
My Dear Dr. Earle Page,
I have read with great sorrow the report of your second reading speech
of the amending Commonwealth Bank Bill in which you declare lor the
separation of the Savings Bank from the General Bank, Rural Credits and
Note Issue. If the Commonwealth Bank is shorn of the Savings Bank so far
as the balance-sheet goes, then its financial greatness in foreign Countries,
especially in America where you have opened an Agency, is a thing of the past.
I have noticed criticisms in many American papers and magazines lauding
the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as possessing resources expressed in its
balance-sheet of 700,000,000 Dollars making it the greatest Bank south of
the Equator and ranking in importance next to the National City Bank of
New York, the greatest Bank on the American Continent.
It is on the strength of this great Institution with its tremendous wealth,
representing Australian financial power, that the American Group Banks, who
underwrite loans, pass them off to the general public.
By eliminating the Savings Bank Balance-sheet, the 700,000,000 Dollars
will be reduced to about 475,000,000 Dollars or thereabouts as the Common-
wealth Banks resources, making the Bank of less importance than several of
the Australian Trading Banks.
How will you explain that a Bank which opened its New York branch
with its resources standing at 700,000,000 Dollars, has financially degenerated
into this comparatively insignificant position? It has already been acclaimed
by the American public as a great sound financial organisation. I am afraid
that any explanation offered will not he regarded as satisfactory.
Doctor, have the little political Australian antiquarians with financial
mosquito lineal descendants of Balaam?s Ass, devoid of all the physcho-
logical attainments of their illustrous progenitor, forced you, the man from
Grafton, possessing the big financial constructive mind, to he the first to destroy
Australia?s big and world-renowned financial organisation?
Australia at present possesses two world-famed institutions, celebrated
throughout the Universe Madame Melba and the Commonwealth Bank.
Now you are destroying the one, and the dust of ages threatens to over-
whelm the other.
With kind regards to Mrs. Page and the five leaflets.
I remain cordially yours,
KING O?MALLEY.
Dear Doctor,
You promised me you would arrange that the Commonwealth Bank shall
operate monies left for Charitable or public purposes. If you can fix this it
will ease my mind before I meet the final dissolution.
K. O?M.
