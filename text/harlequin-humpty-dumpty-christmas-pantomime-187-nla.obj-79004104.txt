SINGER?S SEWING MACHINES.
SEWING MACHINE SALES.
THE official Returns of Sales made during the year 1873
by the leading Manufacturers of the world again
testify to the unrivalled popularity enjoyed by the Sewing
Machines of The Singee Manupactueing Compact.
This increase in the Company?s Sales has been truly
marvellous, as will be at once perceived when it is stated
x that in the four years, 1870, 1871, 1872, and 1873 respec-
: i tively, The SINGER COMPANY sold 127,833, 181.260,
/ 219,758, and 232,444 Machines.
These figures are in themselves remarkable, but they
become still more so when compared with those of the
returns made by the other principal Companies as under:
The SINGER MANUFACTURING
In 1872. In 1873.
COMPANY sold 219,758 232,444
Wheelee & Wilson Co.
Geotee & Baker Co.
Weed Co.
Willcox & Gibbs Co.
B, P. Howe S. M. Co.
? 174,088 119,190
? 52,010 36,179
? 42,444 21,769
? 33,639 15,881
? 13,919
It will thus be seen that the Singer Manufacturing
Company?s Sales in 1873 exceeded those of any other
Company for the same period by 113,254 Machines ; or, in
other words, that they were nearly
DOUBLE THE SALES OF ANY COMPETITOR.
But the most remarkable fact in connection with
these statistics is that
THE SALES OE OTHER COMPANIES IN 1873
WERE LESS THAN IN 1872,
WHEEEAS
k THE SALES OF THE SINGER COMPANY SHOW A LARGE
INCREASE.
It will hardly bo denied that these facts fully de-
kgjratc the superiority of the ?SINGER? Machines,
been acknowledged to combine in the
requisites, Speed, Accuracy, and

With Yankee patent mixtures, then Dutch Drops ;

[Christmas whispers to the rest.
Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds,
Baked in a pie,
When the pie was opened,


The birds began to sing,
Wasn?t that a dainty dish
To set before the King ?
The King was in his counting house,
Counting out his money,
The Queen was in her parlour,
Eating bread and honey,
The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes,
Down popped a black-bird,
And peeked off her nose.
N. Year To that we?ll add, to make the job complete,
Another well known ballad I?ll repeat.
XU Hey diddle diddle, the oat and the fiddle.
The cow jumped over the moon,
The little cdog laughed to see such sport,
And thej dish ran after the spoon.
y, Aus. Mind that?s a pronnise ? lots of fun.
Xu All right 1
Y. Aus. Hi! gee-up Briseisi. I?ll be there to-night. [Exit.
Boreas Let?s act ourselves.
Xmas A capital suggestion !

Xmas. Whoe?er we meet thro project must chime in with?
Here?s the ? first robbjer ? ready to begin with.
All retire up.-?Enter Ye Wicked Squatter.
W. Squ. As older lands, if llegends be veracious,
Have ogres at whose inames kids cryjoyf-acious,
So has Australia ?for- in me behold
The type of all that?s naughty bad and bold,
A deep-dyed villain ?I?m the wicked squatter
Of every foul and evil thing the plotter,
With dummy cat?s-paws working in my pay,
My greedy grasp grips acres day by day,
The vital marrow of the land I suck,
Its bones, pro bono publico I chuck,
These, of my attributes, are just a few,
Stump speakers say so, and it must be true,
But soft ! the fair Victoria in distress,
She whom I must, I shall, I will possess! {Retires).
Enter Victoria.
Vie. Too bad to treat me thus ?I only asked
A paltry million, and I?m taxed and tasked
By all my guardians ?with their views upon it,
They like to meddle, even to a bonnet,
But I?ll not be dictated to - we?ll see,
I?ll leave their roof.
W. Squ. {Coming forward) Do, dear ?and fly with me,
Of their Protection you have had too much,
I?m a Free Trader, and will act as such.
Vie. More free than welcome ?prythee stand aside.
W. Squ. Not till you vow that you will be my bride,

I?ll stab you with a rose.
That?s how we talk together,
We darling Melbourne beaux.
My costume is by Milton made?
The tailor?not the poet;
I cast all others in the shade,
And the ladies?don?t they know it.
I meet some pleasant fellahs
Upon the Block each day;
We suck our umbe-rellahs,
And talk just in this way :
An revoir! by-bye ?think upon the whole,
I?ll buy some cigawettes, and toddle for a stroll.

As Mrs. Glass says first you catch your heir !
Gaff. Come, wife, we?ll find some comfort here.

To-morrow both you lads will have to pack.
[Exeunt Gaffer and Gammer into Inn.
Bru. Oh, I don?t care ! I?d like to see the world,
I?ve cut my eye-teeth?now I want ?em curled.
SONG?Betjno?Air, ?The New-York Swell.?
I?m just the sort of lively lad,
Who loves a girl instanter;
Wherever hearts are to be had,
I?ll win them in a canter.
I?ll promenade the new arcade,
And with the darlings toy,
Of me they never are afraid,
For I?m the ladies? joy.

there and have a little cash to spare.
For I?m the ladies? joy
A lively bit of a boy;
I love them all, both short and tall.

By Money Miller , when on pleasure bent,

This from another moneyed miller came,
Sam Ramsden?foiue young man and once my flame.
(within) Mary !
I?m coming?take good care of those,
They?re not bad gifts?let time their worth disclose.
Exit into Inn.
Oh dash her rye !
That naughty language drop,
I?ll through the village go, this rye to swop.
The Argus, Age, and Telegraph I'll scan
To see if some one wants a nice young man.
Exeunt Blondo and Bruno. Enter Vagabond.
The village is much changed?l see this more,
As I have never been this way before,
But ?tis the right thing for a man to say
When in this garb he enters in a play,
Now somewhere hereabouts should be a tap,
There is?my memory serves me?verbum sap.
Knocks,?Enter Maid.
Is this the Sailor?s Home?Albeury well,
My compass to a pint you?ll quickly tell
Once I was Worn and Wild, but now I?m buoyed
With hope of filling up this Aitken void.

These pangs 111 now a Latham with a quart
Of Carlton ?Castlemaine or Shamrock Brand

A quart ?
A quart ! [Exit Maid into Inn.
I like these quart-era much.
Be-enier Maid with Beer.
Your health! yes thanks ! I?ll take another such.
?Tis ten years since I tasted food or raiment.
That?s not the question.
What?s the matter ?
Payment.
Curious affinity there seems to hold
In this girl?s mind?betwixt these quarts and gold
Have done sweet maid with your unseemly dunning,
Here on the sea shore, oh pray cease your funning.
Do you not know ?
Who pays for this last shout P
(producing paper) By order of the King, I?ll read it oat,
Treat me no more as tho? but common mullock,
Behold a free pass signed Sir James McCulloch.

But do not write about us.
Well, I?ll not
Though quite prepared to act as your Reporter.
But quarts and gallonAry have gained you quarter.

That I am always most polite to ladies ;
So don't be Turrif- fied?You?il learn to bless
That mighty power?the freedom of the Press. [Exit Maid,

Asylum true of Hospita-lity.

This kindness doth for previous snubs atone.
Good girl, now go?we fain would be alone.
Exit Maid. Enter Blondo, with newspaper.
These ? Wantedsl? do not help me much, I see
There?s no demand alas ! for little me ;
But here?s an article whose author?s donned
The breezy, roving title, ? Vagabond. ?
I wonder who he is?he?s very clever !
You do me proud.
Are you he ? Well I never!
My path in life is traced upon this plan j
That I should ever seem some other man
Detecting shams, my own still undetected;
I always turn up where I?m least expected.
This being so, accept me as your friend; .
My aid to help you, I will gladly lend.
You are a brick.
At trifles I?m no sticker!
But now you?re not disguised.
I am? in liquor !
Soft, some one comes, remember, when in need
I?ll prove, as I have said, your friend indeed.
Retires up. Re-enter Bruno.
Bother this rye?for I can?t make them buy it.
All pull wry faces, everywhere I try it.
There ! Blondo ! You can have it. I despise it.
Why Bruno?? friendship?s offering ? ?you should prize it.
Pshaw ! what?s a bag of rye ??a stupid thing!
Aha! my blackbird?come sir, you must sing j
You won't! you shall !
Don?t teaze it?Bruno pray.
It?s not your bird?you let me have my way ;
How can you be so cruel ?here then. ?see,
My lucky sixpence?let me set it free.
, Right ! it's a bargain ?take the stupid bird.
( Opens cage ) There birdie fly. ( bird goes.
Well, Blondo, on my word,;
You are a soft?un, and much good you?ve done.

Bosh 1 Humbug! ! Nonsense 1! Send them all away,
We will transact no business on the day
When our sweet only daughter comes of age.
Let thoughts of pleasure all our time engage.
To clear these cobwebs of the state before us,
We?ll sing a birtbiday ode?and mind, a Chorus.
SONG. ?Kimg?Air?? Don?t Wake the Baby.?
The morniing I first heard the cry,
Of the Slaughter I adore,
I felt a ve)ry different man,
To whatt I?d been before,
For some time in the house, a nurse
Had aimed her awkward charms,
But at lasst upon that morning I
Found tsomething in her arms.
{Spoken). I never shall forget the memorable occasion. I felt as
proud as Gaunson whom he receives some of Purves?s compliments,
and was about to burst into jubilant song, when the nurse remarked?"
Don?t make; a noise, or else you?ll wake the baby,
Don?t make; a noise, or else you?ll wake the child.
Don?t makes a row, or you?ll disturb the infant.
But I fellt so awfully, awfully jolly,
I thoughtt I should go wild.
{Chorus.) Don?t make a noise, &c,
I sent thie news the counl ry round,
A huncdred bonfires blazed,
I bade tlhe bells and cannons sound,
With jjoy I went half-crazed;
.My feelimgs were so glorious,

Describe them no one can,
And the ladies seemed to look on me
As a very clever man,
(Spoken.) But when I went to see the Queen, to thank her for her
birthday present, and told her that I had ordered salvos of artillery,
and peals of bells, she looked up into my face, and said, in a weak
voice?
Don?t make a noise, &c.
King. Now, where?s our royal flute ? Real music mad am I,
But, as I?m Royal, therefore not a cad am I,
{The whistle slips down the King's throat,
Confound the thing, it?s in the royal thorax.
Duke. Help ! run for aid ! Get soap, starch, honey, borax!

Queen. He?s getting spotty.
C. Ph. Blood in various wee cells.
Hem ! May I ask you ?has he had the measles ?
That sound again?the previous squeaky and this
Give me a fortnit clue to what?s amiss.
Madam, it is my painful lot to toell
Your royal lord is?
Queen. What ?
C. Ph. Is imost unwell!
In fact, I may say ill. My diagrnosis
Points to acute hicocolorumosis.
Queen. Oh, dear! oh, dear ! what do you recommend ?
C. Ph. My treatment, on the weather- will depend
First, for our liege , some leeches ?say twelve dozen.
He doesn't like it?there?oo muis?n, mus?n.
Oo?ll soon be better ?next a pouind of pills,
A good black draught, a blister, :and some squills.
Enter Duke and assistants, with Corkscrew.

Yes ?no ?l have ! ?I haven?t! ?it?s slipped down.


King In our inside you?ve placed a thorn ?a thistle,
And made us pay right dearly for our whistle.
Cure us or die ! We?ll give you say a week,
Our mercy grants you thus ?another squeak !
Farewell the rounded periods, the big words,
With which we wrung applause from vulgar herds,
Farewell the gushing after dinner speeches,
We used to make inspired by?nuts and peaches,
Unless some means of cure you hit upon
Hey Diddle Diddle?s conversation's gone.
Come, Gertrude, come ! Your kindly help bestow,
Squeaking in great ones must not unwatched go.
Exeunt King, Queen and Courtiers,
C. Ph. To be or not be ?within a week,
Or he or I will have our final squeak,
Oh ! what a quack and physic slave am I,
To have my life on hazard of a die,
Bather than let the Fates thus do me brown,
I?ll smash your monarch?aye, and seize his crown.
I?ve heard that people sitting at a play,
When it was over rose and went away,
About! my brains?devise some cunning thing,
To catch the crown and spiflicate the king. [Exit.

CHRIS'TMAS
Comes but once a Tear,
And so does a birthday, I believe, althouggh I have somewhere read of
a man who, when he had been worshipping# too devoutly at the shrine of
the ? Roy God,? always explained that lit was his birthday. ConSe-
quently he had many birthdays I may tell you, dear reader, that I
am a married man, and it has always beeen the custom with my wife,
and I to make each other a present wheni the natal day comes round ;
some agreeable little surprise such as our - means will afford ; and as I
am in receipt of a very good salary we hawe hitherto been able to carry
out our ? pretty conceit,? as Shakespeare would say. Well ! a month
ago Rosa?s (that is my wife?s name) b'rth<Bay come round, and for some
days previously I had been casting about, in order to give her more
than ordinary ? agreeable surprise,? at length I hit upon it, in fact,
? Struck Oil.? 1 would present her with a new piano and suite f)r our
best parlor. I never ? Lingard,? but went at once to a Time Payment
House, and saw exactly what I wanted, Price �HS, Just when I was
about closing with the time payment man, young de Smythe, of the
civil service, was passing and I went out to speak to him, he naturally
inquired what I was doing there. I explained, and he at once very
energetically?for him?said ? I wouldn?t do it. He then explained by
recommending me to do the same as he bad done, viz- S to borrow the
money and buy for cash. I at once saw the financial gain to myself by
adopting this course, and accompanied by my friend, proceeded to S3
Collins street east (next to Mr. Milton, tailor); and as we walked down
the passage I said : What is the name of the gentleman you are going to
introduce me to ? ? That?s it up in the wvindow,? in the passage, said
De Smithe, and looking up, I read,
XX HENRY,
Money advanced from ��s to �lO,OOO.
We went round the end of the passage; to the private office, rang a
bell, and were admitted, and, as instructed by my fiiend, I made
application for a loan of �5O, *ND (GOT IT, I then went to an
auction sale, and purchased a piano and suite for that amount, ?which I
am told is equal to, if not better, than thee one for �B5.
The arrangement is to pay the money I back at �4 per month, interest
added at the rate of 8 per cent, and whenn ( surpiised ? Rosa? with the
above articles, and informed her how I haad got them, she laughinly told
me that, seeing an advertisement, she hhad sent a letter to 52 Collins
street east, to Mr, D. Henry, who callecd upon her and lent her the
�lO with which she purchased my last bbirthday present, and that the
last re-payment was made a fortnight ago*).

Listen, I?ll tell it you?to-morrow night.
Come, friends, a chorus, e?er you gaze your fill,
On the last triumph of John Hennings? skill.
FINALE.
AlR.??Climb Up;*
In honor of the cow, we?ll sing our final tune,.
For when she reached the mountain top
She jumped across the moon?
Across the moon!
And far beneath were forced to stop
The Dog, Dish, Cat, and Spoon,
For Daisy, helped by me.
The road she was bound to find,
So my lady cow, you see,
Soon all followers left behind.
That?s so! That?s so !
Soon all followers left behind.
She climbed up?din bed up,
Climbed up the tm uotain high!
For Daisy she liked the fun,
And never would she say die!
She climbed up?climbed up,
Climbed up the mountain high!
She liked the fun,
And never would she say die!
We like to see a host, of people nicely dressed,
And when we play a pantomime
We always do our best,
We do our best!
We?ve tried to make a pheasant time,
With merry song and jest.
And now our play is done
Grant your applause so warm?
Let it echo far and mar,
Like the break of a thunderstorm.
That?s so! Thai?s so!
Like the break of a thunderstorm.
Time?s up ! Time?s up !
Now. we must say ? Good-bye!?
But if you have liked our fun.
Then please crack it up sky high.
Time?s up! Time?s up!
Now we must say ? Gocd-bye !?
You like the fun?
Then please erack it up sky-high !
