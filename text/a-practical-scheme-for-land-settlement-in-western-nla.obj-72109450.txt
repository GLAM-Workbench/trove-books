A Pradical Scheme for
and Settlement
in Western Australia
W. N. HEDGES.
For many years 1 have advocated a system of LAND SET-
TLEMENT which I claim would ensure certain success in the
Eastern Districts.
In the first place to me it is apparent that the impossible is
expected from a new settler, and in many instances from settlers
of some experience.
They are allotted a block of land in its virgin state, generally
well covered with either timber, or scrub, or both. Ihe block is
often situated miles from a railway, and also a great distance
from water.
THE SETTLER IS EXPECTED TO KNOW:?
I?How to clear his land economically and thoroughly.
2 How to locate the most suitable site for his house.
3 How to provide a water supply.
4 ?How to build his house, stables, and sheds for fodder,
etc.
s?How to drive a team on unmade and often waterless
roads and to carry out many other necessary operations
before he can make a start in a very small way.
When he realizes that he has to make a farm out of the virgin
bush, the task before him is such as would dishearten probably the
very best and most useful settler.
AN ENGLISH SETTLER AND VIRGIN BUSH.
One instance came under my notice some years past. 1 was
passing along a back road which at that time was bordered for
miles on each side by bush and fairly big timber (for the Eastern
areas).
1 noticed a lot of cases and many pieces of furniture in the
bush near the road, which was at that time quite 25 miles from


the nearest railway station. 1 stopped, and a man and woman
walked out to speak to me, and told me it was their block and that
the carter had brought their outfit for them and they had to fix
up for the present some temporary shelter.
I wished them all sorts of good luck in their venture. 1 hey
were on a splendid block. They told me they were only lately
out from England. 1 could not help thinking: ?Whatever will
they do. The nearest water is at least five miles away.?
Some time afterwards, about three weeks, I think, I saw the
woman at the nearest railway station. I spoke to her and said :
?Going for a holiday?? She replied; ?No; I am going to book
our passage back to England, while I am in a position to do so.?
She said: ?My husband is a competent agriculturist and stockman;
has always had a good position at home.? She said: ?When we
made inquiries in England we were told we would have a farm
out here. You know what we have ?it is a forest. just fancy
my husband cutting one of those big trees down! He has never
before cut more than enough wood to boil the kettle.?
That instance so impressed me that I began then to consider
how the system which had frightened probably a first-class settler
could be so altered as to make a settler?s life more congenial and
also make it possible for him to have a home ready to receive
him, and at the same time not have to start on work the nature
of which was quite foreign to him.
In My Opinion Not One Settler in 500,
no matter from where they come, would have the required know-
ledge to economically carry out either one of the operations which
I have enumerated (1 to 5 on page 1). Yet we have a public
department ready to advance public money to a settler on the
best he can do, and their best a great number certainly very
willingly do. But at the same time, their best is a very poor asset
to the State.
I advocate now the same as I have advocated on dozens oh
platforms during election campaigns.
Take the area East of the present partially settled wheat belt;
survey all that area West of a line drawn from Southern Cross
to Esperance into 1,000 acre blocks and survey the roads after
the blocks are located and contour the grades where necessary so
as to obviate carting over the hills as at present.
Then take certain areas and locate what I would term pioneer-
ing dams, located to catch water sufficient for preliminary work.
Then, if possible, locate water by boring and select sites for
big stand-by dams which will, in the event of smaller dams going
dry, be available. One big dam to each 20,000 or 30,000 acres.
Then let big contracts for clearing at last 300 acres of
land on each 1,000 acre block.
By letting big contracts for clearing, contractors could then
procure the necessary plant, including substantial scrub rollers to

deal with mallee and scrub, and thereby avoid the tedious work
of cutting the lighter growths by manual labour, as at present
most settlers are obliged to do, which after all is waste ol time and
very costly. The settlers? time can be utilized to tar better ad-
vantage on work which cannot be done by horses, bullocks or
rollers.
I would suggest that a number of worn-out locomotive boilers
should be made into scrub-rollers, for which purpose they are
very suitable. The rollers could then be hired to the contractors
for clearing.
At the same time a site for a dam of at least 3,000 yards
should be located on each block by someone experienced m that
class of work and contracts let in such a manner as would ensure
the dams which were located on the best catchment being the hrst
to be excavated.
The dams in a certain area should be let to a man so that he
would have a routine of work which would allow him to procure
the best and most suitable plant.
CONTRACTS SHOULD BE LET FOR THE ERECTION OF
HOUSES, STABLES, AND IMPLEMENT SHEDS ON
EACH BLOCK.
Standard plans should be made for suitable four-roomed wood-
en houses with a 9ft. verandah on all sides, each house to have a
5.000 gallon galvanised iron tank for rain water.
The stable and shed conjoined, built with local timber for
posts room for eight horses on one side and room tor implements
on the other side, with enclosed feed shed at one end. also with
5.000 gallon galvanised tank.
Summed up it Would Mean:
On each 1,000 acre block to have:?
200 to 300 acres cleared land.
One 3,000 yard dam.
One four-roomed house with verandah and 5.000
gallon tank.
One stable and shed conjoined, with feed room
and 5.000 gallon tank.
The above work being done by contract under proper super-
vision, would be done very cheaply compared with the present
haphazard system.
The work as above, being done well and economically, woni c
be a valuable asset for the State and a comfortable home for the
settler, which he would be loth to leave, and an incentive for him
to make good right from the start.
I venture to predict that a very large number of the very best
class of settlers can be obtained within the Commonwealth, and in


many instances fathers would be only too pleased to help their
sons (who had been brought up on farms) to make a home of their
own.
I would advocate that the State should make
No Charge for 300 Acres of Land,
only for the work and improvements that have been carried out.
If we are to hold this lug valuable Commonwealth, we must
populate the areas which are now lying waste and acting as a
breeding ground for rabbits and other pests.
By Clearing the Land an Immovable Taxable Asset of the
State is Created.
As soon as a settler is doing well a tax can be collected. No
tax can be collected from waste lands. In its present state it is
not an asset but a liability and a menace ; settle the land and the
State as a whole will receive the benefit.
The present system of charging the settler for the land, be-
ginning from the day it is allotted to him, is really the greatest
wrong that could be perpetrated. It is a penalty imposed where
a subsidy should be freely given.
'J'he settler, when he is engaged on the stupendous work of
clearing the bush, is carrying out a service to the State, which
should not again be required from anyone. He is engaged in
creating an immovable taxable asset of the State. A freehold
is right to insure security of tenure, but it should make no differ-
ence to the State if the owners are changed; the immovable taxable
asset is there; then why penalize a settler for creating it? Instead
of so doing, help him, as I suggest. It would be the best money
ever spent. If a farm is worth having, it is worth making: it is
a benefit to the State as a whole.
The chief requirements to carry out this scheme of settlement
are food for men and horses, all or most of which is grown within
the State or within the Commonwealth.
The present tokens of exchange are paper notes, which, owing
to the sound and solid backing they have behind them are accepted
with confidence, otherwise their value is no more than sea shells,
marbles, or pebbles. What does it matter as long as they are-
accepted in confidence by all ?
Is there any other known means by which a more solid backing
and revenue producing asset can be quickly created by the use of
paper notes than by turning scrub land into an immovable taxable
asset? A place ?a home created where people can live and
prosper and who will be of the right type to defend this Com-
monwealth if needed.
Seme will say we cannot afford to carry out such a scheme..
It can be carried cut in the several parts of this big State to suit
the circumstances in the Eastern Districts for wheat, sheep, pigs,,
etc.; in other parts for fruit of all kinds, the cleared area for
which would be smaller compared to areas required for either
pastoral or agricultural settlement.

And when areas are settled for the purpose of fruit and vege-
table production, dehydrating, canning or preserving works, are
essential to ensure success, as may be shearing sheds and bacon
factories for the Eastern areas, as in dairying districts butter and
cheese factories would be also required to ensure success.
I claim we cannot afford to leave the big areas undeveloped.
What does it mean, after all? The work, when carried out, will
represent nothing but energy and brains applied in creating a
place for all time. Timber we have here for sleepers, houses, etc.
Iron we have in the Commonwealth for rails, etc.
In the present circumstances many settlers, energetic good
workers, are tired of the weary drag of getting the first 200 or 300
acres cleared, or through fear of increasing their debt to the State,
do not avail themselves of the very liberal advances that are avail-
able from the Industries Assistance Board, and are consequently
delayed in their developmental operations.
Others are reckless and don?t care how much they owe, and
in the end give up, leaving a debt upon the block that cannot be
taken over by the next settler who secures the same block.
A settler who could be classed as a first-class worker would
take about three years in which to have, say, 200 to 300 acres clear-
ed, a house erected and stable built, and probably a small dam
taken out ?and here I must say that generally dams are too small
and many go dry as soon as the hot weather comes along.
At the end of three years he would for certain owe more than
the cost of the comfortable prepared home farm in a big scheme, as
his accumulated interest and charges would be considerable, as
against the clean sheet when taking a prepared farm.
Three years means about 1,000 working days for one man, or 100
days for ten men, and if only 1,000 men were employed by the
different contractors in their several callings, a settler would be
placed on a partially cleared block every day, with his house, stable,
sheds and water supply from tanks and dams complete.
The success of the scheme is dependent upon the total obliter-
ation of the purchase of time system; so much work for a certain
sum of money must be obtained and the cost of the several opera-
tions must be such as will not overload the new settler, as if that
is done he has then to he penalized for the reason that wasters
have been paid to put in so much time and not on the value of
their work.
Interested and personal supervision is the remedy. Contractors
must be employed at fair and reasonable prices, and every assist-
ance should be given to them to obtain supplies of water and stores
for their workmen.
Professor Kennedy said, when speaking in Melbourne on
Australian industrial conditions: ?
?Time cannot be bought for the reason that it cannot be
be sold. Any nation, company or individual that bases


its operations on the purchase of time must go to the
wall. It is the product of time in which the world
trades.?
As each home farm is completed and passed on to a settler,
it should be possible for it to be partially or wholly paid for ; in-
stalment payments should be accepted at stated intervals on any
balance outstanding.
If the land has a value beyond the value of improvements
placed on it, that land value would help settlers to obtain money
with which to partially or wholly pay off their indebtedness to the
Government, and to carry out more clearing, fencing, and other
improvements.
Break up with suitable ploughs the areas cleared for each
home farm, the work to be done by contract as soon after clearing
is finished as possible, the cost to be added to sum total owing
for improvements.
Contractors are available for ploughing, and if necessary, crop
ping a portion or all of the areas cleared. 1 here would be plenty
of that class of work and first ploughing would be more cheaply
done by men who would continually follow up that particular work
than bv the settler. Everything possible should be done to make
for success. In lighter land, cultivating only is required, instead
of ploughing.
Expert advice should be available for the guidance of the
settler in all his operations.
After land is cleared and ploughed, the settler could put in a
crop the first year for hay, which would be required by contractors
for work. At present he has to cart horse feed, stores, and water
from long distances, and often has little time for developmental
work.
APPOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEES.
The scheme must be organized on good sound lines, and ad-
visory committees who have a local knowledge of the country
adjacent to the areas to be dealt with, should be appointed. Ihe
usual knowledge of office experts would be of little value compared
to the knowledge gained by actual pioneering experience. I feel
certain settlers would agree to meet at intervals within a reason-
able distance of their homes and act as local advisory boards.
The opening up of the Eastern areas would also assist the
settlement of the fruit and vegetable growing areas within the
heavier rainfall.
A market within the State would be a good stand-by, as fresh,
dried and preserved fruits would be required in large quantities
bv the wheat farmers.
TRANSIT.
Railways should be located and built ahead of the settlement,
if possible, and in no instance should a farmer be required to cart
more than six or seven miles to the railway, as at that distance
he could take a load to the station and return the same day.

Better facilities must be given here to allow the farmers to
compete successfully with others in countries which are situated
nearer to the markets of the world.
Farmers in the Commonwealth of Australia are severely han-
dicapped by the fact that their wheat, to reach the markets of the
world, must be transported the longest distance that any is carried,
which necessarily means the highest freights and charges have
to be paid.
Careful consideration must be given to obtain the best and
cheapest means for transit from the farm to the port of shipment.
Roads and railways must be carefully located with a view to
giving the farmer the easiest and best grade to cart to the station
or siding on the railway. \ his can only be done by the sidings
being so located that the roads leading to them will allow a
maximum load to be hauled by a minimum number of horses.
I regret to say that in the past no consideration has been
given to this most important question; or if it has been considered,
it has been by men who had little or no experience of where a load
can be taken by horses. Ihe rule appears to be to locate the
sidings on to]) of the hills and the farmer can get there with his
load as best he can. A very severe tax is imposed when six or
eight horses are required to do the work of four or five.
The greater the distance from the Port the better the facilities
for production should be. Railways and roads properly located,
good water supplies, telephone and telegraph Every
outback farm should lie connected by telephone, if possible, with
the nearest railway station.
It would save the cost in very little time, by saving many trips
to the station by teams and other vehicles, only to find the goods
have not arrived and probably no other train for several days, and
even then, no certainty of the next trip being more successful. The
telephone is not now a luxury, but a necessity.
There are numerous other matters which would need careful
consideration, but most of them would be quite easily ciealt with
as the work proceeded.
NOW FOR THE QUESTION OF FINANCE.
First. ?The State is not in a position to carry out this big
scheme.
Second ?It should not be expected to, as the chief benefit would
be to the Commonwealth .as a whole.
Third: Western Australia has already an impossible task in
hand in trying to develop an area which is one-third of the Com-
monwealth and which at present has only one-fifteenth part of the
population ; at the same time contributing a larger amount per
capita to the Customs and Excise and only receiving in return
the same allowance (viz., 25/- per capita) from the Federal Govern-
ment as the other States.
The other States having secured the bulk of our trade are also
receiving the benefit of our excess contributions to the Federal
Revenue over and above the average of the other States.


Many years past I urged that the excess amount which we
contribute as Custom and Excise above the average of the other
States should be returned to this State, in addition to the common
allowance to all the States of 25/- per capita.
We should then receive about 50/- per capita as a right, not as
an allowance or special dole, and had we received that amount
since 1910, when the Rraddon Clause terminated, there would be no
deficit here to-day.
How is it possible to run this State, one-third of Australia in
area, with a coast line from Eucla to Wyndham, and carry out all
functions of a State Government on the same per capita allowance
as a fully developed and thickly populated State like Victoria,
which was closely covered with railways built at a time when rails
and rolling stock could be purchased without paying a heavy duty
to the Federal Government, and when rails were to be had at a
very low price compared with their present value?
This State has yet to be developed, and on all the rails and
other requirements for that great work, heavy duties have to be
paid; really a tax and a penalty imposed on future development,
instead of assistance being given.
I have given a few reasons why this State should not be re-
quired to contribute to the cost of settlement as now proposed.
This State?s contribution should be 300 acres of land without
charge, absolutely free to the new settler.
The Federal Government should provide the money to carry
out the scheme I have proposed; the money should be free of
interest for all time.
Australia has lately been represented at the Washington Con-
ference of Nations, where it has been very properly decided to
limit the amount of money to be spent on the construction of
war vessels, and defensive and offensive works. That being so,
our only factor of defence is to populate this great and undeveloped
country.
The defence of this State and the Commonwealth is a Federal
function. The cost of one up-to-date war boat will go a long way
in carrying out a big settlement scheme, and while a war boat
is an expense to maintain, and is obsolete in a few years, a scheme
to settle thousands of comfortable prosperous people on the land
is a far better proposition than is the best war boat ever con-
structed.
Before the war started, who in this country would have be-
lieved that from two to three hundred millions of money could be
raised within our Commonwealth for the purpose of defending the
Empire ?
Twas ever thus when danger lowers

A very old verse, but still up-to-date! The call was answered
from a greater distance than ever before. Contributors to War

Loans subscribed freely, fully aware that the money was to be
used for the purpose of purchasing war material, that was to be
destroyed.
A valuable asset was saved: The Empire. Should we allow
our part of it to remain an idle waste? Thousands of valuable
lives were lost in saving it.
A\ ill the same contributors refuse to again come forward with
a very small amount for the purpose of creating an everlasting and
unconquerable factor of defence, which will bring joy and a happy
healthy prosperous life to not only the first settlers, but to future
generations; for I claim under the scheme I propose, the tedious,
heavy, dreary system of settlement will be totally obliterated. The
settler will have a home and comfort at the very time when it is
most required. Prosperity will be assured right from the first
year he obtains his block of land.
If that can be done, the settlers who have so pluckily endea-
voured to make good under the old system should have their con-
ditions improved. Relieve them of the payments for the land
that are still unpaid (for 300 acres at least), and give them the same
opportunity as the settlers in the new scheme in as many directions
as possible, especially in providing better access to the railways and
shortening up the carting where possible.
But to have an Industries? Assistance Board doing all it can
within its powers, and which at the same time can do nothing
towards making roads which are surveyed in the areas settled, or
to prevent the location of sidings or stations on top of the hills, is
a farce and, in the future, men who have a knowledge of where a
team can take a load, should have a voice in the location of roads,
railways, and stations. That would be real Industries Assistance !
The erection of standard houses, stables and implement sheds
should be part of this scheme to assist old as well as new settlers.
'Contracts could be let for hundreds of houses, all alike. It would
be surprising the difference in the cost; when the men got used to
the work, they could carry it out very quickly.
Then again, hundreds of settlers, while waiting, would be glad
to get work with the contractors, and by so doing would have an
opportunity of learning the best and easiest methods of carrying
out the several classes of work. They would then be better able
to continue the development of their own block.
Lots could be drawn for the blocks which were available, and
men who had been the longest time waiting should be the first to
be in the draw. There should be no difficulty in devising a satis-
factory and acceptable allotment of blocks.
One thing is certain: a move has to be made! The haphazard
-system of bringing hundreds of settlers here without having a
place to put each one, will cause a severe setback. Money to carry
out a scheme is, to me, a very secondary consideration. It is
available. The organisation is required, and a system which will
ensure comfort and success is the only one worth considering.


After the first four or five years, the settler should pay inter-
est on the value of his improvements, and I would suggest a tax
on any unimproved part of his 1,000 acre block. That would be an
incentive for him to push ahead with the clearing, and for him to
spend all the money he can on improvements during the first years
of freedom from interest.
Conditions such as I propose would allow him to procure
stock and implements without being submerged as many settlers
have been by accumulated debts piled up while they had no home,
no water, no feed for horses, and nothing but a black future.
I have said that a large number of settlers can be obtained
here, but the British Government have to help us by sending suit-
able settlers.
If reports are to be relied upon, there are plenty of unem-
ployed but willing workers now receiving assistance from the
British Government.
The British Government should willingly pay their passage to
this country, and render them sufficient assistance to give them a
start here. It would be a more sensible and cheaper proposition
than feeding them over there and making paupers of them instead
of useful citizens of a big Commonwealth.
The chief help should come from the Federal Government
for they would receive the first benefit through the Customs. The
little interest they would forego would be a trifle to the gain.
I can only most sincerely hope that the critics of my scheme
will be generous. So long as the object lam aiming at is attained,
I will be more than satisfied.
I will be glad to be supported by as many as possible who have
the welfare of this State, the Commonwealth, and the Empire at
heart, as I have.
Some will say there is a sand plain to deal with; others will
say that wheat will not grow so far out.
I have heard all that sort of talk before. Eyre?s Peninsula
on the West side of Spencer?s Gulf, South Australia, was only a.
few years since, mallee scrub. Now railways are all through it
for many miles with many thousands of acres growing wheat.
Wheat grows better in the semi-dry areas than in the wet
areas; instance, the Mallee Districts in Victoria, also Pinneroo,
Lameroo, and Loxton in South Australia, out East here in this
State, beyond Merredin, East of Waderin, Mount Arrowsmith
East of Kondinin, and Lake Grace at Ravensthorpe, and Esper-
ance. Who can say that it will not grow all the way from Ravens-
thorpe to Esperance and from Esperance to Israelite Bay and Port
Lincoln. I believe wheat will grow within a reasonable distance
of the South Coast all through this State. In the areas East, I
hope it will soon have a chance.
I am not afraid of the areas I have mentioned; any of it that
will grow good grass as I know it does (when cleared) no doubt
will grow wheat and other cereals.

No settler will be in distress with 1,000 acres of good grass

fully repaid.
1 believe in the out East of this State. If we don?t put it to
some use, all 1 can say is that we deserve to lose it. Don?t be
afraid! Get going as soon as possible! It can be done ?but
not by talking.
1 am not advocating what anyone has told me can be done. I
have developed a large area in the back blocks under very adverse
circumstances. 1 am not speaking with the knowledge gained
within range of the sound of a locomotive whistle, or where a Gov-
ernment water supply was available. For years, I. and scores of
other settlers, had to cart all our requirements over 50 miles from
the nearest railway. At that time, no roads were surveyed. We
had to follow tracks through the bush. We were then told by
many that we were going out too far, and yet wheat is now being
successfully produced quite 15 or 20 miles East of our Location. It
is want of knowledge that causes the word ?desert? to appear on
a map.
1 hope to see in the near future a sea of wheat and an area of
prosperous settlement extending from our (at present) most
easterly wheat farms, to Esperance and to Ravensthorpe, and away
East also. In addition to it being wheat growing country, it is.
when cleared, splendid grass country. No country that will grow
good grass can be classed as a ?desert.?
1 only hope many of my friends who have for years past heard
me advocate my scheme for Land Settlement, will now carefully
read through this and give it a lift by introducing it to as many as
possible, and thereby help inaugurate a new era for the settler.
They all deserve a better chance than many have had to date.
I have aimed at putting what I maintain is a simple, feasible,
and practical scheme before the public, in an endeavour to deal
with the problems of defence, national development, and the trans-
ference of suitable settlers from the congested centres of the Em-
pire to the idle, open spaces of the Commonwealth.
The accompanying photographs, all taken not less than 150
miles East of Perth, are for the purpose of demonstrating what has
already been done, and is still in the process of being accomplished,
in the areas immediately adjacent to the large undeveloped block
of country that lies between the present Eastern fringe of the
Wheat Belt and Esperance. They should make it clear to residents

The following article appears in the ?Australian Farming?
Journal, published in Melbourne, Victoria, on March 16, 1922, a
copy of which arrived after the above article was in type. Readers
will readily see that this fully confirms my convictions as regards
mallee and scrub country.
W. N. HEDGES.
(From Australian Farming, 16/3/22.)
The Mallee in Victoria is defined for statistical purposes as the
counties of Millewa, Weeah, Tatchera and Karkarooc. Ihe area
occupied comprises some 6,000,000 acres. Roughly, the land in-
cluded between the 36th parallel of latitude and the River Murray
is mallee, but the southern boundary, instead of being a straight
line, is really very irregular and confused. ihe annual rainfall
ranges from fifteen inches in the south, to about ten inches in the
northern limits. The native timber is mainly species of eucalypts
collectively termed mallee scrub. This has a characteristically
stunted appearance. A few Murray pines also occur. Most of the
mallee scrub may be readily cleared by rolling with a heavy roller
drawn by bullock teams. V\ hen dry, the scrub readily burns, and
is thus removed. Ihe grotesque, club-like roots are left behind
in the soil. Special stump-jumping machinery renders cultivation
practicable and easy.
The soil varies from fairly firm clay loams in the southern
and older settled parts to loose sandy loams in the north. Sand
hills occur throughout the area, especially in the northern portion,
where they are often regularly arranged and very definitely orient-
ated. In parts there are large tracts of worthless sand, white in
colour, and devoid of plant food.
The Pioneering Stage.
The settlement of the Mallee and its rise to prosperity has a
romantic fascination. 1 hirty odd years ago it was a waterless
area, covered with a dense thicket of scrub, and infested w itn
dingoes. In specially favoured patches a few cattle and sheep
eked out a miserable existence.
For many years it was regarded as waste country. Eventually,
however, the'introduction of the roller and the stump jump plough
opened the w r ay for cheap clearing and cultivation. Settlers from
adjoining territory cleared patches and sowed] wheat as a test.
They found that immediately after the scrub w r as burnt the soil
required little or no preparation for wheat. Ihe excellent crops
reaped induced the Government of the day to throw' the land open
for selection. The results were successful, though severe setbacks
were experienced through drought and lack of foresight. To-day
the area annually cropped in the Mallee totals roughly a million
acres, with an average yield of 10 to 12 million bushels.
About 12 years ago a new area to the north of the existing
settlement w r as opened up. Profiting by mistakes made m the
past, the railway was put in ahead of settlement, and a series of

water storages, with their catchment areas, were installed. Roads
were surveyed and cleared. Cattle and sheep men had previously
abandoned this country, yet at the end of eleven years wheat
growers had 450.000 acres under crop, which yielded grain worth
approximately �2,000,000 sterling. Thus where unorganised sheep
pasturing failed, wheat farming has triumphed.
Illustrating the ready manner in which cash returns may he
won from virgin land in the mallee, the following authenticated
figures supplied by a settler are not without interest. During the
first nine years of settlement, 31,304 bushels of wheat were grown
on a total of 2,488 acres cultivated, or an average of 12| bushels per
acre. 1 his period included two droughts, when little wheat was
harvested. On the average for the first seven or eight years, the
settler may expect to harvest 1,000 bags of wheat.

1 hese yields, of course, are not high ,but the important point is
that they enabled the settler to live and develop his farm during
the most strenuous period of settlement. He now has his farm
well improved and worth several thousands of pounds. The
pressing need for ready money is over, and a better system of agri-
culture ensuring higher yields can be practised. In considering
the low yields, it should be borne in mind that the cost of produc-
tion is exceptionally low because of the ease with which the soil
may be worked.
Changed Methods.
in the early years of settlement in the Mallee, the cultivation
methods are subjected to two pressing requirements. Quick returns
and the subjugation of the mallee shoots, which for a time en-
deavour to re-establish the original scrub.
J he settler rolls, burns, and sows without preparation as much
land as his resources will permit in the first year. He sows the
wheat without the bare fallow preparation which he knows to be
essential for the best results. In an ordinary season he may har-
vest a five or a six bag crop. In a good year he may get eight or
nine bags an acre. A light seeding, forty-five to fifty pounds to

the acre, is given, and from thirty to fifty-six pounds of manure.
Generally a tall growing wheat is selected, so that a good burn of
the stubble will be obtained, and thus the mallee shoots killed.
Then a further area of scrub is burned, and the whole of the cleared
area again sown with wheat, with the usual inexpensive seeding.
In four or five years the whole of the block of 640 acres will have
been cleared, cropped and burned over in this way, though, as a
rule, not more than two-thirds of the block is cropped in any
one year. Then when the shoots have been cpiite killed, fallowing
should be resorted to. When that stage has been reached, the
mallee farmer is within measurable distance of steady prosperity.
Greater attention may then be paid to sheep-proofing the block,
and to other essential improvements. Usually a definite crop rota-
tion system is adopted, and the fallow is carefuly cultivated with
the object of storing the maximum of moisture. More prolific
wheat varieties like Federation are employed, and the rate of
seeding and manure increased. As a rule, as settlement proceeds,
there is some aggregation of the holdings. Two blocks, 1280 acres,
is looked upon as a very satisfactory size.
Successful Mallee Farms.
The 640 acre farm of Mr. R. F. C. Gniel, at Walpeup, is an
instance of what can be done with Victorian mallee in a decade
by a settler starting with a few hundred pounds capital. When
Mr. Gniel selected his block twelve years ago, it was covered with
mallee scrub and native pine. Within a few years this was cleared,
and the holding subdivided into seven paddocks. A comfortable
homestead has been erected, and water storages totalling 5000
yards excavated. The farm buildings comprise stable, barns,
machinery sheds, etc. The whole has been effectively laid out,
and shade trees planted. The improvements are on a substantial
scale, and compare more than favourably with many in districts
settled for fifty years. Mr. Gniel has erected the whole of these
improvements out of profits made on the block, and he has been
able to live in reasonable comfort meanwhile, and has lately pur-
chased a motor car.
In the initial years he was forced to sow his wheat without
fallowing, but for two or three years past he fallowed carefully.
His high opinion of the value of fallow was more than confirmed
in 1919, when the total rainfall registered in the district was only
seven or eight inches for the year, and of this a considerable por-
tion fell outside the growing period of the crop. The whole of
the stubble-sown crops in the district were practically a failure,
but Mr. Gniel had in 200 acres of wheat on fallow, which averaged
about eighteen bushels to the acre. The following were the in-
dividual operations involved in raising this crop. Ihe fallow was
thoroughly ploughed in July. Subsequently it was harrowed twice,
scarified, and harrowed again before harvest time. After harvest
it received two further harrowings, and was scarified and drilled
in April and early in May. The effect of this careful cultivation
was to conserve moisture from the year before, and render it


u
available to the crop in the dry year that followed. Sixty pounds
of seed and thirty-five pounds of superphosphate were used per
aci e. It is probable that a still heavier crop would have been
reaped had the manure been increased to sixty pounds per acre.
In the Mallee districts first settled thirty years ago, little
stubble sown wheat is now sown, and the land is otherwise sys-
tematically fai ined. !he methods adopted there approximate more
closely to those of the \\ immera further south. Oats are grown
fairly systematically in rotation with wheat; sheep are kept to
trim weeds in the fallows and consume the grass in the resting
paddocks. In a number of instances as much as one and a half
bushels of wheat and 112 pounds manure are applied per acre,
though the average would be about sixty-five pounds, with seventy-
pounds manure. Messrs. 12. George, Schneider Bros., W. J.
Collins, among others, are successful farmers in the Beulah district,
who apply from one and a half bushels to as high as 100 pounds ot
seed, with superphosphates ranging from eighty to 112 pounds
