The city proper stands about 58 feet above sea-level, in 27 degrees
28 minutes 3 seconds south latitude and 153 degrees 6 minutes 15
seconds east longitude. Its climate closely resembles that of Southern
California —that is to say, it enjoys one of the mildest temperatures
in the world.
On a sunny morning, in a land where the weather is nearly always
bright, the seaward approach to the city across the blue waters of
Moreton Bay is delightful. The bay itself is picturesquely studded
with islands. On Cape Moreton, the most northerly point of Moreton
Island, there is a fine lighthouse, 75 feet high, with a revolving light
400 feet above sea-level, and visible for twenty-seven miles. On
Stradbroke Island is Dunwich, the State Benevolent Institution; on
St. Helena, the Penal Establishment; on Peel Island, the Quarantine
Ground.


EXECUTIVE BUILDINGS, WILLIAM STREET,
The Pile Light indicates the channel leading into the river, along
which, by mangrove banks, with many a graceful curve, past factories
and works, villas and wharves, long reaches of water and picturesque
hills, the steamer carries the voyager into the heart of the city.
As’you stand on the deck of the steamer watching the beautiful
river banks, covered with handsome residences embowered in greenery,
you comprehend why Brisbane has been called ‘ ‘ The Villa City. ; ’
Besides being the Metropolis of the State, Brisbane is the port
and trade centre of many fertile districts. Behind it, to the immediate
west, is the rich Moreton District —a flourishing province devoted to
farming, stock-raising, dairying and coal-mining. Beyond it again,
across the Great . Dividing Range, stretches the far-famed Darling


Downs; 4,000,000 acres of the finest agricultural land, equal in area
to the American States of Illinois and Missouri.
Railway lines from Cunnamulla (604 miles distant) in the far
south-west, and Wallangarra (233 miles) on the New South Wales
border, are feeders to the trade of the City.
On the North, the North Coast Railway, tapping the rich agri-
cultural and timbered provinces on the eastern seaboard and extending
thence to Rockhampton—396 miles —and on to Longreach, in the
Central West, brings in its volume of trade; whilst on the south the
prosperous and well-populated districts on the Northern Rivers of
New South Wales will soon be linked by railway with the Queensland
capital.
Brisbane abounds in fine buildings, among which may be men-
tioned the Executive Buildings—an imposing structure —the Treasury,
Parliament House, the Queensland National Bank, Supreme Court,
Queensland Club, Central Railway Station, the Commercial .Travellers’
Club and New Zealand Insurance Company’s Building.
There are eleven banks in Queen street, the main thoroughfare.
Two Cathedrals, one for the Anglicans, the other for the Roman
Catholics, adorn the City. A number of fine churches, belonging to
the various other religious denominations, raise their spires in different
parts of the City.
The Brisbane River is spanned by an imposing iron bridge, 1,022
feet in length, 74 feet in width, erected at a cost of £109,326.
The chief business centres are Queen street, Fortitude Valley,
and Woolloongabba, where many establishements do a trade over the
entire State and beyond.

SOUTHERN AND WESTERN LINE
Ipswich.
Ipswich (24 miles). Centre of coal-mining, woollen, cotton, and
other manufacturing industries, including splendidly equipped Kailway
Workshops. Fassifern Branch Line (35 miles) runs through important
farming and dairying districts, giving excellent opportunities of seeing
country. Esk Line extends up the valley of the Brisbane 59 miles, now
being rapidly brought under dairying and other forms of agriculture;
condensed milk factories on both Esk and Fassifern Lines. Estimated
population, 15,250.
Toowoomba.
The journey to Toowoomba and back can, if necessary, be made in
one day, leaving at 7.50 a.m., and returning by the Sydney mail, which
leaves Toowoomba at 5.5 p.m. Fares (return), 275. lid. and 18s. 3d.
This would leave about five hours for lunch and a run round Toowoomba,
which has some very picturesque walks and drives, as, for instance, out
to Picnic Point and Middle Ridge, or over to Drayton. In addition to
the range scenery, which is extremely picturesque, the elevation attained
being just on 2,000 feet, the traveller to Toowoomba enjoys a view of,
perhaps, the most prosperous of all Queensland’s farming districts —
namely, the elevated plateau in the neighbourhood of Grandchester (44
miles), Laidley (51 miles), and Gatton (61 miles). Between the two
lastnamed is the College Siding, and those interested will avail themselves
of the opportunity of paying a visit to the Agricultural College under the
superintendence of Mr. Mahon, which is but a short drive from the
station. From Toowoomba the Crow’s Nest Line (34 miles) runs into
fine country, timbered heavily with pine. Ravensbourne, with its charm-
ing tree ferns and waterfalls, is reached from this line. The Pittsworth
Branch (36 miles from Toowoomba, and now in course of extension to
Milmerran) runs well into the wheat areas, past the Experimental Farm
and the Reformatory for Boys at Westbrook, and through several of the
finest estates on the Downs. Another branch line in the vicinity of. Too-


woomba is that from the main Western line to Walloon, a distance of 33
miles, and running through the farming district in the neighbourhood of
Goombungee. Population of Toowoomba (estimated), 14,700.
OBSERVATORY, WICKHAM TERRACE.
Warwick and Stanthorne.
Southward to Warwick (169 miles), the traveller crosses the far-
famed Darling Downs. Warwick, too, is a charming town, and, taking
a few days to “ do” the district, one may have a run up the Killarney


Branch Line (28 miles) amongst the wheat fields and dairy farms,
offering a varied prospect of hill and valley—here a patch of virgin
scrub, there a rich green lucerne paddock, and anon; in the proper season,
mile after mile dotted with golden corn in stocks, and the reaper and
binder humming busily at its work. The Hermitage State Farm, on this
line, is only 5 miles out of town. Warwick is the coursing centre, and in
the season many exciting runs are witnessed. Freshwater fishing is
available in the Condamine, and in the mountain streams near Killarney
one may occasionally see the duck-billed platypus in his native habitat.
Stanthorpe (207 miles from Brisbane), amongst the granite hills of the
Southern border district; cherries, apples, pears, &c., grow to perfection
(altitude 2,656 feet). This is the home also of tin mining, and dredging
work is still carried on with profit. The line along the Southern border
from Warwick to Goondiwindi is being extended to Dirranbandi.
Dalby.
On the Western Line, which branches at Toowoomba, one may visit
the Sanatorium at Dalby, selected on account of the extreme dryness of
the atmosphere. Cultivation is gradually encroaching on the sheep
country here; and a trip up to the Bunya Mountains, about 60 miles
distant, with their tree-clad ranges and bright lucid streams, would, by
this time, form a pleasant interval, especially to those fond of shooting.
A branch line connects Dalby with Bell (24 miles). Train leaves at
12.22 p.m. Monday and Thursday, 1.55 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Friday, and 5.0 p.m. Saturday. Leave Dalby at 3.0 p.m. Monday and
Thursday, 6.20 Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Saturday 8.25 p.m.
is best means of visiting this part of the district. A branch line is in
course of construction from Dalby to Tara, along the Moonie Valley.
BOUND NORTH.
Much has been said and written of the delights of the trip, amid
placid seas and cloudless skies, where the Pacific well deserves the title
bestowed upon it by early navigators; but every new visitor returns
declaring, like the Queen of Sheba, that ' ‘ the half had not been told. ’ ’


The ever-varying forms of rock and island, the sturdy mountain ranges
with cloud-wreathed summits, rising a mile into the balmy air, and the
long wash of the protecting Barrier Reef, all proclaim our rich heritage
in what has appropriately been termed “ The Winter Paradise of
Australasia. ’ ’
Northumberland Islands, The Percys, The Beverley Group, Pine
Inlets, Whitsunday Passage, Palm Islands, Hinchinbrook Channel, and
many others, cease to be mere geographical terms, and become for all
future time keywords to a series of glorious pictures, a panorama of
Nature’s own beauty spots—of quaint rocky crags like Lion Island, or
tree-clad summits and surf-torn reefs, of sheltered sandy beaches, and
cool vine-clad recesses in the hills.

CONTROL OF TRAFFIC.
Under the provisions of “ The Brisbane Traffic Act of 1905,” the
exclusive control of Traffic passed into the hands of the Police within a
certain area, known as the Metropolitan Traffic District, which com-
prises the cities of Brisbane and South Brisbane; the towns
of Ithaca, Toowong, and Hamilton; and the Shires of Windsor,
Coorparoo, Stephens, and that portion of Balmoral west of
Bulimba Creek. Under this Act very extensive powers are
conferred on the Commissioner of Police for the enforcement
of Regulations for the effective control of general vehicular and pedes-
trian traffic, the temporary closure of streets, as occasion may require, and
the diversion of traffic, or any particular class of traffic, from any street,
the holding and regulating of processions or public meetings in the
District. Very ample powers are also vested in the Commissioner of
Police for the adoption of Regulations pertaining to the licensing and
regulating of public vehicles and the drivers and conductors thereof,
embracing tramway traffic, and for the punishment of persons offending
against the Regulations. Sub-Inspector P. Carroll is the Superintendent
of Traffic, whose special duty is the supervision of the Police in the
enforcement of the Traffic Act and the Regulations thereunder. Any
communication relating to traffic matters should be addressed to this
officer, in care of the Police Department, Traffic Office, Elizabeth street.
