FOREWORD
THIS Exhibition is a new departure. For many years now
it has been the custom for the Institute of Architects of
New South Wales to exhibit plans and illustrations of some
of the current work of its members, but this year, by the co-opera-
tion of the Board of Architects of New South Wales and the Royal
Victorian Institute of Architects, it is able to present, instead, an
exhibition of contemporary architectural work in many lands.
It is well that we should sometimes turn our eyes from our own
work to that of our brethren elsewhere, for the problems we all
have to face are much the same. And, in studying how men
elsewhere, circumstanced perhaps very differently as to materials,
labour, and economic conditions, have overcome their difficulties,
we may well find help in facing our own.
It is in this that the real value of the study of architectural style,
whether contemporary or historical, really lies. There is little to
be gained by studying results alone, but there is everything to be
gained by the careful study of the effect of local conditions in
bringing about that result. What is done certainly matters, but
why it is done matters much more.
To know how they build from New York to New Guinea may
betoken the cosmopolitan, but to know why they build so is the
mark of the scholar.
Cosmopolitanism in architecture is a questionable virtue. Indeed,
it would not be difficult to state a strong case against it, for many
of the most satisfying buildings in the world have been produced
by men who knew little or nothing of what others elsewhere had
done or were doing, whilst some of the most fussy and restless
buildings extant simply shout their designer’s cosmopolitanism.
But, provided we keep ourselves well in hand, provided we remem


ber that what may be meat in Stockholm may be poison in Sydney,
such an exhibition as this should be of immense value to us all.
It should freshen our outlook, provide us with a wealth of inspir-
ation, and send us back to our own work with renewed enthusiasm,
resolved to face our own problems in such way as our particular
environment may demand, but albeit as faithfully and as sincerely
as have our colleagues whose work is here shown.
If such is the result of this venture, the committee which has
laboured to bring it about, as well as all those in this and other
lands who have lent us their work, will doubtless feel amply
recompensed.

INTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
IT is a moot point as to whether there is such a thing as Inter-
national Architecture, but owing to the vastly increased
facilities of communication and transport, national isolation
in all spheres of life has been very considerably modified. The
Architects of the world are in closer touch with each other than
ever before. New tendencies in design, new methods and
materials, experiment and research, wherever practised and
employed, are looked upon as efforts to advance the Art ot
Architecture for the benefit of all mankind.
International Associations exist and International Architectural
Congresses are held which, resulting in the pooling of the ideas
and experiences of the ablest practitioners, must help to promote
interest in and appreciation of the importance of good Archi-
tecture as an agent of public well-being.
It is true that to-day many classes of buildings, such as great
shops, office blocks, hotels, banks, libraries and the rest, show
a close agreement to type in whatever part of the world they may
be erected. To this extent they may be considered as examples
of International Architecture.
Now while some may regret the weakening of local characteristics
in building, when it is realised that such local peculiarities are
due to a purely local set of conditions and outlook, it will be seen
that a broadening of outlook and a breaking down of isolating
influences must result in a greater similarity of Architectural ex
pression corresponding to the tendency to similarity of customs
and needs.
In all periods a time has come when the then fully developed
manner of building has become incapable of successful adaptation
to the new problems of the day. After declining under this mis-
use, the style has finally given way to something quite fresh, and
when this is successful it will be found to be so because the
solution conforms with the great principles of design which are
everlasting and quite independant of time and place. When the


functions of a building type, as in the church and much domestic
work, and the materials and methods suggested by sound
economy, have not changed for centuries, we shall expect little
variation. But when a structure is required to serve an entirely
new purpose, or new materials and new structural systems make
possible entirely new forms, vast spaces and the execution of
conceptions hitherto unpracticable, then we must expect to see
buildings of entirely new aspect.
At first the natural conservatism in many of us may cause us to
be shocked by this novelty of aspect.
But in most cases if we logically and fairly apply sound criticism
we shall find that, where the basic laws have been observed, the
novel result satisfies, and will take its place with other examples
marking the true course of Architectural development.
What are these basic laws, these essential attributes of fine
building? Surely first comes Proportion—not only the niceties
of proportion which appeal to the trained and sensitive eye, but
the practical proportioning of space to purpose of traffic route to
traffic, of general character to function, of light to shade or solid
to void, of richness to simplicity, of colour to colour. And then
Proportion’s brother scale—a matter of both actual and relative
dimension. The human species has not greatly increased in
stature recently; why then the vast increase in scale of many
modern buildings all over the world? Size is not synonymous
with grandeur, not cost with value. Then we must never forget
the spice of contrast —beauty of texture and its servant light—and
perfect craftmanship.
A recent writer has aptly suggested that useful guidance to one
who would estimate the value of an Architectural work is to be
found if he will look for those qualities in the building which he
finds in his fellow-men —whom he admires —dignity, directness,
beauty of form, honesty, politeness and, above all, character. In
the same way those qualities in men which repel us —deformity,
INTERNATIONAL ARCHITECTURE


vulgarity, ostentation, unneighbourlincss, dishonesty, meanness,
or the absolute nonentity—when found in buildings, will have the
same effect upon us. A building, excellent in itself, may be very
bad in certain situations, a well-mannered design will know its
place. Let us all therefore try to take an interest in our buildings;
see that they be worthy of us and our successors. Beauty is
priceless and costs no more in money than ugliness. Beauty is
that which interests and, having attracted, gives pleasure by
appealing to the best that is in our natures.
The layman should be no more afraid of expressing critical appre-
ciation of a work of Architecture than of appreciating a beautiful
view, a painting or sonata. Let us then notice the buildings which
surround us, especially in cities, for what is a city but a grouping
of buildings? Now while planning, and without good planning,
there can be no good Architecture, and interiors of buildings may
interest and affect the lives of hundreds, the exterior and the city
plan will influence the hundreds of thousands, and the owners of
the buildings and the rulers of the cities have a duty to perform
-towards those thousands.
In a review of present day examples many lines of endeavour may
be discerned, some based on expression of function, some on
emphasis of structure, some on ideas of abstract form —sometimes
regardless of convention or reason, and a very large group on the
letter of passed styles without the spirit. But happily there are
many able workers who seem to have found the key 7 to a beautiful
and logical development, those we try, often successfully 7 to cap-
ture the spirit which animated the masters of the past, thus
producing not something superficially similar to what a Greek, a
Roman, a Byzantine, for a builder of old Florence or Chartres did
create, but what they 7 probably would build were they in our shoes
to-day 7 . By 7 all means let us cultivate acquaintance with these old
spirits, but blended with the spirit of to-day 7 —and even to-morrow.

Czecho-slovakia
This collection of reproductions from the monthly review STYL
(Prague) has been presented to the Royal Victorian Institute of
Architects by the Society of Architects in Prague. A catalogued list is
not given since a uniform method of identification is employed through-
out and translations accompany each illustration.
[Much of the modern Architecture in Czecho-Slovakia is due to the
work of Professor Jan Kotera, who is represented in this Exhibition.]
