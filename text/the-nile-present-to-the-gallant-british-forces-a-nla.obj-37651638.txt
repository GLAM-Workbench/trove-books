Preface
The object of this manual is clearly
indicated by the title, it is indented to be a
companion to British, Australian and Indian
forces stationed in Egypt.
m •
It has been' so arranged as to be quite
adapted to'the use of the foreign student of
the arabic language.
v
The present method does not pretend to
exhaust the list of slang phrases, but only
to give those which have crept into ordinary
use, and are understood, although they may
not be used by all educated people. At least
eighty percent of the phrases are fresly gathe-
red and made for the occasion, instead of
having been picked up in reading.
In the preset manual instead of attem-
pting to divide the work into alphabetical
from I have thrown the work into chapters
treating of colloquial phrases.


My aim has been to embody the accen-
tuation of 6Very word with hundreds-of verbs
in constant use as well as the familair sentences
current in general conversation which migh
become a reliable guide for the practical
acquisition of the Enchanting arabic tongue.'
In making selections for this handy poc-
ket-book, I feel that I have supplied the
want of the practical learner to acquire a
converstional knowledge of colloquial arabic.
Great pains have been taken to insure corre-
ction in the prononnciations throughout the
whole of this manual, nothing calculated to
facilitate the learner’s progress has been over-
looked or omitted.
: t
I entertain the hope that the present work
will meet with a favourable reception from the
British students in general and the British
Forces stationed in the land of pharahos in
particular,
(N. I. J.)
